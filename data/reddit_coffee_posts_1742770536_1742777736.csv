I’ve been on remeron for over a year (I have to take the brand name because I was locking my jaw on generic and that stopped, thankfully, when I switched). I am very sensitive to medication and had a horrible time building up to 15 mg very very slowly. 

Thankfully, it has helped my insomnia, anxiety, and lack of appetite tremendously - but the appetite a little too much. I find that I am still getting used to it and my anxiety is still improving. Any chance the munchies will die down? They seem to peak for me in the evening (well before I take my night dose). But I drink iced tea or iced coffee all day to keep from eating when I am sitting around so it’s possible that it just seems worse when I am trying not to drink so much in the hours before bed.

I love street food here in Thailand and Karachi street food looks amazing too, so hopefully your suggested areas will be super vibrant and have all.the.food.

I'm not looking for anything cheap but I'm also not looking at super high society living either, if that makes sense? Living with mix of expats and Karachi locals in the area is my aim.

Townsville, Virginia, was a vibrant city nestled on the East Coast, just a stone's throw away from Washington, D.C. As a suburban hub to the nation's capital, it was home to many federal workers who commuted daily from Townsville to Washington, where the President resided in the White House. Surrounding Arlington, Virginia, Townsville was ideally located in the dynamic and diverse D.C.-Maryland-Virginia (DMV) area, offering countless opportunities for its residents.

Thanks to an efficient metro system, townspeople could easily travel to Maryland, Virginia, or Washington, D.C., making commuting a breeze. Over the years, Townsville had blossomed into a thriving and growing community, largely due to the economic opportunities in the DMV region. And of course, much of this success was owed to Townsville's iconic trio of superheroes—the Powerpuff Girls—who not only protected the city but had become symbols of hope and unity for its people.

Before Townsville unveiled its Residential Treatment Program for villains, the city's crime rate was skyrocketing. Frustrated with the increasing violence, the city sought a solution to secure its dangerous criminals. The decision was made to establish a residential treatment program for Townsville's villains, where they would be detained until their evaluations were reviewed by psychiatrists. Police officers were tasked with bringing in each of the city's villains to stay at the facility for assessment.

At the Residential Treatment Program for Townsville's villains, a group of notorious criminals had been housed for rehabilitation. Among them were Mojo Jojo, Fuzzy Lumpkins, HIM, the Gangreen Gang (minus Ace, who had left early to join the band Gorillaz), Princess Morbucks, Sedusa, Femme Fatale, and more. The program's psychiatrists worked with each villain to help them understand the concept of redemption—an effort to atone for past wrongdoings and restore one's integrity, reputation, and moral standing. Redemption wasn't just about seeking forgiveness; it was about actively working to correct past mistakes and changing one's behavior going forward.

The program also provided group sessions and workshops to assist in their rehabilitation. One night, Rob led an Anger Management group therapy session. The room was filled with twenty familiar faces—each a villain from Townsville—sitting in a circle, ready to confront their inner demons. Mojo Jojo was the first to speak up, venting his frustrations about the humiliation he felt from being repeatedly defeated by the Powerpuff Girls, his own sisters.

Rob listened attentively, offering validation as each villain shared their struggles and sought ways to redeem themselves. As the session continued, the group began to open up about their dark pasts. Mojo Jojo revealed the deep trauma he carried from witnessing his mother's death after a rampage in an attempt to protect her baby chimpanzee at a sanctuary near Shreveport, Louisiana. Ace Copular confessed the hardships his family faced growing up in poverty in the Bronx, New York. Snake shared his story of being expelled from a boarding school in McLean, Virginia, after vandalizing property with Ace. Arturo opened up about how his father was jailed for seizing drugs when they illegally entered the D.C.-Maryland-Virginia area from Mexico. Femme Fatale tearfully recounted the trauma of being assaulted by a fraternity member while attending the University of Virginia. And many others shared their painful pasts.

Two years passed, and some of Townsville's villains were discharged from the Residential Treatment Program. Thanks to the hard work of their psychiatrists, many had made significant progress, and were now embarking on new chapters in their lives, leaving behind their villainous pasts. The Gangreen Gang disbanded: Ace had left early to sign a contract with the band Gorillaz, while Snake completed his GED at the program and earned a spot at the prestigious Stanford University in California, thanks to financial support from his wealthy family. Arturo moved to Silver Spring, Maryland, to run a successful Mexican restaurant with his cousin. Grubber returned to the United Kingdom to pursue a degree at Oxford University, hoping to become a novelist. Big Billy moved into a group home designed for special-needs monsters. Fuzzy Lumpkins left the treatment program to return to his cabin, where he could spend more time with his grandchildren. Sedusa transitioned to a career in marketing within the beauty industry. And then there was one more...

Mojo Jojo, once the infamous enemy of the Powerpuff Girls, was the first villain to undergo treatment at the Residential Treatment Program. He was also the first to open up about his past in front of twenty familiar faces, along with his therapist, Rob. Over the course of three years, Mojo Jojo attended therapy sessions where he worked through the trauma of his early life. Like many chimpanzees, his early experiences with humans had been harsh—captivity and abuse left deep emotional scars. His most painful memory was learning that his mother had been shot while trying to protect him when he was just a newborn.

Mojo Jojo's story didn't end there. Shortly after losing his original companion, Joe, to an allergic reaction to Chemical X, Professor Utonium—his surrogate father—rescued a newborn chimpanzee from Louisiana. Professor named him Jojo, and the little chimpanzee brought a bit of light back into their lives.

As if those traumatic events weren't enough, Mojo Jojo also carried the weight of a health diagnosis. At just 13 months old, he was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes. He vaguely recalled the time when Professor took him to a veterinary hospital in Washington for blood tests. The results confirmed the diagnosis, and a veterinary assistant explained it to Professor, noting that Mojo Jojo was classified as an animal at the time. Thanks to pet insurance, he was able to get the insulin he needed to manage his condition.

During his time in the Residential Treatment Program, Mojo Jojo focused on preparing for the SATs, with the goal of being accepted into the bioengineering program at Virginia Tech, where his surrogate father had once studied. But when Mojo Jojo was finally released from the program, he found that his lair was set to be demolished. The city council had approved the plan to raze the building, leaving him with no place to call home. With nowhere else to go, Mojo Jojo decided to move back into the Utonium household. He traded his old supervillain uniform for a simple T-shirt, khaki shorts, and a pair of brown Birkenstock sandals. To support himself and save for his future at Virginia Tech, Mojo Jojo took a part-time job. He was determined to build a new life for himself—one that didn't revolve around villainy. But then, one day...

At the Utonium household, Mojo Jojo stood in the kitchen, dressed casually in a gray ""Virginia Tech"" T-shirt, navy blue twill shorts, and matching navy blue Hoka sneakers. His Apple Watch rested on his wrist, and his AirPods played music as he sipped from a mug of coffee. Just then, his surrogate father, Professor Utonium, entered the kitchen. Dressed in his usual white lab coat, with pens tucked into its pocket and a shirt and tie underneath, he held a large envelope in his hands.

""Good morning, Jojo,"" Professor Utonium said, a smile on his face as he held out the envelope. ""I think this might be an acceptance letter for you.""

Mojo Jojo eagerly opened the envelope and scanned the letter. His eyes lit up as he read the news, then he turned to Professor, beaming with excitement.

""I got accepted to the bioengineering program at Virginia Tech!"" Mojo Jojo exclaimed, a wide smile spreading across his face. ""I need to tell my girlfriend—this is such great news! I am finally on track to earn my bachelor's degree in Bioengineering.""

The two embraced, a moment of pride and joy shared between them. The hug lingered, a quiet but powerful sign of how far Mojo Jojo had come.

In March 2025, the room was filled with twenty familiar faces, all former or current villains from Townsville, gathered in a circle for another session of anger management therapy. Rob, the same therapist from their previous meetings, sits at the front of the room, clipboard in hand, ready to guide them through today's session. As the group chatters and settles down, the door swung open. Mojo Jojo entered, wearing a navy blue hooded sweatshirt, Under Armour shorts, and a pair of navy blue Hoka sneakers. His Apple AirPods were securely in place, and he was clearly late, though he did not seem too bothered by it. The sound of a faint music beat could be heard through his AirPods.

""Apologies, I have arrived late due to my crossfit class. I was keeping track of my blood sugar levels with Dexcom,"" Mojo Jojo said, walked over and sat between HIM and Sedusa.

""Monkey Boy... Where is your supervillain outfit?!,"" Him asked suspiciously, dressed in the red jacket and skirt with pink tulle at the collar and hemline, a black leather belt with a bronze buckle, and black, thigh-high, spike-heeled boots.

""These outfits are for crossfit class...I don't think I will wear a supervillain uniform in this picture anymore,"" Mojo Jojo said, removed his Apple AirPods and sweated.

""Hey, you! Get off my property! Now!"" Fuzzy Lumpkins dressed in his denim overalls with a red cap; ""Make America Great Again.""

""Whatever,"" Snake shrugged, dressed in a black hooded sweatshirt, khaki shorts, Black Vans SK8-Hi Sneakers, and a brown Kangol hat that was always worn backwards, ""MAGA movementss have irritated me at all timesss…""

Ace nodded.

""SHUT UP, FREAK LIBERAL!"" Fuzzy Lumpkins barked at Snake.

""Calm down, Fuzzy Lumpkins,"" Rob reminded, ""Audience, let's ask us questions.""

My parents split and I wound up in California. I spent my summers in Georgia helping my Dad service the Atlanta metro area.

  
I'm visiting soon. I'm sure the restaurant is gone. But, if it still exists, I'd love to visit.

  
I spent summers there from, oh, I don't know, 1990-2015, maybe? I think the time in question was closer to 2000, if I had to pick.

My Dad serviced offices. I think Standard Coffee. We'd rotate between who got to pick the lunch spot for the day. There was this one building, skyscraper, I think downtown Atlanta, maybe Peachtree area, not sure. But inside was a wonderful deli. I believe it was called Gordons. I can't remember for sure.

  
But each week his route landed us there he knew I was going to pick that place. My father has since passed. I am visiting my brother. I am oh-so-curious if that deli still exists.

  
I often travel in my brain to those beautiful lunches. The sandwiches. We'd sit in the cafeteria area/dining area. It was surreal as a little kid.

1jienol,https://www.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/1jienol/lovely_goat_farm_coffee_house_forney_tx/,"Lovely Goat Farm Coffee House @ Forney, Tx.","My wife saw a TikTok about a farm that was more like a petting zoo. My son absolutely loves petting zoos and we were looking for things to do. So we drove the 50 mins to Forney, Tx to visit the place.

At first things were a little strange. There was a huge waiting line, and my wife is not know to be a patient woman. But the drive had been long, we were not going back without petting a goat. So, we got in line, that’s when the strange things started.

The owner was explaining how the shop operated to the family right in front of me. I didn’t hear the whole story, but at least I became aware that line was unusual. It turns out they posted a TikTok earlier that week that “exploded” (owners word, not mine) and now they had a huge number of visitors. Hey, good for him! Then he handed out membership paperwork. Membership paperwork for a coffee shop with a petting zoo. What shenanigans are these!?!?!

Well, I was about to find out as it was my turn to know about the secrets of this place. The owner is very kind man, and I say that even after he told me he was not going to be able to pronounce my name. Come on, it’s not even that difficult. But anyway. He lives in the house, and he strongly believes in the US Constitution and the right to organize. So, the shop and the farm operated on a membership basis. Membership was $20 for a lifetime family membership. My mind briefly thought “this is BS”, but then again we’ve driven from afar and my child wanted so badly to pet a goat.

Let’s review those membership conditions!

Long story short, the first two paragraphs were batshit crazy IMO. They made no sense to me for a coffee shop and a petting zoo. I showed them to my wife. She didn’t even understood that those papers were about the farms She looked at me and said “I don’t get a thing…”

Again, we had driven too long, we were gonna get inside that farm.

And I am happy we did. I may had concealed that “the US Constitution is one of the best documents ever devised by man” which it might be, I just have no way to know as a foreign national staying on a working visa.

Anyhow, this post is already too long. I’m just going to say the visit was worth it. The staff, which I assume are all family were so kind. The cookies, brownies and fudge: amazingly delicious. I cannot state that enough: the bakery is amazing on that place! And of course the goats, my son loved feeding them. The owner came back from the front and held a baby goat for the kids to pet. My son was so happy! And now we are all member for life. I hope we can go back sometime and if my GC request is granted I promise I will have read the US Constitution entirely then.

*   **Pros:** Reliable,familiar,always a crowd-pleaser. Great for those who want a faithful reproduction.
*   **Cons:** Lacks originality; doesn't offer anything new. Risks feeling stale if overused.

**#4: The Acoustic Rendition**

Picture Dean sitting alone in the Impala, reflecting on past losses as a single acoustic guitar plays in the background before the ""Road So Far"" montage begins.

*   **Cons:** Logistically challenging to execute. Requires a dedicated team to coordinate and curate submissions. Production challenges would be immense.**Beyond the Music: The Visuals That Matter**

Ideally, the montage should follow a narrative arc, building towards a climax that mirrors the song's emotional intensity. It should also incorporate fan-favorite moments and iconic imagery that will resonate with the Supernatural community.

**Conclusion: Carry On Wayward Son Lives On**

""Carry On My Wayward Son"" is more than just a song; it's an anthem, a symbol, and a constant reminder of the Winchesters' epic journey. It is indeed a cornerstone of the Supernatural universe.

1jiem4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jiem4i/i_stopped_in_a_town_and_found_everything_except/,I stopped in a town and found everything... except the people.,"I wasn’t supposed to be here. 

A detour, a missed exit, and my phone’s GPS throwing a tantrum had landed me in this little speck of a town. Just a few hours off course, I told myself. Besides, a small town diner’s greasy breakfast sounded more appealing than another gas station sandwich.

The sign read “Welcome to Willowbrook.” It had that quaint, old-fashioned charm, the kind you’d see in picture books about Americana—white picket fences, red-bricked sidewalks, and charming little shops with hand-painted signs.

The problem was, no one was there.

Not a single car on the street, no strollers or pedestrians. It was as if the whole town had decided to sleep in late. I parked by a coffee shop called Brew & Biscuits. Its windows were clean, polished even. But inside, the lights were off.

I pushed open the door, and it chimed with a cheerful jingle that seemed too loud against the town’s dead silence. Inside, everything was perfectly intact. Croissants lay arranged under a glass case, a pot of coffee still warm on the counter.

“Hello?” I called. My voice sounded so small. Nothing but my own echo replied.

I wandered through the town, my footsteps sounding too sharp against the deserted sidewalks. The supermarket’s automatic doors swished open as I approached. Its shelves were fully stocked, carts lined neatly at the entrance. But no customers. No cashiers.

It was like walking through a dollhouse frozen mid-play. Plates of half-eaten food sat on tables at a diner. Cars remained parked with doors left slightly ajar, the keys still in their ignitions. A baseball game paused mid-play in the park, the bat resting abandoned on the ground.

I called out a few more times, my voice growing weaker with each attempt. There was no sign of panic or struggle. Just… absence.

I should have left. Gotten back in my car and sped away until my tires hit familiar roads. But curiosity had its claws in me, dragging me deeper into this unsettling stillness.

I wandered into a house at the end of Harper Street. The door was unlocked, creaking as I pushed it open. Inside, family photos lined the walls, all smiles and summer vacations. The kitchen table was set for dinner, plates of steaming food that hadn’t cooled. I reached out to touch a roast potato; it was still warm.

How could this be possible?

I moved from house to house, shop to shop. Every place was the same. Lived in, but vacant. As if everyone had left in the middle of living.

By the time the sun began to dip below the horizon, I had circled back to my car. But something made me hesitate. A shape in the distance, near the center of town.

I squinted and saw it was a phone booth. Bright red, sticking out like a clown’s nose against the sleepy pastels of Willowbrook’s storefronts. I hadn’t noticed it earlier.

When I reached it, the door hung slightly ajar. A low, crackling sound seeped from the receiver dangling from its cord. Against all reason, I picked it up.

At first, there was nothing but static. And then, a voice.

“Why are you here?” it whispered.

-Scrubs, scrub caps

- Lab Coats: Required for many labs

- Nitrile gloves, OB gloves, plastic aprons, boot covers : Anatomy lab is disgusting 

- Rubber boots: Nice for rainy days, wet labs, and anatomy

- Hair ties (for long hair)

- A comfy pair of shoes: you may be standing a lot

- large Whiteboard and Markers: Extremely helpful for studying 

- Pen Light

- Dissection Kit

- Reflex Hammer

- Lunch box (especially if you don’t have the ability to go home for lunch)

- Water bottle and coffee cup- Stay hydrated and awake

- Backpack snacks: good for when you are stuck in class and get hangry

- Budget

- Planner

- Good quality backpack: you might be living out of it sometimes

- Support : not something you can pack, but it is key to success. Find anyone who you can talk to on hard days. 

- Padlock: many schools have lockers and while most vet students are trust worthy, any visitors may not be so lock up your stuff

-A flexible attitude: I was a straight A student in undergrad, I am not in Vet school. It is a learning curve but getting used to that idea now will make school much more bearable. I have had to change study strategies and more in vet school and I’m realizing it’s okay. I am learning even if I’m not acing every exam.

I dated my ex for five years, we broke up because we were young and immature (18yo). We broke up because I left him after I felt he started losing interest in me and I lost control over him. I will admit I treated him like a dog, I wanted him all the time, I wanted to be married I wanted to be put first above everyone. His family lived far away and he would often go see them. I would get upset when he left to see them. This grew resentment between us both, and eventually I let him go and he let me go. I wasn’t a good person then and have changed since then. I am a much better partner now. 

He called me everyday for a year after we broke up, he would go to bars calling my name. I knew I was a toxic person and wanted to work on myself. I had a shit situation at home and so I started dating a guy I knew I’d never be with and just slept around with. I fell in love with the new guy. I didn’t answer any of his calls. 

Three years later, I started answering his calls and he asked me to leave him, I told him I’ll always love him and that he was my person. He will always have a special place in my heart. I told my partner about him and our talks. My ex wanted to see me couple times and I saw him, we would go for coffees. It was nice because I could always share everything with him without him judging me or having the worry he was my partner. He knew all of me and loved me always. He would tell me about girls but I always knew he never would fall in love with them like he did me. 

My partner recently betrayed me. This led me to work deeper on myself. I wanted to forgive my partner as I couldn’t forgive my ex.

My mom is dying and hates my partner. She told me never marry him and only marry my ex. 

Now, from my ex’s voice- I can tell he is pursuing a girl he has found. I am so happy for him. He deserves to be happy. A part of me is sad though because now that we are older, this girl will get the wedding and life I always wanted from him within one year. I waited five years for him to marry me before I left him.

I am not even close to marrying my partner because my family dislikes him, and because he betrayed me. I feel at a loss, but I don’t wanna be sad for him. I want to love him enough to be the person that’s genuinely happy for him but I spent the day crying. 

I know it is likely they may not work out, but I don’t wanna pray for that for him for my own selfish reasons. I want to pray it does work out for him.

I’m scared I may have lost the love of my life but if it was meant to be it would’ve been. I don’t know what to do. Sorry for the rant. ",0,1742777226.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False
1jiekyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1jiekyz/simple_shifts_when_struggling/,Simple shifts when struggling,"Hi all! First time caller, long time listener :)

I have had success with the law in the past, even before I knew about Neville Goddard or the law of assumption specifically. I have definitely seen it “work” in my life in ways that feel like magic. But like anyone, my attention to the 3D world and my self concept shift and vary and I’m finding myself in a time where I’m struggling to see results. 

I recently went through a break-up (that was DEFINITELY a reflection of my inner world and self talk) and it was quite demoralizing. I immediately began trying to manifest back my ex (probably far too soon without doing the proper work and healing) and I hit a wall. I’ve since gone back to focusing on myself and my self concept, but I’ve found the whole experience seems to have shaken my confidence? I’m trying to manifest even small things, like a free cup of coffee or a bouquet of flowers, and seeing no results in the 3D. I am trying to persist, remind myself that I am the operant power, etc, etc— and I know I am, because I have seen my power before! But I’m having trouble getting out of the rut I seem to have found myself in. 

Does anyone have any exercises that help them get back into the receiving mode when they’ve stalled out? Any statements or affirmations that work as a paradigm shift? Or things I can manifest easily that will rebuild my belief?

I know I’m probably working against myself by even giving this “block” any attention, but something is definitely out of alignment that I can’t seem to correct on my own. I have come a long way from the pain of the relationship ending a few months ago and I’m doing the things that have worked for me before, but I just can’t seem to get my mojo back. Even the amount of synchronicity in my life seems to have ground to a halt.

Seven years later, I was sitting in the driver's seat of my beat up Ford pickup, dressed in my only nice suit, with an untouched bag of fast food in my lap. Jack sat in the passenger seat, wearing the suit we had picked out for Granny’s funeral, which had already warranted another use.



Granny had died of emphysema, and Papaw followed her soon after. Died of a broken heart they said, and I supposed that was true, though I was pretty sure it was the cholesterol that got him.



He’d worked himself to the grave, dropping down suddenly at the lumber yard. Pronounced dead at the hospital. I’d been working there alongside him when it happened. I’d gone through all the paperwork at the hospital, settled his estate, signed for custody of Jack, planned the funeral, and spoke my piece beside our family cemetery plot. My mother, my grandmother, my grandfather, and all the distant relatives I’d never had the chance to meet - lined up in a neat row - with a space beside them for me.



And now I was sitting in my truck beside Jack, staring out at the empty parking lot in front of us, while he ate. I was trying to be there for him, but I didn’t know how. I just kept replaying Papaw’s death in my head. His face screwed up, clutching his chest, collapsing to one knee, then the ground. The unfamiliarity of his body in the harsh light of the morgue, the wrongness, like a bird ripped from the skies and sprawled out on some stainless steel slab to be dissected. Bleach and ammonia all over again.



It hadn’t really settled in yet. I still felt numb.



Thankfully, Jack was never starved for conversation. He could talk his own ear off. And if he noticed my distance, it only encouraged him to try to snap me out of it.



“Di’ja know-” he said unprompted between fistfulls of frenchfries, “-that some animals, like deer and rats, eat bones? Well, chew on ‘em anyways. Even dinosaur bones have teeth marks in ‘em.”



I rubbed my eye with the heel of my palm and looked over toward him. “No, I didn’t. Ya learn that in class?”



“Nah.” He shook his head theatrically side to side. “This book I got from the library.”



“Wow, yer a real nerd, ya know that?”



“Aw, shut up,” he laughed, scrunching up his nose. “Also, also- birds and bats have hollow bones. Can you imagine that? Hollow bones?”



“What’s all this interest in bones?”



“I’m goin’ to be a paleontologist,” he said confidently through a mouthful of chicken.



“Oh yeah?”



“Yeah.”



“Well ya know how guys grow up to be paleontologists?” I asked, leaning in conspiratorially.



“How?” He sat up straighter, eagerly, eyes all lit up.



“They start by chewin’ with their mouths closed.”



Jack huffed, slouching back down in his chair. “Fuck you.”



“Watch yer language,” I laughed, shifting the truck into gear and pulling out of the parking lot. “You’ll have Papaw turnin’ in his grave already.”



Besides his somewhat morbid interests, Jack seemed to be taking it all surprisingly well. Most kids in his place would have been acting out. Picking fights, wetting the bed, being little traumatized delinquents.



But Jack had never been remotely mean spirited, and seemed mostly unaffected by their deaths. He was sad, sure, but he didn’t dwell on it much. He certainly didn’t go nonverbal the way I had. He must have taken after Papaw.



The moment I pulled into our driveway, Jack was bolting out the passenger door to grab his dirt bike from the garage.



“No way, not in that suit,” I said, locking the truck.



“C’mon,” he groaned.



“No, quit foolin’. Just change yer clothes first.”



“Fine.”



I unlocked the front door and he kicked off his dress shoes, grabbing his mud stained tennis ones before racing to his bedroom, which used to be mine. He stumbled back out a second later in our mom’s old sweatshirt. And for a split second, I was my grandfather, watching my childhood self. I closed my eyes and forced away the weird sense of melancholy.



I’d given the sweatshirt to Jack years ago. It had long ago lost that smell, and the Marine insignia was peeling and faded away. Besides, I’d lost faith in the message. I had nothing against the military per se, it was just obnoxiously simplistic and hopeful messages like that rubbed me the wrong way. Like a therapy office’s wall art or an AA mantra.



“You goin’ to hang out with ‘em boys down the road?” I asked, following Jack to the door.



“Yeah.”



“What were their names again?”



“Noah, Sammy, and AJ. I told ya before.”



“Yeah, well, I mean, I should prob’ly have their parents’ numbers, right?”



Jack scoffed at me with a crooked-toothed smile, rolling his eyes, already walking his bike toward the road.



“Fine, but ya only have so much daylight left!” I shouted after him.



“I know, I know, be back before dark.”



“Long before dark. And remember- don’t play by the riverbed down there, ‘cause-”



“-’cause the kudzu will get me!” he laughed, pedaling quickly out of sight.



I scoffed to the empty air.



Yeah, sure, Jack was a sweet kid. But he was a handful all the same.



I could appreciate that I’d been much the same at his age, always wandering off and pushing my luck. But at least I’d been gullible. My brother was too damn smart for his own good. I could tell him all the tall tales our grandparents had told me. The ones that kept me up at night, jumping at the call of any passing coyote or barred owl. The ones that had me running up from the cellar two steps at a time. And he’d just laugh them off as silly campfire stories. It was hard to instill any sense of danger in him.



I turned back into the empty house, undoing my tie and peeling off my suit jacket, trying to shed the memory of the funeral. I walked toward my room, which had once been our mom’s. Our grandparents’ room was still untouched. I wasn’t sure what to do with it yet. Whether to pack up their clothes, the old pill bottles, the newspapers, the guitar - or to leave it as a sort of memorial. I couldn’t handle the thought of shoving their lives into boxes down in the cellar, the way most of Mom’s things were. I’d already been through one burial today.



I passed the open door to Jack’s room on the way. He’d left his suit crumpled on the floor. I stepped inside to hang it up in his closet. Then I straightened the dinosaur patterned counterpane Granny had quilted for him, rearranging the stuffed animals on top, and sat down. The moment I did, I realized just how overwhelmed I was. Had the funeral really only been that morning? Felt like days ago. I tried to force myself to take a breath, relax a bit, just focus on the room around me.



Posters of video game zombies, flyers on animal tracks from the state park, and magazine cut outs of rock bands I’d been into years ago coated the walls. A model spaceship hung from a ceiling littered with glow stars. Chapter books, wilderness survival guides, and comics cluttered a small bookshelf. Antler sheds we’d found last spring were displayed haphazardly on top of his bureau next to a little league trophy and my high school diploma. Superhero action figures and half-finished construx projects had been shoved mostly under the bed. A string of lights were poorly taped around the window. Beneath it, a collection of dried flowers, rocks, feathers, small animal bones, and half dissected owl pellets (which I was too disgusted with to even bother cleaning up) were scattered around his desk next to a portable radio and crayon drawings of what was probably supposed to be bigfoot.



It was a melting pot of leftovers from my own childhood, constantly rearranged and adapted over the years to suit him. It gave me a strange sense of pride and loss. And a sudden shapeless paternal instinct. We were all we had left in the world now. I didn’t want that to trouble Jack, but for me, it was almost comforting. The newfound sense of responsibility made my life feel a bit less aimless. 



So, naturally, when the sun had set and it was near pitch dark outside, and Jack still wasn’t back, I was pissed.



I turned on the porch light and sat out there waiting for him. I kept checking my watch, wondering how late I would let it get before going after him myself. Part of me felt ridiculous doing it. I wasn’t even twenty yet, and here I was donning the disappointed parent act, waiting out in the late summer breeze like a worried mother. But it wasn’t like I could just go to sleep with my elementary school brother out wandering the neighborhood. I hoped he was at a friend's house or biking back down the road. I kept imagining him lost or hurt or alone in the woods. My knee bounced anxiously. I checked my watch again. Barely two minutes had passed.



I thought about bringing a book or something out with me, but I was too distracted. I kept staring out into space, lost in thought. I came to and realized I’d spent the last few minutes staring at a tree at the edge of where our yard met the road. In the dusky light, I could just make out the shape of a young pine.



I quickly blinked and looked away, down at my hands. I had learned my lesson as a kid. I didn’t look out windows into the woods at night. I didn’t stare into treelines. I was old enough now to know those were just stories, and old enough still to know there was truth in every story. Why test fate?



But the moment I looked away from the tree, I had the sudden feeling I was being watched. In my imagination, something was prowling its way across the yard toward me, and my refusal to look would be the death of me. If anything’s there, it’s just an animal, I reasoned. But a wild animal is nothing to scoff at either.



The feeling grew stronger. Something was definitely off. I tried to distract myself by checking my watch, but I couldn’t get my eyes to focus on the little mechanical hands. I risked a quick glance back at the tree. The glance turned into a lingering stare. It was just the silhouette of a tree, nothing special. But I was hypnotized by it. The pine was prominent, standing out starkly from the others, like a soldier leading its company into the battlefield. I had the unshakable certainty that there was something *wrong* with it. Something I couldn’t explain. Was it too tall? Too short? Were the branches too long? Too tangled? Were the needles still against the breeze?



No. No, it was a perfectly normal tree.



I looked around the rest of the yard. The light of the porch didn’t reach far, and I couldn’t see much else in the starlight. But nothing was amiss. The draw to look back at the tree was unmistakable now though. Like an itch I had to scratch. Like an ancient prey fear. Like something very, very bad would happen unless I kept my attention on it-



“Elijah?”



I nearly jumped out of my skin.



Jack’s laughter followed. I turned to see him walking his bike up the road toward the garage. His legs were covered with mud, there were new scrapes on his arms, and the slight sunburn he’d worn all summer had brought out a constellation of freckles across his face. His previously combed hair was all mussed up - it was a deep brown color, like tree bark, and wavy from the hard water - the perfect imitation of a bird’s nest.



“What are ya doin’ out here?”



“What am *I* doin’ out here?” I called over, standing up from my chair, my fear replaced with anger. “Where have you been?”



“I told ya.”



“Yeah, and I told ya to be back before dark, didn’t I?”



He closed the garage door and walked around toward the porch to face me, still perfectly unbothered. “I’m sorry. I’m only like thirty minutes late.”



“An hour.”



“An hour then.”



“Yeah, well, no TV tonight.”



“Aw, what?” Jack whined, like I was being unfair.



“What di’ja expect, kid?”



“Fine,” he sighed. “Were ya that worried? Di’ja think the kudzu got me?” he teased, opening the front door.



“Something like that,” I muttered, following behind him with one last look toward the pine tree. Its branches waved lazily, its needles rustled peacefully, and its eyes beat into my back the moment I turned.



The next morning, I was woken up early by Jack banging my door open and jumping onto the bed beside me.



“No,” I groaned, too sleep deprived for an eloquent protest. I pulled the dark bedspread over my head and turned away. “Not ‘til nine.”



“It’s already past nine! S’not my fault yer always tired. It’s like ya never stopped bein’ a teenager.”



“Some of us have to work.”



“Loser,” he said, trying to pull the covers from over my head.



I tore them back before the creeping sunlight could wake me up fully. “Don’t test yer luck. I could have ya in the mines by now if I wanted.”



“Nah, that’s illegal!”



“Who says they care? They could use a little guy like you to crawl through all the dogholes. Might could make good money that way, now that I think about it.”



“Elijah, c’mon already, I’m hungry.”



“Make yerself breakfast then.”



“Ya said I can’t use the stove without ya.”



“Cereal don’t require a stove.”



“I want to make pancakes.”



“Yer gettin’ spoiled.”



“It’s a special occasion.”



“Yeah? What’s that?”



“Sunday.”



“Since when is Sunday an occasion?”



“For Jesus.”



“We haven’t been to church in years.”



“Exactly! Least we could do is make pancakes for His sake.”



“Reckon that’s a bit sacrilegious.”



“Sacri-what?”



I groaned, finally sitting up and wiping the sleep from my eyes. “Know what? Fine. Fine. I’m awake. Go get the stuff ready. I’ll be out in a second.”



“Yes!” Jack shouted triumphantly, far too loud for early morning, and rushed back out the door. I could hear his loud footsteps beating the floorboards, followed by the crashing of cabinets being thrown open.



I grimaced, cracking my joints, and forced myself to throw on a shirt and follow him into the kitchen.



I made myself some coffee and Jack insisted on having some too, so I poured a splash of decaf into a mug of mostly milk. He wanted to act grown, but I didn’t need him hyper and sick. When he’d wolfed down too many pancakes to count, and I’d had a few cups of coffee, we decided to go on a walk down one of the forest footpaths. I pulled on my work boots, waiting for Jack to finish getting ready and come out of his room.



“C’mon, Jackalope!” I shouted down the hall. “Doesn’t take that long to get dressed.”



“One second!”



When he came back out, proudly showing off his outfit, I had to force a smile. His clothes were getting ratty. The material of his shorts had thinned from being through the washer one too many times, a small hole torn in the side, seams beginning to pop along the hem. And his t-shirt was a size too small, leftover from last summer. Jack never complained, but I’d wanted to do better by him. I’d wanted him to have more than hand-me-downs and church drive clothes.



I’d been working since I was his age. Helping out neighbors until I was old enough to start clocking in at a real job. I hadn’t bought myself new clothes since I stopped growing. And all that would’ve felt worthwhile, if I could’ve given Jack a better opportunity. We could joke about it all we wanted, but the way things were going, he probably *would* have to start working soon too. The thought of his spare cash from lemonade stands and lawn-mowing going to our utility bill made me sick.



Jack gestured to himself again, leaning his head in, looking for a better reaction. I realized he had a hip pouch fastened to his belt on one side, and a small hunting knife sheathed on the other. Papaw had given it to him for his birthday, on the condition he only ever use it as a tool or for self-defense. Taught him how to use it properly and everything. If he’d been around for Jack’s tenth birthday, he’d have given him the gun safety lecture next.



We had an antique flintlock displayed above the fireboard in the living room and a few hunting rifles in the garage. But I hadn’t touched any of them in years. I’d gone hunting plenty of times with my grandfather, but I never cared for it. It was boring, sitting for hours in an uncomfortable position, trying not to make a sound. And all you got out of it was a carcass or two. Seemed unfair compensation to me.



Jack would probably like it though. I wondered if one of our neighbors would take him on a trip with them. At the very least, he should still learn how to use a gun eventually. Not that I’d trust him with one anytime soon.



“What do ya need ‘em for?” I grinned, gesturing to the pouch and knife on his belt. “Or is it just to look cool?”



“Ya think it looks cool?”



“Eh,” I joked, tilting my hand side to side.



“Aw, whatever, it’s for my fieldwork,” he explained, stepping out onto the porch.



“Ya tryin’ out for the boy scouts or something?”



“Pfft, boy scouts couldn’t learn me nothin’ I don’t already know.”



“Oh, is that so?”



I was following him down the steps, when something caught my eye and made me falter. Or, rather, the lack of something caught my eye.



There was no pine tree.



I scanned the patch of trees where the yard met the road again and again. There was no way I was missing it in the broad daylight. Sure, there were pines, blending in with all the hickory and sugar trees, but *that* pine- it simply wasn’t there.



“Hurry up!” Jack called, already many paces ahead, waving me over into the woods. 



“Coming!” I shouted back.



I shook my head and jogged over to him.



Yesterday had been a long, rough day. It wasn’t that surprising I’d gotten all paranoid. I could’ve mixed up all sorts of things in the dark.



Jack led the way down the footpath, from landmark to landmark.



We knew the forest around our property like the back of our hands. The crumbling stone fence, the massive downed tree covered in moss and perfect for climbing, the creeks you could only cross by jumping from rock to rock. The abandoned hunting shelter where I used to sneak beers with my friends. I had my first kiss there when I was fourteen with one of the neighborhood girls. I cringed a bit at the memory. Nothing says romance like a small platform littered with weed ash and old sports magazines. Of course, once I outgrew it, I cleaned the place up for Jack and he used it as a treehouse until the wooden ladder rotted through. Practically every night when I was in high school, our grandparents would force me to go out and drag him back inside for supper. It was funny remembering the way I acted back then. Bitching and dragging my feet, swearing up at him impatiently when he insisted on five more minutes. It was strange to think that had only been a few years ago. I couldn’t imagine talking to him like that now.



Jack paused from time to time, pocketing anything that interested him. He clipped off plant cuttings with his knife to try to replant later, caught spring peepers and katydids in mason jars, and tried to identify the different types of birds fluttering above us.



The whole time, I couldn’t get a word in edgewise, which was fine by me.



“Look at this huge toad! Don’t worry, it doesn’t cause warts, that’s a myth. It’s the pickerels ya really gotta watch out for. Oh, no, don’t touch it though. Still a bit poisonous, ya know?”



“Have ya ever seen a wolf spider? I think they look awesome. I’d keep one as a pet if they didn’t bite so much. Sammy says he got bit by a brown recluse when he was grabbin’ firewood once, but I know he’s lyin’. He’d be dead if it were true.”



“I wish we had more paper birch trees around here. They’re all higher up the mountain. That’d make great kindling though. I wonder if I could get a fire goin’ with some pine sap as a starter. Can I try? …aw, I thought ya’d say as much. Yer no fun.”



“Ya know, ever’body says to follow the streams if ya get lost in the woods, but that doesn’t really work here. They lead all o’er the place. But you can use the moss and the sun to orient yerself. Or power lines if yer lucky. And if you can find a ridge, that’ll lead ya to a trail, that’s what Noah’s dad says.”



While he talked, I looked up into the branches. As I walked past, it gave the illusion that I was standing perfectly still, and the trees were dancing in lazy pirouettes around me. It was actually starting to make me a bit nauseous. I decided on focusing on the ground in front of my feet instead.



Jack found a deer trail and insisted on following it a ways, excited to point out the tracks, droppings, and chewed up twigs along the way. But I wasn’t keen on straying too far from the footpath. The deer trails were fairly trustworthy, but as the woods grew denser, I felt more uneasy. Like the air had turned sour.



Suddenly all the noise Jack was making was no longer endearing. It felt like it was telegraphing our location to everything in a few miles’ radius. I instantly became aware of the sound of my own breathing. The undergrowth crackled beneath my shoes and I winced.



Then it hit me. We weren’t making more noise than before. Everything else was quieter than before.



City people will tell you there’s nothing scarier than hearing a sound in the woods. But anyone who’s grown up here will tell you they’re dead wrong. There’s nothing scarier than not hearing any sound in the woods at all. If the animals know to avoid a place, then you best not linger there either.



I looked up, scanning the trees around us. I couldn’t see anything out of place. I tried to tell myself I was being overdramatic. But I felt twelve-years-old all over again.



“Woah, that’s weird,” Jack said suddenly.



“What’s up?” I turned to see him crouching over something on the forest floor.



“Look.”



I stepped closer. There were the same scattered deer tracks stamped in the dirt that we’d been following for the last five minutes. I looked up a bit further where Jack was pointing.



There was a human footprint.



Not a bootprint. A bare footprint. It looked fresh too, from what I could tell. The person’s tracks continued on, deeper down the deertrail, but the deer’s tracks had just ended. It didn’t make any sense. I instinctively looked down that direction deeper into the woods, but I couldn’t see anyone.



Jack was looking up at me, trying to read my reaction, as if expecting me to have an explanation. I tried to school my expression. I didn’t want to look frightened in front of him. He worried his lip and looked back down at the footprint.



“I don’t think we’re welcome here,” he said softly.



Before I could ask him what he meant by that, we heard the whistle.



A quick, shrill sound, but unmistakably human. I’d only heard it a few times in my life. Granny always said if it sounded close by, that meant it was actually far away. If it sounded far away, it was right beside you. This whistle? It sounded like it was coming from only a few yards away, down where the footprints led.



“I’m getting tired, Jackalope,” I said, smiling down at Jack, who was frozen in place. I begged internally for him not to mention the whistle. “Do ya want to head back and heat up dinner? See what’s on TV?”



Jack knit his eyebrows, with a look I couldn’t quite read. I hoped it was just concern. But it seemed much more like confusion, or worse judgement, like he thought I was being ridiculous. If he forgot the rules in the heat of the moment, or decided to ignore them, there was little I could do to stop him. He started to open his mouth, gesturing insistently toward the footprints. I glared at him sharply. Jack’s mouth fell shut. He chewed his lip for a moment, looking curiously off into the trees, then huffed a sigh and nodded to me.



I let out a grateful breath. “Alright, let’s go.”



I held out my hand. He was a bit too old for it, but Jack held my hand the whole way back to the footpath, letting me lead him. The stillness followed after us like a vacuum, sucking the life out of the surrounding nature. Like we’d stepped into a photograph. A pinned butterfly, perfectly preserved as it was in life, but dead all the same. The only sound came from our own footsteps, but the rhythm of it was off. I looked down at our feet, watching them stagger tactlessly over dry twigs and pine cones, but it was wrong. There was more noise than we could possibly be making, like a third set of footsteps directly behind us. I refused to turn to look.



A cool breeze ghosted across the back of my neck, my skin tightening painfully as my hair stood on end. But every last leaf on the trees was still. I screwed my eyes shut, clenching my teeth with the effort it took not to whirl around, and trudged forward.



I could tell Jack was nervous, but he didn’t seem to understand why. He was scared because I was scared. Did he think I had killed his fun with my superstitions? Or was he as unnerved as I was, and because there was no one else around to blame, taking it out on me? Either way, Jack dragged his feet with a resentful reluctance, purposely slowing us down. I wanted to yank him by the arm. I wanted to shout at him to take this more seriously. But that wasn’t how it worked. So instead, I made small talk the whole way, keeping the conversation upbeat, even as he had been reduced to one word answers.



The moment we left the deertrail, the bird song started up again. The whish of branches in the humid wind. The croak of frogs in the babble of a far off creek. My paranoia lifted like a shadow cut from my ankles, and I finally risked turning around. We were alone.



I heard the snapping sound of a buckle and looked over to see Jack sheathing his knife. I hadn’t even realized he’d had it out.



Once the house was in sight I took in a breath of relief, my heartbeat finally slowing back to a steady thrum, but I still didn’t fully lower my guard until we were safely inside.



“You did good,” I told him, refusing to elaborate further, as I locked the door behind us.



Jack just sniffed, wiping his nose on his sleeve, not meeting my eyes.



“I’m- I’m gonna put all the stuff I got back in my room.”



“Okay. You want some glasses of water for the plant cuttings?”



“Nah. I’m just gonna read for a while if that’s alright?”



“Yeah. Yeah, of course. Oh, and make sure to check yerself for ticks.”



“I will.”



Jack holed himself up in his bedroom, and I grabbed a beer from the fridge to calm my nerves. I heard his radio crackle on from across the house. Papaw’s favorite station - Sitting On Top Of The World and Wildwood Flower drifting through the rooms. I let myself relax into the familiar comfort of it. 



There was something in the mountains.



Likely many things. They had been here long before humans stumbled their way onto the land, and they would be here long after we were nothing but bone marrow and dust. You didn’t have to spend much time in the forest to be certain of it. But whatever they were, nothing kept them away like music. I was certain that’s why folk music had always been so universal. Why Papaw played his guitar on the porch every evening like a guardian angel keeping watch over his homestead.



I sat in the kitchen for a while and sang along under my breath, like reciting a prayer. I could only hope Jesus was listening.",1,1742776947.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

1jiegg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jiegg4/finally_got_a_date/,Finally got a date,"Hi guys M24 here. Finally got a date after a really long while…So I had some questions. Its a girl I haven’t seen in a long time prob 6years or close to that. We had math together and went to the same school but I never really spoke to her idk why. Always found her very attractive and beautiful and found her profile recently and decided to message her…I asked her if she would like to go out for a coffee sometime…She didn’t answer directly only read it. 2 days later she answered with a voice message meanwhile I forgot about it because I thought she didn’t care…She said it was a bit unexpected. She also said she saw someone from our school and if I would like for us all to meet or If I would like for us to meet privately so I of course said that only the two of us should meet…I told her a date about a week later and she said she is working but we will meet an hour later after she is done and we will drink something downtown…

So my questions were…Apart from knowing her name and nationality and age I don’t really know anything else about her so what do I ask her how do I talk to her?

Also does she know its a date because I didn’t really tell her its a date just asked her to drink some coffee so does she think it’s a date or just a quick meet up? 

I know girls don’t like it when guys are too open and say everything on the first date but what else should I talk to her about? After all I don’t know stuff about her…How do I know I am not oversharing? 

And lets say the date goes well…Do I just wait for her to say she has to go or how do I end the date exactly? 

And she still hasn’t accepted my friend request…maybe she hasn’t seen it?

And since she responded 2 days later I thought that she was questioning what to say…and asked me if I wanted to meet up with another one of our classmates or just the two of us to know If its a friendly meet up or a date…but my cousin who is 20 said girls don’t overthink so much and are not so complicated which is crazy because I know girls who do so is this accurate or rather not?",1,1742776831.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1jiecyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1jiecyo/finding_grace/,Finding Grace,"Looking out into the bustling street in front of her, just as the morning’s sun was making its way into a new day. A new day for her! For everything seemed new Grace’ 

A green eyed brown haired girl setting there gripping the handle bars on her bike, for the street just in front of her was long all downhill race for her.

Not really knowing how or why she was here, in a way that something felt different about her. Different in a way that no one could describe, she only knew where she was at the moment!only knowing the moment! 

For this morning was hers, nothing was going to stop her from breaking her prior tries before. Taking one last look around her, just before letting it all go! 

Even though all of this still felt very new to her! The surroundings! The people! Everything thing about the place. But while everything seemed new to her! It still felt like she belonged here! That she had always been here.

Grace was a young outgoing girl just shy of her 26 birthday growing up in a small town with a big city feel to her. But to Grace it was her home but she liked to think of it as a sprawling city that she would ride her bike through towns streets. 

Weaving in and out of cars passing by them feeling free from the world around her feeling the wind blowing wildly through her long brown hair. Racing as the excitement showed in her smile saying it all. Making her through the towns traffic passing by people with some waving as she passed by.

With Grace having the feeling of nothing could stop her from trying her best to break her speed time Pryor to each day.  Often finding herself at the other end of the local law enforcement, as officer Cross’ would many times say to her

“Grace! Now don’t make me write you a ticket today for speeding!” 

As he would always say laughingly to her. mainly it was just them watching out for her own safety.  For Grace was just your typical young green eyed girl who liked her shredded jeans tee shirt and hoodie living her life her way. 

Occasionally finding some of the local boys racing with her trying to out do one another. With Grace being the girl that she was never backing down from a challenge, found herself racing through the streets along with one or two others.

Not to say that one didn’t catch her eye from time to time his name was Hector’ Hector was a guy that charm on a dime. A Latino Who had a keen mind and the street smarts to match especially on a bike. Often calling out to Grace saying 

“So you think you’re fast huh! Well maybe we can just find out just how fast you can go!”

But at the same time finding himself racing along side of Grace’ whether it be on the streets or on one of many mountain trails that surrounded them.

Knowing that each had feelings for the other, but never really acting on it,

Knowing that Grace was a well to do girl, often finding himself with Grace leaving him with a glance and a smile as Grace left him looking. 

Just way the way he liked it! Always watching out for her.

While Grace’ didn’t have many people in her life or let many get close to her, Hector was different! 

Leaving everyone she met with a smile she was a girl with a slim build standing at around five foot and four inches. Gliding her way through the traffic imagining as if she was racing through the downtown streets of San Francisco. Often finding herself riding her bike for the bike was her life her way of escape. She even had a name for her bike often calling it ‘Quicksilver’ riding her bike faster and farther each day. 

With each day bringing something new to her! A new trial, a new street to ride on, and occasionally a new person.

Finding herself Occasionally stopping by the local bike shop finding herself talking to Jack’ for jack was like a big brother to her. One who also knew himself on a bike, Grace would often find herself talking to listening to Jack tell her all about his days in the big city.

Telling Grace about his own street races, with Grace always enjoying there talks whenever she was in his shop.

For whenever she was on her bike she felt faster than anyone around her and that there was nothing that she could not do on that bike. One street in particular had a steep incline to it for the street itself was not very long but long enough for what Grace needed it be. 

For it gave her enough speed that it felt as if she could go forever dodging in and out of front of cars. As always avoiding the people as she would often came onto the sidewalk bringing a lot of speed passing people as they made their way. 

Sometimes she would dream as if she was riding her bike through the streets of San Francisco or New York. But Life for Grace was here in her hometown it was often just a carefree life. More than often finding herself thinking about her life For oddly enough it just did not feel like it was her life  it felt as if she was living someone else’s life other than her own. 

For many times while riding on one of the many trials outside of town. She would often find herself on a different trail! Leading her to new areas, to new adventures, as if it was showing her thoughts! Thoughts that wasn’t her thoughts! It was as if they belonged to someone else.

It was as if she was seeing things as someone else’s was seeing them! 

But for now life for her was just her and her bike the one possession in her life that she most often cared for the most. Making her way through the streets making her way the local coffee shop where she worked. Often finding herself dreaming of a life being on her own making her  own way in life on her bike.

Just as a regular walked in to set down to enjoy his morning cup of joe. Oddly enough his name was Joe’ an older retired gentleman, A regular that Grace came know from their talks at the coffee shop.

Joe would often tell Grace about his many adventures aboard and local, telling her that even though there were many great locations about. That there was none like our very own town that we had here, for many great nights he had here in the mountains around us when he was younger.

Grace always enjoyed there talks often telling him about her own little adventures in the mountains.

But oddly enough whenever Joe would talk about the town that they were in, that he would say that this is where I wanted to be buried.

That For all of his many travels to many different places, seeing all that he had seen! That in the end that this was his home! This was where he wanted his final resting place to be.

For often Grace would find herself in the mountains just outside of the town riding her bike on some of its many trails one particular. A trial that she would often ride a trial where she was at the moment making her way through it. Gliding past the trees catching glimpses of the sun as its light glimmered through the trees around her.

It was a warm day as she could feel and see the nature of the forest all around her with nothing but blue sky ahead of her. Approaching the place where she would often come. Grace found herself setting there on her bike overlooking a ravine where in the distance she could see the town in which she grew up in. 

She would often refer to it as Angels Ravine, For to anyone standing there could look as if they were looking out into a dream. A Ravine that seemed to go on forever over into the valley ahead. It was almost as if you was an Angel looking out from Heaven itself it was a quit place it was her place. Often finding herself there where she would come to often

But just on the other side of Angels Ravine, was a mountain trail that many bikers dared not to challenge. But not Grace for she knew one day that she would conquer that path, but unknowingly at the time. She would find herself with Hector and others in a challenge that they would never forget.

To relax, to think about her life thinking about her life growing up for she didn’t have any family or many friends. 

Or at least any that she could remember. 

And the few she had, had moved away after High school whether it was for college or just Life itself. But a couple of people who she find herself talking to or occasionally racing against here in the city streets. 

Or on one of the many trails on the outskirts of town, Grace found that life for her was there in the mountains along with her bike.

But as the day grew long with Grace setting there on the ledge looking down into the ravine below Knowing that she should be heading back. For the darkness never really bothered her for she had many times ridden back in the dark under a nights sky. 

For Grace loved riding at night under a starlit sky above her for being alone with nothing but her and stars in the sky. For she knew the area really well and enjoyed its peace that it brought to her but also kept a light on her. that she could attach to the front of her bike as she rode through the trails she could feel nothing but a somber feeling all over her. But as the nights cool breeze blew against her sending feelings of thoughts that would sometimes come over her. 

Thoughts that oddly enough did not feel like her thoughts, thoughts that often would feel like they belonged to someone else’s. Finding herself later that night after arriving back at her apartment the rain had just begun to fall standing there in the rain. Thinking to herself a thought that would often come to her 

“If I am not me then who am I “

A thought that she often would find herself thinking about but always keeping them to herself. While also thinking to herself who else would she tell for oddly enough it seemed that it was just only her. Having no family at least none that she ever knew of it for it had always just been her by herself.

With only the people around her that was already there making her way inside setting down into her cozy little chair. There she would set listening to the rain falling just outside as it came down. Setting there thinking as she would often do about her life then slowly as she would began to fall asleep listening to the rain. Just as a dream would come to her. 

A dream that she would often have a dream that she would often find herself thinking about a lot. Thinking was this her life? But as she dreamed a girl she could see a girl that looked identical to her as if she was her sister her twin but in another Life. 

Always being the same girl but in different places but never where Grace was never in the town that she grew up in. In the dream the girl never acknowledged her or even looked at her as if she was seeing another girls life as if it was her Life. But as the dreams would come they would go,

 Waking up in the chair that she would often find herself fallen asleep in looking out of the window into the suns morning light.

Thinking to herself 

“Why am I seeing this other girl? If I am me then who is she?”

Walking over to the window looking out into a sun filled day, looking at people as they would pass by.

Some she knew, while others being new to the area! Standing there thinking if any of these people could be who they are! Could they be of someone else from somewhere else!

Thinking back on her time here, thinking back on her job, though she remembers working there. But she couldn’t remember when she first started there! It was like she had always been there! Just then realizing that she was late for work. Forgoing the morning shower slipping into her work clothes Grace rushed out of her front door grabbing her bike on the way. knowing that speed was going to be her best friend this morning. 

Making her way through the streets the only way she knew weaving in out of the traffic occasionally hearing the honking of a car horn. throwing their hand up ether by saying a hello or to just watch where you are going. To Grace that was her Life! Being on her bike loose and fast! Racing with the wind blowing up against her making her way through the town. For today was going to be a good day not only at work seeing not only the Locals coming in giving a smile to people from all over. 

People who was either just passing through or in town for the it’s many mountain trails. Finding herself telling passerby’s of many of her own mountain adventures. For after her shift at the coffee house was over Grace herself was then going to head back out to Angels Ravine for Angels Ravine was what Grace would refer to it by.

For it was to her of what Heaven would be like, for it was her own little piece of Heaven. But this time she was not only planning on just a day trip but on spending the night there. Surprisingly as her work day would go much faster than normal having only a few customers here and there. With excitement grabbing her bike leaving her work day behind her headed for the door she couldn’t wait for to her getting there was half the fun. 

Riding her bike out of town it was only a couple of miles down the road to where the trial leading up to Angels Ravine was. It was a warm afternoon as always Grace enjoyed the ride hearing the sounds of nature all around her. With the occasional breeze that would make its way through the trees. normally she would be trying to best her own speed trying to best herself. 

But this time was different this day would be different, for a couple of days back a group of outsiders. A group that Grace had not seen in the area before, a group of young cocky bike riders. Had challenged Grace and Hector to a race, but not just any race a race down the other side of Angels Ravine.

With Grace and Hector arriving at the site first finding themselves setting there looking out over Angels Ravine. Setting there just enjoying the moment together talking about their time in the town together. The times they had racing one another through the streets, coming up here to mountains. 

Setting there on Angel’s Ravine looking out over into the Ravine just ahead of them Grace then turned to Hector asking him

“Do you ever think that you was someone else’s before”

With a puzzled look on Hector’s face he then replied back to her saying 

“Someone Else’s! No! What kind of question is that? Grace are you feeling okay!”

With smiling to him just as she said 

“It’s just! I really don’t know! It’s like I’m or was someone else, I can’t really explain it.”

With Hector giving a laugh as he said to her

“I don’t know what I would do with two Grace’s! All I know is how I feel about the Grace that is here now, setting here beside of me.”

With Grace giving him a smile just she then placed her head his shoulder saying to him

“I don’t know what I would do another me either! I can barely handle myself at times”

With Hector placing his arms around Grace before telling her

“I Don’t think I could handle another you ether laughing, I just know that I am holding the one Grace that I want to be with.”

Giving each other a smile as they set there looking out into what could be there future ahead.

But just before they could get lost in the moment again, the other group had arrived.

They had arrived ready to show their dominance on the mountain, but with Grace and Hector ready eager to show them other wise. 

The challenge was underway with Hector taking the lead first going down the steep incline, quickly followed by the outsiders, with Grace trailing but was soon to catch up. 

The trail was daunting with very steep inclines, as they raced along the mountain trail. But just as Hector was out in front one of the outsiders came up from behind him. Running purposefully close to him knocking him off balance sending him crashing off the trail. 

With Grace then stopping to check as Hector then motioned to her saying to her

“Go! Go get ‘em Grace! You got this!”

And with that it wasn’t too long before Grace had caught up to them, for Grace knew the trails like no other. 

Racing hard and fast to the finish side by side! Just as Grace then a hard look and smile to the outsider as she then pulled away. just the outsider went flying off of the trail! Leaving him setting there as Grace had won the race.

Later that evening Grace and Hector would spend the evening together, talking to each other. Talking about what may be store in the future for them as Hector then slowly looked to Grace just before giving her a kiss.

With Hector then saying goodbye to Grace as he then headed back to town leaving Grace there for the night.

As she came to the ravine Grace then found herself setting down on the ledge looking out over the valley over across the mountains ahead. Thinking to herself that this was Heaven at least what Heaven would be like to her. After setting up her camp for the night setting down again looking out into the sunset as its light shined down onto the valley out into the town below. For many sunrise and sunsets Grace had watched from there. 

But this one was different in a way that she could not describe with only a few words but just looking out into it. It was if time itself was coming to an end. 

Looking back down unto the town as the light of the sun shown down on it Grace began to think to think back on her Life wondering to herself if she had a family out there somewhere. 

Wondering that if she did have a family what would her family be like? What was her childhood like? 

For as far back Grace could remember she had no family. For growing up all she could remember was that one morning she just woke up being in a place with the town and the people around her. But not as her family just people in her life a life that has seemingly went by all too fast. With the sun now slowly setting behind the mountains ahead of her.

Grace set there enjoying it as the last of its light would slowly disappear behind the mountains as the first star of the night would appear over head. Feeling a cool breeze starting to set in as Grace laid there in her sleeping bag looking up into the starlit sky that was adorned above her. laying there just simply enjoying a nice quite night but as sleep would find her. 

The same dream the same dream that Grace had so many times before. With the same girl the girl that Grace would refer to her as her identical sister from what seemed to be from another Life. 

Living her life but not the same as her for everything around her was different, different in the way she lived From the town that she lived in. But this time something happened that had never happened before. A name was said that had never been said before in the dream and that was name of the girl in her dreams someone called her Chloe. 

Suddenly waking up to the morning’s light putting her hands up to her head Grace just set there stunned. Thinking to herself

“Who was this Chloe? And why do I keep seeing her?”

Feeling how real the dream was for her, unlike the others that dream actually seemed as if I was there! I was her! 

Still visibly shaken as Grace looked around suddenly startled by a presence. 

With the presence being of a man standing there just outside of the tree line standing there looking at her. But Just before Grace began to scream a calmness suddenly came over her a feeling of something telling her that everything was alright. Just as the man spoke saying

 “Hello Grace it is a pleasure to meet you so please do not be alarmed. For I am not here to harm you” 

With a feeling of relief coming over Grace, Grace then replied with 

“Then why are you standing there looking at me! And how do you know my name?” 

“I know all about you Grace, I know your entire Life up until now. And I know the answer that you seek” 

With Grace then replying 

“Answers to what? What answers do I seek” 

“ Dreams, Grace your dreams.” 

As Grace just set there still stunned now more curious then ever Grace just suddenly shouted out the girl! Who was the girl in my dreams? 

The man then just smiled and simply said that 

“It is you Grace and it is not you”

More confused then ever Grace just replied by saying 

“Me! How” 

Just as the man then slowly approached Grace standing there looking out into the valley below as he then said to her. 

“ In your Life you was you, and she was her in her Life.”

“But now in this Life you are her and she is and you are not. For the Life that was once you is a Life that is no longer your Life” 

with Grace then replying 

“Is this Heaven then and are you an Angel?” 

With a smile the man just simply said 

“ I am who I am! someone that is there, someone that knows. And no this is not Heaven! This is your Heaven Grace! And this is your Life the Life that you ask for” 

just as the man then slowly made his way back to the tree line. He then turned and said to Grace

 “The dreams shall now end, and your dreams shall begin.” 

“For do not look at what was then, just look at what is now and what is to come for Life itself is the most precious thing that a person can have!”

“Now go and Live your Life Grace for Life is what has been granted to you” 

Just then as the mysterious man then disappeared into the tree line never again to be seen by Grace. Standing there looking out over Angels Ravine Grace couldn’t help but to feel a little different about her Life. 

As the then memories of her dreams of the girl was now fading slowly fading away from her forever. With only her dreams to come a Life of whatever was to come for Grace. 

Looking down onto her town, the town seemed different to her it seemed different because now it was her town her home her Life. With Grace now leaving Angels Ravine making her way home finding her usual self racing to beat her own best time.

Grace now finding herself making her way in Life, through the streets on her bike weaving in and out of traffic. For the streets was hers and Life on her bike was now going to take her places that she had never gone before. She was going to ride into Life into her Life Living a Life of what she made it.

I dated my ex for five years, we broke up because we were young and immature (18yo). We broke up because I left him after I felt he started losing interest in me and I lost control over him. I will admit I treated him like a dog, I wanted him all the time, I wanted to be married I wanted to be put first above everyone. His family lived far away and he would often go see them. I would get upset when he left to see them. This grew resentment between us both, and eventually I let him go and he let me go. 

He called me everyday for a year after we broke up, he would go to bars calling my name. I knew I was a toxic person and wanted to work on myself. I had a shit situation at home and so I started dating a guy I knew I’d never be with and just slept around with. I fell in love with the new guy. I didn’t answer any of his calls. 

Three years later, I started answering his calls and he asked me to leave him, I told him I’ll always love him and that he was my person. He will always have a special place in my heart. I told my partner about him and our talks. My ex wanted to see me couple times and I saw him, we would go for coffees. It was nice because I could always share everything with him without him judging me or having the worry he was my partner. He knew all of me and loved me always. He would tell me about girls but I always knew he never would fall in love with them like he did me. 

My partner recently betrayed me. This led me to work deeper on myself. I wanted to forgive my partner as I couldn’t forgive my ex.

My mom is dying and hates my partner. She told me never marry him and only marry my ex. 

Now, from my ex’s voice- I can tell he is pursuing a girl he has found. I am so happy for him. He deserves to be happy. A part of me is sad though because now that we are older, this girl will get the wedding and life I always wanted from him within one year. I waited five years for him to marry me before I left him.

I am not even close to marrying my partner because my family dislikes him, and because he betrayed me. I feel at a loss, but I don’t wanna be sad for him. I want to love him enough to be the person that’s genuinely happy for him but I spent the day crying. 

I know it is likely they may not work out, but I don’t wanna pray for that for him for my own selfish reasons. I want to pray it does work out for him.

I’m scared I may have lost the love of my life but if it was meant to be it would’ve been. I don’t know what to do. Sorry for the rant. ",0,1742776358.0,heartbreak,0,0.5,False

1jieakc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jieakc/i_heard_my_mom_whispering_to_herself_one_night/,I heard my mom whispering to herself one night. What I heard terrified me [part 1],"My family has an odd history of tragedy—at least, that’s what my grandma would always say.

‘’It comes in waves; it comes when it wants to.’ She would ominously say but we all knew she was superstitious and generally odd. She had always been excentric according to my mom who has a much-strained relationship with her.

The only tragedy I vaguely remember myself is the death of my little sister Hollie, or Hol as I would always call her.

I was 10 at the time and I don’t recall much. My memory is like an old photograph left out in the rain—distorted, bleeding at the edges, warped in ways I don’t understand. I know I was there when it happened. But when I try to reach back, the details feel... wrong. Shuffled. Like a story, someone else told me, and I just learned to repeat it. The more I try to remember, the more uncertain I become.

After the death of Hol, my mom and grandma grew even further apart. Grandma kept insisting something about her death wasn’t right. She would talk about an evil presence. In her worst moments, she would even go as far as throwing accusations against both me and my mom. Having eventually had enough; my mom cut all ties with her. It was the only way we could start grieving properly, she said.

For 12 years we continued as a family and did our best to move on together in what had always seemed to me, a haunted house that was now just a little shorter on love, a little colder and desolate. For a while, it seemed we were slowly heading in the right direction.

That was until my mom started whispering to herself when she thought no one was around.

It started a couple of years ago. Initially, my dad and I thought nothing of it, when we caught her from time to time, she would brush it aside. ‘’It’s nice to talk to a rational person on occasion’ she would chuckle. It honestly didn’t seem like any reason to worry.

Then one night I heard her whispering to herself from inside her bedroom. My dad and she hadn’t shared a bedroom for a while at that point.

I’m not a person to intrude on other people’s personal space, but I heard her whispering my name. It got my attention.

So, there I stood, in the dark upstairs hallway of my parents’ house spying on my mom. I know it might sound weird, but here’s the thing: She had been acting strangely for a while now. Distant. Almost a bit hostile toward me, and I had no idea why. It seemed she might be angry at me for some unknown reason. We were never any good at actually talking to each other. ‘’the less said, the better’ could’ve been the family motto. This felt like an opportunity I had to jump at.

I put my ear to the door and listened carefully.

She spoke in a low, muffled, and angry whisper. Her voice slithered through the silence, dry and rasping, like dead leaves scraping across pavement.

It was extremely hard to hear anything, but here’s the gist of what I got:

‘’Julian… (my name) doesn’t… Hol…  leave…  was… evil… fault...’’

I felt a cold shiver down my spine. As I stood there, my ear pressed against the door, I felt a sneeze coming on at the worst possible time. I tried to kill it but to no avail. Not long after I heard footsteps approaching the door. I jumped backward and retreated down the stairs as quickly as I could.  

I paused at the bottom of the stairs in the main hallway and looked up. I heard the bedroom door open.

Then I saw my mom’s face peeking over the stair railing. The light behind her cast her features in an unnatural shadow, stretching her eyes into dark, bottomless pits. Her mouth was slightly open, just enough to reveal the glint of teeth. For a split second, it didn’t even look like her face. It looked like a mask constantly changing shape. If you’ve ever tried staring at your reflection in the mirror in a darkly lit room, squinting slightly, you’ll know what I mean.

My stomach tightened.

I was sure she couldn’t see me in the darkness downstairs. But then—she tilted her head, just slightly. As if she could.

It seemed like her eyes were staring straight into mine. I remained motionless, afraid to move, afraid she would notice me. Finally, she retreated into the bedroom.

I didn’t sleep much that night. My thoughts were all over the place. Why had my mom been whispering angrily to herself about me and Hol? Who was evil? I wanted to confront her but how could I? I would have to admit to spying on her.

I had to know more, and seeing no other option, I decided to keep spying on her. The only problem was, I couldn’t hear her properly from outside the bedroom with the door closed. I needed to be in the room.

The following nights I would hide in my mom’s bedroom, under her bed.

It felt wrong. It truly did, but I had to know what she was whispering to herself about. Confronting her was not an option.

On the fourth night, it happened. I was lying tugged, well, trapped really, under the bed when the low angry, and growling whisper began filling the room. I had never heard a whisper so full of rage before. It was a whisper stretched too thin, trembling on the edge of something far worse. The words dripped with quiet, seething fury like they were being torn from deep within her.

“*They never mention you.”*

“*They all forgot.”*

‘’I’m the only one who cares. The only one who ever cared.’ The whisper crept into the room and seemed to speak from the walls.

 I didn’t know until then; how terrifying and angry a person can sound while whispering. I couldn’t believe this sound came from my mom.

‘’*There’s something wrong with Julian, there was always something wrong with him. I wish you could tell me how you feel, tell me what you think*.’

I felt an intense fear and unease mixed with sadness. Was this what my mom had always thought of me? That something was wrong with me? Why did it seem like the last sentence she spoke had been directed to someone else in the room with her? I tried to keep myself composed, I couldn’t have her discover me now, creeping under the bed.

It became nearly impossible for me when a second whisper, which I KNEW wasn’t my mom, suddenly appeared.

‘*’Something must be done about Dulian. He must be punished.*’’

The pitch was all wrong—high and thin, with childish undertones. It wavered between something innocent and something utterly unnatural**,** twisting and twitching with a jagged, broken quality that sent a shiver down my spine. To my horror, I realized that somewhere in that angry, resentful pitch, were traces of Hol’s voice.

At first, I thought it was an echo. A trick of the mind. But then I heard it—the way she used to say my name. Dulian...  She never was able to pronounce the ‘J’’ part. But there was no warmth or innocence left in it… Just anger and something else... Hurt perhaps. Or disappointment.  

‘*’He must be punished.*’

Hol’s whisper seemed to come from right beside me now. I covered my mouth and started sobbing. I couldn’t help it. Hearing Hol’s voice again speaking those words. I never really believed in ghosts, demons, or any of the things my grandma seemed to believe in, yet how could I explain this?

‘’I’ll make sure he gets what he deserves, Hol.’’

I was in a state of shock. I could hardly believe what I was hearing. My mom was whispering to my dead sister, and they both seemed to hate me for some reason that completely escaped me. I know I probably wasn’t always the best brother or the best son. Heck, there are a lot of things about me I don’t like, but did I deserve their hatred? Their anger? Maybe I did.

Suddenly the whispers stopped. I could hear my mom moving about the room. Had she heard my sobbing?

For what seemed like agonizing hours I held my breath until the light was turned off and my mom went to bed. I waited until I was sure she was asleep and crept out from under the bed. As quietly as possible, I opened the door but just as I was about to close it behind me, I heard her.

 ‘’Julian, is that you?’’

I was caught. I slowly turned around.

She was sitting up in the bed, bathed in darkness, I could barely see her expression, yet it seemed to be judging me. ‘’I’m sorry Mom, I…’’

Had no words. Nothing to explain why I was suddenly standing there.

‘’Is everything ok?’’ Her voice sounded tired and angry. I shifted back and forth on my feet nervously. ‘’Yes, I’m sorry… I didn’t mean to disturb you. It’s nothing, we can talk about it tomorrow.’

Brilliant. I had time to come up with an excuse. Hopefully, she hadn’t seen me crawl out from under her bed.

‘’It’s late, Julian, you should get some sleep.’

I nodded. ‘’Goodnight.’

I closed the door and instantly felt a panic attack coming on. Like the fabric of my soul was being torn into.

The following morning was awkward, to say the least. My mom casually asked why I had been in her bedroom the night before, and all I could muster up was:

“I wanted to ask you if I could borrow the car today.”

She sighed. I sensed she didn’t believe me.

“Sure, honey. Just don’t take too long. I need it by tonight.”

I nodded silently.

My mom then said, looking up from her book, “Are you sure there’s nothing else you want to talk about? You know you can always talk to me, right?”

Her voice was calm, but there was an edge to it—a sharpness that felt misplaced. Her gaze lingered a second too long, making my skin crawl.

My dad took notice of the tension and shifted uncomfortably in his chair.

“No, Mom, really. I just needed to borrow the car.”

She held my gaze for an excruciatingly long time before she spoke.

“You know, you’ve been acting strange lately.”

I almost choked on my coffee. *I’VE been acting strange lately?*

I felt a strong urge to confront her about everything I’d heard. About the whispers. All of it. But then I realized how insane it would have sounded: *My dead sister and mom whispering to each other?* My dad would take her side, surely. They might even send me away to some institution. Was that her… their goal?

I felt like a moth pinned to a board under her stare, squirming under the weight of her unspoken accusations.

“I’ve been stressed lately,” I said finally. “I still have trouble finding a job. It wears me out a little.”

Her face was unreadable, but it felt like she was smirking behind her neutral gaze. Like she was taking joy in the fact that I was struggling to get my life together.

“Sure, I understand, but please don’t feel like a failure. Everyone falls on hard times.”

Her voice seemed condescending, spiteful.

I got up and left. “I never said I felt like a failure.”

She sighed as I left the uncomfortable conversation behind.

I retreated down the basement to my bedroom to think it all over. I couldn’t risk spying on her again, but I couldn’t just wait for whatever horrifying plan they had in store for me. Whatever punishment they felt I deserved. Something was very, very wrong, if felt it with every inch of my being.

Just then, I thought about my grandma’s warnings. I remembered how my mom had cut her off. Written her off as a superstitious oddball. Considering everything, it now seemed I might do well listening to her for once. I had already gotten permission to borrow the car, so I decided to go see her.

Grandma lived on the other side of town in a parcel house. Her front yard was overgrown with weeds. She had gotten too old to tend to it herself and had no one else to do it for her. I felt bad. My mom decided to cut her off, yet the rest of us followed her lead without much question. It had been years since I visited her.

When I rang the bell, a sudden rush of nostalgia came over me as I heard the tune playing: *“Oh, when the saints go marching in…”* I remembered then, despite her oddities, how much I had enjoyed spending time with her before Hol died.

She invited me in with a smile on her face. If she was angry with me for not visiting more, it didn’t show.

The state of her house was in a similar decrepit condition as her front yard. Boxes, trinkets, old souvenirs, and religious and occult objects flooded the place. The air inside was heavy, tinged with the faint metallic scent of old coins and something sour that I couldn’t place. Shadows seemed to pool in the corners of her living room, too deep for the weak light to penetrate. I suddenly felt watched from the darkness.

I sat, not knowing what to say, but it seemed she knew better than me.

“You look tired, dear.”

I sighed. We exchanged a few trivial words before I mustered up the strength to ask.

“You once said this family had a history of tragedy. Like some kind of curse?”

She nodded. “Your mom and I never saw eye to eye on that. She wouldn’t hear it. I suppose she thought I was a superstitious old hag.”

She chuckled, but her eyes betrayed her.

“Maybe I am. But we are who we are.”

I looked around at the strange symbols and objects that hung on her walls.

“Can you tell me about it?”

Her eyes lit up as if she’d been waiting for someone to ask her, yet she seemed worried too.

“Julian, dear, is something wrong?”

I paused.

“I think I’m cursed. I… Haven’t been feeling alright lately. Something is wrong.”

She looked at me, concerned, fearful.

""‘It’s found you, hasn’t it?’ she whispered, almost as if the words themselves could summon something from the shadows.""

I swear it felt like the whispers were now inside my head, echoing and bouncing off the walls of my skull.

*“You’re not getting away. You’re not getting away. She can’t help you.”*

They grew louder, overlapping and swirling together until they became a cacophony of taunts. Words I couldn’t fully grasp burrowed into my mind like claws.

I did my best to ignore it.

“What is it?”

Grandma sighed. “Something as old as time, I suppose. It causes trouble and tragedy wherever it goes, breaking you down slowly. It wants to be you. Wants you to think it’s you.”

I felt uneasy in my entire body.

“I don’t understand. That makes no sense.”

She placed a hand on my shoulder.

“Everyone has to find out for themselves before it’s too late. It took your uncle. Before that, it took your grandfather. Even before that. Accidents, deaths, tragedy.”

I felt more confused than ever.

“Didn’t my uncle take his own life? I—”

Grandma interrupted.

“It made him do it. It whispered in his ears. That’s what it does, you know. It screams when it doesn’t whisper. Your uncle didn’t just take his own life,’ Grandma said, her voice dropping to a whisper. ‘He was... hollowed out. Like something had scooped out his will and left him an empty shell.’""

I had come looking for answers, but I was left more confused than ever.

“Why does it use my sister’s voice? I don’t understand.”

She looked at me with the weary weight of a lifetime’s knowledge.

 “Only you know the answer to that. I can’t help you fight it. I can’t take you on this journey. I can only show you the door. It knows you, and it will use that against you. It knows your fears. Your insecurities. It will take everything you love and turn it into something ugly. Once you’re weak enough, it will come for you, come to finish you off.”

She got up and started going through some old stuff. She found what looked like a wooden trinket—a circle with strange markings on it.

She handed me the carved circle. ‘Wear this,’ she said, her voice trembling. ‘It will help. But remember—this can’t save you. Only you can do that.’

I was floored.

“How do you fight something like that?”

She took my hand.

“You know. Look into yourself, and you’ll know.”

Her touch brought me back in time.

Hol was there. We were playing hide and seek in Grandma’s house. It was just before Christmas, and the smell of cinnamon was everywhere. I had searched for what felt like hours.

Suddenly, I heard a wailing. I followed the sound until I found her in the playhouse out in Grandma’s backyard. She had accidentally locked herself inside.

“You didn’t find me. I thought you’d left me. I thought...”

And just like that, I was back in the room with Grandma.

I felt tears welling up.

“I can’t do this alone. Ever since Hol died, things have... Mom hates me. She whispers terrible things about me. Dad doesn’t even seem to care enough to hate me.”

Grandma shook her head.

“You can, and you will. You’re not alone, but this one thing—this one thing—you must do alone. You must look into yourself as you confront it. And you must confront it. There is no escape. There is no running away. It will come for you, again and again, until it comes one last time.’’

I was on the verge of giving up.

“I don’t know how to do that. I don’t even know where to begin.”

She gently grabbed my shoulder.

“You’ve forgotten so much, haven’t you? I can’t help you see it, but maybe I can show you the way. Look in your parents’ attic. There’s a yellow, faded box up there. Find it. Maybe it will help you remember. Help you see what you need to see.”

I felt defeated. Hopeless, yet still determined to keep fighting.

As I got up, I stopped for a moment.

“Grandma? What really happened between you and Mom? Why don’t you talk?”

She looked at me. Her eyes were old and tired.

“We both said things we shouldn’t have said. Your mom and I... we’re very different, dear. People handle tragedy differently.”

I nodded and headed for the door.

“Julian, dear?”

I stopped.

“Remember what I said.”

When I arrived back at my parents’ house, the sun was still high. It was afternoon, and I knew they wouldn’t be home for at least a couple of hours. I had time.

My grandma had wanted me to find something in the attic. She’d been cryptic, as always, but the weight of her words stayed with me: *“Maybe it will help you remember. Help you see what you need to see.’’*

I found the wooden ladder tucked neatly in the closet, just where it had always been. The hatch to the attic groaned as I pulled it down, the sound carrying through the empty house. As I climbed, each step felt heavier than the last. I tried to brace myself for what I might find.

The attic was unchanged. Standing exactly as it had done when Hol and I used to play hide and seek here—dusty, old, and shrouded in an eerie stillness that seemed to press against my chest. The wooden beams overhead cast long shadows in the dim light filtering through the lone window. The floorboards creaked beneath my weight, sounding fragile, as if they might give way at any moment. The air was thick with rot and dust, a stale, suffocating aroma that crawled into my throat and refused to leave.

*“Look for a yellow faded box,”* Grandma had said. I scanned the cluttered space and spotted a pile of boxes beneath a tattered blanket. The fabric was rough and grimy, like it had been abandoned to time. My hands brushed over the rough texture as I peeled it back, and there it was—a large, faded yellow box. Scribbled on the side were the names *“Julian and Hollie.”*

My stomach sank.

With trembling hands, I lifted the lid. The stale scent of old cardboard hit me immediately, and for a moment, I hesitated, half-expecting something… terrible to leap out at me. But all that greeted me were toys, faded drawings, and an old photo album. My chest loosened in relief, but the unease lingered.

I sifted through the contents, each item dragging me back through memories and feelings I thought I had buried long ago.

There was Leo, Hol’s favorite stuffed white tiger. She’d adored him, carrying him everywhere, playing with him for hours. I’d been jealous and because of me, Leo now wore an eye patch that my mom had lovingly sewn. His white fur was matted and gray with age, the little patch still crooked. Holding it now, I felt the sting like a knife in my side. It wasn’t just a toy. It had been her joy, and I’d scarred it.

Was I like that? Did I have trouble controlling my emotions? Did I take it out on Hol?

*“*I was a kid*,”* I whispered aloud, trying to rationalize it. But the thought turned sour.

Something shifted in the air, a barely perceptible sound—whispers carried by the attic’s stale breath. ‘’*No excuse.’’* The words coiled around me, soft at first, then louder, crashing in a rising crescendo. ‘’*No excuse!’’* I shook my head, desperate to quiet them. I hummed a tune I barely remembered, a childhood melody that brought me a sliver of comfort.

Beneath the toys were drawings—mine, mostly. Memories of afternoons spent with crayons and markers came flooding back. Hadn’t I also drawn things for Hol? I had, I remembered. *“Draw me tigers, rainbows, and sunflowers,”* she’d say with wide eyes. And I’d oblige.

*“*For Hol*,”* the words on the drawings said. The ones with tigers, rainbows, and sunflowers. Crudely drawn tigers played under rainbows; wobbly sunflowers stretched tall under bright blue skies.

But not all the drawings were like that.

The others—the ones I’d made just for me—were different.

I flipped through them, the familiar unease returning. My mom’s voice echoed in my mind: *“So many of your drawings have ghosts in them.”* She wasn’t wrong. I hadn’t noticed it as a child, but now, staring at the crude figures, I couldn’t deny it.

One drawing caught my eye—a family portrait. Stick figures, all of us together. Except I’d drawn myself twice. One version of me stood with the others, smiling. The second… it was scrawled in red, thick and angry, overlapping lines that slashed across the page like open wounds.

The whispers came again, closer this time. ‘’*Always broken. Always evil.’’*

I dropped the drawing, my hands trembling.

What had Grandma wanted me to see? What had she hoped I’d remember?

The ghosts in the drawings weren’t just stick figures—they were hollow-eyed, monstrous things. Their smiles stretched too wide, jagged mouths curling unnaturally across their faces.

Why had I drawn these things?

I flipped to another drawing—a grotesque scene of a monster killing a man. Below it, in a child’s scrawl, I had written: *“It’s fun to murder.”*

I shook my head, trying to dismiss it. *Just a kid with a vivid imagination.* It didn’t mean anything, right? That old horror movie, the one that had given me nightmares, had probably inspired me, the one with the murderous doll—*Child’s Play,* I think it was called.

But the whispers disagreed.

*‘’You lie to yourself’* they hissed. Their voices wrapped around me, overlapping in a maddening chorus that rose from every shadow in the attic. ‘’*You were always broken. Dark and twisted. Poor Hol. She suffered because of you.’’*

“NO!” I screamed, clamping my hands over my ears. I started humming the tune Hol and I used to sing together, trying to drown out the voices. But it didn’t help. They weren’t coming from the attic—they were inside my head.

I stood up and raised my voice to try and push them away.

‘’I’m a good person! I would never hurt my sister!’

The whispers hissed at me angrily, words I could hardly deny.

*‘’Evil people don’t know they are evil!’’*

I dropped to my knees, lost and defeated.

This couldn’t be what Grandma wanted me to see. Did she set me up? Was she in on it all?

Anger gnawed at my soul like rats chewing through rotting wood.

“*Keep going*,” a voice commanded, louder and sharper than the rest. It cut through the noise like a knife.

I obeyed.

I opened the photo album, flipping through the pages of old, faded Polaroids bleached by time. There we were—Hol and me, side by side in nearly every photo. I hadn’t looked at these in years. As if seeing her face would bring back something I’d rather leave behind. She smiled at me now, from the old, faded Polaroid. One of the last taken of her and me before she died. Forever 8 years old. Sitting next to me in our parents’ old storage space, where we kept all the Christmas decorations. Where we used to play.

Her expression haunted me. Something about the way she sat, slightly too far away from me, as if something had spooked her.

The whispers grew louder, their words like daggers: *“Yes, yes, yes! She was scared of you! Scared of you!”*

“NO!” I yelled, my voice shaking as I almost slammed the album shut.

But then my eyes caught another polaroid.

It was of me and Hol in our parents’ garden, standing beneath two towering sunflowers. Our smiling faces beamed with innocent, unrestrained joy.

“Draw me tall sunflowers,” her small voice echoed in my head, faint and almost drowned by the whispers.

My mom once told me that, to a child, the world feels vast, mysterious, and full of adventure. Everything is new—everything begs to be explored. A single leaf can hold an entire universe.

Most of us forget what that is like.

But I remember now.

In our garden, Hol and I saw a jungle—*our* jungle. Flowers, weeds, and trees became enchanted kingdoms. We were explorers, greeting every creature like an old friend, gazing up at the sunflowers that seemed to stretch into the bright blue sky.

I remember the first time Hol saw a rainbow. We were lying on the grass, rain lightly falling around us. We didn’t have a care in the world, just enjoying the calmness of the moment. Her eyes lit up with wonder as she tugged on my shirt.

“What is that pretty thing in the sky?” she asked and pointed.

“It’s a rainbow, Hol,” I told her. She dragged me around the rest of the day trying to chase it down. It seemed to me that we almost caught it.

On lazy summer days, we would play this game, pretending one of us was a big hungry tiger chasing the other through the garden.

I remember the rush of weaving through the bushes, leaves lightly brushing against my skin, branches snapping back as I tore ahead. My heart pounded—not with fear, but with the wild thrill of the chase. Behind me, Hol was gaining, her playful growls blending with the rustling of the wind. She was the tiger, fierce and relentless. I ran until my lungs burned, I ran until her tiny hands finally caught my shirt, and we tumbled into the grass, breathless and laughing, the world around us nothing but sunlight, tangled limbs, and the echo of our joy.

After she died, the garden changed. It looked the same but felt different, empty of something essential, occupied by something monstrous. What once was a jungle of wonder, a kaleidoscope of greens, yellows, reds, and purple bursting with life, now seemed to be a fading, lifeless version of its former self. The leaves seemed dull, their edges curling inward like clawed hands. The sunflowers loomed less like gentle giants and more like towering sentinels, guarding something sinister and forgotten.

As I sat in the dim attic, the old Polaroid trembling in my hands, the dust-heavy air felt thick with memories. My fingers traced the faded edges, and suddenly, I was back in the garden—Back inside a memory of the last time I ever ran through our garden Our jungle.

I was fourteen, chasing a feeling. Desperate to recapture something lost, I sprinted through the overgrown weeds and tangled bushes, my breath hitching, my pulse hammering like it used to. I imagined Hol behind me, her laughter ringing through the leaves, her playful growls close at my heels. For a fleeting moment, the magic sparked to life again.

Then I heard it—branches crackling behind me, bushes being trampled through. The laughter coupled with growling. Her laughter. Her growling.

Only it wasn’t.

It sounded wrong, like a deliberately bad imitation—a wailing, painful laughter devoid of joy or innocence. An angry, guttural growl.

I stopped and glanced over my shoulder, and that’s when I saw her. Pale, ghostly, slightly obscured through the weeds and bushes. Her eyes—those dead, accusing eyes—stared straight at me. Eyes that had closed forever and been buried years ago.

I froze, paralyzed by fear, as she slowly crept out from the shadow of the bushes. She crawled on all fours like she used to, pretending to be a tiger. Only this time, her movements were predatory—deliberate, menacing. Her limbs, broken and twisted as they had been the day she died, jerked unnaturally with every step, like a marionette controlled by unseen strings. The growling deepened, layered with something that didn’t belong to her small frame.

Her face, once so full of life, was now pale and contorted with hatred. The light that had danced in her eyes during our childhood adventures was gone, replaced by an empty, seething darkness.

Her lips twisted into a wicked, unnatural smile that stretched far too wide, splitting her pale face like a gash. Jagged, dirty teeth—too many to count—filled a mouth that seemed to grow larger the longer I stared. Her bright blue eyes turned to black pits, glinting with an otherworldly hate that seemed to pierce my very soul.

“Don’t you want to play anymore?” Her voice was guttural, a hideous growl that rumbled from deep inside her throat.

I turned and ran. I ran like I’d never done before. My chest burned, my heart pounded, but I didn’t dare stop. There would be no giggling or collapsing in fits of laughter this time. If she caught me, I knew it wouldn’t end with joy.

Behind me, I heard her—half-wailing, half-growling—a rising crescendo of fury. Her voice rang out, a guttural howl that sent shivers down my spine.

“It’s your fault! It’s all your fault! And now you leave me here alone!” Her words tore through the air, sharp and ragged, like a thousand nails scraping against bone. The sound vibrated in my skull, drilling into my thoughts.

Branches whipped at my face, cutting my skin as I ran. The air around me felt thick and heavy, carrying the acrid scent of decay. My lungs burned as I gasped for breath, pushing my legs harder than I ever thought possible.

The crackling of branches behind me grew louder. Her howling was closer now, and I was certain she’d catch me. I screamed, the sound ripping from my throat, raw and desperate. Somewhere in the distance, I heard a voice calling out—a lifeline.

I burst out of the bushes and into the open. Strong arms wrapped around me. I thrashed wildly, convinced she’d caught me. It wasn’t until I felt the familiar warmth of my mom’s embrace that I realized I was safe. I buried my face in her chest, sobbing uncontrollably. She held me tightly, rubbing my back in silent comfort.

“What happened?” she asked softly, but I couldn’t possibly begin to explain. No more words were said about it. We were never good at talking in my family.

As I glanced back, tears blurring my vision, I saw her. Half-hidden in the bushes, her pale, ghoulish face stared at me with those empty, hateful eyes. That smile—God, that smile—was still there, carved into her face like a cruel scar.

Had she always been there? Watching me through the years, through my lonely, sibling-less childhood? Always one step behind, waiting for the right moment to strike?

No. This wasn’t her. It couldn’t be. This was something else. Something monstrous. This was the “it” Grandma had warned me about.

How could I fight something when I didn’t even know what it was? What it wanted?

I know I wasn’t the best brother. I know I’ve screwed up—then and now. I could never be like her. Perfect Hollie. I wasn’t there for her when she needed me most. Maybe… maybe I was even to blame for what happened to her. Is that what it wanted me to admit? Would that bring me peace?

I couldn’t tell where the whispers ended, and my own thoughts began. They echoed in my mind, relentless and accusing.

I took the Polaroid of Hol, me, and the sunflowers. I took the drawings I’d made for her, too. I held onto the memories—of running through the bushes, of laughter, of childhood wonder.

I didn’t know what was coming, but I needed those memories. I needed them close.

The next day after my trip to the attic, I paced around my bedroom in the basement, trying to figure out how to proceed.

I could hear the whispers again, coiling around my thoughts, squeezing the clarity out of my mind. Had they always been there, just beneath the surface, waiting to be heard? Each word felt like it belonged to someone else. Someone who knew something I didn’t.

“Something is wrong with you,” they hissed.

Maybe they were right.

Something was out to get me; I knew that much.

 And it was conspiring with my mom. Turning her against me.

My thoughts were interrupted, disturbed by her presence.

“Julian? Did you forget to put gas in the car?”

I jumped up in surprise. “I… I guess I did. Mom, could you knock before you barge in?”

She looked at me with a condescending expression. “You wouldn’t have this problem if you found your own place, you know.”

Her voice was sharp and desperate as if worn down by years of frustration—but there was something else now. A strange undertone, something that didn’t belong to her.

I looked at her uneasily.

“I’m trying… things aren’t…”

She sighed and changed the subject. “Julian, did you go to the attic?”

I froze. I was about to lie but realized she wouldn’t be asking this question if she didn’t already know the answer.

“Yes, I was just going through some old stuff and…”

She interrupted me. “You and Hollie’s old stuff. I know… You should put things back where they belong if you’re going to go digging through it all, and please put the ladder back in the closet next time.”

My entire body tensed up. Her demeanor seemed almost threatening, something behind her eyes glaring at me menacingly.

“I’m sorry, I guess I forgot.”

She sighed again, turned to leave, but then stopped as if contemplating something. She turned to face me again.

“Why were you going through that stuff anyway, Julian? We really need to talk about your behavior lately.”

The whispers crept around my childhood bedroom, closing in, and surrounding me.

“She knows what you are. She knows what you are. Broken. Twisted. Evil. Won’t be long now. Won’t be long.”

I took a step back.

“I just… wanted to look at it. Something wrong with that? There’s nothing to talk about.”

She looked at me suspiciously for an uncomfortably long time.

“This can’t go on,” she finally said and left.

That same night, as I went upstairs to get a drink from the kitchen, I heard my parents talking inside the living room.

I stayed as quiet as I could, trying to listen in. Eventually, as I knew it would, their conversation landed on me.

“He’s always been like this,” I heard my dad say.

My mom’s voice was muffled, but I got the gist of her response: “We need to deal with him. We can’t ignore this. Something is wrong with him. I’m afraid of what he might do if we don’t react soon.”

My veins turned to ice as I heard my dad agreeing with her. The whispers crept around me again, mocking me with their evil taunts:

“*No help from daddy. No help at all*.”

This thing had turned what was left of my family against me now. I felt more alone than ever before as I went downstairs that night.

After shifting and turning restlessly in my bed for hours I fell into an uneasy sleep.

When I woke the next morning, still sleepy and droopy-eyed, I saw something that terrified me beyond comprehension.

My mom was watching me through the crack of slightly open door into my bedroom. I didn’t hear her footsteps. She just appeared. Her face was half-shadowed in the doorframe. Her eyes—those eyes—so far removed from the softness I once knew. They burned with something darker. Something old and sinister.

Her mouth stretched into a half-smile, a twisted smile that didn’t reach her eyes.

I buried my face in the pillow. I couldn’t take this much longer. How much more was this thing going to torture me before it finally finished me off?",1,1742776346.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I’ve just moved to a big city where I know no one, and I’ve been trying to get back out there and meet people and make friends, not just talk to women. 
I’ve had very little success talking to women at bars. I partially think I weird them out when I tried to go out solo. I casually talk to women at other activities, but they generally dont reciprocate any attempts to flirt.
I’ve been trying Hinge as well, which is where most of my frustrations come from. I’ve now been stood up 3 times and ghosted at least 8 times. I don’t quite understand why this keeps happening, usually we chat on the app for a little, I get their number, we chat some more, and then I ask them out.

What am I doing wrong here? Is this just how it is? I’m getting frustrated and frankly a little sad that nobody wants to even meet and give me a chance.

I currently live in a beautiful apartment with marble floors and counter tops, high ceilings, crown molding, brick and marble fire place, huge windows, hard wood floors, etc. I'm already missing it but moving to a better location in the city and had to do what i had to do for the price point

I think i have pretty warm decor, although i will need more.

.

My partner late 20s. She told me early on she had BPD and I have a strong remembering of it.

Later on she told me she doesn't have it and doesn't believe in the DSM. For BPD that is. She claims it's not widely enough understood for people to be diagnosed with BPD.

I've done a ton of reading into BPD. Also read into OCD on numerous occasions.

I've begun to understand. My ex also had BPD and she cheated multiple times and eventually started dating one of her new supplies. 

My current partner has been going through extensive therapy and I've noticed some changes. There are some things that aren't getting better.


Recently I was in my office and watching some YouTube videos at the end of a night falling asleep. 

She came in crying upset about being lonely and having limited friends. I genuinely try my best to comfort her. She asks to be rubbed so I go to the couch and rub her. I'm trying to let her get it out because if I talk too much or give advice then I am smothering and not allowing space to vent. If I don't say anything and allow that then I lack empathy. When I try to meet a middle ground and tell her she can make friends and how it's hard as an adult. 

I ask why this is hitting her so hard right now if anything triggered her.

In a switch after the tears ended it turned into hostility towards me. 


""My boyfriend should say x, y z. "" 

I tried telling her I do love her and I did apologize that my way of comforting wasn't enough, and I also apologized for saying the wrong things to her. Which I don't feel like I did, and I don't feel like I should apologize for not saying the right things?
 
If you want me to say different in the future I'm open and I'd love to hear it. But the way it's proposed like there was an error in my ways to the point I was intentionally not giving her enough love, so I was in fact lacking empathy.

I expressed to her it doesn't feel like I can ever say the right things and the whole fight exploded from there.

She got upset and followed me into the other room. It wasn't rational or a coherent conversation after. Constant cutting off in the middle of speaking to try and prove me wrong. The yelling, and not leaving me alone even when she walked away and the door was closed she came back. Opened the door. And began crying loudly.

I ""made her feel bad"" when she was trying to express her emotions. So now I'm the bad guy and she's going to go into the city alone at a restaurant. 

My emotions don't matter and the effort I put forth is  disregarded at a moments notice. I am being discarded by the person who supposedly loves me and I don't feel like I have anywhere to turn.


I tried this morning to open conversation by getting her a coffee and bringing it home to her after the gym. 

I tried talking to her and her response was ""i can't work on resolving things when you just make me feel the way you do""

I am honestly hurt and dumbfounded because I try my best. I didn't raise my voice or cuss. I dont call anyone names. But I am painted as a villian. Bad guy, manipulator. I am called names even when I'm on vacation 3k miles away.

I'd like some genuine advice because I do love her but I am hurt


Update - She went into the city alone, and texted me. She said the only way she'd feel ""comfortable"" talking was with a therapist. 

Its like I'm being painted as a bully and I already know she'd try her tactics on a therapist. 

I also know she'd want a woman and would never be open to a man.


 I'm genuinely shocked and I really am starting to understand their perspective is delusional (no insult intended) and its genuinely impossible to communicate with delusional/irrational/illogical perspective.

I don't mean that with any insulting intention. Just truthfully, if there's two stories to every event then how can you rationalize with it.

 I am still responsible for making her feel bad. She cussed at me, yelled at me..opened doors to cry loudly at me.

Today she's slammed counters and given silent treatment, slammed counter drawers and cabinets. 

I feel like this is considered abusive and I don't know how it's defined.

We've slowly been getting more and more fed up and now we're to the point where we're miserable living in our own home. Firstly, I met RM (Roommate) while I was working at a chain coffee place (you know the one) in October 2023. I worked with RM a few times, but not enough to really know him. He text me one day and asked if we had any extra place for him to stay because he is trans and his parents were abusive and toxic. He was 18 and still in high school at the time. My BF and I talked about it and we sat down with him and chatted about his situation and what his plans were. We decided to open up our home to this kid under the condition he pays the internet bill ($120) a month and he moved in December 2023. Fast forward February 2024, I go on a mental health leave at work due to a serious depressive episode. I saw a therapist and her recommendation was a month break from work. When RM heard I was taking the leave, he called our work and immediately requested a mental health leave the same day, even though he hadn't seen a therapist or a doctor. He was fired in April due to no documentation saying he needed to be put on leave. We told him to at least finish high school and he wouldn't haven't to worry about working until the summer. Summer rolls around, he goes through 3 jobs in the span of 4 months. In August, he went +24 hours without eating and went out with a friend in the summer heat and passed out. From then on he was convinced he had a passing out problem and basically quit his jobs because he thought he would pass out if he went to work. We talk to him about it, he tells us his mom is going to help him pay the internet bill because he hadn't paid a single one since Marchish.. He pays the internet bill 3 times after we have the talk, but now he's back to not paying for anything and just riding for free. We've asked him countless times to get a job, but he's convinced he's got health issues, even though he's been checked out by multiple doctors and had tests run confirming he's FINE.  Took him to a job interview a month ago and they needed his ID, but he couldn't find his ID and made me help him search his truck just incase I had that ""Mom Power"" where you can just find things. SOOO, now we're at the point where he can't get a job because he has no ID. I told him that if he could keep our place clean, we'd feed him and wouldn't complain while he's getting his stuff for his ID. He hasn't been cleaning well. He said he's asked his mom for his paperwork to get a new ID, but I know he's only texted her maybe once about it instead of hounding her like he should be. All he does all day is play animal jam, beg us for weed, and stay in his room. Not to mention he has a blind kitten that has constant diarrhea he doesn't take care of. Poor kitten is barricaded in the kitchen to contain the poop because he won't take her to the vet. RM legit has had a bad home life, but I'm fed up and so tired of playing mom to a kid that isn't mine. At 19, I couldn't imagine living with somebody and acting the way he does.

I feel awful because we took this kid in thinking he just needed a support system, but he's ended up just living nearly rent free and jobless the whole time he's been with us. Any money he gets goes towards Dr Pepper, tattoos, or Shein orders. He's very manipulative and I'm scared for the conversation we have to have. I know he's going to cry and make us feel bad, but I don't know what else to do. We've had multiple talks with him about getting his life together, he says he will, will do better for a week, then slips back into his ways.

Extras:

He drove our car down the road and back with the e-brake on and the next day I went to the car the tire was destroyed. The night he drove the car and came back, he said how he didn't want to be responsible for anything that happened to our car and didn't want to drive it again.  (DIDN'T ADMIT TO DOING IT THOUGH)

He sneaks in the living room and steals any weed we have on our entertainment center.

He owes us about +$1000 in unpaid bills.

It’s true that you were selfish though, but I know you are a good person, you are kind and thoughtful to people around you.

You are not a bad person, you just don’t know how to love me the way I wanted to. And I’ve accepted that, maybe we’re just not a match in terms of love and relationship. 
The way you love can’t be forced, it’s something you just give because you want to, because you care about the person and you want them to be happy.

But of course, cheating was a selfish choice, any trauma or loneliness is not an excuse to betray and manipulate another person. You should have just told me, you could have save your pride, I would have let you go because I want the best for you. 

I know for a fact that kahit anong love and effort that I gave you, if you don’t love me and not interested enough. I can’t force you to give the same amount of love back. I can’t force you to make an effort, to consider my happiness, because that should come naturally to you because you cared for me.

I always think that love should be effortless, love makes you calm and at peace. I really thought that was us but it turns out I was just looking through red coloured glasses and ignored the mismatched.

Our relationship didn’t end, it was completed.

1jidv8v,https://i.redd.it/zoa1l7365jqe1.jpeg,Anyone have a link to “Carrying His Heir While Fighting His Lies”?,"Seven months pregnant, I visited a postpartum care center to make a reservation.
During the contract signing process, the staff member looked at me strangely after entering my information:
""Ms. Sullivan, our system shows your husband registered with us six months ago.""
""And his spouse definitely isn't you—""
Confused, I showed her my wedding photos with my husband Blake.
The staff member rolled her eyes and pulled up the information page, ""Mr. Jensen has been married for five years and already has two children.""
""Here's their marriage certificate and photos taken at our center.""
In the photo, my husband was holding a child while standing next to a strange woman.
They looked intimate and affectionate, exactly like a loving young couple.
And the man on the marriage certificate was undeniably my husband!
If they were husband and wife, then who was I?!

""Mr. Jensen's wife is our premium member. How shameless of you to try this scam!""

""Get out! We don't serve disgraceful pregnant women.""

The receptionist looked me up and down with contempt before kicking me out without letting me explain.

By the time I came to my senses, the center had already closed its doors.

I stood there bewildered, recalling the marriage certificate and information I'd just seen.

It was clearly my husband's face, his information and name, but the woman in the photo... I didn't recognize her at all.

Why had Blake hidden the fact that he was already married?

Growing angrier by the minute, I urgently called Blake, determined to confront him.

But the phone kept showing ""temporarily unavailable,"" and even after sending countless messages, I received no response.

Then I remembered he was on a business trip abroad and probably busy with work.

Unable to reach Blake, I could only suppress my emotions for now, waiting for his explanation.

If I confirmed this was true, I'd make him pay!

Just then, Blake finally returned my video call:

""Babe, I was just handling some work and didn't have time to check your messages.""

When the screen opened, I saw his familiar face.

Blake sat in his office wearing a sharp suit, with several half-finished cups of coffee still steaming beside him, seemed that he'd just finished a meeting.

His exhausted expression immediately made me feel sympathetic, but the memory of what I'd just discovered brought me back to reality.

Looking at him, I demanded furiously:

""Blake, are you hiding something from me? Do you have someone else?""

The man on screen had been smiling until a second ago, but now his face turned pale with fear.

He practically dropped to his knees in front of the camera:

""Babe, I don't! I only love you!""

""There's never been anyone else but you!""

Worried I'd misunderstand, he frantically showed me his entire office to prove there wasn't a trace of any woman's belongings.

""Who's been saying bad things about me?!""

""Is it some media rumor? When I get back, I'll make them pay!""

""Babe, you have to believe me, I'll only ever love you!""

Seeing his pale face and flustered behavior helped ease my tension.

Blake and I were college classmates. He fell for me at first sight and secretly loved me for two years before finally gathering the courage to confess.

That day, he held a huge bouquet of roses in front of me, stumbling over his words and making a lovable fool of himself.

Though the man had an elegant, cold face, he was incredibly shy and awkward.

This stark contrast made me increasingly curious about him.

After observing him for six months, I gradually fell for him and finally chose to be with him.

To give me a better life, he started his own business after graduation.

In just two years, he steadily built the company up, never complaining about the hardships.

And when he became successful, he offered all his shares as a betrothal gift to me.

I still remember the scene when he proposed. Standing in the moonlight, he solemnly vowed:

""I'll only ever commit to you in this lifetime. All my money is yours.""

""If I ever betray you, you can kick me out penniless.""

He offered everything he had with both hands, proving his sincerity.

In that moment, I knew he was the one worth entrusting my life to.

After marriage, he was even more attentive. He handled all household matters, big and small.

All our friends knew Blake was obsessed with spoiling his wife, always home before seven.

How could someone who loved me so deeply possibly have another family?

Thinking about this, my doubts began to fade:

""Alright, I'll trust you this once, but if I find out you've been playing around behind my back, you're dead!""

Only after his repeated assurances did I end the call satisfied.

After hanging up, the weight lifted from my ch//est, and I was about to look for another postpartum center.

Suddenly, I received a call from Blake’s assistant. The person in charge of the company's new product launch had been in an accident on the way to the office.

Now the company was in chaos with no one to lead.

The assistant couldn't reach Blake, so she called me for help.

This launch was a critical turning point in our company's transformation and couldn't afford any mistakes.

After careful consideration, I decided to go to the company myself to resolve the immediate crisis.

Two hours later, I arrived at the company right on time.

The media was ready, but with no one to host the event, the assistant looked at me like I was her savior.

I told her to go to the hospital to check on the injured employee first, making sure they were okay before returning.

After she left, I composed myself, walked into the conference hall, and prepared for the press conference.

As soon as I entered the meeting room, several executives exchanged whispers upon seeing me.

I assumed they hadn't met me before, so I smiled and greeted them, but they surprisingly backed away in fear.

Ignoring this, I explained who I was and was about to announce the start of the launch.

Suddenly, there was a commotion as a woman stood up from the audience.

She pulled out a marriage certificate and waved it at the cameras.

""Miss, you claim to be the CEO's wife, so what does that make me?""

I was bewildered—this was the same woman from the postpartum center who had a ""marriage certificate"" with Blake!

How did she qualify to attend Jensen Group's product launch?

I didn't recognize this person, but looking closely, her clothes and the jewelry around her neck matched my style.

Especially that limited-edition bag she carried—Blake had waited in line for hours to buy it for me.

I was furious.

""Where's security? What's going on?""

A crowd of spectators flooded into the press conference, and online comments exploded with insults directed at me.

[Olivia is a famous influencer, and everyone knows how much her husband adores her. Can't believe some mistress is trying to steal her husband.]

[So when Olivia said an hour ago she was going to catch the other woman, it was true? And Olivia's husband is actually the CEO of the Jensen Group?]

Olivia Hayes smirked mockingly, opening her marriage certificate and shoving it toward the cameras.

""I've been married to my husband for five years. We're together every day. How did I not know he had someone else?""

As soon as she finished speaking, her fans attacked me like rabid dogs.

[Got pregnant with someone else's child and trying to scam your way up! The audacity!]

[You claim to be Mr. Jensen's wife? Show us your marriage certificate then.]

[Looking like that and thinking Mr. Jensen would love you? Makes me sick!]

I found it ridiculous. Blake and I had a legally protected marriage, and the child in my belly was certainly not illegitimate.

""Please stop slandering others. Blake and I are legally married, and we built this company together from scratch.""

I opened my phone to find a backup of our marriage certificate but couldn't locate it.

Then I remembered—in a moment of youthful impulsiveness, I had torn up our certificate right after getting it.

Now we were in the process of getting a replacement since we needed it to register our child.

As soon as I finished speaking, Olivia curved her lips into a smile:

""I knew she couldn't produce it, because I'm Blake Jensen's wife.""

The internet erupted in unified outrage.

[Yes, we've watched Olivia's account grow to where it is today. Mr. Jensen has always adored Olivia. How could he fall for this tramp?]

I was just confused. Blake was extremely busy with work, and what little free time he had was spent with me.

How could he possibly be involved with Olivia, let alone run a couple's social media account with her?

Seeing Olivia's mocking expression, I angrily challenged her:

""Your marriage certificate is fake. Forging government documents is a criminal offense.""

Seeing I still wouldn't give in, Olivia pulled out a stack of photos and threw them in my face.

They showed Blake's photographs from childhood to adulthood, with the two of them growing up together—the perfect childhood sweethearts.

At the same time, the conference room door opened, and a small boy walked in.

His features strongly resembled Blake's, even his bearing was remarkably similar.

""Mom, who's causing trouble at my dad's company?""

He navigated the company with ease, like someone who visited frequently, showing no signs of nervousness.

Immediately, the internet exploded with criticism.

[This kid looks 80% like Mr. Jensen! The evidence couldn't be clearer! Can this homewrecker stop destroying someone else's family?]

Olivia raised her head proudly, her eyes looking at me like I was garbage.

""Stop dreaming. I'm Blake's wife.""

""Be realistic—not everyone can marry into wealth and status.""

How was this possible? How could this child look so much like Blake?!

I was terrified inside, but remembering how attentive Blake had always been to me, I felt conflicted.

I frantically called Blake over a dozen times, but no one answered.

'Are you crazy? How dare you let someone bully your wife? You're asking for die?'

'Come out and clarify this now, or there'll be he//ll to pay.'

My blood was boiling, but I forced myself to stay calm.

A few hours earlier, Blake had looked exhausted—he was probably sleeping now.

He always silenced his phone while resting, so it wasn't surprising he couldn't answer.

So I called Tyler, Blake's best friend. They'd grown up together inseparably.

The call was picked up quickly on the other end. 

I turned on the speakerphon, ""Tyler, is Blake have someone else?""

Tyler, who must have been still sleeping in, woke up with a start upon hearing this.

""Ava! Who told you Blake was cheating?! Who's throwing around these false accusations?!""

""I swear on my life, Blake has never cheated. Ava, you're his only wife.""

Hearing this, I finally relaxed.

I played the call recording for everyone to hear. Tyler was a famous actor in the entertainment industry—he definitely wouldn't lie for me.

The online comments immediately split.

[That's Tyler Robertson! He has no reason to lie. Maybe this woman really is Mr. Jensen's wife.]

[Impossible! Olivia's child looks exactly like Mr. Jensen—it has to be his biological child.]

I raised an eyebrow:

""There are many similar-looking people in this world, and people can be deceitful.""

""Who knows if this child has had cosmetic surgery? You can't determine paternity by appearance alone.""

Seeing I still wouldn't yield, Olivia frowned, her lips curving into a mocking smile.

She took out her phone and video-called Blake, who answered instantly.

She projected the call onto the big screen of the press conference, and the next second, Blake's face appeared before my eyes.

That face that accompanied me daily—I knew it better than anyone.

He wouldn't answer my call but answered Olivia's immediately.

Rage surged through me, making me dizzy.

He'd better clarify this mess quickly, or I wouldn't let him come home easily.

But the next second, I froze.

Blake's voice was incredibly gentle:

""Honey, what are you doing?""

The little boy ran over, sweetly calling, ""Dad.""

Blake smiled, ""Have you been listening to your mom at home?""

The boy nodded, then his little face scrunched up as if remembering something.

""Yes, but someone keep making Mom angry. Today a woman claimed Mom was a homewrecker and embarrassed her in public.""

Hearing this, surprise flashed in Blake's eyes, quickly replaced by anger.

""What kind of nobody dares cause trouble at Jensen Group? My only wife is Olivia.""

""Olivia, fight back. I will support you.""

As he spoke, Olivia rushed up to me, raised her hand, and slapped me hard across the face.

""I've been patient with you, but you've gone too far. Now that I've proven myself, you should accept it.""

I stood there stunned, my face pale:

""That's impossible. He can't be Blake. Blake would never treat me this way.""

""Give me the phone! I need to ask him what's going on!""

I reached out to grab the phone, wanting to confront Blake privately.

But Olivia wouldn't give me the chance. Seeing me approach, panic flashed across her face.

She quickly backed away, then shouted at me:

""What are you doing?! This is my husband! Can't win the argument so you're getting physical?""

""Security! Is there any security? Get this tramp out of here!""

The scene descended into chaos. Security approached to remove me, but I clutched my belly and looked at them.

""I'm pregnant. If you dare touch me and something happens, will you take responsibility?!""

The security guards stopped when they saw my pregnant belly, looking at me helplessly:

""Miss, this is a press conference. Please leave.""

I was furious. ""Are you all blind? Can't you see who's really causing trouble?""

I didn't know what Olivia was plotting, but while the face in the video was Blake's, with today's advanced technology, AI face synthesis wasn't impossible.

Unless I saw the person standing in front of me, I wouldn't believe it.

As I was thinking, I suddenly remembered someone who could prove my identity.

""Right! My mother-in-law can confirm who I am.""

I frantically pulled out my phone, about to call Blake's mother. But after seeing Olivia, I put the screen down.

""If you claim to be Blake's wife, you must have his mother's number.""

""Blake isn't in the country right now. You can forge all the evidence you want, but it doesn't prove you're his wife.""

""If you're capable, call his mother here and see if she recognizes you as her daughter-in-law.""

Blake's mother was a renowned traditional painter who frequently appeared around the world.

No matter how bold Olivia was, she couldn't possibly find someone to impersonate my mother-in-law.

Moreover, my mother-in-law adored me so much. When I first married into the Jensen family, she gave me a family heirloom jade bracelet.

Whenever Blake and I argued, she always took my side and scolded Blake.

My mother-in-law treated me like her own daughter. During this pregnancy, she even sent me $50,000 to buy nutrients.

Olivia curved her lips, immediately mocking me,

""Still won't admit defeat? I guess you don't have her number?""

Before she finished speaking, she called my mother-in-law, her voice full of grievance.

""Mom, someone's causing trouble at the company, claiming I'm the other woman. Please come quickly and help me clear this up.""

Olivia put the call on speaker, and from the other end came a very familiar voice:

""Who dares to mess with my precious daughter-in-law? I'll come right away to support you.""

Instantly, the comments section erupted.

[No doubt about it, Olivia is definitely the legal wife. What mother-in-law would be so intimate with a fake?]

[Ava Sullivan is such a disgusting woman, always trying to marry up.]

[Even after being exposed, she still insists— So shameless.]

I looked at Olivia in disbelief as she waved her phone at me.

""Even my mother-in-law confirms I'm Blake's wife, yet you still don't believe it.""

My fists were clenched, my shoulders trembling uncontrollably.

""Mom, it's Ava. I'm your daughter-in-law. How can you help this outsider?""

Before I could finish, Olivia pulled the phone away and slapped me hard across the face.

""What are you yelling about? Who gave you permission to claim her as your mother?""

Olivia's voice turned plaintive as she whined to my mother-in-law.

""Mom, please come to the company and confirm my identity. Some tramp is trying to climb the social ladder.""

The person on the other end must be an impostor. I took out my phone and sent a WhatsApp message to my mother-in-law.

I briefly described today's events, hoping she would come to the company to confirm my identity.

My mother-in-law responded promptly, saying she would drive over immediately.

Given her temperament, Olivia would certainly be thrown out of the company when she arrived.

I just needed to wait for my mother-in-law—then the truth would be revealed.

Soon after, my mother-in-law's car stopped at the entrance.

She got out, moving slowly with her characteristic cane.

Seeing it was truly my mother-in-law, the weight in my heart lifted. I rushed forward to help her.

""Mom, you're finally here! Please explain to everyone that I'm your daughter-in-law!""

""This woman appeared out of nowhere with a child, claiming she's Blake’s wife!""

""They've been bullying me! Please don't let them get away with it!""

My mother-in-law removed her glasses to look at me, examining me for a few minutes before displaying her familiar smile.

I breathed a sigh of relief, thankful that she could confirm my identity.

I looked at Olivia with triumph in my eyes.

This time, I would make sure she was thoroughly disgraced.

But the next second, my mother-in-law pushed my hand away and walked toward Olivia, affectionately calling her ""daughter-in-law.""

Then she turned to me, her lips twisted in mockery:

""I know you. You're the one who sneaked into my son's bed!""

""Back then, you weren't pregnant yet. My son didn't want you and tried to dress you and send you away.""

""I never expected you'd be so desperate that you'd try to sleep with the mansion's butler.""

The room suddenly went cold. I stood frozen, my eyes filled with disbelief.

""This can't be. You must be fake.""

The online commenters were shocked by my reaction.

[How shameless can she be? Not only does she doubt her husband is real, but now she's claiming his mother is fake too?]

[So the baby in her belly is a illegitimate child, but she's got the nerve to try to use it to climb the ladder?]

My mother-in-law brushed back her bangs, revealing a transparent scar on her temple. I remembered the origin of this scar—she had accidentally bumped into a counter on my wedding day.

How could a fake mother-in-law have that? This impostor must be someone close to my mother-in-law to observe such details.

The old woman approached me, raising her hand and slapping me hard across the face.

""What do you mean? I didn't know I had a daughter-in-law who climbs into other people's beds.""

“Olivia is my only daughter-in-law. Carrying a child of unknown paternity and trying to confuse our Jensen family bloodline—how shameless.”

I broke down screaming, ""Impossible, absolutely impossible.""

""My mother-in-law has always been good to me. She would never speak like this. You're definitely an impostor.""

Looking at my hysterical state, Olivia repeatedly clicked her tongue. ""How long are you going to keep this up? Is it so hard to accept your own mediocrity?""

""All the evidence points to me. Even Mrs. Jensen has confirmed it. Can you just take your bas//tard and leave?""

My mother-in-law had always been loving toward me. Looking at that familiar face, I could hardly accept reality.

""She's definitely not my mother-in-law. She would never treat me like this.""

I remembered when I had a high fever a while back when Blake was on a business trip abroad. It was my mother-in-law who fed me medicine spoonful by spoonful and stayed up with me for several nights without changing her clothes.

Throughout my pregnancy, when morning sickness prevented me from eating, it was also my mother-in-law who continuously cared for me, thinking of ways to prepare the foods I loved.

My mother-in-law had always been elegant and would never publicly utter such reputation-destroying words.

Now everything had changed.

Calling the police—only they could confirm my identity now.

Sweat dripped from my forehead as I frantically pulled out my phone, about to dial 911. But my mother-in-law knocked the phone from my hand.

""You shameless woman, don't you know Jensen Group is at a critical development stage? Are you trying to destroy my son?""

My mother-in-law was right—Jensen Group was indeed facing some serious issues.

I grew fearful, thankful I hadn't completed the emergency call, or Blake would have been caught in a whirlwind of public opinion.

My mother-in-law had always been gentle and would never curse at anyone, which strengthened my conviction.

""You must be fake. I will expose your disguise.""

As soon as I said this, Olivia could no longer contain herself. She rushed at me, and we began to struggle.

""You dare to covet my man repeatedly? Believe me, I can make you and your bast//ard disappear with just a snap of my fingers.""

As soon as she finished speaking, the bodyguards my mother-in-law had brought surrounded me. They kicked and hit my limbs while I desperately tried to protect my unborn child.

While I was thinking, Olivia grabbed my hair and slapped me hard several times.

""Even if you die, the most it would cost us is some compensation money.""

""Security, throw this tramp out.""

I was protecting my unborn child when Olivia shoved me hard to the ground.

My mother-in-law rushed over, kicking my belly.

""Slut, I've tolerated you for too long.""

""I'll let everyone see what a seductress you are.""

Intense pain swept through me. I tried to curl up to protect myself, but she grabbed my hair and slapped me hard across the face.

She cursed, ""Shameless thing, daring to climb into my son's bed, you're disgusting.""

""Trying to ruin my son's happiness—go to death!""

I was in so much pain that tears fell from my eyes, but faced with so many attackers, I was helpless.

The next moment, I felt a hot stream flow from my lower abdomen as excruciating pain engulfed my body.

I screamed:

""The baby—I'm losing my baby—""

""Someone call 911!""

My mother-in-law stood to the side with her arms crossed:

""A sl//ut trying to use a baby to get in the door—why don't you just die?""

Olivia slapped me even harder.

""Shameless thing! Losing a child is nothing for someone like you. Keep crying and I'll have security throw you in the deep mountains.""

Then the next second, the conference room door was kicked open—

I heard Blake's voice roaring in fury.

""STOP IT! GET AWAY FROM MY WIFE!""

Clearly, coffee and I do not get along well.

... But maybe you and I can get along well for lunch today? I'm a vegetarian so that filters down a good number of options; I've got a few go-to places in mind around the area but I'm also open to trying something new as long as it's within the area. I'm aiming for an early lunch (11 AM) or late(r) lunch (1 PM) just to avoid the majority of the lunch crowd, but that is also up for discussion.

About me:
- working in the financial services sector despite being a history + lit + philo + art grad
- lives up to the username
- shy but would like some company... but I also like eating alone sometimes
- a little bit awkward but I warm up quickly when there's a good conversation 
- leaning more towards intellectual + serious than goofy/amusing/funny
- primarily speaking English (I can understand Spanish and Tagalog but I express myself best in English)
- some people say I have a nice voice
- not from Metro Manila, just coming here for work twice a week
- kind of a slow eater... sorry...
- can I give you a (side) hug?

About you / my preferences:
- my age or a little bit older
- conversationalist
- English speaker
- eager to make a new acquaintance 
- patient with my eating and walking pace
- it's okay if you aren't vegetarian

I’m a 24yo(M) from Paraguay and I’m planning a 13-day trip this May through **Brussels, Amsterdam, Prague, Budapest, and Vienna**. I’ll be traveling with my family, but I’m planning to explore each city on my own. I’m an only child and way younger than the rest, so I’m hoping to have my own experience separate from theirs.

I’ve already booked **my hotels and all transportation between cities**, so the main logistics are done.

13 days total:  
\-2 nights in Brussels  
\-3 nights in Amsterdam  
\-2 nights in Prague  
\-3 nights in Budapest  
\-2 nights in Vienna

Here’s a bit about me and what I’m looking for:

**1. Experience a bit of the life in each city**

I want to experience the essence of each city not just the tourist checklist. I’d love to discover local spots, unique experiences, lesser-known museums, historic neighborhoods and traditional markets. I am well aware that people in most of those cities are tired of us tourist I still want to try some of the touristy things that spark a bit of interest.

**2. Culinary recommendations**

I'm a big fan of the culinary arts. In Paraguay, we’re proud of the dishes that represent us, and I’d love to know what those are in your countries or cities. What should I eat that truly speaks to your identity? What places do locals actually go to? Preferably not too expensive places.

**3. Meeting people / Making friends**

I've had a couple of solo travel experiences and the highlight in most of them were the people I've met. I’m hoping to connect with people during this trip too ideally in casual ways. If you know good social spaces, walking tours, hangouts, events, or hostels (even if I’m not staying there) where people tend to connect, I’d love to hear about them.

**4. Dating while traveling**

I’ve been wondering whether it’s worth trying to go on some dates during the trip. Not looking for anything serious more like enjoying a day or evening with someone I connect with, walking around a new city, talking, and maybe getting to know their perspective. Do you think this is realistic? Or is it too much of a long shot? Would you recommend any way of going about this (apps, bars, social events), or should I just let it happen naturally if it does?

**5. Budgeting**

I already covered accommodation and transport. For everything else food, activities, entrance fees, casual shopping, maybe a night out or two. what’s a realistic daily budget for each of these cities? I want to be comfortable without wasting too much money.

**6. Must-do activities or places**

I’d really appreciate any recommendations — not just the usual tourist attractions, but anything that made you think *“I’m really glad I didn’t miss this.”* Could be a museum, a small street, a viewpoint, a café, a park, a cultural event, or even a specific neighborhood you think I’d enjoy walking through.

**7. Nightlife**

I’m not trying to party hard every night because I want to be functional in the mornings, but I’m open to going out in a few cities if it feels worth it. So if there’s a bar, event, or experience that really stands out or is iconic for one of these cities, I’d like to know about it. I bought a ticket for the Tyler, the creator concert in Amsterdam, I was wondering if it's worth it to go alone or should I just sell my ticket and find some other fun experience. I also bought a ticket for the Don diablo concert in Prague but although it sounds like a very fun experience I'm a little worried that I will be alone in there. What do you guys think? I was a little tempted to do a bar crawl in each city but I saw that a lot of locals hate that and I really don't want to bother them so it might be better to rest a bit or to go have dinner with my family.

**8. Safety and being alone**

Since I’ll mostly be alone, I’m naturally a bit cautious. I’ve traveled solo before, but never this long or to these cities. I’d appreciate any advice on staying safe, avoiding tourist traps or sketchy situations, and reading the vibe of a place before walking in. I don’t want to be paranoid, but I also want to avoid bad experiences. Are there areas I should avoid, scams to look out for, or general habits I should adopt while walking around or using public transport? I kind of what to go to a coffee shop in Amsterdam but I don't know if it's worth to spend a day like that but still, what do you guys think? which do you recommend? I also want to see some of the adult entertainment in the and try some of the wilder things that I can't try anywhere else.

I’ll be grateful for any tips, stories, or personal insights. Whether it’s practical stuff or something deeper, I’m open to all kinds of advice. If anyone is going to be in those cities in May and wants to connect, feel free to message me.

Tanzania has long been a linchpin of spice cultivation and production, a phenomenon reflected in its food cultures. To think more with this history, I decided to choose one (or two…) spice/s grown in Tanzania and find dishes that highlighted them. Luckily for me, Tanzania, at one point, had been one of world’s busiest producers of cardamom, which is my favorite spice. Thus, my homage to cardamom with plate of crispy-fluffy Mandazi and a glass of Zanzibar spiced coffee. To compromise with my husband who is not a cardamom guy, I incorporated some black pepper in each.

For a bit of context.

I (20F) moved house with my parents roughly 6 months ago, to just outside the small country town we already resided in.
We bought a small farm so we could run our business and keep our trucks whilst living on the land in a freshly renovated house.
From my bedroom windows you can see the back yard and the main shed which can be a thorough fair during the day, with workers, and occasionally customers, milling about and coming to pick things up.

One day a few months ago, I had finished work and was sitting in my room, noise cancelling headphones on, watching a video.
Everyone had gone home for the day and I was the only person home with our 3 dogs, both parents had headed into town for a meeting. Suddenly, I hear this blood curdling scream of a woman, (it was not the video, I went back and checked) I jump out of bed and and rip my blind open to see no one at the shed, so I investigate further and go for a walk around part of our property. (Usually I'm very sensible, I would not be the first to die in a horror film, but this truly sounded like someone in touble), fortunately and unfortunately I find no one, a little freaked out and very confused I head back to the house and mention nothing of it.

Around 2 weeks later, Mum had come home from work in town and asked if I had been outside, I said 'No, I've been in my room reading, I didn't know you were home, why's that'?, she tells me she saw a pair of long legs walk outside across the length of our lounge room windows which take up most of the wall (about 6 meters), however we had the blinds half down to keep the evening sun out, who knows if it was a full body, I'm really not keen to find out. So again a little freaked out, we mention nothing of it.

A few weeks later, Mum and I are in the back yard doing some gardening when I hear another scream, I whip my head around to see 2 of our dogs also looking in the same direction, Mum is mostly deaf so she heard nothing but saw my expression, and aksed if i was okay. I know all the sound of the native birds and animals in the area and this was nothing like an animal. The closest I can compare it to is a screaming fox, but it was too human like, and sounded both far away but insanely close, almost right next to me at the same time, I really can't explain it.
Very freaked out this time I ignore it, a little relieved in the fact that I'm not going insane, because my dogs heard it too.

One last one about 4 days ago, I was in the kitchen baking, we have two massive windows that look out our front yard, right next to our door. Out the corner of my eye, I see a figure walk across both windows, thinking it's my Dad coming in for coffee I wait for the door to unlock, but nothing. So I peek outside, and there was no one, not even our workers. I check the ring doorbell and see nothing. Which means that the figure must have been inside.

The only reason that the house could be haunted is either A, my Grandparents RIP, or B, the land would have been very busy back in the day for transporting livestock, and the possibilities of a Sheppard dying out here are quite high.
Also our dogs always stare at corners, constantly, and are always on guard
Sorry for that long one, these are just a few experiences we've had after a few months at the new house.

We went for coffee in the morning, it went on for about an hour and a half. Conversation flowed easy and she seemed to have a good time.

At the end of the date we hugged and I said I’d like to see her again. She said yes and said she would text me later. 

About an hour later she text me first saying thanks so much for the date, that she had a really good time meeting me and getting to know me better. She wished me luck with a few things I had on for the rest of the day.

I was busy so text her about an hour later that I really enjoyed meeting her too and would definitely like to see her again. I asked her what her schedule was like for next week.

It’s been 6 hours later and I’ve had no reply from her.

1jideip,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jideip/the_reflection_part_3/,The Reflection [Part 3],"I wake up to the sound of my alarm blaring at 6:30 AM, just like every other miserable morning. But today, something’s off. Not in a major, reality-shattering way—just… off. My phone is fully charged even though I forgot to plug it in last night. My clothes are already laid out on the chair by my bed, neatly folded. And when I stumble into the bathroom, still half-asleep, the mirror is spotless.

Which is weird, because I distinctly remember smudging it up last night while brushing my teeth.

I tell myself I must’ve wiped it down without thinking and move on. I don’t have time to dwell on minor inconsistencies—especially when I’m already late for work.

The next few days follow the same unsettling pattern. My keys, which I always lose, are right where I need them. My bank account, which should’ve been overdrawn, suddenly has just enough to cover rent. The coffee machine starts brewing before I even touch it.

I should be relieved. But I’m not.

Because every morning, when I step in front of the mirror, something feels wrong. My reflection doesn’t move out of sync—not yet—but there’s a tension in the way it stares back. An expectation.

I don’t acknowledge it. I refuse to.

Then, the messages started.

The first one appears on my bathroom mirror after a hot shower: “I KNOW YOU SEE ME.” Written in the condensation, the letters drip like they’ve been carved out of the fog.

I wiped it away.

The next day, another message: *“WHY WON’T YOU ANSWER?”*

And another: “I CAN HELP.”

I start brushing my teeth without looking at the mirror at all. If I don’t react, if I don’t give it what it wants, maybe it’ll get bored and leave me alone.

Spoiler: it doesn’t.

The messages stop being limited to my bathroom. I see them in car windows, on the glass doors at work, even faintly traced into the reflection of my phone screen. Smudges appear on my mirrors—handprints, but not mine. Sometimes the reflection lags for half a second too long, just enough to make my stomach drop before I force myself to ignore it.

But it’s getting harder to ignore.

The reflection watches me now, its gaze heavier than before. When I glance at it too quickly, I think I see its expression shift—just slightly, just enough to unsettle. The corners of its mouth twitch, its eyes flicker with something I can’t name. Something I don’t want to name.

Then, one night, I snap.

I’m exhausted, running on caffeine fumes, and just barely managed to avoid getting fired that day. I step into the bathroom and—of course—there’s another message waiting for me.

“PLEASE.”

That’s it. Just one word, desperate and insistent.

My chest tightens. It’s not just a message. It’s a plea.

I don’t know what comes over me, but I grab the nearest towel and furiously wipe the mirror. “No. I don’t know what you want, but I don’t have time for this.”

For the first time since this started, my reflection doesn’t match me.

It just stands there, staring. And then, slowly, it smiles.

The light flickers.

And in that split second of darkness, I swear to god, I hear something whisper:

*“Now we’re getting somewhere.”*

1jide62,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jide62/need_some_advice/,Need some advice,"I’ve been in a long term relationship
But recently have been feeling very over it. there are many situations that have been pilling up bit by bit. 


My partner recently has been studying. So to help out 
I  go to the supermarket most frequently so I buy food and come home and cook the food and then also clean up so he can focus on the course. 

Around 2 weeks I was non stop cooking, cleaning and going to the shops and spending my money on food for us.

When his exams finished, we went to the supermarket and I expected him to pay for the groceries as he never once offered to send the money. He then went to say “ are you going to make me pay this time??” 

I reminded him of how I looked after him during exams and was hoping he could cover us this time. He reminded me of the time he paid for our groceries over 1 month ago and said that I need to buy my own. So I split our groceries and went into another checkout and brought my own.. 

Every day I ask him if he wants me to make him a coffee and I do. 
However if I ever ask him to make me a coffee, because it requires an extra step to add milk, he just lets the coffee machine run and tells me to do that part myself. And never brings the coffee to me. 

After coming back from travelling I felt a bit down a few weeks and my bad mood did rub of and I was occasionally short with my partner. He eventually had enough and said why did I come back such a cunt and eventually said that he saw no value in our relationship. 
Since we have never spoke about this argument and left it as is. But it hurt me, because I do actually do a lot. 

Another instance was international women’s day. I kept telling him in my culture women get flowers on this day and it’s an expectation for women to get some.  He told me that he would only give me flowers if I went to the gym.. 
mind you I’m an athletic person, that day I got my period and wasn’t planning on going. Also why should I be given conditions on receiving flowers?? 


Another thing he does is randomly come lie on top of me and start trying to touch my nipples or he’ll just lay on me and crush me with his weight as I’m half his height and body weight. He for some reason enjoys pinning me down and laying on top of me  so i feel trapped. I hate when he does this and I’ve communicated it multiple times that it makes me feel trapped and I don’t like it. Yet every single time he keeps doing it until I tell him to get off and then he says “you don’t let me touch you or get close to you” 


I’ve tried talking multiple times to sort through our issues , but most often he stone walls and tells me I’m rude and 
I ask how and he says it’s not worth explaining if I don’t understand and then our talks go nowhere because he doesn’t see a point in continuing the conversation to figure out where I can show up and improve and be a better partner.. 

I can keep naming lots of these built up scenarios that have been happening but I’ll leave it here. I guess I don’t really have anyone to talk to to get real advice on what I should do and if it’s really time to just move on.

5 years ago I met a man 37 years older than me. He lives 2 minutes from my house and we met at the dog park during Covid. He is divorced and living alone. We spent a lot of time chatting on a daily basis over a years time. Eventually we started walking our dogs together and formed a really lovely friendship despite the age gap and different sex.

Over the years we became good friends. My husband and I invited him to our wedding, I hooked him up with a friend’s mom and I invited him to a few of my family gatherings. I would go over to his place to hang out over coffee or a glass of wine and we’d chat like old friends. It was great. 

Until last year my husband started a new job that requires lots of shift work and no starting vacation. I was bored at home alone and would go to my friends every night. I ended up tagging along on a vacation down south with him and a friend which was fun. My husband was ok with it. I got my own room and did my own thing, I just didn’t want to be completely alone as a woman. But after that trip, my friend broke it off with his girlfriend and we became very close emotionally. Now looking back, too close. And I fully admit it was wrong the emotional attachment we created. 

I had no life with my husband because of his job so I spent most of my summer with my old man friend. We spent an inappropriate amount of time together. By the fall, I was starting to really feel like it was wrong. Then my friend told me he had feelings for me. That made me feel very uncomfortable. And I realized I had been his platonic girlfriend for the better part of a year. I started to feel less and less comfortable with spending time with him. My husband told me he also thought it was too much which was the straw that broke the camels back. He was always supportive of our friendship so when he told me that, it broke my heart. I knew this weird emotional affair/attachment friendship needed to change fast. 

I was turning a new leaf in my life and was going on a month long trip to Oceania with family. Weeks before leaving I was trying to pull away but being as transparent as possible. Talked with my therapist about it and my husband. He completely understood my need to separate myself from him, as we both agreed lines were crossed. 

During my trip away and since I’ve been back for two months, it’s been hell for us. He guilted me for not “missing him” and not asking him how he was doing when I was 18 time zones away. He’s making comments about my other friends I spend time with from the park instead of him, he’s putting expectations on me while not knowing what he wants and he says he feels like I’ve removed him from my life. My husband says he’s going through a breakup. The truth is, is that we still hang out, we still see each other regularly at the park. I reassure him our friendship isn’t over, just the dynamics of it has changed. 

So I need your advice. I know I fucked up in becoming too emotionally invested and attached to him. We got too close. But now it’s this situation and I need your advice! ",2,1742773715.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

I just had to share my experience with **Limini Coffee** because it’s honestly changed the way I brew coffee at home. I’ve been a coffee enthusiast for years, always on the hunt for the best beans to brew, and I think I’ve finally found the perfect one.

Here’s what I love about Limini:

1. **Rich & Smooth Flavor**: I’ve tried so many brands, but Limini stands out for its smoothness without losing the bold, rich flavor I love. It’s not bitter at all, and the taste is super balanced. Whether I’m making espresso or just a regular cup, it’s consistently fantastic.

2. **Versatile**: I’ve brewed it in several ways—espresso, pour-over, and even cold brew—and it holds up perfectly every time. It’s one of the few coffees I’ve found that’s so adaptable while still delivering great taste.

3. **Specialty-Grade Beans**: I was a little skeptical at first, but after trying Limini, I can honestly say the quality of the beans really makes a difference. You can tell they’re roasted with care, and it shows in the flavor profile.

I’ve been using it for about a month now, and it’s become my go-to coffee for every brew. If you’re someone who cares about getting the best flavor from your coffee at home (without spending a ton), Limini is definitely worth checking out.

Anyone else here tried Limini Coffee? What did you think? Or if you have a favorite coffee brand you swear by, let me know—I’m always on the lookout for new coffees to try!

I’m 33, 6’0”, and living in Maine, where the trees outnumber people. Fun fact: Maine has the deepest lake in New England, Sebago Lake, which plunges down to 316 feet. It’s the kind of place where hidden gems are just waiting to be discovered, much like me.

Now, onto me:
Personality: Imagine a mix of dark humor, laid-back vibes, and a slightly Gothic twist. That’s me. I’m the guy who enjoys the irony in horror movies and laughs at life’s absurdities. But don’t worry, I’m not all doom and gloom; I just appreciate life from a different angle. If you’re into sarcasm and don’t take life too seriously, we’ll get along just fine.

Hobbies: If you like comedy and horror flicks, we’ll have plenty to binge-watch together. I’m also a gamer with a PS5, currently surviving Call of Duty. Not a gamer? No big deal, I’m open to trying new things and sharing different interests. I think it’s exciting when two people can introduce each other to new experiences.

Bonus points if you enjoy laid-back mornings. I’m all about lazy Sundays, relaxing, and making memories over shared experiences.

What I’m looking for:
Connection: I’m drawn to women who speak their mind and aren’t afraid to get real. Whether we’re vibing over shared interests or learning from our differences, I’m here for it. If you’ve got a sharp wit and a playful side, I’ll be hooked.

Consistency: I want someone who’s invested in making our connection strong every single day, no ghosting, no playing games. Consistent effort and genuine affection are non-negotiable for me. If you’re the type who stays engaged and interested, we’ll have something real and lasting.

Energy: I believe that making an effort is sexy. Let’s start with a voice or video chat. It’s more personal and fun than just texting. Plus, if we’re willing to step out of our comfort zones, who knows what kind of adventures we could end up on together?

Open-Mindedness: I’m open to long-distance relationships and even the idea of living in another state or country someday, as long as we can visit each other and build our connection. I’m not looking for a mirror image of myself. In fact, I think it’s way more fun if we’re a bit different. It keeps things interesting, and it means we’ll never run out of things to talk about or do together.

Let’s be real, physical attraction matters. I believe in being upfront and getting that out of the way early. Let’s exchange pictures as soon as possible so we can both know if we feel that spark. It’s important to me to build something genuine, and that starts with knowing there’s mutual attraction.

I also love cuddling, watching movies, and being affectionate. I want a partner who’s not afraid to express themselves emotionally and intimately. Deep conversations, daily texting, and phone calls are my kind of connection. If you’re the kind of person who loves to share their feelings and stay close, we’ll be a great match.

The Essentials:
I’ve got a job and my life together, and I’m hoping you do too. A solid work ethic is a major turn-on for me. I’ve done the long-distance thing before, so if you’re from another state or even another country, no worries, we can make it work if the chemistry is there.

1jidabf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1jidabf/33_m4f_maineusa_looking_for_something_serious/,33 [M4F] #Maine/USA - Looking For Something Serious,"Hey, I’m Jake, your future partner in crime (or at least in video games).

I’m 33, 6’0”, and living in Maine, where the trees outnumber people. Fun fact: Maine has the deepest lake in New England, Sebago Lake, which plunges down to 316 feet. It’s the kind of place where hidden gems are just waiting to be discovered, much like me.

Now, onto me:
Personality: Imagine a mix of dark humor, laid-back vibes, and a slightly Gothic twist. That’s me. I’m the guy who enjoys the irony in horror movies and laughs at life’s absurdities. But don’t worry, I’m not all doom and gloom; I just appreciate life from a different angle. If you’re into sarcasm and don’t take life too seriously, we’ll get along just fine.

Hobbies: If you like comedy and horror flicks, we’ll have plenty to binge-watch together. I’m also a gamer with a PS5, currently surviving Call of Duty. Not a gamer? No big deal, I’m open to trying new things and sharing different interests. I think it’s exciting when two people can introduce each other to new experiences.

Bonus points if you enjoy laid-back mornings. I’m all about lazy Sundays, relaxing, and making memories over shared experiences.

What I’m looking for:
Connection: I’m drawn to women who speak their mind and aren’t afraid to get real. Whether we’re vibing over shared interests or learning from our differences, I’m here for it. If you’ve got a sharp wit and a playful side, I’ll be hooked.

Consistency: I want someone who’s invested in making our connection strong every single day, no ghosting, no playing games. Consistent effort and genuine affection are non-negotiable for me. If you’re the type who stays engaged and interested, we’ll have something real and lasting.

Energy: I believe that making an effort is sexy. Let’s start with a voice or video chat. It’s more personal and fun than just texting. Plus, if we’re willing to step out of our comfort zones, who knows what kind of adventures we could end up on together?

Open-Mindedness: I’m open to long-distance relationships and even the idea of living in another state or country someday, as long as we can visit each other and build our connection. I’m not looking for a mirror image of myself. In fact, I think it’s way more fun if we’re a bit different. It keeps things interesting, and it means we’ll never run out of things to talk about or do together.

Let’s be real, physical attraction matters. I believe in being upfront and getting that out of the way early. Let’s exchange pictures as soon as possible so we can both know if we feel that spark. It’s important to me to build something genuine, and that starts with knowing there’s mutual attraction.

I also love cuddling, watching movies, and being affectionate. I want a partner who’s not afraid to express themselves emotionally and intimately. Deep conversations, daily texting, and phone calls are my kind of connection. If you’re the kind of person who loves to share their feelings and stay close, we’ll be a great match.

The Essentials:
I’ve got a job and my life together, and I’m hoping you do too. A solid work ethic is a major turn-on for me. I’ve done the long-distance thing before, so if you’re from another state or even another country, no worries, we can make it work if the chemistry is there.

I’m looking for someone to join me in discovering the best hidden spots in town, whether it’s a new coffee shop, a haunted house, or the perfect hiking trail. Let’s make some memories together.

But recently have been feeling very over it. there are many situations that have been pilling up bit by bit. 




My partner recently has been studying. So to help out 
I  go to the supermarket most frequently so I buy food and come home and cook the food and then also clean up so he can focus on the course. 

Around 2 weeks I was non stop cooking, cleaning and going to the shops and spending my money on food for us.

When his exams finished, we went to the supermarket and I expected him to pay for the groceries as he never once offered to send the money. He then went to say “ are you going to make me pay this time??” 

I reminded him of how I looked after him during exams and was hoping he could cover us this time. He reminded me of the time he paid for our groceries over 1 month ago and said that I need to buy my own. So I split our groceries and went into another checkout and brought my own.. 

Every day I ask him if he wants me to make him a coffee and I do. 
However if I ever ask him to make me a coffee, because it requires an extra step to add milk, he just lets the coffee machine run and tells me to do that part myself. And never brings the coffee to me. 

After coming back from travelling I felt a bit down a few weeks and my bad mood did rub of and I was occasionally short with my partner. He eventually had enough and said why did I come back such a cunt and eventually said that he saw no value in our relationship. 
Since we have never spoke about this argument and left it as is. But it hurt me, because I do actually do a lot. 

Another instance was international women’s day. I kept telling him in my culture women get flowers on this day and it’s an expectation for women to get some.  He told me that he would only give me flowers if I went to the gym.. 
mind you I’m an athletic person, that day I got my period and wasn’t planning on going. Also why should I be given conditions on receiving flowers?? 


Another thing he does is randomly come lie on top of me and start trying to touch my nipples or he’ll just lay on me and crush me with his weight as I’m half his height and body weight. He for some reason enjoys pinning me down and laying on top of me  so i feel trapped. I hate when he does this and I’ve communicated it multiple times that it makes me feel trapped and I don’t like it. Yet every single time he keeps doing it until I tell him to get off and then he says “you don’t let me touch you or get close to you” 


I’ve tried talking multiple times to sort through our issues , but most often he stone walls and tells me I’m rude and 
I ask how and he says it’s not worth explaining if I don’t understand and then our talks go nowhere because he doesn’t see a point in continuing the conversation to figure out where I can show up and improve and be a better partner.. 

I can keep naming lots of these built up scenarios that have been happening but I’ll leave it here. I guess I don’t really have anyone to talk to to get real advice on. Am I the asshole or Should I move on? ",2,1742773426.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

I have a question, i looked around a bit and the general consensus is use your phone hotspot. Im hoping for a better solution/different options. The house i live in activly blocks wifi. I live somewhere were they do not provide home internet. Its literally 200 feet to either side of my house, but not here. Go figure. The only way for me to get internet is to put my phone in the highest window i can and leave it there, never touching it. Infact, i work mostly upstairs, and the roof is even better. Thats not a graat solution when you also need your phone for anything. Not to mention the hotspot on my phone is, frankly, pretty weak.

I was wondering if anyone has an idea on what i could do here? Satellite internet is an option but its expensive and from what ive heard not really better.

## What Nespresso Vertuo ⁢Pods Does Costco⁣ Actually Carry?

The landscape of Nespresso Vertuo pods at Costco can be a little confusing. it's not always as straightforward as ⁣simply finding every Vertuo ‍pod flavor lining the shelves. While availability can vary by location and online,here's a general overview of what you can typically expect to find when searching for Nespresso Vertuo pods at Costco:

*  ‍ **Starbucks‌ by Nespresso Vertuo Line:** This is a common sight‌ at Costco. These pods are produced by Nespresso under license from Starbucks and are specifically designed for Vertuo ⁢machines. You'll often find variety packs containing diffrent Starbucks blends,allowing you to ⁢sample various flavors without committing to a large quantity of a single type. Options such as the Starbucks Vertuo Line Variety pack provide a⁤ selection of roasts‌ and sizes, making them a versatile choice for households with varying coffee preferences.
*   **Occasionally, nespresso Branded Vertuo‌ Pods:** While less frequent,‍ Costco sometimes carries Nespresso-branded Vertuo pods directly.​ These might be offered as part of a special promotion ‌or‌ seasonal selection. Keep an eye out, especially during holiday periods, for potential deals on these sought-after pods.
*   **Online Availability vs. Warehouse:** It's important to note that the availability of Nespresso Vertuo pods online at costco might differ from what you find in your local warehouse. ‌Checking the Costco‍ website or app before heading to the store can save you time and frustration. Costco online Nespresso vertuo options often‌ include a broader selection than physical​ locations.

*   **Compare to Nespresso Directly:**⁤ Compare this per-pod ​cost to the price you'd pay when purchasing​ directly from ⁣Nespresso's website or boutiques.‍ Nespresso often sells their pods in sleeves of 10, and the price per sleeve varies depending on the blend. However, you ‌can typically expect to pay more per⁤ pod buying directly from Nespresso (without factoring in their ​potential promotions) than ⁢buying ⁣Starbucks vertuo line pods from Costco.
*   **Factor in Costco Membership:** Don't forget to factor in the annual cost of your Costco membership. If you only buy Nespresso pods from Costco,the membership fee might negate the savings. However, if you regularly shop at Costco for other items, the savings on Nespresso pods are just ‍an added⁣ bonus.
* ⁣  **watch for Sales and‍ Promotions:** Costco frequently runs sales and promotions, including discounts on Nespresso Vertuo pods. Keep an eye out for these deals, as‌ they can considerably reduce the per-pod cost.Checking for vertuo‌ pods on sale costco is a smart strategy.
*   **Consider Bulk buying:** Costco's⁣ strength⁤ lies in bulk​ buying. The more you buy, the more you generally save.If you're a heavy Nespresso user,⁣ buying Nespresso Vertuo pods in bulk at Costco can‍ lead to substantial savings over time.
*   **Costco Buisness Center:** Check if you have access to a Costco Business Center.⁣ these warehouses often carry​ different and sometimes larger quantities of Nespresso Vertuo pods at potentially better prices. The Costco business center nespresso vertuo pods selection can be worth exploring.

I am a proud enjoyed of the outdoors as a west coast (United States) native! I love to hike around, kayak, paddle board, spend days at the lake, etc. I keep a garden. Honestly if I'm doing something I'd prefer to do it outside!

I also have indoor hobbies too lol I love video games and making art! I like to read (mostly fiction) and watching anime. Unfortunately not a big TV person unless it's the really bad reality ones. Recently started playing dnd and magic the gathering! 

I like live music, having new foods, learning about local wildlife, using my hands to make stuff! Overall, I get a lot of enjoyment out of trying new things and I love trying hobbies. Crochet is hard, sewings fun, and I understand unfortunately little about coding lol but I would love to hear about your favorite Thing!

I love animals and have an elderly dog, a big cat, a few chickens, and a baby tarantula. I am horrific with names. I volunteer at a bunny rescue when I find the time. And am a long term vegetarian!

I collect cds, lps, and only the cutest stuffed  animals. I enjoy coffee and tea and honestly I think I just like a good beverage. 

I am very left politically. I can't smoke and rarely drink (but I do like to go out and play pool, sing karaoke, dance). I love to listen but equally love to talk if you're interested.

And that's kinda all I can think of right now! Ask questions, let's talk! I'm looking for someone who is kind and willing to come along on my adventures if possible (or is excited to hear about it Later). Long distance is okay and I don't have a gender preference :)

1jict3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1jict3d/the_red_dress/,The Red Dress,"I always loved how thoughtful Lucas was.

From the start, he noticed the little things, how I liked black tea with honey, how I preferred the center seat in movie theaters. A month into dating, he gave me a gold bracelet. When I moved in, he added a matching anklet, saying it made him happy knowing I wore a piece of his “heart.”

Tidying the bedroom, I smiled. Life with Lucas felt easy, calm, controlled. My past relationships were chaotic, full of heartache. But this? This was peace.

I opened a drawer to put away socks. As it closed, I heard a faint clink. Curious, I reached toward the back and pulled out a chipped coffee mug. A faded photo of me and two vaguely familiar faces. I froze.

From the living room, Lucas’s phone buzzed. He was in the backyard.

Still holding the mug, I picked up his phone to take it to him, but a Reddit notification caught my eye: **""Bathroom – San Antonio.""**

Lucas was usually protective of his phone, but something told me to open it.

The post showed a bathroom counter. Toothbrush. Lotion. Everything arranged with obsessive precision.

Then I saw his last post—it was the mug I was holding.

I opened his camera roll. Mundane images. Some familiar. Some not. Then photos of me, from a distance, clearly unaware, but all taken at my old apartment and dated before I ever met Lucas.

Hands shaking, I returned to Reddit.

A new post hovered at the top: **""Red Dress – Detroit.""**

A red dress, laid out on a bed. I walked to the closet, it looked similar to a dress Lucas gave me last week. I pulled it down. Almost identical. What was going on?

My bracelet felt suddenly tight on my wrist. My anklet didn’t feel delicate anymore. It was cold. Heavy. I looked down and saw a small seam on the side I hadn’t noticed before.

I ran to the bathroom mirror. I barely recognized myself, sunken cheeks, hollow eyes. The necklace he gave me had a clasp too. A chain. A lock.

Behind me, Lucas appeared in the doorway, expression unreadable.

“What do you see, Emma?” he asked softly.

“What is this?” I clawed at the bracelet. No, handcuff.

He sighed. “Let me make you some tea. That always helps calm you down.”

“It’s in the tea…” I thought, staring at the red dress still clutched in my hands.

“Why me?”

“Because you look like her,” he smiled. “Well, almost. You’re my best version yet.”

Behind him, I noticed a door I hadn’t seen before. Steel. Keypad. I’d realised I’d never left this house syncing moving in. Not once.

Lucas stepped forward. “Let’s get your tea. Time to finish the final stage.”

Stepping back, dress in one hand, a cup of tea suddenly in the other. A warm, strange calm crept over me.

I held up the dress. “Do you think it will fit?”

Lucas smiled. “Let me get the camera.”

I smiled back.

1jicrmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NMIXX/comments/1jicrmf/my_concern_over_haewons_chat_with_yu_jae_seok/,My concern over Haewon's chat with Yu Jae Seok.,"I was worried by some of the things Haewon said in their chat, and I wondered if anyone else had picked up on a similar vibe to me. I'm giving myself full permission to armchair psychoanalyze on this one, yes I could be completely wrong, but I want to share my thoughts.

At 18:00 Haewon mentions she drinks 3-4 cups of coffee daily, with 8 packets of coffee in each one. I don't know what brand of coffee she's talking about, but even without that information that seems to be a dangerous and concerning amount.   
  
They joke about it a little bit, and then the host asks Haewon if she's okay. I think for a moment she looks very tender and becomes vulnerable, the host notices that, and so shifts the question to something a little less confronting: ""do you have trouble sleeping?""

She looks a little frantic and nervous when she talks about why she drinks so much coffee, and at 19:46-19:48 you see a very clear indication of how she really feels. When I saw it, I felt like she was only a few steps away from bursting into tears.

Why I'm bothered: I've seen this situation unfold a lot in my own life where someone is hinting at some significant mental struggle but only in a very indirect way, and everyone around them picks up on it on some level, but to avoid the discomfort and awkwardness which confronting it brings, everyone keeps the situation light and keeps the jokes flying. They all assumed that the coffee was the cause of the inability to sleep, they didn't ask whether the coffee was the symptom of the fatigue and mental unrest, a way to combat it. To me, it looked like there was something bothering her, keeping her up at night, sapping her strength, and the copious amounts of coffee are a way to push past the fatigue, allowing her to ignore the signs her body is giving her, and maybe ignore what's disturbing her mental health. This is during a time of intense promotion, when pressure is high, and so there are plenty of potential stressors.

I'm anticipating people criticising me for arm chair psychoanalyzing so I'm going to stop here, but actually I've seen many indications of her implicitly asking for help in her variety content. I think it's important to understand that there are surface level interpretations of what's happening in a social interaction, you can easily see the situation as something jovial and light where everyone is joking and laughing. But often our intuition helps us understand something deeper happening beneath it all, and i was very shocked and concerned when I saw this interview.

1jicr2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/1jicr2n/funkybikeable_beach_towns_with_food_options/,funky/bikeable beach towns with food options,"living back in Carolinas after many years away. Have lived in CLT, Triad and Raleigh and Folly Beach SC outside Charleston is where we took the kids when they were small and times were simpler. Liked the laid back feel, kind of boho/funky, quality/unique food options and very safe to bike. Or at worst if we stayed further out, golf cart. I just looked for a week rental and houses are like 6k/week to rent. Can't swing that. Guess it's the ""Charleston effect.""

Plus kids both in college in NC so them being more like 3 hrs vs 5 1/2 to be able to get to us is key now. What are some NC beach spots that have a vibe? That is...a little concentration of food/drink spots. Not all just ""beach grub."" Ideally, safe to bike. Folly was unique in it being an actual little town with a downtown and a independent vibe but still being super slow/laid back. I don't have to check all those boxes but I would like to go somewhere I don't have to get in the car to go to the store/to dinner/for coffee. Crowds less of a concern. 

Like the look of Oak Island from a beach POV, but everything seems rather spread out along that highway there. Doesnt look like a ""get on your bike and go get coffee"" vibe. Or ""pile in the golf cart for dinner"" place. Main road looks kind of busy actually. Also like the look of Carolina Beach? Atlantic Beach? what are they like these days ?

Ideas? Cheers!

1jicqu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jicqu5/fired_after_less_than_1_year_networkinginterview/,"Fired after less than 1 year, networking/interview advice?","I will try to be brief, even if this is turning to a wall of text. I attended a semi-target in Canada. I got an sales & trading internship in my third-year summer and got along well with my bosses, but I wasn’t given a return offer in a competitive year. I did get a reference letter from my boss. I went ballistic trying to get a FT job throughout my fourth year, as in 3-5 coffee chats every single weekday, countless applications and final-round interviews just to get rejected at the last second for inexplicable reasons, and at last - while interviewing during finals season - I broke through and got an equity research position. I was over the moon, finally ready to start the next chapter of my life. 

Then it was all downhill from there. The learning curve was more steep than I thought, and despite my best efforts, I made a few mistakes along the way, and my boss/analyst seemed incapable of forgiving me after that. The snarkiness began, and after some other points of friction and MUCH much bearing through rudeness and trying to come up with new ways to approach working with him, I got a horrible performance review. I was just as dissatisfied, if not fuming at this point, so I also provided feedback on my analyst about his rude remarks, given that one of his superiors was present. My analyst could not even look me in the eyes the next day, and he said “thank you” for the first time for any work that I did. 

To save my job, I arranged a meeting with the head of ER, who ignored all my complaints and seemed incapable of listening to me. All the while, the analyst was known to be rude and go through associates every 1-2 years since he started working. I felt dejected, resentful and bitter, and I complained to some of my nicer coworkers about the situation. Unfortunately, I got an upfront warning from the head, who threatened to fire me if I keep talking. I said I was just looking for advice, and to this day, I don’t see how that’s punishable if not for the head trying to protect her reputation. They knew they were not treating me fairly. In the end, the head said that they were going to hire someone to work alongside me. 

I lost all hope and just focused on recruiting, which was turning out longer than expected. At the end of January, I got fired unexpectedly. I was flabbergasted and upset, because I was trying so hard not to quit only for this to happen. I had already gotten over the learning curve and was doing good work then. I got a letter of recommendation from one of my coworkers. I was unable to focus, so after fulfilling all my interview duties, I took a solo trip to clear my mind. Now I am back and beyond overwhelmed with all the work that I have to do to get to the next step. I am terrified of how extra difficult recruiting is now that I have to explain why I left after such little time, and I’m not even sure what field I should pursue. I am reaching out to people I worked with before, but everything is moving so slowly, and I am growing more and more anxious every single day. Any advice on what to do next or how to talk about this in coffee chats/in interviews would be appreciated. ",1,1742771910.0,careeradvice,0,1.0,False

So I went through it and toned it down. Here is a short snippet. Is it still too much? 

  
I was losing my daily battle with my hair when I spotted it - a stone lounging on my bed between my worn ""Pride and Prejudice"" and last night's sleep shirt, looking way too casual for something that definitely wasn't there yesterday.

I abandoned my half-tamed rat's nest and investigated. When I poked it, I felt warmth - not sunbaked warmth, but alive warmth. The moment I picked it up, a tingle shot through my arm like I'd licked a battery. (Which I'd never done. Okay, fine, once. For science!)

The texture was unmistakable - smooth with nature's fingerprints, exactly like Michael's skin. My heart switched to drumline mode while my brain tried to process. Had someone actually broken a piece off him?

I needed to get ready for work, but the bathroom door was locked. Jimmy was in there, performing his daily ritual of whatever-the-hell-takes-so-long. At least this was familiar territory—my brother hogging the bathroom was about the only normal thing about this morning.

""Get out already!"" I pounded on the door with enough force to wake the dead.

I stomped into the kitchen, where my mom was sipping her coffee, looking like she just stepped out of some glamorous mom-magazine photo shoot.

""Can you please tell Jimmy to get out of the bathroom?""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Indoor hydroponic systems are a fantastic way to grow plants year-round, but they can also be a bit of an eyesore. Many plant enthusiasts want to keep their hobby discreet without compromising the health of their plants. Luckily, there are creative strategies to hide your hydroponic setup while ensuring that your plants thrive. Here are some innovative ideas you may consider.

### Utilize Furniture

One of the simplest ways to conceal an indoor hydroponic system is by incorporating it into your existing furniture. Here are a few options:

- **Entertainment Centers:** Use the shelves of a TV stand or cabinet to hide smaller hydroponic systems. By placing your plants behind closed doors, you can enjoy your greenery without the clutter while ensuring they receive the necessary light.
- **Coffee Tables:** Opt for a coffee table with a glass top that you can transform into a plant display. Beneath the glass, you can create a vibrant scene using a low-maintenance hydroponic setup.
- **Repurpose Storage Ottomans:** Consider using a storage ottoman that features a removable top. This allows you to store your hydroponic system inside while making it easy to take out for maintenance.

### Create Vertical Gardens

Vertical gardens not only save space but can also provide an attractive display for your hydroponic systems. By using wall-mounted racks or trellises, you can design a stunning green wall. Here’s how:

- **Wall Planters:** Invest in wall planters specifically designed for hydroponics. These systems can be discreetly mounted, blending in seamlessly with your décor.
- **Faux Wall Panels:** Attach faux wall panels that mimic the look of your interior walls. Integrating your hydroponic system within the panel creates an illusion while allowing plants to grow sustainably.

### Camouflage with Decor

An excellent way to disguise your hydroponic system is to allow it to blend into your home decor. Here are some ideas to help you achieve that:

- **Potted Plants:** Surround your hydroponic system with decorative pots or false pots, filling in spaces with real plants. This creates a natural look that can easily mask the hydroponic equipment.
- **Decorative Screens:** Using decorative folding screens or room dividers can effectively block visibility. Choose a design that matches your home’s aesthetic to enhance the overall ambiance.
- **Artistic Displays:** Turn your hydroponic system into art. Add lighting, background paintings, or other decorative elements that draw attention away from the hydroponics themselves.

### Incorporate Greenhouses

If you have a bit more space, consider using a small indoor greenhouse. These can diffuse the sight of your hydraulic system while protecting your plants. Look for greenhouses that:

Shop Here -&gt;https://hownow101.github.io/Hydroponics  
- **Fit Your Space:** Choose a size that can snugly fit in an unused corner of a room or a balcony.
- **Have Optional Shelves:** Many indoor greenhouses come with adjustable shelves, allowing you to grow different types of plants at varying heights.

### Grow Within the Walls

For a more adventurous approach, think outside the box. Installing an integrated hydroponic system within a wall space can keep it completely out of sight. Here are some points to ponder:

- **Build a Hidden Wall System:** Look into creating compartments in your walls specifically for growing systems. This takes some effort and planning, but the effect can be stunning.
- **Use Clear Acrylic Panels:** This is another way to maintain visibility while discreetly showcasing your plants. This makes the entire setup seem artistic rather than functional.

Choosing to hide your hydroponic system doesn’t mean sacrificing growth or health. With a bit of creativity and planning, you can enjoy your gardening hobby in style while maintaining your privacy. By incorporating furniture, camouflage techniques, and even wall integration, your hydroponic system can become a seamless part of your home decor. You might even inspire others with your hidden oasis of greenery!

Maximizing Growth Potential in Concealed Hydroponic Setups
----------------------------------------------------------

Setting up a hydroponic system in your home can be an exciting venture, but if you're concerned about visibility, you may wonder how to ensure this setup remains inconspicuous while promoting robust plant growth. With the right approach, you can maximize growth potential in concealed hydroponic setups. Here are several strategies to achieve this balance.

### Choose the Right Location

The first step in hiding your hydroponic system is selecting an optimal location. Look for spots in your home that are less frequently visited. Consider these areas:

- **Closets:** If you have space available in a closet, this can be an ideal concealed spot.
- **Basements:** Utilizing a basement area allows you to create your hydroponic garden while keeping it out of sight.
- **Under stairs:** If your home has an under-stair area, this can be repurposed into a small indoor garden.

### Utilize Smart and Portable Hydroponic Systems

Investing in compact and streamlined hydroponic systems can significantly increase your ability to hide them. Look for systems designed with discreet aesthetics. Here are a few options to consider:

Shop Here -&gt;https://hownow101.github.io/Hydroponics  
- **Vertical Hydroponic Towers:** These systems not only save space but can blend well into your decor.
- **Countertop Systems:** Small enough to place unobtrusively on kitchen counters or office desks.

### Concealment Techniques

Once you've chosen the location and system, it’s time to think about concealment techniques. Here are ways to effectively hide your hydroponic setup:

- **Decorative Panels:** Use decorative screens or fabric to block the view without restricting air circulation.
- **Plant Choices:** Surround your system with larger houseplants to create a natural cover.
- **Furniture Integration:** Consider setting up your hydroponics within furniture like cabinets or vanity units.

### Maintain Optimal Conditions for Plant Growth

Hiding your hydroponic system is crucial, but you should never compromise growth potential. Ensure your plants receive:

- **Proper Light:** Use energy-efficient LED grow lights that can be easily directed toward your plants without being intrusive.
- **Air Circulation:** Install small fans discreetly to maintain airflow without drawing attention.
- **Temperature Control:** Maintain an even temperature to prevent stress on your plants.

### Monitor Nutrient Levels

Effective nutrient management is vital for maximizing growth potential. Check nutrient levels regularly and consider using:

- **Sensors:** Utilize sensors that alert you to any changes in pH or nutrient concentration, ensuring plants remain healthy without constant observation.
- **Nutrient Solutions:** Opt for high-quality nutrient solutions that cater specifically to hydroponic systems, making it easier to achieve optimal results.

### Regular Maintenance

Regular maintenance is key in hidden hydroponic setups. This not only ensures the health of your plants but helps minimize visibility. Incorporate the following maintenance tips:

Shop Here -&gt;https://hownow101.github.io/Hydroponics  
- **Routine Cleaning:** Keep the system and surrounding area clean to prevent any potential odors or pests.
- **Pruning and Care:** Regularly prune your plants to control their size, preventing them from becoming too bushy or noticeable.
- **Check for Leaks:** Inspect your setup regularly to avoid any leaks that might give away its presence.

By focusing on smart location choices, using the right systems, and applying concealment techniques, you can easily hide your indoor hydroponic setup. At the same time, ensure that your plants receive the optimal care they need to thrive. With these methods, you can enjoy the benefits of hydroponics without compromising on aesthetics or the health of your plants.

### Conclusion

Finding ways to hide indoor hydroponic systems can add a touch of creativity while ensuring privacy and enhancing the overall aesthetics of your living space. From using stylish cabinets and decorative shelving to cleverly integrating your hydroponics within bookcases or plants themselves, there are endless options to consider. You can design an environment where your hydroponic systems blend seamlessly into your home decor while still being functional and efficient.

It's essential, however, to remember that camouflaging your hydroponics shouldn’t hinder their growth potential. Selecting the right lighting, ensuring proper ventilation, and maintaining optimal humidity levels are crucial factors to keep in mind. Utilizing reflective materials for grow lights and fans can also contribute to a well-performing system, even when it’s hidden away.

Moreover, be strategic with your plant selection. Some plants thrive under low light or in more compact setups, making them ideal candidates for concealed spaces. You can enjoy the benefits of fresh herbs, vegetables, or even flowers without compromising on the aesthetics of your home or the health of your plants.

By combining creativity with practical solutions, you can have a thriving indoor hydroponic garden nestled discreetly in your space. This balance not only elevates your home's style but also allows you to reap the benefits of hydroponic gardening—all while enjoying the satisfaction of a well-concealed, lush green environment. Embrace the challenge and transform your indoor gardening experience into a beautiful and productive part of your home.

1jicgnj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jicgnj,German EMP Type 1 - Best by Sep2024,"What a great ration! Somehow I lost a couple pics of the components, apologies for  that.

These German are hard to beat! Some of the best beverage bases you will find in a ration. Hearty mains, great sides; you can tell they care about their troops a great deal.

Best by date on this big boy was 30Sep2024; no issues with that, everything was great!

Pic 2 is chocolate Muesli! A great breakfast. As good as the French, not as good as the Norwegain. Your mileage may differ, that's what makes this hobby so great!

Pic 3 is the freeze dried apples and apricots. This stuff is the sleeper in this ration. You don't expect it to be that good, but it is. You can bet these were eaten in their entirety with no reconstitution. I love freeze dried fruit and that's how I ate it. So darn good!

Pic 4 is the hearty pork goulash; no issues with this at all. Savory and hearty.

Pic 5 is the sausage and bean stew, again, nothing wrong with this main at all. Very hearty and filling, great flavors!

Pics 6-8 just show some of the sides and crackers. Rest of the pics are packaging. The biscuits in this ration were great and had a slight sweetness that went well with the meats and jams. The little chocolate cookies are great too! That tuna is surprisingly great as well!

Where is the rye bread you ask? Well, that got sent to sternum along with some LRP coffee and a coffee extract from this ration. Sternum is from Ohio and roasts his own coffee (Obvious Coffee), so I thought it's be fun to get him to taste some 48 year old LRP coffee!

Pork jerky went to MKR and the chili butter went to Jerms. They will enjoy them much more than I!

Rumor has it a certain someone on these threads may have some EMPs up for sale soon, I can't recommend these rations enough, truly a great experience to eat!

Take care folks!

1jic9w9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonomicon/comments/1jic9w9/c_is_for_conspiracy_hidden_in_plain_sight/,C is for Conspiracy Hidden in Plain Sight,"# Conspiracy Hidden in Plain Sight

The belief that secretive elites—Illuminati masquerading as Freemasons, shapeshifting lizard monarchs, or your local city planners—embed cryptic symbols in logos, architecture, and dollar bills, either to signal their power or fulfill arcane ritual obligations. Known as *symbol paranoia*, this worldview sees meaning where there is only marketing and ritual where there is only branding.

Humans are pattern-seeking mammals. We evolved not to be “right” in any ultimate sense, but to survive, which often meant connecting dots—whether or not the connections existed. Better to wrongly assume there's a tiger in the bushes 999 times than to miss it once and become lunch.

Most conspiracy thinking isn’t necessarily about what’s true, but about what feels necessary. This phenomenon thrives on apophenia—the brain's tendency to find patterns and connections where none exist—and a host of helpful mental shortcuts. 

Humans are natural storytellers—we perceive patterns, then try to explain them.

Agenticity is the urge to believe that someone, somewhere, *meant* for this to happen. A logo isn't just a design choice; it's a signal from the cabal.

Clustering illusion steps in when random placement starts to feel intentional—three triangles on a brochure? Must be a code. The mind recoils from randomness.

Causal compulsion ties it all together by turning coincidental details into conspiracy. If a strange symbol appears before a major event, it *must* be connected—never mind the millions of meaningless symbols we ignore.

Once a symbol fits your theory, confirmation bias ensures you'll keep seeing it everywhere, while ignoring evidence that doesn’t fit.

The narrative fallacy takes isolated details and fuses them into a grand story: not just a logo, but a breadcrumb trail of hidden meaning.

Finally, our interpretive instinct mythologizes the mess. We turn design into destiny, branding into prophecy, and urban planning into esoteric cartography—because it's more comforting to believe in a grand design than to admit the chaos is real.

How do we redirect this cognitive hunger for pattern and meaning—this innate storytelling engine—toward real political education and solidarity? 

Media and pop culture act as both accelerant and alibi. Every Marvel villain cabal, every cryptic Netflix thriller, seeds the soil for real-life QAnons and subreddit cartographers. What starts as *Da Vinci Code* fanfic ends with people storming Capitol buildings in Guy Fawkes masks because someone noticed that Beyoncé blinked a message to the Illuminati in Morse code.

These conspiracies are often less about power and more about comfort: a symbol-filled universe is easier to live in than a random one.

*""If the world is rigged, at least someone’s driving.""*

The same mechanisms that allow us to write novels, forge religions, and create culture also allow us to believe that the Latin on the dollar-bill has a secret meaning.

The phrases are plucked from the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States, a high-symbolic wax-stamp controlled by the Secretary of State. More than decoration, the phrases were propaganda: a Latin-laced attempt to sanctify a secular revolution. They cast the American founding not as a political rupture, but as a divinely ordained mission—Manifest Destiny in embryo form.

ANNUIT COEPTIS: “*Providence Has Favored Our Undertakings”* evokes Roman-style providence, suggesting that fate or God smiled upon the revolution.

NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM: “*New Order of the Ages”* cribbed from the ancient Roman poet Virgil, wasn’t about a secret cabal—it was about a bold new political experiment. A break from monarchy. A new era. A republic destined to rule by divine favor, not just politics.

The Founders imagined themselves as modern-day Romans, mythologizing their rebellion with Latin grandeur. It’s the aesthetic of enlightenment thinkers in powdered wigs.

But in the age of Q, Alex Jones, and TikTok deep dives, that same Latin takes on a sinister glow. “New Order” becomes New World Order. The pyramid? Illuminati. The eye? All-seeing surveillance state, not divine favor. What was once national myth becomes evidence of a cabal. Because if you’re looking for signs that the world is secretly run by elites, a glowing eye on your money is just too juicy to ignore. It shows how national myths are vulnerable to reinterpretation, especially when education collapses and institutional memory fades.

But the real workings of power are banal, bureaucratic, and openly legible. The “conspiracies” that matter—the dismantling of public services, the manipulation of markets, imperial interventions—don’t need hidden symbols. They’re legislated in public. They wear ties, not robes. The logos are clear.  Most real conspiracies don’t hide. They’re passed into law.

Conspiracy thinking becomes a kind of theatrical diversion—an aestheticized paranoia that misdirects attention from systemic critiques to symbolic ones. Media doesn’t have to lie—it only needs to frame reality in ways that serve power. Today’s media, especially entertainment media, primes the population to believe that the real threat is secret, alien, mythical, rather than class-based, economic, and political. Even if unintentional, entertainment culture becomes an incubator for conspiracy-thinking, not because it lies, but because it trains us in the aesthetics of suspicion: Archetypal villains speak in riddles. Evil is cloaked and symbolic. The truth is always ""hidden.""

So where do we go from here? How do we redirect this cognitive hunger for patterns—this innate storytelling engine—toward something more than decoding fonts and counting triangles on coffee cups? In the absence of civic literacy—genuine political education, media awareness, and historical memory—the mind does what it’s always done: it mythologizes. It fills the silence left by broken institutions with narrative. The problem isn’t the instinct to seek meaning—it’s the direction it takes when meaning is denied. People don’t believe conspiracies because they’re stupid—they believe them because they’re trying to make sense of a world that doesn’t add up. So the task isn’t to ridicule them, but to offer better tools. What people are often reacting to is real powerlessness—but instead of locating it in neoliberal deregulation, class exploitation, or racialized state violence, they locate it in mysterious symbols and occult cabals. Symbol becomes scapegoat. 

If we can harness that drive—not to chase shadows, but to expose systems—we might begin to transform paranoia into strategy. To shift from *symbolic literacy* to *systemic literacy.* To replace the breadcrumb trails of fictional TV cults with grounded human connection, collective memory, and an understanding of who benefits from the way things are. In short: to tell better stories. Ones rooted not in suspicion, but in struggle. Societies which fail to educate their citizens in systemic thinking will inevitably produce symbolic thinkers.

The pyramid isn’t on the dollar to mock you—it’s there to remind you: the system is a pyramid scheme.

I never go back to a pot a day, but it's basically like I am only able to make it a few days before needing caffeine again.
The longest I have made it is 2 weeks, the depression is just too much. Im self employed and the lack of motivation to do anything or enjoy anything just becomes to much.

How have you got through this? No way I am the only one dealing with it...... i mever got the headaches or other withdrawal symptoms,  for me it's the lack of motivation to do anything or like anything.",3,1742770565.0,decaf,4,1.0,False

We roasted a duck and I was about to make broth and noodles for the meal. I am very detailed when it comes to my favourite meals and when circumstance allow it, I like to take my time with it.

I cut onion and fried it, it is supposed to be ""smoky"" before added to the broth. I seasoned it, bamboo was added, a star anis and a little bit of chopped garlic.

A prepared bowls with noodles, covered it with roasted duck, adding broth to it. I topped it up with a bit of spring onion to add mouth drooling look.

Mouth drooled I did. I picked up my chopsticks and was about to take my first bite. Little did I know, my mouth won't even land on it.

**Bloody *ALARM* went off**.

I turned the stove off, I put on my coat, grabbed my mobile phone, some snacks for my toddler, dressed her. And together with my hub we went out of the building.

Alarm kept on going and no smoke was spotted. My anxiety was rising with every siren as my mind kept speaking loudly *your fucking noodles just evacuated whole building*. Security of the building was already there, trying to figure out what was going on.

While us, my crying toddler, annoyed husband and hungry me ( also anxious and sweating on both buttcheeks) were pretty much confused as any other muggle around us. We decided to go grab coffee nearby and not to stress.

After an hour or two we went back home after we got notification that it is now safe to go home. I asked security on my way home what happened. It turned out, some dumbell decided to have a smoke on hallway under a smoke detector. UNDER A F*CKING SMOKE DETECTOR. 😭

So we came back home, looking at those three bowls of noodles, cold, and noodles mashed like potatoes in the broth. With a heavy heart, I recooked some stuff and we finally enjoyed our meal. 

Atleast, nothing bad happened and we all are safe. (Not sure about our neighbour, I still might visit him and make him eat those mashed, cold noodles as punishment).
