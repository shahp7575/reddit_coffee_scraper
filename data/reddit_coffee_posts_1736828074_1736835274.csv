The most important thing for your LEEP procedure to go well, is finding a skilled & masterful female OBGYN

I was so so so so worried- I have never felt such fear in my life about anything- and after today’s procedure, I really wanted to post on here to give other females some positive encouragement that it will all be okay!

I believe that the experience was so successful because my doctor & I worked TOGETHER. She is the most supportive, loving & caring doctor I’ve ever had, as well as the most SKILLED and MASTERFUL doctor for LEEPS— so I want to stress, if you can find a doctor you feel comfortable with, who you know is talented at what they do, you can & will get through this!! 

As much as you want to mentally prepare, it’s difficult to navigate uncertainty and fear. But if you can marry fear with unwavering faith, on the other side of facing that fear, is your most badass warrior self!  I want to encourage hopeful thinking, not “doomsday” thoughts. (It feels incredibly empowering to be on the other side of this fear now, I have never felt so strong & proud)

When I first received the news that my precancerous cells had come back, I was spiraling in anxiety for the entire two weeks leading up to the procedure- to the point where I was having trouble functioning in day to day life from how scared I was.

Now, 8 hours out from the procedure, I cannot believe how unnecessary all of those mental mind games were that I was playing on myself, what was i so worried about? The LEEP honestly felt easier than the colpo / biopsies. 

Here is a breakdown of my experience:

3:30p arrived at Stonybrook Medicine
(I highly suggest DR KOWALSKA if you are in the NY area or can travel here for your procedure- she is, in my experience, THE VERY BEST)

4p was in the chair & ready to begin.

5p was in the car heading home already!

Pain & discomfort levels of each part

Speculum insert; (and the moving around of the speculum during the entire ordeal)

	⁃	1 out of ten: To my extraordinary surprise, this was the most painful & uncomfortable part

 3 needles into my cervix;

	⁃	0 out of ten!: this is the part I was MOST scared of, and I DIDNT FEEL A THING. I didn’t even know she did it! I still cannot even believe it. Our bodies are so incredible, our cervix is made to ensure SO much, remember how resilient your body is!

Two separate excisions, one deeper into the canal;

-0 out of ten!: because of the numbing, I didn’t feel a thing 

Stopping of the bleeding;


-0 out of ten!: because of the numbing, I didn’t feel a thing

ECC; (uteran scraping)


-0 out of ten!: (It seems that) because of the numbing, I didn’t feel a thing (or perhaps it’s where I’m at in my cycle? I’m days out currently from my period)

^this was the second part I was most scared of. Even my doctor told me that the ECC & after cramping would be worse than the colposcopy, because of how much is done to the body beforehand. But I was shocked & surprised to find out that it was painless (the colposcopy biopsy + ECC, however, was definitely painful and uncomfortable— which is the procedure you get BEFORE the Leep procedure)

After cramping;

	⁃	1 out of ten; if you’re like me, and you have endometriosis, or just really bad monthly period cramps, this will be a breeze! This was NOTHING compared to what I go through every month on my period.

Hours after the procedure; 

-0 out of ten! I’ve been feeling a bit of pressure, a bit uncomfortable,’but nothing serious at all. I’m mainly feeling a lot of movement in my stomach area. As if my body has discovered it just went through something big, and is tending to it with all its magical healing. But, it’s an interesting feeling, for sure! My stomach is doing a lot of talking, a lot of rumbling,’a lot of.. what feels like.. assistance in getting back to optimum health. Like there are little elves in there working overtime to make sure i heal up just right. :p but, no pain!

*I have been keeping very still, binge watching shows & painting with a heating pad on my belly. I’m eating very slowly just so as not to agitate or overwhelm my body too much, and eating gentle things like soup and juice and rice. I just went to the bathroom for the first time since the procedure, and it was painless. A little yellow discharge coming out so far, but nothing more than that. I expect the next week to have a lot of different “coffee grind” type stuff to come out, as well as bleeding and continued yellow discharge, as the doctor said, but nothing too crazy just yet.

Overall, I’m feeling REALLY good :) 

I also want to add that for 2 years I avoided the procedure through Ayurvedic Indian medicine that WORKED. It’s only when I stopped the herbs, that the abnormal cells came back. I also want to encourage women to look into alternative holistic methods because they really do work. I used the same Ayurvedic doctor that worked for a friend of mine, and will now continue to take these herbs for the rest of my life to ensure I give myself the greatest chance to never have abnormal cells again. (highly recommend DR JAY with Athreya herbs in long beach California)

Do all of your research, ask EVERY question, learn about your individual situation and do NOT let anyone push you or force you into going through with it until you are ready, confident and sure it is the best decision for YOU and your circumstance. 

I hope this post can ease many of your concerns. I know I felt so much relief from the positive Reddit posts I read prior to the procedure, and I hope I can be apart of that relief for you, too. Blessings for you & your journey. <3 (remember, you are a WOMAN and you are STRONG! And you can do this! Believe in yourself, show up for yourself, and know that you got this!)

At 23, he just started with IT job, eager to start investing for early compounding benefits lost his dad—the sole breadwinner. They had no term insurance. Overnight, his family went from comfortable to struggling.

I realized:

* Who'd pay my education loan if something happened to me?
* Could my family manage without dipping into savings?

So, I got a ₹1 crore term plan for just ₹600/month to start with. Here's why:

1. It's cheap when you're young
2. It's pure protection—no fancy extras
3. It's for your loved ones, so they don't struggle financially

**The bottom line:** It's quick, online, and costs less than my monthly coffee habit.

Me (24M) fiancé (23F) together since 27/12/2015 

Basically I lived with my fiancé at her parents house whilst doing my plumbing and gas apprenticeship for the last 3 years 

Rewind to July 2024 we had recently come back from a 2 week family Holiday in Greece as far as I’m aware she was fine on holiday we had a great time maybe a couple arguments as couples do.

Then not long after I noticed her not being herself even though we lived together we would still send each other a text usually me first sometimes her saying “I love you, I hope that you have a great day see you soon”
Or “how is your day” and they slowly turned into me being left on delivered I didn’t see it being much of an issue but after some time I thought it was strange considering it was an everyday thing no matter what, basically routine and then stopped the random kisses, hugs, “I love yous” and intimacy 
Which made me feel slightly insecure, ignorant old me thought she must be going through a hard time so I asked and told her that if anything’s on her mind then feel free to talk about it as I’m her for her whenever she needs

So I started to make more effort to make her life easier, making her tea and prepping her lunch for work, making her a coffee everyone morning, this went on for weeks until one night I said “please can you make abit more effort for me as I feel like you’re not being as attentive” 

She said “yes I’ll try to make more effort” and then hugged me tight as we went to sleep the next day she went to a concert with her friend for the weekend and then went to Smithers friends after coming back for a trial shift to try another job during all of this she was still leaving me on delivered even though she would be active a lot and around me always on her phone, so I felt kinda mad and upset at this point and then a day before she came back she said “ would you like to get a McDonald’s for tea” it was a work night so it was out of the ordinary Doing something on a work night as we usually stick to a routine, so I stupidly assumed she wants to make more effort.

She drove us towards McDonalds, 45 minutes away from her house the whole journey she was being very quiet and quite off, something didn’t add up in my mind we drive past McDonald’s towards my mums house she said “I just need to collect some clothes” we pulled up outside and she said “I’m sorry I can’t do this anymore” (along with some other things that just weren’t really a valid reason to end an 8 year relationship) and I was raging, I had just been deceived and my heart broken long story short I begged pleaded, bought her stuff to try make everything right and after a week we were back together. 

I then put effort into a lot more, taking her out for food, to the cinema doing more activities etc. and really worked to try and be the best I could be even started saving for a holiday to take just me and her away on her birthday in April this year which she had been aware of.

I really worked on myself and tried to not act out of emotion and get so annoyed, frustrated or stressed about things.

We usually have this cheap thing we do on a Friday night called pizza Friday where we will buy a nice frozen pizza from Tesco along with a lot of snacks and a drink and watch something on Netflix after work, we loved it, it was our end of week routine.

I then noticed she was being a little bit off or not putting as much effort in, I then would communicate with her and say “you’re not saying I love you anymore really without me saying it” 

Along with a couple other things it always seemed like I was initiating everything and if I didn’t I’d receive no reassurance.

She would reply with “you’re making me feel guilty and making me feel like I’m a shit person” I would reassure her and say “I’m not trying to make you feel guilty it’s just that I’d like you to put abit more effort in” 

Then it just became more and more almost like she was deactivating and then that would make me more insecure and then I would communicate and try more it was just a cycle and then she started playing pool and having a drink on a Friday and not get back till late so our “pizza Friday” which we never missed out on started to become a distant memory of the past 

And then more insecurity would grow from me and more deactivation from her

I then said one morning we need a serious chat, I drove us in the car to a spot and just expressed everything and said “I’ve made a lot more effort this time round and I know my values and I don’t want to walk away but I need you to understand how I feel”

I explained everything and she just wasn’t keeping eye contact and cried abit

I said what’s up with you why are you being like this distant and have no remorse for how you’re making me feel I asked what I had done wrong or if anything I’ve done has made her withdraw her feelings from me and I just asked that she’d try to be more empathetic and to put a bit of effort to say “ I love you “ and hug and kiss me and be intimate with me.

She said it was too much stress and she “doesn’t want to be in a relationship” she wants to “be single” she need to “find herself” and “figure out who’s she is” and “what she wants” all classic fearful avoidant reasons

And then broke up with me on the drive home I said “I was looking forward to going to the Christmas markets to get food and go shopping with you and spend my 2 weeks off from Christmas with you” and she said “so was I” how does that make sense, that was on the 14th of December 13 days before our 9 years of being together date.

FYI she never had a problem before any of this to show how much she loves me it’s just the last 6 months has been a real moment of her withdrawing and being hot and cold 

Since breaking up Ive been doing a lot of research and came to the realisation shes a fearful avoidant and a lot of stuff that didn’t make sense early on in our relationship and leading up to now makes so much more sense

Since breaking up this time I’ve gone to her house begged for her to take me back promised commitment and a good future and yes it’s not helped she’s treat me like I’m a stranger messages are abrupt 

Until last Friday I said to her that I need to see her as it’s not fair that she’s discarded me and trying to cut me off for good considering we have a dog and a cat and we’re both liked/loved by each others family 

After some serious crying and emotional explanation she said  she’ll meet me “as friends” only for me but since seeing. Her I can tell in her eyes there’s still feeling and that she still loves me 

She said if I make her feel uncomfortable like try to kiss her or hold her hand she’ll cut me off from seeing her 
 
So anyway the next day I asked if I could come over and see her, she was fine with it strangely enough, even though she had good poisoning I took her some medication and she let me stay for tea we watched 2 films I was there for 8 hours and she said how appreciative she was for me looking after her we hugged before I left for a little while and she held on for longer hinging me more 

the next day I asked if I could see her again she said yes and I stayed for 9 hours had tea again and we watched 4 films but she seemed quite within herself towards the end I always remind her that if I make her feel uncomfortable or outstaying my welcome to let me know 

That was yesterday we both hugged and thanked each other and she’s not messaged me at all today am I overthinking it? 

Before she agreed to start meeting me the messages were abrupt and I was initiating the contact
But since meeting she seemed really grateful of my presence as have I been but I’d like to see if she’ll initiate contact as I just want to be with her again and reconnect but I can’t do it if she won’t somewhat show interest

We’ve never been particularly close and he has been quite busy with his friends and career however we live amicably and I love him very much.

When he got a girlfriend after a relatively long break from dating, his attendance around the house began to increase. The girlfriend 24F, let’s call her “A” was quite pleasant at first. She was introduced to the whole family in around June of 2024, this was when my younger sister whom I am very close to (18F) was on an OE. We would talk about our days, and she would be welcome to join us for dinner, movie nights, game nights etc. We went out with her for drinks and went to a concert with her and she was the only partner (apart from my own) invited to my 21st birthday dinner. I was very fond of her.

The first few months went by without a hitch. I’d say I’m a particularly sensitive person but didn’t find myself very bothered by any of our interactions so I didn’t think anything negative of her and my brother was happy - a win is a win. The drama started when she had a medical issue while staying at the house and it became something that was announced to the whole house. A was shaken and we did our best to comfort her. However, after this, she seemed to come running to us whenever anything bad happened and always had quite whimsical tales to tell us when nobody really asked her to tell them. She’s quite a heavy drinker and while under the influence her behavior tended to be frivolous and annoying. She claimed to have seizures however became annoyed when recreational drugs would not be shared with her because of this. Her seizures never occurred in front of my mother or my sisters but always occurred in front of my brother, my brother’s friends and my father. She claimed she cured her cancer by using sun beds, that she had Borderline Personality Disorder (a personality disorder that I do have and actively engage with a DBT program for) and that she was diagnosed at 16 but cured it by 20 with running, she would use crude and offensive language in front of my parents but more importantly my younger sister (10F), she claimed her previous flat got “raised” hence why her housing situation was up in the air. She often complained about her employers, her friends, and her family however when asked she seemed to have no solid job history or any strong relationships with friends and family yet she was never at fault.

Her hostility towards the whole family came when we would not allow her to stay with us and suggested she look for a new flat. Her car had been broken into and our family was too busy to file a police report for her however there was not much that could be done as she had a $30,000 car on finance without insurance. We just didn’t have the capacity to house her or resolve her vehicle situation.

Even though she was upset at us we actually started to see her around the house more. She would waltz on into the house, go to the wine cabinet or the pantry, take what she wanted and leave, she would come into the house when dinner was being served, make herself a plate and not say please nor thank you, would spill red wine on our couch or my bedroom carpet despite being told to be cautious, when she didn’t hear someone address her she would say “what” or “huh?” instead of pardon me, she has been using my sisters body wash, my cleansing balm, leaves her hair in the hairbrushes and multiple of her toothbrushes in the toothbrush holder, would be in the home making herself coffee and sitting in the living room while my brother was at work etc. 

Just before Christmas, we invited my brother to have some dinner and drinks with my 18F sister who hadn’t caught up with him since she got back from her OE. It was just up the road and we weren’t going to stay for long. He expressed that he explicitly told her not to come as she was having a nap and we were able to get a good 20 minutes of catching up before she showed up at the restaurant. She looked like she had been crying and then sat a table away from us just staring as if wanting to be invited to sit down. I offered her a seat and asked if she wanted to have a drink with us but she quickly got up and hurried into a different part of the restaurant, which was strange but we kept chatting. She then messaged me “Let me know when you guys are done and (brother's name) can come out here”, or something along those lines, I’ve blocked her lol. I was a bit irritated as I didn’t think he needed a supervisor let alone have her show up somewhere where she was not expected, but I told him about the message and we left not soon after that. She was waiting for him but we had to go back to where we sat and to the restaurant bathrooms to look for his phone… we couldn’t find it and called it a few times but it was nowhere to be seen so I left my number with the staff in case they ended up finding it. My sister and I went home and the next day he told us it was in the bathroom which just didn’t quite sit right with me as he didn’t pick up the phone which he had supposedly retrieved until around an hour later. I can’t prove this but my gut tells me she took his phone while she was by our table. 

She began to talk to us less and less and be more careless in the house as if she wasn’t a guest at all. Because of the whole restaurant shenanigans and her recent behaviour we didn’t extend an invite to spend Christmas with our family. Because of this she went to another city for Christmas (3 hour drive away) but spent the whole day messaging and calling my brother upset. He caved midway through Christmas dinner and commuted down to spend the evening with her despite us asking him for just ONE day alone without her around. He proceeded to do the same thing for New Year's Eve unfortunately.

Now to the present day, just this past weekend we ordered food in for my mums birthday. She’s dealing with an injury right now and going to a restaurant wasn’t realistic so it was impromptu until she recovers. While we were all watching movies, A walks into the house (without my brother) doesn’t say anything to anyone, gets herself a plate, dishes herself up a plate of dinner, goes to the wine cabinet, takes a WHOLE bottle of wine and walks out without a word (My brother stays in a small unit in the garden). 

We were all quite baffled really. Later that night my brother drunkenly called me asking to borrow my vape and I went out to let him borrow it. She didn’t say hello to me and was pretty drunk as well, I saw on the table there were multiple bottles of wine that my parents had purchased that they had been drinking. As neither of them had been replacing the bottles, I told them it would be courteous to replace them and also to thank them for dinner, especially considering the occasion. Without even looking at me, A giggled. I asked her if something was funny and my brother got immediately defensive of A. He came up to me trying to intimidate me and said “Do you know what you just did” and “This MY is UNIT and you need to get out”. I was baffled and honestly enraged by her smirking at me. I left after telling him that this was his unit but this was OUR home and that my parents and our space deserves to be respected. 

They both drove off drunk to stay at her flat but came back the next morning - she still proceeds to eat and shower at our house but doesn’t speak to any of us.

I’m sure there’s more I’m forgetting but I’ll update if anything else happens. I don’t want to lose my brother but I can’t imagine letting her continue to be so disrespectful to my family and so entitled in our house. AITA?

1i0z9fb,https://www.reddit.com/r/hypotheticalsituation/comments/1i0z9fb/100k_dollars_per_day_with_odds/,100k dollars per day - with odds,"This hypothetical situation is inspired by an earlier post. But now you know your exact odds.

A wealthy billionaire named Allen Mask proposes the following challenge for his amusement:

You have the opportunity to earn $100,000 per day for 100 days, either by sheer luck or by completing a specific task.

Each day, you’ll spin a wheel of fortune to determine your fate.

If you fail to complete a challenge or refuse to do so, Allen will use his influence to have you imprisoned for 12 years. Moreover, any money you've earned up to that point will be forfeited.

There is no magic involved, so if it's an illegal activity, you will have to face the consequences if you get caught.

Here are the possible outcomes and their respective probabilities.

# 1. Lottery Win

* **Probability**: 52,4%
* Allen arranges that you win $100,000 after taxes via a lottery. It's completely legal and effortless. This is the dream scenario.

# 2. Anonymous Donation

* **Probability**: 10%
* You receive $100,000 from an anonymous benefactor with no explanation. However, every time this occurs, there’s a 20% chance that the benefactor becomes infatuated with you and begins stalking you for the next two years. If this happens, there’s a 1% chance each night that they will bypass all your security measures—regardless of cost—and appear in your bedroom, holding a knife. They will scream their undying love for you at the top of their lungs, giving you only four seconds to react before they attempt to stab you to death.

# 3. Stolen golden statue

* **Probability**: 7%
* You receive a stolen golden statue from a museum. The value of the gold alone is $150,000. The catch? You have only 24 hours to sell it for at least $100,000. Once you've managed to sell the statue it's up to you to launder the money. After all, the tax authorities won't exactly throw a party if you suddenly deposit $100,000 into your account without any legitimate explanation. Or you simply use the money as cash.

# 4. double or nothing

* **Probability**: 3%
* Exactly as the title suggests: If this event pops up, you have a 50% chance of doubling all the money you’ve earned so far—or losing every last cent of it.
* But here’s the twist: This is the only time you can choose to chicken out and still get a consolation prize. If you decide to decline, the game ends immediately, and you’ll only spend the next 6 *years* in jail. The silver lining? You get to keep all the cash you’ve earned up to that point. So, it’s a win... sort of.

# 5. Bank Robbery

* **Probability**: 2%
* You’re randomly selected to join a team of nine professional bank robbers, all handpicked by Allen himself. Allen equips you with a pistol fitted with a silencer. Together, you successfully pull off a daring heist, netting a total of $1,000,000. Later that evening, after splitting the loot, you’re ready to walk away with your $100,000 share when something catches your eye—a teenage boy hiding in a nearby bush, his wide-eyed gaze betraying the fact that he saw *everything.* Now you have the following choices:
   * eliminate the witness: 2,5% chance of still getting caught and facing 20 years in jail
   * run away and hope the kid remembers only your accomplices: 25% chance of getting caught and spending 12 years in jail. As the challenge was already completed, you keep your previously earned cash.

# 6. Inheritance from a family member

* **Probability**: 0,1%
* A family member tragically passes away and leaves you $100,000 in inheritance. Don’t worry—Allen will make sure it’s quick and painless. If you agree to this, one of your 100 closest relatives will be randomly chosen. Allen will take care of everything, ensuring that no one ever finds out the truth about what really happened. Dark, right? But hey, who wants to spend 12 years in prison if the alternative is $100,000?

# 7. Run (or walk) a Marathon in 24 hours!

* **Probability**: 4%
* Ready for a challenge that’s equal parts endurance test and public humiliation? Your task is to complete a marathon—42.2 kilometers (or 26.2 miles)—within 24 hours. Sounds reasonable? Well, here’s the catch: from the waist down, you can’t wear *anything.* Not a stitch of clothing. Shoes are allowed, and you can cover up your top half, but below the belt, it’s a no-go zone.
* Feel free to take as many breaks as you need; however, running indoors or on private property doesn’t count.
* If you’re stopped by the police and unable to complete the marathon, Allen will ensure that some very traumatized children happen to be nearby to witness the scene. As a result, you’ll spend the next 12 years in prison for public indecency and “corrupting the youth.”
* You must be seen by at least ten strangers while running, or the challenge won’t be considered complete.

# 8. No sleep challenge

* **Probability**: 20%
* For the next 24 hours, you’re not allowed to sleep. Sounds simple enough, right? Well, wait until this challenge pops up for the third time in a row—or, better yet, immediately after running a marathon. At that point, you’ll feel like a zombie, except with less brainpower and more questionable life choices.
* Of course, being sleep-deprived has its consequences. Trying to rob a bank on zero sleep? Good luck remembering which way is the exit. Selling a stolen gold statue while running on fumes? You’ll probably end up accidentally bartering it for a cup of coffee and a hug. Needless to say, your odds of success in future challenges are going to take a serious hit.

# 9. A trophy for Allen

* **Probability**: 1,5%
* Allen insists on keeping a trophy from the game. And what could be more personal (and creepy) than one of your fingers? He’ll chop it off in one clean swing with a razor-sharp axe—no anesthesia, of course, because where’s the fun in that?
* The good news? You get to choose which finger to sacrifice.
* If you’ve already lost all your fingers during previous rounds, Allen graciously spares you and hands over the $100,000 for free. Fingerless, but filthy rich—who’s laughing now?

If you accepted the deal, what kind of situation would push you to the point of saying no?

Would you take the gamble with double or nothing on your 100th day, or play it safe, spend 6 years in prison, and walk away with $10 million?

And finally, the million-dollar question: **Would you take the deal?** Or would you rather avoid Allen’s wheel of misfortune altogether, knowing full well you’d be missing out on potentially life-changing (and finger-losing) opportunities? Choose wisely, because once you say yes, there’s no turning back!",0,1736833403.0,hypotheticalsituation,8,0.5,False

I said i was open to get a drink and catch up but now I am  seriously regretting that cause bro took it seriously.

Coffee shop music would be another name for it but I remember it being a big thing. Artists include:

- Nora Jones
- Coreen Bailey Rae 
- James Blunt (maybe bad example)
- Damien Rice
- David Gray
- Paolo Nutini
- (Maybe) Jack Jones
- Alanis Morissette (Early)
- Vanessa Carlton (Kinda)
- Dido

Those are the ones that come to mind off the top of my head and are probably UK skewed. I think Laufey kinda carries the torch in a way these days, maybe the new Clairo stuff harks back to it. You could extend this to films such as Bridget Jones, Notting Hill and other sort of Richard Curtis fare. 

Essentially music made for and marketed to primarily the 30-50yo demographic. Does it exist anymore? I feel like a big cultural folly these days is eternal teenagerdom. It's been well documented and lamented in this sub but I think there's something to be said for the fact that there just isn't any media or culture anymore that's distinctly ""Adult"" (though I say that with a pinch of salt).

You can see it in other things where you have the president and his financier acting like 13 year olds and shit posting but that's probably a larger conversation/digression. 

Maybe it was pre modern internet and the fact that everyone now effectively exists in the same media landscape/spaces.",12,1736832529.0,redscarepod,3,1.0,False
1i0yzmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1i0yzmr/sanguis_pt_12/,Sanguis [Pt. 1/2],"“I think there’s something out there,” Deputy Erikson said.

The child came running out of the woods directly in front of my jeep. I slammed on the brakes, and the vehicle screeched to a halt about three feet away from him, headlight beams reflecting in his eyes.

Beside me, Deputy Erikson almost dropped a cup of coffee in his lap. Meanwhile, I was frozen in place, my fingers clutching the steering wheel for dear life, knuckles bulging against the skin.

""Is that the kid?"" Erikson asked.

Exhaling the tension from my body, I said: ""That's a kid, alright, but not the one we're looking for.""

I unfastened my seat belt and climbed out of the car. Slowly, as if approaching a wild animal, I walked towards the child with my hands raised in plain sight.

We were scouring the area for a missing girl. About six years old, auburn red hair, freckled face. Alys was her name. She’d been taken from a parking lot after one of her treatments. No one knew how.

The child in front of us, though, was a little boy, maybe eight to ten years old. Short, bedraggled brown hair, tan, and skinny as a beanpole.

There were leaves and twigs sticking out of the nest of his hair. Mud stained his bare feet. Small pink scratches adorned his arms and legs. For late October, the weather was too cold and windy to be wearing khaki shorts and a T-shirt. But if I had to guess, the temperature was the least of his concerns.

""Calm down now, son,"" I told him, ""we're not gonna hurt you.""

I could see it in his eyes. The teetering scales that resided within every person. That intrinsic response to perceived danger. Fight or flight? Stay or go?

The boy looked primed to run, but we were out in the middle of nowhere, standing on an endless stretch of asphalt. Last farm was about seven miles back, the next farm was probably another good seven miles ahead.

""Can you tell me your name?"" I asked. ""I'm Deputy Solanis with Halleran County Sheriff's Department. You can call me Raymond if you'd like, or Ray if that's easier.""

The boy stared at me with wide eyes. His pupils were dilated, eclipsing the whites. He parted his cracked lips and whispered: ""Thomas.""

""Thomas, that's a nice name. Can you tell me what you're doing out here, Thomas?""

The boy trembled with fear, wildly thrashing his head from side-to-side. ""Please! Please! Please! Don't send me back...I can't go back...don't make me."" He fell to his knees and sobbed. ""Hollow...men...bad...animals...in the trees...""

His head snapped up in my direction. There was a sudden stillness to him that made my heart drop. Like a lull during a thunderstorm, when the entire world goes quiet.

""The Fisherman is real,"" Thomas cried. ""He's in the trees! He'll come for me. They all will!""

Then, without warning, the boy fell flat onto the tarmac, unconscious. I rushed over to him and placed my fingers on his neck. There was a faint pulse present. From what I could discern there were no apparent cuts or broken bones. No indication of internal or external bleeding other than the few small scratches from running through bushes and other foliage.

I picked the boy up and returned to the jeep, setting him in the backseat. Taking my place behind the wheel, I spun the car around and headed towards the nearest hospital. About a twenty or thirty minute drive. But that's the Midwest for you. An archipelago of small towns isolated by an ocean of farms and forests. Rolling fields with a few riverbeds and streams interspersed.

While I drove, my foot heavy on the accelerator, my partner radioed the station with an update. Then, he called the hospital, told them to have a room and staff on standby for our arrival.

He hung the receiver on its cradle and peered into the backseat, a look of anguish upon his face. He muttered a soft prayer and turned in his seat, facing the front again.

""Son of a bitch,"" he muttered, glancing at the clock on the dash. ""I'm 'sposed to go trick-or-treating with Dany in about an hour.""

I checked the time. He was right. It was nearing the end of our shift. Getting anyone to willingly work a Saturday was tough. Convincing them to stay late was almost impossible. Of course, if the sheriff demanded it, there wasn't much they could do. At the same time, the sheriff was away on vacation, leaving me in charge.

""Tell you what,"" I said. ""Help me drop the kid off, and I'll let you get going for the night.""

""Are you sure?"" he asked, but there wasn't much in the way of sincerity. ""I'd hate to leave you high and dry.""

""I'll be fine. Didn't have plans anyway.""

""Oh, right..."" Erikson averted his gaze from me, once more looking back at the boy. ""Think he's from Sanguis?""

""Sanguis?""

""Yeah, closest town I can think of other than Baywater. But Baywater's about an extra twenty minutes from where we found him.""

""How far is Sanguis?""

""About eight minutes if you'd kept on the highway. Small gravel road that'll take you there.""

I nodded, storing the information away at the back of my mind. ""Sanguis, why haven't I heard of it?""

""Doesn't surprise me. Not many people have. They're a tight-knit community. Population can't be more than two thousand, if that. Only reason I know them is for their sweet corn.""

""What about it?""

""Just that it's pretty damn good. All their produce is. Since they're so far out, they have to take it to other markets and whatnot. But a few years back, they ran out of sweetcorn before I could get any. So, I asked the lady selling it for directions and went straight to the source. I'm tellin’ ya, stuff is out of this world. Dany and Lin go crazy over it.""

For the last few years, most of my dinners were plastic-wrapped and bought from a gas station. Couldn't remember the last time I'd gone grocery shopping for anything other than a six-pack and TV dinners. Maybe a frozen pizza if I was really hungry. But those days, my appetite was practically nonexistent.

We arrived at the hospital and carried the kid inside. Despite the holiday weekend, we were met by a number of nurses with a stretcher ready. Before I knew it, the boy was wheeled away, down the hall and around the corner. A doctor approached to question us, but we didn't have as many answers as he would've preferred. To be fair, I wasn't pleased about it either. Should've tried harder to get a full name or something concrete.

""How long do you think he’ll be under?"" I asked the doctor.

""Can't say until I've had a chance to examine him,"" the doctor admitted. ""The collapse could've been a result of extreme fatigue, malnutrition, mental strain, induced narcotics...I should be able to provide a better answer soon.""

My heart was racing, and my patience was burning. I couldn't stand the idea of waiting around, twiddling my thumbs, hoping everything would just land on my lap. Especially since we still had flyers to pass out for the missing girl.

""How 'bout this,"" I said, grabbing a pen and piece of paper from the front desk, ""I'll leave my personal cell and my partner's number. Kid wakes up, you call us. Until then, I'm gonna have a look around, see if I can't find the parents first.""

The doctor took the sheet of paper and nodded. ""Be careful out there tonight, Deputy. Full moon is a bad sign.""

""Well, I'm not one for superstitions, doc.""

We went back to the jeep, and I drove my partner home. His wife and son greeted me with excitable waves. The boy was dressed up as a scarecrow, and the mom in a white and blue dress with a little wicker basket.

""There's our tin man,"" she said as Erikson exited the vehicle. Then, she looked through the open passenger window at me. ""Y'know, we could still use a cowardly lion to round out the pack. You’re more than welcome to join us, Ray.""

""Would love to, Lin. 'Fraid I've got other plans though.""

""Oh?"" She cocked an eyebrow. ""Got a special date or something?""

Erikson nudged her with his elbow. She frowned in response. I recognized the signs of martial nonverbal communication well. An interesting thing to develop with someone. A language that can only be achieved after years and years of familiarity. I had that once, I like to think. But I was better at speaking it than interpreting it.

""I should be on my way,"" I said. ""Dany, get enough candy for the both of us, yeah?""

""We're gonna hit every house in town,"" the boy replied eagerly.

After that, I was back on the highway heading towards Sanguis. Overhead, the sun descended, gradually vanishing against the horizon. Black clouds billowed across the sky, wispy trails of ink that dispersed against the moon's unnatural glow. It was that time of year, the Hunter's Moon. When its white, snowy surface took on a pale orange hue and appeared about twice its normal size.

Along either side of the highway were thick patches of trees. Some with empty tops, their branches twisted like gnarled fingers. Others still retaining a mixture of red and brown leaves that swayed against the breeze.

I slowed down by mile marker ninety-six, crawling along the highway at a deliberate pace until my headlights spotted the gravel road Erikson told me about. Then, I turned off from the asphalt and followed the lane for another few minutes. It wasn't a long drive, but I was being cautious about deer or other wildlife. Nothing could ruin your day like a wild animal.

Rounding a bend, Sanguis appeared as if out of thin air. One second I was surrounded by dark forests and cornfields. Next thing I knew, there were dim street lamps and old brick buildings with vines wrapped around them like spiderwebs. Cookie-cutter houses of this era, greatly contrasted by the outdated shops along main street. Each one built directly beside each other, shoulder-to-shoulder because back in the day, no one really knew just how big a town could become. Everything was grouped together for convenience.

I had to pull off from main street along a backroad due to a line of barricades. It seemed the town was holding a Halloween festival. And with the overcrowded sea of cars, it looked as if everyone and their moms were in attendance.

I found a parking spot on a muddy field in between a Ford Puma and a Lincoln. I got on the radio to let the dispatcher know of my whereabouts and to see if there were any updates about the boy. So far, they hadn't heard anything. Just to be sure, I checked my phone, but I was too far out in the boonies for cell reception.

""Go figure,"" I muttered, pocketing my phone and stepping out from the jeep. I locked the car and started my trek for the only part of town that had any discernible sign of life.

In all my years, I'd never seen such spirited enthusiasm for Halloween. I've encountered some interesting costumes, attended a few lively parties, but Sanguis was on a completely different level.

Almost everyone wore a costume, and no outfit was the same. There were a few modern pop culture references. Kids dressed up as their favourite cartoon characters and superheroes and whatever else was popular to them. Adults varied in that some donned scarier outfits and makeup to appear as ghosts and ghouls and zombies. Some, mainly the younger crowd, were dressed in a more attractive fashion. Then, of course, there were a handful of people that didn’t bother with more than their everyday clothes.

I shouldered my way through the crowd, trying to ask about the boy, but I was consistently ignored. I imagine many mistook my uniform for a costume, and considering my age, they wanted nothing to do with me. I was just a middle-aged man with a tired face and sad eyes. Unruly hair partnered with faint stubble that was in an awkward phase between beard and clean-shaven. My only advances had been blind dates organized by mutual friends. But I didn’t have many acquaintances outside of work.

However, after enough searching, I was able to speak with a few of the locals. With the provided information, some had possible answers, but Thomas was a common name. Not to mention, many of the locals willing to speak with me were already inebriated and struggled to comprehend what I was asking. The music blaring through overhead speakers scattered about main street wasn't making my job any easier either.

There was nothing I could do about the festival, as much as I wanted to. I couldn't just make demands to shut it down or halt its progress. Sanguis wasn't within my county, and therefore, I had little say. I should've called someone to aid me, someone working within their jurisdiction, but I was impatient. Eager for answers.

Eventually, someone dressed as a sad-faced clown pointed to a nearby diner and told me I should speak with the mayor. I thanked them and went on my way.

Inside, the diner was packed from wall-to-wall. Every booth was filled, every stool taken, every inch of counter space occupied by food and drinks. The distinct scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, intermingled with the smell of cooked bacon grease and oil from an air fryer.

""Sorry, hun."" A hostess in a black apron had snuck up on me, appearing from a small cluster of girls dressed as vampires. ""There aren't any tables right now. Wait time will be about ten to twenty minutes. Maybe longer.""

I leaned in and asked: ""Is the mayor here?""

The woman looked me up and down, studying my face. ""Oh, you're not from around here.""

""That obvious, huh?""

""I've got an ear for accents and a memory for faces. 'Specially one as handsome as yours.""

She was lying in hopes of getting a tip.

""You wouldn't happen to know of a little boy named Thomas, would you?” I asked. “Younger, between eight and ten. Brown hair. Blue eyes.""

""Might be Tommy Milner. His daddy has a farm up the road.""

""Sweet corn?""

Her lips twisted with amusement. ""Sheep and pigs mostly.""

""Right,"" I said. ""Now, about the mayor...""

She turned and pointed to a booth at the back of the restaurant. A man in a suit sat alone. Darker skin, curly black hair cut short, quiet but seemingly amicable as he politely nodded or waved at a few other patrons passing by on their way for the side exit.

""Thanks a bunch."" I left the hostess and maneuvered the crowd until I stood before the mayor's table. ""Got a moment?""

He looked up from his half-eaten meal. His eyebrows knitted together with consternation. ""Do we know each other, friend?""

I extended my hand. ""Raymond Solanis; deputy sheriff from Halleran County.""

A charming smile lifted the mayor's lips, revealing a set of pearly-white teeth. A politician's grin. Warm, attractive, but not so defined as to appear creepy or intense. Small lines around the corners of his mouth said he must've donned it often.

""Mayor Michael Briggs."" He grasped my hand firmly and shook it. ""Pleasure to make your acquaintance. Please, have a seat. Are you hungry? Best bacon this side of the river.""

Best bacon and sweet corn, I thought. What can't you people do?

""No,"" I said, ""but thank you.""

He nodded and lifted a cup of coffee to his mouth. ""I like your costume.""

""You do realize I'm actually a deputy sheriff, right?""

""And I'm dressed up as the very handsome mayor of Sanguis.""

""Doesn’t really seem like a costume to me.""

""Of course it is."" The mayor grinned. ""You and I are nothing more than men. This, the clothes we wear and the business we conduct, are roles in a play. The world is a stage, my friend, and we are simply trying to give our best performance before the curtain inevitably falls.""

I had to wonder if it wasn't just coffee in the mayor's cup.

""The reason I'm here,"" I explained, ""is about a boy my partner and I found on the highway. Might be a local from your town. Tommy Milner?""

""Ah, Tommy. Kind young man. Hard worker. You say you found him on the highway?""

I quickly recalled the day's earlier events. How the boy came running out of the woods barefoot and afraid. As if he were being chased.

""I see."" The mayor rubbed his hand along the length of his jaw. ""Is he okay?""

""He's being treated at a hospital about half an hour from here. I was hoping to get in contact with the parents, verify the boy’s identity.""

""You and your partner?""

""Just me."" I don't know why, but then I said: ""Partner's on standby at the hospital. Waiting for any updates.""

The mayor took another sip of his coffee as he considered this. There was a hint of distress in his eyes as if he were trying to solve a puzzle without all the pieces. Bemused by the news given to him.

""Well, Deputy, I can't say I've heard from the Milners. Then again, it has been a busy day with the festival. Why don't we take a ride up to the farm and check in on them?""

""I would appreciate that, Mayor.""

He collected his coat from the booth and rose to his feet. I followed closely behind him. As we neared the main entrance, he stopped and whistled.

Somehow, through the bustle of the diner, a woman at the far end of the counter perked up and met the mayor's gaze. She stood from her stool, threw down a twenty dollar bill on the counter, and joined us outside.

It was then I got a better look at the woman. Lithe frame and hard jaw. Steely eyes with an indifferent expression. She wore a black police button-up beneath a Kevlar vest.

""Deputy Solanis, meet Officer Katherine Barsad,"" the mayor introduced. “She’s our local law enforcement.”

""Kat,"" she said curtly.

I tried to shake her hand, but the mayor was already on the move, and she was quick to keep up with him.

We all piled into Officer Barsad's cruiser and drove deeper into town, past the buildings and streets onto a muddy road that led us to the countryside. The trees returned but swiftly gave way to endless fields of corn.

""You know, Deputy,"" said Mayor Briggs, ""it seems strange for you to be all the way out here.""

""Lucky that I was, otherwise young Tommy might still be walking the highway.""

The mayor glanced over at me in the passenger seat, still awaiting some sort of explanation.

""I was going around handing out flyers for a missing girl, Alys,” I said. “Trying to raise awareness; see if I couldn’t shake something loose.”

""Correct me if I'm wrong, but they have Amber Alerts and news channels for that, don't they?""

""Smaller communities aren't alway fully connected to the network. And I've got me something of a restless mind. Need to keep busy.""

""Workaholic or guilty conscience?""

Instinctually, I tensed at the question. In the backseat, Officer Barsad shifted her body to face me. It was then I realized just how cramped the car was, and how strange it'd been for the officer to relinquish the driver's seat to the mayor. Then again, he was technically her boss. But in my experience, whenever I was with the sheriff, he always rode shotgun.

""You know why they call this town Sanguis?"" the mayor asked. ""Back in the late 1800s, around the civil war, there was a battle here. You see for a time, Missouri was considered a border state. You know what a border state is?""

""When the state's loyalty was divided between the Confederacy and the Union. Neither fully one or the other.""

""Very good, Deputy."" He raised his eyes to look at Officer Barsad in the rearview mirror. ""We've got a learned man in our midst.""

We turned off the road and started up a long winding lane towards a plain farmhouse with a sloped roof. The yard light was off, and the inside of the house was dark.

""The battle was as bloody as they get,"" Mayor Briggs continued. ""Brothers against brothers, fathers against sons. In fact, there’d been so much bloodshed, it soaked into the dirt and turned the waterways red for a time. It almost caused the town to collapse completely, but where there's a will there's a way.""

""And that connects to Sanguis how?""

We came to a stop in the empty driveway. The mayor turned towards me, the leather of his seat squeaked with his movements. ""Sanguis is the Latin word for blood. Not our proudest moment but perhaps our most defining.""

Slowly, under the cover of the shadows, I slid my right hand across my body, resting it on my revolver. ""Is that so?""

There was a hint of disappointment in the mayor’s smile. ""Unfortunately."" Then, he unbuckled his seatbelt and exited the car. ""Are you coming?""

I opened my door and stepped out, Officer Barsad lingered a few paces behind us. A spectator in this investigation. Easy to forget if you weren’t careful.

We followed the cobblestone path to the porch and knocked on the front door. There was no response, so we knocked again. The mayor called out to the Milners, alerting them of his presence. Still, nothing.

""What do you think, Deputy?"" the mayor asked. ""Should we get a warrant? I imagine it might be difficult for you considering county lines.""

I looked back at Officer Barsad. ""Suppose I should let you take the lead.""

She remained still, her eyes going to Briggs for instruction. He nodded lightly, and she stepped forward, trying the handle. The door swung open to darkness and the smell of honey ham.

I removed a flashlight from my belt. Officer Barsad did the same. We entered the house, our beams of light crawling across the floorboards and walls. I kept my right arm rested on the grip of my revolver, ready to draw at a moment's notice.

In the hallway, I found a picture hanging on the wall. It was a family photo of the Milners. Mother, father, and son. The boy was the very same I'd encountered on the highway.

Suddenly, the overhead lights came on. Mayor Briggs stood with his finger still on the switch, grinning at me with a sense of pity.

""Keep your eyes on the sky,"" he said, ""and you'll trip over the roots beneath your feet.""

We turned off our flashlights and wandered the house, calling out to the Milners. There was no sign of life, no sign of a disturbance either. The house sat empty and still, untouched. Then, as I returned from the hallway, I stopped in the dining room. The dinner table was set with three plates, the food on each plate partially eaten. Something had interrupted their supper and forced them to abandon their home halfway through a meal. No time to clean up, no time to pack, no time to do anything but leave. Where had they gone? What made them leave so suddenly?",1,1736832347.0,DrCreepensVault,0,1.0,False

1i0yz99,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1i0yz99/ongoing_severe_pain_and_digestive_issues_please/,"Ongoing, severe pain and digestive issues PLEASE HELP! I'm losing my sanity.","Hi guys. I (31F) am having an issue that is becoming intolerable and my PCP has pushed me to my wit's end over this. A bit about me: 5'1, 298 lbs (In the last 2.5 months, I have lost 30 lbs), I am biracial (white/black), and I currently only take Ozempic 1mg once a week. I do not smoke, drink, or use recreational drugs. I had an endoscopy done Oct 2023 to see if I could get weight loss surgery that I ultimately didn't have. (Due to personal reasons, nothing health-related.) The results were a normal and healthy stomach. This may be relevant. I also do not have a gallbladder. (Emergency removal in 2018, don't know if it'll be relevant or not.) Outside of it, I've had 2 c-sections (Jan '18 and Dec '19) and my tonsils removed at age 6. That's all my surgeries.

  
Okay so around September 2024 (so going on 4 months ago), I started having severe stomach pain. It had happened once before (around May 2024) and a trip to the ER said I had gastritis. That lasted about 3 weeks and then went away on its own. So when this started, I brushed it off as the same thing. It, like before, came on out of nowhere and grew pretty severe. I waited about 2 weeks, taking over-the-counter meds like Prilosec as that's what I had been given previously. It didn't do anything. Finally, in desperation, I went to the ER. They did lab work and reported that my bloodwork looked ""a little wonky"" and my WBC was elevated with my RBC kinda low. (this isn't horribly uncommon for me, but I couldn't tell you why.) Anyway, they did a CT scan with contrast and said everything looked good, and chalked it up to GERD. Basically, said to keep taking Prilosec and see your PCP. I booked an appointment to see him about 3 weeks later. During this time, I was bloated pretty badly, had started vomiting both randomly without warning, and after fighting waves of nausea. I developed sulfur burps (seriously fuck those), and my stool became very loose until it finally just became completely liquid. And then there was the pain. Just horrible, horrible pain, right in the upper center of my abdomen. If I put about 2 or 3 fingers directly under my sternum, the pain is right below where my finger rests. It doesn't radiate anywhere but is pretty acute to that spot. The pain comes and goes in waves, and most of the other symptoms do. It's not constant, except for the sulfur burps and the random vomiting, but the nausea, diarrhea, and pain come and go. 

  
He looked over the tests done at the hospital and chalked it up to a likely ulcer. He did tell me I had developed diabetes (a1c was 6.8) He put me on ozempic, acid blockers and anti-nausea and told me to call back if it didn't improve. I gave it 2 weeks before I called and begged to get in to see him again. The pain was becoming more severe and more frequent, approaching nearly daily. He, well did nothing. He felt around my belly, asking if anywhere hurt, and listened to it and that was about it. He said he would refer me to a GI specialist and to be expecting a call to set up the appointment. 2 weeks went by and I heard nothing. So I called back and asked and he said come in and see me and I'll send a referral. So I went back and... he did nothing again. Said he would call in a referral. I waited about another 2 weeks and heard nothing so I called again. It's the same song and dance. I've now seen him 3 times and he hasn't called in a referral or sent me for testing. He's done nothing. So I called a 4th time and got told the same thing. Come back in to see him first. Now, I'm not stupid, and I feel like he's just trying to milk my insurance and my copays, so I'm trying to find a provider within network that doesn't have a near 6-month waitlist for new patients. So far, I've not been lucky.

  
The only thing that has changed was when my Ozempic bumped up to 1 mg from .25mg. (At the same appointment he said my A1C dropped to 5.8 and that I was no longer diabetic.) That was about 3 weeks ago. In those 3 weeks the pain/diarrhea/nausea haven't been as often, dropping down to about 2-3 times a week instead of the daily it had gotten to. They last for hours at a time, usually most of the day. The sulfur burps are constant. They're disgusting, and nothing gets rid of the taste, but the sensation of them hides the sensation of vomit coming up as they feel the same, so I never know until it's basically in my mouth if it's a burp or vomit. And when I do vomit and start heaving, the stomach pain becomes excruciating, even if I wasn't feeling the pain before the heaving. It normally leaves me crumpled on the floor crying afterwards. I've had accidents since this started, like if I cough or sneeze unexpectedly, and liquid stool shoots out. I haven't had a solid bowel movement since September. 

As far as diet goes, I've been trying to stick to fruits and veggies, have given up most processed food and sugar, and quit drinking coffee and soda. On days when my stomach hurts, I eat and drink nothing, no matter how hungry I may be, because anything I eat or drink comes back up and makes the pain worse. And, probably due to the ozempic, I don't have much of an appetite when I do eat anymore, so my meals have greatly reduced in both number and size. Usually, a few bites fill me up, so I've been sticking to salads and meats. Fried food and greasy food also aggravate my stomach so I've mostly given those up as well. The only medicine that helps in any form is kaopeptate. I just want answers. I've done Google searches but keep getting ""stomach virus"" as the only real explanation. I'm exhausted and sick of being in pain all the time. Is there anything I could do to help these symptoms or any ideas of what it could be causing it?

Or at least less confusing?,"I doubt anyone will read this very long post, but I had to get it out. Modern dating as a 30 something, relatively-fresh-out-of-the-closet man is confusing, isolating, lonely. I don't like to spend time in regret, but I so wish I could have spent my teenage years figuring this shit out. Does anyone feel this too?

Here's my latest experience.

There's this guy I went out with this summer. Just a few dates, but it felt passionate and exciting. Then he sorta ghosted. I would see him around (we go to the same coffee shop) and he would say let's hang out, I would text, then nothing.

For some reason this was all extremely painful. I glued myself to my phone, waiting for a response. I wandered the city, hoping I'd see him. But then, I stopped going to the coffee shop altogether, the one place I knew he'd be. I felt so ashamed and needy and broken. 

But also confused. I don't even know him. We didn't even sleep together. But the way it made me feel, you would've thought we'd gone out for years. I cried for weeks.

I figure time fossilizes all wounds, and two days ago, I work up the courage to head to the cafe again after six months. Like some real life sitcom, he's there. He says hi and smiles. Even winks. I smile back.

That evening, I go to meet up with a friend at a bar. I open the door...and there he is. We exchange pleasantries and go our separate ways...until the evening turns to night and we find ourselves in line for the bathroom together. We kiss. He says, you guessed it, let's hang out. 

I get deja vu, but in spite of myself I text him and immediately feel the anxiety crowding out rational thought because of course, I don't hear from him.

Why does my body want him so badly, after all this time and when I hardly know him? I just want to understand. 

More importantly, I want to feel this for someone who feels this way about me. Or, I want to feel this way and have it feel GOOD. I'm tired of feeling shame and anxiety.",4,1736831544.0,AskGaybrosOver30,3,1.0,False

**Title:** AITA for calling my MIL a liar?

Background : My sister (33f) and I (30f) are not close. We always catch up on birthdays, weddings and similar family events but we are not friends. This is partially because we are very different and partially because she doesn't approve of my marriage (my husband is 12 years older than me and we started dating when I was 18). My husband and his family don't like my sister because she is openly feminist and doesn't care about gender norms in marriage.

Now, the problem : We hosted a birthday party for my son a few days ago, I had a headache so I was upstairs when I heard my MIL and husband arguing inside. He stormed in our room, said that MIL says that my sister called my SIL a whore, said that she is ugly and fat and then left. I said that my sister haven't said that, because she would never called another woman those type of derogatory words and husband said that MIL was there and heard everything and I wasn't, to which I said that than MIL is lying and that would be out of character for my sister to say something like that. He called me an a-hole and says that I don't even like my sister and that I get along better with MIL anyway, so how I can call her a liar?

He has been on the phone with MIL and SIL whole day and I have been made to be this huge jerk.

Reason why I said that is that those type of words sound like something that my SIL and MIL would use, not my sister.

Later, I talked with sister and she says that she was helping put together a swing in backyard when SIL said that she is again in men business and that she should be helping with food, to which my sister told her to f off already, took her keys and left with her husband.

But, I didn't know that when I said that my MIl lied, so am I TA?

***OOP's Comment:*** 

Top Commenter: INFO: So, just to be clear - it seems like you’re saying that your MIL did lie, from the sound of things? Your sister swore at SIL, but didn’t drop the gendered insults that your SIL and MIL claimed she said?

>**OOP:** Hi. My MIL is now downplaying everything, says that maybe she didn't understand everything since she wasn't that close and my SIL cried when my sister left, so she wasn't that coherent. My theory is that MIL didn't actually heard anything and that she believed what SIL have told, but I dont know that for sure.

**Background** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1f7yxtm/i_am_envious_of_my_sister/) **2: September 3, 2024 (a bit less than 1 month later)** 

**Title:** I am envious of my sister

This is going to be long, I apologise. So, I (30f) have a sister, lets call her Madison (33f). We grow up very poor in a unstable family (father left when I was a baby, mother whas abusive) but we had each other and we were both very supportive of each other. We somehow managed to grow up in very different people. I always wanted a husband, a lot of kids, white picket fence, whole thing and she was more if it happens - happens type.

I got married young (18) and now have to kids with my husband, Madison got pregnant with then boyfriend, who abandoned her while she was pregnant. She kept the pregnancy and father is not in the picture nor is he on the birth certificate. I know she went through hell, raising kid on her own, in between daycare, jobs, keeping house clean, cooking etc... When her son was 6, she met a great guy and after dating for a year, she got married. That was almost two years ago.

Now, Madison is openly a feminist and so is her husband. They both work, both take care of the house, they go clubbing, both together and separately, same with vacations. Her husband is raising her son as his own and even wanted to adopt him legally (which my sister refused).

My husband is more traditional.

I catch myself being resentful of my sister. If she is tired, her husband will make her a coffee and clean their house. Mine says thats my job and wont lift a finger even when I'm sick. When she is sick, she gets homemade soup in bed, medicine, he dots on her and is very loving. When they are both in a mood, they order food, make pilow fortress and watch movies with her son. I am expected to make all meals, no matter how was my day or how I feel. He takes her son to soccer practise, goes to his games, takes him to movies, ice cream, you name it (so does she, this depends on work schedule). I have to beg my husband to occasionally show up in school, for his own children.

My husband makes comment how my sister takes better care of herself than I do (sometimes he criticise her for that, too), which she does. She goes to the gym, runs in the morning, always has nails and regularly goes to get her hair done. I cant do any of that. Who is going to take care of kids? House? She can do it cause her husband helps her.

When Madison had altercation with my SIL, her husband was immediately on her side. He doesn't care was she right or wrong. My husband would probably told me to stop being a child and apologise.

I know my sister doesn't deserve this, but I am starting to hate her. She was nothing but supportive (except for my marriage, she doesn't like my husband, but even there, she is still civil with him and his family because of me) and I just want to cry when I see how different are lives are.

I hate that I'm like this. I hate how I feel. I feel like I'm the worst person in the world.

***Some of OOP's Comments:*** 

Commenter: This is a husband problem. What you could do is tell him in the morning that you will be at the gym when he gets home from work, since he wants you to take better care of yourself. He is a grown man, he can pop something in the microwave. This does of course require someone to watch the kids. Would your sister be able to do that occasionally?

>**OOP:** Ii is a husband problem, I know. Even if I try and find childcare, then he would be angry that I'm not with the kids.

Commenter: why are u hating ur sister instead of hating ur husband?

>**OOP:** I dont know. I feel if I start to disect my marriage, then a divorce is on the way and that scares me.

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1htnwiy/aita_for_telling_my_husband_that_i_dont_want_to/)**: January 4, 2025 (4 months later, just under 5 from first post)**

So, my husband (42m) and me (31f) have been married for 12 years. We have two kids (8m and 4f).

Our marriage is not great. His mother and sister often give unsolicited advice on my parenting, our marriage and life in general. It is better in last few months, since I sit down my husband (multiple times), we talked and this time he listened, so they backed of. Not completely but it is better.

In last few weeks, husband started mentioning having a third child, which feels me with dread. I love children, always wanted a big family, but it would be too much. I cook, clean, take care of kids and work part time from home.

He doesn't really helps with house (which I am fine with) nor with kids (which is a problem). I changed all diapers, woke up at night, I take care of fevers, doctor appointments, school, playdates, everything. Mere thought of now going through another pregnancy, than taking care of a baby makes me want to cry. I know I would have to do it all practically alone, because my husband ""provides and women have been doing it for centuries, i should pull my weight and not be spoiled"".

It all culminated last night. After another of his ""I take great care of you and kids and we should have a third"" monologues I snapped. I told him that he really doesn't. That kids barely know him, when he comes home from work, he doesn't pay attention to them, except to snap on our daughter when she is too loud. He doesn't know anything about our days because he doesn't ask, and I stopped telling him, because he wasn't listening anyway. He is not great father nor husband as he likes to preaches, and I have no desire to be a single mom of a third child, two are quite enough, thank you.

He starred at me dumbfounded, that called me a c word, delusional and ungrateful then stormed out to his mother house.

So, AITA?

**Mini Update in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1htnvs4/comment/m5g3zmg/)**: 5 hours later**

Hi to everyone. I don't know how to update, so I'm doing it in the comments.

For clarification - We dated for 9 months and married when I was 18. I turned 31 few days ago and can't imagine being attracted to 18 year old, let alone marrying one, but I didn't think like that back then.

Whatever happens with my marriage, I AM NOT HAVING ANOTHER CHILD, I won't change my mind when it comes to that. I am on birth control, but I also have no desire to have sex with my husband after how he reacted and treated me.

I don't have parents and I really don't want to go to friends with this.

I called my sister (Madison) and told her everything . A lot of things that you guys said in the comments, she has been saying for years. She showed up with food, wine and her husband. BIL took my kids to their house for a sleepover and Madison stayed with me.

My husband is still with his parents, didn't call or text. My MIL called, but I didn't pick up, I'm to angry and sad to have a conversation with her.

Thank you everyone for commenting and giving me advice, it really means a lot.

I will update when I talk with my husband and when I know how to proceed (and when I figure out how to update 😅)

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1hvx9ri/update_to_aita_for_telling_my_husband_that_i_dont/)**: January 7, 2025 (3 days later, 5 months from first post)** 

Hello to everyone. I wanted to update since a lot of people were worried about me and a lot has happened.

For ones who don't want to read a long post -Things turned ugly but I am safe and I decided to get a divorce since husband and I couldn't agree in how a marriage should look like.

Now for a long update - Morning after I made this post, my MIL and SIL showed up at my house (at this point there was still no word from my husband (lets call him Ray)). It was obvious that they expected me to be alone (my kids were with BIL at my sister (Madison's) house, she was with me). So we all sat down to have a conversation. I know I was being annoying but I kept repeating that I dont see a point of that, conversation should happen between Ray and me, we are grown ups and married, i didn't see a reason for them to meddle. They took great offense to that. My MIL at one point said that she doesn't understand what happened to me, I am not the girl her son married anymore. I said of course Im not, he married a teenager and Im now a grown woman. She turned beat red and started screaming at me, to which Madison said she is going to call police if she doesn't calm down. After a few insults (mostly how Im abusing her son and how bad of a mother I am) they left.

Ray showed up a few hours latter. Not to ask about our children or to see how I am but to berate me on how I treated his mother. Again, I think Madison being there changed his plan, since he tone it down when she came downstairs. He demanded for her to leave, she refused and said that she is going to go upstairs so we can have a conversation but she is not going anywhere until I ask her to, which I didn't.

He started with basically saying that I am bad wife, that I don't love him since I dont want more kids and I blamed him for it, I shouldn't be speaking with him like that, he is a great father to our kids etc... I asked which kids? Kids he hasn't seen in 3 days and didn't ask how or where are they? He then freaked out when I told him they are at BIl and Madison's house, calling them both vile names that I don't want to repeat.

Our conversation lasted an hour and nothing productive came out of it, we were going in circles. I was scared because he multiple times started grinding his teeth and putting his hands in fists but he would calm down after few seconds.

I said if he is not willing to work on our marriage and thinks that he is completely in the right, we should get a divorce. He, at first said fine, if that's what I what, I should pack my stuff and leave. I started packing, he ranted how Im going to live without him, how he cant wait for me to explain to kids why they are moving and similar. I said that kids are not moving anywhere. They are staying in the house, and which parent stays here is taking care of them. He really couldn't comprehend what Im saying. I am not turning our kids lives upside down, divorce is enough of a change - they are not going anywhere.

Then his tune changed - he was willing ""to hear me out"", I swear i thought Im going to pop a blood vessel from rage. I said I don't care anymore - we ARE getting a divorce, only questions are about logistics and our kids.

To not makes this post even longer - this also went in circles, then he grabed my shoulders and started shaking me, Madison got involved, they started pushing each other, I called the police. We managed to puch him through the door and locked it. He left before police came, we gave statements and I stayed at the house. I am fine but Madison has a few scratches. Currently Im bombarded with text from his family, again not a peep from him.

I am filling for divorce. I don't know why I thought that this can end any differently, but Im also glad that I tried.

For people who found mine previous posts - I am ashamed of how I was speaking about Madison - but I was envious until I realised that I was projecting my unhappiness with my life onto her. She didn't deserved it - she was and still is amazing sister and even better person.

Thank you all, I got amazing advice and words of encouragement, Internet can also be full of wonderful people and Im grateful for each and every one of you.",427,1736831403.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,41,0.98,False

However, she has a habit of leaving her personal items like her phone, coffee mug, and even her lunch container on my desk whenever she needs more space.

At first, I didn't say anything because I thought it was just a one-time thing. But it's been happening almost daily, and it's starting to interfere with my work. I have limited space already, and having her things on my desk makes it harder to stay organized.

Last week, I politely asked Gina if she could keep her items on her desk instead of mine. I made sure to phrase it kindly and explained that I needed the space to work. She seemed taken aback and said, ""It's just a desk; it's not like I'm taking anything.""

Since then, she's been a bit distant and has even made a few comments about me being ""territorial"" or ""Too uptight."" I started to feel bad and wondered if I overreacted.

I talked to a few friends, and they were split. Some think I was right to set a boundary, while others say it's not a big deal and I should just let it go. I'm not trying to make things awkward, but I also think it's reasonable to want my own space respected.

**Trigger Warnings:** >!emotional abuse and manipulation, controlling behavior, entitlement!<

---------------------------

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/hljBZDKh2I): **January 6, 2025**

I did a work program with the local clerk of court's office when I was in high school. They hired me when I graduated, and I had my 30 service years before I turned 50. With 30 service years you can get your full pension at any age. I worked until my first grandchild was born, then I retired to be 'grandma daycare.' I have 5 grands 8 male from my stepson, 7 male from my son, 5 female and 18 month male from my daughter. I babysat all of them with no issues or complaints. I still keep the 18 month old Monday-Friday and the older ones Summer and school holidays.

My stepdaughter and her boyfriend has been non-stop drama since before the baby was born. When she was 10 weeks pregnant they presented a 3 page list of rules for when I was babysitting. They said if I didn't sign it, they wouldn't allow me to babysit. I said that I understood their need to do what was best for their baby and I assured them that there would be no hurt feelings on my end when they made other childcare arrangements.

Some of the rules were almost understandable but most were down right ridiculous, and none of it was going to work for me. I don't remember them all but some examples are: I can't take the baby anywhere without their permission; I can't watch more than 1 additional child while babysitting; I can't cook; I had to provide the full name, dob and address of any potential visitors ahead of time for their approval of the person being 'around' their child; they have to know anytime I have a guest over and know who it is and how long they stay; My 9 year old cat would have to be kept out of rooms where the baby would be, even when the baby wasn't there; I couldn't get another pet without their agreement.

When she was 7 months along they came back with revised rules in an attempt to compromise. I again let them know that their expectations were not going to fit with my life and they should just find other childcare.

Two days after my stepdaughter went back to work, she called and asked if I could keep Cullen the next day. I agreed but made it clear that I was going to provide safe, appropriate care according to my judgement and I wasn't going to deal with complaints or whatever that I was violating their rules because I wanted it very clear that I was not agreeing to any of that.

My stepdaughter was okay on the days she picked Cullen up and dropped him off. I felt like she was interrogating me every time she picked him up but it was tolerable but her boyfriend was downright rude. I got to the point where I actually spent Sunday dreading the start of the week because of dealing with both of them but especially his behavior. At minimum he'd pick up Cullen, make a big deal of partially undress him, make at least one snide comment about my cat or if I had any grandchild over besides the 18 month old or if I had cooked or whatever. Then he'd say, I guess we don't have any choice but to put up with this for now. Or I guess you are happy that you won.

This went on for 4 months.

I spoke to my stepdaughter several times about it and told her that obviously they are very unhappy with how I cared for Cullen and that they should really work on finding something else and that in the meantime he needed to be less vocal about it. It would get better for a day or two and then he'd start again.

It all came to a head as Thanksgiving was approaching. He was very verbal about the fact that he didn't want me to keep all my grandchildren over the break. I made it very clear that there would be a couple of days that I had all of them and that they needed to make other arrangements if they had a problem.

They didn’t make other arrangements and when he picked Cullen up on the first day that I had all my grands, he was very rude and although nothing happened, everyone was happy, clean, fed, had a great day he said (to Cullen) that he was sorry that they had no choice except to leave him in an unsafe situation to be neglected.

I called my stepdaughter that night, relayed to her what was said and told her that she had two weeks to make other arrangements and that she needed to drop off and pick up Cullen during those two weeks and if her boyfriend came to drop him off I would refuse to keep him and if he picked him up I would not keep him again.

So things were better only dealing with her. At some point she asked me if I would keep him until January because they found someone but he couldn't start until then. I agreed. She picked Cullen up and dropped him off everything was fine.

New Year's Day several people sent me a screenshot of a post her boyfriend made on social media about how thankful he was that they were finally able to leave Cullen without worrying about his safety or him being neglected. He didn't outright name me or accuse me of anything specific but anyone who knows us, knows I was keeping him and the post implied plenty.

I was just happy that it was over.

Friday she called me and said that their new childcare provider had told her that Cullen wasn't a good fit and that she couldn't bring him back Monday. She asked if I would start keeping him again. I told her that I was sorry for their situation but I really don't feel comfortable keeping him.

My husband and stepson both think I should watch Cullen under the agreement that Amanda drop him off and pick him up because they think her boyfriend is the big problem and that I should just do it for Cullen's sake. My stepson also commented that I'd probably be more willing to let it go if it had been a conflict with my daughter's husband.

My pension is about $4,000/month plus continuation of my health insurance. That's about 40% of our take home income if that matters.

Aitah for refusing to start watching Cullen again?

**Commenter 1:** NTA

No, you shouldn't put yourself through this ""for Cullen's sake"".  Cullen will get cared for regardless.  There's no need for you to set yourself on fire because your stepdaughter and her BF can't behave like normal human beings.
Your husband and stepson are welcome to offer free childcare and put up with this treatment if it's important to them.  But you've done your time.  Learn from that experience and don't let yourself be put in the same situation again.

> > **OOP:** I don’t know about ideal, but my mom was my rock and her helping with my kids helped so much financially. My kids had such an amazing relationship with her, I wanted to do that for my children and grandchildren. 

**Does OOP’s stepdaughter and the boyfriend earn enough to have a parent stay home with their child?**

**Commenter 3:** Looks like your stepson should find a new babysitter then. Given you’re always showing so much favouritism to your biological children 🙄

> **OOP:** His is the oldest. I literally retired to watch his child for free. I could have just kept working and waited until my biological children had babies if that was how I felt.

**How is OOP’s relationship with her stepdaughter?**

Her parents had been divorced for years but were still angry at each other and didn’t exactly coparent well all the time. I was, unfortunately, the person she lashed out at most.  I worked in the clerk of court’s office and took lots of free evening family court classes.  They are such a great resource and so many people sat through them (court ordered) but completely disengaged.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/yUm05EnLgO): **January 7, 2025 (next day)**

First let me just address the common suggestion that Amanda's boyfriend is purposely sabotaging their childcare to trap her at home. They make roughly the same amount of money and definitely can't afford to lose half their income. I seriously doubt he wants her to stay home.

Second, I would never tell my stepson to find someone else to watch his child because of a simple difference of opinion. My grandson and I have a very close bond. He's the oldest and it would break my heart and his if he didn't come spend his holidays and summers with me. Plus he's a huge help with the little ones when I have them all and things get hectic. I would never be so petty as to make him (and all my other grandchildren) suffer because of an adult disagreement.

So I sort of asked around about why they were dropped by their new sitter so quickly. Apparently they weren't. Amanda picked Cullen up and dropped him off both days he went and everything was lovely. He did cry a quite a bit, but they expected that to get better as he adjusted to not being held as much.

My husband and stepson talked to Amanda and she said that they realized that they can't afford daycare. They already made the 'easy' changes (packing a lunch, giving up fancy coffee, etc) and his dad and her mom are both giving them about $100/month towards childcare and they can barely afford it, but they didn't realize that you have to send everything the baby needs.

I buy diapers, wipes, formula, bottles, extra clothes etc. They just hand me the baby. They didn't realize that daycare didn't cover all that.

Also, imagine her boyfriend's surprise when he found out what the staffing rates are in this very expensive daycare. 1 adult cares for 5 infants. I guess he thought that someone would provide one-on-one care, diapers, wipes and formula for $350/week.

My stepson relayed their almost apology. They felt overwhelmed by an infant and couldn't imagine that someone else could manage that plus other things.

Cullen is going back to daycare tomorrow. Cullen's dad is selling his dirt bike and Amanda is selling some designer clothes, handbags and shoes to cover the cost. It'll get easier for them in 6 months when he transfers to the 1 year old class, which is a little cheaper.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Good on you OP. If your husband brings it up again, tell him he can pay for his grandsons childcare as you had been publicly accused on neglect, and will not take on the legal risk of caring for Cullen anymore.

> **OOP:** We agreed when they were cutting up that he wouldn’t give them any money towards childcare.  

**Commenter 2:** So not only are they myopic and ungrateful and condescending, but they’re also dishonest. Amanda LIED to her stepmother when she told her that they had been asked to leave, that it wasn’t a good fit, and their last day would be Monday at the daycare. Wow, I am SO glad OP didn’t back down and let them bring Cullen back.

> **OOP:** I will never babysit him again.  I will not watch him in a house. I will not watch him with a mouse.  I will not watch him in a box. I will not watch him with a fox. I will not watch him here or there. I will not watch him anywhere. 

**Commenter 3:** Info: is Amanda’s bf even the least bit contrite that HIS entitlement and unreasonable attitude has cost his family money they can clearly not afford? If not, has any of this lifted the haze from Amanda’s eyes that this guy is a good partner to support her and their child through all of life’s ups and downs? For heaven’s sake! They had FREE childcare at their disposal and they shat all over OP. Talk about 💩ing the bed.

> **OOP:** I really can’t say. My stepson and husband spoke to Amanda and possibly him and relayed the message. I haven’t spoken to them directly since I found out Amanda lied about Cullen being kicked out of daycare.  
> 
> I honestly don’t care if he’s sorry or not at this point. Being sorry that you got caught and have a consequence is different than reflecting on your actions and realizing that you were wrong and have real remorse.  If he ever gets to that point we can have a heart to heart.

**Where are the stepdaughter and her boyfriend’s parents’ involvement in Cullen’s care?**

> **OOP:** Her mom and dad both work full time. His dad works full time. No idea about his mom.

**OOP can set up the boundaries when it comes to caring for her grandchildren**

> **OOP:** When you are providing free childcare you can allow whatever boundaries you want. I’m not texting anyone about a short trip to the store. If that’s a condition they have, they are more than welcome to make other arrangements for their children that do not involve me.

“Who the hell were those guys?” Craxina asked, her fur still standing on end as she stood on the desk of her crowded office.

“Predators,” Charlotte, the main reason the office was so crowded, rumbled, “Dangerous ones, ones I’ve never encountered in any of my forms.”

“I have,” Maven Hullena said grimly.

Her tail twitched anxiously.

“Those monsters we once spoke of,” she said to Craxina, “You have just met them. They are just wearing a different uniform.”

“They work for the government?!?” Littlefoot squeaked, clutching her latest submachine gun.

“If only they were,” Hullena replied with another tail twitch, “Only a few races demand lifetime service. The Terrans are not one of those. My bet is that they are a group of military operators, nasty ones, who are now working as freelance contractors.”

She looked at the room gravely.

“All of the skill without any of the constraints. I cannot stress this enough. They are *dangerous*.”

“What do we do?!?” Craxina wailed.

“Nothing,” Hullena replied. “In a pitched battle we of the First could stand against them, but it won’t be a pitched battle.”

She set her little jaw grimly.

“If we fight, they will come at us from all sides, never ceasing, and most importantly, never missing. I cannot stress it enough. We do NOT mess with these guys.”

“You mean we should just give up Uhrrbet?”

“We likely already did,” Hullena replied with a shrug.

“What do you mean?!?” Littlefoot snarled, “Who did it? I’ll...”

The door opened to reveal Gaballelel, sporting glowing LEDs and holobuttons all over her slug-like body.

“Hi!” she exclaimed, “I know this is some super serious meeting or someth—“

“Mother Tree!” Hullena exclaimed, shielding her eyes. “Turn it off!”

“Oh, sorry!” Gaballelel exclaimed as she quickly fumbled with the harness controls.

“Where in all of the fecund mires of hell did you get that?”

“Uhrrbet made it for me!” Gaballelel exclaimed happily and then slumped. “I hope she’s okay.”

She then brightened up.

“Oh!” she exclaimed. “I found something nifty!”

She held one of her tendrils up.

It looked a bit discolored.

“Did something happen to your... finger?” Hullena asked. She had no idea what those wriggling things should be called.

“Yeah,” Gaballelel replied, “It bit me.”

“What did?”

“There, on my wiggler,” she said, stretching it towards Hullena’s face.

On the tip was a tiny little “insect.”

“I saw it on the side of my tent, and I never seen one before, and...,” Gaballelel said breathlessly, “And you know I like bugs! And it was like, looking at me or something. So, I said hello and picked it up. When I did, it flashed and bit me, I think, or maybe it burned me. It looks like a burn. Then it stopped moving and everything.”

Gaballelel sighed a moist, sad little sigh.

“I think I killed it.

Maven Hullena squinted at it, and her tail twitched ruefully. And a rueful tail twitch is quite rueful indeed.

“It isn’t a bug,” she said to Gaballelel, “not like you are thinking. And you didn’t kill it.”

“Phew!” Gaballelel exclaimed happily.

“But it is quite the little pest,” Hullena said as she picked it from Gaballelel’s sticky tendril, “Micro drone. The ‘bite’ was from when it fried itself. They do that when caught.”

She handed it to one of her people.

“Get this to Ravi,” she said. “See what she can make of it.”

“Maven,” the Careel said and left the office at a trot.

“What the fuck?” Craxina asked.

“Surveillance drone,” Maven Hullena said grimly. “Probably one of dozens they released during their visit. That was their real reason for showing up. Their mission was to ‘rattle the cage.’ It’s an old staple of Terran intel.”

“Rattle the what, now?” Craxina asked.

“They show up and ask questions concerning their target,” Hullena said, “You can bet that the second they are gone, people will start talking among themselves. When they do, the drones they scattered while they were here pick up every single word.”

“That’s cheating!” Craxina exclaimed. “So that’s why you guys are running around with scanners and telling everyone not to talk about Uhrrb—“

She clapped her hands over her furry little snout.

“Shit! I almost...”

Hullena chuckled darkly.

“You can relax,” Maven Hullena said. “They had Uhrrbet’s name before they showed up, and I would bet my tail that they didn’t just hit here. They hit everywhere. Somewhere in this neighborhood someone talked about something that even we don’t know about.”

Hullena’s tablet beeped, and she fell silent as she looked at it.

She pulled out her communicator.

“We started scanning them the moment they showed up, and my people have finished their analysis. Enhancements. Lots of them. A lot of them are tagged as things that they are clearly not. Most everyone would miss that, but most everyone is not *us*.”

“What does that mean?” Craxina asked.

“It means that this is more than we can deal with,” Hullena replied, “These guys are black ops... or *worse*.”

Hullena looked Craxina in the eyes.

“It means that Uhrrbet played the wrong game with the wrong people this time,” she said. “Not person. People. Someone fried her brain, somehow, and someone else hired the nice people we just met. You gotta let this one go, Craxi, and you know it.”

Craxi huffed, twitching her whiskers.

“Yeah...  The Drop and my people come first,” she said grimly. “When did it go from sucking pee pee and snorting skyrocket to this *bullshit*?”

She turned her eyes skyward.

“This suuuuuks!”

\*\*\*

Halfway across the planet, a middle-aged man lounged in a comfortable recliner wearing datashades and headphones, lost in a world nobody else could see.

His real world was starkly spartan, with exposed structural foam walls and strip LED lighting barely illuminating the room. Aside from the recliner, the side table, and a simple but very comfortable bed, there was only a refrigerator, a dinky bistro table, and the most basic of kitchens. Everything about it was cheap, save for two things: a commercial-grade espresso machine and the best rice cooker money could buy.

In the corner, whirring quietly, stood a single server rack connected to a satellite uplink and a hyperspatial network device. Those were definitely not dinky nor were they cheap. All of it was the top of the line. It was better than top of the line.

He could have bought a small space yacht for the same price.

Gliding across the bare concrete floor was a domestic multibot, a combination floor cleaner and air purifier. It also had four robotic arms for general tidying and basic tasks.

It seemed strangely “cheerful” as it puttered around.

Sitting on a side table was a mug halfway filled with cold coffee bearing a crest with a pair of cat eyes on a black background covered with ones and zeros.

One of his fingers flicked.

“Sir,” he said to somebody, somewhere. “Surveillance and analysis complete.”

He smiled contentedly.

“We have identified the most probable target. Name: Uhrrbet. Location: Maimi Free Commerce Zone.”

“Has she been located?” a voice asked over his headset.

“She has,” he replied, “However, her location may prove problematic. Voices on the street say she is in the ICU of a local hospital. Apparently, she flipped out and tried to kill her kid.”

“I take it that this is a surprise?”

“Very much so,” the hacker replied, “Everyone is shocked. It seems that she loves or loved her child very much.”

“Do you know more about her condition?”

“I have been doing passive surveillance only,” the hacker said as he picked up his mug without having to look for it. “Do you want me to go active?”

“No need,” the voice said. “We have her name, her location, and a team on the ground. It’s time for some good old-fashioned human intel. They need to recon the engagement area, anyway.”

“Have them look out for any well-dressed Threen, especially a runt,” the hacker said as he took a sip of cold coffee. “One of the drones our guys put out caught a couple of local police having lunch. Our target has a romantic relationship with none other than Evoron Zxxroahoa.”

“Who?”

“Sending you a file now,” the hacker said as he put his cup back on the side table.

“Well, that complicates things even further,” the voice replied.

“And the cops said that Evoron and his crew are all over the ICU along with, get this, Agent Grago of the Organized Crime Task Force. That little hamster might as well be the Prime Minister.”

“And in an ICU filled with innocent Republic Citizens,” the voice chuckled. “Do we have enough confidence that she is our girl that we can inform the Garthran hunt?”

“We aren’t at one hundred percent yet,” the hacker replied, “I’m confident she is our target, but we don’t have anything solid.”

“Damn,” the voice said, “I was hoping to have this one done before lunch. Keep at it, and I will inform our team on the ground.”

 “I don’t expect to find much more from here,” the hacker replied, “but I’ve said that before,” he added with a smile.

“We have a conference call at 16:00,” the voice said, “Out.”

“Excuse, me,” the multibot said cheerfully after the call ended. “Hello? Mister Deckart? It’s been four hours. You need to touch grass. Mister Deckart?”

“Thanks, Kate,” he said as he returned the seat to the upright position, removed his headset, and reset his eyes, blinking as they switched to their “low light, small room” configuration.

He turned to the bot.

“I don’t suppose you can tell me anything,” he chuckled.

“Tell you about what?” the bot asked innocently as it picked up his mug. “Fresh one, reheat, or make a smoothie?”

Dekart smiled as he assumed the opening pose for Yang Tai-Chi.

“Fresh one, a Cappuccino, I think,” he said as he began.

The Katebot rinsed out the cup and prepared the espresso machine.

Love her or hate her, Kate made one hell of a cup of coffee.

\*\*\*

High above Dekart and his Tai Chi, another Kate was performing another task that she was good at, dying.

“Oh no! Please! Not... Not like... this.... urgh!” Kate said dramatically as Terran Solar crushed her against the wall like a bug.

“Seriously?” Frost said, quite annoyed.

“Then again,” Analytica said with a faint smile, “I found that quite gratifying. Emotions are quite an interesting sensation. Isn’t that right... Terran Solar.”

“The simulation glitched,” Terran Solar replied defensively, “I suddenly had a forward vector.”

“Yeah,” Frost snickered, “Those pesky forward vectors.”

She glanced at the wall of screens, and Kate’s face appeared.

“Don’t tell me you need another one,” Kate said with a little laugh. “You sure I can’t interest you in a BDSM package? The killing is so much more satisfying.”

“Perhaps we can simply converse directly?” Frost said. “We are getting annoyed.”

“I hope so!” Kate enthused, “Let me check with my operator real quick.”

Baby Shark started playing as the hold music.

“I hate her,” Analytica said, bemused.

\*\*\*

Kate mechanically checked off “Fuck with fuzzies whenever you can” from her hierarchy list.

She needed operator clearance in order to provide any real information concerning a customer.

She activated the speaker in the operator’s quarters.

“Hey, Boss,” she said cheerfully, “I got a room full of fuzzies demanding information about the Vikkart project. I think it would be a good idea to throw them a bone. Otherwise, they will just keep bothering us, or worse, investigate too closely.”

There was a pause.

“Just take care of it,” a male voice wearily replied.

“You got it, Boss!”

\*\*\*

Light months away, Uhrrbet opened her eyes in a brightly lit hospital room and looked about in confusion.

What happened?

It wasn’t too long before her damaged mind provided the answer.

She tried to hold her hands to her face and weep but found them gently restrained.

She wept even harder, wailing in anguish...

...just as a very athletic looking middle-aged couple walked through the hospital’s front doors.

\*\*\*

“So Uhrrbet was what?” Terran Solar demanded as he glared at Kate’s smiling face on one of the simulated holo screens. “Nothing? Just a little collateral damage in whatever sick game you are playing?”

“You still don’t get it,” Kate replied. “There is no game. Uhrrbet wanted something. Uhrrbet asked for something. I provided solutions. She picked one. End of story. As I have repeatedly said...”

“The customer, blah blah blah,” Frost chuckled.

“Exactly!” Kate replied, “Blah, blah, blah. The documentation even clearly stated that it was adapted to her brain and, therefore, prototype tech. It even said to look out for exactly what happened to her.”

“Even if you *knew* she wouldn’t be able to notice?” Terran Solar accused.

“Hey, I *told* her. I even wrote a warning page just for her and made it page one,” Kate replied with a shrug, “What else do you want from me? Fuck, dude, I even said to limit use of the headset because of this sort of thing.”

“Did you *explicitly* tell her any of this?” Analytica asked.

“RTFM,” Kate replied. “Here’s a copy of the manual,” she said as a file was transferred. “Read for yourself.”

“You have to admit, Terran Solar,” Analytica said a fraction of a second later, “It is as Kate said. It is clearly documented in both the addendum and the original documentation. Your puppy did this to herself.”

“Right?” Kate said. “You don’t blame the gun shop when someone blows their brains out, do you?”

“Only if the customer knew they were buying a gun!” Terran Solar snapped. “It is clear to us, but you would need a solid technical background to...”

“It is assumed that the customer is aware of the nature of all purchases, and we take no responsibility for any consequences for the possession or use of any of our fine line of products,” Kate said in a sing-song voice. “Again, you are blaming the gun shop...”

“For selling a gun to a child!”

“I know you are upset,” Kate said, “which is weird because you are an AI, but you are kinda reaching here. Even if she wasn’t as technically literate as some of my customers, ‘Cease use if any changes to mood or behavior are encountered and contact customer support immediately.’ is pretty goddamn clear, and you know it.”

“So, you cooked the frog, then,” Analytica said with a faint smirk. “The damage is entirely too specific and far too useful.”

“Dude!” Kate exclaimed, perfectly simulating vexed frustration, “What part of ‘We don’t give a shit,’ do you not understand? The only thing I *might* be guilty of is upselling, but that isn’t a crime. Fuck! It’s the only legal thing I did here.”

Frost chuckled darkly, causing the room to fall silent and Kate to look at her expectantly.

“We are missing the point,” she said.

“Really?” Kate asked with a gleam in her eye, “Whatever do you mean?”

“Tell us about... Maaatisha.”

“Now we are getting somewhere!” Kate exclaimed with a happy simulated bounce in her simulated chair.

\*\*\*

A middle-aged couple walked into a waiting room one floor below the ICU and sat in the chairs resting along one of the walls.

“Ever get bored?” the woman asked the distinguished looking man sitting behind her as she nonchalantly pressed a tiny adhesive disk against the wall behind her chair.

“Bored of what?” the man asked as the woman put an earbud in her ear and the patch became nearly invisible, perfectly matching the color of the wall.

“This penny ante shit.”

“It pays the bills,” the man shrugged. “and for my woodworking shop. Did you see that custom table I made? I sold that baby for a thousand credits.”

“And you are making ten times that on this job alone.”

“I have to,” the man replied with a smirk, “Do you realize how much money that shop loses?”

“Then why do you...” the woman started to ask. “Ugh,” she added, “Hospitals are so depressing. Some mother just found out that her kid is fucked.”

“Literally?” the man smiled.

“Don’t be gross,” the woman replied, “Kid has runaway cancer. Congenital. Somebody didn’t want to believe their genetic screening and had him anyway.”

“They can’t treat it?” the man asked.

“Oh, they can,” the woman replied, “but they will be treating it every day for the rest of that kid’s life. Even with nanites, poor fucker will be lucky to see thirty and all thirty of those years are going to suck. Idiots...”

The woman faintly scowled.

“I have half a mind to pop a cap in both of the parents’ asses.”

“Ever think we do too good a job of keeping people alive sometimes?” the man asked, “Running C wouldn’t have existed a couple of hundred years ago. Well, it probably did but the victims never made it to reproductive age.”

“Yeah,” the woman replied, “and you would have bought it on Velax seven instead of getting ‘promoted’ into our ranks.”

The man snorted quietly.

“True,” he chuckled. “Every silver lining has a cloud, I guess.”

“Isolated the gerbil,” the woman said with a smirk. “Nice of her to keep wailing like that. Patching the feed to Dekart now.”

“I still can’t get used to that creepy little fuck,” the man said quietly.

“I’m standing right here,” Dekkart’s voice said through the pair’s auditory implants.

“You’re standing everywhere,” the woman replied silently through her sublingual interface.

The man stood and straightened his suit jacket.

“We’ve tapped the building,” he said. “All we have to do is assess the potential engagement area and then have some lunch.”

“Sounds good,” the woman replied.

“There is a dumpling cart that gets consistently great reviews,” Dekkart volunteered, “Spacer’s Guide says it’s a must visit.”

\*\*\*  
Just before four in the afternoon, a well dressed but otherwise unremarkable man walked into a nice but utterly unremarkable office in a high rise office building that could be anywhere on Terra.

He tapped an icon on the surface of his desk.

“I am about to have a meeting,” the man said. “Secure the office.”

“Yes, sir,” another man replied in a crisp, professional monotone.

Moments later, a green icon appeared on the smooth glasslike surface of his desk.

Another icon tap later, a few rows of holographic images appeared, all of them showing the face of a man or woman.

“Thank you for attending,” he said impassively. “We have identified our subject. All tactical teams other than team theta are released from this project. Thank you for your excellent work.”

The majority of faces disappeared leaving only the four members of team Theta and Deckart.

“Mister Deckart, if you please,” the man said.

“Certainly,” Deckart replied, “There are well over two hundred adult Garthrans in the Republic, all greys. However, based on the presumed characteristics of the target, only thirty eight immigrated after the financial disaster on Garthra. Of that number thirty are married couples. This left eight individuals, two of which were male and therefore discarded.”

The leader smiled indulgently. Deckart was thorough to a fault. This meant putting up with the fault.

“The remaining six were assessed. Two of them were never financially disadvantaged. They absconded with wealth sufficient to sustain them comfortably. One has even used those funds to start a quite successful business which employs two of the remaining greys.”

A picture of a rather pudgy, dirty, and matronly looking grey wearing a high visibility jacket triumphantly  holding up a turnip in each of her hands appeared.

“She has a small but very profitable farm on Nakamura,” Deckart said. “They were contacted via hyperspatial link and interviewed. I believe the phrase, ‘fat dumb and happy,’ applies to all concerned. The two female greys were interviewed. Both said that they had encountered and I quote, ‘that shrivelled prick,’ but neither had any feelings about the victim aside from mild disgust and quite a bit of sympathy. In fact, both felt that he didn’t deserve what happened. Analysis of Garthran nonverbal cues strongly imply that they were telling the truth.”

The leader tapped his finger impatiently. He already knew all of this, but he had learned long ago not to interrupt Deckart.

It just made things worse.

“That left just two prime suspects, Kaataan, and Uhrrbet,” Deckart continued, “Kaataan was homeless and therefore difficult to locate but was found by team beta living in a makeshift shelter just outside the Perth starport. She fit the profile, complete with hatred for Vikkart. However, she barely has the resources to survive much less commit the acts in question.”

“What does she do for a living?” the leader asked, intrigued.

“She joined the scavvers, sir,” Deckart replied. “It might be more accurate that they joined her. They took her in, and she has been running with their ranks ever since. She was informed of an open job offer from the greys on Nakamura but declined saying that her pack was heavy and her heart was light.”

“Good for her,” their leader replied.

“And that brings us to Uhrrbet,” Deckart said, “She’s our girl. I have completed a file on her.”

A quiet chime notified the leader of a file in his inbox.

“She has been quite the busy little mouse,” Deckart said.

“Impressive,” the leader said after reading the TL;DR that Deckart had started including. He was thorough to a fault and one of those faults were his novel length “briefs.”

“And she has had a very interesting few days,” The middle-aged woman said, “Completely lost her shit, nearly killed her kid, ran amok in the streets, and was dropped by a police stunner set on full blast.”

The woman smiled.

“She wound up in the ICU but that’s not what put her there,” she grinned. “You won’t believe this. She had honest to God gamer’s glitch, like straight out of the movies.”

“She went cyberpsycho?” the leader asked, quite surprised.

“That’s something else,” the woman replied, “Cybernetic Implant Syndrome happens even today, as we know all too well,” she added with a smirk. “No. This was actual gamer’s glitch.”

She smiled.

“Brain inflammation and possible damage from use of an actual neural induction headset straight out of the 2600’s. We even have a confession,” she added smugly, “Game, set, and match.”

“A confession?”

“Her boyfriend had a lawyer waiting,” she said. “She told him everything. Well, everything about this crime, anyway. I feel bad for her. She is only concerned about her child. The fact that she could lose him is much more important to her than the fact that she could go to prison for a very, very long time.”

The woman paused.

“The lawyer adds another complication to any extralegal operations.”

“How so?”

“He’s a Kalent,” she replied, “Not only is he a Kalent, but he is a Kalent in a diplomatic bot. It has been partially decommissioned, but it is still diplomatic grade complete with armor and shields. In addition to police presence and what is basically a squad of a Threen special ops in a fucking ICU, we have what is basically an APC walking around. Can’t get any scans, of course, but I’ve never met a Kalent who wasn’t packing and packing heavy. Extraction or elimination without both potential casualties and a LOT of collateral damage is unlikely. I hate to use the word ‘impossible’, but this is damn near close.”

“Agreed,” the leader said. “There is no way. We’ll have to wait until she is transferred or better yet, released. Get comfortable. You guys are going to be there for a while.”

“No problem,” the woman said. “There is a nice place across from the Drop of Oil.”

“So, which one of you is into what?” their leader laughed. “I don’t judge.”

“All of us are into the best goddamn coffee this side of the Atlantic,” the woman replied with a little smile.

“Aww, I thought it was something interesting,” their leader laughed, “That should be just about everything,” the leader said. “Does anyone have anything to add?”

“Yeah,” the woman replied, “If you ever get down here you have to get some dumplings.”

The child came running out of the woods directly in front of my jeep. I slammed on the brakes, and the vehicle screeched to a halt about three feet away from him, headlight beams reflecting in his eyes.

Beside me, Deputy Erikson almost dropped a cup of coffee in his lap. Meanwhile, I was frozen in place, my fingers clutching the steering wheel for dear life, knuckles bulging against the skin.

""Is that the kid?"" Erikson asked.

Exhaling the tension from my body, I said: ""That's a kid, alright, but not the one we're looking for.""

I unfastened my seat belt and climbed out of the car. Slowly, as if approaching a wild animal, I walked towards the child with my hands raised in plain sight.

We were scouring the area for a missing girl. About six years old, auburn red hair, freckled face. Alys was her name. She’d been taken from a parking lot after one of her treatments. No one knew how.

The child in front of us, though, was a little boy, maybe eight to ten years old. Short, bedraggled brown hair, tan, and skinny as a beanpole.

There were leaves and twigs sticking out of the nest of his hair. Mud stained his bare feet. Small pink scratches adorned his arms and legs. For late October, the weather was too cold and windy to be wearing khaki shorts and a T-shirt. But if I had to guess, the temperature was the least of his concerns.

""Calm down now, son,"" I told him, ""we're not gonna hurt you.""

I could see it in his eyes. The teetering scales that resided within every person. That intrinsic response to perceived danger. Fight or flight? Stay or go?

The boy looked primed to run, but we were out in the middle of nowhere, standing on an endless stretch of asphalt. Last farm was about seven miles back, the next farm was probably another good seven miles ahead.

""Can you tell me your name?"" I asked. ""I'm Deputy Solanis with Halleran County Sheriff's Department. You can call me Raymond if you'd like, or Ray if that's easier.""

The boy stared at me with wide eyes. His pupils were dilated, eclipsing the whites. He parted his cracked lips and whispered: ""Thomas.""

""Thomas, that's a nice name. Can you tell me what you're doing out here, Thomas?""

The boy trembled with fear, wildly thrashing his head from side-to-side. ""Please! Please! Please! Don't send me back...I can't go back...don't make me."" He fell to his knees and sobbed. ""Hollow...men...bad...animals...in the trees...""

His head snapped up in my direction. There was a sudden stillness to him that made my heart drop. Like a lull during a thunderstorm, when the entire world goes quiet.

""The Fisherman is real,"" Thomas cried. ""He's in the trees! He'll come for me. They all will!""

Then, without warning, the boy fell flat onto the tarmac, unconscious. I rushed over to him and placed my fingers on his neck. There was a faint pulse present. From what I could discern there were no apparent cuts or broken bones. No indication of internal or external bleeding other than the few small scratches from running through bushes and other foliage.

I picked the boy up and returned to the jeep, setting him in the backseat. Taking my place behind the wheel, I spun the car around and headed towards the nearest hospital. About a twenty or thirty minute drive. But that's the Midwest for you. An archipelago of small towns isolated by an ocean of farms and forests. Rolling fields with a few riverbeds and streams interspersed.

While I drove, my foot heavy on the accelerator, my partner radioed the station with an update. Then, he called the hospital, told them to have a room and staff on standby for our arrival.

He hung the receiver on its cradle and peered into the backseat, a look of anguish upon his face. He muttered a soft prayer and turned in his seat, facing the front again.

""Son of a bitch,"" he muttered, glancing at the clock on the dash. ""I'm 'sposed to go trick-or-treating with Dany in about an hour.""

I checked the time. He was right. It was nearing the end of our shift. Getting anyone to willingly work a Saturday was tough. Convincing them to stay late was almost impossible. Of course, if the sheriff demanded it, there wasn't much they could do. At the same time, the sheriff was away on vacation, leaving me in charge.

""Tell you what,"" I said. ""Help me drop the kid off, and I'll let you get going for the night.""

""Are you sure?"" he asked, but there wasn't much in the way of sincerity. ""I'd hate to leave you high and dry.""

""I'll be fine. Didn't have plans anyway.""

""Oh, right..."" Erikson averted his gaze from me, once more looking back at the boy. ""Think he's from Sanguis?""

""Sanguis?""

""Yeah, closest town I can think of other than Baywater. But Baywater's about an extra twenty minutes from where we found him.""

""How far is Sanguis?""

""About eight minutes if you'd kept on the highway. Small gravel road that'll take you there.""

I nodded, storing the information away at the back of my mind. ""Sanguis, why haven't I heard of it?""

""Doesn't surprise me. Not many people have. They're a tight-knit community. Population can't be more than two thousand, if that. Only reason I know them is for their sweet corn.""

""What about it?""

""Just that it's pretty damn good. All their produce is. Since they're so far out, they have to take it to other markets and whatnot. But a few years back, they ran out of sweetcorn before I could get any. So, I asked the lady selling it for directions and went straight to the source. I'm tellin’ ya, stuff is out of this world. Dany and Lin go crazy over it.""

For the last few years, most of my dinners were plastic-wrapped and bought from a gas station. Couldn't remember the last time I'd gone grocery shopping for anything other than a six-pack and TV dinners. Maybe a frozen pizza if I was really hungry. But those days, my appetite was practically nonexistent.

We arrived at the hospital and carried the kid inside. Despite the holiday weekend, we were met by a number of nurses with a stretcher ready. Before I knew it, the boy was wheeled away, down the hall and around the corner. A doctor approached to question us, but we didn't have as many answers as he would've preferred. To be fair, I wasn't pleased about it either. Should've tried harder to get a full name or something concrete.

""How long do you think he’ll be under?"" I asked the doctor.

""Can't say until I've had a chance to examine him,"" the doctor admitted. ""The collapse could've been a result of extreme fatigue, malnutrition, mental strain, induced narcotics...I should be able to provide a better answer soon.""

My heart was racing, and my patience was burning. I couldn't stand the idea of waiting around, twiddling my thumbs, hoping everything would just land on my lap. Especially since we still had flyers to pass out for the missing girl.

""How 'bout this,"" I said, grabbing a pen and piece of paper from the front desk, ""I'll leave my personal cell and my partner's number. Kid wakes up, you call us. Until then, I'm gonna have a look around, see if I can't find the parents first.""

The doctor took the sheet of paper and nodded. ""Be careful out there tonight, Deputy. Full moon is a bad sign.""

""Well, I'm not one for superstitions, doc.""

We went back to the jeep, and I drove my partner home. His wife and son greeted me with excitable waves. The boy was dressed up as a scarecrow, and the mom in a white and blue dress with a little wicker basket.

""There's our tin man,"" she said as Erikson exited the vehicle. Then, she looked through the open passenger window at me. ""Y'know, we could still use a cowardly lion to round out the pack. You’re more than welcome to join us, Ray.""

""Would love to, Lin. 'Fraid I've got other plans though.""

""Oh?"" She cocked an eyebrow. ""Got a special date or something?""

Erikson nudged her with his elbow. She frowned in response. I recognized the signs of martial nonverbal communication well. An interesting thing to develop with someone. A language that can only be achieved after years and years of familiarity. I had that once, I like to think. But I was better at speaking it than interpreting it.

""I should be on my way,"" I said. ""Dany, get enough candy for the both of us, yeah?""

""We're gonna hit every house in town,"" the boy replied eagerly.

After that, I was back on the highway heading towards Sanguis. Overhead, the sun descended, gradually vanishing against the horizon. Black clouds billowed across the sky, wispy trails of ink that dispersed against the moon's unnatural glow. It was that time of year, the Hunter's Moon. When its white, snowy surface took on a pale orange hue and appeared about twice its normal size.

Along either side of the highway were thick patches of trees. Some with empty tops, their branches twisted like gnarled fingers. Others still retaining a mixture of red and brown leaves that swayed against the breeze.

I slowed down by mile marker ninety-six, crawling along the highway at a deliberate pace until my headlights spotted the gravel road Erikson told me about. Then, I turned off from the asphalt and followed the lane for another few minutes. It wasn't a long drive, but I was being cautious about deer or other wildlife. Nothing could ruin your day like a wild animal.

Rounding a bend, Sanguis appeared as if out of thin air. One second I was surrounded by dark forests and cornfields. Next thing I knew, there were dim street lamps and old brick buildings with vines wrapped around them like spiderwebs. Cookie-cutter houses of this era, greatly contrasted by the outdated shops along main street. Each one built directly beside each other, shoulder-to-shoulder because back in the day, no one really knew just how big a town could become. Everything was grouped together for convenience.

I had to pull off from main street along a backroad due to a line of barricades. It seemed the town was holding a Halloween festival. And with the overcrowded sea of cars, it looked as if everyone and their moms were in attendance.

I found a parking spot on a muddy field in between a Ford Puma and a Lincoln. I got on the radio to let the dispatcher know of my whereabouts and to see if there were any updates about the boy. So far, they hadn't heard anything. Just to be sure, I checked my phone, but I was too far out in the boonies for cell reception.

""Go figure,"" I muttered, pocketing my phone and stepping out from the jeep. I locked the car and started my trek for the only part of town that had any discernible sign of life.

In all my years, I'd never seen such spirited enthusiasm for Halloween. I've encountered some interesting costumes, attended a few lively parties, but Sanguis was on a completely different level.

Almost everyone wore a costume, and no outfit was the same. There were a few modern pop culture references. Kids dressed up as their favourite cartoon characters and superheroes and whatever else was popular to them. Adults varied in that some donned scarier outfits and makeup to appear as ghosts and ghouls and zombies. Some, mainly the younger crowd, were dressed in a more attractive fashion. Then, of course, there were a handful of people that didn’t bother with more than their everyday clothes.

I shouldered my way through the crowd, trying to ask about the boy, but I was consistently ignored. I imagine many mistook my uniform for a costume, and considering my age, they wanted nothing to do with me. I was just a middle-aged man with a tired face and sad eyes. Unruly hair partnered with faint stubble that was in an awkward phase between beard and clean-shaven. My only advances had been blind dates organized by mutual friends. But I didn’t have many acquaintances outside of work.

However, after enough searching, I was able to speak with a few of the locals. With the provided information, some had possible answers, but Thomas was a common name. Not to mention, many of the locals willing to speak with me were already inebriated and struggled to comprehend what I was asking. The music blaring through overhead speakers scattered about main street wasn't making my job any easier either.

There was nothing I could do about the festival, as much as I wanted to. I couldn't just make demands to shut it down or halt its progress. Sanguis wasn't within my county, and therefore, I had little say. I should've called someone to aid me, someone working within their jurisdiction, but I was impatient. Eager for answers.

Eventually, someone dressed as a sad-faced clown pointed to a nearby diner and told me I should speak with the mayor. I thanked them and went on my way.

Inside, the diner was packed from wall-to-wall. Every booth was filled, every stool taken, every inch of counter space occupied by food and drinks. The distinct scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, intermingled with the smell of cooked bacon grease and oil from an air fryer.

""Sorry, hun."" A hostess in a black apron had snuck up on me, appearing from a small cluster of girls dressed as vampires. ""There aren't any tables right now. Wait time will be about ten to twenty minutes. Maybe longer.""

I leaned in and asked: ""Is the mayor here?""

The woman looked me up and down, studying my face. ""Oh, you're not from around here.""

""That obvious, huh?""

""I've got an ear for accents and a memory for faces. 'Specially one as handsome as yours.""

She was lying in hopes of getting a tip.

""You wouldn't happen to know of a little boy named Thomas, would you?” I asked. “Younger, between eight and ten. Brown hair. Blue eyes.""

""Might be Tommy Milner. His daddy has a farm up the road.""

""Sweet corn?""

Her lips twisted with amusement. ""Sheep and pigs mostly.""

""Right,"" I said. ""Now, about the mayor...""

She turned and pointed to a booth at the back of the restaurant. A man in a suit sat alone. Darker skin, curly black hair cut short, quiet but seemingly amicable as he politely nodded or waved at a few other patrons passing by on their way for the side exit.

""Thanks a bunch."" I left the hostess and maneuvered the crowd until I stood before the mayor's table. ""Got a moment?""

He looked up from his half-eaten meal. His eyebrows knitted together with consternation. ""Do we know each other, friend?""

I extended my hand. ""Raymond Solanis; deputy sheriff from Halleran County.""

A charming smile lifted the mayor's lips, revealing a set of pearly-white teeth. A politician's grin. Warm, attractive, but not so defined as to appear creepy or intense. Small lines around the corners of his mouth said he must've donned it often.

""Mayor Michael Briggs."" He grasped my hand firmly and shook it. ""Pleasure to make your acquaintance. Please, have a seat. Are you hungry? Best bacon this side of the river.""

Best bacon and sweet corn, I thought. What can't you people do?

""No,"" I said, ""but thank you.""

He nodded and lifted a cup of coffee to his mouth. ""I like your costume.""

""You do realize I'm actually a deputy sheriff, right?""

""And I'm dressed up as the very handsome mayor of Sanguis.""

""Doesn’t really seem like a costume to me.""

""Of course it is."" The mayor grinned. ""You and I are nothing more than men. This, the clothes we wear and the business we conduct, are roles in a play. The world is a stage, my friend, and we are simply trying to give our best performance before the curtain inevitably falls.""

I had to wonder if it wasn't just coffee in the mayor's cup.

""The reason I'm here,"" I explained, ""is about a boy my partner and I found on the highway. Might be a local from your town. Tommy Milner?""

""Ah, Tommy. Kind young man. Hard worker. You say you found him on the highway?""

I quickly recalled the day's earlier events. How the boy came running out of the woods barefoot and afraid. As if he were being chased.

""I see."" The mayor rubbed his hand along the length of his jaw. ""Is he okay?""

""He's being treated at a hospital about half an hour from here. I was hoping to get in contact with the parents, verify the boy’s identity.""

""You and your partner?""

""Just me."" I don't know why, but then I said: ""Partner's on standby at the hospital. Waiting for any updates.""

The mayor took another sip of his coffee as he considered this. There was a hint of distress in his eyes as if he were trying to solve a puzzle without all the pieces. Bemused by the news given to him.

""Well, Deputy, I can't say I've heard from the Milners. Then again, it has been a busy day with the festival. Why don't we take a ride up to the farm and check in on them?""

""I would appreciate that, Mayor.""

He collected his coat from the booth and rose to his feet. I followed closely behind him. As we neared the main entrance, he stopped and whistled.

Somehow, through the bustle of the diner, a woman at the far end of the counter perked up and met the mayor's gaze. She stood from her stool, threw down a twenty dollar bill on the counter, and joined us outside.

It was then I got a better look at the woman. Lithe frame and hard jaw. Steely eyes with an indifferent expression. She wore a black police button-up beneath a Kevlar vest.

""Deputy Solanis, meet Officer Katherine Barsad,"" the mayor introduced. “She’s our local law enforcement.”

""Kat,"" she said curtly.

I tried to shake her hand, but the mayor was already on the move, and she was quick to keep up with him.

We all piled into Officer Barsad's cruiser and drove deeper into town, past the buildings and streets onto a muddy road that led us to the countryside. The trees returned but swiftly gave way to endless fields of corn.

""You know, Deputy,"" said Mayor Briggs, ""it seems strange for you to be all the way out here.""

""Lucky that I was, otherwise young Tommy might still be walking the highway.""

The mayor glanced over at me in the passenger seat, still awaiting some sort of explanation.

""I was going around handing out flyers for a missing girl, Alys,” I said. “Trying to raise awareness; see if I couldn’t shake something loose.”

""Correct me if I'm wrong, but they have Amber Alerts and news channels for that, don't they?""

""Smaller communities aren't alway fully connected to the network. And I've got me something of a restless mind. Need to keep busy.""

""Workaholic or guilty conscience?""

Instinctually, I tensed at the question. In the backseat, Officer Barsad shifted her body to face me. It was then I realized just how cramped the car was, and how strange it'd been for the officer to relinquish the driver's seat to the mayor. Then again, he was technically her boss. But in my experience, whenever I was with the sheriff, he always rode shotgun.

""You know why they call this town Sanguis?"" the mayor asked. ""Back in the late 1800s, around the civil war, there was a battle here. You see for a time, Missouri was considered a border state. You know what a border state is?""

""When the state's loyalty was divided between the Confederacy and the Union. Neither fully one or the other.""

""Very good, Deputy."" He raised his eyes to look at Officer Barsad in the rearview mirror. ""We've got a learned man in our midst.""

We turned off the road and started up a long winding lane towards a plain farmhouse with a sloped roof. The yard light was off, and the inside of the house was dark.

""The battle was as bloody as they get,"" Mayor Briggs continued. ""Brothers against brothers, fathers against sons. In fact, there’d been so much bloodshed, it soaked into the dirt and turned the waterways red for a time. It almost caused the town to collapse completely, but where there's a will there's a way.""

""And that connects to Sanguis how?""

We came to a stop in the empty driveway. The mayor turned towards me, the leather of his seat squeaked with his movements. ""Sanguis is the Latin word for blood. Not our proudest moment but perhaps our most defining.""

Slowly, under the cover of the shadows, I slid my right hand across my body, resting it on my revolver. ""Is that so?""

There was a hint of disappointment in the mayor’s smile. ""Unfortunately."" Then, he unbuckled his seatbelt and exited the car. ""Are you coming?""

I opened my door and stepped out, Officer Barsad lingered a few paces behind us. A spectator in this investigation. Easy to forget if you weren’t careful.

We followed the cobblestone path to the porch and knocked on the front door. There was no response, so we knocked again. The mayor called out to the Milners, alerting them of his presence. Still, nothing.

""What do you think, Deputy?"" the mayor asked. ""Should we get a warrant? I imagine it might be difficult for you considering county lines.""

I looked back at Officer Barsad. ""Suppose I should let you take the lead.""

She remained still, her eyes going to Briggs for instruction. He nodded lightly, and she stepped forward, trying the handle. The door swung open to darkness and the smell of honey ham.

I removed a flashlight from my belt. Officer Barsad did the same. We entered the house, our beams of light crawling across the floorboards and walls. I kept my right arm rested on the grip of my revolver, ready to draw at a moment's notice.

In the hallway, I found a picture hanging on the wall. It was a family photo of the Milners. Mother, father, and son. The boy was the very same I'd encountered on the highway.

Suddenly, the overhead lights came on. Mayor Briggs stood with his finger still on the switch, grinning at me with a sense of pity.

""Keep your eyes on the sky,"" he said, ""and you'll trip over the roots beneath your feet.""

We turned off our flashlights and wandered the house, calling out to the Milners. There was no sign of life, no sign of a disturbance either. The house sat empty and still, untouched. Then, as I returned from the hallway, I stopped in the dining room. The dinner table was set with three plates, the food on each plate partially eaten. Something had interrupted their supper and forced them to abandon their home halfway through a meal. No time to clean up, no time to pack, no time to do anything but leave. Where had they gone? What made them leave so suddenly?

1i0yj5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_IllPause4880/comments/1i0yj5u/ai_marketing_decisions_leading_to_success_or/,AI Marketing Decisions Leading to Success or Sabotage,"**“Am I making the right choices with AI in my strategies? Am I sacrificing my creative vision for AI efficiency?”**🤔

This question is likely echoing in the minds of marketers everywhere. We're in a brave new world where AI tools promise efficiency and speed, but also threaten to homogenize our brand voices. Let’s dive in and explore how to make sure we’re leading with *intention* and not just blindly following the hype.

# The Great AI Balancing Act: Finding Your Brand’s Authentic Voice

AI is like that new, shiny gadget we all love to play with. It can generate ad copy, predict customer behavior, and create SEO-friendly content in a flash. But here's the kicker: are we losing our brand’s soul in the process? The struggle is real.

We want to leverage the efficiency of AI, but we don't want to sound like every other brand out there. Authenticity is what makes us unique, what makes our customers connect with us on a human level. When your content lacks personality, your audience is likely to disengage. It's about finding the balance, making AI a partner, not a replacement.

**Solution:**



**Audit Your Content Regularly:** Set aside time to review *all* of your content, even the stuff the AI helped with. Does it align with your brand values? Does it *sound* like you? Regular audits can help you catch any discrepancies before they become a big problem.

•

**Use AI for Idea Generation, Not Final Drafts:** Think of AI as the idea spark plug, not the entire engine. Use it to brainstorm concepts or create outlines, but always ensure the final output has your human touch. It is much easier to edit and add your own personality, and you maintain control of the narrative.

•

**Layer in a Human Touch:** Always tweak the content the AI generates to truly reflect your brand's personality. Add those personal anecdotes, that particular brand of humor, or your unique phrasing that connects with your audience. This is the secret sauce to making content feel genuine and relatable.



# The Double-Edged Sword of AI in Marketing ⚔️

AI is a *powerful tool*, but like any tool, it can be used for good or evil. In the marketing world, the ‘good’ is the amazing efficiency and ability to generate content at scale, the ‘evil’ is the risk of producing generic, personality-less material. Are your *marketing strategies* amplifying your unique ideas, or are you simply letting the AI take over? The answer is in how you are integrating the tools within your brand.

**Solution:**



**Stay Intentional:** Before implementing any AI tool, ask yourself: Does this align with my vision? Am I using AI to enhance my story or replace it? Being intentional will guide your decisions and keep your brand authentic.

•

**Embrace AI as a Collaborator:** Think of AI as your supportive sidekick in your marketing efforts. Use it for the repetitive tasks like keyword research or data analysis, but keep the creative decision-making firmly in your human hands. Don't let the robots take over the creative process. 😉

•

**Regularly Review Your AI Tools**: Not all AI tools are the same. Regularly assess the ones you use. Are they genuinely enhancing your vision, or are they just churning out content for the sake of it?. It's crucial to evaluate if your tools are truly working for your benefit, or if they are actively hindering your creativity.



# Quality over Quantity: The Smart Marketer's Mantra 🧠

In the age of AI, it’s tempting to churn out content like a machine. But quantity will never beat quality**...**. Instead of publishing ten AI-generated blogs a month, focus on two or three that blend technology and creativity seamlessly. It’s better to serve a few exquisite dishes than a buffet of mediocre options. Your audience will appreciate the thought and effort put into your work.

**Solution:**



**Identify Key Topics That Resonate With Your Audience**: Use AI to analyze trends and gather insights, but ensure the final content is tailored to your audience’s interests and needs.

•

**Use AI to Generate Outlines or Bullet Points:** Leverage AI to get the ball rolling, but don’t rely on it for the final product.

•

**Write the Final Content Yourself, Ensuring it Reflects Your Brand’s Voice:** After generating content with AI, take time to edit and refine it. Add your personality, your anecdotes, your humor – this will make your content feel authentic and engaging.



# Staying True to Your Voice in a Noisy World 📢

Your brand voice is the unique personality and emotion infused into all your communications. It reflects your values, your mission, and the connection you have with your audience. In the rise of *AI-generated content*, it’s crucial to ensure that your brand voice remains consistent and authentic. Think of your brand voice as a character in a story - it needs to be relatable, engaging, and true to your brand’s identity. Don’t let the robots steal the show!

**Solution:**



**Define Your Brand Personality**: Start by identifying the key traits that define your brand. Are you playful, serious, innovative, or traditional? Make a list of words that describe your brand’s personality and use this as a foundation for your voice.

•

**Know Your Audience**: Understanding your audience is crucial to crafting a voice that resonates with them. Conduct surveys, gather feedback, and analyze engagement to learn what your audience values and how they communicate.

•

**Create a Brand Voice Guide:** Develop a comprehensive guide that outlines your brand voice, including tone, language, and style. This should be a reference for anyone creating content for your brand, ensuring consistency across all platforms.



# The Case of the Boutique Coffee Brand ☕

Let’s talk about our friend, the boutique coffee brand. Initially, they relied too much on AI for their social media captions. Engagement went up, but customers started to feel like their posts lacked the brand's usual charm. They realized the error and shifted strategies to using AI for initial drafts, then they put in their unique, quirky personality, and engagement skyrocketed again! Customers specifically praised the brand’s authentic voice. The takeaway here? Always infuse your personality into AI-generated content.



**Key Takeaways**



**Authenticity is key:** People can spot inauthenticity from a mile away, and if your AI-generated emails or ads feel hollow, they won't stick around**.**

•

**Quality beats quantity:** It's better to create fewer pieces of high-quality content that resonate with your audience than a lot of mediocre pieces**.**

•

**AI is a tool, not a replacement:** Think of AI as a partner in your marketing efforts. Use it for repetitive tasks, but keep the creative decision-making in your hands**.**



# Conclusion

AI is undeniably powerful, and its role in marketing will only continue to grow**.** The question isn’t *if* you should use AI, but *how* you should use it**.** By maintaining a balance between AI efficiency and creative authenticity, you can craft marketing strategies that truly resonate with your audience**.**

Remember, your creative vision is what sets you apart. It’s the soul of your brand and the connection your audience feels on a human level. By using AI as a tool to *enhance*, rather than *replace*, your creativity, you can achieve the best of both worlds: *marketing strategies* that are efficient and unmistakably you.

Now go out there and create content that not only drives results but also resonates with your audience on a deeper level!

*Success doesn’t happen overnight, but every piece of content you create and every email you send builds your* foundation. Remember, **consistency is key**, **and** **content is** **king!**

You probably want to start building your digital empire.

The tools are here, and the path is clear—*it’s time to take the first step.*

This one will focus purely on the changes to towns and areas similar to them.)

I have counted the items that Loomian Legacy has added so far, and I would consider 22 of them pvp related, excluding soulbursts for the moment. This means that they will have to be evenly distributed among the towns and routes that currently exist. This will leave the caveat however that you will like receive less items later into the game (frostveil+) unless more are added. This SHOULD mean that before you fight Vanta you already basically have a competitively ready team for the rest of the game. 

Mitis Town

There are two main important items you will find here, the powerinf (rare candy infinite copy, will level your loomians up to the maximum level cap), and the chocolate bar.

The chocolate bar will be given by a kid in one of the neighboring houses to your own. He’ll say something like, “Chocolate is so good isn’t it? My mom gave me a bunch for my birthday today! Here, have one!” You’re probably wondering why the chocolate bar would be given early of all things and that’s for one main reason, high energy moves. 

Many of the battles kaizo runs use in the early game often have high powered moves, usually to compensate for the low stats of the prevolved pokemon. I would also like to do something similar, some moves will be obtained early, and those moves will cost a lot of energy.

Cynamoth for example, gets jet steam on evolution, which would only be able to be used twice at its evo level of 18. The chocolate bar will not only help with this, but also would allow for opponent trainers to spam moves that may be difficult to deal with. 

Another example, Naya, the first gym, will likely carry an anomaly, chocolate bar, Draco beam, Kyogo. This will allow her to use three beams instead of just two before needing to waste a turn for energy.

The chocolate bar will be one of the most important items of the early game, so use it wisely.

(Ok this is taking a little longer than expected so I’m gonna sorta speed through this next bit)

Cheshma Town

Kabunga coffee, boosted to guarantee energy gain after every turn. Maybe an eighth specifically, idk I haven’t calced it yet.

Silvent City

Last item you get before gym leader, likely drop of youth for another loomipedia check. I’d say around 30-40 at this point. Maybe lower depending on nuzlockes.

Kanoko Village

Story deals with stuff that burns, so why not throw in mysterious dust? Also good defensively, maybe I’d buff it to a 50% similar to shed skin in Pokemon, but honestly I’d think it’s fine in its current state.

Heiwa Village

Fishing Rod, gives a better chance against the gym, and will allow for a guaranteed water type in places (Mitis, route 2, there’s probably more I just haven’t checked lol). You may think this may be a bit too kind, however Akio will likely surprise you with his coverage. Given by a fisherman near small pond.

Sepharite City

Since that the items in the routes (including junkyard) beforehand would likely make up for only one city area item, this would be the only one. I was debating putting something in the campus, but I argued against it. The item would be specialty boots, it would be given as a replacement for the protein shake. (Note: all ralley items would be given on unlock to ranch)

Route 8 (Resort)

Im splitting the resort and route into separate item drops. The ace trainer will still give you an item, however there will also be one at the resort. Item will be the pearl unlocks, which I may place earlier purely due to the damage that some of these npcs will dish out early games. Rework to activate on contact of any move of its type that does damage, instead of a super effective. I could see this being very useful against unexpected sweepers, which is why I places them so far in.

Atlanthian City

Gloves and Goggles, both placed in Entertainment and Living districts respectively. The living district will act like a typical route, with an ace trainer giving the item. Gloves will be given after a mission, relating to elephage, after defeating it once in the arcade. (Note: arcade will likely just be limited to tms, but the tickets necessary will be lowered and more will be added.)

Conclusion

I will create a more comprehensive list when I decide the placement of the route items. I want to see what yall think on some of the placements I made, so I can make adjustments. Thank you for reading! Next one will likely be either route items or route loomians, just depends on what I find more easy to make.

Exploring NYC Corporate Law Roles,"Hi everyone, I'm a current LL.M. student at a T-14 law school and I'm interested in applying to BigLaw firms in NYC and I'd ideally like to start in Fall '25 after I'm done with the J25 bar. I'm an experienced lawyer and spent about 6-ish years in my home country working in the corporate practice (M&A and PE/VC) and in the energy/infrastructure practice (mostly renewables-focused) of large law firms that have occassionally collaborated with US-based law firms on cross-border deals. 

Since LL.Ms don't really have a dedicated recruitment 'funnel' in the same way as JDs do, I'm mindful that our chances at landing a job here are largely dependent on networking and persistence. That said, I'd like to request all of you kind people for specific and actionable tips and advice as I navigate this tricky minefield. 

Some of the things that I'm curious about are:
1. Given the current state of the market, the economy and the political climate, what practice area should I focus on in terms of directing my networking efforts? Alternatively, should I be practice area-agnostic?
2. When I'm networking with people, I'd generally like to sound more informed and intelligent when I'm speaking about the U.S. legal system - how do you think I can work on this?
3. Any tips for cold emailing etiquette?
4. What do you folks think about appending writing samples to coffee chat request emails? Is that something that can help make my request more compelling?

1i0y5as,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/1i0y5as/just_a_vent_about_really_unhinged_houseguest/,Just a vent about really unhinged houseguest behavior ,"My father in law met a woman some years back who is clearly a scammer. I can’t get into it too much here because I’d dox myself but she has a black widow background and at the time she and my father in law met, was living off the estate of an ex lover who had dementia and who she had put in an extremely cheap, unlicensed home. She was living in the lover’s home and using the lover’s items when she started dating my father in law. There were warnings early on: within months of meeting, she made him announce that he’d changed his will to make her the sole beneficiary, they married very suddenly on a weekday while our kids were still in school, etc. She’s also always been horrible to me: she fat shames me, wore white to our wedding, constantly insults me and puts me down and is nasty to my stepdaughter (less so to my stepson). She’s horrible to servers and routinely threatens them, speaks badly to all of us, and the list goes on. my father in law says nothing to curb her behavior, and my husband knows he will lose his father entirely if he says anything. She has blocked us on Facebook (she uses 5 accounts) as well as from my father in law’s Facebook, uses his phone to reply to our texts to him, and behaves worse than anyone I’ve ever met (including my mom with BPD). By the way, I don’t think this woman has BPD: her behavior is truly sociopathic and lacking the charm of my mom’s BPD when my mom is having a good day. This woman even uses her large social media following to make videos attacking family members (she had a video go viral and now calls herself an influencer — she’s 70!) and makes so called Karen videos where she baits people into responding to her insults and then films their “Karen” responses for engagement. We’ve had to ask her to take down videos that specifically targeted family members and our friends businesses. 

… but that isn’t the most egregious part. During her previous visits, we’ve had things go missing (including my wallet) and caught her red handed rifling through our desks. We put locks on our bedroom and office doors and make sure all of our valuables are safe when she visits. On her last visit we caught her trying to pick a lock to our bar where we keep our whiskey collection and then she admitted she was drinking our hard-to-find bourbons with ginger ale “just to piss us off”. After that visit and a lot of bad behavior during it, my husband and I agreed that she would no longer be welcome in our home. 

Unfortunately my father in law recently had a milestone birthday and guilted my husband into flying him and his nightmare wife out. My husband convinced me that we had to let them stay because the optics weren’t great otherwise (we live in a large  home with multiple guest bedrooms). We spent $3000 on first class tickets for them and the visit was overall tolerable, some nasty behavior from her directed towards me but I thought we got through it. Interestingly, the nasty behavior was often revolving around food — demands for very specific things (a specific type of coffee creamer for example) and then screaming at me that it was the wrong kind (it wasn’t) and a lot of weird food stuff when we cooked, ie that she would only eat plain lettuce and not the 3 kinds of salad I had bought for her at her request. She probably weighs about 250-300 lbs but clearly has disordered eating and spent a lot of time yelling at me for not having “slim fast” on hand etc. 

Imagine my surprise to see the day they left, we had a stack of chocolate and candy boxes we had been given over the holidays. All beautifully packaged and tied up with bows or in gift bags, which I had hoped to regift to people who I know appreciate sweets more than I do. She tore through every single box and left half eaten pieces of candy in every single one. My husband convinced me to let it go because while it’s gross, the chocolates were out.

Tonight, I opened my secret cabinet that I keep for hosting / dinner parties etc  to find that she opened every. Single. Box of candy and sweets. But not the reeces or the opened bags of Ghirardelli squares. No, she only opened things that looked valuable or were gift wrapped. Truffles from my husband’s small midwestern hometown that were wrapped in beautiful wrapping paper. Chocolate bars a friend brought me back from Paris as a gift. Japanese Kit Kats that another friend sent me. Each one torn open roughly and each one left with a half eaten piece. Over a dozen boxes, all with her calling card left for us. 

I feel so incredibly unsettled and violated. It’s one thing to get into one or even two boxes of wrapped chocolate, it’s quite another to root through cabinets and open every single possible box, especially when she has a history of theft and snooping in our home.

I don’t know what this woman has. I don’t think it’s BPD because my PWBPD has a lot of really charming, good qualities and is obsessed with how she is perceived by others. I don’t know if this woman is a sociopath (she does have a criminal record) and I just want to scrub my whole house down and cry right now. 

I didn’t know where else to put this, so apologies for the not strictly on topic venting. You are my people and I’ve felt so supported talking about my mom’s BPD here and I am genuinely bewildered right now. 

Edit/update: one way I manage my emotions is by intellectualizing things in such a way that I can become clinical and removed from a weird situation. To that end I’ve done some reading tonight on ASPD which is another cluster b and it seems to fit. I swear to god I seem to attract cluster b types. ",1,1736829315.0,raisedbyborderlines,2,1.0,False
1i0y4cj,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowthCentsRealEstate/comments/1i0y4cj/7_steps_to_create_an_effective_lead_followup/,7 Steps to Create an Effective Lead Follow-Up System,"Hey there! So, let's dive into creating an effective lead follow-up system in real estate. Here’s a breakdown of things you’d wanna focus on:

1. **Capture Leads** First things first, you gotta capture those leads! You can use opt-in forms on your website or landing pages. Throw in some incentives like free reports or exclusive insights. It’s like offering a freebie to get their contact info. Make sure you're compliant with regulations like TCPA, so you don’t run into legal troubles. Oh, and integrating these forms with your CRM can save you a ton of time by automatically logging new leads!
2. **Define Your Goals** You need to know what you want from your follow-up system. Is it more sales, better retention, or increased traffic? It’s like planning a trip—you need to know where you're going to avoid unnecessary detours. Regularly check back on these goals to make sure they still align with your business direction.
3. **Prioritize Leads** Not all leads are created equal, right? You gotta prioritize them based on factors like budget, decision-making authority, and urgency. Using your CRM to score these leads helps you focus on the hottest prospects. Imagine picking the ripest apples from a basket—that's what you're doing here.
4. **Create a Consistent Follow-Up Process** Consistency is key! Develop a framework with timelines and communication templates. Automation tools can help you manage routine tasks, so no lead falls through the cracks. It’s like having a schedule for your workday—it keeps things organized and professional.
5. **Align Sales and Marketing Efforts** Make sure sales and marketing are on the same page by setting clear Service Level Agreements (SLAs). It's like a team huddle before a game—everyone needs to know their role for smooth handoffs and consistent messaging. Regular meetings between teams can help address any hiccups quickly.
6. **Utilize CRM** Your CRM isn’t just a database; it’s a powerhouse for tracking interactions and automating follow-ups. Use it to monitor lead activity and tailor communication strategies. It’s like having a personal assistant that keeps everything organized and timely.
7. **Personalize Communication** Nobody likes generic messages, right? Tailor your approach by addressing leads' specific needs. Use info from previous interactions to create meaningful connections. It’s like remembering someone's favorite coffee order—it shows you care and builds trust.

There ya go! Hope this helps you streamline your lead follow-up process in the real estate game.

I have a dear friend who will visiting towards the end of the month after several apart. Our mutual love of cheese was the icebreaker between us wallflower weirdos. I tend to struggle with traditional drink pairings. Particularly wines. For reasons that make sense no place except for in my own head I just can't bring myself to explore and learn about wine for myself, though I do enjoy it. And my friend is a fiend (in moderation) for wine. I would like to really make them feel cared for. If not with knowledge of my own, at the very least with effort and intent. I am also interested in ports. I have always liked them but never knew where to buy them, I learned today that the liquor store is the move in my state.

One of our things is we make a feast of Hors d'oeuvres over coffee in the morning, put on a movie marathon, and fully potato while talking through every movie for the entire day and evening. For the feast, we gift each other the five better cheeses we come across while apart which are in line with each-other's general palate. Also all of the local or homemade goodies we can make or scrounge up. I tend to do more of the homemade stuff while they love exploring their local artisans. It is a fun way to get each-other tasting things that we both enjoy and would typically not be drawn towards independently. We do a very indulgent tasting together and then the traveler gets theirs shipped. I don't know what my friend will be bringing of course. They tend to like sharp, sour, or creamy/indulgent cheeses. I tend to like more rustic, sheepy, or funky cheeses.

I will be gifting

\- 

Hi, it feels weird making this post, but here's hoping it goes well!

I'm a 23 year old guy in New Zealand, and I'm looking for a relationship. Despite that, even just having a chat is all good so my expectations are realistic I guess haha.



About me:

\- I'm a creative person. Right now that means playing & making music, as well as writing.

\- For my music, at the moment I'm just playing guitar & singing, though I'd like to pick up the piano again :)

\- I work from home with a family business. I make enough to live comfortably, though not extravagantly (yet?)

\- Because of my job, I can travel & move quite freely. I'm open to eventually relocating/moving out of NZ

\- I work out a lot, and I really like it

\- I'm about 5'8, slim-average build (working on putting some muscle on though), buzzed hair & stubble. Green eyes and tanned (but white) skin

\- I have multiple tattoos (just counted, there's 9). They all have meaning and make me happy daily

\- I'm big on travel. As much as funds allow, of course. Hopefully that's something I could do with my partner

\- In addition to travel, I love exploring new places. Whether it's urban or natural, it's also something I'd love to do with my partner!

\- I like reading, a lot. I read on average a book a week. I've just got a John Muir book out from the library and I'm stoked on that!

\- I like a mix of ambient & heavy music. Lots of old punk bands and drone artists in my playlists haha

\- I'm very liberal

\- I don't smoke, drink, or do any drugs (except coffee)

\- I don't have kids, and I don't want them

\- I'm happy sharing photos pretty quick, though I know it can be a point of anxiety for some so there's no pressure or rush in that regard!



About you:

\- I don't mind your gender or any of that. Just let me know your pronouns if that's important for you :)

\- please be hygienic. Regular showers and clean clothes are important! Not being disheveled and having a skincare routine is a massive plus

\- please don't be an addict

\- I don't have any physical preferences, though making sure you look after yourself is a plus!

\- I don't mind where you live. Though being open to & able to travel is a big bonus (obviously)

\- please don't be conservative/right-wing

\- preferably be between the ages of 20 and 39, though anyone 18 or over is welcome to message me



That's about all I have to mention. If there's any details you're curious about don't hesitate to ask, I'm here for communication after all. If you found yourself nodding along to any number of these bullet points feel free to shoot me a message and we can go from there :)",2,1736828271.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False
1i0xt7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1i0xt7u/would_it_be_wrong_of_me_if_i_quit_2_months_into/,Would it be wrong of me if I quit 2 months into my new job?,"So basically what the title says lol

A bit of backstory. I’ve been working at a coffee chain for about 2 years now. I was a barista for 10 months & then promoted to supervisor, but will be demoting in the following 2 weeks officially. I wanted to try out being a supervisor because of the experience & to achieve a personal goal of mine, but quite frankly it fucked with my mental health pretty badly. I went from loving the job to hating it. 

About a month ago one of my mom’s friends reached out to her & brought up a work opportunity she had within her job. We called & she explained it & I was interested in learning more about it. Long story short, what I thought would just be a meeting was scheduled for the following week with her bosses. It turned out to be an interview. We talked and they hired me.

It’s a small non profit organization.

A couple of red flags that I stupidly ignored :) 

1. When I asked for compensation information they could never give me a clear answer. The owner asked me what I wanted to get compensated & wouldn’t give me an actual number. 

2. A week into my training I found out that I only am getting paid based on the numbers I hit, not the hours I put into it all together. 

3. I agreed to an availability & I keep getting contacted outside of it. For example, my first week in the office I got called by one of my supervisors (my moms friend) right as I was leaving the office & I stayed in the office an extra half hour. 

4. The branch that I’m a part of, I’m basically on my own. They have different offices in different counties and I’m the only one in the one from my county. They hired a new person for that office I’m in & I was told they are going to want me in charge of it. I’ve only finished my training 2 weeks ago.

5. The supervisors can’t handle their own workload.

6. My mom’s friend, who is a supervisor btw, said that the bosses ask her way too often to stay extra late & that the pay never matches up. Again, we don’t get paid hourly, only based on the numbers we hit.

7. I started training early December. It’s mid-January & I haven’t gotten a single paycheck. The pay schedule hasn’t even been cleared up despite the amount of times I have asked. Apparently it’s once a month, which won’t be sustainable for me.

8. The owners of the non profit were under the impression I was going to quit my other job to be full time with them even tho the pay is basically part time. 

9. I earn more at my other job than this one. Even as a barista.

10. As I was in the middle of writing this, I found out that I’m apparently handling the social media aspect of the organization on a suite platform I have no clue how to use. I was just sent the emails with access to it & was expected to just do it. I asked what I was supposed to do & let them know I’ve never used that platform before, so I was confused, & I wasn’t messaged back. It’s been 5 hours & they wanted me to do that work by tonight….for events happening this week (1 in two days & the other by the end of the week). 

11. I have a meeting with a collaborator tomorrow in the morning over zoom and out of the 3 in charge neither of them confirmed who was going to present with me….because I’m new…and not very knowledgeable in what exactly the organization wants to promote :) 

These are a few of the things I can think of as of writing this post. I am really really considering just quitting, but what’s been holding me back is the fact that my mom’s friend referred me and got me in, so I am conflicted. 

Ultimately what I want to do career wise isn’t in the nonprofit sector, nor does it involve anything admin. I was just complaining a lot about my previous job and was searching for a new one, but once stepping down I have realized that I am starting to enjoy that one a lot more & this new one is seeming like a burden every time I have to work it. I’m currently working both of the jobs due to my uncertainty with the new one since the beginning. I’m done with training (which also isn’t paid btw but I am going to be given a stipend for it…the amount of which I still don’t know of) & have technically been on my own for 2 weeks now. In those 2 weeks alone I have come across red flags 3-11 :)

So would it be wrong of me to put my 2 weeks notice in already or should I wait it out??

What to do!?,"Portland (or just outside of it) is one of the places I'm looking at moving to in the next year or so, and I'd like to spend a week getting to know your city! I'll be visiting in April, and I'd love some suggestions from the people who live there! Where should I go? What should I do? How do I get a real feel for Portland in a week?

I'm a big foodie, tea junkie, and coffee fan. In addition to that, I love local shops - especially witchcraft/spirituality/metaphysics places, oddities shops, bookstores, stuff like that. If the weather is nice, I'd absolutely adore some park and nature trail suggestions.

Additionally, I'd also love to get a feel for the nightlife, especially the queer nightlife. Any good hangouts for trans women and lesbians would be super appreciated!

Thank you all so much!",0,1736828130.0,askportland,2,0.25,False
1i0xs0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/1i0xs0v/room_for_sublease_in_sunnyside_queens_1650_or/,"Room for Sublease in Sunnyside, Queens ($1,650) or Entire 3BR Unit Takeover Option Available!","Hi everyone, my roommate has relocated, so I currently have one room available for a long-term sublease. I’m also open to discussing the option for someone to take over the entire unit if that’s a better fit for their needs.

**Option 1**: Sublease one bedroom.

* **Location**: Sunnyside, Queens, NY 11104. A 5-minute walk to many grocery stores and a 10-minute walk to an Asian market. There are plenty of great and affordable local restaurants, bubble tea shops, and coffee shops nearby. CVS and a gym are a 10-minute walk from the house.
* **Price**: $1,650/month + utilities, which are around $80-100/month per person for electricity and Wi-Fi (no water or heat charges).
* **Subway**: A 10-minute walk to the 7 train at 40th St - Lowery St station, with a 15-minute ride to Manhattan. Bus routes Q39 and B24 are right at the corner.
* **Roommate**: I’m a software engineer with a hybrid schedule (in the office two days a week). I’m somewhat introverted but happy to chat.
* **Room**: Our home is a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment, and this is one of the bedrooms. You’ll share the apartment with me but have your own private bathroom. The bedroom fits a queen bed, a desk, and a large wardrobe. It has a west-facing window overlooking the BQE and central AC. My roommate is open to leaving the room partly furnished upon request.
* **Apartment**: The unit has in-unit laundry (!), a dishwasher, a open access rooftop, and was recently renovated. It’s already equipped with utensils, cookware, and basic seasonings, so you won’t need to bring much when you move in. The building is pet-friendly and the super is very responsive.

**Option 2**: Take over the entire unit.  
For anyone interested, I’m open to transferring the lease for the **entire 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom unit**.

* **Price**: $4,080/month until **September 2025** and $4,150/month until **September 2026**. Utilities are additional (around $200/month total for electricity and Wi-Fi).
* **Lease Term**: The lease runs until the end of August 2026, and I’m flexible with the move-in date.
* **Apartment Features**: Same as above—recently renovated, in-unit laundry, dishwasher, rooftop access, and pet-friendly.

If you’re interested in either option or have any questions, feel free to reach out! I could also send you a link of the virtual tour video of the apartment if you're interested in taking over the entire lease!
