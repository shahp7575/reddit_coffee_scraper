1k3g5h6,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/1k3g5h6/hotel_reverie_was_pretty_bad/,Hotel Reverie was pretty bad,"I really did not like this episode I‚Äôm gonna be honest. One of the worst episodes of black mirror I‚Äôve seen.

1) I felt like there were too many coincidences, firstly with the fact that the flashdrive explaining the AI thing coincidentally fell out of the package that Brandy got in the mail. Then later on, the coffee cup ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù spilled on the computer powering the AI. Now, while you guys might think ‚Äú2 coincidences isn‚Äôt a lot‚Äù it definitely felt like a lot for black mirror cause‚Äô their episode plots are usually amazing and flow super well so I‚Äôm not sure what happened with this one.

2) I‚Äôm gonna be honest I really didn‚Äôt like the actress they chose to play Brandy, I don‚Äôt think she embodied the two roles at all. Basically as you know, in the episode the main actress is playing Brandy, and Brandy is playing Alex, so she‚Äôs basically playing two roles at once, and it didn‚Äôt feel like that at all. It felt like she was just playing Brandy the whole time and it genuinely bothers me because here‚Äôs the thing I understand that even for a seasoned actor it can be hard to switch between roles just like that, but in this specific case it was actually quite easy because all Brandy had to do was put on a transatlantic accent. I also feel like she could‚Äôve delivered certain lines in a way more romantic-sounding way. Like I felt like not only did she not put effort into showcasing Alex as a character by changing her accent, but she also didn‚Äôt deliver her lines in a romantic way so it was very confusing when Dorothy fell in love with her. Like you wouldn‚Äôt really get feelings for someone who has this confused/‚Äúwhat‚Äôs going on‚Äù kind of undertone to everything they say. Also there is a point in the episode where she has a bit of a breakdown and ends up going off on Dorothy by saying ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM NOT ALEX AND NONE OF THIS IS REAL‚Äù and I truly feel like this was a missed opportunity because had Brandy been portraying Alex with the accent/charm, then it would‚Äôve made her breakdown so much more powerful and we would‚Äôve gotten to actually see it in real time. But we didn‚Äôt. I will add, just to make this review not seem as negative, I felt like the the actress who played Brandy did a phenomenal job in that last scene where she was holding Dorothy in her arms as she was dying, like that was genuinely such a beautiful scene and she delivered there for sure. I also loved the actress who played Dorothy, she killed that role.

Feel free to let me know what you guys think about my critiques, but try to keep it respectful. If you saw the episode and really liked it then that‚Äôs fine. Me disliking it is not an attack on you, it‚Äôs just my opinion.",1,1745129696.0,blackmirror,0,1.0,False

Ever wake up feeling like your face has had its own version of a long night out? As we head into retirement, making sure we look and feel our best every day can be a game-changer. Let‚Äôs dive into some tried-and-true tips to wake up a tired face and start your day with a bang.

 Ever tried taking a cold shower in the morning? It‚Äôs like slapping your face‚Äîliterally. Cold showers stimulate circulation and give you that jolt you need to kickstart your day. Pair that with a warm (not hot) face wash to plump up your skin and erase those pesky sleep lines. But hey, if cold showers aren‚Äôt your thing, even just splashing your face with cold water can do the trick.

Next up, hydration is key. Apply moisturizer immediately after patting your face dry. For an extra boost, opt for hyaluronic acid-based creams. They‚Äôre like a big drink of water for your skin. And if you‚Äôve got the time, use a face mask or two during the week to really get that glow going.

Now, let‚Äôs talk eyes. Those tiny windows to our souls can often look like they‚Äôve seen better days after a rough night. Soothing eye drops can work wonders for redness. And if puffiness is your issue, caffeine-infused eye creams or chilled tea bags are your BFFs.

Makeup tricks can also work miracles. Swap out your heavy foundation for lightweight tints or tinted moisturizers. A dab of blush can give you that healthy flush we all envy. And if you‚Äôre wearing glasses, bold frames can be a game-changer in disguising fatigue. skip the dark eyeliner and opt for soft, shimmery neutrals.

And don‚Äôt forget about your wardrobe. Bright colors like white, light blue, or even red can reflect light and make you look fresher. Add a pair of sparkly earrings, and you‚Äôre good to go.

For those on-the-go mornings, there are quick fixes too. An ice cube rubbed over your face can revive circulation in a jiffy. Or throw on a bold lip color to distract from those tired eyes.

But let‚Äôs not forget about lifestyle boosters. Staying hydrated throughout the day, limiting salt and alcohol before bed, exercising regularly, and taking screen-time breaks can all help prevent fatigue. Trust me, retirement is the perfect time to formulate a bedtime routine.

I remember my own mom struggling with this as she got older. But with a few tweaks to her routine and some of these tips, she looked and felt years younger. It‚Äôs amazing how a little self-care can go a long way.

## What is Bitcord Verdis?

Bitcord Verdis is an **automated trading platform** that uses AI algorithms to analyze market trends and execute trades on behalf of users. Think of it as a smart assistant that buys and sells crypto (and other assets) for you based on real-time data. It claims to help both beginners and experienced traders make informed decisions without spending hours glued to charts.

The platform supports multiple types of assets, not just crypto. That‚Äôs a perk if you‚Äôre looking to diversify your portfolio without jumping between platforms. It also offers a **demo mode** so you can test strategies before committing real cash.

## Who Created Bitcord Verdis?

Now, here‚Äôs where things get a little fuzzy. The exact team behind Bitcord Verdis isn‚Äôt publicly listed, which is kinda common in this industry but still a bit of a red flag. From what I could gather, the platform is backed by a group of fintech professionals and developers with experience in algorithmic trading.

While it‚Äôs not as transparent as, say, Coinbase, it does appear to be working with **licensed brokers**, which adds a layer of credibility. Still, I‚Äôd love to see more info about the creators in the future to build more trust with users.

Bitcord Verdis runs on algorithms that scan the market and execute trades automatically. These bots analyze **real-time market signals, historical data, and volatility patterns** to decide when to enter or exit a trade.

You can customize your trading settings ‚Äî like how much you want to invest per trade, stop-loss limits, and which assets to focus on. The platform also supports manual trading if you‚Äôre feeling hands-on. It connects to partner brokers that handle the actual execution of trades, and those brokers are supposedly regulated, which is good news for compliance and safety.

Like any tool, Bitcord Verdis has its ups and downs. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

**Pros:**
- üîπ **Automated trading**: Saves a ton of time.

Bitcord Verdis is built for flexibility. You can access it on:

- **Desktop browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **Tablets**

There‚Äôs no dedicated app on the App Store or Google Play yet, but the mobile browser experience is smooth and responsive. I tested it on my iPhone, and it felt just like using a native app.

## Bitcord Verdis ‚Äì Supported Countries

Bitcord Verdis is available in most major countries, including:

- üá∫üá∏ United States
- üá¨üáß United Kingdom
- üá®üá¶ Canada
- üá¶üá∫ Australia

## Bitcord Verdis ‚Äì Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The platform‚Äôs AI scans thousands of data points and indicators in real-time. This means trades are executed based on up-to-the-minute data, which increases the odds of catching profitable trends. You don‚Äôt have to do any technical analysis yourself ‚Äî it‚Äôs all automated.

### User-Friendly Interface

Seriously, it‚Äôs clean. No clutter, no confusing buttons. Everything is labeled clearly, and the dashboard gives you a snapshot of your performance, trades, and account balance. Ideal for beginners who are easily overwhelmed by overly technical platforms.

### Mobile Accessibility

Even though there‚Äôs no app (yet), Bitcord Verdis works great on mobile browsers. The interface adapts beautifully to smaller screens, so you can trade on the go ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre in line for coffee or doom-scrolling Twitter.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up specific alerts for price changes, trade executions, and market trends. These come through email or SMS (depending on your setup). It‚Äôs a nice touch for those who want to stay informed without checking the platform every 10 minutes.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Besides crypto, you can also trade:
- **Forex**
- **Stocks**
- **Commodities**

It‚Äôs basically a one-stop-shop for traders who want exposure to different markets without managing multiple accounts across platforms.

## Is Bitcord Verdis a Scam?

Based on my experience and research, **Bitcord Verdis does not appear to be a scam**. It‚Äôs partnered with regulated brokers, offers a free demo account, and doesn‚Äôt make ridiculous promises (like ‚Äúguaranteed daily returns‚Äù).

That said, always be cautious. No trading bot is perfect, and there‚Äôs always risk involved. If anyone tells you it‚Äôs a ‚Äúget rich quick‚Äù tool, they‚Äôre lying.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Bitcord Verdis?

To start live trading, you‚Äôll need to deposit **$250**. This is pretty standard for platforms in this space (similar to Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge).

The deposit unlocks access to live trading features, but you can stick with the demo if you want to test things out first. I definitely recommend playing around in demo mode before going live.

### Bitcord Verdis Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7 via live chat and email**. I tried the chat option and got a response within a few minutes. The support staff seemed knowledgeable and didn‚Äôt just copy-paste answers.

There‚Äôs no phone support, which would be a nice addition, but the current setup gets the job done.

## How do you start trading on Bitcord Verdis?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official Bitcord Verdis website and fill out the sign-up form. You‚Äôll need your name, email, and phone number. No credit card required for registration.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once registered, you‚Äôll be redirected to a broker‚Äôs site to verify your identity. Then, make a **$250 deposit** using credit card, bank transfer, or crypto wallet.

### Step 3: Start Trading

You can either let the bot auto-trade using default settings or tweak your own trading rules. There‚Äôs also the option to switch to manual trading if you prefer full control.

## How to Delete a Bitcord Verdis Account?

To delete your Bitcord Verdis account:
1. Go to your account settings.
2. Click ‚ÄúDeactivate Account.‚Äù

1k3g3a9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/1k3g3a9/neighborhood_with_modern_builds_close_to_train/,"Neighborhood with modern builds, close to train lines, and actually has a personality?","I know there are lots of these posts but r/nycapartments I need y'all's help. I've lived in all sorts of apartments in my time in NYC in a fair amount of (but certainly not all) neighborhoods. I'm looking for my first lease post-breakup and I kinda feel like my preferences have changed so much I'm not sure where to go anymore.

I'm 31M and work in tech. I'd love to find a 1b/1b apartment around $4K and would go up a tiny bit more than that for the perfect spot. Things I can compromise on are space (depends on the layout but anything much past 500 sqft is probably overkill -- but I don't want a studio as the lack of separation of space bothers me) and natural light (hot take, I know). What I'm pretty picky on is in unit laundry and modern finishings, especially in the bathroom (I'm very prissy about this)... unfortunately this boxes me into either ""luxury"" buildings or recently renovated shoeboxes.

Originally my plan was to just rent some soulless luxury building in DTBK. I have friends in the neighborhood (tech bros lol), it's a convenient commute to work (off 14th/8th... you can figure it out), it's convenient to the various other places I have friends, and it has some pretty nice buildings that I've stayed in so I feel comfortable in management and in terms build quality (esp. noise, from other units as well as street). I typically go into the office 5 times a week and end up in Manhattan anyway on the weekends.

But I've discovered the virtue of having a neighborhood spot where I can settle in for a coffee or a drink and read, get to know the staff/ regulars, etc., and I realized I'd really like to have that. DTBK does not have that at all; I could walk to one of the actually good neighborhoods nearby but knowing myself, I think anything more than a \~15 min walk will be enough friction to get me to be too lazy to go out. It'd also be nice to be in a neighborhood with similarly aged folks in late 20s to early 30s, and also demerits to any stroller-friendly place (love kids but, y'know, different stages of life and all). Williamsburg feels too young, Park Slopeish feels too old. Most of my friends live in Brooklyn but work in Manhattan; anything north of maybe 34th will start to be a hindrance to socializing.

Does anyone have any suggestions? I was considering some of the adjacent neighborhoods to DTBK... I have my eyes on Fort Greene, either near City Point or closer to Lafayette. But I feel like a lot of these neighborhoods might skew a bit more towards people who are settled down? Also as a side note, I like to run and it'd be great to have access to a good running path(s) (from Lafayette I wouldn't mind running to/ through Prospect Park though).

## What is Arbitr Velthorin?

It‚Äôs designed for people who want to get into trading without needing a PhD in economics. The platform claims to offer **real-time market insights**, customizable alerts, and the ability to trade across different asset classes like crypto, forex, and stocks.

Basically, it‚Äôs trying to be your all-in-one trading co-pilot.

## Who Created Arbitr Velthorin?

Here‚Äôs where things get a little foggy. Like many trading platforms in this niche, Arbitr Velthorin doesn‚Äôt exactly have a celebrity founder. There‚Äôs no Elon or Vitalik-level face behind it.

However, from what I‚Äôve gathered, it appears to be developed by a team of fintech and AI developers who previously worked on similar platforms like Immediate Edge. The platform seems to be backed by a group of **experienced software engineers and financial analysts**, which adds a little credibility, even if they‚Äôre not front and center.

Would I have preferred a more transparent ‚ÄúAbout Us‚Äù page? For sure. But that's pretty standard in this space.

## Arbitr Velthorin ‚Äì Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is where the platform really shines. The AI engine runs **real-time data analysis** to detect trading signals. It monitors trends, news, and price action, and adapts its strategy accordingly.

This is super handy because most of us don‚Äôt have the time (or patience) to track every candle on a chart.

### User-Friendly Interface

The UI is clean, intuitive, and beginner-friendly. You don‚Äôt need to be a tech wizard to navigate through the dashboard. All the major features are clearly labeled, and it walks you through the basics.

It‚Äôs a small detail, but very helpful if you want to stay in the loop without being constantly logged in.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Arbitr Velthorin doesn‚Äôt limit you to just crypto. You can also trade:
- **Forex**
- **Stocks**
- **Commodities**
- **Indices**

This adds a layer of flexibility. If Bitcoin is tanking, you can switch to forex or stocks without needing a whole new platform.

## Is Arbitr Velthorin a Scam?

Short answer: **No**, it doesn‚Äôt appear to be a scam.

I‚Äôve tested the platform, made a couple of trades, and even withdrew a small amount just to check. Everything worked as promised. The trades executed as expected, and I got my funds within 36 hours.

That said, always be cautious. Automated trading still involves risk, and there‚Äôs **no such thing as guaranteed profits**. Arbitr Velthorin seems legit, but only invest what you can afford to lose.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Arbitr Velthorin?

You‚Äôll need to deposit at least **$250** to get started. This is pretty standard across similar platforms like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge.

Guys I need your help! My husband says he loves me but everytime I ask him to spend quality time with me he says he has to do this or that, but the second his family needs anything he‚Äôs there immediately and it just bothers me so much. (I live with his family) He does spend time with me but it‚Äôs like whenever I want to just talk to him and have a conversation with full attention he complains. Yesterday we were fighting all night because of this because I was getting mad that he won‚Äôt just talk to me. Then this morning he wakes up and the first thing he does is talk to his brother while having a coffee, doesn‚Äôt spend any time with me in the morning. Then his family comes over and then he says he wants to play the game with his brother and immediately plays the game without spending any time with me. This really hurt me because last night he kept saying he felt like it was jail with me and I just get mad if he does anything but I don‚Äôt feel like that‚Äôs true. This is his first weekend off in ages and he hasn‚Äôt spent anytime talking to me other than that fight. The first day he was helping his brother with stuff all day and it would make sense, but the thing is his brother only hang with him until his wife gets home but I‚Äôm home all day and I just feel like I get nothing, he‚Äôll take me out to a dinner and then to him that‚Äôs quality time, how do I make him understand that it‚Äôs not the same as just laying in bed and talking? I just feel so alone because I‚Äôll explain to him what the issue is for hours (like last night) and then he‚Äôll do the opposite the next morning

But what makes it stand out?

It‚Äôs not just another probiotic.

PrimeBiome contains a unique blend of **clinically researched strains**, including **Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis**, and others that are scientifically proven to survive stomach acid and reach your gut intact‚Äî*where they actually work*.

It also includes a **prebiotic fiber blend**, which feeds the good bacteria and helps them multiply.

When your gut is healthy, everything starts to work better‚Äîdigestion, metabolism, skin, mood, even brain function.

# Why I Decided to Try PrimeBiome (After Wasting Money on So Many Others)

Before PrimeBiome, I‚Äôd tried at least 10 different probiotic brands. Some gave me no results at all. Others actually made my digestion *worse*. Most didn‚Äôt even survive stomach acid.

I found PrimeBiome after reading a real review from someone who sounded just like me. They talked about how their life changed after taking it for a few months‚Äîand that convinced me to give it a try.

I ordered the **3-bottle pack** (better value), thinking I‚Äôd try it for 90 days.

I had no idea what was coming.

# Week 1: Subtle Shifts I Almost Missed

Within the first week, I noticed something small but important‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt feeling as *bloated* after meals. Normally, after lunch or dinner, I‚Äôd feel heavy, uncomfortable, and gassy. But after just 5 days, I felt *lighter*.

My cravings also started to shift. I wasn‚Äôt reaching for sugary snacks like usual. Was it a coincidence? I didn‚Äôt think much of it yet.

# Week 2: Better Sleep & More Energy

By week two, something clicked. I was waking up before my alarm, *feeling refreshed*. That hasn‚Äôt happened in *years*. My energy during the day felt more stable. I wasn‚Äôt crashing after lunch, and I didn‚Äôt need my usual afternoon coffee.

I started getting excited. If this is what two weeks looked like, I couldn‚Äôt wait to see what a month would bring.

# Month 1: My Body Felt ‚ÄúReset‚Äù

After a full 30 days on PrimeBiome, I felt like a completely different person.

* My **digestion was smooth**‚Äîno more bloating or stomach cramps.
* I was going to the bathroom *regularly* (TMI, but if you know, you know).
* My **skin cleared up**‚Äîthose random breakouts disappeared.
* My **mood was better**. I wasn‚Äôt snapping at people or feeling foggy. I felt *present*.
* And here‚Äôs the kicker: I lost **7 pounds**‚Äîwithout changing my diet.

I later found out that poor gut health can cause *inflammation*, which leads to water retention and weight gain. Once the inflammation went down, my body finally released the excess.

# Months 2-3: Long-Term Benefits Start Showing

By month two, the changes became even more noticeable.

Friends and coworkers were asking me what I was doing differently. My **skin was glowing**, my energy was high, and my mind was *clear*‚Äîlike I had mental clarity for the first time in years.

Even my **immune system** seemed to improve. Normally, I‚Äôd catch a cold at least once a month. But for three straight months? Nothing. Not even a sniffle.

I also noticed my **anxiety levels dropped**. It turns out, your gut produces up to 90% of your serotonin‚Äîthe feel-good hormone. By fixing my gut, I was fixing my mind too.

# The PrimeBiome Difference (Why It Actually Works)

Here‚Äôs why I believe PrimeBiome works when others fail:

‚úÖ **10 Billion CFUs** from clinically proven strains  
‚úÖ **Survives stomach acid** to actually reach your gut  
‚úÖ **Includes prebiotics**, which most brands ignore  
‚úÖ **Non-GMO, no fillers, no garbage ingredients**  
‚úÖ **Manufactured in an FDA-approved, GMP-certified facility**  
‚úÖ **Real results backed by thousands of happy customers**

It‚Äôs not just another trendy supplement. It‚Äôs *science-backed and results-driven*.

# The Only Downside‚Ä¶

The only ‚Äúcon‚Äù I‚Äôve found?

It sells out *fast*.

When I went to reorder after month three, it was out of stock. I had to wait two weeks‚Äîand during that time, I noticed some of my symptoms creeping back in. That‚Äôs when I realized this isn‚Äôt just a short-term boost. It‚Äôs something your body *wants and needs consistently*.

Now, I always keep a few bottles on hand. I even got my partner and my parents on it‚Äîand they‚Äôre hooked too.

# Final Verdict: Is PrimeBiome Worth It?

**YES. 1000 times yes.**

If you‚Äôre struggling with digestion, fatigue, low mood, skin problems, or stubborn weight that won‚Äôt budge‚Äîyour gut could be the root cause.

I never thought a single supplement could do this much. But PrimeBiome isn‚Äôt just any supplement‚Äîit‚Äôs a total body reset from the inside out.

I only wish I had started sooner.

# My Advice: Don‚Äôt Wait. Try It for 30 Days and See for Yourself

If you‚Äôre on the fence, I totally get it. I was too. But trust me‚Äî**you have nothing to lose and everything to gain**.

Try it for 30 days. Just one bottle. Give it a real shot.

I can almost guarantee you‚Äôll feel the difference‚Äîand once you do, you‚Äôll never want to go back.

üëâ **Order PrimeBiome from the official site** while it‚Äôs still in stock. Don‚Äôt buy from random third-party sellers (there are fakes out there). Go direct, get the real thing, and thank me later.

# The PrimeBiome Difference (Why It Actually Works)

Here‚Äôs why I believe PrimeBiome works when others fail:

‚úÖ **10 Billion CFUs** from clinically proven strains  
‚úÖ **Survives stomach acid** to actually reach your gut  
‚úÖ **Includes prebiotics**, which most brands ignore  
‚úÖ **Non-GMO, no fillers, no garbage ingredients**  
‚úÖ **Manufactured in an FDA-approved, GMP-certified facility**  
‚úÖ **Real results backed by thousands of happy customers**

It‚Äôs not just another trendy supplement. It‚Äôs *science-backed and results-driven*.

# The Only Downside‚Ä¶

The only ‚Äúcon‚Äù I‚Äôve found?

It sells out *fast*.

When I went to reorder after month three, it was out of stock. I had to wait two weeks‚Äîand during that time, I noticed some of my symptoms creeping back in. That‚Äôs when I realized this isn‚Äôt just a short-term boost. It‚Äôs something your body *wants and needs consistently*.

Now, I always keep a few bottles on hand. I even got my partner and my parents on it‚Äîand they‚Äôre hooked too.

# Final Verdict: Is PrimeBiome Worth It?

**YES. 1000 times yes.**

If you‚Äôre struggling with digestion, fatigue, low mood, skin problems, or stubborn weight that won‚Äôt budge‚Äîyour gut could be the root cause.

I never thought a single supplement could do this much. But PrimeBiome isn‚Äôt just any supplement‚Äîit‚Äôs a total body reset from the inside out.

I only wish I had started sooner.

# My Advice: Don‚Äôt Wait. Try It for 30 Days and See for Yourself

If you‚Äôre on the fence, I totally get it. I was too. But trust me‚Äî**you have nothing to lose and everything to gain**.

Try it for 30 days. Just one bottle. Give it a real shot.

I can almost guarantee you‚Äôll feel the difference‚Äîand once you do, you‚Äôll never want to go back.

Before PrimeBiome, I‚Äôd tried at least 10 different probiotic brands. Some gave me no results at all. Others actually made my digestion *worse*. Most didn‚Äôt even survive stomach acid.

I found PrimeBiome after reading a real review from someone who sounded just like me. They talked about how their life changed after taking it for a few months‚Äîand that convinced me to give it a try.

I ordered the **3-bottle pack** (better value), thinking I‚Äôd try it for 90 days.

* My **skin cleared up**‚Äîthose random breakouts disappeared.
* My **mood was better**. I wasn‚Äôt snapping at people or feeling foggy. I felt *present*.

When I went to reorder after month three, it was out of stock. I had to wait two weeks‚Äîand during that time, I noticed some of my symptoms creeping back in. That‚Äôs when I realized this isn‚Äôt just a short-term boost. It‚Äôs something your body *wants and needs consistently*.

Now, I always keep a few bottles on hand. I even got my partner and my parents on it‚Äîand they‚Äôre hooked too.

# Final Verdict: Is PrimeBiome Worth It?

**YES. 1000 times yes.**

If you‚Äôre struggling with digestion, fatigue, low mood, skin problems, or stubborn weight that won‚Äôt budge‚Äîyour gut could be the root cause.

I never thought a single supplement could do this much. But PrimeBiome isn‚Äôt just any supplement‚Äîit‚Äôs a total body reset from the inside out.

I only wish I had started sooner.

# My Advice: Don‚Äôt Wait. Try It for 30 Days and See for Yourself

If you‚Äôre on the fence, I totally get it. I was too. But trust me‚Äî**you have nothing to lose and everything to gain**.

Try it for 30 days. Just one bottle. Give it a real shot.

I can almost guarantee you‚Äôll feel the difference‚Äîand once you do, you‚Äôll never want to go back.

üëâ **Order PrimeBiome from the official site** while it‚Äôs still in stock. Don‚Äôt buy from random third-party sellers (there are fakes out there). Go direct, get the real thing, and thank me later.

1k3foxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1k3foxq/the_whispers_in_apartment_9b/,The Whispers in Apartment 9B,"Mia Parker had walked past the Blackwood building dozens of times before noticing the ""For Rent"" sign in the window. A stately pre-war structure with ornate stonework and actual gargoyles perched on the corners, it stood out among the cookie-cutter condos that had sprouted across the neighborhood like weeds. The sign looked weathered, as if it had been there for months.

She peered through the wrought-iron gate at the marble steps leading to a heavy wooden door. Mia had been living out of her friend's spare room for three months now, and the awkward dance of avoided eye contact in the hallway each morning had grown stale. Her phone was already in her hand before she could second-guess herself.

The woman who answered spoke with a smoker's rasp. ""Blackwood Apartments. How may I help you?""

""Hi, I'm calling about the apartment for rent? I was walking by and‚Äî""

""Apartment 9B. It's available immediately. $850 per month, utilities included.""

Mia nearly dropped her phone. Eight-fifty? In this part of town? Studios went for twice that. ""That... seems really reasonable.""

""Previous tenant left abruptly. Owner wants it occupied quickly."" The woman's tone was flat, practiced. ""I can show it this afternoon if you're interested.""

""Yes,"" Mia said, too quickly. ""Yes, definitely.""

""Four o'clock. Ask for Ms. Blackwood at the front desk.""

The call ended before Mia could respond.

---

Ms. Blackwood was impossibly tall and thin, with silver hair pulled back so tightly it seemed to stretch her face into a permanent expression of mild surprise. Her black dress reached her ankles, and a ring of keys jangled at her waist like medieval armor.

""Follow me, please."" She didn't offer a handshake or introduction, just turned and walked toward the elevator, her movements oddly fluid, as if her joints bent in unusual ways.

The elevator was a beautiful antique cage with intricate metalwork. As they ascended, Ms. Blackwood stared straight ahead. ""The building has been in my family for generations. We're very particular about our tenants.""

""Oh?"" Mia tried to sound casual. ""What are you looking for in a tenant?""

Ms. Blackwood's lips twitched. ""Someone who values privacy. Both their own and others'.""

The ninth floor hallway was eerily silent. The carpet runner muffled their footsteps as they passed apartments 9A, 9C, 9D... Mia frowned. ""Wait, where's 9B?""

Ms. Blackwood pointed to a door nestled in an alcove, almost hidden from view unless you knew to look for it. ""Right here.""

The door to 9B was different from the others ‚Äì darker wood, with a tarnished brass knocker shaped like a woman's face, mouth open in what could have been song or scream.

""The previous tenant left some furnishings. You may keep them or dispose of them as you wish."" Ms. Blackwood unlocked the door. ""After you.""

Mia stepped inside and forgot how to breathe. The apartment was stunning. High ceilings with crown molding. Hardwood floors that gleamed in the afternoon light. A small but elegant kitchen with vintage tile. A living room with a bay window overlooking the park. A bedroom large enough for a queen-sized bed.

""This is... incredible."" Mia turned slowly, taking it all in. ""Why is it so cheap?""

""The previous tenant complained of noise."" Ms. Blackwood's face remained impassive. ""The walls in these old buildings can be thin.""

""I don't mind a little noise. I lived above a bar for two years.""

""Indeed."" Ms. Blackwood's eyes traveled over Mia's face. ""The deposit is one month's rent. You'll need to pass a background check, of course, but assuming everything is in order, the apartment could be yours by this weekend.""

""I'll take it."" Mia didn't need to think. Even if she had to wear earplugs to sleep, this place was worth it.

Ms. Blackwood nodded once, as if Mia's acceptance was inevitable. ""Very good. I'll prepare the paperwork.""

---

Mia moved in on Saturday. The apartment came with a few pieces of furniture ‚Äì a Queen Anne desk in the corner of the living room, a bookshelf, and a full-length mirror with an ornate frame. They didn't really match her IKEA aesthetic, but they were beautiful pieces, probably worth more than everything else she owned combined.

Her friend Zack helped her carry the last of her boxes up. ""This place is fucking amazing, Mia. I still can't believe the rent.""

""I know. There's gotta be a catch, right?""

""Maybe it's haunted,"" he joked, setting down a box of kitchen supplies.

""If it is, the ghosts better pay their share of the utilities."" Mia laughed, but something about the apartment made her voice sound hollow, like she was speaking in a much larger room.

Zack left around six, promising to bring pizza and beer once she was settled. Mia spent the next few hours unpacking, arranging her meager possessions around the elegant bones of the apartment.

Night fell, and the apartment took on a different character in the dark. Shadows pooled in the corners. The streetlights cast strange patterns through the window. Mia turned on every lamp she owned, but the darkness seemed to absorb the light, keeping the edges of the room dim.

She was hanging clothes in the bedroom closet when she first heard it. A sound so faint she almost missed it. A whisper, coming from somewhere inside the wall.

Mia froze, hanger in hand.

*""...window...""*

She turned off her music, straining to hear. ""Hello?""

Nothing. Just the ambient sounds of the building settling. She shook her head. Old buildings made noises. That's all it was.

She finished unpacking around midnight, exhausted but pleased with her new home. The bed she'd ordered wouldn't arrive until tomorrow, so she made a nest of blankets on the living room floor. As she drifted off to sleep, she thought she heard it again, right at the edge of hearing.

*""...open the window...""*

But she was already falling into dreams.

---

Mia woke to sunlight streaming through the bay window and the smell of coffee. For a disorienting moment, she didn't remember where she was. Then it came back ‚Äì the apartment, 9B, her new home.

But the coffee smell made no sense. She hadn't made any.

She sat up, blanket clutched to her chest, and saw a steaming mug on the antique desk across the room.

""What the fuck?"" She scrambled to her feet, heart pounding.

Had someone been in her apartment while she slept? She checked the door ‚Äì still locked, deadbolt engaged. The windows were all closed. She looked back at the coffee mug. It was one of hers, unpacked last night and placed in the kitchen cabinet.

With shaking hands, she picked up the mug. The coffee was hot, just the way she liked it ‚Äì splash of milk, no sugar.

Mia dumped it down the sink and spent the next hour searching every inch of the apartment, looking for signs of intrusion. Nothing. No one could have gotten in. She must have made the coffee herself and forgotten. Sleep-walking, maybe? She'd never done that before, but stress could do weird things to people.

Her mattress arrived at noon, and setting it up distracted her from the morning's strangeness. By evening, she'd convinced herself she'd imagined the whole thing.

She made dinner, watched a movie on her laptop, and was getting ready for bed when she heard it again.

*""...the desk...""*

Mia froze, toothbrush halfway to her mouth. The whisper was clearer this time, seeming to come from the wall between the bathroom and the living room.

*""...open the desk drawer...""*

""Hello? Is someone there?"" Her voice sounded small in the tiled bathroom.

Nothing.

Cautiously, she went to the living room and approached the antique desk. It had a single drawer, ornately carved with a pattern of vines and small flowers. She'd assumed it was locked or stuck, as it hadn't opened when she'd tried it earlier.

Now, she grasped the brass handle and pulled. The drawer slid open smoothly.

Inside was a leather-bound journal, its cover cracked with age. Mia lifted it out, feeling a strange reluctance to touch it. The pages were yellowed, filled with handwriting that varied from neat script to frantic scrawls.

The first entry was dated October 17, 1954.

*I've taken the apartment on Blackwood Street. The price was suspiciously low, but I can't afford to be picky. The landlady gives me chills. I swear her shadow moves differently than she does.*

Mia flipped through the journal. Entries detailed mundane aspects of life, interspersed with increasingly paranoid observations about noises in the walls, items moving on their own, and a growing conviction that the apartment itself was somehow alive.

The final entry, dated December 3, 1954, consisted of just three words, written in a shaky hand:

*They were right.*

Mia closed the journal, her mouth dry. This had to be some kind of joke. Zack, maybe? It would be just like him to plant something creepy as a housewarming prank.

She shoved the journal back in the drawer and slammed it shut. As she headed to bed, she could have sworn she heard soft laughter coming from inside the walls.

---

Mia woke at 3:17 AM, the time glowing red on her bedside clock. Something had pulled her from sleep ‚Äì a sound. She lay perfectly still, listening.

*""...kitchen knife...""*

The whisper was crystal clear, as if someone had spoken directly into her ear. Mia bolted upright, fumbling for the lamp switch.

*""...take the knife...""*

""Who's there?"" Her voice cracked with fear.

*""...cut it out...""*

""Stop it!"" Mia pressed her hands over her ears, but the whispers seemed to bypass her ears entirely, materializing directly in her mind.

*""...cut it out of your arm...""*

She stumbled out of bed, turning on every light as she moved through the apartment. The whispers followed, growing in volume and urgency.

*""CUT IT OUT CUT IT OUT CUT IT OUT""*

In the kitchen, her eyes fell on the knife block. Without consciously deciding to, she found herself reaching for the chef's knife, its blade gleaming in the fluorescent light.

*""...they put something in your arm while you were sleeping...""*

Mia looked down at her left forearm. There was nothing there ‚Äì no cut, no scar, no mark of any kind. But as she stared, she began to feel a strange sensation, like something moving beneath the skin.

*""...cut it out before it reaches your heart...""*

The knife in her hand felt hot, almost vibrating with purpose. She pressed the tip against her skin.

A knock at the door shattered the moment.

""Maintenance! Water leak reported in 9B!""

Mia dropped the knife with a clatter. ""What?""

""Need to check your bathroom pipes, ma'am. Emergency.""

She walked to the door in a daze, peering through the peephole. A middle-aged man in overalls stood in the hallway, toolbox in hand.

""It's four in the morning,"" she said through the door.

""Leak's coming through to the apartment below. Need to fix it before there's structural damage.""

It sounded reasonable enough. Mia unlatched the door, keeping the chain on, and opened it a crack. ""Can I see some ID?""

The man held up a badge. ""Joe Mercer, building maintenance.""

Something felt wrong, but Mia couldn't place what. Her mind was foggy, as if she'd been drugged. She closed the door, removed the chain, and let him in.

Joe's eyes darted around the apartment. ""You're hearing them, aren't you? The whispers.""

Mia took a step back. ""What?""

""I shouldn't be here. She doesn't like it when I interfere."" He spoke quickly, voice low. ""But I can't watch it happen again. Listen to me carefully. The whispers aren't real, but they're not hallucinations either. They're..."" He struggled for words. ""They're like recordings. Echoes of things that have happened before.""

""I don't understand.""

""This building feeds on pain. On violence. It... encourages it."" Joe ran a hand through his thinning hair. ""That's why the rent is so low. It wants you here.""

""That's insane,"" Mia said, but her voice lacked conviction. The knife on the kitchen counter seemed to gleam in her peripheral vision.

""Everyone thinks so, until it's too late."" Joe opened his toolbox and pulled out a small fabric pouch. ""Iron filings and salt. Pour a line across your doorway and along your windowsills. It won't stop the whispers, but it'll weaken them.""

Mia took the pouch automatically. ""Are you fucking with me? Is this some kind of sick game?""

""I wish it was."" Joe's eyes were haunted. ""I've worked here for twenty years. Seen too many tenants in 9B come and go. Or not go, as the case may be.""

""What happened to them?""

""They listened to the whispers."" He headed for the door. ""Use the iron and salt. And whatever you do, don't follow their instructions. No matter how compelling they seem.""

After he left, Mia stood in the middle of her living room, pouch clutched in her hand, feeling utterly lost. Part of her wanted to pack a bag and leave immediately. But another part ‚Äì a part that seemed to be growing stronger ‚Äì was curiously unafraid. Almost eager to hear the whispers again.

She poured the mixture along the doorway and windowsills, feeling ridiculous. Then she went back to bed, knife tucked under her pillow.

The whispers were silent for the rest of the night.

---

Mia called in sick to work the next day. She spent the morning researching the Blackwood building online, finding little beyond its listing on the historic register and a mention of its architect, a man named Elias Blackwood who'd designed several buildings in the city before disappearing under mysterious circumstances in 1937.

She texted Zack: *Did you leave an old journal in my desk as a joke?*

His reply came quickly: *What journal? What desk? Your IKEA stuff doesn't have drawers.*

*The antique desk in my apartment. Someone left a creepy old journal in it.*

*Pics or it didn't happen.*

Mia went to the desk, pulled open the drawer, and froze. The journal was gone.

She tore the apartment apart looking for it, but it had vanished as mysteriously as it had appeared. By evening, she was beginning to doubt her own memory. Had there ever been a journal? Had Joe the maintenance man really visited, or had that been a dream too?

The whispers returned at sunset.

*""...check the mirror...""*

Mia had spent the day steeling herself against them, so when they came, she wasn't surprised. Terrified, yes, but not surprised.

*""...your reflection knows...""*

Moving as if in a trance, she walked to the full-length mirror in the bedroom. Her reflection stared back, pale and wide-eyed. But as she watched, something changed. A subtle shift in expression, her reflected self smiling slightly when she was not.

Mia raised her hand. The reflection raised its hand a fraction of a second too late.

*""...ask her...""*

""Who are you?"" Mia whispered to her reflection.

Her reflection's mouth moved, but the voice came from behind her: ""I'm you. The real you.""

Mia spun around. No one was there.

When she turned back to the mirror, her reflection was gone. Instead, she saw her bedroom from an impossible angle, as if the mirror was a window into another version of her apartment. And there, sitting on the edge of the bed, was herself.

The other Mia looked up and smiled. ""They're getting louder, aren't they? The whispers.""

""What is this?"" Mia's voice shook. ""What's happening to me?""

""Nothing is happening *to* you. It's happening *because* of you."" Other Mia stood and approached the mirror. ""We've always known something was wrong with us. The things we think about. The urges we push down.""

""I don't know what you're talking about.""

""Don't lie. Not to yourself."" Other Mia pressed her palm against the glass. ""Remember Connor? Sophomore year? How you imagined pushing him down the stairs after he broke up with you?""

Mia took a step back. ""That was just a thought. Everyone has dark thoughts.""

""But not everyone gets excited by them."" Other Mia's smile widened. ""The whispers aren't coming from the apartment, Mia. They're coming from you. The apartment is just... amplifying them. Giving them voice.""

""No.""

""Yes. This place doesn't create darkness. It reveals it. Nurtures it."" Other Mia's eyes gleamed. ""I'm what you could be if you stopped fighting. If you embraced what you really are.""

""I'm not listening to this."" Mia grabbed a blanket from the bed and threw it over the mirror. Through the fabric, she heard her own voice, muffled but distinct:

""You can't cover up what's inside you.""

---

Mia didn't sleep that night. Or the next. By the third day, exhaustion had worn her defenses paper-thin. The whispers were constant now, a steady stream of suggestions that grew more violent, more specific.

*""...the old woman in 7A walks her dog at midnight... no one would see you follow her into the park...""*

*""...the delivery boy has a weak spot in his neck... just below the ear... one quick thrust...""*

*""...drain cleaner in their coffee... they'd never taste it...""*

She stopped answering her phone. Stopped leaving the apartment. Ordered food delivered, leaving cash outside the door so she wouldn't have to face another person.

The salt and iron mix had run out days ago. Joe hadn't returned. Mia wasn't sure he'd ever been real.

On the seventh night, she woke to find herself standing in the kitchen, blood dripping from her hand where she'd gripped a broken glass. She had no memory of getting out of bed.

In the bathroom, washing the cuts, she looked up to see her reflection watching her with that not-quite-her smile.

""You're losing time,"" her reflection said conversationally. ""That's how it starts. Soon you'll wake up to find you've done something that can't be undone.""

""Shut up,"" Mia whispered.

""You know what's funny? Every tenant in 9B thinks they're going crazy at first. They blame the building, the whispers, the mirror. But it's never the apartment. It's always been them. The apartment just gives them permission.""

""I'm not like the others.""

""No, you're worse."" Her reflection leaned forward. ""The others had to be convinced. You've been waiting for this your whole life. You just didn't know it.""

Mia smashed her fist into the mirror. It shattered, shards slicing into her already wounded hand. Blood spattered across the white tiles.

From every broken piece, her reflection laughed.

---

Ms. Blackwood came to check on her the next day. ""Complaints about noise,"" she said, standing in the doorway, her tall frame blocking the light from the hallway. ""Are you having difficulties, Ms. Parker?""

Mia knew how she must look ‚Äì unwashed, eyes red-rimmed from lack of sleep, bandages around both hands. ""I'm fine. Just... adjusting.""

Ms. Blackwood's gaze traveled past her, taking in the apartment. Her nostrils flared slightly. ""I smell blood.""

""I broke a glass. Cut myself cleaning it up.""

""I see."" Ms. Blackwood's thin lips curved into what might have been a smile. ""The apartment can be... overwhelming at first. Most tenants require an adjustment period.""

""The whispers,"" Mia said, too exhausted to pretend. ""Do all tenants hear them?""

Something flickered in Ms. Blackwood's eyes ‚Äì satisfaction, perhaps. ""Only the special ones. The ones the building chooses.""

""Chooses for what?""

""To become part of its history. Its legacy."" Ms. Blackwood reached out, her cold fingers brushing Mia's cheek. ""You're fighting it. That's natural. But it's also pointless.""

Mia jerked away. ""I want to break my lease. I'll pay whatever penalty.""

""There is no breaking the lease, Ms. Parker. Not until the apartment is finished with you."" Ms. Blackwood turned to leave. ""Try to keep the noise down. The other tenants value their peace.""

After she left, Mia collapsed on the sofa, mind racing. She had to get out. Now, today, before whatever was happening progressed any further.

She grabbed her phone and called Zack. When he answered, she nearly wept with relief.

""Zack, thank god. I need help. Can you come get me? I need to get out of this apartment.""

""Mia? Jesus, you sound awful. What's going on?""

""I can't explain over the phone. Please, just come. Please.""

""Okay, okay. I'll be there in twenty minutes. Hang tight.""

Mia threw some clothes and essentials into a backpack, hands shaking so badly she could barely zip it closed. The whispers had risen to a near-shout, a cacophony of violent suggestions and dire warnings.

*""...he won't really come...""*

*""...he's lying to you...""*

*""...he's working with them...""*

*""...kill him when he arrives...""*

""Shut up!"" Mia screamed, pressing her hands over her ears. ""Shut up, shut up, shut up!""

When the knock came at her door, she nearly jumped out of her skin.

""Mia? It's Zack. Open up.""

She ran to the door, relief making her dizzy. But as she reached for the handle, the whispers converged into a single, deafening command:

*""DON'T TRUST HIM.""*

Mia hesitated. ""Zack?""

""Yeah, it's me. You okay in there?""

Something in his voice sounded wrong. Slightly off, like a musical note just shy of true.

""Did you come alone?"" she asked.

A pause. Too long. ""Yeah, course I did. Open up, Mia. I'm worried about you.""

Mia peered through the peephole. Zack stood there, looking normal enough. But behind him, partially hidden in the shadows of the hallway, she could make out another figure. Tall and thin.

""You brought Ms. Blackwood,"" she said, backing away from the door.

""Who? Mia, I don't know what you're talking about. Let me in so we can talk.""

""No. Go away."" Tears streamed down her face. ""Just leave me alone!""

""Mia, you're scaring me. You're not making sense.""

""I saw her behind you! I'm not stupid!""

Another pause. Then, in a voice that was Zack's but somehow not: ""Open the door, Mia. There's nowhere else for you to go.""

She ran to the bedroom, dragging a dresser in front of the door. Back in the living room, she could hear the lock turning. She'd forgotten that she'd given Zack a spare key when he helped her move in.

The front door swung open. Zack stepped inside, alone. No sign of Ms. Blackwood.

""Mia?"" he called. ""Where are you?""

She pressed herself against the bedroom wall, heart hammering. Had she imagined the second figure? Was she really losing her mind?

""In here,"" she said weakly.

Zack appeared in the doorway, concern etched on his familiar face. ""Jesus, Mia. You look like shit. What's going on?""

""You wouldn't believe me if I told you.""

""Try me."" He stepped into the room, hands open at his sides in a non-threatening gesture.

She told him everything ‚Äì the whispers, the mirror, Joe the maintenance man, Ms. Blackwood's cryptic warnings. As she spoke, Zack's expression shifted from concern to disbelief to something like pity.

""Mia, listen to yourself. Do you know how this sounds?""

""Like I'm crazy. I know."" She wiped at her tears. ""But I'm not. It's this place, Zack. It's doing something to me.""

""Okay."" He held up his hands. ""Okay. Let's say I believe you. We need to get you out of here, right? Get your stuff and you can stay with me until we figure this out.""

Relief washed over her. ""You believe me?""

""I believe you believe it. That's enough for now."" He smiled reassuringly. ""Come on, let's go.""

She grabbed her backpack, hope rising for the first time in days. As they headed for the front door, the whispers returned, panicked and insistent.

*""...trap...""*

*""...he's not your friend...""*

*""...look at his shadow...""*

Despite herself, Mia glanced down at the floor. Zack's shadow stretched behind him, elongated in the late afternoon light. But it wasn't shaped like him at all. It was thin, impossibly tall, with limbs that bent at unnatural angles.

It was Ms. Blackwood's shadow.

Mia stumbled back. ""Your shadow. What the fuck is wrong with your shadow?""

Zack turned, confused. ""What?""

""Don't lie to me!"" She pointed at the floor. ""Look at it!""

Zack glanced down, then back at her, face softening with concern. ""Mia, it's just a normal shadow. You're seeing things that aren't there.""

""No, I'm finally seeing what is there."" She backed away. ""You're not Zack.""

His expression shifted, concern replaced by something cold. ""Does it matter? You need to leave this apartment. I'm offering to take you. Isn't that what you wanted?""

""Not with you. Not... whatever you are.""

Zack ‚Äì or the thing wearing Zack's face ‚Äì sighed. ""We could have done this the easy way."" He reached into his pocket and pulled out a syringe. ""Now we do it the hard way.""

Mia ran for the kitchen, grabbing a knife from the block. ""Stay back!""

‚ÄúZack‚Äù advanced, syringe held ready. ""The building needs you, Mia. It's been waiting for someone like you for a long time.""

""What does it want from me?"" She brandished the knife, backing toward the bay window.

""What it always wants. Pain. Fear. Blood."" He smiled, and for a moment, his face seemed to ripple, revealing something ancient and hungry beneath the familiar features. ""You're going to do such beautiful things for us.""

Mia lunged, driving the knife into his chest. ‚ÄúZack‚Äù looked down at the handle protruding from his sternum with mild surprise. No blood flowed from the wound.

""That was rude,"" he said, and backhanded her across the room.

Mia hit the wall hard, stars exploding behind her eyes. As she slid to the floor, ‚ÄúZack‚Äù advanced, removing the knife from his chest as casually as if it were a splinter.

""The others fought too. At first."" He knelt beside her. ""But they all embraced it eventually. The darkness. The hunger. You will too.""

He raised the syringe. With her last ounce of strength, Mia kicked out, catching him in the knee. He toppled sideways, the syringe flying from his hand and skittering across the floor.

Mia scrambled after it, fingers closing around the plastic barrel. She spun, plunging the needle into ‚ÄúZack's‚Äù neck as he lunged for her.

His eyes widened. He grabbed at the syringe, but it was too late. Whatever had been meant for her was now pumping into him. He fell back, body convulsing.

Before her eyes, his features began to melt, flesh running like wax to reveal something else beneath ‚Äì something with too many teeth and eyes like black pits. His screams changed, deepening to an inhuman howl that seemed to shake the very walls.

And then, silence. The thing that had been Zack lay still, its form shifting back to human, though the face was now a blank mask, features indistinct.

The whispers had stopped.

Mia staggered to her feet, ears ringing in the sudden quiet. Her gaze fell on the antique desk, its drawer slightly ajar. Inside, the leather journal had reappeared.

With trembling hands, she opened it, flipping to the final entry she'd read before: *They were right.*

The pages after it, which had been blank before, were now filled with writing. The same handwriting as before, but the entries were dated in the future ‚Äì next week, next month, next year.

They detailed murders. Dozens of them, committed by the tenant of Apartment 9B. Detailed, graphic descriptions of kills that grew more elaborate, more sadistic over time.

And on the final page, a single line: *I've become what the building always knew I was.*

The signature beneath it was her own.

Mia dropped the journal, backing away as if it were a venomous snake. A strange calm settled over her, a clarity she hadn't felt in days.

She knew what the building wanted now. What it had always wanted. Not for her to fall victim to its whispers, but for her to become their source. To commit the acts they described, feeding the building's hunger for pain and fear, becoming part of its legacy of horror.

The previous tenants hadn't been victims. They'd been recruits. And they'd all succumbed.

Mia looked down at the thing that had been Zack, or had at least worn his face. Had the real Zack ever been here? Or had he been intercepted, replaced before he even reached her door?

She didn't know, and at this moment, it didn't matter. What mattered was that for the first time since moving in, the whispers were silent. She'd fought back, and she'd won. For now.

But the building was patient. It had stood for almost a century, collecting souls, nurturing the darkness within them until it blossomed into violence. It could wait her out.

Unless she ended it.

In the kitchen, she found matches and cooking oil. In the bathroom, rubbing alcohol and hairspray. She moved methodically, dousing furniture, curtains, carpets. The whole time, she waited for the whispers to return, for Ms. Blackwood to appear, for some force to stop her. But the apartment remained silent, as if holding its breath.

When everything was prepared, Mia stood in the center of the living room, lighter in hand. The beautiful apartment that had seemed too good to be true gleamed around her, a perfect trap.

""I know what you are now,"" she said aloud. ""What you want me to become. And I'm saying no.""

She flicked the lighter. The flame danced, tiny and fragile.

From somewhere deep within the walls came a sound ‚Äì not a whisper this time, but a low, rumbling growl. The floor beneath her feet trembled.

Mia smiled and dropped the lighter.

Fire bloomed around her, racing along the trails of accelerant. She stood still as flames climbed the walls, consuming the elegant moldings, the antique desk, the full-length mirror. The heat was intense, sweat pouring down her face, but she didn't move.

The whispers returned, frantic now.

*""...stop...""*

*""...you'll die too...""*

*""...please...""*

""I know,"" Mia said calmly, watching as the ceiling began to blister and crack. ""That's the point.""

The smoke was getting thick, making it hard to breathe. Distantly, she heard alarms begin to sound. The fire had spread beyond her apartment, following some unseen network through the walls.

As consciousness began to fade, Mia sank to her knees. The last thing she saw was the antique desk, somehow untouched by the flames despite being at the epicenter of the blaze. Its drawer opened, and the leather journal slid out, falling open to a new page.

The writing on it was in her hand, but she hadn't written it:

*It doesn't end with fire. It never ends.*

*I'll be waiting for the next tenant.*

---

Six months later, a young man walked past the newly renovated Blackwood building, admiring the restored stonework and the gleaming windows. His gaze fell on a sign in one of the ground floor windows: ""Luxury Apartments Now Leasing.""

He paused, checking the rent prices listed below. Surprisingly affordable for this part of town.

As he stood there, a whisper seemed to curl around him, soft as smoke:

*""...come inside...""*

Something about the building called to him, a sense of recognition he couldn't explain. He found himself walking up the marble steps before he'd consciously decided to.

In the elegant lobby, a tall, thin woman in black looked up from the front desk. Her smile was knowing, as if she'd been expecting him.

""I'm interested in seeing an apartment,"" he said.

""Of course."" Her eyes gleamed. ""We have a lovely unit available. Apartment 9B. It's perfect for someone like you.""

""Someone like me?""

She tilted her head, her smile widening to reveal too many teeth. ""Someone who listens to the whispers.""

Behind her, on the wall, hung a portrait of a young woman. The plaque beneath it read: ""Mia Parker, Beloved Tenant.""

In the painting, Mia's eyes seemed to follow him, her lips curved in a smile that didn't reach her eyes. And somewhere, just at the edge of hearing, whispers began to rise.",3,1745127865.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

This was a great meal folks! Do I think the main could have been better, yes I do. Ever since I had that Swedish Pasta Bolengnase,  I know how good retort pasta can be, so the bar is set high.

This did a great job capturing the feeling of stuffed pasta and the ricotta flavor. The chili flakes really help bolster the experience. No Tabasco was harmed in the eating of these pastas!

Pic 3 shows that beautiful golden cornbread! This is sweet cornbread folks, so if you don't like sweet cornbread you will hate this. Me, I love a dessert style cornbread and grew up eating this stuff, sometimes as the main meal, with butter and maple syrup on it. So, this, to me, was perfection. If this was griddled in some butter to get a little crispy and warm, it would be magical.

The inclusion of PB and raspberry jam is sort of odd here as the only logical thing to do with it is to eat it on the corn bread or that Xact candy, I mean, protein bar üòâ. I chose to put them on the cornbread. Am I glad I did? Maybe? You just need to try it yourselves to see.

Now I've been told this cornbread and the US cornbread are made by the same place. I don't dispute this, but they are in different packaging, and I think that impacts the taste a whole lot üòÄ.

Pic 4 is the sliced apples showing a bit of oxidation. No issues with the taste,  they were great! Protip, add a shake or 6 of cinnamon to those bad boys and BAM, you're in flavortown (wait, is that right?)!

Pic 5 shows the trail mix and Xact Bar. That trail mix was fantastic! A nice unique blend of components. This was my 1st Xact Bar. Honestly, I really wanted to like it more than I did. There was just something a little ""off"" on the flavor and texture. It wasn't rancid, just a bit strange to me. I would have rather had a Chunky Kit Kat smothered in that yummy PB!

Pics 6/7 are the bag, front and back.

The coffee was great ice cold! The Glace drink mixes are really nice too. Hard to describe the taste as they don't really seem to be a specific fruit taste.  My kiddo says it tastes like blue Gatorade, and I can't really argue against that. 

Overall, a great meal and I'm thankful to have the opportunity to experience a 2022 IMP!

I am blocked on everything whether it‚Äôs Instagram, Spotify, even freaking LinkedIn‚Ä¶I mean everything. I‚Äôm not sure if she blocked my number but I‚Äôm sure she did.

Let me start out by saying, I pray for my ex every night and I pray she goes so so so far in life because I know she will. Our time together was the best thing that has ever happened to me and no matter what I will always love her.

Me (20m) and my ex (19f) broke up back in October 2024. It was something I didn‚Äôt want to do and tried extremely hard to make things work. We were dating for 2 yrs and 10 months. The classic trope of ‚Äúnothing seem off and everything seem good to me‚Äù was exactly what happened to me. The previous year I was in college and just graduated this past May, I now work a big boy 9-5 so I‚Äôm not really all that free. My ex is also in college and went to school on the different side of the state so she was about a 3-4 hour car ride from me. Now that I am back home she was about an 1 1/2 from me.

I admit I had many shortcomings and many lessons to learn. This was in fact my first relationship so I am learning as I go. Granted that does not mean that I can get away scotch free I know that and I know I failed in many ways and could have done better in others.

It all started about a two years ago, I was in my first year of college and my ex would come visit me often (she has a car), life was great i got to see her and she would visit me at school it was awesome. Then last year she started college and would ask me to visit her at school as well (keep in mind I did not own a car at the time and it was a big insecurity of mine however foolish that sounds) I promised her that I would visit her at college at some point. I know ‚Äúsome point‚Äù is not the best look but not having a good way for transportation was definitely a struggle. She accepted it and life went on. I still did not visit her that whole year and it ate me up inside and really bothered me because I hate having empty promises and I wished I could go see her at school, I looked up train rides and it was about a 4 hour train ride and rather expensive and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable getting in an uber nor do I have the money for an uber. I also couldn‚Äôt ask my parents to drive me since they had to drive my younger sisters around and needed the car. 

So now this fall 2024 I started my 9-5 and have a ‚Äúprobationary period‚Äù meaning I was not an official employee and could not take days off (accept sick days and I needed a doctors note) I tried to explain that to my ex and she accepted it but was not thrilled. I helped her move in to college (finally made it to her college) but it was only for a few hours and I couldn‚Äôt stay over due to needing to go to work. I then tried to make plans to see her but we couldn‚Äôt find the time and life kept getting in the way. In early Oct 2024 she called me crying saying she missed me and she doesn‚Äôt know what to do. I told her that I miss her too and I‚Äôll find a way to get to see her‚Ä¶ then she called me a few days later and the same thing crying and saying she misses me but now she throws around the idea of ‚Äútaking a break‚Äù‚Ä¶now remember I have never been in a relationship before and for me this means that we r done like not getting back together. I told her that I will find a way to see her that weekend and she said ok‚Ä¶two days later she calls me and says that she wants to take a break and she‚Äôs crying‚Ä¶my heart is shattered and idk what to do‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm asking her to just give me a another 2 days and I‚Äôll see her. She said she couldn‚Äôt it was to much. Her mom got on the phone and said ‚Äúhey we love and appreciate you but you just can‚Äôt give her what she needs right now‚Äù now my sadness turned into anger because it should have been a me and my ex convo and now it‚Äôs us two and her mom and what her mom said really hurt me. I admit I got alittle pissed and got alittle stern in my speaking because now I‚Äôm feel I‚Äôm being disrespected. I gave her everything I had with the little money I had. I know I broke the promise of going to see her but I was determined to visit her at school.

So we hang up and now I‚Äôm single and extremely depressed. I don‚Äôt really each much and I don‚Äôt think about much‚Ä¶i basically am ignored for about 2 weeks until I text her and ask to meet up because I have some questions that need answers‚Ä¶a few weeks later we meet up at her house and we hug and cry. I was praying that we could fix things and I seriously thought she thought that too. She explained that she felt that I was not valuing her and she felt hurt when I told her that ‚ÄúI will see‚Äù if I can make it to her sorority formal. Again my job has a probationary period and her formal was on a Friday and I could not take off of work. So when she asked me if I could go in early September I said ‚Äúwe will see‚Äù or ‚ÄúI plan on it but I‚Äôm not sure‚Äù, something to that effect. She also felt that I was alittle to controlling because I would get alittle upset when she would go with her sorority to frat parties. 

Now I acknowledge that i should have trusted her more and grow up. I eventually st one point told her that I have let the whole frat party thing go and promised to not be upset about her going to them and I really did try and thought I was doing a good job, clearly I guess she felt otherwise. 

I voiced my feelings on how I felt that she struggled to understand my position and where things are at in my life (I work, I was saving up every penny for a car, and I was working to pay off my loans form school) I was not as free as she is‚Ä¶she also felt that we had two different directions in life, she wants to live her NYC and I‚Äôm not sure where I want to live just yet (I was never opposed to NYC I just didn‚Äôt wanna spend my whole life there)

At the end of the discussion it came to an agreement that we will still talk casually to each other but we will take some time apart (I really didn‚Äôt want that I wanted to be back together again but accepted it) I said goodbye for now to her, her parents and her pets‚Ä¶I cried the whole way home. After about a month I had enough money to get a car and somewhere in my heart to thought getting a car was a step towards getting her back, truthfully I knew it wasn‚Äôt but I was hopeful. 

I should have shown more restraint and acknowledged it back then but I did find myself seeking out her insta stories and I did double snap her and snap her more than I should have‚Ä¶I did not always try to go looking for her posts but I would scroll through insta just liking posts and would occasionally like her post if it popped up‚Ä¶I then eventually texted her and just said basic things like ‚Äúhow‚Äôs it going‚Äù, ‚Äúdoing anything fun this weekend‚Äù, etc‚Ä¶just trying to keep our relationship at a bare minimum and‚Ä¶I felt that I was the one putting in all the effort to keep a semblance of what we once had. 

I soon texted her and asked her if she would be interested in meeting up and getting coffee‚Ä¶that was it, nothing more nothing less, ofc I would have loved to use it as a chance to possible get back together but I know chances where slim. She said no and that it was way to early and she feels like I‚Äôm forcing her to say yes and all this stuff that made her seem more and more like a victim when I was the one who pretty much got dumped and ones the one trying to keep things going. I apologized and said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry let‚Äôs just forget about it‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt mean to cause any problems‚Ä¶etc‚Äù so about a month later I tried the same thing and the same result happened. In retrospect I really should have learned my lesson and I realized I was becoming if not already a bit over the top.

Now I should have been alittle more conscientious about this but you live and you learn. I still found myself occasionally coming across her social media and viewing her story and snapping her alitlte to much (and I mean like once and a while after like 18 hours of no responses I would snap her again) then She texted me and felt that I was being alittle to stalkerish which I apologize many for with as much sincerity as a text could have but I also tried to explain that it wasn‚Äôt on purpose. Before I knew it she blocked me on everything I mean everything‚Ä¶as I mentioned before Spotify was not even sparred. I was destroyed even further but i understood that you reap what you sow. And I tried my best to pick myself up and become a better man.

I now have a car that I love, I started going to the gym to lose weight and gain muscle, I‚Äôm focusing more on my passion (making music) and I‚Äôm trying to reconnect with some old friends. My parents say that maybe this is a good thing and my mom is trying it get me into stepping back out there and dating but I really have no interest. I still am in love with my ex and have been on no contact/ blocked for about 2 months now‚Ä¶ I still pray for her and hope she goes far in this life. I love her from afar and find myself wondering what wrong that made this all happen.

I‚Äôm very open about my faults in the relationship and I hope she is aware of her shortcomings as well and I pray we find each other again soon. 

I don‚Äôt know what she is up to by now or if she found someone new‚Ä¶she might even be making posts making fun of me or praying for my down fall but I truly love her and gave her everything I could and then some. I had shortcomings in the relationship and I hope she knows she did as well. I have grown and can fix these problems as to now have them happen again

I know this is long but I wanted to give context‚Ä¶I still don‚Äôt know if my number is blocked but given everything that happened should I try to text her again? I need advice I don‚Äôt know what to do. I still love her and think about her daily and cry quite often. I‚Äôm not even sure if she thinks about me anymore but I really pray me and her can find each other again because in my heart I feel that our story should not have ended the way it did.

I‚Äôm 28 years old. I live with my parents in an apartment in a close-knit society. I work from home as a software employee, so I‚Äôm alone most of the day. My mom and dad run a boutique, leaving early in the morning and coming back at night. I believe that consensual sex is fine, even with family members, if both people agree.

For the past six months, I‚Äôve been in a sexual relationship with my aunt She‚Äôs 42 and lives in   few flats away in our society. Her husband, my uncle, works for the railway and often away from home, and their daughter, my cousin, is studying abroad. My aunt has a job, but every morning before she goes to work, she comes to my home. We both have coffee and quick  sex everyday , and it‚Äôs been our routine. I‚Äôll share how it began another time, but we both wanted it, and I care about her a lot.
Last Sunday, we planned something special‚Äîa massage and bath together. I set up my bedroom with mat and lavender oil. I was massaging my aunt, and we were both in a great mood. Suddenly, the doorbell rang. I thought it was the delivery boy, so I wrapped a towel around myself and ran to open the door, half-naked. To my shock, it was my mom. She wasn‚Äôt supposed to be home until midnight, but it was only the afternoon.
Mom‚Äôs eyes widened when she saw me. ""Viky what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù she asked, sniffing the air. She smelled the lavender oil and walked towards my bedroom before I could stop her. There was my aunt, lying on the bed, waiting for me. Mom screamed. Aunt turned around, grabbed a rug to cover herself, and looked terrified. I rushed to close the main door,
Mom stood there, shocked. She gave me a shy, uncomfortable look but didn‚Äôt say anything. I mumbled something stupid and hid in my room. My aunt got dressed and slipped out quietly. I was so scared, wondering what would happen next.
Since then, Mom hasn‚Äôt mentioned it. She acts like everything is normal‚Äîcooking, talking about her day, smiling at me. But I can‚Äôt stop thinking about what she‚Äôs feeling. Is she okay with it? Is she too shocked to talk? Does she want to pretend it never happened? I love my mom and don‚Äôt want to hurt her. I also love  my aunt, and dont want to stop our relationship
Now, I‚Äôm confused. Should my aunt and I keep going, or should we stop? What if Mom tells Dad or my uncle? I don‚Äôt want to ruin our family, but I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm scared to ask Mom what she thinks, but I can‚Äôt keep acting like nothing‚Äôs wrong

1k3ffn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/peyups/comments/1k3ffn2/upx_how_difficult_is_the_up_experience/,[UPX] How difficult is the UP experience?,"I wrote this as a response to a question in here asking about how difficult UP is compared to other universities. This is a fairly common question for applicants and hopefuls so I just wanted to post it here so that it can serve as a grounding point for those who are anxious, scared, or curious about what UP may have in store for them.

The question: How difficult is UP exactly?

Short answer: It‚Äôs hard to answer accurately because experiences and capacities vary.

Long answer:
The main factor in gauging the difficulty of something is extremely dependent on the capacities of the individual experiencing it.

We discussed a similar version of this question in class: why is it that graduates of UP land better jobs and opportunities than graduates of other universities? Is UP really the main deciding factor that elevates a normal student to a highly favorable job candidate? Hard to answer. We can talk in circles about academic rigor, culture, quality of faculty etc. and compare them to what other universities offer and not really arrive at a conclusion. What we did, however, find is that UP students, especially lately, tend to come from places of privilege that would be more of a factor on their success afterwards.

Although this cannot be applied universally, we do know something to be true: UP as an institution generally only accepts students that have proven themselves capable of handling its academic rigor (either through academics or UPCAT). Given this, it‚Äôs very hard to ask a question of comparative difficulty to people who were technically ‚Äúpicked‚Äù to be able to handle this difficulty.

This can even be applied to courses. How can an economics major who is weak in lit studies accurately gauge the difficulty of the literature course? What the literature major finds easy (because they were picked skills wise to handle that level of difficulty) is wildly different from what the economics major will find easy.

The question I think can be sufficiently answered by two sets of people: people who were not ‚Äúpicked‚Äù to be part of UP (so they can make a judgement on the difficulty they were deemed ‚Äúunqualified‚Äù for) and people who have comparative experience between top universities.

I finished my senior high studies in UST and I‚Äôm currently pursuing my bachelor in UPD. I know that the answer I gave being ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard to gauge‚Äù is not really satisfactory, so I will atleast try to answer the question on comparative difficulty.

Academic rigor:

In my opinion, UPD is much more rigorous than UST was. Professors are stricter and expect a much higher quality output from you. I have had to review essays from my peers in UST that I know would get absolutely mocked by my professors in UPD. Education is mainly self-directed and instruction quality varies widely depending on what professor you get. Since UP allows more freedom for its professors, you can get easy requirements that allow for maximum flexibility or you can get hellish requirements that will require you to read 200 pages per week (don‚Äôt ask me how I know lol).

While UST was much more disrespectful schedule wise (I had classes sometimes from 7am - 7pm) with units per sem averaging at 25-30+, UP will only take about 15-21 units/hours per week in lectures. This is not even considering the fact that a lot of professors nowadays engage in hybrid setups. However, this is a trap. 3 hours of lecture time per week does not mean 3 hours of studying per week per subject. Lecture hours are meant to discuss what you have already studied. It is usually not a space for the professor to actually teach the lesson. To actually survive UP, you have to exert atleast 6 hours minimum per subject per week.

Financial:

This is easy to answer but I felt the need to include it as one of the main difficulties some students have with undergrad studies is the act of financing it. UPD, even back when it had STS, provides a less stressful environment for students on the finance side.

Advising / Support / Academic Breaks:

This is another area where UP, in my opinion, eases difficulties for its students. You have a personal adviser (1:1) that you have to consult every semester on your subjects. In my case, when I was burning out, my adviser even talked to my parents and asked their permission so that I can take a break / LOA.

Re: academic breaks: UP is incredibly lenient. You can drop a subject whenever you want and not be burdened by tuition costs (atleast in the first 5 years).  It is incredibly normal to get the advice to take a semester or a year off to focus on yourself. I have friends in other schools that feel immense pressure from being ‚Äúirregular‚Äù and the option of LOA/AWOL doesn‚Äôt even cross their minds due to university-imposed rules. Here, graduating on time is the fairytale lol. It is more common to find people graduating after 5-8 years. You can even be dismissed and appeal it if your reason is valid enough.

On support: there are so many services during hell week. Kapihan, emotional support animals, free food/coffee, free tutorials on GEs. Outside hell week, you have psychserv which is a dedicated pysch help service for mentally struggling students.

Culture / student body:

I would say it‚Äôs also easier to create a good output given that almost everyone you work with is generally competent. Org culture, while it can be toxic at times, are much more prominent in UP than in other universities I would say. Orgs provide reviewers, notes, reviews on professors, etc., which make the university experience all the more bearable. The culture also allows for a lot of freedom of expression. You can go to your class in pajamas. You can engage in wildly controversial political discussions in legitimate areas of discourse (ex. people can discuss validity of armed struggle in classroom settings / seminars / events without being silenced, etc.)

Enrollment:

This is where UP becomes absolutely stressful for its students. Its premium on flexibility and freedom comes at the cost of units not being guaranteed and students being delayed due to factors beyond their control. Before CRS, students had to physically camp in the campus to get their units. While the system is much more streamlined now, it‚Äôs still a major barrier to graduate. Compare the average enrollment experience of a UP student to a UST student where units are practically guaranteed and you would find that there are enrollment periods that are so unlucky some students just LOA instead.

To sum my personal experience:

UP is substantially harder academics wise. This difficulty is bolstered by enrollment issues. However, it is made easier by a working support systems, the generally competent student body, and the absence of financial burdens.

Everyone is going to have their own opinions based ln what they find difficult and easy in their university experience. You have absolute geniuses in UP like Tiffany Uy who will probably say that it‚Äôs not really difficult. You can have transferees from other universities who suddenly find ease in the UP experience due to the alleviation of tuition responsibilities. The experience of someone who never even got to UP hypothetically experiencing what a UP class is like will also be different. I had an Intl Law class that had a requirement so difficult even a lawyer friend of mine (non-UP grad) could not answer. Comparatively, some GE classes were so easy because the professors were too busy with their research to create assessments lol.

The final answer would have to be, for those hoping to be UP students in the future, something you find out for yourself :))

Sorry this is so long! I hope this answers the question on the difficulty of the UP experience sufficiently. Good luck, future Iskas and Iskos!",14,1745126850.0,peyups,3,1.0,False

I‚Äôm down to 191 from 202. I have saved some recipes, so I can branch out on some of the things I‚Äôm eating, but I feel like this is sustainable and I‚Äôm enjoying it. 

My only backseat worry is that I‚Äôm not getting enough nutrients. If I feel good, and I don‚Äôt have any visible signs of malnutrition, how long is long enough to say I guess I‚Äôm getting enough nutrients based on how I feel and how I look?

Like if I was vitamin deficient or a mineral deficient, when would I start to notice this? Hope my question or worry makes sense. 

Another question related to this is when would be a good time to do a blood test just to check my triglycerides and HDL? 

And finally, anything else I need to watch out for? I‚Äôm a 51 year old male, living in Canada!

Oh, my meals are basically:
Rib eye, eggs, ground beef, chicken, pork, sausages, ground turkey, salmon, other fish,  bone broth, some cheese (hard aged white cheddar, feta, cream cheese), sour cream, and cottage cheese. One coffee with cream in the morning. 2 packets of electrolytes a day. 

I do not eat organs (just can‚Äôt).

1k3f5sc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waiters/comments/1k3f5sc/my_gm_is_already_targeting_me/,My GM is already targeting me,"I just started my new server job. I've worked in many fields, but this is my first restaurant job. From the moment I started, my GM has been micromanaging and finding all types of ways to either scold me for mistakes/write me up for things I wouldn't necessarily know to do. 2nd week there, went to put in some orders, she comes up behind me so close that she accidentally brushed my side to where she had to apologize for being so close. She said, ""Remember to follow those steps of service!"" alluding to the fact that I wasn't running through every section offering to refill waters. I saw her in my section, but when I went to check on them just before she approached me, they said everything was fine and said they were good on their waters. Doubling back after 2 minutes of asking if they wanted water is redundant, but whatever, I'll eat that.

My 1st brunch shift, got a bit frazzled because I forgot one of the tables coffees (we only do brunch on Sundays until 3p, so I'm not as familiar with that menu as I am with dinner menus). I told them I was new and apologized for that mistaks with the coffee. I then went to my GM and asked her for some encouraging words. We go into the office, she just said, ""do your figure eights and follow the steps of service"" following this her encouragement was, ""I could have hired people much more qualified that you, but I liked your confidence!"" (I have a masters degree and getting that seems like a walk in the park compared to talking with this woman.)

Next shift, I close. She wrote me up because I wasn't ""following the steps of service"" I asked her when did I get a verbal warning, she said it was when I asked her for some encouraging words. She also said I didn't close right the night before so she went behind me to make sure I did what I was supposed to do. 

Today, she's not the midshift manager and is in the back doing books and doing tip outs. She comes from the back to the POS as I'm trying to ring in an order again *sigh* to tell me I can't wear leggings, now this is semantics, but it only says that FOH managers can't wear leggings or anything like that, not servers and I told her this. She said that's not right and wanted me to verbally note I understood her. I went to my coworker who was on shift with me, let's call her Nina. Nina was wearing army green cargo pants with a rip in them and a winked work shirt. I asked her if our GM got onto her about that and she said no.

We can only wear dark denim, black pants, slacks, etc., so I don‚Äôt know how that somehow went under the radar for her shift but I was clocked immediately on mine. Another instance of this I witnessed was when another coworker of mine, let's call her Anna, was wearing yoga pants, our company pullover and nikes to match her pullover. GM has been friends with Anna sibce childhood, instead of writing her up/giving her a warning, she goes, ""Oh cool, your shoes match your top."" Then walks away to the patio. Now, we're only supposed to wear black nonslip shoes, but I've witnessed several of my coworkers not adhering to the dress code with no backlash from the GM.

Love the tips, love most of my coworkers, enjoy the environment when she's not around, but I am looking for other work due the unnecessary scrutiny I'm facing when I've witnessed other interactions with better outcomes than mine.",4,1745125747.0,Waiters,2,1.0,False
1k3f5bw,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1k3f5bw/my_father_burns_me_with_his_cigarette_and_i_still/,My father burns me with his cigarette and I still sleeping under the same roof,"Ive been staring at this screen for 20 minutes now. The cursor blinking like a metronome counting the seconds of my hesitation. Its easier to analyze trauma than to admit youre drowning in it. Im writing this from my childhood bedroom. The walls are still pink. My psychology textbooks are stacked on the desk where I once did my high school homework and theres a burn mark on my wrist that wasnt there yesterday

It happened after dinner. Mom had made pot roast, his favorite. Things were almost normal for a while. He was telling stories about work, laughing. He has the most beautiful laugh when he's sober. It rumbles from somewhere deep in his chest and makes his eyes crinkle at the corners. I let myself believe it might be one of the good nights

Then I heard it. The sound of a bottle opening in the kitchen after Mom went to bed. That distinctive crack of the seal breaking. I knew I should stay in my room, but some foolish part of me felt bad thought I could stop it before it started, but rught as I walked in he said ""Just one glass to help me sleep"" His smile still genuine, still my dad. So I sat with him, pretending to watch TV while keeping count. One glass became two. Then three. I saw the slow transformation, his posture loosening, his voice deepening, his eyes beginning to glaze. An hour passed. Mom had long gone to bed. ""Dad, I think I'm going to head to bed,"" I said standing up. ""Maybe you should too?"" but he ignored me while reaching for the bottle again. His hands were slightly unsteady as he poured. That's when I noticed the cigarette pack on the coffee table. He only smokes when he drinks. 

""Dad,"" I said softly, ""maybe that's enough for tonight?"" and I reached for the glass he'd just poured. That was my mistake. His hand grabbed me by my wrist. Not quite painful yet, but a warning. ""You think youre so much smarter than everyone now that youre studying psychology. Do you think you can analyze me? Fix me?"" The cigarette trembled between his fingers, ash dropping onto the floor. I could smell the whiskey on his breath, see the moment his eyes went from recognizing me as his daughter to seeing me as a threat. ""I just wanted to say goodnight"" I whispered. Thats all. But he saw right through me. When he tightened his grip on my wrist, I didnt pull away. Experience has taught me that resistance makes it worse. He moved the cigarette moved toward my skin and I watched with a strange sense of detachment as he pressed it against the inside of my wrist, right where two identical scars already marked the same spot. The pain wasnt immediate. Theres always that split second where your brain hasn't caught up to whats happening. Then it hits, that searing, concentrated agony that radiates outward. The smell comes next. Theres nothing quite like the scent of your own burning flesh. I didn't cry. I never do anymore. Something inside me just... leaves when it happens. I stood there, watching as if it were happening to someone else. ""Now you have something new to analyze"" 

This morning he made pancakes. Apologized without actually saying the words. Patted my shoulder as he passed me in the hallway. Called me ""princess"" like when I was little. And the most devastating part? I felt relief. Relief that he remembered, that he cared, that some part of him knows what hes done. The father I love still exists somewhere inside the monster who burns me

The burn throbs beneath my watch band. I chose this spot deliberately when I got dressed. No one will see it and I'll smile through Easter lunch with my relatives tomorrow, the perfect daughter. Tonight he's sober again, watching TV in the living room. Mom's pretending everything is normal. I'm hiding in my room writing this instead of studying for my exams.

The most gut wrenching part isnt the physical pain. Its that somewhere deep inside, I still believe the father who taught me about music and dreams is the real one. That the monster with the cigarette is the imposter. Even though the evidence on my skin suggests otherwise. I know all the psychological terms for whats happening. I can diagram the cycle of abuse on paper but knowing why youre drowning doesnt teach you how to swim",2,1745125697.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

**Why This Pick?**

These two teams have had a very different season since the All-Star break, friends. Memphis has only won 4 of their last 10 games, and one of those 6 losses was to Oklahoma City by a whopping 21 points. Meanwhile, the Thunder have won 22 of their last 25 outings ‚Äì an insane statistic! These two squads may both be in the NBA, but Oklahoma City is undoubtedly in a league of their own. In addition, the Grizzlies have lost their last 9 straight meetings with the Thunder, and the last 2 by at least 17 points. I say Oklahoma City covers the spread here.

1k3f2gl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nancydrew/comments/1k3f2gl/disappointed_playthrough_notes/,Disappointed Play-through Notes,"Ok let me preface this with; I love Nancy Drew games. I have always tried to go into the new games with an open mind because I think improvement and iteration is not inherently a bad thing! It can be great for rejuvenating a new generation of game. 

But guys. Lordy. This is the first ND game I needed to FORCE myself to finish. It truly felt like a chore. I‚Äôm so sad about it that I wrote down some of the things that popped up to me as ridiculous during my play through. Feel free to read all or nothing lol hopefully it gives you a chuckle, or some validation! 

Keep in mind, everything below is SPOILERS view at your discretion! 


*First hour of gameplay was honing in the Steam deck controls to be at least somewhat intuitive. (I found matching the action buttons to a game like Myst/Riven was simplest but some puzzles were still the pits)

* Why are random slices of bread just lit up in the little street vendor shop? Particularly given that the >! shop meant absolutely NOTHING üò§ like I can‚Äôt even buy a French toasty? I‚Äôm making alll this coffee for no pay and girly can‚Äôt even get her breakfast on? !<

* I love that all anyone talks about is how this barista always puts a pop of cinnamon in their coffee uwu ü•∞ >!and yet what ingredient do we not have as an option? !<

* Ok making THIS many references to the last game is annoying. I get it; the hardy boys burned some pancakes. Move on nance. 

* I‚Äôd love to skip >!the coffee Art.!< Let me do so please. I‚Äôm on steam deck, my hand is CRAMPED. 

* After the first time you >!use the charger, you gotta go pick it up again? How am I not just holding onto this thing???!<

>!* You‚Äôre telling me the books in the bookcase I‚Äôm supposed to notice are the ones WITHOUT titles on the spine? And we have this many books, and you made the puzzle the SECTION titles? Boring. !<

>!* So you have a mechanism where sometimes it‚Äôs day time and sometimes it‚Äôs nighttime. And gave us the clue that the haunted tour is at night. But instead of letting us wander over organically while it‚Äôs nighttime in game with some type of alarm clock system like the old games, we‚Äôre supposed to know specifically to just click the sign?? Dumb. !<

>!* God forbid I want to talk to my client again to review previous talking points. Why‚Äôd the make everyone in Prague so rude?!<

>!* So we don‚Äôt ever say things like ‚Äúhmm I wonder what Ned thinks about this.‚Äù The game just wants us to always be checking our text messages on the off chance Nancy wrote but didn‚Äôt send a whole message to her boyfriend that is required conversation to propel the plot?? The ‚Äúhopelessly meandering‚Äù in this game is relentless because of these weird choices. !<

>!* Ok so I solve the alchemy room, go on a walkabout, and now random entryways are open, into deeper dungeons with skeletons in cages? I didn‚Äôt hit a lever or anything. I didn‚Äôt unlock anything? I‚Äôm just in a high stakes music cue moment now, and apparently running?!<

>!* I text Ned, ‚ÄúAfter I was chased by a knight‚Äù what knight??? No cutscene on a knight. No visual of someone even chasing me. I didn‚Äôt know WHO chased me, I was just chased!!! Kind of!!!!<

>!* We get off the phone with Adela and start texting Ned (accurate, I text my husband my every thought and conversation lol he‚Äôs my bestie) but we go ‚Äúand Adela wants us to steal the keys that bitch‚Äù (paraphrase) Adela said nothing about the keys!!! When did she even say that, Nance?!<

>!* Every single puzzle from the alchemy box in the antique store on was a game of hovering your mouse until something was clickable. There was no problem solving, you just had to look at the right place for the right thing. Here are examples of those:!<
    >!* the alchemy box!<
    >!* The TRACKER omg what WAS THAT why did the beeping just STOP once you hit all the above ground spots. How did it not just be a loud buzz. !<
    >!* The antidote concoction (how was this not a little recipe book we got way earlier in the game that we had to fall back on. The villain just luckily left out the antidote recipe??)!<
    >!* The order of key clicks after correct placement into locks(I believe the order you click them is in the alchemists journal? But by that point I‚Äôd already ditched the journal at the antique store and hadn‚Äôt written it down so I was screwed)!<
  >!  * The gems puzzle (that Green placement was CRIMINAL) !<
    >!* The candles being a timed challenge randomly? With no indication !<

* The only satisfying puzzle to me in this whole game was >!the gem artifact. How were there no coded cypher puzzles? No puzzles that mimic the idea of translating from one language to another?

**Trigonelline is a plant alkaloid found in coffee and fenugreek.** It is gaining traction for its potential to support muscle health, endurance, cardiovascular function, energy, cognition, and metabolic function.¬† It hasn‚Äôt been commercially available in raw form until recently.¬†

Trigonelline is a powerhouse that aids in muscle growth and muscular endurance. It is a precursor to NAD+, which has a host of benefits including increases mitochondrial function and providing a clean boost of energy and increased cognition.¬†

# Nestl√©'s Trigonelline Study

A 2024 study published in¬†Nature Metabolism, conducted by researchers from EPFL in collaboration with the Nestl√© Institute of Health Sciences identifies Trigonelline as a novel precursor to NAD+, a critical molecule for cellular energy production.¬†

Trigonelline is the only known NAD+ precursor able to affect muscular NAD+ levels. This unique effect makes Trigonelline especially promising for improving muscle strength, endurance, and recovery \[1\]\[2\].

**Why Trigonelline Matters for Active Individuals and Biohackers**

Whether you‚Äôre an endurance runner, strength trainer, weekend warrior, or wanting to optimize the way your body ages, optimal mitochondrial function is critical to sustained performance and cognition. Trigonelline offers a natural approach to support that function, helping you:

* Increase muscular endurance
* Reduce exercise-induced fatigue
* Improve post-workout recovery
* Maintain muscle strength as you age

As part of a balanced regimen that includes proper nutrition, sleep, and training, Trigonelline supplementation could offer a novel edge for athletes looking to maximize their physical output \[1\]\[2\].

# How Trigonelline Works: Mechanisms of Action

The key mechanism behind Trigonelline‚Äôs benefits lies in its ability to elevate NAD+ levels. NAD+ fuels essential metabolic pathways that maintain cellular energy, particularly within mitochondria. By boosting NAD+ availability, Trigonelline promotes better mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis. These enhancements translate to more efficient energy production in muscle cells, reduced fatigue, and potentially faster recovery after physical exertion \[1\].

# Trigonelline's Impact on Muscle Strength and Endurance

A 2024 study published in¬†Nature Metabolism¬†explored how Trigonelline affects muscle function during aging. The researchers found that dietary Trigonelline supplementation increased NAD+ levels in muscle tissue, leading to enhanced mitochondrial function, improved endurance, and greater muscle strength in preclinical models. This indicates that Trigonelline may offer protection against age-related muscle decline and fatigue, making it a promising supplement for both older adults and active individuals looking to optimize muscle performance \[1\].

# Trigonelline as a Natural Ally for Muscle Performance

Research supported by Nestl√© and its scientific partners sheds light on Trigonelline‚Äôs potential to enhance muscular energy and strength through NAD+ biosynthesis. These early findings are exciting for athletes and aging adults alike, pointing to a natural compound that may help maintain strength, delay fatigue, and promote better long-term muscle health. As always, speak with a healthcare provider before adding any new supplement to your routine‚Äîespecially if you're managing a medical condition or currently taking medications.

1k3eteh,https://www.reddit.com/r/mortalislabs/comments/1k3eteh/what_is_trigonelline/,What is Trigonelline?,"# Why Trigonelline Is the Molecule Athletes Should Be Watching

**Trigonelline is a methylated form of niacin and is a recently isolated molecule that could be the secret ingredient in your stack.** This form of the B vitamin is involved in the generation of NAD+, a cofactor for over 500 metabolic processes in cells. Trigonelline promotes cellular repair and energy, and as we‚Äôll see, exerts quite a few benefits that are specifically useful for anyone training seriously.

Trigonelline is found in several plant-based foods, notably coffee beans and fenugreek seeds. Green coffee beans contain trigonelline concentrations ranging from 0.6% to 1.0% by weight. However, traditional dietary sources don‚Äôt provide sufficient amounts to elicit significant physiological effects. For instance, the average trigonelline content in a cup of coffee is approximately 53 mg, and about 50-80% of trigonelline decomposes during the roasting process, leaving virtually nothing for your body to make use of.

Recent research published on this naturally occurring alkaloid highlights its potential in enhancing muscle function and combating age-related decline. A 2024 study published in Nature Metabolism identified trigonelline as a novel precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a molecule essential for energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. The study demonstrated that [trigonelline supplementation improved muscle strength and reduced fatigue in aged mice](https://mortalislabs.com/products/trigonelline-supplement), suggesting that it can head off the natural muscle decline seen in aging, even in those who are already training at capacity.

# The Real NAD+ Level Up for Athletes

NAD+ gets discussed a lot in the longevity space because of its natural and steep decline over the years, tied to all the diseases of aging. It's a metabolic linchpin that determines how efficiently your cells convert fuel into usable energy. For athletes, that efficiency translates into faster recovery, better performance under load, and greater resilience under metabolic stress. Or, you know, complete lack of those things if you don‚Äôt have enough of it.

NAD+ is required for redox (oxidation‚Äìreduction) reactions in mitochondrial energy production and is a cofactor and substrate for longevity-promoting sirtuins and other enzymes involved in muscle repair and adaptation. During intense physical activity, NAD+ levels drop as demand for ATP surges. Replenishing intracellular NAD+ is critical not only for restoring mitochondrial output but also for initiating the cellular programs that rebuild and reinforce muscle tissue \[1\].

Trigonelline offers a direct path to NAD+‚Äîone that bypasses the liver and supports muscle tissue specifically. In a landmark 2024 study, researchers at EPFL and Nestl√© Health Sciences (yes,¬†*that*¬†Nestl√©, but there aren‚Äôt any conflicts of interest, we checked) demonstrated that trigonelline functions as a previously unidentified NAD+ precursor, rapidly taken up by skeletal muscle cells and converted into NAD+ via a salvage pathway independent of the traditional NR or NMN routes \[2\]. This muscle-specific uptake is particularly important for athletes, who require localized replenishment in the very tissues under stress.

Most NAD+ precursors‚Äîincluding nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN)‚Äîundergo hepatic metabolism before entering systemic circulation. This creates a bottleneck at your liver for targeted muscle repair. Trigonelline appears to bypass that constraint by delivering precursors directly where they're needed most: the muscle fibers responsible for performance and endurance.

This shift in delivery has implications beyond simple NAD+ restoration. In the same¬†*Nature Metabolism*¬†study, aged mice supplemented with trigonelline showed significant improvements in grip strength and fatigue resistance‚Äîoutcomes tightly linked to muscle NAD+ availability. Unlike systemic precursors that may elevate circulating NAD+ levels without improving localized bioenergetics, trigonelline drives changes in muscle mitochondrial density and function.

For athletes, this is the difference between feeling recovered and actually being rebuilt.

# Mitochondria Make Muscles Move

# Endurance Starts in the Electron Transport Chain

Every sprint, every lift, every set depends on one thing: mitochondrial output. The ability to generate ATP on demand‚Äîefficiently and cleanly‚Äîis the defining line between sustained power and early fatigue. Trigonelline‚Äôs value lies not just in elevating NAD+ levels, but in what that elevation enables at the level of mitochondrial performance.

NAD+ drives oxidative phosphorylation, the mitochondrial pathway responsible for converting nutrients into ATP. When NAD+ is depleted, electron transport slows, reactive oxygen species accumulate, and mitochondrial output tanks‚Äîresulting in performance collapse and prolonged recovery. Replenishing NAD+ restores mitochondrial throughput, enhances metabolic flexibility, and allows cells to switch between carbohydrate and fat oxidation with minimal friction \[3\].

Trigonelline‚Äôs role as a direct NAD+ precursor in muscle tissue makes it especially powerful in this context. By bypassing hepatic metabolism and restoring NAD+ where it's most needed, it kickstarts mitochondrial biogenesis‚Äîactivating pathways like PGC-1Œ± that drive the formation of new mitochondria and increase the efficiency of existing ones \[4\]. This isn‚Äôt theoretical: in the 2024¬†*Nature Metabolism*¬†study, trigonelline supplementation significantly boosted mitochondrial content and activity in aged mice, restoring performance metrics typically lost with age and overtraining \[2\].

This cellular shift translates directly to the field, the track, and the gym. More mitochondria means more ATP per unit of oxygen consumed. This is the underpinning of higher VO‚ÇÇ max, improved lactate clearance, and extended time-to-exhaustion. Trigonelline supports this adaptation at the source, which means athletes can train harder, go longer, and bounce back faster‚Äîwithout relying on stimulants or sketchy ergogenics.

More NAD+ in muscle equals better mitochondrial kinetics, which equals better athletic output. Period.

# Strength and Muscle Health

# Preserving Power, Not Just Mass

Strength isn‚Äôt only about size‚Äîit‚Äôs about contractile quality, neuromuscular precision, and the cellular capacity to resist breakdown under stress. Trigonelline‚Äôs impact on muscle tissue reaches beyond endurance. It supports structural integrity, performance output, and resilience across multiple pathways‚Äîespecially in the context of aging or chronic training demand.

In the 2024¬†*Nature Metabolism*¬†study, trigonelline supplementation restored muscle grip strength and improved fatigue resistance in aged mice, with outcomes exceeding those observed in control groups receiving traditional NAD+ precursors \[2\]. This effect was tied to increased NAD+ availability in skeletal muscle, which reactivated SIRT1- and PGC-1Œ±-dependent pathways responsible for mitochondrial biogenesis, inflammation control, and protein maintenance‚Äîall critical for contractile performance and mass preservation \[5\].

NAD+ also plays a protective role against muscle wasting. It regulates the balance between anabolic and catabolic signaling, modulating FoxO transcription factors and suppressing atrophy-related genes like¬†*MuRF1*¬†and¬†*atrogin-1*¬†\[6\]. This anti-catabolic signaling becomes especially important during periods of calorie deficit, illness, or overreaching, when muscle degradation accelerates. Trigonelline, by supplying NAD+ directly to muscle cells, may help maintain lean mass even under systemic stress.

One overlooked aspect of muscle performance is neuromuscular junction (NMJ) stability, or, the connections between nerves and muscle fibers. These connections go both ways, with afferent signals carrying sensory feedback from muscle to brain, and efferent signals delivering motor commands from brain to muscle. Maintaining the integrity of this bidirectional communication is essential for coordination, strength, and rapid recovery from fatigue. NAD+ is required for the function of enzymes that protect NMJ architecture‚Äîparticularly in aging or disease models where synaptic decline contributes to strength loss \[7\]. Trigonelline‚Äôs direct muscle delivery may therefore preserve the electrical signaling fidelity needed for explosive power and motor unit recruitment.

# Muscle Fiber Type Preservation

Emerging evidence suggests that NAD+ availability influences muscle fiber type composition. High NAD+ levels favor the maintenance of fast-twitch (Type II) fibers‚Äîthose responsible for strength, speed, and power‚Äîby enhancing mitochondrial support without triggering full transition to slow-twitch oxidative profiles \[8\]. This has implications for athletes seeking to maintain peak force output without compromising endurance. By elevating muscle NAD+ directly, trigonelline may help preserve this delicate fiber balance.

Trigonelline is formulated not to just support general energy‚Äîbut to protect the architecture of athleticism at the cellular level.

# Breathing and VO‚ÇÇ Max

# Cellular Efficiency Becomes Cardiovascular Edge

Most performance metrics‚ÄîVO‚ÇÇ max, lactate threshold, oxygen pulse‚Äîare measured at the level of the lungs, blood, and heart. But the real bottleneck for oxygen utilization doesn‚Äôt start in the chest. It starts in the mitochondria. Trigonelline supports athletic breathing capacity not by altering the respiratory system directly, but by optimizing the cellular machinery that determines how efficiently oxygen is used once it arrives.

Mitochondrial efficiency is the central variable in VO‚ÇÇ max‚Äîthe maximum rate at which the body can use oxygen during exercise. NAD+ has direct role in this equation by enabling electron transfer through Complex I of the electron transport chain, which drives ATP synthesis from aerobic metabolism \[9\]. When NAD+ is depleted, this throughput breaks down. That leads to a reliance on anaerobic pathways, quicker lactate buildup, and faster fatigue.

Trigonelline restores NAD+ levels specifically in muscle tissue, where the oxygen is being delivered and consumed. This translates to improved mitochondrial respiration and delayed onset of anaerobic metabolism. In aged mice, trigonelline supplementation preserved muscle oxygenation capacity and enhanced mitochondrial density‚Äîfactors tightly linked with increased VO‚ÇÇ max and muscular endurance \[2\].

Indirectly, this affects respiratory performance. When skeletal muscles become more efficient at oxygen uptake and ATP production, the entire cardiorespiratory system adapts:

* Heart rate at submaximal workloads drops
* Pulmonary ventilation is reduced for the same output
* Lactate threshold rises, allowing sustained efforts at higher intensities

Although no direct studies have yet measured trigonelline's effect on VO‚ÇÇ max in humans, the mechanistic link is strong. Increased muscle NAD+ availability and mitochondrial optimization have already been shown to shift oxygen kinetics and improve aerobic performance in studies using other NAD+ precursors \[10\].

Trigonelline focuses on cellular oxygen utilization‚Äîwhere true endurance begins.

# Recovery, Inflammation, and Resilience

# Rebuild the System‚ÄîDon‚Äôt Just Rest It

Recovery is not passive. It‚Äôs a high-demand physiological process that rebuilds tissue, regulates inflammation, restores neurotransmitter balance, and recharges the nervous system. Trigonelline addresses this phase of performance with precision‚Äîby supporting NAD+ regeneration in both muscle and brain tissue, where fatigue and dysfunction accumulate fastest.

Emerging data point to trigonelline‚Äôs ability to elevate NAD+ in the brain‚Äînot just the periphery. In the 2024¬†*Nature Metabolism*¬†study, oral trigonelline was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of treated mice, suggesting central nervous system penetration \[11\]. This is important because brain NAD+ availability influences neuroinflammation, cognitive performance, and mental fatigue‚Äîall of which degrade physical output and recovery when compromised.

NAD+ is essential for the activity of sirtuins and PARPs that modulate neuroinflammation and neuronal repair. Low brain NAD+ levels are associated with microglial activation and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-Œ± and IL-6 \[11\]. By supplying a precursor that crosses the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, trigonelline may support CNS recovery in a way other NAD+ precursors cannot. This means lower perceived fatigue, better focus, and faster return to training intensity after neurologically demanding sessions. It isn‚Äôt a masking effect or a stimulant ‚Äì trigonelline is supplying cells with the necessary fuel to recover faster and perform better under greater demand.

Athletic inflammation isn't pathological‚Äîit‚Äôs functional. But poor resolution of inflammation post-training leads to longer recovery windows, greater risk of overtraining, and diminished adaptations. Trigonelline, by enhancing intracellular NAD+ pools, may support the regulation of key inflammatory mediators including NF-Œ∫B, IL-1Œ≤, and IL-6 through sirtuin activation and mitochondrial repair pathways \[12\]. These effects contribute to resilience‚Äîboth in terms of immune readiness and tissue regeneration.

Trigonelline builds biological capacity to recover harder and faster than you ever thought possible.

# Who Should Use Trigonelline (and Why They‚Äôll Never Go Back)

# From Peak Performers to Tactical Operators‚ÄîTrigonelline Redefines the Edge

Trigonelline is not a casual supplement. It's engineered for those operating at the threshold‚Äîwhere performance, precision, and recovery can‚Äôt be compromised. Whether you‚Äôre chasing podiums, pushing PRs, or preparing for missions, the need is the same: sustained mitochondrial output, fast-twitch preservation, and nervous system resilience under pressure.

# Endurance Athletes ‚Äì Runners, Cyclists, Triathletes

These athletes operate in the oxidative zone. VO‚ÇÇ max, lactate threshold, and mitochondrial density determine race-day results and mission-critical outcomes. Trigonelline enhances muscle oxygen use by restoring NAD+ where it matters: inside the muscle cell \[2\]. That means fewer crashes, faster splits, and greater metabolic flexibility when switching between fat and carb fuel systems. It's a molecular upgrade to the aerobic engine.

# Strength-Focused Lifters ‚Äì Clean Gains, Maximum Output

Muscle isn‚Äôt just about mass‚Äîit‚Äôs about fiber quality, contractility, and neuromuscular firing. Trigonelline supports Type II fiber preservation, anabolic signaling, and ATP availability under load \[2\]. Unlike pre-workouts that spike and crash, this is foundational fuel replenishment‚Äîrestoring the internal chemistry that allows progressive overload to translate into real strength gains.

# Older Athletes ‚Äì Keeping Output High Without Compromise

Aging athletes face the double burden of recovery slowdowns and mitochondrial decline. Trigonelline addresses both. It ramps up mitochondrial biogenesis, supports neuromuscular junction integrity, and suppresses muscle wasting signals‚Äîhelping maintain strength, speed, and stamina long past the age most competitors tap out \[2\].

# Tactical Professionals ‚Äì Military, First Responders, Elite Operators

Physical fitness is mission-critical in high-stress, high-stakes environments. Trigonelline doesn‚Äôt just support output‚Äîit buffers the system against inflammatory cascades, central fatigue, and energy collapse. When your recovery window is short and your next task is already loading, you don‚Äôt need hype. You need molecular readiness.

Trigonelline isn‚Äôt for weekend warriors. It‚Äôs for athletes serious about capacity, adaptation, and longevity in high-performance domains. Once your cells experience what targeted NAD+ replenishment actually feels like, there‚Äôs no going back.

# The Future of Natural Performance Enhancement Is Molecular

Performance isn't fueled by macros alone. It‚Äôs driven by the molecules that dictate how cells generate energy, repair damage, and resist fatigue under stress. Trigonelline is a signal molecule‚Äîone that tells your body to build more mitochondria, recover faster, and keep power output high even under pressure. It‚Äôs not hype. It‚Äôs molecular physiology, applied with precision.

Mortalis Labs isolates what nature only hints at and delivers it in a form your biology can immediately use. Trigonelline isn‚Äôt about stacking stimulants or chasing short-term pumps. It‚Äôs about equipping your cells with the precursors they need to function like you‚Äôre still in your prime‚Äîand then some.

If your protocol is still built around protein percentages and caffeine timing, it‚Äôs time to rethink what performance support actually means. Upgrade to molecular interventions that don‚Äôt just fill gaps‚Äîthey redefine baselines.

You‚Äôve optimized your training. Now optimize your metabolism. [Mortalis Labs](https://mortalislabs.com) makes that possible.

There's a road that crosses it at the northern edge of the property and this morning when I went outside I was greeted by the sound of it's 18 inch culvert flowing at near maximum capacity. I took my second eldest out with me to explore the perimeter and check out the culvert. It's quite the spectacle to see roughly five acres being flooded with several feet of water in just a few short hours. I let him start riding the onewheel by himself since he's the only one heavy enough to activate the sensors to make it go. By the end of the day he had used up a full charge which is around 6-8 miles. Also built the first campfire of the season and had some delicious perked coffee. All that to say I continue to be more and more impressed with this weathershield. Probably about half an hour of constant submersion in icy water and never felt wet.

1k3esmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1k3esmr/day_61_had_some_decaf/,Day 61 - had some decaf,"Wanted to share my experience: 

So I am Day 61 today since quitting caffeine. I have had a couple of moments on holiday where I have accidentally had some Pepsi or a chocolate muffin during this time without realising until after, but I have not touched a full blown cup of coffee. When I had a few sips of Pepsi I felt my eye balls POUNDING. It was the reason I realised it had caffeine in it. 

As for my experience, I have felt some great affects, my sleep has been so much deeper, I would wake up at 3am in the first month and be awake sometimes for up to an hour until falling back asleep. By about Week 5 - 6 I noticed the change of sleep and even though I'd wake up sometimes at 3am I'd go right back to sleep. Last night I slept through the entire night and it was amazing. My skin looks great and brighter and hydrated. And I have noticed my anxiety levels drop a lot. Like from 10/10 to a 
3-4/10. 

Now, I have tried some decaf a few days ago to see how I felt and I had such an annoying headache I had to take Panadol which I rarely take. Then today I had a very small decaf, at a cafe to observe how I felt and again the same thing happened. Had to take Panadol because the headache. It makes me feel almost irritated too? But the headache and energy level crash are two things that i have felt the most intense and it almost makes me feel like when you're getting sick with a cold. I love cafes so much but I can't even stand this feeling because it's been hours since and I still feel so tired and my head hurts. It was an interesting observation and I don't think it will set me back because I'm not one of those people who goes right back after a bit of caffeine. I knew going in to it that I wanted to observe my body and it was so interesting but equally eye opening because this cup was SMALL. Like barely fit in my hand. So yeah, just wanted to share my experience because i am convinced even decaf sucks and for me not even worth it!

Even the on-board catering on the Albury VLocity leaves much to be desired. 

What work-arounds could there be? Probably from most expensive to cheapest (or, hardest to implement to easiest), options could be:
- Build new trailer cars that have a buffet module, and put them into the existing sets to make 4‚Äìcar carriages. These sets would be captive fleet for long distance services. 
- Find space on-board to keep a catering trolley and enough stock to replenish it. Would probably have to be in the first and last cars: you wouldn‚Äôt want to be at one end of the train and have to wheel it all the way back to the other between stops. Would you have to change the EBA for the conductors for this too?
- Find space on-board to install vending machines. Would be nice to have hot and cold drinks, and snacks. Would probably take away some seats. 
- Catering at select stations, requiring the train to stop long enough so people have time to get off and purchase what they need for the onward journey. 

The last one is probably the easiest to implement. For long distance services, make extended stops at stations already with cafes and shops on or close to the station: 
- Traralgon for Bairnsdale trains, 
- Seymour for Shepparton trains, 
- Bendigo for Swan Hill and Echuca trains, 
- Ballarat for Ararat and Maryborough trains, 
- Geelong for Warrnambool trains. 

Opening hours for the cafes etc would need to align to the train service, or you could supplement them with on-platform vending machines. 

You would stop for 10-15 minutes to allow enough time for folks to buy their coffee and snacks in the station. It‚Äôs a trade-off: some will be happy they have a chance to buy food, others will be grumpy that their train is stopped for 10 minutes and making their journey longer. 

I‚Äôm only an occasional long distance traveller but I wouldn‚Äôt mind if the train stopped for 10 minutes mid-journey so I can stretch my legs and get a coffee. My end-to-end journey is 3-4 hours anyway so a 10-minute, even 15, impost for refreshments I‚Äôd be willing to accept!

I showed him and he said something like ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs just song lyrics and means nothing‚Äù we went back and forth on this, don‚Äôt fully remember what was said but ultimately I just let it go. 

I went back to work the next day, and for the next few days me and him would argue about Angela almost everyday, the only times we didn‚Äôt argue is when we would ignore each other which was done 90% of the time. I know this was childish of us to do but I was mad at him and just didn‚Äôt feel ready to try and repair things, getting a divorce or separating also felt extreme at the time as I had no evidence of him cheating, and it was just a theory. 

Work was honestly like an escape as I had my friends/coworkers there and was able to just be away. for reference I worked at a small independently owned office as a receptionist, I‚Äôve worked there for 5 years and it was my favorite job, our boss was great, pay was good, I had friends there and benefits were amazing and despite occasionally being yelled at over the phone, It was honestly the best job I‚Äôve ever worked at. Then randomly at work we started to get prank calls, now it‚Äôs not totally unusual but these ones would happen everyday, it would usually be someone just screaming and then hanging up. We were instructed to wait for the other person to speak first during this. 

After a few days these prank calls did stop but we kept getting calls from different people asking to talk to our boss, which was odd because rarely would we get this request, this happened multiple times a day for a few days. My boss usually sends these calls to voice mail as he‚Äôs busy so few days later I‚Äôm about to leave when he asks if I can stay for a bit and talk to him in his office. I did and this is where he showed me the voice mails and asked if I knew these people, they were all complaints about me. I didn‚Äôt recognize any of the voices so I said no. My boss assumed these weren‚Äôt real but to try and find out who these people might be, because of this when someone would call and ask to talk to our boss we had to ask for a phone number and name. Some would provide it, some wouldn‚Äôt. 

Eventually this would happen  every single hour and again all complaints about me, my boss decided to just send me home for a few days to see if the calls would end which they didn‚Äôt.  A few days turned into a week and then I got a call and was fired. 

From what my coworkers told me the calls continued and my boss was just sick of it as he would have to call back each time and decided it was just easier to fire me. I suspect this was Angela and her friends doing this to try to get me fired and they succeeded. 

During the week I was home, it was driving me crazy as sometimes I would have to be home with my husband and all I wanted to do was just argue, though no issues until I caught him stalking Angela‚Äôs Instagram, he would sleep on the couch and I would sleep in the room, I caught him when I saw him on his phone from the hallway. 

I honestly was just tired from it all so I did blow up at him, his excuse was he just wanted to check up on her. When I told him I was fired and that I suspected it was Angela he basically called me crazy and  said she would never do anything like that. 

I was so drained that I didn‚Äôt even argue, in fact I didn‚Äôt even talk to him anymore, which is probably why he felt it was okay to come home late one night, drunk with faded lipstick on and glitter, we had another argument and he left. He didn‚Äôt come back for days and sent flowers and my favorite food to me with a note that said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I love you.‚Äù 

He came home later that day and he looked pretty distraught and wanted to explain, I let him. His reasoning was that he felt awful about how our relationship was and needed to de-stress from it, he went out with a few friends for drinks and some girl kissed him and was dancing up on him, he said he rejected her immediately and felt disgusted. I don‚Äôt know if I believe that still. I asked about Angela and if he was still talking to her to which he said no but she did reach out a few times and he did see her once. 

I asked if they ever slept with each other and he said no but she kissed him and he rejected her. I asked a whole bunch of other questions about our relationship and some of the answers did hurt. I told him I wanted to separate just for a little bit, he broke down crying and begged me not to leave him, I apologized and packed most of my things as he was on his knees next to me apologizing. 

I ignored him and left. For the last 2 weeks I‚Äôve been at my parents house, I finally told them what happened and they despise him. He‚Äôs been up here almost daily trying to talk to me and my parents refuse to let him see me (my parents live in the next town over).He‚Äôs sent me food, flowers, gift cards, literally anything you can DoorDash, he‚Äôs sent. I‚Äôve gotten spam calls and messages from him, and I‚Äôve blocked him. Yet he‚Äôs gotten his family and some of my distant relatives to do the same. 

Honestly I‚Äôm tired of him and have begged him to stop trying to contact me, obviously hasn‚Äôt worked much. For my next moves I am thinking of divorce but I‚Äôm just not ready yet, none of this feels real, I just need to take time and heal a little before making that decision, I have a feeling divorce is going to be hard so I just can‚Äôt handle that yet or another option is therapy and try to reconcile. I‚Äôm currently trying to find a job in my parents town, and I plan to stay here for a while until I‚Äôm able to move on fully. Also I know I didn‚Äôt talk about her much but as for Angela I have no idea if he‚Äôs talking to her still or anything about her and I want to keep it that way. I don‚Äôt think there is going to be another update since our relationship is pretty much over, thank you to those who checked up on me and commented advice I‚Äôm forever grateful.

1k3engh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k3engh/how_can_i_get_myself_out_of_this_social_rute_i/,How can I get myself out of this social rute I have gotten myself into?,"Hey guys, I was hoping to get some advice on how I(23 year old, male) can potentially improve my social life.

I have gotten to a point where I can say I don't have any friends anymore. The only people I really interact with on a daily basis are my co-workers who I don't really talk to outside of work. I still am fairly close with my immediate family but they live several hours away and I feel like there is a large portion of my life that I can't share with them just to keep the peace. I don't think it is a very healthy way to maintain a relationship but I am afraid that if I ever did really open up I would lose the only people that I still feel close to. Then I would really be alone.

There are a lot of things I cant talk to my parents about and many of them stem from religion. I come from a very religious Mormon family but I personally am not. I don't think I have ever told my parents the way I feel about it but I never did go on a mission(A requirement of the church for men at age 18) and they know I don't go to church unless I am visiting them. I don't have any issue with my family believing in what they do but I always feel like I am walking on eggshells. There are just so many rules and even if they found out I drink coffee they would be upset. I know I need to set some better boundaries but I don't feel like I have any other support group I can lean on.

This wasn't always the case either. I used to have a pretty good friend group when I was in highschool but things changed after I graduated in 2020. I slowly lost all of my close friends and failed to make any new ones. As I started to get more and more isolated I began to get more and more anxious. Last year it definitely was at its worst. I had gotten to a point where I was rarely leaving the house, and I was so anxious that I started losing weight, patches of hair were falling out, and I was shaking constantly. Luckily my parents intervened and my dad helped me to fill out some job applications. I also went to the doctor who gave me some medicine to help me calm down. Since getting my current job I have felt a lot better but not very consistently. I developed a very specific phobia of writing in front of people because I will start to shake so bad that I can't do it. This hasn't helped me make any friends and any time I try to talk to new people I'm like a deer in the headlights. I feel like everytime I talk to someone it comes across as so awkward and maybe even creepy at times. I just feel stuck and really want to be able to be comfortable around people again.

I would like to get to a point where I could have a few close friends and maybe even a girlfriend. I have never had a significant other and that hasn't done wonders for my self esteem. At the moment it just feels so out of reach. I am continuing to work on myself though and maybe someday I will be able to do it. I don't really have anyone else to talk to about this sort of thing so any advice would be greatly appreciated!

1k3elt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k3elt8/aita_for_changing_all_my_roommates_contact_names/,AITA for changing all my roommate‚Äôs contact names to ‚ÄúCake Vulture‚Äù after she ate my birthday cake?,"So I (26F) have live with my roommate Sarah (25F) for about two years now. We weren‚Äôt best friends or anything but we got along okay at first. The problem is she‚Äôs been stealing my food from the fridge since day one. Not just taking a bite of something - I‚Äôm talking about eating entire meals I prepped for the week.

I‚Äôve tried everything  labels with my name, separate shelves, those plastic containers with locks, polite conversations, angry conversations, even a roommate meeting with our third roommate as mediator. Nothing works. She always has some excuse like ‚ÄúI thought it was leftovers anyone could eat‚Äù or ‚ÄúI was going to replace it (she never does).
Last week was my birthday. My mom sent me a homemade chocolate cake that she knows I love - its our special family recipe and honestly the one thing I was looking forward to after a shitty week at work. I put it in the fridge with a note saying ‚ÄúEMMA‚ÄôS BIRTHDAY CAKE - DO NOT EAT‚Äù and went out with friends.

I got home and guess what? Half the cake was gone. Sarah left a sticky note saying ‚ÄúHappy birthday! Hope you don‚Äôt mind I had a slice. It was amazing!‚Äù
It wasn‚Äôt a slice. It was HALF THE CAKE.

I lost it. While she was at work, I changed her contact name to ‚ÄúCake Vulture‚Äù in our third roommate‚Äôs phone. Then I texted all her friends in our social circle (we have mutual friends asking if they could update her contact to Cake Vulture as a funny prank. Most of them did it because they know about her food stealing habits.

For a week, everyone who texted her got ‚ÄúCake Vulture is typing‚Ä¶‚Äù and it spread through our friend group.   She came home crying saying I humiliated her and now everyone‚Äôs making food stealing jokes in the group chat.

I thought it was justified until she revealed she‚Äôs been struggling with an eating disorder and sometimes has episodes where she binge eats. She never told me this before.  Now our friends are divided - some think I went too far with public humiliation, others think she should have told me about her ED instead of repeatedly stealing my food.

Now she‚Äôs threatening to move out and our third roommate thinks im ‚Äúsuper bitchy‚Äù for not handling it privately. I still feel like after two years of stolen food and trying to talk to her like an adult, she pushed me too far. But now they got me wondering if I really crashed out over a stupid cake. The apartment is giving high school cafeteria vibes - they literally stop talking when I walk into a room and I‚Äôve caught them exchanging looks over their coffee mugs every morning. Our third roommate has totally taken Sarah‚Äôs side and keeps leaving those passive-aggressive sticky notes on everything I own. Yesterday I found one on my shampoo saying ‚Äúsharing is caring :)‚Äù which is rich coming from someone defending a cake thief. It‚Äôs been three days of them whispering behind closed doors and suddenly going silent when I‚Äôm around. I‚Äôm basically paying rent to feel unwelcome in my own home.
AITA?

[edit: paragraph breaks for readability]

EDIT: A lot of people are asking if Sarah steals our third roommate Jess‚Äôs food too. The answer is no - at least not that I‚Äôve seen. They‚Äôve been friends since freshman year and Jess actually encouraged Sarah to move in with us when our previous roommate left. I think that‚Äôs partly why Jess is taking her side in this whole thing.

Jess and Sarah have this weird arrangement where they ‚Äúshare‚Äù certain groceries (they go shopping together sometimes) but Jess never touches my stuff. I‚Äôve asked Jess about it and she just shrugged and said ‚ÄúSarah‚Äôs going through some stuff right now‚Äù and that I should be more understanding. 

When I pointed out that Sarah had TWO YEARS to tell me about her eating disorder instead of just repeatedly stealing my food, Jess got all defensive and said some people have trouble talking about personal issues. Which is fine, but like‚Ä¶ that doesn‚Äôt give you the right to take other people‚Äôs stuff?? Especially when I‚Äôve confronted her about it multiple times??

The most frustrating part is that Sarah has never stolen anything expensive or irreplaceable - just food. And always MY food, never Jess‚Äôs. So it feels like she knows exactly what she‚Äôs doing and who she can get away with stealing from. That‚Äôs why the ‚ÄúCake Vulture‚Äù thing felt justified at the time, but now I‚Äôm stuck in this awkward apartment situation where I‚Äôm the bad guy for finally standing up for myself.",202,1745123612.0,AmItheAsshole,79,0.93,False

*‚ÄùAwww, Crystal, you can do it!‚Äù the voice of the person behind the camera says between chortles of delight.

My plan for full fast (drinking water, plain tea, black coffee) is to last eat at 6 pm Friday, full fast on Sat, and then break fast around 10 am in Sunday, so fasting for 40 hours. 

Does this sound like a good plan? What is the expected energy level on full fast day?
Can I still do 'normal' activities? I read that I will feel 'more energetic'. How true is this?

S the Most Unexpected and Addictive Love Story You‚Äôll Read?,"A bigger dilemma of my life happened when my gay best friend unintentionally turned me on at a 'randoms' pool party. Up until that point, I'd never had the urge to do a guy, or a girl, for that matter. At twenty, I hadn't ever been attracted to anyone that wasn't a movie star. I was a late bloomer to some. To me, a relationship with a movie star would never happen, so I was safe from STD's, unwanted babies, and heartbreak when I selected which screen hottie would cause my delightful vibrated orgasm.



The rabbit was an all-time favorite.



""So, Ethan, I was wondering..."" I started as if it were a normal conversation with anyone of my friends.



If I wasn't so comfortable around him I wouldn't be able to ask this rather uncomfortable question. Especially since I had no way of knowing how it would change our relationship in the future. I was that comfortable with him though.



His pine-green eyes shifted in my direction, giving me a quick once over before returning his attention to his book. ""Yes?""



I shifted my light blue cotton shorts higher up my thighs and grabbed the back of my black tee, pulling the excess material behind me. I wanted the effect to be the material stretching across my breasts, presenting me as a sex kitten in waiting. I wasn't sure how it would work with a gay guy ‚Äì-I'm such a liar‚Äîbut it was worth a try.



And then the words spilled out, ""I want you to take my virginity.""



Those seven words bounced off the walls of his apartment, taunting me, teasing me with their stupidity. Saying it in my mind was a different reality to saying it out loud, and Ethan's silence was killing me.



What was I doing? How could I say it like that?



Blurting the words out had not been the best choice. I'd even tried to make myself appealing to him. Two boobs and a hole between my legs kept insisting it wasn't possible. He liked dick. Plain and simple.



What was I thinking?



Resisting the urge to hide my burning face into my hands, I let my humiliation consume me as I watched him and waited. Waited for him to point and laugh, to tell me to get out for being so ridiculous, but all he did was blink at his book, a frown creasing the sides of his peach-colored lips. He peeked at me from the corner of his eyes before he turned away, looked straight ahead with a clenched jaw, and then shifted back to stare at me again.



""Cassie, I don't need to state the obvious,"" he said, flexing the binding of the book, making it bend under the pressure.



It was settled. It was as simple as that for him; the end of the story. I felt stupid for blurting out my secret desire to have sex with him, but at least he hadn't laughed. I knew this wasn't going to be easy. I'd thought about this for a long time. I even began to consider making Ethan's boyfriend, Seth, a part of the 'devirginize Cassie' mission. It had to be Ethan and if Seth had to come as a result then I was okay with it. Seth was like a rippling supermodel.



A piece of my curly brown hair fell onto a pink cheek as I sighed and folded my arms across my chest. I turned my upper body towards him and leaned closer, settling inches away from his side. ""I know you like guys. I understand that, but I don't trust anyone else to do it. You're my best friend, Ethan. And let's be honest, at the rate I'm going I won't lose it until I'm like,"" I paused, my eyes rolling upwards as I pretended to do some mental math, ""eighty.""



""Don't be overdramatic. Why now? You've never cared before.""



I'm not gonna tell him. My two main reasons were for me and me alone.



Sharing my reasons would be way too embarrassing. His glistening abs and a pair of black swim trunks at a pool party had tweaked my nether regions so much that I'd been wet-dreaming about him for months. When I realized I wanted him, a rational bug came and bit my ass, and shortly after Seth was appearing in my erotic dreams too. 'Cassie Sandwich' fantasies haunted my sleep and wake time.



It's not my fault. And I'm not gonna tell him! He didn't need the confidence boost anyhow.



Ethan was always walking around shirtless and Seth was touchy ‚Äì as in he was always touching me or Ethan. I noticed it a few weeks ago, about three months after the incident that would end up taking over my dreams, how much Seth enjoyed physical contact too. Seth would run his fingers up my bare thighs when I had shorts on or bump me from behind with his hip. He would pat my ass and make comments about my small chest... he even took a finger and pulled the neckline of my shirt down to peek inside. All the flirtations I may not have noticed, coming from a gay guy, if my sex-drive hadn't gone into warp speed.



""Well? Why now?"" Ethan repeated his question.



I wasn't going to let the answer 'because you and your boyfriend make me horny, Ethan' slip out, but it settled on the tip of my tongue. Biting my lip, I shrugged. ""I don't know. I guess I want to know what it feels like.""



A horrified expression crossed his face, but he shook his head quickly, his sandy blonde hair falling into his eyes. He clutched at the binding of his book and brought it up to his face before he spoke again. ""This isn't the 'I fell in love with my gay best friend' is it?""



I slapped a hand to my chest and let my mouth drop, faking an outraged expression. I vehemently shook my head in denial. ""Absolutely not, I just want you to stick your pole into my‚Äî""



He held a hand up, face-palming me. ""If you finish that sentence I'll‚Äî damn! I'm getting an unwanted visual.""



I scoffed. ""Hey, I happen to be very sexy. Brett Carson told me that my lips are great for sucking‚Äî""



""I'll kill you,"" he said, his eyes darkening. He raised a thoughtful eyebrow when I kept silent. ""I didn't know Brett liked you.""



I shrugged. ""I didn't either.""



Clearly, I needed to try a different strategy. Already I let him steer me off-topic. It might've worked with Seth, Ethan's current boyfriend, but not with me.



I pouted my lips, attempting a seductive look that probably just made me look constipated. ""I love you.""



Ethan scowled and shifted farther down the couch, away from me. ""I love you too, but I'm not deflowering you.""



""Why not?""



He flinched away from my high pitched cry. ""Would you stop screaming like it's the end of the world?""



""All I want you to do is‚Äî""



He nodded with a scoff. ""Is stick my pole in your‚Äî""



I held my hand up. ""Okay, you're right that wasn't the best word choice.""



""Ya think?""



I sighed, rolling my eyes and sweeping a hand through my hair for dramatic effect. ""It's not that big a deal, Ethan.""



""Oh really? Then let Brett do it.""



I faked a gag. ""His hands are like meat hooks and his face looks like a very ugly bulldog.""



""Well, it's not a big deal, right?""



""Ethan!"" I reached over and punched him as hard as I could, but he barely flinched.



""For argument's sake, let's say I consider this, what about Seth? Does he get a say in this? He is my boyfriend, after all.""



""Well technically, since you like guys and I'm a girl, it wouldn't really be cheating.""



He scoffed. ""That is the most retarded thing I've ever heard!"" He heaved a sigh as he discarded his book on the floor, nudging it to the side with his foot. ""You do realize that Seth is paranoid that you are gonna turn me straight.""



I frowned, stretching my legs and reaching behind me to scratch my back. ""Is that even possible?""



Ethan snorted and settled his elbows on his knees, his chin in his hands. ""No.""



I smiled. ""You're such a freak.""



He grunted.



""If it's not possible, then what's the problem? It's just sex!""



""If it was 'just sex' you wouldn't be asking me."" I thought I'd lost him, but he turned his face, settling his cheek on his palm as he stared at me. His wheat-colored brows drawn together in serious contemplation. ""Are you sure you want it to be me?""



Hell yes! I pretended to think about it for a second before I nodded slowly.



""You understand in order for me to take your virginity I have to be-um-well..."" His face burned a lobster red as he stumbled over the words.



""Turned on?""



He inhaled and then nodded.



""Yes. That's why I was thinking that maybe we could ask Seth to join us,"" I said, feeling relieved to have finally gotten it out, hoping he doesn't think less of me for wanting this.



He blinked and his lips parted. ""How did I know you would say that? And you think I'm the freak?""



Blowing on my nails with an 'I-know-something-you-don't-know' look, I nodded. ""Seth tells me things, Mr. Sub. I could be your new dom. I think I could handle a whip pretty well and how hot would I look in slutty leather?""



Ethan's face flushed ""Oh lord,"" Ethan mumbled. ""Why do I put up with you?""



The corner of my mouth lifted in a smile. ""Because you love me and I'm your snuggle bunny.""



I could see it in his eyes. He'd given in. My brain grew legs and leaped with joy as he scrubbed his hands through his hair. ""Oh man,"" he mumbled. ""I can't wait to hear what Seth has to say about this.""



""He'll want to know why he can't pop my cherry.""



Ethan groaned, his shoulders sagging, his face now hidden in his palms, ""That's exactly what he'll say.""



I patted his muscular shoulder, letting my fingers linger longer. ""We probably won't even have to talk him into it.

¬†

**Chapter 2: You're not the Yoda of sex!**



I'm in heaven. Foot-rub heaven.



Seth was on the floor, my leg settled in his lap as he thrust his thumb along the arch of my foot. After an eight hour shift at The Coffee Barn, I purred like a cat, pointing my toes, and arching my back at the attention. I snuggled down into the suede couch at Ethan's, sinking further into the cushions, and flung an arm across my brow, humming my pleasure.



""I'll totally pop your cherry for you, Cassie,"" Seth said as he applied more pressure to my heel.



""A little to the left,"" I mumbled and lifted my arm to peek at Ethan to see his reaction.



He was scowling at Seth and cradling the cup of iced coffee I'd brought him. ""Babe, your predictability could get boring.""



Seth raised an eyebrow. ""I'm predictable? That's not what you said last night!""



Ethan pointed at me, completely ignoring his taunt. ""She knew you'd say that. Hell, I knew you'd say it."" His shoulders lifted as he inhaled and exhaled.



Only Ethan could make breathing look sexy, I thought, pretending to hide my eyes beneath my arm again, but really my eyes morphed into a hawk because I didn't want to miss a thing.



""Gorgeous, you just know me in and out,"" Seth said with a saucy wink. His cerulean blue eyes sparkled with mischief and he gave a sexy smirk as he reached over to rub up Ethan's thigh.



I nudged at his stilled hand with my ankle. ""Just because you're groping Ethan doesn't mean you get to stop rubbing my foot,"" I said.



""I'll bet she's a wild cat in bed,"" Seth said. He had one hand still on Ethan's thigh, but the hand that had been rubbing my foot slide up my bare leg.



I smacked at his wandering hand. ""Don't be dirty.""



Seth snorted. ""Says the girl that wants to be deflowered.""



""And what I don't understand is why? Stay a virgin,"" Ethan said, crossing a leg over his knee, effectively blocking Seth's hand. ""Once you lose it, it's gone and you can't get it back.""



He was twenty-one, a whopping one year older than me, and he was talking like he was a knowledgeable old man? I wasn't asking him to do this because he was an expert. I was asking because I felt safe with him and telling me to not lose my virginity wasn't going to change my mind.



""Well, thank you, Yoda, for that insightful speech. Are you a virgin, Ethan?"" I raised an eyebrow and folded my arms across my chest.



""No.""



""Are you sexually active?""



Ethan's face flushed‚ÄîGod, he's cute. He raised his iced coffee to his lips and took a sip before speaking. ""Yes.""



""Daily, in fact... sometimes three times a day. In the bathroom, on the bed, in the kitchen... on the kitchen,"" Seth said, his grin widening with every lip nibble or nervous hand that swept through Ethan's hair. ""You know, he's a screamer, Cass?""



""So you've informed me, multiple times. Just last week,"" I said dully.



It was true. Seth was all about the 'shock' factor and if he could put someone in an uncomfortable position he'd do it every time. Seth's frequent conversations about their sex life could have been half of the trigger to what made me notice a glistening wet Ethan that day. They're both drool-worthy, no one would deny that, but the idea that it had been Seth's fault from the beginning was there.



Why wasn't he rubbing my foot anymore? I scowled at him



""Seth, please!"" I cried out, once again nudging his fingers with the tips of my toes. His large hand immediately started again.



""The point is Cassie right now. Not our sex life,"" Ethan said, a deep growl rumbling in his chest. ""By the way,"" he kicked at Seth with his foot, ""I want to talk to you about that!""



""About what?"" Seth asked.



""About how much information you share with Cassie. Why do you do that?""



Seth smirked. ""Next time I do it, be sure to watch her face.""



I frowned. ""What is that supposed to mean?""



Seth raised an eyebrow and tilted his head. ""Has anyone ever told you your lips were made to be wrapped around a cock?""



Ethan gasped and turned his head towards me looking scandalized. ""Didn't you tell me the other day that Brett said something like that to you?""



I nodded and frowned deeper. ""Yeah. He did.""



""That's because I'm the one that brought it to his attention,"" Seth said with a chuckle.



""Did you now? And why were you talking to Brett again? And about 'cocks' no less?"" Ethan asked.



Brett was the type of guy that didn't care if he got it from a dog just so long as he was getting some ‚Äîguys, girls, threesomes, moresomes‚Äî the drunker the better, party type of guy.



""He's right, Cass. Stay a virgin,"" Seth said, trying to change the subject. His sarcasm let me know he was on my side though.



""Smooth, Seth. Real smooth,"" I said, nudging his hand with my foot again. ""Would you stop stopping? I'm in pain here!""



""I've always loved the way you beg me!"" He grabbed my big toe and wiggled it.



""And what makes you two think you're qualified to tell me to stay a virgin or not? Just because you've had sex, doesn't mean you're the Yoda of it,"" I said.



Seth glanced at me, raising an eyebrow and turned to Ethan. It was a 'you handle this' look and I knew that I'd said something they both disagreed with.



Oh, joy. Seth, you traitor!



Ethan didn't seem to have a problem answering either as he shifted on the couch and settled against my shoulder, dropping his head next to mine. ""You're right, it doesn't mean I'm 'Yoda' of sex, but I've had it, unlike you. So I know what you're asking for, something you don't fully understand. Not to mention, you're a girl. I've never had sex with a girl, but it's clear the first time for a girl versus a guy is completely different.""



I frowned, ignoring most of what he said except for the part about not having sex with a girl. ""How did you know you were gay if you've never had sex with a girl?"" I asked. I didn't want to deviate too much from the main topic, but it niggled my curiosity bone.



Seth chuckled. ""First of all, how do you know you're straight if you've never had sex with a guy? Are you battin' for girls town and don't even know it? Probably not. Plus, he's on the football team, Cass.""



That wasn't really an answer.



I shrugged. ""So? Lots of guys are.""



Seth turned, lifted his arms up to rest over my bare thighs, and stared at me pointedly. ""Think about it, hon. He's popular, he looks like a fucking sex god, he hasn't come out yet, and therefore cheerleaders are bouncing around in his face with those tight little outfits. When a male has no reaction to that but has to run into the restroom when the guys are changing in the locker room because he gets a boner, well that's a pretty damn big sign.""



""That happened once and it was before you,"" Ethan said, his shoulders stiffening.



""You never told me about that."" I scowled, drawing back my elbow to land a gentle blow to his midriff. His surprised grunt in my ear sent tingles down my spine.



""Hey,"" he grumbled, rubbing his stomach.



""Why didn't you ever tell me? We've been friends since kindergarten and I thought we told each other everything."" I wasn't terribly upset about it, but it seemed like an important event in his life that I should've known about. He turned so that he was facing the side of my head, his body leaning towards me.



""If you remember, I didn't actually come out to you until I was fifteen. That happened when I was thirteen. Besides, you know how my family is.""



I frowned. I did know how his family was and it had always been a sore spot for him. Honestly, I think if he told them he was gay they'd be fine with it, but I could see why he'd be hesitant to say anything. At his family cookouts, the guys wrestled. They called each other 'fags' and 'pussies' and went out of their way to make people laugh or feel uncomfortable. They did it with innuendoes or just a plain old beat down, but it was always in good fun. No one ever complained, except for the females when they got too rowdy. His family was all about sports too. Hunting, fishing, real manly men stuff, as I'd heard Ethan's Uncle Ted refer to them on occasion.



""They love you, Ethan, and you know what your dad would say if he found out? That he still loved you and how you got your jollies off was your business,"" I said, wanting to reassure him.



Seth snickered. ""I'd imagine he'd want to have the talk with me too.""



""The talk?"" I asked curiously.



""Where he threatens me with a shovel? I'll bet he'd even pull out all the stops and include your Uncle Ted too.""



I snorted and nodded enthusiastically. ""He would.""



""It took me fifteen years to come out to you, Cass, and you're my person. My family is just a different story,"" Ethan said, sounding tired and defeated.



My heart clenched at the Grey's Anatomy reference. It was another thing Ethan was 'in the closet' about. He was a Grey's Anatomy junkie. The three of us would have a crash course marathon of the last season just before the new season came out so we would be up-to-date on everything that happened. Of course, Ethan usually watched every season before that crash marathon.



""So you knew you were gay before you were born?"" I asked skeptically.



Ethan shrugged. ""I knew something was different when I was old enough to understand.""



I pushed my bottom lip out in a pout, deciding to finally let him know his previous comment got to me. I twisted my upper body enough to reach for him, pulling him tightly to my chest. ""You're my person too,"" I said, letting my voice crack with emotion as my arms wrapped around his neck. ""That's why I want you to do this for me.""



His strong arms wrapped around me but his shoulders slumped. ""I love you, Cassie, and in a perfect world, I wouldn't be gay. You'd be my soul mate,"" he whispered into my neck. ""It's just not a perfect world, but I'll try-""



""It's a perfect world because you're in it,"" I said back.



Seth cleared his throat and made a thumping noise against his chest. ""You know, you're lucky shit like that doesn't piss me off anymore.""



Feeling guilty, I pulled away. ""Sorry.""



In the beginning of Seth and Ethan's relationship, Seth had expressed some agitation when Ethan and I spoke to each other that way. I thought, until that day, that the way we spoke to each other was natural. I tried to distance myself out of respect for their relationship, but we all ended up being miserable, and luckily it was Seth that realized it. Seth sat me down and told me how sorry he was, that if he didn't like Ethan so much it wouldn't have bothered him. After that, the three of us became inseparable, and Seth warmed up to me fast. Seth mentioning that it used to tick him off made me feel even guiltier for making this request, but I could never trust anyone else as much as I trusted them.



Seth reached over and smacked the side of my upper thigh, causing me to squeal as the sting knocked me out of my thoughts. ""Just the way you two are. I've gotten used to it. Now, let's get back on topic... sex!""



There was such seriousness to his voice that I pulled back from Ethan, resting my hands on either side of my hips. The pause that followed had me biting my bottom lip before lifting my hands and rubbing my thighs vigorously. The tension thickened as the topic of the conversation switched. I swallowed as I shifted against Ethan once again and inhaled sharply. I was turned just enough towards him that I could feel the tip of my breast brushing against his arm and every time I moved, chills shot through my body.



Gawd, I'm so dirty but talk about a crowd-pleaser.



I didn't even care that Seth had stopped rubbing my aching feet anymore and it seemed like the perfect time to ask again. ""So will you?"" I asked. ""I mean, Seth seems to be okay with it?"" I raised an eyebrow in Seth's direction, his nod confirmed it, but the indecision in Ethan's face as he glanced at Seth made my stomach hurt.



Ethan cleared his throat and bowed his head, sliding his hands up my calf, kneading gently. ""I knew you were serious, but I think it's only now just sinking in.""



Seth completely stopped rubbing my calf in favor of sliding his roughened fingers further up towards my thigh. My breath caught and my eyes widened as I followed his movements. ""You both know I'm not completely turned off by girls,"" Seth added.



I held my breath at the sudden heat coursing through my stomach as Seth continued to rub in circles, going higher because I failed to stop him. I cleared my throat and paused, briefly closing my eyes as he got closer to my inner thigh. ""I-I didn't know that,"" I whispered, wishing I could take a huge gulp of water.



""Really?"" he asked with surprise. ""No wonder you let me touch you so casually.""



This was casual? Good lord! Now I want to know what un-casual is... I trembled with anticipation. I was being flayed alive and it was Seth's ever creeping hand doing it. My thighs slapped together, holding him still.



And it was no wonder I'd always felt regret when he stopped touching me on those 'casual' touching days. He had been trying to arouse me on purpose or at least cop a feel. I meant to let that accusation known, but the words stayed wedged in my thoughts.



""I just thought I was in a lucky situation where my boyfriend didn't care when I felt up his female best friend who, surprisingly, also didn't care. I lost my virginity to a female, just so we're all clear.""



""I knew this, but where are you going with it?"" Ethan asked. I felt him shift beside me, but couldn't bring myself to open my eyes wide enough to see what caused the movement.



How could anyone's brain function at a time like this anyhow? I let out an unintentional whimper as his fingertips wiggled through my clamped thighs and slipped underneath the material of my shorts.



""I'll let this happen, but only if I'm there. In fact, I want to be involved, but seeing as it's your first time and all, Cass, I would understand if you just wanted it to be Ethan,"" Seth said with a raspy voice.



Ethan released a breath I hadn't realized he'd been holding. My eyes popped open and I lifted my heavy-lidded gaze up to his flushed face. ""What?"" he asked.



He had to have known it was going this way! Seth must've said that for Ethan's benefit.



""What would be really hot is if while he popped your cherry I could fuck him from behind,"" Seth said in a partial joking tone. He pushed off the floor to sit on my other side, the side Ethan wasn't occupying.



My heart fluttered. I swallowed, wiggling between them both as chills ran through me. He was just as close now, almost plastered to my back and Ethan to my front, and I knew I would die from sensation overload. My skin was prickling with every breath, every shifting body part against me. I was far too sensitive and my dreams had nothing on the reality. If I died now I could consider myself almost lucky.



""Well, Cass? Would you mind?"" Seth asked.



My reaction was slightly sluggish given the situation I found myself in, but since it had been something I'd thought about before it didn't take much longer to respond, ""Didn't I make it clear already? Of course, I don't mind!""

¬†

I struggled with Ethan's front door as I juggled two iced coffees, a box of cupcake muffin hybrids, and my 'seen-better-days' imitation Coach purse. An eight-hour shift from hell, courtesy of The Coffee Barn, and that mighty doorknob was two seconds away from taking me out.



""Pft. I might just let it,"" I mumbled before giving in and tapping my aching foot against the door.



It swung open instantly, and there stood Seth, the fit model with permanently bronzed skin, thanks to his Italian and Greek heritage, cerulean blue 'fuck-me' bedroom eyes, and medium length hair so black it almost had a blue sheen. He wore a pristine white polo shirt, barely hiding the tribal art tattoo that curled at the base of his throat, and light gray sweats. Draw-string sweat pants were his go-to when he wasn't in public.



I swallowed and offered him a timid smile. ""Hey. I got you an iced coffee,"" I said, holding the cups out to him.



Seth took them but didn't say anything, which was unusual. Whether it was teasing me mercilessly, making gutter worthy jokes, telling stories about his Mafia involved family, or snarky remarks at something stupid I'd said he always had something to say.



So when his silence continued and his head tilted to the side as he eyed me I knew Ethan had already told him what I wanted. I bit my bottom lip at the realization, pausing as I noticed Seth's eyes zoning in on the movement. My heart fluttered and I could feel the heat filling my cheeks. It was fairly cold outside, so my cheeks were already chapped and probably pink, but where my apartment was on the wrong side of town and lacked everything, Ethan's was the exact opposite. So the heating in the building had already started bringing my body to a normal temperature and I wasn't so sure I'd be able to hide my blush for much longer.



""He told you?""



Seth neither confirmed nor denied it, but his lingering gaze down the front of my body told me the truth. I took a deep breath and exhaled slowly as I stepped inside, trying not to bump into his front as he stood immobile in the same spot. I shucked my shoes off, careful the movement didn't upset the contents in the box I held, and wiggled out of my red plaid fleeced jacket I'd found for practically free at a local Goodwill.



""What's in the box?"" he asked, stepping closer towards me.



I glanced up warily and turned my body away from him so I could hide my treasure. ""It's not for you. You and Ethan got an iced coffee.""



""Okay, but what is it?"" His hand darted out to try and grab it from me, forcing his chest closer to my face so that I got a whiff of pine and sandalwood. One of these days I planned on smuggling his and Ethan's cologne so I could spray my lumpy bed pillows with it. Where Seth smelled like spice, Ethan smelled like sugar, well specifically honeysuckle and fresh cotton, which to me was the equivalent of sugar. It was one other way they offset each other so well.



Resisting the urge to bury my nose in him, I danced out of his reach and held the green box to my chest, desperately trying to keep the gold-dusted chocolate ganache on my hybrid cupcake muffins from pressing into the top of the clear film.



""I'm not sharing with you!""



He paused and glanced down at me. When I'd first met Seth, about three years ago, I'd been intimidated by him, mostly due to his height, numerous tattoos, and strange scars that littered his torso. He easily was half a foot taller than Ethan and Ethan was just passing six feet. There I was, Miss Short Stuff, at a solid five four. I got over it, but now, with him towering over me, I remembered my hesitance at that first meeting.



""But you expect me to share with you?""



My mouth dropped open and I stilled. I knew Seth would eventually plow into the topic. It was just his way, but I hadn't expected it to be over my dessert. ""That's different!"" I cried out.



The corner of his mouth curled upwards into a smirk. ""Is it now? Care to enlighten me then.""



I frowned and bit my lip as I thought about it. ""Well‚Äî""



He raised a black eyebrow and folded his arms across his wide chest. ""Yes?""



""You're not the only one that has to share in that instance.""



""Oh,"" he managed around a chuckle. ""Okay."" He stepped away from me and made a wide gesture with both of his hands towards the living room.



I lifted my head, squared my shoulders, and pushed my chest out. My show of defiance only made him laugh harder. I was used to this type of ribbing from him. He was always trying to take my food, something he thinks is just so hilarious because I react to it, but he didn't know the reason behind my actions. It wasn't the first foster home I'd been in where they treated the kids like trash. I had plenty of instances after my biological parents died in that crash, but it was only after my adopted parents --both of whom I thoroughly adored--bit the bullet, and before Ethan's parents could legally swoop in and save me, that I experienced what true, gut gnawing, hunger felt like. That foster 'hell' thought it was okay to feed the children as sparingly as possible.



Sobering thoughts could bite my ass. I was truly tired of them creeping into my daily life activities and a marathon of sex might just fix that problem. I bit the inside of my cheek to keep from grinning like a loon as I took closer steps to the living room, but Seth's hands wrapped around my upper arms, pulling my back against his chest. He leaned down closer, so close I could feel his coffee-scented breath ruffling my hair and caressing the auricle of my ear.



""Are you sure you want to do this, Cassie?"" His whispered words made me shiver as I watched the back of Ethan's head bob enthusiastically as he played some 'shoot-em-up' game on his game console. I settled into his chest, letting my eyes shut briefly at the contact of his muscular pectorals against me.

But I‚Äôve had severe episodes of this in the past (violent projectile vomiting with coffee grounds) that I‚Äôve been convinced were gallbladder related or something and been assured my ultrasound showed nothing at all. 

I do also have slow transit (like can go weeks without a bowel movement) and have been off my Prucalopride for a week because I was missing a box from my order but the pharmacy is insisted they issued it

Sorry for adding possibly irrelevant health info but everything I read online says Loratidine is pretty safe so it‚Äôs hard to tell if I am just being stupid or the GI issues are related to the dose or maybe it‚Äôs just from the massive allergic reaction",1,1745122522.0,MCAS,2,1.0,False
