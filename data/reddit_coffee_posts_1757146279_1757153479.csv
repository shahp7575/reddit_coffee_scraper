Him and his ex wife(38f) have a 10 yo son.  We have been dating for a bit over 6 months and I recently met with his son. We haven‚Äôt told him that we are dating also I have only met him at larger gatherings with other friends. 
My partner‚Äôs relationship with his ex wife is not really good as they are still going through the divorce proceedings. They have 50/50 custody but she has tried to alter it when he was dating with someone else previously due to the gf‚Äôs race and past. 
I didn‚Äôt want to cause any other problems and told him that I was open to meeting with his ex wife as I understand her worries although I don‚Äôt emphasise with them. 
We sent his ex wife a message saying that I have met with their son twice in groups and that he would like to introduce me as his partner. If she wanted to get to know me that I was open to grabbing a coffee or a beer in the following weeks. 
His ex messaged back getting angry, that I wasn‚Äôt allowed in my SO‚Äôs place and nowhere near their kid before she gives consent and some other insults to both of us. My SO made it clear that what happens in his house and how he parents his child is not up to her and that we are not meeting her for permission. He also told me that I wasn‚Äôt forced to meet her and that he would be with me if I want him to. 
I do want to meet her. We live in a very small city and we all work in similar fields and also hang out in the same spaces. 
However, I don‚Äôt know what to do in this meeting. I thought it would just be getting to know each other etc. so he would be more comfortable but after her a messages I don‚Äôt know what the meeting would be about as she is very hostile and I have no intentions of being interrogated or insulted. 
How should I approach this? 
Also sorry English is not my first language and I think the post is all over the place.

I, m25, around anna nagar, I work as a litigation associate sounds fancy but trust me it's not, we work on all Saturday's and in most of the festival days and over time (prolly coolie at this point). But the positive is unlimited tea and gossips in this profession, starting from divorce cases to movie censor issues and what not. 

I'd like to spend some time knowing other profession individuals apart from law and get over this reality shi. Not feeling alone and kinda extroverted.

I started my usual day with my usual made-at-home coffee... I clearly need to find a milk substitute. My doctor suggested A2, though I think it goes against the keto - I'll have to do more research on that. 

At breakfast, I had ham and eggs with avocado. I made a not-on-task/target choice.    
In the future, I'm hoping to stop breakfast altogether and implement IF. 

For lunch, I had roast chicken 109 grams and 3 medium/large strawberries and water. I felt satiated. 

For dinner, I cooked pork stir fry strips, 1/2 onion, 1/2 red capsicum, 1 cup broccoli and 1/2 a medium zucchini with soy sauce and sesame seeds. I split it into 3rds and had 2/3's. I have a portion control issue and also need to work on that. 

There's a bit of anxiety around cooking. I haven't done it in about 10 years. My partner has always loved to cook. So, it's new territory for me again. 

We have beef and pork in the freezer, but I need other things. 

It's progress but also baby steps. 

How did your day go? :)

1n9vrof,https://www.reddit.com/r/McDonaldsEmployees/comments/1n9vrof/usa_quitting/,(USA) quitting,"i been working at McDonald's for almost 6 months now and i reached my limit. it was bad enough that despite doing what I'm supposed to, some coworkers and even managers would tell me im not doing my job even though i am. they accuse me of not making drinks, but i do, they just aren't physically around to see me do it. if they don't believe me they can literally check the cameras.

one coworker said i made a smoothie wrong even though i didn't, she grabbed the drink from my hand and throw it away, only for her to make the smoothie the same way i did. and once had someone throw a packet of coffee grounds at me. i pull out my phone to check the time quickly and get yelled at from a distance, but ive seen other workers straight up scroll social media during the shift and get away with it. 
I ask my manager politely to call me my nickname instead of my birth name because she can't pronounce it right, im literally giving her something easy to say but she refuses to and continues to say my name wrong.

im told to deliver an order to a park car, come back, and got yelled at because apparently i wasn't supposed to do that even though i was told to? not to mention i got blamed for an error that another worker did when she was taking orders through lane 1 (she was taking orders for my assigned lane while I was delivering the parked car order.)

once went to the bathroom to cry it out. but recently was the last straw. i was accused of having lice, even though i don't have any, i wash my hair. maybe i had dust on my hair or something? but i don't have lice. 


this job has made me feel so miserable. im quitting with an effective immediately resignation. i know im not the only one either. there's some workers who I enjoyed talking to, but i never saw them again, they must've quit. Ill be replaced anyway, they always hire people constantly. there's almost always one trainee on a shift.

Here's some information that could help you with your journey..... 

        MANIFESTING MADE EASY

Manifestation is alignment, not force. 

You don't ""make"" reality bend; you tune yourself until reality matches you.

The process Is simple, but it requires consistency:

- CLARITY 
Name exactly what you want. Not ""| want money,"" but ""I align with $1,000 flowing to me easily this month."" Ambiguity creates scattered results. If you use ""I want money"", that just reinforces you lack money, perpetually keeping you in that reality.

- IMAGE 
See it as if it already exists. Not in the future - see it NOW. Feel it in your hands, live inside the scene. Your imagination is the blueprint.

- EMOTION 
Add the feeling you'd have if it were already real, gratitude, excitement, relief. This is the fuel that powers the blueprint.

- EMBODIMENT 
Act and make choices as though it's already true. Walk, speak, and decide from the version of yourself that has it. This locks you on to the frequency.

- RELEASE 
Let go. Trust that it's already forming. Doubt strangles the process; expectation breathes life into it.

- RECEIVE 
Pay attention. 
Opportunities, ideas, or ""coincidences"" will appear. Say yes to them. Manifestation often arrives through doors you didn't expect.

THE REAL SECRET: 
You manifest what you are, not what you want. Shift your being, and the outer world has no choice but to follow.

************

THE 5-MINUTE REALITY SHIFT (once a day)

CHOOSE ONE THING 

Pick something small but meaningful (a certain number showing up, unexpected money, someone calls).
Be specific, for example; ""I align with receiving $20 easily today.""

1. SEE IT (1 minute) 
Close your eyes. Imagine the scene already complete. blueprint Example: you're holding the $20, you feel it in your hand, you're smiling.

2. FEEL IT (1 minute) 
Amplify the emotion, gratitude, excitement, joy. Let your body react as if it's happening now.

3. CLAIM IT (1 minute) 
Speak aloud or silently: ""This is mine. This is done. Thank you."" Repeat it a few times until it feels true.

4. RELEASE IT (30 seconds) 
Take a deep breath, exhale, and imagine sending the desire out into the universe.

5. LIVE IT (the rest of the day) Walk and act as though it's already true. Smile like you're carrying a secret the world hasn't caught up to yet.

IMPORTANT: 
the Universe responds to certainty, not to ope. Don't wonder ""if"" it worked - Know it did!

*********

7-DAY STARTER MANIFESTATION CHALLENGE

Simple, direct, and designed to give yourself proof, FAST!

DAY 1-The Feather Test Ask: ""Universe, show me a feather today."" See it, feel the surprise of finding it, then let it go. (Ilt might appear on the ground, in art, clothing, even online)

DAY 2-A Compliment Align with: ""Someone gives me a compliment today."" Visualize hearing it, feel the smile, then carry that vibration.

DAY 3 - Number Sign Pick a number (like 111, 333, or 777). Claim: ""| align with seeing [chosen number] today."" Expect it on receipts, clocks, signs, plates.

DAY 4-Free Coffee or Small Treat) Align with: ""I receive a coffee, drink, or small treat freely today. Visualize holding it, sipping, feeling grateful.

DAY 5- Unexpected Money Claim: ""I align with receiving unexpected money today."" It may be coins on the ground, a discount, cash, or credit.

DAY 6 - The Word Test Choose a random word (like pineapple, rainbow, dragon). Say: ""This word comes to ne today."" See it written or spoken, doesn't matter how.

DAY 7- A Surprise Gift Align with: ""I receive a gift today."" It might be someone buying lunch, sharing something, or a freebie showing up.

RULES: 
- One intention per day 
- don't mix them. 
- Visualize it briefly, then release. 

When it shows up, celebrate - that emotion seals it in.

By the end of the week, you will have PROOF that thought + feeling + release = results.

************* 

Here's 2 SHORT DAILY SCRIPTS, you can use during the 7-day challenges, or anytime. It only takes about 1 minute:

MORNING SCRIPT (first waking up)

    1. Sit for moment, take a deep breath.

    2. Say aloud (or in your head): ""Today, I align   
        with my in easily. It already exists. I feel it, 
    I claim it, I release it. Thank you, it is done.""

    3. Smile, like you already got it. Then, on with 
        your day.

That's it! No overthinking. Just a daily tune-up to lock into the right state.

NIGHT SCRIPT (before bed)

   1. Take three slow breaths before bed.

   2. Say aloud (or in your head): 

       ""Thank you for today's manifestations, seen
         and unseen. I trust the flow of creation.
         As I sleep, my intentions align, expand, 
         and return to me lwith ease. It is done.""

    3. Smile, feel gratitude, and drift into sleep.

That's all!
The Morning Script SETS THE FREQUENCY, 
and the Night Script LOCKS IT IN.

As hotels, caf√©s, bars, and restaurants compete to create memorable guest experiences, furniture has become a central part of their design strategy. Among the many companies serving this niche, **Best of Exports** has carved a distinct space for itself, emerging as the **No. 1 hotel furniture manufacturer in India**.

Their journey from a modest workshop to becoming a trusted name in hospitality furniture is nothing short of inspirational. This blog explores the story of Best of Exports, the strategies behind their rise, and the values that have helped them dominate the market.

# Humble Beginnings

Best of Exports began as a small workshop in Jodhpur, Rajasthan‚Äîa city already renowned for its rich heritage in furniture making. The founders started with a clear vision: to create furniture that combined **aesthetic appeal with functionality**.

The early days were not without challenges. With limited resources and a small team, the company had to fight hard for visibility in a crowded market. Yet, what set them apart was their commitment to **craftsmanship and quality**, even at a time when many competitors focused solely on cost-cutting.

# Learning From Mistakes

The first few years of business brought important lessons. Initially, the focus was heavily on design creativity, producing visually stunning pieces that often turned heads. However, when these products reached restaurants and hotels, real-world use highlighted some flaws. Furniture that looked good sometimes lacked the durability required for high-traffic hospitality environments.

Instead of seeing these as failures, Best of Exports treated them as lessons. They refined their approach to balance **design with strength and longevity**. This shift in philosophy became one of the cornerstones of their long-term success.

# Scaling Up Smartly

With demand slowly picking up, Best of Exports invested in expanding their infrastructure. From a small workshop, they grew into a large manufacturing facility capable of handling bulk orders while still accommodating custom requirements. The new facility gave them room to bring in modern machinery, while also retaining skilled artisans for hand-finished detailing.

This blend of **technology and craftsmanship** allowed them to deliver at scale without compromising on quality‚Äîan achievement that quickly set them apart from competitors.

# Design Philosophy: Function Meets Form

One of the key reasons Best of Exports became India‚Äôs leading hotel furniture manufacturer is their evolved design philosophy. Their pieces are not just beautiful‚Äîthey are **practical, comfortable, and durable**.

For example:

* A hotel lounge chair isn‚Äôt just stylish; it‚Äôs ergonomically designed for guests who may spend hours sitting.
* A restaurant table is treated with finishes that make it resistant to spills, scratches, and frequent cleaning.
* Outdoor caf√© furniture is built with weather-resistant materials to withstand sun, rain, and humidity.

Every design balances **aesthetic charm, guest comfort, and business practicality**.

# Mastery Over Materials

The company has mastered the art of choosing the right materials for each project. Whether it is reclaimed wood, powder-coated metals, high-quality cane, or premium upholstery, each material is selected to match the purpose and environment of the space.

* **Solid woods** for timeless elegance and strength.
* **Metal frames** for modern, industrial-style spaces.
* **Upholstery fabrics** chosen for durability, easy maintenance, and resistance to stains.

This material intelligence has ensured their furniture lasts longer and remains cost-effective for hospitality clients.

# Customer-Centric Approach

If one word could summarize their rise, it would be **customer-first**. Best of Exports is known for its ability to customize furniture exactly to a client‚Äôs requirements.

From the choice of materials and colors to the size and finish, everything can be tailored. Hotels and restaurants receive **design previews, samples, and mood boards** before final orders, ensuring confidence in the outcome.

This personalized approach has won them the trust of not only small caf√©s and boutique hotels but also large hotel chains and luxury properties.

# Wide Product Range

Best of Exports has positioned itself as a one-stop solution for all hospitality furniture needs. Their catalog covers:

* **Hotel Furniture:** Beds, nightstands, desks, wardrobes, lounge chairs, coffee tables.
* **Restaurant Furniture:** Dining tables, chairs, benches, sofas, booths.
* **Bar Furniture:** Bar stools, high tables, counters, lounge seating.
* **Caf√© Furniture:** Outdoor chairs, stackable seating, live-edge tables, and quirky designs.

This wide range allows them to serve every segment of the hospitality industry‚Äîfrom premium resorts to fast-casual caf√©s.

# Balancing Quality With Affordability

One of their biggest competitive advantages is delivering **premium quality at affordable prices**. Instead of cutting corners, they optimize their manufacturing process to keep costs reasonable.

For clients, this means long-lasting furniture that doesn‚Äôt require frequent replacements, ultimately reducing long-term expenses while elevating the guest experience.

# Adapting During Challenges

Like every business in the hospitality supply chain, Best of Exports faced a slowdown during the pandemic. However, rather than pausing growth, they used this time to improve their systems, strengthen vendor networks, and invest in training their team.

When the hospitality industry bounced back, they were ready to respond to the surge in demand faster and more efficiently than many competitors.

# Reputation and Trust

Word-of-mouth referrals, repeat customers, and glowing feedback have been instrumental in building their reputation. Clients consistently appreciate their **attention to detail, professionalism, and timely delivery**.

For hoteliers and restaurant owners, furniture is not just an expense‚Äîit‚Äôs an investment in guest satisfaction. Best of Exports has proven time and again that they can deliver value, which explains why they enjoy such high customer loyalty.

# Speed and Efficiency

Another major factor behind their No. 1 status is efficiency. Best of Exports has perfected a system where **samples and prototypes are ready in weeks**, and large-scale orders are delivered within tight timelines without compromising quality.

In an industry where project delays can mean lost revenue for hotels and restaurants, this reliability has made them a preferred partner.

# Expanding Horizons

Having cemented their reputation in India, Best of Exports is now looking outward. With collaborations and global projects, they are steadily building a presence in international markets. Their combination of **Indian craftsmanship with modern global design trends** makes them competitive worldwide.

At the same time, they are also investing in **sustainable practices**‚Äîusing reclaimed wood, eco-friendly finishes, and energy-efficient manufacturing‚Äîto align with the growing demand for environmentally responsible furniture.

# Why They‚Äôre No. 1

When we put it all together, it‚Äôs easy to see why Best of Exports is India‚Äôs leading hotel furniture manufacturer:

1. **Visionary leadership** and clear focus from the start.
2. **Balance of creativity and durability** in design.
3. **Smart scaling** with technology and skilled artisans.
4. **Deep material knowledge** and intelligent sourcing.
5. **Customer-first customization** for every project.
6. **Comprehensive catalog** across hotels, restaurants, caf√©s, and bars.
7. **Affordability without compromise** on quality.
8. **Strong reputation and client loyalty** built over years.
9. **Efficiency in timelines**‚Äîa crucial advantage in hospitality projects.
10. **Sustainability and global outlook** to future-proof their growth.

# Conclusion

The journey of Best of Exports from a small workshop in Jodhpur to becoming the **No. 1** [hotel furniture manufacturer](https://bestofexports.com/restaurant-furniture-suppliers/) **in India** is a powerful example of how vision, adaptability, and customer-centric values can transform a business.

Their story is about more than just furniture‚Äîit‚Äôs about building trust, solving client challenges, and shaping experiences for millions of hotel and restaurant guests across the country. As they continue to expand globally, Best of Exports is not just representing Indian craftsmanship but also redefining how hospitality furniture is designed, manufactured, and delivered.",1,1757152474.0,u_One_Scallion_6415,0,1.0,False

1n9vmah,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1n9vmah/anxiety_steroids_an_essay_on_my_zyn_addiction/,Anxiety Steroids - an essay on my Zyn addiction,"Hi everyone,   
  
I wrote a personal essay about my onging battles/struggles with zyn addiction and it's below  
  
I hope some people enjoy it or find it relatable. I'm still trying to quit but constantly relapsing when I get bored:  
  
 [https://wstray.substack.com/p/anxiety-steroids](https://wstray.substack.com/p/anxiety-steroids)

The first time I ever consumed nicotine lozenges was soon after I moved to Canada. I found myself able to sit and job hunt for hours in relative calm without getting bored once stimulated adequately. It made passivity OK.

That was before the advent of zyns. I thought I had cracked my addiction when I moved to Poland. They didn't serve nicotine lozenges over the counter there and thus I thought I was mercifully free from that addiction. After having 5 fillings and a tooth removed, at least partially influenced by my nicotine addiction ‚Äì I wasn't so keen to take any more nicotine products.

I didn't need a dentist to tell me that nicotine lozenges were ruining my teeth. After a few, the mouth would feel dry. And it made me more consciously aware of my teeth. They didn't feel like part of my body but more like toothpicks that had been stuck into my flesh and could fall out at any minute. The gum disease got worse. My bathroom looked like a murder scene after I was done flossing. Yet destroying my only set of gnashers still wasn't enough for me to stop.

Sure, I got offered a cheeky pouch now and again and I wasn't averse to taking it. But I never crossed the rubicon to actually buy a can myself. Well, that is until one day I was bored, tired and stressed and I just decided you know what, I wanna get buzzed right now. It was after I had hosted my own open mic in Warsaw, I was coming back on the train and thought yeah I deserve this right now, I've put myself out there. Time to smash some nicotine. I was convinced I could just have one. Just enjoy the buzz. Oh how wrong I was.

I actually remember that first self-bought nicotine pouch reaction. It gave me hiccups and a bad head. Not too dissimilar to what I imagine would happen if I sprayed my nostrils relentlessly with deodorant. Knowing this, I still got addicted.

Anyway that ended up being an enormous mistake. In fact, that decision was probably what led to my nervous breakdown in the summer of 2023. I remember sitting there in Warsaw in a cafe. I wasn't working that summer. Weather was great. I sat down in a coffee shop and got out my can of zyns. Had the first one and got the initial racing thoughts. Everything was if not serene at least distractingly intense. A bit like having a coffee except there was a stronger buzz. It was almost like the neural pathways in my brain were like fish and I could feel them swimming everywhere as thoughts and ideas started bouncing around. It honestly felt like my brain was moving.

Out of nowhere, my mind latched onto a minor detail from some paperwork I‚Äôd filled out. Suddenly, I was convinced I‚Äôd ruined my whole life. The document had been sent. There was nothing I could do. For weeks I couldn't shake this sense my life was over and honestly, this feeling of being stuck and trapped in Warsaw and impending sense of dread that a mallet was going to crush me was brought on almost entirely by nicotine.

You see, nicotine for me always gave me a pleasant relaxing feeling followed usually by anxiety, tension, restlessness. I liken it to anxiety steroids. Sure, managing my addiction meant I didn't have to manage my life, that was always the appeal of addictions. Massive distractions.

Yet on a nicotine buzz I'd create problems that weren't there before. My mind would scan obsessively for mistakes and often find them. Did I forget to do that form correctly? What if I didn't and it comes back to get me later? Things like this, and a following feeling of impending dread that I'd made a mistake I didn't know about and it'd have a horrible consequence I was also uncertain about. Kafkaesque.

Fast forward to yesterday. Waking up early in the morning with the familiar dry mouth, head feeling sticky as if the neural pathways are vines reaching out for addictive sustenance. The bags under my eyelids ache and feel heavy as if they are pulling away from my skin. Not to mention the hopelessness.

I told myself I would spend the day withdrawing. I knew how it was. Drink more coffee. Eat a McDonald's ‚Äì a place which gives another massive dopamine surge. Scroll around on the phone feeling suicidal. I'd done it before I could do it again. But then I heard the insidious voice in my head again, like Gollum from Lord of the Rings, whispering how nice it would be to have a morning buzz. You know, just to take the edge off the withdrawals. You can throw the rest of the can away. Except I knew that I wouldn't be throwing the rest of the can away. I'd been on this rodeo with the voice in my head too many times before.

I got the can. I crushed the first pouch. Gears in the brain started to spin. Tiredness melted away with a new kind of energy in the mind. Accompanied by a vague background panic that only another zyn could satisfy.

Eventually I'm in the apartment reading a book about Massive Attack and Portishead and I decide if I keep the can in my pocket I'm going to end up crushing the whole thing and having a mental breakdown. So I throw it on top of the cupboard. With a clang, it appears to land on top. I walked away with a sigh of relief.

Until 30 minutes later, and I realise I want another buzz. I tilt the cupboard forward and notice the can has fallen down the side. Here's how I know I'm an addict: I spent a solid 30 minutes crawling around on my hands and knees, trying to use a ruler as a makeshift can retrieval device all so I could get a hit of an addictive pouch. Eventually, I was able to retrieve the can and it fell open, pouches dispersing all over the carpet. Me, still on hands and knees, scrambling to put them all back in. It's 1pm on a sunny bank holiday Monday in Bristol and this is how I'm choosing to spend my time.

I get the buzz and sit squirming in my kitchen chair and my brain feels trapped inside my skull, seeking release but instead lodged. My body also now feels like a straitjacket. Now back on the addiction cycle I only have two equally horrible options. To continue taking more nicotine and make this anxious restless feeling even worse or start to withdraw and go through immense and often tear-inducing depression. I had screwed myself over once again. Given these bad options I decided to continue taking nicotine. I was, as Depeche Mode once sang, a pain that I'm used to.

I eventually kill the rest of the day until it's time for the open mic, an event I went to with the sullen petulance of a teenager dragged to a school assembly against their will. I arrive and make my angry walk to the bar, looking at the people sitting in outdoor pubs. Sims characters, I thought. Coconut milk drinking, almond milk buying, organic food product consuming frauds. I'm just enraged at these aggressively outward-facing well-adjusted people for some unknown reason. As if there's some authenticity to being unsettled and seeing through the lies. Whatever that even means.

I'm trying to decide if it's me who judges and hates what I am viewing as normies or if it's my inner addict, who attaches great value to being on the fringes of mental stability. Clearly with logical analysis it makes no sense or I'd be high-fiving homeless people on the streets instead of giving them a wide berth.

I entered the bar and took my seat, carefully calculating so I could sit far away from all the other performers in order to indulge in both a self-hating and self-aggrandizing move of self-isolation. I'm too much of a loser for these people. And I'm also not one of them because I'm different and special. Actually, my thought processes themselves sicken me but I don't have the energy to push back or adopt some kind of persona today. I just sit there rage-reading my Bible studies app. As I felt myself slipping into out-of-control restlessness I tried desperately to right myself with Bible reading. This was similar to someone injecting heroin and then thinking they could balance out the effects with a salad. It didn't work that way.

I continue trying to sneak more pouches at timed intervals such as when the 'coast is clear' and always have a pang of shame when I note the possibility of being observed.

The open mic continues. There's some predictable attempts at covers some slower, some faster. Some incredibly slow originals with an earnestness that makes me wince. The first performer does a slowed-down serious and emotional cover of a song from the Toy Story soundtrack. Honestly, on a nicotine spiral what you want is drum and bass or better, a dance remix of Chumbawamba at maximum volume. Someone stretching out and slowing down a song which in your head is twice as fast, well it was almost like a physical manifestation of the problem of nicotine addiction itself. The world was not going as fast as my mind was. And this made me restless and uneasy. I long to grab a remote and put this on double speed and so enduring it felt like torture.

I get up there, reveal I'm going to tell jokes. Unfortunately, at the best of times this feels like a hostage situation at a music open mic. I realise the atmosphere in the room turning against me when I make my vegan joke about how I used to be a vegan who smoked and drank and 'the only animal I didn't mind killing was myself.' There was one chuckle and also what I interpreted as an audible 'oohh' though I'm not even sure if that was just in my own head.

Mercifully, I take out the Nintendo DS as a break and start reciting my jokes over DS beats. There is one guy encouragingly nodding their head while the rest mostly give me blank stares. This gets at least some reaction but I still feel like I'm assaulting the audience or doing a mix between performance art and full-on agitation. When it comes to the poem, I can't stop my hands shaking when I read it. I just feel like the line between 'performance' and 'genuinely disturbed guy' on stage isn't fully drawn. I feel exposed and seen through. My voice is higher, shakier than usual due to the nicotine and I feel genuinely like a mental patient rather than a 'character' exaggerating my own awkwardness. Like a method actor genuinely gone mad and I get the impression the audience sense this too.

When I get to my seat the girl asks me if I enjoyed it, I shook my head 'no' I said. I was mad at myself. Just angered. I'd wanted this to get me out of my head, my addiction and to connect and instead it makes me realise how detached from people I truly am.

I say my goodbye to the girl next to me and walk outside. Mad as hell and yet forced to continue taking it. I go to the convenience store and spend a long time deciding what chocolate and candy to buy. I had consumed all the nicotine in the can. The depression was coming on. Scrolling through everything in my life as if it were YouTube shorts on my phone and rejecting every single item. I wasn't going to buy another can so instead I was going to soothe my hatred of existence with a 49p bag of milk bottles. That was going to be today's bus-based anti-depressant. I would do better tomorrow. No more nicotine. Just coffee and Haribo. I would get if not stronger than satiated and chubbier in a different way. Bring it on.

Addiction is looking for a relief and yet has the opposite of the desired effect. The open mic might have been an opportunity for connection but the version of myself that was able to access that had been replaced. I was too preoccupied with side-effect maintenance to be present for another person.

Of course I swear off the stuff and say it won't happen again. But there are going to be times again where I want stimulation or to feel something without taking actions or having to plan my life. Voice of Gollum in my head again: yes there will be, and when those times come I'll be waiting.

Often times I will tell people I have no funds for findom.. Absolutely true.  My bills are crazy. Could I?  Sure i ""could"". But that would require sacrifice.  Like not eating so, I choose to eat.

Does this mean I'm poor?  No.  It does not.
I worked hard when younger and put a boatload of money away then so eventually I can live a better life and not work.

So what's the point of this rambling??

It's that the choices of  subs today, especially the young ones will highly impact their futures.

Having line of sight to the funds dommes recieve I think subs don't understand or care.

My mom always was nice to me but she was also strict, nothing wrong with it she wanted the best for me but dad always was the fun supportive parent, he had a pretty great job so he‚Äôd always take me out to go do stuff together amusement parks, restaurants cinemas and a yearly summer vacation which mom was always okay with taking some of her days that I was supposed to be with her because she couldn‚Äôt afford these things and always wanted the best for me, and aside from all that stuff he was genuinely just a great supportive dad that always loved me and was always there for me and all my childhood he made me feel like I was the most important thing in his life. 

That all started to change when he met his now wife when I was 10, at first I was happy for him because at that point my mom was already remarried to a good guy and I saw how happy she was and I wanted dad to be happy like her, at first she acted sweet to me before they got married even though I felt something was off I kept quiet not wanting to ruin dad‚Äôs happiness but as time went on dad started getting less excited and interested about me or my life, yes I still went to him every other week but he was always more interested in his new girlfriend and her 3 children from a previous marriage, and our activities that we always used to have just stopped, he stopped taking me anywhere, at first I didn‚Äôt complain because I understood he was going through something new and maybe needed time to adjust to things but it never went back to the same, they ended up getting married when I was 11 and she and her kids moved in with my dad and her kids were there full time since their dad was dead, they were absolutely jerks to me whenever I went to dad‚Äôs place and so was his wife, infront of dad she acted so sweet and loving but whenever he‚Äôd leave for work she‚Äôd turn into this completely different person and treat me like her personal maid, I always told dad about it but he either didn‚Äôt believe me or didn‚Äôt wanna rock his relationship which made me lose the respect I had for him, I started hating whenever I had to go to his place so much I‚Äôd get panic attacks the night before, eventually dad started taking his new family except me of course to the same places and on vacations that he used to take me and it just so happens to be that whenever they go it‚Äôs always the week I‚Äôm with mom, I once confronted dad when I was 13 because he was taking them to a 2 week vacation to Europe asking him to please take me along but he refused saying that he‚Äôs already paying for 5 people and that he thought I‚Äôd understand because I went on many trips with him before but I didn‚Äôt and I blew up on him saying that he doesn‚Äôt love me anymore and telling him I hate him, he looked hurt but didn‚Äôt say anything back. It wasn‚Äôt just him not including me with them in these things he just became totally different just with me, he was the same dad he was before to his stepchildren but I was an afterthought to him, whenever I asked him about why he treats us differently he says that they lost their dad and that they needed him more. 

At 15 was my final straw with him, I had gotten into a massive argument with his wife and that turned into a fight after she tried pulling my hair so I fought back, my dad came to see what was happening and he saw me pulling her hair back and didn‚Äôt wait for an explanation he just pulled her away and slapped me on the face, it was the first time in my life that he ever put his hand on me, he immediately realised what he did and started apologising to me saying he didn‚Äôt mean it and he started crying but I just went to my room and packed my stuff and called mom to come pick me, my dad was pegging me not to go and he was apologising over and over but I wanted absolutely nothing to do with this family and that house again, I went back to mom‚Äôs house early and I refused to go back, 3 weeks later we went to the courthouse and I told the judge I wanted nothing to do with dad again and that I wanted mom to have full custody which she got, my dad was there crying the entire time and he tried talking to me after we got out but I told him to leave me alone and that I never wanna see him or his family anymore, he kept texting me every few days and on my birthdays and on holidays, sometimes I replied because I missed the dad he was before all this happened and sometimes I don‚Äôt, the fact he never forgot my birthday even though I was basically no contact with him especially knowing how forgetful he is to most things was nice tho not gonna lie. 

After a while he gave up on trying to get in contact with me and for years these happy birthday and happy holidays messages were the only sorta contact I had with dad, but out of nowhere yesterday I got a call from him, it‚Äôs been years so I answered thinking it‚Äôs really important, he sounded so tired but was nice, he asked how was I doing and after all these awkward small talk he asked wether we could meet at a local coffee shop to talk and that it was serious and he promised it‚Äôd be just him there, I had honestly really missed dad so I accepted and we met up there the next day, he looked older and tired, he asked wether it‚Äôs okay for him to hug me because he missed me so much and I accepted and we hugged, he told me I‚Äôm so beautiful and that he‚Äôs proud of me, we caught up a little and he told me that a year ago his wife‚Äôs kidney failed and that she‚Äôs been on dialysis ever since but it‚Äôs really bad and it doesn‚Äôt look good for her, he said that she needs a transplant quickly and that she‚Äôs been on the waiting list for two years since she was already sick for months before it actually failed, and that he hates coming to me to ask me for help and that he loves me and that I know he does and I‚Äôm not just spare parts to him but he asked me wether I‚Äôd be willing to atleast get tested to see if I‚Äôm a match, since we both have the same blood type and that there‚Äôs a possibility I‚Äôm a match, he said he‚Äôd cover all my college expenses and get me a car, after I realised what he was asking of me I said no, he looked hurt and asked why, I said I hate her and that she stole him from me and made my life hell and that she drove me away from him for years, and that she was also physically abusive to me and I said I‚Äôm sad for him but I wish she‚Äôd die, he looked sad and defeated saying he figured I‚Äôd say this but tried anyway, he assured me that this doesn‚Äôt stop him from loving me and looked at me and apologised again for how things went between us and that I‚Äôll forever be his little girl, and that he‚Äôd still pay for all my college expenses because he wanted to make it up for me and wanted me to have a good future without debt. We talked a bit more about life and how things were going and he asked about my stepdad and wether he treats me good and I told him yea he‚Äôs a good stepdad and dad to my half siblings, he looked relieved than asked wether I‚Äôd be open to more contact just with him and not his family and I accepted because I missed him, then he hugged me again and thanked me for giving him a chance and said that he always loved me, then he offered to drive me back home because I came in a bus and I accepted, he thanked me again when he dropped me off and kissed me on the cheek. 

And now even hours later I feel like an asshole for how I reacted, yes I hate this woman but dad for some reason loves her and he‚Äôs been watching her die for over two years without being able to do anything really about it. I messaged him and apologised for how coldly I acted and he said it‚Äôs fine but I still feel bad.

1n9veny,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineIncomeHustle/comments/1n9veny/recommendation_for_good_affiliate_programs/,Recommendation for good affiliate programs,"I‚Äôm thinking of creating a website to promote products using affiliate links. I‚Äôve done some research on affiliate programs, specifically¬†**Rakuten**,¬†**Temu**, and¬†**Amazon**. I‚Äôll write a few words about each so you understand why I‚Äôm asking here. :)

**Rakuten**:

Super cool, a wide variety of products and brands, easy to use and add products to your site. The big issue? They shut down accounts left and right, with money still in them, which you never see again. And most often without explanation, there are people who didn‚Äôt even break the terms. I had an account with them, started working on the site and adding products, and they closed my account with no explanation. Good thing I hadn‚Äôt started promoting anything yet. After looking into it, I found out what I just said, it‚Äôs a horror story. I‚Äôm amazed they‚Äôre still in business; they should be getting sued every day. So that‚Äôs a no, I don‚Äôt want to spend six months to earn $2,000 and then never see it.

**Temu**:

In short, they offer good commission payouts, but the problem is with the model they chose. A referral only qualifies if the person never had the Temu app installed, installs it through your link, and places an order within 30 days. In other words, if they visit your site and browse from their browser, tough luck. Same if they go through your link and buy the product but already have the app installed. Basically, the chances of making money with their affiliate program drop to near zero because a lot of people already have the app. So again, pass, waste of time.

**Amazon Associates:**

You‚Äôd think that because of the Amazon brand, this would be solid and profitable. Nothing could be further from the truth. Despite Amazon‚Äôs growing profits over the last 15 years, affiliate commissions have been steadily dropping since 2012. From what I‚Äôve read, you basically earn coffee money with how poorly they pay. Add to that the fact that an order must be placed within 24 hours after someone clicks your link, otherwise it doesn‚Äôt count so you can cross this one off too.

So, as you can see, I‚Äôm pretty disappointed, and it seems like it‚Äôs not really worth building a site, listing products, and investing in ads and promotion if there aren‚Äôt good affiliate programs out there. Do you have any recommendations that are at least somewhat decent? By that, I mean:

Cookies that last at least 14 days ‚Äî not everyone buys immediately after clicking your link

No need to pay huge commissions, but not peanuts like Amazon either

Don‚Äôt randomly close your account with money in it for no reason

Basically, just some decency and respect for the time you put into promoting their products, nothing more.",1,1757151571.0,OnlineIncomeHustle,1,1.0,False

I definitely don‚Äôt like the taste of my lattes. Had done the clean cycle of my machine as well, just in case the stuff inside got gross.

There‚Äôs not much of spluttering, drip seems as usual, just much faster. Can only conclude it‚Äôs grinder related.. I‚Äôm not sure if I accidentally changed the orientation of the top burr either (I don‚Äôt think I did.)

Also, I usually am able to knock out my puck a day or 2 later, but something about it now makes it super compact and I need to dig it out if I leave it longer than a day, which never happened in the last 2-3 years of brewing. Strange.

Here are 3 Super Friendly & FREE Ways to Start Today!,"Hey everyone! So, I was just making my third coffee this morning (don't ask, long night lol) and thinking about how many small biz owners kinda get stuck feeling like they need this massive marketing budget or a whole team to even get started. It's totally not true! I've been helping out smaller operations for years, and honestly, the best stuff often costs literally nothing. It's more about being smart and, like, *friendly*.

First up: **ask for reviews and referrals.** Seriously, this is huge and so often overlooked. If you have happy customers, just ask them to leave a review somewhere (Google, Yelp, wherever makes sense for your thing). Or, even better, gently ask if they know anyone who could benefit from what you do. It's not pushy if you've already done a good job. People trust their friends way more than any ad, ya know?

Second, **share actual value online.** I know, ""content marketing"" sounds fancy, but it just means sharing useful tips or insights related to what you do. If you're a baker, share a quick tip on frosting. If you fix bikes, a simple maintenance hack. No need for a huge production, just a quick phone video or a simple text post. It shows you know your stuff and builds trust without even trying to sell anything direct. People remember helpful stuff.

And third, **engage in communities.** Like, literally where your potential customers hang out online. Could be Facebook groups, forums, or even here on Reddit (lol, meta!). Don't just show up and drop a link though. Answer questions, offer genuine advice, be a *person*. When people see you as a helpful expert, they're way more likely to think of you when they need your service or producrs. It's definatly a long game, but super effective.

Anyway, just wanted to throw these out there because sometimes we overthink it. It doesn't have to be complicated or expensive to make a real splash. What's your go-to free marketing hack that's actually worked for you guys? Always looking for new ideas!",1,1757151277.0,smallbusiness,1,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.
there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.
_______
for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.
Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.
I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Why should you waste your time?
_______
all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.
im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no `1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )

5th thing is whatever you eat `1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".
_______________________________
If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.

Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

About six months ago I finally pulled the trigger on hiring a private investigator to find my biological father, and honestly the whole experience was nothing like what I expected it would be.

For context, my mom had me when she was nineteen and my bio dad basically disappeared when she told him she was pregnant. All I knew about him was his first name (Marcus), that he was from somewhere in Ohio originally, and that he played guitar in some local bands back in the early 90s. My mom didn't even have any photos of him because this was before everyone had cameras on their phones obviously. She had his last name at one point but genuinely couldn't remember if it was Morrison or Morrissey or something similar. Not exactly a lot to go on.

I'd been thinking about finding him for years but what finally pushed me to actually do it was having my own kid last year. Suddenly all these questions about medical history and genetics felt way more urgent, you know? Plus there was this part of me that just needed to know who this person was, even if nothing came from it. My wife was supportive but definitely skeptical about spending money on what might be a wild goose chase.

Finding a legitimate PI was honestly harder than I thought it would be. I started by googling private investigators in my area but so many of the websites looked sketchy as hell, like they were designed in 2003 and never updated. I ended up going through the state licensing board website to find investigators who were actually licensed and insured, then cross-referenced that with reviews and Better Business Bureau ratings. The first two I called wanted retainers of $5,000 just to start, which seemed insane to me.

Eventually I found this guy Tom who'd been doing missing persons and adoption reunions for like fifteen years. His office was in this nondescript building downtown, basically looked like an accountant's office. Nothing like the noir detective offices you see in movies. He was super straightforward about costs and said for a case like mine, he'd charge $150 an hour plus expenses, with an estimate of maybe 20-30 hours of work total if the trail wasn't completely cold. He asked for a $1,500 retainer to start.

The first week he basically just interviewed me and my mom separately, getting every single detail we could remember. My mom was reluctant at first but eventually opened up about that whole time period. Turns out she remembered more than she initially thought - like the name of one of his bands (Rusted Chain) and that he'd mentioned having a sister named Diana or Deanna. Tom took notes on everything, even stuff that seemed completely irrelevant.

Then... nothing for like three weeks. I started thinking I'd wasted my money. Tom would send me these brief email updates basically saying he was working various databases and following leads but no concrete results yet. I was getting pretty frustrated honestly. My wife kept giving me these ""I told you so"" looks even though she didn't actually say it out loud.

But then Tom called me on a Tuesday afternoon and said he'd found him. Just like that. Turns out my bio father (last name was Morello, not Morrison) had been living in Phoenix for the past twelve years, working as a sound engineer for a recording studio. He'd been married and divorced twice, had two other kids (my half-siblings apparently), and - this part kind of hurt - was pretty active on social media including tons of photos with his other kids.

The whole investigation took about 23 hours of billable time according to Tom's final invoice, so it came out to $3,450 plus about $200 in expenses for various database access fees and travel costs. So just under $3,700 total. Not cheap, but honestly less than I'd mentally prepared myself to spend.

Tom gave me this whole dossier with current addresses, phone numbers, employment history, even his criminal record (just a couple old DUIs from the 90s, nothing recent). He also included screenshots of social media profiles, professional websites, and recent photographs. It was surreal seeing this person who contributed half my DNA just... existing out there as a regular person with a LinkedIn profile.

The weird part is that once I had all this information, I didn't know what to do with it. I sat on it for another two months before finally sending him a message through Facebook. That's a whole other story but the short version is we've exchanged a few messages, he was shocked but not hostile, and we're maybe going to meet for coffee when he's in town next month for some music industry conference.

Looking back, was it worth almost four grand to find someone who might end up being a stranger I have coffee with once? I honestly don't know yet. But there's something about just KNOWING, having that mystery solved, that feels valuable in itself. Plus I did get the family medical history I wanted (nothing too scary, just some high blood pressure and diabetes on his side).

For anyone considering hiring a PI for something like this, my advice would be to really think about what you want out of it first. Are you looking for a hallmark movie reunion or just information? Be prepared for the person you find to be completely different from whatever you've imagined. And definitely vet your PI thoroughly - there are a lot of sketchy operators out there who will string you along for months billing hourly.

Also be prepared that finding someone is actually the easy part. Figuring out what to do once you've found them? That's the real challenge.

Would love to hear from others who've gone through this process. How did you decide to make contact? How much did your search cost? Any regrets about opening that door?",4,1757151085.0,ASKpi,2,1.0,False

hey, i‚Äôll keep it simple.

about me: early 30s, working in tech in bangalore. quiet, low-drama guy who enjoys cafes, long walks, lazy sundays and real convos more than parties or small talk. into photography, 3d design and small web/homelab projects. i‚Äôve spent the last few years focusing on skills and hobbies, so i‚Äôm new to dating but ready to try.

why i‚Äôm here: dating apps felt shallow and too hookup-heavy. most weekends i just end up scrolling, and i want to change that. i‚Äôm looking for something real, honest and slow-build.

what i‚Äôm like:

calm and thoughtful, listen more than i talk

loyal, not into drama

prefer 1 on 1 stuff: coffee/tea, parks, long walks, late night talks

creative and curious, like building/learning random skills


what i‚Äôm looking for: someone kind, emotionally mature and curious. more than that, i want a partner, not an echo.

on vibe: you don‚Äôt have to agree on everything to connect. a person is always bigger than one opinion. i value honesty and the freedom to be ourselves. i‚Äôll respect your worldview and i‚Äôm looking for someone who‚Äôll do the same.

if your instinct when you disagree is to shut down or dismiss, we won‚Äôt match. but if you can see the whole person and handle differences with curiosity instead of judgment, that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm after.

last thing: i‚Äôd rather hear ‚Äúhey this isn‚Äôt a vibe‚Äù than deal with ghosting. clear and kind endings > confusion.

if this feels like your vibe, say hi and tell me one of these: fav cafe, ideal lazy weekend, or a song you can‚Äôt stop replaying. reply or dm, no pressure, no pics upfront.

Finally I got tired and thought, ""If I don't succeed, I might as well eat something I enjoy while failing"". 

Since there was a McDonalds on my way to and from work, I started eating there every day. Typically both breakfast and dinner. We're talking about a double sausage McMuffin for breakfast (plus orange juice and coffee), something from the vending machine at work for lunch, and then a double QP cheese or something similar for dinner.

I dropped those 20 lbs / 10 kg in about two months' time, having unknowingly run a caloric deficit of some 200-700 per day, depending on how many steps I got in. Having previously utterly failed to shed them for some two years or so.

I want to make it clear that the choice of McDonalds specifically was purely coincidental, and that I have no illusions about this being a healthy diet. It most certainly isn't, which is why I've also been mindful to take over-the-counter supplements on the side, such as multivitamins and Omega-3.  But it's been interesting to carry out a sort of ""SuperSize Me"" in reverse. 

  
What I do believe can be useful about venues like the Golden Arches is that they allow for very accurate calorie counting. That's paradoxically where home cooking or other restaurant meals can easily lead you astray, even though they may well be healthier on the face of it. 

With McDonalds, I know that I can eat x for breakfast, y for lunch and z for dinner and still be beneath my average daily calorie burn. If you have an AppleWatch or a Garmin to help you keep track of your exact calorie burn, that makes it even easier. 

Another benefit I noticed is that once I started eating there, I never got cravings outside of meals, as I did with more restrictive diets. After all, if you eat kale all day, you may feel like rewarding yourself with a pizza. If you eat a hefty burger for dinner, on the other hand... well, I at least didn't.

To summarise: this worked for me, and I won't pretend it's the optimal diet for one and all. It wouldn't hurt to consult one's doctor before trying it, especially if you have an underlying medical condition (I was foolish and wannabe macho, so I didn't, but still). But that being said, it was undoubtedly effective in my case, and I think I'll stick with it. Especially since the McDonalds franchisee in question is pretty dang good.",18,1757150331.0,loseit,19,0.91,False

I‚Äôm a female college student living in¬†**Shanghai, China**, and I‚Äôm really eager to get better at speaking English. If you‚Äôre looking for a chance to practice Chinese (Mandarin) and don‚Äôt mind helping someone polish their English skills, we could be the perfect match!  
First, a little about me: People around me say I‚Äôm¬†**outgoing, cheerful, and always ready with a silly joke**¬†‚Äì so our language practice sessions will never be boring, that‚Äôs for sure! I have a ton of hobbies I‚Äôd love to share (and maybe even enjoy together if we‚Äôre in the same city). If you‚Äôre into sports, we‚Äôre already a great fit: I love everything from¬†**skateboarding and stand-up paddleboarding (SUP)**¬†to¬†**badminton, swimming, and rock climbing**. Whether it‚Äôs a casual badminton game in the park or a fun day at an indoor climbing gym, I‚Äôm always up for it! For more laid-back days, I‚Äôve been obsessed with board games lately ‚Äì¬†**Avalon**¬†and¬†**Splendor**¬†are my current faves, and I‚Äôm happy to teach new players too! Plus, playing the guitar is a big part of my daily life; I often strum and sing in my free time, and I‚Äôd love to share some Chinese songs with you as well.

# Here‚Äôs how we can connect:

* **If you‚Äôre in Shanghai too**: Let‚Äôs hang out in person! We can practice languages over a cup of coffee, explore cool spots around the city (like Tianzifang, the Bund, or those cozy local bookstores), or even mix language learning with my hobbies. Think: playing badminton first, then chatting in English and Chinese afterward, or having a ‚Äúbilingual board game night.‚Äù It‚Äôll be such a fun way to learn while making real memories!
* **If you‚Äôre outside China**: No worries at all! We can chat online via video call ‚Äì Zoom, WeChat, or any app you prefer. We can talk about our daily lives, share stories about our cultures, or even geek out over our hobbies. For example, I could tell you about my latest (pretty clumsy) skateboarding attempt, and you could introduce me to a board game from your country. This way, we can practice languages and learn about each other‚Äôs worlds ‚Äì it‚Äôll definitely be interesting!
* I‚Äôm not just looking for a language exchange partner ‚Äì I hope to make a friend too! Whether we‚Äôre laughing at a silly grammar mistake or rambling on about our favorite things, I want our time together to be both fun and helpful for both of us. If you‚Äôre interested,¬†**feel free to leave a comment below or send me a private message directly**! Tell me a little about yourself ‚Äì where you‚Äôre from, what you‚Äôre into, and why you want to practice Chinese.

1n9uxd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1n9uxd1/mostly_vent_but_this_is_not_ok_is_it/,"Mostly vent, but this is not ok is it?","The context:
Was with husband for 20 years, kids 17 & 12, split 4 months ago, 50/50 custody. Nesting arrangements as XH works away, so stays in home when onshore and I stay with family. No formal arrangements.
I initiated the split, after many years of trying, don't believe he was cheating, lots of coercive control style abuse by him.

The situation:
XH gets back onshore and returns to home to care for children. The next night, goes on a first date with someone they met online. Sees her multiple times through the week, including her coming to the family home for a coffee and briefly meeting our 12yo - 3 days after first date.
Now he has arranged for her to come over for dinner, 8 days after the first date, and stay the night in the family home, when both kids are there.

This is not ok, is it?

Bonus round. Tomorrow is Father's day here. So she will be there in the morning. 17yo asked dad what they could make him for breakfast. He said not to bother, that new woman would make him breakfast. After discussing with me, child tells dad that he really wants to make breakfast as it's father's day. XH asks child why they can't just make him breakfast another day, but then agrees to allowing child to make father's day breakfast. The proviso however, is that the children must go to the other end of the house and close the door, so he and new woman can have privacy to eat breakfast.
But wait, there's more... When child asked what he wanted for breakfast, he said, ""just make what *new woman* wants"". As in, child is expected to cook breakfast for both of them. (Note, mother's/Father's day breakfast in our family always only involved special breakfast for the one parent. The other was usually helping with the cooking.)

I am ok to be freaking out about all this aren't I?

He has NOT told me he is seeing someone (so no checking if I'm ok with her meeting the kids, etc), he has intentionally lied about it just days ago (within discussions about our financial settlement). If he was not introducing her to the kids (plus all the rest), I would not care that he doesn't tell me.

I believe she has at least 1 child, so am a little shocked that she thinks this is ok. But he is good at twisting things to sound good/ok so you ignore your boundaries/gut.

I am not going to confront him about any of this, as it would be pointless. It wouldn't achieve anything, wouldn't make me feel better, wouldn't change his behaviour and would make things even more hostile.

I just want to know if I'm justified in having such big feelings about the situation.",1,1757149697.0,Divorce,2,1.0,False

Manifestation is alignment, not force. 
You don‚Äôt ‚Äúmake‚Äù reality bend; you tune yourself until reality matches you.  

The process Is simple, but it requires consistency:

- CLARITY 
Name exactly what you want. Not ‚ÄúI want money,‚Äù but ‚ÄúI align with $1,000 flowing to me easily this month.‚Äù Ambiguity creates scattered results. If you use ‚ÄúI want money‚Äù, that just reinforces you lack money, perpetually keeping you in that reality. 

- IMAGE 
See it as if it already exists. Not in the future ‚Äì see it NOW. Feel it in your hands, live inside the scene. Your imagination is the blueprint. 

- EMOTION 
Add the feeling you‚Äôd have if it were already real, gratitude, excitement, relief. 
This is the fuel that powers the blueprint.

- EMBODIMENT 
Act and make choices as though it‚Äôs already true. Walk, speak, and decide from the version of yourself that has it.  This locks you on to the frequency.

- RELEASE 
Let go. Trust that it‚Äôs already forming. Doubt strangles the process; expectation breathes life into it.

- RECEIVE 
Pay attention. Opportunities, ideas, or ‚Äúcoincidences‚Äù will appear. Say yes to them. Manifestation often arrives through doors you didn‚Äôt expect.

THE REAL SECRET: 
You manifest what you are, not what you want. Shift your being, and the outer world has no choice but to follow.

*************

THE 5-MINUTE REALITY SHIFT (once a day)

CHOOSE ONE THING 
Pick something small but meaningful 
(a certain number showing up, unexpected money, someone calls). 

Be specific, for example; 
‚ÄúI align with receiving $20 easily today.‚Äù

1.	SEE IT  (1 minute) 
Close your eyes. Imagine the scene already complete. blueprint 
Example: you‚Äôre holding the $20, you feel it in your hand, you‚Äôre smiling.

2.	FEEL It  (1 minute) 
Amplify the emotion, gratitude, excitement, joy. 
Let your body react as if it‚Äôs happening now.

3.	CLAIM IT  (1 minute) 
Speak aloud or silently: ‚ÄúThis is mine. This is done. Thank you.‚Äù 
Repeat it a few times until it feels true.

4.	RELEASE IT (30 seconds) 
Take a deep breath, exhale, and imagine sending the desire out into the universe.

5.	LIVE IT  (the rest of the day) 
Walk and act as though it‚Äôs already true. 
Smile like you‚Äôre carrying a secret the world hasn‚Äôt caught up to yet.

IMPORTANT: 
the Universe responds to certainty, not to hope. Don‚Äôt wonder ‚Äúif‚Äù it worked - Know it did! 

***********
 
7-DAY STARTER MANIFESTATION CHALLENGE

Simple, direct, and designed to give yourself proof, FAST! 

DAY 1 - The Feather Test
Ask: ‚ÄúUniverse, show me a feather today.‚Äù
See it, feel the surprise of finding it, then let it go. (It might appear on the ground, in art, clothing, even online)

DAY 2 - A Compliment
Align with: ‚ÄúSomeone gives me a compliment today.‚Äù Visualize hearing it, feel the smile, then carry that vibration. 

DAY 3 - Number Sign
Pick a number (like 111, 333, or 777).
Claim: ‚ÄúI align with seeing [chosen number] today.‚Äù Expect it on receipts, clocks, signs, plates.

DAY 4 - Free Coffee (or Small Treat)
Align with: ‚ÄúI receive a coffee, drink, or small treat freely today.‚Äù Visualize holding it, sipping, feeling grateful.

DAY 5 - Unexpected Money
Claim: ‚ÄúI align with receiving unexpected money today.‚ÄùIt may be coins on the ground, a discount, cash, or credit.

DAY 6 -  The Word Test
Choose a random word 
(like pineapple, rainbow, dragon).
Say: ‚ÄúThis word comes to me today.‚Äù
See it written or spoken, doesn‚Äôt matter how.

DAY 7 ‚Äì A Surprise Gift
Align with: ‚ÄúI receive a gift today.‚Äù
It might be someone buying lunch, sharing something, or a freebie showing up.

RULES:
‚Ä¢	One intention per day - don‚Äôt mix them.
‚Ä¢	Visualize it briefly, then release.
‚Ä¢	When it shows up, celebrate - that emotion seals it in.

By the end of the week, you will have PROOF that thought + feeling + release = results.

***********

Here‚Äôs 2 SHORT DAILY SCRIPTS, you can use during the 7-day challenges, or anytime. It only takes about 1 minute:
 
MORNING SCRIPT (first waking up) 

    1.	Sit for a moment, take a deep breath.

    2.	Say aloud (or in your head):
         ‚ÄúToday, I align with my in easily. 
           It already exists. 
           I feel it, I claim it, I release it. 
           Thank you, it is done.‚Äù

     3.	Smile, like you already got it. Then, on with 
         your day.

That‚Äôs it! No overthinking. 
Just a daily tune-up to lock into the right state.

NIGHT SCRIPT (before bed) 

     1.	Take three slow breaths before bed.

     2.	Say aloud (or in your head):
         ‚ÄúThank you for today‚Äôs manifestations, seen 
           and unseen. I trust the flow of creation.  
           As I sleep, my intentions align, expand, and 
           return to me lwith ease. It is done.‚Äù

      3.	Smile, feel gratitude, and drift into sleep.

That‚Äôs all!  
The Morning Script SETS THE FREQUENCY, 
and the Night Script LOCKS IT IN.

(Espresso + filter coffee out of one grinder),"So I had my Baratza Encore ESP for quite a year now, always sitting at around grind size 11 for espresso. I am quite happy with it so far!

Now I also want to make some drip / filter coffee.   
My plan is to buy extra beans and grind them once or twice a week, so Ill always have fresh coffee for the drip one. 

For espresso Ill grind them fresh every single time of course. 

So Ive got two questions to someone who knows the Encore ESP better or uses it for both filter and espresso:

\- Will it harm the grinder over time, if I dial it up and down many grind sizes once or twice a week? (I do single dose, so no beans are stored in it)

\- Will grind size 11 always be 11, even after dialing up and down 200 times? Or will it ""wear out"" or anything like that over time?",0,1757149571.0,espresso,1,0.5,False

Bahrain Company Formation: 2025 Insider‚Äôs Guide to Sustainability and Compliance\
\
Alt text: Corporate professionals in a business meeting, modern Bahrain office., understanding ESG reporting is no longer optional‚Äîit‚Äôs your launchpad for credibility and growth.\
\
The 2025 Bahrain Business Environment: Opportunities, Growth, and ESG\
and Reuters, Bahrain‚Äôs GDP is projected to rise by 3.4% in 2025‚Äîahead of most Gulf peers. The government-backed Economic Development Board (EDB) reports over $2.7 billion in foreign direct investment last year, thanks in part to the country‚Äôs 100% foreign ownership policies in key sectors (see details). The new Bahrain Business Hub in Seef and expansion of Bahrain Bay as a fintech and green business enclave are attracting both multinationals and agile startups.\
\
Importantly, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism (MOICT) is implementing a staged ESG reporting framework as of January 2025, affecting all companies with commercial registration (CR) above BHD 500,000 annual turnover.\
\
But there‚Äôs more: The Sijilat (Bahrain‚Äôs online business portal) has woven ESG data fields into CR renewal, making compliance a matter of good business‚Äînot just box ticking. Unlike UAE‚Äôs freewheeling disclosure standards or Saudi‚Äôs heavy compliance layers, Bahrain chooses a pragmatic, investor-friendly path.\
\
What Is ESG and Why Does Bahrain Care?\
ESG Explained‚ÄîIn a Bahrain Context\
ESG stands for:\
\
Environmental: Carbon footprint, energy use, water management, waste, and biodiversity.\
Social: Employee welfare, diversity, supply chain ethics, community impact, and local hiring.\
Governance: Board structure, risk management, anti-corruption, transparency, and shareholder rights.\
\
Bahrain‚Äôs 2025 Vision aims to position the kingdom as a leader in Gulf sustainability. Whether you‚Äôre launching in Bahrain Financial Harbour or a logistics hub near Khalifa Bin Salman Port, ESG is both a legal and reputational asset.\
(On a personal note, my company‚Äôs first ESG audit was unexpectedly thorough‚Äîdown to our sourcing of bottled water and Ramadan work cycles!)\
\
2025 Regulatory Landscape: What ESG Reporting Is Now Required in Bahrain?\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, regulatory requirements in Bahrain. have introduced tiered ESG disclosure rules in 2025. Here‚Äôs what is now required:\
\
Publicly Listed Companies (Bahrain Bourse):\
Full annual ESG reporting as per CBB guidelines.\
Required adoption of GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) or SASB frameworks.\
\
Deadline: 30 June 2025 for initial reporting, then every fiscal year.\
\
\
Private Companies (Annual Turnover ‚â• BHD 500,000):\
\
ESG declaration embedded in Sijilat commercial registration renewal.\
Board-approved sustainability statement.\
\
Disclosure on environmental risk, workforce diversity, and anti-corruption.\
\
\
Free Zone Firms & Startups:\
\
Lighter ESG reporting for firms in Bahrain Free Zones.\
\
Encouraged (not mandatory) sustainability self-assessment.\
\
\
**SMEs (Turnover  Best money-saving tip: Use Tamkeen‚Äôs business assistance grants, which may cover up to 70% of ESG consulting costs for SMEs.\
\
\
Budget planning? See this detailed cost breakdown and fee calculator.\
\
Bahrain Business Culture: Networking Your Way to ESG Success\
Oddly enough, my breakthrough in ESG compliance came at a Bahrain Bay coffee shop‚Äîover Arabic coffee and dates, discussing new regulations with a MOICT official who remembered my punctuality at the Chamber of Commerce. Relationships matter. Bahrain‚Äôs business culture values face-to-face meetings, prompt document submission, and respect for traditional etiquette (accepting coffee with your right hand, always).\
In contrast to the rigid, hierarchical approach I witnessed in Saudi, and the entirely online setup in Dubai, in Bahrain a strong local network can fix minor issues and expedite processes. Attend business breakfasts in Seef, join Tamkeen forums, and always keep an eye on pre-Ramadan regulatory updates‚Äîdeadlines shift each year.\
\
Common Mistake: Ignoring ESG in Early Company Formation\
Many new founders skip ESG, assuming it only matters for listed firms. That‚Äôs a costly error. MOICT now checks ESG fields for every CR renewal over BHD 500,000 turnover. If you neglect ESG, expect delays or even temporary business halt.\
How to avoid it?\
- Engage a trusted Bahrain-based compliance advisor.\
- Start drafting ESG policies before applying for your CR.\
- Don‚Äôt rely solely on regional templates‚Äîtailor ESG actions to Bahrain‚Äôs unique priorities (water conservation, local hiring, women‚Äôs leadership).\
\
Recommended Resource: KeyLink‚Äôs ESG Consulting\
Based on experience, I recommend KeyLink for ESG onboarding. They not only fast-track your Sijilat CR, but also offer custom ESG policy templates and connect you with certified sustainability auditors.\
Why? Their team understands Bahrain‚Äôs unwritten rules (timing, document language, and even Ramadan workflows)‚Äîwhich can save you weeks of frustration.\
\
Frequently Asked Questions: Bahrain ESG Reporting & Company Formation\
1. Do all new companies in Bahrain need ESG reports?\
Only listed companies and private companies above BHD 500,000 turnover are mandated to file detailed ESG reports. Smaller firms and startups in Free Zones have lighter or voluntary requirements, but best practice is to still adopt minimal ESG disclosures.\
2. Can foreigners own 100% of Bahrain companies and still comply with ESG rules?\
Yes. Foreign ownership up to 99% is permitted for most activities, with no extra ESG hurdles. For 100% ownership in sensitive sectors, consult MOICT on sector-specific ESG nuances.\
3. What are the penalties for missing ESG deadlines in Bahrain?\
Expect BHD 1,000+ fines and possible CR suspension. Always monitor the Sijilat portal for notification emails and renewal reminders.\
4. Where‚Äôs the best location to set up my office for ESG-friendly business?\
Bahrain Bay is leading in green office buildings and sustainability forums. Seef District and Diplomatic Area also offer ESG-focused coworking spaces.\
5. How do I choose the optimal business structure for ESG compliance?\
Review options at this business structure guide. For streamlined ESG, WLL or Free Zone setups are practical for most foreign founders.\

That sounds awful and the guilt is stressing me out.

I've been her caregiver for 5+ years. Ive been working part time, getting degrees and caring for her. But I have had enough. I am done with school and I want to start my life. If I don't, I cannot imagine where my depression is going to take me. 

She is unable to stand/walk for a prolonged period of time. She uses a walker. So, cooking and doing chores is something she cannot do.

 She can bathe, clothe and make herself coffee, grab something from the refrigerator & warm it up as long as there is somewhere immediate to sit.

She refuses to seek outside help because of money. So, the set plan is to have my sister drive her to her appointments. Then, as far as nutrition goes, I plan on seeing her at least every 2-3 weeks. During my time with her, I will help meal prep for the week and refill/order meds. I'll enroll in Walmart+ to make that process easier. My sister plans on visiting her 2x per week to do the same.

She is diabetic and has been for 10+ years. This is the scariest part for me because she does have episodes of low blood sugar (high blood sugar too but the low blood sugar is more symptomatic). I put a mini fridge in her room with juice and some glucose tablets. My sister & I will make sure that is always stocked. She also wears a continuous glucose monitor that lets me track her on my phone. I have installed a camera in the living room, too.

1n9ucfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/weyler/comments/1n9ucfl/why_would_tyler_rather_die_than_lose_his_hyde/,Why would Tyler rather die than lose his Hyde powers?,"https://preview.redd.it/yw5b8k728inf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc47ae308067a86f3d4a556e0f6dee7399bde720

I think everyone noticed this peculiar behavior in this second part of the season where, even after everything he's suffered, ***Tyler doesn't hate the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbeing a Hyde and goes against Fran√ßoise's perspective, who sees it as a curse.***

We saw him confront her about it, and later, in the final episode, we see Tyler begging his mother not to take away his powers and asking Wednesday to kill him right there, because he'd rather die than lose them. Which is incredibly interesting, considering everything he's been through over the past two seasons.

And after analyzing our beloved characters so many times, I've come to understand why. *In fact, there are several reasons, and in this post, we'll explore each of them.*

>**1. Being Hyde has become part of who Tyler is, and it's shaping his new identity.**

I think we've discussed enough about how we don't know who the real Tyler is after all the plot twists in Season 1, about how we don't know what he truly regrets or doesn't regret, but one thing we can know: ***Tyler is in his perfect state of nature.***

***What I mean by this is that, from the beginning (S1), the ""normie"" Tyler we know depreciated himself.*** He had a huge complex about being a random guy working in a coffee shop in a small town, where people didn't have high expectations of him. He felt isolated when he no longer had friends, his father ignored him, and he felt trapped in that place, powerless and unimportant... *until Laurel Gates unleashed the monster within him.*

**Of course, it was a suffocating and painful period that brought more suffering to Tyler's life**, *but it was also a period that redefined his existence*. *For the first time, he felt strong, powerful, and unique in a way, even if the consequences were tragic.*

We know that Tyler hasn't had the time to repent for the victims he made in Season 1, and that there's a chance he'll never think about it because he can't handle the remorse. But we see that in Season 1, living between the adrenaline of falling in love with the person who would be his downfall (Wednesday) and simultaneously being the killer she's looking for puts him in a balance between pain, fear, and a sense of danger. These are feelings that, when you experience too much, you either become extremely traumatized or addicted. ***And with Hydes, they end up being a mix of these.***

What we see in Season 2 is how Tyler stops being a pawn of some villain and begins to act and think for himself. His confronting Laurel, his abuser, with the words, *""You're not my mother, you're my master. Or should I say 'were'?""* and then killing her right afterward was a great symbolism of ***""You don't manipulate me anymore. You don't dictate who I am anymore.""***

And we see in Episode 5 how independent he wants to be when he argues with Donovan during his delirium, saying he *""didn't need anyone,""* even when he instinctively reached for Wednesday. After all, at that point he truly had no one else, so he wanted her at any cost with the excuse of ***""I'll kill the people you love if you don't stay with me.""*** It was clear that, although he didn't want to be controlled, he also didn't want to be alone. *That's why he pursued her so obsessively.*

In the scene where she tries to manipulate him into injecting her with the substance to become his master, and he stands there listening, we can interpret that ***he would rather submit to her than let her go.***

Later, when Fran√ßoise appears, we see him disappointed that his mother chained him up and became his master. *Because again, he didn't want to give up his freedom initially.*

And we also see how he contrasts himself with his own mother and uncle, how he doesn't see Hyde as a curse or something bad; *After all, being Hyde was what brought meaning to his life and took him away from the ""peaceful, low-expectations"" life.*

**So it's a bit complex, but while being Hyde is his prison, it's also his freedom.** He can finally live a vivid life, full of ups and downs, where the adrenaline is palpable. It's the adventure that, even if it's not everything he dreamed of or deserved, is still his. *Only his.*

>**2. Tyler has already lost almost everything, and losing Hyde would be losing himself.**

This completes the previous motivation, *where we see that Hyde is already part of who he is.* We can see with our own eyes how much Tyler has lost in recent seasons; ***he lost his friends, his father, the love of his life, and watched his mother die before his eyes.***

*Losing Hyde would be synonymous with losing a significant part of himself, especially after it changed the way he sees himself.* Furthermore, he would be vulnerable in a world where he was once a monster, and where he could never return to normal or live an ordinary life. *So even though there are downsides to being a Hyde, not being one is not an option.*

**I think this emphasizes how important Hyde is to Tyler, and how important Tyler is to the series overall.** He's the character who leads this Hydes storyline, and he tends to be the turning point that transforms the Hydes's perspective on society; *he is the change.*

>**3. ""Wednesday, you sensed the monster in me. You fell in love with it.""**

*This is the most classic reason, but I think it's impossible not to mention.*

**There's a great complexity to the attraction Wednesday and Tyler feel for each other,** because there are layers and layers of motivations for why they love and hate each other at the same time. It's a chemistry that can't be explained, but at the same time, *it's possible to reach an understanding.*

*On one side, we have a morbid and weird goth girl who's attracted to torture, domination, death, and serial killers. On the other, we have a bloodthirsty serial killer monster hiding inside an ordinary boy.*

***Tyler fell in love with Wednesday precisely because of her strange and dark nature.*** Initially because his Hyde nature is predisposed to be dark and morbid, but later it also becomes about her being the girl who would truly accept who he was when she discovered the truth. *He embraced her ""darkness"" in the first season, and we see that in Season 2, she embraces his ""darkness.""*

***Wednesday initially fell in love with the ""normie Tyler"" she met, whose love language was and still is acts of service.*** He did a lot for her, and it was convenient for her. But her darkness recognized his and empathized, as if she knew there was something different about him (since, in the end, he was Hyde). We see her drawn to this same instinct with Fran√ßoise when she decides to save her, later discovering that she is Tyler's mother and is also a Hyde. *She appreciates this, even if unconsciously.*

**Him being Hyde and Wednesday being attracted to him is one of the things that makes them compatible.** *She craves control in every aspect, and his nature craves being controlled.*

And he knows full well that she enjoys him being the murderous monster, the potential danger. ***So why lose his charm, right? If in the end, she'll always want someone like him.*** üòè *That way, he never misses his chance.*

>**\*\*\***

***I think we can conclude that Tyler has more than just great reasons to remain as Hyde.*** The fact that he's the character who will change the perspective of who Hydes are in the society presented in the series' universe, how this changed the way he sees and appreciates himself, *and the fact that this makes him the perfect match for the person he loves make these reasons extremely valid.*

For me, there are certain buffets with limited options but great dishes all around. There are also buffets that spoil you with choice even if those choices are subpar. Acacia has the rare combination of subpar dishes, and limited selection at a high price point.

At this price I'd expect some good beef options at least like at Vikings or at Tsuru where they have roasted beef short plate or beef yakiniku.

Also - For our Muslim brothers and sisters I'd caution eating here at the restaurant kay I saw the seafood, chicken and pork being cooked on the same grill. Actually in one picture you can see the skewers and to the untrained eye they might be both chicken (May mga nalito nga dito kasi walang label) and a few Muslim diners complained because wala ngang label and some of them ate pork skewers. But to the credit of one attentive staff, when the skewers came out he saw that they were going to the table with the diners wearing hijabs and said ""Pork man ni bai"" to the other waiter and immediately apologized to the table.

I‚Äôve been working on a SaaS app project that is a bit larger and more complex and I kept running into what I felt to be a speedbump in my testing processes. As I go through and test my app and try to break it in various ways and use it how the users will, I found it monotonous and time consuming to test and when an area of concern presented take screenshot, paste screenshot into doc, add notes, add console logs, etc.. it was just so much clicking back and forth to build my issues/notes document and I thought there should be a simple (and free) solution to this for easy documentation when testing. I couldn‚Äôt find an option out there that is free and so I decided to take a side quest from my side project to vibe code a tool that will serve me and save me time. 

I used Hostinger Horizons initially and then brought my project over to chat gpt and prompt coded and then tested and debugged from there. 

Now I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs perfect or beautiful, and honestly it may be only useful for me, which is fine. I find it not only useful for me, but could be useful for the support teams I‚Äôve managed when documenting issues for our development teams. I also find it particularly useful when vibecoding to use this to document and provide the document to the AI i am working with to vibe code so that it can fix the issues. 

I went ahead and launched it as a free tool for anyone to use found at SnapperSessions.com. You basically start and name your session, drag the snapper button to your bookmarks in your browser, go to the site you are testing on and click the snapper button to document things you want documented. You‚Äôll be prompted to enter any notes and save and once you‚Äôre done with your full session and all of your snaps, you can export the session in various formats with all the details. 

Nothing crazy or unthought of I‚Äôm sure, but it was a fun vibe coded little project and helps me save a ton of time in my testing, so I thought others may find it useful. No sign up and no data collection. It‚Äôs free free however if you love it and feel the strong urge to ‚Äúbuy me a coffee‚Äù and support my journey there‚Äôs a link for that and I will be grateful!

Ventrue- Are the least creative companies. They own things like real estate, stock market companies, shipping companies, etc.

Toreador- Are the creative and sensual business owners. They own things like a popular art gallery, perfume company, night  clubs, naughty toy companies, etc.

Nosferatu- Are the tech savy companies. They own pre-built pc companies, anti-virus companies, social media companies, etc

Brujah- Are the more smaller run down business. They own biker bars, punk rock music joints, and since most modern Brujah are young i can see them owning coffee joints, Hooka bars, card shops, etc.

Tremere- Are the new age business. Things like tarot card reader, new age occult store, etc.

Malkavians- Can really own just about any small business. I wouldn't put them owning a big business very stressful business as their minds will break, more than they already are.

I have americano with a bit of milk and a scoop of collagen creamer in it every morning.

He said I should have the coffee about an hour later. I will get a kick from the protein shake as well and it is better for empty stomach than the coffee and also that I get cortisol spikes if I start my day with coffee.

Well I tried this but didn't get the expected hit, I was still craving the coffee and was sooo grumpy, couldn't wait for an hour to pass so I can have my dose üòÖ

Has this routine worked for anyone?? Shall I just continue doing it until I get used to it? Please share your thoughts, it would be much appreciated.

We met at a quiet coffee shop, and while the conversation flowed, I realized I was overthinking every little thing where to sit, when to make eye contact, how much to share. By the end of it, I felt drained even though nothing actually went wrong.

It made me wonder if I was putting too much pressure on myself instead of just treating it like two people hanging out. I want to get better at relaxing on dates, making it feel more natural and less like I‚Äôm performing. So now I‚Äôm curious what are your go-to tips for first dates?
