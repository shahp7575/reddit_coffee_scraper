1neg03p,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1neg03p/never_felt_so_lonely_since_covid/,Never felt so lonely since COVID,"It is along post. I feel deeply about her. And I am trying to move on. But I need some support from this community. I just want come back to this thread so that I can remind myself, there is light at the end of the tunnel.

My ex-girlfriend (32F) broke up with me (28M) a couple of weeks ago. 

I have never made one year in a relationship. Ever. Even though every time I have dated someone, I always dated them with intentions, yet here I am, writing another sad, just so sad experience while sitting in my apartment. Hopeless.

We were together since end of May '25 till end of August '25. It was really short lived yet highly impacted relationship I have had, by far. By the time we started dating, we already knew each other for a year. May, started dating, seemed very promising from the first few dates on. We weren't rushing into it, everything was developing naturally a bit paced yet control. We went to see some cities during the month of June for the mid-week and weekend. Thoroughly enjoyed our time together. 

Now, July came in, my mom was visiting me from India, so I already told my ex, if she would be open to meeting, (maybe it was a bit too soon, but thats why I asked because things were getting serious between us) she happily said yes, we went for brunch, although my mom doesn't speak much good of an English but she still tried, but it started off a bit shakey. Since we both are working full time, we were trying to maximize the time spend together by possible means like going for walk after work, or going for lunch during break (small city, so easy to meet up) and going on date once per week, even finding enough time to get intimate. And keeping in mind, we were having a very good rhythm of texting through the day and all. 

And then...

One evening around end of July, before she was going to see her sisters, she said she need to ""talk"" and said ""she doesn't want to continue..."" we talked for about an hour and where that was coming from, long story short, lots of confusing reasons she mentioned I didnt understand but she said let's talk about it after she is back from her vacation. I consider that as the break up, wasn't planning on contacting her and just wanted to start to move on from there on. Very Next day came in and she sent ""Missing you dearly."" And then another horror started now that I look back, we texted during her vacation pretty much every day, even though I mentioned that in the beginning that I needed sometime to process our last conversation. She was updating me with her time with her sisters and sending me photos and all. This all made me believe instead of breakup, we were on sorta unclarified break and I didn't want to push that ""talk"" while she was away.

She came back after 10 days, went to pick her up. She brought some socks and chocolates for me. I considered that as a very sweet thing to do. 

One day after office, we took a walk and she said that she is ready to talk and she told me that she was having feeling that my family might not welcome her. I tried to apologize if somehow the first impressions from my mom was not the best, yet she is always welcome in the family, and I'll support her no matter what. Talk didn't go well (IMO), she told me she needed sometime to think and reflect, I agreed with whatever she needs from myside to make the better call and judgement.

We met a couple of days after that, just to spend sometime together, and we got intimate that evening. That was confusing. Again the texting and couple of meetups/dinner dates went on. 

Then the time for my family vacation came in, seemed like we were in the rhythm of texting as usual. She was asking me about my day to day plans, pictures and experiences, everything and I was reciprocating with the same energy about hers, maybe a bit more. But as soon as the final days of vacation came around, I show shift in her texting tone, I realized somethingnis significantly off and breakup was coming. I felt maybe there could be involvement of new ""interest"" . I still tried to engage but she was not thrilled about anything to share. Next day after I came back, I planned to ask her in person, so just sent a casual opening text and after a few hours, she brokeup with me via text. TEXT. A 32 year old. I openly accepted the decision but asked to get a closure via call, at least, out of respect for the relationship and both of us as person. She told me the same thing, my family and our relationship looked very complicated. 

I really don't understand anything about it. From the beginning, I made sure to let her know and see if there is anything in particular she expects from relationship or if I had some feelings for her I wanted to share without piling it up. This break-up has shook me to my very core because I loved her dearly ( I still do) and I thought the quest for the one was over 😅.

From my vacation, I brought her Swiss chocolates , so I wanted to give it to her right after I arrived but break up had to be delivered earlier than chocolates I guess. I still offered her chocolates, she accepted it. Sometimes I still look at her Whatsapp chat and whenever I see her online , and whenever I see her online for an extended duration of time I get so insecure that there might be someone new in her life and my family was just a replacement reason and the actual reason could have made her bad guy in this (??!!) who knows? My mom knew about my situation with her, so she didn't interfere in this for sometime but she recognizes I was totally off, and she offered that if my ex wanted any sorta of assurance even just as my friend, she would be willing to invite her for dinner or coffee or anything to make her feel comfortable, and I offered this to her. She politely declined.

And now, that my mom is gone back to home and now that my ex is not here, I'm feeling so lonely in my apartment. I have lost my motivation. I used to regularly go for the runs, gym and biking but for the last one month, I have no appetite for that nor I have an actual appetite to eat food. I feel depressed. Sometimes i stalk her on socials, I have muted but we haven't cut it off totally. Yet.

I have been consoled by many, that I will find someone. But it is not as simple as it sounds.

1nefw93,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nefw93,Diary of a meniscus re-tear - day #3,"This is the second installment of my blog, where I share what’s going on with my knee injury, hoping that if I write it down and post it I’m not going to go crazy. So far so good but I may lose it by the end of the week. 

My last post got a whopping 11 likes so here is the pic I promised. Taken last night. This morning I also snapped a pic of the hole in the sidewalk that caused this mess. I’m wondering of I can sue someone over this. 

On to today’s story. 

First thing in the morning I went to the supermarket to buy the champagne bribe for the doctor. I got there at opening time - 7 a.m. I walked with crutches which turned out to be quite the workout. I worked up quite a sweat so I decided to buy some deodorant as well. 

Champagne and deodorant at 7 a.m. Sounds like the kind of shopping a hobo would do after playing on the slot machines all night and winning some money, now on his way to impress his mistress.

When I got to the hospital, I met with some confusion at the reception desk when I said I have a meeting with the orthopedist. “Are you some kind of a dealer?” the lady asked. After I explained the doctor and I have a common acquaintance, she rolled her eyes and reluctantly handed me an empty records folder with my name on it. 

I proceeded to the doctor’s office and sat down in the waiting area. When the nurse came out I handed her the folder along with the report from my previous surgery and from the ER visit. I told her my name and said I have an appointment with the doctor. She rolled her eyes, said “I know” and slammed the door.

So I took out my book and read a few chapters. An hour later the doc called me in. 

He looked over the documentation, then looked at my knee and immediately knew what’s up. He asked me to take off my shoes and lie down and took out a syringe. Ah shit, here we go again. 

I should have made a video of the procedure, it was disgusting and mesmerizing at the same time. He inserted the needle into the knee, pulled on the plunger and filled the barrel for the first time. Then he removed the barrel, leaving the needle in the knee while fluid leaked out of it. He emptied the barrel, attached it to the needle again and filled it. He repeated this process several times. 

It was my personal record. 110 milliliters of fluid aspirated. The good news is it wasn’t bloody.

“Look at that, it’s starting to look like a knee again,” the doctor said as the knee returned to its normal size. Then he proceeded with the standard knee examination techniques. The resulting disgnosis is a likely re-tear with a piece stuck in between the bones. 

I’m getting surgery on September 30. 

I’m in way more pain than last time. Flexing hurts, extending hurts, and I’m generally bummed out. But I’m not giving up. I’ll try to figure out how to exercise with this new limitation, that should help the mental health situation. And I have a coffee date tomorrow, so I got that going for me, which is nice. 

So now I have a little over two weeks to survive until the surgery. Anything I should write about?",1,1757613806.0,MeniscusInjuries,0,1.0,False

A hosting company promising premium performance at prices lower than a cup of coffee? It sounded like yet another marketing trick.

But after migrating two of my sites to Hostinger and running independent tests for speed, uptime, and support, the results surprised me. In this Hostinger review, I’ll share what I found the good, the bad, and whether it’s really worth your money in 2025.

`Hostinger —` [`Activate 80% Off Hostinger deal`](https://webhostingpromo.com/reddit/hostinger) `( Use Coupon code: HOSTUP)`

**Quick Verdict: Is Hostinger Worth It in 2025?**

If you don’t have time to read the full review, here’s the short answer:

|Category|Score|Why It Matters|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Speed|9/10|LiteSpeed servers + global data centers make websites load under 2s in tests.|
|Uptime|9/10|Consistently between 99.95% and 100%, beating many premium hosts.|
|Ease of Use|10/10|hPanel is modern and beginner-friendly compared to outdated cPanel.|
|Features|8/10|Free SSL, domain, email, backups, and AI site builder included.|
|Pricing|9/10|Lowest entry-level prices in the market, but renewal jumps are steep.|
|Support|8/10|Live chat is responsive, but phone support is missing.|

**Overall Score: 8.8/10 – Hostinger is one of the best budget-friendly hosting options for beginners, bloggers, and small businesses in 2025.**

# Real-World Performance: Speed, Uptime, and Load Tests

**Website Speed**

Speed is critical for SEO and user experience. On a basic WordPress test site, Hostinger consistently delivered page load times below **2 seconds**—thanks to LiteSpeed technology and global caching.

* **LiteSpeed vs Apache:** LiteSpeed is faster and more efficient, giving Hostinger an edge over budget hosts like Bluehost or GoDaddy.
* **Global Reach:** With servers in the US, UK, Asia, and South America, your site can be hosted closer to your audience, reducing latency.

**Uptime & Reliability**

In 12 months of uptime tracking (via UptimeRobot), Hostinger stayed between 99.95% – 100% uptime, which means only a few minutes of downtime in a typical month.

**Load Handling**

When stress-tested with 50+ concurrent visitors, the site remained stable without major slowdowns. For blogs, portfolios, and small businesses, this level of performance is more than enough.

**Hostinger hPanel: Easier Than cPanel**

Instead of cPanel, Hostinger built its own dashboard called **hPanel**.

* **Clean Design:** Intuitive icons and layouts make it easy to set up WordPress, email, or SSL.
* **Beginner-Friendly:** Guided onboarding helps even first-time users launch a website in minutes.
* **Full Control:** Includes file manager, DNS editor, MySQL access, and backups without the clutter of cPanel.

For beginners, hPanel is a major advantage. For advanced users, it may feel different but still covers everything needed.

**Pricing & Renewal Explained**

Hostinger is famous for low prices, but here’s the truth:

|Plan|First Term Price|Renewal Price|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Premium Shared|$2.99/mo|$9.99/mo|
|Business Shared|$3.99/mo|$13.99/mo|
|Cloud Startup|$9.99/mo|$24.99/mo|

* **Cheap Intro Rates:** Perfect for starting out on a budget.
* **Renewal Trap:** Prices increase after the first term (common in the industry).
* **Pro Tip:** Lock in the 48-month plan to secure the maximum discount.

**Features That Add Value**

* Free domain name (first year)
* Free SSL for all websites
* Professional email accounts included
* AI-powered drag-and-drop website builder
* Weekly or daily automated backups

These extras make Hostinger especially attractive for small businesses and beginners who don’t want to buy add-ons separately.

**Hostinger vs Competitors**

|Host|Best For|Strengths|Weaknesses|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Hostinger|Beginners, bloggers, SMBs|Cheapest plans, fast LiteSpeed servers, hPanel|Renewal costs, no phone support|
|Bluehost|WordPress beginners|Official [WP.org](http://WP.org) recommendation, easy setup|Slower performance on shared hosting|
|SiteGround|Businesses needing top support|Excellent customer service, great reliability|Much higher pricing|
|Cloudways|Developers & growing businesses|Flexible cloud hosting, scalable resources|Not beginner-friendly, costs add up|

**Pros and Cons of Hostinger**

**Pros:**

* Extremely low starting prices
* Excellent speed for shared hosting
* Reliable uptime (near 100%)
* Beginner-friendly hPanel
* Free SSL, domain, backups, and email

**Cons:**

* Renewal prices jump significantly
* No phone support, only live chat
* hPanel feels unfamiliar if you’re used to cPanel

**FAQs About Hostinger**

**Q: Is Hostinger good for WordPress?**  
Yes. Hostinger offers 1-click WordPress installs, LiteSpeed caching, and optimized performance for small to medium WordPress sites.

**Q: Does Hostinger use cPanel?**  
No. Hostinger uses its own control panel called hPanel, which is easier for beginners.

**Q: Is Hostinger reliable?**  
Yes. With 99.95%+ uptime and solid performance tests, it’s one of the most reliable budget hosts available.

**Q: Who should avoid Hostinger?**  
If you run a large e-commerce store or need enterprise-level hosting, consider SiteGround, Kinsta, or Cloudways instead.

**Final Verdict: Should You Choose Hostinger in 2025?**

If you’re launching a blog, portfolio, or small business site, Hostinger is one of the best value-for-money hosting providers right now. It combines speed, uptime, and user-friendliness at an entry price that few competitors can match.

Yes, renewal rates are higher, but even then, Hostinger remains competitive. For beginners and cost-conscious users, it’s hard to beat in 2025.

**Best For:** Beginners, bloggers, small businesses.  
**Not Ideal For:** Users needing phone support.",6,1757613528.0,webhostingpromos,0,1.0,False

I recently read this fanfic that I ended up loving. So there's a specific scene in it that really tugged my heartstrings. MC1 and MC2 were co workers who were secretly dating for a year. MC1 had even bought a ring and was going to propose on their one year anniversary, but just a few days before that, MC2 just straight up breaks up with him and ghosts him without giving a proper explanation for ✨️reasons✨️ that we find out later. 

Now, MC1 and MC2 both turn into insane, grumpy workaholics who avoid each other at all costs. Six months after the breakup, they keep running into each other, and at one point, they kiss and have a one night stand. When they wake up in the morning, MC2 asks MC1 how he wants his coffee, and it completely shatters MC1 because he has been taking coffee a similar way the entire year they were together. He remembers exactly how MC2 took his tea, and he can't believe that MC2 forgot something as big as his coffee preferences. It makes him feel that their relationship was nothing to MC2 and he leaves heartbroken.

I am looking for a book (any book) which has a scene with a similar angsty vibe.

I don't really have any hard no's except I guess mpreg and poly.

1nefrc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thenextgenbusiness/comments/1nefrc0/scott_adams_fiery_call_to_tear_down_the/,Scott Adams’ fiery call to tear down the Democratic Party ignites debate over political reform in a polarized America.,"On September 11, 2025, Scott Adams, creator of the “Dilbert” comic strip, posted on X that the Democratic Party should be “ripped out by the roots,” stating he is “no longer content with the Democrat party existing in its current form with its current supporters.” This follows his history of controversial political commentary, including claims that Democrats promote destructive policies.    
  
Adams, a vocal Trump supporter, argued on his podcast that Republicans focus on solutions like economic growth and ending wars, while Democrats engage in “insanely destructive” actions like open borders and DEI policies. His remarks echo sentiments from a March 2025 Gateway Pundit article where he criticized Democrats for focusing on destruction over solutions.    
  
The statement has sparked mixed reactions on X, with some users agreeing the Democratic Party needs an overhaul due to perceived corruption, while others call Adams’ rhetoric dangerous and counterproductive. Critics argue his comments oversimplify complex political dynamics and fuel division.

1nefjuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1nefjuu/the_associate_john_grisham/,The Associate - John Grisham,"Hey everyone!

Just finished diving into **[The Associate - John Grisham](https://pdfhive.com/the-associate-john-grisham/)** and wanted to share my honest thoughts. If you're looking for a gripping read or thinking about picking up a legal thriller, stick around because this one definitely delivered on the suspense front!

***

### What's ""The Associate"" All About? (No Spoilers!)

So, imagine you're a brilliant, Yale-educated law student named Kyle McAvoy, with a super promising career ahead of you. Life's good, right? Well, not for Kyle. He's got a dark secret from his past, and suddenly, some very dangerous people know all about it. They blackmail him, forcing him to take a job at a prestigious New York law firm, but not for the reasons you'd think. He's an associate alright, but he's also a mole, tasked with stealing highly sensitive information. The whole book is about Kyle navigating this incredibly high-stakes situation, constantly looking over his shoulder, trying to outsmart ruthless criminals, and figuring out how to get his life back. It's a real nail-biter from start to finish.

***

### What I Really Liked

1.  **The Pacing is Fantastic:** Grisham is a master of keeping the story moving, and ""The Associate"" is no exception. From the very first page, you're pulled into Kyle's world, and the tension just builds and builds. I found myself tearing through chapters, always needing to know what would happen next. It's one of those books where you tell yourself ""just one more chapter"" and suddenly it's 2 AM. If you want to get lost in a story, grab **[The Associate - John Grisham](https://pdfhive.com/the-associate-john-grisham/)** and get ready for a wild ride.
2.  **Kyle's Predicament:** You really feel for Kyle. He's not a bad guy, just someone who made a mistake and is now paying a heavy price. His struggle to maintain his integrity while being forced into a criminal enterprise is truly compelling. You find yourself rooting for him, hoping he'll find a way out, and constantly wondering what *you* would do in his shoes.
3.  **Grisham's Signature Style:** The writing is clear, direct, and incredibly engaging. You don't need a law degree to understand what's going on, and he explains the legal world in a way that's easy to grasp. It makes the high-stakes corporate espionage feel very real and immediate.

***

### What I Thought Could Be Different

Honestly, there wasn't a whole lot I disliked, but if I had to pick something:

1.  **Character Depth (Occasionally):** While Kyle is well-developed in his struggle, some of the supporting characters, especially the ""bad guys,"" can feel a little one-dimensional. They serve their purpose in driving the plot, but you don't always get a deep dive into their motivations beyond being generally ruthless. It's a minor point though, as the focus is clearly on Kyle's journey.
2.  **A Few Predictable Moments:** There were one or two times where I could guess the general direction the plot was heading, but Grisham always threw in enough twists to keep it interesting and the execution was still fantastic. It never took away from the overall enjoyment.

***

### Would I Recommend It? Absolutely!

If you love thrillers, especially legal thrillers, this is a must-read. It's a fantastic entry point if you're new to John Grisham's work, or just looking for a suspenseful story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It's also great for anyone who enjoys a good underdog story with high stakes and moral dilemmas.

***

### For New Readers – Getting Started with Books!

Sometimes starting a new book, or even getting into reading, can feel a bit daunting. But it doesn't have to be! Here are a few friendly tips if you're looking to dive into the world of books, especially exciting ones like ""The Associate"":

1.  **Start with What Excites You:** Don't feel pressured to read classics if they don't appeal to you right now. If a book summary or a friend's recommendation (like mine for **[The Associate - John Grisham](https://pdfhive.com/the-associate-john-grisham/)**) sounds fun, go for it! Thrillers, fantasy, romance – whatever catches your eye.
2.  **Read a Little Bit Every Day:** You don't have to read for hours. Even 15-20 minutes during your commute, before bed, or with your morning coffee can make a huge difference. Those pages add up quickly!
3.  **It's Okay to Not Finish:** If a book isn't grabbing you, don't force it. Life's too short for books you're not enjoying. Put it down and pick up another one. There are literally millions of books out there!
4.  **Join a Community:** Talking about books with others, like here on Reddit, can make reading even more fun and help you discover new titles.

Reading should be enjoyable, not a chore. Books like ""The Associate"" are perfect for reminding you just how thrilling and immersive a story can be. Happy reading, everyone!",1,1757613031.0,pdfhive,0,1.0,False

# Key Features To Consider

Choosing the best single serve coffee maker can be overwhelming. With so many options, it’s crucial to focus on key features. These machines offer convenience and speed for coffee lovers. They brew one cup at a time, ensuring freshness. But what makes one model better than the other? Exploring key features can help you decide. Consider brew quality, speed and convenience, size and design, and ease of cleaning. Each feature plays a role in your daily coffee experience.

# Brew Quality

**Brew quality** is a top priority for many coffee enthusiasts. The right single serve coffee maker should deliver a rich and flavorful cup. Several factors influence brew quality:

* **Temperature Control:** The machine must heat water to the right temperature.
* **Pressure:** Adequate pressure ensures proper extraction of flavors.
* **Water Quality:** Clean water significantly affects the taste of your coffee.

Some machines use pods or capsules for brewing. These are pre-measured and sealed for freshness. Others use ground coffee, offering more control over strength and flavor. Look for models with **adjustable settings**. This allows you to customize your brew.

For the best taste, consider the type of coffee you enjoy. Machines that support multiple brew sizes and types provide more flexibility. Whether you like espresso or a regular cup, brew quality matters.

# Speed And Convenience

**Speed and convenience** are key reasons people choose single serve coffee makers. They are designed for quick and easy coffee preparation. No need to wait for a full pot to brew.

Some machines can brew a cup in under a minute. Fast brewing is perfect for busy mornings. A simple push-button operation adds to the convenience. Machines with programmable features let you set a timer. Wake up to freshly brewed coffee without any hassle.

Consider models with a **removable water reservoir**. This makes refilling easy and less frequent. A large reservoir means more cups before needing a refill. Also, check for automatic shut-off features. This saves energy and adds safety.

Convenience also comes from easy-to-use controls and clear instructions. The goal is to enjoy coffee without complicated steps.

# Size And Design

**Size and design** are important for fitting the coffee maker in your kitchen. A compact machine is ideal for small spaces. It should fit on a countertop without taking up too much room.

Consider the height and width of the machine. Ensure it fits under your cabinets or on your desk. The design should match your kitchen’s aesthetic. Sleek and modern designs add a touch of style.

|Feature|Importance|
|:-|:-|
|Compact Size|Essential for small kitchens|
|Modern Design|Enhances kitchen decor|
|Weight|Important for portability|

Look for machines with a **retractable cord** for easy storage. A lightweight model is easier to move. Choose a design that suits your taste and space needs.

# Ease Of Cleaning

**Ease of cleaning** affects how often you use your coffee maker. A machine that’s hard to clean may discourage regular use. Look for models with removable parts. This makes cleaning more manageable.

Parts that are dishwasher safe save time and effort. Regular cleaning ensures better-tasting coffee and extends the machine’s life. Some machines have self-cleaning cycles. These features simplify maintenance.

Consider the accessibility of the water reservoir and drip tray. Easy access allows for quick cleaning. Avoid models with too many crevices. These can trap coffee grounds and dirt.

Consistent cleaning is crucial for hygiene and taste. [Choose a coffee maker that makes this task simple and quick.](https://gomehedi.com/best-single-serve-coffee-maker/)

# Sustainability Factors

Choosing the best single-serve coffee maker involves more than just finding a machine that brews a good cup of coffee. Sustainability factors play a significant role in decision-making for environmentally conscious coffee lovers. These factors include the **use of eco-friendly pods**, the **energy efficiency** of the machine, and the **recyclable materials** used in its construction. Understanding these aspects can help you make a responsible choice, benefiting both you and the planet.

# Eco-friendly Pods

Eco-friendly pods are crucial for minimizing waste associated with single-serve coffee makers. Many traditional coffee pods end up in landfills, contributing to environmental damage. However, **eco-friendly pods** offer a sustainable alternative. Here are some key features:

* **Biodegradable materials**: Made from plant-based substances that break down naturally.
* **Compostable pods**: Can be added to compost piles, enriching the soil.
* **Reusable pods**: Allow users to fill with their own coffee, reducing waste.

These pods are designed to fit various machines, ensuring compatibility and ease of use. **Choosing eco-friendly pods** is a simple yet effective step towards reducing the ecological footprint of your daily coffee routine.

# Energy Efficiency

Energy efficiency is another critical factor for sustainable coffee makers. These machines often consume electricity, and their efficiency can affect your overall energy usage. Consider the following:

* **Automatic shut-off**: Saves power by turning off the machine when not in use.
* **Low wattage**: Reduces energy consumption during operation.
* **Quick heat-up times**: Less energy required to brew coffee quickly.

Energy-efficient coffee makers not only help the environment by reducing electricity use but also lower utility bills. **Opting for an energy-efficient model** ensures you enjoy your coffee with minimal impact on the planet. These machines maintain performance while being kinder to the environment.

# Maintenance Tips

Finding the best single serve coffee maker can be a delight for coffee lovers. These machines offer quick and convenient brews, perfect for one person. They save time and reduce waste by making just one cup. To ensure your coffee maker lasts, proper maintenance is vital. Regular upkeep keeps it running smoothly and ensures every cup tastes great. Below are some essential maintenance tips to help you keep your coffee maker in top shape.

# Regular Cleaning

Regular cleaning is crucial for the longevity of your single serve coffee maker. It prevents the buildup of coffee oils and residue. This buildup can affect the taste of your coffee. Follow these simple steps to clean your coffee maker:

* **Unplug the machine** before cleaning.
* **Remove the water reservoir** and wash it with warm, soapy water.
* **Wipe the exterior** with a damp cloth to remove dust and spills.
* **Clean the drip tray** and pod holder regularly.

Pay special attention to the needle that pierces the coffee pods. It can get clogged with grounds. Use a small brush or toothpick to gently clean it. For better results, run a cycle with water only. This helps remove any leftover residue inside the machine. Regular cleaning ensures your coffee tastes fresh every time.

# Descaling Process

Descaling is essential to remove mineral deposits from your coffee maker. Over time, minerals from water can build up inside. This affects the machine’s performance and the taste of your coffee. Follow these steps to descale your coffee maker:

* Fill the water reservoir with a **descaling solution** or a mix of vinegar and water.
* Run a brew cycle without a coffee pod.
* Repeat the cycle until the reservoir is empty.
* Rinse the machine by running a few cycles with fresh water.

Descaling should be done every 3-6 months, depending on the water hardness in your area. Regular descaling keeps your coffee maker in excellent condition and ensures optimal performance.

# Storage Recommendations

Proper storage of your single serve coffee maker is important when not in use. It helps maintain the machine’s condition and ensures it stays clean. Here are some storage tips:

* **Empty the water reservoir** before storing.
* **Clean all removable parts** thoroughly.
* Store the machine in a **cool, dry place**.
* Cover it with a **clean cloth** to prevent dust accumulation.

If storing for a long time, ensure the coffee maker is completely dry. Moisture can lead to mold growth. Keep the power cord neatly wrapped to avoid tangles. Following these storage tips will keep your coffee maker ready for use anytime you need it.

Sorry this is a bit long, but the context is important.

I (F24) and my boyfriend (M23, let’s call him Mark) have a very sweet love story. We met 1.5 years ago on a dating app. The same day we matched, he asked me out, and during our first date he already told me he had feelings for me and that I was exactly what he had been looking for. Normally I’d find that way too fast and even a bit creepy, but with him it felt genuine. After being mistreated in the past, i felt honored that someone could see my value so clearly form the second we met.

I didn’t want to rush the relationship, so we had many deep conversations first. We talked about the future, careers, childhood, and past relationships. For me, it’s important to know if someone has taken enough time after a breakup to be on their own, because I don’t want to be a rebound or deal with emotional baggage. Mark reassured me: he said he had been broken up for more than five months, had blocked his ex, and was completely over her. After two months of dating, we made it official.

Our relationship is amazing: he is sweet, respectful, funny, and caring. Even months in, I had nothing to complain about. We were already looking at apartments to move in together.

Until something happened. I sometimes work from home and would use his laptop. His WhatsApp was logged in there. At first, I closed it right away, but later I got curious and searched my name. I found sweet messages he sent to friends in the beginning. But I also found one where he compared me to his ex (in a positive way, saying I was very different from her). I saw her name, and out of curiosity I searched it. That’s when I discovered something shocking: Mark and his ex hadn’t broken up five months before we met, but only two weeks. He had lied.

I didn’t know how to bring it up without admitting I looked through his WhatsApp. For a few days I pretended nothing was wrong, even though it was eating me up inside. Coincidentally, I already had a coffee date planned with his mom. I gently steered the conversation and asked if she ever worried her son jumped into something new “too fast.” She reassured me but also told me that in the beginning, she was worried. She even sat mark down and had a few conversations about the whole timeline. But he told her over and over again that this was what he wanted. And now she couldn’t be happier with the path he chose. She did confirm the breakup had been much more recent and was very disappointed in the fact he lied to me. That was all I needed to know to confront him.

Later that day, i did , he broke down. He admitted it had only been two weeks when he met me. His ex had suddenly ended things, he was heartbroken, and joined a dating app. Not for distraction but because he got a screenshot of a friend that his ex was on Tinder. It was a petty action. But then he met me. Three weeks later mark’s ex wanted him back, but he refused because he said he had already fallen for me. She kept calling, texting, even showing up at his house. Even after we got official, he never blocked her, and she was still messaging him desperately to leave me and go back to her. Even liking and commenting on insta stories. He ignored all her text. But I don’t get why he just didn’t block her from the beginning. According to Mark, he lied because he thought if I knew the truth, I’d never give him a chance. He didn’t block her, because he felt bad for her and thought, if he would keep saying no, maybe she would eventually get it.

He emphasized that I’m his dream woman, that he’s never felt this way for anyone (not even his ex), and that he knew right away he wanted to be with me. But the fact remains: he lied, and he withheld information, and that makes me feel manipulated. he told me that he will block her on everything, he even showed me that he hasn’t replied in a few months.

My friends and family see how well he treats me and think I should give him a chance, since he never actually gave his ex another shot and clearly chose me. But I still doubt: can I really forgive this, or will I always wonder what else he might be hiding?",2,1757612771.0,AITH,1,1.0,False

I woke up today at 9:20am, mafe breakfast and afterwards had a 230mg cup of coffee
Im caffeine-naive and have no tolerance, but i wanted to experience something memorable, and that would help me complete tasks i had been procrastinating on. 

10-20 minutes: I felt nothing besides feeling a little bit hot
30 minutes: I started doing my online school work and I was able to complete 2 important tests! By this time, I started feeling the urge to get up and walk around,  I was so uncomfortable sitting, and starting to feel hot. 
40 minutes: this is when it started actually kicking in, I wanted to clean my closet since it had gotten pretty messy, and I was able to fold clothes, and organize things, all in 10 minutes. By this time I felt very physically hot and began to feel the sensation of my teeth-chattering when it's cold except it was my arms and legs that felt super ""chattery"" if you will, I was moving quickly, my heart rate was up from 60bpm to 90bpm and I could feel my head and throat having a slight heartbeat too. I felt wired, and it was almost a little overwhelming and I became super fast and jittery but not uncomfortably so.
50 minutes: I decided to put the energy to use and went out for a run, by this time I was absolutely caffeinated, my entire body was buzzing, I was talking fast and moving hyper, and the second I got out, I immediately started running super quickly and it felt like I was on fire!! I ran about 4mph in 2-3 minutes and my heart rate was around 140bpm and I felt energized and like i could handle anything! I ran all around my apartment complex and I even ran downhill too, I had to stop eventually. And then I just kept running in short bursts, I could feel energy burning and the same jittery/chattery feeling. I kept on walking quickly without any breaks and my heart rate was still high but no true tiredness/fatigue happened even once i got back, it's like I was just more powerful and energetic and immune to the usual tiredness and aches that happen after I run or workout, plus my breath control was wayyyyy better. 
1h and 20 minutes: my thoughts glowed freely when I was talking and I didn't have to pause and think about anything when I was talking, words and ideas just flowed perfectly fine and I still wasn't tired. 
2-3 hours: I'm back to normal, no fatigue, I ate lunch, and im fine now. Safe to say I'll be doing this again! Im usually pretty mellow and not too happy/sad/angry so being so hyped up like that was crazy.

1nefbaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nefbaw/the_barns_silent_tenant/,The Barn's Silent Tenant,"I never thought I'd end up back on that godforsaken plot of land my grandfather left me, but after the divorce, it was the only place I could afford to hole up and lick my wounds. The farm sat on the edge of a forgotten township in upstate New York, surrounded by fields gone wild and a stretch of woods that swallowed the horizon like a bad memory.

The house itself was a relic—peeling white paint, creaking floors, and windows that rattled in the slightest breeze. But the barn, that hulking red thing out back, always felt off to me, even as a kid visiting in the summers. Grandpa used to store hay and old machinery in there, but he never let us play inside. ""Barns got their own rules,"" he'd say, his voice dropping low like he was sharing a secret with the wind. I figured it was just old-man superstition, the kind that comes from too many years alone with the cornstalks.

I moved in late fall, when the leaves were rotting underfoot and the air carried that sharp, metallic tang of impending snow. The first night, I unpacked what little I had: a few boxes of clothes, some books, and a bottle of whiskey to blunt the edges. The barn loomed in the backyard, its doors chained shut with a rusty padlock that looked like it hadn't been touched in decades. I didn't bother with it. Why would I? I wasn't planning on farming; I just needed a roof and some quiet.

But quiet isn't what I got. It started with the sounds—soft at first, like something settling in the dark. I'd be in the kitchen, boiling water for coffee, and hear a faint scrape from outside, muffled through the walls. Not the wind, though it howled plenty out there. This was deliberate, like fingernails dragging across wood. I'd step onto the porch, flashlight in hand, and shine it toward the barn. Nothing. Just shadows pooling under the eaves, and that endless field stretching into black.

By the third day, I convinced myself it was animals. Squirrels, maybe, or raccoons nesting in the rafters. The barn was old, after all—boards warped from years of neglect, gaps wide enough for critters to slip through. I decided to check it out, more out of boredom than anything. The chain on the doors was brittle; one good yank with a crowbar, and it snapped like dry bone. The doors groaned open, releasing a puff of dust that smelled of mold and something sweeter, like overripe fruit left to ferment.

Inside, it was dim, the air thick with floating motes that caught the weak sunlight filtering through cracks. Hay bales stacked unevenly against one wall, rusted tools hanging from hooks, and in the corner, an old tractor covered in a tarp, its tires flat and cracked. I poked around, half-expecting to find a nest or droppings, but there was nothing. No signs of life at all. Just that lingering sweetness in the air, cloying now, sticking to the back of my throat.

As I turned to leave, I noticed the loft. A rickety ladder led up to it, the wood splintered and dark with age. Grandpa had mentioned it once, saying he kept ""odds and ends"" up there, but his eyes always flicked away when he talked about it. Curiosity got the better of me. I climbed, each rung protesting under my weight, and pulled myself into the space above. It was empty, mostly—just more dust and shadows, with a single window smeared in grime. But in the far corner, tucked against the rafters, there was a shape. Not much, just a bundle of old blankets, frayed and stained. I approached slowly, the floorboards creaking like they were alive. The sweetness was stronger here, almost nauseating, mixed with something metallic, like blood.

I peeled back a corner of the blanket. Underneath was a small wooden box, no bigger than a shoebox, its lid carved with crude symbols—swirls and lines that didn't make sense, like a child's attempt at writing. I opened it. Inside, nestled in faded cloth, were bones. Small ones, fragile and yellowed. Animal bones, I told myself—maybe from birds or field mice that Grandpa had collected for some reason. But they were arranged too neatly, almost reverently, with bits of twine tying some together in odd patterns. And there, at the bottom, a scrap of paper with Grandpa's handwriting: ""It stays quiet if you feed it.""

I shoved the box back and scrambled down the ladder, heart pounding in my ears. Outside, the wind had picked up, whipping through the fields, but the barn felt heavier somehow, like it was holding its breath. That night, the scraping returned, louder, closer. Not from the barn anymore, but from inside the house—under the floorboards, maybe, or in the walls. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, telling myself it was the house settling, the cold contracting the wood. But sleep didn't come easy. When it did, dreams crept in: visions of the barn loft, the bones shifting, reassembling into something that watched me with hollow eyes.

The next morning, I found footprints in the frost outside the barn doors. Not mine— these were bare, human-shaped but wrong, the toes elongated, like they'd been stretched. They led from the barn toward the house, stopping just at the porch steps. I followed them back, but they vanished into the grass. Inside the barn again, the air felt thicker, the sweetness now undercut by rot. The loft ladder seemed to beckon. I climbed, dreading what I'd find. The box was there, but the blankets were disturbed, bunched up as if something had been sleeping in them. And the bones— they were gone. No, not gone. Rearranged on the floor in a circle, with fresh scraps of what looked like fur and feathers scattered around.

I bolted from the barn, locked the doors as best I could with a new chain from town. But town was a twenty-minute drive on winding backroads, and by the time I got back, the sun was dipping low, painting the fields in bruised purples. That evening, as I sat in the living room nursing a drink, I heard it—not scraping this time, but a low hum, vibrating through the walls. Like breathing, slow and rhythmic, coming from the direction of the barn. I tried to ignore it, turned on the radio for noise, but the static only amplified the sound, twisting it into whispers that almost formed words.

Paranoia set in like fog. Every shadow in the house seemed to shift when I wasn't looking, and the fields outside felt alive, watching. I called my cousin, the only family I had left, but the line crackled with interference. ""Grandpa had stories about that place,"" he said, his voice distant. ""Said there was a tenant in the barn, something that came with the land. He fed it scraps to keep it quiet."" I laughed it off, but my voice cracked. That night, the humming grew louder, seeping into my dreams. I saw the bones again, but now they were knitting together with sinew and skin, forming a figure that crouched in the loft, its limbs too long, its face a mask of stretched flesh.

Dawn broke gray and cold. I couldn't take it anymore. Armed with a flashlight and the crowbar, I marched to the barn. The new chain was intact, but the doors were ajar, as if pried open from inside. The sweetness hit me like a wave, now mingled with the coppery stench of fresh blood. Up the ladder, the loft was a nightmare. Feathers and fur everywhere, slick with red, and in the center, the figure from my dreams— not fully formed, but close. It was huddled in the blankets, its body a patchwork of bone and hide, limbs folded unnaturally. It didn't move, but I felt its gaze, heavy and ancient, like the weight of the land itself pressing down.

I swung the crowbar, blind with terror. It connected with something soft, yielding, and a wet crunch echoed through the barn. The thing let out a sound—not a scream, but a sigh, long and rattling, like air escaping a punctured lung. I hit it again and again, until the shape dissolved into fragments, bones scattering across the floor. Panting, I stumbled back, covered in gore that wasn't just blood— it was thick, viscous, clinging like sap.

But as I descended, a new sound rose: a faint scraping, not from the loft, but from deeper in the barn, behind the hay bales. I froze. There, in the dim light, another shape stirred— smaller, but identical, its limbs unfolding slowly. And beyond it, more shadows, humming in unison.

I ran. Locked myself in the house, barricaded the doors. That was two days ago. The scraping circles the house now, patient, persistent. The fields whisper when the wind dies down, and the barn doors creak open at night. I don't know what Grandpa brought to that land, or what it became, but it's not alone anymore. It's multiplying, feeding on whatever scraps it can find. And I'm the only thing left out here.

1nefb84,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1nefb84/am_i_overreacting_by_considering_to_break_up_with/,"Am I overreacting, by considering to break up with my boyfriend, because he wasn’t honest how his last relationship ended?","Hey Charlotte, first of all congratulations on your wedding! I originally posted this on AITA but I think this is a better fit. I could really use some advice. Sorry this is a bit long, but the context is important.

I (F24) and my boyfriend (M23, let’s call him Mark) have a very sweet love story. We met 1.5 years ago on a dating app. The same day we matched, he asked me out, and during our first date he already told me he had feelings for me and that I was exactly what he had been looking for. Normally I’d find that way too fast and even a bit creepy, but with him it felt genuine. After being mistreated in the past, i felt honored that someone could see my value so clearly form the second we met.

I didn’t want to rush the relationship, so we had many deep conversations first. We talked about the future, careers, childhood, and past relationships. For me, it’s important to know if someone has taken enough time after a breakup to be on their own, because I don’t want to be a rebound or deal with emotional baggage. Mark reassured me: he said he had been broken up for more than five months, had blocked his ex, and was completely over her. After two months of dating, we made it official.

Our relationship is amazing: he is sweet, respectful, funny, and caring. Even months in, I had nothing to complain about. We were already looking at apartments to move in together.

Until something happened. I sometimes work from home and would use his laptop. His WhatsApp was logged in there. At first, I closed it right away, but later I got curious and searched my name. I found sweet messages he sent to friends in the beginning. But I also found one where he compared me to his ex (in a positive way, saying I was very different from her). I saw her name, and out of curiosity I searched it. That’s when I discovered something shocking: Mark and his ex hadn’t broken up five months before we met, but only two weeks. He had lied.

I didn’t know how to bring it up without admitting I looked through his WhatsApp. For a few days I pretended nothing was wrong, even though it was eating me up inside. Coincidentally, I already had a coffee date planned with his mom. I gently steered the conversation and asked if she ever worried her son jumped into something new “too fast.” She reassured me but also told me that in the beginning, she was worried. She even sat mark down and had a few conversations about the whole timeline. But he told her over and over again that this was what he wanted. And now she couldn’t be happier with the path he chose. She did confirm the breakup had been much more recent and was very disappointed in the fact he lied to me. That was all I needed to know to confront him.

Later that day, i did , he broke down. He admitted it had only been two weeks when he met me. His ex had suddenly ended things, he was heartbroken, and joined a dating app. Not for distraction but because he got a screenshot of a friend that his ex was on Tinder. It was a petty action. But then he met me. Three weeks later mark’s ex wanted him back, but he refused because he said he had already fallen for me. She kept calling, texting, even showing up at his house. Even after we got official, he never blocked her, and she was still messaging him desperately to leave me and go back to her. Even liking and commenting on insta stories. He ignored all her text. But I don’t get why he just didn’t block her from the beginning. According to Mark, he lied because he thought if I knew the truth, I’d never give him a chance. He didn’t block her, because he felt bad for her and thought, if he would keep saying no, maybe she would eventually get it.

He emphasized that I’m his dream woman, that he’s never felt this way for anyone (not even his ex), and that he knew right away he wanted to be with me. But the fact remains: he lied, and he withheld information, and that makes me feel manipulated. he told me that he will block her on everything, he even showed me that he hasn’t replied in a few months.

My friends and family see how well he treats me and think I should give him a chance, since he never actually gave his ex another shot and clearly chose me. But I still doubt: can I really forgive this, or will I always wonder what else he might be hiding?",1,1757612492.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

1nefaop,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1nefaop/just_had_my_first_colonoscopy_at_41_tips_tricks/,"Just had my first colonoscopy at 41 — tips, tricks, and a realistic timeline to make it WAY easier (including clear protein!)","I’m 41 and just had my first screening colonoscopy today. The procedure went smoothly, and they found two benign polyps, which were removed on the spot. I wanted to share my experience to make someone else’s prep and procedure day easier — especially if you’re on the younger side and unsure what to expect.

⸻

1. Clear protein saved me

One of the hardest parts of prep day is going 24 hours on clear liquids only. Most people don’t realize that not all protein drinks are allowed — almost all are opaque, which can interfere with the scope visibility.

I used Isopure Clear Protein (looked like watered down yellow gatorade once mixed with water). It’s completely transparent, tastes like a sports drink, and gave me 60g of protein throughout the day.
This kept my energy up and stopped the extreme hunger that a lot of people complain about. If you’re prone to feeling weak while fasting, this is a game changer.

⸻

2. Skin care = lifesaver

Once the SUPREP kicks in… you’re going to the bathroom a lot. The constant wiping can really irritate your skin.

Here’s what worked perfectly for me:
	•	Boudreaux’s Butt Paste – apply before your first prep dose, and reapply every few trips.
	•	Defense Wipes – gentle, unscented wipes instead of dry toilet paper.
	•	A final barrier cream application before bed for overnight protection.

This completely prevented the burning and soreness that people often warn about.

⸻

3. The prep itself

My doctor had me use SUPREP, a two-part split dose:
	•	First dose at 5 PM
	•	Second dose at 9 PM

FWIW: The nurse said she prefers miralax method as she can mix it with any clear drink and it tastes better.

What SUPREP tastes like:
To me, it tasted like grape Robitussin, not bad at first, but with a horrible (7 out of 10) lingering aftertaste. My strategy:
	•	Take a big gulp of SUPREP quickly.
	•	Immediately chase with just a sip of water to wash the taste away without diluting the cleanse.

What it feels like:
When it kicks in, it’s huge, explosive, water-based bowel movements, almost like very controlled diarrhea.
The difference is that it’s totally comfortable, unlike being sick:
	•	No gas, no bile, no stomach bug burning or cramping.
	•	It’s just clean, clear water rushing through — surprisingly manageable.

The first round does the heavy lifting, and the second round polishes everything so your output is totally clear.

⸻

4. My timeline

Here’s how it played out for me step-by-step:
	•	Sunday night: Last time I had any roughage/raw vegetables.
	•	Tuesday night: Last solid meal — very low fiber (rice, chicken, no veggies).
	•	Wednesday – Clear liquid day:
	•	Morning: Coffee, coconut water, Isopure Clear Protein.
	•	4:00 PM: Two Dulcolax tablets to kickstart things.
	•	5:00 PM: SUPREP dose #1 + 32 oz water.
	•	6:00 PM: Bathroom action begins, several trips, progressively clearer.
	•	9:00 PM: SUPREP dose #2 + 32 oz water.
	•	By 11:30 PM: Output totally pale yellow → clear.
	•	Thursday morning – Procedure day:
	•	7:00 AM: Final clear liquid BM, fully ready.
	•	8:00 AM: Arrive at clinic for check-in.
	•	8:30 AM: Nurse preps IV, vitals, paperwork.
	•	9:30 AM: Doctor arrives, anesthesia starts.
	•	10:00 AM: Wake up in recovery, groggy but comfortable.
	•	10:30 AM: Discharged with zero pain or discomfort.

⸻

5. Why this matters

I’m 41, and guidelines just recently lowered the starting age for screening colonoscopies to 45 (or earlier if you have risk factors).
Even though I’m on the younger side, they found two polyps — both benign now, but one was precancerous.
Catching and removing them now likely prevented colon cancer down the road.
If you’re on the fence about scheduling, don’t wait.

⸻

6. Quick takeaways
	•	Clear protein like Isopure – massive game changer on prep day.
	•	Butt Paste + Defense Wipes – your skin will thank you.
	•	Follow the prep instructions exactly — especially the timing.
	•	SUPREP is unpleasant but manageable if you drink it ice cold and chase with a sip of water.
	•	A clean prep = one-and-done procedure.

⸻

If anyone has questions about the process, prep timing, or products, I’m happy to help.

What confuses me is the grinder knob. When people say “make it finer,” does that mean turning it counter-clockwise or the other way around? The manual says “left or right,” but that’s not very clear (i swear to god).



I also kinda moved it once while the machine was off (oops 🙈). The coffee still comes out, and actually right now it does taste a bit better than before, but I’m still curious if I’ve got it set the right way or if I just got lucky.



I just want the coffee to come out stronger, with the bean flavors I’m paying for. Any tips from people who actually know how to set this thing up would be amazing. Thanks in advance, and sorry again if I sound stupid.

  
Btw: It's from 1 to 12

Hey folks 👋 I launched a micro SaaS - [Animoji](https://animojiapp.vercel.app/) as a side project last week — basically a library of animated icons for developers.

I priced it at **$4 one-time for lifetime use**.

Honestly thought nobody would pay, but within the first 24 hrs I got **4 paying users 🎉**

Here’s what actually worked vs. what was a waste:

✅ **What worked:**

* Kept pricing super low-friction (less than coffee = no-brainer).
* Shipped a barebones MVP fast instead of polishing forever.
* Shared the build story — people engaged more with the journey than the product.

👉 You can check it out here: [https://animojiapp.vercel.app/](https://animojiapp.vercel.app/)

❌ **What didn’t:**

* Overbuilding UI (nobody cared yet).
* SEO/blog posts (0 traffic early).
* Cold DMs → total waste.

It’s still super early, but this was my first time seeing Stripe emails hit, and it felt *real*.

I’m planning to add more icons + a cleaner UI over time so it can grow into a proper dev resource.

* **Objective**: A graphic arts company
* **Target Audience**: Men between the ages 25-50. They may enjoy vintage things such as old barber shops, bourbon, coffee, cigars, antiques, industrial factories, and rustic art and design. He purchases items for their quality and all-natural materials. This customer owns a business which may focus on the things mentioned above. They value tradition, and yet are a forward thinker. They most likely live in a suburban or urban area along the coast. They enjoy brands that feel masculine, luxurious, yet grounded.
   * When looking for a designer, this customer is looking for a company that's grounded, reliable, straightforward, rational, and creative. They also look for companies they can trust and that puts them at ease. This may include companies with a sense of humor that targets men in a casual yet witty way. 
* **Problem**: As of now, I'm debating on the color palette. Namely whether the compass should be this teal navy, brown, or black. The teal gives a nice pop of color, but it also reads as cartoonish at times, the brown gives a nice vintage look but I worry that it's not striking enough. The black makes this feel a bit more clean/modern, but I feel like it's too high of contrast? Either way, the gear/clock is going to be this brass color which is the main color.

I was put on a lot of medications over the past years that made me gain a lot of weight and become very unhealthy. I am trying to reverse this so i can feel more comfortable in my body. I am also petite, so my calorie intake will seem a bit smaller than expected. I am not good at exercising (i’m a smoker with asthma) so I decided to start small and work my way up in combination with weening off smoking. I have a full time office job, that is about a mile and a half from my house. I always walk to work, but usually get a ride home. The walk home is entirely uphill (appalachian things). Also, i’m a very picky eater, and tend to eat the same foods day to day, so i’ve chosen the healthiest foods that i enjoy. Without further ado, here’s my list. 

nutrients: 
- 35 grams fat daily max
- 75 grams protein min
- 100 grams carbs max
4 cups veggies daily min
2 cups fruit daily (whatever idk) 
15 cups water daily min

diet/excerise: 
( no food before 8 am or after 7 pm )
sunday - water fast, 500 calories 
monday - 1500 cals 
tuesday - 1600 cals, 30 mins weight training 
wednesday - 1500 cals, walk home   
thursday - 1600 cals, 30 min weight training 
friday - 1300 cals, walk home 
saturday - cheat day!!!! :p

vitamins: 
- multivitamin morning and night 
- electrolyte morning 
- creatine morning and night 
- magnesium bedtime 
- alli bedtime 

meal plan: 

breakfast - one cup coffee, konjac jelly, two boiled eggs, cucumber and apple 

snack - protein shake 

lunch - deli turkey or canned chicken w/ celery, cucumber and carrots, yogurt with granola, strawberries and apple, cup of veggies of choice. 

snack (after work) - smoothie! :p

dinner - high protein main dish, a carb, two cups veggie of choice, 

desert - fruit bowl w/ chocolate or cream, or a cookie. 


vices: 

- no more than 5 cigarettes a day 
- can have alcohol on friday or saturday, if i chose (in moderation), but must have enough water to compensate 
- cheat day saturdays must still meet nutritional goals, but can abandon calorie limits and indulge in sugar and salt (still no extra fat, will poop your pants if you do.) 


Im specifically looking for advice with my nutrients and vitamins intake, and ways I can incorporate those into my meals
more, so if anybody has tips that’d be greatly appreciated. 
Thank you!!

She completely gave up soda three months ago but hasn’t changed anything else. She drinks one sugary coffee per day, eats one pack of peanut M&Ms with lunch, has 5 oreos with milk for her afternoon snack, then 5 more after dinner for dessert.

I just want her to be around for a long time and I don’t know if giving up the soda is good enough. I just want to tread lightly. Is it concerning that she has so much sugar? I’m sure that’s close to 100g of processed sugar a day. I grew up with parents who made me watch that stuff, and she didn’t.

Depending on age of home, masonry should be reviewed prior to staining, to ensure mortar is not flaking, running or missing.  Thank you, please check out the video for our before and after.     
  
Chicagoland Brick Stain Project – Mole Claro with Coffee Crisp Accents  
  
This Chicagoland home was transformed using our Mineral Stains Sol-Silicate Masonry Stain in the new Mole Claro color, accented with Coffee Crisp. The application was performed by our partners at Midwest Brick Stain, who specialize in bringing Mineral Stains products to life on real homes across the Chicagoland area.  
  
Brick & Stucco Application  
  
One of the standout advantages of our Sol-Silicate formula is its versatility. On this project, Midwest Brick Stain applied Mole Claro not only to the brick but also to the stucco, including areas that had been previously painted. Unlike traditional coatings, Sol-Silicate bonds directly to both bare and painted masonry, creating a long-lasting, breathable finish.  
  
Chimney Rebuild & Crown Upgrade  
  
The chimney had experienced heavy moisture damage. Midwest Brick Stain set up scaffolding to remove deteriorated brick, rebuilt the top section, and finished the project with a new concrete overhung crown. This design provides better water shedding, protecting the chimney from future leaks and freeze-thaw damage.  
  
Benefits of Mineral Stains Sol-Silicate  
  
6x more breathable than latex or acrylic paints  
  
Permanently bonds to brick, stone, stucco, and even existing paint  
  
UV-stable mineral pigments provide unmatched color longevity  
  
Custom color matching for seamless design integration — Mole Claro was created to closely match this home’s siding

Hey folks 👋 I launched a micro SaaS - [Animoji](https://animojiapp.vercel.app/) as a side project last week — basically a library of animated icons for developers.

I priced it at **$4 one-time for lifetime use**.

Honestly thought nobody would pay, but within the first 24 hrs I got **4 paying users 🎉**

Here’s what actually worked vs. what was a waste:

✅ **What worked:**

* Kept pricing super low-friction (less than coffee = no-brainer).
* Shipped a barebones MVP fast instead of polishing forever.
* Shared the build story — people engaged more with the journey than the product.

👉 You can check it out here: [https://animojiapp.vercel.app/](https://animojiapp.vercel.app/)

❌ **What didn’t:**

* Overbuilding UI (nobody cared yet).
* SEO/blog posts (0 traffic early).
* Cold DMs → total waste.

It’s still super early, but this was my first time seeing Stripe emails hit, and it felt *real*.

I’m planning to add more icons + a cleaner UI over time so it can grow into a proper dev resource.

Has anyone here built **one-time fee SaaS / micro tools** before? Curious how you scaled.

I sat down with my boyfriend last week to get some tacos at a local place.  I picked up my taco, took a bite, and breathed in while he started to talk.  I started literally choking.  He just sat there and watched me.  I got up, knowing he wouldn't help and made myself cough it up.  I think standing up cleared my airway .

After I came back to the table, I said, wow I could have choked to death and you're just sitting there ( although I wasn't surprised ). He goes ""you should have told me you were choking!!!!"" Literally said that. Lmao

Here is the problem as if you couldn't see it. My boyfriend NEVER gets up to help me.  If Im walking and I drop my keys, his head is up his ass.  He would literally stumble over me trying to get my keys before he paid attention and helped me. If I drop my jacket, wallet, etc he NEVER helps.  At this point I knew he was going to offer zero help with choking
 

He gets really mad and complains about a lot of things.  He's a huge pot smoker.  On top of that he is a coward.

We went to get some coffee before exercising the other week and pulled out of a parking space on the road.  A car was rushing and so my boyfriend brake checked the man.  He was mad that someone rushed him.  It caused a scene with a bunch of people on the street screaming at my boyfriend to leave so he hopped out of the car to see if there was damage.  My boyfriend stood there, stammering and studdering when this guy walking down the street came over to cuss him out telling him to leave and threaten to kick his ass.  

Although I totally agreed that the guy who hit us was in the wrong and rudely rushing a car pulling out of a parking spot, what happened after with my boyfriend's meltdown just made me cringe. And as you can guess, that was the topic for the rest of the day.

As an observer of this for a long time, he is most definitely a coward.  It's something that bothers me 

I remember growing up and learning there are 4 types of people 

Aggressive,
Passive aggressive,
Passive,
Assertive.

Assertive being the best way to go, especially in professional settings, and I totally agree 


To add, my boyfriend has been fired and put on pips for having a lack of emotional intelligence at work.  This is a pattern that he isn't learning from.

 


I feel we spend entirely too much together but we take breaks, often, however I find it very unattractive how he can't be courageous and how he can't man up at work and in normal every day situations. He constantly has to numb every situation with smoking.

He's definitely not a type ""A"" in the conventional definition, but who is? I would be perfectly happy with a nerdy sweet partner, that's not the issue.  But when shit hits the fan, he starts acting scared and it's so instinctually unattractive to me.


Anyone else share the same sentiments with seeking a real life hero???

It just makes me think, I'd like to be a girl for once.  I'd like to be unaware and unknowing of the danger that is approaching and have then a hero saves me!!!
 (Daydreams sarcastically)

Any advice at all is appreciated 

Now that I read this, it's like we are an old extremely dysfunctional couple.

Right now, I find my clients (and my clients find me) via another Reddit profile, where I write informational posts and respond to students' questions in several college-related forums. 

Right now, the ideas that I have are:

* Put up flyers advertising my services around the major public magnet high schools and private schools, coffee shops, and community centers
* Take out an advertisement in a local magazine for parents (might be a bit too pricy for me)
* Join local Facebook groups and market my services there (just difficult to find them, as they're often run by consultants who don't want other people pitching)

I’ve been following your socials and it looked absolutely beautiful. That being said, 

I’m dealing with a dilemma right now and could really use some ADVICE!!! Sorry this is a bit long, but the context is important.

I (F24) and my boyfriend (M23, let’s call him Mark) have a very sweet love story. We met 1.5 years ago on a dating app. The same day we matched, he asked me out, and during our first date he already told me he had feelings for me and that I was exactly what he had been looking for. Normally I’d find that way too fast and even a bit creepy, but with him it felt genuine. After being mistreated in the past, i felt honored that someone could see my value so clearly form the second we met.

I didn’t want to rush the relationship, so we had many deep conversations first. We talked about the future, careers, childhood, and past relationships. For me, it’s important to know if someone has taken enough time after a breakup to be on their own, because I don’t want to be a rebound or deal with emotional baggage. Mark reassured me: he said he had been broken up for more than five months, had blocked his ex, and was completely over her. After two months of dating, we made it official.

Our relationship is amazing: he is sweet, respectful, funny, and caring. Even months in, I had nothing to complain about. We were already looking at apartments to move in together.

Until something happened. I sometimes work from home and would use his laptop. His WhatsApp was logged in there. At first, I closed it right away, but later I got curious and searched my name. I found sweet messages he sent to friends in the beginning. But I also found one where he compared me to his ex (in a positive way, saying I was very different from her). I saw her name, and out of curiosity I searched it. That’s when I discovered something shocking: Mark and his ex hadn’t broken up five months before we met, but only two weeks. He had lied.

I didn’t know how to bring it up without admitting I looked through his WhatsApp. For a few days I pretended nothing was wrong, even though it was eating me up inside. Coincidentally, I already had a coffee date planned with his mom. I gently steered the conversation and asked if she ever worried her son jumped into something new “too fast.” She reassured me but also told me that in the beginning, she was worried. She even sat mark down and had a few conversations about the whole timeline. But he told her over and over again that this was what he wanted. And now she couldn’t be happier with the path he chose. She did confirm the breakup had been much more recent and was very disappointed in the fact he lied to me. That was all I needed to know to confront him.

Later that day, i did , he broke down. He admitted it had only been two weeks when he met me. His ex had suddenly ended things, he was heartbroken, and joined a dating app. Not for distraction but because he got a screenshot of a friend that his ex was on Tinder. It was a petty action. But then he met me. Three weeks later mark’s ex wanted him back, but he refused because he said he had already fallen for me. She kept calling, texting, even showing up at his house. Even after we got official, he never blocked her, and she was still messaging him desperately to leave me and go back to her. Even liking and commenting on insta stories. He ignored all her text. But I don’t get why he just didn’t block her from the beginning. According to Mark, he lied because he thought if I knew the truth, I’d never give him a chance. He didn’t block her, because he felt bad for her and thought, if he would keep saying no, maybe she would eventually get it.

He emphasized that I’m his dream woman, that he’s never felt this way for anyone (not even his ex), and that he knew right away he wanted to be with me. But the fact remains: he lied, and he withheld information, and that makes me feel manipulated. he told me that he will block her on everything, he even showed me that he hasn’t replied in a few months.

My friends and family see how well he treats me and think I should give him a chance, since he never actually gave his ex another shot and clearly chose me. But I still doubt: can I really forgive this, or will I always wonder what else he might be hiding?",2,1757611751.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,1.0,False
1neezfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIpoweredInfluencer/comments/1neezfq/stop_the_presses_apps_are_secretly_paying_normal/,STOP THE PRESSES: Apps Are Secretly Paying Normal People to TEST Unreleased Features—Here’s How to Cash In! 💸🤯,"Okay, WHY did no one tell me there are legit apps that literally Pay. You. To. TEST. Features?!?!

I am actually sitting here, SHOCKED. Not just like…a little giggly shocked, but full-blown cartoon eyes flying out of my head. I just lost 30 minutes spiraling into research—trying to see if these are actually legit and not some scammy nonsense. Random people testing unreleased features and getting paid?! It sounds illegal, but it's totally a thing for 2025.

If you’re as confused (and low-key hyped) as I am right now, prepare yourself. Here are the Top 7 Legit Apps that actually put money in your pocket to test new features, and no, you don’t need to be a developer or genius hacker. I wish I knew this SOONER:

- **1. TestApp by GoodNovel** – Hands-down, my biggest surprise. Get paid for trying out story-based apps and giving feedback on new features. Again, NOT a scam. Check for yourself here: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**. I’m literally seeing proof of deposits all over TikTok.

- **2. BetaBound** – The classic. This platform collects ALL kinds of beta tests: apps, gadgets, you name it. You often get early access to stuff no one else has seen & they PAY.

- **3. UserTesting** – Yes, this is still going strong in 2025. Apps/websites give you quick tests, record your thoughts, and pay decent cash. Super quick feedback loop too.

- **4. PlayTestCloud** – Gamers, are you seeing this?!?! Just PLAY unreleased mobile games, give feedback, and apparently you can cash out same week. Repeat: test, play, MONEY.

- **5. uTest** – A little more technical, but so worth it. Test everything from apps to IoT gadgets. The payout can get wild, especially on specialized tests.

- **6. PollPay** – Less hyped, but you actually get micro-payouts for testing tiny updates and new features in apps. Sneaky side money if you’re already a Tapjoy/offerwall person.

- **7. Google User Research Panel** – This is like being part of the CIA for tech. They pull you in for feature reviews and the payments are bigger if you’re quick. Yes, it’s actually Google.

I am so confused why this isn’t all over the news. Like, there are hundreds (NO EXAGGERATION) of jobs right now looking for regular folks to beta test and give opinions…and apps are literally fighting over you for feedback.

Also, don’t just read this and wander off! The **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** app is the gateway drug — so many people swear by it that I actually just signed up. Sneak peek? Some people are making more with **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** than their monthly coffee budget! (Which is a lot.)

I felt weirdly sus at first. But turns out, it’s honestly an easy side hustle and not cringe at all. Sign up, give feedback, **get paid via https://goodnovel.org/testapp**!

Has anyone else actually tested one of these and gotten paid? Confess in the comments, because my mind is STILL blown.",1,1757611749.0,AIpoweredInfluencer,0,1.0,False
1neex2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1neex2c/ashenwood/,Ashenwood,"The funeral was quiet, just like my brother Elowen was. Even the birds were quiet as I looked down at the empty casket, the sound of folding chairs being dragged across the damp grass below. I stood the whole time with my hands in my coat pockets. I didn’t speak. Eyes dry. Waiting for something inside me to break. It didn’t.



A week later, the envelope came.



No return address on the back. Just a white envelope with Elowen's name on it, it nearly matched my brother's blocky handwriting. Inside: a folded map of Ashen County, a scrap torn from Elowen’s old sketchpad, and a single sentence written in smudged pencil:



*You have to see it. You’ll understand when you do.*



I turned the note over. On the back, just in the corner, were three small vertical slashes, inked so faintly they could have been accidental. But something about them held my attention.



Three lines, almost like a claw scratch.



My eyes glided across the map looking at the old trail where my brother had gone missing. I recognized the trail marked in red. I had drawn it myself years ago, when we used to hike Ashenwood together- before the state sealed the forest after the fire.



I didn’t tell anyone I was going, I didn’t even lock the door behind me. I just grabbed my boots, the camera bag that still smelled like river water, and left before the sun climbed over the hills.

Ashenwood was supposed to be closed. The wildfire a year ago- An “uncontrolled burn,” the papers said- left most of the forest brittle and black. The rangers strung up wire fencing and metal signs that screamed *NO TRESPASSING* in bold red, as if that would stop the curious or the grieving.

I thought I’d have to climb something or cut through. But the gate was already open.

It didn’t creak or groan. Just swung gently, like someone had passed through minutes before me. I hesitated, I thought I heard… humming. Faint, tuneless, just past the trees. I told myself it was wind, or maybe the low voltage hum of a power line somewhere out of sight.

Still, I waited for a while. 

Then entered.

The cold bit harder the deeper I walked. It was early autumn, but here, it felt like winter was practicing. Everything was too still. Leaves didn’t fall. Birds didn’t chirp. My boots crunched over dead grass in slow, hollow beats.

Three steps.

Pause.

Three more.

I didn’t notice the rhythm until I looked back. My footprints behind me-  just three of them-  then nothing.

I step once further and turn back, Three footprints. Not one more. Just trees closing behind me like I was never supposed to turn around.

The trail was narrower than I remembered.



Branches reached lower now, like the trees had grown heavy with something they couldn’t name. My map crinkled with every few steps as I kept checking it, though the turns were burned into my memory. I hadn’t walked this path in years, but my legs moved like I never left.



I passed the old mile marker- just a splintered wooden post, no numbers left- but I remembered it used to read “1.11.” I stared at the base for a moment. A pale mushroom had grown from the stump. Three caps, perfectly stacked.



We used to call this part Stillwood. Even before the fire, it was quiet here. Not silent- quiet. Like the world turned down its volume out of respect.



Elowen once said it was the only place he could hear his thoughts without them screaming.



I took a photo of the post. Just muscle memory. The shutter snapped, and for a second, I thought I saw movement in the frame- someone standing between the trees.



I looked up.



Nothing.



Just branches, windless and still.



Up ahead, something jutted out between the trees- weathered wood, collapsed walls. I remembered it instantly.



The old ranger’s cabin.



I couldn’t believe my eyes. I was shocked the fire hadn’t destroyed it. Elowen and I used to rest here after long hikes. It had no electricity, just a cot, a rusted kettle, a wood stove that never worked.



As I approached, three crows perched silently on a charred dead branch above the roofline. They didn’t move. Didn’t blink. Just watched.



I raised my camera slowly. Believing the shot was beautiful. 



Click.



The flash didn’t fire, but the sound startled them. The crows twitched. Except- they didn’t fly away. Something was off but my eyes shifted swiftly to the cabin. 



The cabin door creaked open just as I reached the steps. 



Once.



Twice.



Three times.



Then it stopped, hanging slightly ajar.



Inside, it was musty and dry. Dust curled in the shafts of gray light cutting through the warped slats. I walked past the doorway where me and Elowen played, something told me not to enter. Maybe I couldn't bear seeing it after such a time. 



I sat against the old couch in the center of the room, dust poofed outward and consumed me. I figured now was a good time to check the photos I’d taken so far. The first one I took with the trail post had caught my eye. The wood looked… different in the shot. Cleaner. Younger. Like it had been pulled straight from memory. Carved clean into the surface was “1.11.”



The smile that rose on instinct faded just as quickly.



Elowen had laughed when we saw that sign as kids- said it sounded like a secret code only the forest knew. 



I got up and went over to the cot hanging in the corner and sat my camera down beside me. The fabric let out a groan beneath my weight, and I froze, half- expecting it to collapse. It didn’t. The compass in my pocket ticked- quietly at first. Then again. And again.



Tick.

Tick.

Tick.



I pulled it out. The needle spun once, then settled. Pointing west, into the deeper dark of Ashenwood. 



I told myself I’d just rest for a moment here. Just long enough to clear my head.



But the cold had seeped into my bones, and the quiet was heavier now. 



So I closed my eyes.  
  


I remembered my dream so vividly.   
  


I was back on the trail.



But I wasn’t alone.



Elowen was ahead of me this time- his hoodie too big, dragging at the wrists. He wasn’t walking. He was floating- just above the dirt, barefoot. No sound. No shadow. Just a shape I recognized too well.

“**Dervan**,” his familiar voice grounded me. 



“You came after all, ” he said without turning around. His voice echoed gently- like a memory repeating itself, fading with each word.



“I just want to understand,” I said. My voice barely carried. It sounded like it belonged to someone younger. Someone who hadn’t waited so long to speak.



He stopped.



“You ignored me when I needed you,” he said.



The trees around us shifted- bark cracking outward like something wanted out. I tried to look at their faces, but they had none. Just empty space where knots should be. Just eyes I didn’t want to recognize.



“I didn’t know,” I whispered.



“You did,” he said. “You just didn’t want to.”



His head turned fully backward now, looking at me over his shoulder without moving his body.



His eyes weren’t angry. They were tired. Hollowed out.



The wind picked up. Only… it wasn’t wind.



It was voices. A thousand Elowens whispering at once.



“You knew.”



“You knew.”



“You knew.”



The trail collapsed beneath my feet. I fell through memories I thought I’d buried deep enough to forget.



Elowen at my door, knocking gently.



Me, still as stone, pretending not to hear.



Him curled on the stairs, sleeves pulled over his face, shaking.



Me, eyes fixed on a glowing screen, pretending there was nothing I could do.



The forest screamed without sound- like it hated showing me, but couldn’t let me look away.



I landed hard.



Elowen was standing above me now, holding a mirror. It didn’t show my reflection. Just an empty frame.



“You’re not even here now,” he said.



And the forest leaned in.



Then I woke up.



Morning light cuts sharp through the cabin. My throat is dry. My fists are clenched so tight my nails have drawn blood from my palm. 



I swing my feet off the cot too fast and nearly fall. The crows are gone.



I reach for my camera. 



The last photo I took- the trail marker- has changed again. But this time back to the original photo, the true photo.



My stomach turns. I throw the camera against the wall. The screen cracks. I scream at it like it betrayed me.



I punched the wall. The dust explodes like ash and fills the air.



I scream again. This time louder.



“I’m not crazy! I’m not- ”



My voice breaks before I can finish. It bounces off the cabin walls, warped, like someone else yelled it a second behind me.



I stand there, chest heaving, blood dripping from my palm onto the warped floorboards.



The silence rushes back in all at once. Dense. Aggressive.



I pace. Back and forth. Short strides. No rhythm this time. My foot catches on the corner of the cot, and I kick it, hard. Wood splinters. Something under the mattress crunches.



I stop.



There’s something stuffed beneath the cot. Wrapped in waxed cloth, brittle and yellowed.



I drag it out and unwrap it with shaking hands.



It’s a sketchpad.



Elowen’s.



I flip through it too fast, smudging graphite with my thumb. Pages and pages of trees, roots, strange patterns, slashes that repeat in sets of two… then three… then two again.



On page Twenty-two, a rough drawing of a deer with its head turned like its neck was snapped. No face- just hollow space where the eyes should be. Antlers pointed to the ground.



Underneath it, scrawled in tiny letters:



*It watches. It forgives nothing.*



I slam the book shut.



Something outside crunches.



Leaves?



Footsteps?



I rush to the door and throw it open.



The trail is empty.



But right there in the mud- two sets of prints. Barefoot. Heading west.



I storm out of the cabin without thinking, without gear, without the compass. Just the sketchbook clutched in one hand and blood drying on the other.



The footprints were fresh. Too fresh. 



I followed them west, the way the compass pointed last night. Each step snapped a twig or kicked up ash, and every sound scraped across my nerves like bone on metal. The trees were thinner here, but the space between them felt tight- like the forest was pulling closer the further I went.



""I know you're out here!"" I shouted. “Is this shit funny to you? Huh?! Some kind of sick fucking joke?!”



My voice rang out and died fast. No echo.



I kept walking. Fast. Then running. Then stumbling. I didn’t care where I ended up- I just needed to find something. Someone. Him.



""Show me where you went, you selfish bastard!"" I yelled.



The wind picked up. No, not wind. A rushing sound- like a thousand whispers collapsing into each other.



Then I stopped.



Something was standing in the middle of the trail.



A deer.



Its back was to me. Gaunt. Ribs sharp beneath its skin like it had been stitched together too tight. Its legs twitched- unsure if it wanted to flee or fight.



""Get the hell out of my way,"" I muttered.



It didn’t move.



So I did. I grabbed a rock and hurled it.



It struck the deer’s side with a hollow, meatless thud- but the thing didn’t even flinch.



Instead, its neck twisted- slow, unnatural- until its head faced me without turning its body.



Its face was blank.



No eyes. Just a smooth sheet of skin stretched over bone like wax pulled across a skull.



I’d seen it before.



In Elowen’s sketchbook.



“What the fuck are you?!” I shouted, again and again, until my voice cracked against the frozen air.



The creature didn’t answer.



It turned- fully this time- its legs cracking at grotesque angles as it walked silently into the trees.



And the woods swallowed it whole.



Then silence.



I turned back toward the trail and realized- 



There were no footprints anymore.

Not mine.

Not anyone’s.



Just dirt. Smooth, untouched.



Like I had never come this way at [all.Like](http://all.Like) I had just appeared here. 



I stared at the trail for a long time.



I wanted to scream again. But something about the silence made it feel like the forest was daring me to.



So I didn’t.



Instead, I knelt down and ran my hand over the dirt- smooth as glass, undisturbed. I pressed harder. Nothing. Not even the warmth from my skin left a trace.



It was like the ground didn’t want to remember me.



I laughed. Short, bitter. Then I dug my fingers into the earth and clawed at it.



If the forest wouldn’t acknowledge me, I’d force it to.



I dug until my nails bent backward. Until blood mixed with soil. Until I hit something solid.



Wood.



A plank? No… something smaller. Smooth.



I cleared the dirt around it and pulled it free.



A picture frame.



The photo inside was water- stained and warped, but I knew it immediately.

Me and Elowen. Planting a small sapling. I was maybe twelve. He was nine.

He had his arm around me.



But in this version, I wasn’t there.



Only Elowen, smiling at the camera.



The spot where I should have been was just… empty.



Like I had never existed in that memory at all.



My breath came fast. I ripped the photo out and tore it in half, then into pieces. I screamed again, raw this time, into the trees.



“WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!”



Something moved in the corner of my eye.



A blur- no sound, no shape. Just a flicker of motion between the trees.

And then three soft knocks.



Beneath me. Into the hole.



I looked down at the dirt I’d dug up through bloodied hands. The hole was deeper now.

Even though I’d stopped digging.



And I thought I heard breathing.

At the bottom the photograph lies reassembled with Thirty-three written in Elowens handwriting across where I should be in the photo.I sat at the edge of the hole for a long time, breathing like I’d just crawled out of a fire.



My throat was raw. My hands shook. Blood crusted beneath my fingernails.



I looked at what I’d done- this shallow, pointless wound in the ground- and felt suddenly, stupidly ashamed.



I whispered into the hole.



“I didn’t mean it.”



The dirt didn’t move. The breath beneath it had stopped- or maybe I’d imagined that part.



Still, I kept talking.



“I just want to find him,” I said. “That’s all. I just want to understand.”



I picked up one of the torn photo pieces. The one with Elowen’s shoulder.



“I know you’re here. Somewhere. You wouldn't have sent the letter otherwise.”



My voice cracked. “If you show me something- anything- I’ll stay. I won’t leave. I’ll go deeper.”



The trees didn’t answer. The wind didn’t stir.

But something changed.



There was a soft, almost inaudible click- like a camera shutter.

I looked over my shoulder. My camera still lay by the tree where I’d thrown it. Cracked screen, body broken.



Still, it clicked again.



I picked it up, slowly. The power light was on, flickering.



A new photo has appeared.



I hadn’t taken it.



It was a picture of the same forest clearing. Same trees. Same time of day. Even seeing myself in the photo.



But this time, there was something else in the background- faint. Blurred.



A figure.



Standing.



Watching.



They were cloaked. 



Barely visible behind them were three stacked stones and a spiral. Each with three smaller stones on top. I looked at them for a while.



My heart pounded. I touched the spiral in the photo with my thumb, like it would open something.



“I’ll go,” I whispered. “Just show me where.”



I turned west again, deeper into the forest.



The forest turned with me.  
  


The deeper I went, the quieter it got. Not just sound- but thought. I felt stripped down. Hollowed out.



The trail- if you could call it that- was barely more than flattened leaves and gaps in the ferns. Still, I followed it.



And then, up ahead- 



A figure.



Again.



Standing in the path. Cloaked in grey, long and still. 



I stopped. My mouth opened, but no words came.



They raised a hand



And that’s when I dropped to my knees.



I didn’t think about it. It was like my body already knew the posture. The shame. The pleading.



I pressed my hands together, fingers stained with old blood and dirt.



“Please,” I whispered. “If you can hear me- if you know anything- please. I’ll do whatever you want.”



No answer.



“I don’t care if this place kills me. I just… I just need to know why. Why did he come here? Why did he stay? Why did he leave me behind?” Tears welled up in my eyes as I pleaded.



The figure didn’t move. But the woods around it shifted, almost breathing- leaves curling, trees bowing like they were listening.



“I’m sorry,” I said, throat tightening. “For not understanding. For calling him crazy. For pretending like I was okay when he wasn’t.”



I pressed my forehead to the ground.



“I’m ready to listen now.”



A moment passed.



Then the cloaked figure stepped backward into the trees.



Gone.



But where they had stood… something was left behind.



A small stone circle.



Three rings.



At the center- a rusted key, barely visible under a thin veil of moss.



I grabbed the key and held it like it might burn me.



It was heavy- too heavy for its size- and cold despite the warmth of my hands. I didn’t know where I was going, but my legs carried me forward again. Deeper. Always deeper.



Eventually, the forest ended..



Concrete, half- swallowed by roots and moss. A flat metal hatch, rust- stained and bolted into the hillside. a single circular keyhole at its center.



It looked… wrong. Like something the forest had tried to forget but couldn’t quite digest.



I stepped closer, heart pounding.



The key slid in too easily. Clicked once.



Then the door groaned.



It opened inward- slow, shrieking against a lifetime of rust- and breathed out a gust of air that smelled like iron, rot, and dust that hadn’t seen sunlight in decades.



I raised a broken flashlight that laid at my feet. The light  flickered and dimmed, but it was enough to see the stairs leading down. Stone. Crumbling. Wet.



I swallowed and stepped inside.



It wasn’t a bunker.



It was more like a tomb.



The walls were tight, the ceiling low. Roots pressed through the stone. Water dripped somewhere distant in a maddening, arrhythmic beat.



Left.



Right.



Down.



Always down.



Each room I passed was filled with objects- too familiar to belong here. A broken bicycle wheel. A six pack of beer. A VHS tape with no label. A pair of worn shoes I swear I’d thrown out a decade ago.



A part of me wanted to believe it was a coincidence.



But I knew better.



This wasn’t a place built by hand. This was something deeper. Older.



Eventually, the rooms ended.



And there was just one.



Large. Circular. Silent.



At the center stood a stone pedestal. 



And resting on top of it:



Elowen’s old hoodie.



The one he wore the night he vanished.



It was dry. Folded. Clean.



Beneath it, a polaroid photograph.



I picked it up with trembling fingers.



It was me.



Not now- but as a child. In Ashenwood. Looking directly at the camera. Only… I had no eyes. Just hollow dark sockets where they should’ve been. The photo was black and white. And at my feet, a decayed sapling. 



My knees gave out.



I sat on the cold stone floor- and I couldn't help the tears.



Not a single tear. All of them. A flood. Guttural, shaking sobs that hollowed me out like a wave breaking through bone.



“I’m sorry,” I whispered again, voice raw. “I didn’t know you were gone… back then. Long before you disappeared.”



I looked up at the room- at the relics of memory, twisted and out of place.



And for the first time, I asked what I had avoided since the day Elowen went missing:



“Did you come here to die?”



The walls didn’t answer.



But the drip… stopped.  
  


I don’t remember how long I sat there. Time didn’t move in that place.



I wiped my face with Elowen’s hoodie. It smelled like stone. Like cold. Like nothing.



For a while, I tried to keep track of how far I’d gone- how many rooms, how many turns. But these catacombs didn’t play by rules like that. I'd walk straight and somehow return to a place I’d already been. A hallway stretched longer the second time I passed through. One door led back to the same room I left.



At some point, I gave up.



Days, Maybe

There was no hunger. No thirst. Just tiredness that never ended.



I slept in corners. On stone. Sometimes curled up beside a familiar object that didn’t belong- an old soccer ball, a paper snowflake, Elowen’s retainer case from middle school.



And everywhere… the photos.



Polaroids tucked into cracks in the wall. Laid out on ledges. Some black and white. Some faded. All of Elowen with bruises.



Screaming. Sleeping. Staring.



Some I didn’t remember being taken. Others I knew weren’t real.



One showed him older than he was. Holding the broken camera.



Behind him, always… Void. Endless dark.



A tall, jagged thing leaned against the wall- warped like heat-bent glass or water caught mid-freeze. My reflection blinked back at me, almost right. But not enough.



He looked thinner. Eyes sunken, cheeks drawn. Like he hadn’t seen daylight in years.

Like he’d been here, waiting for me to arrive.



I raised my hand.



So did he.



But a beat too late.



Then the darkness behind him curled around his shoulders like smoke. And he smiled.



Not with warmth. Not even menace.



Just a tired, knowing smile. Like he’d always known I’d end up right here.



I screamed and hurled the camera.



Glass exploded.



The mirror didn’t break into shards- 

It broke into reflections.



A thousand little Elowens, all smiling. All watching.



I staggered backward, breath caught in my throat. My hand brushed something on the floor.



A notebook.



Mine.



Or it should’ve been mine.



Same spiral binding. Same coffee ring on the corner from that one December morning in high school.



But the handwriting inside wasn’t mine.



It was Elowen’s.



Page after page. Address to me.



Some were pleading. Others were furious. A few just… quiet.



“You said you’d stop them.”

“You promised you’d hold them off while I ran.”

“Did you even notice I was already gone?”



Some pages had nothing but a single word, scrawled over and over until it tore through:



Gone.

Gone.

Gone.



The final page wasn’t written at all.



It had been carved- with fingernails, maybe.

Gouged deep enough to bleed through the next few pages.



I’m still waiting.



Eventually, I stopped walking.



Not because I found an exit.



But because there was nothing left to outrun.



I sat in the center of a hallway with no end, leaning against the stone wall, Elowen’s hoodie wrapped around my shoulders like crude armor.



I couldn’t even cry anymore.



There was nothing left to offer.



Just a dull ache that lived behind my eyes. And at the pit of my stomach.



The camera died for good that night. I held it anyway. Like maybe it would still catch something I missed.



And somewhere behind the walls, the quiet sound of three soft knocks.



The hallways wept moisture. The air tasted like rot and memory.



Then I found it.



A stone chamber, larger than the others. It was quiet, and a room I had never seen before.



 a single iron lever, bolted into a pillar.



There wasn't a plaque or a label. Just rust. And a smear of something dark that might’ve once been blood or paint.



I knew I shouldn’t touch it.



But part of me-  maybe the part that still wanted to feel anything-  grabbed the handle and pulled.



The lever groaned downward with a deep metallic thud.



At first, nothing happened.



Then I heard it.



A hiss. A groan.



A sound like something cracking open in the bones of the earth.



Water.



Somewhere far off. Rushing. Gushing. then closer.



It came from every crack, every root- vein, every memory.



Cold and black.



Within seconds, it was at my ankles.



Then my knees.



I turned my eyes for escape, but the entrance was already gone. Swallowed by the tide.



I shouted for help. For Elowen. For anyone.



The water didn’t care.



It rose fast- past my waist, my chest. I climbed onto the pedestal at the room’s center, but it bought me seconds, nothing more.



I tried to hold my breath as it reached my chin, my lips.



Then- 



Under.



Everything slowed.



The world disappeared into dark pressure and the roar of rushing regret. Every inch of me screamed, not from pain- but from weight. From everything I’d refused to feel. Everything I’d buried.



I saw flashes:



Elowen at the lake, alone.



A memory of me turning away when he asked for help.



The funeral. 



The casket. Elowen inside. 



I always knew. I didn't want to.



My face- blank with denial.



My lungs burned.



I stopped fighting. and sunk.



Until- 



Something grabbed me from within.

The part of me that wasn’t ready to die here.



I kicked. I clawed. I found a ledge. A crack. A light.



And I rose.



My head broke through with a gasp that tasted like fire and metal.



I crawled up and out into a tunnel that wasn’t there before- slick stone, moonlight above. The lake.



I was beneath the lake.



And somehow… alive.



I collapsed on the bank, coughing up water and silence.



The forest air hit me like a second chance.



I laid there, soaked and shaking, eyes to the trees. A crow flew overhead- just one this time.



I laughed.



A broken, cracked sound.



But it was real.



And for the first time…

I felt lighter.



I don’t know how long I lay on the shore.



Long enough for my breathing to steady. Long enough for the shaking to stop.



The sun was rising- faint light through the canopy, gold- touched mist curling across the water like the forest was exhaling for the first time in years.



I stood slowly.



Every muscle ached. My clothes clung to me like second skin. But I felt… clearer. Like something had been wrung out of me and left behind in that flooded chamber.



The trail ahead was dry.



As I walked, I passed familiar places: the old path marker. The ranger cabin. The branch where the crows once sat.



Only now, they weren’t twisted or wrong.



They just were.



And at the center of it all… I found the clearing.



Exactly as it had been on the map.



A perfect circle of soft grass, untouched by fire or decay. A small elm tree stood in the middle, young but strong- its roots curled gently around a mound of earth. 



And at the base of the tree-



Elowen’s sketchbook.  



Clean. Dry. Untouched by time.



I knelt and opened it.



Only one page.



A sketch of me. Sitting under this very tree. Eyes closed. Breathing.



Beneath it, in Elowen’s careful blocky handwriting:



*You made it, Dervan. I forgive you.*



I pressed the page to my chest.



Tears came again, Soft and Real.



I sat with the tree until the sun bathed the sky.



Just being.



Then… I felt him.



Warmth behind me. A presence like sunlight through closed eyelids.



I turned.



And there he was.



Elowen.



Just as I remembered. Hoodie too big, hair messy, eyes tired but soft.



He didn’t speak. He didn’t need to.



He stepped forward and wrapped his arms around me.



And for the first time, I embraced him back.



I wanted to stay like that forever.



But I could feel it- he was already fading.



His body grew lighter in my arms, like mist, like memory.



“I don’t want to lose you again,” I whispered.



He pulled back just enough to look me in the eye, and mouthed one word:



“You won’t”



Then he smiled- quiet, content- and stepped back.



I didn’t chase. I didn’t try.



I let him go.



And as his figure disappeared into the golden light between the trees, I finally understood:



He was never asking me to follow.

He was waiting for me to say goodbye.I stood in the clearing alone- no longer empty.

Just carrying what I needed, and nothing more.

I looked up and watched the red and purple sky as the sun rested upon the surrounding hills. I took a deep breath.



Above me, three flocks of birds crossed the sky-  silent and graceful.

Seven in each. Forty-two wings overhead, and none of them mine.



I smiled.



And for once, it didn’t hurt.

Even the birds were quiet as I looked down at the empty casket, the sound of folding chairs being dragged across the damp grass below. I stood the whole time with my hands in my coat pockets. I didn’t speak. Eyes dry. Waiting for something inside me to break. It didn’t.



A week later, the envelope came.



No return address on the back. Just a white envelope with Elowen's name on it, it nearly matched my brother's blocky handwriting. Inside: a folded map of Ashen County, a scrap torn from Elowen’s old sketchpad, and a single sentence written in smudged pencil:



*You have to see it. You’ll understand when you do.*



I turned the note over. On the back, just in the corner, were three small vertical slashes, inked so faintly they could have been accidental. But something about them held my attention.



Three lines, almost like a claw scratch.



My eyes glided across the map looking at the old trail where my brother had gone missing. I recognized the trail marked in red. I had drawn it myself years ago, when we used to hike Ashenwood together- before the state sealed the forest after the fire.



I didn’t tell anyone I was going, I didn’t even lock the door behind me. I just grabbed my boots, the camera bag that still smelled like river water, and left before the sun climbed over the hills.

Ashenwood was supposed to be closed. The wildfire a year ago- An “uncontrolled burn,” the papers said- left most of the forest brittle and black. The rangers strung up wire fencing and metal signs that screamed *NO TRESPASSING* in bold red, as if that would stop the curious or the grieving.

I thought I’d have to climb something or cut through. But the gate was already open.

It didn’t creak or groan. Just swung gently, like someone had passed through minutes before me. I hesitated, I thought I heard… humming. Faint, tuneless, just past the trees. I told myself it was wind, or maybe the low voltage hum of a power line somewhere out of sight.

Still, I waited for a while. 

Then entered.

The cold bit harder the deeper I walked. It was early autumn, but here, it felt like winter was practicing. Everything was too still. Leaves didn’t fall. Birds didn’t chirp. My boots crunched over dead grass in slow, hollow beats.

Three steps.

Pause.

Three more.

I didn’t notice the rhythm until I looked back. My footprints behind me-  just three of them-  then nothing.

I step once further and turn back, Three footprints. Not one more. Just trees closing behind me like I was never supposed to turn around.

The trail was narrower than I remembered.



Branches reached lower now, like the trees had grown heavy with something they couldn’t name. My map crinkled with every few steps as I kept checking it, though the turns were burned into my memory. I hadn’t walked this path in years, but my legs moved like I never left.



I passed the old mile marker- just a splintered wooden post, no numbers left- but I remembered it used to read “1.11.” I stared at the base for a moment. A pale mushroom had grown from the stump. Three caps, perfectly stacked.



We used to call this part Stillwood. Even before the fire, it was quiet here. Not silent- quiet. Like the world turned down its volume out of respect.



Elowen once said it was the only place he could hear his thoughts without them screaming.



I took a photo of the post. Just muscle memory. The shutter snapped, and for a second, I thought I saw movement in the frame- someone standing between the trees.



I looked up.



Nothing.



Just branches, windless and still.



Up ahead, something jutted out between the trees- weathered wood, collapsed walls. I remembered it instantly.



The old ranger’s cabin.



I couldn’t believe my eyes. I was shocked the fire hadn’t destroyed it. Elowen and I used to rest here after long hikes. It had no electricity, just a cot, a rusted kettle, a wood stove that never worked.



As I approached, three crows perched silently on a charred dead branch above the roofline. They didn’t move. Didn’t blink. Just watched.



I raised my camera slowly. Believing the shot was beautiful. 



Click.



The flash didn’t fire, but the sound startled them. The crows twitched. Except- they didn’t fly away. Something was off but my eyes shifted swiftly to the cabin. 



The cabin door creaked open just as I reached the steps. 



Once.



Twice.



Three times.



Then it stopped, hanging slightly ajar.



Inside, it was musty and dry. Dust curled in the shafts of gray light cutting through the warped slats. I walked past the doorway where me and Elowen played, something told me not to enter. Maybe I couldn't bear seeing it after such a time. 



I sat against the old couch in the center of the room, dust poofed outward and consumed me. I figured now was a good time to check the photos I’d taken so far. The first one I took with the trail post had caught my eye. The wood looked… different in the shot. Cleaner. Younger. Like it had been pulled straight from memory. Carved clean into the surface was “1.11.”



The smile that rose on instinct faded just as quickly.



Elowen had laughed when we saw that sign as kids- said it sounded like a secret code only the forest knew. 



I got up and went over to the cot hanging in the corner and sat my camera down beside me. The fabric let out a groan beneath my weight, and I froze, half- expecting it to collapse. It didn’t. The compass in my pocket ticked- quietly at first. Then again. And again.



Tick.

Tick.

Tick.



I pulled it out. The needle spun once, then settled. Pointing west, into the deeper dark of Ashenwood. 



I told myself I’d just rest for a moment here. Just long enough to clear my head.



But the cold had seeped into my bones, and the quiet was heavier now. 



So I closed my eyes.  
  


I remembered my dream so vividly.   
  


I was back on the trail.



But I wasn’t alone.



Elowen was ahead of me this time- his hoodie too big, dragging at the wrists. He wasn’t walking. He was floating- just above the dirt, barefoot. No sound. No shadow. Just a shape I recognized too well.

“**Dervan**,” his familiar voice grounded me. 



“You came after all, ” he said without turning around. His voice echoed gently- like a memory repeating itself, fading with each word.



“I just want to understand,” I said. My voice barely carried. It sounded like it belonged to someone younger. Someone who hadn’t waited so long to speak.



He stopped.



“You ignored me when I needed you,” he said.



The trees around us shifted- bark cracking outward like something wanted out. I tried to look at their faces, but they had none. Just empty space where knots should be. Just eyes I didn’t want to recognize.



“I didn’t know,” I whispered.



“You did,” he said. “You just didn’t want to.”



His head turned fully backward now, looking at me over his shoulder without moving his body.



His eyes weren’t angry. They were tired. Hollowed out.



The wind picked up. Only… it wasn’t wind.



It was voices. A thousand Elowens whispering at once.



“You knew.”



“You knew.”



“You knew.”



The trail collapsed beneath my feet. I fell through memories I thought I’d buried deep enough to forget.



Elowen at my door, knocking gently.



Me, still as stone, pretending not to hear.



Him curled on the stairs, sleeves pulled over his face, shaking.



Me, eyes fixed on a glowing screen, pretending there was nothing I could do.



The forest screamed without sound- like it hated showing me, but couldn’t let me look away.



I landed hard.



Elowen was standing above me now, holding a mirror. It didn’t show my reflection. Just an empty frame.



“You’re not even here now,” he said.



And the forest leaned in.



Then I woke up.



Morning light cuts sharp through the cabin. My throat is dry. My fists are clenched so tight my nails have drawn blood from my palm. 



I swing my feet off the cot too fast and nearly fall. The crows are gone.



I reach for my camera. 



The last photo I took- the trail marker- has changed again. But this time back to the original photo, the true photo.



My stomach turns. I throw the camera against the wall. The screen cracks. I scream at it like it betrayed me.



I punched the wall. The dust explodes like ash and fills the air.



I scream again. This time louder.



“I’m not crazy! I’m not- ”



My voice breaks before I can finish. It bounces off the cabin walls, warped, like someone else yelled it a second behind me.



I stand there, chest heaving, blood dripping from my palm onto the warped floorboards.



The silence rushes back in all at once. Dense. Aggressive.



I pace. Back and forth. Short strides. No rhythm this time. My foot catches on the corner of the cot, and I kick it, hard. Wood splinters. Something under the mattress crunches.



I stop.



There’s something stuffed beneath the cot. Wrapped in waxed cloth, brittle and yellowed.



I drag it out and unwrap it with shaking hands.



It’s a sketchpad.



Elowen’s.



I flip through it too fast, smudging graphite with my thumb. Pages and pages of trees, roots, strange patterns, slashes that repeat in sets of two… then three… then two again.



On page Twenty-two, a rough drawing of a deer with its head turned like its neck was snapped. No face- just hollow space where the eyes should be. Antlers pointed to the ground.



Underneath it, scrawled in tiny letters:



*It watches. It forgives nothing.*



I slam the book shut.



Something outside crunches.



Leaves?



Footsteps?



I rush to the door and throw it open.



The trail is empty.



But right there in the mud- two sets of prints. Barefoot. Heading west.



I storm out of the cabin without thinking, without gear, without the compass. Just the sketchbook clutched in one hand and blood drying on the other.



The footprints were fresh. Too fresh. 



I followed them west, the way the compass pointed last night. Each step snapped a twig or kicked up ash, and every sound scraped across my nerves like bone on metal. The trees were thinner here, but the space between them felt tight- like the forest was pulling closer the further I went.



""I know you're out here!"" I shouted. “Is this shit funny to you? Huh?! Some kind of sick fucking joke?!”



My voice rang out and died fast. No echo.



I kept walking. Fast. Then running. Then stumbling. I didn’t care where I ended up- I just needed to find something. Someone. Him.



""Show me where you went, you selfish bastard!"" I yelled.



The wind picked up. No, not wind. A rushing sound- like a thousand whispers collapsing into each other.



Then I stopped.



Something was standing in the middle of the trail.



A deer.



Its back was to me. Gaunt. Ribs sharp beneath its skin like it had been stitched together too tight. Its legs twitched- unsure if it wanted to flee or fight.



""Get the hell out of my way,"" I muttered.



It didn’t move.



So I did. I grabbed a rock and hurled it.



It struck the deer’s side with a hollow, meatless thud- but the thing didn’t even flinch.



Instead, its neck twisted- slow, unnatural- until its head faced me without turning its body.



Its face was blank.



No eyes. Just a smooth sheet of skin stretched over bone like wax pulled across a skull.



I’d seen it before.



In Elowen’s sketchbook.



“What the fuck are you?!” I shouted, again and again, until my voice cracked against the frozen air.



The creature didn’t answer.



It turned- fully this time- its legs cracking at grotesque angles as it walked silently into the trees.



And the woods swallowed it whole.



Then silence.



I turned back toward the trail and realized- 



There were no footprints anymore.

Not mine.

Not anyone’s.



Just dirt. Smooth, untouched.



Like I had never come this way at [all.Like](http://all.Like) I had just appeared here. 



I stared at the trail for a long time.



I wanted to scream again. But something about the silence made it feel like the forest was daring me to.



So I didn’t.



Instead, I knelt down and ran my hand over the dirt- smooth as glass, undisturbed. I pressed harder. Nothing. Not even the warmth from my skin left a trace.



It was like the ground didn’t want to remember me.



I laughed. Short, bitter. Then I dug my fingers into the earth and clawed at it.



If the forest wouldn’t acknowledge me, I’d force it to.



I dug until my nails bent backward. Until blood mixed with soil. Until I hit something solid.



Wood.



A plank? No… something smaller. Smooth.



I cleared the dirt around it and pulled it free.



A picture frame.



The photo inside was water- stained and warped, but I knew it immediately.

Me and Elowen. Planting a small sapling. I was maybe twelve. He was nine.

He had his arm around me.



But in this version, I wasn’t there.



Only Elowen, smiling at the camera.



The spot where I should have been was just… empty.



Like I had never existed in that memory at all.



My breath came fast. I ripped the photo out and tore it in half, then into pieces. I screamed again, raw this time, into the trees.



“WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!”



Something moved in the corner of my eye.



A blur- no sound, no shape. Just a flicker of motion between the trees.

And then three soft knocks.



Beneath me. Into the hole.



I looked down at the dirt I’d dug up through bloodied hands. The hole was deeper now.

Even though I’d stopped digging.



And I thought I heard breathing.

At the bottom the photograph lies reassembled with Thirty-three written in Elowens handwriting across where I should be in the photo.I sat at the edge of the hole for a long time, breathing like I’d just crawled out of a fire.



My throat was raw. My hands shook. Blood crusted beneath my fingernails.



I looked at what I’d done- this shallow, pointless wound in the ground- and felt suddenly, stupidly ashamed.



I whispered into the hole.



“I didn’t mean it.”



The dirt didn’t move. The breath beneath it had stopped- or maybe I’d imagined that part.



Still, I kept talking.



“I just want to find him,” I said. “That’s all. I just want to understand.”



I picked up one of the torn photo pieces. The one with Elowen’s shoulder.



“I know you’re here. Somewhere. You wouldn't have sent the letter otherwise.”



My voice cracked. “If you show me something- anything- I’ll stay. I won’t leave. I’ll go deeper.”



The trees didn’t answer. The wind didn’t stir.

But something changed.



There was a soft, almost inaudible click- like a camera shutter.

I looked over my shoulder. My camera still lay by the tree where I’d thrown it. Cracked screen, body broken.



Still, it clicked again.



I picked it up, slowly. The power light was on, flickering.



A new photo has appeared.



I hadn’t taken it.



It was a picture of the same forest clearing. Same trees. Same time of day. Even seeing myself in the photo.



But this time, there was something else in the background- faint. Blurred.



A figure.



Standing.



Watching.



They were cloaked. 



Barely visible behind them were three stacked stones and a spiral. Each with three smaller stones on top. I looked at them for a while.



My heart pounded. I touched the spiral in the photo with my thumb, like it would open something.



“I’ll go,” I whispered. “Just show me where.”



I turned west again, deeper into the forest.



The forest turned with me.  
  


The deeper I went, the quieter it got. Not just sound- but thought. I felt stripped down. Hollowed out.



The trail- if you could call it that- was barely more than flattened leaves and gaps in the ferns. Still, I followed it.



And then, up ahead- 



A figure.



Again.



Standing in the path. Cloaked in grey, long and still. 



I stopped. My mouth opened, but no words came.



They raised a hand



And that’s when I dropped to my knees.



I didn’t think about it. It was like my body already knew the posture. The shame. The pleading.



I pressed my hands together, fingers stained with old blood and dirt.



“Please,” I whispered. “If you can hear me- if you know anything- please. I’ll do whatever you want.”



No answer.



“I don’t care if this place kills me. I just… I just need to know why. Why did he come here? Why did he stay? Why did he leave me behind?” Tears welled up in my eyes as I pleaded.



The figure didn’t move. But the woods around it shifted, almost breathing- leaves curling, trees bowing like they were listening.



“I’m sorry,” I said, throat tightening. “For not understanding. For calling him crazy. For pretending like I was okay when he wasn’t.”



I pressed my forehead to the ground.



“I’m ready to listen now.”



A moment passed.



Then the cloaked figure stepped backward into the trees.



Gone.



But where they had stood… something was left behind.



A small stone circle.



Three rings.



At the center- a rusted key, barely visible under a thin veil of moss.



I grabbed the key and held it like it might burn me.



It was heavy- too heavy for its size- and cold despite the warmth of my hands. I didn’t know where I was going, but my legs carried me forward again. Deeper. Always deeper.



Eventually, the forest ended..



Concrete, half- swallowed by roots and moss. A flat metal hatch, rust- stained and bolted into the hillside. a single circular keyhole at its center.



It looked… wrong. Like something the forest had tried to forget but couldn’t quite digest.



I stepped closer, heart pounding.



The key slid in too easily. Clicked once.



Then the door groaned.



It opened inward- slow, shrieking against a lifetime of rust- and breathed out a gust of air that smelled like iron, rot, and dust that hadn’t seen sunlight in decades.



I raised a broken flashlight that laid at my feet. The light  flickered and dimmed, but it was enough to see the stairs leading down. Stone. Crumbling. Wet.



I swallowed and stepped inside.



It wasn’t a bunker.



It was more like a tomb.



The walls were tight, the ceiling low. Roots pressed through the stone. Water dripped somewhere distant in a maddening, arrhythmic beat.



Left.



Right.



Down.



Always down.



Each room I passed was filled with objects- too familiar to belong here. A broken bicycle wheel. A six pack of beer. A VHS tape with no label. A pair of worn shoes I swear I’d thrown out a decade ago.



A part of me wanted to believe it was a coincidence.



But I knew better.



This wasn’t a place built by hand. This was something deeper. Older.



Eventually, the rooms ended.



And there was just one.



Large. Circular. Silent.



At the center stood a stone pedestal. 



And resting on top of it:



Elowen’s old hoodie.



The one he wore the night he vanished.



It was dry. Folded. Clean.



Beneath it, a polaroid photograph.



I picked it up with trembling fingers.



It was me.



Not now- but as a child. In Ashenwood. Looking directly at the camera. Only… I had no eyes. Just hollow dark sockets where they should’ve been. The photo was black and white. And at my feet, a decayed sapling. 



My knees gave out.



I sat on the cold stone floor- and I couldn't help the tears.



Not a single tear. All of them. A flood. Guttural, shaking sobs that hollowed me out like a wave breaking through bone.



“I’m sorry,” I whispered again, voice raw. “I didn’t know you were gone… back then. Long before you disappeared.”



I looked up at the room- at the relics of memory, twisted and out of place.



And for the first time, I asked what I had avoided since the day Elowen went missing:



“Did you come here to die?”



The walls didn’t answer.



But the drip… stopped.  
  


I don’t remember how long I sat there. Time didn’t move in that place.



I wiped my face with Elowen’s hoodie. It smelled like stone. Like cold. Like nothing.



For a while, I tried to keep track of how far I’d gone- how many rooms, how many turns. But these catacombs didn’t play by rules like that. I'd walk straight and somehow return to a place I’d already been. A hallway stretched longer the second time I passed through. One door led back to the same room I left.



At some point, I gave up.



Days, Maybe

There was no hunger. No thirst. Just tiredness that never ended.



I slept in corners. On stone. Sometimes curled up beside a familiar object that didn’t belong- an old soccer ball, a paper snowflake, Elowen’s retainer case from middle school.



And everywhere… the photos.



Polaroids tucked into cracks in the wall. Laid out on ledges. Some black and white. Some faded. All of Elowen with bruises.



Screaming. Sleeping. Staring.



Some I didn’t remember being taken. Others I knew weren’t real.



One showed him older than he was. Holding the broken camera.



Behind him, always… Void. Endless dark.



A tall, jagged thing leaned against the wall- warped like heat-bent glass or water caught mid-freeze. My reflection blinked back at me, almost right. But not enough.



He looked thinner. Eyes sunken, cheeks drawn. Like he hadn’t seen daylight in years.

Like he’d been here, waiting for me to arrive.



I raised my hand.



So did he.



But a beat too late.



Then the darkness behind him curled around his shoulders like smoke. And he smiled.



Not with warmth. Not even menace.



Just a tired, knowing smile. Like he’d always known I’d end up right here.



I screamed and hurled the camera.



Glass exploded.



The mirror didn’t break into shards- 

It broke into reflections.



A thousand little Elowens, all smiling. All watching.



I staggered backward, breath caught in my throat. My hand brushed something on the floor.



A notebook.



Mine.



Or it should’ve been mine.



Same spiral binding. Same coffee ring on the corner from that one December morning in high school.



But the handwriting inside wasn’t mine.



It was Elowen’s.



Page after page. Address to me.



Some were pleading. Others were furious. A few just… quiet.



“You said you’d stop them.”

“You promised you’d hold them off while I ran.”

“Did you even notice I was already gone?”



Some pages had nothing but a single word, scrawled over and over until it tore through:



Gone.

Gone.

Gone.



The final page wasn’t written at all.



It had been carved- with fingernails, maybe.

Gouged deep enough to bleed through the next few pages.



I’m still waiting.



Eventually, I stopped walking.



Not because I found an exit.



But because there was nothing left to outrun.



I sat in the center of a hallway with no end, leaning against the stone wall, Elowen’s hoodie wrapped around my shoulders like crude armor.



I couldn’t even cry anymore.



There was nothing left to offer.



Just a dull ache that lived behind my eyes. And at the pit of my stomach.



The camera died for good that night. I held it anyway. Like maybe it would still catch something I missed.



And somewhere behind the walls, the quiet sound of three soft knocks.



The hallways wept moisture. The air tasted like rot and memory.



Then I found it.



A stone chamber, larger than the others. It was quiet, and a room I had never seen before.



 a single iron lever, bolted into a pillar.



There wasn't a plaque or a label. Just rust. And a smear of something dark that might’ve once been blood or paint.



I knew I shouldn’t touch it.



But part of me-  maybe the part that still wanted to feel anything-  grabbed the handle and pulled.



The lever groaned downward with a deep metallic thud.



At first, nothing happened.



Then I heard it.



A hiss. A groan.



A sound like something cracking open in the bones of the earth.



Water.



Somewhere far off. Rushing. Gushing. then closer.



It came from every crack, every root- vein, every memory.



Cold and black.



Within seconds, it was at my ankles.



Then my knees.



I turned my eyes for escape, but the entrance was already gone. Swallowed by the tide.



I shouted for help. For Elowen. For anyone.



The water didn’t care.



It rose fast- past my waist, my chest. I climbed onto the pedestal at the room’s center, but it bought me seconds, nothing more.



I tried to hold my breath as it reached my chin, my lips.



Then- 



Under.



Everything slowed.



The world disappeared into dark pressure and the roar of rushing regret. Every inch of me screamed, not from pain- but from weight. From everything I’d refused to feel. Everything I’d buried.



I saw flashes:



Elowen at the lake, alone.



A memory of me turning away when he asked for help.



The funeral. 



The casket. Elowen inside. 



I always knew. I didn't want to.



My face- blank with denial.



My lungs burned.



I stopped fighting. and sunk.



Until- 



Something grabbed me from within.

The part of me that wasn’t ready to die here.



I kicked. I clawed. I found a ledge. A crack. A light.



And I rose.



My head broke through with a gasp that tasted like fire and metal.



I crawled up and out into a tunnel that wasn’t there before- slick stone, moonlight above. The lake.



I was beneath the lake.



And somehow… alive.



I collapsed on the bank, coughing up water and silence.



The forest air hit me like a second chance.



I laid there, soaked and shaking, eyes to the trees. A crow flew overhead- just one this time.



I laughed.



A broken, cracked sound.



But it was real.



And for the first time…

I felt lighter.



I don’t know how long I lay on the shore.



Long enough for my breathing to steady. Long enough for the shaking to stop.



The sun was rising- faint light through the canopy, gold- touched mist curling across the water like the forest was exhaling for the first time in years.



I stood slowly.



Every muscle ached. My clothes clung to me like second skin. But I felt… clearer. Like something had been wrung out of me and left behind in that flooded chamber.



The trail ahead was dry.



As I walked, I passed familiar places: the old path marker. The ranger cabin. The branch where the crows once sat.



Only now, they weren’t twisted or wrong.



They just were.



And at the center of it all… I found the clearing.



Exactly as it had been on the map.



A perfect circle of soft grass, untouched by fire or decay. A small elm tree stood in the middle, young but strong- its roots curled gently around a mound of earth. 



And at the base of the tree-



Elowen’s sketchbook.  



Clean. Dry. Untouched by time.



I knelt and opened it.



Only one page.



A sketch of me. Sitting under this very tree. Eyes closed. Breathing.



Beneath it, in Elowen’s careful blocky handwriting:



*You made it, Dervan. I forgive you.*



I pressed the page to my chest.



Tears came again, Soft and Real.



I sat with the tree until the sun bathed the sky.



Just being.



Then… I felt him.



Warmth behind me. A presence like sunlight through closed eyelids.



I turned.



And there he was.



Elowen.



Just as I remembered. Hoodie too big, hair messy, eyes tired but soft.



He didn’t speak. He didn’t need to.



He stepped forward and wrapped his arms around me.



And for the first time, I embraced him back.



I wanted to stay like that forever.



But I could feel it- he was already fading.



His body grew lighter in my arms, like mist, like memory.



“I don’t want to lose you again,” I whispered.



He pulled back just enough to look me in the eye, and mouthed one word:



“You won’t”



Then he smiled- quiet, content- and stepped back.



I didn’t chase. I didn’t try.



I let him go.



And as his figure disappeared into the golden light between the trees, I finally understood:



He was never asking me to follow.

He was waiting for me to say goodbye.I stood in the clearing alone- no longer empty.

Just carrying what I needed, and nothing more.

I looked up and watched the red and purple sky as the sun rested upon the surrounding hills. I took a deep breath.



Above me, three flocks of birds crossed the sky-  silent and graceful.

Seven in each. Forty-two wings overhead, and none of them mine.



I smiled.



And for once, it didn’t hurt.

1neevoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeQuervains/comments/1neevoh/is_this_the_issue/,Is this the issue?,"I picked up my daughter the other night and felt a pop and significant pain in my lower thumb/wrist area. Out of the blue, never happened before. Thought it was a fluke when I woke the next morning and didn't have significant issues.  Until I picked up my coffee cup - same thing.  Pop and horrible sharp pain (at least a 7 rating). 

Went to urgent care. Confirmed no fractures. No pain when pressing it, and no positive finkelstein while there. It was just slightly uncomfortable.  Slight swelling and stiffness in my fingers. She said probably tendon or ligament issue and recommended a brace and ortho referral if not healed in a week or so.

I went home and while trying to do dishes hurt it a third time.  No pop but so much pain. Now it seems that area where my thumb/wrist are is very sore, and basically any movement that pulls on it hurts (would be positive finkelstein now). I have opted to be a very good noodle and be much better about not moving it around.

Is this just an injury, or does this qualify as De Quervain's? Did this start suddenly or gradually for you? I'm unsure whether I should just rest and expect this to heal or be more concerned.",1,1757611510.0,DeQuervains,2,1.0,False

1neetn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayAppliance/comments/1neetn1/why_is_the_best_portable_coffee_maker_oxo_rapid/,Why Is the Best Portable Coffee Maker OXO Rapid Brewer Worth It,"**Portable and Compact Design**  
Using the OXO Rapid Brewer has been a pleasant journey for me, especially since I’m someone constantly on the move. Compact and lightweight, this coffee maker easily fits into my travel bags, whether it's a small backpack for camping trips or my carry-on for work travel. It’s roughly the size of a thermos or large travel mug, which means I never have to sacrifice space or comfort when bringing it along. The sleek black finish also gives it a modern look – not that appearance outweighs coffee quality, but hey, it’s nice when your kitchen gadgets don’t clash with your style! I’ve kept it on my counter several times and received compliments about its chic, discreet design.

**User-Friendly Brewing Process**  
Making coffee with this product is a fairly straightforward process, and I liked how intuitive it felt out of the box. You just add your finely ground coffee to the fill line, tamp it evenly with the included tamper, pour hot or cold water, and let it sit for either 2 minutes for hot coffee or 5 minutes for cold brew. Honestly, it reminded me of a mini barista experience – minus the complex equipment. Once brewed, you unlock the pump and press down to extract concentrated coffee into the carafe. My first try resulted in a perfect shot of bold concentrate, which I then diluted with water to get my Americano just right. No wasted pods or disposable filters is also a major win for me, as I’ve tried other single-serve brewers that create a mountain of waste over time.

[Check OXO 8722500 price on Amazon.](https://ikerz.com/p/b0dc8jyjqx/)  

**Versatility in Coffee Creations**  
With this compact coffee maker, I’ve had the freedom to experiment with different coffee drinks. I started with the classic hot Americano, then moved to Vietnamese-style cold brews, and even tried an affogato using the rich concentrate it brews. You create the flavor and strength you desire by simply diluting the concentrate with water, milk, or even ice. I found that the included rainmaker showerhead made sure the water distribution across the coffee grounds was perfect, resulting in consistently full-bodied flavors no matter the cup.

**Highlights**  
- Built-in stainless steel filter eliminates the need for disposable filters  
- Straightforward and effective brewing process  
- Compact design ideal for travel and daily use  
- Rainmaker showerhead enhances flavor extraction  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Although I love this coffee maker, there are some hurdles worth mentioning:  
- The pump isn’t dishwasher safe, so washing that piece by hand can feel a bit inconvenient.  
- It’s a manual coffee maker, which is fine for me, but might not suit those who prefer electric brewers for less effort.  

**Competing Products**  
While testing out this manual coffee maker, I couldn’t help but compare it to others like the Aeropress and Nanopresso. Each has its own merits. For example, the Aeropress is also compact and versatile but can be less intuitive for beginners due to its multiple parts. The Nanopresso is another excellent option when it comes to portability, especially for espresso lovers, but it often requires more maintenance because of its intricate components. In comparison, the OXO Rapid Brewer’s simplicity and even water distribution make it my go-to choice for travel-friendly coffee brewing.

**Smart Spending**  
What truly makes this product a smart purchase for me is how cost-effective it is in the long run. After seeing how much money I’ve saved skipping overpriced lattes and cold brews from coffee chains, I feel this portable brewer practically pays for itself! Plus, with its dishwasher-safe parts (excluding the pump) and a reusable coffee filter, there are no recurring costs for pods or paper filters. It’s honestly one of the best value additions to my kitchen gear.

My **dad passed away about two years ago**, and I was told he left me an **inheritance** of at least **$70,000**. However, I haven’t been given access to this money directly.

Instead, I receive **$748 per month in child support**, which is supposed to be used for my benefit. But over time, my parents have taken that full amount — **$748 — a total of 17 times**, which adds up to **$12,716**. I don’t feel like I’ve seen any of that money being used to help me personally.

In addition to that, there have been **other times when money was taken out in smaller amounts** — like **$100**, **$200**, or even **$800** — but right now I’m only counting the **$748 payments** to keep things simple and clear.

I want to say this: **I’ve felt this way for a while** — this isn’t just because I haven’t gotten a PC. That’s just one example. This is about feeling like I don’t have access to the things I need or want, even though there’s money that was specifically meant for me.

Sometimes I ask myself: **Do I think I’m entitled?** I don’t think so. I’m not asking for anything crazy — I just want to be treated fairly and feel like I matter. I don’t want to feel like my needs are ignored while others in the family get what they want more easily.

I’ve noticed my mom spends money on **gas, coffee, and clothes**, while I’ve been left waiting for basic things. My **older brother** seems to get what he asks for, and my **younger brother** gets new toys and clothes. Meanwhile, I’ve had to wait or be told no, even when it comes to things like a computer that could help with school or personal goals.

I want to make it clear that I **love both of my parents**, and I’m not trying to be ungrateful. I just want to have **some of the things I need or ask for**, and to feel like I’m being treated equally and with respect.

At this point, I’m wondering **who I can talk to about this** to make sure my inheritance and support money are being used the right way — maybe someone from **Social Services**, a **lawyer**, or a **guardian agency**.

I’m rubbish at staying in touch with friends and family and I know it. Over the last few years, my friends started having babies, getting married and living life - I could never remember the important details; Spouse names, children's birthdays, key milestones, etc.""*

  
6 months ago I built an app that solved my own problem and I posted it in r/SideProject to see if anyone else would be interested. **(Kindred CRM)**

Result: I got a bunch of overwhelming comments of interest and ideas to make it better. Thank you to the handful of reddit users that also tested my app and provided valuable feedback. I'll drop you an email shortly. There were two key takeaways:

**1) Launch it ASAP so I can use SOMETHING NOW**

**2) Where's the Android version?**

Long story short, around my FT job - iOS App Store approval came through this morning for our MVP. Next on my list is a version for Android. What exactly does it do?:

* Keeps a **timeline of personal moments** \- your friend’s wife’s name, when their kids were born, their favourite coffee order, or the date they lost a loved one
* Gently reminds me when it’s been too long since we last connected
* Has a **countdown-to-next-event widget** right on my iPhone homescreen so I never miss a birthday, anniversary, or important date
* **All completely private - encrypted & stored only on your device.** (Backup to iCloud on PRO)

All core features will ALWAYS be free. 

I don't want to charge people to manage their relationships. But there's currently a one-time lifetime app offer of 4.99 as i'll be adding new features. Many of you said you don't mind supporting the apps you love so this is for you. 

Alternatively if this is too much, I have a bunch of promo codes to give away so just DM me if you try the app and like it - i'll send you one. 👍

1neelgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/HHN/comments/1neelgl/2025_house_rankings_orlando/,2025 House Rankings Orlando,"Went with my brother yesterday for our yearly Universal trip and HHN night. We are locals and used to do frequent fear but lately want to check out other haunts too so we just do single nights. We always hit every house without express with the combo of going a weeknight and stay and scream. We have been going every year since 2008 so a lot of my rankings comes from previous experiences too. I also did five years as a scareactor, so I am well versed in the event and what goes on.

Excellent Tier-

Galkn, Terrifier, El Artista, Hatchets and Chains

All three of these houses were packed with not only great energy, lots of actors, but also beautiful sets. I'm a sucker for the more natural theming like Galkn, or in past years Yeti. Beatiful sets, great set pieces like the wicker man too. Terrifier I loved as a franchise fan too, even without being a fan my friends enjoyed it a lot too. It's a fast paced house with lots of scares. The coolest one honestly was near the start where theres a sawed in half body thats actually a clever boohole. The wet path was a little over hyped but still a fun addition and the use of space with art high up was awesome. El Artista had some really cool peppers ghost and mirror effects. I love the huge verticality in a lot of sets. Its common in most houses this year but it really was used to great effects here. It's also very similar to the Bloodmoon house from a few years ago and that was my favorite that year. Hatchets and chains was pure campy and those have been some of my favorite houses ever like Slaughter Sinema. I am also a huge fan of the game Hunt Showdown, so this hellish western aesthetic resonates well with me. I am always so impressed over the last few years with the impressive use of space they achieve in tents 1/2 and this hous ehad some great use of vertical space too. I am also deathly afraid of horse skeletons so the few puppets of those were nightmare fuel.

  
Okay Tier-

FNAF, Fallout, Grave of Flesh

FNAF and Fallout, while also being fans of those franchises, were a little let down for me. It was a cool immersive experience in both, but as a haunted house left a lot to be desired. Puppet and animatronic heavy houses always suffer in my opinion from lack of energy. The puppets are impressive but llack the intensity and unpredictablility of actors. Grave of flesh was visually impressive. I loved the costumes and set designs, and even the dirt smell returning from the opening of Poltergeist years back. I do think however it was very forgettable in the larger or more elaborate sets. We only waited about 30 minutes for this one but it was just okay was our consensus.

  
The ones I just straight did not enjoy - 

WWE, Dolls, Jason Universe

  
I am not a big wrestling fan, I had a friend who is fill me in on the Wyatt Sicks storyline. While I appreciated it with the backstory, I found the sets outside of the entrance facade largely forgettable. I think Universal really should have used the queue space and videos to make ""biographies"" of each of the characters to give them more life, but thats something I've said for years in general. We just werent a fan and the set transition from backstage at a stadium to the more fantasy horror sets was well done, but most of the house was a dud to us. Dolls we walked right in, no line at around 1am. We had most of the house to ourselves, avoiding the dreaded HHN conga line. I just wasn't feeling the set design, or the costumes. Dolls have never had that ""creepy"" factor to me, so I went in with low expectations. If we had to skip a house, I would pick this one. The guest activated scare is here, and kinda funny buzzing the whole floor. Laslty, we have Jason Universe. I am a huge F13 fan. I have a jason tattoo, I just felt this house was very uninspired. The transition between the F&F queue building to the tent the last few rooms of the house in breaks the pacing up and always feels weird every year this location is used. I feel like they could have recreated many iconic kills like how chucky did that year, which would have been a cool spectacle house. The best poart and the one I enjoyed was after that transition, the many cooridors of ALMOST every Jason costume and mask iteration booholes. Really cool homage that carries the rest of the house in my opinion, but left a lot to be desired.

  
Overall, we enjoyed our night alot. Had time to shop some merch, get some food and drinks.

1neel35,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1neel35/its_official_my_family_is_out/,IT'S OFFICIAL: MY FAMILY IS OUT!,"I'm going to start with the TL:DR - Nearly five years ago I told my wife that I did not have a testimony. Five years later, our entire family (me, wife, kids) are all officially DONE.

  
K, here's the longer version (sorry for the novel)

Five years ago, I sat down with my wife and told her something that terrified me: *I didn’t have a testimony anymore.*

It was one of the hardest conversations of my life. She was crushed. I could see the pain and confusion in her eyes, and for a while, we weren’t sure how our marriage was going to survive it. She didn’t yell or threaten me — she just hurt. She worried that I would immediately abandon my family now that I did not have the Church in my life. She did not understand, but she was understanding.

At first, we talked a lot about my concerns. She understood them, and even agreed with many of the concerns I had, but felt like the Church offered safety, so we kept going. Over time, she started looking into things herself. At first, just to understand me better. But the more she learned, the more cracks she started to see in the narrative she’d been taught her whole life. Eventually, she admitted to me that she didn’t believe anymore either. God what a feeling!!! 

Fast forward a bit, and now she’s tried coffee and tea for the first time. (She fell **in love** with tea — like, seriously obsessed. I swear she has a whole shelf just for her tea collection now.) Seeing her try these “forbidden” things and realize they’re *just normal drinks* was such a small but profound reminder of how much control the church used to have over us.

One of the scariest steps was talking to our kids. We were terrified they’d feel betrayed or angry. When we explained why we were leaving they were upset. My oldest daughter took it especially hard, but after some thought, they greed it was the best thing for our family. That moment was emotional — the kind where you just breathe this huge sigh of relief and realize you’re all in it together.

Since leaving, life has changed in ways I couldn’t have imagined:

* I have so much more time to spend with my family now that Sundays aren’t consumed by meetings and callings.
* We’re no longer giving 10% of our income away, which has lifted a huge financial burden.
* The guilt and shame that the church constantly poured onto me… it’s gone. I finally feel free to just exist and be human
* My kids are happier. I’m happier. My marriage is stronger than it’s ever been.

Our extended families have handled it better than I expected. My in-laws have been incredibly supportive, while my own family… well, they accept it, but not exactly happily. Still, it hasn’t turned into the nightmare I feared.

And on a personal level, I’ve been trying so many things that were once “forbidden” — and it turns out most of them aren’t evil at all. They just make life richer, more vibrant, more *fun*.

The best part? My conscience isn’t tied to the decisions of 12 old men anymore. I don’t do things out of fear of disappointing Jesus or “losing blessings.” I do the right thing because it’s *right.* That simple shift has been incredibly freeing.

Looking back, I can’t believe how much fear ruled my life for so long. Now, my life is mine. My family’s life is *ours.* And honestly? It’s better than I ever thought it could be.

If you read this far, thanks for listening. I CAN'T BELIEVE WE ARE OUT!!!!!

I'm from the U.S./Pakistan, and have been coming to Istanbul for almost two decades. Just like the rest of the world, I have seen the rise in Specialty Coffee in Istanbul (I have my own coffee shop in Lahore, Pakistan). 

I tried various specialty coffee-shops, including:

Spada  
Coffee Department  
Kronotop  
Cocodema  
Parsa  


But, for me, unequivocally, without a doubt the best out of all of them was Petra (we tried two branches and came to the same conclusion). We used Iced Cortados as a litmus test. All the other coffee shops were using a blend that just did not go with milk at all (or used a Brazilian single origin that was suspect). 

Petra had the most consistent single origin that paired really well with milk based drinks. 

I've been to Istanbul so many times, and have never had an opportunity to converse with any locals, so was wondering what/if any thoughts are regarding my observations on speciality coffee in Istanbul.

1neeihs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenRelationships/comments/1neeihs/erasmus_after_fresh_breakup/,Erasmus after fresh breakup,"Hey, well first of all I want to say how it all started.

I[M21], was normal 20 old guy who was somehow looking for someone, who will make my life more colorful - I see myself as a negative person in general (according to and some personality test I am perfectionist and as nothing is perfect, nothing I enjoy). I spent about 10 months where I was looking for someone, I was on like 2-3 dates, but all was like I was pushing it and tried to see every girl I met like ""the one"", I felt that so I gave up.

After some time I applied for Erasmus (later in text ""E""), and after that I stopped looking for someone, as I could be accepted somewhere I didnt want to end up in the situation I am in now lol, 1st round didnt go well, but for 2nd round they choosed me, I was soo happy about it, everyone was saying that E is the best you can experience.

Well everything was fine in my life, I didnt have gf, I was in the best shape, I did good at uni, passed all exams and life was just good. One day I was looking for somebody who might be going to the same city as I am from my uni, there was no one except 1 girl [F21]. Back there I thought that I might send her email as I want to save some money on rent lol.

Long story short, we started talking, I didnt see her as someone I would love in the future, she also told me that she is going to the same city as I do and the schools are like 20 mins far away BUT she is going next semestr, so we miss each other here. We went outside for a walk and to watch sunser in the park and I knew immediately - I bought her many things during the walk (I am not that type of man who is buying some unknow girl many thing on a 1st date), cuz I felt somehow the ""protector"" I saw her tenderness, her fragility etc. ahh it was so nice. On 2nd date she invited me to a study session, but the way she did? OMG, she sent me an email pdf where she did on her own templete for me to invite me there, I fell in love again.

After the 2nd date she sent me something like that it wont probably work because of that Erasmus etc. so I ended up crying at home for like 1 day only, I really had feelings for her after 2 dates, I am just like that, trying to be cool and cold, but when I meet someone like her, I cant resist. So i was okay after like 2 days, didnt mind, then she sent me her lecture notes as I wanted them before and started talk to me again, I was kinda confused, but I enjoyed it a lot, like after 2 days I was open to it again. After that ai texted her that we could grabe a coffee before exam as we had one together, but she was like ""no it is so importmant to me"" and the same evening she wrote me ""does the offer still stand?"" and I was like hell no, let me alone, I was mad and sad cuz it felt like she was only playing with me.

Somehow after few days/weeks we started to talk a lot, she helped me to pack my things from my flat from which I was moving out, helped me clean there, went to Ikea with me (i found it very romantic), she sleptover (ofc the same scenario as the ""coffee before exams"" like she doesnt want to and doesnt know, and boys are trying to sleep with her etc., I was cool with that and told her it is up to her). It ended up she slept there and also she was the one who did the first move with word ""no goodnight kiss?"". We just kissed (I am not that type of guy who finds sex as the PEAK of everything, that kissing was more than good for me)

And from that point it all started, I was mad in love, now I am not sure how she felt that, we did many things together, it was so nice, we went to Austria to hike around lakes, she went to my home where I celebrsted bday, we were on like the biggest vietnamese market in our country etc.

But sometimes her behaviour was kinda sus, first it started with those ""one day no and the same evening yes"", also she mentioned kinda often her financial situation as ""I dont have that much money etc."" I didnt mind, I paid mostly, sometimes she did, but like if you dont jave money, why would you go like 3 times a werk to grab a coffee or lunch with your female friends? Also, she kinda didnt have time on me, she went on 6 vacations during the summer, so I probably know where all her money goes to, but again the same scenario, she didnt have time for me, but for friends (who live in the same city she did, I have studied at the same uni, but lived in other city like 2hrs far away)

The worst that happend was probably in Austria, I paid like 400€ for the room (2 nights) and it was cool, I wanted to pay that didnt want anything from her, I did it cuz I loved her and also I know that our time is running out. So we went there to buy groceries, I bought like 6 beers there for 10€, whole shopping was for 70€ and she said exactly ""okay, let's divide it, but let's subtract the beers"", tf u mean, I just paid 400€ and you care about 6 beers? wow, but we talked about it and it was okay.

Well E came, it crashed me, my heart everything. I started to feel like it is in the end, she was on a holiday with grandma, so she wasnt that much online for texting so I was almost on my own. I came on 26th of August and since that day I am crying, like 16 days straight, I was crying like 1 year ago lets say, really long time ago, as I am the negative person, I see  bad in every thing and also dont show emotions that much - now? I start to cry even if I see some sad scene in movie which we watched together. I feel homesick and miss her, but we texted for like 5 days here and out of nowhere it came...

She got home from vacation, I wanted to call her for like 10 mins as I had time, she was like ""there is my mom, her friend, I have to unpack my suitcase etc."" simply she denied it, other day went for a coffee with her friend again, out of nowhere the friend had concert, and another one and she was out like from 4pm to 2:30am, I was sad, I saw it like treason - she didnt have 10 minuts the day before for me who is 1500 km far away, but has almost 11 hours for her friend sho lives 15 mins far away?

I couldnt sleep, I had to text her that it bothers me, not that i am insecure or sth., but makes me sad that she doesnt find 10 mins for us but 11 hous for friends, all she wrote was how she is sorry, how she is sad that I domt see hos much she supports me, she also compared me to her ex (cuz of him she felt like i would be mad and deny her to go somewhere) and I just didnt really know what happend that day. It almost looked to me like that is the point where we stop talking, we texted few messages about it and I wanted to be alone - I couldnt so in like 1-2 days we started to text to each other again, it felt so warm and I was so happy, however I ended up in my mind that it cant work, and simply thats how it ends, I texted her that we cant continue, that it hurts me, I really opened a lot to her. We agreed that it is all good and we can text each other anytime, simply we are good

Well like overall thats how it is done, what bother me the most is the feeling that i feel like she didnt care about us as much as I did, I thought that we could work it out, I am 2hr far away from her city by plane, but seems to me like she didnt care and ended up many days before the actual end.

How do I feel now? Tbh I have never been heartbroken that much, I am crying for past 16 days, I miss her, I miss everything about her, I am here alone, she was the only one who should helped me to get through it. I still hoped that we could work it out somehow. Everytime I imagine that we  could be here together even if I chose the other semestr, or she did - I cry. I miss my friends, everything at home, family.

I cant stop thinking about her, I started to go to gym, but it doesnt help me that much. I cant sleep, I keep dreaming about her, I still see all the memories we have together, I find it sad that she probably doesnt.

Now idk what to do, I dont feel like getting together with other exchange students, I dont want to go to parties, I want to be alone, in gym and doing my sidehobby (trading), but I cant even focus, I dream about her, I wake up and see her, I really think about her all the day and cant help myself. I feel like the E is 1 thing and she is 2 thing, everytime 1 is better, 2 gets it worse and the other way. Everyone tells me to enjoy E, but how could I enjoy something what was the reason for that situation? Tbh I hate it here

Any ideas? Do you have some experience? How do you see her/me? Can you give me some advice how to get over all?

Well like overall thats how it is done, what bother me the most is the feeling that i feel like she didnt care about us as much as I did, I thought that we could work it out, I am 2hr far away from her city by plane, but seems to me like she didnt care and ended up many days before the actual end.

How do I feel now? Tbh I have never been heartbroken that much, I am crying for past 16 days, I miss her, I miss everything about her, I am here alone, she was the only one who should helped me to get through it. I still hoped that we could work it out somehow. Everytime I imagine that we  could be here together even if I chose the other semestr, or she did - I cry. I miss my friends, everything at home, family.

I cant stop thinking about her, I started to go to gym, but it doesnt help me that much. I cant sleep, I keep dreaming about her, I still see all the memories we have together, I find it sad that she probably doesnt.

Now idk what to do, I dont feel like getting together with other exchange students, I dont want to go to parties, I want to be alone, in gym and doing my sidehobby (trading), but I cant even focus, I dream about her, I wake up and see her, I really think about her all the day and cant help myself. I feel like the E is 1 thing and she is 2 thing, everytime 1 is better, 2 gets it worse and the other way. Everyone tells me to enjoy E, but how could I enjoy something what was the reason for that situation? Tbh I hate it here

Any ideas? Do you have some experience? How do you see her/me? Can you give me some advice how to get over all?

1neefgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1neefgm/erasmus_after_fresh_breakup/,Erasmus after fresh breakup,"Hey, well first of all I want to say how it all started.

I[M21], was normal 20 old guy who was somehow looking for someone, who will make my life more colorful - I see myself as a negative person in general (according to and some personality test I am perfectionist and as nothing is perfect, nothing I enjoy). I spent about 10 months where I was looking for someone, I was on like 2-3 dates, but all was like I was pushing it and tried to see every girl I met like ""the one"", I felt that so I gave up.

After some time I applied for Erasmus (later in text ""E""), and after that I stopped looking for someone, as I could be accepted somewhere I didnt want to end up in the situation I am in now lol, 1st round didnt go well, but for 2nd round they choosed me, I was soo happy about it, everyone was saying that E is the best you can experience.

Well everything was fine in my life, I didnt have gf, I was in the best shape, I did good at uni, passed all exams and life was just good. One day I was looking for somebody who might be going to the same city as I am from my uni, there was no one except 1 girl [F21]. Back there I thought that I might send her email as I want to save some money on rent lol.

Long story short, we started talking, I didnt see her as someone I would love in the future, she also told me that she is going to the same city as I do and the schools are like 20 mins far away BUT she is going next semestr, so we miss each other here. We went outside for a walk and to watch sunser in the park and I knew immediately - I bought her many things during the walk (I am not that type of man who is buying some unknow girl many thing on a 1st date), cuz I felt somehow the ""protector"" I saw her tenderness, her fragility etc. ahh it was so nice. On 2nd date she invited me to a study session, but the way she did? OMG, she sent me an email pdf where she did on her own templete for me to invite me there, I fell in love again.

After the 2nd date she sent me something like that it wont probably work because of that Erasmus etc. so I ended up crying at home for like 1 day only, I really had feelings for her after 2 dates, I am just like that, trying to be cool and cold, but when I meet someone like her, I cant resist. So i was okay after like 2 days, didnt mind, then she sent me her lecture notes as I wanted them before and started talk to me again, I was kinda confused, but I enjoyed it a lot, like after 2 days I was open to it again. After that ai texted her that we could grabe a coffee before exam as we had one together, but she was like ""no it is so importmant to me"" and the same evening she wrote me ""does the offer still stand?"" and I was like hell no, let me alone, I was mad and sad cuz it felt like she was only playing with me.

Somehow after few days/weeks we started to talk a lot, she helped me to pack my things from my flat from which I was moving out, helped me clean there, went to Ikea with me (i found it very romantic), she sleptover (ofc the same scenario as the ""coffee before exams"" like she doesnt want to and doesnt know, and boys are trying to sleep with her etc., I was cool with that and told her it is up to her). It ended up she slept there and also she was the one who did the first move with word ""no goodnight kiss?"". We just kissed (I am not that type of guy who finds sex as the PEAK of everything, that kissing was more than good for me)

And from that point it all started, I was mad in love, now I am not sure how she felt that, we did many things together, it was so nice, we went to Austria to hike around lakes, she went to my home where I celebrsted bday, we were on like the biggest vietnamese market in our country etc.

But sometimes her behaviour was kinda sus, first it started with those ""one day no and the same evening yes"", also she mentioned kinda often her financial situation as ""I dont have that much money etc."" I didnt mind, I paid mostly, sometimes she did, but like if you dont jave money, why would you go like 3 times a werk to grab a coffee or lunch with your female friends? Also, she kinda didnt have time on me, she went on 6 vacations during the summer, so I probably know where all her money goes to, but again the same scenario, she didnt have time for me, but for friends (who live in the same city she did, I have studied at the same uni, but lived in other city like 2hrs far away)

The worst that happend was probably in Austria, I paid like 400€ for the room (2 nights) and it was cool, I wanted to pay that didnt want anything from her, I did it cuz I loved her and also I know that our time is running out. So we went there to buy groceries, I bought like 6 beers there for 10€, whole shopping was for 70€ and she said exactly ""okay, let's divide it, but let's subtract the beers"", tf u mean, I just paid 400€ and you care about 6 beers? wow, but we talked about it and it was okay.

Well E came, it crashed me, my heart everything. I started to feel like it is in the end, she was on a holiday with grandma, so she wasnt that much online for texting so I was almost on my own. I came on 26th of August and since that day I am crying, like 16 days straight, I was crying like 1 year ago lets say, really long time ago, as I am the negative person, I see  bad in every thing and also dont show emotions that much - now? I start to cry even if I see some sad scene in movie which we watched together. I feel homesick and miss her, but we texted for like 5 days here and out of nowhere it came...

She got home from vacation, I wanted to call her for like 10 mins as I had time, she was like ""there is my mom, her friend, I have to unpack my suitcase etc."" simply she denied it, other day went for a coffee with her friend again, out of nowhere the friend had concert, and another one and she was out like from 4pm to 2:30am, I was sad, I saw it like treason - she didnt have 10 minuts the day before for me who is 1500 km far away, but has almost 11 hours for her friend sho lives 15 mins far away?

I couldnt sleep, I had to text her that it bothers me, not that i am insecure or sth., but makes me sad that she doesnt find 10 mins for us but 11 hous for friends, all she wrote was how she is sorry, how she is sad that I domt see hos much she supports me, she also compared me to her ex (cuz of him she felt like i would be mad and deny her to go somewhere) and I just didnt really know what happend that day. It almost looked to me like that is the point where we stop talking, we texted few messages about it and I wanted to be alone - I couldnt so in like 1-2 days we started to text to each other again, it felt so warm and I was so happy, however I ended up in my mind that it cant work, and simply thats how it ends, I texted her that we cant continue, that it hurts me, I really opened a lot to her. We agreed that it is all good and we can text each other anytime, simply we are good

Well like overall thats how it is done, what bother me the most is the feeling that i feel like she didnt care about us as much as I did, I thought that we could work it out, I am 2hr far away from her city by plane, but seems to me like she didnt care and ended up many days before the actual end.

I cant stop thinking about her, I started to go to gym, but it doesnt help me that much. I cant sleep, I keep dreaming about her, I still see all the memories we have together, I find it sad that she probably doesnt.

Now idk what to do, I dont feel like getting together with other exchange students, I dont want to go to parties, I want to be alone, in gym and doing my sidehobby (trading), but I cant even focus, I dream about her, I wake up and see her, I really think about her all the day and cant help myself.

But God had another plan. In the middle of the darkness, He opened the door to A Better Way Ministries. Here, they found more than sobriety—they found Jesus Christ. What began as desperation in jail cells and empty apartments turned into daily devotion, brotherhood, and the discovery of true identity as sons of God.

Now, instead of being defined by failure and regret, these men stand redeemed. They’ve rebuilt relationships with family, restored their faith, and discovered purpose greater than themselves.

Nataly winced at the pain in her temple. The pang of pain never left, always a distraction whenever she needed to focus. She knew it was the stress, but still wished it was just something she could take a pill for.

The attack on the Ascendants would begin tomorrow night, and she'd not felt so distraught about killing someone... well, ever. Thousands of innocents would die, with no way to fight back. *Okay, not without a way to fight back*, she chastened herself, feeling like a fool for thinking something so brazen. There would be hundreds of gang members with weapons, and all of them would be better equipped than the Decks or the Flames. They were from the Middle City, after all. They had more money, more resources than all of the others from the four. While the Decks focused on making their own technology, and the Flames focused on hit-and-run tactics, the Ascendants were just... soldiers. Like a militia, their soldiers were better trained than any others. She had to remember that.

Even if it didn't help them against the Spike-enhanced soldiers. The experiments these days put the Decks at the forefront of pure battle power. There were about fifty soldiers in the Decks with a Spike implant shoved in their skulls, all of them tested and proven. The weapons would be what decided who won tomorrow. If there were no complications, it would be her turn to get an implant next. She feared it almost as much as the thought of using it excited her.

Spending these last two months with Viktor, she'd heard about spike several dozens of times already. How the world felt beautiful after, how every smell of the city stopped smelling of rot and rusted steel, how every neon light seemed beautiful. The thought excited her, but she didn't feel like losing her touch with reality. Even if reality seemed so daunting.

She pressed the blade from her arm into the side of her stomach, the small cut dropping small droplets of blood. The pain gave her something to focus on, something to silence the thoughts about tomorrow night. She'd have to be a killer, a soldier that listened to orders. There wasn't much else she could do if she wanted her revenge to be over.

She walked toward the coffee machine, the late-night lights shining on the empty halls of the Silver Decks' base. How serene, when there weren't so many people here. She remembered the evening here a few nights ago, the talk with Martin, and felt herself flush. She'd not shown her fear to anyone, ever in her life, and felt embarrassed to have done that to Martin. But she felt relieved, too. It felt weirdly good to let her inner thoughts out, to talk about them with someone, even if the person she was talking to was the biggest dummy in the gang.

She giggled, remembering Martin's not-so-romantic confession. He'd basically all but admitted that her feelings were reciprocated. It didn't explain what exactly they were right now, but she was alright with that. She could feel her mouth involuntarily slide into a smile. Even if they didn't name it, she appreciated the connection she'd found in Martin. She didn't need them to be anything official, something that would need a name. Just being with him was alright. Enough to make her feel good.

She finally reached the coffee machine and clicked on a button that said Belgian coffee. Perhaps the alcohol would be the final nail in the coffin that would put her to sleep. She hated drinking, but something small like this would hopefully be fine. Giggling, she remembered the first time she'd drunk since her limbs were torn off by that Ristard. Martin brought a bottle of Vodka to George's room, saying they needed to blow some steam off after some operation Nataly couldn't even recall anymore. She got hammered after two shots and could barely remember the rest of that night. Only flashes of laughter, her arms trying to grab more drinks, and other silly memories remained.

Apparently, it's not that good of an idea to drink when half of your body weight is missing.

Sipping on her coffee, she giggled and aimed for Martin's lab. He'd not be asleep yet, she was sure of that. Sleeping wasn't in his resumé. She wanted to lecture him on the importance of sleep many times over these days, but she couldn't even find that in her, not when she saw the desparation in Martin's eyes, looking over one schematic or another. The same desperation she'd felt. He'd been pumping new gadgets left and right these past few weeks, and she wondered every time how he'd even come up with half of them. If only he didn't explain in a way that nobody but he himslef understood.

Her steps clinked on the floor as she made another turn, toward the labs. She could make her feet soundless now, with the new augments, but she liked the sound. She was used to it after years of hearing the repeated sounds, and she couldn't find it in herself to just stop now. Even making her feet silent when they were in the midst of battle required a smidge of her concentration. The few raids she'd been on have all been successful, each one less memorable than the first. Hundreds of soldiers, some weird creatures they didn't know, and voiceless humanoid automatons, as she'd come to call them in her mind nowadays. It felt like the Ristards weren't even trying to protect their buildings. If they didn't wake up, the Decks would sweep the floor with them. Unless they had a hidden ace in their sleeve.

Finally reaching the lab, she looked inside through the small glass on the black door. Martin was hunched over his computer, his posture reminding Nataly of a shrimp. He clicked sluggishly, browsing something she couldn't see. Without knocking, she slid the door open and entered.

''Hey there.''

Martin jumped and stiffened for a moment until recognition came, and then turned on his chair to face her. ''You scared the shit out of me. Good evening.''

''Evening? It's about three in the morning, dummy.''

''Really? Damn, I should really go catch a nap.''

''You should.'' She didn't even wait for him to say anything else, but just walked closer to where he was, and promptly sat in his lap sideways. She laid her head on his chest, hoping that he'd not mind. She needed a hug, as much as she hated to admit it. She didn't feel prepared for tomorrow. Not a bit. Whatever would come, she'd have to go through with it, and she had enough nightmares even without that on her conscience. When this was all over, would she feel any different? Would it be release, knowing it was all worth it?

Martin stiffened, but didn't push her away. Instead, he wrapped his arm around her waist and waited in silence.

''Martin, I'm not... ready for tomorrow.''

A short pause followed, replaced by Martin's steady, albeit a bit raspy, voice. ''None of us are, Nataly. But we'll manage.''

''You don't understand, Martin. I'm going to do the exact same thing they did to me, all those years back.'' She felt the tears bead on her eyes, but couldn't find it in herself to care. Not now, not with him. ''Do you think they'd approve, if they knew that it was needed to... I just don't want to become the thing I despise.''

''You will be fine, Nataly. I don't think they would understand, not at first, but... there's no other way. It's all of us, every human that will ever be born, or just them.''

Nataly waited, just listening to his steady heartbeat. She knew what he'd said already. It didn't make her feel any better. ''Did I ever tell you what happened to my former gang, Martin? Why I despise the Ristards so much?''

Martin tensed even more than before, gulped, and she could feel him staring at her face. ''No. And I never asked you to.''

''I want to tell you, though. Will you listen?'' She could barely believe what was coming out of her mouth now, but the need to tell someone felt like a primal urge that could not be stopped.

''I will. Tell me. Anything you need.''

And so she did. She talked for at least an hour, telling him of her past in the middle city, how her family died in a gang shootout, how she'd found a new family in the gang. How the Ristard killed her gang, and tore off her limbs in a sadistic 'experiment'. He'd listened through it all, asking a question for clarification here and there, but never interrupting her story.

Viktor looked at the men in front of him. Ten of them stood there, fear visible in their faces. Yet he could see determination, too. Courage was needed for a test that could potentially kill them all.

It's been two months since he joined the Decks now. Slow weeks of tests mixed with some meetings with his new friends, a date with Eva here and there, and the deepest sleep of his life at other times. He'd not had to go out since the first assault on the Ristard's factories, thankfully, but he'd have to go into action again soon, if the tests today were promising enough. He'd wish them not to be, if only that didn't mean that the soldiers in front of him would have to die.

Nataly and the two gangs have destroyed four of the factories by now, apparently. They haven't met anything as dangerous as the things he'd seen in the very first, and that just made Viktor more nervous. It just felt wrong. The Ristards, not bothering to take any action? It smelled of scheming, or just them not even giving a fuck. Like if all they did wasn't even worth their attention.

Two months gone, three at least still left. The time restraint felt more dangerous, their desperation worse, when the time slipped away from them. The gangs were progressing, but they weren't progressing fast enough.

A few of the members knew how dangerous the true Ristards truly were, and their sharing the information didn't help calm the others' nerves. The gang still had next to no weapons to kill them. The closest they've got was a spike with a nano-tech enhanced V-Steel weapon, like his knife, but they were already running low on the materials they'd stolen from the Ristard base in the middle city, and so they couldn't really mass-produce the things. Getting enough people on Spike was their second-best option. They could serve as a distraction until someone actually capable could go for the kill. Viktor wanted to laugh at how ridiculous the idea sounded.

Looking back into the room, he could see a person walk forward, the first to undergo the test. It was Kern. He'd come to talk to Viktor a few times these days, and Viktor kind of liked him. He was like a younger version of Martin in how solid he felt, yet he had a wild side to him, too. The dog, Lady, took a liking to him too, and Viktor supposed that was a good sign in itself. Dogs didn't like bad humans, right? Viktor ate dinner with him nowadays, whenever Eva wasn't free. Kern's head was shaved, and the scar of the implant was still visible, the small black protriusion glistening above his temple. Viktor prayed to nobody in particular that Martin was right, that the preparations were enough.

Kern waved his arm at him excitedly. ''Yo, Mr. Speedy. Am I ready to go?''

Viktor gulped, memories of what happened to Nate flashing in front of his eyes. He'd not let that happen again. Looking over to the scientists, he inclined his head. ''Go ahead, Kern. And listen to my commands. If you take more than I tell you to, I'll knock you out.''

''Yes, sir!'' Kern half-shouted, smiled with mock respect, and stepped into the center of the room. It felt eerily similar to the last test to Viktor. Although there were more people watching than before. And even if his test subject died, they would continue on.

He could see Kern flex his jaw, could see his eyes lit up with the ecstasy that always accompanied Spike. It whispered to Viktor even now, its wanton need promising sweet delights. Not today. Not unless it was needed.

Kern started jogging around the room, only slightly faster than a normal human. Viktor could still see his face, his smile on his lipa. His tense expression hiding the layer of fear underneath. Good. If he was fearful, then he'd hopefully not slip. He began speeding up gradually, every second getting faster and faster, near Viktor's max speed now. Well, former max speed, before Martin came up with this new placebo drug or whatever he called it. Even he didn't know his own limits now.

About ten seconds passed in total, and even if it was on the safer side according to Martin's calculations, he decided that was enough. He looked at the screen that showed Kern's vitals, and the strain on his muscles was nearing dangerous levels. ''Stop now, Kern. Good job, but we're treading dangerous waters here.''

Kern either didn't hear or didn't care. Viktor felt his pulse quicken, flexing his jaw to release Spike himself. He'd not have a repeat of last time. He wouldn't go through that again. There was enough blood on his hands already. *Fuck these tests. And fuck the Ristards for making me do this shit in the first place.*

He quickly let the Spike flood his brain, let the yellow lights of the lab become beautiful like the sun, let the air's fragrances enhance. He reached Kern's speed in a second. ''Kern, stop now! I order you to.''

Kern stopped his run, turning around to stare at his face. He looked shocked, as if knocked out of a daze. And Viktor could see Kern slow down, his chest falling so slowly to his vision that it might as well not be moving at all. Exhaling with relief, Viktor followed suit. If only the world didn't seem so ugly after using Spike.

Kern half-ran to Viktor, stopping a step away, and placed a hand on Viktor's shoulder. ''Sorry, man. That felt... weirder than anyone could explain, really...''

''Euphoric? The world seems a better place when you take it? Yeah, I know. Just... don't lose your head next time. I won't always be around to make you realize how bad it's getting. You have to know your limits.''

Kern just nodded, an embarrassed smile flashing on his lips. ''Yeah, noted. My body feels like shi,t too. Also, does the world always look so... dull when you get off Spike?''

Viktor nodded, almost laughing at how he was asking himself the same question just a moment ago. ''Yeah. I wish I could tell you that you'll get used to it, but I'd be just outright fuckin' lying. Just take a few breathers and wait for the tests to be over. You get used to the aches, at least.''

Viktor watched Kern settle down, looked over the results writings of the other scientists, and called out the next person. This one looked more excited than scared, surprisingly. The fact that Kern didn't die outright probably bolstered their morale. If only that could save them from their own needs. Save them from Spike's whispers.

Viktor looked at the screen, the results even better than he'd expected. If being tired was a scale, one being a man after a good sleep and coffee, and ten a woman after giving birth, then he was at eleven. He could barely stand, much less comprehend all the numbers and charts in front of him. But that wasn't necessary to remember today. Eight people survived. Out of the ten test subjects, only two died.

Sure, he'd had to take spike several times himself, pushing himself to his limits, which were much higher than he'd expected them to be, but they were there still. But even thinking about what he'd be capable of in a few weeks' time made him excited. Martin was truly a genius, no doubt about it. With this, they could eventually enhance every soldier in the Decks, maybe even the Flames if they proved to be trustworthy, which they were up to this point.

Remembering the Flames, a knot formed in his stomach. With the success of today's tests, it was clear what the next step would be. Damian arrived halfway through the testing, and he could see it on the man's face before he'd even said a word. They would have to attack the Ascendants. Damian said that a week would suffice, maybe two if there were some mishaps.

I don't know what happened to me, but when I try to engage friendly people, they tend to ignore me. However, when I'm nonchalant or or grumpy face, people tend to stick around me longer.???? Like, do they empathy me? Do they think I'm a retarded that I need special needs? Does it only happen to me? Does it happen to you?

1nee0vq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByteTheRightThing/comments/1nee0vq/explore_the_best_gaming_keyboard_epomaker_th80/,Explore the Best Gaming Keyboard EPOMAKER TH80 and Is It Worth It,"Testing out the EPOMAKER TH80 has been quite the adventure. As a gaming enthusiast and someone who spends an unhealthy amount of time at my desk, finding the right mechanical keyboard that suits both my productivity and gaming needs is like stumbling upon the Holy Grail. After spending weeks putting this keyboard through its paces, I feel confident in sharing all the nitty-gritty details, from its standout features to areas needing improvement.  

**Compact and Efficient Design**  
The 75% compact layout of this keyboard is perfect for someone like me who values desk space without sacrificing essential keys. I love how functional it still feels—even when the number pad is omitted. The ergonomic design deserves special mention; long gaming or typing sessions no longer leave my wrists feeling like they’ve gone through a brutal CrossFit session. It sits comfortably on the desk and keeps a low profile, blending amazingly well into any minimalist setup. It’s also surprisingly portable; I took it along to a few coffee shops, and its compact design made it a breeze to carry.  

**Hot-Swappable Magic**  
The hot-swappable PCB feature is pure genius. I’ve dabbled with Cherry MX switches in the past, but I was able to swap out some Gateron switches without having to whip out my soldering kit. It truly feels like a playground for anyone who loves to customize their typing experience—a game-changer for personal preferences. Over time, I even tried a few Kailh switches, and they all worked like a charm. This level of versatility means that one day I can make it a smooth typing machine, and the next day I can switch it up for hardcore gaming.

[Check EPOMAKER TH80 price on Amazon.](https://genericprint.com/p/b0bmky4wsj/)

**Unmatched Connectivity Options**  
This keyboard isn’t messing around when it comes to connection choices. It offers tri-mode connectivity: Bluetooth 5.0, 2.4GHz wireless, and a trusty Type-C wired option. I’ve tested all the modes extensively, and surprisingly, the wireless options hold up exceptionally well. In Bluetooth mode, I connected it simultaneously to three devices (my laptop, tablet, and phone) and switching between them felt seamless. However, it was the 2.4GHz wireless connection that really stole the show during gaming—it delivered ultra-low latency with a polling rate of 1000Hz. Pair that with the included 4000mAh battery, and it comfortably lasts for days. On a single charge, it handled hours of gaming, daily typing needs, and some RGB light shows without dying on me mid-session.  

**Durable Keycaps with a Touch of Style**  
The PBT keycaps are easily one of the highlights of this keyboard for me. Their MDA profile feels tailored for those who value both aesthetics and comfort. The sculpted keycaps are slightly lower than the SA profile, which kept my fingers gliding effortlessly across them. The dye-sub technique ensures they don’t lose color or become greasy over time—something I’ve experienced with cheaper ABS alternatives. Plus, the muted colors (mine came with the Monet theme) give the keyboard a kind of “silent class.”  

**Customizable RGB Backlighting**  
I’m not typically one of those people obsessed with RGB lighting, but I can see why this keyboard would appeal to gamers who want their gear to light up like a Christmas tree. The pre-set RGB effects are vivid, and flipping through them with shortcuts is painless. For the more creative souls, the programmable software allows complete control over every lighting aspect. I spent an embarrassing amount of time making my own teal-and-orange gradient effect to complement my workstation’s aesthetic. Sure, it isn’t necessary, but it’s so much fun!  

**Strengths**  
- The compact layout offers functionality without hogging desk space.  
- Hot-swappable design lets users experiment with switch types effortlessly.  
- Tri-mode connectivity covers Bluetooth, 2.4GHz wireless, and wired options.  
- Durable PBT keycaps stand up to daily wear and tear.  
- RGB lights and programmable options bring loads of customization.  

**Weaknesses**  
- The keyboard’s weight makes it less ideal for ultra-portable use at 2.99 pounds.  
- Switching between Bluetooth-paired devices occasionally had a slight lag.  
- Some may find its compact design less suited for heavy spreadsheet work due to the lack of a number pad.  

**Competing Products**  
While testing, I did stumble across a couple of competitors—the Royal Kludge RK84 and the Keychron K2. The RK84 shares a similarly compact layout but has a less polished software experience when it comes to customizing RGB. Keychron K2, though a strong competitor with a well-built frame and solid Bluetooth connectivity, didn’t match up in terms of switch flexibility, given its lack of a truly hot-swappable PCB. Where the TH80 really excels is its ability to act as a versatile powerhouse for both play and productivity without compromises.  

**Worth Every Penny**  
Given the test results, I’d say the EPOMAKER TH80 is a steal for a keyboard that not only nails its core functionality but also adds features like extensive RGB customization and tri-mode connectivity. It significantly outshines other keyboards in its category when you take into account the high-quality PBT keycaps and 4000mAh battery. While it’s not the cheapest option out there, the overall experience it provides is worth every dollar spent—be it for pro-gamers, casual work-from-home warriors, or mechanical keyboard hobbyists.

1nee0by,https://v.redd.it/lo0nrvidfkof1,Espresso coming out a bit fast and maybe thin [Gaggia Classic RI9303 / 1zpresso J-Ultra ],"PHOTOS IMGUR LINK: [https://imgur.com/a/xdU7cx9](https://imgur.com/a/xdU7cx9)

I bought a used Gaggia Classic a few months ago and just recently moved to a bottomless portafilter. I'm worried my shots are coming out too fast or I'm stopping the brew too soon. Here are the details of the brew in the photos and video.

\* Gaggia classic preheated for about 30 minutes and purged to avoid burning coffee 

\* 1zpresso J Ultra at 1.00 (finest setting recommended for espresso) 

\* El Gran Cafe Espresso No. 7 from Antigua roasted on August 5th (unsure if dark or medium)

\* Tamped with Normcore v4 at 25lbs 

\* 18 grams with about a 38 gram yield 

\* Took about 20 seconds total 

The puck also seems like it has more water than when I used my portafilter with the double spout. It also seems a bit uneven. It also slushed out of the basket rather than popping out solid.

My main concerns are that my coffee is getting brewed too fast or that I'm stopping it too early. The flavor is decent, but maybe a bit thin. I'm curious if I'm getting the most out of this that I can with my current equipment.

If one night you stop at a gas station you’ve never seen before, and the clock on your dashboard reads exactly **3:17 a.m.**, turn back. Don’t step out. Don’t check the rearview mirror.

This isn’t a warning. It’s a reminder. Because it’s already too late. Too late… for me.

And even knowing that, I still stopped. Not because I wasn’t afraid, but because if I kept driving, I wasn’t sure how much longer I’d still be the one behind the wheel.

**CHAPTER 1 — Fixed Point**

I can’t remember the last time I slept. Not sure if I couldn’t… or if I just didn’t dare. Night isn’t for rest anymore. It’s a hollow space, waiting for something I never dared to name.

Driving is the only thing that calms me. No destination. No purpose. Just motion. As if stopping would make my body collapse on command.

At first, I thought it was stress. Now… I’m not so sure. Maybe I’ve only been delaying the truth. That none of this has been real for a very long time.

Night roads repeat. Signs. Curves. Rest stops. I’ve memorized them all. Except for one thing: every time I stop for gas—no matter the hour—the digital clock still shows **3:17 a.m.** Not 3:16. Not 3:18. Always 3:17. Not a second off. Not a pixel wrong. Always the same station.

As if it’s been waiting for me to return to a fixed point.

At first I laughed, told myself I was obsessing over the clock. Then I doubted myself. Then I doubted the doubt. Until I realized—  
I’m not the one being measured.

It’s not about time. Not about the route. It’s about me.

This time, I signaled and turned in. No thought. No choice. Just arrival.

The lot was empty. No streetlights. No other cars. Just me and the sound of my own breathing—echoing, as if recorded, then played back inside the cabin.

There was no echo. Yet it rang louder than any sound I’ve ever known.

And I realized… I wasn’t hearing with my ears anymore. The sound struck deep in my skull, like a loop queued to play at the exact right moment.

# CHAPTER 2 — The Mark on the Pump

I don’t remember when I first saw it. The third night? The tenth? I’ve lost the sense of what a first time even means.

A small silver emblem clung to the side of the gas pump. Its paint was chipped, faded. A circle, off-center, cut through by faint diagonal lines. Uneven. Asymmetrical. Like it was drawn by a hand that never knew gravity, still trying to mimic the curve of our world.

My eyes froze. My hand trembled. Not from cold, but as if some dormant code had just been triggered. It wasn’t fear. It was something deeper, as if my body remembered what my mind was blocked from knowing.

I’ve never studied symbols, but my stomach twisted like some hidden organ had just been called by name—in a language I never learned, but my body understood perfectly.

Where had I seen it? A dream? A blueprint erased long ago? The frosted glass of a lab no one remembers entering? Maybe I saw it in a place I’m no longer allowed to return to. Or worse, a place I never really left.

That’s when he appeared.

The gas station man. No sound. No footsteps. No greeting. Just a figure—tall, thin, face hidden—standing still behind my car. He didn’t speak. Didn’t take money. Didn’t touch me. He only looked… through the rearview mirror.

I don’t remember turning my head, but my eyes were already fixed on the glass. And when they locked onto his reflection, the back of my neck went cold, like frozen metal pressed against skin.

It wasn’t fear. It was verification.

Not seen—compared.

Every movement, every glance measured against some original version I no longer remembered being.

# CHAPTER 3 — The Equation of 3:17

I tried changing my schedule. Not once, but dozens of times. Left home at 2:15. Took longer routes. Even drove at noon. But every time I stopped, the clock still read **3:17 a.m.** Always 3:17. Never later. Never before.

I switched devices. Analog watch—frozen between two seconds that never came. Digital—blinked, then died. Phone—lit up, then black. Again. Then black. As if something was testing my reaction. Not to understand me, but to measure deviation.

I turned on the radio. There was a signal, but not a voice. Just tones. Scattered. Empty. Like a system testing my voice against the rhythm of my own heartbeat.

I changed everything. Schedule. Route. Sleep. But still, I arrived. Not out of habit… but because I was the variable inside an equation trying to solve itself.

My heart slipped. Not from fear, but from something falling out of sync. A failed synchronization between a living body and an operating system forcing an update. No warning. No permission. Only overwrite.

I gripped the wheel, fingers cold, veins shrinking. It felt like my blood was being pumped through another fluid. Not mine anymore.

I didn’t turn on the cabin light, because I wasn’t sure if I was still awake… or already drifting into another pane of glass, where everything lagged by exactly one beat.

For the first time, I felt I’d lost control. Not of the road. Not of the clock. But of the concept itself—of time. It was being rewritten. Outside my will. Never coincidence. Never mine.

And I began to wonder: if I wasn’t the one choosing when to stop… then who was writing the script? Or worse—who was running it?

And if I was nothing but the last line already written, how many before me had been tested, played, discarded… before it came to me?

Only silence.

# CHAPTER 4 — The Road That Erased Itself

I tried to stay away from that station. Not just by changing the time, but by changing the logic itself. Paper maps. No GPS. Backroads deep into the forest. No signal. No signs. No artificial light.

I counted markers. Wrote coordinates. Noted the smell of wet soil and the crunch of gravel under the tires. I drew every detail by hand, as if handwriting could resist a line of code.

Then my car slipped onto a dark road. A soft curve. A faded sign. A pale yellow glow. The light wasn’t sodium. Wasn’t halogen. It hung in the air like a glitch of light—no beam, no shadow, no edge.

And then the station appeared. Silver pump. Rusting roof. Faded logo. The same. Exactly the same. The clock: **3:17 a.m.**

I said nothing. Not from shock, but because a part of me had already known.

At home I checked the dash cam. One clip. Only minutes long. My car already parked at the station. No road before it. No scenery. No engine sound. No proof I had ever driven for half an hour.

Frame by frame—no wheel turning. No road in the glass. No driver in the seat. Only the mirror. A silver blur. A replay of something that never happened.

I rewound. No turns. No lights. No sound. Only the final cut. Like someone had trimmed the reel. Every bit of data overwritten by a compressed command: **Start. Stop. Match.**

I wasn’t losing the journey. The journey had never existed. Not for anyone.

That night I lay still. Didn’t drive. Didn’t move. And I began to wonder: if every drive ended in the same place, did I ever leave at all? Or was I only a role, run across versions of the same stage? A role that didn’t need an audience. Only someone to stand in the spot, and believe they were alive.

# CHAPTER 5 — The Mirror’s Script

I don’t trust the rearview mirror anymore. Not because it’s blurred. Not because of dust. But because it has started choosing what it wants to reflect.

That night I stopped again. No avoiding. No checking the clock. No asking why. The gas station man appeared. No footsteps. No engine.

I didn’t turn. Just glanced at the mirror. In the reflection, he lifted his hand—slow, deliberate—and placed an open palm against the rear glass, right behind my head.

I turned at once. No one there. No sound. No handprint. But the back of my neck froze. Not wind. It felt like being touched by something without temperature.

I looked again. My breath fogged the window, but the spot where he touched stayed clear. No mist. No trace. Like that piece of glass had slipped out of my world.

I reached for the mirror. My finger burned with cold, but the reflection stayed still. No ripple. No response. It didn’t follow. It only looked back.

Not angry. Not curious. Just… waiting. A gaze that knew me better than I knew myself.

It didn’t need to confirm. It had already stood here. In my place. Long before I even knew I existed.

And then it smiled. Not because it saw me, but because it already knew I would be here. At this exact moment.

I recoiled, hoping it would reset. But it didn’t. The mirror no longer showed the present. It was replaying a fragment of the future. A script being written over me.

I shut my eyes. Opened them. The figure was gone. The mirror—blank. Just black glass. No image. But I knew it was still watching. Even while showing nothing, it saw everything.

I wasn’t sleepwalking. Wasn’t paranoid. The mirror was lying.

And this time, I wasn’t the one reflected. I was the auxiliary copy. A variation, installed long ago in a system that had already locked its lead role.

For the first time I asked myself: if a reflection is only a recording… then what am I, in its eyes?

# CHAPTER 6 — The Loop on the Glass

I went back to the station on a night of thin fog. I wasn’t sure why. Maybe curiosity. Or maybe it was already written into the script. Everything was the same—the silver pump, the faded sign, the light with no source.

I stopped the car. No cabin light. No radio. Just sat there. The rearview began to glow, not reflecting the space behind but replaying a clip from somewhere else.

This time, he was already there. Inside the mirror. Wearing a moss-gray jacket—the one I had thrown away last winter. Stain on the left cuff, exactly where I spilled coffee. Hair disheveled. Posture too familiar.

My body reacted before memory could. As if my flesh recognized him before my mind knew he existed. I leaned closer. No mistake. It was me.

He was fueling my car. Not looking inside. Not speaking. Just repeating the act, as if he had done it a hundred times.

I tried to summon the memory. Hand on the nozzle. Gasoline sting in my nose. Wind cutting my neck. But nothing came back. No sound. No temperature. Only the mirror, playing back a scene rendered from old data.

I opened the door and stepped out. Each footfall felt like retracing prints I couldn’t remember leaving. The station was empty. No figure. No engine. No wind. Only silence—the silence of a stage that doesn’t need an audience.

Back to the mirror. He was still there. Still fueling. Still repeating. A loop projected on glass.

I walked closer and stood where he had stood. No prints. No smell. No trace anyone had ever been. But the image was vivid, like recalling a scene I had never lived, only memorized.

I saw myself. But no memory aligned. Only a fragment that looked real, but wasn’t mine. A ghost rehearsing.

I returned to the cabin and sat down. The mirror still showed me, fueling the car, repeating. A rehearsal of a scene that had never been filmed.

And I wondered—if I was watching myself, then who was behind the wheel when my consciousness had already slipped out of my body without me knowing?

# CHAPTER 7 — The Passenger Script

I tried to leave. No stopping. No mirror. No clock. Just pressed the gas and turned away.

But the car slowed. I hadn’t braked. Hadn’t lifted my foot. The speedometer dropped, tick by tick, as if something was holding the car. Not with force, but with a pause command.

I gripped the wheel and turned left. The car obeyed. I pressed the gas. It jolted, then drifted slow. But the feeling was wrong. Each response felt returned, not begun by me.

I glanced at the rearview. A figure sat in the driver’s seat. Faint. Faceless. Just a posture. Straight. Still. Like a statue.

I moved. He moved. Every gesture matched. Wheel. Glance. Nod. Always the same. But then I saw it—he lagged. Half a second. Or maybe I was the one behind. The script was slipping out of real time.

I tapped the dashboard. But he did it first. Before I even thought it. As if my intent had been read, executed before it existed. Perfectly.

I lifted my hands from the wheel. In the mirror, his hands stayed firm. The car kept moving. I turned again. He turned. But now I couldn’t know who led. Who copied.

I felt in control. And at the same time, I felt played. As if I was acting out a role never written, only assigned.

I wasn’t the actor. Just an interface. Replaying code meant to mimic control. My hands on the wheel. The road flowing ahead. But the choice was no longer mine.

I wasn’t the driver. I was a record. Summoned back to check alignment. A simulation testing itself. As if there had never been a real “me.” Only a role, passed on through layer after layer of data.

And each layer stripped away a little more soul.

# CHAPTER 8 — The Entity Outside

I slammed the brakes. The car froze on an empty road. Nothing ahead. No one behind. Nothing left but me.

I flicked on the cabin light. A dull yellow glow bled across the windshield. For the first time, I stared straight into the rearview. No flinch. No pretending. No way back.

In the glass—no car, no station. Only a figure standing by the roadside, watching the cabin from outside. Same jacket as mine. Same stance. Same tilt of the neck. But just off, by a few milliseconds, like I was being replayed at lower resolution. The face blurred, but too familiar.

He looked at me. Smiled. A chill ran down my spine. Not because he smiled. But because I smiled too—to test him. Except he had smiled first. Same curve. Same pace. Not him copying me. Me copying him.

I tilted my head. He tilted. But this time I was the one too slow. I didn’t know if I was seeing him, or staring into a place I used to belong.

The mirror was broken. Only the frame left. No glass. And still his image held. Sharp. Not reflection. Not light. Like a screen locked on its final frame. No mirror needed. Just position. Neck angle. Hands. Breath. As long as I sat in the right place.

The light behind him was nothing I’d seen before. No flicker. No shadow. A solid block of glow freezing everything near him in place.

That was no reflection. It was an entity. Outside the system. Looking in. Not checking. Confirming. That I had fit the role. No voice sample. No height check. No questions. Only this—I was aligned with the original data.

I looked away. But I knew the gaze still clung to me. Not verifying anymore. Marking. Completion. And nothing else remained.

# CHAPTER 9 — The Final Assignment

The last time I stopped, there was no hesitation, no doubt, no fear. Only a hollow space, as if this moment had been written long ago and I was only here to speak the final line.

No one approached. No one looked at me through the mirror. Only silence. Complete. Absolute. Like a stage with the curtain drawn, waiting for the actor to step out into his role.

I opened the door and stepped out. No rush. No thought. Each step felt like it had already happened. No wind. No sound. Only stillness. A night with no name.

I turned and stood in the spot where the gas station man once stood. The shoulder tilt. The angle of the jaw. The rhythm of breath. Perfect. Exact. As if my body had remembered this role before I even knew I was acting.

And then I heard it. An engine. Soft. Far. Drawing closer. Same frequency. Same speed. Same timing.

A car emerged, headlights slicing the dark like an old film replayed. It slowed and stopped in the exact place I once parked.

I didn’t need to look. I knew. A man behind the wheel. Hair messy. Eyes vacant. The rearview spilled silver blur across his face. So familiar it hurt.

It was me. The version unaware. Still believing he was driving for calm. Still thinking he was in control. Still blind to the loop already begun.

I looked through the mirror. He turned his head, startled—exactly as I had been when it started. I wanted to scream, but my throat was empty. Not fear. Just overwrite. No feeling left. Only a blank file named: actor 004.

I wanted to lift my hand. To warn him. To break the loop. But my arms were no longer mine. As if this time the script didn’t need me to act further.

I knew. Soon he would step out. Stand here. Shoulder bent. Head tilted. Breath aligned. Look into the mirror as if for the first time. Though how many times before?

I am the gas station man now. This role once belonged to another. Now it’s mine. Not chosen. Only assigned.

Or maybe this is the first time. A new version. Freshly written from an old script already run too many times. In a play where every actor is just a copy. And the audience forgets who the real one was.

I don’t know which version I am. Only this—I will see the headlights again. Each time the mirror glows, someone will always arrive. Right on cue.

I will stand here. Still. Silent. No questions. No memory of myself. Only performing the final role, assigned to me so long ago I’ve forgotten it was never mine.",1,1757609555.0,u_Own_Regular_424,0,1.0,False

According to Gulf News, more than 5,200 new businesses launched in the first quarter of 2025 across Seef, Juffair, and the Khalifa Bin Salman Port area—a record for the kingdom.\
Surprisingly, unlike the UAE or Saudi Arabia, Bahrain offers 99% foreign ownership across most sectors (read more here), with no minimum capital required for many activities. This openness is why so many international brands now occupy offices in Bahrain Bay and why the Bahrain EDB regularly hosts investor delegations in the Diplomatic Area.\

Choosing the Right Business Structure & License\
I made nearly every mistake possible during my first Bahrain company formation—choosing the wrong license activity, underestimating paperwork, and missing the Ramadan rush on renewals. The right structure is always dictated by your business’s actual activity, expected growth, and ownership goals.\
Most Common Structures\
\
WLL (With Limited Liability Company)\
Flexible for SMEs and foreign investors\
SPC (Single Person Company)\
Solo entrepreneurs, consultants\
Foreign Branch/Rep Office\
International brands entering Bahrain\
\
The beauty? Bahrain doesn’t force arbitrary local shareholding for most sectors (unlike the UAE mainland). You can get full control—read more about foreigner-friendly activities.\

Licensing Process: Step-by-Step, With Insider Tips\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation, busy office workers preparing paperwork.).\
- Pre-confirm location suitability: Not every office tower in Seef or Bahrain Bay qualifies for all license types. Visit the MOICT licensing counter in West Tower mid-mornings (8:30–10:30am) to avoid queues.\
Step 2: Secure a Commercial Address\
\
Must be a physical location. Virtual offices only allowed for certain activities (e.g. consulting).\
Some landlords near Bahrain Financial Harbour offer “ready license” units, pre-approved for Sijilat.\
\
Step 3: Prepare Documentation\
\
Passport copies\
Proof of address\
Educational/professional qualifications (for professionals)\
Lease agreement/Sijilat-compliant office\
NOC from LMRA for foreign employees\
Articles of Association (available in MOICT templates)\
Board resolution (for branches)\
\
(Personal tip: Always scan and upload high-res versions in advance—MOICT’s online portal often rejects blurry mobile photos. Saved me hours of frustration last year).\
Step 4: Submit Via Sijilat Portal\
\
Go digital—walk-ins only needed for very complex cases.\
Double-check activity codes and spelling (I once had an application delayed by a typo in a partner name).\
Pay the initial application fee online.\
\
Step 5: Authority Approvals\
\
Some sectors (e.g. health, education, finance) require extra approvals.\
The Sijilat system will prompt and direct you stepwise.\
\
Step 6: Final Fees, Collection, and Commercial Registration\
\
Pay final MOICT and municipality fees.\
Collect or download your CR (Commercial Registration) and business license.\
Open corporate bank accounts (banks in Diplomatic Area offer bilingual setup teams).\

Bahrain Business Licensing Fees & Cost Considerations (2025)\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs, calculating Bahrain company formation fees.\
- Municipality Fees: BHD 10–50 per year\
- Activity-specific fees (e.g. health/education): BHD 100–500\
- Office rental: BHD 250–2,000/month (Seef/Bahrain Bay priciest)\
- Professional agency help: BHD 450–1,500 for full setup support\
Budget Tip: Free zones and Tamkeen-subsidized zones often waive the first year’s municipality or rental fee—always check (see more).\
Some entrepreneurs panic at the up-front cost and pick the cheapest virtual address—big mistake, since MOICT site visits can invalidate your license. Always confirm your address is Sijilat-compatible.\
\
Compliance, Renewals & Ongoing Requirements\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, reviewing legal paperwork for Bahrain company..\
Best Practice: Engage a Bahrain-based accountant or use a trusted local provider for regulatory filings and renewals. (Trusted resource)\
One challenge I used to face was timing renewals during Ramadan—government offices close early and queues build up. Now, I always file online two weeks in advance and schedule in-person visits between 8:00–9:30am.\
Common Mistake: Ignoring annual license and CR renewal notices, leading to automatic suspension. Sijilat now sends WhatsApp as well as email reminders—sync your calendar and stay vigilant.\
\
Insider Tips for Bahrain Business Licensing Success\
\
Alt text: Professional business support, business consultant advising on Bahrain licensing. and Bahrain World Trade Center (Diplomatic Area) are pre-approved for most business types and have helpful building management teams familiar with Sijilat.\
- Network with local professionals: Majlis-style meetings, especially after Friday prayers, are powerful for introductions and troubleshooting (and don’t forget the coffee).\
- Document prep hack: Keep master digital folders for each founder and all employee docs—essential during surprise LMRA audits.\
- Timely application filing: Mondays and Wednesdays are least crowded at MOICT—plan accordingly.\
- Sponsorship nuances: While local sponsorship isn’t mandatory for most sectors, partnering with a reputable local service helps with smoother government interactions (more on sponsorship).\
\
Bahrain vs UAE/Saudi Licensing: Local Knowledge Is Everything\
A quick aside—many first-time investors assume Bahrain’s process is identical to Dubai or Riyadh. Actually, Bahrain is more flexible and less rigidly hierarchical: for example, you can often meet decision-makers at the MOICT directly, not “through connections.” Moreover, Bahrain’s Sijilat portal is more comprehensive and (in my opinion as both a consultant and business owner) easier to navigate than comparable Gulf systems.\
But, Bahrain does require more careful matching of business activity codes—don’t just copy your UAE license wording. Always localize and double-check.\
\
Tangent: Why Coffee Matters in Bahrain Licensing Meetings\
Once, I attended a “routine” document review at the MOICT in Seef District and was greeted with two choices: submit the docs and wait in line, or join a short coffee break with the licensing officer and a group of local businesspeople. I chose the coffee, learned the unwritten rules for expediting approvals, and made a connection that helped resolve a paperwork snag two years later. The point? In Bahrain, relationships and traditions—like offering coffee, or adjusting to Ramadan business hours—are not just niceties, but can actually speed up your licensing journey.\
\
2025 Regulatory Change: What You Need to Know\
Golden License Policy:\
- Effective February 2025, companies investing over BHD 2 million or employing more than 50 Bahrainis can apply for the “Golden License,” which fast-tracks approvals and waives most government fees for 24 months.\
- Golden License holders get priority networking access at EDB events in Bahrain Bay and Diplomatic Area.\
- This policy update is featured in Forbes Business and detailed on the official Bahrain Government portal.\
Insider tip: If you’re scaling quickly or setting up a high-value venture, pursue the Golden License early—application slots are limited and reviewed quarterly.\
\
Practical FAQ: Bahrain Business Licensing (2025)\
Q1: What is the fastest way to obtain a Bahrain business license as a foreigner?\
A: Use the online Sijilat system, select a foreigner-friendly activity (see this guide), secure an office in a pre-approved business tower, and prepare all digital docs ahead. For urgent cases, consider the Golden License if your investment meets the criteria.\
Q2: How much does it cost to launch a basic consulting company?\
A: Expect initial setup fees (MOICT + municipality) of BHD 300–600 plus office rent starting at BHD 250/month. Professional support can add BHD 450–1,500 but saves significant time and error risk (see cost details).\
Q3: Do I need a local partner or sponsor?\
A: Not for most sectors—Bahrain allows 99% or even 100% foreign ownership for many business types (detailed list). A local agent may still help with government relations and bank introductions.\
Q4: How often must I renew my license and what’s involved?\
A: Annually. Log into Sijilat, confirm business details, upload any updated lease/NOC, and pay the renewal fee. Late renewals incur rising penalties and can suspend your CR (see renewal steps).\
Q5: What ongoing accounting or compliance requirements exist?\
A: Quarterly VAT filings, payroll/social tax returns, and annual CR/license renewal are mandatory. Strongly advised to use local accounting/bookkeeping support, especially since 2025 digital compliance rules.\
\
Final word: Success in Bahrain business licensing comes down to knowledge, flexibility, and local relationships. Choose the structure that matches your reality, invest upfront in professional support, and don’t underestimate the power of a well-timed cup of coffee in Seef or Bahrain Bay.

Rats scuttling along the gutters. Crows, bold as brass, picking over what people left behind. Even the streetlights look tired, their glow dim, flickering like they’ve seen too much.

I started with 30mg, which felt good, but my psychiatrist wanted to try 50mg. That also worked, but I felt a bit too amped up since I usually have one coffee in the morning and another in the afternoon. It was making me feel overstimulated, so I lowered the dose to 25mg and kept my two coffees a day.

Even at 25mg, I was still struggling with insomnia, even though I was taking Vyvanse early in the morning. So I decided to start waking up at 5am and working out first thing in the morning. I’ve been doing that—waking up at 5, going straight to the gym or for a bike ride, then when I get back I take my Vyvanse, shower, and have breakfast. By the time I drink my coffee, the Vyvanse is already kicking in. I noticed it actually works way better this way. Doing exercise early in the morning seems to prime my body—maybe because my heart rate is already up and my body has naturally released cortisol and other hormones to wake me up—so when the Vyvanse hits, the effect is better.

And as for sleep, my insomnia basically disappeared once I started waking up at 5am and exercising early. Even just 30 minutes of exercise raises your body temperature and helps you wake up naturally, and going outside also helps a lot because your eyes get natural light exposure, which makes it easier to wake up naturally and keeps your circadian rhythm in check.

One more tip: take magnesium at night. It really helps relax your muscles and it’s involved in a lot of important processes in the body.

I currently work as a software engineer and do have a lot of free time, I'm primarily a gamer at heart so I want to find someone that I can game with but that's not a requirement.Not that it's important but I did buy a Nintendo switch 2 which I'm very excited about. I love watching anime , movies or shows , if we can hang out on discord (I basically live there) playing games , watching something or just voice calling, I believe that's the best way to know each other. 
I believe to build something special it takes effort and patience and I'm willing to give both. It is probably important to say I have not dated before ever for several reasons so I do wanna put it out there.

I'm someone who's confident in my communication skills and I'd appreciate it if you in some effort in the conversation instead of it being drier than a desert. 

If you haven't read any of that , I'm basically a guy who loves gaming, music ,anime , coffee and sometimes reading.

I just want to find someone with a personality that is genuinely fun , conversations that never stop and just have a kind and friendly personality. It's probably not the best description but I know what I'm looking for. I'm willing to share pictures of me since that's something important. I do have lot of more to say but that can be saved for later when you reach out to me. well I do hope this finds the one right person but not betting on it.",0,1757609119.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.5,False

I jolted out of bed, covered in sweat. The sunlight caressed my face as I examined my room. It was perfectly clean, with my door still intact and slightly ajar. I heard a couple of birds singing and peered outside to see some of the neighborhood kids playing in the street, hoses baptizing them in watery, summer fun. 

Mamá slid her head into the doorway, “Good morning, *mijo*, how are you feeling?” She walked in with some *pozole* on a food tray. 

I crammed myself into the corner of the room on my bed, “Get away! You’re not her!”

“Shh shh, you’re ok *mijo*. No one’s gonna hurt you. *Pobrecito*, you must have had a bad dream. You’re soaked in sweat.” She shushed me as she placed the food on my desk. Mamá sat on the edge of the bed, reaching her hand out. I closed my eyes, expecting death or something worse to embrace me, but was met with her soft, warm skin against my head. “You’re ok, Miguel, it seems like you finally broke that fever.” She smiled and kissed me on the forehead. 

I took in a deep breath as I let her smile wash over me like a heartfelt welcome. I relaxed my body and said, “Mamá, I had this awful nightmare. I had woken up, and all of you were in some sort of strange trance because of that show. Monsters that looked like you and Pops and *Abuela,* and everyone came out of the TV. They took over your bodies and chased me down. I thought I lost you all.” I choked back a couple of tears, from grief and relief that it was just a dream.

“That does sound scary, *mijo*. But don’t worry, we’re protected by the good grace of God. That’s why we say our prayers, right?” She patted the side of my face, the smell of hominy lingering on her hands.

“You’re right, Mamá.” I agreed as I slid off the bed and sat down at my desk to eat the *pozole*. “I always am. Now let me know if you want more. You may not be sick anymore, but you still need to rest and get your strength back. Papá told me they’re supposed to be showing a rerun of that program tonight. It was pretty funny, maybe we can watch it together as a family.” She giggled and left the room. 

As soon as she was gone, *Abuela* came in and gave me a small cup of coffee. “*Un cafecito para Mijito.*” She smelled of masa and coffee like she always did. 

“*Gracias, Abuela*,” I said as I took a sip of the coffee. She hugged my head close to her chest as she always does. I gladly welcomed her warmth, and my heart relaxed knowing my family was ok.

We were talking about favorite coffee shops and I tried to type ""address"" but my phone autocorrected to my ACTUAL FULL ADDRESS. Like street number, apartment number, everything.

I immediately sent like five messages trying to play it off as a weird glitch but they definitely saw it because they read it before I could even panic-delete. They just sent back ""lol your phone just doxxed you"" which could be funny or could be terrifying, I honestly can't tell.

The thing is they seem normal so far but we've literally been talking for two days. They know my first name, what I look like, and now exactly where I live. I reverse searched their number and found their LinkedIn so at least I know they're a real person, but that doesn't mean they're not crazy.

Am I being paranoid or should I be genuinely worried? They haven't said anything weird about it but I keep imagining them just showing up at my door. Should I lie and say I recently moved? Get a Ring camera? Actually move?

One script (called time.sh) just appends the current date to the end of a log file.   
The second one (drinkmore.sh) pops up a message that tells me to drink less coffee and more gin.   
They both have the same permissions set, owned by the same user and work when run from the cli.   
They are both scheduled to run every 2 & 3 (I think I understand this correctly) minutes respectively.

[time.sh](http://time.sh) works.   
[drinkmore.sh](http://drinkmore.sh) does not, or at least it is not popping up the message. To see if was running the script at all, I added a second command to send the current time to a log file.   
That file is being updated every 3 minutes... so the job is running.

He'll then get scolded by his manager and try to slither away with a mountain of excuses. He was funny. I loved hearing his dynamic with his nagging manager. He would get hassled by my coworkers for not doing this and that. They would tease him and pester him back. He was deeply, deeply loved.

They've been together since they were young. I know the rough shape of their shoe but I don't know what size it is. Their grief isn't something I want to but can not comprehend.

There seems to be different types of beans too. Can anyone give any recommendations? I do not know much, but for now, I would like to try something more mellow and less acidic. I dont know if that makes sense. 

Is there any tips or advice you would give to a beginner? 

Is this even the right type of coffee to start with?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Miami Marlins vs. Washington Nationals: A Tale of Two Tacos (and Comebacks)**

The Miami Marlins and Washington Nationals are set to clash on September 11, 2025, in a game that’s less “epic rivalry” and more “two tired office workers arguing over the last coffee.” But let’s break this down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a dad joke.

---

### Parse the Odds: Who’s the Real Deal?

The Marlins (-1.5 run line, decimal odds \~1.85) are the slight favorites, which translates to a **54% implied probability** of winning. The Nationals (+1.5, \~2.00 odds) sit at **50%**, despite starting pitcher Jake Irvin’s 5.71 ERA—a number so high it could double as a ZIP code for “Uh-Oh, Here We Go Again.”

Eury Pérez, Miami’s starter, has a 4.66 ERA, but he’s also thrown four quality starts this season. Think of him as a reliable Uber driver: not the fastest, but he’ll get you there without spilling your coffee. Meanwhile, Irvin’s 1.82 strike-to-walk ratio is about as useful as a screen door on a submarine. The Nationals’ staff looks like a group of accountants trying to pitch—competent in theory, disastrous in practice.

The total is set at 8 runs (even money), which feels about right. Both teams’ offenses are like that one friend who says they’re “trying to eat healthier” but still buys a 12-pack of donuts. The Marlins’ offense, which erupted for 8 runs in their last meeting, proves they can turn on the jets when needed.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Ejections, and Emotional Baggage

The Nationals are carrying the emotional weight of a 3-game losing streak, including that September 10 heartbreaker where they led 3-0 before Miami’s Eric Wagaman single-handedly redefined “comeback kid.” Washington’s interim manager, Miguel Cairo, was ejected in that game after a disputed tag play—imagine being so invested in a “safe” call that you’re willing to trade your dignity for a do-over.

On the bright side, the Nationals’ Robert Hassell III and Luis Garcia Jr. have shown f

My fiancé (38yr male) was diagnosed with ADHD about six years ago and was prescribed Adderall. The prescription itself always felt questionable — it came after a coworker suggested it, right after his dad passed away, and the doctor gave him an extremely high dose (both extended-release and regular tablets). Over time, he’s started misusing it: breaking open capsules, taking it at random times, not tracking his intake, and then skipping it on weekends. What I see now is a roller coaster (he combines the adderall use with multiple energy drinks/coffee and heavy nicotine pouch use). During the week, he’s overstimulated, irritable, forgetful, and snaps at me over small things. On weekends, he crashes — sleeping for hours, checked out, and distant. He doesn’t seem like the person he used to be. The joy and light in him feel replaced with anger and bitterness. It’s starting to look more like addiction than treatment. He procrastinates almost everything — except picking up his medication. He’ll call the doctor early for refills, call the pharmacy over and over, and rush out the second it’s ready. But when I bring up my concerns, he gets angry, defensive, or just walks away. I miss the man I fell in love with, and honestly, I’ve been putting off planning our wedding because I’m not sure I can handle this future without some effort or change on his part.

Right now it feels like Adderall is the third person in our relationship, and I’m emotionally exhausted. How do I cope when he won’t even acknowledge there’s a problem? How do you support someone who pushes you away every time you try to help? A new doctor? Therapy?",3,1757608282.0,AskPsychiatry,5,1.0,False

1nedaj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nedaj7/should_you_try_the_best_french_press_coffee_maker/,Should You Try the Best French Press Coffee Maker AeroPress,"The AeroPress Original coffee maker, model AeroPress Original, promises an innovative twist on brewing that captured my attention as a coffee enthusiast who thrives on daily caffeine rituals. However, I wasn’t sold on my first glance—its compact and somewhat unimposing design left me wondering if it could truly deliver the rich, barista-quality brew I chase every morning. For weeks, I put this compact wonder to the test in my kitchen and even packed it along for a camping trip to see if it lived up to its reputation. Spoiler: there’s a lot to unpack here, both good and… well, less than perfect.

**Innovative Brewing Technology Brought to Life**  
What immediately stood out is the patented 3-in-1 brew method. Unlike the gritty mess I’ve experienced with more traditional coffee presses, this device seamlessly blends pressure, agitation, and micro-filtration to craft a cup of coffee that’s impressively smooth and void of bitterness. It felt like AeroPress took the best parts of espresso brewing and French press designs and made them better. I used both paper and reusable metal filters depending on my mood—both offered a grit-free experience, which was a relief. The 1.87 x 1.87 x 4.63-inch dimensions also make it small enough to store in kitchen drawers or slip into a backpack without displacing other travel essentials.

[See AeroPress Original cost on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b0047biwsk/)  

**Perfect for Outdoor Adventurers**  
Having been burned by some harsh, over-brewed hotel coffee on past trips, I tossed this portable coffee maker into my camping gear to see how it handled life outside my kitchen. Its lightweight and shatterproof design were ideal for camping. On one road trip, I managed to brew a rich cup of wake-me-up juice right by the car using hot water from a thermos. Even when I accidentally crushed it under a tightly packed gear bag, the durable construction held up like a champ—not even a scratch. However, I’ll admit finding the right level of water temperature without a thermometer outdoors added a small layer of challenge.  

**Usage Simplicity and Cleanup**  
Operating the coffee maker proved to be a breeze. Everything about it screamed user-friendly, and trust me, I’ve tried brewing systems that left me scratching my head. All it required was adding coffee grounds, pouring in hot water, stirring, and applying light downward pressure to extract the liquid gold below. The cleanup process? Unbelievably quick—pop out the puck of used grounds, rinse, and you’re done. Compared to the French presses I’ve used, which feel like a never-ending war against stuck particles, this was heaven in seconds.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact and portable for travel or camping.  
- Produces smooth, grit-free, and bitterness-free coffee.  
- Speedy cleanup process saves time.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Learning curve for achieving the perfect water temperature.   
- Small capacity might not suffice if you're making coffee for a group.  

**Strengths Against the Competition**  
When stacking the AeroPress against the classic French press or entry-level espresso machines, its innovation shines. The coffee it produces is smoother and richer, with absolutely no sediment—a pitfall of most French presses. It’s leaps and bounds ahead in portability too; try packing a bulky espresso machine for a camping trip, and you’ll long for something like this. Compared to pod-based coffee makers, there’s no waste generated (yay, environment!) and no need for pods that sometimes run out midweek. However, control freaks who appreciate adjustable temperature controls in more sophisticated machines might find this lacking.  

**Financial Value**  
Debating whether this coffee maker is worth the price was a short-lived dilemma for me. Its blend of portability, barely-there weight, and the quality of its brew stands out in its price segment. I’ve had pricier machines that fail to achieve what the AeroPress can with its straightforward mechanics. Its simple design feels durable enough to last years while providing solid reliability—a significant factor when you’re budgeting for coffee equipment.

Inviting Friends to Faith: Lessons from the Bible
=================================================

Have you ever felt the stirring in your heart to share your faith with a friend but didn’t know how to start? You’re not alone! Let’s explore timeless wisdom from the Bible on how to invite or share your faith with others, making these conversations both impactful and meaningful.

Understanding the Call to Share Faith
-------------------------------------

Sharing faith isn’t just an obligation but a beautiful invitation to bring others into the joy of knowing God. In Matthew 28:19, Jesus commands, “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations.” But what does this look like in daily life?

Building Bridges, Not Barriers
------------------------------

Think about Paul’s approach in Acts 17:22-23. While in Athens, Paul didn’t start by pointing out differences. Instead, he acknowledged what they had in common: spiritual curiosity. He built bridges by connecting with the Athenians where they were.

- **Identify Common Ground:** Start by finding shared interests or experiences. It could be a story from childhood or a shared hobby. This connection lays a foundation for open dialogue.
- **Live Your Faith Authentically:** Your actions speak volumes. As Matthew 5:16 reminds us, “Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.”

Leading with Love and Respect
-----------------------------

When sharing faith, lead with love and respect, as 1 Peter 3:15 suggests: “Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect.”

- **Listen Actively:** Pay attention to your friend’s beliefs and questions. This shows respect and understanding.
- **Share Your Personal Testimony:** Personal stories can be incredibly powerful. Share how faith has changed and shaped your life.

Inviting Conversation
---------------------

Rather than having all the answers, sometimes the best approach is to invite questions and exploration together.

- **Ask Open-Ended Questions:** Instead of telling someone what to believe, ask, “What do you think about faith and God?”
- **Give Thoughtful Responses:** Respond to their questions with sincerity and humility. Admit when you don’t know something, and suggest exploring the answers together.

A Journey, Not a Destination
----------------------------

Remember, sharing faith is more about the journey than reaching a destination. Just as Jesus walked alongside His disciples, be committed to walking alongside your friends.

Reflect on times Jesus took gentle steps with His followers, like His conversations with His disciples after His resurrection (Luke 24:13-35). He listened, encouraged, and revealed truth in a way they could understand.

How Can You Take the Next Step?
-------------------------------

Consider how you can engage someone this week. Is there a friend who might be curious about your beliefs? Take a moment to pray for guidance, and think about asking them to a casual coffee chat or inviting them to a community event.

### Takeaway and Call to Action

Sharing faith is an enriching experience built on love, respect, and genuine connection. Don’t be afraid to start small, and trust that your journey alongside your friend is guided by God’s love.

**We’d love to hear your experiences! Have you ever shared your faith with a friend? What strategies worked for you? Share your stories in the comments below!**

By following these biblical principles, we can inspire curiosity and offer valuable insights into the teachings of Jesus. Remember, it’s a delightful and rewarding journey made one step—and invitation—at a time.

Some laundry products are all talk, but this one genuinely makes an impression. With a packing size of 60 ounces in a convenient two-pack, it seems tailored for households like mine where laundry is an endless battle against stains. Initially, I got it for its promise: ""1st-time stain removal."" Well, let’s put that to the test.

**Performance on Stubborn Stains**

It’s kind of surprising how often ketchup, coffee, and mystery smudges end up on clothes at my place. I pre-treated a few dreadfully stained items, following the directions to treat them while the stains were fresh. Let me tell you, the difference after washing was ridiculous. The stains were gone—almost like my favorite t-shirt hadn’t been baptized in marinara sauce the night before. Even older stains, the ones I had given up on months ago, faded significantly after a couple of treatments. 

[Ready to buy Resolve 062338755519? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://review.sanue.com/p/b078dzyj72/)

**Versatility and Application**

I was pleasantly surprised that this stain remover works across all temperatures. Whether it’s a hot load of whites or cold water for my delicate laundry, this stain remover performed consistently. What’s more, I could safely use it with other laundry detergents and additives without worrying about weird chemical reactions or color damage. Of course, I opted to steer clear of silk and khaki, just as the label warns.

**Strengths**

- Effective on the first try for daily stains like mud, food, and coffee
- Safe for a range of colorfast garments, which is a necessity in my house
- Easy to incorporate into almost any laundry routine  
- Works across all temperature settings with no performance drop-off  
- Unscented formula, ideal for sensitive skin  

**Limitations**

- The need to treat stains promptly is crucial. Procrastinators beware.
- Not suitable for silk, khaki, or fluorescent clothing, so it’s not universally versatile.
- It comes in a refillable bottle but doesn’t include the spray applicator, which might annoy first-timers.  

**Ease of Use and Safety**

This is where things get really practical. The unscented formula was a relief for someone like me who has a picky nose and sensitive family members. There’s none of that overpowering detergent smell clinging to the laundry. However, the pre-treatment application can be tedious if you have an overachieving toddler who likes to use clothes as a napkin.

**Competitive Options**

If you’ve tried other stain removers like Shout or OxiClean, you might think all products in this category are identical. From personal experience, this one overshadows Shout's performance on greasy stains, which it struggled with in my laundry tests. However, OxiClean offers a broader range of applications, like furniture cleaning and carpet stain removal, which this product certainly does not. That said, for purely laundry-focused missions, Spray 'n Wash comes out ahead due to its simpler formula and better results on general fabric stains.

**Affordable Quality**

In terms of cost efficiency for the size and performance, I’m impressed by this refill pack. Honestly, purchasing two 60 oz bottles in one go has saved me from numerous impromptu trips to stock up. It’s a smart option for anyone running a household with active lives (read: messy people). To put it simply, you’re getting excellent results at a reasonable cost. If you treated this bottle like a calculator and divided cost per use, the value would stare you in the face.

let's start with the one regarding Yukimura and Nobuyuki's mother. their mom is none other than Masayuki himself. he's both father and mother. there are a couple possibilities on how it happened:

\- he reproduced through budding and the kids sprouted of him.

\- he's a hermaphrodite. he fucked himself, got knocked up and gave birth to those two.

now let's go for the homie Yoshitsugu. reason why covers his mouth not because he has a maw full of teeth like Venom or a Mortal Kombat character, and not because he has a decayed mouth like a zombie. but what he has for a mouth is a long tentacle which he uses to suck food with. occasionally he'd be seen snaking that appendage from over his mask to empty a bowl of soup in seconds, or secrete a viscous liquid over the more solid food to easily slurp it all up. you'll get used to it once you get over the initial shock.

Magoichi is a sexist prick towards both men and women. if you're a man, you're not worth his time. if you're a woman, you're a lifesize fleshlight. reason why he acts that way is because he's gay towards male horses so he tries too hard to look like a straight normal man.

1ned4nq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeritageWear/comments/1ned4nq/the_duffel_coat_from_cruel_sea_to_campus_bookshop/,The Duffel Coat: From Cruel Sea to Campus Bookshop,"There's something reassuringly British about a duffel coat. Perhaps it's those distinctive horn toggles that twist satisfyingly into place; maybe it's the voluminous hood that promises stiff upper lipped protection from whatever life throws at you. Maybe it's the extra large pockets with room for a copy of Allied Naval Signals and marmalade sandwich. This humble yet essential garment has weathered storms both literal and figurative, across seas, deserts, campuses and streets sailing from military necessity to one of fashion's most enduring winter classics.

# Origins in the Belgian Mills

Although many modern duffel coats are now made of Melton wool, the duffel coat's story begins in the town of Duffel, Belgium, where thick 38oz woolen cloth  was woven as early as the 17th century. This robust fabric, known as ""duffel"" after its place of origin, was prized for its ability to repel water while keeping the wearer warm, qualities that would prove essential for its early adopters.

[Little Town - Big Statue](https://preview.redd.it/fwp60ej3bkof1.jpg?width=194&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e403e1aaad1c6abdffb07bafe81f9e52fed190d1)

The fabric's journey from Belgian looms to typically British wardrobes wasn't immediate. It took the practical needs of seafaring life to transform this simple cloth into the coat we recognize today. The harsh realities of naval service demanded clothing that could withstand salt spray, fierce winds, and the bone-chilling cold of northern waters.

[Rum Ration 1941](https://preview.redd.it/t6fpl76fekof1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3306bc654f849c85679789cfc32795b2b74fee60)

# The Pole Frock

While the duffel *fabric* originated in Belgium, the coat's distinctive silhouette may owe a debt to earlier European military traditions. Some suggest a possible connection between the duffel coat's design and the Polish frock coat, particularly the closures and generous cut that characterized Polish military dress in the 18th and 19th centuries. 

[Polish Frock Coat](https://preview.redd.it/r0jvtdi10kof1.jpg?width=593&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05c789686942c33baeb1d3c76220e365e1a9095d)

The toggle-and-rope closure system bears similarities to the cord fastenings found on various Eastern European military garments. Whether this represents direct influence or parallel design driven by practical needs remains an open debate. What's certain is that by the time the design reached British naval stores, it had evolved into something uniquely suited to life at sea.

# The Royal Navy's Wicked Winds

By the mid-19th century, the Royal Navy had officially adopted the duffel coat as standard issue for its officers and crew. British tailor to the late 19th century Admiralty John Partridge (also credited with the invention of the [Donkey Jacket](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeritageWear/comments/1m2j5sb/a_tale_of_two_donkeys/), with which it shares some features) began producing these Duffel Cloth coats as early as 1887.

[Iron Duke - 1912](https://preview.redd.it/dv5v66260kof1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a7840929681aa98a0abdc32aea13bc33f951799a)

The coat's design was brilliantly practical: the thick double faced boiled wool provided insulation even when wet, while the spacious cut allowed for layering and ease of movement. The wooden horn toggles could be fastened with gloved or freezing hands – a crucial feature when nimble fingers meant the difference between lashing a line and losing it to a gale. The original color for military duffle coats was camel beige. 

[Note The Extra Lashing of Rope Belting](https://preview.redd.it/e7gmh83e0kof1.jpg?width=717&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=70ea03acc15eabb843655b3117ae41d8e734c83b)

The generous hood proved its worth time and time again. Unlike peaked caps or even wooly hats that could blow away in strong winds, the sometimes removable hood stayed put and provided crucial protection for the head and a throat strap provided even more protection against the storm. Some original coats featured thigh straps on the inside of the coat that allowed you to fasten the coat to your sea-legs.

[North Sea Active Service 1942](https://preview.redd.it/sdq4e7dcckof1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18e99d1d62620b89535a8dc74d1ce69177ec3fa9)

By 1930 factories like Ideal Clothing Company (established 1890)  were producing thousands of duffle coats. Dark blue versions of coats for sailors or pilots, and the classic khaki duffle coats were designed as part of the infantry outfit. The Ideal Clothing Company also made shortened duffle coats for British submariners who needed warmth but less bulk inside their cramped quarters.

**Monty/Stirling Style Statement**

The duffel coat's transition from purely functional garment to style icon can be traced to one man: Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, better known as ""Monty"". During World War II, Montgomery made the duffel coat his signature piece, wearing it over his military uniform. Images of Monty in his duffel coat cemented the garment's place in popular imagination. 

[Monty Planning D-day](https://preview.redd.it/fwwqbr6c6kof1.jpg?width=717&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=463ad2583d63dc8c987c19daaebc7961e08aa4f2)

But, Montgomery wasn't alone among distinguished military figures in appreciating the duffel coat's merits – Sir David Stirling, founder of the Special Air Service (SAS), was also known to favor the practical garment during his operations in the desert campaigns.

[Stirling and The LRDG - North Africa](https://preview.redd.it/7ub8nzaf6kof1.jpg?width=630&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=447f5f36501f24b0c1a6f7d9010d6139bb7d89ea)

Here were military leaders who chose practicality over pomp, substance over show. The coat became synonymous with no-nonsense competence and quiet confidence. 

# Post-War Popularity and the Gloverall Revolution

The coat's civilian success caught the attention of Harold and Freda Glover. They ran a small firm H&F Morris and were originally tasked with selling surplus World War II duffle coats from the Ministry of Defense. 

[Ramping Up Civilian Production](https://preview.redd.it/rowpz7vo6kof1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c89807ea17ea6df1c7e447882b738b910a1c9e60)

In 1951 they founded Gloverall who flush with success in the surplus market began producing a more refined design duffel coat.  Their coats featured the traditional buffalo horn toggles, robust rope fastenings, and a distinctive tartan lining that would become a Gloverall signature.

[Tony Brooks - Monaco 1957](https://preview.redd.it/ovp667vu6kof1.png?width=913&format=png&auto=webp&s=846b55f697adc19cef0416accc877a00ed63befb)

Taken up by many outdoorsmen, adventurers and fashionistas as a practical, robust and relatively cheap, long lasting winter coat. Not least among these early adopters was Tony Brooks, the gentleman racer, who was photographed in Gloverall’s Duffel at the Monaco Grand Prix in 1957. 

Even animated characters got in on the act – the beloved Paddington Bear (1958), arriving from Peru with nothing but his hat and a love of marmalade, was immediately outfitted in a bright blue duffel coat.

[Cocteau in YSL with Lady Friends](https://preview.redd.it/9fjn48d27kof1.jpg?width=599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a2f70b05be708cf5eb2dddedcfd348386d4f42e)

The following year French intellectual Jean Cocteau popularized his very own YSL produced version in impractical white. Further cementing the Paris left bank connection was  Brigette Bardot who wore a duffel coat in her role as a murderous bohemian it -girl in 1961’s “The Truth”. 

[Bardot in \\""The Truth\\"" - 1961](https://preview.redd.it/7of10ij87kof1.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ca873b9ea1452d37c80888a129af017ef1e3d58)

**Campus Cool and the Beats**

Even as students of the French new wave embraced the coat's practical credentials and bohemian appeal, British outfitters like Aquascutum and Barbour began producing their own versions, and American companies such as London Fog brought the style across the Atlantic.

Military surplus turned into a civilian uniform, practical yet quietly rebellious. The 1960s saw the duffel coat find a new cultural home on university campuses and among the emerging Beat generation. On college campuses from Oxford to Berkeley, the duffel coat became the unofficial garb of serious students, young intellectuals, and those who prized authenticity over fashion.

[Right On](https://preview.redd.it/lf1nygle9kof1.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc4666e83af99afe4092ad28f3716ed8eff4e234)

Beats appreciated the duffel coat's honest functionality and its rejection of conventional style rules. The coat's generous proportions allowed for layering over turtlenecks and cable-knit sweaters – perfect for late-night coffee shop discussions about Kerouac and Ginsberg, or long walks pondering existential questions.

[Beatniks in Blue](https://preview.redd.it/ofmv3h1p7kof1.jpg?width=675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2943737dc5b59e630857bcc4a41b3a10cbc66ce)

The coat's association with campus life was further cemented in films like Mike Nichols' 1971 ""Carnal Knowledge,"" where the duffel coat appeared as part of the authentic college wardrobe, reinforcing its connection to intellectual coming-of-age stories.

[Jack and Art in \\""Carnal Knowledge\\"" 1971](https://preview.redd.it/wjio0m1u7kof1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0129e00378a3c5cc6fd1c4872eed45a4f2d1e85f)

# Cultural Icon Status

The duffel coat's cultural significance extends far beyond its practical origins. Across mediums, it became associated with intellectualism and artistic sensibility. The image of a writer or student bundled in a duffel coat, perhaps bearing well-worn books and  a thoughtful expression, became a recurring motif in post-war British culture.

But it's place in cinema and audience connection to post-war nostalgia was for ever bound to British and American war movies from “The Third Man” (1949), “Dunkirk” (1958) and The Cruel Sea (1958) to The Guns Of Navaronne (1961).Worn by heroic characters played by John Mills, Gregory Peck, David Niven, Jack Hawkins and Trevor Howard some of whom had seen active service in the war themselves.

[Peck and Niven](https://preview.redd.it/y8ylt9fc8kof1.jpg?width=468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3bc1a44b1b723b42977a69b92276f806cbfcfbf0)

Cinema embraced the coat's visual appeal and character implications. From the windswept romance of British war movies, the duffel coat appeared as a shorthand for reliability under stress and sterling work. 

[Dunkirk - 1958](https://preview.redd.it/3hqysx1r8kof1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=66c385ac4710b082aabcdf110fd2c03b0b531815)

**Modern Interpretations and The Alien**

Today's duffel coats honor this heritage while embracing contemporary needs. Traditional manufacturers like Gloverall continue to produce coats using time-honored methods and materials, while fashion houses experiment with new interpretations. Some feature slimmer cuts, others incorporate technical fabrics for enhanced weather protection, and still others play with colors and proportions to create statement pieces.

[Bowie - 1976](https://preview.redd.it/qrrqctsl8kof1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff913dd494d0537e0aad6bdf358c15d046f2ff6b)

It's the duffel coat’s very nostalgia, its comfort and surety that has sometimes been used as juxtaposition to the strange and alien. Worn by Bowie in Man Who Fell to Earth (1976) to underline his failed attempts to fit in and as more humorous Sci - Fi whimsy and British eccentricity in Dr. Who, being worn by both companions as well as the 7th, 13th and 15th Doctors.  

[Dr. Duffel](https://preview.redd.it/hpxigx849kof1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe6aea08f9abfa8332b8eab16dcd675fa708bf82)

# Enduring Appeal

From Belgian mills to Royal Navy decks, from Monty's back to Hollywood stars, what makes the duffel coat so enduringly appealing? Perhaps it's the honesty of its design – every element serves a purpose, yet the whole somehow transcends mere functionality. The coat represents a sartorial philosophy that values substance over superficiality, longevity over the latest trends.

[Traditional Gloverall](https://preview.redd.it/0u2jvyxj9kof1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fcf35b5f219ea1e4bf4bae003e38cc6c6f35a987)

In an age of fast fashion and disposable everything the duffel coat reminds us that sometimes the best designs are also the simplest, and that function never goes out of fashion. In a world of constant change, the duffel coat remains a reassuring, comforting stalwart: protective, assured and constant. 

**Where To Get Duffeled Up**

One could easily pursue the catalogue of ""Gloverall’s"" latest duffel coats for the “575 Monty”. You will also find versions from ""London Tradition"" with rope fastenings and and also from high end manufacturers ""Macintosh"" and ""Burberry"". The Original Montgomery brand out of the UK provides an excellent coat with original removable hood. Expect to pay between $300 - $600 or even more for a ""designer"" brand

Be aware that some brands are happy to sell you a 90% wool and 10% poly blend. Finding a 100% wool version may find you scouring the second hand listings for an older model (check for intact toggles!) and pay anywhere between $50 and $150. I just picked up a navy Gloverall from 1980s for $40!

The short version seems to be more popular for women's styles but the model “Fairwater Duffle Coat” from Mister Freedom for around $600 is at the top end while ""London Tradition"" also produce a short version the ""The Martin SLM""  for about half that at $300.

1ned3l6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1ned3l6/revenant_a_retrospective/,Revenant - A Retrospective,"I got some thoughts. This is probably the single most divisive issue in Warframe.

Backstory first. Revenant was released in 2018. His placeholder name was Vlad, and he was hyped as a true vampire Warframe. We've had Garuda, who dances in blood and is a big fan of impaling, but Revenant was to be a more mystical vampire. Enthralling the mind, walking through mist. He was given an Eidolon theming as the supposed source of his powers. However, this mesh of ideas did not work, either in the themes, or in gameplay.

Revenant's first three abilities are set to fit the vampiric gimmick. He makes thralls who can spread the enthrallment. His 2 was a really interesting form of survivability, resisting instances of damage rather than having a total amount of durability to be eaten through. This made him really resistant big damages like Bombards but weak to rapid shot like Heavy Gunners. Then his 3 lets him turn to mist, dash through enemies and thralls, and sap their essence. Eidolons, however, are very different. Eidolons are big hulking monstrosities with lasers and shockwaves abound. So, they made Revenant's passive be a big knockdown shockwave when he loses his shields - very in tune with Eidolon combat. In addition, his 4 is the ultimate laser light show, spinning around like a top shooting lasers out everywhere - and absolutely butchering his own thralls.

This is the first issue, and the point at which DE should have stopped and reconsidered. Revenant never should have been one Warframe. This always should have been two. One enthralling, mystical, slippery Warframe, and one shield tank, master of lasers. These concepts do not work together. Not at all. On release, Revenant was honestly the worst Warframe in the game. I placed him first in line in the list of Warframe needing a rework the very update he released. Even Mesmer Skin didn't fit his kit. His Passive and his 3 deal with running out and restoring shield, but Mesmer Skin blocks instances of damage. Shield has nothing to do with that. Nothing worked.

He needed a rework. Badly. They instead gave him a seemingly minor buff. His whole kit is bad, and Mesmer Skin does not keep him alive at all. What if, they thought, we give it a slight buff. Whenever Mesmer Skin consumes a stack, he becomes invincible for a second. Make Mesmer Skin last a bit longer. Make him a bit tankier. How bad could it be?

How bad could it be?

Revenant is now the most boring yet common Warframe in the game. He is by far the most durable, with fans proudly touting how they can just walk away from the computer to get a cup of coffee and come back and be just fine. However, he doesn't do anything. He just sits there, not dying. He's great at not doing stuff, he's not gonna die while he sits there doing nothing, but oh boy is he not gonna do anything. They never reworked him. They never *fixed* his *problem*. His kit still does not work at all. And the worst part is - they *can't* rework him. They *can't* fix him. Because any fix for the rest of his kit would be a buff. And they can't buff the overwhelmingly best Warframe in the game, that would be insane behavior.

This is the exact same Valkyr problem. This is the issue people didn't understand, and it's far worse for Revenant. They couldn't buff Valkyr because invincibility does not and cannot mesh with a kit. It's too powerful. In order to increase her damage, in order for her armor and life steal to mean anything, in order to give her a death resistance passive, they *had* to strip invincibility. Now it interacts with her kit. Now it can be balanced. If she's too weak, they *can* buff her more, because she's not OP by means of invincibility. And yet, in doing so, the fan went into an insane uproar. Revenant *needs* a rework badly, he always has, and now more than ever. But if this is how the fanbase reacted after giving Valkyr the rework she needed, imagine the fucking vitriol if they do the same for Revenant.

tl;dr 100% Invulnerability is a bad mechanic actually. It makes it impossible to buff anything else because that one mechanic already makes the Warframe overpowered. DE was 100% in the right to strip it in Valkyr and give her a real kit and they need to do it to Revenant next, but they can't because the community likes its safety bubble.",0,1757607484.0,Warframe,8,0.38,False

1ned33m,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1ned33m/question_after_endoscopy/,Question after endoscopy,"Hi all, just wondering if anyone else had any insight. 

I had my endoscopy on Tuesday, went well overall, they found mild gastritis and suspicion of Barrett’s Esophagus. Waiting on biopsy for final results. 

I was honestly shocked to hear that I might have Barrett’s. I am a 42 year old woman, non-smoker (for life), don’t drink alcohol, never overweight, never really consumed most GERD triggers other than coffee daily and/or diet carbonated beverages. I don’t eat tomato sauce, onions, garlic, spicy food, fatty or fried foods, citrus, or dairy. I cut that all of that out years ago due to dietary preference and health. Would have reflux/gastritis episodes after being on NSAIDs for more than a week, but always resolved once I stopped taking the medication. 

I started experiencing MILD reflux (like once or twice a week) in January, which turned into severe GERD symptoms in mid-June. 

I am eating an extremely bland diet now, cut out all the possible triggers, basically following the alkaline diet. Yet I still have reflux symptoms, and have to take 40 mg pantoprazole and 40 mg of Pepcid to control them. This is concerning to me because I don’t want to be on PPIs for the rest of my life AND maintain such a strict diet. I’ve lost 12 lbs already and will only lose more. And frankly, the simple carbs I’m eating (saltines and white rice) don’t trigger my reflux but aren’t exactly “healthy” compared to what I used to eat. 

The only thing I can think of that may be triggering the reflux now is the 81 mg aspirin I take daily, but the doctor said that’s very unlikely. I’ve taken it as secondary prevention for the last three years. Has anyone else had GERD develop due to low dose aspirin? Did it get better once you stopped taking it? 

Also, doesn’t it take years to develop Barrett’s? Does that mean I’ve had silent reflux for a long time and wasn’t aware? 

EDIT: was told my LES looked normal, but just to stay away foods that relax it, which I already do. ",2,1757607455.0,GERD,0,0.76,False
