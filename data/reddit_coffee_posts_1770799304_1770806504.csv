1r1tzka,https://www.reddit.com/r/kindregards/comments/1r1tzka/ignorant_starbucks/,Ignorant Starbucks,"Well, there a lot of brands that are ignorant of environment around them. And although, I've personally loved this brand (because of Mr. Tata), I'm done negotiating with them to exhibit basic kindness. 

While a lot of the outlets in India, take care of animals around them, majority of them are extremely ignorant. This can't be blamed to Mr. Tata or his associates, but to the current management who is responsible of running this chain. 

Something has shifted drastically in their compassion scale and we just can't stay quiet anymore. 

  
Almost a month ago, on a Sunday evening, I visited Starbucks Matunga. I was sitting outside sipping coffee, when I heard two tiny kittens meowing rigorously. They were in a basement compound of the same building, which was easily accessible by Starbucks from the top. The way was only accessible through GNMS Khalsa College, which was closed due to Sunday. 

  
After having multiple conversations and almost arguments with some of the staff members, I received help from one of them who was compassionate but wasn't allowed to help animals openly. He helped me with a rope and a bowl through which we provided food to these babies. I left a full pack of cat food outside which the customers could use to feed them daily. 

  
A month later, I found these kittens again, meowing back at me. Since then, the same bowl was being used (which had turned extremely dirty). So I requested the staff to help me with a disposable bowl to replace in the rope. To which I was denied with the most stupidest reason in the world ""We don't have bowls"" 

We are talking about a cafe chain which sells their basic product at 350 INR across the country, and they had no bowl to help two tiny kittens. 

The staff was extremely rude and reluctant to help and I'm disappointed not just as a consumer, but a human who loved Mr. Tata dearly. I know this wasn't how he must have imagined the brand to be shaped one day. 

  
Although I fought my way through to help them (Starbucks did no shit), it just feels so overwhelming every time to fight 5 humans to literally help a baby.

This needs to change now. I want this to reach to the management of Starbucks, who look into this, and feel shameful about this act and do something about it. ",1,1770806180.0,kindregards,0,1.0,False

This morning, I walk in and there’s this guy in front of me. Tall, obviously. Probably like 6’6 and had a wedding ring on. He approaches the counter and she gives him THE smile. You know the one. Laughing, holding eye contact, the whole performance like he’s the best part of her shift. He’s just ordering a coffee, he’s not being charming, he’s literally just saying words and she is eating it up. Laughing at nothing. The whole thing.

Then he leaves and it’s my turn and it’s like a light switch immediately flipped. Not ‘customer service autopilot’, like I was the LAST thing she wanted to see, like she was disappointed to see me standing there approaching the counter. ‘What can I get you.’ Not even a question mark at the end of it, that’s how flat her voice was. I had never spoken to this girl in my life aside from ordering coffee. Never been rude to her, never been weird, nothing. This was a physical reaction ONLY. She looked at me and her brain went “no” and she didn’t even try to hide it. She was RADIANT 10 seconds before, all that was missing was a hair twirl and a fucking lip bite, for a married man. But even that guy on autopilot was more worthy of her energy than me just standing there.

I’m so tired man. I’m tired of noticing it. Im tired of developing my personality and my mind and my interests because ‘that’s what really matters’ and then watching it not matter at all, over and over again, every single day. I have read more books this year, just in February, than that guy has probably read in his entire life. I can talk about literally anything. None of it matters. I watch guys like him walk through the world not even knowing how easy they have it, not even aware that the girl behind the counter lit up for them, because that’s just what happens to them. They think that’s normal. They think everyone gets treated like that. 

We don’t. She looked at the last guy and lit up. She looked at me and dimmed. That’s it. That’s the whole story.

This is what guys like me deal with every single day and nobody wants to talk about it. Women will literally tell you ‘I don’t care about height, I care about personality and connection’ and then you WATCH IN REAL TIME as they completely shift there entire demeanor based on physical appearance alone.",4,1770805878.0,shortguys,2,1.0,False

I have a fairly good relationship with my spirit team and felt like offering something to them as a token of my appreciation and love. This could be incense, coffee, honey, chocolate etc. I would feel they sort of communicate what they wanted that particular day besides incense. 

It started as an offering to my spirit team but broaden up because I realized that it was smart to also have a good relationship with other spirits who might be around. I would call upon everyone that I could sense to feast on the offering and ask them to leave to their respective homes / dimension etc and close the circle.

I did a spell  recently where I could feel other spirits besides my team «fly off» to do my bidding without being invoked. But then afterwards I was «asked» to offer up some chicken bones and got a little scared. I have never given them actual meat or bones and I’m a bit confused.

1r1tmud,https://v.redd.it/pse674n3buig1,Why Most Language Apps Won't Prepare You for Actually Living in Portugal (And What Actually Works) 🇵🇹,"When my wife and I moved to Portugal from Australia in December 2022, she'd been using a popular language app for six months. She was confident. She had a 200-day streak. She could conjugate verbs.

Then she tried to order coffee in Lisbon and the barista looked at her like she was speaking Mandarin.

The problem? She'd been learning Brazilian Portuguese. And while the apps claimed to teach ""Portuguese,"" they were teaching her phrases that made her sound completely foreign in Lisbon, Porto, or anywhere in Portugal.

Here's what I learned about actually integrating into Portuguese life after living here for over two years:

# Language Learning Alone Isn't Integration

You can memorize 5,000 vocabulary words and still struggle to navigate Portuguese society. Why? Because integration requires understanding:

**The Cultural Context** When do you say ""bom dia"" vs ""boa tarde""? (Hint: it's not based on the clock – it's based on when you've eaten lunch)

Why do Portuguese people stand at the counter to drink coffee instead of taking it ""para levar""?

What's the deal with all those public holidays, and why does everything shut down in August?

**The Practical Systems** How does AIMA actually work when you're trying to get residency?

What do you say at the pharmacy when you need something for a headache?

How do you handle going to the doctor when medical vocabulary wasn't in your textbook?

**The Real Conversations** The app taught you formal Portuguese. But the mechanic, the electrician, and your neighbour don't talk like textbooks.

Nobody says ""Como está você?"" in Portugal. They say ""Como está?"" or more likely ""Tudo bem?""

# What Actually Worked For Us

After watching my wife struggle (and struggling myself), I built something different. Not another vocabulary app, but a complete integration tool.

**Real Conversation Scenarios** Instead of abstract lessons, you practice actual situations: ordering at a café, going to the pharmacy, talking to your landlord, dealing with the post office, booking a hotel.

These aren't just vocabulary lists – they're complete conversations with native speaker audio, so you hear how Portuguese people in Portugal actually speak.

**European Portuguese, Actually** Every word, every phrase, every audio recording is from native speakers in Lisbon and Porto. Not São Paulo. Not Rio. Portugal.

When you learn ""autocarro"" for bus (not ""ônibus""), ""comboio"" for train (not ""trem""), and ""pequeno-almoço"" for breakfast (not ""café da manhã""), you sound like you actually live here.

**The Culture & Systems Integration** You get the AIMA immigration guide right in the app – because navigating Portuguese bureaucracy is part of living here.

You learn about Portuguese public holidays, so you're not confused when everything's closed.

You read stories about Portuguese history, food culture, festivals, and modern life – because understanding why Portuguese people do things helps you fit in.

**Progressive Learning That Matches Your Life** The app has structured CEFR levels (A1 to C2), but you can also jump straight to the topics you need *right now*. Moving into an apartment? Go to the housing vocabulary. Starting work? Jump to professional Portuguese.

There's an AI conversation partner (Amigo) that adapts to your level, so you can practice speaking without the pressure of a real person judging your accent.

**Making It Stick** Here's the thing about language learning – you forget 80% of what you study unless you use it repeatedly. So the app has 20+ games that make you actively recall vocabulary, conjugate verbs, build sentences, and recognize patterns.

There's a global leaderboard because competition works. You earn stars. You track progress. It's not just ""study harder"" – it's making the practice actually engaging.

**For The Whole Family** If you have kids, there's a visual learning section designed for children – because if you're moving here as a family, everyone needs to integrate.

# The Honest Truth

I'm biased because I built this after living through the frustration myself. But here's what I know from two+ years in Portugal:

You can't separate language learning from cultural integration. They're the same thing.

You can't prepare for Portuguese life with Brazilian Portuguese any more than you can prepare for British life by learning American English. Close, but fundamentally different.

And you can't integrate into a country by just memorizing words. You need context, culture, systems, and real-world practice.

The app is called **Portugal Lifestyle Pro**. It's got 500+ lessons, 20+ games, conversation practice with AI, cultural stories, travel guides for Lisbon/Porto/Algarve/Madeira/Azores, and the AIMA immigration guide.

iOS: [https://apps.apple.com/pt/app/portugal-lifestyle-pro/id6757080577?l=en-GB](https://apps.apple.com/pt/app/portugal-lifestyle-pro/id6757080577?l=en-GB)

Website: [portugal-lifestyle.com](http://portugal-lifestyle.com)

Android version coming soon (I promise).

**But whether you use my app or not, here's my advice:**

* Learn European Portuguese specifically, not Brazilian
* Practice real conversations, not just vocabulary
* Understand the culture, not just the language
* Start with what you need *now* (pharmacy, grocery, coffee) then expand
* Actually speak, even if you sound terrible at first

The Portuguese are incredibly patient with learners. They appreciate effort way more than perfection. But they'll appreciate it even more if you sound like you're actually trying to integrate into *Portugal*, not just ""any Portuguese-speaking country.""

Anyone else have integration stories? What surprised you most about actually living in Portugal vs learning the language?",1,1770804919.0,LearningPortuguesePT,0,1.0,False
1r1tmtt,https://i.redd.it/0k0lj1e17uig1.png,I think Cai Wenji is great. Stop slandering my Dynasty Warriors waifu.,"Every time Cai Wenji is brought up, she gets slandered and people shit on her asking why she's even a character. 

The unfortunate fact is, due to history and the role of men and women in the past, I really don't think you can make a huge case for ANY female character to be a major character in the series. Any historical or romanticized female we have only get brief spotlights in the grand scheme of things. I think Cai Wenji, as a tragic figure who get abducted by nomads, historical calligrapher with poems, and a devoted wife is perfectly fine as an addition to Wei character.

I think she suffers from post DW6 syndrome: we don't get Musou story mode which has been traded for simple historical story mode where you play as multiple characters. And DW 9 sucked. Because of that she gets disregarded as a boring characters who adds nothing to to the story.

I think if you actually play her, you couldn't be more wrong. One of the things I like is that she shares a platonic level of trust with Cao Cao and understands him. If you play as her and read her interactions with Cao Cao in the various games, you find that she's a gentle woman who wants peace but understands that Cao Cao is taking the role of a villain to bring about that peace. Even though she does not fully agree with his ruthless methods, she understands his situation, why he needs to do them, and fights for him for the sake of peace. This goes even beyond characters like Xiahou Dun in some games where he openly criticizes Cao Cao and literally states he cannot understand Cao Cao. If we had a new game with story mode focused on person character growth and dialogue, I think Cai Wenji has plenty potential.

Beyond that I absolutely love how forward she is if you interact with her in Empires and max bond her. If you max bond with her in Ambition Mode in DW8, one of her quotes is ""On the night of the next new moon... Could you come to my chambers? With no moonlight, everything will be shrouded in darkness. So... I might not be able to play the harp, but..."" With all the other female characters who just blush and act embarrassed, or act like a psycho obsessed (Zhang Chunhua, Zhen Shi), I vastly appreciate someone who elegantly says ""Come up to my room for some late night coffee.""

Also, she's gorgeous. ",8,1770804917.0,dynastywarriors,1,0.83,False

i basically got raises over time just like any other collegue, because the company is required to. i found out recently that they stopped doing this 3 years ago. i have a handicap and they found out they are not required to treat me the same as other collegues, so they stopped. i already took some free legal advice and i ""deserve"" the money just like any other collegue. my contract says i should get it, i always got it and thats a reason in my country to keep getting it, but in a long long document form of specific rules it was found that the company is not neccacarily required to pay me those raises in pay. they should have given me a other contract then, but they didnt.

im also the only employee that doesnt get a work phone, and they even made comments a longer time ago that i shouldnt grab chocolate milk from the coffee machine because its for guests.

the thing is, you would maybe argue i should get out and find something else, but my contract here is fixed, so its some certainty for our lives, and i can really get along with all the collegues. we help out each other where we can and even with management we are talking about random worldy stuff that you expect from a cantina.

the company did tell me that they will not pay me those raises, so it feels like betrayal and sad that im treated like a outcast somewhat. the legal advice i have gotten says my case is solid and it should be easy to win a case.

but that requires threatening the management that i want to take these steps, and/or take the actual steps. and i dont feel comfortable by it. yet i also dont feel comfortable with it staying like this.

i had prayer about this and also went to some brothers in our church about this, but i have not gotten much clarity on what to do. the government was made for us by God, which would then imply we can use legal means to defend this injustice in my opinion. or i can quote the verse to turn the other cheek. 

i would just like some advice from fellow brothers and sisters in Christ on what to do.",1,1770804912.0,Christianity,2,1.0,False

we were drinking at home and smoked one and we were sitting on the bed about to go smoke another one and he shoved me to the side as i was about to get up and almost fell against a table that’s next to the bed but i stopped myself from falling. 

i was like WTF and he at first he said he meant to do it to help me get out of bed but didn’t mean for me to almost get hurt. so to not make things awkward and i was high i started to make jokes about it and we laughed a lot. 

so he started to get out of bed (i had got back to my original sitting place and he was in the middle of the bed) he had used my legs for support to get out of bed and i jokingly acted as i was about to push his arms so he’d fall (but i didn’t) and we were laughing when suddenly he slapped me.

1r1tfod,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsetConqueror/comments/1r1tfod/how_to_make_people_talk_more_than_they_meant_to/,# How to Make People Talk More Than They Meant To: Psychology Tricks That Actually Work,"I spent way too much time studying interrogation tactics, therapy techniques, and sales psychology because I was tired of surface-level conversations. Started digging into FBI manuals, hostage negotiation research, and social engineering books. Turns out there's actual science behind getting people to open up, and it's not what you think.

Most people think being a ""good listener"" means nodding and saying ""uh-huh"" a lot. That's bullshit. Real conversational depth comes from understanding cognitive biases, strategic silence, and subtle psychological triggers. I tested these techniques everywhere, from dates to work meetings to random coffee shop chats. The difference was insane.

Here's what actually works:

**Use the ""Pause Power"" technique:** When someone finishes talking, just wait. Count to 4 in your head before responding. Sounds weird but people HATE silence and will automatically fill it with more info. They'll elaborate, add context, reveal stuff they didn't plan to share. This works because our brains interpret silence as ""they want more"" even when that's not explicitly said. FBI negotiators use this constantly. The discomfort of dead air makes people spill way more than they intended.

**Master the ""Echo Effect"":** Repeat the last 2-3 words someone said as a question. They say ""I'm stressed about work"" and you go ""stressed about work?"" Something about hearing their own words reflected back makes them dive deeper. It's like a verbal mirror that signals you're tracking without being pushy. [Never Split the Difference](https://a.co/d/0cNz8vsl) by Chris Voss breaks this down perfectly. Voss is a former FBI hostage negotiator who used these exact tactics in life or death situations. The book won multiple awards and became a Wall Street Journal bestseller for a reason. This is the best negotiation book I've ever read. After finishing it, I realized how many conversations I was completely fumbling. Voss explains mirroring, tactical empathy, and calibrated questions in a way that's immediately applicable. Insanely good read if you want to level up your communication game.

**Ask ""How"" and ""What"" instead of ""Why"":** ""Why"" questions make people defensive. Their brain goes into justification mode. But ""How did that happen?"" or ""What was that like?"" opens them up. It's less accusatory, more exploratory. People relax and share more freely. I learned this from therapy research, therapists never ask ""why did you do that"" because it triggers shame spirals.

**Give them a ""label"" for their emotion:** Say stuff like ""sounds like you're frustrated"" or ""seems like that really bothered you."" When you name what they're feeling, they feel SEEN. And when people feel seen, they keep talking. It's called tactical empathy. You're not agreeing or disagreeing, just acknowledging. This creates psychological safety which is the foundation for vulnerability.

**Use minimal encouragers strategically:** Little sounds like ""mmm"" or ""yeah"" or head nods, but place them RIGHT when someone pauses. It signals ""keep going"" without interrupting their flow. Most people do this randomly. Do it intentionally at transition points and watch how much more they share. It's like giving micro-rewards that encourage continued disclosure.

**Drop your status slightly:** If you want someone to open up, make yourself a bit vulnerable first. Share something slightly embarrassing or admit you don't know something. People mirror emotional disclosure. If you're guarded, they're guarded. If you crack open first, they follow. [The Like Switch](https://a.co/d/08oTJqSm) by Jack Schafer (former FBI Special Agent) explains this concept brilliantly through the friendship formula. Schafer spent his career getting spies and criminals to confess by building rapport. The book teaches you how to become instantly likeable using behavioral psychology. It's wild how applicable these ""spy tactics"" are to normal life.

If you want to go deeper but don't have the energy to read through all these books and research papers, there's this personalized learning app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from communication experts, negotiation research, and psychology books to create custom audio lessons.

You can type in something like ""I'm introverted and struggle with deeper conversations, want to improve my communication skills"" and it builds a structured learning plan just for you. The depth is adjustable too, you can do a quick 10-minute overview or switch to 40-minute deep dives with real examples when something clicks. Plus you get to pick the voice, some people swear by the deep conversational tone, others prefer something more energetic. It's built by AI experts from Google, so the content pulls from verified sources and stays science-based. Makes it way easier to internalize these tactics without forcing yourself through dense textbooks.

**Ask the ""magic question"":** After someone shares something, ask ""what else?"" Not ""anything else"" but ""WHAT else."" The phrasing assumes there's more to share, so they search for it. Keep asking ""what else?"" until they're truly empty. Most conversations stop way too early. This pushes past the first layer into actual depth.

**Match their energy but slightly lower:** If someone's talking fast and excited, match it but dial down 10%. If they're slow and thoughtful, do the same but slightly less intense. This is called pacing and leading. You create rapport by matching, then lead them somewhere deeper by being just a touch calmer. Makes them feel comfortable unconsciously.

Here's the thing, these techniques work because they hack into how our brains actually process conversation and trust. We're wired to respond to certain social cues. The gap between casual chat and real connection isn't about luck or charisma. It's about understanding behavioral psychology and using it intentionally. Most people never learn this stuff, so they keep having the same shallow conversations wondering why nobody opens up to them. The tools exist, you just have to actually use them.",1,1770804218.0,MindsetConqueror,0,1.0,False

You think you’re in control of your decisions. but AI has been politely helping you all along. 

That song suggestion you didn’t know you needed. 

That “perfect” product ad that appeared at exactly the wrong (or right) time. 

That route change that saved you 20 minutes but somehow knew you were already late. 

AI didn’t knock on your door and introduce itself. It simply moved in, unpacked quietly, and started making life more efficient without asking for credit. 

At [Deemsys.ai](http://Deemsys.ai), we like to call this the quiet intelligence takeover. No drama. No robots. [Just smarter decisions](https://deemsys.ai/services/ai-solutions-and-automation) happening in the background. 

AI in Your Daily Life (Yes, Even Before Coffee)

Before you’ve fully opened your eyes in the morning, [AI](https://deemsys.ai/services/ai-solutions-and-automation) is already awake and working. 

Your alarm adjusts based on your sleep pattern. 

Your phone decides which notifications are “important.” 

Your news feed filters what it thinks you should care about today (and what you probably won’t). 

You didn’t tell it to do this. You didn’t even notice. 

And that’s the point. 

AI doesn’t interrupt it observes. It learns. Then it gently nudges you toward what it believes is the best option, like a very quiet friend who somehow always knows what you want. 

**From Guesswork to “How Did It Know?”** 

Remember when recommendations were random and slightly annoying? 

“People who bought this also bought. Something completely irrelevant.” 

Those days are gone. 

Today’s AI learns from behavior, not assumptions. Every scroll, pause, click, and search becomes a data point. Over time, AI stops guessing and starts predicting. 

That’s why: 

Your playlist feels personally curated 

Your shopping suggestions feel suspiciously accurate 

Your content feed feels like it knows you 

[AI doesn’t read minds](https://deemsys.ai/services/ai-solutions-and-automation), but it’s very good at connecting dots. And humans leave a lot of dots behind. 

**AI at Work: The Smartest Team Member Who Never Takes Breaks** 

In businesses, AI has quietly become the most reliable decision-support system in the room. 

It doesn’t replace teams. It doesn’t attend meetings. It doesn’t argue. 

It simply shows up with facts, patterns, and predictions and lets [humans decide what to do next](https://deemsys.ai/services/machine-learning-integration). 

AI helps businesses answer questions like: 

* Which leads are actually worth following up on? 
* What’s likely to sell next month, not last month? 
* Where are we losing money without realizing it? 
* What decision today prevents a problem tomorrow? 

While humans bring experience and intuition, AI brings clarity at scale. At [Deemsys.ai](http://Deemsys.ai), we see AI as the colleague who handles heavy thinking so people can focus on creativity and strategy. 

**The Shift from “Reacting” to “Knowing”** 

Traditionally, decisions happened after something went wrong. 

Sales dropped → analyze reports → panic → act 

Inventory ran out → investigate → apologize → fix 

AI flips this model. 

By spotting patterns early, AI enables proactive decisions. It sees trends forming before they become problems. It highlights risks before they grow expensive. It turns “Oh no” moments into “Good thing we caught that early” moments. 

That’s not magic. That’s data learning from itself. 

**But Can We Trust AI?** 

Good question and an important one. 

[AI may be quiet](https://deemsys.ai/services/machine-learning-integration), but it shouldn’t be mysterious. As AI influences more decisions, transparency and responsibility matter more than ever. 

People may not see AI working, but they feel its impact. That’s why ethical design, explainable insights, and human oversight are essential. 

At [Deemsys.ai](https://deemsys.ai/), we believe AI should support decisions not secretly control them. Intelligence should be helpful, fair, and accountable, even when it’s working behind the scenes. 

**Humans Aren’t Being Replaced They’re Being Upgraded** 

Despite the jokes and headlines, AI isn’t here to “take over.” It’s here to collaborate. 

Humans bring: 

* Judgment 
* Creativity 
* Context 
* Values 

AI brings: 

* Speed 
* Accuracy 
* Pattern recognition 
* Scalability 

Together, they make better decisions than either could alone. 

The smartest outcomes happen when humans stay in charge and [AI stays smart ](https://deemsys.ai/services/ai-solutions-and-automation)

**The Quiet Revolution Is Already Happening** 

AI doesn’t announce itself every time it improves your decision making. It doesn’t ask for applause. It just works. 

That’s what makes this revolution different. It’s not loud. It’s not obvious. It’s simply effective. 

Everyday decisions are becoming faster, smarter, and more personalized without adding complexity to our lives. 

At [Deemsys.ai](https://deemsys.ai/), we’re proud to build AI that works quietly, responsibly, and intelligently helping people and businesses make better decisions without even realizing how smarter they’ve become. 

Sometimes, the [best intelligence](https://deemsys.ai/services/ai-solutions-and-automation) is the one you don’t notice until life just starts working better. ",1,1770804116.0,u_WoodpeckerMoist4807,0,1.0,False

We watched TV, had dinner, wine and eventually became cosy. We had sex, I stayed the night and cuddled her to sleep. I left at 5.30am to go to work while she was still asleep. Once she woke up for work a few hours later, her messages with me were short. She eventually told me it was a “one night thing” then deleted me off instagram. I understand that we were unlikely to eventuate into something further but I am shocked at the brutality of this. I could not spend the night with a woman like this then cut her off so quickly.

Most people think love fades because ""[the spark dies](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450)"" or ""people grow apart."" But here's what I found: the problem isn't that love ends, it's that we never learned what love actually IS after the honeymoon phase. We confuse the drug high of early romance with actual love, then panic when our brain chemistry normalizes. 



Society romanticizes the butterflies but never teaches us that sustainable love is a completely different animal. The good news? Once you understand the actual mechanics, staying in love becomes less mystical and way more achievable.



Here's what actually keeps long term relationships alive:



\*\*stop treating your partner like a mind reader\*\*



The number one killer of long term relationships isn't cheating or money, it's unexpressed needs festering into resentment.[ Dr. John Gottman's research ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450)(he can predict divorce with 94% accuracy, insane) found that successful couples make their needs stupidly explicit. 



Not ""I wish you'd be more thoughtful"", but ""when you're on your phone during dinner, I feel disconnected. Can we do 20 minutes of no phones while we eat?"" 



The book ""Hold Me Tight"" by Dr. Sue Johnson is criminally underrated for this. She developed emotionally focused therapy after studying thousands of couples. Her main point: we're wired for attachment, and most fights aren't about dishes or sex, they're about ""are you there for me?"" This book completely changed how I understand relationship conflicts. Best relationship book I've read, period.



\*\*build a friendship that could survive without the sex\*\*



Super uncomfortable truth: sexual attraction fluctuates. Illness happens, stress happens, bodies change, libido shifts. 



Research from the Gottman Institute shows couples who stay together long term have a ""fondness and admiration system"", basically they genuinely like each other as people. They're curious about each other's inner worlds, they laugh together, they'd choose to hang out even if sex wasn't on the table.



If you removed physical intimacy from your relationship, would you still want to spend time together? That's your litmus test.



\*\*accept that you'll fall in and out of love multiple times with the same person\*\*



This one fucked me up when I first read it. Esther Perel (relationship therapist who's worked with couples for 30+ years) talks about this in her podcast ""Where Should We Begin?"" The idea that you'll have multiple relationships within your relationship because both people evolve.



You're not the same person at 25, 35, 45. Neither is your partner. Successful couples renegotiate their relationship as they grow instead of clinging to who they used to be. 



The couples who make it don't avoid change, they get curious about who their partner is becoming and decide to keep choosing each other through the transitions.



\*\*create rituals of connection that are non negotiable\*\*



Doesn't matter if it's coffee together every morning, a weekly walk, or a monthly overnight somewhere. The couples who last have small, consistent ways they reconnect. 



It's not about grand gestures. It's about whether you have systems in place to prevent drift. Because drift is silent and deadly. You don't notice it until you're basically roommates who occasionally have sex.



The app Paired is actually decent for this, it sends daily questions to both partners that spark real conversations. Not sponsored, just genuinely helpful for maintaining emotional intimacy when life gets chaotic.



If you want something more structured and personalized for building better relationship habits, there's also[ BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), an AI learning app that pulls from relationship psychology research, expert therapists like Gottman and Perel, and all the books mentioned here to create customized audio learning plans. You can set specific goals like ""communicate needs without starting fights"" or ""rebuild emotional intimacy after kids"" and it generates podcasts tailored to your situation. You control the depth (10 minute overview or 40 minute deep dive with real examples) and can pick voices that actually keep you engaged, from calm and warm to more direct styles. It's useful when you're too exhausted to read another relationship book but still want to actively work on things.



\*\*learn to fight without destroying each other\*\*



Conflict is inevitable. The question is whether you fight dirty or clean. Gottman identified four behaviors that predict divorce, he calls them the four horsemen: criticism, contempt, defensiveness, stonewalling.



Successful couples argue (sometimes intensely) but they avoid personal attacks, they take breaks when flooded, they repair quickly. They see conflict as ""us versus the problem"" not ""me versus you.""



""The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work"" by John Gottman lays this out with actual research backed strategies. It's based on his love lab where he literally studied thousands of couples and tracked who stayed together. This book will make you question everything you thought you knew about relationships. Insanely good read.



\*\*maintain separate identities and interests\*\*



Codependency masquerades as love but it's actually fear. Healthy long term love requires two whole people choosing to share their lives, not two halves trying to complete each other.



Keep your friendships, your hobbies, your goals. Give your partner space to do the same. You should enhance each other's lives, not be each other's entire lives.



\*\*recognize repair attempts and accept influence\*\*



This is subtle but huge. When your partner tries to de escalate during conflict (makes a joke, reaches for your hand, softens their tone), do you let them? Or do you stay stuck in your righteousness?



Couples who last are good at catching repair attempts and running with them. They're also willing to be influenced by their partner, to actually change their mind or behavior based on their partner's perspective.



\*\*understand love languages are real but overused\*\*



Yeah the five love languages (words of affirmation, quality time, physical touch, acts of service, gifts) matter. But here's what matters more: being willing to speak your partner's language even when it's not natural to you.



Love isn't just feeling it, it's demonstrating it in ways your partner can actually receive. That requires ongoing attention and effort, not just taking a quiz once and calling it done.



Look, no one talks about this because it's not romantic. It's not a fairytale. Sustainable love is built on friendship, intentional effort, good communication skills, and the decision to keep showing up even when it's not easy.



The chemicals that created the initial high will fade. But if you understand that real love is what you build after that, you're already ahead of most people. It's less about finding the perfect person and more about being willing to do the work with an imperfect human who's also willing to do the work.

My foot slipped on the ice, as we hiked to the top of the hill. My friend caught me not letting my knees touch the ground. We hiked on until we reached the rest stop a few kilometers in. We ordered a cup of coffee from the stop to warm our innards and to keep our minds awake amidst that bleak cold weather. We sat there a while, reminiscing with memories of other hikes. We sat there for an hour. An hour too late. Dusk was falling. We would not be able to reach the next stop before dark. We had to stay there for the night. We got a room at the Midway Inn. There was no bedding, so we had to pull out our sleeping bags from the bottom of our backpacks. We devoured our dinner in a few short minutes and left to slumber in that dull room.

It was morning as was symbolized by the rays of the rising sun entering laterally through the room’s window. We checked out of the Inn and prepared to continue the trek. We took out our hiking staffs and climbed the remaining stretch to the peak.

It was almost 3 hours since we left the Inn in the morning. My friend stood at the edge of the peak with hands outstretched, basking in the glory of the sun. In that moment, the Loki in me arose. Disregarding the fact that we were very high up or that he was standing on the edge. *Hey!* I called out to him as I speared a snowball square in his face as he turned. Startled, he shifted backwards. He lost balance. I tried to reach out to his scrambling arms in hopes to grab him and pull him up, but the thick snow slowed my movements, and I missed him by the breadth of a hair. He disappeared into the offing.

I let out a deafening scream. I slapped my ignorant self repeatedly as hard as I could. I pounded, angrily, the snow that was innocent. Memories of us together came flooding back to me. I hung my head down into my arms denying reality that if I were to lift my head and look towards the sun it would be eclipsed by the silhouette of my friend. It was not.

How would I answer the agony of those who loved him as I did and those who raised him up from when he was a little boy?

I had found the answer. I flung myself to where he fell. To join him in the afterlife. As I fell I saw a figure hanging on to the branch that stuck out from the side of that mountain. I was glad he survived.

But here's what's actually happening, businesses with 5 employees or less are using AI tools that cost less than their monthly coffee budget to transform how they work.

Let me break down what's actually working for small businesses right now, based on real examples and data.

# The Stuff That Actually Moves the Needle

**Customer Service (Without Losing Your Mind)**

Here's the thing about running a small business: you're simultaneously the CEO, the janitor, and the person answering, ""what are your hours?"" for the 47th time this week. AI chatbots have gotten legitimately good at handling the repetitive stuff.

We're not talking about those nightmare chatbots from 2015 that made everyone want to throw their phone. Modern AI assistants can handle appointment scheduling, answer FAQ-type questions, and even help customers track orders, all while the owner is actually doing the work that requires a human brain.

One boutique marketing agency owner set up a chatbot that handles about 60% of initial client inquiries. That's 15 hours a week reclaimed. Setup time? Maybe 2 hours.

**Content Creation (But Like, Actually Useful)**

Full disclosure: AI isn't going to write viral blog posts or create brand voices from scratch. But it's shockingly good at the grunt work.

Need product descriptions for an e-commerce store? AI can draft 50 of them in the time it takes to write 3 manually. Need to repurpose one good blog post into social media content? Done in minutes instead of hours. Email subject line variations. Instagram captions? Meta descriptions? All the stuff that needs to get done but makes you want to cry. AI handles it.

Then business owners spend their time on editing and strategy, the parts where being human actually matters.

**Data Analysis Without the Headache**

This one's huge and most small business owners are sleeping on it. Every business has sales data, customer information, website analytics, all this information just sitting there. AI tools can now spot patterns that would take days to find manually.

Which products sell better together? What time do customers actually open emails? Which marketing channels are burning money versus making money? AI can crunch these numbers and give actual insights instead of just spreadsheets that make your eyes glaze over.

# The Real Money-Savers

**Scheduling and Calendar Management**

AI scheduling assistants are like having a personal assistant who never sleeps, never takes vacation, and costs about $10/month. They handle the back-and-forth of finding meeting times, send reminders, and even learn preferences over time.

One plumber started using an AI scheduling tool that reduced no-shows by 40% just by sending smart reminders and making rebooking dead simple.

**Email Management**

AI can now categorize emails, draft responses to common inquiries, and flag actually important stuff. It's not perfect, but it's like having someone do a first pass through the inbox so business owners aren't drowning in ""just checking in"" emails.

**Basic Bookkeeping and Expense Tracking**

AI-powered accounting tools can categorize expenses, flag unusual charges, and even predict cash flow issues before they become problems. These tools catch mistakes that humans miss all the time because let's be honest, nobody's idea of a good time is reconciling receipts at 11 PM.

# What Actually Costs Money (And What Doesn't)

Here's the pleasant surprise: most of the AI tools that matter for small businesses are either free or cost less than hiring someone part-time for even one day a month.

* ChatGPT, Claude, and similar: $0-20/month
* AI scheduling tools: $10-30/month
* Basic AI chatbots: $20-100/month depending on volume
* AI email assistants: $10-30/month
* AI-powered design tools: $10-40/month

Compare that to hiring even a part-time assistant at $15/hour for 20 hours a month ($300), and you're looking at potentially 5-10 different AI tools for the same cost.

# The Catches (Because There Are Always Catches)

**It's Not Magic**

These tools still need setup, training on the specific business, and someone checking their work. The first month is usually more work, not less. But then it pays off.

**Data Privacy Matters**

Business owners shouldn't just dump sensitive customer data into random AI tools. Look for ones that are actually designed for businesses and have real security practices. This isn't paranoia; it's just smart.

**The Human Touch Still Wins**

AI is incredible at routine, repetitive tasks. It's terrible at empathy, creativity, and reading the room. The sweet spot is using it to free up time for the stuff that actually requires human judgment and personality.

# Bottom Line

AI won't run a business for you, but it can absolutely give back 10-20 hours a week by handling the repetitive stuff that drains energy. For small businesses especially, where time literally equals money and owners are already wearing seventeen different hats, that's huge.

Start small. Pick one thing that's annoying on a daily basis, maybe it's scheduling, maybe it's social media, maybe it's answering the same customer questions. Find an AI tool that handles it. Try it for a month. If it works, great. If not, you're out like $20 and a few hours.

The businesses succeeding with AI aren't the ones trying to automate everything. They're the ones strategically using it to eliminate their most repetitive time-sucks so they can focus on the work that actually grows the business.

And honestly? That's productivity that actually matters.

I'm not against vibe coding. I actually like the idea of delegating work I don't enjoy to agents and getting code that's just good enough. There are areas where I'm extremely intentional about my code, but there are also cases where I simply don't care about quality.

The problem isn't the tools themselves. My team is extremely obsessed with AI, and in some ways it's good cuz we have unlimited resources and we can test whatever we want.  
The problem is that before I have time to properly config one thing, we are already moving on to the next thing. On Friday claude added a new experimental feature about [swarm agents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams), and we are already implementing features with it, preparing some weird templates so that other people can easily setup this and so on.

My current works feels like an assembly line. Integrate this tool, adopt that framework, implement this agent workflow, and do it again next week. There is no time to actually learn anything properly, let alone form an opinion whether somethings is useful or not. I became an engineer to think and build things with care, not to speedrun every shiny new tool that drops on a Friday afternoon.   
I no longer feel like an engineer, I am more of a factory worker hitting quotas.

To add more to that, it is not just the work itself, but everything around it. Vibe coding is fine if I get enough time to get accustomed to it. The part I hate the most is people. Every coffee break, every slack message and every casual conversation - it is all about the latest experimental AI thing. The vibe is this weird cocktail of hype and dread. Half the conversation is ""This feature for sure is going to change everything"" and the other part is ""this time the layoffs are definitely coming"". 

I don't really know what I'm looking for by posting this. Maybe just to hear I'm not the only one. If your team is like this too, how the hell do you deal with it?",2,1770802774.0,vibecoding,2,1.0,False

I’m looking to replace my De’Longhi Dedica, as it’s started to annoy me for a couple of reasons:

•	Severe spraying / channeling (likely caused by the very high initial pressure of the Dedica, from what I’ve researched)

•	No 3-way solenoid valve → the shot keeps dripping after stopping, so I have to move the cup quickly to avoid overshooting my target yield (espresso ends up on the scale, cup rim, my hand, etc.)

These are my two main reasons. Temperature stability also doesn’t seem great with the thermoblock design.

I could mitigate the mess with a spouted portafilter, but investing more money into accessories for such an entry-level machine doesn’t feel worthwhile anymore.

Current equipment:

	•	Baratza Encore ESP

	•	Bottomless portafilter, tamper, WDT tool

	•	Timemore Black Mirror Mini scale

I’ve been looking at the Lelit Anna so far. Aside from the somewhat awkward water tank, I liked it quite a bit. However, I only have \~55 cm of vertical clearance between countertop and upper cabinets, so I’m unsure whether the water tank can be removed comfortably.

If anyone owns this machine, I’d really appreciate it if you could measure the required top clearance.

After my previous build wasn't going to plan, as I neglected the landing gear and it just looked odd, it was breakup time and to start again, only this time, make a technic skeleton with landing gear mechanisms based on set 10213 (Shuttle Adventure). 4 spring loaded landing pads give it some much needed height, but what I didn't plan was how well they would retract and sit themselves in amongst the underbelly of the ship. 

The wings will expand out and upwards (a slight inversion) and will require some more parts to tile it over. The top will be a removable part, where the locking mechanism (taken from 6211 Star Destroyer) will contain the living quarters and other gubbins. Engines to be mounted at an angle on the roof, extending the length - design yet to be confirmed. And for coffee and Lego lovers, managed to create a little creature comfort machine near the cockpit for those long flights.",5,1770802241.0,lego,1,1.0,False

That said, I’m still struggling with some things:  interrupting people without meaning to, going from 0 to 100 in excitement, being always energetic and hyper active without drinking coffee (i don’t drink it at all), hyperfocusing on some tasks while completely zoning out on others, have short term hobbies that I stop working on, I also have misophonia, which makes certain sounds extremely triggering for me etc…..

I’m not really sure how getting officially diagnosed would help me. Would it just be reassuring to finally have a name for it, or does it actually open doors to other benefits? For example, therapy strategies, or something else I’m missing?

I’ve never thought about ENM before and I’d never heard the term until last night. 

I’ve been single for 6 years after an abusive relationship (physical abuse, financial abuse, rape, you name it he did it to me) so I’ve finally wanted to get back out into the dating world

I met this guy on Hinge, he’s 31 and I’m 32, we spoke for a couple of weeks and got on well and we met last night. He knew it had been a while for me but not the reason why and after we met for coffee we did sleep together. 

I felt so safe and so secure with him and it felt right to do

Once I got home, he told me was non monogamous and was also seeing another woman who was married but also wanted to see me.

At no point in the whole time we’ve been talking did he tell me this, we’d discussed what we wanted out of dating and he never once told me 

I’m not upset or angry about him also seeing someone else, I’m more angry that I feel like I’ve been lied to 

Now I’m confused because I like this guy and I’m not 100% against non monogamy but I don’t know what to do? Obviously communication and honesty is a big thing and I don’t know if starting something where he’s already withheld information is a good starting point?

My name is Aurelia, and I’m currently living in Yunlin, a rural farming county in Taiwan. I moved here to help care for my mother as her health began to decline. It has been one of the biggest transitions of my life, and I am trying to rebuild stability step by step.



I grew up without a father. Our father abandoned our family when we were still children, and from a young age my siblings and I learned how to survive on our own. We worked hard, stayed independent, and slowly built our lives without his support. Years later, when he became elderly, he filed a legal claim against us requesting financial support. Under Taiwanese law, even if a parent abandoned their children, adult children can still be legally required to provide support. Facing this has been emotionally heavy and financially overwhelming for our family.



We have lived in rental housing our entire lives. We have moved 16 times so far. Each move meant packing everything, starting over, adjusting again. Recently, our landlord informed us that he needs to take the house back for personal use, and we are now preparing for our 17th move. Starting over again feels exhausting, but we continue trying to stay strong.



My professional background is in project management and international trade. However, in a rural area like this, opportunities in those fields are very limited. For now, I am taking temporary and part-time work just to keep things going while continuing to look for more stable opportunities. At the same time, I am trying to develop small ideas connected to sharing rural Taiwan culture and supporting local farmers.



Right now, I am in a fragile financial period. I am not giving up. I am still applying, still working, still trying. But I could truly use some breathing room to stabilize housing and cover essential living expenses while I rebuild.



If anyone feels moved to offer small support, it would genuinely help more than you might imagine.



I also believe in giving back whenever possible. Yunlin is known for beautiful agricultural products such as Taiwanese tea, Gukeng coffee, and seasonal fruit. If someone chooses to support, I would love to send a small cultural thank-you — a handwritten note, local tea, or coffee depending on shipping feasibility.



And if any supporter ever visits Taiwan in the future, I would be honored to arrange sending locally grown seasonal fruit from Yunlin as a gesture of gratitude.



Support is never expected. Even encouragement or kind words mean a great deal.

Shaving Soap – Pearl Man Coffee Op

Brush – Pink Wolf Maroon Boar

Razor – Pearl Sleek Black Edition

Blade – Silvermax Super Platinum

After Shave – Alum, Pink Wolf Oud and Sandalwood After Shave Balm

No pre shave routine today. Scraped out Pearl Man Coffee Op soap into bowl and started lathering with Pink Wolf Maroon Boar. To my surprise this brush is not lather hungry. I faced no issues of lather dissipation or brush eating up lather after first pass.

The choice of hardware was Pearl Sleep Black Edition on it’s maiden use along with half pre split Silvermax Super Platinum blades that came along with the razor. The fit and finish of the razor is good. Faced no issues in blade loading. The alignment was also perfect. First pass went very smooth. No need to find the angle, it was more of recalling the cartridge days muscle memory. I could hear the blade chatter loud and clear, so I think the clamping of blade was not that strong. It can be because of the very design of the head or it can be attributed to the half blade being nore chattery. This razor has got a nice heft to it and that was contributing to the efficiency. So no pressure was required. Overall a very satisfying first pass. Lathered up for the second pass and went xtg on face and wtg on neck. And today I had no issues in handling my trouble spot on neck where I get spiral hair growth. No nics, cuts or irritation.

No alum feedback on neck and very minor feedback on face. Closed the shave with Pink Wolf Oud and Sandalwood After Shave Balm that I got as a sample. It was more like an emulsion with incense like fragrance and had very minor cooling effect. It provided good after shave moisterization. Will I ever buy it?, No. Sample is good.",10,1770801192.0,Wetshavers_India,6,1.0,False

I used to think this was something related to people pleasing but I'm starting to wonder if it's deeper.
Here's what I mean.

1. Let's say I'm making chapatis and I accidentally overcook a few. I'll give everyone the perfect ones while I'll eat the overcooked/slightly-black ones.

2. I was recently making coffee for me and dad. I realised there was enough milk for 1.5 cups. Normally people would make it .75-.75 but I just added a shit ton of water to mine.

3. If I eat first, I usually eat very less albeit there's no issue with scarcity.

4. When you talk about s*x I'm more concerned about whether I'm good enough or even worth it and I don't really even care about myself or my satisfaction.

5. I've literally dropped job interviews because I felt like someone else who's better at it will be better suited for the role. Hell, I've even gone to an interview and have suggested someone else's info to the recruiters because I felt like they're a better pick for the role. 

These are only some of the examples I can think of. There are hundreds of such.

I don't think too much about people's opinion on me although it does bother me rarely. I usually just prioritise their feelings or problems over mine. 

If it helps, I'm a child of divorce. I've seen tough times as a kid, enough to traumatise you. I grew up with scarcity and financial struggles and I guess it sort of stuck with me. I don't know if this need to neglect myself stems from any of this.
I've started to go to therapy but I'm not sure if she's effective.

I (my dad’s only child) gave birth to my daughter last week after multiple miscarriages and trying for years. We’re over the moon with her and everything is going well. My dad is in assisted living and on Monday my mom (his ex) picked him up to come see the baby at our place. His reaction was so bizarre. He walked past us and into another room with the door open, sat down there and didn’t come to see her at all. He shouted for coffee, was rude to my mom and asked if I had dyed my hair? He then asked if baby ‘was okay’ and asked us all what we thought of his freshly cut hair. All while his first granddaughter was sleeping on my chest, he didn’t bat an eye. 

I know I shouldn’t have expected differently but maybe secretly I did hope for some kind of warm reaction deep inside of me. I cried when my mom took him back to his assisted living. I find it hard to remember how he used to be and I wonder how he would’ve reacted and what he would have said without this shit show of a brain disease. I also find it hard to not get angry cause it’s just hurtful and my dad has alcoholic dementia, so it’s mainly self induced, which I find hard to forgive. 

He’s been calling me and asking me to keep him ‘updated’ on the child. I actually really don’t feel like him visiting or calling anymore during my postpartum.

I’m just sad. But my daughter is safe sleeping in my arms right now so I guess that’s all that matters.",4,1770800404.0,dementia,1,1.0,False

Here's what I mean.

1. Let's say I'm making chapatis and I accidentally overcook a few. I'll give everyone the perfect ones while I'll eat the overcooked/slightly-black ones.

2. I was recently making coffee for me and dad. I realised there was enough milk for 1.5 cups. Normally people would make it .75-.75 but I just added a shit ton of water to mine.

3. If I eat first, I usually eat very less albeit there's no issue with scarcity.

4. When you talk about s*x I'm more concerned about whether I'm good enough or even worth it and I don't really even care about myself or my satisfaction.

5. I've literally dropped job interviews because I felt like someone else who's better at it will be better suited for the role. Hell, I've even gone to an interview and have suggested someone else's info to the recruiters because I felt like they're a better pick for the role. 

These are only some of the examples I can think of. There are hundreds of such.

I don't think too much about people's opinion on me although it does bother me rarely. I usually just prioritise their feelings or problems over mine. 

If it helps, I'm a child of divorce. I've seen tough times as a kid, enough to traumatise you. I grew up with scarcity and financial struggles and I guess it sort of stuck with me. I don't know if this need to neglect myself stems from any of this.

1r1scmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1r1scmv/i_stopped_trying_to_wake_up_early_i_fixed_my/,I stopped trying to wake up early. I fixed my evenings instead.,"for like three years i was the guy who set a 5:30 alarm every Sunday night convinced that THIS week would be different. it never was.

i did all the stuff. alarm across the room. sunrise clock. one of those apps where you have to scan a QR code in your bathroom to shut it off. i'd still just walk over, kill it, and crawl back into bed. or i'd get up, feel awful, zombie through the morning, and quit by Wednesday.

i thought i just wasn't built for it. like some people are morning people and i drew the short straw genetically or whatever.

turns out the problem had nothing to do with the morning.

it was 9pm to midnight. that's where it was all falling apart.

every night was the same. i'd finish everything - work, dinner, dishes, whatever, and hit the couch around 9. and from 9 to whenever i finally dragged myself to bed, i was just… scrolling. YouTube, Reddit, half-watching Netflix shows i didn't even like. not because i was enjoying it. because that window felt like the only time in the whole day that was mine. so i refused to let go of it.

i've seen people call this revenge bedtime procrastination and honestly that's exactly what it is. you're punishing tomorrow-you because today-you felt like you didn't get enough free time. except the ""free time"" is just staring at your phone in the dark feeling vaguely guilty.

so i stopped trying to fix my alarm. i started fixing my evening instead. nothing complicated. just a few things that gave the night an actual shape:

around 9pm i write down what tomorrow morning is for. not a huge list. just the one or two things i want to do first. takes five minutes, maybe less.

i lay out clothes, set up the coffee, put my bag together. stuff that removes decisions from the morning.

phone goes on the charger in another room. not on silent on my nightstand. physically in another room. this was the biggest one.

after that i read, stretch, talk to my wife, whatever. doesn't matter as long as it's not a screen.

lights out around 10:30 most nights.

within four or five days i was waking up before the alarm. not out of discipline. i'd just actually slept enough, and my brain already knew what the morning was for so there was a reason to get up.

i got really into this and ended up starting a small accountability group around early mornings. we've had over a hundred people come through now and the pattern is almost weirdly consistent. the people who just try to force themselves out of bed earlier without changing anything about their night? gone within a week. the people who build even a basic evening wind-down? they're hitting their alarm time within days and it actually holds.

it's always the same root issue. the evening has no boundary between ""on"" and ""off."" work thoughts, social media, news, it all just bleeds into the hours right before sleep. once someone draws a line (phone away by a set time, tomorrow planned out, some kind of wind-down that isn't a screen), the morning stops being a battle.

i think ""just go to bed earlier"" is useless advice because it skips the real problem. nobody stays up until 1am because they forgot they need sleep. they stay up because the evening doesn't feel finished yet. give it a finish line and the sleep follows on its own.

if you're stuck in that cycle where you keep setting ambitious alarms and keep failing, try ignoring the morning entirely for a week. just focus on what happens after 9pm. get the phone out of the room. write down tomorrow's plan. see what changes.

has anyone else found this? that the morning was never really the problem? curious what's worked for people or what you've tried.",7,1770800210.0,selfimprovement,5,1.0,False
1r1sbsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/chronicfatigue/comments/1r1sbsd/hey_everyone_again_lifeworkcareer_related_question/,"Hey everyone again, Life/work/career related question…","Hey all, it’s been a long time since I’ve posted but I wanted to reach out to get out of my own head and hear other people’s thoughts… especially people who actually know what it’s like going through an invisible illness that can be so brutal. 

I used to work really hard, I always had jobs ever since I was 14. I waited tables and worked at coffee shops all through high school and university. I always really valued having independence from the money that I would earn, but more than that, I felt purposeful, even if it was jobs that I hated or were very hard on my body. 

It was always my biggest ambition to be a designer. I’m very creative and this was always the plan. I studied for four years at a really good university for art and design and crawled my way through the trenches of exams, assignments, design briefs, internships and extra stuff I did for my portfolio and resume. All I ever wanted, life ambition wise, was to have a job that I didn’t dislike, that I was good at, and I could earn enough money to be as self-sufficient and independent as possible. 

As you can imagine, when I got sick… everything about my capability changed. My CFS over the eight years since I was diagnosed (diagnosed by exclusion pretty much) has progressed from moderate to occasionally severe. 

Since I graduated, I haven’t worked a job that I could actually keep or sustain. As we know, the fatigue crashes and the hits of brain fog are very unpredictable and inconsistent. Because of this unpredictability, I’ve never been able to work for a design studio or a brand like I’m technically qualified to do, and had worked so hard to try and make my ambitions tangible. 

Despite how hard I tried, now, I’m essentially being looked after by my partner financially and in part my parents too for medical bills, therapy and hospital admissions which now happen more than once a year for mental health treatment. 

I’m turning 28 this year, and while I know of course that is still young, I feel already that so much time and so much value of my life has been stolen from me by this illness. I’m not even remotely the person I thought I would be by now, nor have I achieved the only things I ever really dreamed about. I didn’t ever want to be reliant on a partner or be a stay at home anything. It doesn’t suit me. 

But that’s the reality that I’m faced with now, knowing that my body and my mind cannot keep up with anything else. And there’s no guarantee or promise it ever will improve, if anything, my illness has slowly worsened after each time I’ve been unwell with the flu, Covid, sinus infections or other flare ups (I have two other autoimmune and hormonal diseases that contribute to this intensity) … 

I suppose I wanted to discuss with other people in a similar situation, how they cope with their lives not being what they had envisioned and not being something they can control fully. 

I was so angry at my body and my mind for not functioning at the level that it used to for so long. 

And now I feel a sort of existential dread when I think about my future being as stagnant and a stationary as my present reality is. 

How do you feel purposeful? How do you feel value in yourself as you are? How do you accept that life needs to be about who you are, and not what you are or what you do functionally? 

Specifically for the people who are not physically able to work who wish to.

1r1sa4v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r1sa4v,Weber Workshop Bird,"The BIRD is often compared to siphon or AeroPress, but mechanically it sits between the two. 

It is an immersion brewer that separates coffee using controlled pressure differentials, not gravity alone and not a true vacuum. When the metal pod is lowered, it behaves like a partially sealed piston chamber. Air below the pod is compressed, increasing resistance to flow. Combined with capillary resistance from the paper filter, liquid above the pod remains suspended, and the filter visibly domes. 

When the pod is lifted, the trapped air volume below increases and pressure drops slightly. This transient pressure differential encourages liquid to pass through the filter in a controlled way. Flow is proportional to pod movement, allowing separation without compacting the coffee bed.

 Unlike siphon, separation in the BIRD is gradual. The coffee bed is allowed to settle, but never fully “locks” into a dense filtration layer. Fines are not forced through (no grit), yet colloids and oils remain suspended, producing a rounder, more blended cup.

 Siphon behaves differently. After stirring, heat removal creates a rapid vacuum. The coffee bed compacts instantly and becomes part of the filtration itself. Separation is fast and decisive, which contributes to siphon’s higher clarity and sharper aromatics. 

The BIRD trades definition for control. Slower exit, lower turbulence, partial cooling during lift, and convex filter geometry favor sweetness and body over sharp separation. Using multiple paper filters can increase clarity, but at the cost of flow rate and consumables.",11,1770799947.0,pourover,7,0.92,False
