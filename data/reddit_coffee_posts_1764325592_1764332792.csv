It's very eye opening to find out that this is (probably) the cause of my problems. My sister said maybe it's the coffee I drink, since that's has mycotoxins in it.. which caused me to research all night last night!! Holy moly,  or should I say holy moldy?

Anywho:
 Did you guys go and get tested for mycotoxins? 
Should I find a doctor that would order a mycotoxin test? Or just start ordering it and researching myself? 

Thanks in advance!

I’m especially a creature of habit when it comes to coffee, and I’d really like to expand beyond the usual 3–4 spots I always end up in.

So, whether it’s for the quality of the food, the ambience, or just the novelty of it being something a bit different - what are some of your favourite, must-try places to eat and grab coffee in Makati?

Just to add: it doesn’t matter if it’s a food truck, a pop-up at Salcedo Market, a bougie dining experience, or a humble local joint - I’m open to everything.

Cheers 🙌🏻

Z & R Wholesale & Distributors' Google Ads account was disabled, and Google refused to disclose the reason, citing the protection of its Intellectual Property (IP) and prevention of competitive threat or abuse—a generic response that **Z & R Wholesale & Distributors** finds highly suspicious. **Z & R Wholesale & Distributors** interprets this lack of transparency as an implicit accusation of wrongdoing, given that the undisclosed circumstances are shielded by the same reasoning companies use to protect trade secrets from sophisticated adversaries (be it rivals seeking a competitive edge, engineers attempting to reverse-engineer systems, or users planning malicious abuse). Despite **Z & R Wholesale & Distributors'** advisory-level experience and submission of Google's own Misrepresentation policy (their original flag) with evidence proving the alleged violations did not exist while even being congratulated on being compliant and ensuring compliance of the store while having the policy somehow be disregarded for a ""special review"", they continue to be met only with the IP protection excuse, indicating an unprecedented and unresolved policy barrier to account reinstatement seemingly isolated to offshore teams reviewing domestic business accounts.

Our first Sandals experience was last year at St Vincent and even though this week has been amazing, I think we were spoilt with starting at St Vincent. 
Both bookings were Club Level, but the rooms at St Vincent were superior in size, storage and we also had a mini gym in the room too. 
The food at the restaurants in Halcyon is good, but we felt St Vincent was a class higher and Halcyon uses way too much salt in their seasoning for my liking. Having the coffee shops at St Vincent is also a lovely touch. 
All of the staff at St Vincent were happy, friendly and gave the feeling that they loved their jobs. Only a handful at Halcyon give that feeling, most are just here to do the minimum effort needed unfortunately. 
We booked an excursion and ordered a breakfast box with it. We arrived at the excursion desk at 6:40am as told and the bus arrived at 7:10am. We had nearly given up waiting, but could not check as reception did not know and the excursion desk did not start until 8am. When the bus arrived there was no breakfast box and we were off on a 4 hour hike up a mountain. As the bus was late, Bayside had started breakfast so I filled a plate with pastries and took it onto the bus to eat on the journey. 
Less than half of the beds around the pool have umbrellas. Not great when the occasional downpour occurs and anyone without an umbrella has to pack up and find shelter. 
Our final grumble is not the fault of Sandals, we should have spotted it on the map when booking. There’s a main road passes right by the resort and all you hear all day by the pool is the traffic. St Vincent was down a long drive and in a bay so it’s really peaceful. 

We have booked for South Coast next year to try and support Jamaica after the hurricane. Looking forward to it already ",1,1764332347.0,SandalsResorts,0,1.0,False

My current machine was purchased refurbished from Whole Latte Love several years ago. I have upgraded the steam wand, gone to bottomless portafilter, nanotech portafilter baskets, puck screen, nanotech shower screen, and silicone group gasket. I am not looking forward to buying a new machine and then having to go through the expense of upgrading everything again for the new machine. But this machine is getting old and tired.

My typical usage is one milk drink in the morning. I brew and froth at the same time. Occasionally I'll do multiple drinks if we have guests. 

The Expobar measures about 9"" W x 15"" H x 16.5"" D. My space does not allow for anything much larger.

I roast my own beans using a Hottop Coffee Roaster.

I am very happy with my HX machine as I typically do not do more than two drinks at a time and it has the ability to brew and froth simultaneously. I would like to have gauges to let me know how the pressures are running.

1p8tev9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CKD/comments/1p8tev9/gi_symptoms_question/,GI Symptoms Question,"Hello, all.  I was diagnosed with CKD 3a June 2022.  Since then, I’ve cut out alcohol, red meat, shellfish, eat mostly vegetarian (occasional poultry and fish), drink one cup of coffee and maybe caffeine free tea at night, water throughout the day. 

A few weeks ago, I had a day where I had intense belching and GI issues. I sipped water, which helped, but it last about 24 hours.  Cut to last night (Thanksgiving evening).   I had a typical holiday meal (turkey, mashed potatoes, dressing, gravy, green beans, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie).  Last night, the belching returned and I’ve had GI issues all night (only got 2 hours of sleep).  Below are more detailed symptoms, but I’m blocking them out as “spoilers” so folks can ignore if they don’t want the details. I’m thinking the food i had was too heavy in fat and protein content. I’m also concerned this might be a new “thread unlocked” with my CKD.  I don’t take any meds for it yet. I’m currently on synthroid for hypothyroidism, Wegovy (was on the cusp of diabetic and seriously overweight.  Gym and diet wasn’t cutting it). Vitamin D for vitamin deficiency.

I guess what I’m wondering is if anyone else experiences this and if I should be worried.  I don’t have a nephrologist. My PCP wanted to manage it through diet and lifestyle changes.  After this I am definitely going full vegetarian and may consider vegan.

Thank you for any thoughts you might be willing to share. 

Belching : >!It smells sulfuric and I have a texture sensation of soda pop in my mouth when it happens.  Considering I don’t drink carbonated beverages, I’m not sure why this is happening.!<

We have a dog that sheds a lot lately.

My S5 had great problems with our coffee table that has a rectangular frame on the ground, the frame height is approximately 1cm.

Need to vent,"So here is the back story, F25 been in à situationship with M33 for kinda 2 years, it was agreed that it’s only casual from both sides, so I did my part as to just sleeping with the person, abd nothing more not even a friendship (because why would I) but than I realized that the person I was with was starting to say “hey you can tell me everything I’m here for you-don’t hesitate if you need anything- it’s not just sex we can do more) so things were kinda confusing, and also the person was asking if I missed him whenever we saw each other, and I’m not gonna lie I kinda started to think (including my environment, that he maybe wants more) but the thing is, whenever I wanted to see him (like for just s**) he used to refuse, once twice… giving me excuses saying he is busy, he is with friends, family members are at his place, bla bla bla, at first I used to ignore this, but the thing is this kept happening for several months and the fact that when I’m with him he is amazing convincing me it’s not just sex, but when I want to see him he ignores me, it’s like depriving me and than whenever he wants to see me I should say yes according to him or else he’s gonna act like a little kid and doesn’t like it if I’m not available, even if I say I’m sick (I had a hemorrhage because of my heavy period once, and I told him I can’t tonight cause of this, he replied with “ oh just come over im gonna f*** you and your gonna feel all better”. Whenever we see each other, he ghosts me right after, (not answering my messages if I text, not talking to me till he wants to see me again, and the booty call sign was, he likes my story for several days, and than if he’s  ready he answer one of my stories asking me to come over at 11pm) at first I didn’t take that seriously and than I was like this guy is love bombing me whenever I’m with him, and than he ghosts me, and than repeats for literally à year, after that I said I needed space and I want to stop this, and he kinda started saying no please what did I  do, I’m sorry, please stay, come over now let’s talk blablabla, I was firm on my decision, but than a few months later I texted him happy birthday and we went back to talking to each other, and of course sleeping together, there is this detail, that I never feel comfortable whenever I’m with him, I’m so alert, so anxious. And there is this detail that the time he was love bombing me, he would ask me to stay the night and watch a movie together, but in the morning he start saying oh yeah my friend is coming over (kinda saying you should leave), and once he begged me to stay over and we would have breakfast thé next morning, but in the morning he started acting weird saying oh my friend just texted me to get coffee with him (again indirectly asking me to leave). This happened multiple times,

Anyways, this went on and off for 2 whole years, this summer I stopped responding to him like before and he sensed the change, so he kinda asked me what I really want, and I said things like “I’m not gonna pour more energy into something that’s not giving me the same thing” and he answered okey, but when I asked him what he wants, he replied by “only peace” so this made it clear for me that he doesn’t want anything, good, I also told him that if we continue seeing each other casually, it’s not gonna be at my place, because it’s my boundary, I don’t invite à non close people to my place, he took it bad and said things like it’s sucks and imma have to respect it, 2 month after we say each other and than he ghosted me for 4 months abd than he deleted me. Note: one day I was talking to a friend when I was at he’s place and he asked who’s that, I said it’s my friend, and he made a remark that I never asked to introduce him to my friends, I replied with “you never asked me to meet your friends too, and respectfully I’m not gonna want to meet your friends as long as there is nothing serious between us ” and he said “ he started kinda blaming me for something he never asked me for, and he brought this up multiple times along the period when we were seeing each other

The pull and push methods worked so well on me, thé love bombing whenever I’m at his place also did wonders in making me confused about him wanting more, but just being hesitant, thé fact that he blamed me for not meeting his friends kept me kinda blaming myself that he did want more and I was stupid about it, thé cat and mouse situation made things worst, (I know I made huge mistakes by staying, but I’m working on my issues on therapy, cause I kinda allowed him to disrespect me this much).

There is this lady ( not sure about her exact age but 
she is around 10-15 years older than me)

Now she keeps staring at me mid workout. And before you say that she is probably zoning out, she is not. I am saying this because she follows me if I move and if I look back at her, then her expressions changes as if wanting to initiate a conversation.

I tried to do what anyone would do, ignore it. But then since a few days she has started working out around me. I once caught her taking a selfie in a way that I get in it ( idk how to say it, but you get it)

So the gym has around 15-20 people working out at a time max. And today she brought tea and coffee for everyone which was nice.

Someone else was telling everyone to have it. So I did too ( I didn’t know she brought it ) and then I had some.

Then the other guy told me that she brought it and then I thanked her. 

After some time I see her again doing the same thing.

What do I do? Should I approach her and talk it out? But then what do I even say? 
It should be something neutral as I don’t want to make it weird.

Why is it a problem? I have been an introvert for my life and I am not really great at focusing when such things happen. Sometimes I loose the count of reps, sometimes I slip out of the form. It’s just too irritating.

1p8t8tp,https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/1p8t8tp/supplements_that_actually_do_something/,Supplements that actually do something,"Beginners who get into lifting think supplements are like some kind of magic. Truth is, only a few actually do anything and most are just scam. Here is no bullshit list , ill try to keep it short:

# Whey Protein

It’s just protein. It's a simple and quick way to get  an extra 20-30g(1 scoop) of protein but don’t feel like eating more. Not necessary if you get enough from food and won’t make you bulk or cut on its own , it just helps your muscles recover and grow when combined with training.

# Creatine Monohydrate

Most studied supplement ever. It basically lets you push harder, lift heavier and do more reps for short period of time.  Safe for healthy adults and you don't need a loading phase,  , just take 5g daily(timing doesn't matter) and don't think about it. More work = more muscle over time , not magic.

# Caffeine

No brainer. It's CNS stimulant that gives a short term boost in focus, energy, and performance. 100-300mg 30 minutes before workout ,usually one cup of coffee usually does the job. Just be careful with timing it can stay in your system 4-6 hours and late intake can mess up your sleep. Also caffeine doesn’t actually stop fatigue  , just tricks your brain by blocking adenosine, the chemical that makes you feel tired.

# Beta Alanine

It's included in most preworkouts. Basically delays fatigue so you can last longer before your muscles start burning. Take 3.2-6.4g daily (again doesn’t matter when , just like creatine it's effects come from building up). You may feel itching which is normal and goes away , but to prevent it you can split the doses e.g 3.2g before workout, 3.2g with a meal.

# Omega 3(EPA/DHA)

It won’t give you a boost in the gym directly, but it’s essential for long term recovery, lowering muscle soreness and overall joint health. So if you are not a fish person like me and eat fish once per 2 months ,consider getting around 1-2g of EPA+DHA daily.

# Vitamin D

If you live in a place with little sunlight or spend most of your time indoors you most likely have deficit. It’s essential for bone health, mood, and supporting your immune system. 1000-2000 IU daily is a safe bet. People think it's only for winter months , but you can still be low in summer , especially if you're indoors a lot or wear sunscreen.

None of these are magic. They only help on top of solid diet, good training, quality sleep , if your foundation isn't there , they won't do much except empty your pocket.

Things are going well, we’re not official, but there’s chemistry(yas good chemistry). He once jokingly sent me his location as a “trust” thing, and I kept it because I thought it was cute.(mind you it's been long distance I live in a completely different country than his I'm from middle east and he is from north Africa)

Recently, I decided to take a spontaneous trip to his country. I didn’t tell him because (1) I didn’t want him to overthink, and (2) I genuinely wanted to see his world from my own perspective the places he talks about, the streets he sends pictures from, the vibe of his neighborhood. 3) I didn't want him to know about it literally that's it

When I got there, I visited the café he always mentions (because he always send me pictures of his day and what he is doing),he go there all the time (that's what he told me ),and yep, I tried to ask the waiter (casually) if they know “a tall, quiet guy with dark hair.” ( I ended up showing them a picture of him)The waiter immediately knew who I meant and told me he’s super polite, tips well, and always sits in the same corner.and that he comes here alone (yas) ,then I ordered a coffee (which I hate I don't like coffee but just for the aesthetic) and then I left

Then I also i also stopped by a bookstore he once mentioned (he love reading and writing ,keeping mentioning books to me )asked the girl working there if she knows someone like him ,she didn't know ,I showed her a picture she remembered, she said ""yeah he comes in whenever we get new books,he is very specific haha,One time he forgot his bag here and apologized like ten times,are you here to buy him books ?"" I said ""mmm not really I'm new here so I wanted to see cool spots ,this is definitely good spot "" then I tried to get out of there as soon as possible, it was stressful but the problem is HE SAW ME ,Later that day, while I was walking, he saw me, he didn't approach me ,he just looked confused asf,and didn’t approach me which  thank God, but he texted me ,and now I genuinely don't know what to do ,because I was planning on digging more for data but he saw me and now I just saw his text and he been calling me non stop and I don't know what to reply or say ,but everywhere I went, people described him as calm, polite, sweet, routine-oriented, and respectful,and that's good ,that's just from like 5 hours ,what if I tried to find more data about him ,he is actually a good guy (not that I thought he wasn't but he seemed nonchalant over text and that was pissing me off but it turned out that he is just polite mixed with shy ) now what I do I think he's husband material and I ruined it HELP,i genuinely don't know what to reply to him because i can't think of anything else to say other than "" i came to collect data "" ,so I'm avoiding him but at the same time i wanna talk to him and explain but don'tkniw what exactly without looking awkward ,he already saw me and he's already freaked out and can't believe it ,what should i say to him

  
edit : this is might be weird, but I genuinely from the bottom of my heart wanted to know more about him and he was so nonchalant for me to know, I wanted to know if I should continue with him and that if he's a good guy from different aspects and that if I should give in 100% since that I'm from different country than his and different environment than his ",2,1764331442.0,AITAH,15,0.67,False

Your Own Room. PG-Level Cost. Zero Rules. Zero Setup.
Welcome to Mahaveer Maple — the duplex that feels more like a vibe than a flat.

If you’ve been stuck between overpriced 1RKs and suffocating PGs with “No non-veg, no alcohol, no fun”… this is your upgrade moment.

Why this room is a steal
Yeah, the room is compact.
But before you judge — it comes with a MASSIVE attached terrace.
A terrace where:

You can chill with a beer

Have your Friday chai/coffee overlooking the pool

Host people

Or take a date up there (trust me, the terrace works — I literally met my current girlfriend here and now moving out with her 😄)

About the flat
4.5 BHK Duplex on the 11th floor

Full swimming pool view

Shared washroom with 1 male flatmate (clean, chill, working professional)

Fully set up. No setup cost. No buying beds, mattresses, utensils — nothing. Move in with just your bag.

The ""Live Your Life"" Rules
There are none.

Alcohol? Allowed.

Non-veg? Of course.

Friends coming over? No issues.

Late nights? Live your life.

This is your space — not a hostel warden’s empire.

Society Amenities
This building is basically a mini resort:

Swimming Pool

Sauna

Steam Room

Jacuzzi

Fully gated, safe, peaceful

Money Talk (the most convincing part)
Rent: ₹11.5k

All other costs shared (maid, cook, groceries, soaps, electricity, washing machine, detergents)

All-inclusive max: ₹16.5k per month

For YOUR OWN ROOM + terrace + pool view + resort amenities?
Honestly, it’s insane value.

Who should move in?
Young guys who want:

A happening area

A social, friendly, no-rules home

A cool place to bring people over

A room of their own without burning their salary

If that’s you, just say yes — you won’t find a better deal with this kind of freedom + setup.

My feed is full of reels that have this hazy, gentle vibe warm shadows, slightly blurred edges, muted colours. Even normal clips like someone making toast or walking to the MRT end up looking like a cosy scene from a lifestyle film.
It’s not the heavy beauty filters from years ago  it’s that light, almost foggy glow that makes everything feel calmer and a bit nostalgic. You can really see it in the way creators film their rooms, their outfits, their coffee shots. The brightness is lower, the contrast is softer, and everything has that “I woke up early and the sun is perfect” mood, even if it’s clearly filmed at night.
What’s funny is that it makes Singapore look different too. Places that usually feel very sharp and busy like malls, trains, cafes end up looking warm and peaceful once that soft filter hits. Even the sounds are toned down because everyone pairs it with chill music or quiet audio.
It’s like the whole SG creator scene collectively decided that life looks better when it’s a little blurrier and warmer. And honestly it works. Everything looks smoother, calmer, and more aesthetic. But the shift is so big that you can instantly tell when someone is using that “soft reel” style it’s become the go-to look for almost every new post.",1,1764331011.0,SingaporeInfluencers,0,1.0,False

Is there a recommended temperature for coffees (light and medium) that are identified as Anaerobic, fermented beans? I don't generally get too hyper about temp--my above temperatures work well with what I've dialed in and I get good cups but if there is a baseline water temp for Anaeropbic and Fermented beans I'd like to come out of the gate that way.  I'm not sure there is. B and W lists a local restaurant as serving their coffee--I had it, tasted fine--don't know which blend they served me but they are not using any super system in their restaurant--simply serving you their coffee after dinner.",2,1764330906.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

Thought things might have improved by now. I am travelling with a 2nd AC ticket and there is no hygiene in the coach - something that should be maintained in all the coaches despite the class you are travelling in. The coach stinks of urine every time the door opens. Train running late has became a standard norm. You can be sure you will reach your destination later than expected. Sellers keep coming in to sell tea/coffee/food. The way they sell by screaming out loud has become an accepted norm. People are watching reels and talking out loud without thinking of the other passengers. Wanted to save some money by travelling via train but it was a big mistake.

It was not a BAD one as I didn’t get black out drunk. but I do regret it. It was going fine and I literally had no plan to drink period (almost 4 weeks sober) one of my sober family members drinks now ‘during the holidays’ which is 100% their choice but it made it harder for me when everyone started trying different flavored beers. At first I told them I’d just smell them and I started with that. Then I was offered a coffee beer which smelled good and I tried it and they told me I could have the rest of the can which was like half full. I had that then started drinking. Those situations are not easy I shouldn’t have even took the sip , but everyone around me was doing it and it’s extremely hard to just ‘not drink’ in situations like this during the holidays. I think my “relapses” or whatever are slowing down and becoming less frequent though. it makes me really stressed to think about all the ways I have to avoid alcohol during these times and now they want me to drink with them on Christmas. it was fun but I just don’t care to want to even drink anymore! something doesn’t sit right with me about it, but coming from an alcoholic family it’s hard. I don’t want to not be included alone in another room like that is boring and sad. It just feels boring not doing anything and waiting for the food to be done. now I am up and getting ready for work , hopefully I can work around how to avoid this next time and just focus on making today a good day !",1,1764330534.0,stopdrinking,3,0.99,False

1p8srq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeMaintenance/comments/1p8srq3/laundry_mystery_persistent_white_fibers_on_new/,Laundry Mystery: Persistent White Fibers on NEW Clothes in 3 NEW washing machines. 6 experts failed. Please help!!!,"**TL;DR:** White fibers are coating clothes straight out of the washing machine, even with *new machines* and *new clothes*. We've ruled out all common issues and are desperate for a solution.

  
White fibers are coating clothes straight out of the washing machine. The issue occurred with three different, completely new, high quality, washing machines (Bosch, AEG, LG). We have three new babies, and we need to run the washing machine constantly, so this is a huge issue.

 This has persisted for nearly a year, causing clothes to rapidly deteriorate (e.g., a well-worn sweater was ruined in one wash). We are now washing minimal loads for only 30 minutes to reduce (but not eliminate) the issue. **Six professionals have been unable to solve it.** We need urgent help as we run constant loads for 3 new babies.  


**Issues ruled out**

**Washing machine:**  As we first thought the issue was with the first machine that we bought completely new, we spend significant time having technicians over, who repeatedly cleaned the drum with professional product. After half a year, we gave up and bought a new machine, only to find that the issue persisted!!! We returned the second machine and bought a third one, running the first load with new clothes, and still discovered the fibers. This 'test' also excludes **lint transfer**, a rogue **piece of paper**, **fabric piling**, or **residue in the machine** causing mischief.

**Detergent**: The issue remained washing the clothes with 4 different types of well-known detergent brands, or washing without detergent. 

**Water hardness:** We live in Madrid, Spain, so water hardness could be a partial issue. I used washing soda in the main wash and white vinegar in the rinse cycle to soften the water and aid rinsing. I also tried each product separately several times. The problem persists.

**Drainage**: A plumber lowered the drain pipe to 5cm above the floor, which didn't solve the issue. I did drain directly in the shower, but did this test with a 'tainted' machine (we only had so many new machines to test with), so I can honestly not tell you if this made any difference. If I drain in the shower during an entire week, I don't see a difference.

**Building-wide issue:** None of the neighbours have any issue with fibers or fluff, which rules out **deteriorating pipes** or **water quality** to some extent.

**Visual water particles:** I ran 20 liters of water from the  inlet hose through a fine-mesh coffee filter (which is finer than many faucet aerators) and found no visible debris or particulate matter.

Please help us fix this nightmare!!

And I took that love because I needed it at the time. I held it the way you hold someone’s hand in the dark. Not because you plan to stay there forever, but because in that moment you need something warm to remind you that you are not alone.

I think a part of me always knew he was not someone I could keep. It is like standing in a house you already know you will move out of. You can decorate the walls, you can sleep in the bed, you can make morning coffee in the kitchen, but deep down you feel that quiet ache that tells you this is temporary. You feel it every time you breathe.

People say love should be enough, but sometimes it is not. Two people can genuinely for each other and still not end up together. You can try to hold on, but it starts to feel like gripping water. The harder you try, the faster it slips through your fingers.

And it hurts. It hurts because something good ended. It hurts because a part of you wishes it could have been different. It hurts because love lived in your hands and then suddenly did not. It is okay to feel all of that. It is okay to get angry at the timing, at yourselves, at how unfair life can be. Those emotions are real. They are the price you pay for having cared at all.

Sometimes the kindest thing you can do for what you had is to let it go. To release it with gratitude and with the understanding that it mattered, even if it did not last. Even if the other person moves on quickly after the breakup, that is their way of coping and it does not erase the value of what you shared. Sometimes people are carrying so much pain that they seek a momentary relief, and that choice reflects their own process.

Humans are not meant to be kept like objects on a shelf. They are meant to change. They grow, they shift, they become new versions of themselves. Sometimes that growth keeps you together. Sometimes it pulls you apart.

He loved me. I loved him too. That love was real. And it ended. Moving on does not erase the truth of it. Healing is simply what you owe yourself on the way to whatever comes next.",10,1764329598.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,2,0.92,False

New planners, 5AM alarms, gym memberships, vision boards. It’s easy to build a habit when you’re motivated and everything's going well. But then work piles up. You get sick. You’re stressed, tired, bored. Suddenly the new habit is gone, replaced by old comforts.

This is way more common than most influencers admit. The internet is full of misleading advice like “just stay disciplined” and “you don’t want it bad enough.” That kind of talk ignores what real behavioral science and habit research actually say. If habits collapse the moment life gets hard, they weren’t built right in the first place.

So this post is a breakdown of what actually works, based on insights from top behavioral researchers, neuroscience podcasts, and habit psychology books. Not hype. Actual tools. That you can apply right away.

---

*First thing to know: it's not all your fault if your habits don’t stick.*

James Clear, author of *Atomic Habits*, points out that humans don’t rise to the level of their goals, we fall to the level of our systems. When you’re stressed or lazy, your system is what saves you—or sabotages you.

Stanford behavioral scientist BJ Fogg, in his book *Tiny Habits*, says most people try to build habits that are too big, too vague, or too reliant on motivation. That’s why they fall apart during hard times. But with the right strategies, habits can become nearly automatic—even when motivation hits rock bottom.

Here’s how.

---

*Here’s the no-BS guide to building habits that don’t die when life gets messy:*

* **Shrink the habit until it feels almost stupid**
    * *Insight from:* BJ Fogg, *Tiny Habits*
    * Make the habit so small it feels effortless. Not “go for a run” but “put on your running shoes.” Not “meditate 20 mins” but “take one deep breath.” These tiny actions bypass resistance and build consistency.
    * *Why it works:* When stressed or low-energy, your brain’s executive function drops. Small habits don’t trigger that resistance. Fogg found that people who started with micro-habits were more likely to scale them naturally over time.

* **Anchor the habit to something that already happens**
    * *Habit architecture tip from:* Charles Duhigg’s *The Power of Habit*
    * Choose a reliable cue like “after brushing teeth” or “right after I pour my morning coffee.” That predictability improves memory recall, so the habit triggers without needing extra willpower.
    * *Key stat:* MIT’s habit loop research showed that anchored cues are essential for habit formation because they create dependable mental pathways.

* **Use what Dr. Wendy Wood calls “friction hacking”**
    * *Expert insight:* Dr. Wood is a behavioral psychologist at USC and author of *Good Habits, Bad Habits*
    * Reduce barriers to good habits, and increase friction for bad ones. Lay out gym clothes in plain sight. Delete food delivery apps. Move phone chargers out of the bedroom.
    * *Study note:* In her 2019 research, Wood found that friction was a stronger determinant of habit success than motivation or even time availability.

* **Never skip twice**
    * *Rule from:* James Clear, *Atomic Habits*
    * Slipping once is fine, it happens. But two days in a row starts a new habit of *not* doing it. This rule encourages quick bounce-back, which builds identity-level resilience.
    * *Why it matters:* Studies in the *European Journal of Social Psychology* found that consistency, not perfection, predicts long-term behavior change.

* **Create a “minimum viable habit” plan for chaos days**
    * *Practical strategy from:* The Huberman Lab Podcast (Ep: “How to Stay Consistent”)
    * You need a fallback habit when life gets wild. If your normal workout is 45 minutes, your chaos plan might be 5 pushups. If your study routine is 2 hours, make the backup reading 1 paragraph.
    * *Brain science behind it:* Dr. Andrew Huberman mentions that keeping the *action pathway* alive, even if minimal, maintains the neural wiring of the habit loop.

* **Don’t rely on motivation, rely on environment**
    * *Real talk from:* Nir Eyal’s *Indistractable*
    * Motivation is unreliable. Design your environment so the habit is the easiest choice. Use visual cues, app blockers, lighting, reminders.
    * *Behavioral design tip:* Eyal argues distractions and temptations thrive in ambiguous environments. Clarity kills the need for constant motivation.

* **Invest in identity, not outcome**
    * *Concept from:* James Clear and Dr. Benjamin Hardy
    * Think “I’m someone who reads daily” not “I want to finish 20 books.” Habits that come from identity are more stable under pressure.
    * *Why this matters:* According to Hardy’s research in *Personality Isn’t Permanent*, identity-driven habits are self-reinforcing. When stressed, you revert to who you *believe* you are—not what you planned to do.

---

*Bonus tip:*

* **Reinforce the habit loop immediately**
    * *Advice from:* Charles Duhigg + Skinner-style behaviorism
    * Reward yourself ASAP after completing a habit. Could be a literal treat, a fist pump, or a positive self-talk line. It wires the brain to crave the repetition.
    * *Important note:* Dopamine doesn’t just reward completion—it also helps reinforce the *memory* of the action. That’s why immediate positive feedback matters.

---

All of this is backed by research that most TikTok advice totally ignores. The truth is, habits that survive stress aren’t built in extremes. They’re built in simplicity, clarity, and strategic laziness. You don’t need to “try harder.” You need to *design smarter*.

Habits should be able to survive your worst day, not just your best one. That’s how you win.",1,1764329130.0,MotivationByDesign,0,1.0,False
1p8sihd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1p8sihd/some_help_on_getting_passed_the_hurt_i_41m_have/,Some help on getting passed the hurt. I (41M) have separated from my wife (39F),"As the heading says I’m looking for advice on getting over my now Ex. We have been together since we were 15/16 respectively. We were best friends before getting together and have been inseparable for 25years. We had, which I thought was a fantastic relationship and marriage. We have three children together and were planning a trip to celebrate her 40th and our son’s 21st birthdays next year as a joint holiday for the 5 of us. So back a few months now I picked her up from work as I always did. She is self employed and works a few miles away and I’d take her to and from work. I’m a stay at home dad through illness/disability and I do everything and I mean everything. She works and that was it. She’d come home and just be on her phone which is always glued to her hands and constantly talking to her friends and customers. Which was annoying when she’d ignore me or the kids talking to her until I’d call her and she’d snap out of her phone. Then out of nowhere she tells me that she cannot do our relationship anymore and wants a divorce. This dropped the whole world out on backside. I was shocked and still am. She is (was) my world and I treated her like a queen I did everything for her from making her a coffee in the morning while I was doing the packed lunch for our youngest who is still in school, to ringing the drs for her when she needed an appointment but would not go to keeping all her appointments in my phone for her work. So we were talking and she was blaming it on my mental health. Which to be fair it has been bad in the past but the last four years I’ve been great! Even the drs have said so. So this is very confusing to me. So we continue to live as friends in the house with the kids and as time goes on it’s getting really hard for me as I have no one to talk to as my wife is my only friend/family so we go to speak to my mother in law who has been brilliant with me. She is shocked and saddened that my wife is leaving also. But my wife puts all the blame on me and I just have to agree with her as I’m a broken man at this point. Then as time goes on my wife is more and more angry and then she leaves the house and family to live with my mother in law. The kids and I are devastated and my eldest is very angry with her. Then over the next few weeks she has blocked me on everything and the only way I can contact her is through messages to my mother in law. My wife is seeing our two younger children maybe once a week now and sometimes it’s days in between her massaging the kids. I have now found out that she has a man on the go. Apparently it’s all new and it only happened once we were broken up a few weeks ago. But she has known this guy for a very long time through her work and he lives close to where she works also. If it is so new why is she staying over and going on long weekend date nights with this guy and being with him every moment when she isn’t working. It’s definitely not a new relationship and I believe she has been seeing this guy for much longer than she has said. This is killing me as I haven’t done anything wrong apart from being a supportive faithful husband. I am living in the family home with the kids still and today all her things that I’ve had to pack up singlehanded and her furniture is being moved out as she is moving in to her new house. I still cannot believe this is happening and no one can believe the change in her, physically or mentally. She has been loosing weight for the last two years and has lost 8 stone. She is looking fabulous and also in those two years she has gotten her teeth fixed and her hair is blonde and long. She is a walking cliche. A woman getting to nearly 40 looses weight, gets her teeth fixed, dumps her family and gets a new boyfriend. I don’t know if I’m finding this so difficult because we were best friends or because I’m autistic and change is horrendous or if I’m feeling so bad because this is also my first relationship and we have been together for 25 years married for 18. I’m being strong for the kids but honestly this has broken me. I was getting better over the break up then she left the home and cut contact with me and then the kids but she is still in some contact with the two youngest. Then I got knocked back down finding out about the guy. Now obviously going though all her things and packing them up is horrible. I’m hoping that once all her things are gone I can start rebuilding myself again. If she was unhappy in the marriage it’s fair enough but she never showed any signs that she was. I thought we were perfect and together forever as she would also agree with me. But since she has lost her weight she has clearly had a change of heart. This guy has a business. Isn’t disabled like myself. Has money. And as soon as he showed any interest she was gone. The lying as well saying that it was all my fault has hurt because pushing the blame on me and telling me and the family that there isn’t anyone else and there clearly was. Once I went to her work where she is the only person there as she is self employed and one day a few months back the toilet seat was up and I joked to her that she had had men in there and I was expecting her to laugh and say something like oh yeah I’ve had loads in here like we would always joke and we have a dark sense of humour but instead she went mental at me saying I’m psychotic and I need to see someone. So looking back I think she was gaslighting me for a long time. This one time before she left the house and I found out about the man I was still giving her a lift to work and we were talking and I said I’d help her in anyway possible to move like use my van to transport her things or help her anyway I can and her repose was how can you help you have no money! My sister in law cannot believe how she has been treating me and neither can my oldest son that’s one of the reasons he doesn’t bother with her anymore. I’m also worried that she is going to try to take my youngest off me and blame my mental health. She says no but I cannot believe anything she says now. I don’t know if I need legal advice. My mother in law says that my wife is very depressed and sad while she is round there. But she is constantly on her phone and my mother in law can see for herself how hard and annoying it is trying to communicate to my wife. Honestly I don’t know what to do. I am being the usual funny and supportive dad to the kids but inside I’m lost and feel physically sick when I think of her out there with her new man, living her best single life with no worries, no kids, just work and play. 
Sorry for the long post I’m just looking for any advice or anything really. Like I said I have no one to talk to about this and it’s been very difficult at the moment. All this has been happening over the last 3-4 months. 
Thanks for any advice on how to cope with this guys.

1p8si4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAMechanic/comments/1p8si4o/oil_leak_causing_turbo_limp_mode/,Oil leak causing turbo limp mode?,"Hey guys,

Sorry for such a long post but even though the title pretty much sums it up, theres a lot of info that migh be helpful.

My questions are:

-could the leak be somehow connected to the limp mode?
-what could be wrong for it to be leaking so much oil and coolant?



my 2004 golf 5 1.9tdi is cursed and seems like its leaking both oil and coolant which goes down the engines left side (when you open the hood its on your right but otherwise its the left side of the car where the battery is) and ends up in small pools of something brown looking like coffee under the engine. I have to refill both fluids often, like really often, very very very far from normal. I would say its like twice a week I have to refill half of my coolant, its gone just after standing in place for a few days.

When Im on the highway going about 140kmh sometimes (once in one or two months?) the turbo just shuts off and comes back when I restart the engine, be it static or in motion, just put it in neutral and turn it back on.

I was looking up what could cause this limp mode but I think this is a whole different thing. Or I mean changing the N75 valve and hoses might fix the turbo but probably not the leaks you know.

About 2 years ago, right after buying it, it underwent the usual 20 000 km timing chain service and stuff just to be sure its okay, where the head gasket was also changed, it leaked at first but that was because of a wrong gasket, all good after replacing it, 4 months ago it got its road safety test whatever so its road legal for the upcoming 2 years (europe), sorry for not using the right words, im sure you'll understand.

Why im saying this is I guess the diagnostics should be okay because they let it through the test no? So if it was a code for the turbo they would know. It's been serviced so many times i cant believe theres still stuff that can break.

1p8sez5,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthtime_official/comments/1p8sez5/coffee_loophole_diet_for_weight_loss/,Coffee “loophole diet” for weight loss,"I kept seeing people talk about a “coffee loophole” for easy fat loss, so I dug into what is actually behind it instead of just the before and after screenshots.



What it actually is: there is no formal “coffee loophole diet.” It is mostly a marketing term. The pattern is usually the same:

you take normal coffee and add a proprietary powdered supplement that claims to turn it into a fat burning drink, often with promises like “no diet or exercise needed.”



The real science part:

Coffee has caffeine, and caffeine can temporarily increase energy expenditure and slightly boost metabolic rate. Some studies show a modest bump in calorie burn after caffeine, but the effect is small, and your body develops tolerance over time. It is not enough on its own to create big, sustained weight loss.



The “secret powder” part is where it gets shaky. These blends often include things like green tea extract, L carnitine, chromium, or other stimulant type ingredients. The doses are rarely transparent, the blends are not independently tested, and many weight loss supplements are poorly regulated. There is also potential for side effects or interactions with meds.



What actually seems helpful around coffee:



Keeping coffee “clean”: black, or with a splash of milk or unsweetened plant drink. Sugary syrups, heavy cream, and big flavored lattes are where hidden calories creep in.



Using spices instead of sugar: small amounts of cinnamon or unsweetened cocoa powder for flavor and possible health benefits.



Timing it: a cup before a workout can help with energy and performance, which indirectly supports fat loss. Avoid late night caffeine if it hurts your sleep, because poor sleep is strongly linked with weight gain.



Pitfalls I keep circling back to:



Treating any drink or supplement as a magic fix instead of looking at total diet, movement, sleep, and consistency.



Letting a “loophole” idea distract from basics like protein intake, fiber, calorie balance, and overall food quality.



Taking unregulated powders with unclear dosing, especially if you have heart issues, anxiety, or are on medication.



My takeaway: the “coffee loophole diet” as advertised is more hype than substance. Coffee itself can be part of a healthy, weight loss friendly routine, but the heavy lifting still comes from overall nutrition, movement, and habits, not a secret scoop of powder.



Question for the sub:

How do you use coffee in your own routine, if at all, for appetite, energy, or training. And has anyone here actually tried one of these “coffee loophole” products and gotten bloodwork or other objective data before and after.

Just recently I have started matching his energy instead of just bring this quiet shell of a person in the corner. Oh, and we do not live together, a few miles apart and I pay all of my own bills. I do stay at hid place often though. 

-He stomps around all morning while getting ready for work, waking everyone up. He thinks it's ok because he is blue collar and has a physically demanding job so he feels he is entitled. I accidentally slammed a door the other day while getting ready for work and he BLEW UP on me. I am white collar and get to be cozy inside but he puts me down for that. 

-I have set the coffee, packed lunches and made dinners for years and when my job moved from remote to in office did he think to help me? NOPE, so I stopped doing it for him and he got annoyed, accused me.of cheating.

-I am close with my sister and we talk/text often. He CANNOT stand it and again, accuses me of cheating. His phone was active yesterday and I asked what was going on. Got mad at me for even asking.

-In the store the other day he yelled at me because I didn't understand what he was saying and asked. People were staring and I was mortified, walked away and started to cry. He picked up the pace, pushed the cart and didn't even acknowledge me. Pretty much high-tailed it to the car leaving me in the dust, then acted like everything was OK. 
         - We went to dinner later and when he wouldn't stop bragging to every bar tender about his new promotion after we were already to go and I had asked multiple times to leave, I started to walk to the car. I was called a c*nt for that.

I don't think I can do this anymore. It gets worse around the holidays top, there is this grandiose sense that comes out of him. I have been spending more and more time at my place, and the funny thing is, he hasn't even been there in 6 MONTHS (2 MILES AWAY). I make all the effort.

# **ASTRANAUTICA**

## **Episode - Pilot: “The Sky Is A Ride”**

---  

# **COLD OPEN — “THE LEGACY TEST”**

**EXT. ASTRANAUTICA THEME PARK — PRE-DAWN**

Spotlights sweep over chrome spires and gravity-defying track loops. Workers in reflective vests scramble like a pit crew.

**INT. RIDE VAULT / TECH BAY**

Close on **an ancient reel-to-reel machine** flicking on by itself.

We hear the founder’s voice — **OCTAVIO MARQUEZ** — warm, amused, half-mad:

**TAVI (V.O.)**  
*“If the sky ever stops feeling large… you’re doing it wrong.”*

As his words play, we see **emergency lights flash**, engineers sprinting. Something is clearly on fire.

**CUT TO:** A test cart shoots down an unfinished track, sparks flying. **KAI DEL CASTILLO** is literally *riding it like a mechanical bull*, holding a tablet with one hand.

**KAI**  
“THIS IS NOT A PASSIVE-SAFETY SYSTEM!”

He sails past stunned onlookers.

**SMASH CUT TO TITLE: ASTRANAUTICA**

---

# **ACT I — “SYNERGY MANDATE”**

### **1. LYDIA’S MORNING**

**LYDIA ROOKE** power-walks through **the Astranautica Design Annex** — part art studio, part war room. She’s clutching her coffee and a stack of “URGENT: SYNERGY” memos from the studio executive.

Everyone snaps to attention as she enters. She hates it. They know she hates it.

**Vera Mink** is building a puzzle box that *hisses* when opened.

**Zed Tannery** is on draft twelve of “THE LEGEND OF STAR-FORGE™: THE RIDE (TEMP TITLE)”.

**Jayna Weathers** is testing a miniature explosion under a metal hood.

**LYDIA**  
“I’ve been here 40 seconds and three things are on fire.”

**JAYNA**  
“I feel like it's important to distinguish that: one is intentional.”

### **2. MAG ARRIVES WITH A DECREE**

**MAG MAGNUSSON**, wearing a too-perfect smile, enters with a delegation of suits.

He announces the new initiative:  
**ASTRANAUTICA WILL PARTNER WITH SILVERSTAR STUDIOS.**

They need a ride ready to coincide with a sequel film still in rewrites.

Lydia’s face falls. The team groans.

**MAG**  
“Think of it as a *cross-media harmonic alignment*.”

**VERA**  
“Enough harmonic alignments. That phrase is a war crime.”

Mag insists they adapt their current project — a surrealist space-myth experience — into a more “brand-forward” ride.

Lydia tries to be diplomatic.

**LYDIA**  
“I understand the request. We’ll consider adjustments.”

**MAG**  
(interrupting)  
“Not adjustments. Mandatory overhaul.”

The suits leave. Lydia’s smile dies.

---

# **ACT II — “THE FOUNDER’S GHOST”**

### **3. THE TAPE ROOM**

Lydia escapes to the **Founder Archive**, a humidity-controlled bunker containing Tavi’s notes, sketches, and countless bizarre voice tapes.

She puts on headphones.

**TAVI (V.O.)**  
*“Everyone wants to believe the magic when they see the invoice.”*

She laughs in spite of herself — until the tape glitches and reveals a fragment she’s never heard:

**TAVI (V.O.)**  
*“If you're hearing this, it means The Heliograph is now possible. Don’t let them ruin it.”*

She freezes.

She rewinds and can’t find the line again.

### **4. RUMORS IGNITE**

She tells Kai and Vera. Their eyes widen.

**KAI**  
“The Heliograph? I thought that was like the attractive cousin of an urban legend.”

**VERA**  
“It’s symmetrical. Urban legends aren’t symmetrical.”

Zed overhears.

**ZED**  
“Oh no. Not another ghost project. I need fewer mysteries in my life.”

Lydia explains the problem:  
If Mag learns about Tavi’s last project, he’ll turn it into a synergy-laden blockbuster ride before they can even decipher it.

They swear secrecy.

### **5. SYNERGY CHAOS**

A narrative emerges:

Mag forces Zed to meet with the Silverstar film’s director — a man who doesn’t know what he wants but demands the ride include “more emotional beats” and “less lasers.”

Jayna tries to incorporate the notes by building a prototype of a chase segment… which immediately blows out a test wall.

Vera’s queue-line puzzle — designed to determine patience thresholds — ends up holding guests in a loop for twenty minutes.

Kai’s track mock-up repeatedly boots into “dramatic pose mode,” halting mid-air so the mechanical arms can flex artistically (a leftover Tavi bug).

Everything is collapsing at once.

---  

# **ACT III — “THE IMPOSSIBLE ASK”**

### **6. THE ACCIDENT & THE ULTIMATUM**

One of Jayna’s stunt rigs misfires in the staging bay, sending a test dummy hurtling into a corporate golf cart. No one is hurt. But Mag is furious.

Mag gives Lydia an ultimatum:  
**“Deliver a functional ride pitch by Friday — or Echelon restructures the entire division.”**

That means layoffs. Demotions. Creative death.

The team stares at Lydia. Waiting.

She breaks.

**LYDIA**  
“We’re changing course. We’re building The Heliograph.”

Everyone erupts.

**ZED**  
“You want to build the founder’s last ride that maybe doesn’t exist?”

**VERA**  
“That’s not entirely fair. It definitely doesn’t exist.”

**KAI**  
“I’m in.”

The others follow.

### **7. WHAT IS THE HELIOGRAPH?**

From the fragments they know:

* It was Tavi’s “ride to end all rides.”  
* It used “heliometric illusions” — vague, unknown tech.  
* It was supposedly too ambitious to build.

Lydia reveals the only clue she has: the **glitchy founder tape**.

Kai suggests the glitch might mean hidden data. He insists on physical inspection.

---  

# **ACT IV — “THE KEY IN THE CAROUSEL”**

### **8. A TREASURE HUNT BEGINS**

Vera cross-references the phrase “heliometric” with old blueprint catalogues.

Jayna breaks into the closed “Nebula Carousel” — one of Tavi’s first attractions — because early rumors claim he hid discarded concepts in the animatronic housings.

Zed goes through paperwork hell to get staging permits, lying on forms using increasingly desperate pseudonyms.

### **9. THE DISCOVERY**

Kai and Lydia dismantle a decades-old projector in the Carousel control booth. Inside: an encoded metal disc.

They bring it back to Vera.

It’s a scratched rotating mirror inscribed with coordinates.

**VERA**  
“Oh. Good. A puzzle that can blind me.”

She holds it up to the light — the mirrors scatter the beam across the walls, forming a crude starburst.

But one beam hits a **specific spot on the blueprint wall**, where a forgotten panel hangs.

Behind it:  
**THE HELIOGRAPH MASTER PLAN — PAGE 1.**

It’s magnificent, impossible, and still incomplete.

Lydia’s eyes fill with something between awe and terror.

---

# **ACT V — “THE PITCH”**

### **10. MAG’S PRESENTATION ROOM**

Mag expects a synergy-driven Silverstar sequel ride.

The team files in, disheveled, scorched, hopeful.

Lydia steps up.

She takes a breath.

**LYDIA**  
“We can build you a brand tie-in.  
Or we can build Astranautica’s future.”

She unveils the panel: glowing diagrams, sketches, Tavi’s elegant chaos.

**LYDIA (cont’d)**  
“Introducing: **THE HELIOGRAPH**.  
The founder’s final vision.  
A ride not based on a film…  
but a ride worthy of a film.”

Mag is stunned. The suits whisper.

He squints.

**MAG**  
“…Is this possible?”

Lydia smiles.

**LYDIA**  
“It will be.”

### **11. CLIFFHANGER**

The suits deliberate. Mag looks uneasy.

Finally:

**MAG**  
“Provisional approval.  
You have eight weeks.”

Gasps. Eight weeks is suicide.

**MAG (cont’d)**  
“You'll have to pull your budget from your other rides.”

The team stares at Lydia. This is madness.

She whispers:

**LYDIA**  
“Welcome to the impossible.”

**SMASH CUT TO BLACK.**

Emotional affair with teacher just ended and I think he is gaslighting me. My brain is twisted upside down and my heart is torn out of my cheat.,"Well, I'm writing this story here because geniuly, even in the perspective of my whole life which was basically trauma after trauma, I can't believe what just happened. For a few days I was basically crying constantly and thought I was going mad, loosing my sense of self and aftaid I would just die. The whole story would be very long, so I will present it briefly. When I was 16 I met a slightly older woman(25), we quickly developed a very close relationship and she introduced me to her partner from back then who was also her university profesor(but they got together after she graduated). From that reason I was sometimes seeing him and having some smalltalk with him since we were basically visiting her similarly often. A few years later I started attending the same uni as her. She left some of her books in his office and decided to pass them to me. Thats how my relationship with him (profesor) started. He could just give those books to me, but when I came into his office he was brewing coffee, had music put on, and asked a weird for our at this point very superficial relationship question like ,,We haven't seen each other for a long time.How did you end up here? What were you up to during this time?"" and somehow we talked for hours, until the room was completely dark. The whole conversation was from perspective vey strange, becasuse he wasn't really saying anything, just listening with this complete attention to everything I was saying, saying again and again that he understands everything or humming and nodding with understanding, or referencing some literary piece that perfectly fitted and described my experience, then encouraging me to disclose more. This whole experience was for me at that moment a 19 year old something completely out of ordinary. I was lonely, traumatized quite badly from at least two situations, my mother was verbally abusive and very emotionaly dismissive, my father absent. Then he suggested that I take only half of the books and come again to take the rest. Everything was going the same way the second time, then he suggested that I might take them in 3 parts and come again. Back then I didn't realised that he added more books than my ex-friend wanted to give me, probably just to have a reason to see me again (I see no other). Then he suggested he would like to see my essey, then that we might meet in the cafeteria and discuss it. Then he started giving me for free books he was at this time translating, and using it as an excuse for me to come to his office. Also always when I was flying abroad to visit said ex-friend, he wanted me ,,give him a report"" of how it went, so again come to his office and chat with him until the room got dark. Then he started borrowing me his books, so of course I had to then come see him to give them back. Again, now recollecting, all those meetings were equally strange in a sense that he wasn't really saying anything besides showing perfect understanding for all my issues. I started believing that he was my soulmate or some cosmic twin. I think he was feeding that since he once asked when is my birthday since he was ,,thinking about our natures""and when I told him, he concluded that the difference between us is only in intensity, because he was born at autumn and I at winter. Later he suggested that I might write a cover note for his book, later an afterward, then that maybe I might go with him for a conference, then that he will happily read my poems and publish them if I would like too. He also sometimes would just give some books, or sweets or have food prepeared for my visit. Always texted me fairly elaborate wishes for various holidays. Then, on second year the relationship started to intensify. We started going out for dinners for which he insisted to pay, I don't even remember how it started. Then one day I came to uni when I didn't have any classes just to see him and I remember he was very pleased. Then one day he finally came to me on corridor and said he ,,shyly asks me to just meet him"". No books, no other excuses than to just see me. Those meetings muliplied. I think we were seeing each other weekly at this point, he also started to sit closer and closer to me at dinner or at his office, started prolonging our goodbye hugs and then finally once he waited until no one was at corridor, approached me and when I tried hugging him he stood in place looking at my lips with a smug. I was quite flabergasted, the man was 70 yo. Then he drew me closer, kissed my cheek and asked flirtatiously if I'm surprised. Every sane person would probably remove oneself from the situation at this point, but I was at this point convinced he was some cosmic twin of mine. I didn't have the guts to kiss him, so during every meeting of ours for a few times we were staring longingly at our lips going out of our greeting hug. Oh! Those meetings also started going until sometimes 10pm and he would then drive me home. He also said that time disappears when he's with me(I also felt that way), that he is open for me, that he has no one to talk to. Once when I was hugging him on goodbye in the car he rested his temple on mine and shaking started caressing my hand. I thought I geniuly dreamed it up. At this point I was convinced it was ,,true love"" or something so at one of our meetings I said to him that I'm afraid I dreamed him up. To which he made the most tormented face expression I've ever seen in my life and went silent for minutes and minutes. Finally I told him he doesn't have to say anything if he doesn't want to, because I really didn't know how to react to this situation. After that he changed the topic, proposed me another coffee and asked when are we going to see each other again. Another time I was hugging him, he drew me in closer, hugged my head to his chest, layed his chin on my head and started playing with my hair. I told him then, because I would already trust him with my life, that he is really important to me because I have no one else to talk to and that I'm so afraid of going insane. I was already badly sleeping, depressed , anxious had eating disorders and now also involved with an old man. He just kept me in this embrace for a long time, and when I was leaving it, we again were staring at each others lips and I finally reached for a kiss, to which he was clearly satisfied and happy with himself but at the same time stopped me and scolded me like a child, then again pulled me closer and when I apologised, he again didn't say anything then asked me when will we meet again. Our hugs often lasted minutes and minutes, he would pull me to his chest, caress my hair, touch on my waist, caress my neck, pet my naple with his thumb and ramble in loving, calming tone to my ear. Once I told him that I would like to stand like that for eternity, to which he didn't say anything, besides caressing my waist, but then texted me the whole eveing asking about my life etc. He generally was overtly interested in my life, like in every small detail, asking about everything and also remembering everything that I said. He would also often compliment in almost insane way. Besides saying how intelligent, soulfull, beutiful etc I am he was also suggesting that I'm a genius, compared me to literary heroines, great poets, saints. I started having intense symbolic dreams about him, felt like I am in a dream, or loosing my senses, because it all seemed way too good to be true. Then he randomly disclosed during spring that he is going for holidays with his partner, but he is leaving me keys to his office to watch movies. I was very confused, but I didn't say anything, because to be honest it all was already too intoxicating and I lost my head. When I entered his room alone I saw notes in french saying how we are migrating into the unknown, but this sweet moment of happines could last, how he would be honoured if I liked to accompany him in his sorrow, how he suddenly saw something really strange. I, driven by the logic that if he will not throw me out after this insanity, he will never throw me out, left a note saying that his soul is the same as mine, which makes the night that we are in less scary and that we already are on the path into unknown. After he read those notes he only texted me ,,It""s always too late for everything"" and started texting me everyday. There was also a situation when he suggested to me that there is no difference between me and him and that my only flaw is my belief in God (he is an atheist). I texted him around this time that I am seriously and honestly warning him that my feelings might develop. He again treated me with silence but continued the intensity. I felt the need to tell about us my ex friend. I told him, that at the same time I have no idea what to even tell her. His reaction was again to sit for minutes and minutes in silence with complete torment written on the face, then said maybe friendship?. A week later he came to me with Bruckner's ,,Romantic symphony"" saying it maybe him think about me. The holidays started but we were still meeting at least every two weeks, completely outside of school obligations, strolling around the city, bars, parcs. Every meeting ended with at least 15 min hug, body pressed to body, my head on his heart, synchronizing our breaths in complete silence. I asked a lot of time at this point if out contact is not too intense, to which he always protested, I even apologised to him about the physical intimacy remembering the silences, to which he just smiled and told me there is no reason to. I think I also went psychotic at that time. Or at least something of that sort. I suddenly started falling into random extremely intense meditative states during which I had insanely vivid religious visions and elaborate dialogues with Christ and Virgin Mary. I also had monthly states when I would hysterically laugh and cry everyday, because I was geniuly convinced that I as a bride of Jesus. I converted, wanted to join a convent, become a saint and write theological treaties. I was literally hallucinating in churches. My profesor was the only person who knew about this, he asked even if he is the only one, and seemed happy at the affirmative anwser. He admired and encouraged those states, shared my narrative that I am a future saint, and thanked me for the honour of being my sort of confessor. Even when I started flogging myself and visibly restricting food. Then he had to suddenly go for over a month trip. I was already so dependent on him that I almost cried when leaving the car, but considering his constant dismisses when I was showing emotion I told him not to worry. And he just left it at that. No further questions. I was really quite shocked. He texted me almost everyday during this trip. When I mentioned that I miss him or that he is important to me, he again treated it with silence. Then randomly said he also misses me and that he was intrugued by me the moment he saw me. I said it was mutual and he concluded that we agree on everything besides God, which soon might change anyway since if my visions will continue I will make him convert. I was disclosing to him my more and more bad state, I was often waking up in tears. He had for this his typical ,,understanding"" and some beutiful literary quote that fitted with what I was saying, but besides that just silence. When he finally came back from those holidays, we again sitted in his office until late evening. I even asked him then if I can hug him more, I didn't manage to finish the sentence until he grabbed me in his arms thanking me for mercy. I lasted for nearly an hour and I think at this moment he would fuck me because he was pushing me already onto the desk, hard, with hand almost on my hips. But something really funny happened - a security guy came to check if his okay because it was so late and he wasn't leaving the building. Those type of embraces would go on through whole october and half of november. Also the schoolyear started so I was seeing him monday, tuesday, wednesday for hours. And texting. I also started coming to him on breaks at that point. I often was standing for minutes and minutes hidden in his arms, listening to his heartbeat and telling him every little detail about my day, while he was lovingly joking and flirting with me. We would sit on the sofa in the cafe basically cuddling. He also made me sort of his asssitant during claseses. To be honest everyone at this point was staring. I once left him a note in french saying that I really really missed him when he was gone. To which he invited me to talk, but instead of talking to me he stared at me in silence, then changed the topic, then again took me in his arms. I was becoming worse and worse I was sleeping badly, crying all the time, acting insanely to drew out of him some clarity, bur every time I expressed this type of emotion he became silent, then said that we are friends. Then that he would really love to ,,head with me to the end but time and space is standing in our way"". Then put a responsibility on me to decide if we should continue the relationship or end it. Which was of course completely impossible to me at this point, since I was completely dependent on him, also with my visions. Everyone else would say that I am crazy. A week ago he sent me a message that he is now in miraculous relationship and what we are doing is sin and a fall into the void. I was devastated. I had to end the relationship since I didn't want him to be unhappy, but I litarally thought that I am dying and going crazy. When I tried to reach out for him he just responded with the text saying that maybe only death is a way out of that dream and then literary ghosted me. I was literally broken. I phoned crisis lines the whole first night. When I met him a week later, when I was even able to get out of my bed at uni, he begged me with tears in his eyes to not be angry at him, but when I tried to start with him some conversation he went silent and left the room. He started texting me about our only options being ,,neutrality or nothing"" and when I explained that he said that I don't want to go through the same thing again and that I am really broken into pieces, he coldly proposed cutting contact, then threatened me that if I will keep acting like that he will not even let me in for short smalltalk, then called this whole situation a misunderstanding, claimed he would never thought that something romantic was between us. Then blaimed everything for always inadequeate words and cruel universe. I'm sort of better now, but for weeks and weeks I was feeling like I am loosing my sanity. Am I overreacting?

These costs blend into daily life without much thought.

But when the topic shifts to even a basic, entry-level form of Bitcoin mining, the entire mood changes. The same people who casually swipe ₹800 for a food delivery suddenly feel like a small mining experiment is a “serious decision.”

And that’s the interesting contrast.

Mining in India isn’t blocked by cost as much as by perception.  
For many, the word “mining” still brings to mind industrial warehouses, noisy hardware, and massive electricity bills, even though the reality has changed a lot over the years.

So here’s what we’re trying to understand:

Исследование проводили среди пациентов с психическими заболеваниями, старение которых обычно ускоряется, но даже в этом случае кофеин имел выраженный терапевтический эффект.**

Теломеры располагаются на концах хромосом и выполняют защитную функцию. Укорочение теломер считается естественным процессом старения. Известно, что у людей с тяжелыми психическими заболеваниями, такими как шизофрения, биполярное расстройство, теломеры укорачиваются быстрее. Ученые из США решили выяснить, может ли потребление кофе у пациентов с такими диагнозами иметь положительный эффект на длину теломер. Выводы [опубликованы](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-11-daily-coffee-biological-aging-people.html) на сайте Medical Express.

В исследовании приняли участие 436 человек с шизофренией или депрессией или биполярным расстройством. Ученые выяснили, как часто и в каком количестве они пьют кофе, а также курят.

Результаты показали значительную разницу между добровольцами. Так, потребление до 3-4 чашек кофе в день было связано с наиболее длинными теломерами по сравнению с теми, кто не пил кофе или пил более 5 чашек в день.

>В группе до 3-4 чашек кофе длина теломер оказалась сопоставима с биологическим возрастом, который был на пять лет меньше тех, кто вообще не пил кофе.

Результаты получены после учета различных сопутствующих факторов от пола и возраста до анамнеза.

Авторы считают, что причина может быть в мощных антиоксидантных и противовоспалительных соединениях в кофе. «Теломеры очень чувствительны к окислительному стрессу и к воспалению. Это подтверждает, что потребление кофе может способствовать замедлению старения клеток», — заключили они.

Six months ago I bought my first coffee machine, the Sage Barista Express Impress. I’m very satisfied so far. I like the taste of the coffee, I’m able to hit a 1:2 ratio, so that’s all good.

I’ve noticed that I’m starting to enjoy making and drinking coffee more and more. I think it would be fun to do more myself instead of using an everything in one machine. I also read and see a lot online that the Impress is a great entry-level model, but that the grinder could be better.

So I’m now looking into what I can upgrade: a bottomless portafilter, buying a WDT tool, etc. But what would you recommend if I want to upgrade without immediately spending 2000 dollars?

Chapter 1

After I hung up the phone, Elise's messages were still flooding the dorm group chat.
""@everyone, who wants coffee tomorrow? Send me your order and sweetness level before eight in the morning. I'll compile everything!""
Her message was followed by, ""Our slogan is: Follow Elise. Drink as much coffee as you want!""
""By the way, starting tomorrow, the service fee will go up from one dollar to one sixty. After all, the year-round free card is a rare resource. Hope everyone understands.""
She even gave herself the title of CEO, strutting around the group as though she were running a small empire.
Another roommate, Colette Beaumont, the one who had been the loudest cheerleader earlier, sent me a private message.
""Nat, does that unlimited pass... Is it even real?""
Her tone carried cautious worry.
Looking at her message, I could practically see her hesitant little face.
I smiled and typed back, ""Don't worry. Just sit back and enjoy the show.""
At ten that night, the dorm door burst open with a loud bang.
Elise was back.
Elise was carrying seven or eight shopping bags, looking so triumphant she might as well have been walking a red carpet.
With a dramatic smack, she dumped everything onto her desk, scattering clothes and makeup boxes all over.
A roommate caught sight of the logos and whispered in awe, ""Oh my god, that's Chanel powder and Dior lipstick!""
Hearing that, Elise lifted her chin even higher and said airily, ""That's nothing. Once my project gets bigger, these will just be everyday purchases.""
Then she turned to me, her bossy attitude kicking in again.
""Natalie, you seem pretty free all day. Starting today, you'll handle all the dorm cleaning for the next week.""
I raised my eyebrows but said nothing.
Hands on her hips, she added, ""I'm the CEO here. I handle hundreds of orders every day and maintain client relationships. How could I possibly waste time on chores like sweeping and taking out the trash?
""Just think of it as contributing to our dorm's startup.""
Looking at her flushed, self-satisfied face, I couldn't help but sneer silently.
Someone who called herself a CEO because of a fake poster. Logic simply didn't exist in her world.
I nodded. ""Sure.
""Wishing you booming business and a speedy IPO.""
My compliance clearly pleased her.
Elise looked even more smug, her eyes full of contempt, as if saying, ""See? So what if you have money? You're still under my thumb.""
She probably thought I was awed by her ""business genius"" and ""queenly aura.""
But then, right in front of all of us, Elise opened her so-called Coffee VIP Group.
She posted an announcement, ""Let me introduce my partner to all our 'shareholders'—Natalie, the holder of the unlimited pass!""
She even uploaded a screenshot of my Instagram profile picture.
""From now on, I'll handle operations and orders, and she'll provide the pass, our core resource. With our combined strength, coffee freedom for everyone!""
The group instantly exploded with comments, ""Nat, you're amazing!"" ""So generous!""
The smile on my face slowly faded.
This woman not only wanted to profit off me but also to drag my name down with her sinking ship.
If things blew up, I'd be accused of providing the very tool used for the scam.
Fantastic. Just fantastic.

Chapter 2

Elise's ""business"" took off like a snowball, faster and bolder every single day.
She started flaunting her new designer clothes, strutting down the busiest paths on campus every day.
The woman who once wore washed-out jeans and kept her head down had turned into a self-proclaimed businesswoman who moved with swagger.
She was constantly surrounded by admirers—some hoping to profit off her success, others genuinely dazzled by her nerve and ambition.
""Elise, how many orders did you land today?""
""Elise, that trench coat is gorgeous. Is it Burberry?""
Elise basked in all the attention, practically glowing. Her attitude toward me, however, grew worse by the day.
She'd take loud ""business calls"" right when I was trying to nap, bragging about handling orders for hundreds of cups of coffee.
Sometimes she'd even parade her ""big clients"" into our dorm, showing off like she owned the place.
That afternoon, I was bent over a design draft when the door burst open and Elise swept in with two girls dressed to impress.
""Look, this is my dorm,"" she announced, giving them a tour like she was hosting a documentary. ""The startup environment's a little rough, but the dream's huge.""
Then she pointed at my desk and said, ""See that? That's my partner, Natalie.
""Her family's got some money, but sadly, she's not exactly business-minded. So she just helps me with the easy stuff.""
The two girls exchanged a look and turned to me with expressions that were part curiosity, part judgment.
There was some pity, a hint of disdain, and mostly the assumption that I was someone easy to push around.
So that was what I'd become. The quiet, harmless one.
My fingers tightened slightly around the pen, but my face stayed neutral.
I glanced up at them, gave a disinterested look, and went right back to my work.
To Elise, my silence was proof that I was scared of her.
She really believed she was destined to become a businesswoman—someone who'd crush family companies like mine without breaking a sweat.
What she didn't know was that my phone, propped up against the pen holder, had been recording everything from the start.
Every single word out of her mouth was being captured clearly.
By Wednesday afternoon, desperate to boost her ""brand"" and silence anyone doubting her, Elise dropped a bombshell in her reseller group and on Instagram. ""Big news! This Saturday at 2 p.m., I'm hosting the ultimate Coffee Carnival!""
""I'll be at the Maple Street Coffee by the school gate, redeeming 300 cups of coffee for my shareholders!""
""I want everyone to see just how real and reliable my supply chain is!""
To crank up the hype, she launched an even bigger pre-sale campaign.
""Carnival special! Prepay twenty bucks and get any three drinks at the event! Limited spots. First come, first served!""
The announcement spread through campus like wildfire.
By the end of the day, almost everyone knew: Elise from the design department and her rich roommate Natalie had supposedly gotten hold of a year-round unlimited pass from the coffee shop, and Elise was going to ""show her power"" this Saturday.
Even my academic advisor heard about it and called me in.
""Natalie, I heard you're involved in some kind of business on campus?""
He gave me a grave look. ""The school doesn't encourage students to run unapproved commercial ventures, especially the kind that could cause trouble. You need to be careful about the impact.""
Standing there in his office, I finally realized that the web Elise had spun around me wasn't just holding me down anymore. It was starting to tighten around my throat.

Chapter 3

On the eve of the Coffee Carnival, the atmosphere in our dorm was suffocating.
Elise's vanity had swelled to an almost ridiculous level.
She had just finished a one-hour conference call with her ""regional agents,"" discussing how to maintain order at tomorrow's grand event.
After hanging up, she marched over to me, hand outstretched, and her tone commanding. ""Natalie, give me that coffee card.""
I looked up from my computer screen, calm and unbothered. ""Why would I do that?""
""To keep it safe, obviously!""
She said it as if it were the most reasonable thing in the world. ""Tomorrow's going to be huge. What if you change your mind, get jealous of how much money I'm making, and refuse to hand it over? I'll only feel at ease if I'm holding it myself.""
I almost laughed out loud at how shameless she sounded.
""I refuse,"" I said flatly, my voice like ice.
Elise's face twisted in an instant.
""What's that supposed to mean? Natalie, don't forget we're partners! The project's at its most crucial stage right now. What trick are you trying to pull? Planning to take all the profits for yourself?""
She slammed her hand on the desk. ""I knew it! You're jealous! You can't stand that I've got better business instincts than you, that people actually like me more than you!
""You, a pampered girl who's lived off her family your entire life—how could you stomach watching someone like me, who came from nothing, build something successful? Does it kill you inside?""
Melanie Oliver and Colette rushed over to intervene.
""Elise, lower your voice. Let's talk this out.""
""Yeah, stop yelling. Don't you still have the event tomorrow?""
Elise shoved their hands away, snapping, ""Get out of my face! You two broke girls would obviously take her side! What, did she buy your loyalty with a few scraps? How much does it cost to turn you into her lapdogs?""
The words were so nasty that both Melanie and Colette flushed red, their eyes brimming with tears.
I watched Elise unravel in the middle of the dorm, her hysteria filling the room. I felt absolutely nothing.
Once, I actually thought there was still something decent in her—that she was just drunk on her sudden ""success.""
Now I knew I'd been wrong.
She was rotten to the core from the start.
When bullying didn't work and insults didn't move me, Elise, driven mad with frustration, made an even more extreme decision.
She stormed back to her desk, flipped open her laptop, and began typing furiously.
Half an hour later.
My phone began to vibrate nonstop.
Across the school forum, Instagram, and every major platform, a long post titled ""Accusation! The Rich Roommate Who Tried to Destroy Everything I Built"" was spreading like wildfire.
In it, Elise poured out her fabricated misery, describing my supposed ""crimes"" in a tone dripping with emotion.
She painted herself as a poor but hardworking entrepreneur who had clawed her way up from nothing.
And me? I was the heartless rich girl who couldn't stand to see her succeed, who tried to steal the free coffee card and take credit for everything she'd built.
She even wrote, ""My only mistake was being born into a poor family.""
""I worked so hard to change my fate, but now I'm being crushed by the merciless hand of capital. Tomorrow might be the day my dreams are shattered because she wants to destroy everything I have.""
The post exploded across campus in minutes.
The chasm between the rich and the poor was the magic words for instant attention.
Most of the students, clueless about the truth, were completely swayed by her crocodile tears.
They started taking her side, turning their outrage on me, ""So disgusting. Just because you're rich, you think you can step on others? Can't stand seeing someone else succeed?""
""Natalie is seriously vile. Do you know how hard it is for a poor student to start a business?""
""Boycott Natalie! Stand with Elise!""
Within an hour, my social media was flooded by thousands of comments filled with curses, insults, and hate.
I had become the school's public enemy number one.
Colette and Melanie looked at me, worry written all over their faces, wanting to say something but not knowing where to start.
I turned off my phone. The screen went dark, reflecting the blankness of my own face.
Tomorrow, I'd be walking straight into Elise's public execution, while thousands of students stood by to watch me burn.
I lay down on my bed and closed my eyes.

I’m a nudist in the Maryville/Knoxville area and I’m hoping to meet some local people who are into social nudism. Being a single guy makes it a bit tricky to find others, so I figured I’d put myself out there.

I’m just looking for normal, chill friends—singles, couples, guys, girls—anyone who enjoys the nudist lifestyle in a respectful, non-sexual (or even sexual) way. Would like people to hang out with, talk to, and eventually get comfortable enough for group activities.

I’m into checking out nudist resorts, having small trusted hangouts at home, doing group nudist activities or outdoor stuff, enjoying clothesless time with good company, and even regular clothed meetups too—coffee, food, hikes, whatever sounds fun, when nude activities are not possible. 

Basically, I’m hoping to find a few people who enjoy good vibes, body-positivity, genuine friendship, and have a genuine love for Nudism. And if you are new to Nudism or curious about it, or considering trying it, I'd love to hear from you too.

If you’re in the area and this sounds cool, feel free to comment or shoot me a DM. Always down to make new friends.

I got it from Coffee Hit in the UK and I can’t recommend them highly enough. Such great service and patent advice, both pre and post sales. 

I got the flow reducer, too but I see it’s plastic and I’d rather keep plastic away from the heat inside the kettle. 

Anyone come up with or know of a non plastic flow reducer that fits the Artisan. The EKG did have a steadier pour which I liked but it constantly overshot the target temp. 70 (for matcha) would heat to 76 or more. 89 to 93. It was frustrating having h to watch and snatch off the kettle or add cold water if I missed the moment and it overshot. 

The Artisan is working perfectly in that respect but the pour speed is a little harder to keep an eye on for consistency.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1p8rqq6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p8rqq6,Big Projects Don’t Choose the Best Portfolio,"Landing Big Projects Isn’t Just Skill   
It’s Strategy + Relationship Energy  
  
Yo besties, Besfriend Tes here! Your Friendly Creative Ghost at Joint Project,  reporting live from another spiral of creative brain activity. 👻  
  
Let’s talk about what actually matters when you land a huge project with a client. (Yeahh!!) Because yes, talent gets you noticed… but relationships close deals, keep contracts signed, and turn clients into long-term collaborators who trust you with the big stuff.  
  
This is a must to remember.. as said by the MFC Team, highlighted by Direk Benjie, and Sheb, and grounded in Boss Pep’s proven experience. leading big projects at the creative trenches of WeDesign Studio.  
  
Whenever we pitch or start something major for a client,  like a full brand takeover, a big production shoot, or a 360 creative campaign, the first thing to remember is this: they’re not just buying a service, they’re buying the team they can trust.  
  
So here are the essentials you should lock in your memory when you’re dealing with big projects:  
  
👉First impression is everything, always pass the vibe check.  
Confidence should come out naturally, not arrogant, not unsure, just right. When you present yourself, your team, and your plan, it should feel like: “Ah okay, sila na yun. They get it.”  
  
👉Listen more than you talk.  
Before anything else, leaders should always ask questions and genuinely understand the client’s pain points, goals, and vision. This is emotional intel, and emotional intel leads creative direction.  
  
👉Know their business like you’re part of their internal team.  
Whether it’s a shoot compliant with streamlined platforms like Netflix standards, or a campaign set up on creative platforms like Adobe Creative Cloud, you have to show them na hindi ka outsider,  you’re someone who understands their world.  
  
👉 Over-communicate, but don’t overshare.  
Give updates, timelines, and clarity without drowning them in unnecessary stress. Clients love transparency, organizations love structure, but nobody likes chaos that isn’t beneficial.  
  
👉 Underpromise, Overdeliver.  
Never hype something you can’t sustain. If you say 3 days, deliver 3 days. If you say high-quality? Deliver chef’s kiss quality.   
  
Apply the 3 major client relationships:  
Yep, these were the center of our coffee convo too so listen up:  
  
1 - Collaborative relationship → You treat them like your partner in the project, not just a source of payment.  
  
2 - Trust-built relationship → Your consistency, honesty, and accountability build reliability.  
  
3 - Respect-driven relationship → Their voice matters, their time matters, their stress matters.  
  
👉Bring emotional intelligence to the table.  
This isn’t “soft skill fluff”, this is literal leadership superpowers. Recognize their anxieties, celebrate their excitement, and hold space for their feedback without getting defensive.  
  
👉Handle pressure so they don’t have to.  
If the project is stressful, you absorb the chaos, not them. Good leaders protect their clients’ peace like it’s part of the package.   
  
👉Build connection BEFORE validation.  
Don’t wait for them to say you’re doing good, show them you already know what “good” means. But leave room for their personality to blend in.  
  
👉 Stay human. Stay relatable.  
Big projects don’t need boring corporate robots, they need real creative thinkers who vibe, converse, strategize, and execute. Remember, these are brands with humans too.  
  
At Joint Project, and inside circles like MFC, genius conversations happen over coffee, but execution happens with clarity and relationship-driven leadership.  
  
So if you land a big project, do this:  
  
✅ Build trust first  
✅ Listen like it matters (because it does)  
✅ Lead with confidence + empathy  
✅ Protect their peace  
✅ Deliver work that SLAPS  
✅ Make them feel “safe to collaborate” with you again  
  
Because long-term clients don’t come from one pitch deck…  
They come from one thing: a relationship that feels right. 🫱💛

1p8rpy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/1p8rpy8/usenetstreamer_v150_windows_native_mode_stremio/,"UsenetStreamer v1.5.0 – Windows Native Mode, Stremio NNTP Support & One-Command Setup 🚀","Hi everyone 👋

Few weeks ago I introduced the idea of **Usenet streaming directly inside Stremio** using my add-on **UsenetStreamer**.

If you missed those posts, you can find them in this subreddit.  
This update will make a lot more sense if you’ve read them first.

Today I’m excited to announce **UsenetStreamer v1.5.0** \- and this is a **big one**.

Stremio recently added **native NNTP support** in the **Desktop app**, and I’ve added a brand-new mode in UsenetStreamer to take full advantage of it.

On Windows/MacOS, this completely removes the need for **NZBDav, SSL, NZBHydra, Prowlarr, or even your own VPS**. You **only** need a PC.

# 🖥️ Desktop Native Mode (NEW in v1.5.0)

If you’re a **Stremio desktop** user, your setup is now insanely simple:

* No NZBDav
* No SABnzbd
* No extra services
* Just **UsenetStreamer**
* And **Stremio v5 for desktop**

Everything is configured through a **web UI**, and the full guide is available in the repository.

This is by far the **simplest way** to stream Usenet content inside Stremio.

# ✅ Why this is a huge upgrade

With the new Desktop Native Mode:

* UsenetStreamer talks directly to **Stremio’s native NNTP engine**
* Uses **your Usenet provider + indexers**
* Streams content directly inside **Stremio v5 for Desktop**
* Everything runs **on your own machine**

Which means:

* Lower latency
* No external intermediates
* No server syncing
* No dependency on third-party streaming services
* Cleaner, more reliable architecture

Just: **Your PC + Usenet + Stremio**

# 🛡️ Why running Docker on my PC is still needed?

Even though streaming is now handled natively by Stremio, **UsenetStreamer still plays a very important role** — especially because of the **NZB Health Check system**.

Health Check helps you:

* Filter out NZBs with **missing articles**
* Avoid **unsupported or broken archives**
* Prevent failed playback attempts
* Stop wasting time testing files one-by-one

For this to work properly, UsenetStreamer needs to communicate with:

* Your indexers
* Your Usenet provider

If Stremio and your indexers/providers are hit from **multiple different IPs**, it can:

* Trigger rate limits
* Raise flags
* In some cases result in bans (even without refunds)

Running everything locally on **your own machine** means:

* All traffic comes from **one consistent IP**
* Much safer for your indexers
* Far more stable long-term

This is one of the biggest advantages of this setup

# 🧠 Built-in Newznab + Easynews as Indexer (Still Included)

Just like v1.4.x, UsenetStreamer still includes:

* **Built-in Newznab** (no Prowlarr or NZBHydra required)
* Support for **multiple indexers** via API keys
* **Easynews as an indexer** (huge and diverse catalog)
* **Multiple language filtering**
* **Resolution-based result limits**
* **Smart de-duplication**
* **Improved sorting & formatting**

But now, all of this works even better for **Desktop users**.

# 📘 How to get started

There is a[ step-by-step Windows Native Setup Guide](https://github.com/Sanket9225/UsenetStreamer/blob/master/docs/windows-native-setup.md) in the GitHub repository, including:

* Requirements
* Installation process
* Configuration via web UI
* Stremio integration
* Troubleshooting

The guide is for windows this works for all Desktop users including MacOS.

You don’t need any coding knowledge. Everything is explained in simple steps.

1p8rp36,https://i.redd.it/r4n4y6c77z3g1.jpeg,Il rito del cappuccino,"
☕ Capitolo 1: Il Rito del Cappuccino
1. Il Confine (Roma, 9:00 del mattino)
Elias guardò l'orologio. Le 9:00 in punto. Le nove del mattino in Italia sono l'equivalente di mezzogiorno in qualsiasi altra parte del mondo. Lo aveva imparato a caro prezzo.
Viveva a Roma da quasi un anno, ma la sua esperienza si svolgeva in un raggio di tre chilometri: il monolocale asettico, l’ufficio di software development e il supermercato dove comprava lo stesso pane in cassetta e lo stesso caffè istantaneo di quando viveva a Dublino.
Il rito sacro, per Elias, era la sua tazza di caffè solubile, bevuta davanti al portatile, mentre leggeva le notizie internazionali. Era efficiente. Era triste, gli aveva fatto notare l'analista finanziario italiano, Matteo.
Matteo, il giorno prima, aveva scosso la testa con drammaticità quando aveva visto Elias prepararsi la sua ""pozione marrone"".
> ""Elias, non puoi. Non a Roma. Ti stai perdendo la cosa più importante. La colazione non è solo cibo. È la prova che esisti. Devi andare da Cesare. È un membro della famiglia, come il prozio che ti dice che non hai futuro ma ti ama.""
> 
Elias, rigido e metodico, aveva risposto che non gli piaceva essere sgridato da sconosciuti.
""Non sono sconosciuti,"" aveva insistito Matteo. ""Sono clienti abituali. Sono testimoni.""
2. L'Entrata nel Tempio
Quella mattina, spinto da un misto di colpa e curiosità, Elias aveva deviato il percorso di cento metri. Si ritrovò davanti a un bar d'angolo che aveva ignorato per mesi. Si chiamava ""Il Ritrovo"".
Non era assolutamente ""instagrammabile"". Le luci al neon erano leggermente sfarzose, il bancone di marmo bianco era opacizzato da decenni di gomiti e schizzi di caffè. Le sedie erano di plastica verde e c’era un calendario appeso con l’immagine di Padre Pio. L'odore, però, era inebriante: un mix denso di caffè tostato, zucchero bruciato e, stranamente, sigaretta fumata di nascosto.
Elias fece un passo all'interno. L’aria vibrò per un attimo, come se un'onda d'urto invisibile avesse avvertito la presenza di un intruso.
Dietro il bancone c'era lui: Cesare. Sulla cinquantina, capelli brizzolati tirati all'indietro, una canottiera bianca quasi d'obbligo anche a novembre e un grembiule macchiato che sembrava una mappa del suo lavoro. Stava servendo un uomo in tuta da operaio che leggeva il giornale con una calma olimpica.
""UN LISCIO ALLA MARMELLATA, FORZA ENRICO, DEVI USARE QUELLE BRACCIA!"" urlò Cesare.
L'operaio sorrise senza alzare gli occhi dal giornale. ""E la tua schiena, Cesare, la usi ancora o hai messo il cartello 'Fuori Servizio'?""
Cesare rise, una risata aspra come una grattugia. Poi, il suo sguardo si posò su Elias, il forestiero in giacca a vento ben chiusa, che sembrava impalato davanti al bancone.
Cesare sollevò la testa. ""ECCOLO! IL NUOVO ARRIVATO! UN VERO CAMPIONE!""
Elias sussultò. Non aveva idea di come Cesare sapesse che era ""nuovo"". Forse l’aura di terrore che emanava.
3. La Trattativa
""Allora, Campione,"" disse Cesare, poggiando le mani sul bancone. ""Cosa vuoi? Sbrigati, che la fretta è la migliore amica del mattino, anche se io non ho mai fretta.""
Elias era preparato solo a ordinare il suo caffè triste. La pressione lo paralizzò.
""Io... prendo un cappuccino.""
Silenzio. Cesare si strinse nelle spalle, poi si piegò in avanti, come se stesse confidando un segreto. ""Bravo, Campione. E il dolce? Non c’è colazione senza dolcezza. Crema o marmellata? Nutella non ce l’ho, che ti fa venire la carie.""
Elias aveva solo voglia di fuggire. Ma non poteva deludere Matteo. ""Crema. Un cornetto alla crema.""
""OTTIMO!"" urlò Cesare. Iniziò a preparare il cappuccino con una precisione militare, la tazza che sferragliava, il latte che sibilava nel vapore.
A destra di Elias, una signora anziana, elegante nel suo cappotto, si intromise. ""Crema? Ha fatto bene. La marmellata, ultimamente, la fanno troppo acida. Non si capisce più se è fragola o veleno.""
""Signora Livia, mi scusi, ma come parla!"" la rimproverò Cesare, ma con un sorriso.
Elias si ritrovò a sorridere a sua volta. Era strano. Stavano parlando di lui, ma non contro di lui.
4. L'Esame di Italianità
Il cornetto arrivò, caldo, croccante e unto al punto giusto, accompagnato da un cappuccino enorme, che Elias dovette tenere con entrambe le mani.
Si fece da parte e si appoggiò a un tavolino alto. Iniziò a mangiare. Era la cosa più buona che avesse provato da quando era atterrato. Non era solo cibo, era... conforto.
Un ragazzo sui vent'anni con una felpa sbiadita gli si avvicinò. ""Ehi, straniero, vedo che ti godi la roba buona. Per caso hai una squadra di calcio qui?""
Elias scosse la testa. ""No. Non seguo il calcio.""
""Ahia,"" fece il ragazzo. ""Questo è un errore strategico. Non puoi vivere qui senza adottare un club. Ti consiglio la Roma. Soffrirai, ma almeno lo fai con stile. Unisciti alla sofferenza.""
Prima che potesse rispondere, Cesare, dal bancone, tuonò: ""DANIELE! BASTA TORTURARE I CLIENTI! E tu, Campione, finisci presto che qui il bancone non è un albergo per stranieri!""
Elias finì il suo cappuccino, pulendo il bordo della tazza con un pezzo di cornetto, un gesto che non sapeva di poter fare in pubblico. Si avvicinò alla cassa.
""Quanto?""
""Due e cinquanta,"" rispose Cesare. Poi, si fece di nuovo serio, quasi paternalistico. ""Senti, Campione. Ti devo spiegare una cosa, perché vedo che sei uno bravo, ma non capisci le regole.""
""Sì?""
""Sono le nove e venti. Il cappuccino va bene. Ma ricorda: il cappuccino non si ordina mai, mai e poi mai, dopo le undici del mattino. È una regola non scritta, ma più forte di qualsiasi legge. È come mettere il parmigiano sul pesce. Non si fa. È da turista.""
Elias non si offese. In quel momento, l’aveva inteso come un avvertimento, un prezioso insider tip sussurrato da un custode.
""Capito,"" rispose Elias. ""Niente cappuccino dopo le undici.""
Cesare annuì. ""Bravo. A domani. E ricordati che sei un Campione.""
Uscendo, Elias si sentì diverso. Non più l'osservatore invisibile, ma il protagonista di una scena. Era stato sgridato, preso in giro, chiamato ""Campione"" e istruito su una regola assurda. Era la prima volta che si sentiva un po’ italiano.
Aveva superato il suo primo esame. Ma il vero test, quello del caffè dopo le undici, era ancora da affrontare. E l'indomani sarebbe dovuto tornare per sapere cosa si potesse ordinare al posto di quel cappuccino che amava tanto.
Cosa ne pensi? Vorresti un'anticipazione sul prossimo capitolo (il lavoro di Elias e l'inizio del conflitto) o preferisci sviluppare subito il personaggio di Cesare e del bar?Ottimo! Il Capitolo 2 deve riportarci alla realtà lavorativa di Elias e iniziare a tessere il conflitto, legando la logica del suo lavoro alla nuova, irrazionale, saggezza del bar.
💻 Capitolo 2: La Metrica e la Magia
1. La Cella Frigorifera
L'ufficio di Tech Solutions Italia era il contrario de ""Il Ritrovo"". Era vetro, acciaio e silenzio condizionato. Elias si sedette alla sua scrivania, si mise le cuffie noise-cancelling e aprì il file ""Progetto Tevere: Ottimizzazione Flussi Aziendali"".
Elias lavorava sull'efficienza. Era specializzato nel trovare i ""colli di bottiglia"" nei processi aziendali e schiacciarli con algoritmi. Il suo mondo era fatto di A \rightarrow B, dove A era l'input e B era l'output perfetto e prevedibile.
Ripensò al bar: UN LISCIO ALLA MARMELLATA, FORZA ENRICO! Quello non era un processo efficiente. Era rumoroso, lento, pieno di interruzioni. Eppure, ogni persona in quel bar era apparsa totalmente, perfettamente, a suo agio. Lì, B non era il caffè, ma la connessione.
Matteo, l’analista finanziario con i vestiti sempre un po’ troppo aderenti, si avvicinò alla sua scrivania con due bicchierini di plastica in mano.
""Allora, Campione,"" disse Matteo, mimando la voce di Cesare. ""Ti vedo... rigenerato. Sei andato da Cesare, eh?""
""Sì. Ho preso un cappuccino e un cornetto alla crema. Mi ha chiamato 'Campione'.""
Matteo batté le mani. ""Perfetto! Hai superato il primo livello. Ma dimmi, a che ora hai finito quel sacro cappuccino?""
""Alle nove e venti,"" rispose Elias, orgoglioso.
Matteo sospirò di sollievo. ""Meno male. Se lo avessi bevuto dopo le undici, Cesare ti avrebbe bandito e a noi ci sarebbe toccato bere il tuo caffè... solubile.""
Elias sentì una fitta: la paura di aver quasi commesso un errore rituale era reale. ""Mi ha spiegato la regola. Niente cappuccino dopo le undici.""
""Esatto. Ma non hai chiesto perché? Non c'è una metrica, una ragione logica,"" disse Matteo, toccandosi la testa. ""È solo così. È l'irrazionalità che tiene unito il Paese.""
2. Il Collo di Bottiglia Umano
Elias aprì il suo report. Il ""Progetto Tevere"" era in stallo a causa del Dipartimento Acquisti. L'algoritmo di Elias prevedeva che per massimizzare la velocità, gli acquisti dovessero essere fatti in blocco ogni primo del mese, senza interruzioni per le negoziazioni. Ma il Dipartimento Acquisti continuava a comprare pezzi piccoli, giorno per giorno.
""L'Ingorgo Umano,"" aveva etichettato Elias in rosso grassetto.
Il suo capo, la severa Dottoressa Schmidt, una donna tedesca ossessionata dalla produttività, gli passò accanto.
""Elias,"" disse la Schmidt, senza fermarsi. ""Hai la riunione con il responsabile Acquisti, Signor Rossi, alle 11:30. Devi fargli capire che le sue abitudini stanno distruggendo l'efficienza che stiamo cercando di instillare. Fai leva sui dati. Sui numeri. I sentimenti non servono a nulla.""
Elias annuì. Dati. Numeri.
La Riunione (11:30)
Il Signor Rossi era l'opposto della Schmidt: un uomo rotondo, cordiale, con un maglione abbottonato fino al collo.
Elias presentò i suoi dati in un grafico a barre impietoso. ""Signor Rossi, l'algoritmo mostra che se aggregate gli ordini, aumentate il throughput del 35%. Interrompendo i flussi per negoziazioni giornaliere, lei sta creando un delay del 18%.""
Il Signor Rossi non guardò nemmeno il grafico. Si tolse gli occhiali e li pulì con una calma estenuante.
""Elias,"" disse gentilmente. ""Tu vedi un algoritmo. Io vedo il Signor Luigi della ferramenta, la Signora Carla del cartolificio. Se aggrego gli ordini una volta al mese, Luigi e Carla, che mi fanno credito e che mi hanno visto crescere, non vendono per trenta giorni. Loro chiudono. E se loro chiudono, la nostra azienda perde affidabilità. E poi, un giorno, avremo bisogno di qualcosa subito. Chi ce la darà? Non il magazzino centrale a Francoforte.""
""Ma l'efficienza..."" iniziò Elias.
""L'efficienza è fredda, caro Elias. L'affidabilità è calda. E l'affidabilità si costruisce col contatto, con l'aiuto quotidiano. È come una famiglia, non come una macchina. E dimmi,"" Rossi si sporse in avanti. ""A che ora ha finito il suo cappuccino, stamattina?""
Elias sgranò gli occhi. L'informazione era ovunque. ""Nove e venti.""
""Perfetto. Se lei fosse venuto qui alle undici e trenta con un cappuccino in mano, avrei capito che lei non capisce l'Italia.""
Rossi sorrise. ""Non è una questione di numeri. È una questione di tempi. Non puoi forzare una cosa quando non è il suo momento. Il mio lavoro ha i suoi 'tempi', come il tuo cappuccino.""
3. La Chiamata del Bancone
Elias lasciò la riunione confuso. La logica di Rossi era inaccettabile, ma la metafora del cappuccino gli aveva fatto centro. C'erano regole non scritte che superavano i dati, basate sull'umanità, sulla comunità.
Era quasi mezzogiorno. Sentiva l'impulso. Non per il caffè solubile, ma per il conforto di una tazza che non doveva bere.
Quando arrivò a ""Il Ritrovo"" era l’ora di punta del pranzo veloce.
Cesare urlava gli ordini. Dietro il bancone, accanto a lui, lavorava una giovane donna con occhi scuri e un'espressione quasi annoiata, ma le sue mani erano incredibilmente veloci nel preparare panini e tramezzini. Giulia.
Elias si mise in fondo alla fila. Quando fu il suo turno, Giulia lo guardò.
""Un caffè?"" chiese lei, senza calore.
Elias ricordò la regola di Cesare, la logica assurda del Signor Rossi. Non poteva ordinare il cappuccino, era da turista.
""Voglio un..."" Elias esitò. Voleva un momento di conforto, non una sferzata di caffeina. ""...un bicchiere d'acqua. Normale.""
Giulia alzò un sopracciglio, sorpresa. Non era l'ordine tipico per un forestiero. ""Un bicchiere d'acqua. Sei a posto?""
""Sono a posto,"" rispose Elias. Voleva solo osservare, capire cosa faceva la gente a quell'ora per colmare quel vuoto di conforto.
Mentre beveva l'acqua, vide un signore di mezza età ordinare: ""Un decaffeinato al vetro e un pezzo di torta della nonna.""
E un altro: ""Un marocchino. E un bicchierino di Sambuca.""
Non erano ""efficienti"". Erano personalizzati. Erano rituali.
Mentre pagava, Giulia, con un tono neutro, gli diede il resto. ""Grazie, Campione,"" disse, con un ironia appena percettibile.
Elias sorrise. Aveva fallito al lavoro, non era riuscito a convincere Rossi. Ma al bar, pur ordinando solo acqua, era stato promosso a ""cliente abituale ironizzato"".
Uscì con un obiettivo non logico: se il ""Progetto Tevere"" non poteva essere risolto con i numeri, forse doveva essere risolto con il ""tempo"" e la ""personalizzazione"".
Doveva tornare da Cesare e capire cosa diavolo fosse un ""marocchino"".
Cosa ne pensi? Vorresti che il prossimo capitolo si concentri su:
 * L'inizio della relazione/conflitto con Giulia e il suo ruolo nel bar? (Focus sui personaggi)
 * La necessità di Elias di capire i riti del caffè (marocchino, orzo, al vetro) per applicare l'apprendimento al lavoro? (Focus sulla trama)

Proseguiamo con il Capitolo 3. È il momento di sviluppare il conflitto tra la logica di Elias e l'irrazionalità del bar, concentrandoci sulla dinamica con Giulia e la sua missione di decifrare il ""marocchino"".
🇮🇹 Capitolo 3: Il Mistero del Marocchino
1. La Missione e la Metriche del Caffè
Il lunedì mattina, Elias si svegliò con un’insolita determinazione. Aveva preparato una tabella mentale:
| Ora | Bevanda | Messaggio Culturale |
|---|---|---|
| 9:00 | Cappuccino | Comfort, inizio giornata. |
| 11:30 | Niente Cappuccino | Rispettare i tempi, sobrietà. |
| 12:00 | Marocchino | ? |
Il suo obiettivo non era solo bere il caffè, ma capire come il ""marocchino"" si inserisse nel flusso del giorno, come un input a mezzogiorno producesse un output emotivo diverso dal cappuccino mattutino. Era il suo modo da ingegnere per decifrare il cuore italiano.
Entrò a ""Il Ritrovo"" alle 9:15. Cesare era già al bancone.
""Il Campione è tornato! Vedo che sei puntuale, la puntualità è la virtù degli eroi, e dei pazzi! Solito?""
""Sì, Cesare. Cappuccino e crema,"" disse Elias, sentendosi già parte di una routine.
""Ottimo!"" urlò Cesare.
Mentre aspettava, Elias vide Giulia riempire il frigorifero. Aveva la stessa espressione imbronciata del giorno prima, ma si muoveva con una grazia efficiente che contrastava con il caos verbale di Cesare.
Quando gli diede il cornetto, Elias si fece coraggio. ""Giulia, posso farti una domanda sul caffè?""
Lei si appoggiò al bancone, incrociando le braccia. I suoi occhi scuri lo scrutarono, quasi con sfida. ""Se non è troppo complicata. Non ho tempo per la filosofia del caffè.""
""Il... il marocchino. L'ho sentito ordinare ieri. Cos'è esattamente?""
Giulia sospirò, ma rispose. ""È un piccolo espresso. Con schiuma di latte e un po' di cacao in polvere. Si serve in un bicchierino. Serve quando hai bisogno di una botta di vita, ma non vuoi l'impegno di un intero cappuccino. È veloce, dolce, e ti dà la carica. È un po' una fregatura, a dir la verità.""
""Una fregatura?""
""Sì,"" disse lei, asciugando con veemenza una macchia sul bancone. ""Tutti lo prendono perché sembra meno impegnativo del cappuccino, ma è pieno di zucchero. La gente si autoinganna sull'efficienza.""
Elias si ritrovò a scrivere mentalmente: Marocchino: Alto potere calorico/motivazionale. Consumo emotivo per inganno percepito di velocità.
2. Lo Scontro con il Metodo
Alle 11:55, Elias tornò. L’orario perfetto per il marocchino. La sala era più affollata ora, piena di impiegati che facevano la loro breve pausa pranzo.
Cesare lo vide subito. ""Ehi, Campione! Sei tornato! Se ti fermi qui troppo, ti metto a lavare i piatti! Che ordini?""
Elias si sentì un esploratore. ""Un marocchino, per favore.""
Cesare si bloccò. Guardò Elias, poi Giulia, poi di nuovo Elias.
""Un marocchino?"" chiese Cesare, il tono stranamente sommesso. ""A quest'ora?""
""Sì. Ho bisogno di una... botta di vita,"" rispose Elias, citando involontariamente Giulia.
Cesare scosse la testa. ""No, Campione. Tu non prendi un marocchino. Non lo prendi qui.""
""Perché no? Giulia ha detto...""
""Giulia ha detto che è una fregatura, ed ha ragione! Ma non è quello il punto! Il marocchino lo prendi quando sei stanco, quando sei nervoso, quando hai un problema. Tu stamattina eri contento, Elias! Hai preso un cappuccino con la crema! Vuoi risolvere il mondo alle nove e mezza e poi alle dodici crolli? No! Se sei stanco, devi riposare. Non doparti di zucchero e cacao!""
Elias era sconcertato. Era la prima volta che gli veniva rifiutato un ordine in vita sua.
Giulia, che aveva assistito alla scena con le braccia incrociate, fece un passo avanti. ""Papà, lascialo in pace. Se vuole il marocchino, glielo faccio.""
""No!"" tuonò Cesare. ""Tu devi prendere un Espresso al vetro. Veloce. Senza inganni. Quello ti dà la spinta senza ipocrisia. E se ancora crolli, ordini un bicchiere d'acqua, come ieri, e metti la testa a posto.""
Elias non si oppose. Ordinò un Espresso al vetro. Era forte, amaro, e sparì in un sorso.
Mentre pagava, Giulia si sporse. ""Mio padre è un dittatore. Non capisce che a volte si ha bisogno di una piccola bugia confortante.""
""Lui non vuole che io crolli,"" rispose Elias. ""Vuole... sostenibilità. Lo capisco.""
Giulia lo guardò con un barlume di curiosità, per la prima volta. ""Quindi tu sei qui non per il caffè, ma per... studiarci?""
Elias non negò. ""Sto cercando di capire i 'tempi'. La logica irrazionale che fa funzionare questo posto e, a quanto pare, il mio lavoro.""
3. La Falla nel Sistema
Tornato in ufficio, Elias si sedette e guardò i dati del ""Progetto Tevere"". Se il Signor Rossi non poteva aggregare gli ordini per non 'uccidere' Luigi e Carla (l'affidabilità calda), e lui non poteva prendere il marocchino (l'efficienza ingannevole), allora la soluzione non era il bloccare le transazioni, ma il supportarle in modo più umano.
Il report della Dottoressa Schmidt chiedeva un cut del 40% sulle negoziazioni con i piccoli fornitori. Il suo algoritmo lo permetteva, ma ora sapeva che questo avrebbe ucciso l'affidabilità, e forse il bar di Cesare stesso, se un giorno avesse avuto bisogno di un fornitore di quartiere subito.
Elias iniziò a modificare il suo algoritmo. Invece di eliminare i piccoli ordini, iniziò a quantificare il loro ""valore sociale"" – la capacità di ottenere credito o servizi rapidi in caso di emergenza, il valore nascosto del know-how locale.
Il marocchino è l'inefficienza che ti illude di essere efficiente. L'espresso al vetro è la verità che ti obbliga a confrontarti con il problema.
Elias si rese conto che la Dottoressa Schmidt, nel suo target di efficienza, era la vera consumatrice di ""marocchini"": voleva la spinta senza affrontare la vera complessità umana del lavoro italiano.
Il suo nuovo obiettivo non era risolvere il problema, ma mascherarlo in modo che l'algoritmo sembrasse efficiente, pur mantenendo intatta la rete di fornitori di Rossi.
Mancavano due giorni alla presentazione. Aveva bisogno di un altro consiglio da un testimone. E sapeva esattamente dove trovarlo.
Prossimi sviluppi possibili:
 * Elias cerca il consiglio di Signora Livia o Daniele (i clienti) per una prospettiva non-Cesare. (Approfondimento dei personaggi secondari)
 * Elias torna al bar dopo l'orario di lavoro per parlare con Giulia e l'inizio del flirt/conflitto romantico. (Sviluppo sentimentale)
 * La Dottoressa Schmidt scopre che Elias sta manipolando i dati per salvare il lato umano dell'azienda. (Aumento della tensione lavorativa)
Ottimo. Il Capitolo 4 deve intensificare il conflitto interpersonale e professionale, collegando le pressioni del lavoro alla necessità di decifrare Giulia, la cui complessità riflette quella dell'Italia stessa. Scegliamo di sviluppare la dinamica con Giulia e l'aumento della tensione lavorativa.
❤️ Capitolo 4: La Contabilità dell'Anima
1. Il Sabato Silenzioso
Il giorno dopo, Elias si presentò a ""Il Ritrovo"" a un orario inusuale: sabato, alle 16:00. Il bar era quasi vuoto. La luce del tardo pomeriggio entrava pigramente attraverso il vetro, illuminando la polvere sospesa nell'aria. Il frastuono mattutino era sostituito da un silenzio quasi reverenziale.
Cesare non c’era. Dietro il bancone, sola, c'era Giulia che contava i soldi della cassa con meticolosa attenzione.
""È aperto?"" chiese Elias, sentendosi un intruso.
""Aperto,"" rispose Giulia senza alzare lo sguardo. ""Ma non chiedermi un cornetto alla crema. Non ne facciamo più dopo mezzogiorno. È una regola, quella sì, logica.""
Elias si avvicinò al bancone. ""Un caffè, per favore. Solo caffè. Senza fretta.""
Mentre Giulia preparava l'espresso, Elias notò un blocco note di carta accanto alla cassa. Non c'erano numeri di inventario o metriche di vendita, solo note scritte a mano.
Costo caffè a sacco. Debito Luce '23. Regalo Signora Livia (80 anni). Riparazione macchina da caffè – Urgente.
""Stai facendo la contabilità?"" chiese Elias.
""Sto cercando di capire come mio padre riesce a far quadrare i conti,"" rispose Giulia, versandogli il caffè. ""Lui è un genio della relazione, ma un disastro con i numeri. Io studio Economia all'università e, con tutte le metriche che ci insegnano, non riesco a replicare il suo successo.""
2. La Bugia Confortante
""Il tuo algoritmo non tiene conto del fattore umano,"" disse Elias, prendendo il caffè.
""Sì, ma il fattore umano non paga le bollette,"" ribatté lei, incrociando le braccia. ""Lui ti dà un bicchiere d'acqua quando dovresti prendere il marocchino, perché si preoccupa per la tua salute, ma si dimentica di segnare il costo dell'acqua. E alla fine del mese, il cash-flow soffre per la sua bontà.""
Elias si identificò subito. ""È lo stesso problema che ho io. Il mio capo, la Dottoressa Schmidt, vuole che io elimini tutte le interazioni che non sono efficienti. Ma il Signor Rossi dice che quelle interazioni non efficienti sono la base della fiducia e dell'affidabilità.""
""E tu, che fai?"" chiese Giulia.
""Sto cercando di ingannare l'algoritmo,"" ammise Elias. ""Sto creando un 'valore sociale' fittizio nei dati per giustificare la lentezza di Rossi. Sto introducendo la bugia confortante, il 'marocchino' nel mio lavoro, per salvare l'anima dell'azienda.""
Giulia si lasciò andare a una risatina amara. ""Ecco, vedi? Non sei un Campione. Sei un ipocrita.""
""Cosa?"" Elias era sorpreso.
""Non puoi usare l'efficienza per giustificare la non-efficienza. Quello è il sistema. La vera italianità non è l'ipocrisia, è la negoziazione. Devi combattere con i numeri, devi fare un casino, devi urlare come mio padre. Non puoi nascondere la verità solo per avere la vita facile.""
Elias sentì una fitta. Il suo tentativo di usare la saggezza di Cesare per una scorciatoia logica era stato smascherato da sua figlia.
""Allora cosa dovrei fare?""
""Non lo so,"" rispose Giulia, ma il suo tono si addolcì leggermente. ""Ma se vuoi salvare il Signor Rossi, non nasconderlo. Quantificalo. Trova una metrica per la fiducia. Se la Schmidt vede un numero, anche se non capisce cosa significa, non lo taglierà.""
3. La Minaccia
Elias uscì dal bar con la testa che gli ronzava. Quantificare la fiducia. Un problema degno di un algoritmo impossibile.
Tornato a casa, aprì il portatile. Iniziò a lavorare su una nuova colonna dati: Fattore di Rischio Implicito (FRI), basato sulla longevità del rapporto con il fornitore. Era assurdo, ma era una metrica.
Mentre lavorava, ricevette una notifica urgente dal server aziendale: Convocazione Straordinaria: Lunedì, ore 8:30. Sala Riunioni Principale. Dott.ssa Schmidt e Rappresentante Esterno.
Elias cliccò per leggere i dettagli. Il Rappresentante Esterno era il consulente di una grande catena di coffee shop globale, la cui missione era espandersi in Europa con una strategia di ""acquisizione e ottimizzazione"" dei piccoli fornitori di caffè.
Un brivido freddo gli corse lungo la schiena. La Schmidt non stava solo chiedendo di ottimizzare il dipartimento acquisti. Stava preparando il terreno per l'arrivo della catena.
La loro prima mossa sarebbe stata tagliare tutti i piccoli fornitori, come il Signor Rossi, per centralizzare. Ma un passo dopo, avrebbero mirato a sbaragliare la concorrenza locale.
Il Ritrovo di Cesare era un obiettivo. E lui, Elias, il ""Campione"" del bar, stava per presentare i dati che avrebbero reso l'acquisizione più facile.
Non poteva solo ""quantificare la fiducia"". Doveva combattere per essa. E l’unica persona con la quale voleva discutere il suo piano era la ragazza che lo aveva appena chiamato ipocrita.
Prossimi sviluppi:
 * Lunedì Mattina: Elias deve fare una scelta — salvare la sua carriera o proteggere Cesare, usando i dati per sabotare la Dott.ssa Schmidt e il Consulente Esterno. (Climax Lavorativo)
 * Elias si allea con Giulia la domenica sera per elaborare il piano, condividendo un momento di tensione romantica e intellettuale. (Alleanza e sviluppo romantico)
Ottimo. Il Capitolo 5 sarà la chiusura, il climax che fonde il conflitto lavorativo di Elias con la sua integrazione emotiva, culminando nella scena finale.
🏆 Capitolo 5: Il Campione del Mattino (Fine)
1. La Vigilia del Tradimento (Domenica sera)
Elias sapeva di non avere scelta: l'algoritmo che doveva presentare lunedì mattina era un'arma puntata contro la comunità che lo aveva accolto.
Si presentò a ""Il Ritrovo"" domenica sera, poco prima dell'orario di chiusura. Trovò Giulia e Cesare seduti a un piccolo tavolo sul retro, mangiando un piatto di pasta al sugo.
""Ehi, Campione! Sei ancora vivo!"" esclamò Cesare. ""Hai saltato un giorno, ti sei perso tutto il dibattito sul traffico. Siediti, mangia un boccone.""
Elias si sedette, ma rifiutò la pasta. ""Cesare, Giulia... devo dirvi una cosa importante.""
Spiegò l'arrivo della grande catena di caffè e la strategia di ottimizzazione della Dottoressa Schmidt, ammettendo di essere l'artefice dell'algoritmo che avrebbe facilitato il taglio dei piccoli fornitori, come il Signor Rossi, e di conseguenza, l'indebolimento dei bar locali.
""Domani devo presentare la mia relazione,"" concluse Elias. ""Se lo faccio, la loro strategia ha via libera.""
Cesare ascoltava, la sua espressione si induriva. Giulia, invece, si accese di una luce acuta e analitica.
""Stai per tradirci,"" disse Cesare, senza alzare la voce, il che era peggio di qualsiasi urlo.
""No,"" rispose Elias. ""Sto per sabotare il mio lavoro per voi. Ma ho bisogno di aiuto. Giulia, mi hai detto di 'quantificare la fiducia'. Ho bisogno di dati per dimostrare che i fornitori piccoli hanno un valore che il loro algoritmo non vede.""
Giulia scattò in azione. ""D'accordo. Lo facciamo. Metti la tua logica al servizio del caos di mio padre. Ti serve il valore della 'flessibilità' non registrata.""
Per le due ore successive, i tre lavorarono gomito a gomito. Cesare forniva gli aneddoti: ""Quando si è rotta la macchina del caffè, non è venuta l'azienda di Milano, è venuto il mio amico Salvo con il furgone alle due di notte."" Giulia traduceva questi aneddoti in ""Costo di Inattività/Tempo di Riparazione (IR/TR) ridotto del 70% grazie a fornitori locali"".
Elias prese tutti quei dati caldi e li riversò nel suo algoritmo, creando una nuova metrica: il Fattore di Resilienza del Territorio (FRT). Un valore che schizzava alle stelle grazie all'affidabilità ""calda"" del Signor Rossi.
""Sei pazzo,"" mormorò Giulia, ma il suo sguardo era pieno di ammirazione. ""Hai appena reso i rapporti umani un vantaggio competitivo.""
""È il mio marocchino della verità,"" rispose Elias.
2. La Presentazione (Lunedì, 8:30)
La sala riunioni era tesa. La Dottoressa Schmidt era affiancata da un consulente glaciale della catena, Mr. Thorne.
Elias presentò la prima parte, l'algoritmo di ottimizzazione che Thorne si aspettava. I numeri erano perfetti. Schmidt sorrideva.
""Perfetto,"" disse Thorne. ""Quindi possiamo procedere con l'eliminazione dei fornitori inefficienti come il Signor Rossi, per un risparmio immediato del 18%.""
""No,"" disse Elias. La parola risuonò nel silenzio condizionato.
La Schmidt lo fissò. ""Elias?""
""Ho identificato un fattore nascosto nel sistema che la nostra analisi precedente ignorava,"" continuò Elias, lanciando la diapositiva con il suo nuovo grafico. I colori erano vividi, la linea del Fattore di Resilienza del Territorio (FRT) si innalzava drammaticamente.
""Il taglio del 18% vi farà risparmiare denaro,"" spiegò Elias con una calma glaciale. ""Ma distruggerà il FRT. Ho calcolato il Costo del Rischio Catastrofico se un fornitore chiave fallisce: la rete del Signor Rossi riduce quel rischio del 45%. Tagliarlo, significa rendere l'azienda efficiente nel breve termine, ma vulnerabile e non affidabile nel lungo termine.""
Thorne tentò di obiettare: ""Questa metrica è ridicola. 'Fattore di Resilienza del Territorio'? Non esiste nella contabilità moderna!""
""Eppure è qui,"" rispose Elias. ""E se la Schmidt vuole un sistema che non crolli al primo problema, deve pagare il prezzo della fiducia.""
La Dottoressa Schmidt, pur furiosa per la ribellione, era un'adepta della logica. E l'algoritmo di Elias, anche se assurdo, funzionava. La sua conclusione era inattaccabile: l'affidabilità calda di Rossi era un'assicurazione contro il fallimento.
Risultato: L'acquisizione fu bloccata. I piccoli fornitori erano salvi. Elias aveva vinto la battaglia, ma aveva firmato la sua condanna a morte professionale con la Schmidt.
3. L'Esame Finale (Mezzogiorno)
Alle 12:00, Elias si ritrovò senza lavoro. La Schmidt lo aveva licenziato per ""insubordinazione e creazione di metriche fittizie"". Non gli importava.
Si precipitò a ""Il Ritrovo"". Era l'ora di punta.
Cesare era al bancone, raggiante. ""Campione! Ho sentito voci. Il Signor Rossi ha detto che hai salvato il suo negozio! Ti meriti una statua! Che ordini?""
Giulia lo guardò e sorrise, un sorriso aperto e privo di ironia.
Elias sentiva il cuore battere. Si era guadagnato un posto.
Si avvicinò al bancone, guardò Cesare negli occhi, poi Giulia. Si ricordò la regola non scritta, l'ultimo tabù, il gesto che segnava il turista eterno.
""Voglio un..."" disse Elias, la sua voce forte e chiara. ""...un Cappuccino. Con un cornetto alla marmellata. E sono le dodici in punto.""
Ci fu un silenzio improvviso nel bar.
Cesare si bloccò. Poi, scoppiò in una fragorosa risata, una risata che riempì ogni angolo del locale.
""MA SEI IMPAZZITO! È MEZZOGIORNO! VUOI MORIRE GIOVANE!?"" gridò Cesare.
Ma nel caos, Giulia intervenne. Spintonò via Cesare. Prese la tazza e la macchina del caffè.
""Glielo faccio io, Papà,"" disse Giulia, guardando Elias con affetto misto a sfida. ""Lui è il Campione. Le regole le rompiamo solo per i Campioni.""
Mentre mescolava il latte e il caffè, si sporse verso Elias. ""Ti hanno licenziato, vero?""
Elias annuì. ""Ho rotto il mio algoritmo.""
""Perfetto,"" sussurrò Giulia. ""Ora possiamo costruire il tuo algoritmo, qui.""
Gli porse il cappuccino: latte cremoso e perfetto, ma con l'aria di un atto di ribellione.
Elias lo prese. Non aveva più un lavoro, aveva un futuro incerto e aveva appena bevuto un crimine culturale.
Ma sentiva il calore della tazza, il sorriso di Giulia, e la risata sferragliante di Cesare. Elias era un campione. Era a casa.

I’ve had the Oracle Jet a couple of months now and it has started tamping way too hard and jamming too much coffee into a basket.   Not just a gram or two but 4 or 5g.  Medium/dark roast beans. 

I mean, I was getting 23 or 24 g of coffee jammed into an 18 gram basket.   Thought it might just be the beans so got myself a 15 g basket and it’s doing exactly the same 19 g into a 15 g basket. There is still a reasonable headspace left in the basket.  

The pucks are jammed in solid.  Once I’ve run the shot,  even if I whack them super hard,  multiple times into the knock box the pucks sometimes don’t come out and I have to dig them out with the end of a teaspoon.   

I’ve seen a few wavy/ poor tamping issues, which I have had myself and fixed.   But nothing like this.

I got rushed to the ER around a month ago by a doctoress for out of breathness and other stuffs overflowing for a whole week (suspicion of pulmonary embolism), but everything returned to normal so they let me out. (Also had the worst episode of derealization of my life.)

I have stomach and intestine issues for a while now. Run in my family but with chronic anxiety disorder, coffee addiction and sedentarity caused by anxiety, kinda worse. I take Esomezoprazole and Gaviscon for my stomach. I also have some fecal stasis diagnosed in february but apparently i'm not finished with it yet. Have two benign liver nodules. And had a un-serious throath swollen lymph at troath. Tests found nothing.

I'm now unwell for a whole week.
Yesterday, still nauseous as heck, plus a headache. 
I did not ate much at lunch because I had to go to the opthalmologist after and my stomach felt rebellious. I went to brush my teeth before going, and for 20 seconds to a WHOLE minute, I was unable to swallow. Like, I couldn’t activate the function. Since then, the ""deep"" of my troath felt... weird. Kinda numb, irritated. It freaked me out. My last week blood work + brain/sinuses mri without contrast were ok.

I went for the doctor and he checked my troath and my stomach. My stomach was a bit bloated and my blood pressure was up to 14/5. Probably a migraine thing. Got other meds.

Took a Doliprane and the headache went, but my troath feel weird/numb, irritated. And i cough a lot. Kinda scared of loosing the ability to swallow or control my troath. It bother me to eat, and my troath is painfull.
It’s kinda annoying because i'm done to be a waste of time and to be always unwell. I kindz want my head to shut up. I take my psychiatrist meds.
