This took about 10 minutes. I finished around 9am and went to join my work mates in the cleaning. They haven't started yet and have been talking the whole time. Anyway we cleaned  2 units and I decided to put away the linen while they started on unit 3 as it just got here and there was a lot. This did take me a while when I finished assuming the others would have made some progress in cleaning. I walk over to the unit there in(the same one as before) and there sitting on the couch drinking coffee and watching TV. This did annoy me bc yes we are entitled to a break but they had this break without me and stopped the break as soon as I got back so I did not get one. I then leave again to restock the storeroom. I then see them outside the window looking at one of the girls' cars while on the clock instead of working. This is the 2nd time I've been working while they have had a break. I finished that and we all finished the same unit they were in like 40 minutes ago. We then start on the next one I clean the kitchen while they make one of the beds they finish the bed as im finishing the kitchen and move onto the next bed( single bed one person can do it easily but they were doing it together).I then got a text from my boss telling me to open some boxes and fill out the packing slips which I immediately go and do bc tbh I dont want be around them bc there making me do most the work. I spent a good while doing what my boss asked and redoing the stock list to account for the stuff that were in the boxes I get back to the unit and there still on the same single bed just finishing it. Atp im honestly fed up and just start stocking peppers and salts and stuff like that while they start on the next unit. I get asked if I can start on unit 9 when I'm just done (the biggest unit) and they will be there soon. As I get there and am finishing a bed I see one of them leave and drive away. im obviously like wtf so I finish the bed im on and go to find the other girl to ask where she went. She said she was going to get a drink and food. tbh i don't say anything and walk away. I keep working alone. im on the last bed when the other girl gets back she then proceeds to sit down with the other girl and eat together right outside the unit im working on (she bought food for the other person working there but not for me(idm but damn atleast offer) and then sit there eating while im working. atp im pissed off. they have had 3 breaks all when iv been working and they have been doing nothing keep in mind i havnt had a single break the entire shift (we are entitled to one and only one per shift). I'm almost done with the kitchen and they get up but then go straight to one of their boyfriends who stopped by atp im fed up so I finish the kitchen and when they come back in I say im going now anything you need on my way out? and I get them some body wash refills and then go.** edit: im 18 and my co-workers are 25 to 30,0,1770878854.0,AmItheAsshole,2,0.5,False

Need some guidance please. 



I'm wanting to create a Guest WiFi hotspot on my Slate AX that has a captive portal. My Slate AX is running the latest firmware 4.8.2 (release 5). The idea is to mimic a ""hotel/coffee shop"" WiFi whereby someone has to accept T's & C's before gaining access to the Internet (if possible, this would apply to wired ethernet on the Slate as well). 

  
My Google-fu is failing me and I only get ""captive portal"" documentation from GL.iNet for version 3.x and not 4.x.

  
I would ideally like the captive portal to only apply to the Guest WiFi or a specific LAN port, and not the regular WiFi networks that the Slate AX broadcasts.

I saw there was an application called ""NoDogSplash"", but not sure if there was something else?

  
As a side note, where do I find documentation to create an application for GL.inet devices?

My chest is in a lot of pain still and constantly thumping.

Any natural remedies, vitamins, or techniques that have helped any of you?

I’ve been drinking a lot of hot tea (peppermint,chamomile, triple mint, ginger) and trying to limit my morning coffee so far & take walks.

Asian markets surged to record highs with Japan's Nikkei breaking through 58,000 for the first time and South Korea's KOSPI hitting an all-time peak on chipmaker strength, extending the ""Takaichi trade"" rally. U.S. markets closed mixed after blowout jobs data pushed Treasury yields higher and dimmed Fed rate-cut expectations, with the Dow halting its three-day win streak. Applied Materials agreed to a $252 million settlement with the Commerce Department over illegal chip equipment exports to China—the largest such fine in recent memory and a stark warning to the semiconductor industry. After-hours earnings diverged sharply: Cisco Systems fell 3% on disappointing gross margins despite raising annual guidance, while medical device maker Novocure soared 30% on FDA approval for its pancreatic cancer treatment device. Corporate realignments dominated headlines with Elon Musk overhauling xAI's management ahead of a blockbuster IPO (post-SpaceX merger), Bill Ackman's Pershing Square taking a sizable new Meta stake while exiting Hilton, and Kraft Heinz's continued fallout from its split reversal.

## Thematic Analysis

### Asian Market Strength vs. U.S. Caution (4 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bullish for Asia, neutral for U.S.
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * Nikkei surges past 58,000; KOSPI hits record high
    * Asian stocks reach record on U.S. jobs data, chipmaker gains
    * Lenovo posts record Q3 revenue on AI surge
    * ANZ shares hit record high on strong Q1 earnings
  * **Analysis:** Japan's Nikkei breaking through the 58,000 barrier for the first time extends the ""Takaichi trade"" rally—named after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's pro-growth policies including corporate tax cuts, deregulation, and monetary easing coordination. South Korea's KOSPI simultaneously hitting all-time highs reflects strength in Samsung and SK Hynix as both chip giants capture dominant positions in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) critical for AI training. The Asian momentum contrasts with U.S. market hesitation after blowout jobs data dimmed Fed rate-cut expectations, suggesting global equity leadership may be rotating toward Asia-Pacific markets. Australian banks (CBA earlier, now ANZ) posting record results and Lenovo's AI-driven revenue surge demonstrate broad-based strength across the region. The divergence reflects different monetary policy trajectories—U.S. facing prolonged higher rates while Asian central banks maintain accommodative stances—and relative valuation gaps as Asian equities trade at discounts to U.S. multiples.
  * **Implication:** Geographic rotation underway; investors should consider increasing Asia-Pacific exposure while U.S. rate environment remains restrictive; Japan's structural reforms and Korea's AI chip dominance provide fundamental support beyond momentum.



### Semiconductor Export Enforcement Escalation (3 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bearish for compliance risk, neutral for strategic positioning
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * Applied Materials fined $252 million for illegal China chip exports
    * US lawmakers push to curb China's access to chipmaking tools
    * Pentagon pressures AI companies to expand on classified networks
  * **Analysis:** Applied Materials' $252 million settlement with the Commerce Department represents the largest semiconductor equipment export violation penalty in recent memory and sends an unambiguous message that the government will aggressively prosecute compliance failures. The fine stems from AMAT shipping restricted chip-making tools to China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) without proper licenses during 2021-2023. Congressional pressure for even stricter controls on chipmaking equipment exports—targeting Applied Materials, Lam Research, ASML, and others—suggests enforcement will tighten further. Simultaneously, the Pentagon pushing OpenAI and Anthropic to deploy AI models on classified defense networks demonstrates government recognition that AI represents strategic national security infrastructure requiring indigenous capabilities. The pattern clear: U.S. authorities escalating tech decoupling through both ex-post penalties (AMAT fine) and ex-ante restrictions (tighter export controls), forcing semiconductor and AI companies into difficult compliance balancing acts as China remains significant revenue source.
  * **Implication:** Semiconductor equipment makers face elevated regulatory risk; compliance costs rising; investors should price in potential future penalties and China revenue erosion as restrictions tighten; defense/intelligence AI applications emerging as new growth vertical.



### AI Disruption Fears Hit Traditional Industries (4 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bearish for incumbents
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * Zillow -20% on weak forecast; AI fears crater real estate stocks
    * Cushman & Wakefield -14% as AI disruption concerns hit commercial brokers
    * Anthropic researcher warns ""world is in peril"" as Claude disrupts stock markets
    * UK wealth managers dip as AI tax tool sparks adviser debate
  * **Analysis:** Real estate technology and brokerage stocks experienced their worst day in years as investors reassessed how generative AI might eliminate intermediaries from property transactions. Zillow's 20% plunge (steepest since 2021) on weak guidance triggered contagion across the sector with Cushman & Wakefield plummeting 14% and Jones Lang LaSalle sliding as analysts questioned whether AI-powered search and virtual tours render traditional brokers obsolete. The pattern mirrors earlier wealth management selloffs when AI tax advisory tools threatened financial advisers' value propositions. Anthropic researcher's stark warning that ""world is in peril"" from AI disruption—issued even as the company's Claude model drives the selloff—reflects growing recognition that frontier AI capabilities threaten knowledge worker roles previously considered automation-resistant. The speed and severity of these sector-specific crashes suggests investors are beginning to seriously price in AI displacement scenarios rather than dismissing them as distant theoretical risks.
  * **Implication:** Traditional service industries with high-margin intermediary business models face existential AI threats; companies must demonstrate technological adaptation or face valuation compression; defensive moats eroding faster than previously anticipated.



### Corporate Realignment Transactions (5 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Mixed
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * Musk reorganizes xAI after SpaceX merger, ahead of blockbuster IPO
    * Ackman's Pershing Square bets on Meta, exits Hilton
    * Baker Hughes explores $1.5B sale of Waygate Technologies unit
    * Meta begins construction of $10B Indiana data center
    * Waldorf Astoria's Chinese owners plan to sell iconic NYC hotel
  * **Analysis:** Major corporate restructuring activity accelerated with Elon Musk overhauling xAI's management following its merger with SpaceX and ahead of what's expected to be a blockbuster IPO—potentially the largest tech offering since Facebook. Two co-founders' departures (Tony Wu, Jimmy Ba) suggest internal tensions but also Musk's pattern of centralizing control before major liquidity events. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square disclosed a new sizable stake in Meta while exiting Hilton—a rotation signaling confidence in Meta's AI strategy while acknowledging weakness in budget consumer travel. Baker Hughes exploring a $1.5 billion sale of its Waygate inspection technologies business reflects oilfield services firms divesting non-core assets to focus on energy transition. Meta breaking ground on a $10 billion Indiana data center underscores AI infrastructure arms race intensity. China's Anbang Insurance preparing to sell New York's iconic Waldorf Astoria (purchased for $1.95B in 2014) represents continued unwinding of Chinese overseas trophy asset acquisitions from the 2010s era of capital outflows.
  * **Implication:** Heightened M&A and restructuring activity signals management teams repositioning for next economic cycle; Meta/xAI AI infrastructure spending validates continued capital intensity; Chinese asset disposals reflect ongoing deleveraging and capital repatriation.



### Late-Cycle Consumer Bifurcation (3 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bearish for budget segment
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * Hilton forecasts weak room revenue as budget travel softens
    * McDonald's beats quarterly sales as value bets pay off
    * U.S. firms confront widening income gulf: wealthy spend, budget shoppers struggle
  * **Analysis:** Stark evidence of consumer bifurcation emerged with Hilton's disappointing 2026 room revenue guidance citing softness in budget/economy segments even as luxury properties remain strong. The pattern mirrors McDonald's quarterly beat which came entirely from value menu promotions attracting price-sensitive customers trading down from casual dining. Analysis of recent earnings calls reveals corporate America confronting a widening income-based spending divide: affluent consumers (top 20% by income) maintaining robust discretionary spending on travel, dining, luxury goods, while middle and lower-income households pulling back on non-essentials amid persistent cost-of-living pressures despite strong employment. Credit card data shows rising delinquencies in subprime segments while prime borrowers increase spending. This late-cycle dynamic typical as rising prices erode purchasing power for lower-income cohorts despite wage growth, while wealthier households benefit from asset appreciation (stocks, real estate) and have savings buffers.
  * **Implication:** Investors should favor companies with premium positioning or value-focused strategies; avoid middle-market discretionary categories; late-cycle bifurcation suggests economic expansion aging but not yet ending as high-income spending sustains growth.



### EY Audit Crisis and Professional Services Scrutiny (2 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bearish
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * Four EY partners leave following potential breaches in Shell audit
    * Australia's ASX sees 2026 costs soar amid CEO exit, regulatory probe
  * **Analysis:** Ernst & Young suffering another major audit quality scandal with four partners departing following potential breaches in its Shell audit—adding to the firm's troubled track record including Wirecard, NMC Health, and Luckin Coffee failures. The Financial Times report suggests independence violations potentially compromising auditor objectivity. Separately, Australia's stock exchange operator ASX warned of sharply higher 2026 costs as CEO exits amid regulatory investigation into its failed CHESS blockchain replacement project. Both stories highlight intensifying scrutiny of professional services firms' quality controls and governance as regulators reassess whether Big Four audit oligopoly structure creates moral hazard. The pattern suggests potential for regulatory reforms requiring audit firm breakups or mandatory rotation—ideas previously floated after accounting scandals but gaining renewed momentum.
  * **Implication:** Professional services firms face reputational and regulatory risks; audit quality concerns could drive client moves; potential for structural reforms to industry if scandals continue.



* * *

## Market Implications

Asian equity markets' surge to record highs—Nikkei breaking 58,000, KOSPI at all-time peaks—signals potential leadership rotation away from expensive U.S. equities toward regions offering better valuations, accommodative monetary policy, and structural growth drivers like Japan's corporate reforms and Korea's AI chip dominance. The divergence particularly striking given U.S. markets closed mixed after blowout jobs data, with strong employment paradoxically negative for equities by reducing Fed rate-cut probability. Investors should consider geographic reallocation toward Asia-Pacific as U.S. rate environment remains restrictive.

Applied Materials' $252 million China export violation fine represents watershed moment for semiconductor industry compliance, signaling Commerce Department will aggressively prosecute violations with massive penalties rather than warnings. The settlement—largest such fine in recent memory—comes as congressional pressure mounts for even stricter chipmaking equipment export controls targeting AMAT, Lam Research, and ASML. Equipment makers face dual pressures: China revenue erosion from tightening restrictions plus elevated compliance costs and penalty risks. Investors must price in both lower addressable markets and potential future fines as U.S.-China tech decoupling accelerates.

AI disruption fears triggered the worst day for real estate and brokerage stocks in years, with Zillow plummeting 20% and Cushman & Wakefield cratering 14% as investors reassessed how generative AI eliminates need for intermediaries in property search and transactions. The pattern mirrors earlier wealth management selloffs on AI tax tools and suggests markets beginning to seriously price in white-collar job displacement beyond theoretical scenarios. Traditional service industries with high-margin intermediary models face existential threats requiring rapid technological adaptation or accepting significant valuation compression. The speed and severity of these sector crashes indicates AI disruption timeline shorter than many anticipated.

After-hours earnings divergence—Cisco falling 3% on margin disappointment despite raised guidance while Novocure soared 30% on FDA pancreatic cancer device approval—highlights stock-picking importance in current environment. Cisco's gross margin miss reflects brutal competitive dynamics in enterprise networking as hyperscalers negotiate aggressively despite strong AI infrastructure demand, raising questions about hardware vendors' ability to monetize the AI buildout. Meanwhile, Novocure's tumor-treating fields FDA win expands addressable market dramatically and validates medical device innovation pipeline. Investors should focus on companies with pricing power, regulatory catalysts, and differentiated technology rather than riding broad sector momentum.

Corporate realignment activity intensified with Musk overhauling xAI management ahead of blockbuster IPO, Ackman rotating from Hilton into Meta, and Baker Hughes exploring asset sales. The transactions suggest management teams repositioning for the next cycle: Musk centralizing control before major liquidity event, Ackman rotating from weakening consumer discretionary into recovering big tech, industrial firms divesting non-core assets. Meanwhile, Meta's $10 billion Indiana data center groundbreaking underscores AI infrastructure arms race intensity and continued capital expenditure requirements that favor hyperscalers over smaller competitors lacking balance sheet capacity for multi-billion dollar buildouts.

We move often due to my husband’s job and he travels often as well, so most of the time it’s just me and her. I take her everywhere with me (that I can) and she is my whole world. I love our routines, our bond, and just the special relationship the two of us share. 

Long story short, my husband rescued a puppy from a bad situation with the intent of fostering him until we could find a new home for him. Well, my husband wants to keep him. 

Like I mentioned before, because of his travel and because I work from home and he does not, I will end up taking care of the dog majority of the time. That isn’t the issue. I love this sweet puppy already, but I can’t help feeling a nag about just how much my relationship with my dog will change. Not only the emotional side of things, but routine things like coffee shop visits become instantly more difficult with two dogs. I don’t want either of us to miss out on those things together with another dog. 

I think my dog will be fine either way. She likes playing with the puppy but also loves just hanging out on her own with me. She is 6.

My wife wife's province is just a small village less than 200 people. very remote island. no water supply so all containers are brought in. daily life on the island is very simple, get up, have a wash, make a coffee. have a seat on the beach with the other chaps who are drinking coffee and having a chat and back to house. make lunch then asleep for a few hours.

when we get up we normally make a coffee and then have a walk around just visiting people or sitting on the beach. then come evening time we either chat or have a sing and that is basically a normal day for us when we are on at my wifes beg. 

mainland where we are building is a little bit different because we can pop on to a bus and visit the local town if we wish. but here we have a wet market and light the island. so we visit that every morning and basically rinse and repeat what we do on the island. 

we have a place in Manila and again it's very similar. we are not ones to go out and eat everyday. we live a very simple life. 

obviously we got two more things like see relatives and our children visit us but in general I thought our routine is pretty much the same. in the province though we do take part in the fiestas and festivals which is fun and we do have outings. some involve quite a long trip by boats and others are just simply visiting small beaches along the islands and having a get-together.",1,1770878629.0,TruePhilippinesExpats,0,1.0,False

The highlight of my visit was definitely their filter coffee. The aroma was strong, the taste was smooth yet bold, and the presentation was traditional. You can feel the authenticity in every sip.

Kaapfi 90’s is perfect for students, professionals, and coffee enthusiasts who want something different from regular coffee shops in Nagpur.

First post here, when i was looking into these perfumes I had some trouble finding reviews on these perfume oils, and I thought I'd at least write up something to help other curious souls. My nose is very inexperienced and untrained so take all my opinions with a grain of salt!
All of these have been put onto a paper strip for smelling, and allowed to dry/evaporate as much as an oil on paper does. I will also be trying on some that intrigue me for a day. I also will come back and add edits if I feel a scent changed in a notable way.
Without anymore chatter, onto the review!

~ Absinthe (Anise, sugar, juniper, spices,                  
citrus,  wormwood, and black currant)
I found this scent fairly accurate description wise. The anise is definitely there and the wormwood adds a spice, its slightly floral-fruity, and not super sweet. The scent leans more masculine in profile.

~Ancient Ritual (Frankincense, myrrh, and smoke) 
Im not sure I've ever smelled frankincense or myrrh before, but to me it smells like clean dove soap, and then the clean almost spiced campfire smoke. This is a very neutral scent to me, and the smoke stands out the most.

~Canopic (Egyptian musk) 
This smells slightly soap like, but heavier with almost a tinge of insence like depth. The scent is very interesting to me, its unique in the way im not sure I've smelt something quite like it.

~Cemetery (Dragons Blood, grass, vanilla, and patchouli) 
Vanilla grass with a touch of light floral. The grassy scent is quite strong at first, but then the vanilla takes over eventually. 

~Crowley (Nag champa incense) 
Exactly as described, it is certainly strong, and definitely fills a room. Despite not always being a fan of incense, I really enjoy the almost spiced undertone. 

~Dearly Departed (Fresh florals, dirt, grass, and rose)
Smells like a hedge, slightly sagey, and certainly green the rose is also there but not very overpowering, thoughI don't smell the dirt per se. Definitely an unusual scent.

~Love and Eternal Darkness (lilac, cream, and soft fruits)
This is my certain favorite, I adore lilac and this smells spot on. It dries down to be light, but still smell able ages later, the cream adding almost a softness to it. The fruit doesn't play in much other than slight sweetness perhaps? This scent is a true delight to me, and in general I am not a strong lover of florals.

~Man of letters ( Scotch, mahogany, smoke, and leather)
Light smoke and leather. There is an alcohol scent, but its not calling scotch to me, a significantly more neutral, almost medicinal alcohol. Nailing the smoke again as the last note i pick up on.Definitely a masculine leaning scent.

~Memento Mori (Nag champa and rose)
This ends up being a simple, fairly elegant floral. Its pleasant, very lightly spiced floral Rose, and as described. Its a straightforward scent as far as this collection goes.

~Natural History ( Old books and Old Library)
Unfortunately I dont smell either of those notes, its powdery, and vintage, with the overall smell of alcohol used for specimen preservation. Its unusual, not exactly the immediate old library scent.

~Nosferatu (Incense, candle wax, stone walls, rose, wine, and strawberry) 
The incense takes over slightly, but i do enjoy letting it settle to smell a deep rose, something slightly cold as the stone i imagine, and then the very light waxiness. I dont particularly smell strawberries or wine in this scent, but perhaps on skin it might show through.

~Oddities (White Amber, jasmine, and musk)
I would say jasmine is the least apparent scent in this, deep musk, leaning clean, very sterile smelling in a hospital way with a light aftertone of the jasmine. Certainly not a perfume scent I've smelled before.

~Opium Den (Frankincense, myrrh, orange blossom, patchouli, cedar cream, and coffee)
Floral hits first, somewhat orange blossom, and then the clean soapyness of the frankincense and myrrh. Patchouli is there, but really lightly for patchouli. Perhaps the softness of the cream at the very end. I don't really smell the coffee at all, but once again it feels like one of those scents to show up more on the skin.

~Parlor Ghost (black tea, bergamot, and lavender) 
Lavender heavy, then the flowery bergamot, and the last note of bittery black tea. The bergamot seems to hold the best in the nose for this one.

~Porcelain (Vanilla, walnut, jasmine, dianthus, rose, rosewood, and powder) 
A powdery, floral, vanilla rose, the walnut adds a touch of something solid in the middle on the scent, but not distinctively walnut. I slightly unusual smelling floral.

~The Bride (black amber, lavender, nightshade, black flowers, and powder)
This scent is deep with the amber and flowers, the nightshade adds a slightly unusual floral to it. I find the powder is slight, and almost smelled in the middle of the scent. There's also a bitter undercurrent to it.

~The Monster (Petrichor, thunder, ozone, sandalwood, cedar, and clove)
I expected this to be fairly weak is scent, but this certainly fills a room while still being incredibly light. This is unusual in the best way, the petrichor hitting your nose almost inperceptibly first sandalwood and cedar wood overall laying scent profiles. This smells very green and outdoorsy, but not distinctly like grass, quite a bit lighter. The light wet rain smell is very distinct in this perfume, so much so it surprised me.

~The Mummy (Antiqued Vanilla, cardamom, oud, spices, dusty cream)
I enjoyed this vanilla the most, definitely feeling the vintage smell of it, and im not a fan of vanilla, but this one charms me. Cardamom is a midtone, the oud is somewhat there, and it is certainly spiced. The cream seems to come out as powdery as it dries down later, being very light. This smells vintage in a very beautiful way.

~The Sad Hour (Figs, ferns, salt, and lilies) 
This is what I'd describe as a dark green scent, the lilies very lightly there at all, the fighting and ferns the most clearly of all. It seems to stay floaty and light.

~The Undertaking (Oak, Moss, Ivy, earth smoke, incense, and plum)
Plum fruityness and incense pop out first. Very light on smoke, with oaky wood, and slightly spiced backdrop. Not as moss or earthy heavy as I expected, if anything those notes disappear to the greenish incense.

~The Witching Hour (Dark Chocolate, burning leaves, saffron, and oud)
The slightly bitter dark chocolate hits first with the saffron and oud laying as a background to it. There's a light touch of smoke, but its very subtle. I almost smell coffee lingering in this one.This one surprised me with how much I enjoy it. 

~The Wolf (Forest, cedar, oak, pine, animal musk, metallic silver, and dry wood)
Very woodsy, but in the way a men's deodorant might be. The pine and cedar are the most distinctive to me, but all are rhere except the silver. This one is very akin to something my father would wear as a smell, very safe and nostalgic to me, and certainly masculine.

~The Hedge Witch ( Pipe tobacco, herbs and spices, woods, laudanum, and leather) 
Slightly soapy, but primarily herbal, like essential oils and home remedies. Pipe tobacco is there, but not strongly so. The leather might lay as a base to these smells.

~Vanitas (Citrus, sandalwood,vanilla, coconut, apple, raspberry, red currant, cherry, strawberry, and pineapple) 
This is a fruity in an almost candy like way, sweet citrusy, vanilla lightly in there. Apple and cherry show up halfway through, pineapple and currant at the end most. The sandalwood is adding a slight warmth almost, but it is light, especially for sandalwood. This reminds me of gummy bears and sweet gummy candies, and feels like a happy scent.

Thank you for the reading! Its certainly a large block of text. Let me know if you have any questions (or if you see a spelling error), and I'll answer as best i can! I think my lack of experience in this area is shown in not quite being able to find certain notes.

1r2md0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1r2md0r/what_should_i_do_regarding_this_complicated/,what should I do regarding this complicated situation with this guy?,"hi everyone. I have posted here before but I deleted my post because I did not provide as much context as I should've, and a lot of people were really confused and concerned. I will try my best to summarize it. I apologize if it is long. 

I (18F) met this guy in late 2024. he was very kind, yet awkward and reserved. I found him very endearing and sweet and started liking him from then on. we talked a couple times around that time but it was surface level and he never went out of his way for me. 

I used to go to these dances in late of that year to very early last year. they were once a month and they taught ballroom dances. everyone there was encouraged to ask others to dance. I noticed, he barely ever asked me (unless he had to) and kind of ignored me at this point. like, he would be directly in front of me while everyone else had a partner and then just walk away. he was still kind towards me but I was hurt when that happened. 

this girl I know (let's call her C) would go and he would ask her multiple times to dance and actually went out of his way for her. I basically knew at that point he didn't reciprocate but I had gotten the news that I would be away from home for months. and we didn't have anything mutually together anymore so I took the risk and told him I liked him. I did it through a letter. he was very appreciative of it and was very grateful for it. I wasn't sure if I would see him ever again. 

we had a mutual friend and me and her got closer throughout that year. so when I got back in town about 6 months later, I immediately saw the guy again. it was so awkward but I didn't really think much of it. then on the same day as my birthday his family had this like party and they invited me. I wanted to go as most of my friends would be there. I meet his family there and off the rip, me and his mom kind of hit it off? I can say he is very close to his family, and especially his mom. 

the girl I mentioned C would always be talking to him and they were always together at events so I didn't feel like I had a chance anyways. everyone wanted them together. I start seeing him more often through the mutual friend I mentioned earlier. I still liked him but it just started getting weirder the more I saw him honestly. 

suddenly, he starts actually approaching me but in really odd ways? like he is awkward, but he just started being stranger than usual. he started pacing around me, asking out of the blue questions, randomly appearing beside/behind me. I ignored it as him feeling bad for me or something. I noticed when girl C was around he wasn't AS strange around me.

then, his mom started inviting me to events and things that he would be at as well. he even would invite me to stuff. I started going to them and his behavior got stranger. he would start just appearing behind/beside me and pointing out things I was doing. like one time I was just putting my jacket on and he appeared beside me and started complimenting me on how smart it was to wear one. it was 14 degrees outside. he was always finding ways to congratulate me or compliment me. I found it very endearing but confusing. 

and then, his mom texts me asking to get coffee with her.. one on one... Im kinda weirded out and my friends are too but I decided to go with her and it's actually pretty normal. then I see the guy I like again and it's getting even more perplexing. 

now he goes up to talk to me but he keeps losing track of his words, he keeps fidgeting and he has this hard blinking tic and he does it a lot when we talk. but he said he wanted to continue talking to me. he is really kind. he's always trying to walk me to my door and runs to the door when I'm about to open it just so he can open it for me. he offers me his food and he's always checking on me and is really happy to see me doing well. he's always cheering me on. 

but I just don't know what to do. why is he suddenly talking to me and doing all this? is he just friendly? I still really like him. what about the girl C? Im afraid I'll talk to him about it and have the wrong idea. thank you for reading!! ",1,1770878469.0,AskMenAdvice,1,1.0,False

If I try to leave it a bit more then the rest of the water doesn't come out.

This n8n workflow does what would take your team 40 hours of manual work →

Most recruitment agencies are still doing this the slow way:

→ Manually checking Indeed  
→ Opening LinkedIn job search  
→ Scrolling through Glassdoor  
→ Copy-pasting company names into Google  
→ Hunting for hiring manager profiles  
→ Guessing email formats

8 hours of work = 20-30 qualified leads.

Meanwhile, agencies using automation?

They're pulling 1,000 jobs and 500+ decision-maker emails before their first coffee.

While you're on page 2 of Indeed, they've already sent 50 personalized outreach emails.

Here's what the system does in 10 minutes:

→ Scrapes Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor simultaneously  
→ Captures 1,000+ fresh job postings  
→ Filters out recruiter spam and duplicates  
→ Identifies actual hiring managers (not generic HR)  
→ Extracts 500+ verified contact emails  
→ Saves everything to your CRM  
→ Generates personalized outreach templates

Real numbers from agencies running this:  
  
→ 10 leads/week → 40+ leads/week  
→ 80% less research time  
→ 3x more outreach without hiring staff  
→ 5-7 new client calls booked weekly  
→ First response: under 1 hour (vs 24+ industry average)

The agencies winning placements right now?

They're not the ones with the best recruiters.

They're the ones in the hiring manager's inbox first.

1r2m6ki,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbancarliving/comments/1r2m6ki/faq_for_newbies/,FAQ for newbies.,"This post and thread aims to answer lots of questions people new to this subreddit ask. Not that we mind people asking, because that's what this subreddit is for, but hey, here's some answers to Frequently Asked Questions:

Q: I'm new to car living I need ALL the information about living in cars. Where can I find it?

A: [https://nomadlife.wiki/Main\_Page](https://nomadlife.wiki/Main_Page) and in particular [https://nomadlife.wiki/Quick\_start\_guide](https://nomadlife.wiki/Quick_start_guide) are great places to find the information you need.

Q: How do I stay warm?

A: Check out the Nomad Life Wiki [Keeping warm page](https://nomadlife.wiki/Keeping_warm).

As a starter you can:

* Get a good zero degree rated sleeping bag.
* Use woolen blankets which you can buy cheap from second hand stores.
* Dress in layers.
* Wear a hat / beanie to keep warm.
* Use a hot water bottle, or almost any bottle filled with warm water and wrapped in a sock.
* Buy and use [reusable hand warmers](https://www.google.com/search?q=reusable+hand+warmers).
* Eat hot food.
* Use a [Mr Buddy or similar propane heater](https://mrheater.com/collections/buddy-series) when awake, but do so with a carbon monoxide detector and the windows cracked a little.
* Use a [12 volt pet heating pad](https://www.google.com/search?q=12+volt+pet+heating+pad) if you have the battery capacity.
* Use [foil emergency blanket](https://www.google.com/search?q=foil+emergency+blanket)s to keep the heat in.
* Build a blanket tent to make a small space in your car to keep warm.
* Run the car engine for a while then run the heater.
* Drive to warmer locations.
* Put insulation (plastic foam, cardboard?) between the sleeping bag and floor surface. Cover the windows on the inside.
* Buy and use a heated mattress topper if you have the power to run it.
* Use two sleeping bags, one inside the other
* Sleep with a hat on and don't sleep in wet or damp socks -- even if your socks are just a little damp with sweat, take them off and put on fresh dry socks or sleep barefoot.
* Park in an underground parking lots because they're protected from cold breezes and often the concrete retains heat. Sometimes they're purposely even heated.

 Q: How do you keep cool?

A: Check out [https://nomadlife.wiki/Keeping\_cool](https://nomadlife.wiki/Keeping_cool) and;

* Park in the shade.
* Open your windows. Get window [shades](https://www.google.com/search?q=car+window+shades) / [screens](https://www.google.com/search?q=car+window+screens).
* Go to cool public places like  mall, library, museums, coffee shops etc.
* Drive to cooler areas such as up in the mountains, or by the sea if there is a sea breeze.
* [Rechargeable USB powered fans](https://www.google.com/search?q=Rechargeable+USB+powered+fans). These are cheap, don't use much power and help keep you cool.
*  Use a misting squeese bottle. Use it in conjunction with your fan.
* Drink plenty of cool water.
* Soak a cloth in cold water and wipe yourself down.
* Buy ice for your cooler.
* Cool drinks in your fridge.

Q: Is it scary? I am scared? Does it get better?

A: Yes at first living in a car is scary because it is so far out of most people's comfort zone. It is not uncommon to be hyper-vigilant at first. The first nights then days then weeks can be scary, emotional, confronting. But then you get used to it. You adapt. Your body and mind get use to living in your car. It becomes the new norm.

Most people say the first month of living in their car is the hardest. Bob Wells of [https://cheaprvliving.com/](https://cheaprvliving.com/) fame wrote that the first night he slept in his box truck he cried. I also tared up the first night of living in my bus because I thought I was a failure, then I realised I actually had a pretty comfortable home with a lot of things many people would dream of having. If you have a safe place to sleep, access to electricity, access to water and access to public toilets you're doing okay.

Q: I have pets, how do I look after them?

A: Pets are family. You need to put their needs first. You have to ensure that they have a safe place that is climate controlled, so look at the information on keeping cool and keeping warm. Heat and cold can kill yourself and your pets.

You can buy [water filled pet mats](https://www.google.com/search?q=water+filled+pet+mats) to keep pets cool. I recommend this type

https://preview.redd.it/5bcumj7oa0jg1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=38da1158dc7c91d82767f59b1cc19ad81f3bf2fd

I found the [Home to Home Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/hometohomeorg/) They also have a web site [https://www.instagram.com/hometohomepet](https://www.instagram.com/hometohomepet) They describe themselves as ""an interactive web platform created to help families, people, and pets with the difficult task of transitioning pets from one home to another.""

Q: What stuff do I need?

A: A lot of the stuff you have already such as bedding, clothes, dishware, cutlery. But probably not as much as you have in a home.

* Things that you might want to buy include:
* A [portable power station](https://www.google.com/search?q=portable+power+station). IT is probably a good idea to research them such as on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=portable+power+station).
* Water storage. A container to store your drinking water in.
* Consider a [USB rechargeable water pump](https://www.google.com/search?q=USB+rechargeable+water+pump) for the top of the water bottle. 
* Some form of lighting like [rechargeable puck lights](https://www.google.com/search?q=+rechargeable+puck+lights) or [string lights](https://www.google.com/search?q=rechargeable+string+lights).
* A [flat car bed](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=car+bed) or [air mattress](https://www.google.com/search?q=air+mattress). Get one with a rubber bung in the hole, not a screw in stopper as those leak.
* Some way to access wifi, like a modern laptop or phone.
* [Roadside coverage](https://www.google.com/search?q=affordable+Roadside+coverage). Pretty important when your car is your home.

1r2m4di,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1r2m4di/best_vpns_for_plutotv/,Best VPNs for Pluto.TV,"Your ISP can see you're watching Pluto.TV. More importantly, Pluto.TV can see *where* you're watching from—and if you're outside the US, UK, or a handful of other countries, you're getting blocked. That ""Pluto.TV is not available in your location"" error? Frustrating as hell.

I've tested over 40 VPNs to find which ones actually work with Pluto.TV. Not which ones *claim* to work—which ones I personally verified can bypass geo-blocks without buffering every five minutes.

Here's what I found.

✅ **Quick Answer**

NordVPN is the best VPN for Pluto.TV. Fast speeds (averaging 83+ Mbps on 100 Mbps connections), reliable US server access across 16 locations, and it actually unblocks Pluto.TV consistently. Surfshark comes close at half the price with unlimited device connections.

# Why You Need a VPN for Pluto .TV

Pluto.TV is geo-restricted. Simple as that. The free streaming service operates in the US, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and select Latin American countries. But here's the kicker—the content libraries are completely different.

The US version? Over 250 live channels. Thousands of on-demand titles. Classic TV series, movies, news, sports. The UK or Canadian libraries? Fraction of that content.

Even if Pluto.TV works in your country, you're missing out unless you're accessing the US catalog.

**The Geo-Block Problem**

When you visit Pluto.TV, their system checks your IP address against a database of allowed locations. Wrong location? Instant block. Traveling abroad? Blocked. Living somewhere Pluto.TV hasn't launched? Also blocked.

A VPN changes your IP address to one from an allowed region. Connect to a US server, and suddenly you look like you're streaming from Denver or New York. Pluto.TV sees a valid US IP and lets you through.

💡 **Pro Tip**

Clear your browser cookies before connecting to your VPN. Pluto.TV can track you through cached data even after you've changed your IP address. Incognito mode works, but I prefer just clearing cookies in my regular browser.

# The 5 Best VPNs for Pluto .TV

I tested each VPN with Pluto.TV on multiple US servers, measured connection speeds, checked for buffering, and verified they could maintain stable streams. These five passed every test.

# 1. NordVPN – Best Overall for Pluto .TV

After testing dozens of VPNs, NordVPN keeps ending up at the top of my list for streaming. Not because it's perfect—it's not—but because it consistently delivers where others struggle.

**Why NordVPN Works for Pluto.TV**

NordVPN operates servers in 16 US cities. That's important because server congestion kills streaming quality. With that many locations, I can always find a fast, uncrowded server. During testing, Denver and Seattle servers performed best, but Dallas and New York worked just as well during off-peak hours.

The speeds impressed me. On a 100 Mbps connection, I averaged 83.82 Mbps download speeds through NordVPN's US servers. That's an 84% retention rate—more than enough for HD streaming on Pluto.TV without any buffering.

**The NordLynx Advantage**

NordVPN's proprietary protocol based on WireGuard delivers noticeably faster speeds than standard OpenVPN. I ran side-by-side tests. OpenVPN averaged 65 Mbps. NordLynx? Consistently above 80 Mbps. Makes a real difference when you're trying to stream live channels.

**Security Features That Matter**

I'm not big on security theater—most people don't need military-grade this and that. But NordVPN's Threat Protection blocks ads and malware automatically. Pluto.TV already runs ads (it's free, after all), but blocking the sketchy third-party stuff improves the experience.

The verified no-logs policy matters too. Panama jurisdiction, independent audits, the works. Your streaming habits stay private.

|Feature|Details|
|:-|:-|
|**US Servers**|1,970+ servers in 16 cities|
|**Average Speed**|83.82 Mbps (100 Mbps connection)|
|**Simultaneous Connections**|10 devices|
|**Money-Back Guarantee**|30 days|
|**Best For**|Reliable streaming with fast speeds|

**Honest Drawbacks**

The monthly pricing stings—$12.99 is steep. Annual plans drop to around $3.39/month, which is reasonable, but that upfront cost puts some people off. Also, the Linux app is clunkier than the Windows or Mac versions. Not a dealbreaker, but worth mentioning.

# 2. Surfshark – Best Budget Option

If NordVPN's price makes you wince, Surfshark delivers similar performance at nearly half the cost.

**Unlimited Connections**

This is Surfshark's killer feature. Connect every device you own—phone, laptop, tablet, Smart TV, whatever. Most VPNs cap you at 5-10 devices. Surfshark? Go nuts.

For families or anyone with multiple devices, this alone justifies the subscription.

**Speed Performance**

Surfshark's US servers hit speeds around 86% of baseline in my tests. Slightly slower than NordVPN, but we're talking 81 Mbps vs 84 Mbps on a 100 Mbps connection. You won't notice the difference watching Pluto.TV.

The WireGuard protocol keeps things fast. I tested both WireGuard and OpenVPN—stick with WireGuard unless you have a specific reason not to.

**CleanWeb Ad Blocking**

Surfshark's CleanWeb feature blocks ads, trackers, and malware. It's similar to NordVPN's Threat Protection. Since Pluto.TV already has built-in ads, this mostly helps with pop-ups and tracking scripts on the website itself.

|Feature|Details|
|:-|:-|
|**US Servers**|600+ servers in 25 cities|
|**Average Speed**|81 Mbps (100 Mbps connection)|
|**Simultaneous Connections**|Unlimited|
|**Money-Back Guarantee**|30 days|
|**Best For**|Budget-conscious users with multiple devices|

**What I Don't Love**

Server selection isn't as extensive as NordVPN's network. During peak hours, I occasionally experienced slower speeds. Nothing that ruined streaming, but noticeable. Also, customer support is hit-or-miss—sometimes great, sometimes slow to respond.

# 3. ExpressVPN – Most Reliable

ExpressVPN is the VPN I recommend to my non-tech-savvy friends. It just works, every time, without fuss.

**22 US Server Locations**

ExpressVPN spreads servers across 22 US cities. That's more options than NordVPN, which helps when you need a specific regional IP or want to avoid congestion.

I tested servers in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and Miami. All worked perfectly with Pluto.TV. Connection times averaged 3-4 seconds—snappy.

**Lightway Protocol**

ExpressVPN's proprietary Lightway protocol impressed me. Faster than OpenVPN, more stable than some WireGuard implementations. In my tests, it averaged 89 Mbps on a 100 Mbps connection—the fastest of any VPN I tested.

**MediaStreamer DNS**

This is clever. MediaStreamer lets you unblock streaming services on devices that don't support VPN apps—Smart TVs, game consoles, Apple TV. You change your DNS settings instead of installing software.

I tested it with Pluto.TV on my Samsung Smart TV. Worked flawlessly.

|Feature|Details|
|:-|:-|
|**US Servers**|1,000+ servers in 22 cities|
|**Average Speed**|89 Mbps (100 Mbps connection)|
|**Simultaneous Connections**|8 devices|
|**Money-Back Guarantee**|30 days|
|**Best For**|Beginners wanting reliable performance|

**The Price Problem**

ExpressVPN costs more than competitors. The two-year plan runs about $2.44/month, which isn't terrible, but monthly pricing hits $12.95. For what you get, it's fair—but Surfshark and NordVPN offer similar features for less.

# 4. CyberGhost – Best for Streaming-Optimized Servers

CyberGhost takes a different approach. Instead of making you guess which server works, they label servers for specific streaming platforms.

**Dedicated Streaming Servers**

CyberGhost lists servers optimized for specific services. Want to watch Pluto.TV? Connect to a server specifically configured for it. In theory, this should guarantee access.

In practice? Mixed results. The dedicated Pluto.TV servers worked fine, but during testing, I found regular US servers performed just as well—and sometimes faster.

**Massive Server Network**

Over 9,000 servers in 90+ countries. Hundreds in the US alone. Server congestion is rarely an issue because there are so many options.

Speed-wise, CyberGhost retained about 86% of baseline speeds. Solid performance, no complaints. Streaming Pluto.TV in HD worked without buffering.

|Feature|Details|
|:-|:-|
|**US Servers**|1,400+ servers across multiple cities|
|**Average Speed**|86 Mbps (100 Mbps connection)|
|**Simultaneous Connections**|7 devices|
|**Money-Back Guarantee**|45 days|
|**Best For**|Users wanting labeled streaming servers|

**Frustrating Interface**

The CyberGhost apps feel dated. Settings are scattered across multiple menus (Settings, Privacy Settings, Smart Rules). Finding specific features takes longer than it should. Not a dealbreaker, but annoying when Surfshark and NordVPN have cleaner interfaces.

# 5. Private Internet Access (PIA) – Best for Power Users

PIA caters to users who want control. Lots of customization options, detailed settings, robust security features.

**All 50 States Covered**

PIA operates servers in all 50 US states. Need a California IP? Done. Want to appear in Montana? They've got you covered.

This level of granularity helps when specific regional content is locked to certain states, though Pluto.TV doesn't usually care about state-level location.

**Customizable Encryption**

Most VPNs lock you into specific encryption settings. PIA lets you adjust encryption levels, protocols, and connection settings. If you know what you're doing, you can optimize for speed or security based on your needs.

For Pluto.TV streaming, I recommend their default settings. They balance speed and security well.

|Feature|Details|
|:-|:-|
|**US Servers**|Servers in all 50 states|
|**Average Speed**|78 Mbps (100 Mbps connection)|
|**Simultaneous Connections**|Unlimited|
|**Money-Back Guarantee**|30 days|
|**Best For**|Tech-savvy users wanting customization|

**Learning Curve**

PIA's apps overwhelm beginners. So many settings, options, toggles. If you want a simple ""connect and stream"" experience, stick with ExpressVPN. But if you like tinkering? PIA gives you all the tools.

# How to Watch Pluto .TV with a VPN (Step-by-Step)

Connecting to Pluto.TV through a VPN takes about two minutes. Here's the exact process I use:

**Step 1: Choose Your VPN**

Pick one from the list above. For most people, NordVPN offers the best balance of speed, reliability, and price.

**Step 2: Download and Install**

Sign up, download the app for your device. Available for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Fire TV, and more. Installation is straightforward—typical ""next, next, finish"" stuff.

**Step 3: Connect to a US Server**

Open the VPN app. Select a US server. I usually go with whatever the app recommends as fastest, but you can manually choose specific cities if you prefer.

Connection takes 3-5 seconds typically.

**Step 4: Clear Cookies (Important)**

This step matters. Open your browser settings, clear cookies and cache. Or just open an incognito/private window. Pluto.TV can track your location through cached data even with a VPN active.

**Step 5: Access Pluto.TV**

Navigate to pluto.tv. Should work immediately. If you still see the geo-block error, try a different US server or clear your cookies again.

⚠️ **Warning**

Never use free VPNs with Pluto.TV. They're slow, unreliable, and many log your data to sell to third parties. Free VPNs also struggle with geo-blocks—streaming services detect and block them constantly.

# What Makes a Good Pluto .TV VPN?

Not every VPN works for streaming. Here's what actually matters when choosing a VPN for Pluto.TV:

**US Server Availability**

Pluto.TV's best content lives in the US library. Your VPN needs multiple US server locations. More servers = less congestion = better speeds.

I won't use a VPN with fewer than 10 US locations. One or two servers get overwhelmed during peak hours.

**Connection Speed**

Pluto.TV recommends 3 Mbps for SD quality, 8 Mbps for HD. Your VPN will slow your connection somewhat—that's normal. Aim for a VPN that retains at least 75% of your baseline speed.

Below 75%? You'll experience buffering. Above 80%? Smooth sailing.

**Consistent Unblocking**

Streaming services constantly update their geo-block detection. A VPN that works today might fail tomorrow. The best VPNs actively maintain their server IPs to stay ahead of blocks.

During my testing period, NordVPN and Surfshark never failed to unblock Pluto.TV. Not once. ExpressVPN had one hiccup that resolved after switching servers.

**No Data Caps**

Some VPNs limit monthly data. Useless for streaming. Pluto.TV uses about 1-3 GB per hour depending on quality. A 10 GB monthly cap? You'll burn through it in one weekend binge session.

Stick with unlimited bandwidth VPNs.

# Common [Pluto.TV](http://Pluto.TV) VPN Issues (And Fixes)

Even the best VPNs hit occasional snags. Here's how to troubleshoot the most common problems:

**""Pluto.TV Is Not Available"" Error Persists**

You're connected to the VPN, but still getting blocked. Usually means Pluto.TV detected your VPN.

**Fix:** Switch to a different US server. Some server IPs get blacklisted. Trying another location usually solves it. If multiple servers fail, your VPN might be on Pluto.TV's blocklist entirely. Time to switch VPNs.

**Constant Buffering**

Video keeps pausing to load. Annoying.

**Fix:** First, test your speeds without the VPN. If you're getting less than 10 Mbps baseline, the problem isn't the VPN—it's your internet connection. If speeds are fine without VPN but terrible with it, try a different server closer to your physical location. Also, switch protocols. WireGuard is usually fastest.

**App Won't Connect to Servers**

VPN client shows errors when trying to connect.

**Fix:** Update the app. Seriously, I forget to update my VPN apps all the time. Outdated versions cause weird connection issues. Also check your firewall isn't blocking the VPN. Windows Defender sometimes flags VPN traffic as suspicious.

🔥 **Hot Take**

If you're experiencing consistent connection problems across multiple servers and troubleshooting doesn't help, the VPN just isn't good enough. Don't waste time fighting with a mediocre service. Switch to one of the recommended options above.

# Free vs. Paid VPNs for Pluto .TV

You're thinking about it. I can tell. ""Why pay for a VPN when free options exist?""

Trust me—I've tested the free alternatives. Here's why they don't work for Pluto.TV:

# Why Free VPNs Fail

**Speed Caps**

Free VPNs throttle your connection to encourage upgrades. Typical speeds? 2-5 Mbps. That's barely enough for SD streaming, and forget about HD. You'll spend more time watching the loading circle than actual content.

**Data Limits**

Most free VPNs cap monthly data at 500 MB to 10 GB. Pluto.TV uses 1-3 GB per hour. You'll hit your limit watching one movie.

**Detection and Blocking**

Streaming services blacklist free VPN IPs aggressively. During testing, every free VPN I tried failed to access Pluto.TV. The server IPs are too well-known.

**Privacy Concerns**

Free VPNs need revenue somehow. Many log your data and sell it to advertisers. Defeats the entire purpose of using a VPN.

|Feature|Free VPNs|Paid VPNs|
|:-|:-|:-|
|✅ Speed|2-5 Mbps|75-90% retention|
|✅ Data Limits|500 MB - 10 GB|Unlimited|
|✅ Pluto.TV Access|Usually blocked|Consistent access|
|✅ Privacy|Often logs data|Verified no-logs policies|

# The Exception

ProtonVPN offers a legitimate free tier with unlimited bandwidth. I tested it. Connection speeds were acceptable (around 40 Mbps on a 100 Mbps line), but it failed to consistently unblock Pluto.TV. Hit-or-miss results aren't worth the frustration.

📌 **Key Takeaway**

Paid VPNs cost $2-4 per month on annual plans. That's less than a coffee. The difference in reliability, speed, and privacy is massive. Don't cheap out here.

# Using VPNs on Different Devices for Pluto .TV

Pluto.TV works on practically every device. Your VPN should too.

# Smart TVs and Streaming Devices

**Fire TV Stick**

All the VPNs I recommend have Fire TV apps. Download from the Amazon App Store, install, connect. Takes five minutes.

I use NordVPN on my Fire Stick. Works perfectly with Pluto.TV and other streaming services.

**Apple TV**

Apple TV doesn't support VPN apps directly. You have two options:

1. Set up the VPN on your router (protects all devices on your network)
2. Use ExpressVPN's MediaStreamer DNS feature (easier but less secure)

**Roku**

Roku also lacks native VPN support. Router setup is your only option. Pain in the ass, but doable if you're comfortable tweaking router settings.

# Mobile Devices

**iOS and Android**

Every major VPN has mobile apps. Pluto.TV's mobile app works great through VPN connections. I've streamed on my phone while traveling without issues.

Battery drain is noticeable—VPNs use power encrypting your traffic. Expect 15-20% faster battery consumption.

# Gaming Consoles

**PlayStation and Xbox**

No native VPN apps. Router setup required, or you can share your computer's VPN connection via Ethernet. The router method is cleaner.

I tested Pluto.TV through my PS5 using a router-level VPN. Worked fine, though setup took about 30 minutes of fiddling with router settings.

💰 **Money-Saving Tip**

Installing a VPN on your router protects all connected devices simultaneously. One subscription, unlimited protection. Perfect if you want Pluto.TV on multiple devices without installing VPN apps everywhere.

# Is Using a VPN with [Pluto.TV](http://Pluto.TV) Legal?

Yes. Using a VPN is legal in the US, UK, and most countries worldwide.

Pluto.TV's terms of service don't specifically prohibit VPN usage. They restrict access based on location because of licensing agreements with content providers, but using a VPN to access the service doesn't violate any laws.

**The Gray Area**

Technically, you might be violating Pluto.TV's terms by accessing content not licensed for your region. In practice? Nobody cares. I've never heard of anyone getting in trouble for watching Pluto.TV through a VPN.

Streaming services focus on blocking VPNs, not punishing users. Worst case scenario? Your access gets blocked until you disconnect the VPN.

**Countries Where VPNs Are Restricted**

VPN usage is illegal or heavily restricted in:

* China
* Russia
* Iran
* North Korea
* UAE
* Turkey

If you're in these countries, understand the risks before using a VPN. Laws and enforcement vary.

# Pluto .TV Content Libraries: What You're Missing

Understanding what content exists in different regions helps explain why using a VPN makes sense.

# US Library

* 250+ live channels
* Thousands of on-demand movies and TV shows
* Live news from CBS, NBC, CNN
* Sports channels including NFL Channel
* Classic TV series (CSI, Star Trek, Hell's Kitchen)
* 24/7 movie channels organized by genre

This is the crown jewel. Most extensive content, best selection.

# UK Library

* 100+ live channels
* Limited on-demand content
* BBC reality shows
* British crime dramas
* Significantly smaller movie selection

Not bad, but maybe a third of what the US offers.

# Other International Libraries

Canada, Germany, France, Spain—all have their own libraries. Some overlap with US content, but mostly localized programming with fewer options.

Latin American libraries focus on Spanish-language content. Good if that's what you want, but limited compared to the US catalog.

🎯 **Bottom Line**

The US library destroys every other region's offerings. If you have access to a VPN, there's no reason to settle for a limited catalog.

# What to Watch on Pluto .TV (US Library Highlights)

Once you're connected, here's what actually makes Pluto.TV worth using:

# Live Channels Worth Your Time

**CBS News (Channel 236)** 24/7 news coverage. Better than doomscrolling Twitter for current events.

**NFL Channel (Channel 465)** Football content when you can't get ESPN. Highlights, analysis, classic games.

**Stories by AMC (Channel 140)** Curated AMC series. The Walking Dead marathons happen frequently.

**Pluto.TV Movies (Multiple Channels)** Genre-specific 24/7 movie channels. Action, comedy, horror, sci-fi. Great for background viewing or discovering old films.

# Best On-Demand Content

* **Classic TV series:** Star Trek (all series), CSI franchises, Hell's Kitchen, Fear Factor
* **Reality TV:** Tons of Gordon Ramsay content, survival shows, true crime
* **Movies:** Rotating selection of theatrical releases (older titles, but free)
* **Stand-up comedy:** Comedy Central specials, various comedians

Content rotates monthly. The library isn't Netflix-level, but for free? Can't complain.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Does Pluto.TV ban VPN users?**

No. Pluto.TV blocks VPN IP addresses they detect, but they don't ban user accounts. If your VPN gets blocked, switch servers. That usually fixes it. I've used VPNs with Pluto.TV for months without any account issues.

**Which VPN server should I connect to for Pluto.TV?**

Any US server works. I recommend letting your VPN auto-select the fastest option. If you want to manually choose, major cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago typically have the most reliable servers.

**Can I watch Pluto.TV on multiple devices with one VPN?**

Yes. Most VPNs allow 5-10 simultaneous connections. Surfshark and PIA offer unlimited connections. You can watch Pluto.TV on your phone, tablet, and TV all at once under a single subscription.

**Will using a VPN slow down my streaming?**

Slightly. Good VPNs retain 75-90% of your baseline internet speed. If you have 100 Mbps internet, expect 75-90 Mbps through the VPN. That's more than enough for HD streaming on Pluto.TV.

**What if my VPN stops working with Pluto.TV?**

First, try switching to a different US server. If that fails, update your VPN app—outdated versions sometimes lose access. Still not working? Contact your VPN's support team. They can recommend specific servers that currently work with Pluto.TV.

**Do I need to keep the VPN connected while streaming?**

Yes. Disconnect mid-stream and Pluto.TV will detect your real IP address and boot you. Keep the VPN active for your entire viewing session.

# Final Verdict: Which VPN Should You Choose?

After extensive testing, here's my honest recommendation based on different use cases:

**For Most People: NordVPN**

Best balance of speed, reliability, and features. Consistently unblocks Pluto.TV, delivers fast speeds, and offers solid security. The 30-day money-back guarantee lets you test it risk-free.

**For Budget Buyers: Surfshark**

Half the price of NordVPN with comparable performance. Unlimited device connections seal the deal. Perfect if you're watching Pluto.TV on multiple devices or sharing with family.

**For Beginners: ExpressVPN**

Simple apps, reliable performance, excellent support. Costs more, but the ease of use justifies the premium if you're new to VPNs.

**For Customization Nerds: Private Internet Access**

All the settings and tweaks you could want. Servers in every US state. Great if you like control over your VPN experience.

1r2m251,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1r2m251/when_the_rain_finally_fell/,When the Rain Finally Fell,"Hello everyone. I am new here and would like to share my work. Please sit back and enjoy this story I’ve written. Grab a snack or drink if you so choose lol.

When Caleb met Alina, she was standing barefoot in the grass behind her aunt’s house, arguing passionately with the sky. “You can’t just threaten rain all afternoon and not commit,” she said, hands on her hips. Caleb had never seen anyone scold a cloud before. He fell in love a little right then. They were nineteen. Everything about them felt unfinished and full of possibility. Caleb loved how Alina spoke her mind without hesitation. Alina loved how Caleb listened—really listened—as if every word she said mattered enough to hold carefully in his hands. They dated through cheap pizza nights and long drives with no destination. They learned each other’s rhythms: he hummed when he was nervous; she cleaned when she was overwhelmed. When Caleb proposed on a foggy hill overlooking the city, Alina cried before he even finished asking. Eight years later, their house smelled like lavender and coffee. They had a golden retriever named Sunday and a habit of falling asleep halfway through whatever show they were watching. From the outside, their life was the kind people pointed at and said, “That’s what I want.” But love, Caleb would learn, is not the same thing as knowing.

⸻

The letter arrived on a Tuesday. It wasn’t dramatic —no bold red stamp or ominous handwriting. Just a plain white envelope addressed to Caleb in ink that looked oddly familiar. Alina was at work. Caleb opened it absently while standing at the kitchen counter. Inside was a single folded sheet. ‘You deserve to know the truth. Alina isn’t who you think she is. Look into the name Mara Vance. 2016. Brook Hollow’. There was no signature. Caleb read it three times. Mara Vance. The name meant nothing to him. 2016. The year he and Alina had started dating. A chill crept up his spine, slow and deliberate. He told himself it was a prank. A mistake. Someone with a grudge. But that night, while Alina slept curled against him, he lay awake staring at the ceiling, the name echoing like a dropped coin spinning endlessly in his mind.

⸻

He searched the next day. Brook Hollow was a small town two hours away. In 2016, a woman named Mara Vance had been charged in connection with a house fire that killed a man — her boyfriend. Suspicion of arson. Insufficient evidence. Case unresolved. The article had a grainy photo. Caleb’s breath left him. The hair was darker. Shorter. The face thinner. But the eyes — they were Alina’s eyes. Not similar. The same. His hands began to shake. The article ended with a line: Mara Vance relocated shortly after the investigation concluded. Relocated. In 2016. The year Alina moved to his city. The year she told him she needed a “fresh start.” Caleb felt something inside him splinter — not loudly, not dramatically. Just a quiet crack.

⸻

He didn’t confront her immediately. He watched her. He hated himself for it. He watched how she laughed at a text from her coworker. How she knelt to refill Sunday’s water bowl. How she kissed him absentmindedly on the cheek while passing through the kitchen. Was any of it real? Or had he married someone who burned her past to the ground — literally? Three nights later, he placed the article on the dining table. Alina walked in from work, dropped her keys into the bowl, and froze when she saw his face. “What’s wrong?” she asked. He slid the paper toward her. The color drained from her cheeks before she even picked it up. The silence stretched. Her hands trembled as she read. When she finished, she didn’t deny it. She didn’t pretend. She just sat down slowly. “My name was Mara,” she said. The room tilted. Caleb’s throat felt tight. “So it’s true?” She looked up at him, eyes glassy but steady. “Yes. But not the way it sounds.” “That man died, Alina.” “I know.” Her voice cracked. “I think about it every day.” Rage flared in Caleb’s chest. “You let me marry you without telling me.” Tears spilled down her face. “Because if I told you the worst thing that ever happened to me on our third date, you would have walked away.” “You don’t know that.” “I do.” She swallowed hard. “Everyone did.”

Eight years earlier, she’d been nineteen and reckless in love with a man named Daniel. He was charming in public and volatile in private. The night of the fire, they had fought. He’d been drinking. She’d locked herself in the bathroom while he raged. She said she didn’t know how the fire started. She remembered smoke. She remembered screaming. She remembered waking up outside with neighbors shouting and flames devouring the house. Daniel never made it out. Investigators questioned her for weeks. They found traces of accelerant but no proof tying it to her. Some believed she’d done it. Others thought Daniel had knocked over something in his drunken fury. No charges stuck. But the town had already decided. Mara Vance was a killer. “So you changed your name,” Caleb said hollowly. “I changed my life,” she whispered. “I couldn’t survive as her anymore. Every grocery store aisle felt like a courtroom.” “Why didn’t you tell me later? After we were serious? Before the wedding?” She met his eyes, and what he saw there wasn’t manipulation. It was terror. “Because I didn’t know how to say it without losing you.” The truth hung between them, raw and jagged.

⸻

Caleb left that night. He drove without direction until the city lights blurred. His mind replayed every memory with her — first kiss, wedding vows, lazy Saturday mornings. Had he loved Alina? Or had he loved the version she constructed? But another thought gnawed at him: What if she was telling the truth? What if the worst thing in her life wasn’t something she did — but something she survived? For days, he wrestled with anger and doubt. He revisited the case files. There was no proof. Just suspicion. A young woman trapped in a small town tragedy. He called the lead investigator listed in an old article. The man was retired now. “I always thought she was more scared than guilty,” the investigator admitted. “Didn’t fit the profile. But fear makes people run. And running looks like guilt.”

⸻

When Caleb returned home, Alina was sitting on the living room floor with Sunday, eyes hollow from lack of sleep. She didn’t stand. “I won’t fight you if you want to leave,” she said quietly. “You deserved the truth years ago. I was selfish.” Caleb crouched in front of her. “Were you ever going to tell me?” “Yes.” Her answer was immediate. “When I felt strong enough to survive losing you.” He studied her face — the woman he’d built a life with. The woman who burned pancakes and sang off-key and held his hand during his father’s funeral. “You didn’t lie about who you are,” he said slowly. “You just hid where you came from. She let out a broken sob. “I don’t know what to do with this,” he admitted. “I’m angry. I’m hurt. But I don’t see a monster when I look at you.” She searched his face like someone waiting for a verdict. “I see my wife,” he finished. The relief that flooded her expression was almost painful to witness. “But,” he continued gently, “if we’re staying married, there are no more shadows. We talk about this. We unpack it. Together.” She nodded through tears. “Anything.”

⸻

Months later, they sat in a therapist’s office, peeling back layers neither of them knew existed. Trust rebuilt slowly—like laying bricks one by one after a storm. Caleb never fully erased the image of that article. It would always be part of their story. But so would forgiveness. And one quiet evening, as rain finally committed to the sky and tapped steadily against their windows, Caleb realized something: Love isn’t the absence of darkness. It’s choosing to stay when the light flickers.

Alina reached for his hand. This time, there were no secrets between them.And that — more than anything — felt like truth.",1,1770877400.0,worldbuilding,0,1.0,False

My sister recently broke her moka pot and is currently surviving on instant coffee, which she hates. I would like to gift her a new machine, but am not sure where to begin. All i know is she wants an espresso maker? and to make other milk based coffees she will heat the milk etc. herself. 

  
I have no idea how this works so would love an all-in-one solution or something that suits her needs. Don't know how much these products cost either, I'm guessing 25k should be more than enough? Happy to go higher if something really does the job.

1r2lylo,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1r2lylo/how_to_get_over_him_without_confessing/,How To Get Over Him Without Confessing," (26F) have never dated or had a serious crush on anyone, partly because I've always been focused on other things or insecure, and partly because I grew up in a culture where my parents didn't approve of dating, wanted me to get an arranged marriage, and had a whole bunch of requirements for the guy I would marry.

When I joined my current job at a hospital, I noticed on the mass email list there was a guy of the same culture/ethnicity etc., and I joked to myself that he could be my future husband. Let's call him ""John"" (27M). I kind of kept to myself and so we never ran into each other due to working different shifts, on different teams, etc. However, in the past year, I started meeting more people who forced me out of my bubble.

I was venting to another girl about how I'm anxious about dating because my family would only accept a person of the same community, etc., and how I almost needed to make sure they checked all of the boxes on my checklist before I could be interested. My friend then told my boss who's of the same ethnicity as me and then all of a sudden I was told I should talk to John and see what happens because we have similar backgrounds, requirements for a partner, etc.. I said I wasn't interested because I'm currently trying to focus on me and know I'm so insecure I wouldn't do well in a relationship. He's also a medical student and left the job a year ago, and I felt that he wouldn't be interested since I'm kind of still stuck and don't know what to do next career wise. Although he left the job he still stops by to study and hang out with previous coworkers as everyone gets pretty close working long hours together.

I thought that was the end of it but when I got promoted and worked upstairs, I overheard someone jokingly talking about how they need to find John a wife, and asked if I was single. Afterward, they realized I heard and we all pretended that nothing happened. Eventually, I brought it up to him to make sure they weren't still trying to make this a thing, and I was told by multiple people that I should talk to this guy, because he's super shy and would never make the first move, and we have so much in common, and his family and requirements for a wife are similar, etc. I was kind of upset they were saying all of these things to me and not John, since it wouldn't make sense if John didn't like me. I tried to shut it all down and told everyone I wasn't interested in dating at the moment, and no one really said much after that, just jokes here and there.

Eventually, I met John, and I tried to play it cool, but we're both shy people so it was kind of awkward, and I knew he'd probably heard about me and how maybe we could talk. I pretended I wasn't interested but I very much was interested and wanted to know what he thought of me. I am currently struggling with a lot of mental health issues and do not see myself as beautiful or likable by a guy, and I think all of the shipping of us and joking by my coworkers was making me overthink everything and worry if he liked me.

I kind of developed a crush on him, but I feel like it wasn't a real crush and just an unhealthy desire to feel wanted and validated. I wasn't initially attracted to him but I did think he was cute after meeting him a few times. However, he's super shy and does not talk to you unless you pursue conversations with him. I tried to build up the courage to talk to him a few times and grab coffee on days when no one else was around and he was studying upstairs, and he didn't say no, because he's nice to everyone. However, outside of this, he wouldn't really talk to me unless urged by others in a group setting. I learned that there were other women he's been interested in, and I felt very upset to know that and I'm trying to get over whatever this is, a crush or just an unhealthy obsession because I think he meets all my ""so called"" requirements.

I told one of my coworkers about how I have a crush on him but I feel like it's only because he's the first guy I've met that checks all the boxes and I'm only telling myself I'm interested because I feel like I won't find anyone else and I have so many insecurities. My coworker accidentally talked about a different issue with my other coworkers who are very good friends with John, that they wanted to know more about and it was indirectly linked to my liking John.

My older coworker who is really good friends with John finally got me to admit my crush on John when we were on shift alone one day, but promised not to tell John. This coworker is trustworthy and is kind of a father figure/advice person for everyone else. I felt embarrassed and said I was already over John, and they didn't ask much else since they knew I was embarrassed. However, they did say they think that I only crushed on John because he's the only available option at the moment, and us being together wouldn't really work out because we'd both be super shy and awkward and stressed and would ""twiddle our thumbs"" and nothing would happen. I kind of agreed with this, but it still made me really sad because I feel like this guarantees that John could never like me, otherwise his friend would have said something else to me.

I have been trying to get over John but I don't know how. I still see him at least once a week at work and end up talking to him because I talk to my other coworkers. I know John seems interested in someone who is super beautiful, and intelligent, like another medical student, and more extroverted since he isn't, and I know I'm not that person. However, John is genuinely a nice person, very respectful, religious, and has good values, and is always very nice to me. I do feel that even if we weren't shipped together I probably would've developed a crush on him. I told my guy friend from work about what's been happening, who also knows my mental health struggles, and he told me John isn't the right guy for me, which I know is true, but my problem is I just want the validation of knowing John could like me. In my mind, I'm a failure because I'm 26 working an entry level job, not in medical school and don't know what to do next, and John is the type of guy I'd be interested in dating. The fact that John isn't interested makes me feel like no guy will ever like me, and I'm hopeless.

My friend said I should talk to other guys to try to get over John, but I'm scared of dating. I also only want to date for marriage, and not casually. I just hate myself as a person and don't find myself attractive, and I'm scared of rejection, and so want to avoid talking to anyone. I know this isn't true, as I've been told by people before that I'm attractive, but I know I should just be working on myself and my career right now. However, no matter how hard I try, I can't forget about John. I know that if I confess my feelings to John he will reject me but be nice about it, but then he will tell my coworker and it will also make things awkward between us in the future. How do I move forward and forget about John?

tl;dr: I 26F developed my first crush on John (27F), who is a former employee of my work, when everyone was shipping us together. I realized my crush on John is unhealthy, and I know John is not interested. How do I get over John?",1,1770877059.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

So for background my mom shows narcissistic traits and I know she doesn't like me and hasn't since I was starting my teen years

When I was freshly 18 I was kicked out of my mom's house cause she just had her brand new baby, not even a year old yet. Saying I'm taking up space and it's not fair for everyone else.

I sound like I'm scooping for pity however it really happened.

Let me backtrack hours earlier that day.

I went to work, working from 11am to 6pm, and my boyfriend showed up to pick me up as I don't have a license, saying ""your mom is packing up your room"" he knew this because we both lived there for only 3 weeks before this, he himself just got home. He said he asked her what she was doing in a genuinely curious way as my mom often came into my room and rearranged things which yes angered me as it meant she went thru all of my belongings in order to put my room however she wanted it to be.

We raced home as I don't understand why everything is being packed up, that was new for her.

When I came in I found all of my furniture gone, bed, anime figures, jewelery, clothes, night stand.

Packed in a few boxes in the livingroom.

I found my sheet, cans with designs on them that I collected like my digi mon can and Inuyasha energy drink can both in the trash, my small hat ornament that I got from a coworker Christmas party, my drawings and more all in the trash, I didn't say a word as I hate confrontation and I've only spoken out against my mom once in my life and never again in defense of my brother.

With held in sadness I picked my items from the trash, setting them down beside the garage as I rummaged thru it. My mom heard the can clink on the ground and was itching for a fight. She stormed in looking already mad

""What're you doing!?"" She yelled

I couldn't get a word in before she yelled again ""all that was trash! Don't come in here feeling sorry for yourself! I told you I was gonna do the ceiling in your room! You left garbage lying around and your room was a mess and it's not fair for your siblings to deal with it!""

Note, I had a room with my sister, split down the middle, my room ""being a mess"" was an exaggeration I believe as my bed wasn't made and had a pair of socks lying outside my laundry basket, and the trash was what was in my trashcan and cans I mentioned on my shelf.

As for the roof? There was a hole far off in the corner where you could see insulation, id say the size of a fist, she mentioned it 1 other time a year ago when she had me switch into the room.

I had my own room, my mom and her bf shared a room with my sister, they asked if I wanted to switch into my sisters room and I told her ""not really"" to which the room got tense, I was then given the option to have my sister move into my room for a short while, while they built another room or vise versa, I asked if I could keep my room and was then met with being scolded and lectured

""It's not fair to your sister! Your room is smaller and these are probably your last years to share a room with your sister before you move out and I need my own room before I have the baby! I need privacy!!"" - November

The baby was born in May, so 4 months later,

(Relevant)

Back to the whole digging in the trash

""All your stuff smells like animal piss! And your papers in the garbage had something on them so I threw them away for you! You should be greatful! No one else's mother would be generous enough to clean out their room for them! You cant have all this stuff, you have too much stuff! And it can't stay in my house!""

Then drifted off topic ""and (her bf) hits his knee every morning in that small room!""

I lived in a camper in the yard with my bf which was what that 3 weeks were and that night I decided to leave. I didn't feel wanted especially not with all the ""you can't keep your stuff here"" and ""you being here isn't fair to everyone in the house"" and the knee comment made me confused as why it was mentioned, did she want my room again?

That night my bf and I decided to move to his mom's as he also felt like she was itching for a fight cause her anger was un prompted. Note that I didn't say anything at all while she scolded me.

I grabbed my boxes from the livingroom and we left that night. It's August (at the time) so I only shared that room with my sister for 8 months or 9, roughly.

The next day my mom called ""can (my sister) have your old bed since you won't need it anymore?"" A bed I got last November when I moved into the room I had alone. I didn't have it a full year with it.

I told her yes it was fine, why would I argue?

5 days later she called me at 6 am furious

""WHERE ARE YOU!?"" I was frozen for a moment. Her call woke me up. ""Not home?""-  ""WHY?!""

""I don't live there anymore?"" I was groggy, shaken from her tone as we didn't talk those 5 days, we didn't need to.

""SINCE WHEN!? You know I haven't seen you all week!""

""It felt like you kicked me out.""

""WHAT!? You know- i-"" then she practically growled with annoyance. ""You always do this! You're not a victim of anything! Is this your boyfriends influence? You know I feel so disrespected! You didn't even tell me goodbye! You could've at least given me that! You've disrespected me and didn't even tell me you were going! You think I kicked you out!? I never did that!! You keep pulling this crap like I'm some monster!""

I was silent, shaky from her yelling.

""Is this because of your boyfriend!? Filling you with these delusions! You know he's so toxic! He's horrible! Him and his mother!""

She never met his mom.

I forget from then on what she was saying, I don't wanna mislead you if I can't remember, I just know it was on about how ""horrible"" my bf is in her eyes. I wasn't gonna take that so I hung up on her. Something I've never done before intentionally.

Like when you say ""love you bye"" and the other person is about to say ""bye"" and you hear the start of it but accidentally already hit the hang up button.

To which she texted paragraphs with 2 groups, one with me, her and her bf, and the other with her, me and my bf.

And it goes - ""I feel very disrespected.  It has been known we need to fix the ceiling and that room all summer.  We have people coming labor day weekend to help.  The stuff could have stayed in the living room for months.  We were going to get bins.  There was no rush and no one ever said the stuff had to go anywhere.  NOONE WAS EVER KICKED OUT and I will not allow lies and drama when all we did was offer everything we had to help.  We don't have a lot and we still offered to help you, (my bf).  Now you cant text back, answer calls or look us in the eye?  You both leave without saying a word?  No goodbye?   I am so hurt and broken hearted and disrespected.""

Again I should note that when we grabbed the boxes we didn't look at anyone, just grabbed the stuff and left. As for the text and calls? She tried to call and text my bf about me while he was currently at work. Along with the ceiling wasn't mentioned until a year ago. If it was again it wasn't towards me.

I told her that it hurt me and still ""felt"" like I was kicked out. And it hurt to see everything packed up and thrown into boxes without being asked if I wanna help or talk to me about her plans to do so, but she waited till I was gone and did it alone.

She replied:

""It is fair that that hurt your feelings, and Im sorry you saw those 3 things in the trash.  Did you see all of the effort to save every other thing and pack it for you, even if those things were mine?  I didn't throw it away to be hurtful, the hat and cans were by your table on the west side along with some papers that had something sticky and smelly.  That is the only reason.  Everything else that seemed like trash I still saved because it wasn't yucky on it.  I thought surely you'd have agreed.  Now hearing how hurt about it you are, I think seeing your stuff packed up was triggering, and it made anything that might have not made it packed up, a bigger and harder thing, because it was emotional in general.  I didn't expect it to be.  I imagined you were just avoiding dealing with the mess because it had gotten too overwhelming.""

Anything she deemed as trash was thrown out.

Things that smelled bad? It was a musty scent, not pee. The sticky? A rim mark from a coffee on the far corner on top of a stack of paper.

Followed by her bf

""Good morning,  so we haven't seen or heard from you since Sunday. We tried reaching out to (my bf) since he doesn't have a vehicle to see if we could help get him to work. But We have heard nothing. We have done everything we can to help you both. Support you where we can. Run you to and from work and everywhere else. And you now disrespect us by ignoring us.""

((My bf didn't have a vehicle cause the transmission blew so he borrowed his dad's))

Looking back I kinda feel bad for not saying anything but she wasn't rational at the time, had I said ""I'm leaving"" or ""we found a place, were moving out soon"" 1 would've been a lie since we just went to his mom's and 2 would've not gone over well.

She still thinks I have my own place with him, but I won't go back as my space and boundaries have been intruded several times thru out the last few years. Had I told her where we actually were she'd be furious.

I like to over examine things, which is good and bad in its own ways.

My mother is the type who will talk bad about you to her friends, talk bad about your friends. But in public she's a perfect ray of sunshine.

Example:  what she said on call and then slowly dialed back when in a gc with my bf. He didn't know she said all that about him till I told him.

Her bf contacted us via gc because my mom more than likely vented about me to him.

Since being out of my mom's I've been called a lot to ask my bf to drive my brother (20) who doesn't have a car to bring him to work, a half hour drive to the house, to my brothers work and back home. Which would've been better had the calls be in advance but they'd be ""hey he needs a ride right now."" Or ""in 10 minutes"" or he works in the next half hour. All last minute calls

Stressing my bf out because he doesn't wanna be a taxi service for people who didn't even respect him.

My brother unaware of the tension was always greatful we'd step up to help, paying for our gas and thanking us when we drop him off and pick him up.

As for why it became a bigger issue, one night my mom texted ""hey can you pickup your brother? He's gonna be out in the cold :(""

""I can't, I'm 4 hours away and (her bf) is working""

""So if you could get him and hangout with him for a few hours until someone gets him that'd be great""

I had a date night planned with my bf, my bf was actually in the car waiting for me when she texted. As it was December when she texted and I didn't want my brother in the cold tho that was a guilt trip on her part I still couldn't do that to my brother.

""When does he need to be picked up?""

Which was replied with ""20 min ago"" frustrated at the fact I couldn't take it but still took a respectful route.

""I had a date night planned with my bf, I wish you'd texted or told me beforehand. Please be mindful of other people""

.....that didn't go over well.

I put my phone in my pocket, got in the car, told my bf everything and we went to go get my brother.

We got him, dropped him off, I then read my messages.

Paragraphs.

I am telling you because I just found out from (her bf)... I am working 4 hours away.  Your brother had 24 hours to find a ride.  I am hours away finding this out.  He is in the same town you are in so I obviously was going to see.  He could just walk there ans stay warm and hang out while you go on a date. That was a little aggressive without asking me more questions?  I am just trying to help. I won't ask anymore for sure.   There is never any way to know if some one has plans without asking.  If you are unable to do something, saying no is okay.  If someone needs help, asking is okay.

This seems like more anger than normal or than is equivalent to the issue though?  So there must be something else going on.  We can talk about it whenever.

When I am busy..... like legit busy.   Driving,  putting the baby to sleep...

This is considerate apparently.""

Followed by screenshots of me asking her for my school records to get a driving permit. And 2 calls and hr apart after she said she'd call me back.

Then

""I don't like teenagers I've concluded.   They are selfish assholes.""

""I have all these moments where it is normal and good and ( me) sounds like (me), a young woman, kind and sensible and a bigger friend than anyone around her can see.. and then there are these other moments and i have no idea what to do or what is happening and it doesn't make sense.  The only thing i can do is call it a phase and not get too wrapped up in it.  I feel like everything i do is wrong and i haven't been this depressed in as long as i can remember.""

followed by

""all that spam was for (her bf)""

Over analyzing this myself, ""hey your brother is in the cold and needs a ride :(""

And literally no one else is around to get him, is guilt tripping, and then talking bad about me then to say it was meant for her bf is rude. Just going to talk bad about me for saying to be mindful of others? Also, she didn't ask if I was busy. She told me that my brother was out in the cold.

There was no asking.

Note, I didn't reply to her and all that was unprompted.

When I finally replied it was-

""Can (my brother) hang out again???? It's super cold and (moms bf) cant get there on time.   He is done at 5"" - is asking me to get my brother because no one made sure he could get home.""

""It's super cold"" - should have motivated you to make sure he had a ride.

""He will be sick at McDonald's for awhile :("" - is a guilt trip.

And the rest of all that was toxic and rude. If not toxic it was rude as shit Why does me telling you to be considerate of other people set you off so much I was only asking you to be considerate because you have told me to ask my bf to give my brother a ride several times when it could have been planned ahead of time And when you said quotation I won't ask again that was also rude and guilt tripy Screen shotting and turning this on me is rude as shit I was only asking you to be considerate of other people, it doesn't make sense why you flipped out I brought my brother home because you said your bf at least knew he needed a ride, you could have planned ahead and that's not fair to William YOUR aggression was not needed. I should not have to get firmer and louder to be heard here""

Which I don't necessarily think was out of line as I'm more concerned for my brother and their carelessness as my brother doesn't have a car, they know this and live with him! Yes he could've tried to find a ride however still asking last second isn't cool.

Followed up with screenshots since the screenshots of me asking her for my info

""Nothing after this was for you.  All of it was sent to (her bf). It was supposed to be sent to (her bf).  All screenshots were to him and I didn't even send what I meant to.  Nothing past this line was for you.  I was driving.

Your brother knew the plans early friday.  He and Mark apparently tried to contact you friday I didn't know this til tonight.

I texted you right after talking to (her bf) and finding out your brother didn't get something arranged and didn't have a phone charger.  I was a state away finding this out.  I didn't have any other warning myself.

The information I gave you about your was the bullet points I had just found out and was pertinent information.  No intention of guilt.  He was just going to wait at McDonald's, but he didnt know (her bf) had troubles with his order and was going to be late.. leaving your brother there a long time.  He would have been fine at Mcdonalds.  But I just thought i would reach out and see if he could come hang out with you instead of sit at mcdonalds.

My response was because any form of no, we have plans would have been 100% okay.   I had zero idea of your plans, how could I?  How can anyone know someone's plans before texting?

My problem was the mere asking on my part on your brothers behalf, as soon as I found out he was going to have to wait at mcds a while, just wondering if he could chill with his sister instead.  Thats it.  Zero anything else.   No was totally okay.   The response tone made me wonder what else was going on.  If there was something I was missing.  How could just texting be be inconsiderate.  A response isnt even required.  To be honest I didnt expect one at all, I just thought I was reach out on your brothers behalf.

My frustration regarding teenagers is something normal to vent to your other old partner who understands what I'm talking about.  But it wasnt just about you at all.  Needing to remind and arrange plans, then he forgot the plans, then to saying we didnt have any plans and that I left without arrangements was not correct.  There was more than 24 hours opportunity to arrange rides, even if that meant cab.   So, all that had to be done was phone calls which was a reasonable task to be accomplished.

The other teenagers have to do with what (her bf) is going through atm.

It is the teenager stage that is absolutely isolating from the parents and a huge gulf makes communication feel like alien language.

This is not something I would vent to you about.  At all.

That was all meant for (her bf)"".

Okay, she didn't know right? Instead of her getting defensive and freaking out on me saying ""be mindful of others"" is ridiculous in my opinion. She could've explained sooner.

But that's not all, her bf chimed in.

""Hi. I don't know what's going on with you, but being like that too your mom is not cool and uncalled for, we're just asking for some help for your brother. You could of just said sorry we can't we're going on a date nite/ have plans. I tried calling you last night and it went to voicemail.   We're family and should be able to help each other and say no without being confrontational.""

He did call which I didn't notice till an hr later and  my brother but also an hr later never called back, figuring if it was an emergency he'd call again or text but he didn't.

So I replied with;

""I wasn't confrontational. And I didn't treat her poorly. Step back and look from my perspective.

2, you could have told me as soon as you knew my brother didn't have a ride so I didn't have to leave what I was doing that instant.

3, you or mom could have found my brother a ride knowing he didn't have one.

4, you didn't find him a ride and then hoped since I was closer I'd step up.

Of course I did, you didn't help him out when you knew since the morning that he would be stuck.

5, WE are not family, you're my mom's boyfriend. I helped because you left my brother in a shit situation.

6, yes I could've said ""sorry I can't"" but that's not better or worse than what I actually said.

I said: ""Mom, you can't tell me these things an hour before. My bf and I have date plans I now have to cancel so my brother isn't in the cold for hours.

Please be mindful of others""

That wasn't me saying anything bad, what I said was give a heads up, now I have to go get my brother because I WAS NOT ASKED if I had plans. I was TOLD my brother was without a ride for hours.

I asked her to be mindful of others,  why? Because this isn't the first time I've had to race to get my brother. It's it even the second or the 3rd! It's not the 4th! I'm not a taxi or convenient because you both had poor planning about my brother who has no car.

7, why isn't the babies parent home? At least one. Then getting my brother wouldn't be such an inconvenience to you guys""

Note, I'm 1 of 5 kids, I'm the second born and was the middle child till I was 9 and my little sister was born, then this year was the baby,

All of us have different dads and I'm tired of every new bf being expected to be called my dad.

Was I harsh? Yes, I do feel bad and also feel like I need to put a foot down. This is the first time Ive tried to argue my feelings in years. When I'm confronted or scolded I'm usually silent, letting everyone say what they need too without a response.

Which is usually met with ""you look like I kicked your puppy"" or ""are you gonna say something!?""

I don't want this rift, I feel horrible that I'm tearing my family apart or at least splitting from my family.

I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna yell, I want my mom but I don't think she likes me very much.

If I try to fix it I'll be right back in the cycle of expectations, I'll be the scape goat again.

But her bf replied to me.

""You were very confrontational and still are being confrontational.  From your perspective? all you had to say was no I have plans... that is your perspective....  Just to remind you, how many times have you needed a ride to work, how many times did I or your mom take you to work, or pick you up, was that being mindful? what about when you call me at work? are you being mindful of what I was doing at work? I walked out of an interview to take your call, I walked out on a meeting to take your call, where were you being mindful?

Unfortunately we are not mind readers, that is why we ask questions, as I said, it's ok to say No, but if we don't ask we never know.  I am pretty sure I can count on one hand the times we have contacted you to help with your brother, believe it or not that is what family does.

1. Yes I did call without a follow up text, you weren't answering your brother and I hoped you would answer me, clearly not, so I saw no reason to text you.
2. Your brother had a ride, we were asking for him to come sit at your home to stay warm, we didn't ask you to take him home.
3. It is not our responsibility to find your brother a ride, he is a 21 year old man, we are helping him, just like we helped you get to work, get to town, get to your friends, or does that not count.
4. He did have a ride, and he wasn't stuck, again it was just somewhere to stay till I got there.
5. So just so I am clear, we are not family? It's you that started to call me dad, it's you who calls and chats to me about your issues, it was you that asked if I would walk you down the aisle when you get married, I never pushed any of this on you.
6. Saying No and being honest is far better.

Your mom didn't ask you to cancel any plans, you bought that up, all we asked is if your brother could come hang out.""

7.  As like most families, parents have to work, you do realize that there are bills to pay to survive.

And my final text to them.

""Door dash is not a job. She should take care of her kids.

Yes the dad thing was pushed on me. ""He calls you his daughter"" ""he thinks of you as his kids""

""I think of you as my daughter"" it was pushed. And here you are ACTIVELY pushing. ""We're family"" and ""as a family""

Call you about my issues? Really!? That I was sexually assaulted and need someone to talk about because my ""friends"" bailed? Thanks.

And I was honest, honest that I had plans. You're being defensive

And IF (my brothers) PHONE IS DYING and HE DOESN'T HAVE A RIDE YET and you know that, don't you think you should step up?

(My brothers) ride was hours away whenever mom was done driving around. Or whenever you got off your actual job.

You won't see me at Christmas. I don't know when you'll see me again.

Why? Because this is how you react when someone tells you to help out the person in YOUR house.

If you look at every text I'm telling you to care about my brother. He didn't have a ride yet or anywhere to go other than McDonald's for hours.

I'm just asking you to give a shit. And not tell people that they should step in within moments.

I'm telling you to respect people's time but you whipped around the minor who needed a ride to work from her parents.""

Work? My friends? I didn't have a license!

I payed them in gas money.

I called him dad cause I was pressured to, ""he thinks of you as his kids"" and ""he sees you as his daughter"" and ""you should think of him as dad"" he's been in my life for only a year.. and my ""issues""? I was SA'D by my best friends g-pa, she dropped me like I was nothing. She didn't talk to me after it happened, canceled on my 18th birthday to which we were gonna go to the mall of America together. It wasn't even on my actual birthday, I set that date up to around her work schedule so she could go. She bailed on me and didn't talk to me since. She dropped me even tho she was my witness, she said she'd refuse to go against her grandpa and testify against him. I was a minor.

So my issues?? Every call had been about court. Raw, vulnerable feelings. And he turned it around on me, saying I wasn't being mindful too? That one of all things? Like a bullet.

I told them not to expect me for Christmas, I cut ties with them.

With every text I sent back it was all about my brother, asking them to care about him. He's 21, yes but in their house and without a car, just got his job so hes not friends with his coworkers yet.

I could've gone about it different. But I fail to see asking them to be mindful of others and ACTUALLY asking instead of telling was wrong.

I'm 18 and I just wanna hug my mom. I miss my room and my sister, it is February and my sister turns 9 soon, I don't think I'll get to see her for her birthday and I wish I could've just caved.

Sorry this was long, I really needed a space to vent, I do feel guilty, and sorry that I couldn't just stand down instead of putting up walls. I just wanted them to care a little more instead of just expecting people to jump at helping them when they don't actually care about others.

I could've handled everything differently and I didn't, now I have to live with these choices.",1,1770877057.0,u_Foxigirlplayer5,0,1.0,False

Was just getting it dialed in and ran into a small problem - the shower screen is making a mess of my pucks and leaving lots of grinds behind. From the picture, the grind looks a little course, but I promise it should be fine enough. Using my super jolly on a very fine setting and getting a 36-45ml extraction in 28-33 seconds off of 18g coffee. Same grind size works perfectly in my barista touch and the pucks come off of that clean and dry. This video doesn’t show too well, but the water does come out slightly heavier on the front side, right where the splash-hole is on the puck. Upper sides of the whole group head are filthy too. I’ll be using this for service, so a puck screen isn’t really an option. I just ordered some single use disposable filters, but I’m thinking there has to be a better solution. It came with some other shower screens. Should I be using a different one? Is there something I’m doing wrong? Any advice is appreciated.",5,1770876903.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

Met a lot of people, made a lot of friends, temporary and constant. Now I turned 25 years old, I cut off some people whom I thought couldn’t live without. It was a long process of contemplation, considerations, and patience in paving the way to this decision — it felt heavier and heavier the more I weigh this decision. 

But finally, I had the courage. The courage to let them go, the courage to walked away. For months I had been beating myself up for rethinking and overthinking what did I do to them, why they neglected me, why communication didn’t even exist to them to talk about their real animosity. 

Mahirap pala kapag ang napili mong mga kaibigan ay mababaw lang. Yung hindi nila kayang pantayan yung pagmamahal, pag iintindi, pagpapasensya, at pagtanggap mo sakanila. Ang hirap maging kaibigan yung mga tao na kapag nagkamali ka, hindi nila sasabihin sayo kundi iipunin nila lahat ng pangit, lahat ng masama, lahat ng pintas at kapag sumapit na yung tamang panahon, ibabato nila to lahat sayo.

Ipaparamdam nila sayo ng paulit ulit na wala kang kwentang kaibigan. Handa silang kalimutan lahat ng ginawa mo sakanila — puntahan kapag wasak yung pagkatao nila, damayan kapag sinasaktan sila ng mundo, makinig kapag walang tao gustong makinig. 

It’s such a shame how they treated me so badly, pero nung mga panahon na walang wala sila, nung panahon na humingi sila ng tulong na ipasok ko sila sa trabaho, ginawa ko lahat para makapasok sila dito. Then one day, when they decided to outgrow you, they will treat you like a nobody — na parang hindi kakilala, na parang hindi nakasama sa wala, sa meron, na parang basura.

They will tried so hard to pin point the blame on you. Lahat ng naipon nila na galit, na inis, na inggit sayo, dun nila ibubuhos. Madamot sila sa pakikipagusap, madamot sila sa pakikinig. Dahil isa lang namang istorya yung gusto nilang paniwalaan. They will not give you the chance to improve, learn from your mistakes, or even address their problems towards you. Mahirap kapag may mga kaibigan kang duwag at plastik.

After these sufferings, I finally stepped away. I finally build my boundaries. I finally stopped asking and overthinking. Grabe. Dun ko narealize gaano sila kababaw, gaano ka-superficial yung friendship na meron ako sakanila. Walang growth, puro panlalait, puro materyal na bagay yung usapan, puro expensive restaurants, coffee shops, walang sense, walang laman. 

Finally, naubos na rin ako. Finally, nakalaya na rin ako. At the age of 25, I must say, this is one of my proudest and greatest accomplishments so far.

And to the person who once made me feel worse, I hope you get a life, you get a real and genuine validation outside your social media portrayal. Be considerate to the needs of others, hindi sayo umiikot ang mundo, hindi sa luho, hindi sa materyal na bagay. I hope you will find the real person in you. ",1,1770876900.0,adultingph,1,0.6,False

1r2lw4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/1r2lw4j/my_special_needs_aunt_is_a_hoarder_and_borderline/,"My special needs aunt is a hoarder and borderline abusive, and has burned out 3 separate generations of caregivers. I'm so tired and I don't know what to do anymore. (Long, sorry)","My mother's sister Pam is 66, my mom is 60, and I am 37. My mom has arthritis, chronic pain, and a heart condition so I live at home to care for her. I'm not exactly sure what disability Pam has; back when she was diagnosed my mom was still a kid. Mom thinks they just decided Pam was a r-word and called it good enough. Pam has the intelligence and demeanor of a little kid and lots of difficulty regulating her emotions. She has learning disabilities and can't read or drive although she knows her letters and can count money. She sometimes has sensory issues and is REALLY particular about things always being a certain way (her way) so I think she might be autistic? 

Pam has been living with us since Hurricane Helene damaged her home. The home is still standing, but it has had structural issues that made it unsafe for a very long time, and after the hurricane damaged the water pipes, mold started growing everywhere. it is no longer safe to live there.

My great-grandparents bought that land in the late 1910s and built a house there, and eventually a garage was added. When my grandparents realized the main house was running out of room, they converted the garage into a second house, and eventually, the first house had to be torn down. The second house is where my mom and aunt grew up. My aunt lived there her entire life with my grandparents until they died and then she lived there alone. It is the one damaged by the hurricane. 

The first house ran out of room because not only did my grandparents have 6 children, but they lived through the Great Depression, and they were both hoarders. Hoarding is something they passed down to many of their children. My mother has minor hoarding tendencies but Pam refuses to throw almost ANYTHING away. It's only gotten worse since my grandparents died. The damaged house is completely packed, useless garbage mixed in with priceless treasures, both of the monetary and sentimental variety. I'm talking irreplaceable family photos and diamond jewelry. Mom and I have tried to clean it out many times but my aunt barely lets us touch it, let alone re-organize it or throw anything out.

She came to live with us during the power outage, because without power, she could not get water from the well. We were out of power for fifteen days. When the power came back on, we went back to her house to see black mold and standing water everywhere; we had missed it in the dark.

My aunt wanted the pipes fixed but the rest of the house was already so damaged. It was never meant to last this long. The ceiling tiles are falling in, the pipes leaked in multiple places BEFORE the hurricane, the stairs are unsafe and one of them is straight up missing, and there were constant problems with vermin. 

My mom and I made the choice not to fix the pipes because the repairs would be outrageously expensive, we thought the house wouldn't be safe even if they were fixed, and it would be easier to take care of Pam if Pam lived with us. Pam's house was just down the road from ours, about a mile away, but she can't drive so we had to stop there constantly to deliver her food and groceries and mail from the post office, and waking her up in the morning was impossible because she'd sleep through the phone ringing. 

Unfortunately, Pam has not taken well to living with us, and after a year and a half of sitting the house is in even worse condition than before, so it's not really safe to send her back. We don't have much but we've tried our best to make Pam feel welcome here. We spent all of our savings, years and years worth of money, converting the ""dog's room"" to a proper bedroom when my own bedroom badly needs work done on it (drywalls cracking apart, floor has soft places in it). We've offered to get her anything she likes from her old house. We make dinner for her every night and pet her dogs even though the little toy poodle barks like crazy and keeps us all awake.

But Pam says she isn't wanted here and that we hate her and that she should kill herself and that she wants to go home. We got her on antidepressants and in therapy, but her insurance only covered a biweekly visit and eventually the therapist gave up on her. She says Pam ""can't think"" well enough for therapy to get through to her. 

In truth Pam has just always terrorized people into giving her what she wants and can't accept a reality where she doesn't get it. As a kid she would scream and cry and hit my grandparents and break things when they tried to punish her for misbehaving at school. Eventually she was expelled and found the numbers of all her teachers and principle in the phone book and kept calling their houses sobbing and begging to be allowed to come back. She's spent the night in jail multiple times as a kid and teenager because she was being violent. When my grandparents were sick and dying my aunt helped care for them but they complained constantly of her fussing at them for not doing small things her way, like putting the sugar on a particular shelf or turning the dishes over to dry incorrectly. My grandmother always tried to remain firm against tantrums but my grandfather would get tired and just give in to make it stop, and she knew how to divide and conquer. Near the end of their lives both of them expressed relief that they wouldn't have to live with Pam any longer. 

About 90% of the time, Pam is nice and helpful and easy to get along with, but when she gets into one of her moods, it's hellish. She has threatened to hit me and my mother multiple times. She dug her nails into my hand once when I was holding the front door shut because she was threatening to walk back to her house in bare feet in the snow because she couldn't stand it here with us anymore. The other week the arguing got so bad that my mom had a panic attack that she thought was a heart attack and we had to call the paramedics - I thought I was watching her die on the floor in front of me. What started the argument? I accidentally left the dog's medicine out of the fridge overnight and Pam became convinced she was going to die and burst into hysterics. No amount of reassurance that we could get another bottle in the morning would calm her. When my mom left the next day to get out of the house, Pam started screaming at me that she wanted to go home, and my mom says it's because Pam KNEW that I was willing to do anything to keep Mom from being stressed and having another heart issue.

We have explained to Pam many times that the house is not safe to live in. The pump has been turned off, there is mold, there are structural issues. She still insists she could walk home, carrying her two dogs and all their food, and live there anyway among the ruins. She frequently threatens to walk out of the house and do just that. It's a country road and we worry she would get hit by a car or one of the dogs would escape her. I've had to steal her shoes to keep her from leaving. Mom has offered to find her another place to live if she hates it here: a home, or maybe with one of their brothers. She has warned my aunt that a home will not be very nice (and will not accept dogs) because she doesn't get a lot of money each month - only $1300. My aunt says no. She only wants to live at her house. 

We have explained to Pam that we love her and want her to live here with us. Pam still says we hate her and she's a burden and not wanted. This upsets my mom deeply after all the time and money and effort we have spent to make her feel welcome.

Mom and I go back and forth on how much of Pam's behavior is deliberately manipulative and how much is based in grief and her disabilities. I tend to try to give Pam the benefit of the doubt but mom who has known her longer says Pam is very good at being manipulative. She has thrown tantrums right before important days and my mom says she does that on purpose because she doesn't like other people getting attention. She ruined mother's day, my birthday, and the first snow day we've seen in years (I love the snow but rarely get to see it). She lived here for over a year before she helped a even a little bit with bills. She gets angry if my mom doesn't call her after she gets off work. When Pam and I are home alone she sometimes starts in on me as a way to ""get back at"" my mom. when Pam and Mom are home alone she sometimes starts in on my mom because she knows I'm not there to mediate and de-escalate like I usually do. Once when the shower was dirty because of a backed up septic tank she screamed and cried because my mom promised to clean it after work and then dared to stop by her friend's house after work first and Pam had been taking sink baths for four days. I had to clean that shower for her on my hands and knees, panicking to do it before Mom got home so Mom wouldn't come home and freak out. Mom just quit smoking, so when the arguments get really bad, Pam threatens to walk home to her mold house and mom threatens to go to the store and buy cigarettes. Thankfully Mom's better now but my aunt used to set her off bad and she KNEW she'd set my mom off so when she wanted the shower cleaned immediately she threw a tantrum because she knew I'd get scared and give her what she wanted.

My mom doesn't want to send her to some shitty government home because she swore to my grandparents on their deathbeds she'd take care of Pam, but it was an unfair thing to ask her to do. My mom feels like a prisoner in her own home because she can never watch what she wants on TV anymore. I've taken to hoarding food in my room in case Pam has another tantrum and I can't come out and eat; I've even peed in a bucket and threw kitty litter in it so I didn't have to come out. I miss being able to be in my living room without the TV blaring. We don't even have a coffee table in there anymore we had to take it out so she would stop piling it with hoarder junk. And one of her dogs has taken up residence on one of the couches so there's nowhere left to sit. All my aunt does is sit there and play phone games and neglect her dogs. I take care of her dogs more than she does.

My mom feels suicidal. She says she worked so hard to keep this house through the recession and now it belongs to Pam, who rules us with an iron fist. She's angry and upset that her problems with Pam have now affected me, her daughter, and feels that she has to choose between her sister and her daughter. I don't want to make her choose. I'm like my grandfather I just give Pam what she wants to make it stop but my mom is like my grandmother she wants to make Pam behave. 

Pam will never behave. The other week when she threatened to walk home barefoot in the snow and gave my mom a panic attack we told her she could go anywehre she wanted or do whatever she wanted except live in her moldy house. She just kept repeating, ""I want to go home. I want to go to my house. I don't care if there's mold and no water I can live there with my dogs."" She's like a little kid. She doesn't care about reality.

It's unkind to say but part of me wishes we could just burn the place down so she'd stop threatening to go there. The other part of me wants to let her live there and be thirsty and sick and helpless so she finally fucking understands we are trying to help her. 

She thinks we are not doing a good job of taking care of her because we haven't cleaned her house out yet. Mom and I both work and we are very busy and the house is full of years worth of hoarder junk. My house is also full of Mom's stuff that she kept because she borderline hoards so there's really nowhere for my aunt's things to land even if we did get them, but she goes back and forth on not wanting them because it will make her sad and wanting every object, even the trash, to be brought here and put in out house. it's an impossible situation.

Most of the time I like living with Pam. She helps with dinner and the dishes when she's feeling happy and jokes around with us in her little kid way. And TBH my mom and I don't have the greatest relationship and we used to fight constantly before my aunt came to live with us, and we don't fight nearly as much anymore. But when Pam gets in a mood or when we don't make her happy, it turns into a nightmare. It makes it hard to still love and trust her because I never know when the next bit of violence will be. I live in constant fear of her bad moods, and so does my mom, and so did my grandparents.

This one woman has terrorized three separate generations of people and we've explained to her why her behavior hurts us so badly and she just doesn't care. She only cares about living in that stupid ruin of a house. This is the first time in her entire life, aside from being expelled from school, that she hasn't gotten her way. We thought it would get easier with time but instead it's gotten harder. Sometimes I feel suicidal too. I suffer from chronic insomnia and her toy poodle keeps me awake constantly. The dog's only a few years old and he's gonna live til he's 20. I imagine spending another 15 years or so listening to him bark, being afraid of asking my aunt to control him lest she starts up another tantrum, and I just don't see the point in experiencing all those years when I could just die now. I'm not at risk because I'm afraid of death but I don't want to be alive anymore either.

Even if I could convince my mom to force her to leave, Pam has nowhere to go except a shitty government home that won't accept her dogs where she may get abused or neglected, and she probably wouldn't go there of her own free will. None of her brothers want to live with her and she can't go back to her house unless money starts growing on trees. The little that we did get from FEMA is long gone now. I just don't know what to do except hope either her or me dies in our sleep.

I spent three nights in the driveway until midnight because I wanted the car to be very clean. If the car is not completely clean I do not think we are ready to be parents.

Cool. Anyway.



If you’ve actually lived anywhere else in Korea — or honestly anywhere else in the world — some of the stuff Seoul normalizes is insane for a place that flexes prosperity 24/7.



The venues? Absolute war zones.  

The Hyundai, Seongsu, Hongdae — it feels like the entire population got the same group chat message: “Hey guys, let’s all suffocate together today.”



The subway?  

It’s like walking into a bathroom right after your dad dropped something that legally requires a hazard label — one flush — door closed — humidity set to tropical rainforest. And now you’re shoulder-to-shoulder with 400 strangers pretending this is normal human living.



And the faces.  

Nobody looks happy. Nobody looks relaxed. It’s just this permanent expression of “I am evaluating you, your salary, your shoes, and your life choices in under 0.7 seconds.”



Service? Yeah, sometimes it sucks.  

But also — surprise — people paid like shit, treated like shit, and working zero-tip service jobs don’t exactly radiate joy. The whole system is just burnout cosplay.



Someone recently told me, “If you’re human, you should live in Seoul.”



I told him — respectfully — that’s the dumbest motivational poster logic I’ve heard all year.



If you’re human, you probably want space.  

Air.  

Silence.

Kung titignan, support na support ako sa kanya before. Di lang nya ma feel kase hindi siguro yung kind of support ko yung gusto niya, mas na appreciate niya yung support ng ibang tao. Pag ako nag bibigay ng support, motivation sa kanya laging balewala.

Parang feel niya siguro yung mga suggestions and advice na binibigay ko is hindi support kung hindi kontra lang.

Nagsawa na ko honestly sa ganun. Makikita ko na much appreciated yung mga taong words lang naman yun binigay tapos saken, galit at inis.

Narealize ko, andami kong sacrifices. Tinigil ko lahat, studies ko, mga likes and wants ko, yung mga dapat na goals ko. Pati motivation and confidence ko sinacrifice ko. Inuna ko sila. In turn, ganito lang ibanalik nila. 

Also, lahat ng gusto kong gawing business, either kukunin nila or aagawin. Syempre wala akong magagawa kase mayaman sila, wala akong capability pa na magastusan yun like sa photography, cactus selling, crafts, yung coffee shop ko, ngayon naman yung printing business. 

Ngayon eto, wala na kong gana. Wala naman akong narereceive na appreciation and words of encouragement. Kahit nga yung ma notice ako wala. Na ""ay si ganito gumagawa yan""

Naiisip minsan umalis sa mundo nila kase pakiramdam ko gamit na gamit lang ako sa paguplift sa pamilya niya and sa mga business nila (na dapat saken). Tapos wala ng balik saken.

Ginawa na lang talaga akong sidekick. Nagegets ko na yung phrase na ""hahanapin ko sarili ko"" kase honestly, pano ako magsusucceed or mahahanap yung para saken ulit kung anjan siya na alam kong iddown lang ako. Alam kong walang support saken, hindi ako bina brag. Hindi man lang ako ipagmalaki.

Kaya walang bilib saken yung pamilya niya kase wala siyang ginagawa para saken

Naiinggit din ako sa kapatid ko na sobra mag simp sa kanya bf niya. Pati sa kapatid niya na sobrang ipagmalaki yung asawa niya.

Designing a great guest room is all about comfort, warmth, and practicality. Think beyond the basics by adding thoughtful essentials like convenient storage, a full-length mirror, soft lighting, and a bedside lamp for nighttime reading. Small details can make a big impact, helping guests relax the moment they walk in. With the right touches, your extra space can easily become a cozy, welcoming oasis they’ll truly appreciate.

# 1. Lighten up

https://preview.redd.it/qz9ecodh50jg1.jpg?width=1020&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd6f080276ec9a11efc46cb6ed65476c7174a076

Set the tone in your guest room with layered lighting that feels both inviting and functional. A thoughtful mix of light sources — such as table lamps, wall sconces, floor lamps, or subtle LED strips — can instantly elevate the space. If you’re aiming for a modern, hotel-inspired look, consider installing LED strips beneath the bed frame or along the ceiling line to create a soft, upscale glow without overwhelming the room.

Before guests arrive, take a moment to check that every bulb is working. Spare rooms don’t get daily use, and a burned-out light is easy to miss but noticeable to visitors. For added comfort, place a bedside lamp or mount a wall light within easy reach so guests can turn off the lights without getting out of bed.

Installing a dimmer switch is another smart upgrade. It allows guests to customize the brightness to their preference — whether they want energizing light in the morning or a calm, gentle ambiance at night. With the right lighting choices, your guest room will feel polished, cozy, and effortlessly welcoming.

# 2. Give your walls a paint refresh

https://preview.redd.it/snjsz82u50jg1.jpg?width=1020&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4dfc166ab55b39b3774d4337dfa4ffc9a29c7da0

A fresh coat of paint can completely transform a space. If your spare room has been pulling double duty as a storage area, chances are the walls are showing signs of wear — from scuffs to small imperfections. Updating the color is one of the simplest and most effective ways to instantly revive the room and give it a clean, cared-for feel.

When choosing a shade, lean toward calming, guest-friendly tones. Soft blues, gentle greens, warm neutrals, and muted earth tones create a relaxing atmosphere that helps visitors unwind. Lighter colors can also make the room feel more open and airy, especially if the space is on the smaller side.

Before you start painting, take a little time to prep the walls by filling holes, smoothing rough patches, and cleaning the surface. Proper preparation ensures a polished, long-lasting finish and helps your new color look its best. With the right shade and a bit of effort, your guest room will feel brighter, fresher, and far more inviting — a place anyone would be happy to stay.

# 3. Decorate with bold wallpaper

https://preview.redd.it/q1wmnzrx50jg1.jpg?width=1020&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b544cd209905f50e877926744478f27043c19f6

Swap bland for beautiful with wallpaper that instantly adds personality to your guest room. Even a single feature wall can make a dramatic impact — simply pair it with complementary paint colors on the remaining walls to create a balanced, designer-inspired look without overwhelming the space.

A guest room is the perfect place to be a little bolder with your décor choices. Because it’s not your everyday sleeping space, you have the freedom to experiment with patterns, textures, or statement prints you might normally shy away from. Whether you’re drawn to modern geometrics, soft botanicals, or timeless stripes, the right wallpaper can turn an ordinary room into a memorable retreat.

Don’t be afraid to let your style shine. Thoughtful wall design not only elevates the room visually but also gives guests the feeling that they’re staying somewhere special and carefully curated.

# 4. Create a thoughtful welcome basket

https://preview.redd.it/sr55cim860jg1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6838797658101b255d7fd50c9851254e63f65e9

Make your guests feel truly valued with a thoughtfully prepared welcome basket. Stock it with practical essentials such as a spare phone charger, travel-size toiletries, bottled water, and a few easy snacks. You can elevate the experience even further with simple touches like fresh flowers or a scented candle to create an inviting first impression.

These small gestures show care and attention to detail, helping guests settle in comfortably from the moment they arrive. For a finishing touch, include a short handwritten note — it adds warmth, personality, and lets them know you’ve prepared the space with them in mind. It’s a simple effort that can turn a pleasant stay into a memorable one.

# 5. Ensure your guests have plenty of storage space

https://preview.redd.it/5a3bzenf60jg1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ddc955323fc1c4475e63e738cdc608fc3315e88

When guests arrive with suitcases, coats, and extra belongings, a room can start to feel crowded fast. Help them stay organized by providing plenty of smart, easy-to-use storage. Flexible options like modular shelving, drawers, or multi-purpose furniture allow you to maximize space without sacrificing style, keeping the room calm and clutter-free.

A freestanding clothes rail is a practical addition, giving guests a dedicated spot to hang jackets or outfits they’d prefer wrinkle-free — just be sure to include a few sturdy hangers. You might also consider adding a towel stand or rack so they have a convenient place to dry towels and keep things orderly during their stay.

Well-planned storage may seem like a small detail, but it greatly enhances comfort and functionality, making the room feel more thoughtful, spacious, and guest-ready.

# 6. Pick your flooring

https://preview.redd.it/b3aep2tk60jg1.jpg?width=1020&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94646674b4b4dc0a0abf07805fef24607d482ac2

The right flooring can completely shape the look and feel of your guest room, so choose a style that complements the atmosphere you want to create. Whether you prefer the timeless appeal of wood, the practicality of vinyl, or patterned designs like herringbone or parquet, there are plenty of options that balance durability with visual charm.

For rooms that don’t see heavy daily traffic, easy-to-install flooring can be a smart choice. Many modern options are designed for straightforward installation, making it possible to refresh the space quickly without major disruption. With a wide range of finishes available — from classic wood effects to contemporary patterns — it’s easy to find something that enhances your décor while remaining practical.

To elevate comfort even further, layer the floor with a soft rug. It adds warmth, reduces noise, and brings an extra sense of coziness to the room. Plus, stepping onto a plush surface instead of a cold floor is a small luxury your guests will immediately appreciate.

# 7. Clear the clutter

https://preview.redd.it/gg5s050c70jg1.jpg?width=1020&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0add557c43cb24283d2265fa7f6495bdab12c36

Spare rooms have a habit of turning into catch-all storage areas, filled with off-season clothing, spare bedding, and items you don’t reach for every day. Before guests arrive, clearing this excess can instantly make the room feel more open, relaxing, and intentionally prepared.

Vacuum storage bags are a simple yet highly effective solution for reducing bulk. By removing the air, you can compress soft items like duvets, pillows, and clothing into a fraction of their original size, making them easy to slide under the bed, place on a high shelf, or store neatly in a closet. It’s a fast way to reclaim valuable space without parting with things you still need.

Stackable storage boxes are another smart option for keeping belongings organized and out of sight. Choose durable designs that fit neatly together to maximize vertical space while maintaining a clean, uncluttered look. With a little strategic storage, your guest room can quickly shift from overcrowded to calm, creating a far more welcoming environment for visitors.

# 8. Layer cosy cushions and blankets

https://preview.redd.it/0zd2kpzh70jg1.jpg?width=1020&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85a903d183bc8081d7c61e2106265d9f7ed02dc8

Layering cushions and throws is an easy way to turn your guest room into a cozy, inviting retreat. Arrange a few plush cushions on the bed in complementary colors or textures — think soft velvet, faux fur, or patterned fabrics — to instantly add depth and comfort. Top it off with a chunky knit or fleece throw draped across the foot of the bed, giving guests the option to snuggle up on cooler nights.

These thoughtful touches not only bring warmth and texture to the room but also create a welcoming, homey atmosphere that guests will love relaxing in after a long day.

# 9. Create a mini refreshment station

https://preview.redd.it/npp2sfzk70jg1.jpg?width=1020&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=756578e7f9537016546f2c5c5869f9d52471bd39

Add a hint of hotel-style luxury to your guest room with a simple refreshment station. Place a tray with a kettle, tea bags, instant coffee, and bottled water, along with a few treats like biscuits or fresh fruit. This small but thoughtful setup makes guests feel cared for and adds a polished, welcoming touch that elevates their stay.

# 10. Don't forget the finishing touches

https://preview.redd.it/y5zjxc4t70jg1.jpg?width=1020&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=adedbfafc1bac277a93e08dfce53a5af63d6783c

The right finishing touches can transform a guest room from functional to truly welcoming. Practical additions like a bin and a mirror help guests get ready with ease, while a small desk and chair, if space allows, offer a comfortable alternative to sitting on the bed.

Soft rugs are perfect for rooms with hard flooring, adding warmth underfoot, and a touch of greenery — whether a houseplant or a vase of fresh flowers — brings life and freshness to the space. A scented candle or reed diffuser adds a subtle, inviting aroma, enhancing the overall ambiance. These thoughtful details may be small, but they create a cozy, polished atmosphere that makes guests feel truly at home.",1,1770876115.0,BedroomBuild,0,1.0,False

I was drinking my morning coffee last Tuesday when I looked out the window and realized the grass had completely disappeared under a white blanket. If you live around here, you know that **columbus ohio weather** can go from ""nice fall day"" to ""arctic tundra"" in about twenty minutes. My phone buzzed with a notification about the **current snow emergency levels Ohio** was facing, and sure enough, we were under a Level 1. Now, some people think a Level 1 is nothing, but that is how you end up in a ditch on the side of I-270. Understanding **Ohio snow emergency levels** is basically a survival skill if you want to make it through January in one piece.

**What a Level 1 Roadway Advisory Actually Means**

In our state, the sheriff of each county is the one who decides on the **Ohio snow emergency levels**. A Level 1 is the most common one you will see. It basically means that the roads are hazardous because of blowing and drifting snow or ice. When you see a **snow emergency ohio** notice like this, it is not a ""stay home"" order, but it is a ""hey, wake up and pay attention"" sign. The **current snow emergency levels Ohio ( jarvisreach dot io)** provides are there to keep us from making dumb mistakes on icy bridges.

I have noticed that people in a **franklin county snow emergency level** 1 often drive like it is a sunny July afternoon. Please, do not be that person. Even if it is not a **level 2 snow emergency ohio**, the ice can be invisible. Whether you are dealing with a **hamilton county snow emergency** or just a light dusting in a **lucas county snow emergency level** 1 area, the rules for safety stay the same.

**Essential Safety Tips for Level 1 Conditions**

Even though a Level 1 is not as scary as a **level 3 snow emergency**, you still need to change how you drive. I always tell my friends that ""slow is smooth, and smooth is fast"" when the **weather columbus ohio** turns sour. If you are checking the **current snow emergency levels Ohio** and see that Level 1 is active, here is what you should do before you even put the car in gear.

**Clear Your Entire Car**

Do not just clear a tiny ""peep hole"" in your windshield. You need to see everything, and other drivers need to see you. If you are in a **franklin county snow emergency level** 1, the wind can blow snow off your roof right onto your back window, blinding you instantly. I once saw a guy in a **hamilton county snow emergency** whose roof snow slid forward onto his windshield while he was braking. He was totally blind for a few seconds. That is terrifying.

**Check With ODOT**

I always keep the **odot** website or their OHGO app open on my phone during the winter. They have cameras all over the place, so you can see the **current snow emergency levels Ohio** roads are dealing with in real time. If **odot** says the salt trucks are behind schedule, maybe wait an hour before you leave.

**Driving Techniques for Hazardous Roads**

When you are actually out in a **snow emergency ohio**, your main goal is to keep traction. Traction is everything. Even if it is not a **level 2 snow emergency ohio**, a patch of black ice does not care about your four-wheel drive. Most accidents during a **franklin county snow emergency level** 1 happen because people follow too closely. You need to triple your following distance.

* **Brake Early**: If you see a red light ahead, start slowing down way earlier than usual.
* **No Cruise Control**: Never use cruise control in a **snow emergency ohio**. You need to be in total control of the power going to your wheels.
* **Watch the Bridges**: Bridges and overpasses freeze first. Even if the **weather columbus ohio** seems okay, a bridge over a creek can be a skating rink.

I have spent a lot of time driving in **lucas county snow emergency level** 1 conditions, and the drifting snow can actually push your car sideways if you are going too fast. Just because you are not under a **level 3 snow emergency** does not mean the wind cannot ruin your day.

**Preparing Your Vehicle for Constant Changes**

Ohio winter is a roller coaster. You might start your day in a **franklin county snow emergency level** 1 and end it in a **level 2 snow emergency ohio** by the time you get off work. That is why I keep a small kit in my trunk. If the **current snow emergency levels Ohio** jump up while you are at the office, you will be glad you have an ice scraper and some sand.

A **level 3 snow emergency** is rare, but it does happen. I remember a few years ago when **hamilton county snow emergency** levels hit Level 3 and nobody could move for twenty-four hours. If you get stuck in a **lucas county snow emergency level** 1 that turns worse, you want to have a blanket and some snacks. The **columbus ohio weather** does not care about your plans.

**Respecting the Authority of the Sheriff**

One thing people forget is that **Ohio snow emergency levels** are legal declarations. While you will not get arrested in a Level 1, the sheriff is giving you a warning for a reason. If you ignore the **current snow emergency levels Ohio** and cause a crash, you might find yourself in more trouble than you thought.

I always check the **franklin county snow emergency level** before I head to the grocery store. If it looks nasty, I just stay home and watch a movie. Why risk it? The **weather columbus ohio** provides is rarely worth a fender bender. Even if it is not a **level 3 snow emergency**, your safety is more important than a gallon of milk.

**Final Thoughts on Level 1 Safety**

Navigating a **snow emergency ohio** at Level 1 is all about common sense. Slow down, clear your windows, and keep an eye on **odot** updates. The **current snow emergency levels Ohio** puts out are designed to help us, not annoy us. Whether you are in a **hamilton county snow emergency** or watching the **lucas county snow emergency level** closely, just be careful.

Ohio winters can be tough, but if you respect the **Ohio snow emergency levels**, you will be fine. Don't let a ""simple"" Level 1 catch you off guard. The **weather columbus ohio** can be a beast, so stay prepared and stay safe out there.

1r2ljih,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1r2ljih/stop_optimizing_your_mornings_youre_doing_it/,stop optimizing your mornings. you're doing it backwards,"everyone's obsessed with morning routines right? wake up at 5am, cold shower, journal, meditate, workout, green smoothie, blah blah blah

here's the thing - that's all noise

let me explain something that changed everything for me: **signals vs noise**

# the actual problem

most people set an alarm. hit snooze. snooze again. boom it's 10am and your day is already fucked. you're late, you're stressed, you're behind before you even started

the real issue isn't your morning. it's your night

# the loop that actually works

you need to get your nights right to get your mornings right. and when you get your mornings right, you'll get your nights right. it's a loop

the more you run this loop - 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x - the harder it becomes to break

sounds simple because it is. sleep early. that's literally it. no secret sauce, no hidden technique. it's all on the table. you just gotta take the pill

# signals vs noise (this is the important part)

when you wake up, your only job is to focus on signals. everything else is noise

Bill Gates does this. Tim Cook does this. not because they're special but because it works

here's what i do: i write down 3 things. that's it. 3 main tasks that HAVE to get done no matter what happens that day

* no massive to-do list
* no 47 different priorities
* no bullshit productivity theater

just 3 signals. everything else is noise

if you're doing things that aren't one of those 3 signals, you're letting noise eat your life. and it will. that's why some people have the same 24 hours but get 10x more done

# the real morning rule

your morning should be frictionless. not perfect, not optimized - frictionless

whatever your main goal is - business, studying, your actual purpose - do 1-2 activities toward that IMMEDIATELY when you wake up

don't make coffee first. don't check your phone. don't do some elaborate 90 minute routine. straight up just start

all that other stuff? that's friction. that's noise disguised as productivity

# TLDR

* fix your nights to fix your mornings
* focus only on signals (your 3 main tasks)
* eliminate noise ruthlessly
* make your morning frictionless, not perfect

1r2lhym,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicWorkplace/comments/1r2lhym/and_this_is_why_you_dont_announce_stuff_that_aint/,And This is Why You Don't Announce Stuff That Ain't Your Business,"I work at a pretty popular gas station/food service station job on the East Coast and often there are pique hours and then there are little lulls where a crew member can actually stock/do side-tasks, or use the bathroom without the managers blowing a fuze. The day in question was different, however. Another point for clarification, until the start of this year I almost exclusively worked overnights and this shift was mid-day.

  
Despite working in this location for almost a year, I never met our Regional Manager. He seemed like a pretty chill guy, no words of spite or ill will were said about him. About 3 hours in, RM walks in and everyone is freaking out. At this point I am already in the weeds since I was \*technically\* scheduled at 3 stations (MTO drinks, milkshakes, and coffee bar) and have had at least 1 order off screen (4 orders to make total) for about 20-ish min at this point. I used the headset and asked for another set of hands as needed to assist with coffee bar, since thats the easiest to ""jump in blind"". 

  
The MOD checked my codes before the RM came to talk about a promo, and I flashed am extra tidbit of information that was outside of the provided material/training (just a pattern I noticed when the promo code is used), and MOD seemed impressed. 20 minutes after he left, there were these really loud customers that came in, were screaming across the store for no reason, and just overall making a scene. (Yelling is occasionally a trigger for me so nerves were already high).

  
Then we get the notification, food safety inspection is here. A diff manager say my necklace charm not tucked in, and because I had orders to make I asked if she could help (tuck the charm in my shirt), she curtly dismissed me and said ""I have other stuff to do"". I took my gloves off, fixed the charm, and private convo'd her ""I wasnt asking fro help with orders I was asking for help with my necklace.."" then went back to work. 

  
Fast forward 2 hours later, still has been nonstop, and I feel like I am about to have an anxiety attack. I asked general ""can someone take over for me so I can step off to use the bathroom and get a drink rq (so I can ground and not panic). A coworker, E, said ""well I sometimes dont even get a drink or anything, im not even getting a break today"", no one else said anything so I just waited till my screen was clear, and announced that I was stepping away. Wasnt even gone for a total of 10 minutes (including hydrating) and it was 20-ish min before I was \*SCHEDULE\* to leave. so E comes to take over so I can stock- which I did all the mini back up fridges, except for the creamers (since I had to help with some orders were about 10 min after I was scheduled to leave). 

  
Brain fog was real, and I had to repeat myself about a product we were out of at least 5 times, so I was ready to go. The MOD saw me at the side of the counter and E, asked if either E or I can go to the register, and right before walking away E said they didnt need anything else. I go to talk to MOD and E announced on the headset ""OP was supposed to leave 10 minutes ago and having an anxiety attack or something, I guess."" 

  
On the open channel- where everyone heard it I stop dead in my tracks, and say ""Not only is it incredibly rude and disrespectful for you to announce that to where everyone can hear it, it is not your business to tell, I was on my way to tell the only person who needs that information, but thanks, I guess.""

  
I had 2 coworkers come to the break room as I m getting ready to leave to say that E was so rude and that it wasnt okay, and to check to make sure that I'm okay 

I know this isnt the first time that my mental health was discussed behind my back with such... dismissiveness (I had a diff MOD ask ""why are you still working if you have that many mental problems"" to even being told ""well im not your therapist and I asked what can we do to make it easier for you""- they asked why I had to leave a shift early because of a trigger.

1r2lfw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/sciencefiction/comments/1r2lfw6/time_travel_story_the_anchor/,Time Travel Story- The Anchor,"I put this short story together with an idea I had for time travel. Feedback would be appreciated..

**The Anchor**

The problem with time travel, Andrew Marcroft had realized, wasn’t when. It was where.

Earth hurtles through space at hundreds of kilometers per second—orbital velocity around the sun, the sun’s rotation around the galactic core, the galaxy’s drift through expanding spacetime. Stand still for one hour and you’ve actually traveled millions of kilometers. Travel back in time one year, materialize at the “same spot,” and you’d find yourself floating in the frozen void where Earth was but no longer is.

The solution came to him in the shower, early in his marriage to Lisa.

It wasn’t about coordinates. It was about connection.

Quantum entanglement, but scaled up. Molecular anchoring.

A chip of stone from the Great Pyramid isn’t just calcium carbonate. Its atoms remember their neighbors—the block they were cut from, the corner where that block sits, the molecular bonds that held for four thousand years. Use that chip as a pointer, and the displacement field doesn’t have to navigate to coordinates. It follows the pull home. Back to where those molecules belong. Entangled together.

He’d spent the next fifteen years building the machine in his basement. Fifteen years of ignoring his wife, dodging department meetings, and letting his research sabbatical extend far too long. The realization that had come to him in that shower—the beautiful, elegant solution—had become an obsession. A wedge that drove itself between him and Lisa, day by day, year by year.

She’d left when Susan was twenty, unable to handle his obsessions anymore, unable to compete with a machine in the basement. But Susan had stayed.

His daughter. Twenty-three years old now, brilliant, patient with her father’s madness. She was truly a ‘chip off the old block.’

She used to sit on his lap when she was little, watching him design the circuit boards, asking why the squiggly lines had to be just so. Now she’d bring him coffee and sandwiches he’d forget to eat, perching on the workbench while he explained quantum field theory like other fathers explained carburetors.

“So you need something old to go somewhere in the past?” she’d asked one evening, swinging her legs.

“Exactly.”

“And something from now to come back to today?”

“That’s the tricky part.” He struggled for an example. “Take something that has been where you want to return to… say, like a chip of the big boulder in our garden—ordinary granite, flecked with mica. It’s been in this yard probably since the ice age, Susan. It knows its place. Something like that would be my return anchor. Split off a piece, take it with me. The parts want to reunite. They’re drawn back to each other. So I come back here. To now.”

She’d frowned. “But what if you want to stay back there?”

“Can’t. The machine stays here in the ‘now.’ I’ll have no machine with me to control in the past. I have to program an automatic return window—say, five hours. Then it auto-recalls. A safety feature. Without that, it would be like jumping into a temporal abyss.”

“What if you don’t want to return?”

He’d looked at her then, really looked. She was smiling, but her eyes were serious. Worried.

“Then I’d be an idiot,” he’d said. “Everything I care about is right here.”

She’d kissed his forehead and went upstairs.

That was four months before the picnic.

—-

Anaphylaxis.

The word was clinical, cold. It didn’t capture the panic in her eyes when her throat closed. Didn’t capture the way she’d clawed at her neck, the hives blooming across her skin like some fast-motion nightmare. Didn’t capture how Andrew had screamed for someone, anyone, to have an EpiPen while his daughter suffocated in his arms.

They found out later it was something in the artisan honey. Some rare pollen. An allergy no one knew she had because she’d never encountered it before.

The funeral was small. His ex-wife was there of course, pain evident; it riddled every fiber of her body. And yet she couldn’t stand beside Andrew. Andrew stood by the casket and felt nothing. Numbness had settled over him like frost. It was the loss of connection that hurt the most.

His friend David—a stonemason—had offered to carve the headstone himself. He used the granite boulder from the garden. When it was installed, David had given him a gift.

“Here, I made you something from the same stone,” he said, handing him a paperweight, beautifully inscribed with Susan’s life details.

Andrew held it, feeling the weight. It was nice, but he needed a portable connection beyond his desk. He took the paperweight to a jeweler and had a small, pea-sized corner sawn off and set in a gold pendant on a thin chain. He wore it every day—his molecular tether. It was his anchor, connecting him to Susan’s memory, her resting place, and the work they shared together.

—-

When the test day came…

If Susan were still alive…

Andrew may not have had the courage to initiate the start sequence, but with her gone, what was there to lose?

The destination anchor was easy. It was a souvenir from a vacation in England. A fragment of Tudor-era masonry he’d quietly pocketed after a lorry backed into a historic wall near the Tower of London. Now it was a key.

His return anchor was the pendant he was wearing, and the stone paperweight on his desk, now missing the small corner from its bottom edge.

He’d set the calibration for 1888. Victorian London.

The displacement field activated with a sound like tearing silk.

Reality twisted.

And then he was standing in an alley that stank of horse manure and coal smoke, his twenty-first-century clothes drawing stares.

London. 1888. It worked.

He’d started walking.

Five hours. He had five hours to exist in a world where Susan had never been born, never died. Five hours before the recall yanked him home.

He spent them wandering. Marveling at the Thames, smelling the aromas of meat pies being sold in a shop. He stood outside the construction site of Tower Bridge.

That’s when the boy attacked him.

Couldn’t have been more than fourteen. A flash of blade, a cold, hard scrape against Andrew’s neck, and before Andrew registered the violence, the boy was gone, swallowed by the London crowds—along with his coin purse and…

The pendant.

His anchor. His way home.

Andrew stood in the middle of the street, Victorian Londoners flowing around him like water around a stone, and felt the first spike of real fear.

Without the pendant, without that molecular connection to his own time… where would the recall take him?

He checked his watch—ninety minutes left. He searched, desperate.

Thirty minutes.

He found himself back in the alley where he’d arrived, breathing hard. The recall was automatic. Irreversible.

The displacement field activated.

Reality tore.

—-

The concrete was cold against his knees. The smell of motor oil. Sawdust. His basement.

Andrew lifted his head, gasping, disoriented. The machine stood before him, cold and unused. Something was wrong. This wasn’t the finished version.

This was the machine from before.

“Daddy?”

His heart stopped.

“Dad? You okay down there? Sounded like you dropped something.”

Her voice. From upstairs. Real. Alive.

She appeared at the bottom of the stairs, and Andrew’s world tilted. Susan. Twenty-three years old and breathing and *here*.

In her hand was his pen.

“I finished filling in my application,” she said. “Thanks for letting me borrow this.” She glanced at the workbench, spotted something. “Oh! The cap—right where I left it.”

She picked up the silver cap from among the clutter and clicked it onto the pen.

Andrew’s hand went automatically to his pocket. The pocket where he’d carried that pen—capless, lost without its other half—for months after her death. He’d had it with him in 1888, he was certain.

His pocket was empty.

He stared at Susan. At the pen in her hand. Whole. Complete.

The molecular anchor. He’d created it without knowing.

That morning—*this* morning—she’d come downstairs and borrowed his pen to fill in her university application. She’d left the cap on the bench. In his timeline, the cap had been swallowed by the mess on his workbench, lost forever. He’d carried the capless pen ever since.

The displacement field, without the pendant, had latched onto the next strongest anchor. The pen. But not to reunite it with its cap in some distant future. It had pulled him back to the moment of first separation. To the morning Susan borrowed it.

“Dad?” She was frowning now, concern creasing her face. “Seriously, you look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

He couldn’t speak. He crossed the basement in three strides and pulled her into his arms.

“Dad!” She laughed, surprised, the pen still clutched in her hand. “What’s going on?”

“I love you.” The words came out strangled. “I love you so much.”

She pulled back, studying his face. Her eyes—so like her mother’s—were worried. “Did something happen?”

Andrew looked past her, to the calendar on the wall at the top of the stairs. May 2023.

The funeral had been in July 2024.

“I’m fine,” he managed. “Just… felt like I needed a hug.”

She squeezed his hand. “Well, you’re being weird, but okay.” She held out the pen. “Here. And I really need to go—post office closes at five and I have to mail this application today.”

He took the pen. Felt its weight. Complete now. Whole.

She gave him an odd look and said, “I’ve got to go.”

The door closed behind her.

Andrew stood in the empty basement and felt the realization crash over him.

He had approximately four hours before the field might lock onto his original timeline and pull him forward again.

Unless he made sure that timeline never happened.

He looked at the machine, half-finished. If he left it intact, he’d eventually finish it. And if he finished it, Susan would die.

He picked up the sledgehammer.

The first blow cracked the quantum array. The second crushed the calibration housing. Andrew swung again. Again. The molecular anchor assembly—the heart of the machine—broke apart like cheap pottery.

He dropped the sledgehammer among the wreckage. The machine was scrap.

Would this work?

He had to leave something behind. A failsafe.

Andrew climbed the stairs.

In the kitchen, he found paper and with his pen he started writing.

*Susan—*

*This is going to sound insane, but you need to trust me. You have an allergy. I don’t know to what exactly—some rare pollen, maybe something in honey from specific flowers. It can kill you. You need to get tested. You need to carry an* *EpiPen*\*. Always. Please.\*

*I know this sounds paranoid. I know I seem crazy right now. But trust me. Please, sweetheart. Trust me.*

*Love, Dad*

He left the note on the counter, weighted down with her coffee mug. If the recall yanked him away, the note would be his final, desperate act of intervention.

He kept waiting for the tearing-silk sound. For reality to twist and yank him away.

It didn’t come.

Five hours passed. Nothing.

Andrew sat on the basement stairs, surrounded by the wreckage of his life’s work, and started laughing. He’d broken the loop. He was staying.

He retrieved the note and tore it into pieces. It wouldn’t be needed. He’d be here to warn her himself. Every day. For as long as it took.

—-

Eighteen months later, the house was quieter now. His workshop had been converted into a study. The obsession that had consumed him was gone, smashed to rubble and carted away. Nothing would distract him from what was most important ever again.

At a farmer’s market, they walked together.

Susan looked at a jar of artisan honey from a local beekeeper. She frowned at the label.

“Mom, what do you think?” Susan asked, holding up the jar. “Wildflower blend. Is that okay?”

Lisa smiled, turning toward Andrew, her eyes meeting his for a warm, steady moment. It had taken time—months of conversations, of proving he’d changed, of showing up. But she’d come back. They’d come back.

“Ask your father, sweetie. He’s the scientist.”

Andrew looked at the label. Studied it.

“No,” he said, his voice easy and clear. “Put it back. Get the clover honey from the store. Safer.”

Susan shrugged and returned the jar to the table.

Andrew looked at Lisa. They weren’t fully back together yet, but they were talking, even laughing at times, and sharing moments like this. He felt the weight of the pen in his pocket. His anchor. Not to the past, but to this moment. This reconciliation.

He had saved his daughter’s life. And in doing so, he had accomplished his greatest work: he had found his way back—not through spacetime, but to his family.

To where he belonged.",2,1770875311.0,sciencefiction,0,1.0,False

I’ve been a SBUX barista for coming up five years next month. I started out at a busy store for the first two, then transferred to a cute cafe-only which I loved but it got shut down a few months ago, and now I’m at a different drive store. I’ve been sick of the Siren for a while now, and the closure of my store with barely any notice was really disheartening and frustrating. Every new stupid policy or drop has been fraying my nerves even more.

I’m considering taking an offer at a new local cafe in which I could also cross-train to make cocktails, but they can only afford to pay \~$10 right now. At the Bux I’m making $16.50. (They said their tips have been pretty good for their first week though.) They have manual espresso machines for real specialty coffee, and as much as I hate the Bux, I actually do enjoy crafting coffee and chatting with people. I’d love to learn how to bartend and have some manual espresso bar knowledge in case I want to move on to other specialty shops or bars in the future, too. Plus, every shift at Starbs has me dreaming of putting in my two weeks anyway, and I don’t really have a lot of hours since I hate being there (and to focus on school.)

I’m in college, graduating next semester with my BFA, but I still live with family so I don’t have to worry about rent, just tuition, car insurance, supplies and whatever else I buy for myself. I’m undecided but really thinking about trying it out. Now would be the time I guess. Any advice or opinions? Those who have worked in specialty cafes or even cafe-bars, do you feel you’ve gained valuable experience and skills from it, and how much do you make?

1r2la2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoverPetSitting/comments/1r2la2a/feeling_kinda_sad_after_a_bad_ending_to_doggy/,feeling kinda sad after a bad ending to doggy daycare,"Hi y'all, I do Rover part-time/on the side since I work remote so it's nice to have a little companion throughout the day. I got a request to do doggy daycare for this woman and her 9 month old pup. She was looking for someone to take care of them during the weekday and I thought it was perfect since that's what I was looking for too.

*tldr: excited about this trial run. dog was described as nippy. shy, anxious dog who warmed up throughout the day but then bit me when i was trying to put on his harness and i'm sad about it because i feel like i did something wrong.*

We did a meet and greet at this patch of grass where people let their dogs go off leash. where the pup was having fun chasing the other dogs. When he came up to us, I pet him and gave him lots of attention. We talked about his previous doggy daycare experience, his daily routine, behavior, etc. She said that his previous doggy daycare was with a woman who would do daycare at her house and would have up to four dogs there but had to drop him because of extenuating circumstances. She also wanted her dog to have another dog at the place so they could play together and get out some of his energy, since she said he was pretty high energy. I don't have a dog and in my profile, I specify one-on-one pet care because I don't have a pet and I said that and she said that was fine, we'll do a trial tomorrow. She told me that he can be a little nippy and enjoys gnawing on shoes which I totally get, he's a puppy and will redirect him from it.

The next day rolled around and she met me at the dog park again where we do the drop off. She walked away and the puppy barked and got nervous. His legs were shaking. After she's out of our line of sight, I took him back to my place, an apartment, where I can still see he's nervous/scared - his legs were still shaking like thin branches in a storm. He started pacing around and I took off his jacket and harness so he would be more comfy. I fed him treats and gave him my hand for him to smell. I tried to pet him but he growled at me so I thought he's just anxious/overstimulated and I just let him do his own thing. He walked around the apartment sniffing things, drinking water out of the dish I set for him, looking out the windows. I fed him kibble out of my hand for a little bit but he lost interest. I scattered some treats around the place if he wanted it. I then got out some of his toys and treats and set them out for him if he wanted to play.

The morning goes by and he's played with some of his toys and found his favorite spots to lay. I tried to pet him again and he growled at me and barked, so I backed off. I gave him some more treats and try to play with him but he's not into it. He laid down in his spots and a couple of times, he jumped up on the couch next to me and snuggled up for a few minutes before he left to lay elsewhere. He played with his toys for a little bit before losing interest. I told his owner about his growling and she said he's just scared, it's a new place, which I understand so I'm just going to let him be, do his own thing. His legs have stopped shaking at least.

At noon, I took him out. I put on his jacket and harness with no problem and we walked around for like 15 minutes. I ran around outside with him, let him chase me, I chased him, and we go back inside. I don't let him off leash. After that, he seemed to warm up to me more. He'd lay next to me on the couch, he'd sit by my feet, he'd engaging in play together - I rolled a ball around and he'd chase after it. When I get back to work, he'd sleep - so much so he snored. At one point, he even rolled over on his back and let me pet his belly and his head. Closer to his pick up though, his anxiety kicked back up because he'd look out the windows. One of them faces the dog park that we met at so he sat at the window watching it.

5:30pm rolls around and his owner texts me that their son is picking up the dog at the dog park we met at. I got the jacket and harness and that's when he starts freaking out. When I grabbed the jacket and go towards him, he ran around the coffee table and jumped on the couch. I didn't think it'd be a problem because when I put the jacket on him earlier, he was on the couch. I get the jacket on him and when I tried to put the harness on, he growled at me so I backed off with the harness around him but not buckled. I watched him for a couple of minutes and he jumped off the couch and shook. I walked up to him again to try to buckle the harness. That time, he lets me grab the buckle but freaks out and barks loudly before biting my hand. I let go and I'm thinking, *I just have to get this on because his owner's son is downstairs*, so I grabbed it again and this time, he bites me even harder. It's not nipping, it's like growl, bark, bite. I understand he's probably not in the best mood so I let go because I can't get the harness on and he starts running around in circles, trying to get it off. I watched him for a couple of minutes before I approached him, slowly. He barked at me again and ran away.

At this point, I'm not sure what to do since I haven't seen this behavior before so I text his owner his son has to come upstairs to get the dog, but his son doesn't want to so he's going to come. I grabbed the harness as he's barking at me and I took it off. The jacket became undone so once again, I got close to him and he growled at me and tried to bite me as I grab the collar of the jacket and unvelcro it from his neck. After taking off all his things, he became perfectly fine. He came up to me, rubbed his body against my legs, even went between my legs, and laid on the couch. So I think he's ready to try again but as soon as I grabbed his jacket, he growled, barked, and ran away. I don't want to be bit again so I just throw the jacket on the ground and wait for his owner to come.

During this time, he's again, cuddly and affectionate again. He's rubbing up against my legs, I go to the couch and he lays down next to me, he's following me everywhere. But then I try the jacket one more time and he freaks out again so I stopped. I got all his stuff near the front door and when his owner arrives, he bolts to the door and is very excited about seeing his owner. He's jumping up on him, rubbing his body against his legs, very happy. He gets the harness on him no problem. I told him that we had a great day up until the whole jacket/harness situation and he said that the dog can just get a little moody. His owner asked me if I wanted to watch him weekly and I declined because honestly, I was scared when he bit me and I just felt like I was doing something wrong 😭. I've watched so many puppies, dogs, and senior dogs throughout my life and I've never had one bite like this before so I'm a little sad about it all. Granted, I shouldn't have tried so much after the first time he told me he wasn't feeling it, but I felt like there was pressure to get him down to the dog park. If there was something I did wrong, I'd love to know.

My numbers are overall pretty good but my doctor does not like my potassium. It’s up again. It was just under 5 and now it’s up to 5.4 and I’m not understanding why. I avoid all high potassium foods. I do not drink orange juice or eat oranges much maybe a glass a month I drink nothing but black coffee, water and occasional diet soda and on the weekends, I’ll have a couple Michelob ultras.  He basically told me high potassium foods are lentils, oranges , avocados, bananas. I really don’t eat these. You know, looking at the list of high potassium foods I do eat potatoes, which I guess I’ll have to stop and cherry tomatoes in my salad. I do eat green, leafy vegetables, . I drink a couple cups of black coffee a day. He is now putting me on a powder. He told me to drink a packet with water every other day. It’s called lokelma( sp) pharmacy is out. They have to order it so I’ll start that in a couple days. I have really cleaned up my diet the past six months and carry on my 44 ounce water bottle which I drink at least one and a half per day.

So I guess my body is just holding onto potassium? On a decent note, my GFR is 57. Cystatin C is .76 creatinine is a little high 1.14. He said my kidneys are functioning at 80%. Blood pressure is always excellent. 112/68 . He also told me that more athletic muscular people always have a lower GFR.

1r2l3lu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee_Shop/comments/1r2l3lu/best_coffee_for_workfromcafé_days/,Best Coffee for Work-From-Café Days,"In the ""work-from-café"" lifestyle has evolved from a passing fad to a fundamental aspect of the contemporary workplace. The neighborhood coffee shop acts as a second office for anyone working as a freelance developer, creative strategist, or corporate nomad. It provides a carefully balanced combination of background noise, community, and, most crucially, high-octane fuel.

But when there's a deadline approaching, not all brews are equal. A mid-afternoon sugar slump that disrupts productivity or the feared ""caffeine crash"" can result from selecting the incorrect beverage. A planned approach to your order is necessary to optimize your output.

**1. The Plan: Aligning Your To-Do List with Your Coffee**  
The type of job at hand determines the ideal coffee for a given session. Are you sorting through administrative emails that demand consistent, endurance-based energy, or are you working on profound tasks that demand laser-like focus?

**For Intense Concentration: The Long Black or Americano** In situations where you must reach a ""flow state,"" stability is essential. Without the heavy lipids of milk or the insulin-spiking effects of sugar, the Americano (espresso diluted with hot water) and its bolder cousin, the Long Black (espresso poured over hot water), offer a clean, high-caffeine punch.

* **Why it works:** It releases energy continuously. Caffeine enters your system effectively because there is no milk to slow down digestion, keeping your mind alert for difficult problem-solving.

**Cortado or Flat White for Creative Brainstorming**

A little indulgence goes a long way in creative endeavors. With a stronger espresso to milk ratio than a latte, a flat white or cortado has a strong flavor profile that ""wakes up"" the tongue.

* **Why it works**: The tiny bit of micro-foam gives a sensory experience that can serve as a mental ""reset"" when you're having trouble coming up with ideas. Additionally, the milk's protein and fat slow down the absorption of caffeine, avoiding the jitters that might interfere with a sensitive creative process.

**For Endurance (The Whole Day): Pour-Over or Batch Brew**  
Avoid using the espresso machine for your first cup of coffee if you want to be at the café for three or more hours. A single shot of espresso often has less caffeine per ounce than a premium Batch Brew (drip coffee) or a manual Pour-Over (V60, Chemex).

The ""slow burner"" is the reason it works."" Instead of the abrupt boost in alertness that comes with a rapid espresso, you can enjoy a big drip coffee over the course of 45 minutes. [read more](https://kotabagh.oonchadana.com/)",1,1770874200.0,Coffee_Shop,2,0.66,False

Want to share ideas I've actually executed for my clients last February. Steal what works for you:

**1. Themed inclusive roundups** 

* Curate collections that tie into the holiday without excluding single people: A grocery delivery client of mine featured cakes ""for couples AND for treating yourself."" 
* A liquor store chain did a brilliant ""drinks for every stage of a relationship"" - from first date butterflies to comfortable couch nights. 
* A balloon delivery service put together Valentine's bouquets made of balloons. 

All of these drove solid click-through

**2. Tease a bonus with every purchase**

One of my coffee shop clients ran a ""free drink if you kiss your partner at the counter"" promo — engagement was insane. The intrigue element consistently outperforms a standard discount in tests.

**3. Gift guide emails segmented by recipient**

People genuinely struggle with gift ideas. I helped a jewelry brand send targeted ""gifts for her"" roundups to their male segment, and a cleaning service client sent a ""what she actually wants on V-Day"" email to men. Worked great

**4. Limited-edition**

Scarcity + holiday = urgency. A pizza chain client created a Valentine's combo meal that came with a limited-edition greeting card. A coffee shop launched a special Valentine's drink series. These aren't just gimmicks - limited drops create FOMO that moves inventory fast

**5. Free gifts for subscribers (not buyers)**

Give something away with zero purchase required. A book store I work with gave away free books to their Instagram subscribers on Feb 14. A fashion brand released a free sticker pack for messaging apps. Low cost, high goodwill, and it grows your list

**6. Entertainment-first content**

Not every email needs a CTA to the shop. A language online school sent a quiz on romantic vocabulary. A travel search engine created a full ""travel horoscope"" matching zodiac signs to destinations. A ticket service made a fun roundup of cities with traditionally male names. These emails don't sell directly, but they build the kind of brand affinity that pays off long-term

**7. Shareable Valentine's cards**

Create branded digital valentines subscribers can send to friends and partners via messaging apps. A restaurant chain designed valentines with food pairings, a travel service made ""traveler's valentines."" This is organic reach - every share is a potential new subscriber

**8. Gamification and  interactive mechanics**

A shoe brand client built a ""pop the hearts"" mini-game in their app. A streaming service created a ""TV character Tinder"" where users swiped on fictional characters and got a promo code after playing. Gamified promos consistently outperform static ones because the discount feels earned

**9. Giveaways and contests**

A grocery chain asked subscribers to submit their best ""love quotes"" - winners got their words printed on actual chocolate bars. Low-friction entry + desirable prize = massive participation

**10. Brand partnerships / cross-promos**

Two fashion brands I worked with did a joint campaign - gift cards from both brands, a giveaway, and co-branded ""date outfit"" emails (outfits for a skating date, restaurant date, cozy night in). Doubles your reach, splits the cost

**11. Video greetings**

A coffee shop client posted a short, funny video inviting people to try their Valentine's dessert. Video in email (or linked from email) gets 2-3x the engagement of static images in my experience. Doesn't need to be expensive — a 15-second clip with personality beats a polished ad

**12. Themed workshops and tutorials**

A fashion brand posted short makeup tutorial reels tied to ""date night looks."" A home decor retailer could do ""how to set a romantic dinner table."" You're giving value for free, which builds trust and keeps your brand top of mind

**14. Skip Valentine's entirely (strategically)**

This is underrated. One client rebranded Feb 14 as ""Friends Day."" A grocery delivery service turned it into ""New Products Day."" A travel search engine sent single subscribers ""things to do solo this weekend"" - adventure ideas, spa trips, bucket-list destinations. If your audience skews toward people who might feel excluded by couple-centric messaging, this approach can actually outperform a traditional V-Day campaign

**One more thing that's easy to get wrong:** inclusivity. So keep your copy warm but neutral

V-Day is a sensitive trigger. If you send ""surprise your sweetheart!"" to someone going through a brutal breakup, you've probably lost that customer

tbh, the best move is to lean into universal themes like self-care, friendship, love of style, love of good food, or just treating yourself

1r2kyw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1r2kyw5/aitah_for_crying_during_the_first_predator_movie/,AITAH for crying during the first Predator movie?,"So… this is humiliating, but the situation blew up way more than I expected, and now I’m questioning everything. So here we go.

I (22F) recently moved states and have been trying really hard to build a solid friend group for a whole semester. I finally found a little crew of college friends who do Saturday movie nights, It’s become our routine to go and buy snacks and arguing over who picks the movie, the whole thing. I genuinely thought this was the start of something true and I was so excited. 

So, last week they picked Predator because I’d never seen it. Anyway, about 55 minutes in — yes, I checked the timestamp— there’s a scene where one of the humans ( the doctor) is running from one slim alien and out of nowhere, my brain decides to go full philosophical meltdown.

I suddenly thought: “What if the alien was trying to communicate but literally couldn’t? What if he got killed just because he didn’t speak human language? What If he was yelling for help and got shot because he was confused by a threat”. 

And that thought hit me like a mother$$& trailer. 

I didn’t tear up. I sobbed. 

Ladies and gentlemen, it was embarrassing, Like, ugly, can’t breathe, my-mother-just-died sobbing. 

Usually before my period , just a day before I become extremely emotional and, yes, irrational, Please Its nothing out of proportion, it's just hormones messing me up, hope you all get the idea and Im not the only one suffering this. 

I was so overwhelmed that I paused the movie — again, I had the remote because I’m the mom friend — and tried to explain what was happening in my brain. But I was crying so I could barely form words. Let's point I wasn't screaming, just fat tears and mumbling. They just stared at me. 

My friend (aka Lili) immediately got annoyed. She reached for the remote very brusquely, sighed dramatically, and tried to take over. I let her, but I was still trying to explain between sobs. I didn’t catch everything she said because I was mid-breakdown, but I definitely heard: “It’s just a movie” “What’s wrong with you?””You’re acting crazy bitch”. Others just laughed. 

Which… yeah. That stung. I get it can be... Strange, but I feel so unexpectedly sad. 

For context, my period had literally started the day before. I was already emotional, bloated, and one TikTok away from crying over an influencer wearing shoes. My brain was connecting the Predator to animals that get killed because humans assume stuff about them, and it spiraled into this whole empathy overload.

I told them I didn’t want to keep watching because I was too overwhelmed, and I went to the kitchen to watch Chinese TikTok until I calmed down. One friend checked on me, but the rest stayed in the living room and finished the movie. Don't get me wrong, I didn't wanted to push the whole group on me but… it feel that empathy was out of the room that night. I waited for them to leave all together. 

I figured it was awkward, sure, but not friendship‑ending awkward.

Apparently I was wrong.

The next day, I saw on Instagram that they all went out for coffee together. Cute little outing. No invite. I asked one of the guys about it, trying to sound casual and unbothered. He was honest — which I do appreciate — and said the vibe the night was so uncomfortable that no one thought inviting me would be a good idea. He said it was “for the best”and probably needed a check-up. 

That honestly crushed me. I moved states, I’ve been trying so HARD to build a real friend group since covid, and suddenly I’m the weird emotional girl who ruined movie night.

I absolutely get the idea of a girl crying in a simple movie is strange, but dude, hear me out and don't excluded me for my hormones. 

Later that same day I texted Lili specifically because she seemed the most irritated, and she did NOT sugarcoat anything. She told me: I was “strange” I needed to go check a psychiatrist, crying out of nowhere was abnormal,  I “made the whole night about myself” and justify it with my period and didn't thought about the group feelings, Pausing the movie to sob was “unbearable”,  I seemed “unstable” to hang out with them and that the whole group felt uncomfortable.

I tried explaining that I was extra sensitive, and I did not plan to cry in the most silly way possible but she basically dismissed it.

Now I’m sitting here feeling embarrassed, confused, and honestly a little heartbroken. I know crying during Predator is… not normal. But I didn’t do it on purpose. I didn’t plan to hijack the night. I had a genuine emotional reaction, and instead of compassion, I got mocked and excluded.

Which is irrational, I cry, I didn't kill anyone, why is everyone avoiding me and possibly talking behind my back? 

So now I’m wondering did I actually ruin the night? Or are they being unnecessarily harsh about a moment of vulnerability?",1,1770873766.0,AITAH,5,0.67,False

1r2kwwg,https://i.redd.it/6frkqvt500jg1.png,I run a small business almost entirely through Claude Code.,"I run a kink education and community organization in Austin called Kinky Coffee. Events, workshops, a Discord server, a web app, a website — the usual small org stuff but with no staff. It's basically me and Claude Code.

# Here's what I build and manage with Claude

*Discord bot* — Custom Python bot running 24/7 on a cloud server. Member onboarding, incident reporting, moderation case tracking, daily and weekly community metrics with charts, event announcements. Eight modules, all built and maintained through Claude.

*Archetype Quiz (quiz.kinky.coffee)* — React frontend, PHP backend, MySQL database. Full analytics dashboard with daily email reports. Email signup flow with archetype-based playbook delivery. Automated deployment pipeline to staging and production. The whole thing — UI, API, analytics, deployment — built through Claude.

*Website (kinky.coffee)* — Claude manages pages, publishes content, handles plugins. Need a new policy page? I ask and it creates the page, writes the content, adds it to the footer nav, and publishes it.

*Event Updates* — Five recurring events automated through browser control. Claude opens Chrome, navigates to the event form, and fills it out like a person — types each character with variable delays, pauses before the description field like it's thinking, moves quickly through dropdowns, waits before hitting submit. I say ""post all March events"" and it calculates every date (including our biweekly alternating schedule), shows me a calendar, then posts them one by one.

## The knowledge base

I loaded in everything — business docs, brand strategy, legal filings, budgets, policies, educational materials, personal journals, chat archives going back years.

From all of that, Claude derived:
- A **personal profile** capturing my writing voice, personality, and communication patterns — when it drafts something for me it actually sounds like me. I compare what it writes against what I actually send and it learns from the differences
- A **brand voice guide** with specific tone rules and language dos and don'ts
- A **brand strategy document** with mission, vision, audience profiles, and positioning
- A **visual identity system** with colors, typography, and component patterns used across all the digital products


# Skills
Specialized skills for document generation (Word docs, PDFs, spreadsheets, slide decks), research and synthesis, browser automation, bot deployment, TDD, code review, debugging, and brainstorming.

# Tools and Plugins
**Wispr Flow**
I use Wispr Flow (voice-to-text) so I'm not typing prompts. I ramble for 2-3 minutes while scrolling through whatever Claude just produced, react out loud, change my mind halfway through, contradict myself. What comes out is messy stream-of-consciousness a human wouldn't know what to do with. Claude parses all of it and executes. It's closer to thinking out loud with a collaborator than writing instructions for a tool.

**Claude-Mem (plugin)**
It has persistent memory across sessions so when I pick something up Tuesday that I was working on Sunday, it already knows what happened.

**Superpowers (plugin)**
Amazing plugin for brainstorming, planning, and implementation. Plus a few other goodies. 

**Other Plugins**
- Claude Code Setup
- Claude Notifications Go
- OpenAI-Images - Custom skill to generate images using OpenAI's API

**Real examples**

> ""We need a formal incident response policy. Review our brand values and existing policies, then draft something that fits who we are.""
>
> It read the brand strategy, reviewed existing docs, and produced a two-tier incident response framework. Tier 1 for awkward behavior (especially from neurodivergent or new members) with education-first responses. Tier 2 for actual safety concerns with enforcement. Then converted it to a Word doc, published it on kinky.coffee, and added it to the footer nav.

> ""I'm meeting with a grant writer next week. I need to walk in prepared.""
>
> 350-line briefing covering: which grants we qualify for, realistic dollar ranges, a ranked list of specific opportunities with deadlines, how to frame the work for different funders, a fiscal sponsor strategy, similar orgs that have been funded, and 19 questions to ask the grant writer.

> ""Figure out insurance for Kinky Coffee.""
>
> Researched carriers, got quotes from four providers, compared coverage. When our first carrier quietly declined to actually cover our business activities despite selling us a policy, Claude caught it, documented the issue, pulled the chat transcript as evidence, and pivoted to specialty carriers.

Must've been a good move to take her watch browsing BEFORE pen browsing because when she saw the price on this she said ""wow, that's not bad!"" and bought this for me to commemorate an upcoming occasion 😂

Been carrying this every day for the last week. The matching little case makes it super easy to throw into a jacket pocket or bag. The nib is surprisingly bouncy and it's enjoyable to write with despite the small size. Has a great weight to it and fits well in my hand when posted. The ivory lacquer and coral emblem are gorgeous in person. A clipless pocket pen wasn't on my wishlist, but this really spoke to me in-hand and I couldn't be happier.

1r2kv85,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menscomeback/comments/1r2kv85/how_to_design_your_life_for_peak_creativity/,# How to Design Your Life for Peak Creativity (Science-Backed),"Most people think they're not creative. They blame their jobs, their schedules, their exhaustion. But here's what I've learned after deep diving into books, research, and countless hours of productivity podcasts: the problem isn't that you lack creativity, it's that your entire life is designed to kill it.

We're living in a system that rewards busyness over depth, distraction over focus, and consumption over creation. Your brain is fried from 8 hours of meetings, your attention span is shredded from endless scrolling, and you're wondering why brilliant ideas don't just appear. The thing is, creativity isn't some mystical gift, it's a byproduct of how you structure your days, protect your energy, and feed your mind. The good news? You can redesign everything.

I spent the last year researching this obsessively (books, neuroscience studies, interviews with creators), and these are the frameworks that actually moved the needle.

# Protect your morning brain like it's gold

Your brain has a finite amount of creative juice each day, and most of us waste it scrolling Twitter before we've even had coffee. Research shows that the first 2-3 hours after waking are when your prefrontal cortex (the part responsible for complex thinking and creativity) is firing hardest.

**What to do:** Block your mornings for deep creative work ONLY. No meetings, no emails, no Slack. Just you and the thing you're building. Cal Newport talks about this in [Deep Work](https://a.co/d/070NyCso), where he breaks down how the most prolific creators guard their attention like their lives depend on it (because their work does). This book made me completely rethink how I structure my calendar. Best productivity book I've read, hands down.

**Bonus move:** Try the Opal app to block distracting sites during your creative hours. It's like having a personal bouncer for your focus. Way better than relying on willpower alone.

# Your inputs determine your outputs

You can't create something interesting if you're only consuming garbage. Rick Rubin's *The Creative Act: A Way of Being* completely blew my mind on this, he's produced everyone from Johnny Cash to the Red Hot Chili Peppers and his entire philosophy is about staying open to inspiration. The book won tons of awards and honestly reads like a meditation on creativity itself. He talks about how the quality of what you let into your brain directly shapes what comes out.

**Curate your information diet:** Follow interesting people on Twitter who share sharp ideas. Listen to podcasts that challenge your thinking (I'm obsessed with *The Tim Ferriss Show* for deconstructing how top performers operate). Read books that aren't just self help fluff.

If you want to go deeper on creativity and productivity but feel overwhelmed by the reading list, there's this app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been pretty useful. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, it pulls from books like the ones mentioned here, plus research papers and expert interviews on creative performance, and turns them into personalized audio learning. You type in something specific like ""unlock creative thinking as a burned-out professional"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan with episodes you can customize from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives. The voice options are genuinely addictive, there's even a smoky, laid-back style that makes complex neuroscience feel like a conversation. Makes it way easier to absorb this stuff during commutes or walks instead of just adding more unread books to the pile.

**Make space for boredom:** This sounds counterintuitive but your best ideas come when you're NOT consuming anything. Long walks without your phone. Showers. Staring at the ceiling. Your brain needs whitespace to connect dots.

# Creativity needs recovery, not just hustle

The internet glorifies the ""grind 24/7"" mentality, but neuroscience tells a different story. Your brain consolidates ideas and makes creative connections during rest, especially during sleep and low-focus activities. Daniel Pink's *When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing* dives into how our energy and creativity fluctuate throughout the day (he's a bestselling author and former speechwriter who's obsessed with human performance research). Insanely good read if you want to understand your natural rhythms.

**Schedule recovery blocks:** Just like you'd schedule a meeting, block time for walks, naps, or just doing absolutely nothing. Use the Finch app if you need help building this habit, it's a cute little self care companion that actually makes you want to take breaks.

**Protect your sleep:** Nothing tanks creativity faster than running on 5 hours of sleep. Your brain literally can't form new neural connections properly when you're exhausted.

# Create constraints to force innovation

Unlimited options actually kill creativity. When you have all the time in the world and infinite possibilities, you freeze. Austin Kleon's *Steal Like an Artist* is a tiny book that will make you question everything you think you know about originality. It's a quick read but packed with exercises and mindset shifts. He argues that creativity thrives under constraints, whether that's time limits, specific formats, or artificial rules you set for yourself.

**Try this:** Give yourself 30 minutes to create something, ANYTHING. A sketch, a 200 word essay, a voice note with an idea. The deadline forces your brain out of perfectionism and into action.

**Steal smart:** Stop trying to be 100% original. Study creators you admire, deconstruct what makes their work compelling, then remix it into your own voice. That's not copying, that's how every artist in history has learned.

# Build a system, not just motivation

Motivation is unreliable. Some days you'll wake up fired up, most days you won't. The creators who actually ship work consistently aren't more motivated, they just have better systems. James Clear breaks this down perfectly in [Atomic Habits](https://a.co/d/0fuQzOLy), the book sold over 15 million copies because it actually works. His framework is about making creativity so automatic that you do it even when you don't feel like it.

**Start stupidly small:** Don't aim to write 2000 words a day if you're starting from zero. Write 50 words. Draw for 5 minutes. The point is consistency, not intensity.

**Track your streaks:** Use an app like Streaks or just mark an X on a calendar every day you create something. Watching the chain grow is weirdly motivating.

# Protect your energy from energy vampires

Your creativity is directly tied to your energy levels, and certain people, situations, and commitments will drain you dry. This isn't selfish, it's strategic. If you're spending all your emotional bandwidth managing drama or doing work that feels meaningless, there's nothing left for your actual creative projects.

**Audit your calendar:** What meetings could be emails? What social obligations are you doing out of guilt? What projects are you clinging to that don't excite you anymore? Cut ruthlessly.

**Say no more:** Every yes to something mediocre is a no to something potentially brilliant. Protect your time like it's your most valuable asset (because it is).

The truth is, you already have everything you need to be wildly creative. You just have to stop designing your life around other people's priorities and start building it around your own. It's not about finding more time, it's about protecting the time you have and structuring it so your brain can actually do what it does best: make surprising connections, solve interesting problems, and create things that didn't exist before.

Your job isn't to become someone else. It's to remove everything that's blocking you from being yourself.",2,1770873438.0,Menscomeback,0,1.0,False
1r2kuz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NDIS/comments/1r2kuz4/support_worker_bills_4_hours_but_leaves_early/,"Support Worker bills 4 hours but leaves early. Says it’s ""not worth her while"" to work less. Is this financial abuse?","I’m pretty annoyed after having a meeting with my mum’s care plan coordinator and her support worker.

My mum has a worker who comes 3 times a week for 4-hour shifts. This 4-hour block started years ago when Mum was still mobile and could go to therapy, go out for coffee, go swimming, and do art classes. But now, Mum’s health has gotten worse and she is bedridden. The original hours—which were meant for her being out in the community—don't reflect the reality of her life now, but the hours haven’t been changed to meet her current situation.

The worker now comes to the house, does some cleaning, and picks up meds, which takes about 2 to 3 hours. Then she leaves, but the agency still bills for 4 hours.

In the meeting, the worker actually put words into my mum’s mouth in front of everyone by saying, “You know when you tell me to leave early.” I don’t believe that for a second. I know my mum, and she would never ask anyone to leave. What I actually think happens is the worker says, “I’ve done everything, is there anything else you’d like me to do?” and my mum, who doesn't want to be a burden, just says, “No"" giving the opportunity for the support worker to say ""okay, I'll leave then"" or something to that effect.

We asked for the hours to be redistributed—maybe 4 times a week for 3-hour shifts, or 5 times a week for 2-hour shifts. The worker flat-out said she won't do shorter shifts because it's ""not worth her while"" to drive there for less than 4 hours of pay. I am honestly shocked that the support worker cares more about her own convenience and pay than my mum getting better services through a better distribution of hours.

The care plan coordinator told us it’s ""company policy"" to charge for the full 4 hours unless changes are made 48 hours early. I get that they have to pay their staff, but the problem is this has been going on for years and not once has anyone in the company raised it as a problem.

My mum is a huge pushover. She really loves this worker, and I think the worker does care about her, but at the same time, she’s taking advantage by working less and getting paid more. It feels like the worker and the coordinator don't actually care about Mum’s money, because everyone in the company is getting paid anyway. The coordinator only started acting like they cared when my wife used the words ""financial abuse.""

It feels like the worker is taking advantage of Mum being nice, and the coordinator just doesn’t want the bother of changing anything. Having said that, I'm hoping changes will be made after the meeting.

**What should I do?**

1. Should I report the whole agency to the NDIS?
2. If I do, what happens to my mum's funding if the NDIS find out not all the hours are being worked and this has been going on for years?",5,1770873416.0,NDIS,9,0.78,False

I haven’t had that in years. I don’t have too much hope it will last but enjoying it now. Been months since I had such a long headache free run. Worth a try.

Excellent grinder but I am having trouble getting a good shot (for reference I am using a medium roast blend from Press Coffee only a few weeks off roast). Bottomless basket only fits 16g of coffee so I have been aiming at between a 25-32 second shot. When I hit that time I end up with around 40-45g of espresso out even when I am grinding fine enough to choke the grinder and stepping off a few clicks makes it run way too fast to where I end up with around 60-70g of espresso. Shots taste more on the bitter side, I’m not getting any of the chocolately of cherry notes the coffee suggests it has. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Yet, teeth lose their sparkle over time due to our habits, what we eat, and getting older. Things like coffee, tea red wine, smoking, and some foods can slowly stain tooth enamel making teeth look dull or off-color. At **Northlane Dental**, we provide top-notch teeth whitening treatments to bring back your smile's natural shine .

[Teeth whitening](https://northlanedentalpractice.co.uk/teeth-whitening/) makes your teeth lighter by getting rid of stains and discoloration.

When you come to Northlane Dental for whitening, we start by taking a close look at your mouth health. This helps our dental team figure out the best option for you and keeps your teeth and gums safe during the process.

Professional teeth whitening treatments use approved whitening agents that break down stains inside the tooth. Dental professionals oversee this process, which leads to controlled and predictable results. This cuts down the chances of uneven whitening or tooth sensitivity. Many people see clear improvements making teeth whitening a good choice before big events or just to enhance your smile.

At Northlane Dental, we put safety and comfort first. Unlike off-the-shelf kits professional whitening is custom-made for your teeth, which lowers the risk of irritation or damage to your enamel. Our team also gives you practical tips on how to keep your brighter smile. This includes good oral hygiene habits and simple lifestyle changes that help your results last longer.

Beyond looks, having whiter teeth can boost your self-esteem. When you like your smile, you tend to be more open and at ease in both your personal life and at work. A brighter smile can improve how you look overall and make you feel more confident.

If you're thinking about whitening your teeth, Northlane Dental aims to provide treatments that are effective, safe, and tailored to you. With their know-how and up-to-date methods, getting a brighter smile that makes you feel more confident is now easier than ever.

1r2kp9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthFLOrthodontist/comments/1r2kp9r/clear_aligners_vs_braces_the_complete_2024_guide/,Clear Aligners vs Braces: The Complete 2024 Guide to Choosing Your Perfect Smile Solution,"# DIY Aligners are dying. Here is the tech actually fixing teeth in 2024 (Deep Dive)

Most people think they only have two options for straightening teeth:

1.  Pay $6k+ for the ""Big Brand"" name.
2.  Gamble on sketchy mail-order kits that might ruin your bite (RIP Smile Direct Club).

I’ve been digging into the tech specs of a system called **OrthoFX®**, and honestly, the engineering blows the legacy systems out of the water.

If you are in South Florida (or anywhere looking for treatment) and care about ROI on your smile, here is the breakdown of why the hardware matters more than the hype.

***

## The Problem: ""Plastic"" isn't just plastic.

Most clear aligners use a single layer of PETG or polyurethane.

**The issue?** It's too rigid at the start (pain) and loses shape too fast (ineffective). By day 5 of a tray, it’s basically dead plastic doing nothing.

## The Solution: FXTetra™ Technology

OrthoFX uses a proprietary tri-layer material.

*   **Outer Layers:** Hard shell for durability and grip on the teeth.
*   **Inner Core:** Elastomeric layer (think highly engineered rubber).

**Why you should care:**
It acts like a memory foam mattress for your teeth. It applies constant, gentle force rather than a massive ""spike"" of pain on day one.

> **The Result: faster movement with significantly less discomfort.**

***

## The Killer Feature: ""Screw-Up Insurance""

Let’s be real. You’re going to lose a tray. Or forget to wear it for a weekend because you were out in Miami.

With traditional systems, if you fall off the wagon, your new trays won't fit. You have to go back to the doctor, get rescanned, and wait 4 weeks. It’s a nightmare.

**OrthoFX has ""Rescue Aligners.""**

These are built into the treatment plan. If you slack off, you pop in a Rescue Aligner. It’s designed to bridge the gap and get you back on track without a clinic visit.

**This is the ultimate hack for compliance.**

***

## The ""Coffee Test"" (Stain Resistance)

If you live on caffeine, standard aligners turn yellow/gross within 7 days. It looks like you have plaque all over your teeth.

 The polymer structure in this system is non-porous.
*   Drink coffee.
*   Drink wine.
*   **No yellow tint.**

***

## TL;DR - The Value Stack

If you are shopping specific practices (like **SMILE-FX** or others offering this tech), you aren't just paying for a brand name. You are paying for:

1.  **FXTetra Material:** 3 layers, less pain, constant movement.
2.  **Rescue Protocol:** Safety net if you lose trays/forget to wear them.
3.  **Aesthetics:** Invisible stays invisible (no staining).

**The Takeaway:**
Stop looking for the cheapest option. Look for the best *material science*. Your teeth are bones in your skull—don't cheap out, but don't overpay for outdated tech either.

*Disclaimer: I am not a doctor. This is a breakdown of material science and aligner specs. Always get a consultation to see if you are actually a candidate.*",1,1770872918.0,SouthFLOrthodontist,0,1.0,False

Hi! My name is Eli, and earlier today I lost my favorite hat :,( I’ve worn it pretty much every winter since middle school. It’s very important to me.

I was wearing it earlier at the Metro Market on N Oakland Ave in Shorewood. I tied it around my neck because it was getting a bit warm, so it either fell off in the store or on N Oakland Ave as I was walking out to my car :,((

I won’t be back in Wisconsin until tomorrow night, so if you happen to be in that area, please keep an eye out! I am super sad that I can’t find it.

If you happen to find my hat, please leave a comment or send me a DM. Thank you!

*OOP adds:* 

>Please please upvote this post if you see it. This hat holds a lot of sentimental value to me.

**Weird-Tell:** Did you call to see if it ended up getting turned into lost & found??

>**OOP:** I did, but they told me to call back again in the morning. I stopped at the grocery store before driving an hour and a half into Illinois and didn’t realize it was missing until I got to IL, so I wasn’t able to call until they already had closed. Thank you for the recommendation though ❤️

**OGLikeablefellow:** Did you stop for gas or anything, it seems like it might be easy to knock off getting in and out of your car. Maybe you could share where you parked too

>**OOP:** I had it for sure when I stopped for gas, but that was before I went to Metro Market. I 100% had it in Metro Market. I parked right across the street in front of Stone Creek Coffee. I’ve attached a photo for reference! I think it probably fell off while I was checking out, walking down the stairs (inside), or getting into my car. Thank you for your concern.

1r2knfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsetConqueror/comments/1r2knfv/how_to_be_the_most_charming_person_in_the_room/,# How to Be the Most Charming Person in the Room: Psychology-Backed Tricks That Actually Work,"Look, you walk into a room and some people just *have it*. They light up conversations, make everyone feel good, and somehow become the person everyone wants to talk to. Meanwhile, you're standing in the corner wondering what the hell their secret is. Here's the truth, charm isn't some magical gift you're born with. It's a skill. And yeah, I've gone down the rabbit hole on this, studied the psychology, read the books, watched the experts, and tested this stuff in real life. The good news? You can learn it. The even better news? Most people are getting it completely wrong.

# Step 1: Stop Trying So Hard (Seriously)

Here's where most people fuck up. They think being charming means being the loudest, funniest, or most interesting person in the room. Wrong. Dead wrong. Charm isn't about performing or peacocking. It's about making other people feel good when they're around you.

[The Charisma Myth](https://a.co/d/02X0ia5u) by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks this down brilliantly. She's a Stanford lecturer who's coached everyone from Fortune 500 execs to awkward engineers, and her research shows that charisma has three core elements: presence, power, and warmth. Most people obsess over power (trying to seem impressive) and forget about presence and warmth. Big mistake.

When you're actually present with someone, really listening, not thinking about what you're going to say next or checking your phone, people feel it. They feel seen. And that's addictive. Warmth means showing genuine care about what they're saying. These two things together? That's the foundation of charm.

# Step 2: Master the Art of Making People Feel Interesting

You know what charming people do? They make YOU feel like the most interesting person they've talked to all day. It's not about being interesting yourself, it's about being interested in others.

Ask questions that actually dig deeper. Not the boring ""what do you do?"" surface level crap. Try ""what are you excited about right now?"" or ""what's been taking up most of your headspace lately?"" Then, and this is crucial, actually listen to their answer. React. Ask follow ups. Show you're tracking what they're saying.

**Dale Carnegie's** [How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://a.co/d/00fqnegh) is old school but still the bible on this. Carnegie figured out decades ago that people are obsessed with themselves. Not in a bad way, just human nature. So when you show genuine interest in someone's world, their stories, their thoughts, you become magnetic to them. The book literally changed how I approach every conversation. Best people skills book ever written, hands down.

# Step 3: Use the Power of Validation (Not Flattery)

There's a difference between kissing ass and genuine validation. Flattery is empty and people smell it a mile away. Validation is noticing something real about someone and acknowledging it.

""You seem like someone who thinks deeply about things"" or ""I can tell you really care about getting this right"" hits different than ""nice shirt."" You're validating their character, their effort, their values. That stuff sticks.

Research from social psychology shows that people crave validation more than almost anything else. It's like emotional oxygen. When you give it authentically, you create an instant connection.

# Step 4: Get Comfortable with Silence and Pace

Charming people aren't afraid of pauses. They don't rush to fill every silence with nervous chatter. Silence creates tension, and tension creates interest. When you ask someone a good question, let them think. Don't jump in to save them.

Also, match their energy. If they're excited and animated, bring more energy. If they're chill and reflective, slow down. This is called mirroring, and it happens naturally when people vibe, but you can do it consciously too. Makes people feel comfortable without them even knowing why.

# Step 5: Tell Stories, Not Facts

Nobody remembers facts. They remember stories. When someone asks what you do or what you're into, don't give them a resume. Give them a moment.

Instead of ""I work in marketing,"" try ""I help small businesses figure out why nobody's buying their stuff, then fix it. Last month I worked with this coffee shop owner who was doing everything wrong and we tripled her weekend sales."" See the difference? One's boring, one paints a picture.

**The Storytelling Animal** by Jonathan Gottschall dives into why humans are wired for narrative. Our brains literally process information better in story form. When you tell mini stories in conversation, people lean in. They remember you.

# Step 6: Show Vulnerability (The Secret Weapon)

This one's counterintuitive but insanely powerful. Charming people aren't perfect, they're real. They admit when they don't know something. They share small struggles or mistakes. Not in a self deprecating way, but in an honest way.

Brené Brown's research on vulnerability shows that it actually creates connection, not weakness. When you share something real about yourself, you give others permission to do the same. That's when conversations go from surface level to actually meaningful.

Try sharing a genuine challenge you're working through or a time you messed up. Nothing heavy, just human. Watch how people's walls come down.

# Step 7: Remember Names and Details (Then Use Them)

This seems basic but barely anyone does it. When someone tells you their name, use it in conversation. ""That's interesting, Sarah"" or ""Marcus, what do you think about that?""

Also, remember small details they mention and bring them up later. ""Hey, didn't you say you were into rock climbing? I saw this crazy video..."" People are shocked when you actually remember what they told you because most people don't pay attention.

If you want to go deeper on communication skills but don't have time to work through all these books one by one, there's an app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from resources like Carnegie's work, Brené Brown's research, and tons of other psychology and social skills material. You tell it your specific goal, like ""I'm an introvert who wants to master small talk and remember conversation details better,"" and it creates a personalized learning plan with audio lessons you can listen to anywhere.

What makes it useful is the depth control. Start with a 10-minute overview, and if something clicks, switch to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples and context. Plus you can pick voices that keep you engaged, from energetic to calm depending on your mood. Makes the learning process way less of a chore and more something you actually want to do.

# Step 8: Give People an Out

Charming people don't trap you in conversations. They make it easy to leave without awkwardness. Say things like ""I don't want to monopolize your time, but it was great chatting"" or ""I should let you mingle, but let's continue this later.""

This shows respect for their time and weirdly makes people want to keep talking to you. You're not needy or clingy, you're confident and considerate.

# Step 9: Bring Positive Energy Without Being Fake

You don't have to be bouncing off the walls, but bring good vibes. Smile genuinely. Make eye contact. Don't complain or gossip. Be the person who makes the room feel lighter, not heavier.

This doesn't mean being fake positive. It means being someone who focuses on what's interesting, funny, or good rather than what sucks. People are drawn to that energy like moths to light.

# Step 10: Practice Giving, Not Taking

The most charming people are givers. They introduce people who should meet. They share resources, ideas, connections. They help without keeping score.

**Give and Take** by Adam Grant breaks down why givers often end up on top in the long run. Not the pushovers, but the strategic givers who genuinely want to help others succeed. When you approach interactions thinking ""how can I add value here?"" instead of ""what can I get?"" everything shifts.

Try making one introduction this week between two people who could benefit from knowing each other. Watch what happens.

Bottom line? Charm is about making people feel good about themselves when they're around you. It's presence, genuine interest, validation, and positive energy. Stop trying to be impressive and start being interested. That's the whole game.",1,1770872758.0,MindsetConqueror,0,1.0,False

If anyone has ideas for what to do with my empty space, lmk! 

**A few things I learned along the way:**

\- Even though most my money came from ancient fruit wine, I had way more fun diversifying my farm to include things like fruit trees, mushroom logs, and even a late game slime hutch

\- Beyond completing the CC year 1 I didn‘t put a time limit on myself for accomplishing anything so I could enjoy side quests along the way (like building my cozy coffee cabin)

\- Fish ponds are fun and pretty 

\- I‘m terrible at decorating my farmhouse (there‘s a reason the ginger island farmhouse didn‘t make the cut)

\- I completely stopped talking to / caring about the villagers after reaching max hearts. Kinda wish there was more incentive to interact with them late game. 

**Last thoughts:**

Now that I‘ve reached perfection I‘m turning ginger island into an orchard and I think I‘m going to stop my wine producing empire and explore slower and more fun methods of bringing in the money!

​Goth'roh returned to the deck of the assigned Pathfinder vessel, accompanied by Oh'rram. The crew, who had not been briefed on the purpose of their visit to the secret G.S.F. facility, froze in place. Soldiers and technicians—the entire crew, led by the ship’s commander—stared in horror at the new, massive silhouettes of the Legion's leaders. The sight of their bodies—monstrous, hybrid forms that only partially resembled Taharagch, lacking tails, weighing over three hundred kilograms, and standing over two and a half meters tall in armor—evoked an instinctive dread.

​""This hair near my snout and on my head irritates me!"" Goth'roh growled, touching the alien tissue with a rough hand.

​One of the human crew members, pale with emotion, tried to diffuse the thick atmosphere with a forced joke, though his eyes betrayed deep anxiety.

​""Want a razor, Gahara?"" he asked, forcing a smile. ""Taharagch always only had scales, so I don't know what they did to you there... and frankly, I’d rather not know. But if you want, I can teach you how to get rid of it.""

​""Get back to your duties, human, but thank you for the offer of help,"" Goth'roh cut him off, though instead of his usual contempt, his voice carried a hint of rough appreciation. ""I will check the holonet to see what this hair-cutting machine is about.""

​The human saluted hastily with visible relief that the conversation hadn't ended with a crushed ribcage, and disappeared into the technical section corridor.

​Goth'roh stood in silence for a moment, looking at his reflection in the ship’s polished bulkhead. He raised a large, five-fingered hand and clumsily touched a tuft of hair under his lower lip. Hair. The sensation was alien, soft, and completely unfitting for a warrior whose entire life had been defined by the coldness of hard scales.

​""Oh’rram,"" he barked over his shoulder to his subordinate, who was examining the new texture of his skin with similar consternation. ""Search the G.S.F. database for 'facial hair aesthetics.' If we are to lead this Legion, we cannot look like unwashed mammals.""

​The veteran only grunted in affirmation, still trying to get used to the absence of the tail that, until now, had helped him maintain balance with every step. Their new existence, full of strange needs and even stranger possibilities, was just beginning.

​Goth'roh sat in his quarters, staring at the blue glow of a hologram. Images flashed by: L’thaarr fur care tutorials, chemical depilation for medical personnel, and finally—classic metal razors used by humans.

​""Absurd,"" he muttered under his breath, but curiosity, fueled by the irritation of his itching new skin, won out. ""I’m going to the canteen shop. Perhaps that junk closet will have something useful.""

​He set off down the corridor, each step echoing through the Pathfinder. Passing the logistics section and the canteen, he again felt that old Imperial distaste for the new G.S.F. philosophy.

​According to Taharagch doctrine, the existence of shops selling civilian goods and trifles aboard a warship was a pure waste of space. Every cubic meter should be filled with ammunition, plasma cells, and gear for warriors. However, times had changed. On giant units like the Pathfinder and the ships traveling in its wake—such as the Sparta-class super-heavy battleships or their Imperial counterparts, the Avengers—the racial diversity of G.S.F. crews forced concessions. To prevent dozens of species with different psychological and physiological needs from going insane during months of transit through the void, sections useless to Goth'roh had become the norm on large ships larger than a cruiser.

​Goth'roh entered the canteen. His monstrous silhouette in the new combat shell caused the chatter to cease instantly. The warrior ignored the stares and walked directly to the counter.

​""I am looking for..."" he hesitated, trying to recall the term from the video, ""...a tool for the mechanical reduction of facial growth. A razor.""

​The human manning the canteen, who was currently sorting packets of Earth coffee, looked up and froze. Before him stood a mountain of muscle in armor, who, instead of demanding a tactical report, was asking for toiletries.

​""Aisle four, the chemistry and hygiene shelf, Gahara,"" he choked out, pointing a trembling hand toward rows of small, colorful packages. ""We have disposables, but for... you... I’d recommend the reinforced model with titanium blades. Standard ones might snap against your skin. Please be careful not to knock other goods off the shelves; your body is massive.""

​Goth'roh picked up a small, plastic device. In his massive hand, it looked like a child's toy.

​""Titanium blades,"" he repeated, analyzing the weight of the object. ""We shall see if they can handle Professor McKenzie's genetics.""

​One of the soldiers standing in line for protein bars laughed shortly, but it wasn't a malicious laugh—rather the kind of nervous bravado veterans allowed themselves. He recognized Goth'roh. Rumors of the Legion commander’s new body were spreading through the Pathfinder faster than official communiqués sent via quantum link.

​""A razor? Against your skin—even if it's now devoid of scales—you'll only waste your time, Gahara,"" the human spoke up, stepping out of line. He was a senior sergeant, his face scarred from a burn. ""For hair that tough, there is only one old-fashioned Earth way. A straight razor.""

​Goth'roh turned slowly, his powerful new body casting a long shadow over the soldier.

​""A straight razor? Explain, human.""

​The sergeant pulled a small, folding tool made of carbon steel from his uniform pocket and opened it with one fluid flick of his wrist. The blade gleamed in the sterile light of the canteen.

​""This isn't a plastic toy you buy here,"" the man began, gesturing as if shaving invisible stubble. ""The procedure is ritualistic. First, you must soften what has grown on your snout. Hot water, almost scalding, and plenty of soap to make a thick lather. You must apply it thick.""

​Goth'roh listened with a stony face, analyzing every word for biological logistics.

​""Then you take the razor,"" the sergeant continued, narrowing his eyes. ""The angle is key. Thirty degrees relative to the skin. If you hold it too flat, it won't cut anything. If you hold it too steep, you'll cut your new shell deeper than an Ullaan dagger in a dark room. You must move the blade with a steady, long stroke, with the grain—never against it at the start. Hear that sound?"" The sergeant ran his thumb across the edge of the steel, producing a distinct metallic ring. ""That is the sound of steel severing dead matter from living tissue. Afterward, you wash your face with alcohol. It stings like being hit by a small plasma pistol, but it closes the pores and disinfects.""

​Goth'roh looked at the small piece of steel in the human's hand, and then at his own massive fingers, which were only just learning the precision required for a five-fingered hand.

​""Steel and alcohol,"" Gahara muttered, a flash of understanding in his eyes. ""That sounds much more soldierly than a plastic device. Sell me this tool, human.""

​The sergeant tucked the razor back into his pocket with as much reverence as if it were the Empire's most precious relic.

​""I won't give it to you, Gahara. This is a seven-hundred-year-old keepsake from the time of my original body with nanites. It has survived more than most of the fleet ships following in this Pathfinder’s shadow,"" he said proudly, straightening up before the giant.

​Goth'roh narrowed his eyes, looking at the small human with a new kind of respect. A seven-hundred-year-old veteran who still carried an artifact from his first life.

​""However,"" the sergeant continued, pointing to Goth'roh’s belt, ""you have something on you that will handle it better than Earth steel. Your ceremonial suicide dagger. It is sharper and harder than this razor. If that tool can't handle your new beard, then I’m afraid you’ll just have to get used to the hair. There is no other way.""

​Goth'roh slowly drew the ceremonial blade. The blade, forged from rare alloys and used only for the ritual suicide of Taharagch warriors, shone with a cold, predatory glint. In his hands, it was designed to cut and pierce the toughest Taharagch scales without resistance.

​""To use the tool of ultimate honor for... hygiene,"" Gahara muttered, turning the now small-to-him dagger in his massive hands. ""Paradoxical. But logical. Since this shell is the pinnacle of bio-technology, it requires tools of the highest degree of hardness.""

​He turned without a word and headed for the canteen exit, his heavy footsteps once again setting the rhythm of the ship’s heart.

​When he entered his subordinate's quarters, he found Oh'rram, who had already managed to smash one of the mirrors and rip off a metal sink while trying to adjust the grip strength of his new hands to delicate everyday objects.

​""Oh'rram!"" Goth'roh roared, tossing a container of foam he had grabbed along the way onto the table. ""Put those plastic toys away. A sergeant from the human infantry gave me a better idea. Draw your ceremonial dagger. Today we see if McKenzie’s engineering is harder than our tradition.""

​Two massive monsters stood before the surviving fragment of the mirror. Both held weapons that until now had served only to take life, and now were to help them regain at least a semblance of their old, reptilian appearance.

​""If we cut ourselves, regeneration will close the wounds in seconds,"" Oh'rram stated, applying a thick layer of white foam to his massive new jaw. ""But if this blade blunts on these human bristles, I will personally return to the lab and crush the professor's skull.""

​Goth'roh pressed the black blade to his cheek at a thirty-degree angle, exactly as the old man had instructed. There was a dry, crunching sound of hair being severed. The dagger sliced through it like parchment, leaving the smooth skin of the new shell beneath.

​""It works,"" Goth'roh rasped with a note of relief. ""Now, focus. In about an hour, we exit the final quantum tunnel. The Legion is to see its commanders ready for battle, not two shaggy mammals.""

​On the homeworld where the First Rapid Response Legion was temporarily stationed, the presence of Gahara and Wahara caused a general stir. Soldiers—Taharagch warriors—instinctively made way for them, following them with their eyes and whispering among themselves:

​""Did you see them? Who the hell are they?""

​""That's the commander and his deputy.""

​""Are those the new shells?"" another asked in a hushed voice.

​""Yes. There are rumors about some top-secret G.S.F. project.""

​""But they're giants..."" another muttered, not hiding his amazement. ""They look almost identical. The only things that distinguish them are the military ranks engraved on their massive combat armor.""

​A soldier from the Kedui race support company, who was passing by, joined the conversation.

​""Supposedly an official order, a directive, has already been issued,"" he cut in, drawing the attention of those gathered. ""Ten thousand legionnaires are to be 'reprinted' into these new bodies.""

​The Taharagch looked at each other and then down at him, wrinkling the scales on their snouts.

​""How would you know that, short-stack?"" they growled almost simultaneously.

​The Kedui smiled enigmatically, lowering his voice to a conspiratorial whisper:

​""A friend of a friend has a friend... doesn't matter who or where. You know how it is. I can't reveal the exact source. Apparently, the new project's organic printers are already coming off the production line."" The Kedui looked up at them, stating with a hint of excitement, ""If fate allows, or if they start looking for volunteers, I’m signing up first. Finally, I'll be tall!""

​The Taharagch looked at the small warrior, and their gazes, previously full of superiority, clearly softened. One of them, a massive veteran with armor scarred by crustacean blades—souvenirs from the previous campaign—placed a heavy hand on the Kedui's shoulder.

​""I fought alongside your kin on your homeworld, defending it against the Crustaceans,"" he said in a low, rumbling voice. ""To me, brother, you are already tall.""

​The Kedui froze, surprised by this rare Taharagch display of emotional recognition. For a moment, silence fell over the camp, broken only by the hum of field generators.

​""But it's a fact,"" another Taharagch added after a moment, returning his gaze to the receding silhouettes of Goth'roh and Oh’rram. ""Those shells are impressive even to us. They look as if they were created only to crush everything that stands in their way.""

​The veteran in the scarred armor nodded, clenching his fist.

​""If ten thousand such machines strike at once, the Crustaceans will find out for the first time what it means to be the prey, not the predator.""

​Three weeks later
​An L’thaarr technician assigned to the First Rapid Response Legion stared at the rows of newly installed organic printers. The devices glowed with a blue light, their inhuman, almost sterile aesthetic contrasting with the rugged interior of the field organic printing center. The technician glanced at the digital manual, then back at the machines, shaking his head in disbelief.

​""By the Emperor..."" he muttered under his breath, sliding his fingers across the terminal. ""These machines can print a full C.B.v. 1.1 shell in less than an hour. It's pure madness.""

​Fifty latest-generation printing units had been delivered. According to the established schedule, all Taharagch from the Legion were to be reprinted in the first phase. They were chosen not only because of their strength in natural bodies, allowing them to adapt more easily, but primarily because of their mentality. For an Imperial warrior, this process was not a matter of existential choice or fear of death—it was simply another order. A command from leadership to be executed to increase effectiveness on the future battlefield.

​Only in later stages would volunteers of other races undergo the procedure, for whom abandoning a body natural to their race was a much more complicated decision.

​The L’thaarr technician took a deep breath and activated the first sequence.

​""First group, prepare for transfer to new bodies!"" he announced over the intercom, his voice echoing off the metal walls. ""Starting print!!""

​A queue of Taharagch was already standing before the entrance to the hall. They stood in silence, faces stony, ready for the euthanasia of the originals and immediate rebirth in a form that was to make them the G.S.F.'s ultimate argument in the war against the Crustaceans.

​The following weeks and months were marked by murderous training. The Legion was undergoing a transformation unlike any the G.S.F. had ever seen. Half of the infantry had already been reprinted—approximately 25,000 soldiers and warriors now possessed identical C.B.v. 1.1 shells. Hundreds of monsters of the same height, mass, and predatory features stood on the training grounds. The only things allowing them to be distinguished were the insignias on their armor, identification numbers, and names written in a harsh typeface.

​The primary goal was the merging of the psyche with the new biology. The new bodies had to become as natural to them as if they had been born in them, rather than formed in the blue slime of a printer. They had to relearn their center of gravity, precision of grip, and the immense strength that, with a careless movement, could crush standard equipment or accidentally harm some poor crew member of a transport ship.

​Goth'roh and Oh’rram did not watch this from command posts. They participated in the training like ordinary soldiers. Rank gave no privileges in the face of the new form of existence—here, everyone was a recruit in their own skin. Warriors, shoulder to shoulder with their subordinates, hauled tons of iron, ran in full gear through simulated Crustacean-occupied terrain, and practiced hand-to-hand combat that now more closely resembled a clash of titans than an infantry skirmish.

​Common sweat, adaptive pain, and hundreds of hours spent on firing ranges caused the distance between commanders and soldiers to vanish, replaced by the dark bond of beings who had together crossed the boundary of life and death... but there were also problems.

​The tradition of challenges and duels had not disappeared with the old bodies—on the contrary, the new strength only fueled it. Two Taharagch consciousnesses housed in C.B.v. 1.1 shells had clashed in a ritual challenge. Now they knelt before Goth’roh. One of them had just returned from the printer after dying in the fight, and the other was dripping with gore, missing an arm lost in the heat of the fray.

​""Have you lost your minds?!"" Goth’roh’s roar shook the walls of the quarters. ""Tradition is tradition, but not in priceless combat shells! In those old carcasses of yours, you could slaughter each other like pigs, but not in this miracle of bio-technology!""

​""Pigs, Gahara?"" the wounded warrior rasped, narrowing his eyes in pain and confusion.

​""Yes, pigs! An Earth species. Good meat, but they live in mud!"" Goth’roh barked, leaning in so close they could feel the heat of his breath. ""Now, get the hell out! Or I will kill you myself, slowly and painfully, and then I will issue the order for the final deletion of your consciousnesses from the servers! Total erasure, do you understand?! Now get out; you’ll be cleaning toilets until your next death on the front... and maybe even after it!""

​The commander turned abruptly to his adjutant, nearly smashing a terminal with a single punch.

​""From this day forward, anyone who fights a challenge in this shell dies for real! Issue my order to be read at the musters of every company and battalion in the Legion! Tradition is tradition, but for the Emperor's sake, have mercy on logistics!""

​""I won't give it to you, Gahara. This is a seven-hundred-year-old keepsake from the time of my original body with nanites. It has survived more than most of the fleet ships following in this Pathfinder’s shadow,"" he said proudly, straightening up before the giant.

​Goth'roh narrowed his eyes, looking at the small human with a new kind of respect. A seven-hundred-year-old veteran who still carried an artifact from his first life.

​""However,"" the sergeant continued, pointing to Goth'roh’s belt, ""you have something on you that will handle it better than Earth steel. Your ceremonial suicide dagger. It is sharper and harder than this razor. If that tool can't handle your new beard, then I’m afraid you’ll just have to get used to the hair. There is no other way.""

​Goth'roh slowly drew the ceremonial blade. The blade, forged from rare alloys and used only for the ritual suicide of Taharagch warriors, shone with a cold, predatory glint. In his hands, it was designed to cut and pierce the toughest Taharagch scales without resistance.

​""To use the tool of ultimate honor for... hygiene,"" Gahara muttered, turning the now small-to-him dagger in his massive hands. ""Paradoxical. But logical. Since this shell is the pinnacle of bio-technology, it requires tools of the highest degree of hardness.""

​He turned without a word and headed for the canteen exit, his heavy footsteps once again setting the rhythm of the ship’s heart.

​When he entered his subordinate's quarters, he found Oh'rram, who had already managed to smash one of the mirrors and rip off a metal sink while trying to adjust the grip strength of his new hands to delicate everyday objects.

​""Oh'rram!"" Goth'roh roared, tossing a container of foam he had grabbed along the way onto the table. ""Put those plastic toys away. A sergeant from the human infantry gave me a better idea. Draw your ceremonial dagger. Today we see if McKenzie’s engineering is harder than our tradition.""

​Two massive monsters stood before the surviving fragment of the mirror. Both held weapons that until now had served only to take life, and now were to help them regain at least a semblance of their old, reptilian appearance.

​""If we cut ourselves, regeneration will close the wounds in seconds,"" Oh'rram stated, applying a thick layer of white foam to his massive new jaw. ""But if this blade blunts on these human bristles, I will personally return to the lab and crush the professor's skull.""

​Goth'roh pressed the black blade to his cheek at a thirty-degree angle, exactly as the old man had instructed. There was a dry, crunching sound of hair being severed. The dagger sliced through it like parchment, leaving the smooth skin of the new shell beneath.

​""It works,"" Goth'roh rasped with a note of relief. ""Now, focus. In about an hour, we exit the final quantum tunnel. The Legion is to see its commanders ready for battle, not two shaggy mammals.""

​On the homeworld where the First Rapid Response Legion was temporarily stationed, the presence of Gahara and Wahara caused a general stir. Soldiers—Taharagch warriors—instinctively made way for them, following them with their eyes and whispering among themselves:

​""Did you see them? Who the hell are they?""

​""That's the commander and his deputy.""

​""Are those the new shells?"" another asked in a hushed voice.

​""Yes. There are rumors about some top-secret G.S.F. project.""

​""But they're giants..."" another muttered, not hiding his amazement. ""They look almost identical. The only things that distinguish them are the military ranks engraved on their massive combat armor.""

​A soldier from the Kedui race support company, who was passing by, joined the conversation.

​""Supposedly an official order, a directive, has already been issued,"" he cut in, drawing the attention of those gathered. ""Ten thousand legionnaires are to be 'reprinted' into these new bodies.""

​The Taharagch looked at each other and then down at him, wrinkling the scales on their snouts.

​""How would you know that, short-stack?"" they growled almost simultaneously.

​The Kedui smiled enigmatically, lowering his voice to a conspiratorial whisper:

​""A friend of a friend has a friend... doesn't matter who or where. You know how it is. I can't reveal the exact source. Apparently, the new project's organic printers are already coming off the production line."" The Kedui looked up at them, stating with a hint of excitement, ""If fate allows, or if they start looking for volunteers, I’m signing up first. Finally, I'll be tall!""

​The Taharagch looked at the small warrior, and their gazes, previously full of superiority, clearly softened. One of them, a massive veteran with armor scarred by crustacean blades—souvenirs from the previous campaign—placed a heavy hand on the Kedui's shoulder.

​""I fought alongside your kin on your homeworld, defending it against the Crustaceans,"" he said in a low, rumbling voice. ""To me, brother, you are already tall.""

​The Kedui froze, surprised by this rare Taharagch display of emotional recognition. For a moment, silence fell over the camp, broken only by the hum of field generators.

​""But it's a fact,"" another Taharagch added after a moment, returning his gaze to the receding silhouettes of Goth'roh and Oh’rram. ""Those shells are impressive even to us. They look as if they were created only to crush everything that stands in their way.""

​The veteran in the scarred armor nodded, clenching his fist.

​""If ten thousand such machines strike at once, the Crustaceans will find out for the first time what it means to be the prey, not the predator.""

​Three weeks later
​An L’thaarr technician assigned to the First Rapid Response Legion stared at the rows of newly installed organic printers. The devices glowed with a blue light, their inhuman, almost sterile aesthetic contrasting with the rugged interior of the field organic printing center. The technician glanced at the digital manual, then back at the machines, shaking his head in disbelief.

​""By the Emperor..."" he muttered under his breath, sliding his fingers across the terminal. ""These machines can print a full C.B.v. 1.1 shell in less than an hour. It's pure madness.""

​Fifty latest-generation printing units had been delivered. According to the established schedule, all Taharagch from the Legion were to be reprinted in the first phase. They were chosen not only because of their strength in natural bodies, allowing them to adapt more easily, but primarily because of their mentality. For an Imperial warrior, this process was not a matter of existential choice or fear of death—it was simply another order. A command from leadership to be executed to increase effectiveness on the future battlefield.

​Only in later stages would volunteers of other races undergo the procedure, for whom abandoning a body natural to their race was a much more complicated decision.

​The L’thaarr technician took a deep breath and activated the first sequence.

​""First group, prepare for transfer to new bodies!"" he announced over the intercom, his voice echoing off the metal walls. ""Starting print!!""

​A queue of Taharagch was already standing before the entrance to the hall. They stood in silence, faces stony, ready for the euthanasia of the originals and immediate rebirth in a form that was to make them the G.S.F.'s ultimate argument in the war against the Crustaceans.

​The following weeks and months were marked by murderous training. The Legion was undergoing a transformation unlike any the G.S.F. had ever seen. Half of the infantry had already been reprinted—approximately 25,000 soldiers and warriors now possessed identical C.B.v. 1.1 shells. Hundreds of monsters of the same height, mass, and predatory features stood on the training grounds. The only things allowing them to be distinguished were the insignias on their armor, identification numbers, and names written in a harsh typeface.

​The primary goal was the merging of the psyche with the new biology. The new bodies had to become as natural to them as if they had been born in them, rather than formed in the blue slime of a printer. They had to relearn their center of gravity, precision of grip, and the immense strength that, with a careless movement, could crush standard equipment or accidentally harm some poor crew member of a transport ship.

​Goth'roh and Oh’rram did not watch this from command posts. They participated in the training like ordinary soldiers. Rank gave no privileges in the face of the new form of existence—here, everyone was a recruit in their own skin. Warriors, shoulder to shoulder with their subordinates, hauled tons of iron, ran in full gear through simulated Crustacean-occupied terrain, and practiced hand-to-hand combat that now more closely resembled a clash of titans than an infantry skirmish.

​Common sweat, adaptive pain, and hundreds of hours spent on firing ranges caused the distance between commanders and soldiers to vanish, replaced by the dark bond of beings who had together crossed the boundary of life and death... but there were also problems.

​The tradition of challenges and duels had not disappeared with the old bodies—on the contrary, the new strength only fueled it. Two Taharagch consciousnesses housed in C.B.v. 1.1 shells had clashed in a ritual challenge. Now they knelt before Goth’roh. One of them had just returned from the printer after dying in the fight, and the other was dripping with gore, missing an arm lost in the heat of the fray.

​""Have you lost your minds?!"" Goth’roh’s roar shook the walls of the quarters. ""Tradition is tradition, but not in priceless combat shells! In those old carcasses of yours, you could slaughter each other like pigs, but not in this miracle of bio-technology!""

​""Pigs, Gahara?"" the wounded warrior rasped, narrowing his eyes in pain and confusion.

​""Yes, pigs! An Earth species. Good meat, but they live in mud!"" Goth’roh barked, leaning in so close they could feel the heat of his breath. ""Now, get the hell out! Or I will kill you myself, slowly and painfully, and then I will issue the order for the final deletion of your consciousnesses from the servers! Total erasure, do you understand?! Now get out; you’ll be cleaning toilets until your next death on the front... and maybe even after it!""

​The commander turned abruptly to his adjutant, nearly smashing a terminal with a single punch.

​""From this day forward, anyone who fights a challenge in this shell dies for real! Issue my order to be read at the musters of every company and battalion in the Legion! Tradition is tradition, but for the Emperor's sake, have mercy on logistics!""

A guy with a scruffy beard and a canvas tote was doing the same rounds. Same question at every table. We never actually spoke. At one stand he picked up a jar of buckwheat honey. I pointed at it and gave a small thumbs down. He looked at my empty basket and shrugged. We split up. He bought the buckwheat. I walked away with nothing but tomatoes.

Ten minutes later I was in line for sourdough when someone tapped my shoulder. It was him. He held out a jar of wildflower honey. The exact one. Before I could say anything, he dropped it into my basket, lifted out my tomato like it was a trade, and walked off. I stood there pointing after him. He never turned around.

My brother came back from the coffee truck and found me staring at the jar.

The pie tasted like my grandma’s kitchen. Still, I keep replaying that moment. I posted on the market’s Instagram. I checked tagged photos for a week. Nothing. Part of me wants to find him, hand him cash, say thank you properly. I changed my mind about chasing too hard because I could feel myself turning it into a task, something to complete.

I found my father dead in his apartment almost 2 weeks back. The reason for my post is to see if people have any constructive feedback?!

  
Back story of my father's relationship with Diabetes...

  
My father was a workaholic and also didnt sleep enough throughout life. He had hypertension, high blood pressure from high stress jobs/ambitions on top of raising 3 kids, and overworking in general...but then also got diabetes late in life. Upon diagnosis, Doctor said he had 7-8 yrs to live. Shortly after that my father retired early, in order to slow down, change his lifestyle and prolong his life expectancy. 

All in all he lived about 15-16 yrs since that moment, which was attributable to his switch from not overworking. He also traveled for long bouts and lived the opposite of his other periods of his life, ti slow things down, do photography, ect.He cleaned up his diet somewhat but then got into intermittent fasting about 10 years ago give or take. Being type 1 I knew it was super risky, but my father was too stubborn for his own good. As much as he loved me and maybe knew better at times... he was a doctor and always looked at me like his son, instead of considering healthy habits that I've built up and would seldomly bring up... like tracking calories, taking supplements like apple cider vinegar, glutamine, creatine, magnesium ect or higher fibre diets for digestion, detoxifying ect.

  
Yes he lost some weight early on, but would plateau, leading to him losing fair bit of muscle alongside the fat. He would yo yo a bit because of his inconsistent calorie intact and in fact I believe he didnt get enough calories usually, nor enough consistent nutrients. He also drank coffee like crazy and wasnt one for electrolytes or supplements.

When I found my father he was on the ground of his bedroom, with his eyes rolled in the back of his head. I didnt know if he was thrown into a seizure, coma from hypoglycemia... or even had a heart attack from complications of hypoglycemia or those less common things that can also happen from lower levels. The names escape me but I was researching them a bit. His bathroom toilet had remnants of vomit all over the bowl, and his clothes were scattered on the floor and by his bed. My father was pretty OCD with cleanliness and not having things lying around as I found him. I sense he was over heating maybe, super disoriented, not thinking well. My father was truly a genius in many realms of life but it was very unsettling to find such an odd scene. 

  
Because I feel he was always running the risk of low levels all the time... I feel this episode was at such a level that he couldnt even comprehend how bad it was until it was too late.

  
I knew I had the probability of finding him this way abd sadly that was exactly what happened. 

  
Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated. 

  
Ps-Im not wanting to hear a lot if gruesome recollections of other people's experiences... even though the title may come across as if I am... considering the trauma I am working through im just trying to bring to light some sense of what really happened to my father... I feel bad to unload all this graphic stuff, but some proper feedback will help me get some closure on this.



THANK YOU THANK THANK YOU for your patience and kindness to help me with this. 



Xoxo

1r2kgb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1r2kgb1/tired_of_constantly_moving/,Tired of constantly moving.,"So il be blunt, my living situation is bad, ive been trapped in the shelter system (non consecutively) for 6yrs come this April, the problem i keep running into that leads to me having to move so often is the shelters dont give us long enough and arent willing to give those of us actually trying, an extension, to be able to find work, build savings, build first and last then get out. But in the last 6yrs alone, ive lived in 9 diffrent cities/townships, from as big as 3 million people all the way down to as small as less than 3,000 people. 

I grew up in the cities, never really liked it, the convinces are nice and all, but id rather have peace and quiet, know my neighbors and be surrounded by nature not concrete, glass and brick. So when i moved to a big city for 4 months, i hated every second of it, then immediately after that, i moved to a small town and managed to stay for almost 3yrs. 

I really wanted to make that town my permanent home, i actually loved living there, if i wanted to wander the streets at 3am alone, i could and the only thing i had to worry about was bears and cyotes. Even though everyone knew i was technically homeless ornon the brink of becoming homeless again, everyone (outside the shelter) made me feel welcome, looked past my living situation and saw me for me, it was genuinely impossible for me to even just go grab a coffee on the way to work without stopping to chat with someone. 

Now? Im back in the city living with my parents, and i still dont like it, strangers dont greet eachother when passing by, ive got no clue who the neighbors are despite actively trying to get to know them, when i go to get a coffee, im just another cog in the wheel and i get ignored. Its always busy and overwhelming, its loud, its polluted theres too much concrete, the drivers absolutely suck, and traffic is apparently worse than L.A but not quite as bad as NYC. 

Why was i forced to leave? I literally dont know, and neither does my primary worker, i was living in a shelter, working, was 1 week away, 1 paycheck from having first and last months rent so i could move out into my own place, then they booted me out with nowhere to go during not just a snow storm, but during extreme cold. Did i mention this is the 2nd time that particular shelter kicked me out immediately after finding stable full time employment? 

Like, why? Because of that i didnt really have a choice, had to quit my job and just, leave or freeze to death, Words can't describe how resentful and angry i am at the management of that shelter. But either way, it is what it is and i cant change it now, but literally all i need, a place to stay closer to that town so i can either try to get my old job back, or find a new one, and move back to that town.

 I cant keep doing this move every 4 months bs, and i cant keep living in this depressing ass city, its impossible to improve my situation if i cant stay in one place long enough to actually get stuff done. It feels like the shelter system is designed to trap you in it, bouncing from place to place constantly, never able to stay long enough to make a dent in living situations, thats not the way it should be. 

It fucking sucks, but mark my words, i will return to town and i will make it my permanent home, even if i have to sleep in a tent all summer, shower and do laundry at friends places. I just cant do it living down here, its too much, and a lound group of people have made it clear people like me arent welcome in ""their"" city, just because they see the way i dress, hear the way i talk and make assumptions.

**Setting:** A brightly lit, chic studio in Mumbai. The year is 2026. **Sidharth Malhotra** is looking sharp in a denim shirt, sitting across from his long-time friend and *Hasee Toh Phasee* co-star, **Parineeti Chopra**, who is guest-hosting the segment.

**EXT. STUDIO - DAY**

The ""ON AIR"" sign glows red. The camera pans from a poster of Sidharth’s new film to Parineeti, who is grinning widely. Sidharth looks relaxed, leaning back with a coffee mug.

**PARINEETI** (To camera) So, guys, today we have a very special guest. Isse aapne bohot roles mein dekha hai—soldier, spy, lover boy—par aaj, mere sawalon se bachne ke liye koi script nahi hai iske paas. Welcome, Sid!

**SIDHARTH** (Laughing) Thanks, Pari. Honestly, jab mujhe pata chala ki tum interview le rahi ho, I was 50% excited and 50% scared. Mujhe pata hai tumhare dimaag mein kya khuraafat chalti hai.

**PARINEETI** (Winking at the camera crew) Arre, trust me na! Hum toh purane dost hain. *Hasee Toh Phasee* se leke ab tak, nothing has changed.

They chat for a few minutes about the film. Sidharth is in his element, talking about the ""hard work"" and ""vision."" Parineeti keeps nodding, but her expression slowly starts to shift into something more serious, even slightly strained.

**PARINEETI:** (Smiling, but her eyes are sharp) Waise Sid, we’ve done two films together. Sabko lagta hai it’s all fun and games. But you know, sometimes words stay with you longer than movies do.

**SIDHARTH:** Deep, Pari. Very deep. Kya hua? Are you still mad I stole your protein bars on the *Jabariya Jodi* set?

**PARINEETI:** (She doesn't laugh. Her tone shifts to something raw.) Nahi. I was thinking about the *Ek Villain* promotions. Remember that interview? You joked about taking 'weight gain lessons' from me because you needed to bulk up... I was fighting depression and struggling so much back then, Sid. Everyone knew it. I thought my friend would have my back, not use my struggle as a punchline.

**SIDHARTH:** (The act shatters instantly. He looks at the camera, then back at her, eyes wide with 'innocent' panic.) Pari... that was a decade ago. I was just being stupid. I didn't mean it like that.

**PARINEETI:** (Her voice cracks. She looks at her cue cards, her hand visibly trembling.) I know. But you never said it to me. (She clears her throat, trying to stay professional) Anyway, next question... Fans want to know if—

She stops. Her eyes swim. She takes a shaky breath, pressing her lips together to stop the quiver.

**SIDHARTH** (Eyes widening, completely panicked) Hey... hey, Pari? Are you serious? Mike check? Guys, cut the cameras?

The crew stays silent, but the ""Live"" light stays on.

**SIDHARTH:** (Leaning in, his voice dropping to a frantic, breathy *sotto voce*. He’s whispering so the mics don't catch it, but his eyes are darting toward the crew.) Pari... listen. Yeh kya kar rahi hai? Not here, yaar. I know I messed up back then—I was an idiot, I was immature—but why bring this up *now*? (A beat of silence as he sees her shoulders shake) Pari, look at me. I’ve felt like a loser about that comment for years, trust me. Remember that party? I didn't even think twice before helping you with that wardrobe thing... I thought you knew that was my way of saying sorry. Please, don't do this live...

**PARINEETI:** (Cutting him off, voice thick) Protecting my clothes isn't the same as protecting my dignity, Sid. (Whispering) I can’t do this... Give me a minute.

She turns away, burying her face in her hands. Her shoulders heave in silent, rhythmic sobs.

**SIDHARTH:** (Pale-faced. He gestures wildly to the crew.) Guys... cut the cams. Cut them! Band karo yaar, she’s actually upset! Is this still live?!

The crew doesn't move. The ""LIVE"" light stays red. One camera zooms in on Sidharth’s horrified face as he realizes his ""Clean Guy"" image is evaporating in 4K.

My girlfriend and I take turns planning the day and surprising each other with activities, and it’s my year to lead. We just moved to the neighborhood, but we know it pretty well, but this is our first Valentine’s actually living here.  
  
I am planning on spending the day exploring and taking rest in between back at our apt and I already have reservations for dinner. Looking for other activities to fill the day until dinner, only found a few activities/treats (found the treats/sweets from another reddit post):

Treats:  
\- Buttermilk Bakeshop - Valentine specific bakery sweets  
\- Miolin - heart‑shaped croissants  
\- Desserts Before Dinner (Windsor Terrace) - Valentine’s Linzer shortbreads  
\- Little Red Kitchen Bake Shop - special Valentine’s menu  
\- Loved Ones Coffee - drink + 5‑rose bundle  
\- Petee’s Pies – Valentine’s specials (not in Park Slope but nearby)  
\- Southside – Valentine’s special order  


Activities:  
\- Painted Pot - Valentines Date night  
\- Craftsman Ave - Create a steel rose  


Just wondering if there are other recommend activities. (Does B&N have an event? Heard about one at Brooklyn Museum?)",2,1770871988.0,parkslope,0,1.0,False
