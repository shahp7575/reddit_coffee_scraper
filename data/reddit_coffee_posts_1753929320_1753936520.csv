1mds8h3,https://www.reddit.com/r/exercisescience/comments/1mds8h3/bulking_belly/,Bulking belly?,"(29f) I started a work out routine in late May 

Before that I was a cig smoker, beer drinker, chips and pizza and burger eater. Video game player 

My lifestyle was abysmal but I never cared bc I was very skinny. I didn‚Äôt think it matter as long as I looked thin 

I originally began working out just to keep me committed and distracted while I went cold turkey from cigarettes. I didn‚Äôt have any goals of losing weight (5‚Äô4 and weigh 104lbs). In fact I expected that my biggest challenge was going to be figuring out a way to eat enough to stay committed to my new work out routine. In previous experiences I had to stop my routine due to dizziness, extreme lethargy, destroying my immune system and slowing down from getting sick every other week‚Ä¶ 

2 months later 

I stopped drinking, smoking cigs, began eating vegetables every day, prioritized sleeping, extreme lifestyle changes, etc 

NOW I GOTTA BELLY 

What the fuck? 

My face looks gaunt 

And my calves and forearms have thinned out 

But my thighs, biceps, ass and lower abdomen have exploded 

I lightly jog 2 mi 5x/week 
Lift weights, body weight, squats pushups, ab workouts, etc for 1 hour 4x/week 

But I‚Äôm so bloated now? 

I drink protein shakes, is it that? My diet has changed all that much, except that I eat a lot of vegetables everyday now (I‚Äôll down a frozen bag of broccoli nearly every night). No deserts except cream in my coffee 

I‚Äôve never had to watch my diet before? What‚Äôs going on?

The MC said we had a real treat up next, one that was in town unexpectedly, above the open-mic talent variety. Robert Hoyte. He was allowed to pass a hat and sell CDs (I bought one)

So he came out and sang ""Gasoline and Coffee"" it blew me away at the time. 

The album was ""Dumpster Diving Across America"" and he was in the process of doing exactly that. He and his cat, were driving around the country, playing small venues and open-mics, selling CDs, and subsisting at least in part, by dumpster diving. 

The lyrics are very left leaning \ green \ socialist, but I can and still do sing along with the whole album. I like his melodies and guitar playing a lot.

It is not on Spotify unfortunately, or anywhere else that I can find, I think I found a picture of the CD cover online once.

First day with it went through a bag of beans (all were fresh locally roasted) and were getting shots all over the place with no consistency. Went through Ninja and they determined it was a machine fault and they sent me a replacement. 

New machine I got dialed in after a few shots and managed to make a couple cups of great espresso. 

Later that same day I went to brew another with the same configuration and everything and the shot was awful. I went through another bag of beans trying to dial in and once again had horrible shots of espresso. 

The Luxe has the barista assist that i know you shouldn't always go off of (which i didn't with the continuous trouble shooting), but I feel like if thats a main feature of the machine and its so inconsistent then why spend the money for it.

At this point I am going to return the machine. Im not sure if its a Ninja Luxe thing or an overrall espresso thing, but I don't want to have to trouble shoot everytime I want a cup of coffee. Lol 
I get needing to dial in and thats a process, but once its dialed in id expect to still be the same day with same settings, beans ect.


With that being said does anyone have any suggestions for a beginner friendly, consistent espresso machine? Or would my experience be the standard in the world of espresso making and I should save my money and just stick to regular coffee at home? Lol",1,1753935873.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

https://youtube.com/shorts/WJhZk6XCnTA?si=IY28ZbJo29MQsutr

Total was about $25.

My strategy was
$10 for 3 lbs chicken breast (store had BOGO free deal)
And just some vegetables, just a frozen bag
Onion
Garlic
Spices
Donuts lol

To a wok add some olive oil and put in small chunks of chicken breast. Then once mostly cooked, add in a chopped onion and finely minced garlic. The video did not say much about spices. So I just ran with salt, pepper, turmeric, onion powder, garlic powder, soy sauce (light because the vegetables might have some too in the bag), and paprika. The tutorial also asked for cutting a few more vegetables, but my take is to just buy a big bag of frozen vegetables. Saves a lot of time + some give free sauce! Once the chicken is almost done, add in the vegetable bag and the sauce it came with it.  Then add some rice in your meal prep containers and add the food next to it. I also individually wrapped donuts in plastic wrap too. They were $8 at the grocery store, so I picked them up too. Beats $1.50 at 7/11 or $2 at DD. I did the donuts along side because I can make my coffee and eat in the way to work on the train. 

So for breakfast AND lunch‚Ä¶

$1 coffee (liberal estimate), all it is is oatmilk, quarter cap of vanilla extreact, spoonful of creamer and sugar, and an espresso shot made from instant espresso and a little bit of water

$20 main ingredients/6 = $3.33

$8 donuts / 12 = $0.66

So $5 a day for a meal! Woo! ",1,1753935672.0,mealprep,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve had this amazing friend for a while now. We got close fast , constant texts, little gifts, late-night calls, compliments out of nowhere. She always had my back, remembered the tiniest things I said in passing, and would hype me up like I was the most fascinating person in the universe.

And I loved it. I felt seen. I felt appreciated. But in my head, I chalked it all up to being one of those rare, warm, affectionate friendships. You know the kind where the care runs deep but it doesn‚Äôt cross that invisible line.

Well ,apparently it did cross the line. I just didn‚Äôt see it.

Last night, she confessed. Said she‚Äôs had feelings for a while. That everything she did the late-night convos, the way she lit up around me wasn‚Äôt just platonic. That she didn‚Äôt want to hold it in anymore.

And I froze. Not because I‚Äôm not flattered. Not because I‚Äôm grossed out or anything. But because I genuinely didn‚Äôt see it coming. I‚Äôve been sitting here replaying every single moment, every ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù text, every time she brought me coffee without asking, and I feel like I missed the subtext completely.

Now I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Do I feel the same way? I‚Äôm not sure. Maybe I buried that possibility so deep under the ""we‚Äôre just friends"" label that I never gave it room to grow. I care about her deeply. But I don‚Äôt want to lead her on if I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs that kind of caring. And I also don‚Äôt want to lose her. That‚Äôs the selfish part, I guess.

So yeah‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm in this strange emotional limbo and I could really use some perspective. Has anyone else been on either side of this kind of situation? How do you figure out whether your heart‚Äôs just late to the party?


TLDR: 
My close friend has been showing me a ton of love and affection for a while, but I thought it was just platonic. She recently confessed she‚Äôs had feelings for me all along, and now I‚Äôm completely thrown off. I don‚Äôt know if I feel the same way or if I‚Äôve just been oblivious.

[Part 4]","It came for me! The game came for me. I didn‚Äôt even play. I stayed away for days and successfully ignored the host‚Äôs siren call, but I was still punished. Ethan kept asking what was wrong and why I suddenly left his place. He found out I was sleeping in my car and started questioning me about it. I told him I had trouble sleeping in his house and my apartment has a pest problem. Another lie. Add it to the list. Of course, he saw right through it. He stopped me in the middle of the sidewalk, in the middle of the night, and demanded a real answer.



‚ÄúYou seriously would never believe me. It sounds insane. It IS insane!‚Äù I wrung my hands, anxiety bubbling over me like a bowling pot.



‚ÄúAaron, just spit it out. I promise, whatever it is, I‚Äôll try my best to believe you.‚Äù He spoke in earnest, a tenderness in his eyes. Ethan was always a better brother than I could hope to be. I was more of a loner than him, more selfish, more willing to bend or break rules than he was.



‚ÄúFine.‚Äù I sighed. ‚ÄúCome with me.‚Äù I led him up to my apartment. As I approached my door I could hear the muffled sounds of game show music. I waited and turned back to face Ethan. ‚ÄúDo you hear that?‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah. Did you leave your T.V. on or something?‚Äù Ethan raised an eyebrow.



‚ÄúNot at all.‚Äù I cautiously unlocked my front door and stepped inside the apartment with Ethan on my tail. The music stopped as soon as I crossed the threshold with him. There was nothing but darkness beneath the pantry door. I looked around like a dog on high alert for intruders. Every closet and door was the same. We were alone.



‚ÄúAaron, c‚Äômon. What‚Äôs this about? Just tell me.‚Äù He prodded, but then picked something up off the ground. ‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôs this?‚Äù Ethan held up a single, rectangular, card. It was sturdy like a business card and lined with gold paper. Printed on it was a single word in big, black letters: RISK.



‚ÄúWhat the fuck? No, no, no, no!‚Äù I shouted and ripped the card out of his hand.



‚ÄúWhat?! What does it mean? Where did it come from?‚Äù Ethan‚Äôs face flushed red as his demeanor became more parental.



‚ÄúOkay, listen. Sit down. I‚Äôll tell you everything.‚Äù I begged, gripping the card. I gestured toward the kitchen table, the hazel glow of the sink light being our only source of illumination in the witching hour. ‚ÄúThere is a game show in my pantry.‚Äù I muttered and waited for his response.



‚ÄúOkay, Aaron. Ha. Ha. Quick fucking with me.‚Äù He retorted sarcastically.



‚ÄúNo, seriously. Remember the candy bar and wine I told you about? It didn‚Äôt come from a friend. I won it from that sadistic game show! I should still have the bottle here.‚Äù I sped over to my trash can and fished out the half empty bottle. It was still here and the label was still legible. ‚ÄúSee? It‚Äôs real.‚Äù I handed the bottle to Ethan for him to examine.



‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt prove anything. It‚Äôs just wine.‚Äù He shrugged.



‚ÄúExcept I looked up that brand and I can‚Äôt find it anywhere. It‚Äôs like it doesn‚Äôt exist!‚Äù With each doubting statement I combated, the more desperate I became. I opened Pandora's box and I needed Ethan to believe me. I needed my brother. ‚ÄúNot only that, but haven‚Äôt you noticed that I look visibly younger or that I‚Äôm just miraculously better from being poisoned?‚Äù



‚ÄúNow that you mention it, you did bounce back pretty quickly, but you're also twenty-five so enjoy it while it lasts.‚Äù Ethan smirked, chalking it up to just youthful genes. He didn‚Äôt believe me. There was no way I could sell it to get him to buy in. It just meant that I was right back where I was before: alone.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm not‚Ä¶AH!‚Äù I winced as pain erupted in my hand. Right in front of Ethan, the flesh on my palm split open and began spilling a copious amount of blood onto the white linoleum floor. My stomach groaned furiously and I rushed to the bathroom, lunging for the open toilet bowl. I spewed out mostly bile, my dinner, and what looked like specks of blood. I wretched and clutched onto the toilet basin with my bloody hand.



‚ÄúHoly shit! Aaron! What‚Äôs happening?‚Äù Ethan rushed behind me into the bathroom, grabbing whatever medical supplies he could find in the cupboard. Once I was done puking, he turned me around, and quickly wrapped my hand in gauze. My head became weightless and my vision steadily grew hazy. That‚Äôs when the music started and shimmers of lights peaked from just around the corner. ‚ÄúWe gotta get you to the hos‚Ä¶pit‚Ä¶al. Huh? What‚Äôs that?‚Äù Ethan stopped aiding me as his attention was drawn down the hall to the pantry.



‚ÄúE-Ethan‚Ä¶Don‚Äôt!‚Äù I struggled to warn him as my world spun faster into an endless void until I was embraced by the forceful darkness of sleep.



I woke up to my T.V. playing on full volume and one of my neighbors pounding on an adjacent wall for me to turn it down. My vision was still foggy, but slowly cleared as I sluggishly stood on my feet. I clutched the sink with my good hand and pulled myself upright. I stumbled through the hallway, using the walls as supports. I managed to make my way over to the living room couch where I sat my full weight down in a painful, writhing pile. I plucked up the remote and lowered the volume to an acceptable level. The banging stopped and I set my attention to what was on the screen.



‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I croaked. It couldn‚Äôt be, but it was. Risk or Reward was on my television. The same, smiling host as the first time I visited stood at her podium. She still wore the name tag I saw her male persona wearing ‚ÄúLugh.‚Äù I said through my teeth. That‚Äôs when the camera panned over to the audience. Shapeless, flesh colored faces filled the seats. It was like someone took a blurry photo of everyone, but that was their actual faces. Except, one face stood out to me. ‚ÄúEthan!‚Äù I gasped, jumping off the couch. Panic and adrenaline surged through me like a tidal wave. Ethan sat among the other audience members smiling and cheering, but it seemed forced. I could see pain in his eyes and his cheeks looked wet. Was he crying?¬†



My mind raced faster than it had in months. Long gone were the days when my greatest worry was getting a report in on time or drawing the latest sales statistics or testing some new online algorithm for trends. Fuck all that. If I survive this‚Ä¶if WE survive this, I‚Äôm quitting. I'm done not living. I‚Äôm done not taking chances.



‚ÄúNow! Wasn‚Äôt Aaron great folks?!‚Äù The host asked and the crowd cheered. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think he should come back for double or nothing?!‚Äù Again, the crowd clapped. ‚ÄúOh, but what‚Äôs that?! It seems Ethan, Aaron‚Äôs brother, is in the studio today! Perhaps he should try his hand at the game?‚Äù The crowd gasped, ‚Äòoo‚Äôed and ah‚Äôd‚Äô. ‚ÄúWe will find out tonight on‚Ä¶RISK! OR! REWARD! And, as always, the choice is yours, Aaron!‚Äù The host looked directly at the camera, at me. Her face flickered and buzzed with the screen as she transformed into her counter persona. Both grinned at me, impossibly wide as the screen went dark. I was left in the glow of my apartment during midday with the Arizona heat, drawing out all my moisture.



‚ÄúSHIT!‚Äù I screamed and kicked my coffee table with the bottom of my foot. I ignored the pain and wracked my brain for ideas. I needed to get cleaned up first. Address my wound and then come up with a plan. I have about twelve hours before the game show comes for me again and I don‚Äôt have a choice this time. Did I ever? I can‚Äôt ignore it and I have to get Ethan out of there.



As someone suggested in the comments, I‚Äôm going to try to take a camera with me. My phone should work and assuming at least one of us makes it out, we‚Äôll hopefully have visual proof of Lugh and their sick game. Maybe I should take Gatsby with me again. He might be a good distraction. Let me know if anyone has any ideas! I‚Äôm open to suggestions! Otherwise‚Ä¶this might be my final entry. I hope it‚Äôs not.

1mdrvez,https://www.reddit.com/r/agedlikemilk/comments/1mdrvez/the_coffee_i/,The Coffee (i),"Heavy winds outside and a dark kind of whether it was when I took a mug from the office kithen and went towards the coffee machine near the window. While the machine was brewing it, I enjoyed the views with a slight hope that the coffee would be good unlike the one I'd in the morning.

I took a sip and put down the mug, honestly it was good. 

I'd called her to meet me at the cafeteria. Hands were trembling a little and then she entered through the door in her light blue outfit which had a quite beautiful Indian Design. She looked just like the dream I had last night. I'd run a lot in the dream but didn't feel tired at all.

She came and I was just wondering where should I damn look, would looking at her eyes make her feel good or make me look cheap. So I just looked at my switched off phone, subtle right?
Took another sip and yes it was good.

Heard a little sound of thunder from outside but it was just her pulling off the chair to sit. My hands were just getting calm but then she sat and looked me straight into my eyes. Honestly this is my everyday 6:00 PM story, but yet again I failed to fake the emotions on my face.

Halfway through my coffee I looked at the window, it started to rain a little. She said she wasn't avoiding and asked what's so damn wrong with me? Is it my new imaginary date?
Is it my family? Is it my career?

ah yes, just keep talking please. I don't have the courage at this point. I agree everything is wrong with my life, just keep talking. I'm listening to whatever she has to say right now but I don't understand why is everything so damn slow in the background?

Not to exaggerate this shit but yes it was the situation when I took the second last sip of my coffee.

At this point there are only two things I love, it's the coffee that wakes me up and it's her who unintentionally reminds me to live.

Then, with the most stammered pitch, i said ""let's cut off please""

The Silence after that..

It broke me off but i tried to keep it cool by getting up from the chair and leaving while taking the last sip. The worst coffee i ever tasted to be honest.

After putting the mug back at the kitchen window I took my bottle and started to run my way through the door, by walking ofcourse. Didn't even look back at her while I was ""walking"" my way back.

The first thing I did was to hide my eyes from seniors who were walking towards the cafeteria, I said I'll be back in 10mins. Straight up after that I went to the washroom and started writing some sort of bullshit, in a hope that I could forget the other bullshit in my mind.

She started to call me, I tried to avoid it so much.
Yeah actually, I ignored one call. Damnnnnn
So what if I was trying to call back before she called for the second time and I picked up.

We met downstairs and I forgot my umbrella, but she had one.
She kept asking me the reasons for cut off and everything going on in my mind. 

She said 
""Tell me whatever you're thinking, think of it like this is the last time we're going to talk like this"".

I had so many things to say at that point, but all I could manage to say was ""I love you, said this since this is the last time we're talking"".

There was an awkward silence, but somehow I felt lighter.",0,1753935156.0,agedlikemilk,1,0.25,False

1. Small silicon ice cube tray for use in your hotel/airbnb. We like having cocktails or iced coffees, and had such a hard time finding any bags of ice. Every place we stayed had a mini fridge with a freezer, so it would have been so helpful to freeze our own ice cubes. And let me tell you... warm gin is... not great. A silicone mold would have been small and easy to pack too.
2. For people like me that must sleep with a fan (for the white noise)... Bring a USB\*\* portable fan. I thought I had planned well by buying a portable travel fan, though it had the standard US electrical plug. I brought an adapter, but I guess I didn't realize that you cant go from 115 v to 220v. So I plugged it in and it immediately burned out the motor. If only I had gotten one of those USB fans instead... USB plugs were everywhere in Iceland. Some of our lodging did have a desk fan which was great but others did not, which made for some difficult night sleeping (yes I'm bougie i know)",5,1753935099.0,VisitingIceland,1,0.86,False

Looking for a bit of help thinking through our family budget. We‚Äôre a family of 5 (three little ones, all under 5) living in the Chicago suburbs. I work full-time in banking and bring in about $10,240/month, and we earn $2,600/month (after the mortgage + hoa this nets us about $200) in rental income from a separate property we own. So our monthly income is around $12,840.

We recently did a full audit of our spending (3 months of statements), and here‚Äôs the current monthly breakdown:

‚∏ª

Housing (+ Net after rental offset): $2,631 (primary residence)
Debt Payments (Amex, Auto, Student Loans, other credit cards): $1,977
Utilities & Recurring Bills (T-Mobile, electric, insurance, etc): $1,188
Groceries & Household (Amazon, Costco, Target, diapers, etc): $2,450
Dining & Takeout (Uber Eats, coffee, restaurants): $1,575 (wife order‚Äôs groceries through uber eats sometimes)
Transportation (gas, tolls, Metra): $405
Miscellaneous (Target runs, kids‚Äô stuff, gifts, health costs): $810
Recreation & Lifestyle: $487

‚∏ª

Total Spending: $11,523
Surplus: ~$1,300/month

We‚Äôve already cut out Klarna/BNPL stuff, and cash withdrawals have stopped. Uber Eats is a bit high but with three kids under 5, some nights we‚Äôre just in survival mode. Groceries are wild, even at Aldi. Our biggest fixed expenses are the house ($2,600) and my car loan ($750)

We‚Äôre not drowning‚Äîbut it feels like we should have more leftover given the income. I‚Äôm looking to optimize this without making life miserable for our family.

Would love advice on:

- Where to trim without totally overhauling the lifestyle
- Whether to take our $25k in debt via 401k and pay off credit cards 

Thanks in advance!

1mdruhq,https://i.redd.it/00osksx4x4gf1.jpeg,It's A Mirra(cle),"Heyo Rotation Coffee people‚ÄîWill of Mirra here. I've never posted to Reddit before, and had to make an account to post this, but Jay Tee has encouraged me to put up a quick post to introduce y'all both to Mirra, and to the coffees I've roasted for the latest Rotation installment, so here's me giving this a red hot go.

So, I'm Will Warren, Mirra's founder, greenbuyer, roaster, labeler, bag-filler, boxer, shipper, and emailer; that is to say, it's pretty much just me here. I live and operate Mirra in Kingston, New York, which is in the mid-Hudson Valley. Although I'm originally from Baltimore City, I wound up here because Kingston is only a short drive from Bard College, which I will be graduating from with degrees in philosophy and literature later this year.

In 2021, I spent a year or so working as a barista at several well-regarded roasteries in Europe, and during this period had easy access to April, Coffee Collective, and Tim Wendelboe, among others; this Nordic approach to sourcing and roasting became what I had developed a taste for personally, and upon returning to the States in 2022, and finding that no one was intentionally and directly roasting in the Nordic style, I reckoned that there was definite need and space for a roastery that embodies Nordic style coffee in the American specialty scene. So, in December of 2022, I founded Mirra to that end.

For me, doing things Nordic is all about purity; both in sourcing and roasting my goal is always the same: to taste the coffee, and nothing but the coffee. This purity in the final cup is realized first through a minimal touch‚Äînot in terms of difficulty or involvement, but in terms of artificial/augmented intervention‚Äîtaken with relation to how a coffee is processed. In order for a lot to make it onto the Mirra menu, it must meet an incredibly high bar of clarity, wherein the only flavors we perceive in the cup are those inherent to the coffee itself‚Äîderived from its varietal(s) and terroir‚Äîrather than the product of the processing that the coffee has undergone. This means that I very strongly lean towards traditionally processed coffees, and towards washed coffees (though not exclusively), all with very short fermentation times. The incomparable purity of flavor that more traditional, minimally involved processing methods yield is why you'll never find any experimental, extended fermentation, yeast inoculated, carbonic maceration, co-fermented offerings on the menu, and why I mostly avoid anaerobic lots as well.

As for how I believe to best respect and represent the care and intention that the producers I work with apply to cultivate the level of beautiful, sweet, complex, immensely clean coffees that we source, once they hit the roaster, is to continue to prioritize purity of flavor in the roasting. Once again, the minimalism of the Nordic approach to roasting‚Äîmost basically to roast just to complete flavor development, without underdeveloping and without even slightly overdeveloping‚Äîis best suited to make what's most beautiful in a given lot of coffee shine its brightest. If I've sourced a coffee well, you'll taste none of the processing, and if I've roasted it well, you'll taste none of the roasting‚Äîjust the coffee's truest self in the final cup.

Now, on to some notes on the coffees y'all will be receiving courtesy of Rotation. I've been searching for a long while for an outstanding Colombian field blend, without much luck, until I stumbled on a lot from Henry Burbano; I think (Colombian) field blends are too often written off by us specialty snobs because, granted, they do tend to be pretty boring (but isn't most specialty coffee boring after all?). HOWEVER there are definitely exceptions to be found, if you look long enough, and this is definitely one of them. It's as fruity, delicate, bright, and nuanced as any pink bourbon you'd hope to find, and definitely a special lot. Speaking of: Selmira Ruiz' lovely pink bourbon from her farm, La Palma. I had to snag this one, because it was just one of the most memorable and unique PB lots I'd had within recent memory; it displays a much more nuanced, mellow citrus quality than most PBs, and instead offers much more dominant florality than is typical, which just serves to remind us that pink bourbon is an Ethiopian landrace varietal after all.

Continuing on to the Costa Ricans. So, I've made it a bit of a point this year to try to seek out some of the best coffee to be had from Costa Rica‚Äîconvinced initially that the terroir, being practically the selfsame as that of Panama, had just as much potential for quality and complexity‚Äîand it seems my conviction paid off, as all three Costa lots that I've dropped (so far) are true stunners, and all from Gonzalo Hernandez of Coffea Diversa. Gonzalo's geisha, for instance, is without a doubt better than many geishas I've samples this year from some of Panama's most lauded producers. Costa Rica seems, for one reason or other, to have been neglected by the majority of hyper-specialty roasters, but having tasted the quality that is possible there, it will definitely remain a focus of mine going forward, and I can't wait to further expand and refine the Mirra offerings from there as my network of connections to producers there grows and solidifies in the coming seasons.

Next up: Tagel Alemayehu's washed Ethiopian. If you've been paying any attention to what other US roasters are doing, you, like me, will probably have seen this coffee practically everywhere. It's for good reason though, as this hits all the spots for what I'd want in an excellent washed Ethiopian, without being boring and too typical, like most washed Ethiopian lots I come across. Because of how difficult I've found it, though, to find interesting, nuanced Ethiopian lots, this will likely be the only Ethiopian release this season. Anyway, it's got lots of juicy peach and dark, bright huckleberry, as well as a bouquet of mellow florals‚ÄîI get chrysanthemum.

Finally, and perhaps the lot I'm most excited about at the moment if I was pressed to chose: Yenitzin's washed SL28 from Finca Feryen, Panama. This is just such an unusual and outstanding coffee, I feel lucky for sure to have found it. In addition to making a point of sourcing stunning lots from Costa Rica, I've also had a goal of bringing in some excellent non-geisha lots from Panama, which has proven difficult, this season at least (stay tuned for the next season). This SL28, however, is definitely one of the top three SL28 lots I think I've ever had, those other two being Kenyan. You definitely get a hint of super quality Panamanian terroir, if you know what you're tasting for, but I'd say it takes a back seat to the immediate flavor of the¬† varietal in this one, which brings those classic dark berry, floral, and bright citric notes that you find in the best Kenyan coffees.

I almost forgot to mention, I also sent out some Brazilian arara from Alcides Torezan; this coffee is my current white coffee offering, meaning I sourced and roasted it with its pairability with milk specifically in mind. It's just a clean, sweet, mellow and¬† easy-drinking Brazilian with a bit more development on it for body and flavor stability (when faced with milk)‚Äîin essence, my normie/gateway coffee.

So that's me, Will, and Mirra in (not so) brief. If you made it this far, I hope you were sipping on something beautiful as you read.

Thank you, Jay Tee, for making room for Mirra on your platform, and thank you Rotation subs for your continued interest, engagement, and support‚Äîit's awesome to pop up on Reddit for the first time (I swear) and find a community like this.

1mdrud6,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1mdrud6/warm_welcome/,Warm Welcome,"The rain came sideways in Harrow Ridge, a town that always looked like it was stuck in a thunderstorm. Cole had just moved in a week ago‚Äîtraded the endless noise of Memphis for something quieter, cheaper, a little forgotten. His new apartment was nothing special: peeling wallpaper, flickering bathroom light, and a water heater that screamed like a wounded animal. But it was his.

On a Thursday night, bored and restless, he walked into The Dusty Nail, the only bar open past 9 p.m. in town. It smelled like old wood, spilled beer, and desperation. The regulars barely glanced up.

That‚Äôs when Cole met him.

‚ÄúNew face,‚Äù the man said, sitting beside him without asking. He was in his late 20s, unshaven but handsome in a scrappy kind of way. Faded black hoodie. Hands calloused like he worked with them, but something about his voice was smooth, practiced.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Cole said. ‚ÄúJust moved in. Cole.‚Äù

‚ÄúName‚Äôs Mason. Lemme guess‚Äîbored outta your mind already?‚Äù

Cole laughed. They talked for hours. Mason had that kind of charisma that made you feel like you‚Äôd known him forever. Told Cole all about the weird town lore, the so-called ‚ÄúHarrow Ridge Hauntings,‚Äù the old burned-down hospital on the edge of town, the disappearances no one ever really talked about.

At closing time, Mason clapped Cole on the back. ‚ÄúYou wanna hang out more, we can crash at my place. Got some old horror flicks, some whiskey, and a couch that, I promise, is only slightly possessed.‚Äù

Cole, buzzed and curious, agreed.

Mason‚Äôs apartment was on the third floor of a run-down complex a few blocks over. Sparse furniture. Posters of classic slasher movies on the walls. There was something cozy about it. They stayed up watching The Thing, trading stories. Mason never broke eye contact during the bloody scenes.

Cole fell asleep on the couch sometime around 3 a.m., Mason still nursing a drink.

‚∏ª

The next morning, the world felt‚Ä¶ off.

Cole‚Äôs head throbbed. The apartment was silent except for the low hum of the TV.

‚ÄúMason?‚Äù he called out.

No answer.

He sat up. The whiskey bottle was still on the coffee table, mostly full. No signs of anyone having been there recently. The front door was unlocked.

The TV was playing a local news segment. Cole rubbed his eyes‚Äîand froze.

The screen showed a grainy photo of a man‚Äîmessy hair, stubble, cold eyes.

‚Äù‚Äîbelieved to be responsible for at least eight disappearances across several counties. Authorities are asking anyone who may have come into contact with the man, identified as Mason Ward, to call immediately‚Äî‚Äù

Cole‚Äôs heart nearly stopped.

It was him.

Same voice. Same face. Same hoodie.

The segment showed security cam footage‚ÄîMason dragging a large black duffel bag into the woods. Another clip of him waving to a cashier with a dead stare. Then another victim‚Äôs photo. Then another.

Cole stood slowly. The apartment felt smaller. He turned off the TV.

That‚Äôs when he noticed something in the corner of the room: an old Polaroid pinned to the wall. It hadn‚Äôt been there last night.

It was a photo of Cole.

Sleeping on the couch.

Sharpie scribbled beneath it:
‚Äú#9?‚Äù

He left that apartment without looking back.

Mason was never found. But Cole never sleeps with the TV on anymore.

Because sometimes, during late-night replays of unsolved mystery segments‚Ä¶

1mdrttm,https://www.reddit.com/r/atrioc/comments/1mdrttm/do_you_all_understand_atrioc_or_are_we_all/,"Do you all understand Atrioc, or are we all listening to him confused AF?","I feel like I'm constantly confused about the things said in clips and on the pod - even when I have had my morning coffee. Here are a few examples - feel free to skip to the end:



Couple of episodes ago, the lemo-gang was talking about the AI acqui-hires, alluding to how the company was gutted and its equity was rug-pulled, when the license and leadership were bought up by Google. But, wait, wouldn't the license payment go directly into the company's cash holdings, which 1:1 translate to equity for the workers? Why are we saying that the workers who chose equity package got rug-pulled? Well, after a lot of googling I realise that investors are given preferential shares, and while the IPO would convert those to regular shares, revenue gains pre-IPO bypass regular shares until some revenue targets are hit by the preferential shares.



All the talks about Lina Khan is even more confusing - Atrioc often brings up Lina's favorite example of patent abuse, modifying the cap on inhalers. The idea is that when a patent on inhaling liquid expires, the company tweaks something superficial about either the formula, or even the inhaler itself, and extends the patent, since now they have a new invention. But, wait, doesn't that mean other companies can make generics of the old inhaler models? You do need to file separate ANDAs for very similar products, such as a pill vs a powder form of the same drug, but if I get my ANDA approved for a powder, you can't just release a pill and make my FDA LoA invalid, right? And it wouldn't even be a good stalling method, because companies file ANDAs decades before the patent expires, they just don't add a Paragraph IV until they feel like they can win in court. I start asking on subs and reading opinions by lawyers and realise the real issue is marketing, not IP - the company switches its marketing machine to advertise the ""new"" drug, and even though technically you can purchase the same thing as a generic for 0.02 of the price if you don't mind the old inhaler cap, the less savvy buyers and even docs can continue to be fooled for a while longer.

  
""Private Equity"" is also quite confusing. A lot of the times when Atrioc brings up private equity, he basically describes, without naming, the concept of PE investors' break-up strategy. PE investor does a leveraged buy-out of a company, then sells it in pieces and destroys it, or so the description goes. But, like, how? If a company has assets that are worth more than the company itself, that means the accountants are stupid. If banks loan a company money to be leveraged-bought-out by Mr Steal-Your-Job, that means the banks are stupid AF. And aren't big chunks of most private companies' values tied in intangibles, like brand recognition, know-how, etc - things you cannot sell in parts, because nobody will buy brand IP of a gutted carcas? Where do you even get a private company with a low P/E nowadays? Again, hours of reading later, I realize this is more of an 80s strat, when there were genuine pre-IPO companies in mature sectors, that had low P/E and low brand value, because they were manufacturing businesses, most of the value of which was in machines, the building, etc., and even then it was basically just accelerating the inevitable move to China.

1mdrsx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCareerAdvice/comments/1mdrsx2/advice_for_someone_trying_to_pivot_into_cyber_the/,Advice for someone trying to pivot into cyber the right way,"Hey all,
Like a vast majority of folks on this subreddit, I‚Äôm working on breaking into the cybersecurity/IT field and wanted to share a bit about where I‚Äôm at and get some honest advice on how to get started.
First off, I want to say I know the market is absolutely TERRIBLE right now, and that there‚Äôs a flood of so many people looking for ‚Äúentry-level‚Äù cybersecurity/IT work. I know that‚Äôs tricky. I know it‚Äôs rare. I know ‚Äúentry-level‚Äù isn‚Äôt really much of a thing in cyber, although I‚Äôve seen folks on here and elsewhere pull it off - getting into cyber without a typical IT path, so I know it's possible even if it's not easy.


So, a little about me:
I‚Äôm 23, and I‚Äôve bounced around various computer science topics in college. I started out as a CS major, got good at C++, learned data structures & algorithms, and when I decided I wanted to specialize a bit more into cyber I swapped over to Computer Information Systems. Problem was, I really didn‚Äôt enjoy the business classes in that major. Then, my school started offering an online Bachelor‚Äôs in Cybersecurity - ‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù I thought, ‚ÄúJust what I need!‚Äù.


The problem with that was, I didn‚Äôt read the fine print - while it was eligible for financial aid, it was only eligible for the Pell grant and not the state university grant that was paying the majority of my tuition. I thought, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay, I can take out loans, cyber is a high paying field and I should be able to pay them off quickly.‚Äù


Then my girlfriend of nearly 3 years broke up with me just before we were supposed to move back in together, just as my lease was ending. I had no choice but to move across the country and back in with my mom. That drained pretty much all of my finances, and I can‚Äôt stay with my mom for too long, so now I have to work full-time to get back on my feet and move out ASAP. That forced my hand, and I had to withdraw my enrollment from that BS in Cybersecurity. I can‚Äôt work full-time, maintain that education, and take on loans all at the same time. For clarity - I‚Äôm currently interviewing for some jobs in the hospitality industry as that‚Äôs where I have the most experience right now.
All things considered, withdrawing from that program might have been a good thing honestly. I‚Äôve heard Cybersecurity degrees tend to be a bit of a waste of time. With the state of the market right now, and the rise of AI, I felt a lot less confident about taking on those loans since maybe by the end of the 2 years getting that degree, the cybersecurity landscape could look COMPLETELY different from what I was taught. The cybersecurity folks I‚Äôve spoken with about this decision have generally agreed that I made a wise choice not continuing my education right now and taking on that debt.


So, I‚Äôm trying to pave my own way. I‚Äôm currently studying for my CCNA through Jeremy‚Äôs IT Lab, and it‚Äôs going really well so far. After I finish that, I plan on getting my CompTIA Sec+ or CySA+. 
Before this, I was president of my university‚Äôs Cybersecurity Club and captained our Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) team for 3 consecutive years, which gave me a ton of hands-on experience dealing with real-time blue team challenges under pressure. I also competed in the National Cyber League, finishing in the top few percent, and I‚Äôve got about 6 months IT support experience in a small-business office setting plus leadership on a niche but popular indie game project I helped build for years.
Since moving back in with my mom, I‚Äôve been diving into local meetups and building relationships with cybersecurity professionals face-to-face, following up and trying to be a consistent presence in that community. I also applied to be on the Ops team for my CCDC region to get more real-world experience setting up network infrastructure and running the competition. I‚Äôve been setting up coffee chats with current/former SOC analysts and other cybersecurity professionals, and working on home lab projects like building tools to triage logs and enrich threat intel.


My goal is to break into cybersecurity in a way that lets me grow toward SOC and incident response eventually, but I‚Äôm open to any entry-level roles that will get my foot in the door. Helpdesk is on the table if it‚Äôs the best way forward, but it‚Äôs not ideal.
So, I‚Äôd love some real talk on:


- Are there specific entry-level titles I should focus on that are actually good springboards into SOC or other cybersecurity work? Anything I can do with my CCNA? Like I said, I‚Äôd like to avoid helpdesk if possible.


- For someone not thrilled about helpdesk but open to it, what are green flags for helpdesk roles that can lead into security?


- How do hiring managers really view things like CCDC/NCL and home lab projects - resume fluff, or real differentiators?


- What kinds of home lab or personal projects have actually impressed interviewers or recruiters you‚Äôve dealt with?


- What‚Äôs something you‚Äôve seen actually help people stand out when everyone has the same certs and projects?


- How did you get your first break, and what do you wish you‚Äôd done differently?


- When networking with professionals, what‚Äôs the best way to avoid coming off as a ‚Äújob beggar‚Äù while still making real connections?


- What‚Äôs something people early in their career tend to overlook that becomes important later?


- What do you think are the biggest mistakes aspiring cybersecurity pros make early on?


- What‚Äôs something you would want to see from someone applying to your team, even if they didn‚Äôt have direct SOC experience?


I‚Äôm open to any feedback or personal experiences. Really just trying to figure out the smartest way to launch my career.

One user message at 2 AM changed everything. Here's how I went from near-failure to $12K MRR in 90 days.

# The 2:47 AM Breakdown

Staring at my hosting dashboard, ready to delete everything. 8 months building, $127 monthly revenue, savings gone, girlfriend asking about ""real jobs.""

Then my phone buzzed:¬†*""Your tool helped me land my first SEO client. Made $2,000 this month because of you. Thank you""*

I ugly-cried at my kitchen table.

# What I Was Doing Wrong

**Reality check after 8 months:**

* Built 23 features nobody asked for
* Spent $3,200 on ads, made $89 back
* Had zero real conversations with users
* Tried ""scaling"" with 12 paying customers

**The brutal truth:**¬†I was building my ego, not solving problems.

# The 3 AM Decision That Saved Everything

Couldn't sleep after Sarah's message. Did something crazy - personally messaged all 47 users asking:¬†**""What's your biggest SEO struggle?""**

**What happened:**

* 31 people responded (67% rate!)
* 18 jumped on calls that week
* 9 had the exact same pain point I'd been ignoring

**What I thought they needed:**¬†Better keyword research  
**What they actually needed:**¬†Help explaining SEO to their clients

# The 90-Day Turnaround

**Month 1:**¬†Started listening to users ‚Üí $127 to $890 MRR  
**Month 2:**¬†Removed unused features, built what they wanted ‚Üí $890 to $3,200 MRR  
**Month 3:**¬†Created user community ‚Üí $3,200 to $12,100 MRR

# The Simple Framework That Worked

# Weekly Coffee Chats

Every Tuesday, I talk to 3 users. No agenda, just: ""How's the tool working for you?""

**Result:**¬†70% of my best features came from these conversations.

# Pain Point Tracker

Google Sheet tracking: What users complain about | How many mentioned it | Impact if solved

**Build from the top down.**

# Human-First Communication

Write like you are talking to a friend, not a corporate robot.

# For Anyone Ready to Quit

If you're reading this at 2 AM, questioning everything - I see you. I was you 3 months ago.

**What saved me:**

1. One user message changed my perspective
2. Started listening instead of building
3. Focused on solving real problems, not imaginary ones

**Your lowest moment might be one user message away from your breakthrough.**

What is your ""almost quit"" story?

1mdrokv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1mdrokv/room_for_dessert/,Room For Dessert,"The tiny brass bell tinkled a familiar greeting as Cerise entered the dining room of Hank's All-Nite Diner. 

She walked past the booths, nodding in approval at the clean tables and fully-stocked caddies containing salt and pepper shakers, napkins, and ketchup packets. It was always nice when the previous shift left her a clean place--not that it mattered, as business was slow at this time of night and she'd have plenty of time to find things to tidy up.

She walked around the front counter into the ""back of house area"", where she hung up her coat and purse on the pegs near the office door and gently knocked on the swinging saloon door leading to the kitchen.

""Evenin', Junior. Gonna clock in and restock the pie display. Let me know if you need anything.""

A stocky, balding man with a sheen of sweat across his forehead looked up from the tomato slicer and grunted. Hank Junior, or Junior as anyone familiar with the diner called him, had inherited the place from his father after he'd died. A quiet, authoritative sort of man, agreeable enough as long as you did your job and didn't take too many smoke breaks on your shift. He looked back down and continued sawing away at another beefsteak tomato.

Cerise entered the walk-in cooler, grabbed a thawed Key Lime pie and kicked the door shut behind her with one graceful swing of a leg. She walked back up to the front counter, lifted the glass top off of the pie display, removed the empty pie tray, and placed the fresh pie in it's place. 

She scarcely had time to wipe her hands on the front of her apron before the tiny bell tinkled out another happy greeting. 

A short, disheveled looking man in his sixties with a brown coat and faded blue stocking cap entered the diner and shuffled into the corner booth on the far side of the diner, near the restrooms. Cerise gave him a smile and flirtatious wink.

""There's my boyfriend, coming to check up on me. How's life treatin' ya, Dave?""

The man looked up at her and sucked his teeth. 

""Aw, hell, Cerise, if I'd knew we was still goin' hot and heavy I'd brought you flowers.""

Cerise giggled and brought over a hot cup of coffee with a spoon and 3 sugars. Dave took the cup and smelled the hot steam rising from it, nodding appreciatively.

""How much for the joe, sweetheart?""

""Same price as always, Dave. Your pretty smile is all I charge.""

Cerise gave him another playful wink and walked back behind the counter. She liked Dave. He was a bit down on his luck. Had been for as long as she had known him, really. When he wasn't at the diner, he could be found at the bus station nearby, looking for dropped change or empty cans to trade in for cash. He never bothered anyone--on the contrary, he was quiet, sober, and always kept the staff company on late night shifts when it got a little spooky being alone.

Junior looked through the small open partition between the kitchen and the front counter where orders could wait to be served and nodded to Cerise.

""Dave get his coffee?""

""Yep, he's all set. Need anything?""

""Nah. Gonna go out back and have a smoke. Holler if I get an order.""

He plodded through the back of house and opened the back door leading to a fenced-in concrete slab where the dumpsters were placed.

Cerise watched him leave, then turned back around to begin assembling silverware into napkin-wrapped sets and was startled to see a man sitting on one of the stools at the front counter, near the pie display.¬† The bell had never rang its cheery warning. She looked over at Dave, hoping for an explanation or at least a shared look of confusion. He was asleep, head tilted back against the booth. With the poise only a waitress with her experience could possess, she recovered from the initial shock and stepped over to the man.

He was thin, of average height, with a short crop of slicked blonde hair parted on one side, and was wearing a slightly wrinkled black business suit. 

He was eyeing the pie display with a sort of desperate predation, a stare Cerise had only seen once before in a nature documentary about endangered wolves. Cerise produced a laminated menu from under the counter and placed it in front of him. He didn't seem to notice, or perhaps didn't care, and continued to stare at the pie.

""Well, howdy, can't help but notice you've taken a shine to the pie. Best pie you can get in these parts. Can I get you a slice, maybe a coffee to go with it?"" 

After a moment, the man wrenched his gaze from the pie and looked at her. His eyes were icy blue and Cerise thought she could see the entire diner reflected in them. He coughed wetly, and glanced down at the menu. He spoke only two words, in a low, harsh tone:

""I'm hungry.""

Cerise knew there was something wrong with the man. She'd seen it all before, of course. Drunks, or a traveling salesman that had taken just one too many pills to stay awake and was having the mother of all freakouts. Most times, they'd enter and leave with no trouble. Junior had a reputation for keeping the place trouble-free, and most people obliged. And besides, Dave was here. He was old but a second pair of fists in a fight was better than nothing.

No, this man wasn't trouble--not regular, boys-will-be-boys, ""aw shucks we're just having fun"" trouble--he was wrong. But until something actually happened, she'd have to play it cool.

""Well, you're at the right place if you're hungry. Take a gander at the menu, and in the meantime I'll tell the cook we got a hungry one on our hands.""

She offered a friendly smile and tried her best to walk to the rear of the diner without turning around to look back at the man. She failed at this. She glanced over her shoulder but the man was not looking at her, only studying the menu like it was a strange, alien artifact. She opened the door to the back exit and waved Junior over.

""We got a real doozy of a fella, Junior. Think he might be a tweaker. Says he's hungry.""

Junior pressed his cigarette into the stone bricks of the diner's exterior, and put it back into the pocket of his apron.

""Cerise, a man bein' hungry ain't nothin' to go hysterical over. I'll be in the kitchen. Just put his order in and quit freaking yourself out."" He walked back inside and let the door swing shut.

Cerise sighed, sucked in a breath of chilly desert air and followed him. She walked back to the front counter where the man had folded the menu shut in front of him. His eyes were wide and unblinking. Cerise produced a pen and pad of paper from her apron pocket and¬† prepared to take his order.

""Okay, what can I get you tonight, hon?""

The man slowly looked up at her. He licked his dry lips and began to speak.

""4 fried eggs. Bacon. And sausage. Toast. 6 Pancakes. With syrup and fruit.""

Cerise nodded at each entry, trying to stay professional but inwardly astonished at the volume of food. Hell, this man really was hungry.

""All righty sir, I'll just go back and--""

The man coughed loudly.

""Not done. Large order of hashbrowns. A cheeseburger. With bacon. A vanilla milkshake. A coffee. Thank you.""

Cerise had lost all professional impartiality and was staring at him, eyes wide. Then she remembered herself and blinked a few times, and tried to regain her inflappable waitress stoicism. 

""Well, The cook will get right on all that. Hope you saved room for that pie.""

She nearly ran to the kitchen. Junior was inside, sagely observing a fly circling the flourescent lights. 

""Hope you're ready to cook. Here's you're order."" She rolled her eyes at him. Junior mouthed the order to himself silently.

""I thought this guy was alone.""

Cerise leaned back and threw up her hands in dramatic exasperation.

""A man being hungry is nothing to go hysterical over, Junior."" She rolled her eyes and marched back up front.

At the front counter, the man was still sitting there, but he was different now. A look of pain was on his face, and he gripped the countertop tightly with both hands, knuckles white. He looked at Cerise with an almost pitiable expression of despair.

""How. Much longer. Ma'am? So hungry."" 

The man's voice was pleading, childlike in its insistence. His hollow cheeks shone pale in the harsh light. Cerise almost lost her fear over the concern she felt for the man.

""Well the cheeseburger will take the longest, but the eggs and all that won't take much time. I'll get your coffee and milkshake right now."" 

The man stared blankly at her, and nodded after a moment. Dave had also awoken at some point, and was eyeing the man with barely veiled suspicion. He shot Cerise a knowing look, almost telepathic in its own way: are we going to have a problem with this guy?

Cerise returned a look of her own: just keep an eye out for now. She hoped the intended meaning was clear. Dave looked at her, then nodded and turned back to his coffee. He shifted slightly in his seat so he could observe the man better.

Cerise poured the coffee and brought it over to the man, then went to work preparing the milkshake. 4 huge scoops of vanilla ice cream, milk and a splash of vanilla syrup went into the motorized mixer, and she expertly blended it into a frothy slurry--not too thick, not too runny--then she poured it into a clear glass and topped it with whipped cream and a cherry. This she also placed in front of the man. 

He regarded it with a look a man lost in a desert might reserve for a well spring. He removed the straw and spoon from the glass, gripped it with both hands, and loudly gulped the contents down, unmindful of his astonished observers. When he finally set the glass down empty, his mouth had a thick ring of cream that slowly dripped down his chin and onto his suit collar. If the previous events hadn't rattled her so much, Cerise would have found it amusing. Now, it was just bizarre and slightly grotesque. She offered him a napkin and he absent-mindedly dabbed his face and neck. 

""Order up!"" Junior belted from the partition. Cerise could almost hear the disbelief and amusement in his voice.

Cerise grabbed a large serving tray and began assembling the man's many plates onto it. I better get one hell of a tip out of this, she thought. She returned to the man and laid out his feast before him. He had recovered from his milkshake episode and was eyeing the plates of food greedily.

""Here you go sir. If you need a refill on that coffee just holler, otherwise I'll leave you be."" 

The man ignored her and began to shovel the food into his gaping maw. His skin had taken on a sallow, glistening, sickly shade and Cerise could almost see¬† a vaporous steam rolling off of him from the exertions he made to consume as much as possible, in as short a time as possible. 

After a moment, he threw his fork and knife to the floor, and in a howl of frustration began scooping runny eggs, strips of bacon and meat, lumps of potatoes into both hands and shoving them into his mouth. 

Cerise couldn't believe it. He was a man possessed, disregarding all humanity in his pursuit of satiating this gluttonous, impossible appetite. She turned to Dave, and he locked terrified eyes with her. Those eyes said it all.

Call the police.

Cerise slowly backed away and tried to casually return to the kitchen, but panic won out and she stumbled wildy into the back area reaching into her purse blindly for her cellphone. After her fingers returned nothing useful, she realized she had left her phone in the car.

She raced into the kitchen, slamming through the saloon doors and making them crash against the wall. Junior jerked up and turned to face her in shock.

""Cerise, what the hell-""

She grabbed his shoulders and locked panicked eyes with him.

""Call the police, Junior.""

Junior opened his mouth to speak, but glanced through the partition to the man in the dining room, saw the scene taking place, and cursed under his breath.

""Ah shit. Come with me.""

They partly walked, partly ran into the back office, where Junior picked up the phone and dialed the number to the local police. After a few moments, he spoke.

""Hey Diane, yeah, it's Junior. We might have a situation here at the diner. Yeah, might be a real circus. Ok, yeah. I appreciate it.""

Junior was still talking as Cerise slowly left the office and walked into the hallway leading to the front counter. The loud noises of slurping and chewing had stopped. Suddenly, a crash of broken glass and a harsh cry jolted her body into panic mode. She could hear Junior loudly curse as she ran back up to the counter. That man must have broken into the damn pie display to eat it, she thought. Goddammit.

But what she saw as she reached the sounds of chewing and smacking that had started up again sent her into a crescendo of hysterical, deafening screams. 

The pie display was indeed broken, but the man wasn't there. He was at the booth where Dave had been sitting, and was using a jagged shard of glass to saw into Dave's bare chest, tearing off thick chunks of flesh and slurping them down between barely finished chews. He stopped and turned back to look at Cerise. His mouth and neck dripped and hung with gore and viscera, a sinister glint of animalistic hunger in his eyes. 

He smiled for the first time, then, and spoke through a mouthful of blood and flesh. 

""I think I'll take that pie, now.""

The coffee machine that used to belch steam and short out now purrs like new. My boss said he ‚Äúfinally saw my potential‚Äù and gave me a raise.
My back pain disappeared‚Äîno more muscle fibers screaming in agony when I bent over. Even the local bartender left her number on the bill. Things have been looking up.

And my son?

He smiles more.

His eyes still don‚Äôt move quite right. Still feel a second too slow. But when he looks at me now, I feel warmth instead of dread. He hums sometimes‚Äîquiet, tuneless little sounds that seem to settle the air around him, like a pressure lifting.

I caught myself laughing with him the other day.
In the pit of my stomach, it felt wrong. But I didn‚Äôt stop.

There was a moment last week, sitting in the living room, when I realized the walls didn‚Äôt seem to lean inward anymore. The windows let in real sunlight‚Äînot that sickly yellow haze I‚Äôd come to expect. Even the clocks ticked steadily.

I thought maybe... we were healing.
That maybe my son was going to be a blessing instead of a curse.

But then the memories started returning.
I woke up in a violent jolt, feeling my face for what I knew would be there: dried blood caking my upper lip. The nosebleeds have been worsening. I wrote down what I could recall.
There were woods. That much was clear.
I was cold. I could feel the arctic ache deep within my soul. My hands were shaking. There was blood. Smoke filled the air. I had been alone, wandering. I lost something.

Someone.

Two days ago, I opened an old photo album. Not the corrupted files. Not the glitchy cloud folders. A real one‚Äîtucked in a box I don‚Äôt remember ever seeing before.

There he was.

My son.

My REAL son.

His smile was gap-toothed, defiant. His eyes lit up with some joke he hadn‚Äôt even told yet.
And beside him, A smudge. Or was it a shadow?

My hand reached out to touch the page, and I recoiled when it hissed. Like something living had been disturbed.

That night, my son‚Äîthe one who lives with me now‚Äîcrawled into bed beside me. Held my arm. He said:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre remembering too fast.‚Äù

Now, everything‚Äôs too good.
Strangers hold the door for me. Offer to pay for my things. Smiles stick an uncomfortably long time.
A scratch ticket I bought on a whim turned out to be worth $10,000.
My sister texted me yesterday to say she‚Äôs flying in. Said she ‚Äúhad big news to share.‚Äù
No matter how good these things seem, I know what‚Äôs happening.

The more good fortune that blooms around me, the more cracks open up beneath it.
Like flowers growing from a grave.

Last night I dreamt of the entity.

It wasn‚Äôt smoke, exactly.

It was emptiness in the shape of memory. A hollow silhouette, shifting and writhing as if trying to choose what form to take. It didn‚Äôt speak with a voice but with absence‚Äîwords that pulled thoughts out of me, like teeth.
It found me in that clearing, the night I had lost my real son.

The night I begged and screamed to the universe to give him back.
I pleaded until my vocal cords ripped. I would‚Äôve done anything to undo what had happened.

My screams replaced the atmosphere around me, but never reached anyone.

Then the entity appeared with an offering.

Not my boy, but something close enough that I could pretend.

Something that would grow, mimic, adapt.
Something I could hold.

All it wanted was the memory. The pain. The truth.

And I gave it everything I had.

Today, I noticed something missing.
Not from the house.

From me.

I stood in the mirror and tried to remember my fake son's face‚Äîthe one I‚Äôve lived with for years. The one I fed, clothed, tried to love.
It was slipping.

Softening around the edges.

Like I‚Äôm waking from a dream I‚Äôve been stuck in too long.
He asked me to stop remembering.
He said:

‚ÄúIf you forget again, I can stay.‚Äù

But now I can‚Äôt forget.

Because when I remember my real son, his name burns behind my eyes.

Because when I remember the cold, the ice, the stillness‚ÄîI know what I did.

I know why I deserved to forget.

But forgetting means letting this thing stay. Letting it walk through the world with my son‚Äôs stolen laugh. Letting it wear his smile.

And I can‚Äôt do that.

I‚Äôve come to peace with it.

Let the forest have me.
Let the thing return to silence.
Let the truth come home.

Because even if it breaks me‚Äî
I would rather grieve him forever than love a lie.

Right now, the house feels empty.
My phone has no photos again.
My sister called and said she never booked a flight.
My boss won‚Äôt return my texts.

This thing‚Äîthis echo in the shape of my son‚Äîtried to be good.

And for a time, 
it was.

He appeared in the doorway, eyes drained, body depleted.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI just didn‚Äôt want to go back.‚Äù

He‚Äôs fading as I write this.
I‚Äôm not sure what comes next.
But I remember my boy now.
His name was Eli.
And he died on a Tuesday.

Toned out? like if my feelings and I emotions weren‚Äôt there anymore, but it was gradual, I thought about leaving since my friends were taking a lot of time to arrive but when I was about to leave they arrived, so I decided to stay with them, I didn‚Äôt tell them how I felt, so I tried to act the most normal I could at first I wasn‚Äôt that bad, but around 5 I started o feel bad from my stomach and something that started to happened was like my thoughts couldn‚Äôt leave my head, an example it‚Äôs like I thought of how bad I felt and I couldn‚Äôt think of anything outside of that, if I tried to think of anything else it came back to that thought, I started to spiral and I don‚Äôt know why but I stated to think I feel like dying in need to leave, as soon I saw calmed a bit, I tried to walk around the place to calm and see if I could get better, but nothing helped so I just laid down in the floor to charge my cellphone and call an uber (my place wasn‚Äôt far 5 minutes from the place) and I left around 6, I didn‚Äôt though of anything else but getting back home, just as I arrived my friend called to ask me if I was alright (he didn‚Äôt sound mad) I told him that yeah I was fine (not that good but better) and he said they would hang out later in a restaurant I say I wouldn‚Äôt go, I tried to go to eat a coffee and cake to see if I could get better, but in the end I puked my guts out, I ended up sleeping the whole day and the next day I was supposed to go to my niece‚Äôs birthday but felt like I had tachycardia and puked more, ended up sleeping till 8 pm, I didn‚Äôt have a chance to say anything to my other friends and they posted the photos in instagram all of them without me in it, that‚Äôs when my friend‚Äôs boyfriend told me she was mad for me leaving without saying anything, in all those days I didn‚Äôt received any messages outside from the call, but my friend‚Äôs boyfriend told later (like two days later) sent a message saying she was pissed I left without saying anything and that even one of the friends (that I don‚Äôt know that well) was thinking of going to search for me, I explained to my friend (some) of what happened but she said it was no excuse and to consider they also have anxiety and they worried, I did felt bad for that but then when I hear of going to search for my I felt it was an overreaction, I couldn‚Äôt go elsewhere than home, I only took at most seven minutes from the Uber to accept my journey and leaving me in my apartment, as soon as I arrived I received the call (I had another two from the same person but it was one followed by the next call), I feel like my friend‚Äôs boyfriend told and the other person who said to go and find me exaggerated, which I know it sounds cruel but makes me mad to them and to myself, I hate drama and this is the first big fight we have, I don‚Äôt know how to deal with it and I‚Äôve been tired of everything, they don‚Äôt know that but things haven‚Äôt been that well and this just adds up, I wish they could just thought like ‚Äúoh most probably they went home, okey lets continue‚Äù instead of reacting like that, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of how I was raised but I wouldn‚Äôt have reacted like that, but now maybe it‚Äôs mental illness (they think or I have bipolar disorder, autism or borderline personality disorder so since they don‚Äôt know what I have they can‚Äôt give me any medication for that) but I feel sad, but at the same time angry and my mind it‚Äôs thinking you ruin everything but we know they are going to leave, you know they are going to leave, it‚Äôs better you don‚Äôt talk to them again and I know for a fact I love them and will probably end up committing unaliving without them and I think it‚Äôs most for the best, my head it‚Äôs a mess and it doesn‚Äôt help all those messages saying that they are mad, I really didn‚Äôt think it was a problem and genuinely don‚Äôt understand why they reacted like that, AITA for leaving without telling them?

We started messaging and ended up meeting for coffee, and it went really well. he said he was looking for an fwb (with the possibility of becoming a relationship later on), and i told him how i wasn't really looking for just sex with someone because im still a virgin and i want my first time to be special and with someone i care about. he was very understanding about this and did not pressure me into anything. 

But i really like this guy, he is incredibly sweet and understanding and super fucking hot, and i ended up suggesting that he teach me how to give head. honestly the whole experience was great because he didnt rush me and let me get comfortable before starting anything (we talked for like 2.5 hours before starting to do anything, and we did everything at my pace). overall he has been super patient and lets me have complete control and we don't do anything outside of my comfort zone.

Afterwards he was super nice and took me home, and we have done it a few more times since then. i dont know how to express to him that i would like to explore more with him, and have made some excuses to continue seeing him even though he thinks he doesnt need to teach me anymore.

I also feel like our arrangement isnt completely shallow, like we talk about things outside of sex, and actually have deep conversations.

However, he is very apprehensive about the fact that i am 18, he thinks its kind of a big gap and has expressed early on that he wasnt sure about dating me because of my age. but now that we have gotten to know each other and deepened our connection i want to try and ask for something more, but i have no clue how. This is the first man i have ever done anything with and i have no experience in relationships at all, and i really dont want to mess this up.

However, every time I drink half and half in my coffee in the morning, I barely make it to the toilet. It takes four trips to the bathroom for the explosive diarrhea to stop. Half and Half supposedly contains only a trace amount of lactose in it. So I am not sure if its lactose. I am not a milk drinker and while I like cheese on foods, like pizza, I don't really have a gut reaction to eating cheese on pizza or even having cheese shreds on a salad. Its the half and half in the coffee that does me in.

Since I have stopped eating any dairy, which includes ice cream, and adding half and half to my coffee, my life has vastly improved. Diarrhea wasn't my only symptom - My overwhelming life long depression, my anhedonia (inability to feel things), my intense brain fog, have all improved significantly. I am a much nicer person, according to my husband. My brain fog was so bad that I really thought I had early dementia. I haven't felt happiness in years, but now all of sudden I am interested in things again, I even have had my ability to visualize things in my mind, return. I can once again imagine how something might look if I were to create it. I can plan things out. My memory has also really improved. Its so nice to feel happiness and appreciation for things around me again. I also have better energy, which leads me to think that dairy was causing a lot of systemic inflammation and gut problems beyond diarrhea and bloating. My arthritis in my hands has stopped flaring up, so my knuckles and wrist joints aren't tender and swollen like they used to be.

I am afraid to add dairy of any kind back into my diet at this point. I can't get over how good I feel.  Has this happened to anyone else after they gave up dairy? Please let me know what you think. Thanks

How should we ethically and legally pay remote interns?,"Hello everyone! We‚Äôre a very early-stage startup, recently registered and slowly marking traction. A few universities we‚Äôve worked with suggested we consider offering internships to their students, especially since our first few events went well and had good engagement.

We're a small team running mostly free/low-cost services, so having a few interns could really help us manage work, but we want to make sure it's a fair and positive experience for them too.

We read some horror stories on several subreddits regarding bad internship programs.

Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre currently thinking of offering:

* Remote, flexible internship (10 hours/week, they set their schedule)
* Coffee + pastry allowance
* Free training/mentorship directly from the founding team
* Access to all our tools, platforms, and learning resources
* Bookings at a co-working space if one is nearby

We want to do this 100% legally and ethically, no exploiting free labor here. We're not able to offer big salaries just yet, but we also don‚Äôt want students to feel underpaid or taken advantage of.

So here‚Äôs our question:

What kind of compensation should we offer for a remote internship like this? What should we refer to decide this? Our interns will not always be British or in the UK. We don't want to just be legal in the Uk, we want to decide what actually works for both parties. 

We‚Äôd love input from anyone with experience, but any advice is appreciated.

My mother, who is divorced, has a new partner, my stepdad. Their relationship has been tense and full of arguments lately. I have four siblings:
‚Ä¢ A 25-year-old sister who lives on her own,
‚Ä¢ A 24-year-old brother who is autistic and cannot care for himself,
‚Ä¢ A 13-year-old little sister,
‚Ä¢ And a 9-month-old baby brother.

Despite being the middle child, I carry the most responsibility at home.
Recently, my uncle from Per√∫ - who only speaks Spanish, has been staying with us. He‚Äôs in his 30s and a bit reckless. I‚Äôm fluent in both Spanish and Norwegian, as is my mom, but my stepdad and siblings only speak Norwegian.

Last night, while I was lying in bed, I heard loud crashing sounds‚Äîplates being thrown, and screaming. Then I heard my baby brother upstairs crying uncontrollably. It sounded like trauma. I rushed upstairs and saw my stepdad in the hallway shouting ‚Äúhelp!‚Äù The screaming was coming from my mom‚Äôs room.
I started yelling at the door, demanding they open it. After a moment of me screaming violently, my stepdad opened the door. Inside, I saw my mother holding a broken shard of a plate, cutting herself, shards everywhere on the floor slabbing my feet. My stepdad was trying to calm the baby and stop her, but she wouldn‚Äôt listen.
I took over. I yelled at her firmly and told her to put the shard down, that no matter what was going on, doing this in front of a baby was unacceptable. Eventually, she listened and dropped the shard. She sat down crying.
I immediately took the screaming baby downstairs to my 13-year-old sister‚Äôs room to calm him down and play with him. My uncle came in, confused. I briefly explained what happened but chose not to involve him, he‚Äôs not someone I can trust in serious situations. He just went back outside to videocall some woman from Asia he‚Äôs been talking to, even though he‚Äôs married.

All my siblings were crying, except me. My autistic older brother, who‚Äôs recently been struggling with suicidal thoughts (he is receiving professional help now), tried to flee to the library. I stopped him. I told him clearly that he could not leave the house. I was already juggling too much; taking care of a baby, our sister, and our mother and I couldn‚Äôt risk him hurting himself.
After some convincing, he agreed to stay.
I then went upstairs to my mom‚Äôs room and told both her and my stepdad straight: if they don‚Äôt take this seriously and make changes, I‚Äôll contact child protective services. They both stayed quiet. My stepdad nodded and said he agreed with me. I told them clearly: one more scream, one more traumatic outburst, and I won‚Äôt hesitate.
After that, I talked to my siblings and told them the same thing: if they hear anything unusual; screaming, fighting, anything they should come to me immediately, and I will call child protective services. They all agreed.

I left the house for a while to get some air and clear my head. I walked in the forest and called my girlfriend. I told her everything. She really appreciated me opening up. We‚Äôre very close. She offered to let me take a bus to her place and spend the night to calm down, but I declined. I needed to stay home to make sure everything was safe.
After about half an hour, I returned home. My baby brother was laughing again, calmed down by my little sister. She really stepped up. My older brother was in his room, quietly crying while working on an exam, but he stayed home and didn‚Äôt harm himself. That was a relief.
My mother and stepdad were talking things through. My uncle stayed out of the way, still confused and not very involved. I went to my room, had many beers, and eventually passed out.

When I woke up, things seemed calmer. Apparently, the family had grilled together to ease the tension. My mother and stepdad were communicating better. My mom apologized to each of us, including me. My stepdad sincerely thanked me for handling the situation when he couldn‚Äôt. He said I was ‚Äúthe only adult man in the house‚Äù at that moment.
Now it‚Äôs early in the morning, 4 a.m. and I‚Äôm brewing coffee and journaling. Things feel normal for now, but I‚Äôm staying alert. I know what‚Äôs at stake.
I am told my mother that if she doesn't seek professional help then I will call child protective services and they will take her baby. It hurts me that I have to be so harsh but I feel it in my heart that now is the time.

The odd part is that I am unable to cry, I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me. I clearly feel a lot about it, but I have just been traumatized so much that I have lost my ability to cry because I grew up fast.

I immigrated to north America a while ago, less than a decade, I feel that it improved me a lot as a human being on a lot of aspects, I see things from multiple perspectives, and it opened my eyes to the world.

It was a long path, starting from below 0 when you immigrate is not easy, especially when you don't have family (not that it is going to be of a big help, but still), you have to compete with natives who've been there their whole life, know the country and speaks the language times better than you (at the least at the beginging).  
  
Now, despite being a tantalizing project that I was able to achieve thanks to Allah, I kind of get a feeling that it was a bad move, and that I just should have stayed in Morocco and just suck it up, I miss a lot of thing from back home, and one of those is hearing the Athan, smelling the food, or just drinking a coffee with a bunch of friends, here pretty much everything seems superficial.

I had my own reasons to immigrate, and money wasn't one of them, but I would like to hear from you guys, those who immigrated, and those who didn't.

What were your motives? do you have any regrets? something you would have done differently? any thoughts for the future?

I am typing this as an informal message, I really don't care about grammar in this.

 I just got my degree as a paralegal.
 I also have certificates that I was required to get during my schooling and I interned under a circuit court judge, the professors gave me recommendations, and yet I cannot land a good job. 

Due to the difficulties of getting hired as a paralegal with only internship experience, I took a job as a law clerk. The law firm I work at is so abysmal to the point they have these insane rules. 

Rule 1) support staff such as law clerks ,accounting, record keeping, none of us are allowed to talk to the lawyers and paralegals. If we need something we are instructed to go to the office manager who will go to the attorneys and paralegals. 

Rule2) your tasks that you were assigned that week as a law clerk are yours and yours alone. You are not allowed to help your fellow law clerks or support staff with theirs even if you have nothing to do. I got written by third week there for not knowing where the extra supplies were. We have two supply rooms of which I was only shown those two. I was not made aware of the third room. When I brought that up I was told I should have asked more questions. 

3) law clerks are only allowed at their desk if waiting for their lunch break  or updating legal binders and if you are at your desk for more than 10 minutes you get written up 
We aren't even allowed to eat lunch at our desk. 

These are just 3 of the rules 

The office manager hires everyone including the  paralegals and attorneys. Which in my state is a violation of the state bar.

Also, as law clerks the assigned tasks include picking up trash, restocking the break rooms ,cleaning coffee pots, delivering and posting mail. We do absolutely nothing legal related which I was informed I would get legal experience as a law clerk. 

Not to mention the other law clerk who has been there for over a year,  they hold her in such high regard. That when she openly admitted to not liking me and said she'd rather work with men they told me I will be terminated at the end of my 60 days probation.

It started acting strange, with a long delay before coffee would come out. During this delay there's either sloshing water sounds in the machine or motor grinding noise. I also had noise previously but it sounded normal (like centrifuge spinning). The coffee started tasting weird. 

I decided to descale and rinsed 3x. Coffee was good for 3-4 cups. Then one day I tried it and it tasted like straight up ethanol / chemical / plastic / something that almost made me vomit. 

I'm now rinsing it again but not sure if it'll fix things.

I will be contacting customer service but wondering if anyone else had a similar experience?

1mdr4g7,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1mdr4g7/dialing_in_beans_with_wildly_different/,Dialing in beans with wildly different recommended grind sizes on a ZP6,"Apologies if these questions are too basic, but I recently bought a ZP6 Special and have been enjoying it immensely. My go-to setting has been around a 5.2, and I have read many posts in this forum suggesting that most people have the best luck in the 4.5-5.5 range.

With that in mind, I recently picked up two Onyx releases. [Uganda Long Miles Lunar Station](https://onyxcoffeelab.com/products/uganda-long-miles-lunar-station?variant=42045753065570) and [Bolivia 4 Llamas](https://onyxcoffeelab.com/products/bolivia-4-llamas-lactic-washed?variant=41901061210210). Onyx has recommended grind sizes and recipes on their site. The Uganda recipe calls for 490¬µm while the Bolivia calls for 766¬µm. Being so different, I have looked at a couple resources to determine where those measurements match up on the ZP6. 

Based on the ZP6 Special chart at [Honest Coffee Guide](https://honestcoffeeguide.com/coffee-grind-size-chart/), the Uganda would land at around 1.9 clicks and the Bolivia around 4.5. Based on the grind conversion chart found in [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/18gvdl6/grinder_conversion_spreadsheet_for_some_popular/), the Uganda would be 2.7 and the Bolivia would be 5.7. I tend to believe the latter a bit more because the conversions line up with the same settings on the Baratza Encore that Onyx's own converter reports (10 and 22, respectively).

With the acknowledgement that I know I just need to experiment, I have 2 questions:

1. Why is coffee grinding so wildly imprecise and seemingly difficult to convert between products, and is there any practical way to measure your grind size in ¬µm at home? Or am I just overthinking it and I need to just get a general sense for what medium fine, medium, medium course, etc. look like.

2. When you see a coffee that recommends a medium fine grind size like 490 / 2.7 clicks, are you really going that low, or do you stick to your preferred range no matter what? I feel like my biggest learning hurdle at the moment is seeing some people recommend medium fine as a default, while others recommend medium course, and I have no understanding of the discrepancy. Is it just personal preference? Is it bean-specific? Am I just aiming for a grind size that lets me hit a target drawdown time? Any insight would be awesome.

1mdr32z,https://www.reddit.com/r/manifestingSP/comments/1mdr32z/it_all_worked_out_how_i_manifested_everything_i/,It all worked out!! How I manifested everything I hoped for!,"Hi everyone!

After being on this platform for a while and having the most frustrating times trying to manifest, I can now finally say that my life has turned around 180 and I am finally where i alwasy wanted to be. This is not something that happened overnight. I truly believe all the days of frustration, the 'i was so close' and moments of giving up, were a part of this journey. So wherever you are in your journey: know that we never truly know where we are in this. Life will show you when its time.

So to keep the spirits high I will share all the things I have manifested over all this time and now finally having the last big change tying it all together. May you all stay strong, encouraged and kind towards yourself. It will come true my loves!

A little background story: I am 30 years old and being the typical millennial- I could not effort a house, always had temporary contracts at work (jobs that would also pay way too low and never really gave any outlook on building a career I could be proud of). But most of the time I would have a shitty job for some months, then they ran out of budget, or work was low and I would have to leave and look for something else anyway. I was single for 8+years and even tho I did have dates, it just never worked out or just turned into another situation-ship  that left me feeling empty. My physical health was a mess because I was always tired, unmotivated and just felt like I was on autopilot. My life was just extremely boring, I always felt like I was running behind and just living 10%.

Then I found out about Neville Goddard. And to be honest: I'm Dutch. We are raised being rational and really just don't believe in things like manifesting. We have a saying ""just act normal, thats already weird enough'. And so it was hard for me to admit that well..I tried everything turning things around, but the rational ways weren't working at all. So yes: I'm gonna deep dive into this manifesting thing. And so I did. I started scripting, visualising, seeing myself as that version I wanted to be. Seeing myself buying my dream home, with a wonderful partner and lots of animals I could give a warm home. Having a fulfilling job, maybe even my own business and being financially independent and free. Having the buzzing social life where I am surrounded with like minded people. I could hear our chats, I could taste the Aperol Spritz we would drink and feel the warm sun on my skin. It was all so so real.

Most of my life I had this gift of being a daydreamer. Even tho my dad would bash me for being one (again, dutch mentality) I realised how much I have lost of that gift when becoming older and seeing how grey and soulless the world was. So this was key point number one in my manifestations: I needed to train my ability to daydream again. I would meditate but for me this was daydreaming, letting my mind run free and just see where i would end up. Watching movies and totally let myself get carried away, read books before bed so my dreams would become more fun. This way it became easier for me to visualise.

Another point, and I think this is the most important one: dont try too hard. When i really needed something to happen (mostly money things) I would put so so much pressure on me visualising it. Constantly saying: 'I already have it all', but somehow it completely went the other way and I didnt get even close to what I hoped for. But I also realised I didnt believe i was able to get it. Because not long ago I was convinced I was born for bad luck. I never had moments of great opportunities, of job offers that would give me stability, of meeting the right person. I was always on the wrong place at the wrong time. So understanding where this came from and feeling how deep this believe was embedded in my body and mind was confronting, but also: the way forward. Because now I could tackle that. Writing it all down, stop looking for proof of bad luck but literally write down things that went good today (a nice coffee, seeing a cute dog, sun on my skin) It was getting me out of this mentality! And so understanding that manifestations and good things come in small packages too, I saw that everyday i was blessed. Once open for the small things, big things started to come in!

I met my wonderful partner my coincidence and we both live in Melbourne but our visas are running out on the exact same day. So my anxiety of going back home was gone now that I have this new adventure coming up with someone I love. We will be travelling more and eventually settle down somewhere in Europe where it's warm. Then not long ago I got the amazing opportunity to work remotely so now we could both finance our travels and I can save up money to create my own product and bring it on the market soon. I started my own Youtube Channel and all of a sudden my subscribers skyrocketed and I'm even getting offers for sponsorships. This created a new form of income and for the first time in my life I don't have to worry about money. Saving up for bigger things like my own place is so new to me, but i finally can!  And maybe the best thing of all: i have never felt healthier than ever. Physically and mentally i am in the best shape. The biggest lessons I learned is gratefulness. Seeing the small things and getting yourself out of this 'it will never happen for me' mindset! I was so stuck into my core belief that I was just made for bad luck and I always compared myself to others. But holding yourself accountable for these thoughts is a game changer. Why you? Manifesting is literally working with energy. It makes no exemptions who to serve. The only one who does...is you.

I hope this helps atleast one of you to continue. To not give up and understand that a set back maybe isnt even a set back, but a check in from the universe if you are ready for something bigger.",9,1753932707.0,manifestingSP,1,1.0,False
1mdr2lx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1mdr2lx/had_my_first_ever_bible_studywith_mormon/,Had my first ever Bible study‚Äîwith Mormon missionaries. Here's how it went.,"Hi everyone! I wanted to share a recent experience I had that I think some of you might find interesting (and maybe encouraging).

So, long story short, I responded to a local ad for a ‚ÄúChristian hangout community‚Äù without realizing it was run by LDS missionaries. üòÖ When I got a text from them, I clarified right away that I'm a practicing Roman Catholic and not interested in converting, but that I'd still be open to a Bible study out of curiosity and respect‚Äîespecially if it could be in a public space. They were very kind and respectful of that!

We ended up meeting at a coffee shop, and I came prepared: my RSV-2CE Bible, a Catechism, and a lot of handwritten notes just in case the conversation turned toward LDS doctrine. (I may or may not have spent way too long tabbing every book of the Bible beforehand.) üò≠

They wanted to study the Parable of the Lost Sheep, and the discussion stayed pretty light, but I could tell there were moments they tried to gently introduce LDS-specific beliefs (like the Great Apostasy). I didn‚Äôt challenge every point, but I did ask thoughtful questions, and I brought up a few historical references like the early Church councils, the Great Schism, and Apostolic succession. I even explained the story behind Our Lady of Guadalupe when one of them asked if that was a separate sect of Catholicism!

The most memorable part for me was when they asked if I wanted a copy of the Book of Mormon. I was honest‚ÄîI told them I don‚Äôt agree with it scripturally, but that I do want to understand their perspective better, and they genuinely appreciated that. They gave me a copy along with a Restoration pamphlet, which I accepted respectfully.

All in all, I was surprised by how positive and respectful the encounter was. I'm fully committed to the Catholic Church and made that clear, but I think there‚Äôs something valuable in meeting others where they are and engaging in real, charitable dialogue. If anything, it made me even more grateful for the historical and theological richness of Catholicism‚Äîand reminded me that it‚Äôs okay to be curious, even if you have no intention of leaving the Church.

Would love to hear if anyone else has had similar experiences‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs with LDS missionaries, Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, or just interfaith dialogue in general. How did you approach it?",2,1753932667.0,Catholicism,1,1.0,False
1mdr2gd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mdr2gd/is_this_actually_rpe/,Is this actually r*pe???,"So around a month ago I (17F) downloaded a dating app. On this dating app I met Steve (19M) and we began to talk a lot, and we met up that day. We ended up making out but that was about it as I had told him I felt uncomfortable going further. For context, I am fairly inexperienced and before I met Steve I had only ever made out with an ex of mine and that was all. After that initial meetup, we saw each other around 4 times each time more happened. The more things that happened, the more he pressured me into. On our 2nd meetup, he kept placing my hands on his boner no matter how many times I pulled away. On our 3rd meetup, while we kissed he took off his pants and placed my hand on his bare genitals without asking. On our 4th meetup, he touched my bare breasts under my shirt without asking me if I was okay with it after I explicitly told him I felt nervous about him touching me sexually.

Before our 5th meetup, I sent him a message on my discomfort and asked that the next time we saw each other he wouldn‚Äôt be sexual. He agreed and told me that it would just be a simple hang out and coffee before I had work that morning. When I got in his car, everything was normal for about 30 minutes. Halfway through us driving around, he told me he had to go home and that I should just go with him until my shift started. I felt uneasy but decided to go with it anyways since he was the one driving me. When we got into his apartment he brought me straight to his bedroom and I knew it was an awful idea, but I stayed knowing that if I left I‚Äôd have no ride and I‚Äôd also have to let my mom know where I was (she was heavily against me going to his house). He asked me to sit with him on his bed, and as soon as I did he began to kiss me. I reciprocated and just hoped it wouldn‚Äôt go further, but he began to place my hands where I didn‚Äôt want them again no matter how much i pulled away or said no he would just say ‚Äúokay sorry‚Äù and then five minutes later continuously do the same thing. It finally hit a breaking point when I told him I didn‚Äôt want to touch him sexually anymore, and he told me it would be difficult to drive with a boner. He begged me to continue touching him so he could still drive me to work and told me that my mouth was the only thing that would work. I don‚Äôt know why I did but I gave in and did what he asked, I knew I didn‚Äôt want to do it, I knew it felt wrong, but I knew he wasn‚Äôt just going to stop asking and begging. As I did it he continuously pushed my head down to the point where I almost vomited and couldn‚Äôt breathe over five times, no matter how many times I asked him to stop he kept doing it. When it was finally close to being over, I asked him to not do anything in my mouth but he did and it only added onto my feeling of disgust with myself. It feels wrong to say this was r*pe, I feel like a lot of what happened could‚Äôve been avoided if I was stronger willed, but I don‚Äôt know what else to call it. I feel disgusted with myself when I look back on it, I dont have many people to go to about this without feeling shame, and I‚Äôm just hoping for advice.",1,1753932654.0,Advice,4,0.99,False

You must get a balcony room! Idc if you have to scrimp and save, that balcony enhances the experience by a hundred fold. It was our favorite place to sit with a glass of wine in the evening. And you will have waning sunlight till almost 11pm

We had the elite drink package. Which got us the Kendall Jackson Chardonnay. Multiple times a server had to go hunt down a bottle‚Ä¶like WTH? The first days we got conflicting info from servers about what exactly is included‚Ä¶specialty coffee? Told no. They are included. 
Can of water? Told no. They‚Äôre included. 

My biggest gripe is with the room cards. It is a huge pain to have to whip that thing out every time you order a drink. There has to be a better system. Half the time we didn‚Äôt sign the tab, so what‚Äôs the point. Can‚Äôt they just go to a bracelet that gets scanned or something?

I've been making pour overs for several years now, but have recently upgraded my setup from a Kingrinder K6 to a Fellow Ode Gen 2. I'm also using Third Wave Water now (which was a major upgrade from a water filter!) 

Up til now I've bought locally roasted coffees, or ordered different light roasts through my Trade subscription. But at this point, I'm looking into starting some subscriptions with a few highly regarded specialty roasters. I specifically have my eye on roasters like Hydrangea, S&W, Subtext, H&S, and Brandywine.

My question is, in your experience are the Ode Gen 2 stock burrs equipped to adequately highlight the tasting notes that these roasters have built such esteemed reputations around? I know the Gen 2 stock burrs typically produce higher body brews but more of a ""blended"" flavor profile. This terminology kind of worries me that I'd be missing out on what these coffees are truly meant to offer; I'd love to experience the spectrum of fruity, juicy, floral notes found across different washed, natural, and experimental methods.

# Akamai Tooth Powder: 2025's Best Whitening Solution?

The Akamai Tooth Powder is a relatively new entrant in the oral hygiene market, promising a natural and effective solution for teeth whitening and overall dental health. Aiming to disrupt the customary toothpaste industry, Akamai leverages a blend of natural ingredients to achieve its claims of a brighter smile and improved gum health.

For consumers increasingly concerned about the chemical composition of their dental products, Akamai presents itself as a safe and sustainable choice. Its focus on natural ingredients and eco-amiable packaging aims for a conscientious audience seeking effective results without compromising their well-being or the surroundings.

## Key Features Analysis

The Akamai Tooth Powder boasts several unique features that set it apart from conventional toothpastes.**Micro-Polishing Action**

The particle size is meticulously controlled to ensure optimal cleaning without excessive abrasion, rated at an RDA (Relative Dentin Abrasion) of approximately 70, making it suitable for daily use.

**activated Charcoal Infusion**

A key component of akamai is activated charcoal, renowned for its adsorption properties. This ingredient acts like a magnet, drawing out stains and impurities from the teeth, leading to a noticeably brighter smile.

**Mineral Enrichment**

These minerals are present in bioavailable forms, allowing for efficient absorption and utilization by the tooth structure.

**Essential Oil Blend**

The powder features a unique blend of essential oils, including peppermint, spearmint, and tea tree oil, chosen for their antibacterial and breath-freshening properties. These oils work synergistically to combat harmful bacteria in the mouth, reduce inflammation, and provide a long-lasting fresh breath sensation. The concentration of each oil is carefully balanced to ensure efficacy without causing irritation.**Fluoride-Free Formulation**

Akamai is consciously formulated without fluoride, catering to consumers who prefer fluoride-free dental products. This decision aligns with the brand's commitment to natural ingredients and provides an alternative for individuals with fluoride sensitivities or concerns.

I knew it was going to be difficult but I‚Äôm finding it unbearably painful knowing that I won‚Äôt get to see my friends pretty much every day, any more. 
One specific-relatively new- friend (bi) and I became close at the beginning of this year. Long story short, I developed feelings; they were not reciprocated in the same way but we ended up becoming even closer and ended up spending most of the past four months together. We went on multiple weekend trips together, experienced our first pride together, countless coffee dates, firework watching, concerts, and got even closer, to the point of cuddling, as the time of my move grew closer. 

We exchanged letters and playlists and said a prolonged two day-long goodbye.

I‚Äôm no stranger to homoerotic friendships (unfortunately moreso the toxic kind), but this one was just unbelievably intense and grew so much over such a short period of time that we both acknowledge our friendship as a ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù. It‚Äôs also obviously come with many of our mutual friends asking if we‚Äôre dating, which has always kind of hurt. I‚Äôve never claimed we are because of our boundaries but I often couldn‚Äôt help but feel that our friendship was unlike any other I‚Äôve felt before.

I don‚Äôt think I have ever grieved something the way I am grieving being with him. We are going to stay in touch and have even planned visits but the idea of not being able to see him as much makes me queasy. 

I‚Äôm obviously devastated to not see all of my friends as much anymore, but the fact that he and I developed such an emotionally intense (yet, extremely fun and fulfilling friendship) over such a short period of time, and that it‚Äôs getting pulled away just as fast is a different kind of hurt. How long should I grieve this? Is it that serious? Why am I hurting worse than any breakup- when we‚Äôre fine and will see each other again? Was I being delusional the entire time?

I‚Äôm black, in my early 30s, and an investment banker who has quickly climbed the ranks. One of the baristas on the 8th floor in my building is a gorgeous, early to mid-30s Afro-Latino woman. There are two cafes in the building where I work, both exclusive to my firm.

The first time I saw her, I thought she was attractive. I ordered coffee as I usually would and thought nothing of it. She was very friendly, but not overly so. The following two times I saw her, I just ordered my coffee and said hello as usual, but I noticed she became more inquisitive and open, and a bit friendlier with a huge smile on her face, which I assume was due to her recognizing me now. I thought nothing of it, but noticed she was much less open and friendly with my colleagues. She mentioned how she used to drink what I ordered, but switched to a different thing with less sugar. 

I saw her today (with a double espresso shot in her hand) at the service elevator on the 10th floor of the building. I was late to a meeting and forgot my badge, so I also had to take the service elevator. I said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre [Maria] right?‚Äù She giggled, looked me directly in the eyes, and said: ‚ÄúYes! What‚Äôs your name again?‚Äù I told her (I remembered I had never introduced myself the first 2x), and she asked me how it was spelled (it‚Äôs a bit different from the standard spelling of my name). She said she liked the coffee better from the cafe on the 10th floor because it has a distinct flavor profile. I responded and commented, ‚ÄúHaha, I might need to try the coffee on this floor then, but I like coming to the 8th floor.‚Äù

About 30 minutes after seeing her (and after my meeting), I went to the cafe on her floor to finally have my first coffee. I commented about how I needed to change my order and get something with less sugar, and she said, ‚ÄúI get XYZ. I‚Äôll have to make it for you sometime.‚Äù I told her I‚Äôd take her up on that, said thanks, and walked away.

This probably sounds like a standard coffee shop interaction, but my gut feeling tells me to shoot my shot. However, I don‚Äôt want to make things awkward as I genuinely like the coffee from that floor. 

Am I being ridiculous? Should I take it a step further? I always see people discuss how men take a woman being friendly as flirting or interest, when that isn‚Äôt necessarily the case.",0,1753931369.0,dating_advice,8,0.4,False

She spilt one coffee on my seat going over a bump (i'll take that as my fault) made a mess of her pastries and brushed them onto the floor and down the side of my car. Mary didnt take out her rubbish, so when I ws driving home, the second coffee cup spilt on my carpet. I cleaned it out on Wednesday because my car needed a wash. I looked under the seat and there I found even more crumbs and flakes and an open sauce packet that spilt on my carpet. The car smells horrible and I don't know what to do or how to clean it out. One of my coworkers says I should get my car cleaned and give her the bill but idk. Any advice?",1,1753931160.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,1,1.0,False
1mdqkj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moccamaster/comments/1mdqkj1/cupone_cleaning_question/,Cup-One cleaning question,"I just got to the last filter on my 80x box for my refurb Cup-One and I have both dezcal and cleaner from urnex.

I followed the manual from Moccamaster and the instructions for ratio or powder from Urnex and everything‚Äôs great.

My question is about the cleaner (not the descaling solution).

It advertises itself as a cleaner for coffee oils in the brew basket, reservoir and server.

With the Cup-One, the brew basket is removable and washable. The server is any mug, and the reservoir doesn‚Äôt come into contact with coffee unless it overflows and sucks it in due to back pressure.

It got pretty frothy, and seemed to do its job well, but how necessary is the cleaner for the Cup-One?

I suppose if there‚Äôs any other type of reservoir pipe build up that isn‚Äôt scale, it would help to keep the machine clean. I‚Äôm going to continue to use it maybe not as often as recommended but do the descale and then clean at the end of every filter box.

Interested to see how anyone else cleans the Cup-One?",1,1753931137.0,Moccamaster,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

Selecting the perfect green cup involves understanding the technical specifications that set each model apart. Key aspects to consider include the material used, the insulation capabilities, the cup's capacity, its lid design, and its overall durability. Understanding these features enables a more informed decision-making process.

**Material Composition:** The material used in a green cup significantly impacts its durability, safety, and environmental footprint. Many top-rated green cups in 2025 utilize materials like stainless steel, borosilicate glass, or plant-based plastics. Stainless steel offers excellent durability and temperature retention,while borosilicate glass is known for its heat resistance and lack of chemical leaching. Plant-based plastics, though less durable, provide a more sustainable option to traditional plastics, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

**Insulation Technology:** For those seeking temperature retention, insulation is a critical feature. Double-walled vacuum insulation is a common technology found in premium green cups, offering superior heat and cold retention compared to single-walled cups. Some models incorporate copper lining between the walls for enhanced thermal performance, keeping beverages hot for up to 12 hours or cold for up to 24 hours. The effectiveness of the insulation is directly related to the thickness of the vacuum layer and the quality of the sealing.

**Capacity and Dimensions:** The capacity of a green cup is a key consideration based on individual needs. Options range from small espresso cups holding around 6 ounces to large travel mugs capable of carrying 20 ounces or more. Dimensions also play a role in usability, with some cups designed to fit comfortably in car cup holders, while others prioritize a wider base for stability. Balancing capacity with portability is essential for users on the go.

**Lid and Closure Design:** The lid design greatly impacts the functionality and convenience of a green cup, especially for travel mugs. Leak-proof lids with secure closures are crucial for preventing spills, while features like sliding closures or flip-top lids enable easy access to beverages.Some lids include filters for brewing loose-leaf tea or infusing fruit, adding versatility to the cup. The material of the lid, often made from BPA-free plastic or silicone, also affects its durability and ease of cleaning.

**Durability and Longevity:** A high-quality green cup should withstand daily use and maintain its performance over time. Stainless steel and borosilicate glass cups are generally more resistant to dents and cracks than plastic options. The quality of the paint or coating on the exterior also contributes to its longevity, with powder-coated finishes offering superior scratch resistance. Look for cups with robust construction and durable materials to ensure long-term value.

## Core Benefits

Owning a high-quality green cup provides numerous benefits that extend beyond simply holding beverages. From enhanced beverage enjoyment to contributing to a more sustainable lifestyle, the right green cup can significantly improve your daily routine. The core benefits frequently involve temperature control, environmental obligation, and improved health.

**Optimal Temperature Retention:** One of the primary benefits of a quality green cup,particularly those with insulation,is the ability to maintain the temperature of your beverage for extended periods. This means enjoying hot coffee or tea throughout the morning without it cooling down too quickly, or keeping cold drinks refreshingly chilled even on a hot day. This is especially valuable for commuters or those who spend long hours at work or outdoors.

**Environmentally Kind Choice:** Choosing a reusable green cup promotes environmental sustainability by reducing the reliance on disposable plastic or paper cups. By consistently using a reusable cup, individuals can significantly decrease their contribution to landfill waste and reduce the environmental impact associated with the production and disposal of single-use cups. This conscious decision aligns with a growing global emphasis on eco-friendly practices.

**Health and Safety Considerations:** High-quality green cups are typically made from materials that are free from harmful chemicals like BPA, lead, and phthalates.This ensures that your beverages remain pure and untainted, eliminating the risk of leaching chemicals into your drink, especially when exposed to heat.Opting for a safe and non-toxic green cup is a proactive step towards safeguarding your health and well-being.

**Aesthetic Appeal and Personalization:** Green cups come in a variety of shades, shapes, and designs allowing individuals to express their personal style. Whether you prefer a sleek, minimalist design or a more vibrant, patterned cup, there‚Äôs an option to suit every taste. Customization options, such as adding monograms or choosing specific colors, further enhance the personal connection with your drinkware.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions from consumers helps clarify any uncertainties and provides additional information to aid in the purchase decision. Frequently asked questions include inquiries about cleaning, compatibility, and specific use cases. Addressing these concerns leads to confident buying choices.**How do I properly clean my green cup to prevent odors and bacteria?**
Proper cleaning is essential for maintaining the hygiene and longevity of your green cup. For most cups, hand washing with warm, soapy water and a non-abrasive sponge is recommended.For stainless steel cups, a mixture of baking soda and water can definitely help remove stubborn stains and odors.Ensure all parts, including the lid and any removable components, are thoroughly cleaned. Some cups are dishwasher-safe (typically top rack only), but check the manufacturer's instructions to avoid damage.

**Can I use my green cup for both hot and cold beverages, and will it affect the taste?**
Yes, most high-quality green cups made from stainless steel or borosilicate glass are suitable for both hot and cold beverages. These materials are non-reactive and do not impart any taste or odor to the drinks. Plastic cups *may* absorb flavors over time, especially with acidic beverages, so consider the material when choosing a cup for versatile use. Always follow the manufacturer‚Äôs guidelines regarding temperature limits.

**What are the main differences between stainless steel, glass, and plastic green cups?**
Stainless steel cups are known for their durability, temperature retention, and resistance to corrosion. Glass cups offer a pure taste without any chemical leaching and are aesthetically pleasing but can be more fragile. Plastic cups (particularly plant-based options) are lightweight and often more affordable, but they may not retain temperature as well and could be susceptible to staining or absorbing flavors. Each material has its pros and cons.

1mdqk2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/orengeflame/comments/1mdqk2k/dimensional_watch_dxd_chapter_17_school_days/,Dimensional Watch DXD Chapter 17 School Days,"The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over Kuoh‚Äôs quiet streets. The air was filled with the scent of morning dew. Birds chirped cheerfully in the trees, and a gentle breeze rustled the leaves, promising a peaceful start to the day.

Inside the Hyoudou household, the scent of breakfast filled the air‚Äîfreshly cooked eggs, sizzling bacon, and the comforting aroma of miso soup. The kitchen was already lively, with Tamamo humming a tune while flipping pancakes and Yuuka stirring coffee, handing cups to Miki and Garou. Misuki, ever the caretaker, placed a plate in front of Sakura, who sleepily rubbed her eyes before starting to eat.

Issei, still groggy with sleep, trudged downstairs in an half-conscious state. His hair was a mess, his shirt was wrinkled, and his mind was only focused on one goal‚Äîbreakfast.

Everything was calm.

And then‚Äî

Knock! Knock!

Miki Hyoudou, already up and cheerful, hummed as she walked over to the door. The moment she opened it, she found their next-door neighbor, a spry old man in his seventies with slicked-back silver hair and the air of a retired troublemaker, stood with his hands on his hips, radiating absolute confidence. His wrinkled face stretched into a grin as his sharp eyes zeroed in on Issei, who had just stumbled down the stairs and into the doorway, still half-asleep.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt know you had it in you, kid.‚Äù He smirked, voice filled with admiration. ‚ÄúRespect.‚Äù

Issei froze mid-step, his brain grinding to a halt. His sleepy brain lagged. Processing‚Ä¶ Processing‚Ä¶ ""...What?!""

Tamamo, delicately sipping her tea at the table, giggled behind her sleeve. ‚ÄúUfufu\~! Word travels fast, doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù She says as she recalled how loud their conversation had been yesterday night. The neighbors must have heard everything.

Yuuka, who was helping in serving breakfast, gave a plate to Garou, who was reading the newspaper. She raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWhat exactly is he talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone must have been eavesdropping when we came to Issei‚Äôs home.‚Äù Misuki says as she sets another plate for Sakura to eat.

Miki leaned against the door, grinning. ""I told you our neighborhood was close.""

Issei‚Äôs stomach dropped.

Tanaka let out a hearty chuckle, clearly enjoying the clueless expression on Issei‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúOh, you know! The whole neighborhood knows! Three women? No, wait, was it four? And a kid already?! Damn, we all thought you were just some scrawny pervert, but turns out you‚Äôre a legend!‚Äù

Issei made a strangled noise, his entire soul leaving his body. ‚ÄúWho told you that?!‚Äù

But Tanaka was already walking away, whistling to himself as if he hadn‚Äôt just detonated a nuclear bomb in Issei‚Äôs morning.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

By the time Issei left the house, alone, heading to school, the rumors had already spread like wildfire.

And unfortunately for him‚Äî

People talked. Loudly.

Issei barely stepped onto the sidewalk when he overheard a group of elderly ladies, gathered outside Mrs. Sasaki‚Äôs house, were in deep discussion, their whispers only barely below shouting level.

‚ÄúDid you hear? The Hyoudou boy brought home four women!‚Äù

""I heard one of them called herself his wife!""

""And another one already gave him a daughter!""

""Miki was yelling about grandkids!""

Issei tripped over his own feet.

*‚ÄòThey think Sakura is my actual daughter?!‚Äô*

As Issei walked further down the street toward school, the whispers spread like wildfire.

And, just like a game of telephone, the story mutated every time he passed another group gossiping.

""You don‚Äôt think he‚Ä¶ kidnapped them, do you?""

""Oh, please! With a plain face like that? He must be LOADED!""

""I bet he‚Äôs a secret billionaire!""

Issei groaned, dragging his hands down his face. *‚ÄòWhy am I suddenly rich in this version of events?!‚Äô*

It got worse.

By the time he reached the school gates, the rumors had become urban legend material.

""I heard Issei Hyoudou is actually a genius who built his fortune in secret!""

""No, no! I heard he‚Äôs an underground crime lord! He finally settled down with his many brides after conquering the underworld!""

""Are you kidding?! He‚Äôs obviously royalty! You don‚Äôt just find four beautiful women and a kid overnight!""

""I heard his wives are ex-assassins that he defeated in combat!""

Issei came to a dead stop at the school entrance.

*'WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL IS HAPPENING?!'*

Before he could even react, the school‚Äôs biggest troublemakers rushed up to him.

‚ÄúIssei! You Bastard!‚Äù

Suddenly, two human missiles slammed into him from both sides. He staggered backward, barely managing to stay on his feet, as his so-called best friends, Matsuda and Motohama, latched onto him like rabid dogs.

Matsuda had tears of frustration in his eyes as he violently shook Issei by the shoulders, his grip filled with betrayal. ‚ÄúHow?! Why?! When?!‚Äù He wailed. ‚ÄúYou have a wife?!‚Äù

Motohama, adjusting his glasses with a dramatic shine, was practically vibrating with energy. ‚ÄúAnd an adorable daughter?!‚Äù

Issei‚Äôs head flopped back and forth like a ragdoll. ‚ÄúGAH‚ÄîLet go of me!‚Äù

‚ÄúNever!‚Äù Matsuda howled. ‚ÄúNot until you tell us everything!‚Äù

‚ÄúI aint telling you shit!‚Äù

Before Issei could even deny it, a new voice sliced through the chaos like a sharp blade..

‚ÄúIssei Hyoudou‚Äù

Aika Kiryuu, the perverted female version of him and his friends, had arrived. Her smirk was dangerous. Her smirk was dangerous. Her eyes gleamed like a predator that had just found its prey. She stepped closer, her movements slow and deliberate, letting the moment sink in.

‚ÄúSecret billionaire, criminal mastermind, harem king, and father?‚Äù She stepped closer, eyes sharp. ‚ÄúHow exactly did you pull that off?‚Äù

Issei opened his mouth‚Äî but nothing came out. He was lost in what to say. He simply left for class. With the three following him.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

**Kuoh Academy, Classroom**

By the time Issei stepped into class, he was already mentally exhausted.

He had barely survived the absolute circus of insane rumors outside. Now, all he wanted was to sit down, pretend none of this was happening, and somehow get through the day in peace.

Too bad peace didn‚Äôt exist in his life anymore.

Because the moment he walked through the door‚Äî

Silence.

A suffocating, unnatural silence engulfed the entire room.

It wasn‚Äôt the kind of comfortable silence one experienced in a sleepy morning class. No.

This was the kind of ominous, horror-movie silence that preceded something terrible.

Dozens of female eyes snapped onto him, their collective stares boring into his soul. The sheer intensity of their curiosity was so oppressive, it felt like he had just walked onto a battlefield unarmed.

Slowly, stiffly, Issei shuffled to his desk and sat down.

The silence remained.

He gulped. *‚ÄòOkay. Maybe if I don‚Äôt say anything, they‚Äôll just‚Äî‚Äô*

Whisper. Whisper.

From the far side of the room, a girl leaned toward her friend, her voice barely hushed.

‚ÄúI heard he married a princess from overseas!‚Äù

Another student immediately added, ‚ÄúI heard he‚Äôs secretly part of the Yakuza!‚Äù

Issei twitched. ‚ÄòWhere are people even getting this?! I was only gone yesterday!‚Äô

His fingers drummed against the desk as more whispers began creeping into his ears. His patience frayed.

More voices joined in.

‚ÄúI heard his wives are all former assassins!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no! He‚Äôs actually royalty‚Äîhe was in hiding, but now his true identity is coming out!‚Äù

‚ÄúI refuse to believe that pervert is royalty.!‚Äù

Issei let out a long, suffering groan and slammed his forehead onto the desk.

‚ÄòThis is getting out of control.‚Äô

And then‚Äî

BANG!

The classroom door slides open.

Students flinched in their seats, some yelping in surprise.

And then‚Äî

She stepped in.

A short figure, clad in the Kuoh Academy uniform, strode into the room with graceful precision. Her movements were controlled, calculated, and filled with silent authority.

Her sharp violet eyes locked onto him, glinting behind the faint reflection of her rectangular glasses.

Sona Sitri.

The Student Council President.

Issei froze.

Oh no.

She adjusted her glasses, standing at the front of the class with the presence of a queen addressing her subjects.

Issei barely managed to keep a straight face as Sona Sitri‚Äôs piercing gaze bore into him like a predator eyeing its next meal.

The entire classroom was silent, the weight of every student's curiosity pressing down on him.

""Hyoudou,"" Sona said again, her voice calm but firm. ""We need to talk.""

Issei gulped, knowing there was no escape. ""Uh‚Ä¶ s-sure, Kaichou.""

Sona gestured toward the hallway, and he hesitantly followed, fully aware of the countless eyes burning holes into his back.

The moment the door shut behind them‚Äî

The classroom exploded with whispers.

""...Is he getting arrested?""

Someone gasped. ‚ÄúThe yakuza rumors were true?!‚Äù

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The moment they were alone, Sona turned to him, arms crossed, her gaze unwavering.

""Would you care to explain?"" she began, adjusting her glasses. ""Why is the entire school suddenly buzzing with rumors about you?""

Issei let out a nervous chuckle. ""Uh‚Ä¶ define buzzing?""

Sona narrowed her eyes.

""Secret billionaire. Crime lord. Royalty. Assassin harem master.""

Her deadpan tone combined with her utterly unamused stare made Issei want to crawl into a hole.

He groaned, dragging a hand down his face. *‚ÄòOh my God, it‚Äôs even worse than I thought.‚Äô*

Sherri‚Äôs voice chimed in through his mind, her tone dry and unimpressed. ***‚ÄòMaster, I do believe you've set a new record for most absurd rumors in a single morning.‚Äô***

*‚ÄòNot helping, Sherri.‚Äô*¬†He muttered internally.

Sona let out a sigh, rubbing her temple. ""I eventually expected ridiculous rumors involving you, but this is excessive. What exactly is going on?""

Issei scrambled for an answer, his brain working overtime.

Then‚Äî

***‚ÄòMaster, I can provide a solution.‚Äô***

Issei barely resisted the urge to sigh in relief. He subtly adjusted his wrist, pretending to scratch it as he listened.

***‚ÄòTell her that a family is currently staying at your house due to unfortunate circumstances. This will explain the presence of multiple women without raising supernatural suspicion.‚Äô***

*‚ÄòGood thinking, Sherri!‚Äô*

""Ah, about that‚Ä¶"" Issei rubbed the back of his head sheepishly. ""It‚Äôs really just a big misunderstanding.""

Sona arched an eyebrow. ""Go on.""

""Yeah, um‚Ä¶"" He forced out an awkward laugh. ""A family is staying at our house because of, uh, some misfortune they ran into.""

Sona's eyes narrowed slightly, but she seemed intrigued rather than outright suspicious. ""A family?""

Issei nodded quickly. ""Yeah! They‚Äôre kind of‚Ä¶ in a tough spot right now, so my parents let them stay with us. And, well‚Ä¶ people kinda blew it out of proportion.""

Sona studied him closely, as if trying to detect any deception in his words.

Then, after a long moment, she nodded.

""I see."" She adjusted her glasses. ""Then that would mean the rumors of you suddenly being married, adopting a child, or running an underground criminal empire are all‚Äî?""

""Completely false!"" Issei cut in before she could even finish.

Sona stared at him for a long moment.

Then‚Äî

She sighed and relaxed slightly. ""Very well.""

*‚ÄòWait, really? That worked?!‚Äô*

But Sona wasn‚Äôt finished. ""Then allow me to ask something else while we‚Äôre here.""

""Huh?""

Sona‚Äôs sharp gaze locked onto him once again. ""You mentioned this family. I assume one of them is school-aged, and I've been informed that there's a request for a transfer student‚Äîone Yuuka Hana, to enroll at Kuoh Academy for her final year. Is she supposedly linked to you?""

Issei blinked. ""Wait. You mean Yuuka?""

Sona nodded. ""I'm assuming this is related to the family staying with you?""

*‚ÄòDamn. She‚Äôs sharp as always. Oh, this is my chance!‚Äô*

""Yeah! Actually, the girl staying with us needs to finish her final years of high school.""

Sona studied him again, then nodded. ""That‚Äôs not an unreasonable request. If she has the necessary identification, I'll have Saji handle the paperwork. Expect a formal meeting later to go over the details.""

Issei let out a huge sigh of relief.

*‚ÄòHoly crap, I managed to fix something for once!‚Äô*

Sona adjusted her glasses. ""Just‚Ä¶ try to avoid any more ridiculous rumors, Hyoudou.""

""...Yeah, I can‚Äôt promise that.""

She gave him an unimpressed look before walking off.

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

As Issei stepped back into the classroom, the entire room fell silent.

Dozens of female students turned to look at him, their wide, expectant eyes locked onto his every movement.

It was the kind of stare one might give a man walking into his own execution.

His movements felt unnaturally slow as he shuffled toward his desk, each step heavy with dread.

He barely slumped into his chair before‚Äî

""Did you get arrested?!""

Issei nearly fell out of his seat. ""WHAT?! NO!""

But it was too late.

Like a dam breaking, the classroom erupted into chaos.

""What did she say?! Are you getting expelled?!""

""Is she secretly your fianc√©e?!""

""Wait, wait‚Äîwas it about the Yakuza thing?!""

Issei slammed his forehead onto the desk, his patience obliterated.

*‚ÄòKill me. Just kill me now.‚Äô*

Sona had barely interrogated him for five minutes, and yet somehow, the school had already built an entire conspiracy web.

Thankfully, the lesson finally started, forcing everyone to calm down. The whispers gradually faded as the teachers took control, and for the first time since waking up, Issei had something resembling peace.

The morning lessons passed in a blur.

Issei barely paid attention, his body exhausted from the relentless rumors and insane speculation. But despite everything, a small victory lifted his mood.

He had managed to get Yuuka‚Äôs transfer started.

*‚ÄòFinally! Something that actually went well today!‚Äô*

He sighed in relief, stretching slightly as lunch break arrived.

As he pulled out his bento, a rare, content smile crossed his face.

*‚ÄòAt least I can relax and eat now.‚Äô*

But the moment he opened it‚Äî

A heavenly aroma of expertly crafted, restaurant-tier food wafted into the air.

For a single, fleeting second, Issei was too distracted by the sheer beauty of the meal before him to notice the looming danger.

""What is this?!""

A pair of hands slammed down onto his shoulders, shaking him violently.

Matsuda and Motohama had pounced.

Matsuda‚Äôs eyes were wide, trembling with emotion. ""This is not your usual food, Issei!""

Motohama, adjusting his glasses with a suspicious glint, leaned in. ""This aroma‚Ä¶ this presentation‚Ä¶ this level of craftsmanship‚Ä¶""

His voice dropped into a dramatic whisper. ""You didn‚Äôt make this, did you?""

Issei tried to shove them away. ""Back off, it‚Äôs just my lunch!""

But they were already inspecting the bento like detectives examining a crime scene.

The rice was shaped into tiny hearts.

The tamagoyaki had ""For My Darling\~"" written in sauce.

A small note was tucked into the side. ‚ÄòEat well, my beloved\~! Ufufu\~! ‚ÄìMizukame.‚Äô

A long pause.

Then‚Äî

Matsuda screamed.

""You‚Äôre actually dating someone!!!""

The entire classroom turned to look.

Hundreds of heads snapped toward them like owls spotting prey.

The noise level spiked instantly.

And then‚Äî

Aika Kiryuu appeared.

Like a devil summoned by sheer chaos, she materialized beside them, her grin positively wicked.

""Ooooh\~?"" Aika purred, eyes glinting mischievously. ""Who‚Äôs this? Mizukame, huh?""

Issei‚Äôs soul left his body.

He slammed the lid shut. ""NO ONE!""

Motohama glared at him. ""It‚Äôs literally written in sauce.""

Matsuda grabbed him again, shaking him harder. ""You have a girlfriend?! You?! How?!""

Issei wanted to die.

But it was too late.

His classmates exploded.

""The pervert actually has a girlfriend?!""

""How did that pervert pull that off?!""

""He must be blackmailing her.""

Issei‚Äôs eye twitched violently.

""I am not blackmailing anyone!""

Aika giggled, looking way too entertained. ""Oh, Issei, you're never living this down\~!""

And with that‚Äî

The harem rumors continue to grow.

The sun hung low in the sky over Kuoh Academy. The once lively school was now winding down, with students either heading home or staying behind for club activities.

For Issei, the day had been long.

Painfully long.

His mind still reeled from the absurd events of the day‚Äîthe wild rumors, Sona‚Äôs interrogation, and the lunchroom disaster that had officially labeled him as ""the pervert who somehow has a girlfriend.""

*‚ÄòI just want to go home and see some boobs.‚Äô*¬†He was sure that Tamamo or Yuuka would let him hug them and allow their boobs his mental stress.

He had almost made it.

He was steps away from the school gate, freedom within reach.

And then‚Äî

""Issei!""

His stomach dropped.

Before he could react, a pair of arms slung around his shoulders.

Matsuda and Motohama. His so-called best friends.

The duo flanked him on either side, grinning like maniacs.

Matsuda wiggled his eyebrows. ""Brooo\~! You seem like you're in a hurry! Going home to your special someone, hmm?""

Motohama adjusted his glasses, the lenses gleaming dangerously. ""Or maybe‚Ä¶ you're heading home early so you can finally get rid of your V-Card?""

Issei choked on air.

""What?! No! That‚Äôs not‚Äî!""

Matsuda ignored him and wrapped an arm around his shoulder. ""C‚Äômon, man. Before you go back to your new and improved ‚Äògirlfriend-having‚Äô life, how about we do something fun?""

Issei narrowed his eyes. ""‚Ä¶Fun how?""

Matsuda and Motohama exchanged devious grins.

""You see,"" Matsuda said, ""the Kendo Club is practicing right now‚Ä¶""

Motohama smirked. ""And we were thinking of doing a little ‚Äòextracurricular viewing session.‚Äô""

Issei‚Äôs eye twitched.

They wanted to peep again.

Of course they did.

Issei hesitated.

It was tradition, after all. The three of them had attempted to spy on the Kendo Club multiple times, though they usually got their asses handed to them by the female members.

*‚ÄòOn one hand‚Ä¶ Kendo girls‚Ä¶‚Äô*

But then‚Äî

He thought about the people waiting for him at home.

Yuuka, Misuki, Tamamo‚Ä¶ and of course Sakura. And then there was Ddraig. The dragon had made him promise to start training. He had already delayed it long enough.

*‚ÄòI gotta start taking things seriously‚Ä¶‚Äô*¬†As memories of distress about not being able to fight back and punch that blond bastard or the beat down from the shitty priest. Never again.

Issei sighed, shaking his head. ""Sorry, guys. Can‚Äôt. Got things to do.""

Silence.

Matsuda and Motohama froze, their expressions twisting into sheer horror.

Matsuda grabbed his shoulders. ""You‚Äôre turning down peeping?! Who even are you?! What have they done to you?!""

Motohama gasped. ""Oh my god. You‚Äôre whipped.""

Issei twitched. ""I AM NOT WHIPPED!""

Matsuda dramatically recoiled. ""He‚Äôs in denial. Classic signs of a man in chains!""

Motohama shook his head. ""It‚Äôs over, man. He‚Äôs gone. Our brother is truly, irreversibly‚Ä¶ domesticated.""

Issei gritted his teeth.

""I'm not domesticated! I just have actual priorities!""

Matsuda sniffled. ""Listen to him‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs responsible now. So tragic‚Ä¶""

Motohama patted his back. ""Rest in peace, Issei Hyoudou. Gone, but not forgotten.""

""WHATEVER!"" Issei threw their arms off and marched off toward the school gate, ignoring the whispers behind him.

""Yup. Definitely whipped.""

""Domesticated as hell.""

""Think he already calls her ‚Äòhoney‚Äô?""

""SHUT UP!""

As he stormed away, he could hear their snickers.

But he didn‚Äôt care.

He had escaped.

Now, all that was left was home.

By the time Issei reached his neighborhood, he felt like he had barely escaped with his life.

Between the rumors, the interrogation, the lunchroom fiasco, and his idiot friends declaring him ‚Äòdomesticated,‚Äô he was mentally fried.

*‚ÄòAt least now I can finally‚Äî‚Äô*

The moment he opened the front door and he froze.

Because kneeling in the entryway, clad in aprons over their completely bare bodies, were‚Äî Yuuka and Tamamo.

Both smiling.

Both looking way too smug.

And then‚Äî

""Welcome home, Darling\~!""

Issei‚Äôs soul momentarily left his body. His brain blue-screened. His sanity screamed. His nosebleed confirmed his demise.

Yuuka‚Äôs voice was sweet and playful, but the mischievous glint in her eyes made his stomach drop.

Tamamo, of course, beamed.

""Would you like dinner, a bath‚Ä¶""

They both leaned in. Eyes glinting. Voices sultry.

""Or us?""

Issei‚Äôs face exploded red as blood spurted from his nose. ""‚ÄîHUH?!""

Tamamo giggled behind her hand. ""Ara, ara\~! My dear husband is so flustered! Could it be‚Ä¶ he actually wants to choose us?""

Yuuka smirked. ""C‚Äômon, Issei-kun\~! You‚Äôre always talking about stuff like this at school. What‚Äôs the matter? Can‚Äôt handle it?""

Issei backed up immediately, waving his hands frantically.

""W-WHAT?! WHY ARE YOU EVEN SAYING THIS?!""

Tamamo tilted her head.

""Because it‚Äôs fun\~!""

Yuuka laughed. ""Your reactions are priceless.""

At that moment‚Äî

Misuki walked in from the living room, casually carrying a cup of tea. She took one look at the scene in front of her, arched an eyebrow, and sighed.

""Really, you two?"" she said, taking a slow sip of her tea. ""At least let him take his shoes off first.""

""We‚Äôre just doing what our mother-in-law told us to do.""

Tamamo‚Äôs cheerful response made Issei choke on his own spit.

""SHE WHAT?!""

A small voice. From behind the couch.

Sakura, peeking out innocently, blinked. ""‚Ä¶Papa is red.""

Yuuka grinned. ""Yup! His perverted brain, probably short-circuited!""

Issei sputtered. ""My brain did not‚Äî!!""

Before he could finish, Tamamo hugged him.

Tightly.

His face was immediately buried into her chest.

Warm. Soft. Heaven.

Tamamo gently stroked his hair. ""There, there, my darling\~!"" she cooed, pressing him even closer. ""Don‚Äôt worry! I‚Äôll always be here to pamper you\~!""

Yuuka rolled her eyes. ""Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Just hurry up and get inside before the neighbors see us and the rumors get worse.""

As Tamamo continued hugging him, her warmth melting his stress away, Issei couldn‚Äôt help but smile.

A perverted, satisfied smile. *‚ÄòI love my life.‚Äô*",1,1753931098.0,orengeflame,0,1.0,False

1mdqjm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/interracialdating/comments/1mdqjm2/anyone_here_know_if_a_polish_woman_could_get/,Anyone here know if a Polish Woman could get along with a Mexican American?,"  I am 46, male, clean cut type, no tattoos, college grad, non smoking, no drugs, only social drinker. Catholicism is important in my life, but I can't always be at church every weekend. 
  Last week I visited a Polish Catholic Church, not to attend Mass because I only know Spanish and English. I visited to sample Polish food, but I got there a little early and had to be somewhere else later. I just had PoIish pastries, coffee and left. I was the only tan looking person there, but did not feel out of place. People did look at me, but not in a negative way (when it is in a negative way, you can feel it). People were polite, welcoming, and receptive. The woman selling the food, even suggested that I go back again at a later date, she said they were going to be changing menus soon. I also noticed the place was kept very neat, clean, and organized. The women around there were also not bad looking.
  Later that day, I decided to look up a Polish restaurant because I was curious about Polish food. So I drove 1 hour away from home just to go to a Polish restaurant. Again, I was the only tan person in there, but no one made me feel uncomfortable. It was the complete opposite. One man with his family asked me where I was from, etc. and so on. When I was leaving, he asked me if I liked it, I said of course. He thanked me for visiting and said that he hoped I would go there again. Key takeaway : Poles were very nice, and welcoming. They did speak English with a little bit of an accent, so they are not Poles born here in the US. Is it part of the culture to be very welcoming to people that look different than them. I myself don't look White, but don't look like Pancho Villa either. More like 60% of the actor Mario Lopez, in that range. If Poles are generally receptive and warm, I am thinking that is a start, right? They are allowing me to prove I am a productive member of society and a practicing Catholic, like many of them are. Then the rest is probably up to me, right, to make friends at least with the guys to see if they know single women, right?

Let's talk about a small thing that is relevant to my life.

There are cafe/bakery who use instant coffee like Nescafe to serve coffee and charge Rs.150/cup. When I said this to my very intelligent mate, he said ""Free market brooo, if you think it should cost lesser, go and start a new coffee shop"". It was disappointing to hear that from him. Because not everybody can go and open a bakery shop. And my another smart mate told me, ""Go to other shops, not to that one who's charging 150"". I went to  other coffee shops that were still charging Rs.100/cup of instant coffee. It seemed like they had no idea that there are coffee beans and even the coffee made by machine costs Rs.180/cup for cappucino. 

I've experienced such kind of syndicate in Kathmandu valley, pretty often.


Again, take another example. Study room. Study rooms doesn't mean an entire dedicated room for 1 person. It means just one cubicle and yo stay in a same room with 40 other people. You're provided a charging socket, electricity per cubicle. And the room is open from 6am-10pm. It costs Rs.3000/month if paid monthly, Rs.200/day. On top of that, they also charge Rs.1000 for admission (Seriously! What's its purpose besides trying to force you keep coming to that study room forever). When I told this to my friendly Indian friends, they told that I was paying too much. And in India, these facilities are available at Rs.1000(starting with 500BHARU), that too with AC. Even in Indian metro cities, cubicles don't amount to Neru.3000

Now, when I told this to my gifted friend, he told me ""Najane tirna nasake, ghar mai basera padne"". I was really hurt. Not everyone has a study environment at home. Specially if it's their home, then relatives keep coming and there is always disturbance.

Someone said  ""library jane public, tei gayera padne"". But the concern is public libraries are a mere formality in Nepal. They contain very less seats for students and open in office hours only. Democratic government has never thought of investing into libraries. 

I am deeply concerned about the situation. And I want to learn how to make my voice heard?",2,1753931054.0,NepalSocial,3,1.0,False

Price wise--3 bags of coffee--each whole beans 12 ounce weight and the Phin for $65 . I hadn't read the beans close enough. I wanted to strictly try Robusta as I felt it was the only way to truly make Vietnamese coffee.

Only one bag is Robusta which is where I wanted to go (their Hanoi--$16 on their site--bit more on Amazon $20).   The second bag is their Saigon (which is blended Robusta and Arabica beans at $16 on their website--$19 on Amazon. The third bag is their Dalat at $18 --which is 100% arabica--$19 on Amazon.  Price wise I felt happy $50 for 3 bags of coffee. $15 for the Phin--buying from Nguyen. Amazon wise it would have been $58 for the coffee and $21 for the phin (total of $79) so I saved $14

I'm confused though----I thought to have ""authentic Vietnamese Coffee I should be strictly drinking Robusta.

1 lb Italian sausage.   (I like hot, but mild works fine.)

1 large can finely diced tomatoes.   
1 bag egg noodles (any pasta works, this feels right)
Handful of fresh chopped basil
2  cloves finely chopped garlic
1 container of feta cheese. Crumbled. 8 Oz?
Several bottles of red wine.  Cab.  I tried it with a zin and it was too sweet.  Get something you will both enjoy.


Call a friend you want to seduce.  Brush your teeth and wash your face again.  

Fry up 1 lb of Italian sausage, without casing.  Crumble the hell out of it.  

Drink some red wine.  Are they here yet?

When the sausage is browned throw in the garlic and stir for one minute, then add the tomatoes (juice from the can is fine, if you chopped them yourself you are a better person than I am, but add 1/4 cup of water to help deglaze)

Offer your guest a glass of wine.  Tell them they look nice, and wouldn't they be more comfortable taking off their shoes?  

When the tomatoes and sausage are happily simmering pour in 1/2 cup of red wine.  Stir.  Continue to simmer,  you want those tomatoes to cook.  Probably 15 minuted or so.  Put the water for the pasta on.  Add salt.  It doesn't make the water boil faster, but it makes the food taste better.

Sit down with your friend and offer them more wine.  That coat is beautiful,  right?  But they wouldn't want it to get stained.  Red wine.  Hang it on a hanger, don't throw it on the back of a chair.  Tell them again how nice they look, and sit closer this time.  Put your arm around them, look them in the eyes and encourage them to talk about themselves.  Don't talk about your job, tonight is about them.

Water is boiling,  add the pasta.  Check the sauce.  How is the reduction going?  Too thin, raise the heat.  Too thick add some more wine.  It should be close (fish out a tomato bit on a spoon and ask your guest to try it.  It shouldn't be too firm.  Mushy but still a tomato bit is good, the sausage adds texture.  Watch them chew.  Smile.

OK, veggies and bread (garlic bread is good, but tonight is about love) are good.  I know you remembered dessert.   You can eat that with coffee later.

Drain the pasta, pour it into a bowl.  Pour the sauce over the top.  I know, sounds crazy but it lets your guest got as much or as little sauce/pasta as they want.  Their happiness is what's important.   Sprinkle the feta cheese and chopped fresh bssil on top.

I tried low-acid beans, cold brew, even mushroom coffee... but nothing worked consistently.

Then I learned that the key isn‚Äôt just the type of coffee‚Äîit‚Äôs **how your body buffers the acid load** that comes with it.

# Why Coffee Is Acidic

Coffee contains a mix of **chlorogenic acids**, **quinic acid**, and other organic compounds that lower the pH of the beverage and contribute to **gastric irritation**, especially in people dealing with:

* GERD / acid reflux
* Gastritis or LPR
* Dietary acidosis
* Kidney stress

The solution isn‚Äôt necessarily giving up coffee. It‚Äôs about **buffering the acidity** both **in the cup** and **in your body**.

# What Alklyte Does Differently

**Alklyte** is a precise blend of specific molar ratios of **bicarbonates (sodium/potassium) and citrates (potassium/sodium).  The mix is precisely designed to support a healthy acid-base pH balance.\***

These compounds are the **exact same types of buffers your body naturally produces** to stabilize pH and neutralize acids. When added to coffee (or taken with water before/after drinking), Alklyte:

* **Neutralizes the free hydrogen ions** (acid) in the coffee directly
* **Provides systemic buffering support** that reduces the total dietary acid load
* Helps protect the **gut lining** and **kidneys** from chronic acid stress

It‚Äôs not just about raising the pH of the coffee itself‚Äîit‚Äôs about improving the way your **entire body handles acidity** after consumption.

# Real-World Impact

Since using Alklyte, I‚Äôve gone back to enjoying coffee without fear of flare-ups. I don‚Äôt rely on PPIs or chalky antacids anymore. Just a scoop of Alklyte stirred into my morning coffee or taken in a glass of water beforehand has made all the difference.

And the science backs this up. **Citrate and bicarbonate salts** have been shown to:

* Reduce symptoms of **GERD and reflux**
* Improve **acid-base balance** possibly helping those with chronic kidney disease (ask your doctor first before using if you have CKD because it contains some potassium)
* Support **gut barrier function** and microbial balance
* Help reduce **dietary acidosis** linked to fatigue, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction (see recent posts in this group for peer-reviewed studies)

# Takeaway

You don‚Äôt have to give up coffee to feel good‚Äîyou just need a better buffering strategy. For me, that‚Äôs **Alklyte**.

Let‚Äôs talk:

* Have you tried alkalizing your coffee?
* What buffers or supplements have helped you?

Maybe my noob is really showing here - but If ANC capabilities could fall similarly in line to QC ultra like I had mentioned I have no issue with being limited to a wire and not being wireless. Busy coffee shop/airplane use are the main settings, though. 

All in all if something was similar in sound quality but more premium materials and comfortable to wear the latter criteria would be much more important to me. I say this because everything at the high-end will probably sound amazing to me considering I'm not an audiophile (yet). I know I would be really annoyed if something felt like it could never get loud enough I like to crank my shit.

I'm also curious what people are excited for that is releasing in a year or so. Thank you everyone",1,1753930387.0,HeadphoneAdvice,2,1.0,False

I know I probably have CPTSD and not ADHD. I know it‚Äôs summer and I‚Äôm working out a lot (outside) and taking lots of supplements to support a neurodivergent brain. 

I quit taking my Jornay PM and Ritalin booster when I came down with shingles last Tuesday because the antiviral med puts my nervous system into fight-or-flight and I knew not to mix the two (have had shingles flares 4 times now, getting the vaccine asap.) 

I used to drink more than 2L of soda or coffee a day to have a functional brain. 

I‚Äôm perimenopausal, my brain should be spiraling into a life paralleled to a soggy curly French fry. 

Yet the clarity, energy, and drive‚Ä¶ I feel 18 again, without the crushing anxiety. 

WHY

Why did it take this long? The last 15 years of my life have been so awful, I literally lost everything except my family. 

Where was this brain back then? 

No more antidepressants, no more stimulants, no more restless leg meds. 

Maybe all I needed was strong birth control (using it as HRT.) 

I‚Äôm so thankful, but lost so much $$ to the housing market crash of 2008, COVID killed our business, and ADHD tax‚Ä¶ we will never recover financially, but at least I‚Äôm in the best shape of my life.

This has been both the slowest and fastest year of my life. The last 12 months have been a roller coaster, from shock and feeling physically ill for weeks, to blaming myself for his death and going over and over in my head what I could have done differently (he died suddenly and unexpectedly at the vet), to a gradual acceptance that he is gone, to being able to enjoy my life again. I don't even know who I was over the last year, but I wasn't myself. I still can't adopt another cat. I still miss him terribly. I used to start each day with him on the balcony, drinking my coffee while he was in his catio, and we would watch birds and squirrels together. Every night before I went to bed we would play and he would run around my apartment diving in and out of his play tunnel. He had a whole toy bucket next to his cat condo and I would put his toys away every night and he would come to bed with me. He was the beginning and the end of my day. I miss our little rituals even now. I have had a couple of fosters, but can't adopt again. It is like there is a hole in my heart that can't be filled. I can feel happiness now (I couldn't for months) and I can enjoy my life, but there is always something missing. I'm not even sure where I'm going with this post. I just want everyone to know that there is light at the end of the tunnel, but also you're different when you come out the other side. Rest in peace Babka.

1mdq6y4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mdq6y4,Don‚Äôt leave your balls in your car (also wear your seatbelt),"I drive (drove) a CX-5 and was headed to a 10am appointment 30 mins away. I made it 5 miles up the road. Ran into unexpected torrential rain and I tried to get slowed down but the highway curved and I hydroplaned, like I‚Äôd hit a sheet of ice. Never did regain control. Went off the highway at prob 55 mph, bounced off an embankment, traveled around 100 yards while rolling at least twice, and landed on the roof in a ditch, held up by my seatbelt. I never lost consciousness, never felt a hit to my head. I unbuckled and panicked trying to find the door handle and then panicked again when I realized I couldn‚Äôt push the doors open. I was wedged in a ditch & something was smoking. 

Everything was everywhere, and covered in my fresh coffee. I realize Siri was calling 911 for me. Then 2 dudes in a truck pulled up and when I heard them yelling if anyone was in there it could have been Jesus himself. They manhandled my car door and pried it open & got me out.

I walked away. I have nasty airbag burns but I am otherwise fine. Car is totaled, obviously. 

It wasn‚Äôt until I got to the tow lot and looked at my car that I remembered I still had my bowling bags in my cargo area from last night. Unrestrained, only partially blocked by the backseat. And when I opened the back door, I realized they‚Äôd both ejected from the cargo area. Once the car was flipped back onto the tires, my unpadded 47 pound 3 ball roller bag was found wedged against the back of my drivers seat. My spare ball backpack had ended up in the back passenger seat. It‚Äôs beyond me how one of them didn‚Äôt fly into my compartment like a deadly missile and kill me.

Looking at the car & realizing I don‚Äôt have even so much as a piece of glass wedged in me was surreal. All the broken glass I could have landed on when I unbuckled, or could have unknowingly stepped on or touched when looking for my phone, and I have not a single cut.

Tried a lot of antihistamines and H1, H2 blockers. Now only 1 in the morning and 2 antihistamines before bed. They sometimes work well sometimes don't.  
About 2 months ago I started autologous blood desensitization, the process of using a one's own blood to help reduce or eliminate allergic or immune reactions. Each time they draw 5cc of blood and reject into your body. I've been on this treatment for 2.5 months. Actuaclly I did see improvement. I use UAS7 tracker and see a significant drop in the score. Currently I have less than 20 hives, and they do itch but not to extent that I can't bear. I don't scratch them. but they still come daily, mostly when I wake up and before bed. It's been 5 fucking moths.  
What's making me really upset is that this dermatogolist always asks me about my diet. My IgE is only 23, and never have food allergies. I eat clean and avoid seafood/nuts/dairy/fermented food/any high-histamine foods. I don't eat any fruits/snacks, even quit coffee and tea with caffeine! Every time he asks me what I eat, I feel I'm questioned. It's like telling me I'm not going far enough or my diet must have been the cause.  
The previous dermatologist told me CSU isn't diet-related, as long as I avoid major no-nos, which I did!  
Blood tests showed no abnormalities, thyroid checked, potential autoimmune diseases ruled out.  
I tried cyclosporine before for only 2 weeks, then I switched to this dermatologist for the autologous blood desensitization. Should I go back and try cyclosporine for longer? I can't afford Xolair. It's not covered by any insurance plans in my country (Taiwan). I understand my hives have become more bearable, I can work I can sleep, but occasionally they get worse, though not as severe as before. I really want my life 100% back. I don't want to always check the menu to make sure there's something I can eat when I go out with my husband. It's mentally exhausting. I'm paranoid as well, the first thing I do when I wake up is to check how many hives I have.

Last time I shared an unboxing pic, and some people asked me to share how it‚Äôs been after using it for a while. So, here‚Äôs a quick rundown of what I think, especially some aspects I saw people usually care about. 

\- Route planning: The x8 does great in planning its route when vacuuming and mopping. It automatically goes around my sofa, coffee table...I set up the map, and it follows the routes on it, it hasn‚Äôt gotten lost so far. I can also tell the app to clean specific areas and check cleaning history, its interface is straightforward. Basically, I set it up once and then just let it run on its own. 

\- Cleaning performance: It‚Äôs got a roller mop with a self cleaning feature, so the mop always stays clean while it's working. Honestly, it cleans the floor better than the old mop I used before. 

After using it for a couple of weeks, the floors at my place are cleaner, and I‚Äôm cleaning more often now. I used to mop once or twice a week, but now it runs almost every other day, and the whole place feels tidier. And honestly, it‚Äôs way easier than cleaning by myself. Of course, it‚Äôs still a machine, so you have to do regular maintenance like emptying the dustbin and cleaning the mop holder, which can make it live longer.
