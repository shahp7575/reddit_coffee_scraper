Indeed, in a patio retreat or perhaps a Backyard Kitchen with Pergola, the style, comfort, and versatility that these structures bring to the table are innumerable. Has it ever dawned on you how a simple structuring would change the outdoor scene? Pergolas creates careful design and functionality that complement each other. Customization possibilities are available in almost as many forms as there are uses. They're an ideal one-stop shop for anyone looking for better outdoor experiences.***

https://preview.redd.it/mim21jmfs3ee1.png?width=1160&format=png&auto=webp&s=78d2467e15384844b75e5371db5b77a19886c323

Have you ever wanted to beautify your outdoor area simply by not ablating it? Pergolas blend this elegant and practical state into a single adaptable structure for small patio areas and backyard kitchens. They are charming, but, one way or another, let space be filled with a sense of openness and comfort.

**Pergolas: The Ultimate Space-Saving Solution**

How do you enhance the possibilities of patio design problems? [**Pergolas for Small Patios**](https://jupiterpergola.com/pergolas-patio), on the other hand, is the answer. Their open-ended framework allows sunlight to filter through while providing shade, making the area feel more welcoming. Imagine drinking your first cup of coffee in a cove at the bottom of a cozy pergola or inviting friends to an intimate dinner. Pergolas convert every small patio into a multifunctional outdoor retreat. They serve as an extension of the space inside your living area, integrating both flows.

**The Allure of Backyard Kitchens with Pergolas**

A [**Backyard Kitchen with Pergola**](https://jupiterpergola.com/) is the dream for many, but have you ever considered having one? A pergola over your backyard kitchen will protect it from the sun while maintaining an open and airy feel. It is perfect for grilling, dining, or just spending time and hanging out. String lights or climbing plants can help turn your backyard kitchen into a scene from a movie.

**Personalizing Your Pergola**

Consider the versatility a pergola adds to your setup. It's not simply a shelter—an outright statement piece incorporated into the overall feel. A distinctive feature of a pergola is its adaptability, allowing you to customize it to match your style and needs. For smaller patios, you can elevate its functionality by adding sheer curtains for a touch of elegance or opting for a retractable design to enhance privacy and provide protection from the elements. Hanging planters or integrated lighting adds something unique to the cozy backyard kitchens. Wood, aluminum, or vinyl materials make choosing a pergola that matches your current aesthetic easier while withstanding the elements.

**Pergolas and Sustainability**

A good pergola can reduce energy costs by shading nearby windows or doors. To top it all off, it is an alternative to climbing plants, which create a naturally green, eco-friendly space. Pergolas advocates sustainable outdoor living by allowing natural ventilation and greatly lessening the energy needed to facilitate cooling. Those added elements may be solar lighting, which enhances the space by conserving the earth without compromising its effectiveness.",1,1737359065.0,u_jupiterpergolaus,0,1.0,False

I have a degree in journalism. I went to college at Loyola University Chicago. Never know how to fill these out because no one reads them. But, a collection of random things about me, I love cookies, I prefer walking over driving, I’m a shopaholic, and I have an apartment with no furniture besides a couch and bed.

I’m rarely home since I’m always traveling for work. I like to shop before leaving a state so I’m always left with new outfits. Cookies and a glass of milk is my favorite to end a meal on. I’m getting older so I prefer to walk then drive to get my steps in. Great for cardio as well. In 2024 I hiked the Oregon trail doing over 40k steps, went sky diving in Australia, got in a doom buggy in Saudi Arabia, fresh baguettes and coffee in France, Holocaust memorial in Berlin, and a photo shoot that was cherry themed.

In 2025 I’m hoping to travel more. Around Asia and Europe. Kyoto, Mount Fuji, Phucket, Seoul, Venice, Barcelona, and Istanbul are all places I’m planning on going in 2025. Atleast 2 photoshoots in 2025. Hopefully these are not outlandish goals to have lol.

I ended up sharing a lot rather then keeping it short. Oh well. I’m planning to donate a lot of my outfits to make closet space. Maybe we can play a ‘keep or donate’ game where I’ll show the outfits and we decide if it’s a keep or a donate?

My channel is @Cal_Less for crediting purposes.","I don’t know where to start, until now it's only felt like a bad trip. It started as any normal night for college a loner, a game console with four controllers, a party game guaranteed to send us to the ER for carpal tunnel, and enough beer to drown a mid-sized dog. It was destined to be a night of stupidity, glee, and light-hearted antics. Since I’m the pregaming master, I already had a few drinks down to celebrate the end of finals week and before we go back home for the holidays. It was amazing to let my brain have a break after all the stress it suffered; potential dependence be damned.

JT was the first to show up, if I had to describe him in a few words, it would be if Abe Lincoln was built like a Mac truck with fingers like sausages. Despite his imposing stature, he’s relatively mild mannered, but just a beer in and he becomes the Tom Brady of our drunken game nights. Cam was next. He was by far the most social and the only one who’s out and about every week getting some action The last of our pitiful party was Phil, my roommate. Phil isn’t his actual name, it’s Stephen, but when money was tight, we lived off the cheese steaks from the sandwich shop he works at for a week straight. After that the name just stuck.

Anyway, the game night was a double feature, the first event was one grand prix of Beeriokart followed by rounds upon rounds classic Mario Party where the current first place player(s) and minigame winner(s) take sips of a drink of their choice. We had made it past the Beeriokart section with barely a buzz except for Cam who was the lightweight of the group. Which was the reason for Beeriokart, otherwise Mario Party wouldn’t be fair. At the end of the Mario Party game, Phil had thoroughly crushed us all due to bonus stars and so the rest of us chugged the remainder of our drinks as we set up the movie marathon to end off an amazing night.

As JT fumbled through the Roku menus to open HBO Max, we heard a knock on the door. Phil, being the only one of us capable of at least holding a coherent conversation, answered the guest. It was the landlord’s annoying younger brother. This kid is always wrecking things in the common area, apparently, he’s on probation for breaking a kid's femur after the jerk had bullied his friend. I can respect the sentiment, but I guess the other kid’s parents filed a restraining order, so the little brat came to live in the building with his older brother. He wasn’t loud like he normally is so he must be on rent collection. I somehow managed to get out where I put the rent money between all the slurred speech. We went back to picking a movie when we heard another knock, the brat is back, and he wants to watch the movie with us. Since none of us were in the right state of mind, we let him stay. We finally decided on a movie. I fell asleep a quarter of the way in and started what may be the worst night of my life.

It was a pleasant dream, I woke up next to my buddies and the brat in the same room. We’re all just stretching, Phil already picking up some of our stuff in the process. As per my typical routine, I go to the windows to hopefully catch a whiff of the coffee shop across the street from the apartment complex. What I came across was a solid brick wall on the other side of the window. Next thing I know we all hear a loud bang and turn to find the brat’s upper arm scraped by the bullet. Blood slowly trickled down to his forearm as the poor kid hyperventilated through the pain. Me, half dazed but sobered by the gunshot, instructed the others to get away from the front of the door. I reached my hand across the door to the knob and quickly opened the door, firing one more shot at the other wall. After sweeping the doorway, we found a gun hooked up to a mechanism that fired a bullet when the door opened. I had seen enough body horror and torture movies to spot all the cliché traps.

After disabling a few more obvious traps we reached the end of the hall where it bended to the left. After trying to peek around the corner for a few minutes, I determined that there was no immediate danger. However, Cam took that as a sign to make a break for the elevator and set off another trap. I luckily managed to grab him and pull him to safety when I felt this sharp pain in my leg. A bit of shrapnel left a cut in my calf. After dressing my wound, me and the other guys inspected the scene and found that what cut me was shrapnel from a pipe bomb trap which was set up in the first room to the left. Whoever crafted these traps surely wanted us dead. JT, who was more toward the back, told us he heard footsteps. We all jumped up and rushed to see if there was anyone else in peril, but what we found still haunts me every night. It was a man in an off-white suit that seemed to glow in the darkness, and he was wearing an old bowler hat or fedora. We all ran towards him shouting, but he didn’t respond. He just stood there. He stood there until we were about five feet away, and then he started moving. He started to slowly turn his head and that’s when we saw what he looked like. His face was comprised of nothing but darkness, and in place of his eyes seemed to be glowing orbs.

We all violently shook awake from the worst group trip imaginable. The first thing on our minds were why was the apartment complex booby trapped and who was the mysterious “Hat Man?” Yet, that wasn’t even the worst part, because I looked down to see my calf, and saw about an inch deep cut and the blood stain left on my pajamas.

I reached out to Dr. Wolf in Michigan, but I made it two minutes before I got disqualified for my weight. I am 6', about 234 lbs (I'm estimating), and almost all muscle except in my hips, thighs, and chest. It doesn't matter-- over 225 lbs is too much, they can't anesthetize me safely, and they won't even let me ask about a consult until I've lost the weight.

Now I'm terrified. I've been reaching out to dozens of clinics across the US for years, and no one has ever mentioned a weight or BMI limit before. At every consult I've had, I was deemed a good candidate for surgery. I don't smoke, I'm not diabetic, I'm not hypertensive, I'm 25, I've been on T for three years, I have a diagnosis AND a prescription from my endocrinologist, and I have all of the paperwork from psychiatrist and therapist. If what Dr. Wolf's patients say is true, I even have enough savings to pay up front. But I'm technically in the ""obese"" category, and I'm absolutely terrified that my size is a critical variable I've failed to account for.

I'm tall and T has made me very muscular. I'm active, I rarely break 500 calories out of my 2,340/day allowance, I don't drink soda or eat fried foods or even put sweetener in my coffee, I've been living on kale and protein powder for months, I'm on ADHD medication that suppresses my appetite further, and the only way I've EVER been able to lose weight was when I was severely anorexic and I regularly went days on end without eating-- and I still couldn't meet that limit because I'm tall and there's just more muscle and bone than average. I've even scheduled with my PCP to talk about Ozempic because diet and exercise aren't working.

Is it a lost cause? I know now that BMI limits are par for the course, but If I can't get any thinner and I can't get any shorter, is it just hopeless? What can I do?",1,1737357965.0,TopSurgery,5,1.0,False

Perfect for adding a touch of comfort and functionality, poufs come in a variety of styles, shapes, and materials, making them an essential addition to any space. Whether you’re a fan of minimalism or love the charm of [boho decor](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/decorations), a pouf can elevate your interiors while serving multiple purposes. Let’s explore 10 creative ways to style a pouf in every room of your home.

# 1. Extra Seating in the Living Room

When hosting guests, extra seating is always a win. Place [poufs for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/poufs) seating around a coffee table for a casual and cozy gathering spot. Opt for poufs with textured fabrics or bold patterns to complement your existing decor.

**Tip:** Check out options for [home decor near me](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) to find poufs that match your color scheme and style.

# 2. As a Coffee Table Alternative

Replace a traditional coffee table with a sturdy pouf for a softer, more flexible option. Top it with a tray to create a flat surface for drinks, books, or decor. This works particularly well in small spaces where multifunctional furniture is key.

# 3. Footrest in the Bedroom

Place a pouf at the end of your bed or near a chair in your bedroom. It’s perfect as a footrest or as a place to sit while putting on shoes. For a boho decor vibe, choose poufs with woven textures, macramé, or earthy tones.

# 4. Kid-Friendly Playroom Seating

Poufs are lightweight and soft, making them ideal for kids’ rooms or play areas. Use them as playful seating that can easily be moved around. Brightly colored or whimsical-patterned poufs add a fun element to the space.

# 5. Functional Decor in the Entryway

Welcome guests with a pouf in the entryway. It serves as a convenient spot to sit while putting on shoes or a place to set down bags. A textured pouf can double as a statement piece to enhance your home decor.

# 6. Boho Chic Corner for Relaxation

Create a cozy reading or meditation nook by pairing a pouf with floor cushions, a throw blanket, and string lights. This works beautifully in any corner of your home, especially if you’re a fan of boho decor.

**Pro Tip:** Add a pouf in earthy tones or tribal patterns for an authentic bohemian vibe.

# 7. Outdoor Oasis

Don’t limit poufs to indoor use. Weather-resistant poufs can be styled on patios or balconies for additional seating or as a footrest near your outdoor furniture. They’re a great way to bring indoor comfort to your exterior spaces.

# 8. Stylish Storage in a Home Office

Choose poufs with hidden storage for a chic yet practical addition to your home office. Store small items like chargers, notebooks, or crafting supplies inside the pouf to keep your space tidy and functional.

# 9. Bathroom Luxury

Add a touch of luxury to your bathroom by placing a small pouf near the bathtub. It’s a perfect spot to set towels, candles, or a tray with your favorite bath essentials.

**Suggestion:** Look for options at home decor near me to find water-resistant poufs that are perfect for humid spaces.

# 10. Layered Style in the Living Room

**Why Poufs Are a Must-Have**

* **Versatility:** Whether used as seating, a footrest, or decor, poufs adapt to any room.
* **Space-Saving:** Lightweight and compact, poufs are easy to move and store.
* **Style Options:** From leather to woven designs, poufs come in a variety of styles to match any home decor theme.

One day we had lunch at a bar-cafe in which we were served by a waitress who was very patient as my friend wasn't with me, so I had to wait for him and he really wanted to eat pasta, which the bar doesn't have. I was kinda snarky and distant because I was hungry and the waitress came in the first time (when we were both sitting) to ask if I knew what to order, which I said no. After we ordered she walked to us to give us our drinks and pointed out that I had a very bad sunburn (I was really red on my shoulders and face but mostly on my legs, and I've got dark skin). After this my friend told me that that one time she was trying to start conversation with me and I was distant. Then he started telling me how she would look especially at me whenever she passed by and that I should ask her number. I didn't. 
Two days after I returned to this place to try the coffee and check for myself if what my friend told me was truth. I didn't sense what my friend told me. She wasn't as friendly as before and she wasn't actively looking at me as before. She was rather busier too as she took my order but another waitress delivered my coffee. Because of this I couldn't ask her number nor give mine.

The thing is, this situation and this waitress kept running circles in my head and tried looking her up in instagram, but failed. She was nowhere. 
So, now I'm thinking about sending her a letter via mail to attempt contacting her. Is this too wrong? Should I leave the whole thing behind?

I asked him that maybe in a month or so after space and time if we could get a low pressure coffee to see where we are. 

When we first got into a relationship things moved fast and I found myself sleeping at his house a lot. After awhile his job required him to be goneMonday to Friday. After a month of this and not seeing him I found myself going crazy. Anxiously asking for reassurance where it wasn’t needed or texting him multiple times when he didn’t answer the first. With his avoidant attachment and my anxious this just pushed both of us away. We were together for almost a year. 

My pushyness caused both of us to get overwhelmed. I believe if we go about this differently maybe we have another chance. If I fix my anxious and he his avoidant. So that we could meet each other halfway and then help move forward. 

He said he’s open to seeing me around mid February to see where we are if we worked on ourselves or just time to see if we truly aren’t what we want. To start off slow. I know this must sound juvenile but I truly love him and want the best for him. But I’m always willing to fight for what I want. I want both of us to have independence again. We just started way too fast and I believe we deserve a fighting chance. 

On one hand I want to truly work on my attachment styles. I don’t wanna be so insecure and sensitive. I want my own life because we suddenly became one person. But on the other hand I don’t wanna hold hope that I am what he’ll want after time and space and I’m scared.

Hi ADF community,

I ended week 2 at 65.7kg after doing 36H fasts on M-W-F. This week was even cleaner than first week, although I am not strict about it. I primarily drank decaf coffee + monkfruit extract, and 2-3 times with 2 tbsp of unsweetened macadamia milk (5 calories each spoon), Earl Grey tea + monkfruit extract, and either veggie soup or chicken bone broth. Once I did eat 100g of tofutaki noodles (tofu + shirataki/konjac noodles) with chicken bone broth before sleeping since I have a very early meeting next day and I was feeling quite peckish + a tad dizzy. The 100g of tofutaki noodle is only about 20 cal + bone broth in small bowl is about 25cal.

All in all, I keep my calories consumption on “dirty” fasting days to be well under 100cal.

On feasting days, I find that I am not craving all the random stuffs. And even though I am not strictly calorie counting, I find myself naturally gravitating towards less calorie-dense and healthier choices. Doesn’t mean I am avoiding treats I wanted like Tonkotsu ramen (albeit instant version), fried chicken, ice cream, custard baos, homemade milktea (with full cream milk, without sugar) and such though. Overall, I either eat below TDEE or just near TDEE. Very liberating, to be honest!

I believe majority of my water weight is shed, so going onward I will be primarily losing fat. Likely I will be shedding 0.5-0.8kg a week.

My goal is to get to my goal weight (60-62kg), and then switch to 18:6 for maintenance while exploring calisthenics or something else for building muscles (my right wrist is injured a few years ago when I used to do muay thai, so deadlifts and benchpress can be quite a pain) and sprinkle in 36-48 hours fasting once a week or so.

Hope y’all are rocking your days!

I will be back here at the end of my 3rd week.",2,1737356372.0,AlternateDayFasting,0,1.0,False

Since I got it, I rather pick up the Deck and play the game there instead of booting up my PC? But sometimes, games are not from Steam and installing them in Deck with all the launcher stuffs makes it a bit of a hassle. Also, other games don’t work because they need constant online connection. 

So, what games you own that you know you need to purchase again on Steam because of the Steamdeck? These are so far mine:
- GTA V
- Nier Automata
- Life is Strange Remastered Bundle
- LA Noire
- Assassin’s Creed Chronicles Trilogy
- Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga

Most of these games, I find playing on PC a bit boring, since I have to sit for a long time in order to play them. You’ll also notice that these games are just some cosy games with less to no complex mechanics. And for me, it make sense to play these games on SD than on PC. With the Steam Deck, I could bring this to bed, to coffee shops, could play it while I’m standing.

I want to know everyone’s take on this. And might be a good subreddit post for a game reco.

I can’t. It’s been months since I dropped everything and walked away from that project, and I haven’t touched a script since. That show… *Being a Serial Killer*. It was supposed to be a breakthrough. A high-concept, dark drama. At first, the ideas were exciting. The potential, endless. But then… everything changed.

I was halfway through a rewrite for the pilot episode when it happened. I can’t bring myself to say what, not yet. Not until I’m sure. But what I saw, what I *felt*… I can still hear it, sometimes, in the silence.

Now I’m back to searching for work, pretending things are normal. But it’s hard to ignore the weight of the trauma, the *nightmare* that follows me, and the nagging feeling that I didn’t just leave the show behind. Something followed me out.

I used to *relish* every moment of it. You know, ""being a serial killer""—it was *in my veins*, like I was born for it. It was *cutting-edge*, the way I’d craft each kill, shaping my own signature with *precision*. Some people collect stamps, others hoard antiques; me? I collected lives. And I was damn good at it. I didn’t just *slaughter*—I *created*. Each victim, carefully selected, was a canvas waiting for my *bloody brushstrokes*.

I was *ruthless*, sure, but that was the *point*. There was a rhythm, a flow to it. Like a perfectly composed symphony of terror, where every note had to be hit just right. The *chase* with the detectives? *Delicious*. It wasn’t just about the killing anymore—it was the *game*, the back and forth, the thrill of watching them think they had me cornered, only for me to *slip away* like a shadow. And when they thought they understood my pattern, when they thought they were one step ahead? I’d throw in a *twist*, keep them on their toes. It was a real *killer instinct*.

You can’t really call it a “hobby,” though, can you? It’s more than that. It was my *craft*. The way I meticulously planned every *slice*, every *cut* of the knife—it wasn’t just murder, it was art. And as for the gore? Well, I didn’t just *spill it*, I *painted with it*. Each drop, each splash—it was part of the *masterpiece*.

Being a serial killer wasn’t just what I did. It wasn't just another writing gig I had become completely immersed in and obsessed with. It was who I *was*.

Behind the scenes of *Being a Serial Killer*, it wasn’t the creative process that consumed me—it was the grind. The *endless grind*.

Hours spent brainstorming, writing, rewriting, refining. It was all for *nothing*, really. At least, that’s how it felt. The pay barely covered rent, let alone the therapy sessions I was already starting to need. But, of course, no one cared. Being a writer on a show was nothing more than a joke to the showrunners, who spent more time puffing up their egos than actually considering what went into making the thing. You were just a cog in the machine, your ideas ground down into dust by the relentless, soulless demands of the industry.

Every meeting was an exercise in humiliation. They’d ignore everything I said, dismiss my suggestions without a second thought, while fawning over some intern who couldn’t even spell “serial killer” correctly, let alone understand the depths of a character's motivations. Meanwhile, I was stuck fixing dialogue for characters who were barely more than caricatures of the twisted art I wanted to create.

But the worst part? The *title*. The one thing I had fought to keep authentic. ""Being a Serial Killer"" was *my vision*, raw and unapologetic. But they hated it. The execs, the showrunners, the suits—whatever you want to call them—they couldn't care less about the soul of the show. No, they wanted something marketable. Something more *mainstream*. And so, it was changed. *""Living With a Killer.""*

What a joke. A stupid, sanitized version of what was supposed to be a *gritty*, psychological horror series about a man who lived with the blood on his hands every day, suffocating under the weight of his own darkness. Instead, they wanted *lighthearted* moments. Maybe the protagonist would even have a kid! Or, a pet cat! A *cat*.

I should've seen the writing on the wall then. The *shadow* hanging over everything, thick and cold. The producers wanted a cat. *A cat.*

The whole damn world felt like it was against me, but none more so than this *cat*. Ms. Informal, as they called her. Or *Snuggles* in the script, whatever the hell that meant. I had a creeping suspicion that her name was the least of my problems.

Animal handlers were rushing past me, their faces flushed with urgency. They were frantic, searching high and low, whispering *her* name, but all I could hear in the background was the dull hum of the coffee maker as I neared the breakroom and my own bitter thoughts. I should’ve let it go, but I couldn’t.

I was in the breakroom, staring at the coffee machine, trying to ignore the growing weight in my chest.

I ordered my coffee—black, of course—and stood there, feeling the heat of the machine, the sound of the steam pressing against my skull. *Focus*, I told myself. Focus on anything but the cat.

That’s when I saw it. A tail.

No one else was around, and the place felt oddly still.

In a moment of sheer *stupidity*, I reached out and lifted the tablecloth. Just to get a glimpse. Just to see if I could finally put an end to this stupid, persistent feeling of tension the cat had caused.

I didn’t mean to do it. Really, I didn’t. But something in me snapped—something deep in the pit of my stomach. I lifted the cloth, and *there she was*. Her wide, glossy eyes fixed on mine, a flash of fear darting across her face.

I swear I didn’t mean to scare her. But when she bolted, when she shot out from under the table like a bolt of lightning, my gut twisted. *I* had made her do that.

She ran, straight for the window. My heart raced as she leapt up onto the sill, and in that single, terrifying moment, I could only watch in horror as she launched herself into the air.

My breath caught. I’d startled her so badly, I thought—*I thought*—I’d killed her.

I was *sick* to my stomach, my mind spinning as I rushed to the window. My hands trembled as I looked down, expecting to see a lifeless, mangled body sprawled out below.

But instead, the coffee burned my chest as I spilled it, the sudden pain of the hot liquid shocking me into a harsh, involuntary yell.

And then—I heard her.

The cat’s cry—a sharp, panicked meow.

She hadn’t hit the ground. She’d landed on a tree branch, and now she was stuck, too scared to move.

For a brief moment, I stood frozen there, chest searing with pain, the burning of the coffee mingling with the crushing weight of guilt. And yet, it was almost like something else was taking over. A strange, protective feeling rose inside me, a deep urge to make things right—to save her.

Without thinking, I pushed the window open further, the cool air rushing in. My head spun with confusion, guilt, and fear, but none of it stopped me.

I crawled out onto the windowsill, ignoring the stinging heat on my chest, and reached for the branch. My hand shook, but I climbed out further, inching closer to where she was stuck. The tree was low enough for me to reach, but she seemed so helpless, so *fragile*.

I could hear her cries, soft and terrified. And it was then, as my fingertips brushed the bark, that I realized something: I was trying to save a cat—*a cat*—after everything I had done.

Maybe I wasn’t the villain in this story after all.

I had to get her down.

I was almost there. The burning in my chest, the searing pain from the coffee spill, was fading now, replaced by something colder, something more urgent. Ms. Informal was perched on the branch, her eyes fixed on me. Her fur looked strange in the moonlight, darker, almost oily. She didn’t move when I crawled closer, not an inch. Her eyes never left me, as if she were *waiting*.

I stretched out my hand, trembling, heart hammering in my chest. I had to help her. I couldn’t leave her here, stuck on this branch.

But as my fingers brushed her fur, something was wrong.

It wasn’t the softness I expected. No, this was slick, too slick. Cold, like rubber. My skin crawled. I pulled my hand back, but before I could react, I heard it.

*The meow.*

But it wasn’t right. The sound was *off*, too high-pitched, distorted. Like it was coming from the wrong throat, the wrong creature. And then—before I could even make sense of it—*she* made a sound that didn’t belong.

A shriek.

It wasn’t a meow. It wasn’t anything I’d ever heard from a cat. It was a jagged, bone-shaking wail that vibrated deep in my chest. My vision blurred with the sound, the world around me trembling.

And that’s when it happened.

The fur *split open*.

It wasn’t gradual. It wasn’t a slow transformation. One moment, she was a cat. The next, she was *ripping open* like a cheap costume. A seam ran down her back, a line of darkness, and then—*she split apart*.

I froze. My hand was still stuck in the mess, sinking deeper into the writhing thing that *wasn’t* a cat. It was worse than any nightmare. Beneath the fur—beneath the mask of normality—was *something*... *wrong*.

It was like spaghetti. No—worse. Like *spaghetti* and *meatballs*, if they were made of maggots and gore. A wet, glistening mass of wriggling, slimy tendrils. It oozed and *squirmed*, pulsing with unnatural life. The texture was all wrong—slick and sticky under my fingers, like I was touching something *alive* but not alive, something that should not exist.

I tried to pull my hand back. I *wanted to* pull away, but it was as if my fingers were glued to it, sucked into the mass of writhing filth.

And then—*it shrieked again.*

Not a meow, not a scream—this was a *scream*. A wail that vibrated through my skull, rattling my brain, clawing into my mind. The thing inside *her* was *alive*, something alien, something wrong.

I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t move.

My vision blurred. The tree tilted. The world around me cracked, splintering, breaking into pieces.

I felt myself falling.

It wasn’t slow. It wasn’t graceful.

I plummeted, the ground rushing up at me in a terrifying blur. My limbs flailed, my chest tight from the burning pain, but it didn’t matter. Nothing mattered. My screams mixed with the thing’s wails. And then—*crash*.

When I woke, I was in a hospital room.

It was so quiet.

Too quiet.

The white walls, the sterile air—it all felt *wrong*. My body ached, but there was a strange detachment, as if I wasn’t fully present in it. It was like waking up from a nightmare, but instead of relief, I felt... *empty*.

I blinked, confused. The room was too clean, too peaceful. I didn’t know how I got here.

My chest was still burning from the coffee, but it didn’t feel like it was mine anymore. My head spun.

And then, it hit me.

The tree.

*Her*.

*That thing*.

I gasped, my breath catching in my throat. I bolted upright, panic flooding me. The memory of what I had touched, what I had *felt*, slammed into me like a freight train. My stomach lurched.

I screamed. It came out of me, raw, desperate, the sound scratching at my throat.

I tried to stand, but my limbs weren’t cooperating. My arms were weak, my body unsteady. I thrashed in the bed, the sheets tangling around my legs as the terror surged through me.

“Get off me!” I screamed, my voice shaking. “I can’t—I can’t—”

The door swung open. Two men stepped inside, their faces blank, expressionless. One of them was the producer, the other was a lawyer. They didn’t seem surprised to see me like this. Not the way I was, thrashing in panic.

They didn’t even blink.

“Are you… okay?” the producer asked, his voice flat, like he was reading from a script.

The lawyer didn’t even look at me, his eyes glued to his clipboard. “We need to know when you’ll be able to finish the script. Or if we need to replace you.”

*Replace me?*

I froze. Replace me? They wanted to replace me?

The horror surged back in a flood of nausea. The cat—the thing—I could still feel it, the cold wetness of it, the shriek ringing in my ears.

I snapped. The laugh bubbled out of me, manic, wild.

“Replace me!” I yelled, my voice rising. “Yeah, replace me. I’m *done*. I’m *finished*. I won’t be coming back.”

The laughter was bubbling up like a broken dam, spilling from my mouth in a cracked, deranged sound.

Their eyes were wide now, but they didn’t understand. They couldn’t understand.

I leaned forward, my eyes wild. “You *got a cat*!” I shouted, pointing at them, my words slurring into madness. “She’s some *cat*, you—”

I cackled. It wasn’t a laugh. It was a howl, a cry of madness, of terror, of *freedom*. They didn’t get it. They didn’t *see* it.

“She’s some *cat*,” I shouted, louder and louder, the sound echoing in the sterile room. “You got a cat! You don’t know what’s in there, but I do!”

Later I felt much better and I made a full recovery. I went home, and thought about how I might enjoy a job as a trash collector, or a pool boy, or perhaps as a bartender. I don't think I'll ever write anything, ever again, though, and that might be the worst of it.

I just don't know if I'll ever be able to go back to doing what I loved. I don't think about ""being a serial killer"" anymore, I'm well cured of all that gorenography and nightmare fuel. In fact, I doubt I'll ever write again.",3,1737355649.0,Wholesomenosleep,0,1.0,False

When you walk into a [**Canadian candy store**](https://candyville.ca) like [**Candyville**](https://candyville.ca), you're greeted by rows of colorful treats that are almost impossible to resist. From chocolate bars to gummies, Canada’s candy culture is rich, diverse, and undeniably delightful. But if you've ever tasted a sweet treat from across the Atlantic, you might have found yourself wondering: Is European candy better than Canadian sweets? Let's dig into this sugary debate and explore what sets these confections apart.

**1. A Tale of Two Candy Cultures**

European and Canadian candies both bring unique flavors and styles to the table, shaped by their cultural roots.

* **European Candy:** European confections are often crafted with meticulous attention to detail, emphasizing rich, high-quality ingredients. Swiss chocolate, Belgian pralines, and German gummy bears are internationally renowned for their taste and texture. Many European brands adhere to stricter ingredient standards, often avoiding artificial flavors and preservatives.
* **Canadian Candy:** Canada's candy culture, on the other hand, is a blend of homegrown favorites and influences from its multicultural population. From the ever-popular Coffee Crisp to the beloved maple sugar candies, Canadian sweets celebrate local flavors and traditions.

**2. Key Differences Between European and Canadian Sweets**

**a) Chocolate Quality:** European chocolates are often smoother and creamier due to their higher cocoa butter content. Brands like Lindt and Milka exemplify this with their luxurious textures. Canadian chocolate, while delightful, often leans sweeter and contains more sugar, catering to North American palates.

**b) Flavor Profiles:** European candies prioritize natural flavors, resulting in subtle, refined tastes. For example, fruit-flavored candies often taste like the real thing, thanks to natural fruit extracts. Canadian sweets, however, tend to favor bold, intense flavors, such as the tartness of Sour Patch Kids or the deep caramel notes in Mackintosh’s Toffee.

**c) Packaging Aesthetics:** European candy brands often embrace elegant, minimalist packaging, emphasizing premium quality. Canadian candies, in contrast, opt for bright, playful designs that resonate with a fun-loving audience.

**3. Iconic Examples: European vs. Canadian Favorites**

**European Classics:** 

* **Toblerone (Switzerland):** Known for its iconic triangular shape and honey-almond nougat.
* **Haribo Goldbears (Germany):** A gummy staple with perfectly chewy consistency.
* **Ferrero Rocher (Italy):** A luxurious blend of hazelnuts, chocolate, and wafer.

**Canadian Gems**

* **Smarties:** The Canadian version of this candy-coated chocolate favorite is distinct from the European kind.
* **Big Turk:** A unique candy bar combining Turkish Delight with a chocolate coating.
* **Maple Candies:** Pure, quintessentially Canadian treats bursting with natural maple flavor.

**4. Why the Buzz Around European Candy in Canada?**

European candies have gained a cult following in Canada for a few reasons:

* **Exclusivity:** Imported candies often feel special because they’re harder to find.
* **Novelty:** Flavors like blackcurrant, marzipan, and salted licorice offer a departure from the usual North American options.
* **Perceived Quality:** European brands have a reputation for using premium ingredients, which appeals to discerning candy lovers.

At Candyville, we've noticed a growing trend of customers seeking European imports, from artisanal chocolates to nostalgic retro sweets.

**5. What Canadian Candy Lovers Think**

For many Canadians, local favorites hold a special place in their hearts. Nostalgia plays a huge role in candy preferences, with treats like Aero, Oh Henry!, and the classic Kinder Surprise egg evoking fond childhood memories.

However, adventurous snackers often find European candies irresistible for their unique textures and sophisticated flavors. It’s not unusual to see Canadian candy enthusiasts stocking up on Kinder Bueno or Cadbury Dairy Milk from Europe.

**6. Which Is Better? The Sweet Verdict**

There’s no definitive answer to whether European candy is better than Canadian sweets—it all boils down to personal preference. Are you drawn to the creamy decadence of a Swiss chocolate bar, or do you prefer the comforting sweetness of a Coffee Crisp?

At Candyville, we embrace the best of both worlds. Our shelves are stocked with a delightful mix of European imports and Canadian classics, ensuring there’s something for everyone.

**7. Tips for Exploring New Candy Flavors**

If you’re eager to expand your candy palate, here are a few tips:

* **Start Small:** Try mini versions of candies to sample a variety without overindulging.
* **Mix and Match:** Create your own candy tasting platter with selections from both Europe and Canada.
* **Ask the Experts:** Staff at your local candy store, like Candyville, are always happy to recommend new treats based on your preferences.

**8. Discover the World of Candy at Candyville**

Whether you’re craving the rich, velvety taste of a European chocolate bar or the playful sweetness of a Canadian classic, Candyville has you covered. Explore our curated selection of global confections and let your taste buds embark on a delicious journey.

1i5jyvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i5jyvf/i_quit_being_a_serial_killer_because_of_a/,I Quit Being A Serial Killer Because Of A Terrifying Experience Involving A Cat In A Tree,"I used to be a screenwriter—well, I suppose I still am, technically, but I don’t write anymore. I can’t. It’s been months since I dropped everything and walked away from that project, and I haven’t touched a script since. That show… *Being a Serial Killer*. It was supposed to be a breakthrough. A high-concept, dark drama. At first, the ideas were exciting. The potential, endless. But then… everything changed.

I was halfway through a rewrite for the pilot episode when it happened. I can’t bring myself to say what, not yet. Not until I’m sure. But what I saw, what I *felt*… I can still hear it, sometimes, in the silence.

Now I’m back to searching for work, pretending things are normal. But it’s hard to ignore the weight of the trauma, the *nightmare* that follows me, and the nagging feeling that I didn’t just leave the show behind. Something followed me out.

I used to *relish* every moment of it. You know, ""being a serial killer""—it was *in my veins*, like I was born for it. It was *cutting-edge*, the way I’d craft each kill, shaping my own signature with *precision*. Some people collect stamps, others hoard antiques; me? I collected lives. And I was damn good at it. I didn’t just *slaughter*—I *created*. Each victim, carefully selected, was a canvas waiting for my *bloody brushstrokes*.

I was *ruthless*, sure, but that was the *point*. There was a rhythm, a flow to it. Like a perfectly composed symphony of terror, where every note had to be hit just right. The *chase* with the detectives? *Delicious*. It wasn’t just about the killing anymore—it was the *game*, the back and forth, the thrill of watching them think they had me cornered, only for me to *slip away* like a shadow. And when they thought they understood my pattern, when they thought they were one step ahead? I’d throw in a *twist*, keep them on their toes. It was a real *killer instinct*.

You can’t really call it a “hobby,” though, can you? It’s more than that. It was my *craft*. The way I meticulously planned every *slice*, every *cut* of the knife—it wasn’t just murder, it was art. And as for the gore? Well, I didn’t just *spill it*, I *painted with it*. Each drop, each splash—it was part of the *masterpiece*.

Being a serial killer wasn’t just what I did. It wasn't just another writing gig I had become completely immersed in and obsessed with. It was who I *was*.

Behind the scenes of *Being a Serial Killer*, it wasn’t the creative process that consumed me—it was the grind. The *endless grind*.

Hours spent brainstorming, writing, rewriting, refining. It was all for *nothing*, really. At least, that’s how it felt. The pay barely covered rent, let alone the therapy sessions I was already starting to need. But, of course, no one cared. Being a writer on a show was nothing more than a joke to the showrunners, who spent more time puffing up their egos than actually considering what went into making the thing. You were just a cog in the machine, your ideas ground down into dust by the relentless, soulless demands of the industry.

Every meeting was an exercise in humiliation. They’d ignore everything I said, dismiss my suggestions without a second thought, while fawning over some intern who couldn’t even spell “serial killer” correctly, let alone understand the depths of a character's motivations. Meanwhile, I was stuck fixing dialogue for characters who were barely more than caricatures of the twisted art I wanted to create.

But the worst part? The *title*. The one thing I had fought to keep authentic. ""Being a Serial Killer"" was *my vision*, raw and unapologetic. But they hated it. The execs, the showrunners, the suits—whatever you want to call them—they couldn't care less about the soul of the show. No, they wanted something marketable. Something more *mainstream*. And so, it was changed. *""Living With a Killer.""*

What a joke. A stupid, sanitized version of what was supposed to be a *gritty*, psychological horror series about a man who lived with the blood on his hands every day, suffocating under the weight of his own darkness. Instead, they wanted *lighthearted* moments. Maybe the protagonist would even have a kid! Or, a pet cat! A *cat*.

I should've seen the writing on the wall then. The *shadow* hanging over everything, thick and cold. The producers wanted a cat. *A cat.*

The whole damn world felt like it was against me, but none more so than this *cat*. Ms. Informal, as they called her. Or *Snuggles* in the script, whatever the hell that meant. I had a creeping suspicion that her name was the least of my problems.

Animal handlers were rushing past me, their faces flushed with urgency. They were frantic, searching high and low, whispering *her* name, but all I could hear in the background was the dull hum of the coffee maker as I neared the breakroom and my own bitter thoughts. I should’ve let it go, but I couldn’t.

I was in the breakroom, staring at the coffee machine, trying to ignore the growing weight in my chest.

I ordered my coffee—black, of course—and stood there, feeling the heat of the machine, the sound of the steam pressing against my skull. *Focus*, I told myself. Focus on anything but the cat.

That’s when I saw it. A tail.

No one else was around, and the place felt oddly still.

In a moment of sheer *stupidity*, I reached out and lifted the tablecloth. Just to get a glimpse. Just to see if I could finally put an end to this stupid, persistent feeling of tension the cat had caused.

I didn’t mean to do it. Really, I didn’t. But something in me snapped—something deep in the pit of my stomach. I lifted the cloth, and *there she was*. Her wide, glossy eyes fixed on mine, a flash of fear darting across her face.

I swear I didn’t mean to scare her. But when she bolted, when she shot out from under the table like a bolt of lightning, my gut twisted. *I* had made her do that.

She ran, straight for the window. My heart raced as she leapt up onto the sill, and in that single, terrifying moment, I could only watch in horror as she launched herself into the air.

My breath caught. I’d startled her so badly, I thought—*I thought*—I’d killed her.

I was *sick* to my stomach, my mind spinning as I rushed to the window. My hands trembled as I looked down, expecting to see a lifeless, mangled body sprawled out below.

But instead, the coffee burned my chest as I spilled it, the sudden pain of the hot liquid shocking me into a harsh, involuntary yell.

And then—I heard her.

The cat’s cry—a sharp, panicked meow.

She hadn’t hit the ground. She’d landed on a tree branch, and now she was stuck, too scared to move.

For a brief moment, I stood frozen there, chest searing with pain, the burning of the coffee mingling with the crushing weight of guilt. And yet, it was almost like something else was taking over. A strange, protective feeling rose inside me, a deep urge to make things right—to save her.

Without thinking, I pushed the window open further, the cool air rushing in. My head spun with confusion, guilt, and fear, but none of it stopped me.

I crawled out onto the windowsill, ignoring the stinging heat on my chest, and reached for the branch. My hand shook, but I climbed out further, inching closer to where she was stuck. The tree was low enough for me to reach, but she seemed so helpless, so *fragile*.

I could hear her cries, soft and terrified. And it was then, as my fingertips brushed the bark, that I realized something: I was trying to save a cat—*a cat*—after everything I had done.

Maybe I wasn’t the villain in this story after all.

I had to get her down.

I was almost there. The burning in my chest, the searing pain from the coffee spill, was fading now, replaced by something colder, something more urgent. Ms. Informal was perched on the branch, her eyes fixed on me. Her fur looked strange in the moonlight, darker, almost oily. She didn’t move when I crawled closer, not an inch. Her eyes never left me, as if she were *waiting*.

I stretched out my hand, trembling, heart hammering in my chest. I had to help her. I couldn’t leave her here, stuck on this branch.

But as my fingers brushed her fur, something was wrong.

It wasn’t the softness I expected. No, this was slick, too slick. Cold, like rubber. My skin crawled. I pulled my hand back, but before I could react, I heard it.

*The meow.*

But it wasn’t right. The sound was *off*, too high-pitched, distorted. Like it was coming from the wrong throat, the wrong creature. And then—before I could even make sense of it—*she* made a sound that didn’t belong.

A shriek.

It wasn’t a meow. It wasn’t anything I’d ever heard from a cat. It was a jagged, bone-shaking wail that vibrated deep in my chest. My vision blurred with the sound, the world around me trembling.

And that’s when it happened.

The fur *split open*.

It wasn’t gradual. It wasn’t a slow transformation. One moment, she was a cat. The next, she was *ripping open* like a cheap costume. A seam ran down her back, a line of darkness, and then—*she split apart*.

I froze. My hand was still stuck in the mess, sinking deeper into the writhing thing that *wasn’t* a cat. It was worse than any nightmare. Beneath the fur—beneath the mask of normality—was *something*... *wrong*.

It was like spaghetti. No—worse. Like *spaghetti* and *meatballs*, if they were made of maggots and gore. A wet, glistening mass of wriggling, slimy tendrils. It oozed and *squirmed*, pulsing with unnatural life. The texture was all wrong—slick and sticky under my fingers, like I was touching something *alive* but not alive, something that should not exist.

I tried to pull my hand back. I *wanted to* pull away, but it was as if my fingers were glued to it, sucked into the mass of writhing filth.

And then—*it shrieked again.*

Not a meow, not a scream—this was a *scream*. A wail that vibrated through my skull, rattling my brain, clawing into my mind. The thing inside *her* was *alive*, something alien, something wrong.

I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t move.

My vision blurred. The tree tilted. The world around me cracked, splintering, breaking into pieces.

I felt myself falling.

It wasn’t slow. It wasn’t graceful.

I plummeted, the ground rushing up at me in a terrifying blur. My limbs flailed, my chest tight from the burning pain, but it didn’t matter. Nothing mattered. My screams mixed with the thing’s wails. And then—*crash*.

When I woke, I was in a hospital room.

It was so quiet.

Too quiet.

The white walls, the sterile air—it all felt *wrong*. My body ached, but there was a strange detachment, as if I wasn’t fully present in it. It was like waking up from a nightmare, but instead of relief, I felt... *empty*.

I blinked, confused. The room was too clean, too peaceful. I didn’t know how I got here.

My chest was still burning from the coffee, but it didn’t feel like it was mine anymore. My head spun.

And then, it hit me.

The tree.

*Her*.

*That thing*.

I gasped, my breath catching in my throat. I bolted upright, panic flooding me. The memory of what I had touched, what I had *felt*, slammed into me like a freight train. My stomach lurched.

I screamed. It came out of me, raw, desperate, the sound scratching at my throat.

I tried to stand, but my limbs weren’t cooperating. My arms were weak, my body unsteady. I thrashed in the bed, the sheets tangling around my legs as the terror surged through me.

“Get off me!” I screamed, my voice shaking. “I can’t—I can’t—”

The door swung open. Two men stepped inside, their faces blank, expressionless. One of them was the producer, the other was a lawyer. They didn’t seem surprised to see me like this. Not the way I was, thrashing in panic.

They didn’t even blink.

“Are you… okay?” the producer asked, his voice flat, like he was reading from a script.

The lawyer didn’t even look at me, his eyes glued to his clipboard. “We need to know when you’ll be able to finish the script. Or if we need to replace you.”

*Replace me?*

I froze. Replace me? They wanted to replace me?

The horror surged back in a flood of nausea. The cat—the thing—I could still feel it, the cold wetness of it, the shriek ringing in my ears.

I snapped. The laugh bubbled out of me, manic, wild.

“Replace me!” I yelled, my voice rising. “Yeah, replace me. I’m *done*. I’m *finished*. I won’t be coming back.”

The laughter was bubbling up like a broken dam, spilling from my mouth in a cracked, deranged sound.

Their eyes were wide now, but they didn’t understand. They couldn’t understand.

I leaned forward, my eyes wild. “You *got a cat*!” I shouted, pointing at them, my words slurring into madness. “She’s some *cat*, you—”

I cackled. It wasn’t a laugh. It was a howl, a cry of madness, of terror, of *freedom*. They didn’t get it. They didn’t *see* it.

“She’s some *cat*,” I shouted, louder and louder, the sound echoing in the sterile room. “You got a cat! You don’t know what’s in there, but I do!”

Later I felt much better and I made a full recovery. I went home, and thought about how I might enjoy a job as a trash collector, or a pool boy, or perhaps as a bartender. I don't think I'll ever write anything, ever again, though, and that might be the worst of it.

I just don't know if I'll ever be able to go back to doing what I loved. I don't think about ""being a serial killer"" anymore, I'm well cured of all that gorenography and nightmare fuel. In fact, I doubt I'll ever write again.",13,1737354234.0,nosleep,1,0.94,False

Baby steps = Actual action, which causes lots of hope. It makes it so much easier to tolerate the bullshit. I am SO excited about the progress! I am also so very fucking sad. It's so fucked up. This has been the most fucked up few years of my life. I am not crazy, but I feel crazy. I feel so crazy that I don't say a word to anyone else about any of this... for fear they'll think I'm crazy, lol.

Anywho... ""Hypothetical"" situation (for you, this is my reality).

*Trigger warning* This is most likely a story about an abusive relationship.

You're a couple (boyfriend/girlfriend). You've been together for 2 1/2 years. Cliché AF, but you met at work and couldn't breath when you were in each other's air space, yada, yada. You were fucked the moment you met.

Except... You were married. A decent enough marriage; no fighting, you live well together, respect each other, no jealousy, etc... But there is no passion, no desire, no body tingling amount of love.

You ended your marriage for the feeling you always knew you were missing with your husband. Your husband is a great best friend, but he shouldn't be your husband.

This new feeling is intense and impossible to ignore. 3ish months in, you find out he's addicted to a popular street drug most common in the midwest.

Doesn't matter. You guys can figure it out. You're already totally vested into this man. There was no stopping or slowing your fall.

Two hellish and tumultuous years later, shit hits the fan and he hits bottom. 911, psych, rehab. Sober.

As if the drugs were never even a factor... Nothing more than a distant bad dream.

Life is fucking perfect. I loved him so fucking hard. I never knew it possible. It was incredible... And mutual. So perfect.

A few months later, he starts skipping meetings. It's a quick downward spiral from there.

That was three months ago. The only way to describe the past three months is... utterly terrible.

In the last month or so, your boyfriend made a new friend.

Your boyfriend totally hides this friend from you. He never tells you when he's going there. He never admits to being there, and when asked about it, he lies. He refuses to let you meet him. He only gives you a first name, and he goes there multiple times a day... Every single day. When you ask what they're doing over there, you aren't given any of that information. either. You are totally and completely in the dark.

When you try to express your issues and discomfort with this situation, you're told that you should be okay with it and allow it to continue as it has been.

So, your boyfriend has a new friend, he won't give you their last name, he hides and lies when he goes over there, which is multiple times a day, every single day, he doesn't tell you anything that goes on over there or why he wants to be there so much, and you're expected to be okay with.

Naturally, you are not okay with it. Regardless, you are addicted to this man, so you bite your tongue and try to just enjoy his presence.

End hypothetical situation. Back to my reality...

It's easy to ignore everything when he's in my air. I'm suffocated by the attraction, but the moment he leaves and starts on his bullshit... Those emotions are so much stronger than anything else I've ever experienced in my life.

So, earlier today... He told me that I should be okay with his secret life. I asked him if that meant that I could have a secret life, too. He told me, ""Sure."" I knew he didn't mean it.

A few hours later, he still isn't home, and I'm steaming mad. This mofo brings out a crazy in me that I never even knew existed prior to him. I hate it so, so, so much. Well, [I fucked up and fucked with him](https://imgur.com/a/0zBv1E4) (I was lying about having friends over). Never in a million years did I expect his response... Within 60 seconds of me sending my last text, he was at the door, trying to kick it in, so I unlocked it for him.

This ensued...

He yeeted [my dinner](https://imgur.com/a/fBXPYeb) all over the couch and living room floor.
My dinner was sitting on [this](https://imgur.com/VuAmk23), which he used to Hulk Smash [my coffee table](https://imgur.com/a/kLi8Zq1).

I made him clean up the food mess before making him leave. Shortly after he left, I realized my front camera had been thrown on the ground somewhere.

That triggered [these](https://imgur.com/a/UduWEii) texts... 

There is a fence between where I was and where he threw the camera that required 1/2 mile walk round-trip and it's 8 fucking degrees outside, lol.

Which resulted in a [police](https://imgur.com/a/Jr5e91a) report being filed for the damages.

The conversation ended [here](https://imgur.com/a/6RpPB3V).

It's been a helluva night. My entire life fundamentally changed right before my eyes.

I am both so, so, so grateful and excited to be away from him, and absolutely heartbroken to the point I have actual, physical pain. I hate him so fucking much. Fuck.

I'm so ready to be done, and I really think this may be it. 🤞",7,1737354108.0,abusiverelationships,1,0.9,False

Preferabbly pre-ground para alam ko anong size ng ground gagayahin pag bumili na ako ng grinder.

Thank you!",1,1737354064.0,CoffeePH,0,1.0,False
1i5jx48,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1i5jx48/merci_per_le_chocolat/,Merci per le chocolat,"I watched Claude Chabrol’s “Merci per le chocolat” and I feel quite confused about what actually happened in that film. I did stop watching it halfway through, took a break and came back to it but I don’t think that matters. Can someone explain to me why was Isabelle Huppert’s character poisoning the son? What exactly was her motivation? I get that she wanted to get rid of the mother and replace but what’s with hurting him? And do we ever find out if the girl is biological child of the pianist? And what exactly happened in the final coffee scene who was supposed to be poisoned? Both of them? I would appreciate some clarity and it’s currently on Mubi. ",1,1737354032.0,TrueFilm,0,1.0,False
