I use the Ultrahuman ring but my sleep patterns weren't all that great on the Apple watch either. The only reason I can think of is that I work out in the evening (pretty intense lifting, around 7PM), but my schedule doesn't really allow for morning workouts. Got a physical a few months ago and everything seemed fine so I'm not sure what else I can do. Any advice? Tired of always feeling tired ü´†",2,1753777007.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

1mc5ru2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1mc5ru2/his_regret_came_too_late/,His Regret Came Too Late,"Chapter 1‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãMy daughter froze to death because my husband thought I kidnapped his bastards.He tied her upside down to a utility pole. In the middle of a blizzard. And left her there all night.By the time I reached her, her tiny lips were blue, her lashes covered in frost, and her arms hung limp like a broken doll.I screamed her name‚Äîonce, twice‚Äîbut Kiara didn‚Äôt answer. My baby didn‚Äôt even flinch.I fell to my knees, clutching her frozen body, barely breathing as I whispered, ‚ÄúColsen, she‚Äôs your daughter too. How could you do this to her?‚Äù‚ÄúShe‚Äôs my child,‚Äù he snarled, ‚Äújust like Rafael and Brian. If you hate me, fine‚Äîbut why punish innocent kids? Where did you hide them, Elsie?!‚ÄùMy throat tightened. I didn‚Äôt know how to respond‚Äîbecause nothing I said would matter.So he did worse.He ordered someone to throw my already unconscious daughter into a frozen lake.I dragged her out with trembling hands, screaming until my voice cracked. But Kiara never woke up.At the hospital, the doctor shook his head. ‚ÄúThere's nothing we can do. Her organs have shut down. It‚Äôs too late.‚ÄùShe had just turned seven yesterday.And now she was gone. Not because of illness. Not because of fate. But because I married a man who thought his mistresses‚Äô children were worth more than our own.I took her lifeless body to the funeral home that night, then wandered back to the house to fetch her favorite doll.But the moment I opened the door, I heard laughter.There they were‚ÄîColsen‚Äôs ‚Äúmissing‚Äù sons‚Äîplaying happily in the living room.And Colsen?He was on the couch with her, arms wrapped around the woman who helped ruin everything.My head started spinning at the sight. My mind went completely blank.When Colsen noticed me, the grin on his face disappeared. ""Oh, you're back?"" he said flatly.He gave me a cold glance and added, ""Looks like the punishment worked. You must've been scared enough to return Rafael and Brian in the middle of the night. Since they're both fine, and Astrid is kind-hearted, I'll let this whole thing go.""I didn't respond. He narrowed his eyes and said with a chill in his voice, ""To keep the boys from going missing again, I'll be keeping them close from now on. Starting today, Astrid and her two sons will be living here too. You'd better drop whatever wicked ideas you've got and learn to get along.""Get along? What a joke.Kiara had just passed away, and he expected me to live under the same roof as his illegitimate twins, like nothing had happened.I clenched my fists, but my throat was too dry to speak.Seeing I was silent, he frowned and asked, ""Where's Kiara? What did you do with her? I shouldn't have tied her up like that, but you left me no choice. If you hadn't hidden my two sons, I wouldn't have gone that far. Kiara's always been a smart kid. I'm sure she'll understand.""Understand?But he had no idea that the sweet, gentle child who never gave him trouble was dead because of him. Killed by his own hands. Just thinking of Kiara made my chest feel like it was being torn apart.I looked at those two boys laughing on the slide, and fury exploded inside me. If it weren't for them, my daughter would still be alive!In a sudden rage, I lunged forward and grabbed both boys by the neck with all the strength I had.""Elsie Flynn! What are you doing?!"" Colsen rushed over and yanked me back violently, throwing me to the floor.""I thought you had changed, but you're still so cruel and full of hate! What did these boys ever do to deserve this from you?!""Astrid quickly wrapped her arms around the crying children and burst into tears. ""Elsie, it's all my fault. If you're angry, be mad at me. Please, just don't hurt them anymore...""""Colsen stared at me with a cold expression, his gaze sharp and cold.""Elsie, Astrid has always been kind and never tried to take anything from you. Why can't you just accept her?""My eyes burned with tears, and my heart felt like it was being torn apart. ""Colsen... do you even know... do you have any idea what you did to Kiara...""Before I could finish, I suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood.The sorrow overwhelmed me, and I collapsed unconscious.Chapter 2‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãWhen I opened my eyes again, I realized I was locked inside the room. I reached into my pocket to call for help, but my phone was gone.Still in shock, I heard the door creak open slowly. Standing in the doorway, lit from behind, was Colsen.He walked over and stopped near the bed, speaking in a calm but serious tone, ""Elsie, it's normal for rich men to have more than one woman. Can't you be more understanding? No matter how many women are out there, you'll always be my legal wife. Kiara will always be my eldest daughter. No one can take your place. Why can't you accept that?""I looked at the man before me, crying silently. He felt like a stranger now, and it terrified me.We had fallen in love back in college. We married after graduation and had been together for over ten years.In the beginning, I gave him all my savings to help him get started. I stayed by his side as he grew from a broke student into a billionaire businessman.But just a year after he became successful, he had an affair. Everything he had promised me became meaningless.When I discovered he had another family, I lost control. I screamed, cried, and made a huge scene.I refused to divorce him because I didn't want the money we built together to end up in the hands of his illegitimate children. So I clung to the marriage certificate, refused to sign the divorce papers, and did everything I could to keep control of the company's finances. I promised myself I'd protect Kiara's inheritance‚Äîno matter what.But it was my refusal to let go that ended up causing Kiara's death.Now I finally see things clearly. I'm done fighting and making a fuss.In a raspy voice, I told him, ""Colsen, I won't argue anymore... I just want a divorce.""""You're stubborn!"" he snapped, his eyes darkening as he slammed his hand on the table. ""You still don't understand the situation! Since that's the case, stay in this room until you reflect on yourself. Once you realize your mistake, I'll let you out!""Then he turned and walked out, closing the door behind him with a loud bang.""No!"" I screamed, rushing to the door and banging on it. ""Colsen, open the door! I can't stay locked in here!""Kiara is still lying in the funeral home. I haven't even buried her yet. I can't be trapped here!""Open the door, Colsen!"" I shouted.But no matter how desperately I shouted, the only answer I got was the hollow echo of my own voice in the empty room.Chapter 3‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãIt wasn't until later that night that the door finally opened again. Astrid came inside, holding a glass of water.She stood in front of me with a mocking smirk, her voice dripping with provocation. ""Elsie, just look at yourself. You look completely drained. No spark, no youth, no life left in you. No wonder Colsen chose me instead!""Her words didn't bother me anymore.I truly didn't care who Colsen chose to love.""Oh, right, did your daughter die?"" Astrid asked, sneering proudly. ""Honestly, I hid the twins on purpose to make you look like the bad one. And it was my idea to hang your daughter up in the freezing wind all night. I suggested it to Colsen. Who would've thought it'd work so well and kill that little brat in one go? She's just like you‚Äîweak and pathetic.""Elsie, the Breslin family business will soon belong to my kids! And I'll be the next Mrs. Breslin!""""Astrid!"" The second I heard her cruel words, I couldn't stay calm anymore.Furious, I ran toward her, grabbed her hair, and screamed like a mad woman, ""You vile woman! My daughter didn't do anything to you. Why did you hurt her?""""Ah!"" Astrid suddenly dropped to her knees with a loud thud and started begging with fake tears. ""Elsie, I'm sorry. I never should've gone after Colsen or destroyed your family. Please stop hitting me...""Then, the door burst open with a loud bang.Colsen stormed in, his face filled with rage. ""Elsie!""He marched toward me and slapped me hard across the face. ""Astrid came in to bring you water out of kindness. Instead of being grateful, you hit her? How could you be so cruel?""The blow knocked me over.My forehead hit the edge of the table, and a sharp pain followed. Warm blood started dripping down my face.But I didn't care about the injury. I stood up, pleading with him. ""Colsen, please let me go. Kiara froze to death because of you. Her body is still at the funeral home. She hasn't even been cremated. I can't let her leave this world without peace...""""Stop lying!"" Colsen's expression turned harsh. He glared at me and said coldly, ""You're heartless enough to curse your own child? Kiara was always healthy. There's no way she froze to death! You're just trying to run away!""But that night, the temperature was -20¬∞C. Kiara was only seven. How could she survive that kind of torment?""Colsen, I'm not making anything up. I can prove it with this death certificate..."" My hands were shaking as I pulled the document from inside my clothes.Astrid gave a cold laugh. ""Elsie, where did you get that fake certificate from? My friend got one made for two dollars, but yours looks way more convincing.""""You're terrible, Elsie!"" Colsen shouted, his face full of fury. He ripped the certificate from my hand and threw it at me.""You really faked something like this just to trick me? I'm warning you, my patience is running out! Keep this up, and Astrid will replace you as my wife for sure! All the family's money will go to her twins!""The sharp paper scraped across my face, cutting my skin and drawing blood.A wave of despair washed over me.Just then, a sudden clatter came from Kiara's room next door, followed by a strong scent of smoke.My heart tightened in alarm. ""What's going on out there?""Chapter 4‚Äã‚ÄãAstrid crossed her arms and spoke with tears in her voice, ""Elsie, Rafael, and Brian really like Kiara's room. Colsen said he'd clear out all of Kiara's stuff so they could move in. He also said she had too many useless toys, and the storage room couldn't fit them. So he told the nanny to burn everything.""""What are you saying..."" I gasped, completely stunned.I ran outside and shouted, ""Stop! Don't touch her things! Don't burn them!""Colsen's face turned cold as he shouted, ""Enough! Elsie, don't you get it? Letting Kiara keep all this junk will destroy her future! This is your fault! You spoiled her. Myla, burn everything!""""No, you can't do that..."" I rushed forward, trying to stop them, but Colsen yanked me back, holding me still.Astrid pretended to comfort me. ""Elsie, please trust Colsen. He only wants what's best for the kids.""In the end, all I could do was stand there, watching helplessly as Kiara's most beloved toys were swallowed by flames‚Äîreduced to ashes before my eyes. The fire roared, lighting up the room in a blaze of red, and all I could see was the burn in my eyes.I collapsed to my knees beside the ashes, sobbing.""I'm so sorry, Kiara. It's all my fault.""I couldn't keep you safe, and I couldn't protect your things either.""I'm a terrible mother.""Then I was locked up again. No matter how many times I banged on the door or pleaded, Colsen wouldn't let me out.I didn't eat or drink for three days. I just lay there, weak and crying for Kiara. The pain in my chest was endless, unbearable.On the third day, it was the twins' third birthday. Colsen threw them a grand, extravagant party.The sound of music and laughter downstairs made my pain feel even worse.As I sat in silence, the door burst open with a loud bang. Astrid came in with the twins.""Elsie, I brought you some cake,"" she said, proudly holding a plate of exquisite small cakes. ""Colsen made them himself! Can you believe it? A man who's never stepped foot in the kitchen actually baked for his kids. He dotes on the twins so much. Elsie, I bet you and your daughter never got to eat anything homemade by Colsen, right? What a shame, too bad your little girl never will...""I was so furious that I jumped up and smacked the plate right out of her hands. The white cream splattered all over Astrid's clothes.Her face turned red with rage as she raised her hand and slapped me across the face. ""Elsie, what are you even proud of? Do you still think you're the dignified Mrs. Breslin? Let me tell you, those days are over!""Then, all of a sudden, she shoved her younger son, Brian Breslin, with force.Brian lost his balance and toppled backward, hitting his head on the edge of the coffee table. Blood began to stream from the back of his head.He wailed in pain, his cries echoing through the room.Colsen rushed in, alarmed by the noise. ""Astrid, what's going on in here?""Astrid looked terrified as she held the injured Brian close, crying. ""Colsen, Brian was just trying to be kind. He brought Elsie a piece of cake. She didn't want it, fine. But she actually pushed him! Brian hit his head and now he's bleeding... My poor boy, what did he ever do to deserve this?""Her eldest son, Rafael Breslin, chimed in quickly, ""Daddy, that bad woman is so evil! She called Mommy a vile woman, threw her cake, and pushed Brian! She's so mean, you have to punish her for what she did!""""Elsie!"" Colsen's eyes darkened with fury as he suddenly raised his hand and struck me across the face.He grabbed me by the neck and shoved me hard against the edge of the window, his expression twisted with rage, eyes nearly blazing. ""Elsie, Astrid has always been gentle and always puts up with you. Why do you keep crossing the line? Looks like I've let you off too easily. That's why you act so full of yourself!""Apologize to Astrid. Right now!""My face burned, and it was getting hard to breathe. I felt like I was suffocating. But even then, I forced out a reply, ""I'll never... apologize!""""You won't learn your lesson until it's too late, huh?"" Colsen growled, his voice low and threatening. His teeth were clenched as he glared at me. ""If you don't apologize to Astrid, I'll throw you out this window. Are you scared now?""I laughed. Soft, bitter, unhinged.After being married for a decade and sticking together through so many ups and downs, this is how it ends.What a terrible ending.""You don't have to do it."" I whispered, my lips trembling.""I'll jump on my own.""",1,1753776937.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Astrid came in with the twins.""Elsie, I brought you some cake,"" she said, proudly holding a plate of exquisite small cakes. ""Colsen made them himself! Can you believe it? A man who's never stepped foot in the kitchen actually baked for his kids. He dotes on the twins so much. Elsie, I bet you and your daughter never got to eat anything homemade by Colsen, right? What a shame, too bad your little girl never will...""I was so furious that I jumped up and smacked the plate right out of her hands. The white cream splattered all over Astrid's clothes.Her face turned red with rage as she raised her hand and slapped me across the face. ""Elsie, what are you even proud of? Do you still think you're the dignified Mrs. Breslin? Let me tell you, those days are over!""Then, all of a sudden, she shoved her younger son, Brian Breslin, with force.Brian lost his balance and toppled backward, hitting his head on the edge of the coffee table. Blood began to stream from the back of his head.He wailed in pain, his cries echoing through the room.Colsen rushed in, alarmed by the noise. ""Astrid, what's going on in here?""Astrid looked terrified as she held the injured Brian close, crying. ""Colsen, Brian was just trying to be kind. He brought Elsie a piece of cake. She didn't want it, fine. But she actually pushed him! Brian hit his head and now he's bleeding... My poor boy, what did he ever do to deserve this?""Her eldest son, Rafael Breslin, chimed in quickly, ""Daddy, that bad woman is so evil! She called Mommy a vile woman, threw her cake, and pushed Brian! She's so mean, you have to punish her for what she did!""""Elsie!"" Colsen's eyes darkened with fury as he suddenly raised his hand and struck me across the face.He grabbed me by the neck and shoved me hard against the edge of the window, his expression twisted with rage, eyes nearly blazing. ""Elsie, Astrid has always been gentle and always puts up with you. Why do you keep crossing the line? Looks like I've let you off too easily. That's why you act so full of yourself!""Apologize to Astrid. Right now!""My face burned, and it was getting hard to breathe. I felt like I was suffocating. But even then, I forced out a reply, ""I'll never... apologize!""""You won't learn your lesson until it's too late, huh?"" Colsen growled, his voice low and threatening. His teeth were clenched as he glared at me. ""If you don't apologize to Astrid, I'll throw you out this window. Are you scared now?""I laughed. Soft, bitter, unhinged.After being married for a decade and sticking together through so many ups and downs, this is how it ends.What a terrible ending.""You don't have to do it."" I whispered, my lips trembling.""I'll jump on my own.""

I want to make an app that helps you find and connect with local people to become friends (go for a morning walk, grab tea/coffee with like-minded individual, watch a movie, hit the gym, play badminton/chess etc)","I analyzed over 100 Reddit posts across various Pakistani social subreddits and observed a pattern in their common problems. I want to make an app for that. I want to validate that app idea before development, really looking for you guys to post your thoughts. It‚Äôs not a dating app, I promise! Men will only find men, and women will only see women. Common problems I want to solve:  


\-Moved to a new city and need someone to talk to or meet in person  
\-Looking for like-minded person for morning walks or casual hangouts (No-Dating)  
\-Want to attend a nearby event (MMA, Tekken, Chess tournament, Book Fair) but no friends share that interest.  
\-Need a gym partner to go to a local gym together.  
\-Seeking a local cat lover/gamer/book lover  
\-Looking for a local neighbor to play badminton/chess/cards, etc

Here‚Äôs how the app would work: You post a simple request like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm up for a walk‚Äù or ‚ÄúAnyone want to play chess?‚Äù and people within 50km who share your interests will see it. You‚Äôll also get a feed of what others nearby are up for. And if you prefer, you can post anonymously too.

Think of it like a friend-focused version of Bumble or Tinder, but with a twist. I know Bumble has a BFF mode, but it‚Äôs not active in Pakistan. And even then, this idea is a bit different. Instead of just browsing profiles and figuring out what to do after matching (like on BFF), here people post what they actually want to do, like ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hit the local snooker or Tekken club,‚Äù and others with shared interests can join in.

Let's try to answer some questions you have in your mind:

Q: Why not just talk with someone locally?  
A: Many people are introverted and feel more comfortable starting online before meeting in person. For example, if I go to the local gym, then I will not ask anyone if I want to be a gym partner with you. I'm more comfortable putting that request in some app, and let's see who wants to join.

Q: Why not use existing social Reddit communities like those for Karachi and Islamabad??  
A: Those lack precise GPS‚Äëbased proximity filters. Also, it lacks interest-based feeds/matching.

Q: How will you keep it secure?  
A: We‚Äôll include safety prompts, encourage public meeting spots, and follow proven best practices similar to OLX or Tinder (but strictly for friendship).

Q: How would the app know that a person is a woman/ man?  
A: I hope that the problem is already solved by Tinder/Bumble or other dating apps. Maybe we do ID verification.

There are some apps already there, but not operating in Pakistan like ""Bumble-For-Friends"", ""GoFriendly"", etc.

I want to validate this mobile app idea and would really appreciate your thoughts. Would you use an app like this? Why or why not? What features would make it feel safe and useful for you? Have you tried anything similar before? What worked and what didn‚Äôt? Your feedback could help shape something truly helpful for people feeling disconnected or new in town.",2,1753776556.0,pakistan,3,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

the selection of a high-quality coffee hat involves considerations beyond just its aesthetic appeal. Several essential features define its efficacy in retaining the warmth and ensuring the safety of your coffee.

**Insulation Material:** The insulation material plays a critical role in maintaining the coffee's temperature. Many top-performing coffee hats utilize multiple layers of high-density, closed-cell foam, typically a type of neoprene or a similar synthetic rubber.

The best materials offer extraordinary thermal resistance, minimizing heat loss and ensuring your coffee stays warmer for longer. Some coffee hats incorporate a reflective layer, usually made of aluminum or a similar material, to further enhance insulation by reflecting radiant heat back towards the beverage container. Furthermore,the ideal insulation should not only be effective but also lightweight and flexible,allowing the hat to conform snugly to various container shapes without adding unnecessary bulk or weight.

**Closure system:** The closure system is crucial for securing the coffee hat around the container and preventing heat from escaping. Many coffee hats feature a combination of hook-and-loop fasteners (Velcro), zippers, and elastic bands to ensure a snug and adjustable fit.

Hook-and-loop fasteners offer excellent adjustability, allowing users to tighten or loosen the hat according to the size of their container. Zippers provide a more secure closure, especially around the top of the container, and help to minimize heat loss through gaps. Elastic bands contribute to a flexible fit, accommodating slight variations in container diameter. A well-designed closure system should be easy to operate even with gloved hands and should maintain its integrity over repeated use.

**Water Resistance:** Given that coffee hats are ofen used in outdoor settings, water resistance is an important consideration. Most quality coffee hats are constructed from water-resistant or water-repellent materials, preventing moisture from penetrating the insulation and compromising its performance.

These materials typically feature a durable water repellent (DWR) coating that causes water to bead up and roll off the surface, rather than soaking into the fabric. While not fully waterproof, this level of water resistance is sufficient to protect the coffee from light rain or splashes. Additionally, water-resistant materials help to keep the insulation dry, which is essential for maintaining its thermal properties.

**Compatibility and Size Options:** Coffee hats come in various sizes and designs to accommodate different container shapes and sizes. The best coffee hats offer a range of size options to ensure a secure and snug fit for a variety of cups, mugs, and even small thermoses.

Some models feature adjustable straps or elastic closures that allow them to adapt to containers of varying diameters. It's important to check the product specifications to ensure that the coffee hat is compatible with your preferred coffee container. Consider factors such as the height and diameter of the container, as well as any unique features like handles or spouts.

Key features of a top-tier coffee hat include:

* High-quality insulation material
* Secure and adjustable closure system
* Water resistance for outdoor use
* Compatibility with various container sizes

## Core Benefits

A good coffee hat provides many advantages over traditional methods of carrying and keeping coffee warm. They centre around improved convenience, extended warmth, and enhanced portability.

**Extended Warmth Retention:** The primary benefit of using a coffee hat is its ability to keep coffee warm for an extended period. Insulated with high-quality materials and employing effective closure systems, these hats minimize heat loss and maintain an enjoyable temperature for hours.

This means you can savor your coffee at your own pace without worrying about it cooling down too quickly, which is especially valuable during outdoor activities or long commutes. Users frequently enough report a noticeable difference in coffee temperature compared to leaving the cup exposed to ambient air, especially in colder climates. This translates to a more satisfying and enjoyable coffee-drinking experience.

**Enhanced Portability:** coffee hats are designed to be lightweight and easily portable, making them an ideal companion for outdoor adventures. Unlike bulky insulated mugs or thermoses, they add minimal weight and can be easily attached to a backpack or belt loop using a carabiner or clip.This makes them perfect for hiking, camping, picnics, or any situation where you want to enjoy a hot beverage without the burden of carrying heavy containers.Moreover,They can be easily stored in a bag or pocket when not in use,further enhancing their portability.

**Reduced Condensation and Spills:** In addition to keeping coffee warm, some coffee hats help to minimize condensation and prevent spills. the snug fit around the cup reduces the exposure of the coffee to the air, minimizing condensation buildup on the outside of the container.

Some models feature absorbent inner linings that soak up any accidental spills or drips, keeping your hands and belongings clean.This makes them a cleaner and more convenient option compared to open cups or poorly sealed travel mugs, particularly when navigating bumpy terrain or crowded spaces.**Sustainability and Reusability:** By reducing the need for disposable coffee cups or single-use plastic lids, coffee hats contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle. Reusing the same coffee hat repeatedly helps to minimize waste and reduce your environmental footprint.

Many are made from durable, washable materials that can withstand repeated use and cleaning, making them a long-lasting and eco-pleasant alternative to disposable options. This aligns with the growing consumer demand for sustainable and environmentally responsible products.

Core benefits of using a coffee hat include:

* Extended warmth retention for sustained enjoyment
* Enhanced portability for outdoor adventures
* Reduced condensation and spills for cleaner use
* Sustainability and reusability for eco-conscious consumers

## FAQs Section

Consumers often have specific questions about the practicalities of using and caring for a coffee hat. Here are some common inquiries.

**How Effective Are Coffee Hats in Cold Weather?**
Coffee hats are noticeably effective in cold weather, significantly slowing down the rate at which your coffee cools. They won't keep your coffee piping hot indefinitely,but they will provide a noticeable improvement compared to leaving an uncovered cup exposed to the elements. Exact performance will vary depending on the ambient temperature and the insulation quality of the hat.

**Can I Use a Coffee Hat with Different Sized Cups?**
Most coffee hats are designed with some degree of flexibility and adjustability to accommodate a range of cup sizes. Look for models with adjustable straps or elastic closures to ensure a snug fit. However, it's always a good idea to check the product specifications to ensure compatibility with your specific cup size.

**how Do I Clean a Coffee hat?**
Cleaning a coffee hat is generally straightforward.Most can be hand-washed with mild soap and water. Avoid harsh detergents or bleach, which can damage the insulation material or the outer fabric. Allow the hat to air dry entirely before storing it to prevent the growth of mold or mildew. Check the manufacturer's instructions for specific cleaning recommendations.

**Are Coffee Hats Suitable for all Types of Hot Beverages?**
While primarily designed for coffee, coffee hats can be used with other hot beverages such as tea, hot chocolate, or even soup.The primary function is to insulate the container and maintain its temperature, regardless of the contents. Though, it's critically important to ensure that the hat is compatible with the size and shape of the container you are using.

I used to get a bit of chugging when floors were being built, but now putting down a large area of flooring (> 50 tiles) causes the game to freeze for a few seconds every 10-15 seconds, and smaller amounts of construction still cost 10-20 frames.

I recently started brewing with a V60 and have been following James Hoffmann‚Äôs ‚ÄúBetter One Cup V60‚Äù recipe (the 5 pour method).     
      
However, I‚Äôve been getting long drawdown times, typically around 3:30 to 4:00 minutes.   
       
Suggestions online are either lesser no of pours so that the 250gm mark reaches at like 1:10, 1:20 and the drawdown is done by 2:30,     
(With 5 pours it takes around 2min to be done with the final 50gm pour.)      
This does bring the time down but the stalling when the water is left just enough for the coffee grounds/bed to be visible, still remains.    
     
The other suggestion is to go coarse, but i am already at 21 clicks on my c2.   
At 23-25 the ground is big enough for a French press.

The store brings together hundreds of types of robots and supporting components, with leading robotics companies from Shenzhen and across China setting up displays.  

A key question on-site was: ""What exactly is a robot 6S store?"" Lin Feng, CEO of Shenzhen Future Times Robot Co., Ltd. and manager of the 6S store, explained that it builds on the traditional automotive 4S model‚Äîcomprising Sales, Spare parts, Service, and Survey‚Äîby adding two new functions: Lease and Customized services, creating a unique ""6S"" model.  

For instance, Leju Robotics' humanoid robots can assist the elderly with medication and remind them of daily routines; Yun Shenchu's robotic dogs can enter hazardous environments for rescue and detection; and Zhuji Dynamics' robots can precisely transport heavy objects in factories. Products showcased by various companies covered fields such as home services, medical assistance, industrial inspection, and educational companionship. On-site data revealed that over 200 upstream and downstream companies in the industry chain have expressed interest in joining, including nearly 50 humanoid and service robot firms, spanning the entire industrial chain from core component R&D to real-world applications.  

Aligned with the robotics industry's characteristics, the store will establish a real-time data feedback mechanism to accurately collect user needs and inform R&D. It also offers leasing services, allowing users to experience robots without purchasing them. ""In the past, people could only 'view' robots from afar in short videos or science museums. Now, through the 6S store, they can 'get up close' and even 'use them daily,'"" said Lin Feng.  

At the event, seven domestic robotics companies‚ÄîUnitree Robotics, Leju Robotics, Digital Huaxia, Zhongqing Robotics, Yun Shenchu Technology, Zhuji Dynamics, and Lingsi Intelligence‚Äîshowcased their products in a parade. Street performances featured robots dancing, making ice cream, and cooking jianbing (Chinese crepes), demonstrating their versatility and drawing crowds of onlookers.  

""In the robot 6S store, you could assemble robot parts in just half an hour, much like building a PC, or rent one for as little as 1,000 yuan,"" said Zhao Bingbing, Director of the Longgang District Artificial Intelligence (Robotics) Office.  

The store includes a ""Robot Parts Supermarket,"" stocking core components like servo motors and reducers to meet mainstream repair needs, enabling quick response and on-the-spot maintenance.  

""Centered around the 6S store, Longgang District is developing a robotics-themed block within a one-square-kilometer radius.

Something weird happened recently. One of my office friends randomly mentioned during a call that he had been to Malaysia. Curious, I asked why, and he said it was a work trip related to a startup he's involved with. I casually told him to let me know if there are similar opportunities since I'm looking to change my company. A week later, he called back saying, ‚ÄúIt was actually open for you, if you‚Äôre serious about earning an extra income.‚Äù Sounded like a legit startup thing, so I said okay.

He said I‚Äôd get a call from his ‚Äúsenior.‚Äù That guy called, asked about my background, and said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs meet, these things can‚Äôt be explained properly over the phone.‚Äù I agreed. But I fell sick and went home for two weeks. After coming back to Hyderabad, I told a friend about it and he immediately said, ‚ÄúBro, this is a scam. They contacted me too. I backed out because of the money they ask for.‚Äù That‚Äôs when I connected the dots. These guys never reveal the business upfront unless you say you‚Äôre ready to invest. I Googled about it, found similar scam reports, and decided to go to the meeting just to see what happens.

We met at caf√©. I asked if I could bring a friend who's interested  and my office friend was like, ‚ÄúNo bro, this is exclusive for you.‚Äù Huge red flag. At the caf√©, he hyped up his ‚Äúsenior‚Äù  said he‚Äôs from NIT, now working as an SDE in a top MNC. That guy arrived and started asking about my family, hobbies, interests very friendly chat. Then he says, ‚ÄúMy senior, who‚Äôs like the ChatGPT of this business,‚Äù is on his way. I nearly laughed out loud but stayed serious. Meanwhile, he flexed that my friend also have businesses in all metro cities, Singapore, Malaysia, and that the company is registered under his name. üòí

Then comes the ‚Äúsenior‚Äôs senior.‚Äù Super dramatic entry. Acting busy, constantly on calls, and when he finally sits, he says, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll need to invest ‚Çπ5.5 lakhs.‚Äù Before that, he starts warming me up with nonsense like, ‚ÄúEven your job today is the result of an investment in education. Without investing, no one earns.‚Äù I asked him what kind of business it is so I could talk to my dad. His reply? ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell your parents, they‚Äôll ask questions you can‚Äôt answer. They just want to keep you safe.‚Äù Then he suggested I take a loan even borrow from local lenders and gave an insane example: someone who took a 36% interest loan from goons, and now owns 16‚Äì18 plots in Dubai and drives a Maserati. ü§°

He even made a ‚Äúplan‚Äù for me: invest ‚Çπ4.7L, keep ‚Çπ80K to pay EMIs for 5‚Äì6 months, and earn ‚Çπ50K/month from their ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù to cover it. I again asked, ‚ÄúWhat is this business exactly?‚Äù and he said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no point telling you unless you‚Äôre ready to invest.‚Äù At that point, I knew it was all BS. I told them I‚Äôd think about it, drank my cappuccino (the only ROI from that meeting), and left.

Out of curiosity, I later called my office friend and asked if they have a website or any official documentation since they claim to be running businesses internationally. His reply? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs confidential, bro. We can‚Äôt share anything unless you‚Äôre ready.‚Äù I pushed a bit and he said, ‚ÄúIf you're seriously interested, I‚Äôll schedule another meetup.‚Äù That was the final nail. No transparency, no website, no docs just sketchy meetups and manipulation.

TL;DR: If someone hypes up a secret ‚Äúbusiness opportunity‚Äù but won‚Äôt tell you what it is unless you invest ‚Çπ5+ lakhs, it‚Äôs probably a scam. Don‚Äôt fall for the drama, fake success stories, and emotional manipulation. Stay sharp.

Feels like history repeating itself.,"My daughter is 4 years old and we‚Äôre about to start the assessment process for her. I suspect Autism and have noticed the following: struggles with transitions, groups pencils and textas together in colours, hyper focus on special interests, less attention for tasks she doesn‚Äôt enjoy, clumsiness and body in space awareness, sensitive to hot/cold, eats only beige foods, highly empathetic, strong sense of justice and right and wrong, imaginative play is off the charts, articulate, prefers non fiction books - preferably about dinosaurs or space, particular about clothes, the list goes on.
Her kinder teacher has told us that my daughter is a delight, well behaved, energetic and matter of fact. There are zero concerns. The teacher says she is school ready and there are zero issues of concern. 
When we raised some of the issues we are seeing the teacher said that we ought to use tv as a reward for getting ready in the morning and that if we make home so wonderful then of course our daughter wouldn‚Äôt want to leave home - this is off the back of us telling the teacher that part of our morning routine is to all have a coffee (husband and I) and a hot chocolate (2 x daughters) in bed altogether every morning. It is the best part of my day and is a ritual we‚Äôve fought hard to protect for as long as our girls are wanting that closeness and connection.
I‚Äôm offended. Disappointed. Feeling unseen. I just got told to make home more horrible and be clearer on routines and rewards. Like that will fix everything! 
The comment about my daughter being ‚Äúwell behaved‚Äù echoes my own childhood. Always a delight in the classroom and no issues reported. While inside I was hurting. My daughter is obsessively picking her face and ears until they bleed as some sort of coping, stimming, compulsion. But according to the teacher there are no concerns and they are seeing none of the behaviours we are. Makes me feel gaslit and uncertain and this is just the start of our journey. I‚Äôm feeling so defeated already, I get the sense that the next 12 years of my daughter‚Äôs education is going to have to be me doggedly advocating for her and people dismissing my concerns. 
And it feels like a repeat of my last few years of fighting so hard to be diagnosed.

1mc561w,https://www.reddit.com/r/SchizoFamilies/comments/1mc561w/intense_guilt_over_mentally_ill_mom/,Intense guilt over mentally ill mom,"Sorry for the long post, but I have to give background info.

 I (24f) lways had a weird, toxic, but at the same time VERY close relationship with my mom (50f). We have a lot of trauma bonds. I was her ""therapist"" since I was about 5 years old. She always hated my fathers side of the family, for literally no reason. She just always felt like they hated her. I grew up listening to her describing how that side of my family is horrible, all the while I loved being with them. As a result I got this weird rift in me, because I was  a child and I believed her, but I still loved my dad and his side of the family. It also completely fucked up my self image growing up, because I was led to believe I had some kind of ""bad blood"" in me. She was still with my dad, but refused visit his family since 2012.

 In the last 5 years she changed completely. In 2020 out of nowhere she accused my dad of cheating and wanted to separate. She had 0 evidence. My poor dad was devastated. I didn't necessarily believe her, but years of her conditioning made me vulnerable. We moved away from dad. Soon she began acting really paranoid about everything. She started saying people were coming into our new apartment, so she started locking the door with a bike lock. She started saying spices were going missing. That her phone is being hacked. That her clothes are getting new holes every day. She said a lot more, but I can't remember every single thing she was paranoid about. I never noticed anything, and when I tried to calm her she was alway very defensive about it. She never had actual proof, but I tried to be ""on her side""

 In 2023 she moved out and my partner moved in with me. Ever since she's living alone these ""happenings"" started to ramp up. She bought a camera for EVERY room in her flat, but still claimed money was going missing overnight. She claimed there's a secret tunnel from undergorund that goes into her bathroom. When her erderly cat got sick she called her brother and accused him of giving antifreeze to the cat. At this point I finally had to come to terms with the fact, that she has a serious mental illness.

Around 2024 she cut off everybody she still had, except me and my partner. She said everybody is paid to be ""after her"" even her family, and somebody wanted to ruin her life. This somebody kept changing. Recently she claimed one of my dads childhood ex is behind all of this. Everything she told me started to put a huge toll on my mental wellbeing too. Me and my partner tried to help her with everything. We factory reset her phone and laptop many times, I searched for spy cameras with her, We tried to fix any IT related issues and suspicions she had. I tried to listen and be understanding. I didn't know how else to help her. I was getting really burnt out.

This year in march she started to accuse my partner and her family. Then one saturday morning she called and finally accused me of playing with her cameras. (I have access to them because I set them up for her and she wanted me to have access too.) At that point something broke in me. We barely texted in the last 6 months, my mental health was never this bad. I had a lot of time to reflect, and I realized she ruined my family (and probably my childhood) because of her mental illness. I have a lot of anger in me towards her, but I still really love and miss her. I want her to get help, but she absolutely refuses, she doesn't think anything is wrong with her.

A few days ago she texted me saying we should meet up for coffee. Today I told her my true feelings. I told her I didn't really wanna meet her, and that our distance is a bad but necessary thing for my mental health. I told her I loved her dearly, but I can only text from now on. 
She anwsered calmly. I felt very deep sorrow in her messages, but she said she loved me too, and that when Im ready ""she will be waiting for me."" She said she wanted to take her things that are still in our apartment.
 These messages really feel like a knife to the heart. I didn't think it would still hurt this bad after 6 months of almost no contact. Tbh I hoped she would just be angry at me and cuss me out. This feels like a breakup. Im in so much pain and I feel like I made a huge mistake. I feel so selfish. 
It's even worse because I know she's mentally ill, undiagnosed and unmedicated. Im really worried about her. I wish my country had 5150 like in the US.

I feel like I can't cope with this, and that everything is my fault. It feels like I committed a crime.

You know those moive where there's a gas station in the middle of no where in a desert, well think of that but instead its a restaurant but everyone working there is sadistic or either borderline mental dumb along with the other customers. Oh and every chicken item they serve is cold and soggy, ill get more into that later. Well think of that but your car runs out of gas and the only place to stay is a restaurant.    
Me and my friends where going see my friends Zachary(Zach for short) grandma Myrtle. Me along with my other friends Christine and her boyfriend Cody. Me and Cody used to be friends all throughout middle school but ever since he started dating Christine we got in touch again. The trip was pretty far, along 8 to 11 hours depending on how much traffic we'll have once we leave town but we where still as eager to go, even if we never meet the old lady before. I packed my orange bag and throwed it in the middle seat where me and Cody will be sitting next to, well at least for the fisrt 2 hours into the drive before we switched spots. ""Dude, why the fuck is your bag bright orange?"" Cody said while struggling to pull his jammed seat belt out ""I dont know its just what i had"" ""dude, orange is like the worst color, you should of at least picked a girls color like purple instead."" Now that I think about it i see why we lost touch in the 7th grade. ""Alrighty crew lests get this show on the road"" Zach said while starting the engine. Zach was the type of guy who had that energetic energy all the time no matter the time which is great if you think about it but try dealing with it when your pissed of and he goes ""uh oh, looks like someone should turn that frown upside down"". so far into our trip nothing really happened other than me having to go make a quick stop to throw up in a 76 stations bathroom from getting car sick. Listen, im a big guy and when I heard that this ride was going be around 10 hours you bet I was eating along the way. Turns out eating alot while being in a hot car all day really messes with your stomach. As I stepped out my friends where getting gas and buying a few snacks, just a few incase they ended up like me. As we got out we decided who should stay in the front and back. ""Can I be in the back this time, i been in the front twice"" Christine said ""ya, lemme chill with my bae in the back will ya?"" ""Sure Cody thats fine. You fine with being in shotgun with me Tyler?"" Zach asked while doing air punches ""C'mon, just 2 bruts cruising around the airizona desert through Texas"" ""ya sure. Hey why did your parents move to Texas anyway"" ""well thats simple, America is the land of the free and its and hot as Australia"" ""makes sense I guess"" Zach got into his driver seat while I had to adjust my seat just so I could get the seat belt around myself, like I said earlier, I was a big guy. Around 4 hours later and it was already 7pm and already super dark out. Everything was going fine until suddenly. ""aw shit, your fucking joking"" Zach said in a more serious tone than he usually has. I was about to ask what's wrong until I heard the beeping from the car. We where out of gas. ""Hey Cody, how much did you fill this tank up?"" ""I thought you where pumping the gas"" Zach took a deep breath and sighed as the car went slower until it hualted to a stop ""I told you to fill up the tank, its why I gived you my wallet"" ""wait you gived me your wallet? when?"" I could feel the heat starting to admit from zach but he quickly calmed his cool ""its... its fine, there looked like a restaurant we passed 5 minutes ago, we can just walk there and see if they can help us. The lights are still on, I'm assuming its still open"" they didn't look forward towards walking but not as much as me but we where all pretty hungry anyway so might as well get something to eat. Just like Zachary said, 5 minutes later we where greeted with a old baby blue fast food joint that looked like it was from the 50s and in good shape too. As we walked in we all immediately saw the cashier who's desk was in the very back facing the entrance but thats not what caught our attention. It was the pale, fat, greasy man with a few hairs on the top oh his balding head while the rest cover up the back of his back neck sitting in one of the booths. He was wearing a brown suit with his sleeves drenched with what I thought at the time was sweat or maybe spilled soda but as we all saw him grab another chicken leg and bite into it we could see around a quart of water spill out of it and onto the table, dripping onto the floor. After that we knew why he looked so sweaty and wet. None of us are rude people, well maybe apart from Cody but we didn't wanna seem rude and make fun of this man or make him feel gross, which he was. Who knows, maybe he was a good guy, maybe he had a disability. Whatever it was we didn't want to judge so we walked up to the counter and asked if maybe they knew a gas station near by or if they could help or if they had any spear gas. The man working there seemed to of just gotten out of high-school and needed a job. ""Nah. The nearest gas is 2 hours away on car"" I could see all sign of hope loosing in zachs face ""well is there anything we can do"" Christine said ""I don't know i just work here. Would you like anything to eat or drink"" almost all of us sighed as this emotionless teen spoke to us ""yeah, yeah sure we'll get something. Might as well. What do you serve here"" ""here lady here's the menu, there's 4 at every table if anyone cares"" he sat us to our seats before being shoved to the side and thats when the fisrt one of those waiters showed up. Man looked Michael Jackson pale and not as grayish as the old man eating chicken who was still eating by the way. He had super blue pale eyes with his eye whites being a hint of yellow in them but looked way to young have anything wrong with him. He quickly sliked back a strand of purple hair back with one white pasty finger and gave us all new menus. The cashier walked away and mumbled something to himself but I still heard what he said 'ok then fucking dick, just take my tips ass hole'. Soon as he left the waiter spoke ""well what can I do for you all, would you like to try our new homemade milkshakes?"" ""Oh yes please, do you have vanilla?"" Christine asked politely which made me wonder how such a sweet person like herself fell for Cody in the fisrt place. ""While of course we have vanilla lil darling, would the rest of yall like something else to drink?"" Zach ordered a low caf coffee while me and Cody both got a cup and headed to the soda dispenser. ""Fuck ya they got root beer"" I wacthed him put his cup up to the dispenser and saw a light blue fluid come out ""yo what the fuck"" hey immediately stop filling his cup and examines it before taking a sip. ""dude is this fucking mouthwash and vanilla?"" If you asked me root beer always tastes like that but seeing the blue fluid i wondered if it actually was mouthwash. Cody quickly turn around to yell at either of the workers but they both weren't there, even the old man started sleeping face fisrt on his table, making small bubbles with the chicken water from snoring. ""Where'd the fuck they go, he didn't even take my fucking order dude"" at this point I just wanted to eat something and just pass out in Zacharys car so I just got a diet Pepsi and headed back. I had enough with codys constant swears and audited. Shortly after the waiter came back with their drinks and Christines burger and frys.
""And would you like anything sir?"" He asked me politely ""Oh yeah, um, ill just have a bacon cheese burger along with frys"" ""mighty fine choice their fella, be right with ya"" he said before turning around and meeting Cody. ""Oh, and you?"" ""Ya man why the fuck is there mouthwash in with your soda dude?"" The waiters smile slowly falls ""get your sweet behind back before I teach you a thing or two about manors."" He said as almost as if he was whispering to him. All of us where a bit stunned after that. Before we could even do anything he rushed to the kitchen doors and closed them behind him before hearing a faint sound as what sounded like a key locking a door. I quickly turned to Cody who was turning red and clinching his fistt before both Christine and Zach both calm him down. ""dude, if he fucking does anything else than thats it alright, sorry."" He quickly sat down next to Christine and looked through the menu again trying clear his mind. Shortly after the purple vested and hair waiter was returning with my plate ""oh my my, I hope you sure have the guts to eat all of this, all of it"". I quickly got ready to unhinged my jaw like a python getting ready to swallow a small pig in the Amazon until I actually saw what I ordered. Ill go from top to bottom. The sesame seeds where the size as a sunflower seed. The buns where a dark brown like a dark oak, the 2 bacon strips at the top where the size as my forearm and where stiff as a plank of wood. The cheese was a pale orange that looked cold. The burger patty looked like it was just cooked on straight coals. For whatever reason there was lettuce that looked like a teal Lilly pad. The bottom burger patty was still sizzling with small sparks of grease flying everywhere. The last of the bacon was twice the size of the fisrt and where stiff until half way they go limp followed last with a bottom bun which looked like a pice of paper from all the weight being put on it. After that he handed me syrup of all things and finally a fresh bottle of ketchup whiched honestly looked better than the entire burger. Before I could say anything Cody said ""yo, are you going ask me for my order?"" ""Hmm, did I hear something... oh, there'll be a waiter for you shortly"" Christine had to hold him down by the arm sleeve so he didn't jump out of his seat. The waiter who now ill be referring to as Fred left again into the kitchen doors and the key locking noise soon followed. ""Jesus fucking christ man... Hey can I have some fries babe"" he said before grabbing some himself and dipped one in her small pacth of ketchup. ""Hey Tyler, you sure you got what you order?"" He chuckles while taking a bite out of the half of the fry before pulling back his head before his smile vanished and replaced with a confused grin. He looked down and saw a long red hair contented to the fry to his lips before quickly spitting it out onto the floor beside the table. ""DUDE WHAT THE HELL"" Zach had enough of Cody as it was today so he just kept sipping his coffee while enjoying the show of Cody crashing out. Christine grabbed another fry and snapped it in half revealing another long red hair. She was eating the frys whole and never noticed until now i guessed. I could tell that she wanted to cry right there and then. ""Ok man where the fuck is that waiter im about to give him a one of theses"" he said while quickly flexing his honestly small bicep through his hoodie. Not before long the kitchen doors swung open and a waiter came out. It didn't take long for Cody to realize thats its the difference waiter Fred had sent out for him. ""Oh finally, somebody else. about ti-"" he quickly went wide eyed as he noticed something about (Ted) the second waiter. He wore a bright red vest, along with long curry red hair. Ted chuckled ""Huck huck huck! Well howdy sir! Can I help you?"" Cody quickly picked up 2 and 2 and figured this was the guy who had putted hair in all of the frys. The fact he sounded like a knock off version of Goofy didn't help him from loosing it. ""Hey man you think your fucking funny?"" Zach almost jumped in his seat and seemed sketched out ""wait fellas... was there always this amount of people?"" We all looked and saw just how many people were here. Every seat was taken and filled with loud talking and plates clanking against each other. the old man before was tip toeing to the front door with a briefcase like a bandit from one of those old cartoons. The amount of horrific food I saw them eating made me want to stop staring and just be great full for what I ordered. Hell I even took a bite. And it honestly tasted pretty good until I pulled the burger back and felt a wet patty slip onto my chin being held up from my teeth. Odd, I didn't see a third patty, and I even saw that it wasn't the lettuce. I looked and Zach is staring at me with a pale white face and his eyes wide open looking in shock and absolute horror as if he just saw his family get skinned alive. Before I could even ask i had to finish eating so I chewed a bit more, swallowed a bit, and took off the patty hugging my chin. When I felt it it didn't feel like a beef patty, bacoon, cheese or any type of leafy material. When I looked down I too become pale as a ghost. What I have bitten out of my burger was a raw, cold, human ear.

1mc55l0,https://v.redd.it/t2lot52pnrff1,How I stopped wasting 3hrs daily on data analysis (and you can do the same),"Guys, I need to share this because it completely changed my workflow.

Until a few months ago, I was that marketer who spent half the day in Excel trying to make sense of campaign data. You know that feeling? 

Exporting data from 5 different platforms, making pivot tables, trying to find insights you knew were there but couldn't extract quickly...

**My routine before:**

* 8:30 AM: Coffee and opening Excel
* 9:00 AM-12:00 PM: Data export, cleanup, charts
* 12:00 PM-1:00 PM: Lunch (thinking about the data)
* 1:00 PM-3:00 PM: More analysis and insight attempts
* 3:00 PM: Finally starting the ""creative"" work

**What annoyed me most:**

* Knowing the insight was right there, but taking hours to get to it
* Doing manual analysis that a junior could automate
* Wasting brain power on mechanical tasks

**The game changer:** I discovered [Julius](https://julius.ai/?via=zonereddit#) by chance (yeah, through a post here on Reddit). It's basically a data analyst with AI that speaks English and gets marketing.

**What changed in practice:**

* Upload CSV files from campaigns
* Ask directly: ""Which channel brought the most qualified leads this month?""
* In 30 seconds I have charts, insights, and even optimization suggestions
* The leftover time? Focus on strategy and creativity.

**Real example from yesterday:** Client wanted to understand why CPL spiked last week. Before: 2hrs of manual analysis. Now: 5 minutes to discover it was iOS 17.1 that changed Facebook Ads tracking.

**What impresses me most:**

* Understands marketing context (it's not just ChatGPT with data)
* Creates visualizations that make sense
* Suggests correlations I hadn't seen
* Adapts language to my technical level

I'm not an affiliate or anything (wish I was üòÖ), but honestly, this tool gave me back 3hrs a day. 

And you guys know how precious those 3hrs are for thinking strategy instead of being stuck in spreadsheets.

**For anyone working with marketing data:** It's really worth testing. Especially if you're like me and waste too much time on analysis that should be automatic.

Anyone else here tried AI tools for data analysis?

So as the title says I am a bit confused about markerlight drones and their use.

I often see that people put markerlight drones in their units, and I don't necessarily understand why.

1 I.e let's say I put a guardian drone and a markerlight drone in a Breacher team. Does that mean the breachers can mark during their movement phase and then shoot? (As in it consumes their movement) am I right to assume then that without the drone the breachers CAN NOT mark?

2 I have seen people putting markerlight drones in Pathfinder teams. What is the reason for this, I thought they have the ability to mark 2x targets regardless.

 I (24f) lways had a weird, toxic, but at the same time VERY close relationship with my mom (50f). We have a lot of trauma bonds. I was her ""therapist"" since I was about 5 years old. She always hated my fathers side of the family, for literally no reason. She just always felt like they hated her. I grew up listening to her describing how that side of my family is horrible, all the while I loved being with them. As a result I got this weird rift in me, because I was  a child and I believed her, but I still loved my dad and his side of the family. It also completely fucked up my self image growing up, because I was led to believe I had some kind of ""bad blood"" in me. She was still with my dad, but refused visit his family since 2012.

 In the last 5 years she changed completely. In 2020 out of nowhere she accused my dad of cheating and wanted to separate. She had 0 evidence. My poor dad was devastated. I didn't necessarily believe her, but years of her conditioning made me vulnerable. We moved away from dad. Soon she began acting really paranoid about everything. She started saying people were coming into our new apartment, so she started locking the door with a bike lock. She started saying spices were going missing. That her phone is being hacked. That her clothes are getting new holes every day. She said a lot more, but I can't remember every single thing she was paranoid about. I never noticed anything, and when I tried to calm her she was alway very defensive about it. She never had actual proof, but I tried to be ""on her side""

 In 2023 she moved out and my partner moved in with me. Ever since she's living alone these ""happenings"" started to ramp up. She bought a camera for EVERY room in her flat, but still claimed money was going missing overnight. She claimed there's a secret tunnel from undergorund that goes into her bathroom. When her erderly cat got sick she called her brother and accused him of giving antifreeze to the cat. At this point I finally had to come to terms with the fact, that she has a serious mental illness.

Around 2024 she cut off everybody she still had, except me and my partner. She said everybody is paid to be ""after her"" even her family, and somebody wanted to ruin her life. This somebody kept changing. Recently she claimed one of my dads childhood ex is behind all of this. Everything she told me started to put a huge toll on my mental wellbeing too. Me and my partner tried to help her with everything. We factory reset her phone and laptop many times, I searched for spy cameras with her, We tried to fix any IT related issues and suspicions she had. I tried to listen and be understanding. I didn't know how else to help her. I was getting really burnt out.

This year in march she started to accuse my partner and her family. Then one saturday morning she called and finally accused me of playing with her cameras. (I have access to them because I set them up for her and she wanted me to have access too.) At that point something broke in me. We barely texted in the last 6 months, my mental health was never this bad. I had a lot of time to reflect, and I realized she ruined my family (and probably my childhood) because of her mental illness. I have a lot of anger in me towards her, but I still really love and miss her. I want her to get help, but she absolutely refuses, she doesn't think anything is wrong with her.

A few days ago she texted me saying we should meet up for coffee. Today I told her my true feelings. I told her I didn't really wanna meet her, and that our distance is a bad but necessary thing for my mental health. I told her I loved her dearly, but I can only text from now on. 
She anwsered calmly. I felt very deep sorrow in her messages, but she said she loved me too, and that when Im ready ""she will be waiting for me."" She said she wanted to take her things that are still in our apartment.
 These messages really feel like a knife to the heart. I didn't think it would still hurt this bad after 6 months of almost no contact. Tbh I hoped she would just be angry at me and cuss me out. This feels like a breakup. Im in so much pain and I feel like I made a huge mistake. I feel so selfish. 
It's even worse because I know she's mentally ill, undiagnosed and unmedicated. Im really worried about her. I wish my country had 5150 like in the US.

I feel like I can't cope with this, and that everything is my fault. It feels like I committed a crime.

If you‚Äôre looking for a flower thats really high quality with a unique euphoric and relaxing effect prfile, Espresso Candy hit all the right spots for me.

Visual:¬†Shes pretty, chunky, sticky, sparkly with a nice cure.  
Nose:¬†When you crack it open you get a sweet candy note followed with by a coffee bitter tone - (reminded me of Kopeco lollies)  
Taste:¬†I definitely got candy and coffee from this strain, not over powering and stayed on the pallet for a while, really enjoyable.  
Effects:¬†outstanding, very enjoyable - started off very euphoric (found myself smiling out of control) and tapered into a nice relaxed calming high good option for low and high tolerance patients imo.  
Experience:¬†using might medic, she grinds and fluffs up well, with a quick sand like texture - super smooth on the inhale and exhale.

I feel like this is a great wind-down strain good for the evening or when the day‚Äôs been a bit crazy. You get this euphoric headed buzz to start, then it settles into a calm, relaxed body feel without knocking you out, but don't be fooled - dosed up a little she can sleep you

It was my very first time attending this open mic, I‚Äôve actually been waiting all month since I found out about it.

The stamp on my hand matched the way the candle burned on my spell. When I saw the stamp, I was overjoyed and felt like it was a sign that I was on the right path.

Ended up having a super successful night, meeting a bunch of cool people, networking, sharing resources, connecting, laughing‚Ä¶ there was a group of us hanging out and chatting until midnight when it ended around 10.

Maga a lehet≈ës√©g egy m√°r szervezett programra csatlakoz√°st jelentett, illetve a programon r√©sztvev≈ëk mellett lehett√ºnk a p√°ly√°n, √∫gy, hogy ≈ëk els≈ëbbs√©get √©lveztek, de szerencs√©re ez nem sok alkalmazkod√°st jelentett, 5 workshopos √©s 2 reddites volt ott Tam√°son √©s Nikin k√≠v√ºl akik szervezt√©k az esem√©nyt.

Magamr√≥l:

M√°sf√©l √©ve vagyok Mx-5 tulajdonos, egy ideje m√°r kac√©rkodtam a gondolattal, hogy kipr√≥b√°lom p√°ly√°n, ham√°r sportaut√≥, √≠gy ez a lehet≈ës√©g volt a v√©gs≈ë l√∂k√©s, hogy elsz√°njam r√° magam. Magamra √∫gy tekintettem, mint aki nem teljesen s√ºket a vezet√©shez, 17 √©ve van jogsim, gyerekkoromban NFS, Colin McRae, Dirt, Grid voltak a kedvenc j√°t√©kaim, r√©g√≥ta fogyasztok aut√≥s tartalmakat, √©s mi√≥ta megvan a Miat√°m, j√°rok k√ºl√∂nb√∂z≈ë aut√≥s esem√©nyekre is (cars&coffee, AMTS, japanese classic cars). Kanyarg√≥sabb utakon, szerpentineken m√°r mentem az Mx-5-tel, de hat√°rokat nem feszegettem, egyr√©szt k√∂z√∫t, m√°sokat nem vesz√©lyeztetek a saj√°t m√≥k√°m√©rt, m√°sr√©szt dr√°ga mulats√°g lenne lecs√∫szni az √∫tr√≥l akkor is, ha nem is j√∂n senki, √©s csak elm√©rek egy kanyart. Ilyen alapokkal √©rkeztem az esem√©nyre. Vittem magammal a hat √©ves fiamat is, el≈ëre megk√©rdeztem, hogy felmehetek-e vele a p√°ly√°ra, √©s az volt a v√°lasz, hogy ahogy k√∂z√∫ti szab√°lyok el≈ë√≠rj√°k, azaz gyerek√ºl√©sben vagy √ºl√©smagas√≠t√≥val.

Az esem√©ny:

A helysz√≠n az M-ring volt, Monorierd≈ën, a program pedig a [palyaautozz.hu](http://palyaautozz.hu) p√°lyaaut√≥s workshopja volt. A workshoposok kaptak elm√©leti oktat√°st kor√°bban, illetve k√∂r√∂z√©s k√∂zben Tam√°s seg√≠tett nekik instrukci√≥kkal a jobb egyb≈ël. √ân k√ºls≈ë szeml√©l≈ëk√©nt √∫gy l√°ttam hogy ez egy j√≥l bej√°ratott tr√©ning, nagyon profinak t≈±nt a dolog. Mi csak a szabad p√°lyahaszn√°latot kaptuk, vel√ºk egy id≈ëben k√∂r√∂zhett√ºnk, √∫gy hogy ≈ëket ne zavarjuk. Ez√©rt egy d√©lut√°ni p√°lyaaut√≥z√°s √°r√°t kellett kifizetni, de mivel egy workshopon viszonylag kevesen vannak, √≠gy volt, hogy szinte √ºres p√°ly√°n mehett√ºnk, s≈ët volt, hogy egyed√ºl k√∂r√∂zhettem, mert pont akkor mentem fel, amikor a workshoposok √©pp lej√∂ttek. A redditr≈ël v√©g√ºl 2-en csatlakoztunk, √©n egy Mx-5-tel, illetve egy m√°sik sr√°c a Fiat Barchetta-j√°val.

Kaptunk felk√©sz√≠t≈ë anyagot emailben, p√°lyarajzzal, illetve le√≠r√°ssal, hogy hol √©s hogyan kell elengedni a gyorsabb aut√≥t, felhajtani √©s lej√∂nni a p√°ly√°r√≥l, azaz a helyi j√°t√©kszab√°lyokr√≥l. Ezenk√≠v√ºl egy vide√≥t, amiben belemennek a gumikop√°s l√©lektan√°ba, hogyan lehet megel≈ëzni a hib√°s kop√°st, mire kell figyelni, hogy ne ny√≠rd ki a gumikat egyetlen nap alatt. Ez szerintem el√©rte a c√©lj√°t, mert az els≈ë √≥r√°ban csak ez j√°rt a fejemben, hogy t√∂nkre fogom tenni a gumikat, √©s vehetek egy √∫j szettet... Szerencs√©re az utcai gumik nem kopnak el egy kis p√°ly√°z√°s alatt, hi√°ba csikorognak, nem kopnak el olyan k√∂nnyen, plusz ahogy √ºgyesedtem, egyre jobban r√°√©reztem a cs√∫sz√°shat√°rra, √©s a gumik is bemelegedtek annyira, hogy egyszerre gyorsultak √©s halkultak a k√∂reim. Egyszerre 4-5 k√∂rt ment√ºnk, plusz 1-2 bemeleg√≠t≈ë k√∂r az elej√©n, illetve egy h≈±t≈ëk√∂r a v√©g√©n 4-esben, m√°r nem √©lesen, de temp√≥san haladva, hogy kicsit visszah≈±lhessen a motor a menetsz√©lben. A v√©ge fel√© ezt m√°r ink√°bb kitoltam 7-8 √©les k√∂rre, am√≠g nem √©reztem, hogy f√°radok, meg √∫jra elkezdett cs√∫szk√°lni a kocsi.

A tapasztalataim: 

RENGETEGET lehet tanulni egy ilyen alkalmon. M√©g √∫gy is, hogy nem √ºlt mellettem instruktor, csak k√∂vettem/pr√≥b√°ltam k√∂vetni a t√∂bbieket, milyen √≠veken mennek, hol f√©keznek stb. Olyan alap dolgokkal j√∂ttem tiszt√°ba, amit elviekben m√°r tudtam, de m√©gis m√°s megtapasztalni. A miata rendk√≠v√ºl kezes aut√≥, √ºgyesen veszi a kanyarokat, √©s ha feszegeted, akkor is elkezdi cs√∫sztatni hol az elej√©t, hol a h√°tulj√°t, √©s nagyon k√∂nnyen √∂sszeszedhet≈ë, ha elveszed a g√°zt, vagy kicsit ellenkorm√°nyzol. Az egy√©m 1.6-os, kisebb motoros, ami ink√°bb 4 √©s 7ezer k√∂z√∂tt √©l, ott lehet nagyot kigyors√≠tani vele, lejjebb kev√©s a nyomat√©k, √≠gy szinte sosem akar megp√∂rd√ºlni. Ha t√∫l gyorsan/kev√©s f√©kez√©ssel √©rkeztem a kanyarba, akkor alulkorm√°nyozott volt, √©s nem akarta bevenni a kanyart, cs√∫sztam kifel√©. √ârdekes volt megtapasztalni, hogy a h√°ts√≥kerekes aut√≥val kanyarban, cs√∫sz√°shat√°ron aut√≥zva egy b√°trabb g√°zad√°ssal pont hogy jobban lehetett kanyarodni, ahogy r√°terhelt a h√°ts√≥ gumira a kocsi, egyb≈ël abbamaradt a csikorg√°s √©s feler≈ës√∂d√∂tt az oldalir√°ny√∫ G er≈ë, √©s arra ment az aut√≥, amerre a korm√°nyoztam. Ezzel kapcsolatos a kics√∫sz√°som is. M√°r m√°sodik vagy harmadik etapban voltunk, egyre gyorsabb k√∂r√∂ket v√°llaltam. Kisfiam is √©ppen bent √ºlt mellettem, nagyon √©lvezte a gyors kanyarokat, biztatott, hogy driftelj√ºnk is. A h√°ts√≥ hossz√∫ balos kanyarban csikorg√≥ gumikkal, hat√°ron aut√≥zva mentem, √©s akartam egy powerslide-ot, √∫gyhogy odal√©ptem a g√°znak, sz√©pen megindult a h√°tulja, ellenkorm√°nyoztam jobbra, azt√°n vissza akartam t√©rni egyenesbe, √∫gyhogy elvettem a g√°zt. Ekkor betapadtak a gumik, √©s a kocsi r√∂gt√∂n elindult jobbra, amerre az els≈ë kerekek √°lltak √©s egyenesen kimentem a f≈±re jobbra. :D Szerencs√©re volt el√©g buk√≥t√©r, √©s egy kis ijedts√©gen k√≠v√ºl semmi bajunk nem t√∂rt√©nt, se nek√ºnk, se a kocsinak. Arra is pr√≥b√°ltam figyelni, hogy a p√°ly√°ra ne hordjak sok port meg kavicsot a buk√≥t√©rb≈ël, √∫gyhogy gyorsan le is hajtottam a kij√°ratn√°l, ami alig p√°r m√©terre volt a kics√∫sz√°som hely√©t≈ël. Ezut√°n ink√°bb arra f√≥kusz√°ltam, hogy az √≠veket min√©l szebben vegyem √©s hogy ne √©rkezzek t√∫l gyorsan a kanyarokba, hanem ink√°bb kifel√© legyek gyors. A legnagyobb kih√≠v√°s a f≈ë√©p√ºlet el≈ëtti nagy kanyar volt, ami egy nagy √≠v≈± gyors balos √©s egy sz≈±kebb balos kanyar kombin√°ci√≥ja. Hi√°ba kerestem a kanyar cs√∫cs√°t a nagy √≠vben, a kis √≠vet √≠gy mindig bel√ºlr≈ël kezdtem, ami miatt m√©g sz≈±kebbre kellett ford√≠tani a korm√°nyt √©s ett≈ël tolta az orr√°t a kocsi, el kellett venni a g√°zt. Meg is k√©rdeztem Tam√°st hogy mit rontok el, √©s ≈ë seg√≠t≈ëk√©szen el is magyar√°zta, hogy ha tapad√°shat√°ron megyek √©s ut√°na sz≈±kebbre ford√≠tom a korm√°nyt, akkor az aut√≥ m√°r nem fogja tudni ezt k√∂vetni, √©s egyr√©szt ne menjek annyira gyorsan a nagyobb √≠v≈± kanyarban, m√°sr√©szt nem kell annyira bemenni az ivbels≈ë r√©szhez, √©s akkor jobban megy majd a kigyors√≠t√°s. Igaza volt.

Teltek a k√∂r√∂k, k√∂zben pihen√©skor besz√©lgett√ºnk a Barchett√°s sr√°ccal, s≈ët be is √ºlt√ºnk egym√°s mell√©, √∂sszek√≥stolni a Fiat-ot √©s a Mazd√°t, megtapasztaltuk hogy mennyire m√°sk√©pp viselkedik egy els≈ë √©s h√°ts√≥kerekes aut√≥ a p√°ly√°n, hat√°ron aut√≥zva. Az els≈ë kerekes aut√≥ a terhel√©s nagy r√©sz√©t 2 ker√©kre kapja, m√°s input kell a sof≈ërt≈ël az ir√°ny√≠t√°shoz. 

Abb√≥l is sokat lehetett tanulni, hogy sokat k√∂r√∂zt√ºnk a p√°ly√°n, van rajta kb 10 kanyar, √©s vagy sz√°zszor v√©gigment√ºnk rajta, ez√©rt nagyon hamar √∂ssze lehet kapcsolni, hogy mit csin√°lok a vol√°nn√°l, √©s erre hogyan reag√°l az aut√≥. Ha k√©s≈ën f√©kezek √©s k√∂zben m√°r kanyarodni kell, akkor orrtol√≥s lesz, √©s lecs√∫szik az √≠vr≈ël. Ha kettesben megyek be a sik√°nba, akkor sokkal gyorsabban tudok √°tmenni, mintha ugyanannyival, de h√°rmasban √©rkezek oda. Ha elveszem a g√°zt, cs√∫szik az eleje, ha beletaposok, betapad √©s befordul, nagyon nagy g√°zra meg kidobja a fenek√©t. Meg m√©g milli√≥nyi apr√≥ √©lm√©ny, √©rzet, meg sem lehet mindenre ilyen szab√°lyt sz√≥ban fogalmazni, de percenk√©nt √∫jra lehet pr√≥b√°lni ugyanazt a kanyart, √©s egyszer≈±en r√°√©rez az agyad, hogy mi m≈±k√∂dik √©s mi nem.

Tam√°ssal is besz√©lgettem, k√©rdezte, hogy mi√©rt j√∂ttem, √©s mi tartott vissza, hogy eddig nem j√∂ttem. Mondtam, hogy legink√°bb az tartott vissza, hogy viszonylag nem r√©g √≥ta van csak olyan aut√≥m, amivel van √©rtelme p√°ly√°zni. Tam√°s erre mondta, hogy igaz√°b√≥l minden aut√≥val van √©rtelme p√°ly√°zni, hiszen itt meg lehet tapasztalni, hogy milyen √©rz√©s, ahogy megcs√∫szik az aut√≥, mi az amit meg tudunk oldani, √©s mi az, amir≈ël csak azt hissz√ºk, hogy meg tudjuk csin√°lni. √ögyhogy b√°tor√≠tok mindenkit, hogy nyugodtan j√∂het ak√°rmilyen aut√≥ja van, az egyik workshopos a Kia ProCeed kombij√°val gyakorolt. Az se tartson vissza senkit, hogy a t√∂bbiek len√©zn√©k, mert kezd≈ë, pont ellenkez≈ëleg, mindenki kedves √©s seg√≠t≈ëk√©sz volt, adtak tan√°csokat, b√°tor√≠tottak hogy j√∂jj√ºnk m√°skor is. √ân tuti fogok m√©g. Remek kikapcsol√≥d√°s, √©s rendesen lef√°raszt mint egy j√≥ edz√©s. √âs mivel kihajtottam magamb√≥l az adrenalint, sokkal nyugodtabban vezettem ut√°na, amikor hazafele menet tilosban el≈ëz√∂tt egy d√≠zel Jett√°s, √©n csak f√∂l√©nyesen mosolyogtam magamban.",24,1753773994.0,CartalkHungary,2,1.0,False

1mc50ha,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1mc50ha/update_coworker_showing_up_to_my_vehicle/,Update: Co-worker showing up to my vehicle unplanned and uninvited for a ride to work.,"She didn't show up to my vehicle today. She told me at work that she found a work van company to use, which is great! My reasonings are below for why I didn't want to start giving her rides every day or why I don't want to get too close outside of work, for those who thought I was being rude, selfish, or mean.  

**TLDR;** She thinks she's being stalked through her fridge to her phone, I'm sick of hearing about it every day. She's unreliable, irresponsible, and a little entitled when it came to getting a ride from me in the past and just as a person. If she were chill while riding along, I'd be happy to give her a ride.  

We work in different departments. She does her mandated overtime right now on Saturdays, while I do my overtime during the week (if I need to) and only sometimes on the weekends, before she comes in. I also go home early some days, whereas she is a new hire so she puts in full days. Our schedules don't really match up.  

I've given her one ride to work once. I told her what time we were going to be leaving. She was 10 minutes late coming down. I stopped at the coffee shop, like I normally do on my way to work, and bought her a coffee of her choice and a snack because I was getting something for myself. On the way back home, she wanted to stop at a store then a gas station. I just wanted to go home. It felt like when you give an inch, they want to take a mile. She offered to give me gas money, and never did.  

I recently brought her and her cat to the vet. She got the time wrong. Created a full scene at the vet's office. I had to chide her and remind her of her manners. Took her home. Then back to the vet for the correct time. Then to the store after for some cat items the vet said to get. Waited for her. Had to go into the store and find her because I still needed to get my lunch together for work and time was running out. Found her at the photo department and had to tell her we needed to go.  

**Once she moved into her apartment, something snapped in her.** She thinks that people are watching her from her AC unit, so she turned it off during our very hot days. She thinks that people are listening to her from her fridge and vacuum. She said that someone is turning off her vacuum and fridge as well when she tries to use them. She said she will say (to the air) things like ""you don't want me to cook in my own apartment? I'm going to eat food in my own apartment. You can't stop me."" She thinks she is telling her stalker this. We don't have smart fridges or whatever they are called. Ours are the old-fashioned ones, just bare minimum. She thought someone spit in her vinegar while she was away from her apartment, so she brings the vinegar to work with her.  

She printed off photos of some light rays reflecting onto her ceiling, and she says it's from people standing outside of her apartment, watching her. She had photos of what I told her looked like water pockets in the ceiling and she should call maintenance, but she says they were put there by someone who enters her apartment when she is away. She printed off a Facebook photo of a woman and says that a woman who lives in the apartment beneath her is stalking her. Not to mention how she says that now her AC unit fell yesterday, which would leave a huge gaping hole in her wall.  

I had mentioned her getting security cameras for inside her apartment, but she says that she had them before and someone hacked into them to watch her.

At work, she said that the cleaning lady was (telepathically?) messing with her machines because when the cleaning lady walked by, her parts would come down differently. She also thought someone was hacking into her cellphone at work if a website wouldn't load.  

When she approached me for a ride, she said that my supervisor was going to call me and ask if I would give her a ride to work. My supervisor is a man, I'm a woman. There's no way he would ever call me. He has never called me in all the years I've worked there. She had lost her phone the day before, so he wouldn't have known at all on what was going on. She would have no way to contact him. We don't have the same supervisor, either.  

I live a very quiet, drama-free life. I don't want someone coming around where I live, acting foolish by screaming out my name. I could get in trouble with my apartment complex if she causes a scene and says that she's a guest of mine. When she was screaming at me from her balcony, my first thought was wondering what the heck her neighbors were thinking, and how much of an annoyance that was for them. She's only been in her apartment for a month.  

I only hear about the stalker stuff at work, and it's in short story form. I don't want it spilling into my personal life. It's the ONLY thing she talks about. Her entire life and mind is consumed with thinking that she is being stalked.  

There is only so much that I can hear about this. If she wanted to just sit and chill on our way to work, and on our way back, I would be totally cool with giving her a ride. But I can't deal with this any more than I already do.",12,1753773933.0,coworkerstories,5,0.93,False
1mc4x2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1mc4x2i/what_daily_habits_actually_boost_metabolism/,What Daily Habits Actually Boost Metabolism,"Let‚Äôs be real: if boosting metabolism was as easy as drinking lemon water or popping green tea pills, we‚Äôd all be there already.

Most ‚Äúmetabolism hacks‚Äù are either oversold or irrelevant unless your core habits are in check. So here‚Äôs what‚Äôs helped me (and what holds up when you look past the Instagram advice and actually pay attention to your body):

1. Protein First ‚Äî Every Damn Day

Seriously, getting 25‚Äì30g of protein per meal changed the game for me. Not only does it keep you full, but your body actually burns more calories digesting it (it‚Äôs called the thermic effect). I start with eggs, cottage cheese, or a protein smoothie‚Äînot cereal, not toast. Makes a difference.

2. Lift Something. Anything. Regularly.

I‚Äôm not a gym rat. I just lift 2‚Äì3x/week‚Äîmostly bodyweight or dumbbells at home. Muscle burns more at rest, and once I got consistent with strength training, I noticed I could eat a bit more without gaining. Plus, it makes you feel strong, which is underrated.

3. Move Your A (Even When You‚Äôre Not ‚ÄúExercising‚Äù)\*\*

One of the biggest eye-openers for me: that stuff you do outside of workouts‚Äîwalking, cleaning, fidgeting, pacing on calls‚Äîthat burns way more over the day than your 45-minute HIIT. They call it NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis), but I just think of it as ‚Äúdon‚Äôt sit for 6 hours straight‚Äù.

4. Sleep Like You Mean It

I used to brag about surviving on 5‚Äì6 hours. Big mistake. Poor sleep made me hungrier, lazier, and more bloated. When I started sleeping 7‚Äì8 hours consistently, I felt way less snacky, my workouts got better, and everything just clicked. Sleep resets your hormones, plain and simple.

5. Drink Water (No, Really)

Mild dehydration slows you down. I used to confuse thirst for hunger all the time. Now I keep a bottle on my desk and actually drink it. Cold water may give a slight metabolic bump, but mostly it just helps everything function better‚Äîdigestion, energy, cravings, the works.

6. Don‚Äôt Crash Diet or Skip Meals

Been there, regretted it. Dropping calories too low slowed everything down and made me miserable. Your metabolism adapts when it feels starved. What worked better? Eating enough‚Äîespecially protein and fats‚Äîand staying consistent. No more binge cycles.

7. A Little Spice, a Little Caffeine

I love spicy food, so this was a win. Capsaicin (in chili) gives a tiny metabolic bump. Same with green tea or black coffee. Won‚Äôt torch fat on its own, but these can support the process‚Äîjust don‚Äôt rely on them or overdo the caffeine (trust me, I learned the hard way).

8. Manage Stress Before It Manages You

Stress hormones like cortisol can mess with metabolism, sleep, and fat storage (hello, stubborn belly fat). I‚Äôm not into meditation apps, but even journaling, short walks, or just getting off my phone for 30 minutes helps. Stress sneaks up on your health if you‚Äôre not paying attention.



None of this is very exciting, but metabolism isn't a very fascinating system. It reacts to regular inputs, not modern hacks. Put your attention on the basics. The rest comes next.

Seriously, getting 25‚Äì30g of protein per meal changed the game for me. Not only does it keep you full, but your body actually burns more calories digesting it (it‚Äôs called the thermic effect). I start with eggs, cottage cheese, or a protein smoothie‚Äînot cereal, not toast. Makes a difference.

**2. Lift Something. Anything. Regularly.**  
I‚Äôm not a gym rat. I just lift 2‚Äì3x/week‚Äîmostly bodyweight or dumbbells at home. Muscle burns more at rest, and once I got consistent with strength training, I noticed I could eat a bit more without gaining. Plus, it makes you feel *strong*, which is underrated.

**3. Move Your A** (Even When You‚Äôre Not ‚ÄúExercising‚Äù)\*\*  
One of the biggest eye-openers for me: that stuff you do outside of workouts‚Äîwalking, cleaning, fidgeting, pacing on calls‚Äîthat burns way more over the day than your 45-minute HIIT. They call it NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis), but I just think of it as ‚Äúdon‚Äôt sit for 6 hours straight.‚Äù

**4. Sleep Like You Mean It**  
I used to brag about surviving on 5‚Äì6 hours. Big mistake. Poor sleep made me hungrier, lazier, and more bloated. When I started sleeping 7‚Äì8 hours consistently, I felt way less snacky, my workouts got better, and everything just clicked. Sleep resets your hormones, plain and simple.

**5. Drink Water (No, Really)**  
Mild dehydration slows you down. I used to confuse thirst for hunger all the time. Now I keep a bottle on my desk and actually drink it. Cold water may give a slight metabolic bump, but mostly it just helps everything function better‚Äîdigestion, energy, cravings, the works.

**6. Don‚Äôt Crash Diet or Skip Meals**  
Been there, regretted it. Dropping calories too low slowed everything down and made me miserable. Your metabolism adapts when it feels starved. What worked better? Eating enough‚Äîespecially protein and fats‚Äîand staying consistent. No more binge cycles.

**7. A Little Spice, a Little Caffeine**  
I love spicy food, so this was a win. Capsaicin (in chili) gives a tiny metabolic bump. Same with green tea or black coffee. Won‚Äôt torch fat on its own, but these can support the process‚Äîjust don‚Äôt rely on them or overdo the caffeine (trust me, I learned the hard way).

**8. Manage Stress Before It Manages You**  
Stress hormones like cortisol can mess with metabolism, sleep, and fat storage (hello, stubborn belly fat). I‚Äôm not into meditation apps, but even journaling, short walks, or just *getting off my phone* for 30 minutes helps. Stress sneaks up on your health if you‚Äôre not paying attention.

  
None of this is very exciting, but metabolism isn't a very fascinating system. It reacts to regular inputs, not modern hacks. Put your attention on the basics. The rest comes next.

Unlike protected or pigmented leathers, aniline leather has minimal surface coating, making it more susceptible to stains, fading, and damage from environmental factors. Selecting the right aniline leather cleaner conditioner is crucial to gently clean, nourish, and protect this delicate material, preserving its original character and extending its lifespan. This guide will comprehensively examine the best aniline leather cleaner conditioners available in 2025, helping you make an informed decision to safeguard your valuable leather possessions.

## key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of an aniline leather cleaner conditioner hinges on a delicate balance between cleaning power and gentle conditioning. These products must effectively remove dirt and grime without stripping the leather of its natural oils or damaging its porous surface.

**pH-Balanced Formula:**

A pH-balanced formula is essential for aniline leather care. Aniline leather is slightly acidic, and using a cleaner with an alkaline pH can disrupt this balance, leading to dryness, cracking, and discoloration. The ideal pH range for an aniline leather cleaner conditioner is between 5.0 and 7.0. This ensures that the cleaner effectively lifts dirt and grime without harming the leather's delicate fibers. Many high-quality products explicitly state their pH level on the label, allowing consumers to make informed choices.

The conditioning component of these products typically utilizes a blend of natural oils and waxes. These ingredients penetrate the leather's pores, replenishing lost moisture and creating a protective barrier against future damage. Common oils include neatsfoot oil, mink oil, and lanolin, each offering unique benefits in terms of softening and protecting the leather. Waxes, such as beeswax or carnauba wax, help to create a water-resistant surface and enhance the leather's natural sheen. The specific blend of oils and waxes can vary significantly between products,affecting the conditioner's overall performance and feel.

**UV Protection:**

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a major cause of fading and discoloration in aniline leather. Exposure to sunlight can break down the leather's dyes, leading to significant aesthetic damage over time. Some aniline leather cleaner conditioners incorporate UV protectants to mitigate this risk.These protectants act as a shield, absorbing or reflecting harmful UV rays and preventing them from damaging the leather's surface.The level of UV protection can vary, with some products offering a higher SPF rating then others.

**Dye Stability:**

Aniline leather is dyed using soluble dyes that penetrate the leather's surface, creating a rich and vibrant color. However, these dyes are susceptible to bleeding or fading when exposed to harsh chemicals or excessive moisture. A good aniline leather cleaner conditioner should be formulated to minimize dye transfer and maintain the leather's original color.it should undergo rigorous testing to ensure that it does not cause any noticeable color change or fading, even after repeated use.

# Best Dry Marsala 2025: Expert Reviews & buying Guide

Dry marsala is a versatile fortified wine hailing from Sicily, Italy. Its unique production process, involving teh addition of *mosto cotto* (cooked grape must) and *sifone* (alcohol), results in a complex flavour profile favored by chefs and cocktail enthusiasts alike. This guide will navigate the world of dry marsala, offering expert reviews and insights to help you select the best bottle for your culinary or mixology needs. Choosing the right dry marsala can elevate dishes and cocktails, adding depth and complexity that few other ingredients can achieve.

## key Features Analysis

The quality of dry marsala is persistent by several factors, including the grape varietals used, the aging process, and the residual sugar content. Understanding these features is crucial for making an informed purchase.

**Grape Varietals:**

Dry marsala is typically made from white grape varieties such as Grillo, Inzolia, and Catarratto. These grapes contribute distinct characteristics to the wine. Grillo,known for its aromatic qualities and acidity,is considered the most prized. Inzolia adds richness and nutty flavors, while Catarratto offers a more neutral base. The best dry marsalas often feature a blend of these grapes, carefully balanced to achieve a harmonious and complex flavor profile.

**Aging Process:**

The aging process significantly impacts the flavor and complexity of dry marsala. *Fine* marsala is aged for at least one year, while *Superiore* marsala undergoes a minimum of two years of aging. *superiore Riserva* is aged for at least four years. Longer aging periods,often in oak barrels,allow the marsala to develop richer,more concentrated flavors,and a smoother texture.The extended contact wiht oak contributes notes of vanilla, caramel, and spice.

**Residual Sugar Content:**

The defining characteristic of dry marsala is its low residual sugar content. According to regulations, dry marsala must contain no more than 40 grams of sugar per liter. This dryness distinguishes it from other styles of marsala, such as *dolce* (sweet) and *semisecco* (medium-dry). The dryness allows the wine's inherent flavors of nuts, dried fruit, and spice to shine through without being masked by sweetness.

**Alcohol Content:**

Dry marsala typically has an alcohol content between 17% and 20% ABV (alcohol by volume). This relatively high alcohol content is a result of fortification,the addition of alcohol to the wine,which helps to preserve it and contributes to its robust character. The alcohol content is balanced by the wine's acidity and tannins, preventing it from tasting overly alcoholic.

## Core benefits

Dry marsala offers practical benefits that extend beyond its distinctive flavor. Its versatility in cooking and mixology makes it a valuable addition to any pantry or bar.

**Enhanced Flavor Depth:**

Dry marsala imparts a unique depth of flavor to savory dishes, especially sauces and meat preparations. its nutty and dried fruit notes complement chicken, veal, and mushrooms beautifully. For example, adding a splash of dry marsala to a mushroom risotto enhances its earthy flavors, creating a richer and more complex dish. It also works wonders in classic sauces such as *marsala sauce*, where it adds a distinctive sweetness balanced by savory notes.

**Extended Shelf Life:**

As a fortified wine,dry marsala boasts a longer shelf life than unfortified wines. Once opened, a bottle of dry marsala can last for several weeks, or even months, if properly stored in a cool, dark place. This extended shelf life minimizes waste and allows you to enjoy its complex flavors over an extended period, making it a practical choice for home cooks and bartenders alike.

**Versatile Culinary Applications:**

From savory sauces to sweet desserts, dry marsala lends itself to a wide range of culinary applications. It can be used to deglaze pans,adding flavor and complexity to pan sauces. It also complements desserts like tiramisu, where its nutty notes enhance the coffee and cocoa flavors. Its versatility allows you to experiment with different flavor combinations and elevate your culinary creations.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions provides additional clarity and confidence in selecting the right dry marsala.

**What is the difference between dry marsala and sweet marsala?**

The primary difference lies in the residual sugar content. Dry marsala contains no more than 40 grams of sugar per liter, resulting in a dry taste. Sweet marsala, on the other hand, has a higher sugar content, typically exceeding 100 grams per liter, making it noticeably sweeter. *Semisecco* marsala falls in between, with a sugar content ranging from 40 to 100 grams per liter.**How should dry marsala be stored?**

Unopened bottles of dry marsala should be stored in a cool, dark place, away from direct sunlight and extreme temperature fluctuations. Once opened,the bottle should be tightly sealed and refrigerated to preserve its freshness and flavor.proper storage can significantly extend its shelf life.**Can dry marsala be substituted with other wines in recipes?**

While other wines can be used as substitutes, they will not replicate the unique flavor profile of dry marsala. Dry sherry or Madeira can be used as alternatives, though they may have slightly different flavor nuances. If substituting, start with a smaller amount and adjust to taste.

**Is dry marsala gluten-free?**

Yes, dry marsala is generally considered gluten-free. Wine is naturally gluten-free, and the production process of marsala does not typically involve any gluten-containing ingredients. However, individuals with severe gluten sensitivities should always check the label or contact the producer to ensure there are no potential cross-contamination risks.

I‚Äôm 24F, working in IT as a software engineer. Life is stable, and I‚Äôm grateful. I live on my own, pay my bills, eat three times a day. But lately, murag naay constant battle inside me ‚Äî between wanting to live a calm, simple life and wanting to grow and become more.

There are days nga gusto ra ko mag-slow down. Wake up early, make coffee, tan-aw lang sa kahayag sa adlaw, magbasa. No pressure, no chasing. Life is short raba. Maka-think ko, unsaon pa man nang tanan if in the end, kapoy ra jud gihapon?

But on the other side... I‚Äôve always been a learner. Since bata pa ko, I‚Äôve dreamed of becoming many things ‚Äî a radio DJ, a teacher, a creative, ug daghan pa. Now I work in tech, and I‚Äôm happy, pero murag dili pa jud enough. I want to keep learning, keep building something for myself.

I graduated with flying colors ‚Äî not to brag ‚Äî pero validation ra jud siya nga I genuinely love studying. I love gaining skills, certifications, knowledge. Maka-feel ko‚Äôg alive every time I learn something new.

And I still want more. Gusto pa ko mo-work abroad, not just for travel but to grow my career. Career woman baya ko deep inside. Pero at the same time, I also long for peace, for slow mornings, for a simple kind of life. Murag opposite sila pero naa sila duha sa akoang heart.

So I tell myself maybe my 20s are meant for expansion, growth, building. Then maybe sa 30s, diha na ko mag-settle, maghinay-hinay. But who knows man pud diba, if makaabot ta sa 30. Not in a negative way ‚Äî just being real. Life‚Äôs uncertain.

It was painful, a harsh slap to the face, but at least it happened early in my life, and that‚Äôs a good thing. Some people spend years before going through something like this.

Okay, let‚Äôs begin.

I developed feelings for a girl at my university. She worked there ‚Äî she‚Äôs a bit older than me, but only by a few months. She helped me during my final year. She‚Äôs kind, beautiful, and super friendly with everyone ‚Äî very extroverted. That can be both a blessing and a curse.

Now, normally I‚Äôm not the type to get involved with girls or chase after them. I always stayed away from that stuff. But sometimes, a certain girl comes into your mind and heart, and any guy who has felt this knows how emotions can destroy everything. For two weeks straight, I couldn‚Äôt think about anything but her.

Eventually, we got to know each other more. We followed each other on Instagram, chatted, and exchanged memes. I was naive ‚Äî I genuinely thought she felt the same way. I later realized I was wrong. But back then, everything felt perfect.

Let me pause the story here and explain something about her. She‚Äôs very open-minded, from an upper-class background. She mostly speaks English because she went to an international school. That wasn‚Äôt an issue for me. She liked dark/racist humor memes, swore in English, and was super casual ‚Äî and again, I was totally fine with all of that.

But the downside? She wouldn‚Äôt reply right away. Sometimes she‚Äôd disappear for a while, and it bothered me how she didn‚Äôt see a problem riding alone in an Uber with a guy. (Please don‚Äôt judge me too quickly ‚Äî just hear me out and try to understand my feelings.)

Anyway, I finally got the courage to confess my feelings. I was tired of hiding it. If she accepted, great. If not, I was ready to move on. I told her I loved her.

She said okay ‚Äî but after I graduate. She also said I‚Äôm not in the friendzone and gave some mixed signals. But overall, I was happy and hopeful.

We kept talking on WhatsApp for a few days, then went back to Instagram. One day, I noticed she changed her profile picture, so I messaged her. I thought she would respond, especially since she said she had feelings too. But she didn‚Äôt reply at all or even react. Then four days later, she posted a story ‚Äî so she clearly saw my message. I got frustrated and ignored her for two full weeks.

During that time, we had just finished a project discussion for a course. I posted a story with my friends, and I hadn‚Äôt been watching her stories or reacting at all. Out of nowhere, she liked my story and messaged me the next day, sending memes. She said, ‚ÄúI would‚Äôve sent you more if I knew you weren‚Äôt busy.‚Äù
(I know you‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚ÄúWhat a fool,‚Äù but stay with me.)

I ignored her messages for three days. Then I finally replied ‚Äî but calmly and distant.

Here‚Äôs something odd: she posted a story, deleted it, then reposted the same thing the next day and deleted it again. Then after messaging me, she added me to her ‚Äúclose friends‚Äù and posted that same story again ‚Äî but deleted it 10 minutes later. I didn‚Äôt understand what that meant, and when I asked, she vaguely said it was just pointing at something, but I didn‚Äôt ask again.

We got back to talking. Things felt normal again. Then came a shocking moment ‚Äî her dad passed away. May he rest in peace. I offered my condolences, of course. Later, she messaged me asking to meet up for coffee, to help her forget and distract herself.

We had a great day together ‚Äî cinema, coffee, talking.

We ended up going out four times. She invited me once, I invited her once, we exchanged gifts ‚Äî everything seemed fine.

Then I confessed again. I told her seriously that I loved her. She said, ‚ÄúOkay, give me 3 days and I‚Äôll let you know ‚Äî but only if you‚Äôre not talking to other girls or seeing me as a second option.‚Äù

Three days later, she said ‚Äúokay‚Äù and confirmed her feelings. But still, whenever we went out, she‚Äôd say things like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how I feel toward you yet ‚Äî maybe I need more time with you to figure it out.‚Äù

She would get jealous, hold my hand, rest her head on my chest or shoulder, but the words she used still sounded like we were ‚Äújust friends.‚Äù

The last time we went out, everything seemed normal and fine. The day after that, still okay. The following day, I sent her a meme ‚Äî and boom, she blocked me.

I was shocked.

I checked her bio ‚Äî she had removed it. What the hell? She always said she was honest and didn‚Äôt ghost or block people. She said she doesn‚Äôt treat people like second options.

She hadn‚Äôt blocked me on Instagram, though. I waited a day. Then the next day, I tried calling her ‚Äî no answer. I kept trying, nothing. By the end of that day, I sent her 3 Instagram messages saying basically:

‚ÄúIf silence is your answer, then forget about the relationship.‚Äù

The next day, she called me. Said two words. Then the call cut off from her end. I tried calling back many times. Nothing. I felt like I had the right to know why. What did I do wrong? I‚Äôm not someone who likes drama.

Then she blocked all calls from me.

I messaged her from another number, saying it‚Äôs me, just wanting to understand. Then she unfollowed me on Instagram.

At that point, you can say whatever you want about me ‚Äî but I felt crushed. My dignity felt dragged through the dirt.

I honestly thought she was different from the others. Thought she was mature. But turns out, she was just a kid ‚Äî even more immature than the rest.

I know I lowered myself. But I had the right to ask why. I feel broken, guilty, even stupid for being in this relationship in the first place. There were so many red flags. But any guy knows how emotions can cloud your mind.

Anyway, thank God ‚Äî I got the slap early. I still have the army ahead, work, and life. Yes, I‚Äôm sad. But I‚Äôm better off than others. And honestly, screw it ‚Äî the most important thing I‚Äôve learned is this:

Focus on yourself. No one‚Äôs going to be there for you like you will.

I realized that at this age, people can seem like they love you like crazy. But inside them? They‚Äôre filled with doubts.
So work on yourself ‚Äî it‚Äôs the better investment.



Btw she stold me about her 2 exes she said she never had official relationship with them before but she blocked one of them and the other ghosted her ....

Edit: btw i tried to talk about girls in some place then she showed jealous idk if she were acting but she was playful jealousy

When I actual weigh my flour to get an exact weight for the 3 cups, this dough is extremely wet and loose.  Like, I can‚Äôt form it into a ball, it‚Äôs more of a thick liquid.  And the bread turns out amazing and soft and beautiful.  When I scoop my flour with the measuring cup (something we are constantly telling you not to do,) the dough is still on the wet-sticky side, but it looks more like most people‚Äôs photos of this dough, and you can actually form it into a  ball. And it turns out delicious.  So what I‚Äôm saying is, this dough is extremely flexible.  Try it a few times and see what you like, but don‚Äôt ever get worried it‚Äôs not going to work because it always works!  Just don‚Äôt add tons more flour because you think it should be the consistency of playdough.  Because it shouldn‚Äôt.  Overall your dough should be quite loose and sticky, but feel free to just dunk your measuring cup in your flour bag and haphazardly scoop.  This is one instance where that totally Let the Dough Rest

Once that‚Äôs all mixed up, just cover with plastic, leave on your counter, and come back and visit it tomorrow. It needs to sit for anywhere from 8-18 hours.  I always just mix up the dough the day before, but technically you could do it early in the morning and have it for dinner as well.  Just know the longer it sits, the better the texture will be so I recommend at least 12 At this point you‚Äôll just scrape it all out onto a generously floured surface- I put it directly onto a piece of parchment paper. Remember your dough will be REALLY sticky so sprinkle flour all over it where you‚Äôll be touching it and handle it gently so it doesn‚Äôt get all over you.  Fold it on top of itself a couple times (remember no kneading) and form it into a round-ish shape.  Let it sit for 30 minutes.  During that 30 minutes you will place your empty, covered dutch oven in your oven preheated to a screaming hot 450 degrees.  We‚Äôre creating our own little bread oven Baking No-Knead Bread

When it‚Äôs preheated you will CAREFULLY (can‚Äôt stress that enough) remove your crazy hot pan from the oven, transfer your bread into it, and place the lid on.  DON‚ÄôT FORGET YOUR LID IS PIPING HOT.  I always keep a towel over the handle while it‚Äôs on my counter just to be safe.  Pop that pot back into the oven to bake.  You can see I just lift my whole parchment paper that my bread was sitting on and put it into the pot. about 40 minutes later your house will smell like a straight-up European

This bread has a super crispy crust and a chewy soft inside. It‚Äôs the kind of bread you rip off in chunks and slather with butter while it‚Äôs still warm, or dunk in a bowl of soup, or dip in olive oil.  It‚Äôs amazing.‚Äù

She was 25, cheerful, gorgeous, awesome body and we got really along. When we met, Lucy had a boyfriend. Some months after we met she told me they had an open relationship but, even I was really in love with her, I didn't try anything with her because in the past I assumed some ""not interested in me"" signals.

One night in a group party I met Lucy's friend (Amanda, 40, bisexual) and I started going out with her. After some weeks of dating Amanda, Lucy split up with her boyfriend. We were friends, so we three met a couple of times to have some coffee. After one of those coffee times, Amanda told me that she knew Lucy was in love with me. I told her that I doubted that, but I was still in love with Lucy, so I left Amanda some weeks later as I knew our summer-love relationship wasn't going to last (15 years age difference and she lived hundred of miles away).

After that, Lucy and I met a couple of times alone. On the first one we went to the beach and afterwards we went to her place, but we did nothing, even having at one point my head on her lap. On the second one we went to have dinner with some friends of Lucy, and afterwards she took me home with her car. I spent nearly all the car ride thinking about asking her to come to my place, but I didn't because I had the fear she would reject me, even knowing all I have explained.

That was the last time we ever met. I was too afraid to ask her out. Probably she though I was not interested in her. I didn't call her ever again because I was too shy and too ashamed of talking about our ""relationship"".

Last night, 15 years later, it has been the first time I have dreamed about her. We were in different situations, always surrounded by friends: in the street, at the university... we talked about how awesome it would have been if we had ever been in a relationship.

I have woken up almost crying. Even I am married right now, I still miss her. A lot. It was one of the best years of my life the one I spent ""with"" her.

I was thinking about emailing (yes, I'm that old) or texting her just to leave this regret feeling out of my chest and tell her what I felt (and feel) about her. I don't know if it's a vault I want to open.",0,1753771732.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,0.5,False

It was painful, a harsh slap to the face, but at least it happened early in my life, and that‚Äôs a good thing. Some people spend years before going through something like this.

Okay, let‚Äôs begin.

I developed feelings for a girl at my university. She worked there ‚Äî she‚Äôs a bit older than me, but only by a few months. She helped me during my final year. She‚Äôs kind, beautiful, and super friendly with everyone ‚Äî very extroverted. That can be both a blessing and a curse.

Now, normally I‚Äôm not the type to get involved with girls or chase after them. I always stayed away from that stuff. But sometimes, a certain girl comes into your mind and heart, and any guy who has felt this knows how emotions can destroy everything. For two weeks straight, I couldn‚Äôt think about anything but her.

Eventually, we got to know each other more. We followed each other on Instagram, chatted, and exchanged memes. I was naive ‚Äî I genuinely thought she felt the same way. I later realized I was wrong. But back then, everything felt perfect.

Let me pause the story here and explain something about her. She‚Äôs very open-minded, from an upper-class background. She mostly speaks English because she went to an international school. That wasn‚Äôt an issue for me. She liked dark/racist humor memes, swore in English, and was super casual ‚Äî and again, I was totally fine with all of that.

But the downside? She wouldn‚Äôt reply right away. Sometimes she‚Äôd disappear for a while, and it bothered me how she didn‚Äôt see a problem riding alone in an Uber with a guy. (Please don‚Äôt judge me too quickly ‚Äî just hear me out and try to understand my feelings.)

Anyway, I finally got the courage to confess my feelings. I was tired of hiding it. If she accepted, great. If not, I was ready to move on. I told her I loved her.

She said okay ‚Äî but after I graduate. She also said I‚Äôm not in the friendzone and gave some mixed signals. But overall, I was happy and hopeful.

We kept talking on WhatsApp for a few days, then went back to Instagram. One day, I noticed she changed her profile picture, so I messaged her. I thought she would respond, especially since she said she had feelings too. But she didn‚Äôt reply at all or even react. Then four days later, she posted a story ‚Äî so she clearly saw my message. I got frustrated and ignored her for two full weeks.

During that time, we had just finished a project discussion for a course. I posted a story with my friends, and I hadn‚Äôt been watching her stories or reacting at all. Out of nowhere, she liked my story and messaged me the next day, sending memes. She said, ‚ÄúI would‚Äôve sent you more if I knew you weren‚Äôt busy.‚Äù
(I know you‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚ÄúWhat a fool,‚Äù but stay with me.)

I ignored her messages for three days. Then I finally replied ‚Äî but calmly and distant.

Here‚Äôs something odd: she posted a story, deleted it, then reposted the same thing the next day and deleted it again. Then after messaging me, she added me to her ‚Äúclose friends‚Äù and posted that same story again ‚Äî but deleted it 10 minutes later. I didn‚Äôt understand what that meant, and when I asked, she vaguely said it was just pointing at something, but I didn‚Äôt ask again.

We got back to talking. Things felt normal again. Then came a shocking moment ‚Äî her dad passed away. May he rest in peace. I offered my condolences, of course. Later, she messaged me asking to meet up for coffee, to help her forget and distract herself.

We had a great day together ‚Äî cinema, coffee, talking.

We ended up going out four times. She invited me once, I invited her once, we exchanged gifts ‚Äî everything seemed fine.

Then I confessed again. I told her seriously that I loved her. She said, ‚ÄúOkay, give me 3 days and I‚Äôll let you know ‚Äî but only if you‚Äôre not talking to other girls or seeing me as a second option.‚Äù

Three days later, she said ‚Äúokay‚Äù and confirmed her feelings. But still, whenever we went out, she‚Äôd say things like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how I feel toward you yet ‚Äî maybe I need more time with you to figure it out.‚Äù

She would get jealous, hold my hand, rest her head on my chest or shoulder, but the words she used still sounded like we were ‚Äújust friends.‚Äù

The last time we went out, everything seemed normal and fine. The day after that, still okay. The following day, I sent her a meme ‚Äî and boom, she blocked me.

I was shocked.

I checked her bio ‚Äî she had removed it. What the hell? She always said she was honest and didn‚Äôt ghost or block people. She said she doesn‚Äôt treat people like second options.

She hadn‚Äôt blocked me on Instagram, though. I waited a day. Then the next day, I tried calling her ‚Äî no answer. I kept trying, nothing. By the end of that day, I sent her 3 Instagram messages saying basically:

‚ÄúIf silence is your answer, then forget about the relationship.‚Äù

The next day, she called me. Said two words. Then the call cut off from her end. I tried calling back many times. Nothing. I felt like I had the right to know why. What did I do wrong? I‚Äôm not someone who likes drama.

Then she blocked all calls from me.

I messaged her from another number, saying it‚Äôs me, just wanting to understand. Then she unfollowed me on Instagram.

At that point, you can say whatever you want about me ‚Äî but I felt crushed. My dignity felt dragged through the dirt.

I honestly thought she was different from the others. Thought she was mature. But turns out, she was just a kid ‚Äî even more immature than the rest.

I know I lowered myself. But I had the right to ask why. I feel broken, guilty, even stupid for being in this relationship in the first place. There were so many red flags. But any guy knows how emotions can cloud your mind.

Anyway, thank God ‚Äî I got the slap early. I still have the army ahead, work, and life. Yes, I‚Äôm sad. But I‚Äôm better off than others. And honestly, screw it ‚Äî the most important thing I‚Äôve learned is this:

Focus on yourself. No one‚Äôs going to be there for you like you will.

I realized that at this age, people can seem like they love you like crazy. But inside them? They‚Äôre filled with doubts.
So work on yourself ‚Äî it‚Äôs the better investment.



Btw she stold me about her 2 exes she said she never had official relationship with them before but she blocked one of them and the other ghosted her ....

Picked up a used ""just needs a few parts"" Ena 4 off FB marketplace, (older model with the rotary knob) and fixed some obvious leaks. All the bits seemed to work, the grinder, the thermoblock made steam/hot water, brew group ran through its cycle, but it would drop barely moist coffee into the tray and dispense no liquid. If I ran a rinse cycle no water ever made it to the dispensing nozzle and only a very small amount would drop in the tray. After every cycle (coffee or rinse) the machine would ask for the tap to open and then dispense 6oz or so of hot water while displaying ""filling"" on the display. No errors were ever displayed. I removed the brew group and cleaned it, no change. Finally I took apart the flow meter, thinking there might be some debris stuck in it, there wasn't but I did notice the hoses were reversed. The water tank hose was on the outlet side and vice versa. After moving the hoses to the correct ports on the flow meter the machine now behaves normally, dispenses the correct amount of liquid and no longer asks to open the tap. 

Pic of it hooked up correctly, you can faintly see the flow direction arrow on the top outlet nozzle.

1mc45mx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mc45mx,[Homemade] No knead bread for breakfast.,"Such a simple recipe that produces lovely bread for breakfast.  Just mix the ingredients together and leave overnight.  Nice cup of coffee, butter and homemade plum How to make No-Knead Dough

Should be done on a Dutch oven at home. We just happened to be on a campsite.

Recipe is from our best bites. Check out the details there.

‚ÄúSo let me show you in just a few steps how we‚Äôre making this bread.  It starts with all purpose flour, warm water and yeast.  Okay and a little salt, so I guess technically 4 ingredients.

I do want to say something about the flour, here.  I think this recipe does count on people over measuring their flour.  When I actual weigh my flour to get an exact weight for the 3 cups, this dough is extremely wet and loose.  Like, I can‚Äôt form it into a ball, it‚Äôs more of a thick liquid.  And the bread turns out amazing and soft and beautiful.  When I scoop my flour with the measuring cup (something we are constantly telling you not to do,) the dough is still on the wet-sticky side, but it looks more like most people‚Äôs photos of this dough, and you can actually form it into a  ball. And it turns out delicious.  So what I‚Äôm saying is, this dough is extremely flexible.  Try it a few times and see what you like, but don‚Äôt ever get worried it‚Äôs not going to work because it always works!  Just don‚Äôt add tons more flour because you think it should be the consistency of playdough.  Because it shouldn‚Äôt.  Overall your dough should be quite loose and sticky, but feel free to just dunk your measuring cup in your flour bag and haphazardly scoop.  This is one instance where that totally Let the Dough Rest

Once that‚Äôs all mixed up, just cover with plastic, leave on your counter, and come back and visit it tomorrow. It needs to sit for anywhere from 8-18 hours.  I always just mix up the dough the day before, but technically you could do it early in the morning and have it for dinner as well.  Just know the longer it sits, the better the texture will be so I recommend at least 12 At this point you‚Äôll just scrape it all out onto a generously floured surface- I put it directly onto a piece of parchment paper. Remember your dough will be REALLY sticky so sprinkle flour all over it where you‚Äôll be touching it and handle it gently so it doesn‚Äôt get all over you.  Fold it on top of itself a couple times (remember no kneading) and form it into a round-ish shape.  Let it sit for 30 minutes.  During that 30 minutes you will place your empty, covered dutch oven in your oven preheated to a screaming hot 450 degrees.  We‚Äôre creating our own little bread oven Baking No-Knead Bread

When it‚Äôs preheated you will CAREFULLY (can‚Äôt stress that enough) remove your crazy hot pan from the oven, transfer your bread into it, and place the lid on.  DON‚ÄôT FORGET YOUR LID IS PIPING HOT.  I always keep a towel over the handle while it‚Äôs on my counter just to be safe.  Pop that pot back into the oven to bake.  You can see I just lift my whole parchment paper that my bread was sitting on and put it into the pot. about 40 minutes later your house will smell like a straight-up European

This bread has a super crispy crust and a chewy soft inside. It‚Äôs the kind of bread you rip off in chunks and slather with butter while it‚Äôs still warm, or dunk in a bowl of soup, or dip in olive oil.  It‚Äôs amazing.‚Äù

**Good morning, and I hope everything is well.**

I played retail WoW from WotLK to Dragonflight but I quit after realizing I was holding onto false hope that Blizzard would someday bring back the true *Warcraft* feeling. That ship has long since sailed.

I stopped playing during Dragonflight Season 1, so it‚Äôs been a while. In the meantime, I‚Äôve gone back to my favorite games outside of WoW: *Tibia*, *Diablo II*, and *The Witcher 3* ‚Äì slow-paced games with a deep, immersive feel and something unique about them that I love.

Yesterday, I tried TurtleWoW for the first time, and I was amazed ‚Äì not just because it's my first time playing Classic, but also because of the people and the overall feel of the game. I made it through the Tauren starting zone and left with five or more people added to my friends list. I had an absolute blast. I played with a smile on my face and logged out already eager to return the next day. The world feels alive, and you feel like a small and fragile part of it. Getting upgrades feels meaningful, and the community is friendly.

I work a lot during the week, so I‚Äôll probably be a weekend gamer when I‚Äôm not with friends or doing something else. That means TurtleWoW will be a very slow journey for me and that‚Äôs exactly how I want it. My current goal is to reach level 60; when I get there, I‚Äôll set a new one.

My in-game name is Osci. I‚Äôm playing from EU on my Tauren Druid. Feel free to add me ‚Äì and if there‚Äôs a guild out there with an active social vibe that doesn‚Äôt mind me talking about the works of J.R.R. Tolkien or music ranging from Johnny Cash to Pink Floyd, Ozzy Osbourne, Dire Straits, Iron Maiden, and Oasis etc... feel free to hit me up!

This whole post might come off as a bit odd, but I just felt like doing a bit of positive venting and showing some gratitude while I wait for my coffee to finish brewing.

I‚Äôm a bit confused because I tried to tap when I got a binge urge and I only tapped for about a minute and then gave in to the urge. I don‚Äôt know if I gave up and binged because it was 1.30pm and I had only had coffee with milk and sugar, and a spoon of psyllium husks or if I‚Äôd kept tapping I could have overcome the urge.


I also struggle to know when to switch from the ‚Äúeven though I want to binge I love and accept myself‚Äù statements to positive afffirmations like ‚ÄúI am healthy‚Äù. And is it essential to finish with the positive affirmations or is the even though statements good enough?

Also can I say the statements in my head silently if others are around?",1,1753770263.0,EFT_tapping,0,1.0,False

This may all read a little bit unstructured but I guess that properly represents on what is going on in my head. I‚Äôm afraid I kinda already know where this is heading but it is really killing me on the inside. So.. a little backstory.

My GF comes from quite a painful divorce with a narcistic ex with a dude that emotionally and psychologically abuses their children. Obviously this takes a big toll on her and I am aware this will never go (fully) away. I‚Äôm the type of person that does not run away (or give up easily) and I have been helping her with everything every step of the way. I could write pages about this but felt just this bit might provide a bit of context.

Our schedule is not ideal, (either she or I has children in the weekends for example) so we have limited time we can spend together and here is where the nagging feeling in the back of my head starts. Recently the summer period has started and the first weekend of this period was the first time in about 6 months we both did not have any children. Turns out she made plans with several people (Female friends) and kinda forgot about me that I might want to spent time with here. Whenever such things like these occurs she always pulls a ‚ÄúI need space‚Äù card instead of acknowledging I might be a person who has needs too.

Anyway, one week further. She gets her kids during the summer vacation and we have seen each other twice. A (female) friend joined there vacation home and I was not allowed to visit, she told me if I visited, the boyfriend of the other female friend might want to visit too which might impact her autistic daughter and once again the I need space card was pulled. This was a tough pill to swallow for me. I mean, I do everything for her, her kids like me and all I wanted to do was have a cup of coffee or eat something together (Including the children ofcourse).

So, last Saturday, her kids go to their dad and my kids arrived. Her being around my kids has never been an issue from my, or her, side and she has stayed over in the past while my kids are here, which everyone seemed to enjoy. However, since she no longer has kids and has time available considering she still has vacation from work, I have proposed twice now to do some stuff and, you guessed it, already has plans with (female) friends. So I decided to just.. not ask here and let the initiative be with her. So far.. crickets.

I am wondering if this is all in my head and I make things in my head bigger then they are. It just feels so awful that I have always made my self available to do fun stuff (or not fun stuff) and now it feels like I am on the bottom off the priority list (if I am even on the priority list at all) and I don‚Äôt know what to do. It is summer period here and should be abou the best time of the year with time available, nice weather, etc. If I ask her to do something fun I will most likely get rejected again. If I share that is not cool the I need space card properly gets pulled and it feels like I am just in a lose -lose situation at the moment. 

Or am I just being taken advantage of? The dude that will turn up when shit hits the fan or something needs to get done?

Or am I just an asshole because I feel ""entitled"" to get some quality time?",3,1753770128.0,AITAH,2,0.81,False
