Last night I bought the Ascaso Duo V2 PID. I have time to return, but for $1,900 I don’t know if I made the right choice for what’s out there.

Here is how it will be used and my needs:
	•	Morning: two drinks of double espresso. One will mainly be iced coffee while the Wife will make hers with steamed milk later that morning.
	•	Weekends: two back to back drinks – one iced and one with steamed milk
	•	Able to heat quickly. Mornings are always a rush, I prefer not to buy a plug to turn on.
	•	20AMP is no problem
	•	I do not need the most powerful steamer
	•	Maintenance reputation
	•	Ease of programming heat for different roasts
	•	Pressure adjustment
	•	Pre-infusion?

Some cons I feel about the Ascaso
	•	Vibration: videos show cups going all over the place with this one
	•	Noise: sounds loud

Now for the Grinder. My budget for a grinder is around $500. Again, there are soo many.
Please provide me with some good options that has a good reputation for it lasting.

I need to note that she’s been divorced from her cheating ex-husband for around 8 years and they have 3 kids together 23 F, 17 M, and 11 M.
Her husband does not live in the same country and doesn’t pay child support so she is the soul provider for her family. So when she came to visit us it was a way for her to relax and for us to treat her to a lot of things she doesn’t get to do. We live right next to the beach so she would go swimming every morning by herself as we would be busy. On the last day of her stay she meet a guy in his early 30’s and she liked him a lot although me and my family felt he was sketchy but she didn’t care and in the evening he invited her out for coffee and then he asked if she wasn’t to get a hotel but she declined thankfully. That’s been less that I mouth ago and they have been talking online this whole time and today she posted that he proposed and she said yes. That’s were I got mad at her and told her to not to rush things as she barely knows her and that his salary is very little so he wouldn’t be able to provide for her and that it’s weird that he proposed so fast. Something to know it that my aunt owns her apartment and that if they get married he can get a passport in a few years from the country we are from as his passport is not the best. My aunt had a few relationships in the past that ended badly because she gets attached fast and they don’t want to be in serious relationships. So AITAH for telling her not to rush into it and to take more time thinking about things before they do anything serious and that she is acting like a child because she has responsibilities, and kids to consider and that he doesn’t feel trust worthy? I also want to add that he wants her to travel to the country that I live in so they can get married by this new years 2024-2025 and then he wants her to make him a visa to come live with her. No one in our family knows except me and my mom and he’s daughter and we are all against it but she says it true love and doesn’t listen to anyone.

It all started three weeks ago when I matched with Sarah on Bumble. Her profile pics were gorgeous – she had this genuine smile that made her green eyes sparkle, and her bio was witty without trying too hard. Right away, there was something different about our conversations. We clicked on everything from our shared love of true crime podcasts to our mutual hatred of pineapple on pizza. When she mentioned she had some vision problems that sometimes made it hard to navigate new places, I didn't think much of it. Lots of people wear glasses or have astigmatism, right? She was super independent and worked as a content writer, so I figured it couldn't be that serious.
Our text conversations got deeper over the next couple of weeks, and I found myself checking my phone way more often than I'd like to admit. Sarah was smart, funny, and seemed genuinely interested in getting to know me. We'd talk for hours about random stuff – she'd send me music recommendations, and I'd share stupid memes that made her laugh. When she told me about her job writing for different websites, she mentioned using some special software to help her work more efficiently, but again, I didn't think too much about it. Everyone uses different tools to make their work easier, and she was crushing it in her career. The more we talked, the more I looked forward to meeting her in person. We'd video chatted a few times, but the lighting was always kind of dim, and she said her camera wasn't great. Looking back, I should've picked up on these little signs, but when you're vibing with someone, you tend to overlook the small stuff.
Finally, after what felt like forever but was actually just sixteen days of constant messaging, we decided to meet up. Sarah suggested I pick her up from her place, which she explained was a shared living space with some other young professionals. She gave me the address, and I spent way too long picking out what to wear and making sure my car was clean. When I pulled up to the address she'd given me, I noticed it wasn't your typical apartment complex. There was a sign out front that read ""Vista Independent Living Community for the Visually Impaired."" My heart started racing as I parked the car, trying to process what I was seeing. This wasn't just a regular shared living space – it was a specialized facility. I sat there for a few minutes, debating whether I should text her that I'd arrived or just drive away. But I'd already sent the ""here"" message, and I wasn't the type to ghost someone.
As I waited in the lobby, my mind was racing with questions. A staff member approached me with a friendly smile and asked if I was there to see Sarah. When I nodded, she started casually chatting about how excited Sarah had been about our date, mentioning how rare it was for residents to connect with people from ""outside the community."" That's when she dropped the bomb – almost like it was common knowledge – about how well Sarah had been adapting to losing 90% of her vision over the past few years. I felt like I'd been punched in the gut. This wasn't just some minor vision problem; Sarah was legally blind. The staff member must have noticed my shocked expression because she quickly changed the subject, but the damage was already done. I was standing there processing this massive piece of information when Sarah appeared in the doorway, navigating the space with practiced ease but definitely not moving like someone with just ""some vision problems.""
Sarah looked beautiful, just like in her photos, but now I noticed things I hadn't before – the slightly unfocused way her eyes moved, how her hand trailed along the wall as she walked, the way she tilted her head slightly to use her remaining peripheral vision. She had a huge smile on her face as she approached, and I managed to say hello without letting my voice shake. We decided to walk to a nearby café she knew well, and during that short walk, I observed how she navigated the world. She didn't use a cane, but she definitely had memorized the route and moved with careful precision. At the café, she knew exactly where everything was, suggesting she came there often. We ordered drinks, and as we sat down, I could feel the tension building inside me. The conversation was strained – not at all like our easy flowing texts – because all I could think about was the massive thing she hadn't told me.
Finally, after about an hour of awkward small talk, I couldn't take it anymore. I asked her directly why she hadn't been honest about the extent of her vision impairment. Sarah's face fell, and she took a deep breath before explaining. She told me about how dating apps were already hard enough, but when you add a disability into the mix, it becomes nearly impossible. She talked about how guys would either immediately unmatch when she mentioned being visually impaired, or worse, treat her like she was helpless. She just wanted a chance for someone to get to know her as a person first, before making assumptions about what she could or couldn't do. She explained how she was still independent, had a successful career, and lived a full life – her vision was just one part of who she was.
I sat there listening, trying to understand her perspective while also dealing with my own feelings of betrayal. Part of me got it – I probably would have swiped left if I'd known the full extent of her condition right away, and that realization made me feel like a terrible person. But another part of me was angry about being deceived. We'd spent weeks talking, sharing personal stories, building what I thought was a genuine connection, and she'd kept this huge part of her life hidden. It wasn't just about the vision impairment anymore; it was about trust. How could we build anything real if we were starting from a place of deception? The coffee in front of me had gone cold, and the cozy café suddenly felt suffocating.
After her explanation, we sat in uncomfortable silence. Sarah reached for her cup, her hand searching for a moment before finding it – a small gesture that somehow made everything more real. I could see the anxiety on her face as she waited for my response. I wanted to be understanding, to be the kind of person who could look past this and focus on all the things I liked about her. But something had shifted. Every memory of our conversations was now tinted with the knowledge that she hadn't been fully honest with me. The funny stories about her work day, the music she recommended, even her favorite TV shows – everything had a different context now. I found myself wondering what else she might not be telling me, what other aspects of her life she might be downplaying or hiding.
The walk back to her place was even more awkward than our café conversation. When we reached the entrance to her building, I knew I had to make a decision. Part of me felt like a complete jerk for what I was about to do, but I couldn't shake the feeling of betrayal. I told her as gently as I could that while I understood why she'd held back the truth, I couldn't continue seeing someone who'd started our relationship with such a significant deception. Her face crumpled slightly, but she held her composure. She nodded and said she understood, though I could hear the hurt in her voice. As I watched her walk back into the building, I felt a mix of guilt and relief. Back in my car, I took out my phone and did something I'd never done before – I blocked her number and unmatched on Bumble without any further explanation.
The drive home was filled with second-guessing and self-doubt. Was I being too harsh? Was I letting my pride get in the way of something that could have been special? I kept thinking about all our great conversations, her laugh, the way she seemed to just get me. But then I'd remember the feeling of walking into that facility, of realizing that everything I thought I knew about her was only partially true. When I got home, I found myself opening and closing dating apps, unable to focus on anything else. I texted my best friend about what happened, and his response surprised me. He asked if I would have given Sarah a chance if she'd been upfront from the beginning. The question hit me hard because I honestly didn't know the answer.
Days passed, and I couldn't stop thinking about the whole situation. I went back to our text conversations, reading them with new eyes. There were so many subtle hints I'd missed, moments where she'd almost told me but held back. I started researching about visual impairments, learning about the different types and degrees, about how people adapted and lived independent lives. I learned about the stigma and discrimination people with disabilities faced in the dating world. The more I read, the more I understood Sarah's hesitation to be completely honest. But understanding didn't change the fact that trust had been broken before we'd even really started. Sometimes I caught myself hovering over the block button, wondering if I should unblock her number and reach out, maybe try to understand better. But then I'd remember how it felt to be deceived, and I'd put my phone away.
Two weeks after our date, I was at a different coffee shop when I overheard a conversation between two women about online dating. One was talking about how hard it was to know when to disclose personal information to potential matches. It made me think about all the things I hadn't immediately shared with Sarah – my own insecurities, my family drama, the real reason I'd left my last job. Were these omissions any different from what she'd done? Maybe we all hide parts of ourselves until we feel safe enough to share them. But then again, there's a difference between taking time to open up and actively downplaying something so significant. The whole experience had left me questioning everything about how we present ourselves online, how we choose what to share and what to hide.
In the end, I still don't know if I made the right decision. Part of me thinks I reacted too strongly, that by blocking her I proved exactly why she'd been hesitant to be honest in the first place. Another part of me feels justified in walking away from something that started with dishonesty. What I do know is that the experience changed how I approach online dating. I'm more direct now in my conversations, more upfront about wanting honesty from the beginning. I've also become more aware of my own biases and assumptions. Sarah taught me that there's often more to people's stories than what they initially share, and sometimes the reasons for holding back are more complex than simple deception. Maybe someday I'll run into her again, and we can have an honest conversation about everything that happened. Until then, I'm left with the lesson that truth and trust, even in the early stages of dating, matter more than I'd realized.",0,1731103376.0,AmIOverreacting,1,0.5,False

38F 5""4 SW:161 GW:130

Day 1 (yesterday): First dose of bupropion (1 tablet) left me with a dull headache for most of the day, nothing that kept me from getting things done though. Some weird sinus pressure as well. Moments of extreme tiredness that eventually passed. Felt slightly loopy throughout the day but not overwhelmingly so.  

1/2 tablet of naltrexone/topiramate before bed made me sleep deeply. No other side effects.

Day 2 (today): Same strange loopy feeling all day, also like being slightly high. No headache at all. Drank a few cups of coffee throughout the day (home with a 2 year old). My mouth has felt odd, like numb and metallic tasting. Not really bothersome. I've not felt hungry at all today. Ate a Quest bar this morning at around 6am. Once 1230pm rolled around I made myself have a protein bar. I'm a little concerned I will forget to eat and become faint. Pausing using my peloton bike until the loopiness subsides.

Already a curious experience. I normally take no prescription drugs at all, so this was a big leap for me. I have been bracing myself for extreme side effects but I will stay cautiously optimistic. Though the metformin in week 3 will possibly be a very different experience. 

Postpartum weight has been tough to lose. I hope this helps me.

A few years ago it was the office. Both shows aired during my childhood. I don’t particularly like or care for either of them, but it just occurred to me that Friends is basically based around a third place. The coffee shop. 

It’s just about a group of young adults hanging out at the coffee shop every episode. Us young adults don’t have those third places anymore. No one hangs out in person anymore. Now i know it’s probably also due to social media and now there’s not real “need” to go hang out with people. but I love seeing people in person. I miss having places that are just .. hangout spots. 

Malls still exist sure, but coffee shops only have tables big enough for 2 people now, and libraries are meant to be quiet and don’t really send out fliers saying what services they offer (anymore, i remember getting these when i was a kid). 

I just think the pandemic and isolation and social media kinda caused third places to basically not exist anymore.. and now Friends is becoming a popular show among young adults and it’s really at its core about a group of friends that hang out at a third place.

It beats salary and I’ll gladly take a paycut if it means a company with more work from home days a week. 

I hate how it’s seen as a red flag, that you’re lazy and just looking for a job where you can do nothing all day. I just truly work better in the solitude of my own home with my partner. Not constantly going into some building where I have to squeeze my car between all the jacked up SUVs or hatchbacks everyone decided to use as their main car. Just to come in to greet a dozen strangers in the hall on my way to the room because it’s “polite”. Then get to the room and have to adjust the dumb office chair and monitor  because someone left behind in the most uncomfortable position possible. Doing this so I can get up to get a horrible cup of coffee and again have to greet a dozen people on my way. Can you tell I’m introverted?

As a 25 year old female in IT, I come across all types of people, most of the people are middle aged men. So many different personalities from the most brainrot chatty people to temper tantrum children.  I’m sorry you hate your life at home so much that you would rather hang out all day with buddies your age and make jokes or vent endlessly about some collegues who told you off. Even though I despise how disruptive working at the office is, I also can’t stand teams where the vibe is silence, heads down and only work related conversations. 

I like home because we can work in peace but we can also make jokes at times and chat a bit. There is balance, with chatty or tantrum collegues there is no balance. Everyone you meet at the office is unique but they are also too much of whatever their characteristics are. 
A bit chatty? Means too chatty, chatty all day, will absolutely not let you get work done or a word in! 
A bit negative? Means too negative, looks for problems all day and cusses everyone and everything out all day long. 
A bit loud? Too loud, all the damn day, yelling in the teamscalls as if they want to hear their echo repeat itself to them.
A bit full of themselves? Means too full of themselves, you’ll hear little stories about their day and how important they are as the main characters in all the stories, constant boasting all day long.

I just wish introverted people were taken as seriously with their needs are extroverts are.

1gmu94z,https://i.redd.it/3umor59y1rzd1.jpeg,Cross Contamination Movement ,"I created this flyer because I am so tired of accidentally getting sick from oat milk at coffee shops. Oat milk has become so popular, but for those of us with celiac disease or gluten sensitivities, it’s a real problem. I reached a point where I stopped going to coffee shops altogether because the risk just wasn’t worth it anymore. It’s exhausting constantly explaining myself, and honestly, I usually ended up getting glutened anyway. I’m not okay with it anymore—we shouldn’t have to deal with this. It’s time for people to be educated about celiac disease and the dangers of cross-contamination. We need to create a change, and that change starts with us. By helping others understand the issue, we can make a world of difference with simple solutions.

We’ve already given up enough restaurants and social food spaces because of celiac disease. It’s frustrating and isolating to constantly worry about cross-contamination and not being able to safely enjoy a meal out. Now, coffee shops are becoming another place we feel nervous about, all because of the rising popularity of oat milk and its potential to be cross-contaminated. This shouldn’t be the case. We deserve to be able to walk into any coffee shop and have a safe, enjoyable experience, just like everyone else. It’s time to raise awareness. We shouldn’t have to choose between a cup of coffee with a friend and our well-being.

Let’s start the #CrossContaminationMovement! Share this flyer however you want—on social media, sending it to your favorite local coffee shop, printing it for them to have on hand, or whatever else feels right. If you’re as frustrated as I am, let’s teach them together!

I (21f) have just escaped my parents, after finding something horrifying in my dad’s beach house. 

I've always loved mermaids.

Yes, I was one of those kids obsessed with everything mermaid—whether that was TV shows, movies, books—any marine-related media, really, but mermaids especially.

I loved everything about the sea, about water, until I almost drowned on my fifth birthday. 

So, with a newfound fear of even dipping my toes in the shallows, I became fascinated with fake water instead. 

Mom called it a mental illness. (I can see where she was coming from, considering I asked for every pool or water-related game ever made.) But I was just a kid.

I preferred water to land, and even terrified of it, I still wanted to submerge myself in it, imagining a whole other world. 

I barely remember almost drowning, only the contorting fear twisting inside me and swallowing me up, the inability to speak, my voice cruelly torn away, my breath stolen as I sank further into the abyss—also known as the deep end of our neighbor’s pool. 

Mom said I didn’t realize it was that deep since I was used to our own pool.

There I was, sitting on the edge with my legs swinging and a plate of birthday cake in my hands, when I had the bright idea to show the adults how cute I was. 

This is my mom’s retelling, so it's probably exaggerated, but apparently, I dropped headfirst into the pool, cake and all, and sank straight to the bottom. 

Dad dove in after me, pulling me back to the surface, dragging me from the shallows. 

But it was too late.

I was screaming, hysterical, backing away from the pool like it was filled with lava. 

The crazy thing is, I remember this exact feeling. I remember staggering back, the ice-cold breeze tickling my cheeks feeling wrong compared to the warmth of the water that was supposed to protect me. 

The ice cold concrete of my neighbor’s patio felt *wrong*. 

Land felt wrong. 

The water, that had almost killed me, felt *right*, and I could never understand why. 

Instead of caressing me, this cruel underwater world had dragged me down, down, down, squeezing my lungs and stealing my air, crushing instead of cradling me. I avoided water and didn’t go near any pool after that, even ours; the very one I used to spend every spare hour splashing around in. 

When Mom tried to bathe me, I insisted on the water being ankle-deep, with her using a cup to rinse my hair as I tilted my head back, squeezing my eyes shut. 

According to Mom, I would scream until my throat was raw if there was too much water. 

Even washing my hands and brushing my teeth, I remember timing the flow just right, so I could stick my toothbrush or soapy hands under, count three elephants, and then dive out of the bathroom. I flooded the floors on multiple occasions when I forgot to turn off the faucet. 

But still, somehow, I was fascinated with water itself. 

I loved how it was still, how it ran and trickled and filled my cupped hands…. 

According to Mom, I told my therapist I wanted to be a fish.

However, my therapist had a sort of resolution. She leaned forward and grabbed my hands, squeezing them tight. 

*“Okay, Sadie, well, if you're scared of real water, why don’t you try fake water?”*

Which, I guess, is how my mermaid obsession started.

My therapist started me with little kids’ games about solving puzzles underwater—and immediately, I was hooked. 

Through my fascination with digital water, I found mermaids—beautiful, human-like fish people who could breathe underwater, living in vast, towering cities deep, deep under the sea. 

I watched every Little Mermaid, bingeing mermaid-themed movies and TV shows. 

By the age of nine, I was fully convinced I was actually a mermaid, and touching water would magically transform my legs into a tail.

It didn’t, obviously, so I did what any supposedly mentally ill nine-year-old would do. I swallowed two teaspoons of salt mixed with tears of terror before sticking my head underwater for ten seconds.

Again, nothing happened.

But I was starting to slowly overcome my fear of being submerged in water, so I lowered myself onto the stairs in the shallow end of our pool and forced myself to get used to it.

I was still acclimating when my brother shoved my head under, quickly reminding me of that sensation—the squeezing of my chest, the inability to breathe, choking on bubbles exploding around me. After that, Dad insisted on teaching me how to swim. 

Like me, he’d always been fascinated with water, so he refused to have a child who couldn’t swim. Before my older brother and I were even born, he enrolled us in lessons. Harvey was five years older than me, so he could already swim. Dad wanted to take me to the sea, though I was more comfortable in the pool.

However, my swimming classes were short-lived (I barely learned how to keep my head afloat) when Dad left in the middle of the night and never came back. But… neither did my brother.

I woke up around midnight to Mom hysterically crying. I discovered the next morning that Dad had taken my brother hookah diving without proper equipment, and Harvey was in the emergency room. 

Initially, I was told my brother was very sick, which, obviously, I believed. 

I was playing Sonic with my brother only yesterday! In my head, he was just sick in the hospital.

I spent the day expecting him to drag himself into my bedroom at any time, knock something over, call me a name, and run away. But the house was empty. 

Mom didn't come out of her room. 

Not even to take me to school. Instead, I watched Cartoon Network all day. I poked my head in my brother’s room, and it was a noticeable mess, clothes strewn everywhere and a half-packed suitcase.

When I asked to see Harvey a few days later, Mom told me he was dead.

Brain-dead, at least.

She explained it the best she could, choking on her own words.

Harvey had gone too deep, and when trying to resurface, his blood had bubbles and his brain had popped.

I don’t think she was mentally okay enough to explain to her nine-year-old daughter that her brother was dead. 

Yeah, no, considering she used our soda stream and a grape to demonstrate the accident with a hysterical smile on her mouth, almost like she thought it was funny. I didn't find it funny. 

Watching the bubbles in the water and my mother pop a grape between her index and thumb with a huge grin on her face was actually fucking traumatising. 

I know people grieve in their own way. Even as a kid though, I was confused when my brother didn’t get a funeral. 

Dad did come back, but only to try and justify his trip with Harvey. He said it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that he was just doing what was best for his kids.

I already despised him for taking my brother away, but the way he talked about him, insisting that “Harvey loves the water!” made me want to scream. 

He was *wrong.* While I was obsessed with water, my brother had steered away from it, especially the sea. Mom called him a psycho and threw him out.

Dad moved to the other side of town, and it was just Mom and me once again.

For a long time, I hated my father. I ignored his letters, calls, texts, and the mermaid figurines he sent me for my birthday. I didn’t understand grieving, and worse, post-grieving.

Did such a thing exist? 

I understood that I was sad, and sometimes I was happy—before feeling guilty for catching myself smiling. 

I missed him, so I got a diary. I wrote to my brother, telling him everything and nothing, sometimes just what I did that day, or telling him how mom was.

I started attending group therapy. 

One girl said she forgave her father for killing her mother in a car crash but her words became entangled in my mind, frustrating me, bleeding into confusion and anger I  couldn't control. 

How could she forgive something like that? I asked her after, and she shrugged and said, “It wasn't his fault.” 

“But it *was* my dad’s fault,” I told her, leaning forward in my chair. “He killed my brother.”

The girl, Mia, I think her name was (I could never read her name-tag– it was either Mia, or Mira) folded her arms, shooting me a glare. “Well, maybe you should forgive him.”

When I asked Mom in the car on the way home, she said the exact same thing. 

“It was an accident, Sadie,” Mom said. “Your father took your brother diving, and he wasn't ready.” She averted her gaze, her hands tightening around the wheel. “Harvey asked him to take him out during a storm.”

Something ice cold trickled down my spine. “But you said—”

She said Harvey didn't want to go diving.

There wasn't a storm that night. I would have heard it.

She said my brother hated the ocean, and he wanted no part of it.

Mom’s eyes darkened, and she opened her mouth like she was going to speak, before changing the subject, flicking on the radio. “Do you want to get takeout tonight?”

I wanted to question her, but I didn't even know what to ask.

But then I was questioning my own memories.

Did Mom say what I remembered, or did I mishear her?

It took me a long time to realize maybe Harvey's death wasn't Dad’s fault after all.

After a while of therapy, and listening to other kids’ stories, I started to wonder if hating him was the right thing to do. 

Mom was talking to him civilly, at least. The two of them met for coffee every Saturday, and Mom seemed like she had genuinely forgiven him. 

The other kids asked me if my Mom was *over* Harvey’s death. But I guess laughing was inappropriate. “Grieving is an individual emotion!” Mr. Prescott, our therapist, kept saying, when I was on my knees giggling into the prickly carpet. 

Was my mother over my brother’s death? *Yes, of course she was!* 

That's what I told my friends, who I made sure stayed far away from our house. 

Mom was *fine*, I told everyone. 

She was completely fine, and definitely *not* slowly losing her mind, insisting on buying a giant aquarium for her room and named her new pet flounder fish Harvey. 

*Mom isn't crazy*, I told myself, which became my mantra. 

She just had her own way of grieving. 

Besides, I did like Harvey. 

He was pretty cool for a fish, always waiting for me behind the glass when I got home from school. 

*Mom isn't crazy.*

That's what I told myself (again) when I caught her opening the tank and trying to fish Harvey out of the water to hold him. Unlike other fish though, he didn't freak out or squirm, instead staying cupped in her hands. 

So, no, I finally admitted to my therapy class, bursting into tears. 

Mom definitely *wasn't* over my brother. I was eleven years old, and my mother was on the brink of a breakdown. 

She worked all day every day, and on weekends all she talked about was either work, or Harvey the fish, often pausing so *he* could join in conversations.

Sometimes, she asked him, “How's school?” 

I had to quietly remind her that the fish wasn't actually my brother. 

I needed something– someone– normal. 

I found ‘normal’ in the family pool, enveloping myself in my comfort zone. 

Over the years, I taught myself how to swim, envisioning my tail again. 

In my mind, I could swim away from my family, and never go back. 

Unfortunately, I was old enough to know mermaids weren't real.

The only connection I *did* have with the ocean was with Harvey.

Dad called every day inviting me to visit. 

I always declined. I wasn't interested in his shiny new life. Dad was an architect, and had designed his own house by the sea. 

I ignored him until my twelfth birthday, when he sent a text which just said, **“Happy Birthday, pumpkin! I have a surprise for you, but you're going to have to come see it yourself. Our door is always open, Sadie. You're going to love them!”**

I wasn't exactly ecstatic. 

Dad’s new girlfriend, who was half his age, smelled like red tide when she came to visit, and I wasn't looking forward to the awkward conversation I would be having with my father. If I'm honest, though, part of me was intrigued by the photos Mom showed me. 

So, ignoring my therapist, who said, “Just give it a little more time,” I rode my bike to his beach house after school.

Dad’s place teetered on the sea, designed to blend with the ocean itself. 

On the edge of a cliff, with grandiose pillars (which were way too much), lay my father’s house, cut off from the rest of the town, and definitely showing off his wealth. 

I wasn't expecting it to be so modern. French doors leading me inside sported beta fish carvings, an axolotl in a fifty gallon tank greeting me with its trademark smile. I was hesitant at first. 

If I fully walked inside, I wouldn't be able to leave without having a painful conversation with my father.  

But running away seemed childish—even for a soon to be twelve year old.

I admit, I was impressed. 

If *these* were the lengths he'd gone to get my attention, well, he had me hook, line, and sinker. Dad had designed his house to resemble an aquarium. 

The hallway was illuminated with a soft blue light, every wall a different tank filled with a variety of fish. It was almost like being in real-life Animal Crossing. 

Farther down, glass floors mimicked the deep ocean, filled with tiny flounder swimming below.

I've always been afraid of heights, so stepping on flooring resembling the deep ocean, twisted my gut, and yet filled me with exhilaration. Like stepping across an underwater world. It was both beautiful, and *way* over the top. But that was Dad’s mo. 

We always had to have the *best* pool when I was a kid. 

“Sadie?” Dad’s voice startled me when I was staring, transfixed by everything around me. I didn't know what to look at first. Everything was *water* themed. 

Even the stairs. It was pretty, sure, but it didn't look *lived* in. The walls were filled with fish, a beautiful display of marine life showcased on every corner. I found myself pressed up against schools of nemo fish spiralling in scarlet streams, stealing away my breath. Beautiful. 

But there was nothing that made this house a home– stained coffee cups and magazines strewn all over the floor. 

That was Mom’s house. 

Dad’s was more like a museum. 

I was intrigued by the kitchen lit up in a bioluminescent glow, slowly inching towards it, when Dad’s voice came again.

This time, from underneath me. “I'm in the basement, sweetie!”

I had half a mind to run. It hit me that I didn't want to see my father, I just wanted to see my surprise. The teenage brain is selfish, but I had my reasons. 

Still, though, I found myself drawn to the basement, my sneakers making smacking noises down the steps. 

Unlike upstairs, the lower levels of Dad’s house were yet to be renovated. 

Thinking of the death star, there was no stair rail. My hands grazed cold brick walls, before darkness became ocean blue, like walking on the seafloor. 

The low hum of a filtration system cut through the silence, my steps quickening. 

The basement was not what I was expecting; a simple room with one singular tank. 

The stink of seawater and bleach drowned my nose and throat, both clinical and otherworldly, forcing my legs further. Dad stood in front, grinning beneath a banner saying, “Happy 12th birthday!”

I was already taking steps forward, my body in control of my mind. 

The tank was darker than the others, tiny green lights at the bottom illuminating clear water. 

I could barely register Dad’s words, my gaze glued to the glass. 

His voice sounded like ocean waves crashing against the shore, wading in and out of my ears. “I asked my friends for a favor,” he said. “They specialise in marine research, and…well, during their last expedition, they found something incredible, Sadie.” 

Dad’s grin was contagious, and in three strides, I was pressing my face against the glass. I don't know what I was expecting. Was it a new species of fish? 

“They're shy.” Dad hummed. “Just stay there, and they'll come over to you.”

I found my voice strangled in my throat, my skin prickling with goosebumps. *“They?”*

Something warm expanded in my chest when a face appeared behind the glass—a beautiful girl with long dark hair haloing around her, tiny points on her ears and strange rugged skin. But it wasn't her face I was mesmerised by. 

Yes, she was hypnotising, every part of her seemed to glow, wide green eyes and a glittering smile. I staggered back, a cry clawing at my throat, when I realized she didn't have legs. Instead, a long blue tail was moulded to her torso, each scale intricate and sparkling. 

The skin below her breast was rugged, slits carved into her flesh.

*Gills.*

This couldn't be happening, I thought, dizzily. 

I was staring at a real life mermaid. 

She was so pretty, graceful, gently tapping on the glass, playing an invisible piano with her fingers. 

I was joining in, laughing when the mermaid pressed her fingertips against mine, when movement came behind her, a shadow looming into view. 

It was a boy this time, dark brown hair billowing around him adorned with seaweed, a green tail in place of legs. There was a noticeable scar on his throat. 

It made me wonder if a fish had attacked him. The merman was different. Unlike his female companion, he *wasn’t* smiling, instead folding his arms and refusing to meet my gaze. When he accidentally made eye contact, he turned and flicked his tail in my face, hiding behind the girl. 

Dad laughed. “The male is quite standoffish. Don't worry, he's like that with everybody. He wasn't easy to catch.”

I could barely speak, staring at the girl, who waved, her smile broadening. 

“Uh-huh.” I managed to choke out. 

I didn't notice my father wrapping his arms around me. His touch felt foreign and wrong, but also comforting. 

I hadn't hugged him in so long. I found myself missing him, and the conversation I wanted to have, all of those poisonous words in my throat, contorted into childish squeals of joy. “They're yours, Sadie,” Dad murmured into my hair. 

“I have a deal where I can keep them here for observation, but they're officially *yours*.”

“Mermaids.” I said. 

Dad nodded. “Well, the scientific name for them is HAB, or human-like aquatic beings, but yes,” he chuckled, “They are mermaids.”

Dad paused, striding over to the tank. I noticed the male mermaid flinch, almost immediately swimming over to the glass, tapping his fingers against the pane. 

I joined him, raising my fingers while watching his dark brown curls fly around him, bubbles escaping his mouth when he parted his lips in what I *think* was a greeting. The points in his ears reminded me of fae, and I couldn't stop smiling. 

He looked so human, and yet these tiny details, like his ears, and narrow features, told me he *belonged* in the ocean.

I had dreamed of being able to breathe  underwater, and this boy was doing just that, staring at me with coffee brown eyes. When his head inclined slowly, I couldn't resist a giggle. 

I figured I looked pretty alien to him. 

Dad nudged me playfully. “We haven't figured out their language yet. We know it's quite similar to whales, or even dolphins. It's rare when they do speak, but it's beautiful, Sadie.” 

Dad’s eyes were wide. “It's almost like they're singing the melody of their world: the songs of their people.”

I prodded the glass, and the merman copied, his lips curling into a scowl. 

The female mermaid swam over, shoving him out of the way. 

She seemed more excited, following my fingers excitedly. 

“What do you think you're going to call them?” Dad hummed. 

I turned to him. “They don't have names?”

He shrugged, and then Dad’s expression was my father again, his eyes growing sad, like he remembered why I was here– and just like me, Dad didn't want to talk about my brother. Turning to face the mermaids, his smile faded. 

“They were originally named specimen one and two, but I don't think those names suit them.”

I met the girl’s eyes, and like a child, her smile broke out into a grin. 

While she was wide eyed and smiley, the male mermaid folded his arms, carefully tracking me with his gaze, lip curled, like he could sense me thinking up names. 

I traced the glass, the seaweed entangled in the boy’s hair almost resembling a crown. I half wondered, giddily, if the male was a Prince. 

“Falan.” I said, without thinking, and to my shock, he rolled his eyes. 

Dad cleared his throat. “The male seems to have remarkably similar characteristics to a human male,” he said, “His paperwork suggests he copies human expressions.”

I moved onto the girl, who was playful, tapping her fingers against the glass. 

“Aira.”

The girl nodded excitedly, copying my smile. 

Dad was hesitant this time to touch me, instead clapping me on the shoulder. “I think she likes her name,” he said, heading to the door. “Elle is making pasta, if you want to join us? No pressure, sweetie.”

Dad left me with the mermaids, and admittedly, the first thing I did was jump up and down like a, well, a twelve year old. 

I ate dinner with Dad and his girlfriend that  night, and I waited to have “the talk” but it never came. In fact, when I visited the following weekend, everything I wanted to tell him was suffocated by the beings in his basement. 

I spent hours with the two of them, talking to Aira about everything from school to my worries about my mother
She would nod and try to listen, her eyes wide, like she could understand me. 

I figured that wasn't the case when I lied and told her an asteroid was going to destroy the planet, and she nodded excitedly, lips spreading into a grin. 

Sometimes, she copied me. When I laughed, she did too– or she tried to. 

I don't think it was easy for her under the water. I started missing therapy sessions to spend time with the mermaids, but it was only Aira who engaged with me, always waiting for me when I arrived, sometimes asleep, curled up at the bottom of the tank. 

Falan, meanwhile, completely ignored me, instead spending all of his time either scowling at me, or closer to the surface. 

I caught him trying to swim up several times, only to dive back down, returning to his little spot to continue brooding. 

As I got older, I expected the mermaids to age, too. 

But instead, they seemed to be physically frozen around what looked like the ages of early twenties, judging from their looks. I turned thirteen, and I spent every summer and weekend with them. 

Dad told me to entertain them, try and get them used to human activities, so I introduced them to my phone, pressing it to the glass. 

While Aira seemed impressed (by literally everything), Falan did his signature eye roll, as if saying, *“Oh, wow, it's a weird device with a light! I've already seen one.”*

Dad did say the male mermaid was talented at mimicking human expression, so I figured Falan *had* seen a phone. 

So, in my quest to impress this stubborn merboy, I showed him a TV, and then my Nintendo 3DS. He didn't seem interested in the TV, but his eyes lit up when I showed him Pokémon. 

I think it was the bright colors, but his eyes seemed glued to the screen, following my little character. 

I made an unspoken pact with him. 

I showed him Pokémon, playing it with him every time I visited, and he stopped with the scowling and the rolling of the eyes. 

Falan didn't stop being an asshole, but every time I stepped into the basement, it was *him* who was waiting, eagerly, his face pressed against the glass. 

When he saw me, the merman leaned back, pretending he wasn't waiting for me. I showed him a new game, Zelda, and he surprised me with the smallest of smiles, his eyes glued to my screen. 

Aira sometimes joined us, but she grew bored easily, either falling asleep, or swimming up to the surface. 

After introducing him to video games, Falan was a lot more animated. 

I was fourteen when I dragged myself, once again, to Dad’s beach house. It was my first year of junior high, and I had nobody to talk to about the mermaids. 

When I visited them, Falan was on the surface, leaning against the side, his head comfortably nestled in his arms. 

I noticed the tank was open, so it must have been feeding time. 

Every day around 5pm, Dad opened up the tank, dropping in what looked like mutilated fish guts, and little flakes. 

Falan always ignored the food, while Aira immediately dove for fleshy entrails, stuffing them into her mouth. 

Falan needed a little coaxing, so Dad thrust a long metal pole into the water, gently nudging the merman towards the food. 

That day, there was no sign of my father, and both mermaids were on the surface. 

Falan, with his head in his arms, and Aira, looking lost, her eyes wide. 

It was the first time I had seen her without her excited little grin.

Falan must have sensed me, since his head jerked up when I dropped my backpack on the floor. 

This was the first time I'd seen him fully on the surface, but when he locked eyes with me, I realized he was panting, struggling to breathe, his fingers gingerly prodding at his throat. The air must have been hurting him, I thought.

He wasn't used to our air, so *why* was he so insistent on staying on the surface? 

*Stupid boy.* 

I made my way over to the tank, and to my surprise, he swam over, sticking his head over the side. 

Falan made a choking sound and I understood he was trying (and failing) to mimic our language. He tried again, his eyes strained, lips parting, but no words came out, only strange guttural noises I could almost mistake for words. 

This happened twice. 

The second time, the tank was half shut, but Falan broke the surface when he saw me come in, parted his lips, and tried to speak, seemingly frustrated with his inability to mimic human speech. He tried again, and this time l could see he was visibly struggling to stay on the surface. 

Aira, to my confusion, pulled him back under the water, and to me, pointed upwards. I did my best to communicate with her, just like dad told me. I had to speak with my hands instead of my mouth. 

“You want me to open the tank?” I said, motioning upwards. 

“Sadie.” 

Dad joined me, carrying a bucket full of entrails. 

He dumped the food in the tank and shut the lid all the way, flashing me a smile. 

“I know they're pretty to look at, but they're also dangerous.” he nodded to Falan, who ignored the food, instead pressed against the glass, glaring at my father. “These beings are carnivores, sweetie. I don't mean to scare you, but I don't think swimming with them would be a whole lot of fun.” 

I found myself nodding, watching sharp red dilute the depths, Aira snatching up tangled fish intestine. 

I watched her eat it, sharp incisors biting through a cloud of red obscuring my vision and spreading around her. 

The smile on her face no longer looked playful. She looked happy to be eating, and something ice cold trickled down my spine when her eyes met mine, this time not with curiosity, but something else entirely, something I was in denial of. 

After that day, I guess I started to grow up. The mermaids in my Dad’s basement were beautiful, yes, but all signs pointed to them also trying to lure me into their tank. Dad didn't say *they will eat you*, but he did supervise my visits from then on, making sure I kept my distance. 

The two of them didn't change, but my childhood fantasy of friendly fish people darkened to a more plausible reality. 

Falan and Aira were not my friends, nor were they my presents. 

I was the naive prey who was almost fish food. 

I stopped visiting after Falan started gesturing me inside their tank. 

I wanted nothing to do with them. 

Growing up, I still saw them during holidays. 

But the basement was filling up with other things, my dad's belongings and my toys from childhood. 

I saw them once before college, the two of them slamming themselves against the tank when I walked in. 

I couldn't tell if they were excited or hungry. Aira’s eyes were almost sad, her lips parting as if to say, *You left us*.

Falan tapped the glass, cocking his head. I noticed his scar was bigger. 

Maybe Dad accidentally caught it when he was coaxing the merman to his food. 

I think Falan knew it was a goodbye. 

He didn't understand the concept of college, and I wasn't going to try to explain it to him. 

I left them like that, and never went back. 

Over these years, I wondered if Dad had released them back into the sea. 

Ever since I left home at eighteen, I've been flying to and from college every couple of months, due to a respiratory condition that came out of nowhere. 

I thought it was the mold in my college dorms, but when I moved to another room, I still found myself waking up, choking on air, like my lungs refuse to work. 

Numerous scans informed me I'm completely healthy, and all the doctor can give me is an inhaler. I was supposed to meet with a specialist in town anyway, so I figured I would pay dad a visit.

I headed back to Dad’s beach house with the excuse to pick up some old  trinkets I left behind. 

There was no sign of him, so I let myself in, making my way down to the basement. 

Dad had changed the lighting to a duller blue, and immediately, I was comforted with the familiar stink of saltwater and strong bleach that smelled right. 

The stairs were *wet*, I noticed, slowly making my way down to the basement.

The tank was still there, illuminated in dazzling blue. 

But it was bigger. 

I saw Aira before she saw me, and I noticed a change in her. 

She wasn't smiling. 

Instead, the mermaid’s eyes were alert, her fingers tapping against the glass. 

“Hey.” I greeted her, a cough I couldn't control taking over. 

Aira jumped, startled, when I knocked on the glass. Her gaze found mine, and something twisted in my gut. 

Her expression was wild, contorted, and not what I remembered. 

When she pointed upwards for me to open the tank, I shook my head, biting back the urge to say, “Nice try.”

I could tell she hadn't eaten yet. The tank was fresh, so my dad was yet to feed them. 

“Where's Falan?” I asked, remembering how to talk with my expression. 

Aira didn't respond. With a stoic face, she pointed upwards again. 

The absurdity of me talking to my childhood mermaid friend sent me into fits of laughter– which became a coughing fit. 

When I spluttered out a cough, her eyes widened, and I swore her gaze flicked to my torso. With the mermaid mostly ignoring me, I went in search of my trinkets I left behind in one of the towering boxes filling the basement. 

I was looking for my music box, and an old mermaid figurine Harvey had given me for my fifth birthday. 

I found myself going through memory lane diving into boxes of old toys, and my endless collection of mermaid memorabilia. Shoving aside holiday decorations, I stuck my hands in another box, pulling out a folded yellow dress. 

The dress was cute, but I didn't remember wearing it. 

I thought maybe it was Elle’s, but it was way too small. Elle was a curvy woman. 

Throwing the dress aside, I pulled out cargo shorts this time. Followed by a short sleeved band shirt, and a lakers cap covered in dust. With the clothes in my hands, I had a sudden hysterical thought that these were my brother’s clothes. 

But he was dead. 

He died when I was nine years old. 

I could feel my hands starting to tremble, digging deeper into the box. 

This time, a backpack with a tiny Pikachu attached to the zipper. I went through it, pulling out workbooks and crumbled schedules, a bottle of water and a crumbling sandwich covered in mold. 

Opening the workbooks, I flicked through pages and pages of intricate handwriting. 

A stress toy was at the very bottom of the pack, collecting dust. 

I could sense my breathing starting to accelerate when my hands grasped a bright green handbag filled with make-up, a dead phone, and a laptop. 

But it was right at the bottom of the box, where I found the nail in the coffin that sent bile shooting up my throat. 

Two college ID’s. The first, neat and looked after, on a red string, belonged to a scowling twenty two year old English major, Matthew Whittam. 

The second ID tag, covered in scribbles and doodles, was twenty three year old Quinn Cartwright, a smiling brunette, who, according to her tag, was a film student. 

The tag slipped out of my hands, and I puked, heaving up my mediocre dinner.

Aira and Falan. 

The beings in the tank were not mermaids. They were HUMAN. 

Before I could stop myself, I grabbed the clothes again, the yellow dead with noticeable smears of red on the collar, and the cargo shorts torn and bloodied when I turned them inside out. 

I don't even remember standing up. 

With the ID tag in my hands, I stumbled over to the tank, pressing Aira’s identity against the glass. 

But she didn't even recognize herself, slowly cocking her head to the side. 

This hurt, a pang in my chest physically squeezing my lungs. 

This time, I opened the tank, and the girl broke the surface. 

She didn't speak, because she *couldn't*, instead flailing her arms. 

I thought back to the scar on Falan's throat, and I felt sick to my stomach. 

Instead of speaking, Aira pointed to the door, her eyes wide and desperate. 

“It's okay,” I told her calmly. “Where's Falan?”

When her eyes narrowed to slits, I caught myself. 

“Matthew.” I corrected, quickly. “Where is Matthew?”

Before she could respond, my father’s voice sounded from upstairs. 

Followed by what sounded like muffled screaming. 

Aira’s head snapped to me when the muffled screaming grew closer, my father’s footsteps following. 

I could hear the sound of something wet hitting concrete, like a tail. 

Aira pointed towards a box, and I understood, diving behind the door. 

The wet slapping noises continued, all the way down the stairs, before my father appeared, a bloody apron over jeans and a shirt, dragging along a figure. 

It was another guy, lying on his stomach, blood spilling from his lips and nose, streaking down his bare torso. 

I had to slap my hand over my mouth. I could still see the guy’s legs, or what used to be his legs, twisted into something resembling a tail. 

His ears still looked human, the sharp points almost looked man-made. 

Dad dragged the boy across the floor, panting. “It's okay,” he told the boy who was half human. The guy was struggling to breathe, like a fish out of water. “Once your lungs have gotten used to the water, you'll adapt.”

When he yanked the boy by his grotesque legs slowly morphing into a tail, the boy coughed up something that dripped down his chin. His eyes were wide and unseeing, his arms dead weights by his side. Dad carried the boy, bridal style, up a ladder to the surface. 

I thought he was going to throw him in, but instead, my father pulled out a knife. “It's okay,” he kept telling the guy in sharp breaths, “I know it hurts, but you won't be able to adapt if I don't do this.” 

I could see Aira watching, her hand over her mouth, as my father dragged the blade across the boy’s throat, slicing it open, and dumping him into the water. 

The boy sank, his body bent in an arch, sharp red blooming around him. 

He was dead. 

His tail was limp, his arms dragging him down. 

Aira caught the boy, cradling him in her arms. 

Dad watched, a smile pricking on his lips. 

The ‘merman’ jolted in Aira’s arms, his eyes shooting open, and when he breathed, he breathed by habit, clutching his chest, a stream of bubbles flying from his mouth. 

When the nameless boy caught hold of himself, he pounded his fists against the glass, lips parting in a silent cry. Dad ignored him, dumping fish guts into the water, and forcing him to eat them. 

It struck me why Falan and Aira were only alert when they didn't eat. 

My father was drugging their food, keeping them docile. 

He had cut their voices directly from their throat. 

Carved into their bodies, cruelly moulding them into my stupid fucking childhood fantasy. 

When my Dad left them, Aira tried to tell me to stay to help her calm down the new merman, who kept pounding his fists against the glass. 

But I think part of her wanted me to hunt down her companion. I knew from the panicked glances she kept sending me that she was worried for him. 

Dad said his office was out of bounds when I was a kid, and I never thought much of it. 

When I pushed through the door, which was surprisingly unlocked, I realized *why*. 

All around me, bathed in clinical white light, were towering tanks filled with both human and fish parts; floating torsos and severed heads, victims no longer with identities.

Dad was studying how to combine the two. His notes were strewn everywhere, screwed up and thrown in an overflowing trash can, and stuck to the wall. I found Falan pinned to a surgical table, a tube stuck down his throat. 

The human boy cruelly twisted into something *inhuman*, and yet my father was sadistic enough to continue the facade, leaving the seaweed entwined in his curls, like he was a circus act. 

There was a sensor above him, every movement he made setting off a sprinkler, soaking him. 

It was when he *didn't* move, which glued me to the spot. 

When his tail dried up, I panicked, reaching to wave my arm in front of the sensor. 

Instead, however, to my shock, his tail started to change, contorting and morphing into *something* that resembled legs, but were more grotesque, cruelly stitched to his torso in a horrific attempt to change from a mermaid into a human boy.

When the sensor activated, soaking him again, Falan’s body jerked, and he choked up splattered red splashing the tube.

His eyes flickered open, and he opened his mouth to speak.

But his words were gibberish, his voice a incomprensible hiss. 

I remembered how to move. 

Police. 

That was my first thought. 

I needed to get the cops. 

I tried to leave, stumbling over to the door, but something caught my eye. 

Another tank, and floating inside it, an all too familiar face. 

But he wasn't supposed to be so limp, so *wrong.*

Unmoving. 

Harvey's body had long since decomposed, and yet pieces of flesh still remained, still my big brother, and yet his body wasn't, cruelly ripped apart and stitched together, a mutilated fish tail attached to his torso. 

His skin was covered in mismatched scales, like a virus taking over, shredding him apart, only leaving a slimy, green tinged substance coating him. 

Harvey was dead. 

But the thing stitched to him, entangling decomposing flesh, was still *alive*. 

I got out of there, and then the house in four single breaths. 

I ran home.

I woke up yesterday unable to breathe, this time choking up blood. 

Mom wasn't there.

When I stepped into the shower, I pieced together my thoughts and what exactly I was going to tell the cops, without sounding crazy. 

But when my fingers grazed the skin of my torso, just below my breast, I could feel three singular gashes in my skin. 

Feeling the other side, there they were, splitting my flesh apart, warm to the touch, and yet somehow feeling natural. 

I can't believe I'm saying this, but being in water feels better. I can finally breathe. 

But I find myself stumbling when I'm trying to walk, and I'm terrified. 

I keep getting out of breath, and my skin feels too dry. Like it's sucked of moisture. 

I tried to get into the basement earlier, and unsurprisingly, it's locked. 

There's no sign of Mom or Dad. 

The only thing I have right now is Mom’s stupid pet fish. 

I feel like I'm suffocating on air. 

You have to help me. 

Please help me save the people trapped in my father’s basement!",2,1731102882.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I'm looking for our first ""real"" cruise in april next year. 

We're a Dutch couple early 50s who aren't big drinkers or partiers. Earlier this year we took a brief cruise on Aida and found we really enjoy seeing the world gone buy but are less keen on the ever present cigarette smoke all over the pool deck and the fact it's all German speaking (and mine is mediocre at best). 

Still we'd love to give it another go and for various reasons I'm fortunate enough to have some more to spend on this trip. Right now  I'm looking at 2 other cruises in Asia but this one also caught my eye. Less of an adventure to places we've never been and likely won't ever return to , more a nice vacation. 

The cruise I'm looking at

[https://www.princess.com/cruise-search/details/?voyageCode=U516A](https://www.princess.com/cruise-search/details/?voyageCode=U516A)

   On Sun Princess. This seems to offer a nice mix of sea days and ports. Also would give me a chance to visit an active volcano, something which I've got on my bucket list, and a few other places we never got around to. This would be far less of a big adventure and more just a nice relaxing vacation. Also likely to be cheaper due to the much lower air fare.



What's the itinerary like? Are the tours very crowded? 

What would I need to book to get a nice sense of luxury without spending massive amounts? Do they do drinks packages that include unlimited speciality coffees (we're not big on alcohol but unlimited fancy lattes would really feel like luxury)

This is probably a bit of a long shot as Jura machines are very specific however I managed to purchase a Jura A1 model for parts in ebay. The description was that it works perfectly fine however the coffee is very weak. After receiving the machine I took it apart fully and did a full disassembly, clean and reassembly of the brewing unit and i cleaned the grinder. I payed attention to how the burrs were aligned and made sure the markings were together. Despite this, the grind is extremely coarse and the machine produces coffee flavoured water and not actual coffee. The grounds look more like small pebbles after being ejected into the puck draw. Does anyone have any suggestions?

I WFH & have a super sedentary life, so my previous protein intake was 55-75g/day usually. Now I’m starting to do weightlifting 3-5x/week & the guidelines generally say 1g protein per 1lb of weight, which would put me at 140-150ish. (And my man, an ex body builder, says it should optimally be higher than that.)

Complicating factor is that I’m taking a medication or have some health issue that makes me feel nauseous & unable eat to eat for most of the day. When I can eat, I can only manage eating small portions. However, all the recipes I’m finding have seemingly massive amounts of food (meals that are like a can of chickpeas on a bed of something, 2c of lentils, a giant burrito, etc)

I use the plant based ensure protein shakes (20g pea protein + vitamins), usually have around 3cups of soy milk in milk-heavy coffees (~21g) throughout the day, sometimes I’ll add a supplement in (10g). These are easy bc they’re all liquid & my target only required 5-25g more. Now that I’m supposed to be eating 90g more, idk how to make it work.

I don’t want to purely rely on liquids/shakes or processed impossible-meat type foods, but I’m having a hard time finding anything that’s high protein in small quantities? Like, I could add in cliff bars & vegan seitan jerky & something with protein powder, but those feel less healthy & I would really rather eat Whole Foods.

1gmtue4,https://www.reddit.com/r/camping/comments/1gmtue4/savage_gulf_state_park_trip_report/,Savage Gulf State Park [Trip Report],"My wife and I visited Savage Gulf State Park outside of Chattanooga, TN last week. We did 18 miles in three days. It wasn't always easy, but we learned a lot about the park. And I thought that some of yall would find a write-up useful!

DAY 1

We arrived and parked in the Savage Gulf South Trailhead Sunday around noon (10/27). The parking lot was small, but it was practically empty. There was one entrance to the trail. We hiked for about 15 minutes until we encountered the first hurdle! We knew we were camping that night at Sawmill campsite, which was on the lefthand side of the gulf. The trail T'd off. I think it said, ""Left for Suter Falls, Right for Collins Rim Trail"". We knew that we needed to hike along the rim trail to get to Sawmill, and we didn't know if going towards Suter Falls would be a dead end. But we knew that we needed to keep left, so we went left! And thankfully it was the correct path. We hiked mostly uphill along uneven stone blocks covered with leaf litter. So full sized hiking boots are an imperative. We would have twisted our ankles 10x over without good boots. 

After about three hours of hiking, we knew that we should be getting close to the campsite. Then we encountered hurdle #2. The trail T'd off again. The sign said to go left for the spring and right to Sawmill. I knew from reading the website that ""each campsite had access to a spring with filterable water."" So, I didn't know if this spring was THE spring for Sawmill (spoiler alert: it was) or if there was another spring actually inside the campsite. So we err'd on the side of safety. I decided to follow the path and see where the spring was. The spring was about 1/2 mile away from the trailhead, and Sawmill was about another 3/4 of a mile past the entrance to the spring. So if we hadn't gotten any water and instead hoped for a spring at the campsite, we would ahve been sorely disappointed. And I would have had to walk 1.25 miles, in the dark, to try and locate this (admitteldy hard to find) spring. So thank goodness for that. The campsite was clean and organized. The camp toilet was DISGUSTING, so bring your poop trowel!

DAY 2

We slept in Sawmill, there was enough wood to have a decent fire. The next campsite was Stagecoach. We knew that it was a shorter distance (3 miles), so were pumped up about an easier day. Boy were we wrong! One thing that's important to know, the camp of Savage Gulf is inaccurate and all the distances are at least 20% longer than what the map would say. So the hike from Sawmill to Stagecoach was about 4.5 miles, and it was almost exclusively up-hill. So that hike took about three hours as well. And stagecoach did have a ""spring"" close-ish to the campsite (10 minute walk), but it was more of a muddy puddle. I had to use my coffee cup to scoop the dirty, stagnant water into my filtration bag. And luckily I also had Iodin tablets! So we just filtered and then used the tablets and everything was good. There was enough wood for a nice fire. Again, the toilet was freaking gross. 

DAY 3

Our next campsite was back by the car, at Collins West. And we knew that that hike was going to be the longest. It was supposed to be around 7 miles but was actually about 8.5. And it was an easy, downhill hike. We loved it. There's so many beautiful springs (with fast moving, clear water!) and rock faces. Fall is so beautiful in TN. But the trail was easy, no confusing directions. It was a straight shot to Collins West. And thankfully we were the only ones at that campsite (we were the only ones in the entire freaking park for those three days imo) because all the campsites were close together and there was no brush for any privacy. But there was a lookout at Campsite #6 (I believe), so yall need to stay there. 

THINGS TO KNOW:

* You need two Liters/person + water filter + iodin tablets. You need to make sure and refill your water at any and every chance you get. You can't assume that they'll be a spring around the corner. We were fine, but I can image another, much more stressful scenario in which we didn't take advantage of a spring and then didn't have enough water to cook, clean, or rehydrate
* You have to book each campsite ahead of time. They don't do ""vagabonding"" at this park. 
* Make sure you have boots. The majority of the trails are made up of broken stone blocks with about 3 inches of dead leaves on top. So you gotta be careful where you step. 
* Make sure you have a map **AND** compass. Better to be safe than sorry.. 
* Most (if not all) of the signs we saw had inaccurate information. One sign said ""4 miles to Sawmill"", when we KNEW it was actually .4 miles to Sawmill. All of the sign's directions were correct, but there distance estimations were ALL off. 
* We did have spotty service at Stagecoach, but assume that you won't have any service. 

If anyone has any more specific questions, please feel free to ask or DM me. I tried to keep this general and beginner friendly, but I learned A LOT on this trip and I have a few pages of notes of things that I need to buy to be better equiped or things that I forgot to bring but desperately wished that I had.

Looking to buy my first coffee machine for me and my family.


I usually use a french press, but I’m looking to upgrade.

My friend has recommended the Sage barista express to me, as he has thoroughly enjoyed his for the last 2 years or so.

My question is; should I opt for the sage barista express or the sage bambino plus? I’ve heard good things about both, but people seem to rate the bambino plus highly for beginners, from what I’ve read here. 
I recognise that I would need to buy a grinder separate with the bambino plus, and I’d be willing to spend another maybe €150 or so on one - recommendations also more than welcome.

Would love to know people’s opinions on which machine to go for !

Today I went to the same store and tested it and was so confused that it smelled SO floral, like the vanilla, coffee etc etc was absolutely indistinguishable, all I got was a powerful punch of potent florals on the sample strip. It made me physically recoil. I thought let me leave it a few hours and go back to it, maybe the dry down will remind me of the Black Opium I tried once. Nope! 

I’m totally baffled as to how a fragrance can smell entirely different from one year to the next!

I know this is a really common question but i have the need to write what i think and feel.

First thing first, when i started my  job some time ago, i was in a really weird personal state back then and i had no desire  going out or doing anything related to clubbing etc at the time . Back then i was invited two or three times  going out with the rest of the ""team"" of the office but i gently declined. 

Months passed, and i was back to my old self, i had the desire to gain every moment i had missed with my coworkers, and that's because i genuinely like them.

One Friday, they were talking about going out clubbing at the weekend and i was interested. Right before joing the convo, the only male of the ""group"" asked me if i was interested . I said yes but not at that specific club they were saying because i had visited it  in th past and i really didn't like it . But again, i said that i was interested in going out with them . The two girls of the ""group""  looked each other, and  one of them , let's say her kamala(recent event bias), said "" yea , sure, after all you don't like that type of music"", and then they continued making plans in front of me. I said ( at least tried) that i prefer other type of music mostly but i like ""clubbing"" music, but they pretty much ignored me. They ended up going without me. And how i know?.

After that weekend, "" kamala"" , started doing a "" highlights of the weekend show"" to me. When we were alone, she started telling about what they did at the weekend, and a lot of times , she was pretty much shitting on the rest of the ""group"". She said that they were talking too much and didn't let her enjoy the music, and that they were too pushy with her. At that point, i was trying to understand why she was saying all those things to me, week after week . At that point, i have to say that i have a crush on  ""kamala"" but I cant do anything, cause she has a serious relationship. So most days are kinda hard, seeing her all day  etc. Anyway...

This last week, this whole week ,the male coworker of the"" group "" was suggesting to the girls visiting a new club that opened in our town. Every time, he started talking about that, ""kamala"", tried her best changing the convo. Today, last day of the working week, he yet again, asked the girls if they want to go out this weekend. Their answer was ,that they will go out tomorrow, the two of them (the girls), for something casual ( coffee or maybe a drink). He answered, "" ok if you want to meet tomorrow at some point, give me a phone call"", and he left. After a while,  the other girl of the ""group"" left, and i was left alone with "" kamala"". As soon as she left, ""kamala"" said to me"" i whould tell you to join us tomorrow, but ""ivanka"" (the other girl) speaks too much , she is really annoying"", i replied that i don't mind and i whould like to join them. She then told me "" no , no, believe me you will not have a good time"". After that i was confused and questioned her"" excuse me for asking, but why do you go out with them every single weekend if you don't have a good time?.

She replied ""  it's kinda complicated, we know each other for a long time, our boyfriends are friends long before meeting as, and also her husband (ivanka's) help us renovate our house some years ago... That's why i am saying this to you, the situation is kinda complicated, I don't have many options on this matter"".  I just said "" yea yea understand "".

Seriously, what you guys think? Why ""kamala"" started having this behaviour? She feels bad that I don't get included in their plans but she can't tell me for whatever reason? Or she justs feels bad about me?  How can I handle the situation from now on?

Ps i never have , directly, asked any of them if they are interested in spending time together after work or anything, for some reason i can't really make any proposal to them for a night out, i am kinda introvert I guess, i am guilty on that",0,1731101718.0,Advice,1,0.5,False

1gmtqxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gmtqxl/whats_wrong_with_me/,What's wrong with me,"

Male  mid 30s. 

Wondering can some one advise on what may be the cause of my issues.??

 To note I am going back to my doctor soon re my routine bloods comparsions and also a gastrologiest re my other complaints.

During the last year some foods make me bloated and think they lead to difficult stools which bring on the hemorrhoids well blood when I wipe so assuming it's that's.(Approx 3-7 times a month)

Changes in diet had improved things from the initial issues approx a year ago where I felt bloated a lot and felt constipated and anusol helps with the blood so that's let me to think it's nothing more sinister. 

 I had routine bloods done last month and it was flagged my iron levels were slightly low. I decided to do a review of some of the metrics v the routine bloods I did last year and have seen some swings.

Could I have IBS and this regular hemmorids issue be the cause of my low iron?  

My stools are generally solid (not always big) and never diarrhea. I have looked to see if there was any blood in my stool but none visible to the naked eye.

Sometimes I have nothing to wipe. The times there's blood on the tissue when I wipe I know before I wipe as it's uncomfortable.

The bloating and blood all started approx a year ago so in my head the timing fits but I obviously don't have the experience or knowledge.

One big thing I have noticed is I usually would wake up feeling 'very light' and not needing a bowel movement but nowadays I feel like I need a bowel movement but I can't go if if try. A coffee or exercise which I often do first thing seems to help and I get this 'light' feeling after this particular bowel movement.


The metrics I have noticed a big swing in are.(Sept 2023 -> sept 2024)

Iron 19.4 -> 11.5 umol/l
Ferritin 72 -> 58.3 Ng/mol
Total Bilirubin 15 -> 10 umol/l
Transferrin Sat 33 -> 19

I recently had tingling in one of my hands for approx 2 days.

To add to the above I am a stress head and often have anxiety issues.

I thought first just to add some legs.... but the diameter of the mini is far smaller 9 inchs vs 20/34 of the side/cofee cable.

So I decided to slap it on onto an IKEA Lack :)  
I understood that Ikea furniture just is a thin layer of wood and then inside is just some kind of treated paper, so all I needed to do was cut a bit into the top.

I bought a hole saw to attempt to cut into it, but I think my drill did not have enough torque..... anyways it helped to outline the hole and I cut it with a knife I had on hand.

Then I poked a hole for the usb cable and thats about it.

I thought about cutting another hole on the bottom so the Oasis mini sits flush, but im worried the lack table might fall appart so im going to try it like this first.

We want to do something a little different but we'd love to get the opinion of frequent cafe goers like yourselves.

I often find myself yearning for a beautiful, quiet third space. Turns out...libraries aren't quiet anymore! At least around me. We are toying with the idea of adding a large ""quiet room/area"" to the cafe much like a library, where no talking is allowed. This room would be gorgeous. There would be running water (artificial creek), Japanese garden fountains, tons of elegant foliage (I'm talking rainforest cafe levels), huge windows for natural lighting, large comfortable couches, chairs etc. Basically a mini, indoor botanical zen garden.  
  
It would be for folks who are there alone and don't want to hear other people's conversations. Just read, study, work etc.

There's another angle. Feel free to rip it to shreds. We are thinking of adding a subscription model. Members can enter the garden anytime, get free drip coffee, at cost espresso drinks/food. Non-members could pay a moderate entry fee on a day basis and pay full price for drinks food.

I would reserve a small area in front, probably separated by a door, for people wanting to socialize and have a regular cafe experience.

1gmtbbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gloomrealm/comments/1gmtbbd/first_day_back/,First day back,"The rest of the summer was fun, if not entirely satisfying. My gf and I kept talking and sexting. When she was alone at home I had her on her hands and knees filling herself with her toy and begging lile a whore. But that didn't happen as much as I would have liked. In between sessions I  got by knowing how desperate she was. And sending her little messages like how hard I was for her. How I wanted to eat her out so badly. And making her take canded shots of her playing with her pussy and sending them to me. 

Fun, but not fully gratifying.

Alison and I developed a strange closeness when Mark wasn't around. We didn't fuck or anything. She had made sure that would never happen again. 

Sure it wouldn't.

But once Mark was out of the apartment I would stroll into her room and we would talk. Often naked or barely clothed. We would talk about her hopes and dreams and I would give her ""advice"" on how to deal with Mark's behavior. We talked even as one of us would shower. But I wasn't allowed to touch her.

 Oh she liked me looking. And from the way she would stare at my crotch and her nipples getting hard, she liked what she saw. But there was no more shots and no more sexy fun time. 

But thankfully summer came to an end, and with such perfect timing.

I just had to smile.

When my gf got back to school with her family I helped her move into her new room. I met her parents and they loved me. A fine upstanding yung man, her father called me. He hadn't noticed me brushing my hard on against his little girl every time we passed. Or how I grabbed her brest when he wasn't looking. 

I also got to meat Heather for the first time. 

Ah Heather. She was only a little over 5', blond wavey hair, baby doll face, trim waist, and her breasts and ass were amazing. Personality wise, she seemed a little cold, but that apparently was just Heather. Apparently she had a boyfriend, but he was in jail. And he wouldn't get out for another 4 years. Meanwhile she was being a good girl and waiting for him. What a waste. 

I also took some time to go over my gfs other roommates while i helped move her in.

Yunga was there, all shy and quiet. Her barely there body a contrast to my gfs curves. She could barely make eye contact with me. And I just had to poke a little fun at her. 

""I can't wait to start movie night again. I really missed it. How about you Yunga? I know you like a good show.""
Before that I didn't know Asians could blush that red. 

The other two roommates were interesting as well. 

Liz was a thin blond, with the body of a runner and a somewhat sad face. She apparently had been on her high-school track team, up until she found out pot was so much fun. 

Then there was Denise. She was Latino, and curvy. Long straight black hair framed a face made for smiling. She was a bit of a goth. When I first met her she was wearing a long black silk dress with a purple velvet corset holding up her ample chest. She was bright and bubbly. And it was easy to get her to laugh. When she heard about movie night she practically jumped up and down. And it was quite a sight to see.

After we finished moving my gf in, her parents went to the hotel they had booked, taking Heather with them for the moment. They said they would be back in a few hours, but they all just needed to rest. The girls wanted to talk and get to know each other more, maybe get a coffee. But I had been waiting long enough.

I excused my gf amd I. And we headed to my apartment. No one was home yet so as soon as I closed the door I grabbed my gf and kissed her. I pulled her in tight and ground my hips into her crotch.

""I need this and I need it now."" I growled at her. 

She seemed to be in the same state and only nodded. I picked her up in front of me and carried her into my room. I left the door open, and before she could protest about my roommate coming back I was on her. 

I tore her short off over her head. And practically ripped away her braw. My mouth found her nipple and I devoured it. Flicking my tung across it as I sucked on her brest. My hands tore at her pants and I paused only long enough to pull them, forcefully, down her legs and off. 

Standing at the edge of the bed I looked down at her in her panties. I could see that they were soaked through already. I was still fully clothed and she was almost completely naked. 

""Give them to me"" and I held out my hand.

Shyly she took off her panties and presented them to me. The damp fabric reaked of her needy sex. I brought them up to my nose and inhaled. Savoring her sent. Then I looked back down at her.

""What are you waiting for. You know what to do.""

She just nodded her head and undid my pants. She struggled as she pulled them down over my hard shaft. But when I popped out, her mouth was there to take me in. I could tell that all the practice I had made her do on her toy was paying off. 

She took my cock all the way into her throat on the first try. And held I there for a count of 5, without gaging. I brought her panties up to my nose again and inhaled as my other hand gripped the back of her head. I barely had to do anything thou. She was fucking her own face with my cock. 

And I smiled. 

I didn't hold back and let my first orgasim fill her hungry throat pretty quickly. She cleaned and licked my cock with a passion. Not letting me get soft. I pulled her head off my rod when I was satisfied and forced her soaked panties into her mouth.

""Taste that. That's how desperate you are for my cock. Your a needy little slut who's dripping down her thighs even as she fucks her face on my rod. You are such a desperate little whore for me aren't you?

She just hummed her approval and agreement. I slaped her face to get her attention back. 

""Then turn around. I want that pussy, now.""

She quickly turned around on her hands and knees, egar as a puppy. She went to take her panties out of he mouth, and I brought my hand down on her ass in a stringing spank. She yelped and looked back at me, fear and lust in her eyes.

""I didn't tell you to touch your panties now did I.""

She shook her head, embarrassed.

""Then leave them in. I fucking little slut like you should learn to love the taste of pussy.""

She shuddered, then made an over dramatic sucking noise. I knew she was just playing, but I would be lying if I didn't say I thought it was hot. Then she turned her head forward and wiggled her ass back towards me.

I couldn't wait any longer. I stepped up behind her and thrust into her dripping cunt in one motion. Surrounded by her pussy I savored the moment. It had been to long since I felt a woman grasp my cock with her pussy. My gf let out a deep moan as I took her and dropped her head. The spasms in her walls told me she had just cum. 

I smiled. 

I had trained her well and kept her so needy that she could bow cum just from one thrust. I gave her a moment to enjoy the waves of pleasure my cock gave her, then I started moving in her. 

I started slow, but with deep hard thrusts that shook her ass and made her tits swing back and forth. Listening to her moan into her dirty pants I started to push faster. Soon I was in a nice steady rhythm and her pussy was leaking. The wet slapping sounds of my body pushing into hers filled the room, and almost drowned out the noise I was listening for.

""Your friend Heasther. Maybe she should join us latter. She's pretty hot. And I think she would look good licking your clit right now. Your fucking juices smearing all over her face.""

I started telling my gf. She heard me but I had timed it with her next orgasim. Her full mouth let out a low moab, but she did try and shake her head weekly. I reached down and grabbed her by a fist full of her hair. I pulled her body back against mine. Arching her back so I could keep filling her leaking hole. 

""No, not Heather."" And I shook her head. "" How about Yunga then. I mean she's got the body of a 12 year old boy. But it wpuld be hot seeing such a shy little slut turn into a needy little whore. Just like you.""

At this she moaned even louder and I felt more of her cum poor down my legs. The head shake was even less this time. 

""Really. I think she would look so sexy eating my cum put of your pussy. Face all smeared with cum. And of course you oulrd have to return the favor."" And I pushed her back onto her hands.

""I'd make sure you treated her good. Licking her little think kitty. Getting your face all messy as you devoure her little cunt. And if you didn't make her cum, I would have to make it up to her. You'ld love watching her tiny body bouncing on on those cock. And getting to suck every last drop of cum out of her cunt. I know you love it when she watches us. You want her to come over and start rubbing you don't you?""

This time there was a deep moan and no head shaking at all, just a small sob. 

And I smiled. 


I knew that fun with Yunga was still a ways off. But a small gasp behind me made me sure that someone would have my cum sucked out of her cunt, relatively soon. I didn't look over my shoulder but I knew Alison was there. And my minds eye treated me to an image of her, one hand down her pants, the other rubbing and pinching her tits. And from the small sounds she was making I figured I was probably right. 

But looking down at my gf, I saw what I had decided was going to be another step in her training. 

I spanked her cheeks a few more times. Leaving red hand prints that would be sore for at least a few hours. She just moand and started backing into my thrusts. I looked down at her reddened ass and saw her winking back.

I spit down on her asshole, watching as she shivered. Then I slowly rubbed her cheeks. Constantly moving my hand closer to her back door. I could tell she was close to another orgasim and waited. Just as her legs began to shake and her cunny gushed out more juices, I slipped my thumb into her vigin ass. 

The howl of her orgasim was loud even through her panties. I continued to fuck her through her orgasim and into her next. My thumb starting to push in and out of her ass. 

""Oh you like that bitch. You like having me play with your ass. Well get used to it slut. Because I am going to claim all your holes. I am going to fill you up till you are a dripping cum rag.""

Now initially I was only going to start her training as my anal whore. But the way she was pushing back onto my digget I decided to speed up her lessons.

I pulled out of my gfs cunt and quickly pressed against her winking asshole. At this point she was cum drunk and barely able to move, but she did try and flail her arms a little as I pressed into her. Taking away her last bit of purity. And as I pressed deeper and deeper, her ass stretched and clenched. Trying to push me out. But once I was fully sheathed in her back door, I held her hips against mine and enjoyed this new tightness. 

And I smiled.

Her body and mind seemed to be at war. She was flailing and clenching at the same time. Her ass was trying to push me out even as her hips moved back to take more of me. I grabbed her waving wrists and held them, pulling her chest up off the bed. Her panties fell out if her mouth with a stream of nonsense words. I pulled on her arms, drawing her back then pushed her away with my thrust. Over and over I pulled her back. Over and over her head lolled and rolled. Her body clenching and spasming as she started to drool. 

""I'm gona cum. I'm going to fill your tight ass with it. Your mine bitch and you always will be."" I said as I strained to hold on a little more.

With a roar of pent up need and dominance I erupted into her back passage. My hot seed poured out into her as her body came one last time. After spending myself inside her I collapsed on top of her, my cock still bared inside her. My body pressed her down into the bed and we stayed like that for a moment. 

I flexed my softening cock in her ass.

""Did I hurt you?"" I asked as we layed sweaty, kissing her shoulder.

""A little. But in a good way."" She said back to me in a breathy voice. ""Fuck I need to get ready but I can't move my legs.""

I flexed my cock in her again. ""Can you feel that?""

""Hmmmmm, yes"". 

""I think Yunga would have creamed her hand a dozen times watching that show."" 
I said looking over my shoulder. And there was Alison. 

She smiled at me and pulled her hand out of her pants. And it was clear she had enjoyed the show. She brought her fingers up to her lips, all glistening and slick, and licked them clean. My cock twitched inside my gf and she moaned again. Drawing my attention. When I looked back Alison was gone.

I looked down at my gf and smiled.

""I guess we should get ready.""

I stood up and started to get ready to shower. Then I stopped. I grabbed the damp panties, discarded on the bed. I stopped my gf and slid the panties up her legs. She just looked at me.

""I think you are ready now.""

""No I need to get a shower and clean up. I can't go to dinner with your cum leaking out my ass. And sweaty and messy."" 

I reached down and pinched a nipple between my fingers till she yelped and tried to pull away. 

""No. You are ready. You can change your clothes. But these,"" and I pointed to her panties, ""Stay on. 

She just nodded at me and started to get dressed. In a petulant tone she asked me, ""Are you going to shower?""

I looked down at my messy cock, covered in cum and her residue. Then looked at her.
""Unless you are going to do your job and clean me up?""

She just ducket her head and finished getting ready.

I walked her to the door and spanked her tender ass one more time. I told her I would be over in a few minutes. And we kissed food bye.  I strolled into Alison's room on my way to the bathroom. again.

Alison was laying back, spread egal, her fingers barried in her wet pussy. She looked up at me and smiled.

""I loved the show you put on.""

""I can tell.""

""If I had know you were such a bad boy I might have let you do some of that to me.""

I smiled.

""You did. But next time we can do a little more."" 

She laughed and then moaned as she hit a good spot on her pussy.  ""I told you we can't do that again. But I can help you clean up.""
She sat forward and beckoned to me. Always the gentleman, I strolled over to her waiting mouth. 

Watching her clean and suck my cock, even after it had been in my gfs ass was so erotic. How she seemed to savor it, cleaning all the filth and slime off. She looked like the most regal whore I had ever seen

1gmsyxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1gmsyxg/my_life_is_continuing_to_become_more_boring/,My life is continuing to become more boring.,"Hello everyone!

I don't know if this is the right place to talk, but I want to express my emotions because I feel really depressed, or more like alone. Here’s my story: I'm a 23-year-old male, single, and Romanian. I have no job and no girlfriend. I got through primary school, high school, college, and now I'm pursuing a master’s degree. I've learned a lot over this time. I was the type of person who is always good and tries to help others when necessary. But as time has passed, I’ve started to feel alone. In college, I saw guys with girlfriends and jobs, or at least one of these options. Now, I can’t even call a friend anymore because every one of them has a job or a girlfriend they spend time with.

I've tried to attend different events, but nothing came of it. I’ve tried talking to girls a lot, but nothing worked out. I’ve applied to jobs, and only a few opportunities came up after sending out 13 applications. A lot of people my age seem to have a mentality that I find difficult to understand. For them, partying means drinking and smoking. I don’t drink or smoke. Some of their favorite topics are about things like, ""I drove that car so fast,"" or, ""I got so drunk at that party."" Sometimes it’s hard to find people I can have serious conversations with. Many of them also don't seem to take full responsibility for their own lives.

When I was in college, I tried to make friends but only managed to keep a few. The rest just used me. Girls would reach out to me for help with different projects, but only for college work, and none of them ever asked me out for coffee or anything as a thank you. Sometimes, they would leave me on ""seen"" after I sent a message, even when we were part of the same team. I spent so much time helping others, but very few people helped me. I often feel forced to listen to others’ opinions and agree, even when they’re wrong, but when those same people need help, they expect me to give them advice. Yet, their opinions can mentally exhaust me.

I tried going to the gym with a friend. At first, I asked for help. But when I went alone (even though I still worked out with my friend at times because he had work commitments), many people would give me unsolicited advice. For instance, someone would tell me how to do triceps exercises in a certain way, and then another person would come along and say the opposite. I felt like I was forced to listen to everyone. I tried looking away to avoid them, but it was hard.

I feel like I’m not compatible with this world anymore. It’s like I’m constantly being forced to do things without getting anything in return. I give a lot of my time, but I get nothing back. Where is that beautiful life where I have a good job, a girlfriend to talk to, who understands me and does fun things with me? Right now, I live with my parents, who have supported me a lot. But I feel like I have no purpose. After four years of university, I’m still trying to get a job, a girlfriend, and new friends. My grandma wished for me to have a job and a life partner, at least.

My life feels monotonous and fading away: I wake up, go to my master’s classes, go back to the dorm, try to reach out to friends (but they’re busy with their own lives), apply to jobs, eat, play games, go to the park, visit a bookstore, take walks, come back, model something in Blender, and then sleep. It’s a boring, draining cycle. I used to be so good to others, always giving my time to help them... but now, I feel like I’m running on empty. Even with Blender or Photoshop, I can’t feel inspired to create anymore. Most people have killed my passion with their constant criticism.

I don’t know where to find answers. I feel like no one understands me, even when I try to share my story. People always say things like, “When the time is right, you’ll find a girl or a job.” But when will that be? I'm 23 years old and feel like an old man trapped in a young body.

Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this!

1gmsyuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/OshiNoKo/comments/1gmsyuz/thoughts_about_oshi_no_ko_writing/,Thoughts about Oshi No Ko writing,"This is going to be a long one. Sip a cup of coffee or something. It will not be all doom and gloom, I promise you that. 

 Who is Oshi No Ko's real protagonist. Are they Aqua/ Ruby/ Kana /Akane or Ai, Gorou and Sarina whose shadow and strong will drives this manga. If you are still reading, it means you are ready for a ride.

**I will start with bright side**.

Aka has tendency to cleverly mix classical stories and make it contemporary. It is my favorite part about his writing apart from his near nerdish quality of writing about random stuff. If Kaguya was mix of old but very famous Japanese fable and even more ancient Hindu literature called Vishnu Purana, Oshi No Ko works like classic Greek tragedy complete with revenge, death, destiny, God's interference, mommy love and very much there but not so loved incest angle. What is Greek classic without the latter. Pretty sure if I squint hard, I might even be able to find the book that inspired him. Aka does not copy but utilizes the trope cleverly - I will add this for all those malignant spirits who love to diss on SM .

 Back to our character study. It was pretty clear right from start Aqua had death flag. It is not just because poor fellow was walking path of Greek protagonist but also because he literally had adult man's mind in his young body. Nothing good comes out of it unless one is in good old isekai world. 

Getting born with double spirit played havoc on Aqua's development. To give credit where due, Gorou did not interfere with Aqua's early life except for not allowing him to drink mom's milk (medically important for child's health) or having to take care of his young twin because his mom was also a child. But for most part the man took back seat even if he must be itching to find his murderer. He seemed content to see Ai and his new family happy. 

It is Ai's death that precipitated the tragedy of young Aqua's life. The once docile Gorou now wanted revenge and who did he chose as his instrument. While one might argue that Aqua saw his mom being killed and hence was affected, the truth is Aqua was too young to think of revenge. Because duh his mom's murderer committed suicide. He was too young to piece together the link between Ai calling his dad and fan killing his idol mom. To him it would have been case of deranged stalker fan which is common place in entertainment industry. Which means till he had reached certain age, Aqua would never found the clue to his mom's death and grown normal or as normal as one is after seeing someone close being killed. 

To give a context to this, I will chose Taiki Himekawa. Both Aqua and his half brother are similar complete with similar taste (interest in kana), similar sense of responsibility (look at the way Taiki takes care of his sloppy foster dad), same idealistic protective view of females. They also saw death of their mom at young age. But similarity stops here. Not once did Taiki think on why his philandering mom killed his dad and not other way round or the identity of his mom's lover. He simply wanted to live his own life. That is how children grow up. They are resilient to tough condition because they don't overthink or brood until they become moody teenager or sad adults. Aqua was never allowed to forget that his mom's killer was out there. Think 10+ years of desperate search for killer whose genes you share only to find out he is also manipulative SOB who loves to cause phycological damage. There are times when ignorance is bliss and this is one of them.  

Ruby on other hand got chance to live proper life. She outgrew Sarina in age and experience and only moment when it looked like Sarina might take over, Aqua conveniently dropped the truth about his Gorou identity. Her sensei is alive. Which sort of killed any embers of anger that she might have inside of her. Oh boy did you guys not realize Ai might be Aqua and Ruby's mom but Sarina and Gorou who live inside the vessel are not her children. Her early death means their experience of her as their mom was also cut short. Miyako had more time to form bond as their mom. Compare that to twin bond Aqua and Ruby had with each other. And once it became clear they were Gorou and Sarina, their first priority was going to be each other.

So why did Aqua had to die. Once Kamiki turned his eye on Ruby aka Sarina, not just Aqua but also Gorou wanted to kill him. The ending of the novel mirrors Hercule Poirot's last case. If you have never read Agatha Christie novel, do try them. Her strength is in character study. In novel titled ""Last curtain"" she writes about murderer who causes multiple death without dirtying his hand. It goes deeper than this manga in why even brilliant mind like Poirot choses death to get justice. Could Kamiki have been killed without Aqua having to die. Answer is yes. But would Aqua have been able to live as murderer even if it is justified. Dying could have been his choice of atonement or was that Gorou's choice. We never get into Aqua's real feeling (I have added more in downside section). I don't have to add why he did not want Akane to join in his murder game. 

Effect of entertainment industry on child actors.  Take away Aqua ship and Kana's character becomes super interesting as talented child actors who has been chewed and thrown away by fickle world of entertainment and who is slowly clawing back.  Her acting skill that inspired talented people like Akane are sidelined. With Kamiki, we also got child abuse cases that happen so often in real life. If Aka had taken a step further and showcased now grown child actor with dependency, it would have added more to tragical face of industry. I will go step further and say if Aka had restricted himself to certain section of industry and just one industry it would have done wonders to the story. As it stands manga has no real depth or insight to any world. It simply exists.   

So many characters had interesting background which got wasted on insipid revenge story. Sorry could not resist the dig.

**Now for downsides. Oh boy. Here we go-**

 Sorry shippers. But the only love story in this story is that of Gorou and Sarina along with more potent and devastating love of Kamiki and Ai. Unfortunately we never got to see these 4 that often to understand their feelings. There is a lovely mirror in how one person's love destroyed many and caused death of his lover while another killed himself to save his love and saved other potential victims. A smarter writer would have spent time developing the parallel between these stories to show destruction and healing power of love. Probably Aqua's death might have made more sense if we could have been invested.

Kamiki as a villain was terrible idea. Not only was this man a unicorn in fiction world. How many male victim of female to male sexual assault cases are depicted in fiction. Not even handful. To not only talk about child SA, impact of such assault, the down side of entertainment industry but to turn him into some sort of moral sociopath without giving insight into his psyche is like those awful old movies that depicted gays as villain simply because of their orientation. It is prejudice, not smart writing. 

Identity crisis was default. It felt like story could never make up its mind on whether it wanted to say something about idol world or theater world or movie world. Each is different and comes with different set of problem. Aka could have built story around Kabuki theater. At least we might have got some insight into single industry. On pro side I would say each time I see dating game, I remember this manga. So yeah. There were some pros. It did not happen to single person. So story felt more like group study than autobiography.  But it wanted to say so much about so many things that it never went beyond article headline. Mengo old V-tuber pretending to be young, check. Akane almost destroyed by SM, check. Kana almost trapped by casting couch and paparazzi, check. Colorful situation but no depth. Poor Ruby did not even get that kind of experience. Too sheltered for her good.

Wasted potential called Ruby who could neither escape being Sarina 2.0 or image of Ai. Aqua got some chance to do something of his own. But Ruby nada. She did not even get her own love story. (Or is it Melt and Ruby forever. Blame my shipper brain.)

This is more devastating but any good book needs a classic faceoff. Not between Aqua and Kamiki but between Gorou and Aqua. We heard what Gorou and meddlesome crow girl aka deity had to say about pushing poor Aqua's fate but what about Aqua himself. What was that he wanted. Did he really want revenge and die. No. There is distinct panel which shows that he wanted to live. What about his choices. He would not have stopped his revenge hearing about Himekawa dad death if he was so keen on finding his murderer daddy. Who was this person who we saw throughout the manga struggling. Not once did he ask Gorou to give him chance to live his life even it was for few days. We never saw him rail at deity for being put into such a life struggle. Where did his own choices start and Gorou's end. Did he not have classic rebellious streak. This is what classics focus on. The internal struggle. They show the selfish side that exists in human- the basic want to live life for themselves. 

I have been trying really hard to not write anything about Oshi No Ko. I was huge fan of Aka's earlier work  and learnt hard way that his manga usually starts out as banger, has fairly middling middle complete with shipping war to mask the drag and then peters out towards the end. This was my biggest fear and judging from multiple post, Oshi no ko ending mirrored Kaguya's fragmented and disappointing end.  

Not understanding spirit of classic is Aka's biggest undoing.  There is a reason why Greek or any old classics have endured for so long. Most old authors were not afraid to go balls to walls crazy. They never feared to go extra mile to judge their own creations and put them on ride that would take starch out of normal person. You as readers were allowed to fear for them or fear them. No in-between. Till he realizes this secret I am afraid Aka will gain wealth and fame but not a satisfying manga ending.

On that note I would love to see his take on dark gothic novel next. Have fun.",2,1731099622.0,OshiNoKo,1,1.0,False

As some of you might know and some reading this for the first time and still learning how to perfect your moka pot technique, that some time in this year this moka pot subreddit was hacked. 



Keep in mind that some of the users that hacked this subreddit was permanently banned or their accounts are suspended and they have been banned by Reddit them self, and I was chosen as mod by the one that created this subreddit community and was temporary banned for other reasons the user called ""spaceoverlord"" .



I was the one that reported each and everyone of those bot accounts and even the users that was hacked to get them out of this community ,and wanted it back to as it was before they took over some the accounts of the mods (don't know witch one) ,and added bot to spam post stuff that we never posted in this reddit community.



So I do appreciate spaceoverlord making me mod and giving me the opportunity to help in this reddit community



We have since been recovering from this hacking incident.



As a thanks to this community I have started to add user flairs it's stuff that you may apply user account that will only be shown in this community and will be a  creative way of identifying yourself in this community.



To give an example, I have the ""Aluminum"" users flair ,but could change it later on to ""Collector"" or ""Vintage"" 



The user flair ""Brand"" can be edited if you a brand of moka pot that is not the 2 most used brands that you own or use





You may change them if you want there is no need to add them if, you wanna stay as a regular user with no special tag or flairs.



Please let us know if you want any tag / flair added



You must now add a post flair or tag to your post to have people see and react to the post in question quicker



Please give us feedback on both and if we should add any tag / flair both to post and user.



Please don't request a tag or flair that is not in English or a slang word in your country, we would like to use generic once more to help users understand like ""new user"" or ""moka pot fan""



We have seen many users request that we should get rid of some of the same question with the topic ""is it safe"" or ""usable""or even ""Rust ?"", but we shell not get rid of them as that would be rude, and the user that posted it will never understand why we got rid of it even if we explained to them. 



It might also give the user a bad impression about how we handle the question in hand. 



lastly it might upset some users wanting to join to as and get tolled to read the question and answers,some people don't read all that much before asking questions



We as the community should rather give advice to the users that have less knowledge about the issue in hand.



Please don't down vote the questions as it will leave a bad impression about the community on the users question, and they might be new to reddit themself and the community it self. 



Please if don't feel that you need to answer the question that was asked, if you feel like you can answer question in hand, and your knowledge is good enough to help then by all means, but don't answer it just for the karma points. 



Please don't duplicate your post, your post might might not have gone through the first tim but please close the app or website and reopen or refresh the website to see if it has gone through in the end. 



Just don't ask questions and want a instant results, we all have our own things to do so be patient, and respect each answear that was given, there is no stupid question just less knowledgeable or less experienced people trying to learn or get help sometimes.



Keep in mind not all the answers may fit the question. There are many factors that can give many different answers so choose your answer carefully and don't be afraid to ask questions about the answer given.



Just remember there is no equipment that is right for everyone, and not everyone has lots to spend on equipment or has the space to store all. 



The equipment may also not be the same at all it can be the beans chosen, grinder it self or the mountain of moka pot varieties and brand out there and to choose from that fits your needs and lifestyle. 



A good coffee lover just needs the bare minimum to get them going.



Lastly I want to thank each and everyone of you who stayed with this community through the years or just founded us and decided to stay. 



We are all coffee lovers with the simple task of brewing coffee using the moka pot as your equipment of choice.



We also would like to hear your success stories and failures through out your moka journey. We would like to read all about it in some post.



No shame in failures just a learning opportunity. 



Sorry for the long message sometimes I rumble to much in the finer details.



Hope you all have yourself a good moka brew session.



Thank you all for keep using this coffee brewing tool as your everyday brewer, and making it part of your lifestyle

So i'm gutted. I need 8 fillings which will cost be around £1800 in the UK for white ones, all in my molars and pre-molars. I'm 23F. I won't lie, i only started flossing daily over the past 2 years, but since then it's been daily and I still had carie progression from enamel to D level. I also use a water flosser after manual floss and then brush. I always brush x2 a day and rinse between meals but my downfall was snacking. I used to snack a lot. Things like biscuits, sweets, cereal, fruits.
I'm very active and cycle a few times a week and run. During these activities if im going over 50km on the bike i eat sweets and gels for quick carbs. This along with my diet is likely what has destroyed my teeth and why I need fillings which will cost me time and money which I will have to hunt for as a student.
Since being told about all the fillings i'll need i've stopped snacking and only eat 3 meals a day and rinse after. I've stopped all juices and only eat fruits after meals and rinse after. If i drink tea or coffee i rinse after. If i can't rinse after i go hungry, easy as, because im now extremely concerned about my teeth - it's always good to loose weiMy gum health is good and there is no bleeding, my general health is also decent.

1gmshyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Viking/comments/1gmshyg/a_short_essay_on_viking_violence/,A short essay on viking violence. ,"Was viking society as hyper violent as medieval sources say? I believe that they were. Please take a look and see if any of this rings a bell for you, either if you live in the European north or have visited. I can only speak from my own experience having grown up in northern Sweden, and these are mainly thoughts organized over quite some time. Please take what is useful and kindly inform me where I'm wrong. 

A recurring term in this short essay is ""within your circle"", that is, the people whose nature and demeanor that you know fairly well, but not necessarily knowing them deeply on a personal level. Basically they are part of your group. 



The anthropological cultural evidence for that viking and northern European society was hyper violent is readily available today, visible in the culture of several northern European countries, but the one I'll be referring most to is the culture in Sweden: 

-Take the semi famous photo of Finns queuing for the bus in the middle of winter, about ten people, each standing about two to three meters from the next. That's the vestiges of a survival strategy in a hyper violent society for when you meet people outside your circle: you stay out of pounce range, you don't look at them, you don't face them directly, you don't talk to them, you keep quiet, and you keep your body language minimal, so as to not spook the other person. In viking eyes: you try to avoid them as much as possible, as you don't know if the person has ptsd, is highly anxious or actually proactively violent. 

-The laws of Jante were defined through observation in the 1950s but have most likely been in practice for a very long time, possibly since the viking age. The summary of those laws can be described as: ""don't stick out, and if you act haughty, you're gonna die haughty, because we have yet to find a head so special that it doesn't split in response to an axe"". 

-Dating in the north can be difficult to initiate, because it's often only initiated inside your circle, that is, in the workplace, school, your most frequented places, or during hobbies. The reason being that it was very dangerous to look for a romantic partner outside your circle, so you had to settle with whom you had available. In Sweden, there's often an arbitrary point in a relationship where the conversation goes something like so: ""are we together now?"", ""I guess we are."" And then they have 1.5 children. 

-While an American can chat freely with a cashier or waitress, it takes many visits to get to know a cashier or waitress here in Sweden. The prerequisites being that you're an often occurring regular, and that there aren't a lot of people, to get the regular cashier or waitress ""into your circle"", after those circa (forty?) times, when you have a sense for the other person's nature and demeanor, you can both finally open up and actually talk about something other than the menu. Forty times may be a bit in excess, but it's at least an arbitrary high amount. 

-Your neighbor is not necessarily part of ""your circle"", especially if you live in an apartment complex where turn over can be unpredictable, but they're still your neighbor, so they end up in a special bracket with whom you should talk, but you don't want to, because they're still strangers whom you haven't met enough to gauge their nature, and it's in an enclosed space. Small talk in the stairwell between neighbors is dreaded for the same reason that you don't talk to strangers at the bus stop: the vestiges of high possibility of extreme violence. Small talk, over all, is not desirable in Sweden, as small talk was a shield when dealing with rival and possibly enemy groups, you talk because you are forced to, that means the vestigial possibility of violence was very real. Instead, you reserve deep conversations to your actual circle, to show that you're open to them and friendly. There's a reason why in Swedish, the inherent meaning of the word ""funny"" actually means ""calmly"". Usually said after a long, deep and calm conversation over coffee. 



So what was the reason that viking society was so violent? 
We can summarize it as both nurture and nature: The difficulty of the landscape, the lack of resources, lack of cleared farm land, the short season of back breaking manual farm labor, the long season of wood clearing and food preservation (remember, the potato crop hadn't been introduced yet), rival villages willing and able to plunder you, and the deep snow and darkness half of the year. 
Then there's the nurture, which was ingrained in the religion of the aesir faith, in particular the Norns, who had spun the strings of fate, and it was your duty to pluck your string, the fate which you had been given, which translates as, ""whatever it is you do, make sure you do it well so that you pull your weight"". 

You see some parallels in Japanese history and society, as it also once was a highly violent society for similar reasons, where not being a burden to the group and not standing out was and still is very important, due to both difficult nature and self reinforcing nurture of the group. The biggest difference being that Japanese society is hierarchially tall and highly socially ritualistic, while the European north is fairly hierarchially flat and socially relaxed and chaotic due to the difference in the system of nurture of the group, but both have  the same social goal of ""make sure you contribute with excellence"". That's why both samurai and vikings were extremely violent occupations, because if you were going to be violent, you better do it first, do it well and do it often. 

I don't know who said it, but basically a viking village was a mafia gang, and i think that's close to the truth. Some call the vikings peaceful with the argument of ""they were mostly farmers"". I would argue that the only peaceful farmer is maybe a modern farmer, you ask an American, south African or French farmer, peace is tentative at best. It was probably way worse back in viking society, as raiding neighboring villages at the risk of death may have been preferable to only relying on your own farms, and you got to skip a lot of the back breaking work for very little cost. 

Viking(r) in of itself was an occupation that went out by boat to raid and trade, but if you're going to raid a nearby village, you would bring as many as you could, be they of the vikingr occupation or not. Spears and axes were fairly available due to their resource efficiency, so every able bodied person was probably armed, though everyone probably not armored, during a village raid. Why raid a nearby village? Because they were readily available, too close for comfort and they were as violent as next village. 



These are my thoughts on modern cultural observation related to viking history. I hope you found something useful, and if there's anything you disagree with, please be gentle, haha

I barely get the light switch moment, feel good for 2 weeks until the inevitable crash. It's been a constant crash. I'd be ecstatic to have two weeks depression a month. That's how bad it's been.
I finally reached out  for help,  in officially burnt out. Beyond exhausted.  But I do not have a family doctor. 
I've been offered stress leave before and I always refused, can't afford it. 
But I am going to finance myself. I'm ready to be on EI sick benefits, and use my credit line for the extra stuff that I won't be able to afford
 I got a sound financial plan. After all, I gladly put on 15k renovations on my house, why not use a few grand to heal? 

I've been to our online Maple services.  They can only do two weeks off. They said go to a walk in clinic . 
I go to the walk in. They can only do two weeks. 
Go to the provincial health systems for ppl without doctors
 They can help and follow up. Great i call and go see the doctor . 
He spent 10 minutes telling me how my endocrinologist was a scam. I got scamed because i paid out of pocket and there's nothing wrong with me. I asked him if he is familiar either pmdd. Of course not. Hrt? No my hormones are normal I was scammed. 
Within 5 minutes I was already crying 
 Knowing this is going to be  a shit show. Not only did he not listen to me. He would cut me off when I tried to explain things.
 Tell me i need psychiatrist, not a psychologist , a psychiatrist, he said it 3 times.  because there's nothing wrong with me. 
All I wanted was  a long term stress leave. I am working on myself. Trying HRT, I started seeing a therapist. I'm.doing the work. I just need a break. My work is already talking about demoting me. It's not going well. 
Im refering you to a psychiatrist.  Ok well that  can be well over a years wait. What  can i do in the mean time i ask, intears, I need help today.can you point me in the right direction. He said I already told you if you don't want to  listen it's your problem
 I honestly felt like he was going to tell me I suffered from hysteria and needed my husband to pick me up or something. 

Well I left the office in tears.he gave me two weeks off. I'm giving his paper to his secretary, who absolutely sees me trying not to loose it. She tells me. I think I can read the room and gives me a paper with complaint phone number.she knew exactly what I been through  

Man. This women. What a life saver. Calls me today. She said I thought about you all night. I'm booking you with another doctor and he listens. He's soft. He's believes women. I'm at my wits end with this doctor.  She's like, you  could of gone and offed yourself. Ya! Thank God  I'm not suicidal. Because man did I feel utterly defeated.
She said we cant change anything unless ppl complain. I'm far from the exception. My reaction, is the norm, from.women  leaving his office.  You can bet your ass I'm going to complain  
She said she went to look at my file after because of how I left. Doc never even wrote anything. No notes nothing.

I've been dismissed before. This was beyond. 
I'm getting her a thank you card with 10$ coffee shop gift certificate. And I told her how amazing she was. Above and beyond.

I waited for 4 day and didn’t get any relief and even the pain was occasional which got me thinking. The next day it radiated to a little left which is center abdomen it stayed there for a day and then it radiated to the back side of my kidney area from where it started but this time just opposite side. 
And then the next day I felt a little discomfort in my bladder area and it felt a little hard to urinate and also had to go 12-13 times to pee.

I went to the GP next day and a few more symptoms were added by that time, I had mild testicular pain, burning sensation while urinating, feeling of incompletion of bladder and urgency. After having my ultrasound and abdomen x-ray done, he diagnosed me with mild BPH and constipation, urinalysis and culture were negative. Now, he’s referred me to a urologist and I’m waiting for my appointment. 
TBH I’m still not convinced that I got BPH, is it possible to verify BPH with an ultrasound? He said it’s very rare to have BPH at 23. I told my doc that I do masturbate 3-4 times a month and he said that’s the reason you got BPH. I don’t believe masturbating 3-4 times is considered excessive.
I’ve stopped drinking alcohol, coffee and am totally avoiding dairy products or any highly processed foods. I’ve added variety of fruits to my diet and pumpkin seeds, along with that I’m doing yoga 2 times a day. With these changes my symptoms have relieved, now I only urinate 5-6 times a day(in a period of 16 hours). I pee every 2-2.5 hours, I can control it for more time if I want. The symptoms that I have now are
:-  discomfort in my bladder,  
:- feeling of urinating after 20 minutes of finishing urinating. 
:-Erections aren’t that hard
:- don’t have complete control over my pelvic muscles
:-mild lower back pain 
What steps should I take further?

Some random tidbits about me -

\- After finishing uni past year, I work as a scientist building some random artificial intelligence thingamajigs in biotech (for more technically interested ones - we do machine learning) in London. And no, we do not wear lab coats (most of the times). I am absolutely smitten with what I do and where I am. To be fair, I love science in any form.

\- One of my claim-to-fame moments till now has been being at loo next to a Nobel laureate.

\- I love to read. On some weekends, I sneak away to different cafés, libraries, parks, river banks, and other places in my city to read alone. A dream of mine is to have a big personal library at some point!

\- I am into running, hiking, rambling, biking, and squash. In addition, I am always keen on checking out new sports! Also I really enjoy exploring outdoors, generally with friends.

\- I enjoy cooking, even though I am very slow at it and I am fairly certain that I am not very good at it either. Bonus happiness though if I am doing it with friends.

\- I am very close to my family. And I am the silliest (and definitely the cheekiest) one among them.

\- Regarding music, I listen to a bit of everything, depending on my mood. Having said that, more often I find myself listening to classical and indie. Some of my favourite classical composers include Brahms, Vivaldi, and Dvořák. My city has an incredible music scene, so I sometime find it tough to stop myself from going to too many concerts!

\- I have seen some posts including their MBTI or enneagram type. So if you are interested in that - from all the times I have given the MBTI test, I have been an ENTJ. Similarly for the enneagram tests I have been a number 3. Though I believe it is difficult to profile someone based on just one type alone (also without enough statistics).

\- Here are some more random clichéd things I like. I love going to a wide variety of museums (from art to natural history and more) and spending hours getting lost inside. My personal record till now has been visiting four museums on the same day (Was it stupid? Yes. Do I regret it? Eh, not at all.). With friends, I like exploring independent cafés and sampling hot chocolates. If you are looking for a recommendation, I suggest The Wren Coffee in London for weekdays!

If you have read until this long, thank you for that! I did not want to cut things short. Maybe we have got some shared interests, or perhaps we are total opposites- exciting either way, right? Whether we are kindred spirits or from different galaxies, I am waiting for your message and getting excited to brainstorm the fun experiments in choosing either of those two options ahead.

Good day to you and cheerio!",2,1731097911.0,penpals,0,1.0,False

I'm looking to get some over the ear headphone this winter for Christmas.

I'd like to get some over the ear Bluetooth headphones but I'm not sure what brand or kind would be the best. I have a pair that are wired but they're a bit too big for my head and if I wear them for a long time they hurt my ears (the sides). My ears are kinda small... Any recommendations for over the ear Bluetooth headphones with noise cancellation for small ears? Also that aren't super expensive?

The gum tissues surrounding the lower 4-5 teeth started looking inflamed and granulated. Sometimes, when I drink coffee, my mouth would feel on fire, not just my gums. I went to my general dentist for a cleaning, and they referred me to a periodontist. My follow-up appointment with the periodontist ended up being another cleaning, and she just said it was mild inflammation and that I should get an electric toothbrush, floss, etc. 4 months later, I went to see a different dentist because I felt like I needed a second opinion. By then, the burning in my mouth and gums had gone when I ate certain foods. So I got another cleaning and nothing else. I am hesitant to go to any of the three dentists because the issue persists a year later. At each appointment, I raised the issue of possible gum disease or allergy, but none of them took it seriously. 

I brush daily, but I admit I could be better at flossing. I have an electric toothbrush with soft bristles and a manual brush if I feel like the electric one is too harsh. I switched to Sensodyne recently and started using Therabreath deep clean mouthwash after every floss. It has been a year, and there has been no significant improvement. I think it is getting worse and spreading to my other teeth. I feel no pain or burning in my mouth after eating, but the tissue looks raised, and there is some granulation, which I have no idea why. I am stumped because it is only the lower bottom front teeth. I feel like I'm going crazy. I inserted a picture above for reference. I would greatly appreciate any thoughts and advice.

I'll have an ""unclean"" treat once in a while without going overboard. But I haven't figured out what to do when I'm staying with people or institutions which only serve ""unclean"" food where it would be impolite and/or costly to eat my own food instead. For example, I'm currently staying with a community where I get 3-4 meals a day. 

Breakfast is bread (brown, but not whole wheat) with cheese or jam, yogurt, granola.

Lunch is rather traditional dishes, such as white flour products and breaded mead or sweet main courses such as dumplings with vanilla sauce. Sometimes there's also salad, but is it a side dish so there's one little portion for every one. There's always dessert, which is usually pudding.

Usually, they'll serve coffee and cake in the afternoon.

Dinner is leftovers from lunch, bread, cheese, cold cuts. Sometimes a little fruit is on offer.

The amount of fruit and vegetables is very limited. So far, I have eaten every meal and course because on some days, portions were small and I would have been hungry otherwise. But I'm starting to feel hungry all the time because of blood sugar spikes. 

I think I might forgo the dessert and cake and maybe buy some fruit and dark chocolate in town. But I can't bring my own bread or main dishes. I'm afraid it would seem impolite to remove the coat of breadcrumbs from meat or fish. :/

I am hoping for your advice on whether my itinerary is too overwhelming, too touristy, or if I'm missing out on somewhere special, possibly off the beaten path that you'd recommend over my general plan.

**13 Day Italy Trip in Early May 2025:**

**Day 1: Naples** \- arrive at 11:35am, lunch (pizza!), open to suggestions, hotel is near Decumani

**Day 2: Naples OR Capri** (if we stay in Naples, we'd do Capri day trip via tour group) If we stay in Capri, we want to do a boat tour around the island as well as the chair lift at Anacapri.

**Day 3: Naples OR Capri / Ferry to Sorrento**  \- open to suggestions

**Day 4: Sorrento** \- 8 Hour Day trip to Postiano, Amalfi and Ravello via tour group

**Day 5: Sorrento/ Travel to Rome** \- open to suggestions, hotel is in Celio.

**Day 6: Rome** \- Vatican with Sistine Chapel/St Peter's Basilica

**Day 7 Rome** \- Colosseum / Pantheon / Trevi Fountain then Pasta Cooking Class for Dinner OR do we skip this and take a day trip to Tivoli? We like to walk so I think we could move walking past the Colosseum, Pantheon and Trevi Fountain to day 6. And we could cancel the pasta class and move that to Florence?

**Day 8: Rome/ Train to Florence** \- open to suggestions, hotel is near San Marco

**Day 9:** **Florence** \- Day trip to Siena / San Gimignano - we want to do a relaxing day in wine country.

**Day 10: Florence** \- open to suggestions

**Day 11: Florence/ Train to Venice** \- open to suggestions, hotel is near San Marco

**Day 12: Venice** \- open to suggestions

**Day 13: Venice** \- open to suggestions, airport at 5pm

**Likes**:

\- Architecture

\- Art history

\- Foodies - except not too much seafood

\- Cafes - we love coffee and pastries

\- Being outdoors / walking

\- Excited about water views / country side views

\- Wine & Cocktails

\- Farmers/Artisinal Markets

**Dislikes:**

\- Tourist traps - husband has never been to Italy so I know he wants to see the Sistine Chapel and Colosseum at the minimum.

\- Herds of people - I get really bad anxiety. Yes, I realize that Rome will be exceptionally busy in 2025, but I will deal. That's why I'm hoping for some more recommendations for slower paced excursions/day trips. Yes, I have listed a bunch of touristy places above, but share where I should go instead and I'll update!

\- I'm having a hard time finding place to eat in Venice. Reviews are all over the place. We don't eat oysters/mussels/squid/octopus etc. I know it's in the middle of water, but we are more cooked fish and shrimp people! We would also just be happy with fresh pasta (sans seafood!).

1gmruw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartstoppersyndrome/comments/1gmruw0/i_understand_the_leaves_now/,I Understand the Leaves Now,"Hi!  
TL;DR: This show changed my life and has allowed me to accept love into my life from a place of loving myself first.

So I posted here a while back about how Heartstopper gave me the courage to leave an 8-year toxic relationship. Seeing such a positive depiction of queer intimacy that didn't shy away from the unique challenges that LGBTQ+ relationships face was honestly lifechanging for me. At first, I had a really hard time as I came to terms with the fact that my own relationship didn't feel even remotely close to what I saw on this show. Where Nick and Charlie were responsive to each other's needs, patient, and kind, my (ex) partner would overemphasize anything negative about me, would ignore or deflate my attempts to show affection, and then expected me to be ready to do anything he wanted without regard for my own comfort.

Then I started my masters research on adverse childhood experiences and how their processing is carried into adult romantic relationships. My research validated my feelings by showing that the types of interactions I had with my ex partner were harmful to both of our wellbeing *and* that a relationship with a healthy dynamic could actually be healing for both of us. I tried to communicate what I was learning about, realized he wasn't remotely interested in trying to heal, and I left.

Since I left my partner, I've been exploring my identity quite heavily. I tried drag for the first time, have been more willing to express feminine traits (like having my nails painted), and leaning into relationships with people close to me who express affection and care for me (i.e., my chosen family). It has changed my life.

My self-esteem is in a way better place. I'm starting to love my body, trying to just enjoy experiences without needing to feel productive all the time or worrying what other people will think. I stopped giving my energy to people who have been harmful to me in my life. The thing that stood out to me was how I engaged with potential romantic partners. In the past, I would throw myself into hookups (honestly somewhat dangerously) because I wanted to feel like I was attractive enough or deserving of that kind of attention from another person. It was *not* healthy and almost every single time I would leave those encounters feeling awful about myself. 

As anyone on Grindr can probably attest to, people on there are wild. But I started asking for what I wanted and being the person to say no. There were times I was definitely tempted to ignore red flags (people who were married, people who only wanted to meet in secrecy, people who only wanted to meet me if I was in drag, people who didn't want to see my face if we met up). In the past, I didn't feel secure enough in myself to believe that there could be something better - and it's so hard to see that when examples of healthy relationships for queer people are so few and far between!

I had my first date recently since the breakup. I was concerned it might be too soon, but I honestly think I've been out of my last relationship for a long time and just didn't feel safe to leave. We talked on Tinder, had really amazing conversations that were funny and showed genuine interest in getting to know each other. We both talked about Heartstopper and what the show/comics have meant for us. We met for coffee, and I told myself I was going to go into the date exactly as I am without trying to be anything different. I made a pizza for us, we talked about books, and I gave him a D&D-themed riddle at the end as a kind of invitation to keep getting to know each other. I was *horrified* that I was too much or going to be seen as trying too hard, but he solved the riddle that night and has genuinely engaged with the idea (we now have a mini campaign of side adventures going). He supports my drag, wishes me a good time when I want to go out, and I think there's potential for this to be an actual healthy relationship (but I know it's still soon - I'm VERY actively checking in with my own emotions, going to counselling, trying to be careful not to hurt anyone including myself).

The point is, I put my vulnerable, very extra self out there and the payoff has been incredible. For the first time in my life, I feel like I ""get"" the Heartstopper leaves. The ""sparks"" don't feel like lust for me - it's more like a warmth that makes me feel good about myself and wanting to share that good feeling with someone else. My brain just kind of melts at the small signs of care and it feels amazing - I've literally never felt this way in my entire life.

We accept the love we think we deserve. I recently watched The Perks of Being a Wallflower and that theme really resonated with me. I'm realizing from all of this that healthy intimacy is accepting love while also loving ourselves. I can't believe it took me this long to understand what that feels like.
