I’m a 33-year-old married Indian man from Vancouver, Canada. Life's been busy lately, and I'm looking to relax and unwind with some good conversation. I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

Thanks!",1,1766557261.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False
1pugfc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiForSmallBusiness/comments/1pugfc1/was_getting_sick_of_ai_sdr_tools_promising_magic/,"Was getting sick of "" AI SDR "" tools promising magic, then delivering 1% response rates that murdered my domain rep.","So I built something different over a weekend.

(same hoodie, too much coffee, you know the drill).

**What Actually Worked**

Instead of scraping 10K emails and blasting templates, mine stalks each prospect like a detective pulls their LinkedIn, recent posts, and company site pain points. Then writes emails that reference actual specifics.

Like ""Saw your Q3 cold chain expansion, hitting that $1m SDR capacity wall yet?"" vs generic ""I help B2B companies with sales.""

The first batch got 4% replies. Fixed the targeting logic, next test hit 18-22%.

**Real Test Numbers**

Sent 1K emails total:

* Old way would've gotten 12 responses, maybe 2 calls
* This got 64+ responses, 18 calls booked

Basically replaced what 2 - 3 SDRs cost monthly for a one time build + cheap hosting.

Built it compliant with public data only, opt-outs, no scraping violations.

Honestly still tweaking the pain point detection but it's working way better than the $500/month tools I tested.

I dont have a college degree. Everyone in my life - my parents, friends, extended family, coworkers - thinks I graduated from state university in 2019 with a degree in business administration. I did not. I dropped out halfway through junior year and never went back.

When I dropped out I was so ashamed I just... didnt tell anyone. I kept pretending to go to classes, spent time at the library or coffee shops, continued to post on social media like everything was normal. Then when ""graduation"" came around I faked being sick and said I'd just get my diploma mailed.

I moved to a different city after that and got a job that didn't require degree verification (small family owned business). When my parents ask about my degree I change the subject or make vague comments. I have fake student loan statements that I created myself to show my mom when she asks about my loans.

Its been 5 years of living this lie and Im exhausted. The guilt is eating me alive but I dont know how to come clean now. How do I tell my parents who helped pay for 2.5 years of college that I dropped out and have been lying about it this entire time?

My mom brags to her friends about her daughter the college graduate. My dad has my fake degree hanging in his office. The longer this goes on the worse it gets but I feel trapped.

I want to go back and actually finish but im terrified that if I enroll again someone will find out I never graduated the first time. This secret is destroying me and I have no one I can talk to about it.",1,1766557028.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

 I just wanna ask if tama ba yung steps na gagawin ko dito? First time ko gumamit ng whitening strips / oral rinse sticks. Medyo stained ngipin ko kasi I drink coffee, tea at may konting filing din ako sa may front part ng ngipin.



Morning time:

\- 1/2 tbsp of salt with 1 cup of lukewarm water, gargle for 30 secs and spit

\- Brush with Sensodyne Repair and Protect

\- Use straw if possible when drinking coffee or tea and rinse with water



Lunch time: 

\- Brush and floss



Evening time: (Dito ako nalilito)

\- Brush with wet toothbrush only (no toothpaste) and floss

\- Wipe and dry the teeth with tissue paper, then apply the strips and avoid the gums. I've watched a video na you can actually cut it in half para hindi sayang? Idk kasi yung sobra e fofold naman din sa likod. Not sure if okay gawin

\- Then apply the strips for 30-60 mins

\- Peel off the strips and rinse with lukewarm water

\- After peeling and rinsing do I need to brush again this time with toothpaste? or no? 

and can I use mouthwash (colgate plax peppermint fresh - no alcohol) after? if yes, do I need to wait 30 mins?



I read an advise din to follow ""white diet"" basically if it would stain a white T-shirt, it will stain your teeth. Tama ba?



Lastly, after using the whitening strips for 7 days how long should I wait para gumamit ulit? and how about the whitening oral rinse stick? do I use it like a regular mouthwash and is it only for 7 days rin ba?

a lady came in and ordered an 8oz ""room temperature"" (her exact words) oat flat white. okay dope. im on bar and i get to making her drink right away. i accidentally steamed the milk a little too hot, so i put a splash of cold oat milk in before pouring the steamed milk (maybe this is bad form, i don't know haha). poured it and served it to her. it was decently hot, it was definitely a kids temp drink. all very normal. she grabs it, makes a face, and says: ""uh yeah this... isnt hot enough, remake it."" no please, no sorry, just an order. kind of stunned, i take it back and immediately make her a new drink, which was inconvenient because i had a line of tickets i had to get to. her new drink was pretty much a standard kids temp oat flat white (done based off of milk texture in my shop). honestly i was kind of proud even, the milk was super silky and i got a nice tulip out of it. i hand her her new drink, to which her immediate reaction is to ask why the drink is ""so dark"". i was just kind of in stunned silence at this point. she took a sip and declared that it was the right temperature, but it ""wasn't foamy enough"". she stood there frowning with her arms crossed, and i was kind of tired of this goldilocks situation so i apologized, explained that for it to be foamier it would have to be hotter and just started working on my next tickets, since there was a decent line up. maybe that was a bad move, but i also dont make tips so i dont bend over backwards for rude customers. this lady got back in line and demanded a refund, stating that her ""coffee tasted burnt"" and that my drink just wasn't good. we send her on her way to get a refund, and my coworker tells me that she's done that whole routine many times before at our shop. i was really annoyed the remainder of the shift, but my coworkers and i were able to laugh about it almost immediately after. very bizarre experience, i hope she's able to find her just right oat flat white somewhere someday lmao.

to end on a positive note, an irish man came in the next day and ordered a flat white. when he tried it, he told me that it was a great flat white and that it ""hit like guiness just without the alcohol"". an australian customer also complimented my flat white, which is very high praise. i have faith in my flat whites!",4,1766556722.0,barista,0,1.0,False

We forgot last night and even after “sprinkling” some cinnamon powder on Scarlett, while my wife was jumping in the air Stuart “look what I can do!” style, I forgot to move her when they were out of the house for a few hours this afternoon. My middle child (8 yo and still believes in the magic) thought it was a good idea to move her to the coffee table with a pair of tongs (Scarlett was perched upon the wrought iron coaster holder that is usually only half full because my 4 yo loves to break one of them every 6-7 month). 2 important notes here. 1) allegedly (I wasn’t there), she did clank them together vigorously several times, and 2) she did not touch her with her hands…ONLY the tongs (this IS acceptable as we have had to move her like this in the past). 

While finishing my final prep for the big family Christmas Eve dinner, my wife texted me shortly after retiring to bed to remind me to move her, not knowing I already did and was sending her a photo.

[https://imgur.com/a/k6Cizow](https://imgur.com/a/k6Cizow)

I was expecting a quick response, but nothing. Couple minutes…nada. I pop into the bedroom and I see she’s got her phone in her hand. I walked over and asked if she saw my text…she pulled it up and was a little hesitant at the idea because the kids may think we are the ones moving her. 

I was really hoping to get a good laugh out of my wife…but she has her reservations. She thinks it insinuates that we are the ones moving her, but my intention is to:

1) Make light of my middle daughter moving her earlier, which I think she will wholeheartedly get and chuckle about it like the other spots Scarlett enjoys moving around to. 

2) Because my 4 yo son wrote his name with the E like that (4 lines) on a drawing for a tree ornament for my in-laws.

TL/DR: Our elf is asking my kids who moved her after she was touched yesterday and didn’t get moved over night. My wife thinks the note is a bad idea because 2 of our 3 kids will think we move her. ",1,1766556722.0,AITAH,2,0.67,False

Year-end holidays have always had a special place in my heart. Because my wife and my US-based employers don’t give us much work during this time. 😆

We generally utilise this time to hang out with friends and family away from home. This year, however, due to our academic commitments alongside work, we couldn’t plan many gatherings due to late-evening and weekend class schedule. But the universe has been kind. It slowly brought me closer to my love for coffee toward the end of the year, opened new doors and created new avenues, connected me with people who would get me access to more “exquisite” coffees, and fill our fridge with Kombucha and coffee smell. 👃 

I hope your holidays are fun even if not free. Have a great rest of your year and happy Christmas Eve!

1pug48y,https://www.reddit.com/r/byler/comments/1pug48y/byler_symbolism/,byler symbolism,"OK so yk how in season 4, Mike and Will are burying the dead guy who gave them the pen? when Will looks at him and Mike looks back, they both stop shoveling but then mike looks back down and keeps shoveling. And i think that’s a symbolism to Mike burying his feelings for Will. And Will too, burying his feelings for mike. Especially because after this, Will tells Mike that El commissioned the painting. NOW, if you notice, in season 5. Mike and Wills flirty scene in the field, Mike is holding a shovel and Will is not. Mike is not using the shovel in that scene, he’s just holding it. And, instead of burying something with the shovel later, he digs something up (the tunnels). Which could probably mean he’s digging up his feelings for will and they will be revealed soon. Especially because when he digs, he bursts a pipe which I feel could be symbolism for his feelings for Will bursting out. I KNOW HOW THIS SOUNDS. I know it sounds delusional but I honestly think it could be intentional. Especially considering that later on, Mike and Will are both trying to contain the water in the pipes (A.K.A, their feelings). They could’ve literally chosen any other two characters to be containing the water in the pipes but they decided Will and Mike which I think is intentional. Also, I need to point out that I think the military men bursting the door open while Mike and Will are trying their hardest to keep it closed is a symbolism again for their feelings. They then slip on the water (their feelings) and the door burst open revealing that maybe their feelings will be revealed later in this season. I also want to mention one of the soldiers says “it’s about time” which i think could be a reference for “it’s about time to come out”. ALSO, Derek is between them in this season and he’s wearing a rainbow shirt. Coincidence? I think not. Also, back to the field scene, while they’re all walking, Joyce says the line “give him time, it hasn’t been that long” when referring to Derek but I think since this turns into a Will and Mike scene, it could give us a hint and be saying “Mike needs time”. Mike and Will’s conversation is interrupted by the hatch being opened which could mean a door is being opened figuratively and their feelings will be revealed. Notice how there’s also a signal tower between them and Robin said something about signals, which they were literally shown doing in that scene. Also, the scene of Mike getting coffee in the hospital and Will getting soda in the hospital are parallels to each other. For Will, when he walks through the halls, he stumbles across a door where he sees Robin and Vickie kissing. For Mike, yes, he finds the ‘Wrinkle in Time’ book, but there’s notably a huge hard to miss incomplete puzzle with rainbows on it. This could signify that Mike is confused about his feelings regarding his sexuality. He’s puzzled. Another thing is Mikes closet literally being torn open by Ted when the demogorgan attacks him. It’s opening. Meaning, Mike is probably gonna come out and has nowhere to hide anymore. These are just ideas! This doesn’t mean it’s for sure signs but I just find them interesting.

1pug48l,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1pug48l/aphrodisia/,Aphrodisia,"It wasn't love at first sight. It was lust. The moment she walked into the bar she had my full attention. I noticed everything about her. How her long dark raven hair flowed down her back in waves. The wondrous vixen's long legs moving daintily in her tight dark grey leggings as though she knew how attractive she was and I wouldn't be surprised if it was on purpose. Her hips were perfect and her breasts full and sumptuous in her grey silver blouse. Her neck slender and jawline perfectly feminine. And of all the men in the bar she had looked at, she could have chose, those lively sage green eyes fell upon me. Her thin lips curved into a open smirk. Which I suppose was only fair since I suppose I must have been gaping like a hungry wolf at her. But the difference between me and every other dumb bastard in that bar was far and away and quite staggering if i'm being honest; I wasn't some rich wall street yuppie, but I made enough to stand out. I am pretty damn good looking too with the blended physique of strength and aesthetics. A little fat to be honest but in all the right places if you know what I mean.

I shut my mouth and grinned softly and thought about waving her over to me but decided fuck that, as we both appeared to share the same thought; For a brief moment I wondered if it was deeper than lust as we both started towards each other, nonchalantly and with easy strides, as though nothing and no one else in the bar mattered. Which to me, didn't.

""Hey there, good looking,""

I just couldn't help myself and I was surprised how confident I sounded saying it too. Even more surprised by how I boldly wrapped a powerful arm tight around her waist and pulled her against me, feeling just how warm she was and I was sure glad I did help myself in not getting too excited. Just barely though as I watched that smirk become an open lovely grin.

""Aren't you pretty bold?"" She laughed with what I thought was embarrassment.

But then I found out it was amusement from how she looked at me without any blush on her pale face as she didn't try to push me away; Instead pushing herself against me further as she grabbed my free wrist affectionately, those lively sage green eyes never leaving my azure blue eyes.

I honestly couldn't think of anything charismatic to say so I just told her the truth.

""Fortune favors the bold and baby, maybe she'll favor me tonight,""

I matched her grin, feeling lightheaded and my heart racing a thousand miles a minute but never feeling more sure of what I needed to do in this moment with this mysterious vixen.

""Does lady fortune have a name?""

""Illa. And what about you, crazy?""

""Archer. Nice to meet you Illa,""

I took her hand holding my wrist into my own hand and softly kissed it, getting another whiff of her fresh rose fragrance, before letting go and meeting her eyes again.

""You want a drink?""

I offered before thinking about it for a few seconds, considering how different she was from the usual group of women that visited the bar.

""Or maybe you want to get out of here and have a bite or something?""

""Well I was thinking about having a drink or two but having a bite sounds nice too,""

Her voice was actually mellifluous, velvet smooth and calming unlike other women whose voice betrayed their appearance. Sometimes catastrophically. Not that I minded or really cared for, but it was another good thing to add for this almost surreal dream like moment. I almost had this inane worry that if she pinched me I would wake up in the alley outside the bar, hungover. And as if she had read my mind, she glided her hand up my arm slowly before pinching my tricep.

""Day dreaming isn't going to land me in your bed tonight,""

My grin became wolfish and I felt something foreign bloom in my heart but not immediately recognizing it in the heat of the moment, as I slid my arm around her down and cupped her ass firmly. Not too thick which was good enough for me and that did make her cheeks flush like roses as she giggled and swatted at my hand.

""I know a good place. Just for a casual bite. Nothing too fancy though,""

""Good enough,""

I held her lovely green gaze for a moment, wanting to push my paper thin luck and kiss her, just briefly, but not daring to have the balls to as I wrapped my arm back around her and led her out of the bar and to my car.

I would have my chance later.

Later, as we sat together in the booth of the diner with coffee in hands and some light sandwiches, I was silently thanking God for the serendipity of meeting Illa as we ate.

""Told you this was a good place,"" I said as I carefully dabbed at my mouth with a napkin,"" Good prices, convenient hours, no rats running amok all over, and best of all, actual good food,""

""How'd you find this little slice of heaven?"" She asked softly as looked at me.

""Oh, you know, you get bored enough you'll do anything to stave it off and for me it was driving around, looking for anything interesting. And when I surprisingly couldn't find it at all in this badland of a city, I needed to rest and so I found this,"" I waved my hand around the place,"" Which i'm pretty grateful for mind you. I got to know some of the regulars here like Sally over there,"" I motioned to her waiting a table of some nice people,"" She's been here fifteen years if you can believe it. Doesn't mind it at all. She's always happy to see Arnold over there in the corner. He doesn't say much but he's always been convivial with her and treated her nice,""

""How long have you been coming here?"" Illa asked with curiosity, as she brushed back a loose strand of her long raven hair from her face.

""Two weeks,""

""And you know these people pretty well in two weeks?"" She asked incredulously with a hint of skepticism on her face.

""Hard to believe, huh? But it doesn't take me long to know someone. Especially with a good looking face like mine,"" I smiled confidently as I placed my hand over hers.

""Bold and confident,"" Illa softly laughed as she turned her hand palm up to hold mine,"" You're right. This is a good place. Almost makes me believe in the American Dream,""

I smirked like how she had smirked when she first saw me.

""Oh after tonight, i'll make you a full fledged believer in it,""

She smirked back.

""I don't know...I have doubts,"" She challenged me.

""That's okay,"" I said cooly, before pulling her against me and whispering in her ear,"" When I have you pinned under me in my bed tonight, we'll see about those doubts,""

Illa nuzzled her head against mine softly and didn't say anything for a moment. I pinched her arm.

""Day dreaming isn't going to make me go away,"" I grinned wolfishly against her warm cheek.

""I hope not,"" She murmured softly, almost lower than a whisper.

My grin faltered as I caught the change in mood with her. I rubbed her side reassuringly.

""Hey now, don't go falling in love now,"" I teased with a soft smile.

But truth be told, that foreign bloom in my heart hadn't went away at all and I was dreading to recognize what it was; Dreading it because if I didn't see her again after tonight I think I would go mad with an endless ache and loneliness I would feel until I met her again. Oh God, take your own advice.

Her somber expression softened into a smirk before she looked at me and that smirk bloomed into a genuine smile and I felt something confirming that foreign bloom.

Well fuck, I thought helplessly to myself.

""You know, I don't think i'll ever meet anyone like you. I know how fucking crazy that sounds. What, we met only hours ago?"" She laughed incredulously,"" But honestly, to be completely honest with you Archer, I just have this feeling that no one else has ever given me,""

I wanted to offer a joke but seeing at how her sage green eyes truly met mine, like I was someone more than just an easy fuck, more than a partner, I dare say, it just hit me like a crystal bullet of clarity. I didn't want to believe it, what if this is just emotion talking? What if this is just for this night only? I never once felt anything like this, what I felt with Illa, with all the woman I had slept with or met. Why now? Was God truly sending me a sign to change my ways?

Fuck it. Take the chance. If you regret it, you'll live and life will move on. But if it is what you hope it is...then.

I cupped her warm cheek with one hand and then leaned into her to tenderly touch my lips against her soft, supple lips with a kind of love I didn't know I was capable of and let it linger as I felt her hands cup my cheeks as she returned the kiss with her own passion.

And when it was over, I pulled back enough to look in those lovely sage green eyes to see life in them, more than when I had pulled her against me. I felt my heart racing a thousand miles a minute, my face warm and I know was flushed.

""You're not crazy,"" my confident voice coming out barely more than whisper,"" Maybe I am but not you,""

She laughed softly before wrapping her arms tight around my neck and in return I wrapped my powerful arms tight around her waist and pulled her close against me, nuzzling my head against hers lovingly before almost laughing as I heard Sally say softly in the background to someone, probably Arnold:

I came back in pieces.

Light first. Too bright. Then sound—beeping, low voices, the hiss of oxygen. My body felt like it had been taken apart and put back together wrong. Every breath scraped. My mouth tasted like metal and antiseptic.

A woman leaned over me, face swimming in and out of focus. Blonde hair tucked into a nurse’s cap. Serious eyes.

“You’re in Longyearbyen Hospital,” she said slowly, like talking to someone drunk. “You’re safe.”

Safe felt like a lie, but I didn’t argue. Arguing took energy.
They kept asking questions.

Names. Where we came from. How long we’d been exposed. Why we were out on the ice with no gear, no radio, no sled, half frozen to death.
I didn’t answer.

Not because I couldn’t. Because I wouldn’t.

Every time someone tried, I went slack. Eyes unfocused. Let my words slur just enough to sound wrong. Delirious. Shocked. Hypothermia brain. The kind of patient doctors warn interns about—awake but not there.

Maya did the same.

I could hear it in her voice when they spoke to her in the next bed over. Short answers. Wrong answers. Rambling half-sentences that went nowhere. Crying once, just enough to sell it.

They believed us.

They wanted to believe us.

Because the alternative—two teenagers trekking out of the high Arctic with those injuries, those burns, that level of frostbite—didn’t make sense. And people don’t like things that don’t make sense.

—

They kept us there for a long time.

Weeks blurred into each other. IVs. Heat blankets. Skin checks. Doctors arguing quietly at the foot of my bed. Frostbite damage assessed and reassessed. My fingers were bad. Two toes worse. Maya’s foot looked… wrong. Swollen, mottled, angry in a way that told you it was never going to be the same.

She took it without complaint.

Neither of us gave them any real info.

Not once.

The staff thought we were trauma-locked, refusing to speak about whatever happened “out there.” They brought in a psych consult. Nice guy. Soft voice. Asked if we were attacked by a polar bear.

I nodded vaguely and stared past him like the answer was written on the wall.

Eventually, they stopped asking why and focused on keeping us alive.
Recovery was slow.

Painkillers dulled the edges but never erased anything. My hands healed crooked. One finger never straightened again. Walking felt like stepping on broken glass for a while. Maya learned to hide her limp the way some people learn to hide accents—automatic, unconscious.

They wanted to transfer us south. Oslo. Rehab facilities. Psych units.

We nodded. Smiled. Agreed.

They flew us down under medical escort—commercial this time, quiet, tucked into the back rows with blankets and paperwork. No handcuffs. 
No guards. Just nurses and forms and sympathetic looks that slid off me like water.

I slept most of the flight. Or pretended to. Every time I closed my eyes too long, I was back on the ice, or under red light, or hearing bells where there shouldn’t be bells.

Oslo hit different the moment we landed.

Too alive. Too normal.

People arguing about luggage. Kids whining. Coffee smells and perfume and heated air blasting through vents. No one screaming. No one dying. No one hunting anything.

That scared me more than the Arctic ever did.

They put us in a rehab facility just outside the city—clean, modern, all glass and pale wood and plants that were definitely real. Separate rooms, but same wing. “So you can support each other,” the social worker said, like this was a group project.

We played the part.

We took meds. Did physical therapy. Answered questions badly on purpose. I forgot dates. Maya mixed up names. We told overlapping but useless stories—fell through ice, wandered, got lost, storms, exhaustion. It fit well enough. It always does when people want it to.

—

We didn’t escape in some big, cinematic way. 

We just… slipped.

That rehab place outside Oslo ran on routine. Medication rounds. 
Physical therapy blocks. Visiting hours. Shift changes so predictable you could set your watch by them. People like to think systems are strong because they’re orderly. Really, that’s what makes them fragile.

You watch long enough, you see the gaps.

Maya noticed it first. 

Night nurse on Wing C—older guy, gentle, distracted. Smelled like peppermint. He did his rounds at 02:10 on the dot. Stayed five minutes too long in Room 314 because one of the patients liked to talk. Always liked to talk.

That gave us a window.

At 02:12, Maya slid her IV line. I did the same, slower—my hands still didn’t quite work right—but quiet enough.

Bare feet on polished floors. The cold bit instantly.

We packed bags. Stole clothes, cash, and documents.

We waited for a night when the wind rattled the windows hard enough to mask sound. When the building felt sleepy and inward.


We didn’t take the elevator. Stairs only. Cameras didn’t cover the service stairwell between the second and first floors—old blind spot, probably meant for maintenance. Maya had clocked it days earlier.

At the fire exit, we pushed through the door and disappeared into the Norwegian winter.

The first rule of hiding is movement.

Not constant—but unpredictable.

We never stayed anywhere longer than three weeks. Usually less. 
Hostels, farms, closed-for-the-season campsites, the occasional abandoned house that still had a roof and fewer questions. Sometimes cities. Sometimes nowhere. We crossed borders the old way—on buses, on foot, through rides paid in cash and silence.

We changed names like weather.

I was Ron. Elias. Erik. Once, briefly, Tom. Maya became Lena, Kat, Ana. Names that didn’t stick long enough to feel like lies—just placeholders.

Burner phones lived for days, not weeks. We never used the same Wi-Fi twice. If we needed internet, it was libraries, cafes, train stations. Always layered. Always assuming someone was watching even when no one was.

Especially when no one was.

We worked when we had to. Kitchens. Cleaning crews. Seasonal labor. Maya fixed bikes and small engines when her foot allowed it. I did security once, which was almost funny in a way that hurt. Cash under the table. No questions asked if you didn’t ask them first.

—

At night, we hunted something else.

Benoit.

But we both knew.

Benoit wasn’t done.

Tracking a ghost takes patience.

Officially, Agent Sara Benoit didn’t exist anymore. Her name vanished from public records less than a month after the Arctic incident. 
NORAD issued a bland internal memo about “organizational restructuring.” A few fringe forums noticed gaps—missing data, satellite blind spots over the Pole that no one could explain—but nothing solid.

So we looked sideways.

We followed money. Shell nonprofits tied to “polar research.” Defense contractors with sudden budget spikes labeled meteorological resilience. A private logistics firm that quietly rerouted flights every December to the same latitude band, always just short of the Pole.

We found her because she got sloppy.

Not loud-sloppy. Not rookie-sloppy. Tired-sloppy. The kind that comes from thinking the board’s been cleared and no one’s left to come after you.

We finally cornered her in Colorado.

Not Denver. Too obvious. Not Springs either. It was a small mountain town west of Boulder—tourist-quiet in winter, forgettable enough to disappear into. One main road. A grocery store. A bar that closed early. The kind of place people move to when they want distance, not attention.

We found her house three nights after we confirmed the address.

Single-story. Cedar siding. Snow shoveled clean. Lights on a timer. The kind of place that pretends nothing bad has ever happened inside it.

She hadn’t changed that habit.

We watched it for two nights before we moved.

Same routine both times. One car in the driveway. Black SUV. Government plates swapped for dealer frames, but the suspension gave it away—reinforced. Someone with resources. Someone who expected trouble eventually, just not from us.

On the second night, we saw the kids.

Not kids kids. Late teens. Early twenties. Two boys, one girl. They came in separate rides, staggered by half an hour like it was casual, like this was just some meetup. All of them had that look—tight shoulders, eyes that never stopped scanning, bodies already half-trained.

Expendables.

""She was already rebuilding,"" I said between gritted teeth.

“Of course, she is,” Maya muttered, watching the house through binoculars from the tree line. “You don’t nuke the North Pole and retire.”

That night we went in.

We didn’t have real guns.

Not the kind that could be traced, anyway.

The printers had done their job in pieces—frames, slides, internals—printed in three different cities, paid in cash, assembled only once we were sure no one was watching.

We cut the power first.

Not at the house—too obvious—but at the junction box a hundred yards downhill, where the line dipped under snow and rock. The lights in the house flickered once, then went dark.

Backup generator kicked in seconds later.

No drama. No kicking doors. We came in through the mudroom window, the one angled away from the road and shielded by stacked firewood. I went first, dropped inside, swept left, then right.

—

The house looked lived-in, but controlled. Bookshelves neat. Shoes lined up. Nothing sentimental anywhere you could see it.

The hallway opened into a small study at the back of the house.
Warm lamp light. Bookshelves. A desk with papers stacked too neatly to be casual. A mug that was still steaming.

She was sitting in the chair behind the desk, hands folded, legs crossed at the ankle—like she’d been waiting for a meeting to start. A glass of whiskey sat half-finished in her hand, the ice nearly melted. No weapon in sight.

She didn’t look surprised.

She looked… weary.

“Close the door,” she said mildly. “You’re letting the cold in.”

I didn’t move.

Maya stepped up beside me, pistol steady, muzzle level with Benoit’s head.

Benoit smiled. Not smug. Not cruel. Pleased.

“I wondered how long it would take,” she said. “I was hoping you’d wait a year. Heal more. But I guess that was never really your style.”

I stepped fully into the room and shut the door behind me, training my semiautomatic on her.

Benoit slid a manila folder across the desk toward us with two fingers.

“Before you do whatever you came here to do,” she said, “you should probably see this.”

I didn’t touch it.

Maya did. She reached out with her free hand, flipped it open.
Inside were documents. Clean. Official. Seals and signatures and dates that lined up too well to be fake.

Death certificates.

Two of them.

We were both officially dead. Location: Somewhere in the Arctic Circle. Cause of death: possible hypothermia, exposure. Bodies unrecovered.” She tapped a folder on the desk.

“Congratulations,” Benoit said quietly. “You don’t exist anymore. On paper, anyway. No warrants. No flags. No one is going to be looking for you.”

“You knew we weren’t dead, didn’t you?” I asked.

“Of course, I knew,” She met my eyes. “I trained you too well to believe the story.”

Maya’s finger tightened on the trigger. “Why?” she snapped. “Why use us? Why lie? Why pull the trigger for us?”

Benoit looked at her then. Really looked.

“Because I knew you still had some humanity,” she said, “you would’ve tried to save people. And then there would still be a Sovereign. And more kids would disappear. Every December. Forever.”

I shook my head. “You don’t get to decide who’s worth saving.”

She leaned forward slightly. “That’s the only thing this job is.”

“Don’t dress it up,” I said. “You’re a monster.”

She didn’t flinch—but the smile faded for good.

“Maybe I am. But if you’re going to make a habit of hunting monsters,” she said quietly, “you’re going to learn something real fast.”

“What?” Maya asked.

“The hunt never ends,” Benoit replied. “You kill one, another rises. You cut off a head from the hydra, the body adapts. You don’t get clean victories. You just decide how much blood you’re willing to stand in.”

Benoit leaned back in her chair, eyes steady.

“One day,” she said, calm as ever, “you’re going to look in the mirror and see a monster staring back at you. And you’ll realize I was right.”

I stared at her for a long second after that.

Not because she scared me.

But because part of me hated that she sounded so sure.

“Well?” she asked. “Do you expect me to beg for my life now?”

She sighed. “If you’re going to do it, just get it over with. I’m tired.”

That landed wrong.

Like she’d already accepted this as another cost in a long list of acceptable losses.

My finger was on the trigger.

I didn’t pull it.

For half a heartbeat, I hesitated.

Not because I forgave her.

Not because I believed her.

Because killing her wouldn’t bring Nico back. Because pulling that trigger would lock something in me that I wasn’t sure I could unlock again.

Maya didn’t hesitate.

The round punched through Benoit’s chest and slammed her back into the chair. Papers exploded off the desk, whiskey glass shattering.

Benoit gasped. 

She looked down at herself, then back up at us.

I don’t remember deciding to shoot.

I just remember the sound.

I fired. Once. Twice. Three times. The recoil slammed into my palms, familiar and grounding, like the Vault all over again. Benoit jerked with each hit, the chair skidding backward until it hit the wall hard enough to crack the plaster.

Maya kept firing too.

We didn’t aim carefully. We didn’t pace ourselves. We just unloaded.
Every shot felt like something breaking loose inside my chest—anger I never got to scream, grief I never got to bury properly, every frozen night and every bell-ringing laugh stitched together into noise and recoil and muzzle flash.

Benoit slid sideways out of the chair, hitting the floor in a heap that didn’t look important anymore. Blood pooled fast, dark against the pale wood.

I kept shooting.

Click.

I pulled the trigger again.

Click.

My slide locked back.

Empty.

The room rang with the echo of gunfire and nothing else. My ears were screaming. My hands were shaking so hard I had to grip the frame with both of them just to keep it from slipping.

Maya’s gun clicked empty a second later.

Neither of us moved.

Benoit didn’t either.

For a long moment, we just stood there, guns hanging uselessly in our hands, breathing too hard in a room that suddenly felt very small.

We didn’t stay long after that.

We wiped down everything we’d touched. 

We stepped back out through the mudroom window, pulled the snow back into place as best we could, and vanished into the trees the same way we’d come.

—

We didn’t stay in Colorado long. Not even a night. By dawn we were already gone, moving south, then west, then nowhere in particular. 
Same rules as before. Never predictable. Never comfortable.

We’re still in hiding.

Different countries. Different seasons. Different names that never last long enough to feel real. Sometimes we’re together. Sometimes we split for months at a time, just in case someone’s watching the other. We leave no trail worth following.

December still comes. Lights still go up. Kids still get told comforting lies about rewards and watchful eyes and benevolence wrapped in red. 

Some nights, when it’s quiet enough, I still hear bells.

First of all, I will establish that I suspect having an anxiety disorder, although I have no way of proving it because I am broke. 

That being said, here's the thing: I cannot sleep, and when I do sleep I wake up consistently at 6 AM. Forcing myself to fall asleep again will just end up in me waking up at 8 AM, several hours before my alarm. And yet I don't exactly feel tired, just frustrated that I can't fall back asleep that I end up doomscrolling on my phone (as it used to lull me back to sleep)

I used to have a way smoother sleep routine and my hygiene hasn't changed much if at all. I don't drink coffee, just tea. Melatonin doesn't work unfortunately.

Make sure you're serious for looking for introverted friendship and not something to pass the time away for the holidays.

Yeah, I should update this post to let people know that I'm being serious that don't join the Discord server if you don't know what Sleep Token is as that's my Discord server and that makes myself look embarrassing that I've people coming in their asking what that band is about.

If you click on my bio, your answer would've already been answered what Sleep Token is about if you would've just clicked on my social link.

Yeah, a few people had to be kicked out of the Discord server for asking these questions.

What are you talking about in this Discord server? Yeah, I've no clue what Sleep Token is and is this a band? Who are you talking about the deity Sleep?

Yeah, I'm so confused about what you're talking about.

Well yeah, didn't I say don't join the Discord server if you've no clue what Sleep Token is 😭

That's on my bio on my Reddit bio 😂

With that being said, I should update my post from a few deleted chat request I had to send the other day questioning my introvert level, that's quite funny to be honest that you want to say you're more introverted than me when most people become not introverted when birthdays and holidays hit.

However, I go out only 1-once a week and sometimes twice a week because I've to go get groceries which I believe most normal introverted people do and only go outside for grocery shopping and buying gifts.

Yeah, there isn't a soul in sight, that takes me seriously enough in person and SOME people even online claim that I'm not introverted enough. Yeah, the thing is I don't enjoy being around people in person, when a cashier ask how are you and you've to say ''I'm fine, even though you're not fine and you put on a fake face I'm happy attitude.''

Scrolling on this subreddit half the users don't qualify as a NEET and there are fake NEETS here (working full time jobs, the users admitting they're working full time jobs and wanting to meet in real life to do things.) Hilarious I know 🤣

To be honest I don't think nobody reaches a stage of chronic depressed level or NEET level until you've dental issues because of lack of neglect taking care of yourself, there are some days where you don't brush your hair every few hours and even your teeth because all you want to do is just rot away in your bed.

Yeah, the thing is people don't realize that people with chronic depression don't have access to help with poor hygiene in the U.S. dental care is a luxury in the U.S. and some family members don't care to get a chronic depressed family member dental help/aid. Yeah, the truth is my bed is my couch where I watch YT, listen to music, play my Nintendo and PS4 console.

Yeah, once I receive an apartment for the waiting list that I'm on my bedroom is basically my living room space and where I rot away every single day, doing the same stuff on repeat and that doesn't bother me.

Yeah, with that being said I was/were told that energy drinks even plant based and even tea from nature sources can erode your teeth over time.

However, you know you will hit rock bottom in life when you drink caffeine almost every day and sometimes every two days, but you can't stop drinking the coffee because you've become fully grasped in energy codeine cny to function/be caffeine high and you need the caffeine. Caffeine makes me feel at least a decent functioning human being, without caffeine not so much.

Which yeah, that reminds me to say on my last post here and this will be my last post for a while here, but the facts are true.

Social security income/SSI is different per-state and per-country. The rules aren't the same for every single state and country.

However, it's true of what I said in my last post. I'm too broke to see anyone and I would rather just be best friends online, occasionally maybe for birthdays and Christmas we can mail each other stuff.

Yeah, the only thing I've money for is rent, bills, things that food stamps don't cover, fast food and band merchandise 🤣 In my state, SSI doesn't allow others to pay for your plane ticket and yeah SSI at least in my state does interactions if you fly out of state. Yeah, I'm so rock bottom that I'll be living in an apartment complex that accepts government aid, SSI and food stamps.

The rest of my bio is on my pinned post, please read that pinned post to make sure I'm a good friendship match for you, all messages saying hi, how are you and anything basic will be ignored.",0,1766555777.0,NEETr4r,1,0.5,False

On days that I do not exercise, I do not crave it, nor even just have a cup of coffee in the morning. But on days that I did an intense workout, the craving for caffeine is also just as intense.

Very early today I did a 2 hour run, and double my regular sets for legs, I did some upper body as well.  
Emphasis on legs, because I couldn't walk properly 4 hours ago, I remember going down some stairs at 7am (It's 1:30pm now) and my legs were shaking, and I had to hold on to the railing.

Well as for 40 minutes ago, I couldn't feel the pain or soreness, instead my body was craving a caffeine hit so much that I walked around for 10 minutes looking for a bottle of energy drink.  
There are 2 supermarkets near me, I took a peek inside and the lines had 15+ people on them (because it's Dec 24) and I had to walk 200 meters just to go to the nearest 7/11.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

I'm looking for introverted Discord friends THAT know what Sleep Token is, Bad Omens, Swallow the Sun and the more depressing the lyrics the better.","
Make sure you're serious for looking for introverted friendship and not something to pass the time away for the holidays.

Well before we start on an updated intro, I should update this post to let people know that I'm being serious that don't join the Discord server if you don't know what Sleep Token is as that's my Discord server and that makes myself look embarrassing that I've people coming in their asking what that band is about.

If you click on my bio, your answer would've already been answered what Sleep Token is about if you would've just clicked on my social link.

Yeah, a few people had to be kicked out of the Discord server for asking these questions.

What are you talking about in this Discord server? Yeah, I've no clue what Sleep Token is and is this a band? Who are you talking about the deity Sleep?

Yeah, I'm so confused about what you're talking about.

Well yeah, didn't I say don't join the Discord server if you've no clue what Sleep Token is 😭

That's on my bio on my Reddit bio 😂

With that being said, I should update my post from a few deleted chat request I had to send the other day questioning my introvert level, that's quite funny to be honest that you want to say you're more introverted than me when most people become not introverted when birthdays and holidays hit.

However, I go out only 1-once a week and sometimes twice a week because I've to go get groceries which I believe most normal introverted people do and only go outside for grocery shopping and buying gifts.

Yeah, there isn't a soul in sight, that takes me seriously enough in person and SOME people even online claim that I'm not introverted enough. Yeah, the thing is I don't enjoy being around people in person, when a cashier ask how are you and you've to say ''I'm fine, even though you're not fine and you put on a fake face I'm happy attitude.''

If you want to know, there is a subreddit for NEETS, in which half of the users there are fake (working full time jobs, the users admitting they're working full time jobs and wanting to meet in real life to do things.) Hilarious I know 🤣

To be honest I don't think nobody reaches a stage of chronic depressed level or NEET level until you've dental issues because of lack of neglect taking care of yourself, there are some days where you don't brush your hair every few hours and even your teeth because all you want to do is just rot away in your bed.

Yeah, the thing is people don't realize that people with chronic depression don't have access to help with poor hygiene in the U.S. dental care is a luxury in the U.S. and some family members don't care to get a chronic depressed family member dental help/aid. Yeah, the truth is my bed is my couch where I watch YT, listen to music, play my Nintendo and PS4 console.

Yeah, once I receive an apartment for the waiting list that I'm on then my bedroom is basically my living room space where I spent half of my day in there every single day and where I rot away every single day.

Yeah, with that being said I was/were told that energy drinks even plant based and even tea from nature sources can erode your teeth over time.

However, you know you will hit rock bottom in life when you drink caffeine almost every day and sometimes every two days, but you can't stop drinking the coffee because you've become fully grasped in energy codeine cny to function/be caffeine high and you need the caffeine. Caffeine makes me feel at least a decent functioning human being and without caffeine not so much.

With this post coming to an end, just like the last post I posted, commenting isn't the best interest of choice and this as well.

If this post reeceives 10-50 comments, well I can't reply to every single one of you asking for me to dms you inead and I also don't reply to comments, because I can just straight up forget to post back 🤣

Which yeah, that reminds me to say on my last post here and this will be my last post for a while here, but the facts are true.

Social security income/SSI is different per-state and per-country. The rules aren't the same for every single state and country.

However, it's true of what I said in my last post. I'm too broke to see anyone and I would rather just be best friends online, occasionally maybe for birthdays and Christmas we can mail each other stuff.

Yeah, the only thing I've money for is rent, bills, things that food stamps don't cover, fast food and band merchandise 🤣 In my state, SSI doesn't allow others to pay for your plane ticket and yeah SSI at least in my state does interactions if you fly out of state. Yeah, I'm so rock bottom that I'll be living in an apartment complex that accepts government aid, SSI and food stamps.

I could really use your help choosing a special book for my girlfriend.

She just landed a new job (starts the second week of January 🙌🏽), and I want to do something meaningful to celebrate it. This year has already been a big one for us…we moved in together about 7 months ago, and I’m planning to propose next year. A lot of new and exciting things are happening in our lives — but also challenges, growth, and figuring things out together as we build our future.

I had the idea to surprise her by slipping a book into her work bag before her first day — with a handwritten message inside as a sort of love note meets encouragement card. She’s a huge fan of handwritten cards, so I thought this would be a romantic way to combine that with something she loves: books.

So here’s what I’m looking for:
A book that feels inspiring, hopeful, romantic (not required, but welcome), and grounded in growth, self-discovery, change, and stepping into new chapters. Something that says “you’ve got this” without being corny. Something she can read and feel seen, maybe even motivated. Fiction or non-fiction both welcome.

She’s Black and enjoys supporting Black authors, though it doesn’t have to be a strict requirement. She’s definitely the reader in the relationship (me? I’m still working on finishing a book I started a year ago, lol), so I’m turning to all of you for guidance.

Here’s a peek at some of the books currently on her shelf:(based on what I saw from her collection)
- People We Meet on Vacation – Emily Henry
- The Sun Is Also a Star – Nicola Yoon
- You Made a Fool of Death With Your Beauty – Akwaeke Emezi
- Heart Talk – Cleo Wade
- We Should All Be Feminists – Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie
- In Every Mirror She’s Black – Lola Akinmade Åkerström
- A few Colleen Hoover titles, poetry collections, and books with strong women leads or Black-centered stories

These are some books that were recommended to me by ChatGPT that I’m considering:
- The Authenticity Project by Clare Pooley
- Brave, Not Perfect by Reshma Saujani
- Happy Place by Emily Henry
- Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Toshikazu Kawaguchi
- The Midnight Library by Matt Haig

(If any of these are worth going for, or totally not her vibe, I’d love your insight!)

I know everyone has different tastes in books, but I’d really appreciate any thoughts…whether it’s feedback on those titles or new ones you think might be a better fit. She’s the kind of person who would totally tear up over a thoughtful note and a book that makes her feel understood, so I just want to get this right.

How many of you have seen variations of these types of reviews on booking websites such as Trip or Expedia?

Normal guests do not memorize or care the names of their check-in or service personel, obviously these reviews are all bought and paid (possibly with gifts).

We can ignore these but the sheer volume of them is truly giving inaccurate rating for tons of hotels I've booked in the past year.

Not to mention other types of obvious fake reviews. It is not hard for someone to pretend to be a guest, pay for the room, leave a good review, and the hotel pays the person under the table. I've seen a variation where whenever there is a bad review, all of a sudden there are 5 good reviews (one liner, with irrelevant picture and random things such as ""coffee was great!"") to push down the bad review. Ideally all these reviews should be deleted/removed.",0,1766554395.0,travel,4,0.38,False

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

How do you organize the extras, and (arguably, more importantly) label/reference what they're for? Is a tacklebox with post-it notes the pinnacle of manageable simplicity for this? I've seen similar questions with answers on other subs, and some people go full spreadsheet, or searchable database.

I moved to New Zealand this year and wanted to report one of my favorite parts of living here — the men are so respectful and chill!

I'm from a big American city and a constant source of stress in my life was random guys hitting on me basically everywhere. Public transit, the grocery store, coffee shops (which might be fine in the afternoon but is really annoying before work), the sidewalk…ugh.

That's just life in America for women. And so many guys get outraged if you simply can't or don't want to talk at the moment. Nothing like having a terrible day already and then a guy yells at you or insults you because you don't want his number while standing in line to buy deodorant 😅

Here in a big city in New Zealand, I've never had a guy randomly try to hit on me. I can move about freely, never worry some guy's ego will be wounded, and just live my life in peace.

The funniest part is I've never ended up dating someone because a random stranger hit on me in public. A bar or other social setting, sure, but it's so incredibly silly for men to think hitting on randos even works! I feel like I've moved to the land of common sense and it's amazing, so thank you, gents.

Also just curious as an American who's taken — what's the dating scene like here? Anything uniquely Kiwi about it? I've heard and seen some things that are definitely different from the US but would love to hear more.",181,1766553659.0,newzealand,161,0.82,False

You’ve helped make this little corner of the internet feel like a warm bed on a cold morning—whether you’re posting, commenting, voting, or just stopping by with your coffee to get your daily happy fix.



Like any comfort quilt, this sub is stitched with care, patched with puptales, and bound with love. From scrappy rescues to regal Dobies waiting patiently for Celebration morning, every post adds warmth, humor, and heart. You’ve created a space that’s gentle, joyful, and quietly kind.



Whatever you celebrate—Christmas, Hanukkah, Solstice, Kwanzaa, Yule, Diwali, Eid, Lunar New Year, or simply the sacred ritual of sleeping in with your dog—I’m wishing you peace, comfort, and blessings. May your mornings be soft, your quilts be snuggled, and your heart feel held.

1pufaig,https://www.reddit.com/r/lactoseintolerant/comments/1pufaig/heavy_cream_issues/,Heavy cream issues,"This may be an obvious answer but I’m just sick of googling things and want to read other peoples suggestions and similar stories.

I’ll keep it short and sweet. I have a sensitive stomach when it comes to dairy, but only certain types of dairy or combinations. I switched to only soy milk years ago (before oat milk was a thing) and did ok. But I’ve been drinking whole milk with my home espresso maker coffees and I do fine most days without symptoms or bare minimum.  However in the last couple days I’ve had one meal with a pasta and heavy cream white sauce, and the other day a small icecream treat both with heavy cream.., cramps maybe 30 minutes after and bathroom trips for hours after.

Being that I’m pregnant currently I can’t take really anything , but I was just wondering if anyone else has success with solving a specific dairy sensitivity issue. I read that heavy cream is supposed to have less lactose technically than say 2% or whole milk, but I’d say those are fine for me. But queso’s or certain ice creams MESS me up lol.

Do I just have IBS or dairy issue? What milk combos have best taste or reduce GI issues? I love lattes and cortados so I don’t want to cut out that.

I’d also like to add, I’ve tried the lactose free milk from Costco and that actually felt worse to me than regular milk (some cramping etc)",0,1766553351.0,lactoseintolerant,2,0.5,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

My rough budget is $40–$100 per night, and I’m looking for a quiet, private space that’s good for journaling. Doesn’t need to be anything fancy. 

Looking for Quiet hours
  - Location: anywhere in Florida, region doesn’t matter as long as it’s safe for a solo traveler
  - Type of place: budget-friendly inns/motels, small retreat centers, quiet Airbnb private room/studio, or a calm small hotel
  - Must-haves: private bathroom, 
safe neighborhood if any neighbors. 
  - Distance tolerance: within a reasonable drive from Tampa or “Lutz”. 
  - Optional but nice: nearby coffee shops for journaling, peaceful outdoor spaces

AIO for telling my coworker to stop talking in a baby voice

Hi reddit! Longtime lurker first time posting. I (22 F) have an odd coworker (22 F) and like the title says she does talk in a baby voice. When I first came to work at our company she was quiet and never talked to me and I understand I am new why would she want to talk to me but me being the person I am I wanted to try to have a relationship with my coworker because we are going to be desk to desk so I would just start out by complementing her on her clothes and got us to start talking from there. I finally had my foot in the door and now I don’t have to sit in a quiet awkward space with her.

Until one day she started speaking in a baby voice and at first I thought it was a joke but there was no joke that was made. It was just her speaking to me and I just awkwardly laugh and I just went back to what I was doing. I thought it was a one time thing maybe she was making a joke and it just didn’t land for me but I was wrong.

It was not a one time thing almost everyday now she at least speak in that baby voice once and it is starting to make me feel uncomfortable because now she will come over by me and talk to me in the baby voice and just start acting strange such as walking by my desk stopping staring at me and walking away, waiting for me when I go on my lunch and recently I was talking to another coworker and she comes over to grab a cup of coffee she turns to look at us stares and scoots over and says “Can I play?” in the baby voice laughs and walks away. My other coworker was stunned but then we both laugh awkwardly and we tried to go back to our conversation.

So reddit AIO if I tell her to stop talking in a baby voice because it is making me uncomfortable?

**Editor's note: OOP has made the same original post onto a different subreddit, I am adding the comments from that sub for more context**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** INFO: does she speak in the odd voice more often than her typical voice now?

I would definitely start by saying that you've noticed she uses a different voice sometimes and you're wondering why. Then you can ask her if she could stop using it around you.

It seems like this crafter is very socially awkward and cannot follow social cues. But some of the things you named don’t seem like odd. Waiting for you on lunch would be normal if you two were friends which she may view you as.

Just start using ""I"" statements to note the things that make you uncomfortable. Then you're being clear but not making any assumptions about her.

""It feels like you're staring at me. I am uncomfortable being watched like that.”

“I like to have my lunches alone [or to catch up with people that I don’t sit near].”

> **OOP:** Sometimes when we’re talking she gradually goes into the baby voice but also just starts talking in the voice without being prompted. You could be right about the socially awkward part because I do rarely see her talk to our other coworkers. She only talks to them regarding work.

**Commenter 2:** It sounds like the coworker has a crush on you. Considering the other coworker’s reaction to hearing her talk like that makes it seem like it’s not a common thing for her to do. I say this because I knew a girl that would do the same thing when she liked someone. Baby talk, act all giddy and bouncy, literally ask the same “can I play” question, play dumb, etc. I nicknamed her Bubbles (as in Power Puff Girls) because of how she acted around her crushes. It was super weird and it took me pointing it out to her for her to stop, but she was a friend and we were at the comfort level where we could discuss things like this. You are not at this level, and it involves your workplace, so I would make it an HR matter first. If nothing is done about it, then say something to her directly, but be tactful about it and try to make sure there is a witness (at least someone within hearing/seeing distance, not necessarily standing right next to you) when you do in case she tries to claim you said or did something that you didn’t.

> **OOP:** I don’t think it’s a crush but again I didn’t notice when my boyfriend flirted with me, but you do have a point

**Commenter 3:** Question. Is her wording very baby-like or does she have a very high-pitched voice? Have you ever heard her speak to someone else in a different voice, like a supervisor?

> **OOP:** Her voice get very high and so far I’ve noticed she talked to me in that high voice and the one time in front of our other coworker
> 
>> **Commenter 3:** If you've never heard her speak differently, has it occurred to you that that could be her real voice and she can't help but speak that way? And yes, there are people who exist that have voices like that.
>> 
>>> **OOP:** You could be right but she does speak “normally” around others but it could be her real voice she’s using with me but it did catch my coworker who had been there before I started there completely off guard

&nbsp;

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/OurR2s43t9): **December 8, 2025 (next day)**

Hi reddit. I talked to my coworker. I never thought this would’ve happened but here goes.

I grabbed my coworker aside and said I needed to talk to her. She followed me to the break room and I asked her about why she sometimes spoke in a baby voice whenever she was around me. She looked at me and began to laugh and I was caught way off guard. She was laughing so hard that she started snorting.

She eventually stopped but it felt like she was laughing forever then she walked out of the break room and came back with our other coworker and they were laughing together. At this point you are probably as confused as I am.

Turns out it was a prank because I was new to the company and they were waiting to see how long until I “broke”. I started working here in August. I beyond words and I am embarrassed because this was all just a “prank” but genuinely felt weird about this coworker and come to find out it was a prank because I was new. I smiled awkwardly and laughed because I didn’t know what else to do. All I can say is that I am embarrassed that it took this long for me to realize it was a prank.

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/kdGkQLeg4v): **December 17, 2025 (nine days later)**

**AIO UPDATE 2 For telling my coworker to stop talking in a baby voice**

Hi Reddit! I am back with an update. The reason why I took so long to respond to some comments is because I was trying to handle how I was going to approach my coworkers.

So from my last post my coworkers were pulling a prank on me by making one of my coworkers speak in a baby voice for months and act creepy.

After realizing it was a prank I did feel very embarrassed but some of the comments made me realize I have nothing to be embarrassed about because it did make me uncomfortable and how was I supposed to know it was a “prank”.

I decided to confront my coworker the one who did the baby voice (for this explanation I will be calling her Ericka a fake name). I told Ericka that the prank made feel uncomfortable because I genuinely didn’t know how to confront her about it and I didn’t want to overstep but it became very uncomfortable when she would watch me.

Ericka looked at me and laughed. She told me that I couldn’t take a joke and that I am being immature. Ericka than told me that I am nothing special that our other coworker who was in on the prank (for the sake of the explanation her name will be Bre a fake name) was also doing it another girl in a different department. Not only were they doing this to me, they were doing it to another girl and I was completely shocked.

I walked away and decided to go to HR. This was getting out of hand and it may not seem like a big deal to most people to bring it up to HR but this had been going on for months for me and I wasn’t sure how long it was going on for the other girl.

I told HR everything and surprisingly they had believed me. They had apparently been having issues with Ericka and Bre for a while with these so called “pranks” but since the other people they did “pranks” to never brought it up to HR directly. The only reason HR knew about the “pranks” was because of office gossip but since it was never formally reported there wasn’t anything they could do.

Eventually news got back to Ericka that I had reported her and Bre to HR and it was a cluster f\*\*k. Ericka started screaming at me in the middle of the office to the point other floors could hear her. Bre came up to her trying to calm her down and then Ericka told her that I reported the both of them and they both then started screaming at me. Ericka started throwing all my things off my desk and Bre started stomping on all my things.

They completely lost it and were escorted out by security and fired. I am not an exciting or overly extrovert person and I’ve never experienced this let alone heard of something of this be this crazy so sadly this was the most exciting part of my year. Take what you will but I am amazed by the fact people can be this absurd and act like this.

As of right now I am not sure what happened to them because they never return to pick up their items. I talked to the other girl they did this to and apparently she suffered way worse than I did to the point she had to go to therapy and for privacy reasons I will not go into detail and all I can say is that she feels so much better with them gone. This will be my last update.

Thank you to everyone who gave advice and thank you for making me realize that this is bullying.

Adding more context: the other coworker who was being “pranked” was not being “pranked” the same way I was. It was way much worse and that is all I will say.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

So, being the dimwit I was in 8th grade, I decided to use my brain for something I actually enjoyed.

For 2 months on my old chess.com account, I climbed the layers three-digit Elo hell, all the way from 500, to 980+, before reaching 1100+ in that order. Then after an **extremely bad** slump, dropping back 900 Elo in early August, 

I made a new account called **IntuitiveMonika** and started by pressing intermediate, automatically being dropped to wood leagu in 1400, before dropping back to a more accurate 1330, and throughout most of this entire year, I've been slumping cause of lack of sleep and school.

And on this Christmas break, being well rested after a hefty high-protein food fest from yesterday, drinking some coffee to get geeked, I finnally earned the actual rights to be 1400,

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1puf0ke,https://www.reddit.com/r/Empowish/comments/1puf0ke/feeling_undefined_the_boundary_anchor_tip_to_stop/,"Feeling Undefined? The ""Boundary Anchor"" Tip to Stop Drifting and Claim Your Space.","Hey r/Empowish,

One of the most exhausting states we can live in is feeling 'undefined.' It’s that perpetual sense of drifting, where you’re reacting to the world instead of intentionally moving through it. When our identity, our goals, or our personal boundaries are undefined, we become a blank canvas for other people’s expectations.

This leads directly to burnout, resentment, and the feeling that you’re living someone else’s life.

Here is a practical, 5-minute daily exercise—the **Boundary Anchor**—to start defining your edges and reclaiming your energy, moving you from 'undefined' to 'intentional':

### The Boundary Anchor Exercise

This isn't about setting huge, dramatic rules. It's about defining one tiny, concrete limit today.

**Step 1: The Drain Check (1 minute)**
Take a moment right now and ask yourself: *""Where did I feel most drained or resentful yesterday, or where do I anticipate giving away my power today?""*

(Examples: Over-committing to a work task, endlessly scrolling when I promised myself quiet time, or agreeing to a social obligation I dreaded.)

**Step 2: The Definition Statement (2 minutes)**
Define the *opposite* of that drain. Create one small, non-negotiable definition for the next 24 hours. This is your anchor.

*   *Instead of:* ""I’ll answer emails until 9 PM.""
*   *The Anchor:* ""My workday officially ends at 6:00 PM today, and my phone goes on Silent Mode for one hour afterward.""

*   *Instead of:* ""I’ll just agree to what my friend wants to do.""
*   *The Anchor:* ""When asked, I will clearly state my preference for the coffee shop instead of the loud bar.""

**Step 3: Communicate or Commit (2 minutes)**
This is the hardest part: **implement the definition.** If it involves others, gently communicate your boundary (e.g., ""I can’t jump on a call right now, but I can look at this tomorrow morning.""). If it’s purely internal (like the scrolling boundary), write it on a sticky note and put it where you can see it.

***

**Why this works:** Defining yourself doesn't happen in a single, massive epiphany. It happens in these tiny, consistent acts of self-respect. Every time you successfully implement a Boundary Anchor, you solidify your definition of 'self.' You teach your brain, and the world, where your edges are. Start small, stay consistent, and watch how quickly the feeling of 'drifting' begins to fade away.",1,1766552433.0,Empowish,0,1.0,False

Looking for something more than just small talk and surface-level connections, I seek depth and I seek substance. Something long term that ages like fine wine, not something short term that fizzles out like soda pop.

Consciously seeking kindred spirits. Perhaps even my forever and always. But hey, even that kind of solid connection is best founded on the grounds of *pakka* friendship, don't you think? Forever is a long time, might as-well spend it with your best friend for life.

I just want someone to call my own. To talk about anything and everything with, to chat the day away, watch movies / binge on shows with each other, explore the city and cute cafés together, A genuine connection of mind, body and soul. My person, us against the world.

I’m 29, fit body with a sharp mind and a creative soul. A lover of all things nature, food, and animals. I’ve got messy hair, a dimple on my left cheek, and eyes that see deeper than most.

Witty banter, endless memes, and conversations that go far beyond the surface. I don’t want just passion, I want emotion. I want romance. I want chemistry that sets us both on fire.

I want to be your favorite notification and your go to distraction. I want to make your heart skip a beat when you see my name pop up on your screen, make you smile from cheek to cheek and bite your lips at the same time.

For unless it's mad, passionate, extraordinary love, it's a waste of time. There are many mediocre things in life, love should not be one of them.

So how do we do this? Coffee in a cute café filled with gingerbread smells? A day spent talking till the lights come on? A Christmas movie marathon with fuzzy socks? Let’s connect. Let me get to know you.

And hey… if we find ourselves standing under the same mistletoe, I won’t blame the universe for giving us a little nudge.

* **Mindset:** You’re looking for a partner, not a pen pal. I want someone ready for a serious commitment.
* **Distance:** I’m open to LDR! Technology is great, but let’s be real, the end goal has to be meeting in person. If we’re vibing, we should be willing to figure out the ""how"" and ""when"" of meeting in real life.

1puevu3,https://i.redd.it/0pxbyuq2239g1.jpeg,I decided on the G16 I think,"So this weekend I decided to sell my aging Razer 15 2021 model and upgrade to this beast laptop G16 5070ti. My experience from this purchase…I went back and forth surfing through hours of Reddit post and YouTube videos to find out which one is suitable for my workflow. I was leaning heavily on the G14 and went to Best Buy numerous of times to look at to see if it was something I would want until I found this open box G16 for around $1800. Im still within the window of taking it back and getting the G14 because I truly love the form factor of it however, one thing I value which I haven’t heard any other post state was the ability to have two M.2s that’s what ultimately sold it for me (for now). I was willing to sacrifice screen refresh rate and cooling for it but I came to reasoning that 1TB isn’t enough and one 4TB isn’t an option for me for only drive if that makes sense. Having two drives instead instead of one bogging the OS made more sense to me than anything that’s just me tho others may have different opinions. As much as I wanted the smaller factor I also realize that this laptop wouldn’t be used for schools…dorms..extensive traveling…or coffee shop runs so having a G14 wouldn’t make sense for me…I intend to use this laptop as a true desk top replacement if I am out. Size wise…yes I can see where the G14 would be nice to have but the G16 in all reality is not a huge laptop and can easily be transported as it is super light and thin so I don’t see where the people say the G16 is too large..I could also see myself getting annoyed gaming on that small display on the G14 as I play a lot of FPS games and story based games as well all in all I know a lot of people who love there G14 and maybe one day I will get one but this go around imma stick with the G16.

Research mammals

A research group was engaged in a study of longevity in mammals and had recently focused their attention on a particular species of porpoise, which they studied from their floating laboratory off the coast of Baja Mexico. They came to believe that, if fed just the right combination of nutrients, this particular porpoise could, in theory, live forever.

To put this to the test, they studied the world's flora and fauna to see if any naturally occurring organism would fit the bill. They finally narrowed the selection down to an unusual species of mynah bird, and they sent a team of researchers off to gather a specimen.

It turns out that the mynah bird in question was quite rare, living only in a single tree in Kenya. The research team finally arrived at the tree to capture a bird, only to find that the tree was surrounded by a pride of very hungry lions, precluding any reasonable attempt to approach and climb the tree.

A suggestion was made that the lions might be manageable if they could be fed, and a couple of fat cape buffalo were captured and offered to the lions. The hungry lions devoured the hapless beasts and lay down upon the grass to digest their meal.

One of the researchers then gingerly tiptoed past the lions, climbed the tree, and had little difficulty capturing one of the mynah birds. He climbed back down the tree and walked past the lions to rejoin the group when a game warden appeared and arrested him for (what else)...

(32F) I live in East Vancouver and I am looking for folks to connect with this Friday December, 26 and/or Saturday December, 27 and reflect on how the past year has been for each of us by journalling with some prompts and then sharing what we wrote.

My hope is to connect with others who enjoy journalling, self-reflection, feeling connected with community and connecting with others with similar interests. 

These are some ideas of journal prompts I was thinking we could pick and choose from and journal/chat about: 

* What were the most memorable moments of this year, both high and low, and what made them stand out?
* What were the top challenges you faced, and how did you handle or grow from them?
* In what ways are you different now than you were at the start of the year?
* When did you feel most at peace, grounded, or connected to yourself?
* What was the most valuable lesson you learned this year, and how did it come about?
* Who were the most significant people in your life this year, and why?
* What lesson from this year do you want to carry into the next?

For format I was thinking when we meet, we each choose a prompt that we want to journal about, take about 10mins to independently write about the prompt and then come back to the group and share what we wrote. We could do this for 2-3 journal prompts.

If this is something you are interested in, send me a DM and I’ll send you the time and location of the meet-up. Hope to see you there and looking forward to connecting soon! ",10,1766551648.0,Vancouver4Friends,8,1.0,False

1pueoew,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pueoew/day_152/,Day 152,"Talking to a friend about bars. Local bars they were at earlier tonight. Ones I used to go to. I do not miss the rigamarole. The drama. The opera of it. Semi small town we live in so. That and alcoholism can get you wrapped up in a parasocial debacle of it all. I don’t know. I’m (trying) to find my way towards socializing. Drinking at these bars was a huge contingent of it for the past couple years. But I’m looking to make my way towards people outside of drinking. And I don’t mean this offensively to my friend or anyone who goes to those bars I was genuinely like “Jesus Christ I do not miss that.” People are fucking messes. It’s loud. You’re like. Mentally mixed up with the drinking. I don’t know. 


When I stopped drinking I mostly was just alone. I’d go to late night coffee shops and watch movies on my phone. Just something that wasn’t my house. Which has gotten a lot cozier since I stopped drinking but at the time it was still pretty unpleasant. 


Going to a staff holiday party in a couple weeks. There will be drinking. Feeling fine and also a little antsy about being around what I suspect will be a gathering centered partially around the free drinks. Feel it in my willpower to leave if I want but I want to go. Trying to spend more time around others. 


Feel like I’m exiting a phase of this journey and wanting to find new ground. I have some personal goals I really want to see realized without drinking. Not drinking itself was a goal and continues to be but there are some more additions that I’m taking on. Socializing. Projects. Internal mountains maybe. Feels just like a shift has been approached. 


I really don’t miss the bars at least how my friend was describing them. And I’m so happy for myself that I haven’t been for 5 months. It feels like such a gift to myself. I’ve spent so much less money. I’ve gone so much easier on my body. My mind has been able to process things.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

Everyone seems to have a different opinion on them, so I wanted to see for myself what the deal was.

A few weeks ago, I stumbled across a site selling Kratom and CBD items, including CBD flowers, Kratom capsules, and THC-infused products. I wasn’t sure what to expect, but I thought, “Why not? I’ve got nothing to lose.” I picked up a couple of things: some CBD flowers and Kratom capsules.

I started with the CBD flowers, hoping they’d help me with stress and sleep since I’ve been feeling pretty worn out lately. The first time I tried them, I didn’t feel much at all, honestly. It was kind of like I was waiting for something to happen, but nothing did. Then I tried it again the next day, and that’s when I started to feel a bit more relaxed like a gentle wave of calm washed over me. It wasn’t anything crazy, just enough to make me feel more chill. I’ll admit, it’s nice for unwinding after a long day.

Then, I tried the Kratom capsules. I had heard mixed things, but I was curious. I took a small dose at first because I didn’t want to go overboard. At first, it didn’t feel like much just a slight buzz. But about 45 minutes in, I felt this weird energy kick in. Not like coffee, but like this focused clarity that made me want to clean my room and catch up on schoolwork. It was pretty productive. But then, a couple of hours later, I felt kinda dizzy and almost nauseous. I guess I took too much for my first try. Lesson learned don’t go overboard, even if you think you can handle it!

After that, I decided to give a THC-infused body balm a try (figured I’d stay on the safe side with no actual “smoking” involved). I applied it after a workout to see if it would help with soreness. It wasn’t anything mind-blowing, but it did seem to make my muscles feel less tense. The feeling was subtle but definitely noticeable after about 30 minutes.

The weirdest part of all of this? The more I used these products, the more I realized they all hit me in totally different ways depending on my mood and what else I was doing that day. One day, I felt super energized after Kratom, while other days, it just made me feel kind of out of it. The CBD flowers were a slow, steady burn of relaxation, but the THC balm just made my skin feel nice not much of a ""high,"" but that’s probably a good thing.

I can see how these products could be great for some people looking for stress relief or even pain management, but for me, it’s all about finding that balance. Has anyone else had these kinds of mixed experiences with Kratom or CBD? I’d love to hear what’s worked for you and what hasn’t.",1,1766550964.0,story,0,1.0,False

Life these days is a humbling mix of kids who roast me daily and somehow still want pancakes the moment I sit down with yummy coffee. Weekends are cozy clothes, a golden floof who treats my socks like enemy combatants, and exactly three peaceful sips of creamy coffee before chaos resumes.

I am totally staying active enough to justify absolutely unhinged Christmas cookie behavior. That involves some running, the occasional workout, and a lot of dramatic yard sprints chasing my floof like I’m training for the Dad Olympics.

Love some tasty coffee (festive, creamy, and quietly judging black-coffee drinkers), suspiciously good at building charcuterie boards I fully snack on mid-assembly, and a fearless cook who follows vibes instead of recipes. My lifelong goal is to hear, “Dad… okay, that actually slaps,” delivered with genuine respect.

Soooo if you’ve made it all the way down here you should say hello!

I’m 5’6”, normal bmi, and drawn to men who are confident, fit, and masculine, yet kind and witty enough to keep up with my sass. Bonus if you’ve got that “I’ve-got-this” energy and a warm smile. Non-smoker only :))) pref doesn’t vape too.

* **Cold Brew:** It’s smooth, but it mostly just tastes similar to what the moka pot gives me.

1puefp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CraftSequence/comments/1puefp9/holidays_in_the_world_of_the_craft/,Holidays in the world of the Craft,"I'm no scholar like u/TheHiddenSchools is, but given the season, I have to wonder what holidays they celebrate.

I ***know*** they don't have Christmas, Halloween or Easter, but I'll bet they have events around the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.

Then there are the significant dates of the various gods. But when are they? What's a significant day for Kos? Something to do with fire and I don't know enough astrology to offer any options other than that there are fire signs.

One likely day for Seril would be the start of the Lunar New Year. I doubt there would be dragon dances, or fireworks, but I could see people in gargoyle costumes, poetry recitals. What else would there be? Lunar eclipses might have some significance. But are they when Seril metes out justice for those she can't normally reach? Or turns a blind eye to minor mischief?

Then there's Dresediel Lex. A once holy city now ruled entirely by the Craft. Their gods are dead, at best ghosts and shadows. But I don't doubt their holidays live on. There's Muerte Coffee, so I'll bet there's something like Dia de Los Muertos - where the people of Dresediel Lex honor their dead, clean the graves, remember them and sacrifice to them. 

I'll also bet there's the Red King's birthday and death day (ascension day for his lichedom?). And his victory over the Gods (of course).

And there's the Solar eclipse in **Two Serpents Rise**.

My thoughts were jumbled, but I could still listen.



“He was my servant,” Marcus continued, his voice soft, almost drowned out by the desert silence. “Everyone called him that. The law called him that. Society defined him that way. But to me, he was so much more than that; he was my childhood playmate, and…”



He grabbed a handful of sand, letting it slip through his fingers. “I never dreamed of marrying and having children. I never imagined having a wife, children, living the life my family expected. But I did dream of spending my life with Jacob. Growing old together, I wanted to buy an estate, and just the two of us, and endless hunting—my health would be poor then, and hunting would be my happiest time.”



The sand slipped through his fingers, and he watched it fall, a deep sadness filling his face.



“When they told me I was going to meet a woman I’d never met, and that my duty was to have children with her and continue the family bloodline, I couldn’t bear it. Not because of the woman—as far as I know, she’s a nice person. It was because they said Jacob couldn’t come with me. And I couldn’t continue my beloved medical career.”



“What happened after that?” I asked, though deep down I had a premonition.



“My illness got worse, coupled with my unwillingness, led them to call off the engagement.” His tone was calm, but I could hear the weight in it. “In my final moments, in that year when I teetered between life and death, I told myself I couldn’t die like that. I became obsessed with mysticism, I tried everything, summoning all the gods, because… I’m the youngest son of a noble family, I have the money to do it, my family just thinks I’m dying.”



He looked at me, his eyes aged, incredibly aged. “Ultimately, I chose this path. Seven hundred and forty-three years, traveling to remote places, watching the world change, yet I remained steadfast.”



“Do you regret it?”



His smile was sincere and painful. “Not at all. We spent another ten years together. I told my parents I'd found a very busy job in London, and then he got the plague, so I… I thought then, if the plague and famine were alike, I'd already tried everything, even to the point of ignoring Jacob. I could only seek out plague, because maybe I could have a chance.”



Halfway through the story, Levi, in his animal form, quietly approached. He rested his head on Marcus's lap, offering silent comfort in an animalistic way.



Marcus placed his hand on Levi's head, his fingers gently twirling his fur. “I made another deal, but this time it wasn't so lucky. He became some kind of being between life and death, and he doesn't remember me anymore. I had to trade a part of my feelings for some peace of mind.”



“That must have been hard,” I said.



Afterwards, the three of us sat quietly in the vast desert with Biscuit, the ancient skeleton casting long shadows on the sand.



That night, I dreamt of young Marcus, healthy and full of energy, standing in a stone house draped with tapestries. Jacob stood beside him, smiling, his face radiant. They stood close, yet didn't touch, but the space between them held all the unspoken emotions they couldn't express.



\-----

The second week was worse.



The heat seemed to come alive, enveloping us like a second skin. It now had weight, pressing down on my shoulders, making each breath incredibly difficult. The air was so hot that inhaling hurt; each gasp felt like burning my lungs.



The texture of the sand had changed, no longer like sand, but more like powder, fine as flour, light as ash. With each step the horses took, sand billowed into clouds, casting a pale film over everything. My skin was covered in sand, and my clothes stiffened. Sand seeped into my mouth, nose, and eyes, rough and inescapable.



We now saw more ""structure."" Less like buildings, more like the memories of buildings. Geometric shadows were cast on the sand, outlining the contours of walls and porches, but they had no substance. We rode across the dunes, unimpeded. I felt their emptiness, the places where people had once lived, loved, suffered, and died, now utterly deserted.



On the ninth day, we discovered the skull of our first truly gigantic creature.



We'd seen bones for days, but this one was different. The skull was the size of a house, perhaps even larger, half-buried in a dune hundreds of feet high. It was remarkably well-preserved, snow-white, with eye sockets large enough to fit a car. The teeth, the remaining fragments, were as long as me, worn smooth by centuries of erosion.



“What is that?” I asked hoarsely, my voice barely audible.



“It’s something that existed before the concept of ‘size’ existed,” Marcus said. “Before physics mandated uniformity. Things could be enlarged or shrunk as needed, and it didn’t matter.”



During the day, more and more bones appeared. Ribs, like the framework of a cathedral, arched overhead as we rode beneath them. Vertebrae, the size of buses, lay scattered across the sand like giants throwing dice. A spine stretching for miles, partially buried in the sand, formed a ridge we had to detour around, for traversing it would take hours.



The scale was unbelievable. My brain kept trying to comprehend what I was seeing, trying to imagine these bones belonged to real creatures, but this attempt undermined my ability to grasp size and space.



On the tenth day, Levi stopped moving.



We had camped the night before, and dawn broke. Or rather, barely dawn in the white sky. He was just curled up, lying there, his body rapidly shifting shape. Dog, fox, wolf, human child, and back to dog—the transformations happened so quickly I couldn't even see them clearly.



""Levi?"" I crawled to his side, my body barely able to move. “Hey, buddy, we have to keep going.”



He whimpered, his voice high-pitched and desperate, but his eyes remained closed.



“He’s reached his limit,” Marcus said softly. “Hunger is eroding his ability to maintain his form. Shapeshifters need more energy than humans to maintain their form, and he’s been running out of energy for days.”



“What do we do?”



“Pick him up.” Marcus had already gone to Levi’s horse, adjusting the saddlebag to make room. “Put him with Biscuits. They’ll comfort each other.”



I carefully picked up Levi; he was so light, as if hunger had consumed him entirely, and placed him in the saddlebag with Biscuits. The dog immediately curled up beside him, offering warmth and companionship.



Levi’s eyes opened briefly, his gaze hazy and unfocused. “Dad?”



“I’m here. Rest. We’ll get there.”



“Really?”



“Really.”



He closed his eyes, his breathing gradually calming. He seemed to enter a state of hibernation, his body shutting down non-essential functions to conserve its dwindling energy.



We continued on.



On the eleventh day, the scenery changed. We descended into a valley. But ""valley"" wasn't entirely accurate. It was more like a depression, a vast, bowl-shaped area in the desert, perhaps once a lakebed millions of years ago, perhaps never having held water. The sand here was a darker color, almost black, its surface covered with endless spirals and swirling patterns.



""Look closely,"" Marcus's voice was tense. ""Tell me what you see.""



I looked. At first, all I saw was patterned black sand. Then my eyes adjusted to the light, and I saw them.



Scales.



Those patterns weren't formed by wind erosion. They were scales. Huge scales, each as large as a house, overlapping in perfect geometry. The entire valley floor was covered in them, a vast, boundless reptilian armor stretching to every horizon.



We were walking on something enormous.



Something buried but not dead.



Something breathing with a rhythm measured in decades.



“Don’t think about it,” Marcus advised, his own voice hoarse. “Don’t try to comprehend the scale. You’ll break down. Just ride. Just stare at that cave.”



“A cave?”



He pointed ahead. In the center of the valley, about ten miles away, there was a jutting rock, the only vertical feature in the entire depression. At the base of the rock, barely visible even from this distance, was a dark opening.



“There,” he said. “That’s where we’re going. That’s where rebirth is.”



On the twelfth day, we descended into the valley, and the temperature plummeted. Not coolness, the coolness long gone, but another kind of heatwave. This heatwave came from below, radiating upwards through the scales, as if the creature beneath our feet had a fever, as if its massive body was battling some eternal infection.



The scales trembled slightly as we passed.



Not noticeably, not quickly. But I could feel it. A subtle movement beneath the horse's hooves, a flexion and descent, as if the creature below were adapting to our weight. This swaying stirred ripples in the valley floor, the pattern of disturbance spreading outwards from below. Our path.



My horse did not waver. He moved steadily forward, his black hooves carrying an unusual certainty, firmly planted on the scales. But I could feel his tension, the growing vigilance in his muscles. He knew what ground we were on. He knew danger.



We did not camp that night. Marcus insisted we continue, saying it was dangerous to stop on the scales, but he did not explain why. So we rode in the dark, though under the white sky, day and night were almost indistinguishable, the scales shifting beneath our feet, waves of heat rising, hunger devouring everything.



I was sometimes lucid, sometimes delirious, my body moving mechanically, my hands gripping the reins tightly by muscle memory alone. Sometimes I could feel the surrounding desert. Sometimes I felt as if I were elsewhere, a darker, colder, equally empty place.



On the morning of the thirteenth day, I looked down and found I could see through my hands.



Not quite. Not like ghosts. But they were translucent, slightly translucent, as if I were fading away. As if hunger had devoured not only my energy, but also my essence, my body.



“Marcus,” I said. “My hands.”



He glanced back, his expression turning serious. “You’re nearing the breaking point. That’s actually a good thing; it means you’re ready. It means the transition will be easier when the famine consumes you.”



“Easier? How so?”



“You’ve partially dissolved. You’re somewhere in between. The feeling of being devoured won’t be like destruction, but more like completion.”



I didn’t know if his words were comforting or terrifying.



On the fourteenth day, we reached the cave.



A rock jutted out like a tumor from the scales, a massive rock out of place with the surrounding geological formations. It was dark, almost black, with shimmering textures interspersed within, like obsidian or glass. The entrance to the cave was small, barely large enough for me to walk upright, perfectly circular, so perfect it seemed unnatural.



Marcus dismounted first, his movements still steady despite two weeks in the desert. He helped me down; I nearly collapsed. My legs felt like they'd forgotten how to support my weight. Hunger consumed me completely, an emptiness that swallowed all other senses.



He took Levi and biscuits from the saddlebag. Levi was still unconscious, his form somewhere between human and animal, his breathing shallow and steady. Bisket stirred, licked Levi's face, then looked at me with eyes full of patience and understanding.



""Can you walk?"" Marcus asked.



I nodded, though I wasn't sure if I really could.



""Let's begin then.""



We entered the cave.



The cave was smaller than I'd imagined, almost a room. The walls were smooth stone, worn smooth by hands, time, or something else, giving them a dull luster. In the center of the floor, a scale lay embedded in the rock like a fossil.



It was about the size of my palm, shimmering with iridescence, capturing non-existent light and reflecting it into unnameable colors. Green, yet not quite green; blue, yet almost purple; red, yet shifting to gold. Like the satchel, it pulsated with the same rhythm—a heartbeat, a breath, the most fundamental pulse of life.



Marcus carefully placed Levi and the biscuits against the wall; they huddled together, the warmth of the biscuits supporting Levi's swaying body. Then he turned to me.



“This is it,” he said softly, “the place of rebirth. Here, famine devours itself, then is reborn. Here, the cycle repeats.” He looked at me, his expression grave. “Are you ready?”



I pondered this question. Was I ready to be swallowed by one of the four anchors of reality? Ready to linger for three minutes in the existential hunger of my stomach? Ready to face whatever lay ahead?



“No,” I said honestly. “But I’ll still do it.”



“This is all anyone can ask for.” He stepped back, giving me space. “Open the bag. Put it on the scale. Then step back and let things take their course.”



My hands trembled, or perhaps not, or perhaps I couldn’t tell anymore. I opened the bag with fingers that felt like someone else’s.



Famine appeared.



It didn’t appear in the form of any creature. It didn’t appear as anything with a definite form. It was more like a lack shaped into intention. A void that had learned to move. A darkness beyond darkness, which devoured light not by absorbing it, but by destroying it, making the light believe it had never existed.



It flowed from the bag like liquid shadow, like oil solidified in nothingness. With its appearance, the cave filled with that emptiness, that hollow pain, that endless, insatiable longing. The hunger I had felt for the past two weeks paled in comparison. This was the source of hunger, its origin, its pure and undiluted essence.



That thing gradually took shape. I realized it was a snake, or something like a snake. Long and sinuous, it moved with a terrifying grace. Its scales, if they were truly scales, were a deeper black than black itself.



An ouroboros.



Its head was buried in its tail, devouring its own matter in an eternal cycle of destruction and rebirth. Devouring, and being devoured. End and beginning, start and end.



I placed the bag on the scale embedded in the floor.



Famine hovered on the scale, hovering around itself, forming a perfect circle. From head to tail, from beginning to end, and from end to beginning. It pulsed the same rhythm I had felt for the past two weeks, and now I understood—it wasn't a heartbeat. It was the pulse of the universe itself, the fundamental rhythm of existence, the beat to which all things dance, whether aware or not.



Then, it stopped devouring itself.



And turned to me.



I had expected fear. I had expected to run, to fight back, to resist with every last ounce of strength I had. But what I felt was recognition. Famine knew me. It had always known me. It had been waiting for me, waiting for this moment.



This was all destined to happen. This moment was etched into my blood, into my DNA, into the very root of my existence.Structure. I was born to stand in this cave, to offer myself to hunger in this moment.



It opened its mouth, and that mouth was also its tail, and the tail was itself; before such essential existence, all boundaries are meaningless.



I glanced back.



“Three more minutes,” Marcus called, his voice tinged with tension, perhaps fear, perhaps awe, perhaps both. “We’ll be here when you return.”



If I could return, I thought.



But I didn’t say it aloud. Instead, I took a step forward, and hunger devoured me.



Hunger vanished.



This was the first thing I noticed; it was so sudden, so complete, that it took my brain several seconds to process the emptiness. That gnawing emptiness, that nothingness that had occupied my consciousness for fourteen days, simply vanished. Not because it was filled, but because I became hunger itself, and hunger feels no lack.



I found myself in a vast, tranquil, utterly peaceful place.



This space was indescribable. It wasn't dark, yet there was no light. It wasn't empty, yet there was no scene in the traditional sense. It wasn't silent, yet there was no sound I understood. It was the gap between heartbeats, the pause between breaths, the perfect stillness before action begins.



From here, I can see everything.



Everyone who has ever longed for something. Every empty stomach. Every lonely heart. Every searching soul. They are all here, connected, all part of this vast network of desire, a network like invisible threads that bind the universe together.



The children in the refugee camp, bloated from malnutrition, dream of rice.



The widow in the suburban house longs to hear her husband's voice, longs to talk to him again.



The young people in the city apartment yearn for meaning, yearn for purpose, yearn to find something that makes the long days worthwhile.



The woman in the hospital bed longs for more time, even just a little more time with her family.



The artist gazes at the blank canvas, thirsting for inspiration, yearning to find that scene that can make everything meaningful.



The prisoners, held in solitary confinement, craved human connection so intensely that it became physical torment.



They were all here. Everything. All the hunger, desire, and desperate need that had existed or would exist. This network stretched backward, across time, forward, towards infinite possibilities, connecting all lives, sharing the experience of emptiness.



I finally understood the nature of famine.



It was not destruction. It was not cruelty. It was not punishment.



It was space for growth. It was an emptiness that allowed filling. It was a void that gave form to abundance.



I saw my father, young and desperate, standing at the warehouse door. He longed to escape his inner demons. He longed to find a way out. I understood; his hunger shaped me, created the space in which I existed. His emptiness gave me form.



I saw everyone I had ever delivered to—all those difficult, struggling customers—and I understood what they all longed for. Connection. Recognition. Acknowledging their existence, acknowledging their importance, acknowledging the meaning of their existence in the universe.



The things in the thirteenth-floor hospital yearn to reclaim the essence of their lost reality.



The castle-like creature in the well yearns to regain its former memories.



The subway passengers yearn to reach a destination they can never reach.



The old man telling stories yearns to find someone willing to listen to his warnings.



The gardener, situated between two places, yearns to comfort those lingering on the border.



We are all thirsty. We all forever yearn, all try to fill the void that can never be filled, for it is this emptiness that gives us life, gives us meaning, and elevates us beyond the static objects of a static universe.



Time flows here in a peculiar way. I can feel the second hand ticking away, one second, two seconds, three seconds, but each second contains infinity. In the first second, I experienced a thousand lives, felt every kind of thirst, every desperate longing, every hand reaching for the unattainable.



In the second second, I understood what Marcus had given me: Choice.



To stay is to dedicate oneself forever, becoming part of the machine that feeds the thirsty, maintaining boundaries, letting each world operate on its predetermined path. Or to leave is to return to a mundane life, memories bound, words imprisoned, carrying knowledge yet unable to share, unable to apply, unable to use it to shape anything beyond my own understanding.



Both choices are empty in their own way. They both create their own hunger.



To stay means eternal dedication, watching my loved ones age and pass away, while I remain unchanged, experiencing the slow fading of the connection brought by immortality. To live forever with a longing, watching the lives of others unfold in cycles, while I remain detached, serving them, providing them with convenience, yet never truly participating.



To leave means silence, yearning to know the truth yet unable to speak of it, unable to share it, unable to let it enlighten the world. To live with a full understanding and a lonely emptiness, carrying knowledge like a boulder in my heart, never to be lightened, for I can never put it down.



In the third second, I made my choice. It wasn't because I wanted to do it. It wasn't because I was ready. It wasn't because one choice was better, more correct, or more aligned with my true desires. It was because one desire touched me more clearly than another. An emptiness brought me more peace.



I chose the desire for immortality over the desire for silence. I chose eternal devotion over isolated cognition. I chose to remain, to be like Marcus, guarding the boundary between existence and non-existence, however long eternity may be.



Because levi needs stability. Because the biscuit is immortal anyway, and deserves a master who doesn't age. Because the universe needs food to feed its hungry beings.



Because I realized I was good at this. I followed the rules. I returned alive. I now understand that these are not merely survival skills—they are dedication. They are service. They are the willingness to enter nothingness and return again and again, bringing nourishment to those beings who cannot be self-sufficient.



Perhaps that is enough. Perhaps that is the mission. Perhaps that is how to fill the emptiness, not by erasing it, but by accepting it, living in it, and letting it function.



Famine liberated me.



I knelt in the cave, panting, my body rediscovering how to be an entity, how to separate, how to be an independent individual. The transformation back to a single existence was so dramatic, like rebirth, as if every atom of my being had to remember how to coalesce into a single point of consciousness.



The scales on the ground were gone. In their place stood new scales, brand new and gleaming with colors never before seen. They were ready for another sixty years of waiting, waiting for patience, waiting for the slow accumulation of time, until the next rebirth.



The ouroboros devoured itself and was reborn, and I was the catalyst, the transmission mechanism, the messenger that brought hunger to its own rebirth.



Marcus stood above me, extending his hand. His face was taut, with an emotion I couldn't describe. ""Welcome back,"" he said softly. ""Exactly three minutes and fourteen seconds. Congratulations, Eric, you've completed the final delivery.""



I took his hand, stood up, my legs almost forgetting how to support my weight. The hunger was gone, truly gone, no longer concealed or hidden. I felt a completely different kind of emptiness, clean and vast, like an empty bell, poised to receive whatever was to come.



levi shifted against the wall, slowly opening his eyes. When he saw me standing, alive, unharmed, he relaxed completely. His tail, now fully exposed, no longer shimmering, began to wag.



“You’re back,” he whispered, his voice hoarse, but still human. “I knew you would come back, but I was afraid you wouldn’t, but you really are back.”



Biscuit stood up, walked to my side, and pressed his warm, strong body against my legs, patient, loyal, and genuine.



I looked at Marcus. “So, what now?”



“Now, we formally present this proposal.” He took a step back, his posture formal but friendly. His expression was complex—relief, sadness, understanding, a mixture of emotions. “Eric, your contract has been fulfilled. You’ve served for three years, completed one final delivery. Now you have a choice: either pay off your debts and leave with fond memories, or accept the promotion, become a manager, and stay with us forever.”



“What if I accept the promotion?”



“You’ll become like me. Time flows differently for us, and aging hardly slows down. You’ll manage other couriers, mentor them through three years of service, and assign them tasks when they’re selected for final deliveries. You’ll witness the world change, while you remain the same. And you can never leave. Never retire. Never rest in the usual way. This service will become your existence, your purpose, your eternal present.”



“My choice is deep inside,” I said. “Just three seconds ago. I will stay.”



Marcus’s eyebrows rose slightly. “Are you sure? Do you understand what this means? Forever is a long time, Eric.”



“I understand. Someone has to do this job.”



Marcus was silent for a long time, his old eyes fixed on my face. Then he smiled, not the wide grin I was used to, but a gentler, more melancholic smile. “Choosing Eternity, the reasons are heavy.”



“The reasons for all great choices are heavy. That’s why they deserve our deepest consideration.”



“Well then, congratulations, Eric Appleby.” He pulled a business card from his pocket—I didn’t know where it came from, given we’d been in the desert for two weeks with extremely limited supplies—and handed it to me. “You’re a manager now. Welcome to Eternity.”



The handwriting on the card was exactly the same as his, elegant script on thick paper: Eric Appleby, Manager, Full-time Employee.



“Next week you’ll start training new delivery drivers,” he continued, “train them, mentor them, try to keep them alive, though many may not make it through the first month. Remember, you can no longer talk about this publicly online. No more online confessions. Work matters stay at work. Boundaries require you to act prudently.”



We rode across the desert, through the melting world, through suburbs and commercial streets, finally back to the city. The return journey seemed shorter; perhaps for me, time had become something I could freely control. The hunger gradually subsided until I could eat bread again, truly savor its taste, drink water, and feel refreshed.



The pocket watch on the coffee table displayed a new photograph: I stood in an office exactly like Marcus's, dressed in clothes that seemed too formal, too important. Behind me, reflected in the window, I could see that tall figure that had appeared in countless photographs.



But this time, I recognized him.



That was me. The me I was going to become. The manager. The eternal servant. The guardian of the borders.



I was about to start working.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

It was handwritten in blue ballpoint pen on the back of a tax receipt pinned to the bulletin board of a 24-hour laundromat in downtown São Paulo.

""NIGHT WATCHMAN - PRIVATE SECTOR. $18,000.00/month + Bonuses. Requirements: No family, military or security background, strong stomach. Discreet. Contact the number below via Telegram only.""

Eighteen thousand dollars.

I read the number three times. At the time, I was living in a boarding house room that smelled of mold and old cooking oil. My bank account had been in the red for so long the manager didn’t even call me anymore. I’m an ex-military police officer, expelled from the force for ""excessive use of force"" and ""incompatible conduct"" (official code for alcoholism).

I had nothing to lose. I sent the message.

The reply came in thirty seconds. A GPS coordinate and a time: 03:00 AM.

The location was the underground garage of an abandoned commercial building in the Sé district. I was frisked by two men built like wardrobes wearing cheap suits. They took my phone, my wallet, my watch. They put a black hood over my head and shoved me into the back of a van.

They drove for four hours. From the swaying and the smell of earth coming through the vents, we left the city and hit a dirt road. Then, we went down. We went down a lot. I felt the pressure in my ears change, like when a plane lands.

When the hood was removed, I was in a white, sterile room lit by fluorescent bulbs.

Sitting at a metal table was Dr. Arantes. A thin man with gray skin and dark circles under his eyes so deep they looked like bruises. He didn’t smile. He didn’t greet me. He just pushed a stack of papers toward me.

“Level 5 Non-Disclosure Agreement,” he said, his voice dry as sand. “If you tell anyone what you see here, you don’t go to jail. You disappear. Your dental records vanish. Your birth certificate is erased. You never existed. Understood?”

“What is the job?” I asked, holding the pen. “Politician security? Organ trafficking?”

“Theological Containment Monitoring.”

I laughed. I thought it was a joke.

Arantes didn’t laugh.

“The salary is deposited into an offshore account in the Cayman Islands. You work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. You sleep here. You eat here. Your life outside is over. Sign or leave.”

I signed. My hand shook a little, not from fear, but from alcohol withdrawal.

Arantes gathered the papers and stood up.

“Welcome to Project Cathedral. Let’s go down.”

We entered an industrial freight elevator. The panel had no numbers, just an up button and a down button. We descended for too long. Two minutes? Three?

“We are three hundred meters below the foundation of an 18th-century church,” Arantes explained, staring at the elevator ceiling. “The church above is a façade. What matters is what’s below.”

When the doors opened, the air was freezing. We walked down a concrete corridor lined with steel doors fitted with biometric locks. We reached the end of the hall. A control room.

It was small, claustrophobic, filled with high-resolution monitors, panels with blinking lights, and an industrial coffee maker. But the focus of the room was the window. A pane of reinforced glass, ten centimeters thick, looking into a gray concrete cell.

“That is your post,” Arantes pointed to the worn leather chair in front of the glass. “Sit.”

I obeyed. I looked through the glass.

The cell was a perfect concrete cube, maybe 4x4 meters. No furniture. No bed. No toilet. In the center, on a Persian rug that must have once been red but was now dark brown, a man was kneeling.

He was facing away from me. He wore a black cassock, torn and dirty. His hair was white, thin, falling over his gaunt shoulders. He was rocking his body slightly, back and forth.

“Who is he?” I asked.

“We call him Father Thomas. He is 94 years old. He has been in that room for forty-two years.”

“A prisoner?”

“Working. Just like you.”

Arantes flipped a switch on the panel. Sound invaded the control room.

It wasn’t silence. It was a low, constant hum, like a swarm of bees inside a cave.

“...Khlerrr-thum-nagh... Sssrr-aaa-tuh... Mmm-glll-w'nah...”

“Is he praying?” I asked, feeling a chill run up my spine. That language didn’t sound human. The consonants were too hard, too guttural.

“He is vocalizing,” Arantes corrected. “It’s a sonic blockade. A specific frequency. As long as he maintains this rhythm, the Door stays closed.”

“What door?”

Arantes ignored the question and pointed to the panel in front of me. There were three large buttons, protected by acrylic covers. Blue, Yellow, and Red.

“Pay attention, Jonas. These are your only responsibilities. The priest does not eat, does not drink water by mouth, does not sleep. He receives nutrition and stimulants intravenously. He wears high-absorption geriatric diapers that we change with robots every 24 hours. Your function is to ensure he does not stop. Ever.”

Arantes pointed to the Blue Button.

“Hydration and mild stimulant. If his voice falters, if he coughs, press Blue.”

Then he pointed to the Yellow Button.

“Shock of adrenaline and pure amphetamine. If he stops rocking. If his head droops. If it looks like he’s going to pass out. Press Yellow. It will hurt him a little. His heart will race to 200 beats per minute. But it will keep him awake.”

“And the Red one?” I asked. The button was larger than the others, with a black and yellow striped warning border.

Arantes looked at the cell. For the first time, I saw fear in that man’s eyes.

“If he dies. If the sound stops for more than ten seconds. If you see... things coming out of the floor. Press Red.”

“What does it do?”

“Total incineration. The cell is flooded with flammable corrosives. Everything inside turns to ash in three seconds.”

“So, that button basically kills him?”

“If we reach that point, Jonas, the priest doesn’t matter anymore. The Red is to seal the room. To ensure nothing comes out.”

Arantes put a hand on my shoulder.

“The shift is 12 hours. Do not sleep. The system monitors your eyes. If you close them for more than five seconds, the chair shocks you. Good luck.”

The first few months were a slow descent into madness. Boredom is the worst kind of torture. You sit there, staring at a dying old man, listening to that sound.

“...Khlerrr-thum-nagh...”

It isn’t a Christian prayer. I was raised in the church. I know Latin. That was older than Latin. It sounded like the language stones would speak if they had mouths.

I started studying Father Thomas. With the camera zoom, I saw details the glass hid. The skin on his knees didn’t exist anymore. The fabric of the cassock, the flesh, and the rug had fused into a mash of dried blood and pus. He was calcified to the floor. That old man couldn’t stand up even if he wanted to.

His hands, clasped in prayer, had nails grown long and curved, piercing the flesh of his own palms.

But the worst was the face. Every now and then, he would turn his head to the side in a spasm. He had no eyes. The sockets were empty, scarred holes. Someone—or he himself—had gouged them out years ago. And the mouth... the lips were open sores from so much friction.

In the fourth week, I found a ""Journal"" on the control room computer. It was a text file hidden in a system folder. Previous monitors left notes.

Monitor Silva (2015): ""He spoke to me today. Not the prayer. He whispered my name. The audio was off, but I read his lips. How does he know my name?""

Monitor Kowalski (2019): ""The shadows in the cell are wrong. The light comes from above, but the priest’s shadow points to the left. And sometimes, the shadow moves when he is still.""

Monitor Helena (2023): ""I dreamed of what is below. It is an ocean. But not of water. Of teeth. Thomas isn’t praying to God. He is singing to put the baby to sleep.""

Helena lasted three months. The log said ""Termination for medical reasons (psychotic break).""

I started doubting my own sanity. The sound of the prayer entered my dreams. I would wake up in my quarters (a concrete room on the same floor) whispering just like the priest. My throat hurt, as if I had been screaming all night.

In the sixth month, the routine was broken.

It was 02:00 AM. I was fighting sleep, drinking cold coffee.

Father Thomas stopped.

The silence in the room was like a gunshot. The audio monitor showed the flatline of silence. I jumped in my chair, hand hovering over the Blue Button.

But before I could press it, he spoke. In Portuguese. With a clear, young voice that shouldn’t have come out of that destroyed throat.

“Jonas.”

I froze. He was facing away, but I knew he was ""looking"" at me with those empty sockets.

“Press the Yellow, Jonas,” the voice said. “I need strength. He is waking up.”

I didn’t think. I pressed the Yellow Button.

I heard the hiss of the automatic injector in the cell. The priest’s body convulsed violently. His back arched at an impossible angle. I heard bones crack. He screamed—a dry, airless scream—and went back to praying.

But now, the rhythm was frantic. Too fast.

“KhlerrrthumnaghSsrrraaatuuhhMmmglllwnah...”

He sounded like a demonic rapper. The frequency rose. The reinforced glass in front of me began to vibrate.

The red phone on my desk rang. I didn’t even know that phone worked. I answered.

“What did you do?” It was Arantes’ voice. He sounded like he was just waking up.

“He asked for it! He stopped! I followed protocol!”

“The seismic activity level just spiked! You injected too much adrenaline! His heart won’t take it!”

I looked at the vital signs monitor. Heart rate: 210 bpm. Blood pressure: 240/150. The priest was going to explode.

“He is rising!” the priest shouted, breaking the prayer again.

This time, he turned. He rotated his torso 180 degrees. His spine snapped, breaking, but he turned. The eyeless face stared at me. He smiled. Black blood ran from his mouth.

“The door, Jonas. The door is creaking.”

And then, the floor of the cell gave way. It wasn’t a hole. The concrete simply became... liquid. The rug where the priest was kneeling sank. I saw Father Thomas’s body being swallowed by the earth. He didn’t scream. He kept praying as he sank into the gray slime bubbling on the floor.

The prayer became muffled, gurgling, until it vanished completely.

The heart monitor beeped. Flatline.

The sound stopped.

“Arantes!” I screamed into the phone. “He’s gone! The floor swallowed him!”

“The Red!” Arantes shouted. “PRESS THE DAMN RED BUTTON NOW!”

I lifted the acrylic cover. I punched the button. I closed my eyes, waiting for the flash of flammable chemicals, the heat, the explosion that would incinerate everything on the other side of the glass.

But... nothing happened.

The button didn’t work.

I opened my eyes. The cell wasn’t on fire. The cell was glowing.

A sickly violet light emanated from the hole in the floor where the priest had sunk. The temperature in my control room began to rise. 30 degrees. 40 degrees. The plastic on the monitors started to melt. The phone in my hand melted, burning my palm. I dropped it.

And then, the Thing began to emerge.

First, it was the fingers. Long, translucent claws, made of something that looked like smoking glass and TV static. They gripped the edge of the hole in the concrete. The size... my God. Each finger was the size of a grown human.

Then, the head. It had no face. A polygon of flesh and light that constantly changed shape. Looking at it made my eyes bleed. I felt hot, red tears running down my face.

The central computer in the room came to life. A text message appeared on the main screen, giant green letters on a black background.

CONTAINMENT SYSTEM FAILED.

OMEGA PROTOCOL INITIATED.

MANDATORY REPLACEMENT.

The doors to my control room locked. Titanium bars slammed down over the exit. A mechanical needle descended from the ceiling, right above my chair. I tried to get up, but the chair had magnetic locks on the wrists and ankles. They snapped shut with a metallic click.

I was trapped.

“No! No! Let me out!” I screamed.

The needle descended and pierced my neck. I felt a cold liquid invade my veins. It wasn’t poison.

It was clarity.

Suddenly, the fear vanished. The pain vanished. My mind expanded.

I understood.

I understood what Father Thomas was doing. He wasn’t praying to a God. He wasn’t asking for salvation. He was telling a story.

The Entity... Whatever that thing coming out of the hole was... is made of chaos. It is pure entropy. It wants to undo the universe, atom by atom. The only thing keeping it trapped is Order. And the purest form of Order is Repetition. Rhythm. The Word.

The ""prayer"" wasn’t magic. It was mathematics. A sequence of frequencies creating a physical barrier against chaos. A wall of solid sound.

But Thomas had stopped. The wall had fallen. Someone needed to raise the wall again.

The Thing in the cell was rising. It already occupied half the space. The concrete walls were cracking, turning to dust. If it touched the ceiling, if it touched the foundation of the church above... the world would end. Not in fire, but in silence. Everything would cease to exist.

I felt the words rising in my throat. I didn’t know them. But they were in the serum the needle injected. Liquid memory. The knowledge of all the monitors, of all the ""priests"" before Thomas.

My mouth opened against my will. My tongue twisted into a painful knot. The sound came out ragged, weak.

The Thing in the cell stopped. The spinning geometry hesitated. It ""looked"" at me through the glass.

I felt a crushing pressure on my brain, like an ocean trying to fit into a water glass.

“SHUT UP, WORM,” the Thing’s voice echoed in my mind. It was pure murderous intent.

But I couldn’t shut up. The drug in my blood wouldn’t let me. The biological imperative was now: Pray or die.

“Khlerrr-thum-nagh...” I spoke louder.

The Thing recoiled an inch. The black slime on the floor bubbled. It hated the sound. The sound was Order. The sound was a cage.

The Thing let out a screech that blew out the remaining monitors in the room. Glass flew everywhere, cutting my face. But I didn’t stop.

The rhythm took me.

My body began to rock, back and forth, mimicking Thomas’s movement. It was the only way to pump the diaphragm to keep my breath.

The Thing began to shrink. The violet light dimmed. It was being pushed back into the hole by the weight of my words. It fought. Claws scratched the reinforced glass, leaving deep gouges right in front of my face.

But I kept going.

It sank. Slowly, inch by inch, the nightmare returned to the earth. The concrete floor, which had been liquid, began to solidify again, sealing the hole.

In ten minutes, the cell was empty. Only the dirty rug and Thomas’s bloodstains remained.

I sat there, panting, trapped in the chair. I waited for the doors to open. I waited for Arantes to come get me out, congratulate me, give me my money.

But the doors didn’t open.

The needle in my neck injected another dose. Nutrients. Water. Stimulants.

The intercom clicked on.

“Excellent work, Jonas,” Arantes voice said. “The transition was smoother than we expected. Thomas took three days to find the rhythm the first time.”

“Get me out of here!” I tried to scream, but the words didn’t come out. My throat was locked in ""prayer"" mode. I could only make the guttural sounds.

“You cannot leave,” Arantes continued, calm. “The frequency must be maintained within line of sight. The glass is the focusing lens. You are the new projector. The audio system was destroyed, Jonas. Now, it is just your voice. Direct into the room’s acoustics.”

The lights in the control room went out. Only a dim light remained on, illuminating the empty cell on the other side of the glass.

And a new button lit up on the panel in front of me. A button that injected water into my mouth through a tube that came out of the headrest.

“The contract was for life, Jonas. You should have read the fine print. 'Monitoring and Containment'. You are the Containment now.”

That was... I don’t know how long ago. There is no clock here.

My knees hurt, even though I’m sitting. I feel like they are trying to fuse to the chair. My eyes burn. I don’t blink anymore. And my voice... my voice isn’t mine anymore. It is a constant hum, an organic machine built to keep the demon sleeping.

Sometimes, when exhaustion hits and I slow the rhythm, I see it. The floor of the cell starts to sweat that black slime. And I hear its voice, from down below, laughing at me.

“Sing, little bird. Sing until your throat tears. I have all the time in the world. And you only have one life.”

My name was Jonas. Now, I am just the sound.

God help us.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",2,1766550191.0,lorefi,1,1.0,False
