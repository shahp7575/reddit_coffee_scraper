The kitchen is often considered the heart of the home, and it’s where culinary magic happens. If you’re looking to refresh or completely transform your kitchen space into a more aesthetic and inviting area, you’ve come to the right place. In this article, we’ll explore 15 stunning kitchen ideas that will not only improve the functionality of your space but also enhance its visual appeal.

  
1. Embrace Open Shelving

  
Open shelving can dramatically alter the perception of your kitchen. It creates a sense of openness and allows you to display your beautiful dishware, plants, and cookbooks.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Install floating shelves:

  
Choose materials that complement your kitchen’s color scheme.

  
Styling your shelves:

  
Organize items by color or size for a cohesive look. Add decorative items like plants or artful bowls for added design flair.

  
2. Incorporate Natural Elements

  
Bringing nature indoors adds warmth and tranquility to your kitchen. Consider natural woods, stones, and lush greenery.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Use wooden cabinets or accents:

  
Go for reclaimed or sustainably sourced wood.

  
Add indoor plants:

  
Herbs like basil, rosemary, or decorative plants like snake plant provide beauty and functionality.

  
3. Choose a Bold Backsplash

  
A statement backsplash can turn a mundane kitchen into a stylish focal point. From colorful tiles to intricate patterns, the options are endless.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Select a unique tile design:

  
Look for geometric patterns or vibrant colors.

  
Use peel-and-stick tiles:

  
For a budget-friendly option, consider removable tiles that mimic the look of traditional materials.

  
4. Opt for Matte Finishes

  
Matte finishes, whether on cabinets or countertops, can give your kitchen a modern, sophisticated look that feels less clinical than shiny surfaces.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Choose matte cabinet paint:

  
Look for high-quality products that are durable and easy to clean.

  
Use matte countertops:

  
Options like quartz in a matte finish can add elegance without sacrificing durability.

  
5. Install a Farmhouse Sink

  
Farmhouse sinks are not only stylish but also practical. They provide ample space for washing large pots and pans while adding a rustic charm.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Select a deep, wide basin:

  
Ensure it fits your kitchen’s design.

  
Pair with industrial-style faucets:

  
This combination enhances the farmhouse aesthetic.

  
6. Add Customized Lighting

  
Lighting can dramatically affect the ambiance of any space. Unique lighting fixtures can serve as art pieces themselves.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Choose pendant lights:

  
Over the island or dining area, select fixtures that reflect your style.

  
Install under-cabinet lighting:

  
This provides task lighting while creating a warm glow.

  
7. Use Color Grading

  
Playing with color can transform your kitchen. Consider a two-tone palette, or even a bright accent wall.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Select complementary colors:

  
Soft pastels can create a calm atmosphere; bold colors inspire energy.

  
Use painter’s tape for clean lines:

  
Ensure your walls or cabinets look professional.

  
8. Incorporate a Kitchen Island

  
A kitchen island acts as a functional workspace and a gathering spot. It can become an instant focal point in your kitchen.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Choose a contrasting color from cabinetry:

  
This can add visual interest.

  
Add seating:

  
Bar stools or a built-in bench encourage socialization.

  
9. Opt for Vintage Accents

  
Vintage items add character and history to your kitchen. From rustic decor to retro utensils, these touches can personalize your space.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Source antique items:

  
Look for unique finds at garage sales, thrift shops, or vintage stores.

  
Display them strategically:

  
Arrange them in open shelves or on countertops.

  
10. Go for a Monochromatic Scheme

  
Using shades of a single color can create a cohesive and serene kitchen atmosphere.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Mix textures:

  
Incorporate different materials like wood, metal, and textiles.

  
Vary the shades:

  
Use light and dark tones to add depth.

  
11. Create a Cozy Nook

  
A cozy eating area or reading nook in your kitchen provides a perfect spot to relax, sip coffee, or enjoy family meals.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Add a small table and chairs:

  
Choose furniture that complements your kitchen style.

  
Include cushions and throws:

  
Make the space inviting and warm.

  
12. Incorporate Smart Technology

  
Integrating smart appliances and technology can simplify tasks while maintaining aesthetics.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Choose sleek, modern appliances:

  
Look for built-in designs that blend seamlessly with cabinetry.

  
Use smart lighting and devices:

  
Control ambiance and appliances with your smartphone for convenience.

  
13. Display Artwork

  
Incorporating artwork into your kitchen is a unique way to express your personality and style.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Hang framed prints or photographs:

  
Choose themes that resonate with you, such as food or landscapes.

  
Add creative chalkboards:

  
Use them for daily menus or art.

  
14. Create Architectural Interest

  
Details like crown molding, decorative frames, or unique cabinet designs can elevate your kitchen’s aesthetic.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Install crown molding:

  
This adds elegance and draws the eye upward.

  
Use decorative trim on cabinets:

  
Choose ornate styles for a more traditional look.

  
15. Consider a Neutral Palette

  
A calm, neutral color palette can make even the smallest kitchens feel spacious and serene. This timeless choice allows accents to shine.

  
How to Achieve the Look:

  
Use whites, creams, or greys:

  
Select furniture and cabinetry in soft tones.

  
Add pops of color through decor:

  
Use vibrant utensils, fruits, or art elements.

  
Conclusion

  
Transforming your kitchen into an aesthetic and inviting space doesn’t require a complete renovation. By thoughtfully incorporating elements like open shelving, vintage accents, or a bold backsplash, you can create a kitchen that reflects your personal style and enhances its functionality. Explore these ideas to discover which resonates with your aesthetic, and don’t be afraid to get creative! With a bit of inspiration and modern touches, your kitchen can become a centerpiece of your home for family gatherings, culinary adventures, and everyday living. Happy decorating!

1kqxxgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/PATH2GERMANY/comments/1kqxxgg/why_should_one_go_to_germany_for_higher_studies/,Why Should One Go to Germany for Higher Studies?,"Germany — the land of poets, thinkers, and engineers — has become one of the **top global destinations for higher education**, and not without good reason. Every year, thousands of international students pack their bags and head to this vibrant European nation not just for bratwurst and beer, but for something far more life-changing: **world-class education, without the crushing debt**.

Here's why pursuing higher studies in Germany might just be the best decision of your life.





# 1. Tuition-Free Education at Public Universities

Let’s start with the jaw-dropper: **most public universities in Germany charge ZERO tuition fees** for both domestic and international students — yes, you read that right! Whether you're from India, Brazil, or South Africa, you can study your entire degree program at some of the world's top institutions **almost free of cost**.

While you may have to pay a minimal administrative or semester fee (usually €150–€300), this often includes perks like **public transport passes**, student services, and even discounts on food and cultural activities. In contrast to the rising costs of education in the US or UK, **Germany lets you invest in your future without drowning in debt**.

# 2. World-Class Universities and Programs

Germany boasts over **400 universities**, with more than **13 of them ranked among the top 250 globally** (according to QS and THE rankings). Institutions like **TU Munich, Heidelberg University, RWTH Aachen, and LMU Munich** are internationally renowned for their academic excellence.

What’s more? **Many programs, especially at the Master’s level, are taught in English**, meaning you can thrive academically even if your German skills aren’t fluent yet (although learning the language is a huge plus!).

# 3.  Cutting-Edge Research and Innovation

Germany is home to some of the most respected research organizations in the world — think **Max Planck Society, Helmholtz Association, Fraunhofer Institutes**, and more. These institutes collaborate closely with universities and industries, making **Germany a global powerhouse for applied research**.

If you’re someone who dreams of working on real-world problems, from **climate change and AI to automotive innovation**, studying in Germany means you’ll likely find a seat at the table — or even lead the discussion.

**4. Strong Industry-Academia Connection and Job Prospects**

Germany isn’t just about theory. The education system here is deeply **practical and industry-oriented**. Most technical and applied sciences programs include **internships, co-op placements, and thesis opportunities with companies**.

Moreover, Germany has a **low unemployment rate** and is facing skill shortages in several sectors, meaning **graduates in STEM, healthcare, and IT fields are in high demand**.

**5. Global Recognition of German Degrees**

A degree from a German university is **recognized and respected worldwide**. Whether you plan to work in Europe, return home, or pursue further studies elsewhere, your German education will stand out on your résumé.

# 6.  Affordable Living and High Quality of Life

Compared to other Western countries, **Germany offers a relatively low cost of living** — especially when paired with the absence of tuition fees. Student housing, subsidized meals, healthcare, and public transport make living in cities like Leipzig or Dresden quite manageable even on a student budget.

Plus, Germany ranks high in **safety, cleanliness, public services, and work-life balance**. Cities like Munich, Hamburg, and Berlin consistently score well in global quality-of-life indices.

# 7. Cultural Diversity and International Community

Germany is one of the most **multicultural countries in Europe**, hosting over **350,000 international students** from every corner of the globe. University campuses are vibrant, welcoming spaces with **numerous student clubs, language cafés, and international student networks**.

# 8. Visa, Work Rights, and Post-Study Opportunities

Unlike many countries that restrict international students’ work rights, **Germany allows students to work part-time (up to 120 full days per year)** during their studies. This not only helps you gain experience but also supports your finances.

Even better, after graduation, international students can apply for an **18-month post-study work visa** to find a job related to their field of study. Once employed, you can work your way toward permanent residency.

Germany’s clear, student-friendly immigration policies **make it easier to plan a long-term future** — whether in Germany or elsewhere in the EU.

**9. A Perfect Blend of History, Travel, and Modern Life**

When you're not studying, Germany offers a treasure trove of **castles, cathedrals, festivals, forests, and futuristic cities**. Whether you want to explore Berlin’s gritty art scene, hike the Black Forest, or sip coffee in a medieval square in Heidelberg, **there’s always something magical around the corner**.

And with its central location in Europe, weekend trips to **Paris, Amsterdam, Prague, or Vienna** are just a train ride away. Thanks to student discounts and the efficient transport network, **exploring Europe is both easy and affordable**.

# 10. Language Advantage and Personal Growth

While many courses are taught in English, picking up German will open even more doors — socially, professionally, and culturally. Plus, learning a new language is proven to **boost cognitive skills, confidence, and adaptability**.

Living in a new country also brings profound personal growth. From figuring out public transport to adapting to German punctuality, studying abroad teaches **resilience, independence, and intercultural skills** — qualities that go far beyond a textbook.





**CONCLUSION**

Choosing a country for higher studies is more than just comparing tuition fees or university rankings. It’s about choosing a **culture, a lifestyle, and a future**. Germany offers a unique blend of **academic rigor, affordability, innovation, and adventure**.

So if you're dreaming of **a degree that matters**, a **career that excites**, and a **life that inspires**, remember this:

 **Germany isn’t just a destination. It’s a launchpad.**

1kqxwk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopEatingSeedOils/comments/1kqxwk2/not_enough_omega6/,not enough Omega-6?,"Cleaned up my diet to start losing weight, & had already prioritized olive oil > canola oil but was still eating out a decent amount, but often from healthy places that don't necessarily use it.

I had a lightbulb moment because I think my low omega 6 intake is making my eczema/dermatitis/KP/folliculitis all much worse! 

For reference, I usually have 
- coffee 
- 2 eggs cooked in a bit of butter (breakfast tacos) + OJ or a protein smoothie
- 4 oz wild salmon cooked in a bit of butter + rice/veggies/fruit 
- repeat for dinner 

Intuitively I have been craving hazelnut butter in smoothies (I know hazelnuts are high in omega 6) & walnuts. 

I just have struggled with skin issues for a while & can't figure out how people get the minimum omega 6 without messing up their macros.

I'm seeing a nutritionist soon & will update this when I know what she says, but wanted to ask cuz I could only find posts on here from like 15 years ago when paleo got hot on the subject!

1kqxt91,https://www.reddit.com/r/MiamiBachelorette/comments/1kqxt91/miami_bachelorette_2025_recap_recommendations/,Miami Bachelorette 2025 🏝️ Recap + Recommendations,"We had the best time in Miami for my Bachelorette party that the girls & I are still talking about that weekend! And I want to pass on what I now know/have learned in the process from the experiences we had, and let it serve as guidance for those who may need it amidst all the planning and questions that arise. I found that most other posts/comments on Reddit weren’t actually as helpful as I had hoped, primarily because the information was from 2-3 years ago and was already so outdated that most of the places/clubs mentioned there have long closed.

I left comments on other people’s posts who were asking for guidance/recommendations in Miami and my inbox blew up with messages and follow up questions. So I figured the best and most constructive way to share our experience and recommendations is through this recap post.

I’ll share the recap and all of my recommendations for clubs, pool parties, how to get on the guest list, restaurants, where to stay, how to get around, etc. Basically everything that you will need to know so you’re prepped and ready for Miami. Also creating this guide because I wish something like this would have existed when I was planning my Bachelorette party. But luckily we figured it out and came out with amazing memories!

**Overall Impressions:** I’m so happy that I went with Miami for my Bachelorette party destination. I’m obsessed with Miami now. It’s such a beautiful, vibrant and sexy city. There are so many things to do and places to go. We never ran out of ideas or things to do, and everything is so easily accessible.

**Where to stay:** I highly recommend staying in Miami Beach, this way you’re close to everything and anywhere you go is a quick walk/ride. There are so many hotels right on the beach all along Collins Ave and there are many Airbnb options. The choice you will go with will, of course, ultimately depend on your group’s budget and group size. Ideally, I think all Bachelorette groups want to be together in one house to hang out. But if you don’t find a good Airbnb option for your group size, and have to go with a hotel option instead, just ask for the customer service/front desk to get you rooms close together, so it’s easy for you to go room to room. You could also get one of the rooms that is more like a suite and is bigger, and have it be the designated group hangout spot. In terms of location in Miami Beach, anything on Collins Ave from 5th to 50th St, South Beach, South of Fifth, Sunset Harbor, and West Avenue. Another neighborhood that’s great in Miami is Edgewater or Design District, while it’s inland, it’s still very close to Miami Beach and very easy to get around anywhere. Brickell has its own mini tropical New York vibe but it’s the furthest neighborhood, so expect to spend a lot more time on commuting and in traffic, and more $ Ubering back and forth to Miami Beach.

**Transportation:** We Ubered everywhere, and needed 2 cars to fit everyone. Everything was very accessible and easy to get to and prices were actually very reasonable. Uber XL was anywhere between $10-20, depending on how far we were going, of course. Premier SUV would be somewhere around double the price of Uber XL. But there are so many Luxury SUVs in Miami that whenever we requested Uber XL, a Luxury SUV showed up every time.

**Restaurants:** There are so many incredible places in Miami. You guys will have a fun time choosing where to go. Here are the restaurants that we loved + new places that recently opened that I’ve been to and loved on my recent trips back to Miami, so you guys have the most updated list to choose from.   
**In Miami Beach:** MILA, Japon at The Setai, Jaya at The Setai, Pao at Faena Hotel, WATR at 1Hotel, Cecconis, Call Me Gabby (last three all are great for both lunch or dinner)   
**In Edgewater/Design District:** Zuri, Mandolin (great lunch spot), Dior Cafe (another cute lunch/coffee spot) **In Downtown:** Casa Neos, Seaspice **In Brickell:** Delilah, Sexy Fish

We were a big group. It was 13 of us total. Some of the restaurants might ask you for a deposit to secure your reservation or if you request a table outside. It all depends on the size of your group and also on the season. My Bachelorette was in the summer, which is considered to be Miami’s off season, so mostly all places were more laid back with their policy and we got away without having to do a deposit. The one place that did ask us for a deposit, it was for $25/person, which I thought was more than reasonable and we agreed. There are other places like Kiki on the River that asked us to commit to a minimum spend of $250/person for a table outside, which I thought was ridiculous and not worth it. But as you can see from the list, there are so many options to choose from. Just try to book 1-2 months in advance. Leaving it to the last minute will not go well in Miami, especially for big groups.

**Clubs/Pool Parties:** For everything nightlife/pool parties related, [@theguestlistmiami](https://www.instagram.com/theguestlistmiami/) on Instagram took care of us with everything. They actually ended up saving my entire Bachelorette weekend. They are amazing, very professional, reliable, and communicative/responsive. They have a lot of vip hosts at every venue in the city and can get you on the guest list to anywhere you want to go.

I’ll tell you exactly how my bachelorette weekend almost went to shit so you don’t make the same rookie mistake I did. The nightlife aspect was the only element that was completely unaccounted for because I read so many other posts and comments on Reddit suggesting to just “wing it” and leave it to the last minute because “you will end up running into so many promoters on the beach or the street”. *Bad, bad idea and huge mistake.* Yes, you will get approached… but either by snake oil salesmen or straight up scavenging vultures.

We got to the beach on Friday afternoon as soon as we landed in Miami. We got approached by like 10 different promoters. Some of them tried sell us fake tickets, some tried to sell us tickets to clubs that don’t even sell tickets, and some were so sketchy promising us the moon. Each approaching promoter was hilariously sketchier than the other. So we decided to go with one that seemed more decent than the rest. He invited us to a pool party at SLS on that Friday afternoon and promised us a “vip table and everything is free”. We get there, and as soon as he walks us in, and counts us like some herd to get credit for us from the pool party, he pulls us aside and tells us to pay him $50 each if we want to be with him at his table and have free drinks. We didn’t like his attitude and the fact that he deceived us, so we declined to pay. He rolled his eyes and left us. We ended up buying our own drinks at the bar and leaving shortly after.

Later that night, we messaged a different “moon promising” promoter that we met at the beach, who promised to take us to LIV if we would go with him to Vendome first. We reluctantly agreed because we wanted to go to LIV and heard stories about how expensive it is to get into LIV. We get to Vendome, and same thing happens. He asks us to pay him $50 each to be at his table (we didn’t even want to be at that club and only went there because he promised he would take us to LIV for free). This time we decided to just pay this guy $50 each (as that’s what 2 drinks ended up costing us at SLS earlier that day when the other promoter left us hanging).

Everything was going ok, we had some shots and drinks at his table, until 1 hour later when we asked him about LIV. He was stalling and brushed it off saying that the plans have changed and the guest list is closed. We got super annoyed and felt deceived again. We decided to go to LIV anyway by ourselves. We get to LIV, the line at the door was so crazy that we waited 20 minutes to get to talk to a doorman, just so we can get quoted $5k for a table or $200 each just to get in. There’s no way we were going pay that, so we told the doorman that we were on the promoter’s guest list (the one who was supposed to take us there). The doorman told us they only do tables or cover charge, and that there is no guest list for LIV and he had no idea who that promoter was. So that guy didn’t even work there and completely ripped us off!

We decided to continue “winging it” and go to E11even, just so we can spend more money on Uber going all the way across town, to be quoted even crazier prices at the door. E11even asked us for $7k for a table or $300 each to get in.

I was so frustrated and nearly in tears thinking that my entire Bachelorette weekend would be ruined. The girls & I went on Instagram and started looking up clubs by location, and kept seeing story posts from @theguestlistmiami, so we decided to message them. The fact that it was an actual company and not some random promoter with 100k fake followers or a private account seemed more promising. Especially seeing their online presence, and many people tagging them on instagram in both stories and posts (you can’t fake those!).

I mentioned to them our earlier experiences and they were very compassionate. They told me that, unfortunately, it happens all the time, especially with beach scammers, lying promoters, and without proper planning. They also confirmed the crazy prices and the fact that there is no guest list at LIV and E11even.

They replied super fast, asked us for pictures of our group, which I find slightly strange, but apparently this is how the guest list works in Miami. They quickly presented us with all of their options available of where we can go so last minute and explained to me how it works.

They recommended us Gala, so that’s what we decided to go with that Friday night. After we completed the form they sent over to get on the guest list, they immediately got us in touch with a VIP host, who would greet and take care of us.

When we arrived at the club, our host met us at the door, we skipped the entire line outside and he walked us right in. It felt so cool! The host took us to his table, brought us bottles, and he made sure we were having fun. What I also loved and appreciated was that he was very attentive and would check in on us, but he didn’t hover over us and would just let us have fun and do our thing.

They also ended up surprising me with a Bachelorette sign, which I didn’t expect or even knew I could ask for. It was very sweet and considerate!

We didn’t have to pay for any tickets/cover charge at the door, or for any drinks. We had free admission, vip entry, skipping all the lines, and the host brought us more bottles, so we had drinks all night (we even left a full bottle on the table when we were leaving). The only thing we paid was the service fee/tip on the form we completed, as they told us that no promoter or host is allowed to ask us for money.

After that amazing Friday night, I ended up using them for the rest of the weekend! We decided to go for a pool party on Saturday and another nightclub on Saturday night. We went through the same process to get on the guest list and they had their hosts taking care of us. We ended up doing the pool party at Strawberry Moon (the music wasn’t the best, but we had lots of fun) and later that Saturday night, we went with them to MAD club. Their promoters/hosts for the rest of the weekend were all very professional and attentive.

As you can see, the nightlife aspect was the only part that gave us a tough time in the beginning because I followed poor advice to just “wing it”, instead of being more intentional.

Overall, we loved Miami and had such an amazing experience! It’s a really fun and vibrant city with so much to offer. I hope you will have the best time in Miami, and with all of this information, you will be better prepared than I was and you won’t have to waste your time figuring it out as you go.

1kqxrha,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalHealthFinds/comments/1kqxrha/i_replaced_my_whitening_strips_and_sensitivity/,I replaced my whitening strips and sensitivity toothpaste with Larineco gum (and I’m not going back),"So here’s something I didn’t think I’d be writing: a full-on review of a chewing gum. But Larineco gum caught my attention in a way that most dental products don’t. I’d seen the words *remineralizing gum* before, but I never really knew what that meant until I stumbled into a *Larineco gum reddit* thread where people were sharing their experiences with sensitivity relief, whiter teeth, and even enamel repair. All from chewing gum?

I didn’t expect much. But 30 days in, I’ve got some things to say. If you're into natural oral care, tired of harsh whiteners, or looking for something to help with that sharp nerve pain in your teeth, this might be for you.

**What is Larineco gum, exactly?**

Larineco gum is a **remineralizing chewing gum** made with ingredients that actually support oral health. The star of the show is **Nano Hydroxyapatite** \- a mineral that's basically what your tooth enamel is made of. The idea is that when you chew this gum, those tiny particles bind to your teeth and start repairing weak spots, smoothing out surface damage, and building enamel back up.

It also contains **Xylitol**, which is known to reduce bacteria that cause cavities and dry mouth, and **Mastic**, a natural resin that helps with plaque and inflammation. The gum is fluoride-free, vegan, and made without harsh chemicals or synthetic flavors.

**Why I even tried it**

Like a lot of people, I’ve dealt with tooth sensitivity for years. Cold drinks. Air hitting my teeth. That zapping feeling after biting into something sweet. I’ve used every sensitive toothpaste on the market. Some helped. Most didn’t.

Then there’s the whitening struggle. I drink coffee. I’ve tried strips. They work, but the trade-off was always more sensitivity. And let’s be real, whitening strips are a hassle.

That’s what made me look into alternatives, and that’s where I ran into *Larineco gum reddit* conversations. People weren’t just saying it worked - they were saying it *felt different*. That their enamel felt stronger. That their dentists noticed. So I bought a box.

**What actually happened in 30 days**

**1. My sensitivity dropped noticeably**  
This was the biggest change for me. I used to flinch at cold water hitting my molars. After about 10 days of chewing Larineco twice a day, that stopped happening. It didn’t feel numbed - it just didn’t hurt anymore.

**2. My teeth felt smoother and cleaner**  
I didn’t realize how rough some of my teeth had gotten until they started to feel smooth again. Even my tongue noticed. That gritty texture from plaque buildup or weak enamel? Gone.

**3. My breath stayed fresh longer**  
I didn’t expect this one. I thought it would be a typical gum situation - minty for 5 minutes, then gone. But the effects lasted way longer, and I wasn’t reaching for mints all afternoon. I chalk that up to the Xylitol and Mastic working on the bacteria side of things.

**4. My smile looked brighter**  
Not fake bleach-white, but clearer. Healthier. Especially along the gumline, where coffee stains used to settle. I’m assuming it’s because of how remineralizing smooths out enamel and helps reflect light better. Either way, it made me feel better about smiling in pictures.

**If you’re curious, this is the link I used to order it**:  
[**Try Larineco – Remineralize While You Chew**](https://getlarineco.com/offer-01/?lpid=1056&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1056&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1056&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1056&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalHealthFinds)

**Does it actually help with cavities?**

I can’t say much from personal experience yet, but the science behind **Larineco remineralizing gum** makes sense. Nano Hydroxyapatite helps seal up early-stage enamel damage, and Xylitol fights the acid-producing bacteria that lead to decay. Some people on reddit even mentioned their dentist spotted fewer problem areas after using it regularly.

If you’re interested in that side of it, here’s a helpful page I read before trying it:  
[**Can Larineco Gum Actually Repair Cavities?**](https://getlarineco.com/repair-cavities/?lpid=2533&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1056&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1056&device_type=&country_name=&uid=2533&oid=1056&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/NaturalHealthFinds)

**What I liked most about Larineco**

* It’s **fluoride-free** and clean - no harsh ingredients
* Super easy to add into your day. Just chew and go
* It works **gently**, without causing more irritation
* Made in the USA, third-party tested, and safe for kids
* It’s one of the few “natural” products that actually delivers

**Final thoughts**

If you’re wondering whether **Larineco gum reviews** are real or if **Larineco remineralizing gum** is just another gimmick, I’d say it’s worth a shot. It’s simple, tastes good, and if you deal with sensitivity or enamel wear, it could be the easiest win for your teeth all year.

Let me know if anyone else has been using this long-term. I’m curious what happens after 3 or 6 months. Will definitely keep chewing.",1,1747721091.0,NaturalHealthFinds,0,1.0,False

2nd option would be to wait until AFTER the summer to see whether I get a return offer, and then start coffee chatting if I don’t. But that is a bit late. Some first wave application deadlines will have already passed by then.

I just want to share my story here and get some support because I received a lot of flak from people who know me. 

For context, I 28F met my husband ""Joey"" 29M back when we were in high school through my twin brother ""Ian"". Joey and Ian were already good friends before we were introduced to the point where Joey would go to our house almost everyday for them to play video games. Joey and I however were not close and he just knew me as Ian's twin sister and me vice versa. 

It all started around our junior year where I noticed that Joey wasn't coming at our house that much. When I asked Ian, he just shrugged me off and really won't give me a decent answer. But since we go to the same school, I found out later through school gossip that they have ended their friendship because Joey, a known bully of our school, allegedly ""bullied"" a transferee that Ian had developed feelings for. Joey apparently knew Ian's feelings for this girl so he decided to target her. 

Joey was pissed when Ian chose the girl over their friendship so he released his anger towards me, to the point where he was harassing and annoying me every time he sees me in school. (I won't get into details on how he bullied me, because some of what he did were people considered to be horrible) 

But I admit I kind of like the attention that I was receiving from him, because before that, I was a nobody. Nobody really bothered to get to know me back then, and the only friend I had transferred to another school so I just really kept to myself. When Joey started bullying me, I was the talk of our school. Every now and then, someone will come up to me, ask if I was okay, and give comforting words. I loved the attention so much that I came to the point of provoking Joey just so he would bully me. 

Ian actually knew of Joey bullying me, and we had a serious conversation about it. He asked me if I'm okay and if I want him to talk to Joey but I assured him I was okay. I admit, I don't want him to interfere and make Joey stop bullying me.

Graduation came and I left our hometown to go to university in the city. I haven't heard about Joey ever since. 

Fast forward to 2022 when I received a message through IG. It's from Joey. It was a random ""Hi, how are you?"" message. I don't know why but I replied to his message. Since then, we exchanged messages everyday, followed each other in IG, and decided to meet for coffee. 

I was expecting it to be awkward but it wasn't. Our conversation flowed naturally, like old friends catching up. I don't know why but I felt at ease with him. It's like he was a changed man. He was polite, he was sweet, he was not the Joey that used to bully me before. 

To cut the already long story short, we started dating after several dates. We dated for two years and in 2024, he proposed. Of course I said yes. 

At this time, I haven't told anyone about dating Joey. But since getting engaged, I knew I had to introduce him to my family and friends. As I expected, they were against our marriage, especially Ian. My friends, who didn't know about my history with Joey, were appalled to know that I agreed to marry him knowing our history. I really tried to change their minds about Joey, telling them that he's a changed man but they can't be convinced. Everyone from my family and all my friends have decided to not attend our wedding. 

Due to this heavy disapproval, we decided to elope. We got married this year last February. Joey's brother and his SIL were our only witnesses. 

When my family found out that we eloped, they cut me off. My friends also cut me off, said they were disgusted by me marrying my former bully. 

I don't understand why they can't accept Joey. I was the bullied one, but I have accepted him. Why can't they give him a chance?

I asked for the moms number and suggested the date, but before i could invite them she invited us over and specified me and my husband stay for the playdate while our daughter was there. We thought it would be a nice way to get to know the parents and so we agreed. I've always been taught not to show up anywhere empty handed, so we brought a cute cake from a local bakery. Some background info, both families are indian and the culture is to *always* have something laid out for guests, even if its a bowl of nuts or indian snacks, with chai (indian tea). Even if someone drops by unexpectedly, the expectation is always at least a cup of chai.

Upon arriving, the mother took the cake and placed it in the kitchen. She took out snacks for the kids (crackers, pre-cut cheese and fruits) and gently added ""these snacks are for adults too"", we smiled but didn't touch any of it. About 45 min goes by and they ask us if we want some coffee or tea or soda, not to be too demanding we say we'll have what you're having. They proceed to say they haven't prepped anything, so would have to make it specially, we say water is fine and they hand us a glass of water.

The playdate continues for a bit and then we leave before dinner time.  I am completely baffled at the lack of planning, consideration and hosting that happened, not to mention the $45 that i spend on that cake.  
Obviously, I have to reciprocate by having a playdate at my place next, and the normal me would prep some snacks for kids AND the parents, but seeing that they didnt really care to do much for us, I am thinking to just pull the same stunt and just make snacks for the kids. so a couple of questions here

1. AITA for wanting to pull the same stunt when they come over? AND
2. Is this how playdates work? Are you not supposed to prep something super simple for the parents?  thought the point was for parents to also get to know each other a bit while the kids play.
3. Also, for future play dates..do you not bring anything for the parents when you go their house for the first time for a kid's playdate?

I thought it best to do a test run with a cheap honey.  The cheapest I could find was Kirkland wildflower. I didn't particularly like the flavor,  but then it was the cheapest I could find.  

I also also decide to try a coffee mead again.  
I used 200g ground monsoon Malabar coffee (heavy body,  cocoa and rustic.  Very low acidity), roasted just to second crack, then degassed for a few days.  3L water and refrigerated for 24hrs. After draining, had 2.5L of ok strength coffee. 

Used 1.4kg honey and set the saucepan in a cast iron pan to even the heat.  I'm using a conduction hob and on the lower powers it's on for a few seconds, then off for a few.  I took temp readings every 5min with ir and probe. Last time I did this, the probe was reading higher. 
It went for 90 min but only really started to darken at 60 min (around 124°c). It just got to 141°c at 90min and I stopped it there and poured into the coffee.  Last time I cooked a local ""winter honey"" and it smelled incredible.  This didn't smell anywhere near as good.  

I drill whipped the coffee before and after adding the honey,  hopefully got it up to 8ppm. 

5g Lutra kveik yeast  6.25g goferm,  125g tap water.  
Dissolved the goferm then sprinkled the yeast at 40°c. After 15 min,  added 15ml of must. Over the next couple hours added more must until it was around 500ml in total before pitching it. In this way,  we can acclimate the yeast to the temp and sugar content of the must.  Pitched it when the temps were almost the same.  

12hrs later and it's bubbling.  Have been giving it a good shake.  Will continue for the first 24hrs and might drill whip it if I'm feeling daring.  
At 24hrs I'll add the fermaid O. I haven't decided exact amount,  maybe 1g x3. But my ferments typically go very fast as I'm brewing at a high ambient temp (around 28°c) and often miss the 2/3 break at 48hrs.

1kqxf02,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_WorldAwayTweedy/comments/1kqxf02/grim_part_four_final/,Grim - Part Four (Final),"The Christmas party is later tonight. I’ve told the team I’ll meet them there—took the day off otherwise. 

I have a few things on the to-do list.

First—back to Cedar Valley Pediatric. I linger near Ethan Hargrove’s room.

I just want to know—*if death will reach him anyways.* Or if things might play out differently.

The hallway cycles through all kinds of movement—nurses, doctors, parents. Carts wheeled past. The occasional gurney. A few passing glances in my direction. And then comes the update that I eavesdrop on:

“We’re… I mean, I don’t want to get too ahead of things, but… we are seeing meaningful improvement. What had been looking really critical is… starting to look…” I can hear the doctor stifling a word like ‘manageable’. “It’s still early. We’re going to monitor this really, really closely.”

And then I hear the response of the family members. The beautiful response.

And for the first time, life feels okay, with no caveats, asterisks, or disclaimers. A moment in my life is simply—alright. 

And I take that with me, all throughout the day.

I get ready for the party. Actually *try* to get ready. I face the mirror, buttoning up a new dress shirt to see if it works with the pants. I think twice. Grab another shirt, hold it up. New combo—maybe the colors land better.

Time stops.

*A new accident.*

One I head to and one I don’t circumvent. I sit with the man in the car, about to die, and explain to him what’s happening. *I meet reality where it is.* And give him the requisite time and empathy needed. 

I can’t say for certain—much like Liz’s new flair for life which I already see reverting back to old patterns in micro-glimpses—if my attitude shift is just for this moment in time and the walls will come back up soon. 

But I hope. I really hope they won’t. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The group is planning to roll up to the Christmas party at the rented convention center at 6:30 PM.

It’s 6:16 right now, and I’m near-enough to the venue.

I just have one more stop.

**6:16 PM - Lianna Kerrigan - The Astoria - Unit 1805** 

I enter and make my way to the elevator. I get off on the eighteenth floor.

I head to the unit. Twist the doorknob. *Locked.* Rare as it is, this sometimes happens. In one in every ninety or so murders—give or take—the journey to the futurely deceased requires improvisation or some form of anomaly. No back door or window here for me to leverage.

*Anomaly it is.* 

I force my shoulder into the door. Then again. And again. And *again* with more force. Cracks, splintering, something giving, until I finally—

Break through. And catch the sight.

The living room floor. The carpet already stained with blood. 

A man on top of Lianna, Lianna’s body shining, knife held right above her chest by the assailant. A downward motion stopped by the universal pause button.

And I wonder what he means to her. If he’s a jilted ex-lover, a vengeful friend, or just a deranged lunatic who somehow got access to her. 

He’s one second and a few centimeters now from destroying everything she might’ve been able to offer the world. 

*Recalibrate.*

It’s painful. Sometimes what I have to do is painful.

I step over to them, crouch down, and prepare to tell her that this is a cruel world sometimes. That things play out unfairly sometimes. That there might be a cosmic tapestry to all this, and that at the very least she’ll escape before the worst of the pain comes.

*And that I’ll hold the door open for her.*

And to myself I say—I’ve done *enough now,* to make it all somewhat better. 

I reach for her arm. Rare as these are, I’ve seen murders before.

*Liz, at the end of the universe, listening to Stereolab.*

I grab his arm instead.

The man, blade now trembling, joins me in this sacred, miserable place where nothing moves except for the express purpose of murder. I hear his grunt, his breath, his confusion at *someone* holding him in place to deny him that one centimeter. 

He locks eyes with me.

“What—who are—”

*What am I doing?*

“I release you,” I say. 

And I’m little bothered by the life flicking out of his eyes. 

It’s the strange feeling that suddenly overtakes me that I worry about. 

I detach. Something *unwell* and *broken* stirs within me. My eyes shoot over to the floor-to-ceiling glass that lines the unit, overlooking the city which now looks *lightless.* An empty expanse. Like a blackout just swept through.  

I turn—feeling something nearby. The mirage of *something* flashes in the doorway, gone before I can even clock it. 

Back to the city—*light returns.* Buildings blink with spots of illumination that cut through the evening dark. 

And I don’t feel well. 

I don’t feel well at all. 

And the studio audience in my head isn’t saying anything to help. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I cross off Lianna’s name in my hidden crook of the city. Time restarts. 

With fifteen minutes to go before I need to hit the party, I wander the streets. 

My insides continue to twist and turn. I feel my whole being reorienting. 

*Flashes of something in my peripheral.* I look to the left and look to the right, but it fades before I can catch it.

I keep thinking time is about to stop again. In my distraction, I bump into strangers. They swear at me. I understand.

*I’m losing it.*

Minutes tick closer to the event.

I maneuver past coffee shops, makeshift Christmas markets, my steps in the snow, my reflection in store windows—*I’m Ted. Just Ted.*

And then ahead, far ahead, I glance up, and the city ten blocks down looks like it’s submerged in a black hole. I blink, and it’s just the city again.

*It’s nothing. It’ll be fine.*

I’ll recalibrate now. I’ll recalibrate and I’ll stop my tinkering, my bullshit, Lianna’s being the last of my deviations. *I’ll stay the course now.* 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I join the check-in line for the Christmas party at the convention center. Everyone looks great. All of my coworkers look—*great.*

I try to lose myself in their fantastic wardrobes. Dresses, suits, ugly sweaters—

Richie budges in beside me upon noticing me.

“Nice,” he says, giving me a once-over. “You look good man.”

“Thanks Rich,” I say.

He susses out my pretty obviously *off* energy—Liz-style. “You good?”

“Yeah,” I say. “Just—I always get nervous before events?”

He smiles. “You’ll be good, champ.” He squeezes my shoulders. “You’ll be good.”

The slow pace of movement to eventually showing our IDs and getting our drink tickets does well for my artificial mental health, the world staying more or less *stable enough*—

And then we’re inside. And it all looks—cozy. Decorated. Expensive. The fanfare of it all does what it’s supposed to do—pulls you in, softens the edges, presents a festive sort of serenity.

I take it in. In the past, I would’ve found an excuse not to come. In the past, I wouldn’t have noticed how *nice* it all was.

Richie looks down at his phone. “Liz said she got us a table near…” he looks up, “oh shit—there she is!”

He heads to her. I follow. The distant table and her bright dress become clearer with each movement closer. 

“Wow,” she says as we arrive, “you guys actually look kind of sharp.

“Nice turquoise. *You hate blue.*” *Richie.*

“Trying something new,” *Liz.* “And look at you Ted! *Actually not dressed like a high schooler for a change.*” 

I smile. *How much uninterrupted time do I have here?* I check my pocketbook. If memory serves me right, I don’t have to do another sendoff until 10PM. 

I thumb it open—*blank.* I flip a page ahead. *Blank.* Two pages ahead. *Blank.*

“Aw c’mon man, really with the work stuff? *Here?*” says Richie.  

“No it’s just a—dayplanner.” I keep skimming through. “Just to make sure I’m… on top of… things.” I say it nervously. Nothing marking any of the pages. No cosmic remits—nor any of my scribbling.

I look back up at them, close the notebook. *I’m sure it’s fine.* Liz tilts her head, confused.

The music changes. Quaint background instrumentals transition into a louder, more rhythmic track with vocals.

“Shit, they’re already starting with the bops,” she says. She turns to the dance floor. “There’s like three people there. That is… *sad.*” Then—”We need to help them out.”

Richie steps off. “Let me get drunk first.” He beelines to the bar.

Liz shifts to me. “*Dance floor,* or do you need to load up on your drinks first?”

She takes my one second of hesitation as a vote for the former, grabs my arm—

*She takes me there*. And now we’re both in the middle of the sorry scene. And I have no idea how to dance. She clocks that fast, shifts from doing her own thing beside me, and places my hands on her waist, guiding us into an awkward slow dance. A complete mismatch for the upbeat track thumping around us. 

She laughs. “And now this party is *officially cool*,” she says sarcastically.

“Right. Totally,” I say.

The invasive thought to check the notebook again burrows through my skull. I go to reach for it.

“Ted, what’s in that book?” she asks. “Actually?”

“Oh, I already said. It’s just a day planner.”

“Why was it empty when you were just looking at it?”

“It’s—*not empty*.”

“I saw you flip through it. Just a couple of minutes ago. It was empty.”

“I…” *what the fuck do I even say?* “Tore out the pages… I already used.”

“You also look at it every day at work. *But you never write.* You just look.”

“I… write at home,” I say.

Her face wears a lot of expressions I can’t place. “If I tell you something… *insane,* then will you finally let me in on whatever’s going on with you?”

Through all this, we continue swaying. 

“*Sure*,” I finally say.

She takes her time to let out the slow exhale. “The day I almost got hit by a car—I felt time stop.” She gauges my reaction. “I didn’t know what was happening, but I *felt something.* Something grabbed hold of me, and it pulled me away. Away from the spot *where I think I was supposed to die.*” I gulp. Not because of what she’s saying, but because I notice—through the large windows—the cityscape keeps flickering between lights on and total dark. 

“Hey,” she continues, “*you’re not listening to me.*”

Her body starts to glow.

“Ted?” 

“*Sorry*,” I catch myself, shake my head, try to blink it away. “Just in a—weird—headspace—”

The music stops. All sound disappears. We both look over. No one else is moving.

“What is—” she starts before—

I let go of her.

And suddenly she suspends too, joining the rest of the frozen world. 

And I’m unsure what to do now at this suddenly unlively Christmas party. I pull out the small notebook again. Flip it open—

On the first page, *it’s Liz's name.* No date listed beside.

I flip further—*the names of everyone else I’ve saved.* Rather, everyone else whose deaths I cheated. And at the very bottom of the tenth page, a new message:

**You weren’t supposed to interfere.** 

I swallow. Steel myself. Look across the hall and past all the nameless, faceless coworkers I’ve shared a building with all these years, I spot Richie with his drinks. I take a long look at him. Then, at Liz. 

*I look at Liz.* In all of her her-ness. And a new, even more painful feeling twists inside of me. And I feel, very concretely this time, like I’m being watched. 

I grab her arm.

“—happening,” she says, completing her sentence, confusion suddenly settling in for her. “Wait, *I can’t move. Why can’t I—*”

“*Liz,*” I say. “I don’t actually know how much time I have so I might just have to rush everything I’ve ever wanted to say to you. *I’m not a person. I’m some weird fucked up thing that people call Ted.*”

“I don’t—”

“The world wants me to kill you. *Wanted me to kill you.* Maybe still wants that, I’m not sure, but it won’t happen because of me. *I won’t do it.*”

“Ted what the fuck are you—”

“I really liked sitting next to you. You made me feel like… I wasn’t a monster. And so, more than anything, I want to know that you’re on this planet somewhere, *always*. You don’t even need to be nearby, I just need to know that you’re *walking somewhere on Earth*. And maybe in another life I can be your garbage man or something. And I’d see you, accidentally, every Tuesday. And even that would be enough for me.”

Her words battle with themselves.

“Thank you for being nice to me,” I say.

And then I let go of her, for real this time, feeling whatever force is brewing inside me escalate and escalate.

I sprint off the dance floor, and out.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I run back into the city, catching lights and full blocks fall into darkness behind me. *Beside me.* I dash past random strangers whose bodies suddenly take on a golden light as if I’m meant to send them off right now.

And that *feeling* inside me, all the while: rippling. Torturous.

I turn random blocks and street corners off impulse and instinct more than anything else. I look behind me—I catch steps appearing in the snow. Tied to something invisible.

I forge ahead.

*Where am I supposed to go?*

*Where am I even running to?*

I make another turn. I’ve spent so much time in this city. Sent so many people off. So many years of pointless, stressful service, *for what?* In the service of *fucking chaos*?

I feel the entity closing in. I cross into a residential block that feels vaguely familiar. 

*Is there anything even left for me to do?*

I take in the street. It’s *really* familiar. *Why is it familiar?*

*Martin*. Martin—*something or other.* I forget his name. He lived here. He wanted me to tell his kids something.

*It was—*

I continue running.

*Two-thousand something West Elmwood.* I can find it.

The force closes in on me. *Just let me do this last thing.*

*I spot the house.* He wanted me to tell… *his kids*—Elle, Sarah?—that he loves them, *Mom* loves them, *I can still do that, I can still tell them—*

I freeze. Right in front of the house.

*I can’t move.* Outside of subtle muscle movements, I’m landlocked.

I feel something grip around my arm.

With the limited executive function I have available, I force my head to the side.

I spot a robed figure holding me with its skeletal hand.

“*I take it you have outgrown your duties, my child,”* it says to me.

It sounds just like the voice I heard when my life started in front of that burning house. I struggle to speak. “Are you the one… that brought me here?”

No answer, but the softest tell in the hold.

“I didn’t ask to be born,” I continue.

“*Do you forego your duties?”* it asks me.

I feel like a kid. “It’s been so fucking hard.”

*“I understand. So you give up the job?”*

“Why…” I don’t have the right words, “are we letting such horrible things happen to people? Before their times, why are we—”

“*We present the rules in a way that leads to the best outcomes. Most of the time, over-explaining doesn’t do us any good. But perhaps it might’ve in your case. Perhaps you are an outlier, cut from a different, stupid cloth.*” 

“I’m done. I’m done with this. And if you need to kill me—”

“*You will die,*” it says, “*but it seems you’ve fundamentally misunderstood the balance. The universe is organized in such a way, that if it all goes according to the divine plan, with all of the lives, probabilities, and events adhering, then death is minimized. As much as it can be, it is minimized.*”

“I don’t understand what you’re saying.”

And in the mundane snowfall of the frozen world, the arm tightens around me.

*“We kill the fewest people we need to kill, at all times. That’s how the world is set up. When you intervene, the ripple effects of those interventions create new domino effects. Domino effects that aren’t aligned with the universal guiding hand of minimizing death.*”

“What…”

“*Simply put,*” it says, “*your actions have created more death in the world. Much more death.*”

I swallow. “How much more?”

“*By direct cause of your interventions, 22,470 people will die sooner than they were originally meant to.*” 

The studio audience laughs at me. A distorted, fucked-up laugh. I am the punchline. 

“*Will you apologize,*” it says, more emotion in its voice now than in all the preceding sentences combined, *“for all the death you have caused?*”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It’s late. I’m on the roof of our company building. *Still an employee*—so that’s nice.

It’s snowing. Softly, though.

The world is the world, and I’m a human in it now. No ability to *supernaturally* kill people anymore. In a lot of ways, it’s something I would’ve dreamt of a long time ago:

*A world where time doesn’t stop.*

Unfortunately, I won’t get to experience it for too long. The entity told me I have until midnight. And then, I’ll be sent away. 

I asked him—*it?*—what would happen to the souls I saved. If they’ll just get added back to a new booklet belonging to a new reaper. Or *reapers*. The response was a strange one: *“they’ll cover a new spectrum of fates and responsibilities, aligned with their delineation as universal rounding errors. Outliers. Their lives are not of your concern.*”

With the firehose of information I’ve been served, it’s a bit hard to put aside the time to deconstruct that word salad. 

Rather, I look out over the city.

*22,740 people.* That’s the number he gave me.

I pretend the lights that are still on in the expansive cityscape are the 22,740 shining souls that will be sent away sooner because of my interventions.

If I strip away the fucked up context of it all, it at least *looks* pretty. Snowfall and glimmering, festive lights on a pre-Christmas *Christmas party* sort of night. And maybe the whole point is not to look closely. Not analyze the pretty picture in a granular way. Not deconstruct the inner workings. Maybe to just stick to the shallow upper layer, to keep myself from drowning. I wasn’t built to withstand the grand picture, after all. 

I look at the time. *11:59 PM.*

A luxury, in a sense. I get to know exactly when I die.

And rather than teasing myself any longer with the sight of the perfect landscape, I close my eyes.

And soon, I hear sound escape. *Absolute silence.*

And then a hand in mine. 

And I know it’s time.

And this time, I don’t need to hear someone else’s script.

I can meet my reality where it is.

“I’m ready to go,” I say. 

The hand holding mine tightens.

…

“*I know what you are now, Ted,*” she says.

I open my eyes. I look at her.

Her pocketbook is secured against her side. “It said you’d be here,” she continues. 

*Liz.* 

And I realize immediately what her new fate is. What she’s become now.

“It’s okay,” I say. “I knew this was coming.”

“It is okay, Ted. *It’s all gonna be okay.*” She smiles, looks at me in that way she does. “Because I’ll find someone else.”

“You’ll find… someone—”

“*I’ll save you.*”

And she lets me go—

And immediately, I’m standing alone, and the world has resumed, and I have—

*Headphones in.* And my hand is held out in front of me, Liz’s phone in it. I look at the song that’s playing.

“Stayin’ Alive” by the Bee Gees.

She told me she didn't want to be seen with someone like me. For context, I was an unstable person in 202.2. I was considered a ""warfreak"" bc I defended her every time there was a mess that she created. But regardless, I didn't bring up our past bc I thought she would change and stuff, but no,o she didn't. There's more to the story, but I'm too lazy to type it all here.

Fast forward to I think April to May-ish, we ended up having contact again and we started becoming friends again, I thought we were fine but I couldn't shake the feeling of anger everytime I'm with her I don't know why tbh, so I would rant to my other friends about her sometimes I said some badshit or some flaw of her but other than that we were genuinely okay.

Fast forward to November 28, 202,4 this is where everything started, we just got home from our 3-day trip from Olongapo, me and our other friend were pissed at her bc of what happened on the trip, when we were on our way to olongapo she asked us to hand over our money to her because she said she was gonna ""manage it"" and we agreed on giving her our money, SPOILER ALERT DUMB MOVE. Because when we all went our separate ways because we had our dates and stuff, me and my ex went out to go get coffee away from the mall so 4 of them were at the mall, we get a call from them and they were telling us that ""amber lost her wallet containing her bf's (now ex) money and ours""  (I'm using a fake name for obvious reasons) and we were panicking because we were think how are we gonna go home, and she ended up borrowing money from her sugar daddy which is like 5k, and we slept at a friends house and it was his bday so ofc we drank and ate a lot of stuff, fast forward to the morning amber and her bf weren't there bc they went to visit his mom's grave, so the 6 of us went swimming, and when they arrived to the place where we were swimming and I asked her what time we were gonna go home bc my mom was crashing out on me, she told me we couldn't go home cuz we didn't have anymore money, I was like what do you mean u literally had 5k last night how can it just disappear like that, she told me bc she chipped in on the alcohol we were drinking (which she didn't bc our other friend paid for it already) me and my other friend were pissed off at her, so again we had to stay 1 more night at the guy's house bc we had no pamasahe which was so embarrassing btw, and the fact that she had no shame around the guy's parents. We ended up leaving the next day.

So back we're back at home and she asked us two if we wanted to play at the internet cafe after school, me and my other friends agreed, so we were there at the internet cafe which I thought we were joking around bc she was teasing me, and I asked her what ""uhugin"" means she said ""sipunin"" and i said ""oh like you"" she got pissed off and went silent then like an hour after the silence she suddenly walked out which our other friend was supposed to go to her house so i said u should just come over to mine, on our way home i asked her ""don't you get annoyed at her sometimes"" and that's where it started we were ranting to each other about the things she did that annoyed us etc. The next day i asked her to comeover again bc i needed help with my notes and i didn't ask amber because i cant get anything done when shse's in the room, so anyways i only invited the other friend, i posted on facebook because i didn't have data i was asking my friend where she was because i was waiting for her (i was otw home when i posted that) so ofc amber saw the post and she asked my friend which was coming over if she was still included in our circle of friends which she didn't respond to. Then that night that we were doing notes we were also drinking and all of the sudden she made a gc of just us 3 saying all kinds of bs + sinusumbatan niya kami sa lahat ng ginawa niya daw and lahat ng nilibre nya kesho parang wala lang daw siya samin. Then we decided to just end the friendship right then and there bc we were tired of her bs.

So that's where i thought the beef was over, we apologized to each other, i apologized for the rumors i said and the shit i used to call her. I mean she did apologize naman pero i don't feel like it's sincere, so anyways i thought the beef ended there, i returned the things she needed, and other stuff. SPOILER ALERT, it didn't end there, she was still bothering me for a couple of months which did take a toll on my mental health, but i did try to make an effort to understand her but my friends were stopping me for doing so bc she's just manipulating me and honestly that became an eye awakening moment for me because i didn't realize that she was just manipulating and gaslighting me through out the breaking contact thing. And honestly, I don't have the energy anymore to prove that she's the one in the wrong. I have screenshots and everything tbh, but I choose not to show that to everyone, only close friends.

Back to present, it happened last night where i was joking around a mutual friend of me and amber, he replied to my story saying ""ain't no way you're broken again gang you're a bop"" and i said JOKINGLY ""well hell at least I'm not pregnant"" (which amber told me she was but it turns out to be completely bs because i talked to her ex bf and he told me it was just her bullshit so he could stay) anyway he told me that we should face each other blablabla and i jokingly said yeah, that's where he tags me on a story of amber mocking me calling me names and such, and i responded with ""at least i know proper hygiene"", ""at least i have a family that loves me"" ""at least i don't go for my friend's ex's"" like weak insults and she took it srsly, now threatening me with blotter? And police like girl, what's the police gon do

It was one of those cheesy love songs from the '90s, the kind you roll your eyes at as a teen but secretly love. 🍔☕️ Anyway, it instantly transported me back to my high school days, and I realized something kinda huge. 

Back then, I was always trying to be ""perfect""—the perfect daughter, student, girlfriend... whatever. But hearing that song now, I saw how hard I was on myself for not meeting these impossible standards. I was replaying this pattern even today, nitpicking every choice I made.

It hit me that maybe it's time to chill out and give myself a break more often. Perfection's boring anyway, right? Just thought I'd share this little moment of clarity with you guys. 😊",2,1747719663.0,NormaldayEpiphanies,0,1.0,False

Because when we all went our separate ways because we had our dates and stuff, me and my ex went out to go get coffee away from the mall so 4 of them were at the mall, we get a call from them and they were telling us that ""amber lost her wallet containing her bf's (now ex) money and ours""  (I'm using a fake name for obvious reasons) and we were panicking because we were think how are we gonna go home, and she ended up borrowing money from her sugar daddy which is like 5k, and we slept at a friends house and it was his bday so ofc we drank and ate a lot of stuff, fast forward to the morning amber and her bf weren't there bc they went to visit his mom's grave, so the 6 of us went swimming, and when they arrived to the place where we were swimming and I asked her what time we were gonna go home bc my mom was crashing out on me, she told me we couldn't go home cuz we didn't have anymore money, I was like what do you mean u literally had 5k last night how can it just disappear like that, she told me bc she chipped in on the alcohol we were drinking (which she didn't bc our other friend paid for it already) me and my other friend were pissed off at her, so again we had to stay 1 more night at the guy's house bc we had no pamasahe which was so embarrassing btw, and the fact that she had no shame around the guy's parents. We ended up leaving the next day.

So back we're back at home and she asked us two if we wanted to play at the internet cafe after school, me and my other friends agreed, so we were there at the internet cafe which I thought we were joking around bc she was teasing me, and I asked her what ""uhugin"" means she said ""sipunin"" and i said ""oh like you"" she got pissed off and went silent then like an hour after the silence she suddenly walked out which our other friend was supposed to go to her house so i said u should just come over to mine, on our way home i asked her ""don't you get annoyed at her sometimes"" and that's where it started we were ranting to each other about the things she did that annoyed us etc. The next day i asked her to comeover again bc i needed help with my notes and i didn't ask amber because i cant get anything done when shse's in the room, so anyways i only invited the other friend, i posted on facebook because i didn't have data i was asking my friend where she was because i was waiting for her (i was otw home when i posted that) so ofc amber saw the post and she asked my friend which was coming over if she was still included in our circle of friends which she didn't respond to. Then that night that we were doing notes we were also drinking and all of the sudden she made a gc of just us 3 saying all kinds of bs + sinusumbatan niya kami sa lahat ng ginawa niya daw and lahat ng nilibre nya kesho parang wala lang daw siya samin. Then we decided to just end the friendship right then and there bc we were tired of her bs.

So that's where i thought the beef was over, we apologized to each other, i apologized for the rumors i said and the shit i used to call her. I mean she did apologize naman pero i don't feel like it's sincere, so anyways i thought the beef ended there, i returned the things she needed, and other stuff. SPOILER ALERT, it didn't end there, she was still bothering me for a couple of months which did take a toll on my mental health, but i did try to make an effort to understand her but my friends were stopping me for doing so bc she's just manipulating me and honestly that became an eye awakening moment for me because i didn't realize that she was just manipulating and gaslighting me through out the breaking contact thing. And honestly, I don't have the energy anymore to prove that she's the one in the wrong. I have screenshots and everything tbh, but I choose not to show that to everyone, only close friends.

Back to present, it happened last night where i was joking around a mutual friend of me and amber, he replied to my story saying ""ain't no way you're broken again gang you're a bop"" and i said JOKINGLY ""well hell at least I'm not pregnant"" (which amber told me she was but it turns out to be completely bs because i talked to her ex bf and he told me it was just her bullshit so he could stay) anyway he told me that we should face each other blablabla and i jokingly said yeah, that's where he tags me on a story of amber mocking me calling me names and such, and i responded with ""at least i know proper hygiene"", ""at least i have a family that loves me"" ""at least i don't go for my friend's ex's"" like weak insults and she took it srsly, now threatening me with blotter? And police like girl, what's the police gon do

P.S.; I'm too lazy to complete the story bc it's so long",0,1747719613.0,AITAH,2,0.4,False

I read AITAH all the time, but I've never written a formal reddit post before, so I'm sorry if it's not up to code. But this story is too insane not to share.

Okay, so I (31F) am married to my ex's (M32) dad (M56). It was completely unintentional, but now it's created a shit-storm of problems and now I feel like I'm living in the Twilight Zone.

So my ex, who lets call Dan, and I had known each other since college. We met as Freshman but didn't start dating until our Junior year, though we definitely had crushes on each other. He had a girlfriend at the time and I was just trying to get through my degree, which was pretty high demand attention-wise (not specifying our degrees or jobs because I am not risking anyone finding this post). But after Dan broke up with his girlfriend, he started pursuing me.

My original goal was to stay out of relationships until after graduation due to trying to focus on my 4.0 GPA and surviving the demands of my degree, but Dan wore me down so we started dating. It was tricky balancing school and relationship life, but Dan promised it'd all be worth it. Shortly after graduation, Dan proposed. He suggested it would be smartest for both of us insurance wise and financially to get married. I couldn't really fault his logic, so we had a pretty standard courthouse wedding and decided to boycott a honey moon to focus on a house.

Now, let me specify something. From the start, Dan never had a relationship with his dad. I'm a very family orientated person. I was fortunate enough to grow up in a relatively normal and supportive household, with two parents who worked and being an only child. Dan's parents divorced when he was younger and his dad left the picture pretty early on, so Dan's mom didn't keep pictures of him or refer much to him. It was a pretty sensitive topic for Dan, so I avoided asking questions.

I say this to make it clear: my eventual marriage to his dad, which you're all here for, I only knew his first name (a very generic first name) and a vague idea of what he looked like based on very old pictures).

In regards to my marriage with Dan, it wasn't particularly lovable. It was pretty much a marriage of convenience, but I did care about him. But that being said, I am very career orientated, so I put a lot of my time and energy into my work. Dan had a job that let him work from home, so I handled a lot of the bread winning while he handled the housework. It seemed like a fair trade for the both of us, but not long into my marriage Dan started pressuring me to loosen my work load and focus more on us as a couple. I considered it, until he started pressuring me into kids.

I made it very clear early on in our relationship I had zero interest in kids. I love my job, I love my career I worked hard for, and I didn't want to add kids into it.

I saw the writing on the wall and divorced Dan after some failed couple therapy (which I made him go to with me). Dan did not want to get divorced, insisting on the practicalities of marriage (i.e., insurance and financial support), but I made it clear that my values weren't so easily compromised.

Anyway, two years ago I met my now husband, who we will call Brian. I'd gone to a dinner party hosted by my boss and Brian (his friend) was there. We hit it off due to us having similar tattoos based on a piece of fandom we both enjoy and spent hours talking. Brian was nothing but a complete and total gentleman and even offered to walk me to car my after dinner, due to me being parked on a busy street. We traded numbers and went out to coffee a few days later, which soon became weekly coffee dates. It didn't take long before we were officially dating.

After we started to get serious, I made my opinions on kids very well known, and Brian was very understanding. He admitted that he had a son, but hadn't spoken to him in years due to a messy divorce and his son not wanting a relationship. I was sympathetic. I even talked about how my ex had a conflicted relationship with his dad, so I understood (oh the irony).

Anyway, a year ago me and Brian got married, and we're happy as can be. We're both workaholics yet somehow manage to balance each other out. Our jobs are pretty similar and our schedules align nicely to each other, meaning we keep busy not just in our fields but also with each other at home. It's a great balance.

Back in December, Brian and I watched Elf together as part of our Christmas ritual. I noticed that Brian seemed a little sad after and I checked up on him. He explained that he was thinking about his son, how he'd be in his 30s by now and was feeling guilty about how badly things had ended between them. Brian told me that his therapist had suggested reaching out to his son, but Brian didn't want to do so without consulting me first. I told Brian I supported him and offered to help him however I could.

With my consent, Brian reached out to his son. I talked Brian through some ice breakers, but otherwise left him to say what he needed to say. As Lady Luck would have it, dear Dan was in our state on a business trip, so Brian suggested they meet up. I setup and made arrangements for us to meet at a park (nice neutral territory and not too public, in case things got awkward...oh, boy, my foresight was great).

We get to the park and there he is, the man Dan. I felt like my jaw had unhinged and hit the ground, and then my brain felt like the atomic bomb in Oppenheimer - the big boom and deafening noise. Brian didn't notice and went to go hug Dan, but Dan was staring at me like I was the atomic bomb.

Brian, clueless, was just talking about how happy he was that we'd arranged this and how thrilled he was to rebuild a relationship and introduce Dan to me. Eventually Brian caught on that we were both absolutely silent. He asked what was wrong, and Dan points a finger at me and says, so loud that it startled some people playing on the park close by, ""You married my wife!""

My poor husband was so startled and confused, but all I could do was point back at Brian and yell back, ""Ex-wife!"" I wish I could say I said something more clever, but honestly I was so taken aback, and felt like an idiot. All those times I thought to myself, 'I need to help Brian connect to his son so we can avoid another daddy issue case like Dan,' and the universe came back laughing at me.

I'm extremely thankful that Brian somehow managed to stay level-headed. He suggested that I exit the situation so he could talk to Dan alone, which I gladly did. He gave me the car keys and I just fled the scene as fast as I could. I literally ran. As I was running, I could hear Dan and Brian fighting.

A few hours later, Brian called me and told me I could come get him. By the time I got back to the park, I could tell Brian had been crying. He promised he'd talk to me about it later. When we got home, he took a shower and I was trying to keep it together. Brian eventually came back out and admitted he wished he hadn't reconnected with Dan. He also said it's weird for him knowing that I used to be married to Dan, which I could sympathize with. I tried explaining that my relationship with Dan was more like a professional arrangement and that I love Brian for real, that he's my soul mate, and I'm sorry things are awkward now.

Brian has asked for space and is staying at his brother's house for a few days so he can sort out his feelings and also figure out what to do about Dan.

That was about three days ago and Brian still hasn't come home. We text periodically checking in with each other, but Brian hasn't specified when he's planning on coming back. I'm taking some sick days so I can take care of myself, too. But now I'm worried I've mucked up my marriage.

1kqxbdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_WorldAwayTweedy/comments/1kqxbdv/grim_part_three/,Grim - Part Three,"*Liz*—not seeming evergreen anymore. Looking quite small. Looking pathetic.

She dies in the middle of the road after getting hit by a car. *That’s her life.*

And then, I reach for her arm. I stop. I move behind her. I complete the motion. She comes alive. 

“Wh-what’s… wait—what’s happening, why is—” 

I place my other hand on the back of her other arm. She tries to move—tries to look behind. 

“Why is there a car, what is this, why did everything—”

Softly, I pull her back, feeling something grave in me shift as I do.

She’s panicking. “I don’t understand, I don’t understand what’s happening, *am I dying—*”

I pull, drag her more and more. Small inches. Inches that feel like lightyears, Knowing full well this isn’t what the universe had planned for her—

“Whoever the fuck, is holding me, please fucking—*say something—please*—”

*You’re alright, Liz. You’re okay.* 

I step onto the curb. Bring her up with me.

*An anomaly.* One she has most certainly experienced in spades now—and one that many others will too once this all resumes. But every small step matters: just enough that it can somehow seem like a shared mental glitch—not so much that it’s pure magic. 

She’s at the edge of the sidewalk, upright, now. 

“What—”

I let go of her. 

The car will move forward, with nothing but empty road ahead.

And Liz will be on the sidewalk. And she’ll live. 

And I—well—I’ll just have to figure out the rest.

I walk over to roughly where I was when time first stopped. A quieter section of sidewalk in the downtown rush. I really hadn’t been thinking.

I pull out my notebook. *The world feels off. My insides feel off.* I’ve crossed a threshold—no ifs, ands, or buts about it. Pen between my thumb and fingers.

I drag the line across her name. ~~Elizabeth Trema~~ine

*Just a small magic trick.*

I reach the end, expecting an explosion of sound and vision and movement and relief and fear of what’s to come, but only the last on that list floods through. The world stays as it is.

I cross her name out again. And again. And again. *Nothing.* Panic, now. 

*Do I have to kill her? Is there really no other way?*

All decorum and professionalism I had from the jump when first considering the balance between my occupation and my *friend at my fake job* is now scrambled. I can’t undo it. I just can’t now. 

I take in the edited scene. Liz where shouldn’t be—in the kindest interpretation of those words. Feet from death. 

I think about *when* her new death will be, if I’m actually able to find a way out of this.

Or, maybe, if she’ll just stay a footnote in the world forever now. An outlier. *Headphones in at the end of it all.* 

And tacky as it sounds, that strange thought makes me feel a strange *something* other than the usual misery I’ve been told to share. 

I think about what to do next. My brain comes up short of anything resembling a clean, seamless way out. Outliers only lead to aberrations. 

In what is likely a hopeless interlude between now and an even more painful goodbye, I make my choice of aberration. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I climb the hospital stairwell. 

**5:40 PM - Emily Ellsworth - Greenridge Memorial Hospital** \- **Critical Care Unit** 

I have two names left to send off for today. Emily is neither of them. 

In fact, her departure date is tomorrow.

This isn’t a completely thoughtless approach, as steps disappear beneath me. The stilted world, in fact, gave me opportune time to do some mental math. 

I shift into the hallway. I walk down.

It’s quite likely that this exploration won’t achieve anything of worth, but nonetheless, my rationale for choosing *Emily* works as so:

I want to limit as many changes as possible. I’ve obviously broached something I wasn't meant to broach, and pulling forward everyone else’s times of death—*in this hail mary attempt*—won’t be tenable. *Something* would go wrong. *Something* would happen. More importantly, not everyone dies in their homes or in hospital beds. Some folks—just like Liz’s recently eluded death—die in random places. I couldn’t risk not being able to find someone.

*So*—hospital. Hospital in the critical care unit, most likely means that where Emily is *tomorrow,* she will be today. The ‘aberration of choice’ will be just one death pulled forward. 

And of course, tomorrow—if there is ever a tomorrow I get to experience again—I’ll cross that next bridge. At the time of the already dead Emily Ellsworth’s murder, I’ll find the next, best logical death to pull forward from the notebook. And so on and so forth. 

I reach her room. 

I enter. 

Her eyes aren’t closed—they’re half open. The weak old lady is lying on the bed.

I hesitate for a second—*what the fuck am I doing?*—then grab her arm.  

She turns to me. No springing to life or anything like that—just a neutral shift.

“I’m sorry,” she says, half-laughing. “I didn’t see you come in. I-I-I I must’ve zoned out.”

I hold on tight. I feel like the devil. “Emily,” I say. “I think it’s time.”

Her face wears confusion. “I don’t know what you mean.”

“I’m here to help you cross over… to the next life. I’m the being, the entity, who’s meant to help with the transition.”

Shock turns to receiving turns to denial turns to resignation. “I—I thought I’d have more time, there was—they said I was stable.” She tries to gesticulate but her motion is limited. “They said it was looking okay. They—Sophia and Matt, they’re in the waiting room—my… my son and daughter—they stepped out to get coffee.”

*I don’t know what I’m supposed to say.* “I’m… really sorry. In a world where you might’ve had more time, it wouldn’t have been too much more. *Something would’ve gone wrong.*”

She just doesn’t believe me. She looks restless.

“I’m sorry,” I say again. “Really, *I am sorry*.” 

I think about my bullshit script. *Cosmic reasoning. Holding the door open.* I continue. “The only consolation I can think of right now, is that *you have a soul,* and it’s being shepherded *somewhere*, which might just mean there’s something to all this. But that’s… the best I can do.”

And then, *so much time* before her next words. “I’ve been lucky,” she says. “Through it all, I’ve been lucky.”

And even more time after those, until she finally says the line that grants me an undeserved escape from my cowardice: “I think I can do it. I think I’m ready… *I’m ready to go.*” 

“I release you,” I say.

And I see her life, and indeed in a lot of ways it *had* been a lucky one, albeit one with a strange ending.

And the whole bizarre experience is distracting enough that when I hear the sound of the machine flatlining and the rest of the world unpause, I’m left in shock. 

Then, acting quickly—*I’m in a stranger’s room while she’s alone in her hospital bed, now suddenly dead*—I rush out. Right back into the hall. To the stairwell at the end. Down the stairwell. Down, down, down, down. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It worked. 

The system of death and deliverance I’ve spent so much time with, as it turns out, has rips in the stitching. Gaps in its logic. A *loophole*: removing a soul (seemingly any in my jurisdiction) and *striking a line through the name for whom time had frozen in the first place*, means that the world can truck along, even if that destined name is never sent away.

Obviously, if I could replay the events of today over again, I would’ve sent Emily’s soul away *first,* before putting a pen through Liz’s name—how disastrous it would’ve all been if someone had spotted me in that room.

But the greater learning is this: whatever this whole universal system of *grim reaping* is that I’m a painful and murderous cog in, there is a tracking. *A tracking of souls.* A weight to souls, and the chance for ‘reaper error’ at the very lowest level of it.

And maybe, just maybe, that small, simple error can fall to the wayside—get lost in the sea of all of the happenings.

I sit on the sofa at home. No TV on, but the door to my balcony is wide open, and the moving world—the world in motion—progresses beside me. I breathe. I avoid sending a message to Liz, the fear that any text would cause a *new* accidental death for her, still looming.

I feel as if I’ve gotten away with ‘not murder’, a top-line offense for someone with my job. Then the uncomfortable thought appears next that a spotlight from the heavens will shine down to illuminate me and me alone in my home, and *they*—whoever *they* might be—would get me.

“*That’s him*,” they’d say. “*There’s the one who doesn’t respect death!*”

And to them, I’d say back: “I *do* respect it! And fear it so much for everyone around me that I had to cheat it, *just once*, to see.”

And I truly feel the weight and power of those words for an eighteenth of a second before remembering that it’s just a movie scene playing out in my head, and that real life in the earthly plane is always just a bit more grounded, strange, and really, absurd.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It’s tomorrow at 9:30 AM and I’m sitting at my desk and again it’s the me & Richie show with Liz nowhere to be seen.

She’s usually always early. And the intrusive thoughts are storming in now—*I should’ve rushed back to Pemberton and Willow, I should’ve followed up with her, I should’ve pulled her back further.*

But the second a random distraction hits me—a notification on my computer—unwatching that pot to let it boil—she strolls in.

*Her.* In the flesh. In three dimensions. Soul, seemingly, intact.

And I try my best not to stare. My best not to fret and show that I know—*and was there for it, really*—that she had encountered something markedly supernatural. My quick side-long glance and smile, “*Hey, morning*,” is met with a weaker-than-usual “*morning*,” from her side, and a certain *something* in the depths of her eyes I can’t exactly place—something very off—in the brief moment we share eye contact before she sits down, plugs in, and settles at the monitor ahead of her.  

And the rest of those first two hours in the room are made up of me scrolling the news, reading spam emails, flipping my pocketbook open and doing some quick mental math—*the time for Emily’s (already deceased) death is fast approaching—what is the next, logical death, to pull forward?*

And finally, Liz lifts herself from her seat.

“Gonna grab some stuff from the kitchen,” she says, rather quickly, in stark betrayal to her usual self. Not leaving any room for response.

“I’m good,” says Richie, lazily answering a phantom question out of habit.

She leaves. I wait a few seconds, then follow the same path—with speedier steps—until I’m beside her in the hall. 

“God, my eyes are hurting from the screen,” I say. *Bad actor.*

She doesn’t respond.

“Hey! How was your personal day?”

“It was good,” she says, rather terse.

“Cool. Cool. Do anything interesting?”

The kitchenette comes into view. She shrugs, barely enunciates the words, “not really.”

We arrive. I fill the kettle, click it on, and drop a chamomile tea bag into a mug. She grabs a Lay’s Barbecue and a Coke Zero—sans joke, perhaps one retired—and I snag a Lindt square from the snack drawer—thinking I’ll leave it on her desk as a callback. Sitcoms have callbacks, after all. 

But then we return to the room and the thought seems rather silly, so I don’t.

And for the rest of the day, we all work in silence. Even Ritchie. Time stops a few times, and I send Mateo Navarro and Deborah Levine off to the unknown, and as a soul stand-in for Emily’s now-orphaned death slot, I pull up Jasmine Guo’s hospital death from tomorrow. It goes about as awkwardly as the other frontloaded death did. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The domino effect caused by saving Liz is equal parts manageable and miserable. 

The “job” itself has always been tough, but I now have the silver lining of a life that could’ve left young now being left alone. The following chain of adjusted deaths is so far *interesting.* It seems that at least some folks have an innate sixth-sense of the three or twelve or eighteen hours of life they’re being cheated from. Other advanced send-offs have been indistinguishable from the norm. *Uncomfortable still*, but indistinguishable. 

*But*, it seems my world has settled. Just a little bit. The outlier wasn’t logged. And my updated math—shifting names forward, remembering ones already gone—while still messy, is becoming routine.

And now, a new pang of grief hits me. I continue the work as-is, but I realize that whatever stretch of life Liz has now, it exists only because she **was** friends with a grim reaper. *Kind* to a grim reaper. 

So the odd intrusive thought appears every now and then: to skip another death, and see what would happen. I try not to flirt with the idea. I do what I need to do.

“I release you.”

“I release you.”

“I release you.”

I say it all over the city, next to hospital beds, cars, sidewalks, living rooms, restaurants, bathrooms. Exits are sometimes storybook, often not. Mainly just… random… chaos.

Structure, but really, *no structure.*

Just… *what is.* 

Seeing Colleen Miller’s body frozen mid-fall—slanted downward, suspended diagonally above the steps, her head about to crack against the hardwood floor—I feel that same sting. She’s young but not absurdly so—late 30s’, maybe early 40s. I’ve sent people away with far fewer years to their names. 

I’m not sure, as I absorb her final moment, what’s causing me to stall. If my latent feelings are coming to a head because I realize I have some say in all of this, or if all of these killings have been a slow erosion and she’s the lucky winner to manifest before me just as the straw breaks the proverbial camel’s back.

Her expression—*fear.* She knows. She understands momentum. *This is going to be bad.*

I feel pity. Pity at just how *random* this is. Pity at how *pathetic* this is. *This*—*this is how it ends for her*. Maybe she’s someone who’s fought her whole life not to be a joke, and now the period to close out her sentence very much is that: *sad, brutal, avoidable.* A fucked up punchline. 

*Her head above ground.*

I take a moment to feel the way I feel about her. 

And I have nine pages of foresight of upcoming deaths in my area to leverage, if needed.

And I wonder what it would be like—what kind of moment this would be—if her life didn’t belong to planet earth, but instead took place in the kind of home that had a studio audience.

And then I move behind her, lean forward on the steps, my hands under her arms—I hear the tail end of her scream segue into “*what is happening, what the fuck’s—*” and I pull her up and up until the fall unwinds—her balance restored just enough, feet finding the step, head no longer aimed at the floor. 

And I detach, her words I was tuning out anyways—gone. She’s upright. A corrected statue. Closer to softly falling back onto the steps than slamming forward.

I secure my notebook. I scan it. Lots of notes already added in. New, messy, unlucky work to do.

And I think—*who am I, unreliable, flawed narrator as I am*—to imbue my belief structures and personal sympathies onto the world in the form of intervention?

Well, *I’m the person with the job.*

Maybe I’ll miss a few broken toys on the conveyor belt. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I head over to Liz’s after her third day of calling in sick.

I buzz her unit from the callbox outside the building. It rings. She answers. 

“Hello?” she asks.

“Hi,” I say. “It’s Ted.” Then—“With care package?”

Silence.

“I’ll be quick?” I say again.

“I’ll buzz you up,” she says.

And then I hear the click, the door unlocks, I go up to the fourth floor, and to unit 405.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I place the jumbo-sized Spicy Ruffles bag on her countertop. “I know these are your jam, but maybe you don’t have this flavor.” I place the pack of Starbucks Vanilla Latte sachets. “Starbucks vanilla drink.” The small box of strawberries. “Strawberries.” I place the chocolates. “Self-explanatory, *I mean these all kind of are*.” 

And that’s the bag.

“Thanks. You dork.” 

“Are you okay?” I ask. “I know I’m stealing your playbook here, but you seemed…”

“Off.”

“And now you’re—”

“Off. Work.”

And then silence.

“I just had kind of a weird thing happen,” she says. She thinks. “Yeah, I mean, fuck it—I… almost got hit by a car? Like—*really* almost.”

“*Oh shit,*” I say, trying my best to look shocked.

“And, I’m stressing, when I say *almost,* I mean—*almost. Super almost.*”

“Super almost, I mean that’s crazy—”

“Like… *I was in the way*, it was—” and then I catch that look in her eye again, that flicker as if she’s wondering how much she can actually share, “I don’t know. It felt close” She thinks, can’t seem to hold it in, “Like it was quantum immortality or something, when you’re hauled from one life to another when a disaster happens, and you get to live, just like—” she struggles, “*close.*” 

“I don’t even know what to say. How are you holding up?”

She shrugs. “I’m not sure. I mean, I’m kind of just taking stock of everything now. Like, if things *did* end there, would *I* have been happy with my life?”

She lets the question hold in the air. “I mean, would you have?” I ask. 

“I’m not sure? And I don’t feel like ‘*I’m not sure*’ is a great answer to that, so like, yeah—I’ve been dealing. *And* taking stock. *And* maybe this is a little bit insane, but, kind of riding that whole Marie Kondo thing again. Like I’m *reorganizing* my whole life.” Then—“I dumped my boyfriend.”

“What?”

“*Yeah.* And I’m considering quitting—”

*Please don’t quit.* “Let’s just hold for a sec—”

“Why?” she says, a brazen look in her eyes. “I haven’t once properly thought about mortality before. But it’s literally all we should be thinking about. 24/7.”

*If only you knew my life.* “Do you… maybe want me to, I don’t know, sit with you? In your misery? You can share five to ten minutes of your—”

“I only brought that up to that day because you had resting sad face central going on. My vibe is way more uptempo—” she smiles, “but *aww* at you trying to do the thing I was doing.”

“Thanks?”

“But also, situational awareness, Teddington.” She places her hand on my shoulder. “You can’t just copy other things all the time. Moments have like—*context*—to them.” 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I arrive at the scene where Mr. and Mrs. Green are meant to die. *Car accident.*

A four-way intersection. The Greens’ car rolled forward—likely by mistake, sightline blocked by a large bush near one of the houses—and the oncoming vehicle, poised to T-bone them, stalled just centimeters away. All parties bracing for impact. 

And I’ve gotten the hang of it. What I call my *small deviations.* The slightest bit of rope I’ve been afforded to make a positive dent in things.

I first try the driver’s side door of Greens’ car. *Locked.* I check the others—rear, passenger—all locked too. *Damnit.* 

I turn my attention to the other car. Just the driver inside. I try passenger side. It opens. 

I scoot in, past the passenger seat, settle beside the driver while doing my best not to wake him. His foot’s hovering near the brake. Car’s still in drive. 

I glance back—open road. Shift into reverse. Straighten the wheel. Gently press the gas myself. The car rolls back, slow and quiet, just a few feet. I undo the shift. 

Then—brake. I firmly guide his foot down onto it, \*hearing the very beginnings of his reaction—\*and then detach. No chances. 

I step out, close the door behind me, and take in my updated scene direction.

Then I head off and steal two days from Samuel Givens’s life and two-and-a-half days from Helen Wong’s, and then return two blocks away from the intersection where the Greens are supposed to eat it, pull out my notebook, cross out their names, and watch the edited scene play out.

No casualties, this time. What seems to be a moment of confusion from the incoming driver—clocking the rollback, most likely—but it fades fast. The Greens continue on, as does the other driver, unaware that their lives have changed in ways they’ll never imagine. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Back at work, I scan my notebook—notes and scribbles now scattered all over the first ten pages. I try to stay on top of the changes—the rube-goldberg I’ve set in place—to ensure it doesn’t fall out of hand into something unsustainable. *Borrowed future deaths over borrowed future deaths—*

And Liz is listening to The Strokes.

“*Well I saw your face, then I heard that song, it was so inviting, it hurt my bones,*” she sings. I asked her earlier today what it was, after her third hour of looping it. “Red Light,” she’d said, off *First Impressions of Earth.* She said it was their most underrated album and that she’d be more vocal defending it now if the conversation ever came up. 

No stone unturned in her new life revenge tour, clearly.

“We all doing the Christmas party?” Richie chimes. He points at me. “Christmas party?” I nod. “Christmas party?” to Liz. She’s plugged in. He snaps his fingers, then claps, then begrudgingly pokes her. “Christmas party?” he asks, finally getting her attention.

“Yes,” she says. 

Later, we all go to the kitchen together. It’s still all a bit surreal.

*Liz,* three-dimensional, joking with random people from other departments. Strategizing snacks with Richie—

“If I get a bag of Cheetos, will you split them?” Liz.

“*Yes*, but not split. But I will have some.” Richie.

“I’m not gonna get them unless you split.” Liz.

“But I’m already getting Miss Vickies—so that’s like, too many chips.” Richie.

“Then don’t get the Miss Vickies?” Liz.

“But they never have Miss Vickies so that just feels like a waste.” Richie.

And as I watch them, I wonder—*how isn’t she supposed to be alive? How isn’t this supposed to be happening?* And more importantly—what’s her new charted path now, monotony and all? 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Time has stopped and I’m back at Cedar Valley Pediatric Hospital. 

Usually, hospital bed deaths are the currency I use to fund my interventions—now up to thirteen lives saved. This is one of those—one I could’ve frontloaded two, three days ago. But of course, the circumstances of this one are a little different. 

I step into the room where the little boy with the glowing body is. *Weak. Tired.* Family all around him, also looking weak. Tired. 

There’s a lot I still don’t understand about the parameters to all of this. *Accidents* I understand: take away or reorient the situational cause of death, replace the soul meant to pass with a different one to keep the balance, and things seem to work out. But him—*this boy*—someone most likely dealing with a longstanding illness… *what would happen if I didn’t send him away?*

I examine his colored blanket, the faces of the people who love him, the depression of the moment, and I think—*I’m not sure.* But certainly, if any situation deserves a ‘small deviation\*\*’,\*\* his does. *Him*—dealt the most unfair spin of the roulette wheel.

But I’m running out of opportunities to intervene. The tools I have left—predictable upcoming deaths I can send off early—drying up. Most names next to hospitals and home addresses in my notebook already have a scribble beside them to denote utilization.

Still—if there’s a chance I can somehow make a miracle for him, it’s worth swinging for. 

I leave the room. Leave the hospital. Resign to cut a life eight days short. Still some options left.

Outside, there’s a man in a suit, halted in the motion of smoking his cigarette. And this time, at this specific occasion, I don’t feel tempted to steal his. Nor do I feel the need to make snow angels for three unticking hours or think about skyscrapers. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I’m at Liz’s again. 

Our exchanges of light emotional vulnerability, paired with care packages, *paired with* Liz’s near death experience (and the omitted part where she probably assumes it was a ghost, but really was me, dragging her away from death) have put us in this weird spot where we sort of, kind of, hang out now.

This time, it’s a movie. One she keeps pausing over and over again to talk about something else in her life. One of the *Paddington* movies. Not sure which one. She keeps saying they’re critically acclaimed to help justify us watching, despite the fact that I never gave any inclination of hesitation or disinterest. 

I’m, generally, pretty easy. 

It’s been paused for about eleven minutes now. She’s working her way through a new non-sequitur:

“And that’s the problem,” she says, “Like I could quit. And *really* go for it. But like, just realistically speaking, freelance is going to have its own suite of problems—”

“Right,” I say. “And I’m assuming you can’t just—”

“I know what you’re gonna say. Try it on the side, keep the day job. *Fine,* in a sense, but that still just feels like more holding pattern. And meanwhile people are actually out there, doing what they want to do.” 

“Yeah. I hear you.” *I’ve been told this is what you say when you don’t know what to say.*

“It’s just—”

It’s never surprising to me to see time stop. It’s a very normal occurrence in my life. But as she freezes mid-sentence, it throws me a little. 

I pull out the notebook. *Is there a scheduled death for right now?* I look—nothing until 9:30 PM.

My eyes shift to the clock—7:12 PM.

*What’s happening?*

Instinctively, I try to get her to talk again. “Liz…” I say, now noticing her body shimmer for just a second. I reach for her—

“Ted.” 

She’s staring right at me now, snapping her fingers in front of my face.

“Woah,” I say.

“Since when you were holding that?” she asks.

“Holding…?” I look down, realizing she’s motioning to the notebook. “Oh. Not that long?”

She shoots me a confused look.

“Day planner,” I say, trying to clarify. I stash it away.

I try to recenter myself at the mental lapse I just had. I see that look flicker in her eyes again, but it subsides.

Finally, she continues—

“I don’t know, I just don’t wanna—waste the time, right?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

At home, at night, with the midnight outside, I take a good hard look at the pocketbook.

I write the following word on the eleventh page: *recalibrate.*

To whatever degree possible, the regimen needs to be reset. I’ve done well. I’ve interfered. My mini-project to curb the inherent fucked up structure of the universe can come to a close. I can try to leave well enough alone now. 

After all, I have no more names to pull from. Everyone else remaining on pages two and onwards—who hasn’t already been tapped—is somewhere I can’t find them until they die. Random buildings, random places—the idea of researching their names to reverse-engineer where they are day-to-day feeling like a bridge too far.

But really, the unpredictable halting of time at Liz’s is what’s actually shaken me.

I turn on the TV, balcony door open, and again enjoy the progression of *moving time* with the Golden Girls.

Feeling proud, feeling stilted. Feeling like it’ll all stop at a moment’s notice.

But the show goes on. And the audience laughs. And they *aww*. And they laugh some more.

1kqxbce,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReadingswithCanopy/comments/1kqxbce/my_review/,My review,"I decided to delete my previous review and write a new one after my second reading because I feel that just repeatedly talking about how my mind was blown is highly inadequate.

  
A little background is that I have been deeply entrenched in spirituality for a long time, as the nature of the reality and the human potential has always fascinated me ever since I was little. I have been highly interested in and  dabbled in things like remote viewing, various forms of meditation including hemi-sync, esp training, psychedelics, etc. I used to attend a local spiritual center's meditation weekly where the people that ran the place would give mini-readings at the end of each meditation. I have also received more personal and in-depth readings from them and from some others, including my friend that I trust. 

All that is to say that I am somewhat familiar with what a reading is and I am also aware of the skepticism about it.  

I was not initially looking to get a reading from her. One of her posts of the coffee cups randomly popped up on my feed and I clicked on it out of curiosity and I was like what the heck, let me ask this question about an issue that I have in my life. 

The reason why my first review was me repeatedly saying that my mind was blown was because my mind was blown. I actually paused listening to her reading to tell her that my mind was blown. It is so hard to describe because I feel like to say that she was so accurate, precise, and insightful is just not enough. Aside from being accurate, everything she said was so right. The things that were said, were the things that I had known, but after listening to her, I truly knew and understood. My mind was blown, and it is still blown. 

I immediately asked for a second reading for another major issue in my life, and for the lack of better expression, my mind was blown even more. It is so weird when it's almost like a stranger knows me even better than I know myself. 

Most importantly, she has given me hope to see things through and now I know what I have to do and for that I am truly grateful. 

This is just one of those things you have to experience for yourself. The readings that I have previously received from people that even knew me, were not even remotely as accurate as the ones I received from Canopy. ",2,1747719283.0,ReadingswithCanopy,0,1.0,False

**Why This Pick?** 

With Antonio Senzatela (6.39 ERA) on the mound at Coors Field, this pick is a no-brainer for me, friends. The last team to face the Rockies in Colorado with Senzatela on the mound was the San Diego Padres, and they racked up a staggering 13 runs. I have a sneaking suspicion the Phillies will match if not best San Diego’s double digit total. Tempting as it was to grab the Over on this encounter, I can’t say I’m convinced that the Rockies will get a solid number of runs past Jesus Luzardo (2.00 ERA). If the Over cashes, it will be because Philly does the heavy lifting. For this reason, my money’s on a healthy team total for the visitors.

We need a profiling roaster and the Kaleido M10 dual system seems to be ticking all the boxes. However, we have some concerns about the performance/portability of the profiles to bigger roasters.

Our plan is to use Artisan on it and on our bigger roaster (we still haven’t selected one, but we’re narrowing it down to IRM 15 and CoffeeTool R15), but we don’t know if the uniqueness of the M10 heating system would translate too well with the bigger drum roasters.

We also checked the Aillio R1 V2 and the R2 Pro. The R1 V2 has a good price point, but is it true we shouldn’t do full 1 kilo batches with it? The R2 Pro is just too expensive for us at this time.

Cedar Valley Pediatric Hospital.

I lie down in the park outside the building, looking up at the clouds. They don’t look like anything special. No brilliant shapes telling all sorts of stories. Just clouds. 

I’m disappointed.

Sometimes I wonder what it would feel like to hurl myself off a skyscraper. Nothing would happen, of course, but I’m curious about the sensation. I wonder if it’d be just like a rollercoaster.

I force myself up, force myself into the hospital, find Nate’s room, enter it, and then listen to the surprising amount of wisdom and kindness that seems to exist in spades in kids inflicted with the worst kind of unfairness, and then I send him somewhere that I hope is beautiful, and then I come back down the stairs, to the outside again, to the park again, and steal the cigarette from the fingertips of a businessman on a bench in the stalled cityscape with birds hanging from strings, and then I smoke it and cough my lungs out, then I finish it, then I crush it, then I pull his carton of cigarettes out from his coat pocket, secure a new cigarette, put it between his fingers—*small anomaly, but whatever*—then I realize I could’ve just taken one from his pocket in the first place, and then I walk away, still thinking that skyscraper thought.

It’s a sticky thought, that one. 

*4:58 PM*         

It’s been a long day. 

I arrive at 2941 West Elmwood Drive, and the scene is clear. Martin Foster is already down, collapsed on his side in the middle of his front yard.

In the open doorway—two young girls, confused, a hint of worry on them both.

I breathe temporary life into Martin.

“*Woah,*” he says, “sorry that was, actually, *not quite sure what that was*. Sort of like an insane headache. Can you uh, can you let the girls know I’m alright?” 

*Meet reality where it is.* I let the moment sit. “Martin,” I finally say.

“Oh,” he says, taken aback at the use of his name, “what, do I know you from the neighborhood?” Then—“Help me up.”

His eyes flit around briefly to the rest of the block. The lack of movement, the lack of sound—I read on his face that it’s slowly landing. 

“I can’t really move,” he adds, attempting to pull himself up. 

“Martin,” I say again. “I’m really, really sorry but I think it’s your time to go.” 

He laughs. “What—what’s that supposed to mean exactly?” 

I let the question linger, before speaking. “What it means is that I’m here to—”

“*Wait*,” he says. He lightly shakes his head. “Just—don’t say anything for a sec. I’m gonna… I’m gonna get up first.”

He struggles. His eyes dart. He tries to present confidence but it wavers. Then he looks at me, *really* looks at me in the way that makes me feel less like ‘Ted’ and more like a disgusting aberration. The look that eventually constitutes most of the encounters I have. *Registering.*

I catch the panic creeping in. The breaths getting faster. “What… what’s…”

It takes him a good while to finish the thought.

“What… even happened?”

“I don’t know,” I say. “Sometimes it’s obvious, and I can tell right away. Yours was obviously sudden, which makes me think of a heart attack. But you said headache, so… maybe aneurysm?”

And as expected, despair lands hard on his face. 

“*Huh*,” he says. Silence.

I try to cut through it. “It’s tough. Obviously. And a lot to take in. And this part’s gonna sound even more nonsensical, but there *actually is a cosmic order to*—”

“No. Sorry, I mean, I can’t. *This can’t.* There’s uh—*I’ll explain*. I actually… quit my job a few months ago. Found a new gig. Less stress. Similar money, but less stress. More time with the kids. And we uh,” he laughs, “we finally paid off the mortgage! Which was huge. So it was sort of like, if you can understand—it’s kind of *starting now for me.* There wasn’t really much of a before. Besides working for this. Like, *setting this up.* And working really, really hard.” 

I receive his words. The least I can do. Then—“It’s not going to feel this way, and I don’t have all the answers, but I can tell you honestly that things are playing out this way, because this *really is the best w*—”

“Respectfully man, your script really isn’t working for me.” Then, a flash of shame. “Sorry.”

“No,” I say. “All good. It’s a… fair reaction.”

Quiet inhales and exhales now. *Meditative.* People always get meditative. 

“You have a family,” I say. “That cares about you. A lot of people don’t have that, when they—”

“Can you change it?” he asks. 

“What?”

“Can you change what’s happening to me right now?”

I pause. “No. No I can’t.”

“Like… you *shouldn’t?* Or, actually you can’t?” 

“I can’t,” I say.

“What about a message? Can you give them a message for me?”

“I—also can’t—”

“Just a small one. I can keep it short.”

I hesitate. The way this is tracking, I want it to be over. 

“You’re in front of me, *right now,* as a—person—or entity, whatever you are, and so I mean, *you can give them a message,*” he says. Then, tacking on. “Please.”

“I… can’t,” I say again. “*Meaning*, I’m not supposed to. But.” I take a beat. “What’s your message?” 

He thinks. Sort of desperately now. Like he’s on borrowed time. Like he pressed the buzzer early on Jeopardy. “Just…” he offers a pained smile. “Just tell them that Daddy loves them.” Then—“*And.* And, tell Ellie—she’s the big girl now. She needs to take care of Keira. And they *both—*” he tries to point, “need to take care of mommy. And be patient. *And* brave\*.\* And… and…” he looks around, “That I’ll see them again.”

“Okay.” 

“Say it back to me,” he says. “Then I’ll get out of your hair.”

“You… you want both of them to take care of their mom. And… to know you’ll see them again. And uh, *Ellie*… is the bigger one of the two. She’ll look after Keira.”

“And they need to be patient. And brave,” he adds.

“Right. Patient and brave.” 

“And… are they—I heard them call, before it—before it went black, are they—are they close?”

I look past him. “Yeah,” I say. “They’re standing in the doorway.” Then, to button things up, “They’ll be alright, Martin.”

“I wouldn’t suppose you could—turn me? Help me look at them again?”

“I—” I decide to forgo the long explanation about anomalies in favor of a simpler lie. “I can’t move you. I don’t have that power.”

“Was worth a try,” he says. “Just the message, then.”

“Just the message,” I say.

He sighs. “So what now?”

“Well what happens now is, I send you to whatever’s next. If you’re ready.”

He looks out at the rather unremarkable sight in front of him. “Gotcha.” We share the paused cityscape for a few minutes. *Finally*—

“I’m ready,” he says.

“I release you,” I say.

And like that he’s gone. 

I let go of his arm. Watch the girls for a moment.

Then I walk the ten minutes it takes to reach the nondescript spot—the lonely place I’d stashed my electric scooter. I ride it back to work. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

At my seat, I put a line through his name.

**~~4:58 PM - Martin Foster - 2941 West Elmwood Drive~~**  

And then, everything moves again.

I self-soothe with slow exhales. The taxing day is mostly done. The brilliance of uninterrupted motion is mine for at least another four hours. Two more send-offs before midnight, but both are from hospital beds. *Simple.*

I feel the movement of time. I watch through the window as people make use of their minutes, with steps, conversations, and cigarettes. Minutes these folks all likely take for granted.

And like clockwork, Liz’s music stops—along with her humming—and I hear the clatter of dishes from her desk, the closing of her laptop, the zipping and unzipping of her backpack, and as I wait for today’s permutation of a dorky farewell—

“Ted,” she says. 

I look over. “Hey, are you heading out?”

She lingers. She does this sometimes. 

“What is it?” I ask. 

“You’re uh,” she continues, “you’re…” she taps under her eye.

I feel at my face. *Something pouring out of my eyes.* Huh.

“Are you okay?” she asks. 

“No, yeah, totally fine. Just, uh, had a friend send me a sad video… which I just watched.”

“You were watching a sad video?”

“Yeah. Have you seen *Monster’s Inc.*?”

“...yes.”

“It’s the scene where Sully accidentally scares Boo.”

“Right. And your friend sent you this because they thought it would make you sad?”

“Yes.”

“Uhh, *cool?*” she says. 

I feel like a dork. “Yeah, see ya,” I say, looking back at my computer, hoping the conversation can end.

She makes her way to me. 

“Ted,” she says again.

I look back over. “Yes?”

“Stand up for a second?”

“Sure,” I say. I stand up. “Yeah?”

And then she places her arms around me and holds me for about 2.3 seconds before detaching. 

“I hope you have a good rest of your day,” she says.

And then she leaves, and for a moment I think I understand how Sully felt at the end of *Monster’s Inc*. when he was finally able to see Boo again.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It’s the next day and I’m home. I called in sick. Leaking at work wasn’t optically sound, so I figured it was best to ground myself in Casa Ted. 

Thankfully, today only holds seven send-offs. Reasonably spaced out. Good for recalibration.

I watch *Friends.*

*Friends* is funny. *Friends* makes me feel alright. I wonder for a second which aspect of yesterday winded me the most. Then I stop thinking about it and keep watching *Friends.*

I know people on the internet seem to dislike them, but I’d quite like it if life had a studio audience. with *laughs* and *awws* and sad reactions everytime something sad happens. Perhaps the audience wouldn’t be all that appropriate for the grimness of some of my escapades, but maybe those too could be softened with their help. Maybe it could all be a big joke.

I’ve already done two deliveries today—handled them with the usual mix of detachment, tact, and empathy. 

*No wavering.* Things get mucky when you’re wavering.

I hear a knock at my door.

I clock the time—*12:05 PM*. Weird. I’m not expecting anybody. 

I open the door.

It’s Liz. *Why is Liz here?*   

She has a bag of stuff with her. 

“Hey,” she says. “Just wanted to stop by over lunch. Cool if I drop something off?”

“Yeah. Course.”

We had a short era of carpooling together back when she lived closer to me, so I’m not all that surprised she remembers my address. That said—she hasn’t stopped by in a hot minute.

She steps in, slips off her shoes, and heads to the living room, setting the bag on the coffee table as I follow.

“Just a little care package,” she says, pulling out the first items. “I brought you *granola bars—*”

“*Neat.*”

“Those like, instant flavored coffee things.” She looks at it. “*French Vanilla.*” Then—“They always suck when I make them, but maybe you’ll be better at it than me. Maybe you can *break the cycle!*”

I laugh.

“And uh, just chips and chocolate. Can’t go wrong with those, right? Not super health-forward, but, y’know, *whatever.*”

“Thank you,” I say. 

She pauses. “You gonna be good?” she asks.

“Gonna be good,” I say back.

“And like,” she continues, “I don’t mean to overstep, but like, there are people out there, so if you ever want to talk about your stuff—”

“If you mean like therapists, I think I’ll be okay—”

“I mean they go by other names too. Counselors, *psycho*therapists—”

“Yeesh. You think it’s that bad, huh?”

“Hey, we all have baggage, right?”

I take a second. “My stuff is kind of weird,” I say.

She smiles. “That throws me a bit because you seem super even keel.” She thinks. “But maybe that just means you have a lot of crazy shit going on inside of you.”

“Maybe,” I laugh.

She utilizes open space and air as if she’s a negotiator waiting for the other person to break.

“You ever just feel… like shit?” I finally say. “And there’s no real reason why?” I lie.

“Oh of course,” she says. “I mean, SSRIs are great for that. Not that I should give out mental health advice and all that, but… in case you *do* ever see a psych.”

“Yeah,” I say. “Maybe I should try them.”

“*See someone first,*” she says. “Anyways, I have to run, but—” She sizes me up. “If you ever need to talk, you can hit me up. I can sit in the misery with you for like five—maybe ten—minutes. Help you sublimate some of that sad boy energy.” 

“I’ll uh, yeah I’ll think about it! Thanks for coming by.”

“It *is* an energy,” she says. “Like, misery, so you know—seriously consider sharing it.” And then, as if the line hadn’t landed me on anyways, “like, *you know* when you’re spending time with someone who’s down. It’s like an energetic drain.”

“And you want me to *be that?*”

“Yes!” She points. “*Be* the energetic drain. Get it off your chest.” A laugh. “Make it the world’s problem.”

“Sound advice, thank you.”

“Anytime.”

And for just a moment, I wish she could be there in the suspended world with me just to get a better sense of my unique brand of misery. Just so my dream of an eventual explanation could land better. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The rest of the week was manageable. Back to the regularly scheduled programming of five to eight kills a day, the bulk of them expected conclusions to long-standing illnesses for bed bound humans. The *spacing* between all of these was less than ideal—evenly distributed, meaning no meaningful chunks of moving world—but it *was* the reset button the doctor had ordered. I was back to being a consummate professional with a healthy work life balance. 

Speaking of work, the one sick day was just an outlier. I returned to the—*air quotes*—grind, melancholic routine restored, days of Richie firing off material for the room resuming:

“*My girlfriend asked me if I’d love her if she turned into a worm—and I just feel like I need more details? What kind of worm, exactly? And would I get to become something too?*”

“*Where do you think bears fit into God’s plans for the universe? Assuming, of course, intelligent design is real.”*

And, when squirting at the sunlight through his window, grumbling without any real grasp of the universe’s workings—though, to be fair, who among us does—“*I think the sun’s overrated.*”

All along the way, Liz wouldn’t intrude too much, outside for callouts for us all to walk to the kitchen together as she seemed to believe we traveled best in threes. There were less moments of her doing that thing—*lingering*. Looking at me. Now, at most, it’d be a quick smile, or a quick joke. 

Those quiet moments in-between. 

The rest—fuzz bouncing from her earlobes, courtesy of her favorite French-English avant-pop retro-futurist lounge band. 

And through it all, at intervals, clocks would stop ticking, I’d release strangers to the great beyond, and a swipe of a pen would bring it all back.

And now, I’m home again. Doing that thing that feels like keeping my head above water. Peering into a *truly* structured world on the TV. *Sitcoms.* I blitz through the works of one Mike Schur who Google suggests would be right up my alley. 

I look at the time—*11PM-ish*. I pull out my pocketbook, place it on the armrest, and flip to the second page to do a gut check on tomorrow.

*Five deaths only.* Wow—lovely.

I go to close the book until a pang stalls me. 

I re-read. Something that seemed innocuous at first grows larger and larger, until it overtakes like an avalanche.

**2:42 PM - Elizabeth Tremaine -** **Intersection of Willow and Pemberton.**

I keep reading, hoping the letters will mutate into something unrecognizable.

It’s hard to imagine a world where her name could be so formal. So *printed.*

She was always just *Liz.* Not really a person in my mind, not really anything. *Liz.* In a sense, I just saw her as evergreen. Someone who would still be there, at the end of the universe, when it would all go dark—or light—headphones in, still. Humming, still.

I close the book. I try to sleep—*try* being the operative word. It takes a while, and by the time rest finally hits me, I wake up to a frozen world which I imagine must’ve lingered for quite some time. I leave bed and walk to the house of the man who has fallen and won’t get up. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I look like shit—I’m assuming.

I usually never spend time pontificating on how much I’m just a mirror-image of human beings with a reaper’s soul. I sleep like humans. Eat like humans. Run a pretentious internal monologue—like humans. 

I make it to my desk. *Late.* Later than usual, anyways. Richie–-playing a bizarro world version of himself it seems—is plugged in. Liz is nowhere to be seen.

*Why isn’t she here?*

I twiddle my fingers, play with my notebook, then with the color-coded HR blocks—team archetypes in plastic form that pass for my main fidget toy. I scratch at myself. Pinch the skin. Glance over, nervous, again and again. Finally, Richie’s rather subdued, unassuming meeting—the one where he barely says anything—wraps up. He takes out his earbuds. Sighs. Spots me looking. *Lights up*—almost—but reins it in, like he’s trying to maintain the illusion he isn’t desperate for input and stimuli 24/7. I think, anyways. 

“*Meeting with the VPs,*” he says. “So fucking nerve-wracking. But you can tell they don’t actually care what anyone says so you just spend thirty minutes staring like a jackass while they tell stories.”

I give the obligatory laugh to fill space until I can say the words I actually need to say. “Hey, is Liz out?”

He shrugs. “Dunno, maybe check her calendar?” he says, pulling it up before even finishing the question. “Huh. Yeah. Says she’s out of office. Personal day.”

“Personal day?” I ask.

“Yeah, Ted, we get two. Have you not been using them? You’re aware they’re literally the same as vacation days right?”

“Do you know why she would take it today?”

“No, why would I?” Then—“Hey, you guys aren’t an item, are you? Should I be concerned about this?’

“*What?* No. Doesn’t she have a boyfriend?”

“Indeed she does, but you know that’ll never stop some people. *Hey,* if the warning means anything–-don’t shit where you eat. I know she’s got that whole manic pixie dream girl thing going on, but *manic* is there for a reason. Do you want to know who else was manic? Ted Bundy.”

“*Jesus, Rich.*”

“I’m kidding,” he says. “Also, *don’t shit where you eat* never made sense anyways. What, you’re not supposed to shit *at home? Or at restaurants?* Has no one ever taken a shit at work *after* eating lunch in the break room?”

I get up.

“I have… meetings.”

He calls after me: “Hey, don’t shit where you eat, Ted!”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I wander out from Willow and Pemberton in every direction, stretching the grid mile by mile, thinking about things like premonition, fate, and most importantly, *irony.* 

And rules. So many rules. Rules like—*don’t interfere.* It’ll upset the cosmic tapestry if you interfere. *So don’t interfere.*

The fantasy that I can simply text her and tell her to go somewhere else, and that—*poof!*—that alone will be enough to circumvent her fate and get her name off the list, unfortunately, isn’t landing for me. I’m very ready for the ironic twist that it’s *my text* that will accidentally bring her to this cross-section. *My interference*—informed by want to change the future–-that will canonically bring about her end.

So I just walk. Past people in coffee shops I haven’t seen or cared for before who I know I’ll be sending off one day. People walking, people driving, the overrated sun shining down. 

*Minutes*—precious minutes ticking away. 

She’s my third send-off for the day. The others were marked by *morning* and *early morning.*

*I could just do it, right? And not think about it?*

That’s what I’m supposed to do, what I’ve *had* to do, from the moment I was first born and given my fucked up orientation to now. *Do and move on.* 

*Step, step, step,* pointless block after pointless block, precious time where Liz is still alive on this planet slipping down the hourglass, and suddenly I want—in betrayal to everything I usually feel—time to just stay still. For it all to just stop for a while. 

But it’s already been three hours since I left work, and I’m now only thirty minutes from her departure. 

More steps. To and fro. The world surreal. The world cursed. The world unfixable. 

*Twenty minutes.*

Shoes meet concrete. I stare. My reflection in windows. *My name is Ted.* 

*Thirteen minutes.* 

And now, I’m diligent. Now, I’m looking around. Now, I’m *really* thinking.

*Eight minutes.*

And now I’m restless. And I wish I could see her sooner.

*Three minutes.*

Why won’t she appear?

*One minute.*

Why won’t she fucking appear?

*Thirty seconds.*

And now my imitation heart is all but beating out of my chest. I’m just waiting for it to end. Waiting for the painful conversation. *What will I say? Just how long will I spend with her in suspended time?*

I look around everywhere, nervously, desperately, my placement at the moment it all stops usually being critical to me—anomaly management—but now a complete non-factor. 

*What do I do when I see you?*

And as if that was the magic thought, she appears—stepping out of a shop, slipping past a small crowd, bags in hand, phone out front, eyes flicking to the walk signal. 

And all I do is watch. 

Watch as the crowds seemingly dissolve, and she’s the only person standing at her corner of the intersection—

Watch as the walk signal turns on for her—

Watch as she steps onto the road, eyes lowering to her phone—

Watch as the car speeds to the intersection, unaware or uninterested in the red light—

Watch as it stops right beside her— 

And watch as the picture freezes: the last moment of Liz’s soul on Earth. 

Slowly, *painfully slowly*, I close the distance to her. I stand right in front of her illuminated body. Then shift my eyes to the car that is one goodbye and an ink strikethrough away from bulldozing her. Stare at the woman in the car, who for whatever pointless reason, had forgotten she was traveling in a speeding bullet on wheels beside distracted pedestrians. 

*Back to Liz.* I’ll let her go. But before I do, we’ll talk for hours—days. I’ll sit with her in her misery, in her bargaining, anger, denial, acceptance—in whatever order she wants. 

I look at her face. *Really* look at her face. I think about all the times she’d stop and stare at me. And how pitiful this all was. I look at her bags. Her shopping spree consists of: *a scarf, a 9x12 frame, a box of chocolates, and two books*. I pull out the books.

The first one—*The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.* On sale. 

The second—*A Beginner’s Guide to the Stock Market: Everything You Need to Start Making Money Today.* 

I swallow.

I think I almost died today, or at least it felt like it. 

I’ve been on 60mg Vyvanse generic for a couple weeks and noticed my blood pressure had risen, but otherwise the dose felt right. Regardless, can’t have that so my psych NP prescribed 80mg Propranolol, a beta blocker. I’m familiar with Propranolol because I took it a few years back for migraines so I thought I’d be fine. I was wrong.

Took my Vyvanse this morning and had my cup of coffee(which makes me a fool) and all was good until about noon, I started getting extremely lightheaded and felt cardiac arrhythmias every minute or two, like a pressure inside my chest as if I was about to lose consciousness.

I’m lucky it was my day off and I was just at home, so I could lay down. I stayed there, just freaking out over what’s going on, every time I’d try to get up I felt like I was gonna pass out and throw up all at the same time, not to mention slight difficulty breathing

I decided the best thing to do was lay down, but eventually colors swirled in my vision and I got tingling in my limbs and face, the kind that really sticks. Fortunately my blood pressure cuff was right there so I checked it:

168/124 - A HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS.

I’m an active guy and exercise frequently, and my base unmedicated bp is usually sub 120/80 so I started freaking out even more.

I thought I was a dead man. My symptoms aligned with a heart attack all too much, the chest pain was getting worse, and I’d been sprawled out on my bed for more than an hour at this point. I made three massive mistakes:

1. I drank plenty of coffee that morning
2. I didn’t call 911 as soon as I should have
3. I didn’t even try to control my mental spiraling

So after seeing that I’m in real danger, I dial 911, and as I speak to the operator I realize how shaky and broken up my voice sounds; it freaks me out even more. I get taken to the ER and they told me it looked like a severe panic attack, but due to the duration and cardiac intensity could’ve turned into something much more serious.

I went through a battery of tests and treatments and eventually they just pumped me with more antipsychotics until everything calmed down. I’m not anxious or depressed so I don’t understand what even happened, the hospital staff just told me to readjust my meds asap, and that was that. 

Don’t make the mistake I did, if you experience my symptoms GET HELP, I was *so* lucky it wasn’t a life ending event but that doesn’t mean it won’t be for anyone else. Really reminded me that at any moment it could all be gone. 

I guess I’m sharing because I’m so fucking happy to be alive right now and don’t know who to tell.


TLDR: I ended up in a hypertensive crisis from the side effects of Vyvanse+Propranolol interaction and spiraled into a severe panic attack.

**Boyfriend**



The narrator describes how a weed-induced sleepwalking episode caused him to overhear an argument between a couple in his apartment building.  It's a familiar story to the narrator; the boyfriend, (whom he  knows to be a cheater), is saying he wants ""more space"", and the girlfriend is in tears. He follows their break-up over the week, and each time the boyfriend visits he hears them having sex, which reminds him of his previous girlfriend, Loretta, who left him for an Italian. 



The narrator plucks up the courage to invite the girl in for coffee, her beauty in his apartment makes him feel shabby. The date goes nowhere and afterwards she never acknowledges him, not even with a smile. Weeks later he compliments her on her new short hairstyle, saying it makes her look fierce. She responds with a smile, which was exactly what he wanted.

  


**Edison, New Jersey**

  
  


The narrator talks about his typical work day with his co-worker Wayne, delivering card and pool tables. He enjoys having a poke around the homes of the wealthy when the opportunity arises.  If the customers don't tip, he likes to leave a little surprise in their bathroom.



On the road, Wayne, who is married, talks about his lust for Charlene; he's a serial cheater.  The narrator has no desire to engage in this conversation as he recently broke up with his girlfriend.  He regularly steals money from the showroom and used to blow it all on her.

  


After unsuccessfully trying to deliver a table to a house for a man called Pruitt, a beautiful woman finally answers the door.  The narrator chats to her and she explains that she wants to leave her job and offers to buy a lift to the city.  He notices that Pruitt has a vast quantity of clothes whereas the girl has minimal.  She leaves the clothes behind but takes food instead.



In the car he places his hand in her lap just in case she responds.  He notices [the strong Dominican presence in Washington Heights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQqeNcvHsig).  On his return Wayne asks him how he got on with the girl, to which he lies.  Later he calls Pruitt's number and eventually the girl answers; Wayne says she's probably in love with her employer.  Wayne asks him where they'll be heading off to the next morning.  Usually his guess is correct.



**How to Date a Browngirl, Blackgirl, Whitegirl, or Halfie**



The narrator, who I assume is Yunior, gives us an authoritative lesson on how to date girls of different races.  First you must fake illness to be alone in the apartment, then you must hide the cheese and the family photos.  You choose the place to go out to eat depending on where she lives and her skin colour. These factors will also determine the conversation and how far you go with her.

  


**No Face** 



Ysrael, the boy whose face was severely torn by a pig, is teased and called ""No Face"".  Padre Lou is an exception to the majority who treat him as an outcast, and gives him lessons in reading and writing. Despite being beaten up and ridiculed, he remains strong and determined to fight evil.



**Negocios**



Yunior's father, Ramón de las Casas, has been cheating on his wife, but despite this, he goes to ask his father in law for money to go to the United States.  Abuelo agrees, seeing it as a way to improve his daughter's life. The relationship between Yunior’s parents is tense, and seems quite violent.



Ramón arrives in Florida, and a taxi driver helps him to get started with some good advice.  His first job was washing dishes, then cleaning a train station. He shares an apartment, working long shifts, and is advised that to get on, he will need to learn English. One of his housemates wasn't paying his share, which angered Ramón, and he left to go to New York.  He walked and hitchhiked, hiding from police since his visa has expired.



Securing an apartment and two jobs, he sends money home on no fixed schedule, corresponding with his wife, who forgives him.  He promises her and the children tickets soon.  He begins to look for a woman with U.S. citizenship, to marry and then divorce, paying a man called El General to help him. He meets a Dominican woman with U.S. citizenship, and asks her to teach him English. After a few false starts in their relationship, they marry. He stops sending money back home, Nilda finds out about his family and he is forced to deny that he cares about them.



He meets a Puerto Rican named Jo-Jo who encourages him to start with a hot dog cart. Ramon had bigger business dreams, for his negocio.  Letters from his wife reminded him of their existence, calling him a ""desgraciado"" for abandoning his family.



His other wife, Nilda, gives birth to a son, Ramón, without the usual celebration. He starts to borrow money from her, lying that it's for the funeral of one of his children. Now working a union job with an aluminium company, he is earning good money, though the work is hard and racism is rife.  Although he and Nilda return to visit the island, he never manages to visit his family.



Nilda puts on weight as the children arrive, and Ramón loses interest.  Fighting increases and they spend less and less time together.  A work injury leads to his demotion, and he gradually moves out of his home with Nilda.



Years later, Yunior visits Nilda who tells him the story of how his Papi walked out on her.  She realises what it must have been like for his mother.  The company gives him two weeks holiday, and he flies south to get his family.

1kqx1uc,https://www.reddit.com/r/InCanada/comments/1kqx1uc/reverse_culture_shock_circa_2023/,Reverse Culture Shock circa 2023,"I had been out of the country for over a year at that point, but a lot had happened under the Biden administration that was a combination of poor decisions (typical for any president) and massive internal migrations from the 2020-2022 period.

A tragedy had brought me back home. I had just started working my first job in Canada for only 2 months and some change. The day before Canadian Thanksgiving, my grandfather had passed away. His fourth and final heart attack. My father called me the morning of to inform me of what happened. After an hour of crying, I booked my plane tickets for the next day. I would be there for a week and would stay with my parents. I was going solo, because it would be expensive and we couldn't take the financial hit at the time.

The first step into America, from Canada specifically, starts in Canada itself. TSA is stationed in Canada and you are required to go thru them before being able to enter the US. This special arrangement was made because of 9/11, not that Canada played any role in it. I had to enter the address I was staying at, contact info for where I was staying, and for how long, all into a kiosk machine for the airline I was flying thru. This seemed very intrusive since I was a citizen. The airport had echoes of English and French announcements.

I noticed multiple other people that were speaking to the TSA agents looked nervous. Getting barred from the US for 5 or 10 years is a scary thought for many who want to glimpse it. The TSA agent grabbed my passport and asked where I was going and how long I was staying. I asked why it mattered. She said they are required to ask, but since I'm a citizen, it didn't matter what my answer really was. I still told her the truth. Kansas City. 1 week.

After being given my Disney Fast Pass, I walked to the duty free store and bought some local wine for my dad and a BC specific Starbucks coffee mug for my mom. I waited for my flight at the terminal to get on. Once I boarded, it was off to Seattle in like 1 hour. After landing in Seattle, the shift began.

I could feel a sense of dread and tension return. I lived in Seattle prior to moving to Vancouver, so it wasn't odd to me. However, I forgot the tension in the air that exists among my own people. Probably because I had been surrounded by Canadians for well over a year. The airport speakers spoke English and Spanish. The news on the airport televisions spoke of multiple mass shootings in a single week. People around me looked pissed off.

I had completely forgotten how things were. Since I was gone though, an additional couple of million people had entered the country thru the Southern border, violence was up significantly nationwide, and millions of citizens relocated to different parts of the country for affordability factors. During my airport adventures, I was forced to do a facial scan. This was brand new. The facial scans were then used to identify me for every step of the way to and from. My passport basically became irrelevant.

I find it ironic that so many people in America are anti-China, but then they do the exact same shit China does. At least China doesn't bullshit their population into thinking they are the freest people in the world. America does still have a lot more freedoms than China, but there is a lot more similarities than Americans think.

Upon entering Kansas City, it was the middle of the night, so not many differences. Except, oh yeah, the airport was now enormous. It went from a little airport where you would leave your plane and be only a couple dozen feet from the curb. Now, it was a copy and paste of Seattle's airport design with multiple stories, and a massive amount of walking in order to get anywhere. Everything was upgraded and there was a lot more staff there. It was later explained to me that Kansas City was setting itself up to be the new hub to replace Denver. Makes sense.

Kansas City had been changed from the events of the past couple of years. A lot of migrants had moved to Chicago and Atlanta. The Biden administration force evicted a lot of people on Section 8 housing and out of poorer neighborhoods to house the migrants. With the only other option being homelessness, a lot of people went to cheaper cities they could afford. Kansas City was one of them. I noticed a lot of crips and bloods walking around neighborhoods they never would.

My father told me that a lot of the new residents from out of town, the ones from a gang that is, started gang wars with the local gangs for Kansas City. Violence had a huge uptick in the area as a result of it. The migrants didn't dare to come to Kansas City because both on the Kansas and Missouri half, they would be detained and held until they could be deported. That is the politics of the states.

Inside of bars, facial scans were being implemented to ""ensure no one was using fake IDs"". Bullshit. Just another example of excuses for government overreach. More news of public shootings and everything on TV, including sports related shows, were all discussing politics on some level. Everyone kind of seemed on edge. My family was mainly sad due to grandpa, including myself.

The biggest surprise for me was that Thursday Night Football was on Amazon Prime. That was crazy. This is a monopoly at this point. I personally stopped using Amazon and never really watched football on a regular basis. I would watch it if it is on TV, but I am not going out of my way to watch it.

Everything in the country felt like everyone was in a rush, miserable, and on edge. I spoke with multiple people during my airport trips, plus Kansas City (my family has lived there for about a decade, not originating from there). The news cycle, the tiredness. It was a lot. I felt out of place in my own country. I felt a deep sadness that I didn't fit in anymore, in my own nation. It was a similar feeling to when California (born & raised) didn't feel like home anymore. However, this was on a deeper level.

When I landed back in British Columbia, I felt relieved. It felt like home. Everything was nicer, cleaner, and more. The color scheme of the airport was brighter than the US ones. Even the immigration was cool, but to be fair, land border guards for Canada are dicks. US immigration has been cool with me 95% of the time. Canada was home now. Less than a year from now, I can apply for Canadian citizenship. I look forward to it. A whole new country to call my own.",2,1747718242.0,InCanada,0,1.0,False

1kqx0tf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_WorldAwayTweedy/comments/1kqx0tf/grim_part_one/,Grim - Part One,"I remember it from time to time.

About five years ago, I was born. Born an adult.

Standing in the middle of the road.

In front of me—a house on fire.

And I heard a voice pierce through my head. 

It told me, in excruciating detail, the ‘do’s’ and ‘don’ts’ of my job.

And once it was done speaking, it left me to my devices.

So I walked into the fire, did my job for the first time, then—

I walked out.   

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It’s midday on a Wednesday, and I’m sitting in a moderately cramped office. Richie is doing his stupid Batman voice again. Liz is plugged in. I can hear *Stereolab* through her headphones.

I know it’s Stereolab because she only listens to Stereolab right now. That’s what she tells me. So often that I genuinely think she has memory problems. 

It’s a thing with her. Certain stories, anecdotes, *grudges*—she just can’t quit them. She’ll tell you about them with the kind of delivery that makes it seem like the words are just dawning on her *now.* That all of this is new. 

“Stereolab,” she said, earlier today—and also for the sixth time this month. “I don’t actually think I need other bands anymore.” 

And now I hear it. It crackles, it’s loud as it bounces off her skull. I say a prayer for her ears. She mumbles along, half-singing the lyrics:

“*You go in thaaaat team*

*I go on thiiiiis team*

*Bahbahbahbahhhhhhbah*

*Bahbah or a number”*

Richie tries another impression. It lands on deaf you-know-whats. He *finally* looks over to clock that Liz is plugged in (why the loud music via headphones doesn’t do the trick, I’m not sure). He cranes his neck further, past her desk to mine, to suggest he was actually addressing me. 

It’s usually a fifty-fifty on whether I give him a sympathy chuckle or not. 

This time, I opt not to. *Sorry, Richie,* but I have to prepare. 

After all, I’m going to be killing someone soon. 

I sit with the busywork on my screen for a few minutes longer. I open documents. Close them. Open emails. Close them. *Spam.* I think about it. I leave the folder uncleared for now. 

And then it hits the time—*12:44 PM.* 

And everything stops. The entire world—except for my unnecessary breathing—*freezes.* 

I get up. Take a sip from my mug—Americano, still warm.

I glance over at my colleagues, now stalled in semi-unflattering positions.

Then out the nearby window. Out to the city from a sixth floor perspective. To the violent sun, under which some lives live but certainly all lives die.

*A long sigh.* I make my way.

Down the hallway, shuffling past folks halted mid-stride, mid-conversation, laptops snug under their arms, coffee-cups halfway raised.

Down the emergency stairs—always some folks stuck there too, feet split between steps. I sashay past and down.

Out the back door of the building now, I *open* to a suspended world.

It’s not a novel sight. It’s not breathtaking. It’s about as common to me as the world that’s in motion.

Birds stopped above, dangling like stage props on string. The only part that still gets me. The rest I could leave behind. 

I set off.

*12:44 PM.* And it’ll stay 12:44 PM until I complete my job, after which, clocks will tick again, birds will fly, humans will resume their wanderlust from their cubicle vantage points, and Liz will be content listening to *Les Yper Sound* by *Stereolab.* 

She doesn’t actually think she needs other bands anymore. 

Just Stereolab.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I walk the ICU hallway. 

I scan the printed cards marking each room.

I come across room 503E. It says PATRICIA GREER on it.

That’s the one. I head inside.

There’s a weight to the room. Hits me immediately.

To my understanding, each reaper has their own approach to the work. Nothing is necessarily uniform. Hence, mine can be summed up with the following phrase: “Meet reality where it is.”

Different generations line the perimeter of the bed. All look concerned. 

Of note—the woman seemingly mid-desperate text. And the old man at bedside, clutching Patricia’s hand, leaning close.

In the past, I might’ve taken a second to map out who was who to the soon-to-be deceased—husband, kids, grandkids. 

But now, I just sit with it. These are the people that matter to Patricia. These are the people to whom Patricia matters. 

My eyes flick to the cardiac monitor. A weak blip, long gaps between.

Of all of the ways to exit stage left, certainly, there’s much, much worse out there.

I make my way to the dying woman. I grab her arm.

Immediately, and rather ironically, life returns to her. 

The picture stays frozen, the room—*the world*—stay frozen, but she joins me now, in stalled reality.

Her eyes dart around at the paused scene in front of her.

“Patricia,” I say softly.

Weakly, she turns her head up to me—the one figure unfamiliar in the room.

She takes a while to finally speak. “Yes?” she says back, sickly, struggling, looking a bit afraid. 

“I think it’s your time now.”

It’s in moments like these I can actually see the act of people *hearing* words. Elsewhere in the day and night, words may come but their registering is a whole other thing altogether.

Her eyes well a tad. Her face sparks a painful smile. “Are you sure?” she says, almost stifling a wry laugh. 

“I’m afraid so,” I say.

She sits with the answer. Eyes moving slower now. She closes her eyes, softly inhales, and places her free hand in mind.

“Do I get to know where you’re taking me?”

I answer gently. “I don’t actually know where you end up after this. Think of me more as… the man that holds the door open for you.”

I try my best to make it sound organic. Like it’s the first time I’m saying it. After handling as many ‘departures’ as I have, you tend to A/B test. You find the lines—the script—that bring about the most comfort. As is always the case, what works is never quite what you’d assume.

I see her smile. I look back over the scene of worry surrounding her—*no greater expression of love on this planet than worry.* Then back to her. Her eyes are open yet again. 

“My son isn’t here,” she says. “I feel he’ll be here soon.”

I can already tell where she’s going with this. 

“Can I have just a few more minutes? And he might just show up.”

I take a moment to respond. I use the break to suggest various things—*thought, contemplation,* the *appearance of me truly receiving her words the same as she’s receiving mine.* Of course, I already know the answer. 

“It might not necessarily feel this way, right now,” I finally start, “but there is a cosmic order to everything. Down to the second. And even I don’t have all of the puzzle pieces, but I can promise you, it is this way because this *is the best way.*” *3, 2, 1, and*—“And it’s sometimes ridiculous and sometimes horrifying and sometimes quite charmed, but all of that matters the same at the end.” Another pause. “Though, might I say—yours most certainly looked like a charmed life.”

I conjure up as sincere a smile as I can.

“I’ll take that as a *long* no,” she laughs.

I laugh too. *Mirroring*—helps with comfort and building rapport.

A long exhale from her now. A meditative one.

“Do I get to know your name?” she asks.

Huh. *That’s a new one.* “Of course,” I say. “Some people call me… Ted.”

She squeezes my hand. “Ted. *Simple.*” 

“Yeah,” I laugh.

She gives me a meaningful look. “Well, I’ll make your job easier, Ted. I’m ready to go.”

I nod. “You’re ready to go,” I echo back. And if I may add to the adage—her life does indeed flash before her eyes as I say my next words. But they flash before mine too.

“*I release you*,” I say.

And she dies.

And I detach from her. And I let out a deep breath.

*A real exhale.* Followed by a stretch—then a yawn.

Alright. *Done.* Not too bad, this one, all in all.

I turn my attention to the family in arrested motion, a normal part of my de-stress ritual. “It wasn’t too bad, guys,” I say. “She went well. She went on good terms.” I squeeze a random shoulder. “You got this... chins up, okay? Remember to lean on each other.” 

The expressions—naturally—stay static. *Worried.*

I leave and head back through the hallway.

At the end, by the elevator and the exit stairs I’ll be taking, I spot a man in a business suit who looks as if he was mid-sprint.

In the past, I might’ve taken a second to contemplate whether he had some relation to the recently deceased. But now, it’s just set dressing. 

I head down.

I’m almost there. I’m almost *completely* desensitized to all of this.

Just a small pang of discomfort left. One I’m sure I’ll be able to stamp out soon enough. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I pull my electric scooter back into the work parking lot.

I beep myself into the building.

Up the stairs, to my floor, back to—

My seat.

I pull out my notebook. 

Scratch off the name:

**~~12:44 PM – Patricia Greer – Greenridge Memorial Hospital – Palliative Care Unit~~**

And as the dividing ink line crosses last character, the world springs to life again. The hum of sound returns—construction outside, voices in the hall, honking, airplanes overhead, birds chirping. All the noise I used to tune out, now landing clear, gift-wrapped in detail.

Liz with her Stereolab.

Richie calls out to me.

“Hey, *hey* Ted,” he says. “*I’m British Batman.*” Low, gruff voice follows. “*I’ve got free minutes to save the queen. I’m bloody vengeance, mate.”* Then back to normal Richie voice. “*Free* instead of *three,* get it? ‘Cause like, I feel like sometimes they say their ‘th’ as ‘f’—”

“Your accent’s getting better, Rich.”

“Shit, you really think so?”

“Yes,” I say in the way that absolutely means ‘no’. I get to be honest. He gets to interpret it the way he wants. We both win. 

Liz stretches. Makes a noise. Pauses the music on her laptop—crinkled, staticky, head-phone contained audio cutting out. She takes out her buds. 

“Iiiiiii am gonna go and grab some snacks from ye olde kitchen. Anyone doth participate?”

“You old-timey now?” Richie asks. 

“I am all things all the time, Richie,” she says. 

The obligatory two seconds of silence before—

“I’m good.” Richie again. 

“Thought so,” she says. “Mr. Teddington?” 

I do a quick glance over, away from the *administrative nothing* on my screen. “I’m good, thanks.”

She lingers.

“Busy day?” she asks.

“Not particularly.”

I keep my eyes fixed ahead. She does this every now and then—this strange, for lack of a better term, sizing me up. Of what and for what, I have no real idea. 

“Saweet. Well I shall BRB.”

Yes, she says the acronym out loud. 

She steps out. I plug in before Richie gets any more ideas about testing out his tight five on me.

I scan the notebook again.

Three more names left today. Time will freeze at *2:44 PM*, *3:50 PM*, and *11:20 PM*. 

And I’ll send people away—or ‘kill them’, my choice of words varying depending on time of day and how I’m feeling. 

‘Kill them’ feels more appropriate, right now. 

And Liz is already back, Coke Zero in hand. ***“Same great Coke taste with none of the calories,”*** is her usual line. She likes pretending she’s an advertisement. It isn’t funny but she finds it so hysterical it becomes sickly tolerable in a way I can’t place.

She doesn’t say the line.

She drops off a piece of chocolate on the corner of my table. Heads back to her desk. Earpods in.

Music loud.

I turn and level a look at her. After a bit, she finally notices me staring at her. 

She takes out a bud. “Yes?” she asks.

I lift the square piece of Lindt at her. “Why?”

She shrugs. “You must eat, my child”. She goes back to her work.

Weird, weird girl.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I’m at home now. It’s *5:30 PM* and I’m absolutely basking in the glory of the ‘uninterrupted world of motion’ I’ve been granted from *3:50 PM* to *11:20 PM.* Near eight hours of no killing. No suspended time.

My favorite thing in the world is a meaningful gap between reaping duties. I sit on my sofa in the living room, turn on the TV to my favorite sitcom, panel window open, balcony door propped beside, and watch while the city ticks beside me. Cars go by, someone mows their lawn, pedestrians talk on the sidewalk below, and meanwhile on the flat electric square, Blanche shames Rose for being aspirational.  

“*You?* Rose, you can’t be Fashion Show Chairman! Why, you thought *Giorgio Armani* was a puppet on *Ed Sullivan*!” 

“Does that mean you don’t think I'm smart enough for the job?” Rose. 

“No, I think you’re smart enough. You just have no taste!” 

The studio audience approves. 

This isn’t happiness for me, but it is contentment, which I believe is probably what happiness is anyways, so I guess I’m happy.  

I suppose this state of comfort is as good a time as any for me to answer some questions that might be lingering in your mind. 

*Who is the Grim Reaper?* Of course asks no one because much like Santa Claus, the name conjures up an image so vivid that little needs to be left to the imagination—skeleton man, tall, big black robes, scythe. ‘Chill guy, isn’t afraid of anything.’

Now, the stereotype *is* a bit off, given my overall human-seeming disposition. Though, I suppose the general immortality, seeming agelessness, and immaculate conception origin of me and my peers undercuts that. Which, of course, would then beg one to ask:

*My peers? How many other reapers are there?* My best guess would be between ten to twenty-thousand. We’re all split geographically. I have *thrice* run into the one who covers the area neighbouring mine. Nice guy. 

*And the day job?* Truthfully, the intricacies and ins and outs of this world are a little lost on me. I was “born”, and alongside a tight list of immutable rules and primers I was given, I was also assigned an *identity,* a home, and a rather pointless desk job. Strings pulled by *whoever* or *whatever* to make me *some sort* of headcount on a sheet. I’m assuming—my best guess, anyway—to give us reapers some modicum of structure to avoid us spinning our wheels between murders.

*And the answer to the grand mystery of life itself?* Honestly? No clue. I wasn’t lying to Patricia when I told her I didn’t know where she was going. I might hold, at best, a slightly bigger slice of information than the rest of the populace—*I’m aware humans have souls, they’re sent somewhere at the point of death*—but the rest of this chaotic construction (talking points I’ve been given notwithstanding) remains unclear. 

*And how do I feel about all of this?* 

Hm.

And that’s when I put a pin in the imaginary conversation I play in my head to keep myself from feeling overly segmented—overly relegated. I suppose *lonely* is another word for it, but it feels quite loaded. After all, I have the Golden Girls with me. 

I look away from the 80’s sitcom magic for a moment, down at the small blue notebook beside me. I thumb it open. 

Ah yes, *my notebook.* I suppose that deserves an explanation as well. To keep it as brief as possible, the first page covers my schedule of ‘duties’ for the day: the list of people I need to kill—times and locations included. It refreshes every midnight. And if I’m so inclined, at any given moment I can flip ahead and see the next nine days of death ahead of me too. Those, too, shift forward at midnight. Kind of like a conveyor belt. 

I usually only ever flip forward one page though, generally in the evening, just to see how much shit I might be in for the next day. The damage this time is…

*Eighteen people to kill tomorrow.* Yikes. Most days oscillate between six to eleven tops. 

I close the pocketbook. Return to the TV.

I think about rules. The rules to everything. The rules and intricacies of this rather precarious situation everyone finds themselves in. A world where all humans die. A world that I’ve been explicitly told has some degree of *order* and *logic* to it, despite how chaotic, random, and hopeless it all quite strongly seems to appear. 

And then, I think about the rules in the world of sitcoms. If something funny happens? The audience laughs. Something sad happens? They say aww. Conflict exists, most surely, but things reset. The stakes never get too high. The world is safe and full of hugs and jokes and any structure that exists therein is designed to manufacture comfort. Bad things happen, but they’re couched appropriately and are never the focal point.

I realize my life is the opposite of a sitcom.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It is 7:14 AM the next day.

Time stays frozen and I close my eyes, sleep, sleep, and sleep some more, until I wake up to—

*Still 7:14 AM*, and the first person awaiting my send off.

Some days suck. Today is ‘some days’. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In the very rare occasions—the times when name, location, and general context aren’t enough—there’s another ‘tell’ of sorts I can rely on. One that’s especially great when parsing through a crowd. 

The *body*—belonging to the soul I’ll need to send off—will have a *light glow.* A faint, gold-edged shimmer, the air around them wavering—thin, like desert heat that won’t hold still. Soft illumination.

Again—very rare occasions.

I enter the gymnasium. Even with the obvious glow, context alone leads me to the man on the floor, clutching his chest. A half-circle of middle-aged men hover over him, others frozen mid-shout into their phones, or crouched beside, trying to help. 

I head over and grab his arm.

He alone wakes up from the silence. “Gah—I just—*wait*, I think the pain, *I think it’s*—” He looks around, spots his friends fixed like mannequins. He pauses. “What the fuck?”

“Hey Ellis,” I say. “I’m afraid it’s your time to go now.”

He shifts slightly to look up at me. “Who are you?”

“I’m the, uh, I’m the person that helps with the transition. *From life*, to uhh—” 

“The grim reaper?”

“Yeah. *Sure.*”

He hesitates. “Where’s your scythe, then?”

I cross *Ellis Jackson’s* name off the list. 

Next, an office building, one not unlike mine. *9:45 AM.*

I maneuver the sixth floor of the building, crossing a conference room peppered with decorations and a birthday cake marked with *Happy 60th, Brian!*

Indeed, our world is funny sometimes. Often, even. 

I take no more than a fingerful of icing, though really I want a proper slice.

Then, I reach Brian Silverman’s shiny body lying on the floor in his cubicle, halted with the rest of the world. I jumpstart the secret version of time only he and I get to experience, and carve through my script—

“And, if I may say, what a charmed life it looks like you’ve been leading.”

“You think dying at work, *on my birthday,* is a charmed life?”

“I mean, it looks like your coworkers are going all out to throw you a surprise party in the other room?” 

“*Really?*”

“*Yeah Brian*, I mean, come on, it’s your 60th! Or, y’know, *was* your sixtieth, but in any case—”

I see him struggle to move. I interrupt. “Oh, sorry—you unfortunately won’t be able to see it. You can only move a few inches at most. It’s to stop what we call an *anomaly*\*\*\*:\*\*\* your body being somewhere completely different once time restarts.”

He shoots me the gloomiest look I’ve seen in a minute.

“What I *can* do is bring the cake over for you to look at.” Then—“No slices, though. *Anomalies* and all that.” 

I cross *Brian’s* name off the list. 

*10:11 AM.* The road. 

An impending two-car wreck that is absolutely the pickup driver’s fault. On he goes—my hand on his arm—ranting and raving about how the other party should’ve been the one looking out. No mention at all about the red light he blitzed past. *And,* once he’s done with that shtick, he extends his anger out onto everything else–-the bullshit morning he’s had, the bullshit of *me* being there, and so on and so forth.

I’m almost surprised he doesn’t ask to speak with my manager.

He does, however, proudly claim that I could let the rest of the event play out without intervening. No need to send him off—he’ll survive the accident. He’s not like the rest of these punks–-*who said punks are, I’m not sure*. He can *take it.* He’ll come out of it, all in one pi—

“I release you,” I say, exhausted at the diatribe and unable to stomach a second more.

No *charmed life* speech for him. Platitudes were above him. 

Then I move to the other, more painful side of the equation. The woman in the adjacent car. The one whose only sin was going forward on a green light.

I sigh.

Then I cross *Clayton Reed* and *Loretta Shen’s* names off the list. 

And more and more names after that. Tender conversations. Painful conversations. Conversations where the dying randomly embody *one* of the stages of grief, whether it be anger, denial, bargaining or what have you. The spin of a roulette wheel every time.

*Ink. Line. Ink. Line. Ink. Line.*

And every time I cross off a new name, I have to be where I was when time stopped. Not right  next to the hospital bed, or in the middle of the road, as that’d mean an anomaly–-*me appearing out of nowhere*—but rather, in my seat. At my desk. 

*Yes,* I do in fact choose to be here. Most business days, anyways.

I look over, time again in motion after the pen goes through—

“*Wasting your days, chasing some girls, alright chasing cocaine, through the backrooms of the world all night*”—Liz softly singing Destroyer’s *Kaputt*—her Stereolab claims disproven: there indeed are other bands. 

Rich on his zoom call. His *loud* zoom call. Loud because he’s on it. “Yeah, I don’t know, I’d question that—I, honestly, if we keep just bolting ahead and saying we want a *perfect* ATS system, all we’re gonna have is another *bad* ATS system—”

And, relative to the alternative—

I like this part.

But unfortunately the afternoon and early evening call for more souls. 

*2:32 PM.*

I enter Lucia Halbrook’s home through the unlocked back door.

She is suspended in mid-air, the stool halfway kicked out beneath her, knotted rope fastened around her neck.

I wake her up.

She holds in place, defying gravity.

“Wait,” she says, “it didn’t work?”

“No,” I say, her noticing me now, “it worked.”

“But what about the—”

“Pain?” 

“*Yeah.*”

“Yeah. You get to go before that part.”

“Go. *Go where?*”

“Not sure,” I say. “That’s sort of the whole grand mystery, or whatever.” 

“Huh,” she says. “No pain.” Then—”Wait, *do people know about this?*”

“No,” I reply. Then, thinking about it, “Probably best they don't, right?”

*2:50 PM*

I find Neha Kaur’s room in Birch Haven Regional Hospital.

I hold her arm and say my spiel. It’s about as run of the mill a send-off as I’ve ever done. 

Partway through, I suppress a yawn in order to not seem rude.

A standard two minute drill. When you’re a professional, sometimes you just gotta know how to do it.

1kqwzeo,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1kqwzeo/another_mothers_day_ruined/,Another Mother’s Day ruined,"It’s hard for me to believe I might be a victim of emotional abuse. It’s hard for me to accept those words. Family members have said it and I almost get angry with them about it (internally, I don’t lash out because they’re my support system). My therapist has not said it but she has mentioned needing to feel emotionally safe if I was to choose couples counseling. It was only a recent breakthrough and the end of our session. 

And I think it was that - “emotionally safe” that triggered me because I realized I don’t think I’ve ever felt emotionally safe with him. In the beginning, he told me I would be his last girlfriend and he loved me quick. He was so sure to reassure me and send me flowers just because. My overthinking was cute and he’d tell me not to worry and try to be my strong and steady. 

Now here we are. The night before Mother’s Day we got in an argument because I cooked a nice meal, cleaned up the whole kitchen, and did laundry while he barely spoke to me and just drank wine and scrolled on his phone. When I raised my unhappiness with me, he told me it’s my fault because I don’t communicate and rolled his eyes at me when I said I shouldn’t have to tell him to say thank you for dinner or that it’s nice to clean the kitchen after someone cooks you dinner. Rolled his eyes again when I said we should both be contributing equally to the house we live in. 

Our argument ended with him throwing his dishes into the sink. When I expressed that I am afraid when he does stuff like this (it is not the first time he’s been aggressive with an inanimate object), he mocked me because he’s “so violent all the time.” I tried really hard to tell him he was wrong but he continued to respond in sarcasm over my fear. 

The next morning (Mother’s Day) he woke up as if nothing happened and didn’t talk to me. After I had gotten up early with the kids, made coffee, had muffins from the store. He just moved around the house in silence on his phone. I had to pepper him with questions before family came over. We didn’t do anything special or out of the ordinary. It wasn’t until I was going to bed that he said, “hope you had a fun mother’s day.” 

But none of that is new - all I can think about is when was the last time I felt emotionally safe? Not when he punched the wall next to my head and got mad because “how can you think that of me?” when I said I was worried he would hit me. Not when he got mad at me because I wasn’t ’romantic enough’ trying to initiate sex. Not when he forgot a really important work presentation I had. Not when he wouldn’t slow down drinking leading up to me birthing our kids (or since then). Not when he shouted at me that he had no sympathy for me when I was freshly post partum and crying from fatigue. Not when he nitpicks a singular word I say to start an argument over nothing. Not when he gives me the silent treatment anytime he’s unhappy with me. I don’t even know when? Maybe at our wedding?

I am just so lost. How do I accept that this is emotional abuse (if that is what this is)? Why am I so reluctant to believe or admit is happening to me. ",1,1747717968.0,emotionalabuse,0,1.0,False

This was treated as an ulcer with 3 days of sacralfate 3x a day. And 5 days of omeprazole twice a day. As well as gabapentin & zofran as needed, diet of chicken and rice, I started adding native pet probiotic supplement powder to his meals.

Could chicken be upsetting his gut even more?

Is there a possibility this is something bigger and more serious than just an ulcer or does the uncontrollable diarrhea go away over time?

II,"Charlotte’s glove is damp in my hand, warm from inside but wet with something—snowmelt, juice box, a mystery. She tugs, bored. I check the time. 8:47. The line isn’t moving. The chocolate torte better be here. James asked for it last week, offhandedly, like it didn’t matter. But I know he’ll smile if it’s there on the table.

I glance up—and there he is.

God. Him.

“Audrey?”

His voice. Exactly the same and somehow thinner and sadder. Tired. I look up from my phone and feel my heart react—not with love, not with regret, just a jolt. A shape I recognize in a dream.

He’s standing there in a long coat, corporate and rumpled. He looks worn. Handsome, maybe, in the way coffee shops at closing time are still beautiful. But faded. Edges dulled by something grinding and endless. Law, probably.

“Hey,” I say, and I smile because I remember how to. “Wow. You still in the city?”

“I—yeah. Same old firm.”

Of course it is. It always is. That building still gives me goosebumps.

“Still doing the long hours thing?”

He nods. He doesn’t say much. His eyes flick up at the ceiling like there’s a number floating there—maybe the hours he’s worked since Sunday. I remember how he used to talk about that place: conference calls at midnight, pride in chaos, sleep like something you win after suffering.

That’s the reason I was so interested in him. He’s already broken by the firm before he even started. I always feel a certain love for him. Not the kind lovers have, but the same kind of love I feel for Charlotte. Motherly. Like he needs to be cared for, because no one ever really has.

“I basically live there,” he says.

I laugh. “God, I remember that. You used to take pride in the magic roundabout, and you told us all about it.”

He smiles, but it’s the tight kind. The kind people wear when they’re hoping you don’t quote their past back to them.

“How about you?” he asks, and I feel his eyes flick down to Charlotte. She leans into my side, her head against my coat, staring up at him like he just stepped out of a story I forgot to finish.

“Oh, you know. Suburbs. Two kids. PTA drama. No indemnities or waterfall provisions, thank God.”

I lift the paper bag—half apology, half explanation.

“Getting something sweet for James, my husband. It’s his birthday. He’s obsessed with that flourless chocolate torte they make here.”

And there it is. The shift. Barely visible, but I feel it. Like walking into a room where someone just shut a drawer a little too fast.

“That’s nice,” he says. Twice. Like maybe if he says it again, it’ll settle.

The silence that follows stretches just enough to notice. Charlotte sighs. I feel like I’ve wandered into an unlived version of my life, one where we’re not strangers buying dessert, where we never chose different doors. Where we both work at the same old firm, drafting documents for clients who do not care if we one day decide to leave. Work, instead of living life.

I wonder what he sees when he looks at me. Does he imagine me in labor, sweaty and broken open, naming a child he’ll never meet? Does he regret?

“Well,” I say, and I hate how final it sounds. Like the conversation is something to pack away and store.

“It was good to see you.”

“You too.”

I turn before he can say anything else. Charlotte’s jacket squeaks as we walk toward the door. He probably watches for a second. The night air cuts sharp against my skin. The car is cold. I buckle her in without thinking.

I don’t look back, as there is nothing to look back at. No firm to go back to, no colleagues to reply to and most certainly no timer waiting to be turned on again.

1kqwv5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkirkMains/comments/1kqwv5w/testing_skirks_teams_with_childe/,Testing skirk's teams with childe,"so, i was wondering how much i can min/max skirk and tartaglia together, not only damage wise, but also style/gameplay wise.

points i considered while trying to team build around this.  
skirk's 8s E skill cooldown.  
Tartglia's silly cooldown.  
Deep galleries set's 6s cooldown between burst/NA.  
trying to make use fully of the kits so its not completely a wheelchair team for tortelini.  
  
in my tests, i used ayaka as a place holder/ compared clear speed using my shenhe.  
note that all my chars are c0r0 beside tartaglia/ Ayaka uses skyward sword (i am 100% will get azurelight for my queen)

rotation roughly takes 22-24s  
Best supports (no surprise), are furina ice coffee, tho i was still looking if i can get yelan to take furina's place (15s ult duration could theoretically fit)

1- tartaglia E --> Escoffier E --> furina E Q --> escoffier burst (this usually takes roughly 8s), this generates rifts(2.5s CD), enable the skirk's Return to Oblivion passive buff, and keeps both buffs up for the next 20s  
2- Ayaka E --> Q, (supposedly mimic Hold E --> Burst by our queen/ Takes around 2s), Skirk should have higher multipliers than ayaka here.  
3- skirk's 8s CD starts when she holds E, and the galleries activate at end of burst, giving us around 6-8s and that is where childe comes in.  
4- Childe E-->charge attack --> burst --> charge attack --> charge attack (childe's Charged Attacks multipliers surprisingly on par with Skirk's, add to that high burst multiplier and triggering 4 riptides), this should also allow tortelini to generate more rifts for skirk, and takes around 7s.  
5- Swap back to skirk's E--> Na combo.

repeat the rotation, but no need for starter E.  
this was able to 1 rotate Yumkasaur, at the end of childe's burst. and was faster clear than shenhe/ayaka.  
shenhe ayaka was 12 Quills in rotation, needed Few normal attacks.

Pros.  
for childe.  
1- childe's Charged attack multiplier is 279% at talent level 11 (compared to skirk's (282.84). they are not usually utilized in internation because stamina issues. but in skirk's team, no body else really uses stamina.  
2- childe also gets to use his either melee stance or ranged stance, and triggering up to 4 riptides, for an up to 2269% multiplier in 6s duration.

3- you get to use both burst and melee stances within the rotation, while maintain full uptime, on dealing damage.  
4- there are not problems with generating rifts for the melee stance, thanks to Mr. world wide massive hydro application.  
5- this rotation can clear multiple waves in a row, and tortelini have quadratic scaling for multi mob enemies.  
6- you can run a pseudo support tartglia with elegy of the end/ nobless or scroll, to giga buff skirk more.  
7- compared to neuvi and ayata, tortelini can front load his dmg in 6s, while the other options have far more sustained dps, and ayato can buff skirk's normal attacks with his burst.

8- Master and Disciple

  
Cons.  
1- Very intensive, it is a bit difficult to keep swapping back and forth, as well as keep tracking of your CD, could be a pro for certain people.  
2- Shenhe seems to have the highest DPR, so that is a huge downgrade, specially that it is pointless to try and save shenhe for other teams.  
3-Energy issues with tortelini melee burst, not sure if replacing ayake with skirk can fix some of those problems tho.  
4-while it allows you to use both Burst and NA in the same rotation, some other options could go for double burst and having higher total DPS.  
5- still requires 2 of the best supports in the game, escoffier and furina, so it is still costy.

1kqwtcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1kqwtcw/jewish_revert_leaving_islam/,"Jewish revert, leaving Islam","Hello, I’m a 22F mixed heritage—half Mexican & 1/2 Ashkenazi Jewish. My mother is Mexican- Roman Catholic, while my father was Jewish, but I was never raised in a religious environment, having been primarily exposed to Judaism.

According to Torah law, I’m not considered Jewish. After much reflection, I embraced Islam in Oct 2023, just two months after my father passed away. I’ve been an exotic dancer since I was 18, and while I understand that this might contradict Islamic principles, some Muslims have told me it’s permissible, encouraging me to pursue my faith. I’ve started praying and wearing the hijab, and despite facing prejudice and Islamophobia motivated attacks for my appearance and beliefs, I’ve remained committed.

I participated in Ramadan multiple times, inspired by my best friend, who was raised in a hijabi household. I enjoyed the experience, as it reminded me of some Jewish traditions. However, in the past six months, I’ve felt increasingly disconnected from the community. I’ve encountered a lot of judgment, particularly regarding my education; many seem to equate a degree with worth, even though I believe education should not solely be about finding a husband or settling into traditional roles.

It’s disheartening to witness hostility toward Jewish people within some Muslim circles. I've experienced outright hostility, 
Once I said I hope the Middle East finds peace & an Arab man turned around 2 tell me he wishes hitler did the job right. 

I disclosed to a guy I was Jewish the conversion went ""yea I reverted & my father passed but he is Jew- *cuts me off mid sentence * ""FUCK ISRAEL FREE PALESTINE.!""
Once a man said his family would completely disown him over me as if l'm a thing to be ashamed of kinda crazy because don't Quran say to not be patriarchal because none of that matters when you stand in front of Allah? 
I've realized as an independent WOC I get shit on but if I was a white revert who followed some idiot named Abdul I'd have more respect.
 Yet Allah guided me alone to him in a path that had so much pain means nothing right? & the women are no better. They hate other women. It's the culture it's all a competition, had a hijabi girl call my community college ghetto
Plus people are only nice to reverts because it’s haram to mistreat them I can guarantee if it wasn’t written for them they’d wouldn’t even acknowledge them. 
l've straight up just had a room go silent with dirty looks like I farted when I say my dad is Jewish. 
It seems that my identity as a Jewish woman often overshadows my commitment to my faith. I can’t help but feel the weight of societal expectations and the competition among Muslim women, where judgments abound based on appearances, marital status, and academic achievements.

My father, who married a gentile in the 1980s, embraced diversity and did not hold prejudice. It’s perplexing to witness the ongoing conflict & animosity, especially when history shows that both communities have faced hardship. But this didn’t just start in 1948 Jews weren’t welcomed to Israel with hot coffee & burekas. Instead, we were dumped in the middle of nowhere with nothing but the scent of corpses in our nose & AKs.
My friend advised me to keep my Jewish heritage to myself, but I refuse to hide who I am. My Lips/nose and last name are part of my identity, and I don’t want to be ostracized for my Jewish roots. 

Despite feeling drawn to the beauty of Islam, I wonder if it truly fits me. I truly enjoy religion 
As I contemplate my future, including the possibility of moving to Israel, I also consider returning to my Jewish roots, which I believe would honor my father’s memory. Right now, I find myself at a crossroads, grappling with my beliefs and identity.

My six year old female, spayed resident cat has not been getting along with her new 2.5 year old neutered brother. 

It’s been about 3 1/2 months and we have tried everything from diffusers to Jackson galaxy methods. Even his bully tincture(didn’t work). 

He has been attacking her, which now has caused her to be an anxious mess putting herself in the corner and swiping at him if he’s 6ft or closer. Growling etc. 

  Anyways, the vet recommended Ativan for both cats, not only to curb his dominance but also help her calm down. 

I gotta say, day two and she(resident cat) is like a kitten again. Playing, vocal, being extra cuddly and cute. The only thing I don’t like is some wobbly behavior. Missing a step, falling off the coffee table. Having trouble jumping into the window sill. I know this is one of the side effects but will it eventually wear off? I don’t want to worry about her falling. 

Ask for Ativan for inter cat aggression. Has anyone had any success stories? Will they have to remain on it forever or can eventually come off of it? 

Thanks!!",1,1747717235.0,CatAdvice,1,1.0,False

While standing in line, kinda zoning out, I started noticing little things—the sound of the barista steam frothing milk, the tiny bell on the door jingling as people came in, even the laughter from a group of friends by the window.

I guess I do this every day, but I realized I rarely *really* noticed it. It's like I just hit my auto-pilot button, you know? But today, for some reason, it hit me that all these small things happen daily, sometimes without us even realizing how beautiful they can be when you pause for a sec...

1kqwrou,https://www.reddit.com/r/DermatologyQuestions/comments/1kqwrou/please_help_me_solve_my_chaotic_skin_situation/,Please help me solve my chaotic skin situation.,"I need help. I’ve never posted on reddit, I only breeze through for the occasional gardening tip or small town gossip. 
I apologise for my thesis in advance, I’m at my wits end.

TL;DR.  Woman in 40’s fed up with weird skin issues. Derm is bored with her life choices and doesn’t give a shit. 
Female. 42. Country Victoria, Australia.


Caucasian, pale in winter but tan easily in summer, rarely burn.  Thick dark curly hair.
70kg, 5’4”.  Moderately active.  Under a fair amount of stress.  
Drink 1-2 glasses of red wine on the weekends. Vape (ashamedly, I’m lowering nicotine level slowly). Good diet, lifelong vegetarian and very aware of nutrient content of meals. Too much coffee.  Low sugar intake. Very little processed food.

Recent skin diagnosis and treatment from Dermatologist:
Rosacea - Soolantra, mildly soothing but otherwise did nothing except give me new teeny tiny little pimples around my mouth and eyebrows.
Hidradenitis Supperitiva on breasts  and Acne on chest and shoulders - Doxycycline, Clindatech and bleach baths.

After 3 months of above I developed an intensely painful, itchy and slowly spreading rash between my breasts and persistent Nausea. I treated the rash as fungal (because antibiotics) with no relief. Dermatologist ceased Clindatech without citing a reason and recommended Benzac wash and a compounded Salicylic Acid/Alcohol solution. Benzac made the rash so much more painful and itchy. I stopped using Clindatech and Doxycycline, treated as Atopic dermatitis with cortisone and zinc cream and it resolved in a couple of days. Stopped Doxycycline as there was little to no actual infection and I felt awful on it.

I’m not sold on this Dermatologist. She explains very little, does not give reasons for treatment and gives only a cursory look at my skin. She doesn't think I need an allergy test and tried to put me off. She sounded so bored and annoyed when explaining the process, really emphasising that it was long and expensive. She also only uses stickers, not pinpricks, saying that the stickers she uses are hypoallergenic.  Last time I had surgery they used hypoallergenic tape to close my eyes which resulted in a burning rash on my eyelids and cheeks. 

My face was looking as good as it’s been in years with the above skincare routine, now it’s a spotty mess again.
I put off seeking help for over a decade because of crippling anxiety about how my skin looks. I also haven’t dated in nearly 8 years because of my low self esteem.  I have no faith in my dermatologist and there are not many others around (I live regionally). I'm also a single mother and care for my mum so I had to save up to see her.  

I know that a lot of these issues would be far less noticeable if I didn’t bother them but my anxiety (often caused by poor self image) frequently results in bouts of compulsive skin picking. I am diagnosed and medicated for depression/ anxiety.
I just want to get to the bottom of this and figure out why my skin is like this to start with! I’m in my 40’s and just so over it, wrinkles and pimples is not ok.

Buckle up for a full skin history! I have many photos if needed.

Feet:
Chilblains
Dishydrotic eczema on toes - Occasionally.

Trunk:
Hyper/Hypo pigmentation in classic swirls mostly on left side including left arm.  Visible when younger but have faded. Can easily see the hypo patches when I’ve been in the sun.
Blocked/open pores/follicles particularly in centre line and areas of hypopigmentation. 
Persistent acne type pimples on chest, neck and shoulders. Often very small pimples which produce a hard core when squeezed. Not dry, pattern doesn’t really look like KP, less rash like. Rarely inflamed unless I’ve been picking.
Blackhead type spots in areas of pressure or scarring, waist of pants, stretch marks etc.

Breasts:
Blocked follicles?
Pores in left armpit and hypopigmentation areas always blocked.
Recurring lesions with hard lumps inside. Won’t heal until the ‘core’ is properly removed. Sometimes look like milia. Rarely inflamed unless I’ve been picking.
Similar spots as above but the contents is milky, similar to Montgomery glands but well away from Areola.
Openings that seem to travel under the skin for a few mm, rarely inflamed. If squeezed a thick lymph-like substance comes out. These are mostly on post breast reduction scars.
Sporadic breakouts on back with no known cause.

Neck:
Blackheads/blocked follicles? in surgery scars.
Persistent redness on sides of neck
Deep hard pimples that take forever to heal
Recurring cyst +/- 20 years on left side.

Face:
Hormonal acne, sometimes cystic. Generally not too numerous or large if not picking. Mostly on forehead or jawline.
Blackheads on forehead, nose and chin, generally pretty small, more like sebaceous filaments.
Tiny little spots with hard seeds mostly on temples.
Milia? Sometimes random but usually appear in healed or popped acne spots which then won’t fade until seed is removed. One of these keeps coming back at the Botox injection site near my left eyebrow (Botox every 12 weeks by Neurologist in head and neck for chronic migraine)
Sensitive skin on eyelids, most liquid eyeliners, makeup remover etc stings.
Prone to Styes.

Hair:
Dandruff. Itchy but mild

Other:
Eczema - Deep cracks and dry in cuticles. Occasionally elbows.
Pressure hives - come and go.
Random Atopic Dermatitis.
General sensitivity and itchiness 
+/- 3 occasions of full body rash, starts with red spots (looks like petechiae) on forearms and inner thighs, spreads over torso and limbs in large patches. Spots become raised and itchy after a few days, eventually spontaneously resolving leaving red patches for a couple of weeks. Have not identified a common link at onset.  Clotting factors are normal, checked at hospital because I take Lamotrigine.
Friction/pressure will often cause contact dermatitis.
Angioedema on face with no obvious cause.

Possibly relevant info:
Excitable immune system - Works fine but is very dramatic, a common cold often feels like a really intense flu.
Very quick and exaggerated inflammatory response, also tends to resolve quickly. 
Skin generally heals quickly.
Fibromyalgia - Allodynia.
Brachial cleft + lymph nodes removed on left side in 2001.
Calcified axillary lymph nodes.
Breast reduction and lymph node removal 2021.
IBS and multiple food sensitivities.
Adenomyosis.

Known Skincare Sensitivities:
Sunscreen 
Anything occlusive
Vitamin C
Rosewater 
Fragrances etc
Overdoing any type of skincare
Sometimes previously tolerated product will suddenly sting.

Known Allergies:
Adhesive, even hypoallergenic type
Grass - Skin only

What has worked/ not made things worse:
Salicylic Acid face wash (Cerave SA Smoothing Cleanser)
Hyaluronic Acid (The Ordinary serum)
Niacinamide (The Ordinary serum)
Non occlusive moisturiser (La Roche Posay Effeclar Duo+M)
Sulphur (De La Cruz ointment, Cannabella Hemp Seed Mask)
‘Boring Without You’  multi mask.
‘I’m From’ Honey mask
Epsom salt, Oatmeal and nettle baths.

Relevant testing:
Iron deficiency Anemia 
Low testosterone 
Low zinc
Low vit D
Blood allergy testing - minor sensitivity to dust mites, consistent with general population.
Self administered woods lamp examination shows only blocked pores (pink), no other fluorescent fungus or bacteria present.

Medications:
Zoloft
Lamotrigine
Vyvanse
Dexamphetamine
Valium (Luteal phase only)

Supplements: 
L - Theanine
Calcium
Vit D
Magnesium 
Probiotics 
Melatonin
CBD oil
Spearmint and nettle tea

Family history:
Dad - Chronic recurrent cellulitis. ?Psoriasis
Sister - Ocular dermatitis

1kqwpcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/RetirementReady/comments/1kqwpcu/retiree_plans/,Retiree Plans,"**Ever found yourself wondering what the heck you’re going to do after you retire?** I mean, sure, there are dreams of travel and endless rounds of golf (or knitting marathons, no judgment here!), but how do we actually *do* those things without driving ourselves nuts trying to fill our days? 

Here’s the thing: retirement doesn’t have to mean long, languid days staring at the ceiling wondering what’s next. It can be a time of exploration, creativity, and yes—even a bit of hustle. Think of it as working smarter, not harder. 

Here are some ideas to help you get those retiree plans rolling:

1. **Set realistic goals.**  
   Seriously, what is it you really want to explore? Maybe it's a hobby that got dusty when you were too busy growing your career. Write it down! Let’s say you want to learn guitar—set a goal to practice for 30 mins a day (and don’t get too cocky—you might end up sounding like a cat caught in a string factory!).

2. **Stay focused.**  
   Life can have a way of tossing distractions at you like confetti at a graduation—great, but overwhelming! Try to prioritize what will truly bring you joy. Consider making a priority list, so when you wake up, you know what the day holds. Pro tip: this is where a tool like **[Sunsama](https://try.sunsama.com/gdnn6ll0lczp)** can work wonders—helping you stay on track without turning your day into a never-ending to-do list. 

3. **Go home satisfied.**  
   Wait, what? How do we go home when we’re supposed to be retired? Here’s the kicker: think of each day as a mini-adventure. When the sun sets, reflect on what you accomplished, whether that was finally conquering that knitting project or figuring out the best taco joint in your town.

4. **Try something adventurous.**  
   Whether it's salsa dancing, a pottery class, or joining a writing group, step outside that comfort zone! One small commitment can lead to a whole new circle of friends—and let’s face it, nothing beats the laughter of a bunch of goofy retirees trying to learn the latest dance craze.

5. **Keep that social calendar full.**  
   Schedule coffee dates or game nights. Isolation is a sneaky creep that can sneak up on retirees, so keep those connections alive. Plus, who doesn’t love sharing a good laugh over a bad pun?

Remember, retirement isn’t just an end; it’s a whole new beginning! 🌟

So, what’s on your retiree plan list? Goals you’ve always dreamed about? Adventures awaiting? It's endless possibilities out there, and I can't wait to hear what you're all dreaming up!",1,1747716927.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

It wasn't until I turned away from the mirror and looked back into it that my face was finally my 30 yr old face! It was soo strange!!

Another reason is it lasted long enough for me to really look at/examine myself so I don't think my eyes were playing tricks on me. What in the actual fuck happened??! Glitch in the matrix or what?

I’m trying to fill out a baby/memory book for my little one and one of the questions was how much was a cup of coffee on the date of baby’s birth (along with things like number 1 song, main news headline etc) 
I was trying to google it but wasn’t having a lot of luck so thought I’d bring it to reddit. 

Anyway, thank you in advance if anyone can help me! ",0,1747715758.0,starbucks,2,0.5,False

But this year, I started developing a liking towards someone else at work, I have trouble understanding whether women are giving hints or not, this time I thought maybe it was it, obviously I did not trust my instincts on this given my lack of experience in this domain, so consulted my close friend (the friend I mentioned above, we have been really close friends ever since, she’s like a family to me now), even she thought this was it maybe, until I asked her out for coffee and she rejected me. I took the no as an answer. But it’s been eating me inside, as to why I always end up in this rejection cycle. Everyone keeps telling it’s part of the process but I don’t believe in it anymore. Me ending up in this cycle with every women from the past 6 years is making feel that I am the problem. I never get the clarity as to why I am the problem. It makes me feel lesser of a man. Makes me feel incompetent. I find it hard to wake up in mornings. So woke up today crying, how long will I be alone, why does it always happen to me, while others find it so easier than me. I don’t even get a proper validation from anyone whether I am just unattractive. I can even cry properly. It’s just tears trickling down with my blank face. I am beyond hurt with myself. My self worth has depleted. Around women I just feel I am never going to be enough, despite the amount of compliments I get from women, I don’t even know what that means. I was so set for this year to write an album, and now three months or more in I’ve made no progress.  Makes me feel why do I even try at love when there always is disappointment.

1kqwbpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/WLW_PH/comments/1kqwbpf/pagod_tita_syndrome/,Pagod Tita Syndrome,"While a lot of people will post looking for a relationship mine is looking for genuine connection. A connection is not necessarily something romantic, someone you can talk to one in a while or maybe exchange some friendly banter in short fun fun lang.

Last Saturday I met a fellow Redditor, what makes it interesting we've been chatting for almost a year. You know the kind of convo na parang mushroom, susulpot at unpredictable. And yet we entertain those messages. As you grow older you will learn to control your attachment and eagerness towards another person. It was fun hanging out with her, 5 hours felt too short when you are having fun. And what's nice about wala kasi kaming pressure to like one another so we enjoyed each others company. (Badminton na tayo sa susunod?) 

Yesterday, another friend reach out mga 1 hour yata kaming nagkwentuhan over the phone. A lot of people thought there's something going on between me and her pero wala talaga. I like her and she likes me, sabi nya ""straight"" sya. Though I like the fact na di sya madamot sa time and generous din kasi minsan nililibre nya ako, sometimes I do send her coffee or pastries at work. And as I wrap the night I asked her a professional favor, when she replied dun sa tanong ko I told her ""see this is one of the perks of having you on my friend's list."" 

Gf would always tell me na I dont know the difference between being thoughtful and being flirty, pero what if nature ko sya? Kasi in my own terms, I only flirt kapag sinabi ko na sayo that I am flirting with you. Kapag di ko sinabi then dont assume kahit padalhan pa kita ng bulaklak kasi I am just trying to make you happy that day nothing more. As some says paasa, I call it being nice and sweet. 

So ayun sa mga fellow redditors ko na single, try to look for connection instead of relationship. Hwag madaliin instead enjoy the ride, minsan relationship is much happier if you remain friends rather than jumping to being romantic and ending up with a broken heart and ego.

---------------------
Trying to figure out how to change up our setup based on my kiddos interests and could use some advice or thoughts on what you would do. 

TLDR: need to find a solution that allows my toddler to do functional kitchen work, sensory play, and art in the small space between dining room and kitchen. 

Here’s our situation: 2.25 year old. Both parents work full time and toddler is in daycare. At home, he doesn’t play with the play kitchen often, and if he does it’s for just a few minutes and then moves on. We also frequently go a community play space that has literally everything a kid could want for imaginative play - and while there he doesn’t go near the play kitchen (usually it’s train, gross motor play, sensory table, or marble run). Not sure if he spends any time at the play kitchen at daycare. 

Here’s our current setup: we have a family room that has a play area with toy rotation - this is generally where we spend most of our time. We also have the IKEA play kitchen in the dining room next to our real kitchen, which again he rarely engages with. Next to it is a weaning table that he also never uses as he eats at his tower or at the dining table with us. Sensory play is usually just sand or water in a bin on the floor and I usually put a waterproof mat down underneath.

He definitely likes to help cook or make coffee so we drag his tower around our tiny galley kitchen so he can be part of the process (even though it is a total pain with the lack of space in our kitchen). 

What I’m trying to figure out: at this point, we’ve had the play kitchen for about a year and he has just never shown much interest. It’s a big piece of furniture taking up space so I’m thinking of getting rid of it and maybe just getting a sensory table so we can have easier access to sensory play and a surface where he can stand and color or prepare a snack - but then maybe I should get a functional kitchen instead?

TLDR at bottom

Currently setting up my 10 gallon 10x10x20 in. Tank is currently empty and I will not get a fish until the nitrogen cycle is complete. 

I got some sand and gravel from LFSs but that’s currently it for tank decorations. I’ll wash them before putting them in the tank and stuff. 

As for decorations, I know bettas need at least one hide. I’ve seen coffee cups and terracotta pots recommended, but are these actual good options or are they meant to be temporary? (If these are good options, do I need to be concerned about paint chipping off of coffee cups, for example?)

I’ve seen driftwood a lot on here so I looked around at LFSs, and some pretty ~18in driftwood pieces were like $40! The big ones were mounted to some metal stand I assume to keep it in place. I also saw a few expensive rocks. So far as these go… what are some relatively affordable recommendations? I’m willing to pay more for the peace of mind but I don’t want to be ripped off! I saw some cheaper ones online like on Amazon and eBay but I don’t really know how to gauge what’s safe. 

Also, what would you recommend for size, type and amount of driftwood? (For example, would I want 3 small ~5in pieces of spiderwood? Or 1 large ~18in piece of ‘normal’ driftwood? Something else?)

And for plants, I will start with something very easy for now and maybe add more later depending on how it’s going. I’m thinking Java ferns, anubias, and Java moss — or maybe just any 2 of those. I really like the look of Amazon swords and I think floaters like frogbit are cool, but I don’t want to make things too complicated upfront. I want to start small and then I can add more once I’m more familiar with things. 

So, I guess my idea is to do something like this… put the gravel and sand in the tank, place the driftwood and hide(s), start cycling the water, and then try to make java moss grow on the driftwood and then I guess get Java ferns and/or anubias tied to something?

(Also this is kind of silly but if I see a rock or something outside and I think it’s really pretty, can I clean it thoroughly and put it in the tank?)

TLDR; are coffee mugs great hides, what kind of driftwood should I get and for how much, and should I pick any of these 3 plants to start: Java fern, Java moss, anubias?",1,1747714857.0,bettafish,1,1.0,False

I think in general McDonalds in Australia have dropped the ball in recent times. They used to be the pinnacle of customer service and efficiency. Now every site has overflowing bins, staff being rude, no printers working at self-service kiosk, horrendous coffee (previously it was the most consistent (decent) coffee available) and longer waiting times.

When I was growing up McDonalds on a resume meant you were a hard worker. I can't see it standing out on a resume these days.

I would appreciate some opinions on my response, I want to defend myself but not upset my boss but also not seem like a b***h. 

First situation over a month ago a customer yelled at me bc her paperwork was wrong and I couldn't accept it, after a while of her arguing she started yelling and scratching through #s to be correct I yelled 'It doesn't work that way' and 'i can't just do it, you need the correct stuff'. A coworker grabbed our boss (I thought her door was open and she could hear, turns out it was closed and she couldn't).

Second a week ago a young girl came through who worked at a local coffee house, she had something on her record that put a hard stop on me selling her something. After I told her I couldn't accept it bc reason she asks to talk to someone else, there is a line of cars forming behind her bc she is in drive thru vs coming inside where it's dead. I turned to get boss who is talking to others. Girl complains I said ""OMFG"" and boss sells her stuff bc she knows her form coffee place and shes a good kid. 

Our workload has literally tripled since the new year, there have been so many changes in the office as our new boss took over jan 1st (elected official). I'm trying not to let it affect me then this write up.. I'd really appreciate some feedback as this is my first ever write up

""The first instance as well as the following were shortcomings on my part. It's upsetting to be written up for something I've considered a strong point for years, but I need to acknowledge my mistakes. The first instance I should have gotten my supervisor to help ease the situation, at the time I was overwhelmed and honestly thought the office door was open and the exchange was heard. In the past I have relied on others stepping in; sometimes customers just need a second voice to reinforce what they want isn't possible no matter how loud they yell.
In the second I did not swear at the customer, I did roll my eyes though and did not hide my disdain. When asked about it later I was more trying to defend myself instead of just laying out the facts of what happened. The workload has increased drastically since the new year and I have let it affect my mentality, I am sorry for letting the stress become visible and will work on""",1,1747714754.0,CustomerService,1,1.0,False
