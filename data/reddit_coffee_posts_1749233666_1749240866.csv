He sometimes works from home snd usually in the kitchen if the kids are out. He did this earlier in the week and he left his laptop on the kitchen bench then went to play outside with the kids. 

I was cooking snd thougut I would just use his laptop for quickness to search for a recipe when a message from a colleague popped up on slack. 

She was thanking him for the coffee the other day. He hadn‚Äôt mentioned this to me and I‚Äôm fairly laid back about him grabbing coffee with colleagues make or female so didn‚Äôt think much. But seeing more I became concerned, they‚Äôve been messaging ALOT- like multiple times a day, not work related. And I realised they had multiple 121 meet ups- walks, coffees, lunches whilst at work. He‚Äôs never mentioned any of these. They‚Äôve put a lot of effort into planning these, talking about how excited the both are to meet up. I was gutted as I thought we had the type of marriage he would at least keep me updated on what he‚Äôs doing, who he‚Äôs with. 

It was horrible reading their messages- he doesn‚Äôt usually text or message much or really say much in texts- he‚Äôs one of those yeh/ok/ type of people. But with her he‚Äôs been writing long messages- and she‚Äôs been very flirty and playful- complimenting him- lots of flirty jokes etc. 

She‚Äôs about 10 years younger than me‚Ä¶I was so mad but haven‚Äôt confronted him yet as ive been getting my head around it all. I‚Äôm going to this weekend but just after some advice

so last year i was living in canada studying hospitality in a Co-op program which ended this year in March. I loved everything so much and wanted to live there but my job wasn‚Äôt the most reliable ( ex.: my boss would sometimes text me at like 4am because he forgot to post the schedule and I would have to show up). 
I worked at a small coffee shop and had to go back to my country when it ended because of family issues. 
Now everyone is good and healthy and I really want to go back.
I have been applying to some positions on JobBank and I haven‚Äôt heard anything back yet but I‚Äôve only recently started applying so I know it takes a while.

Since it's the size of a 02 cone I figured out I could brew 500 g of coffee right? Wrong, of course. I forgot to take into account the fact that while in hold mode it won't flow and the cone has the capacity for only about 250 g at any given time. So my accidental recipe ended up being;

- 30 g of coffee ground medium (65 on DF54); valve closed

- 0:00: 60 g of water (bloom)

- 0:45: water up to 250 g; infuse

- 2:15: open valve and keep adding water to maintain level, up to 500 g; let draw down

- brew complete at about 4:30

It. Was. Phenomenal.

June 6, 2025, brought a diverse range of developments to the forefront of the food industry, from culinary explorations in India to the complex intersection of environmental concerns and economic realities in France. This summary synthesizes the key news items of the day, offering a comprehensive overview of the prevailing trends and challenges.

**Culinary Discoveries: Northeastern Cuisine Finds a Home in Pune**

Pune, India, is experiencing a growing appetite for authentic and unique culinary experiences. Kivi Lydia Vito's report, ""Pune on My Plate: Hidden gems in the city that serve authentic Northeastern cuisine,"" highlights the emergence of Northeastern food establishments in the city. These establishments, more akin to home kitchens than commercial ventures, are serving up Assamese and Naga cuisine. The report emphasizes the challenge of finding authentic Northeastern food, likening it to navigating the ""misty hills of the Northeast."" The trend toward these unique eateries shows a growing interest in regional Indian cuisines that are not always easily accessible through mainstream delivery platforms like Swiggy or Zomato. These kitchens operate on a weekly basis, taking pre-orders for their delicacies and providing a taste of heritage, featuring dishes with bamboo shoots, slow-simmered pork, and fermented ingredients, ingredients that tell tales of tradition. The article emphasizes the unique experience of finding these ‚Äúhidden gems‚Äù and the value they bring to Pune‚Äôs diverse food scene.

**Market Fluctuations: Financial Performance in the Food Processing Sector**

The financial health of major players in the food processing sector took center stage with reports on the performance of Tata Consumer Products and Britannia Industries on the BSE. Both are classified as Largecap stocks.

*   **Tata Consumer Products:** The tea and coffee sector company saw its share price fluctuate throughout the day, closing at ‚Çπ1115.7. The day's trading range saw a low of ‚Çπ1109.95 and a high of ‚Çπ1123. Over the past 52 weeks, the shares have traded between ‚Çπ884 and ‚Çπ1246.42. The stock showed a one-day return of 0.4%, a -3.39% return over the past month, and a 16.47% return over the past three months. The daily pivot level for the stock was set at 1112.82, indicating a key level for traders to watch. This shows that this stock is in good shape.
*   **Britannia Industries:** Operating in the Food Processing & Packaging sector, Britannia's share price stood at ‚Çπ5584 at the time of the report. The stock‚Äôs intraday trading saw a low of ‚Çπ5552.6 and a high of ‚Çπ5643.8. Its 52-week range was between ‚Çπ4506.5 and ‚Çπ6473.1. Performance metrics revealed a -0.52% return for the day, a 3.35% return over the past month, and an 18.38% return over the past three months. The daily pivot level was set at 5624.6, which traders would use as a benchmark level. This shows a healthy growth in this company.

These stock reports offer a snapshot of the financial landscape within the food sector, illustrating the day's volatility and providing insights into the recent performance of major players.

**Environmental Concerns and Economic Realities: France and the UN Ocean Summit**

A separate article shed light on the brewing conflict between environmental regulations and the livelihood of fishermen in France, reported as delegates gathered for a global UN ocean summit. The piece, titled ""'It‚Äôs goodbye to French fishermen‚Äô: Macron under pressure as crucial UN ocean summit opens,"" highlights the pressures faced by French President Emmanuel Macron. The core issue revolves around the debate over bottom trawling in France's marine protected areas.

The report features Laurent Mevel, a 60-year-old fisherman from Saint-Malo, a prominent port for scallops and crabs. Mr. Mevel articulates the fishermen's perspective, expressing concerns about job security and the potential economic impact of restricting fishing activities. He argues that protecting the seas is important, but that regulations could lead to the import of fish from other countries, thereby increasing costs and potentially undermining the local fishing industry. The article emphasizes the deep-rooted connection of fishing families like the Mevels to their traditional livelihoods. The Mevel family has been fishing the waters off Brittany as long as they can remember.

**Synthesis and Key Takeaways**

The news from June 6, 2025, showcases a multifaceted food landscape. The rise of Northeastern cuisine in Pune reflects the growing consumer interest in diverse and authentic food experiences. The financial market reports highlight the performance of key players in the food processing industry, offering a financial perspective. The conflict surrounding French fishermen exemplifies the complex interplay of environmental protection, economic sustainability, and the livelihoods of individuals who depend on the sea. The French fishing industry, specifically bottom trawling, is under scrutiny, reflecting a global trend of balancing environmental concerns with economic realities.

Overall, the food news from June 6, 2025, highlights:

*   **The growing importance of niche cuisines:** Pune's Northeastern food scene indicates a trend towards embracing regional and authentic food experiences.
*   **Financial market dynamics:** The stock reports emphasize the financial stability of established brands like Tata Consumer Products and Britannia Industries within the food processing sector.
*   **The conflict between environmental goals and industry:** The case of French fishermen exemplifies the difficult balance between environmental protection and the livelihoods of those in the fishing industry, and what the impact of regulations can be.
*   **Globalization of supply chain:** The environmental impacts will play out through the supply chain, where products could be cheaper, but will have a bigger carbon footprint.

The food news of this day paints a picture of a dynamic and evolving industry, driven by culinary innovation, financial performance, and the ongoing challenges of sustainability and environmental protection.

Kind of quiet, everyone minds their business, but there‚Äôs definitely an unspoken social order and a handful of unwritten rules you only learn when you accidentally break one. Which I guess I did.

One of my coworkers, Ron, probably late 40s?, has this white coffee mug with one of those dumb little quotes on it. I don‚Äôt remember the exact wording but it was something quirky. You know the type. He used it every single day. Always on his desk, always full of coffee. People definitely associated that mug with him. Like, it was Ron‚Äôs mug. It had a presence.

Earlier this week I was in the kitchen washing dishes and while I was putting stuff on the drying rack I accidentally bumped it. Ron‚Äôs mug was already kind of teetering near the edge. It fell. It shattered.

I felt bad immediately. Cleaned it up and went straight to Ron to tell him what happened. I said I was really sorry and offered to replace it. I even tried pulling up the same one online to show I meant it.

He didn‚Äôt yell or anything. He just got really quiet and said, ‚ÄúThat mug has been with me a long time.‚Äù Then added, ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt be the same‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just replace something like that.‚Äù He looked genuinely upset. Not mad, just deeply disappointed in a way that made me feel like I‚Äôd really let him down.

I didn‚Äôt think it was that deep. It‚Äôs a mug. But since then people have been acting kind of weird toward me. Like I did something bigger. I was walking into the kitchen later that day and I literally heard someone whisper, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the girl who broke Ron‚Äôs mug.‚Äù I also keep hearing people say, ‚ÄúDid you hear what happened to Ron‚Äôs mug?‚Äù even though I‚Äôm usually standing right there when they say it. It‚Äôs all so bizarre to me.

Someone left a brand new replacement mug on his desk a couple days later. Similar vibe, different quote. Ron didn‚Äôt touch it. Just left it there. One of the guys from accounting said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs ready.‚Äù I thought he was joking but he said it completely seriously. Another person asked me if I‚Äôd apologized again yet, like maybe in writing.

At this point it‚Äôs honestly affecting the vibe at work. Like people are quieter when I walk by. One of the admin girls said ‚ÄúI just think it‚Äôs sad‚Äù and then walked away before I could say anything. I didn‚Äôt even know people were this emotionally invested in Ron‚Äôs drink ware? Like what is going on.

Ron‚Äôs barely spoken to me since it happened.

I swear I didn‚Äôt smash it on purpose. I was being careful. I apologized. I offered to fix it. But now I‚Äôm being treated like I did something really messed up.

So yeah. I broke his ‚Äúspecial‚Äù mug and maybe I underestimated how attached he was. But it was an accident. I didn‚Äôt think it would turn into this.

AITA?

Last month, I downloaded this budgeting app and logged every single purchase for 2 weeks from my morning latte to late-night impulse buys. Seeing how 50 cents here and $6 there adds up was wild!

So I grouped my spending into essentials (rent, utilities, groceries) wants (eating out, streaming, etc) debt payments (student loans, credit card) savings (emergencies, travel).

I gave myself $40 a month for coffee and snacks so I'm not totally deprived, but also not clueless. Then I did a 0-based budget where every dollar has a job if its not going to bills or savings, its blasting my debt away. In 4 weeks, I cut 12% off my credit card balance and I'm so happy!

Now every Sunday, I spend like 15 minutes checking my budget. Sometimes I forget and I'm like ""oh crap!"", but most weeks I tighten or I treat myself to a $5 latte at most. I deserve it, right?

Today, I finally have a goal to save 3 months rent and I'm actually on track! No fear opening my banking app anymore and it feels really good. I'm steering my own ship, finally!

Budgeting isn't punishment, its permission to spend guilt-free! Specific goals and real-time tracking kills the ""I'll start next month trap"".

Posting here for the first time. I‚Äôve been suffering from symptoms for years that I thought for so many years was pelvic floor dysfunction until just recently. 

I have now identified a correlation that my symptoms are in fact tied to my diet. I think I might have a slight case of Chron‚Äôs disease. Undercooked eggs, garlic, grains, and alcohol are a few of my trigger foods to name a few. I think I also believe I have Vulvar Chron‚Äôs as I have the symptoms for vulvar as well.

This morning I had a Vietnamese Egg Coffee (I‚Äôm in the Bay Area so that‚Äôs the thing here üòÖ) & I can confirm that the egg coffee triggered a flare up. The raw egg in the coffee gave me diarrhea & then my left vulva (it‚Äôs always my left vulva side) became numb and then I felt a burning sensation down there after the diarrhea episode. 

I am currently looking into ‚ÄúPudenal Neuralgia‚Äù as well as I think this might be related. 

After years of suffering from this and not knowing what it was, I can finally say I‚Äôm getting more clarity on this. I hope sharing this helps someone else.

You will scream about overpopulation, but are you living in a fucking yurt growing your own food? Nah. You just don‚Äôt want to do the work.  

And fine, live your life. But stop acting like you‚Äôre some kind of martyr for choosing Netflix over parenthood.

My family is now relocating to the UK. I‚Äôm looking into going more full-time with my tutoring instead of working for a school there.¬†

The thing is, I have school-aged children and don‚Äôt want to be working in the afternoons and evenings. I‚Äôve been slowly building up some online students, however, I love working in-person. For this reason, I‚Äôm considering taking on adult learners - my subject is English as a second language. The thing is, IF I manage to find clients (and I really don‚Äôt know how likely that is), I‚Äôm a little nervous about meeting who I don't know people in person. All of my in-person students until now have come to me through school so I already knew and trusted the parents. The idea of going to the home of a stranger, or inviting them into my home just feels too risky - even after an initial meet up.

I‚Äôve been trying to think of work arounds and I feel like being in a public place makes sense. So that leads to my question, could I reasonably meet and tutor adult learners on a regular basis in coffee shops? I wouldn‚Äôt attempt this with younger learners, just adults.

Part of me thinks it could work - you often see people working in coffee shops and even working in small groups or pairs. However, I can also see why it‚Äôd perhaps be an odd thing to do and maybe even look bad on me as a professional.

I‚Äôm posting in this Sub-Reddit because I‚Äôm local to here and was seeing if anyone knew of anything/anyone local that could help! 

I‚Äôm 23 and it‚Äôs been around 4 years since I graduated with a first-class degree in Industrial Design. I haven‚Äôt worked in the creative field at all since uni and to be honest, I feel like I‚Äôve forgotten how to be creative altogether. Or if that‚Äôs even my passion, I feel like I‚Äôve lost my why and I have no idea what to do. 

For work previously (I‚Äôve been unemployed for the past couple of years) I‚Äôve done a mix of things: waitressing, working in an acrylic display production team, running a small vinyl/3D printed gift business, the odd logo design here and there,  and co-running a coffee trailer with a friend (which sadly ended when the friendship did; 
the trailer was on their land). Nothing really stuck, and I never built a creative career. I haven‚Äôt worked in quite a while and feel stuck, unmotivated, and like I‚Äôve wasted so much potential. 

That said, I know I love design, especially branding and product ideas that help people. I also love cooking, being outside, geocaching, mental health advocacy, and health-focused food. My dream one day is to open a small caf√©, food trailer, or shop with a wellbeing focus, maybe even offer branding help for other small businesses alongside it.

I miss learning and structure so much. I thrived at university with briefs, direction, and goals. Without that, I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôm just floating, unsure where to even begin rebuilding my skills or confidence.

It‚Äôs my birthday soon, and my parents want to help pay for an online course or subscription to help me get back on track. I‚Äôve been researching and these platforms stood out - Coursera Plus and LinkedIn Learning. 
	
	
I‚Äôm torn between going down a branding and digital design route to build confidence and a potential freelance income, or focusing on entrepreneurship and small business management to work toward my long-term dream of running a wellness caf√©/shop. So I was thinking for the next year while I have the time to explore different courses, get back into a routine and expand and regain some skills. 

I guess I‚Äôm just wondering:
Is it too late at 23 to start fresh in the creative world after being out of it so long?
Can anyone recommend a specific course or path that helped them rediscover their creativity or build confidence after a rut? Are any of the subscriptions I mentioned any good? 

Any advice would really mean a lot. I have so much passion and care about creating something meaningful, I just feel completely stuck and unsure where to start.

But last night was different and I am too emotional to be objective right now.

I dreamed I was waking up in my bed and got ready to go to work. I did my normal routine which includes drinking coffee but something about the taste was weird and it suddenly felt as if I was choking. Then I ""woke up"" again.

I got out of bed and remembering what just happened in my dream, I decided to skip coffee. I went about my routine but when I sat down to do my makeup, my face looked weirdly deformed, like melting, in the mirror. I told myself I'm still dreaming and I ""woke up"" again.

I never had more than one dream in a dream so I thought that was it. When I went to the kitchen, my mother in law was sitting at the table and said she had breakfast with my bf and wanted to greet me before leaving and that he already left for work. We chatted a bit and I told her about my dream but she got this uneasy look on her face, so I asked ""I'm still dreaming, aren't I?"" suddenly she began to smile and said ""I thought I got you this time."". Then she started repeating the sentence ""Don't worry, just stay here!"" over and over again while her face started melting. 

I ""woke up"" in my bed again, trembling and sweating. I went to the kitchen where my boyfriend was getting ready for work. I wanted to talk to him about my dream but immediatly I knew something was wrong because he leaves for work a lot earlier than me, when it is still dark out. I yell ""How am I still dreaming?"" and he got the same smile and melting face as his mother in the last dream before saying ""I really thought it would work this time."".

When I ""woke up"" again, it was still dark out. I was exhausted and shaking so I woke my Bf who was still sleeping next to me. I told him about the dreams and that I was scared to fall back asleep and asked if he could stay up with me for a bit until I calmed down. He comforted me and I was about to fall back asleep when he said ""Don't worry, just stay here."". I froze, not daring to look in his face yet. ""You are not real, are you?"" I ask. His voice gets very sweet, but in a sticky, honey trap like way, when he replies ""Of yourse this is real. If you want it to be, this can be real forever. Just don't worry and stay here!"" I looked up to see his face melting again.

Then I woke up for real. The first hour or so, I was scared to look anywhere or touch anything. Only once I left for work I started to calm down and trust that I am awake now. But it's getting late and I'm getting tired but the dream still has me quite shaken and I'm kinda scared to go to sleep not knowing what's going on.

sometimes, its the little things that keeps u going in life talaga. 

i remember a similar moment like 5 years ago. i was having coffee, listening to lana del ray again while just indulging in the moment and appreciating the rain cuz i just love it so much haha. 

its crazy because somehow it feels everything to me. i feel happy, grateful and at peace. even if life isn't exactly okay. but i feel fine and happy rn. even without someone else's company. 

but, i hope i don't give up on life even when things aren't looking so okay rn and i couldn't get a hold of certain things yet. it feels crazy to not get the hang of some things yet, but thats fine naman no? haha im 22 and i feel like im supposed to figure every single thing. i mean, i know that it shouldn't be like that. its ok to be lost and confused and thats really normal and okay. 

sometimes i ask myself, "" ganito nalang ba ako habambuhay?"" although i know that sht is hella stupid because im fully in control of my life. tho i know yeah, obviously there are some things that we got no control over. but at the same time, its like easier said than done. and its inevitable naman talaga to succumb into sadness and confusion. but sometimes i spiral down into it and it drowns and consumes me so much that it feels impossible to swim my way back up. 

i often ask God to just take me because im pagod yeah? hahaha and i literally see no purpose of my existence. but right now im thinking, i hope i still live long enough to see the good days. days where i'd utter to myself na "" oh fuck, im so glad i didn't give up on life kahit halos mamatay nako haha!"" experience good shit( i don't mean drugs lol ) and to meet some genuinely good people who I'd do crazy things with. 

i wanna smile, laugh and live. do you know the kind of laughter thats just so genuine and funny and ure just so so freaking ecstatic that u could literally feel in ur heart that ure fucking happy in that moment. 

sometimes when i burst into laughter, i couldn't help but to say to myself na "" oh wow, its been a while since i made that kind of laugh ha?"" hahahaha lol. 

tho i also missed being happy with someone, that ain't rlly my focus rn. im literally just grateful rn nonetheless and really... really... hopeful.

Hi y‚Äôall. While this sounds a little obnoxious to say, I‚Äôve never really struggled with my diet before since I love healthy foods. I love baking and desserts, too, so I have to watch that, but otherwise I‚Äôm good. Lots of salads, homemade soups, meat and few times a week (fish and fowl only), black coffee and tea, etc. 

Then, I got cancer and while I‚Äôve finished treatment and should be ‚Äúback to normal‚Äù, I‚Äôve discovered that I can no longer tolerate acidic food/drink. I hadn‚Äôt realized it, but all the healthy dishes I love rely on acid to keep them tasty: I used to use balsamic vinegar + olive oil as a salad dressing (sometimes w/out the oil even). Most of my homemade soups/stews were tomato-based bc they‚Äôre cheap and easy. I never added anything to my coffee or black teas and always thought green teas were mild. I‚Äôd add fresh lemon juice to my food often as a way of reducing salt content w/out sacrificing flavor. I could keep going but you get the idea; I took for granted how much I relied on acid to make my food tasty. 

Now, over time, I‚Äôm gaining weight and noticing my diet isn‚Äôt as healthy. I can only use creamy salad dressings, eat cream-based soups, and take my caffeinated beverages w/ creamer. I add cheese to things more often now because I find I‚Äôm more likely to tolerate the dish ‚Äî same goes for bread. I‚Äôve tried to mitigate where I can (thank you vegan recipes!) but it often feels like my food can now be healthy + tasteless or less healthy/more processed + taste good.

1l51kd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/1l51kd3/careermotivation_help/,Career/motivation help,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm 23 and it‚Äôs been around 4 years since I graduated with a first-class degree in Industrial Design. I haven‚Äôt worked in the creative field at all since uni and to be honest, I feel like I‚Äôve forgotten how to be creative altogether. Or if that‚Äôs even my passion, I feel like I‚Äôve lost my why and I have no idea what to do. 

For work previously (I‚Äôve been unemployed for the past couple of years) I‚Äôve done a mix of things: waitressing, working in an acrylic display production team, running a small vinyl/3D printed gift business, the odd logo design here and there,  and co-running a coffee trailer with a friend (which sadly ended when the friendship did; 
the trailer was on their land). Nothing really stuck, and I never built a creative career. I haven‚Äôt worked in quite a while and feel stuck, unmotivated, and like I‚Äôve wasted so much potential. 

That said, I know I love design, especially branding and product ideas that help people. I also love cooking, being outside, geocaching, mental health advocacy, and health-focused food. My dream one day is to open a small caf√©, food trailer, or shop with a wellbeing focus ‚Äî maybe even offer branding help for other small businesses alongside it.

I miss learning and structure so much. I thrived at university with briefs, direction, and goals. Without that, I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôm just floating, unsure where to even begin rebuilding my skills or confidence.

It‚Äôs my birthday soon, and my parents want to help pay for an online course or subscription to help me get back on track. I‚Äôve been researching and these platforms stood out:
	
	‚Ä¢	Coursera Plus ‚Äì university-level courses in entrepreneurship, business, and design with proper certificates
	‚Ä¢	LinkedIn Learning ‚Äì good for professional skills, personal development, and showing certificates on your profile
	
I‚Äôm torn between going down a branding and digital design route to build confidence and a potential freelance income‚Ä¶ or focusing on entrepreneurship and small business management to work toward my long-term dream of running a wellness caf√©/shop. So I was thinking for the next year while I have the time to explore different courses, get back into a routine and expand and regain some skills. 

I guess I‚Äôm just wondering:

1l51k24,https://i.redd.it/bfic3d1r1d5f1.jpeg,"Four Scents, One Nose, and Zero Chill","I tested four popular men's fragrances‚Äîsome hyped, some forgotten, all sprayed in the name of curiosity (and maybe a little judgment). With a little money burning a hole in my pocket, I was ready to fall in love. Here‚Äôs how they stacked up, from the one I actually bought to the one I forgot I even tried.

# Polo Red Eau de Toilette: The One That Earned a Second Date

Of the four scents I tried, Polo Red Eau de Toilette was the one I liked best. Which is funny, because when I first sprayed it, I wasn‚Äôt impressed. It came off flat and a little blah‚Äînothing offensive, but nothing exciting either. But after about 30 minutes, it settled into something warm, smooth, and actually pretty likable.

The cranberry note stands out in a good way‚Äînot fresh or juicy, but richer and deeper, like a dried cranberry that‚Äôs been hanging out with some oak and flattering lighting. The citrus adds just enough brightness to keep things from getting too heavy, while the wood and coffee notes bring in a low-key richness. The coffee note doesn‚Äôt make it smell like you just left Starbucks, but it adds a cozy, roasted warmth in the background. You‚Äôll barely notice it, but it plays peek-a-boo‚Äîjust enough to keep things interesting.

The amber is what ties it all together and gives the scent that soft, slightly luxurious feel. What I appreciated most was the balance‚Äîno single note takes over, and everything feels well-blended and easy to wear.

It lasted about six hours on my skin, which made it the best performer out of the four I tested. I liked it enough to buy a full bottle (found it on sale for $32 at The Perfume Spot). If it had cost much more than that, I probably would‚Äôve passed‚Äîbut at that price, it was a nice addition to my collection. Besides, I didn‚Äôt have anything in a red bottle.

***Rating: 8/10***

A laid-back, easygoing scent that gets better with time. Balanced, quietly confident, and a solid value if you catch it on sale.

# Coach for Men: Here for a Good Time, Not a Long Time

Of the four fragrances I tested, Coach for Men kept me guessing the most. I liked it, then I didn‚Äôt, then I sort of did again. It‚Äôs a bit of a rollercoaster‚Äîbut not the kind that ends in regret. Just the kind that makes you think, ‚ÄúOkay, maybe one more ride, but with full sprays next time.‚Äù It was the most tolerable of the Coach lineup I‚Äôve tried‚Äînot a major accomplishment, considering Coach Blue and Coach Green were just average scents with weak longevity.

Classified as a woody aromatic, it‚Äôs masculine without being douchey‚Äîlike it knows what cologne is, but doesn‚Äôt spray it in a gym locker room. The pear note is unique‚Äîit softens things and gives it a smooth, almost flat feel. Then the bergamot and kumquat crash the party with a sharp citrusy hit that cuts through the calm. The lavender adds a little polish, but not in a way that makes it smell like a bar of hotel soap.

I never thought I‚Äôd be into leather notes, but I‚Äôm starting to appreciate them. Here, the leather is smooth and grown-up, adding some subtle depth and just enough edge. It‚Äôs masculine in a way that feels confident but not try-hard. There‚Äôs also ambergris in the mix, supposedly‚Äîbut honestly, I don‚Äôt even know what that smells like. If it‚Äôs doing something, good for it.

It lasted about six hours on my skin, then pulled a complete disappearing act‚Äîeven on my clothes. Would I buy it? Maybe if the price is right. It‚Äôs inoffensive, wearable, and better than I expected from Coach, but still not something I‚Äôd go out of my way for. It‚Äôs a safe scent‚Äîclean, masculine, a little citrusy, a little leathery‚Äîbut not all that distinctive. Sort of like a Coach handbag‚Äîit‚Äôs fine, but it‚Äôs not a Chanel.

***Rating: 7/10***

Solid, middle-of-the-road, and completely unmemorable in the best possible way. Like cologne for someone who doesn‚Äôt really wear cologne‚Äîbut wants to try.

# Versace Pour Homme: Inoffensive, Unmemorable, Unbothered

Of the four fragrances I tested, this one left the faintest impression‚Äîif you can even call it that. I don‚Äôt know what the big whoptido is about. It came and went so fast I barely got to form an opinion. No wow factor on the opening, no payoff in the drydown. It just‚Ä¶ existed.

And honestly, based on the scent notes and the fact that it‚Äôs an aromatic foug√®re, I should have liked it. But it opens too sharp for me‚Äîheavy on the lemon and bergamot‚Äîand the neroli (my most hated note) does nothing to help. I kept waiting for the rose, amber, or tonka bean to come in and smooth things out, but they never really showed up. Just a lot of bright citrus and a hint of disappointment.

People like to compare this to Chanel Allure Homme Sport, but I don‚Äôt get that at all. Where Chanel feels polished and layered, this feels like something you'd get handed in a gift set alongside a deodorant stick and a washcloth. It‚Äôs giving ‚Äúfirst cologne you ever wore to a job interview in college.‚Äù

I know I‚Äôll get hate for this, but right now it feels like cologne for people who aren‚Äôt totally sure they want to wear cologne. Longevity? Average. Maybe four hours, if I‚Äôm being generous. I‚Äôll give it one more shot with full sprays, just to be fair. I want to like it‚Äîbut so far, I don‚Äôt.

***Rating: 5/10***

Not offensive, not interesting. Just floating somewhere in the middle of the fragrance universe doing absolutely nothing.

# Polo Black Eau de Toilette: It Looked Better in the Bottle

Of the four I tested, this is the one I almost forgot I tried‚Äîwhich probably says more than the fragrance itself. I expected something warm, woodsy, maybe a little fruity. I was especially curious about the mango note. But if there‚Äôs mango in here, it‚Äôs in the witness protection program. What I got was mostly tangerine, tonka, and woods. Not terrible, just‚Ä¶ forgettable.

Sillage? Barely there. Longevity? Also barely there. It felt like one of those colognes that disappears the moment you start to like it‚Äîwhich in this case, never really happened. I wanted to like this one because the black bottle would match my wardrobe (i.e., my 1,000 black T-shirts and polos). And no, none of my polo shirts have the little horse on them. They‚Äôre just black. Like my coffee. And now, my fragrance regret.

Would I try it again? Sure, with a few more sprays‚Äîmostly to see if it shows up to work this time. At this point, the salespeople at Ulta probably think I‚Äôm a vagrant coming in for free fragrance hits, which is only half true.

***Rating: 5/10***

I‚Äôm not mad at it‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt remember it. Which might be worse.

# Final Thoughts

So, what do you think‚Äîdid I nail it, totally miss the mark, or just offend your signature scent? Let‚Äôs hear it. Maybe you love the one I forgot existed. Maybe I disrespected your ride-or-die fragrance. Maybe you also bought Polo Red because it was $32 and came in a cool bottle. No judgment (okay, maybe a little).

I‚Äôm 21 years old with intense adhd and problems with my mental health so my apartment is most of the time a complete mess. (Which is also why this post might me a bit chaotic and not very well written, I apologize) 
My dad -an adult baby who thought he didn‚Äôt need a read vacuum if he had a robot one, and has the most disgusting bathroom I‚Äôve ever seen - lives in a different city and comes and sleeps on my couch almost every weekend. my siblings and mom thinks it‚Äôs insane that I dont go crazy with him here every weekend but honestly I don‚Äôt wanna hurt his feelings saying he can‚Äôt come here, especially because he gives me coffee and breakfast in bed when he‚Äôs here, hes a nice guy. 

Anyways, I feel very self conscious about how my apartment looks and at times the self hatred is so intense I don‚Äôt know how to go forward. It has been a continuous issue that my dad will tell me that it‚Äôs dirty here, and when I do clean he will compliment me, which for me doesn‚Äôt feel good hearing, I don‚Äôt really know why but it makes me feel so small and horrible every time he says it. but because I know it comes from a good place I have always just said the normal uncomfortable thank you and keep my discomfort to myself. 
A year ago or so when he did this again I decided that the healthy thing is I guess to just say that it makes me uncomfortable, that I understand he doesn‚Äôt mean anything bad, but that I wish he didn‚Äôt say that again. He began basically arguing with me about how that was irrational, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm giving you a compliment‚Äù and the fact that it isn‚Äôt perceived as a compliment to me apparently doesn‚Äôt matter to him. 
After this, it kept happening, I kept saying to him that I told you I don‚Äôt like it and basically begging him to stop which lead to a discussion about how again that it‚Äôs a compliment and that It‚Äôs a normal thing to say. After a year of this happening constantly I started getting upset, which he actually laughed at multiple times while I was visibly mad at him -because in his mind this was a normal thing and that I should accept it. 
A while ago this continuous issue of him not listening to me built up and I just snapped. I‚Äôm not proud of it but I screamed at him, asking why the fuck he cant respect me, and why he feels like he wants to say things that I perceive as mean, even if he doesn‚Äôt.
I don‚Äôt know why it makes me so upset hearing this, but in my mind that really doesn‚Äôt matter, I told him I didn‚Äôt like it. If he wasn‚Äôt my dad I wouldn‚Äôt have said anything and I feel like he should maybe be the person who shouldn‚Äôt wanna say things that I find upsetting, And I should be able to tell him and he should respect that no?

He is a good guy and extremely sensitive, just misguided and quite often says insensitive things not because he‚Äôs being mean but because he just doesn‚Äôt think. Like he lets his and my siblings relationship suffer, not making plans or hanging out with them -not because he doesn‚Äôt care , but because he genuinely thinks they just don‚Äôt want to even tho they haven‚Äôt given him a reason to think so.

- I've had the ZP6 for only a month. Before that, I was using a kingrinder K2 for maybe a year and a half? The drawdowns are _fast_ . I'm still getting used to it.

Now, onto my latest attempt:

15g of freshly ground coffee

Finer grind

Manual tamp (as even as I could)

Basket and cylinder sealed well


Result:
This time, the pressure gauge moved up close to the espresso range for just 1‚Äì2 seconds and then dropped back down quickly. The shot was better, still not perfect, but way closer to what I expected.

Now I‚Äôm wondering:
üëâ Is that quick pressure spike and drop normal, or does that indicate another issue?

Presentation & Cold Draw

Right out of the box, the Alma del Fuego Toro makes a bold first impression. The reddish-hued wrapper glistens with oils and looks like burnished mahogany in the light. Construction is pristine; firm with no soft spots, tight seams, and a triple cap that says this was rolled with care.

On the cold draw: sweet earth, cocoa powder, cinnamon and a whisper of sweetness reminding me of raisins. There‚Äôs also a bit of damp volcanic soil in the aroma - distinctive and very Ometepe. The pull is perfect: not too tight, not too loose.


First Third ‚Äì Intense and Charismatic

The opening is assertive yet controlled, with immediate notes of roasted coffee, cracked black pepper, and smoked paprika. The smoke is thick and chewy, coating the palate with every draw. There's a dry red wine character to the retrohale‚Äîtannic and spicy, but in a good way.

As the ember builds, molasses sweetness and dark fruit begin to creep in, offering a welcome contrast to the spicy edges. The burn line is sharp and the ash builds in tight, white stacks. This is a medium to full-bodied start, no doubt - but it‚Äôs not aggression for aggression‚Äôs sake. There‚Äôs depth behind the muscle.

Second Third ‚Äì Deep, Earthy Complexity

This is where the soul of fire truly starts to show. Charred oak, mineral-rich earth, and semi-sweet chocolate come into focus. The pepper dials down just enough to let baking spices, burnt sugar and a leathery undertone shine through.

The retrohale softens into nutmeg and clove, and the smoke texture becomes even creamier. There‚Äôs still heat, but it‚Äôs measured now. Construction remains impeccable. No relights, no corrections, just solid craftsmanship.


Final Third ‚Äì Ember to Ash

As the final third begins, the Alma del Fuego Toro ramps back up; espresso, toasted walnut and a spicy cedar note lead the way. A touch of salted dark chocolate sneaks in, keeping things balanced and preventing palate fatigue.

The peppery finish returns, but now it‚Äôs rounded out, more integrated. You feel the strength, but it‚Äôs not overpowering - it‚Äôs elegant. The cigar burns cool to the nub, maintaining flavor and composure until the very end. Not a hint of harshness.


Final Thoughts

The Plasencia Alma del Fuego Toro is a cigar that tells a story of volcanic soil, fiery strength, and soulful balance. It‚Äôs intense, yes, but never chaotic. It‚Äôs the kind of cigar that demands your attention, not just because of its flavor, but because of the thought that clearly went into its creation.

Clocking in at about 90‚Äì100 minutes, it‚Äôs a journey - best enjoyed when you have the time to sit, reflect, and appreciate the details. Would I smoke it again? Absolutely. It‚Äôs not a daily cigar - it‚Äôs a statement cigar, ideal for when you want boldness with brains and heart.

Right out of the box, the Alma del Fuego Toro makes a bold first impression. The reddish-hued wrapper glistens with oils and looks like burnished mahogany in the light. Construction is pristine; firm with no soft spots, tight seams, and a triple cap that says this was rolled with care.

On the cold draw: sweet earth, cocoa powder, cinnamon and a whisper of sweetness reminding me of raisins. There‚Äôs also a bit of damp volcanic soil in the aroma - distinctive and very Ometepe. The pull is perfect: not too tight, not too loose.


First Third ‚Äì Intense and Charismatic

The opening is assertive yet controlled, with immediate notes of roasted coffee, cracked black pepper, and smoked paprika. The smoke is thick and chewy, coating the palate with every draw. There's a dry red wine character to the retrohale‚Äîtannic and spicy, but in a good way.

As the ember builds, molasses sweetness and dark fruit begin to creep in, offering a welcome contrast to the spicy edges. The burn line is sharp and the ash builds in tight, white stacks. This is a medium to full-bodied start, no doubt - but it‚Äôs not aggression for aggression‚Äôs sake. There‚Äôs depth behind the muscle.

Second Third ‚Äì Deep, Earthy Complexity

This is where the soul of fire truly starts to show. Charred oak, mineral-rich earth, and semi-sweet chocolate come into focus. The pepper dials down just enough to let baking spices, burnt sugar and a leathery undertone shine through.

The retrohale softens into nutmeg and clove, and the smoke texture becomes even creamier. There‚Äôs still heat, but it‚Äôs measured now. Construction remains impeccable. No relights, no corrections, just solid craftsmanship.


Final Third ‚Äì Ember to Ash

As the final third begins, the Alma del Fuego Toro ramps back up; espresso, toasted walnut and a spicy cedar note lead the way. A touch of salted dark chocolate sneaks in, keeping things balanced and preventing palate fatigue.

The peppery finish returns, but now it‚Äôs rounded out, more integrated. You feel the strength, but it‚Äôs not overpowering - it‚Äôs elegant. The cigar burns cool to the nub, maintaining flavor and composure until the very end. Not a hint of harshness.


Final Thoughts

The Plasencia Alma del Fuego Toro is a cigar that tells a story of volcanic soil, fiery strength, and soulful balance. It‚Äôs intense, yes, but never chaotic. It‚Äôs the kind of cigar that demands your attention, not just because of its flavor, but because of the thought that clearly went into its creation.

Clocking in at about 90‚Äì100 minutes, it‚Äôs a journey - best enjoyed when you have the time to sit, reflect, and appreciate the details. Would I smoke it again? Absolutely. It‚Äôs not a daily cigar - it‚Äôs a statement cigar, ideal for when you want boldness with brains and heart.

VASODILATION IN CANNABIS EXPLAINED



At some point, you must have experienced a bloated face,¬† red and puffy eyes, as well as dehydrated skin after smoking‚Ä¶

Have you ever stopped to think and ask yourself why this happens whenever you smoke?

Or do you attribute it to the smoke irritation from the cannabis being used‚Ä¶ if you do, then you're wrong. The term for this occurrence is ""VASODILATION"". Read on to find out more about vasodilation due to the usage of cannabis, its effects on our body, and how to mask It.

# What is Vasodilation?

The word "" vasodilation"" is used to describe the opening up of the body's blood vessels. It is the opposite of ""vasoconstriction"" where the blood vessels close up within the body.

Vasodilation is a temporary situation that occurs when cannabis is ingested into the body. Although, it doesn't necessarily occur only when cannabis is consumed.

Medics define vasodilation as a body's natural response to an increase in body temperature or reduced oxygen levels.

When cannabis is consumed, blood flow to some parts of the body is restricted or reduced. Oxygen transportation is also slowed down and not quickly delivered to the body organs that need it most.

The easiest way to know this is happening is by the obvious reddening of the eyes, as well as the puffy/bloated face of the user. Unfortunately, many are not aware of this physiological mechanism, so they pin it on smoke irritation.

Some medical practitioners prescribe cannabis-based medications to patients suffering from glaucoma, high blood pressure, etc. This is because of the vasodilating response that would be induced by these drugs to help lower the blood pressure.

# Vasodilation and Cannabis

While researchers have been able to find useful medical applications for cannabis in the human body, they have still not discovered the full extent of the effects of cannabis consumption on other organs in the body. And the risks involved are most times underestimated. The vasodilating effects of cannabis are one of the physiological responses of the body that has been investigated.

# What Makes Cannabis a¬†Vasodilator?

THC ‚Äì Tetrahydrocannabinol ‚Äì Is the main psychoactive element present in cannabis. It is the agent that causes a noticeable increase in the heart rate, as well as a lowered blood pressure.

Another vasodilating effect is dizziness. This is because THC reacts with cannabinoid receptors present around the body, most especially the eyes to induce these effects.

Although THC is not the only cannabinoid responsible for all these, it is responsible for the bulk of these reactions.

The amount of THC present in the cannabis strain ingested determines the extent of vasodilation in the user's body.

For example, consuming a cannabis strain with less than 15% THC might result in little or no noticeable reddening of the eyes, compared to consuming over 30% THC cannabis strain. It also depends on the user's tolerance, because everyone's body anatomy is unique.

# Reddening of the eyes is due to...

The main¬†[reason your eyes get red](https://cannabis.net/blog/smoke/why-getting-stoned-gives-you-red-eyes-and-how-to-deal-with-it)‚Äî or bloodshot and bloated when you use marijuana is due to vasodilation being set off by THC and other cannabinoids present in cannabis. When your eyes redden and get puffy, it indicates that there is an increased blood flow to your eyeball due to the dilation of blood vessels and capillaries around the eye area.

After the effects of the drugs begin to wear off, the capillaries and blood vessels gradually begin to close off and constrict. Till everything is back to normal.

# Can Vasodilation Be Halted?

Vasodilation is a subconscious response, hence it cannot be prevented from occurring. Neither can it be halted when it has started. It only stops when the last effects of cannabis wear off in the body. You have zero control over the workings of vasodilation, nor vasoconstriction.

However, you can put in the effort to mask/cover up the effects of using cannabis by hiding your bloated face and puffy eyes.

# Masking Vasodilation

Like I mentioned above vasodilation can't be stopped, however with a few techniques you can effectively mask the signs. Here are some ways you can hide your puffy reds eyes effectively

**Eye drops‚ÄîAllergy and Artificial:**¬†Allergy drops help with bloodshot eyes. It effectively reduces discomfort and redness. If it is itchy, it also helps soothe the eyes. Artificial teardrops can also help, although it is not as efficient as allergy eye drops, which is not surprising.

Both drops contain Tetryzoline, which acts as a constricting agent for the blood vessels

Both drops are easy to get at the nearest pharmacy over the counter...

**Using Sunglasses:**¬†This is a perfect way to hide the use of marijuana, especially when in a public gathering with people you do not stare at your bloodshot eyes.

For example, you can use it for a lecture in college. It's simple, less expensive, and fast to just pick your glasses, put them on and go about basking in your high. The only downside to this is that you cannot wear sunglasses at night, so as not to damage your eyesight.

**Doing away with caffeinated drink**: Coffee is also like cannabis, they are both vasodilators.

Stay hydrated.

Take a very cold bath if you can or put ice bags over your eyes.

**Calmly wait for symptoms to subside:**¬†The redness will even be reduced and everything will go back to normal. The duration may vary from 1-12 hours depending on your body's tolerance, weight, metabolism. And the strain and dose of cannabis ingested.

Choose strains of cannabis with low THC.

# Bottom Line

There you have it, why the white of your eyes gets reddened after the consumption of cannabis. If you still have doubts, you can carry out practice on yourself. However, you have to ingest cannabis without smoking it ‚Äîto cancel the doubt of the reaction being due to smoke irritation.

You can ingest the marijuana by eating edibles infused with THC. Then watch out for the reddening of your eyes.

Have fun and enjoy your baked face‚Ä¶

Don't forget, you can use any of the methods given above to mask the effects of vasodilation.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Many people struggle to lose weight easily. What if a drink could make this hard task a bit less difficult? Matcha green tea gets much attention for helping the body. People talk about it for health and possibly for losing extra weight. I wonder, does science say this is true? This writing looks at if matcha can help weight loss. It uses ideas from studies and research papers. I will explain how this green powder might assist your body. You will learn about what is inside matcha that may work. This is not a magic fix, but it could be a useful tool.

What is Matcha Green Tea and How Does it Differ?
------------------------------------------------

Matcha is not like the normal green tea leaves you put in hot water. It comes from tea plants grown in a special way. Workers cover the plants near harvest time. This makes the leaves have more good parts. After picking, they grind the leaves very fine. You get a bright green powder. With regular tea, you steep leaves and throw them away. With matcha, you mix the powder in water and drink all of it. This means you take in everything from the leaf. It has more good things inside because of this method.

The Key Compounds in Matcha for Weight Loss
-------------------------------------------

Matcha has important natural parts that connect to body work. These parts might help how your body uses food for energy. Two main things stand out. One is a strong substance called EGCG. The other is caffeine. You know caffeine from coffee, but it works a little differently here. These two things work together in matcha. They come in higher amounts than in regular brewed green tea. This high level of these parts makes matcha special for health. I will explain more about them next.

EGCG: The Metabolism Booster
----------------------------

A key part in matcha is called EGCG. Its full name is long, Epigallocatechin gallate. It is a type of strong helper for the body. EGCG is known as a powerful antioxidant. Scientists study how EGCG affects the body's speed of using energy. This speed is called metabolism. Some studies show EGCG can help the body burn fat better. It might help the body use fat for energy, especially during body movement. This compound is much higher in matcha powder than in regular green tea liquid.

Caffeine: Energy and Calorie Burning
------------------------------------

Matcha also contains caffeine. This natural substance gives energy to people. Caffeine makes you feel more awake and ready for action. It can also make your body burn more calories. When your body burns more calories, it can help with weight loss. Caffeine might help your body break down fat to use. The amount of caffeine in matcha can change. It is often less than coffee but more than most regular green teas. This gives a good boost without too much jittery feeling for many people.

How Matcha May Support Your Weight Loss Goals
---------------------------------------------

Drinking matcha green tea might help you lose weight in some ways. The EGCG and caffeine together can help your body burn energy faster. This means you use more calories in a day. Some reports say drinking matcha before exercise helps your body use fat for fuel. It may help release fat to be burned. But remember, this works best with eating healthy food and moving your body often. Matcha is a helper, not the only answer for losing pounds.

Incorporating Matcha Green Tea into a Weight Loss Plan
------------------------------------------------------

Putting matcha into your plan is simple. You can drink it hot like tea or cold. Add the powder to water or milk for a drink. You can also put it in smoothies or food recipes. How much to use? Maybe one or two cups each day is good. Drink it in the morning or before you do exercise. Choose good quality matcha for the best results. Do not add too much sugar or sweet things to it. This will add extra calories you do not need for losing weight.

Matcha vs. Regular Green Tea for Weight Loss
--------------------------------------------

Both matcha and regular green tea come from the same plant. But they are different for helping weight loss. Matcha has much more EGCG and other good parts. When you drink brewed green tea, you steep leaves and throw them away. You only get some of the good things. With matcha powder, you drink the whole leaf. So you get all the EGCG and caffeine. This means matcha might give a stronger effect for metabolism and fat burning than regular green tea.

Other Health Benefits of Matcha
-------------------------------

Matcha does more than possibly help with weight loss. It is very good for your body in other ways. It is full of helpers called antioxidants. These fight bad things in your body that cause problems. Matcha has a very high amount of these helpers. It also has something special called L-Theanine. This is an amino acid. L-Theanine helps you feel calm but also focused. It can reduce feeling stressed. Less stress helps you make better choices for eating and moving your body.

Conclusion: Making Matcha Part of Your Healthy Lifestyle
--------------------------------------------------------

Matcha green tea seems like a good helper if you want to lose weight. It is not a magic trick alone. But it has special parts like EGCG and caffeine. These can help your body burn energy and maybe fat. It also makes you feel calm and focused. Adding good quality matcha to your daily habit is a good idea. Use it with healthy eating and moving your body. It is a strong drink for your health and journey to feel better.

You hear that a lot, but for me, it wasn‚Äôt just the limp or the burns. Yeah... those healed. It was the silence.

After the IED hit our convoy outside Mosul, everything felt muted. I lost two good friends that day. Guys I‚Äôd bunked with, laughed with, saved meals for. The only reason I wasn‚Äôt in that Humvee was because I‚Äôd twisted my knee the night before on a shitty foot patrol.

Survivor‚Äôs guilt doesn‚Äôt scream. It whispers, all night long, and it doesn't let you sleep.

I came home on medical leave and drifted through the days, avoiding everyone. My mom cried every time I entered the room. I stopped entering.

One weekend, I ended up at a little county hobby fair with my niece. One of those things you do to kill time. That‚Äôs where I saw the table of old radios. Big analog rigs. Dials, antennas, wires. A mess of forgotten frequencies.

The guy running the booth had picked up a bunch of gear from an estate sale. I was alone, rummaging through a pile of dark green army equipment, when I found two closed boxes under the table, stashed beneath a folded tarp.

The boxes were beat to hell but solid. Heavy, too‚Äîlike they remembered being carried through mud and sand. One had a faded stencil on the side: PRC-104A.

My gut tightened. That was a manpack HF radio we used on patrol. Rugged. Heavy. Ugly. But reliable. The kind of thing that kept you connected when the world was falling apart.

I brushed off the dust and cracked the latches. Inside, the radio sat nestled like it never left service. Coiled cables, connectors, a faint whiff of oxidized metal and canvas.

The vendor wandered over, holding a foam cup.

‚ÄúPicked that up in a barn. No idea if it works,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat any good?‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúMaybe. Looks military.‚Äù

He nodded like that was enough. ‚ÄúFifty bucks. Take it off my hands.‚Äù

I handed him the cash. My niece rolled her eyes and asked if I was planning to invade the neighbor‚Äôs yard.

Back home, I stashed it in the garage. Meant to leave it there. But that night, when the house was too quiet and the bed too empty, I ended up out there again, flashlight in one hand, uncoiling cables with the other.

The weird part? Everything fit. I had a spare power supply from an old battery kit. A high school ham antenna rig in a dusty toolbox. Some online schematics filled in the blanks.

When I flipped the switch, the thing came alive. A dull green glow lit the panel. No noise‚Äîjust static. A heartbeat in the dark.

A few days later, Kev came by. Retired Army Signal Corps. One of the sharpest comms guys I ever knew.

He stared at the unit like it had just spoken his name.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd you find this?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúFairgrounds. Old gear table.‚Äù

He ran a hand over the solder joints, the old switches. Then he stopped.

‚ÄúSomeone modded this. That‚Äôs not standard military. That‚Äôs a civilian transceiver circuit spliced into the main power. And this switch? Field override. You could transmit on anything with this.‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúTransmit where?‚Äù

Kev looked at me, dead serious. ‚ÄúAnywhere. Longwave. Shortwave. Military. Civilian. You don‚Äôt have a license, do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Haven‚Äôt even used it. Just listening.‚Äù

He nodded, but kept looking at the radio like it might bite.

‚ÄúGood. Don‚Äôt mess with it too much. These were patched into secure nets sometimes. And if someone‚Äôs still out there listening... you don‚Äôt want to be the guy who wakes them up.‚Äù

He left me with that and didn‚Äôt bring it up again.

I didn‚Äôt touch it for a week.

Instead, I walked. Just wandered town with my hands in my pockets. Stopped by the Army surplus, the diner where they still called me ‚ÄúGunny.‚Äù Watched kids play in the park. Thought about what Nick and Torres would‚Äôve said if they‚Äôd made it home.

My VA counselor, Karen, had been trying to get me to ‚Äúengage.‚Äù Her word. I liked her because she didn‚Äôt talk too much. She just asked the right questions and listened. She told me to try doing one thing that felt like me again.

I didn‚Äôt know what that was. But that radio... maybe that was close.

So I started listening.

Most nights, I‚Äôd sit in the garage with a mug of reheated coffee and just spin the dial. Local police bands, random truckers, weird gospel preachers from nowhere. A lot of noise. But also life.

I started keeping a notebook. Logging weird frequencies. Bits of voice I didn‚Äôt recognize. Air traffic. Spanish chatter. Weather reports. Old jazz stations bleeding in from the coasts.

It felt good. Like brushing dust off the world.

And then, one night, I fell asleep out there.

I must‚Äôve nodded off in the chair, pen still in hand, radio murmuring beneath the static. It had been a long day. Group therapy was heavy. Some guy cried. I almost did too.

Sometime near 3 a.m., I heard it.

A single word.

‚ÄúGunny.‚Äù

Soft. Flat. Clear.

I sat up so fast the chair nearly tipped. The pen hit the floor. The garage was still.

Just static now.

My call sign. I hadn‚Äôt heard it since Mosul. No one at home used it. Not Karen. Not even Kev.

I told myself it was a dream. A trick of the brain. I was tired. That‚Äôs all.

But I didn‚Äôt go back out there the next night. Or the night after.

And the old weight crept back in. The heaviness behind my ribs. The kind of silence that hums louder than any noise.

So I went back.

The garage was cold. I brought a blanket. A fresh cup of coffee I barely touched. I turned on the radio and let it warm up. That soft green glow blinked to life.

The static was steady. Nothing strange.

I spun the dial.

Chatter. Dispatchers. A guy listing off road conditions somewhere in Kansas. A woman laughing, probably on a baby monitor too close to a tower.

Then‚Äînothing.

Every band I checked was empty.

Just static.

I turned the antenna. Swapped cables. Kicked the side of the bench. Still nothing. The clock ticked past three. And somewhere in there, I must‚Äôve nodded off again.

Because the static shifted.

It thinned. Like mist burning off in sunlight.

And then I heard them.

Nick first. His voice was tired but warm. Like he always sounded when we were two hours into a night patrol.

‚ÄúHey, brother. Took you long enough.‚Äù

Then Torres. That familiar laugh in his voice.

‚ÄúMan, you look like shit.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt speak.

Nick went on. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt blame you. We never did. That knee? That wasn‚Äôt your fault.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still here,‚Äù Torres said. ‚ÄúThat means something. You get to be here.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt an echo. It wasn‚Äôt a hallucination. It was them. Just like they used to talk to me, back when it was dark and hot and loud and we were scared but together.

‚ÄúWe see you, Gunny,‚Äù Nick said. ‚ÄúEven when you think you‚Äôre invisible.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou carry us,‚Äù Torres added. ‚ÄúWe know. But you gotta carry yourself too.‚Äù

I cried. I didn‚Äôt care.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay to live,‚Äù Nick said. ‚ÄúHell, it‚Äôs good to live.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got more in you, brother. We believe in you.‚Äù

Their voices faded like smoke. A few last words.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt wait anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre good, man.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe love you.‚Äù

And then just static.

I woke up at the bench. Face wet. Hands clenched around the table. The clock said 4:12.

The radio crackled faintly. Air traffic. A CB argument about chicken trucks. The world was back.

But I was different.

That was two years ago.

currently using Concerta 54mg 1 per day (extended release methylphenidate), Effexor/Venegis 150 mg 1 per day (extended release venlafaxine) and 1-2 per day Tranko-Buskas 10+10mg Medapezam and Hyoscine butylbromide.

I also consume coffee and cigarettes regularly and alcohol semi regularly (I try to be very strict about my alcohol use but idk how effective I actually am)

36 days ago I experienced a very severe anxiety attack and decided to keep a mood tracker mainly based around my anxiety levels, which actually came in really handy.

33 days ago, I went to an appointment with my psychiatrist and was prescribed Medazepam to use once daily or twice if I needed. I mostly used it once per day.

First week of my using it was amazing: low overall anxiety levels, just a great time in general. Second week was a bit bumpy but we thought that was due to changes in my routine and lifestyle.

Then at the end of the second week I had a very severe anxiety attack, which my psychiatrist told was actually a panic attack (yay more problems!) but we decided to manage symptoms through breathing exercises and distractions. I also started taking Medazepam twice daily more often than before. It partially worked.

These last two weeks have been just awful though: I‚Äôm extremely angry and very easily irritated and I also started contemplating suicide, both of which had not happened for a long time. I‚Äôm constantly feeling anxious to the point where I cannot even study despite having final exams a couple of days later. I‚Äôm paranoid, I get lost in thought a lot, experience mental fog and have trouble finding words and such. I‚Äôve also been experiencing eye irritation the entire period I used this drug.

I thought all of these were caused by changes in my routine (classes ended and I‚Äôm on a short break before exams start) and other stuff. It wasn‚Äôt until I stumbled upon a random reddit thread talking about benzo addiction that I considered Medazepam might be the cause.

Thanks to my mood tracker, everything seems to match perfectly with withdrawal/extended use symptoms. 

I will be having an appointment with my psychiatrist at the soonest possible time but in the meantime I want to stop using this drug. I think I‚Äôm kinda lucky because 30 days is listed as an acceptable duration to use the drug in some cases, plus my dose is low and I tried not to take more than I had to, so I think I can quit cold turkey but I just wanted to ask beforehand.

It‚Äôs just awful: I have a problem, I find a solution but then the solution itself becomes a problem.

I recently made some shea butter lotion and it turned out great.  I'm trying to modify it to use coffee butter, but this is the second batch that hasn't turned out.  

My recipe:

700g water

150g soybean oil

80 grams coffee butter (or shea butter as used before)

50g emulsifying wax

30g stearic acid

15g optiphen plus

10g fragrance oil



My process:

Melt oil, butter, wax, and stearic acid.  Warm water.  Add optiphen plus at 120\*(as stated on bottle).  Blend when both oils  and water are within 10 degrees of each other.  I did it at 120\* this time, which might have been too hot.  I think my oils might have been cooler the last time I made it.  Add fragrance oil while emulsifying.

Like I said, with the shea butter alone it worked out perfectly.  But I got some coffee butter off amazon and it's just not emulsifying.  The ingredients say shea butter & coffee beans.  But I know that might not be true.   It got really foamy and appeared emulsified, but as it cooled down it started to separate.  I blended the mixture probably ten minutes.  Any ideas?  I might just make the shea butter alone again.  I have 5lbs. of this coffee butter, so I really wanted to it for lotion.  I make soap too, and I'm afraid of using it for that.",1,1749237196.0,DIYBeauty,4,1.0,False

I‚Äôm looking for someone to hang out with‚Äîsomeone who doesn‚Äôt take themselves too seriously but still knows how to be kind, empathetic, and respectful of people‚Äôs limits. I‚Äôve been trying to make more meaningful friendships in this city, but honestly‚Ä¶ everyone seems busy or hard to reach lately (i hope you can relate lol)

I have ADHD and can be super bubbly and chatty when I vibe with someone‚Äîso if you‚Äôve got good energy and can match that, we‚Äôll probably get along great.

At the moment, I have to wear a pirate-style eye patch due to a medical thing (ahoy matey), which has been a bit of a hit to my self-esteem. But otherwise, I‚Äôm feeling good physically‚Äîjust need a reason to get out and connect.

I‚Äôm specifically looking for platonic friendship‚Äîso if you‚Äôre hoping for FWB or anything romantic, this won‚Äôt be the right fit. I know it‚Äôs a bit awkward to spell out, but it matters to me for personal reasons. Ideally, I‚Äôd love to connect with a hetero female or someone aromantic/asexual, but I‚Äôm open as long as we‚Äôre both on the same page about the friendship-only thing.

I‚Äôm a little immature for my age in the best way‚ÄîI like seeing the world with childlike curiosity. I won‚Äôt ask for favors or money‚ÄîI‚Äôm just genuinely excited to meet someone who loves random niche interests like geography, history, physics, or anything obscure and fun.

Let‚Äôs share our fun interests while we craft, sip tea or coffee, go hiking, do some light thrifting or urban wandering, or take photos. I especially love collecting seashells and painting them. I usually take public transport or scoot around on my electric scooter, and if we ever go on a longer trip, I‚Äôll always offer to split gas.

If this sounds like your kind of vibe, feel free to DM me! Let‚Äôs see if we click ^_^ :) :) :)",1,1749236375.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

Title says it all. I either just nailed that test or bombed it. Did everything right yesterday by taking the day off after my 3 months of dedicated prep to relax and just play some video games/hit the gym. P/ts sitting between 160-165, so vibes were immaculate.

 This morning, I got a call that I needed to pop in to the doctor to pick up some medical forms I had been waiting on at 8:00. No biggie, test is at 11:15, so I'll just use it as an excuse to get coffee. 

  
Sike. 

Ended up getting my blood drawn for tests, had to run all over the medical center (military) getting paperwork signed by various doctors (optometry, dental, etc) and finally got everything done at 10:30. The hospital was right at 30 minutes from my testing center so I got there just in time to change out of uniform in the bathroom, get signed in, and start my test. 

Only flagged like 2 questions per section, so we're deep in ""fuck it, we ball"" territory. Here's to next time (maybe). 

To add: obviously, hindsight is 20/20 and had I known this was how my day was going to be, I would've asked to pick up the forms on Monday morning or after my test instead; however, here we are. Here's to everyone else sacrificing their sanity on the LSAT, and hopefully I'll run into some of y'all in the library elbow deep in case-law one day",2,1749236299.0,LSAT,0,0.75,False

I‚Äôm hoping to get some help/opinions on choosing a new grinder.

I am looking to ""step up"" the game from my simple blade grinder, and I am looking for something simple, an on-demand grinder (no weighing beans every time) with presets and capable of both espresso and filter coffee. That's it, I am not fussy about retention, static etc.

I drink both filter coffee (in the morning) and espresso (1-2x during the day).

My ideal workflow is
- for espresso, place the portafilter under the grinder, select 1-2 cups, coffee falls into the portafilter, tamper it, place it in the coffee machine (I have a DeLonghi Dedica) and that's it.
- for filter, once per week I would grind a batch of coffee for the week ahead, so in that case I would simply switch beans in the hopper, set a coarser setting, that‚Äôs it

Ideally, my first choice would be the Eureka Mignon Specialit√† but that's over my budget.
I would go for the Baratza Encore ESP but it doesn't have a timer/on-demand presets. 

So, I am leaning toward the Sage Smart Grinder Pro. The price is in the sweet spot (around 200‚Ç¨), it's capable both for espresso and filter coffee, and has presets.

My only reserves are: 
1. it's 10 years old (but does it really matter for a grinder?..)
2. Results-wise, is it ok? (I read comments saying the shots could be better.. but, I am not sure I would really be able to detect the nuances in taste compared to an expensive one..)

What do you think? Are there any other grinders that would fit my use/budget?

They have zero rpg experience, and I don‚Äôt expect more than one session with them, maybe planning it as an adorable grandparent date night? I was thinking about making them be the player characters, and they‚Äôre younger for the duration of the story.

I asked them over coffee where they would go in the Tardis. Mum said family history in Lancashire around the time of Shakespeare. Papa said he wanted to see Neanderthals and other prehistoric humans. Both seem doable, and very easy to see as classic Doctor WHO episodes. Probably easiest to have one encounter per time travel.

1) are there any visual props I can use, like a GM screen with the classic era Tardis interior facing the players?

2) Are there any quick adventures in any rpg which can be used for a basic outline?  Or blogs, or community created handouts like other RPGs have (like call of Cthulhu) which I can use to make the game easier for them to enjoy?

**(phone ring)**

¬†Well look who finally decided to answer the phone...

So, you're gonna ignore me? huh? \~

Please‚Ä¶spare me the theatrics.

No need for formalities‚Ä¶. I think it's better if you don't know who I am for now‚Ä¶ but I know who ***you*** are Pet.

**Don't. hang. Up**‚Ä¶‚Ä¶if you do well \***laugh\*** I'll come in and fucking kill you\~

And you're way too sexy to end up as my latest victim.

We don't want that pretty face cut up and unrecognizable, do we?

Hm thought so

**(whispered)** Shhh... You hear that?

**(Doorbell. Door open loud rain door close soft rain)**

Ding dong‚Ä¶ go fetch‚Ä¶go on be a good pet and see what‚Äôs at the door.

**(tapping sound)**

Oh, what's this?

**\*Small laugh\*** A pretty little box... Left right on your doorstep

**\*Mocking tone\*.**

I wonder who could have done that?

 No name. No return address. Just... a single rose, tied with a crimson ribbon.

¬†Oh, would ya look at that it came with a note‚Ä¶ go on read it out loud. Or should I do it for you? hm?

Ugh someone can't follow directions well so I'll help you. **\*Clears throat\***

**(whispered reading)** *""To the one who makes my world stop spinning... I hope this helps you feel a little more loved today. You deserve it. I'm Always watching, always yours...""*  
  


***\*gasp\****

¬†No signature. Just a little heart at the bottom. Drawn in ink... or is that‚Äî?

**\*Giggle, low and slow\*** No, no... that would be too much, wouldn‚Äôt it?

Let‚Äôs open it together, okay?

**(slow tearing sounds, lid sliding open, soft breathy excitement)** Look at this... It's beautiful, isn't it? I made it for you... every bead, every charm, every fucking thread... touched by my hands\~ Can you feel the warmth in it? That‚Äôs me... That‚Äôs ***my*** love.

**(clink of jewelry ‚Äî a necklace or bracelet, lightly stroked or tapped)**

A pretty necklace right? I'm sorry that my hand couldn't be the first thing around your neck but... **\*giggle\*** this will do for now\~

I mean... look at it.

It even has your name engraved on it... Right there. So, no one else can ever wear it. Just you.

**\*Soft hum, then whispers\*** Do you like it?

You always seem so alone... walking to work, eating lunch by yourself, and mindlessly scrolling on your phone late at night. You think no one notices, but I do. I ***always*** notice.

**(closer to the mic, gentle tapping)** I know what time you get home. I know how you like your coffee. I know what you do when you're alone‚Ä¶. oh really? your search history is filled with asmr girlfriend/boyfriend roleplay audios. You really like this girl/guy named \*insert name here\*

**\*laugh\*** Come on\~...¬† I Even know the playlist you listen to when you can't sleep.

You thought you were invisible... but I see you.

**(slight pause ‚Äî then delicate whispering)** And soon... You‚Äôll see me too.

**(subtle music box sound or creaking)** There‚Äôs a secret in the box. Lift the padding, go on.

**(pause, then sudden whisper, intense and shaky)** Found it, didn‚Äôt you?

My picture. You remember me now, don‚Äôt you?

That day in the library. You smiled at me... and something in me snapped. I knew then that I couldn‚Äôt *not* love you...

The way our hands subtly yet softly connected when you handed over that book‚Ä¶the look of purity and kindness written all over your face...

You were ***mine*** the second you smiled.

**(sweet, obsessive whispering)** I bet you're wondering... how long I‚Äôve been watching...

**\*snicker\*** Wouldn‚Äôt you like to know?

But maybe... you *don‚Äôt* want the truth.

**(sudden giggle)**

 It‚Äôs okay, sweetheart.

 You don‚Äôt have to say anything. I already know your answer. You‚Äôre just... shy.

**(intense quiet, then the final question)** So tell me...

Would you welcome this love? Or would you run? Not that you‚Äôd get very far.

**(faint breathing, as if leaning closer)** I‚Äôd run too. But I‚Äôd catch you.

**(soft fade-out rain or heartbeat sound, then her final line in a loving whisper)**

Oh, and listener. Dear‚Ä¶.

Don‚Äôt forget to leave a comment. I always enjoy reading them... Always watching. Always yours.

I‚Äôm looking for someone to hang out with‚Äîsomeone who doesn‚Äôt take themselves too seriously but still knows how to be kind, empathetic, and respectful of people‚Äôs limits. I‚Äôve been trying to make more meaningful friendships in this city, but honestly‚Ä¶ everyone seems busy or hard to reach lately (i hope you can relate lol)

I have ADHD and can be super bubbly and chatty when I vibe with someone‚Äîso if you‚Äôve got good energy and can match that, we‚Äôll probably get along great.

At the moment, I have to wear a pirate-style eye patch due to a medical thing (ahoy matey), which has been a bit of a hit to my self-esteem. But otherwise, I‚Äôm feeling good physically‚Äîjust need a reason to get out and connect.

I‚Äôm specifically looking for platonic friendship‚Äîso if you‚Äôre hoping for FWB or anything romantic, this won‚Äôt be the right fit. I know it‚Äôs a bit awkward to spell out, but it matters to me for personal reasons. Ideally, I‚Äôd love to connect with a hetero female or someone aromantic/asexual, but I‚Äôm open as long as we‚Äôre both on the same page about the friendship-only thing.

I‚Äôm a little immature for my age in the best way‚ÄîI like seeing the world with childlike curiosity. I won‚Äôt ask for favors or money‚ÄîI‚Äôm just genuinely excited to meet someone who loves random niche interests like geography, history, physics, or anything obscure and fun.

Let‚Äôs share our weird interests while we craft, sip tea or coffee, go hiking, do some light thrifting or urban wandering, or take photos. I especially love collecting seashells and painting them. I usually take public transport or scoot around on my electric scooter, and if we ever go on a longer trip, I‚Äôll always offer to split gas.

If this sounds like your kind of vibe, feel free to DM me! Let‚Äôs see if we click ^_^ :) :) :)

Ex still in the picture,"I met my girlfriend 8 months ago. For the first 4 months, she has been extremely attentive, flirty, and fully attracted to me. She would always quickly reply to my messages all the time. The messages were detailed, full of emojis, and she would ask me tons of questions that would lead to more fun and flirty conversation throughout the day. She would send me selfies, and always ask to come over to my place or hers with obviously hints of intimacy. She would give me constant updates though out the day, ask how I‚Äôm doing, how I slept, joke with me, remember small details of past things, etc. I would always update her too about my day, what I‚Äôm doing, and pictures of anything interesting. All messages were responded to in detail and in a quick and timely manner; we knew everything happening in each others lives.  
In person, we were inseparable; always hanging out, chatting, watching shows, movies, video games, do occasional date nights. She would always touch me, and always be in the mood for sex. We went at it almost every night for 4 months. 

Her ex is still in the picture, as she has a kid with him and he is at her place 3 times a week to co parent.  In the beginning she would be frustrated with him and would try to avoid him while he was at her place. She is always home, as she has to look after her child. 

After March break, the flirty messages full of emojis have stopped and they are less enthusiastic. In person she seems a bit cold and distant. Intimacy and flirting have greatly reduced. I have to ask her for it, and she makes me wait until late at night to get it when I hang out with her. 
She rarely visits my place anymore, and any flirty messages or mentions of sex get laughed off or ignored. There are many instances where she turned me down when I tried to initiate. 

As the months go by, she seems to be less interested, and the delay between responses get longer. In person, she seems less happy, always checking her phone and minimum affection and sex. She doesn‚Äôt have that spark of happiness when I come over to visit her. 
She never visits my place at lunch break or after work, no matter how many times I ask. 


Now there are a few instances where I suspect she‚Äôs cheating or there‚Äôs a third party in the picture. 

- I visited her in the evening after being away all day in the big city. She was home all day. She was dressed sexy with hair and makeup done. We hung out, and I complimented her looks and tried to initiate multiple times, but got rejected each time. When I went home, she messaged me saying that I‚Äôm funny with my timing and we can be intimate another time. (Remember, this girl was always down in the beginning). 
- She sends me very vague responses, with hour plus delays between messages. Meanwhile I seen her having a full blown conversation, replying quickly with emojis and gifs, with her ex. 
- I glimpsed another message where she responded to him with a ‚Äòawww me too‚Äô. She never messages me like that
- I went to her place at lunch once for a coffee when her ex was there, and she was wearing perfume. She only wears it when she was intimate with me. They were having a full blown, fun conversation. She ignored most of my input. 
- The way she looks at him is the way she used to look at me in the beginning. 
- Recently her friend did not show up to her place for girls night, and she didn‚Äôt tell me, or respond to the message I sent her after work. 2 hours later, I asked what‚Äôs up and another 2 hours later I get a very vague response. She did not invite me over or give any detailed response of what she was up to. 
- She seems to mention her ex a lot recently.  
- One day when he was there, she didn‚Äôt message me all day until I sent her a what‚Äôs up at 3pm. She said she just got to her relatives place in another city; she used to always tell me where she‚Äôs going etc. the same day, when I was home for lunch, I seen her walking to her car with him laughing, seeming to have a good time. 
- 
Now it‚Äôs a point where the response times are 2 hours, extremely unenthusiastic, vague, no emojis, and she never asks me questions back. But I always see her active on messenger. I‚Äôm clearly being ignored. 

We still hang out, chat, watch shows, play video games, but she seems distant, and I barely know anything going on in her life. Sex is almost non existent, and I literally have to beg for that late night quickie. I find it extremely suspicious from someone that said she is always down.  Mentions of going out on dates are somewhat ignored or full of excuses not to go. 
I basically went from feeling like the only guy in the world, to feeling like a second option in the friendzone. My gut is telling me there is something happening right under my nose. 
And I‚Äôm not complaining about lack of intimacy, I‚Äôm just trying to figure out how our strong connection and communication has become weakened. 
What could be going on that I‚Äôm unaware about?

I'm so spent with Merrill. My employer offers this so I'm doing it for the match. They offer the fee based advisory or you can do the self directed Merrill Edge. So, I signed up and while I don't recall electing the fee-based advisory option, that's where I ended up. Important to note for the story that you could also sign up for the pre-tax or the Roth 401(k). So I signed up for the Roth. Because it was the fee-based advisory, I had someone calling me every 37 seconds with ""lots of long paperwork so will be much easier going through this with you at a coffee shop"". I declined. Almost all of my stuff is with Fidelity and this is a part, part, PART-time job (benched W2 consultant) so I'm not going to have tons of money in this thing (but I'm not going to forgo a great employer match). So I said, look, can you put me in Merrill Edge self-directed? Of course they say, and then they offer to have someone call me.

Took TWO WEEKS, but finally, he (let's call him ""Buster"") called me. Buster with the red hair and braces and looks 13 (from his email signature photo). So Buster calls me up and asks how we can help. I advise Buster what's going on and Buster sends me a link and says ""I'll stay online with you as you go through the sign-up of this in case you have any questions."" Also great. 17 minutes later I get to the end of this new account sign-up and I come to realize that this is no longer a Roth 401--it's a pre-tax. So I tell Buster this. Buster says "" . . . . . . . .  . . . . (queue 45 second dead air) . .. . . . oh. . . . . . . . ok, let me check on this and I'll get back to you"". Clearly Buster doesn't really understand and calls me back three days later with ""wait, what do you want""? I tell Buster that I have two choices. One choice is if I want fee-based advisory or if I want self-directed. The second choice is if I want pre-tax or Roth. I said I want self-directed with Roth. OK says Buster! He's on it!

10 days later (not lying) I get an email from Buster. It's literally a 27 page document, but ""don't worry, you only need to fill in XYZ pages"". So I do that. Scan it. Email it back to Buster. A week later (again, not lying) Buster comes back and says oh, sorry, your employer needs to fill in one page, can you send it to them? So I send to employer. She fills in the part that and she scans and sends him the whole thing. He comes back to HER a week later to say ""oh, actually we have to have ""X's"" (from the company) signature on this"" (she was the accountant and they needed the owner signature, fair enough). Of course said owner was on vacation. So finally a few weeks later that gets signed off on and everything gets sent to Buster. 

Crickets. Where the hell is Buster? It's literally been a month, but THEN I get an email that says I have a new statement with Merrill! Cool! I log in, have $10k in there and of course it's just sitting there doing nothing. So time for me to start investing! So I'm looking around, can't figure out for the life of me how to invest on this platform. Finally dig far enough and get this message that says ""yeah, you can't do that"". So I send an email to Buster. Hey Buster, how the F\*\*\* do I INVEST BUSTER!?!?!? No Buster. So I wait four days and call the 1-800 number. Merrill Lady says ""you don't exist"". I say well actually I disagree, I do exist. Merrill Lady says ""actually you really don't"". So they finally figure out, OH! Ok, you need THIS department. So they transfer me. Lady number 2 says ""yeah, we don't do that, you have to call your Advisor"". So I finally track that down and I call the advisor for our Employer. The guy that answers (very nice by the way) says initially ""yeah, you don't exist and you need to call the Merrill 1-800 number"". So I lost my sh\*t and I said ""look, for the LOVE of god, I do exist and Merrill 1-800 told me to call YOU and I'm done - you guys need to figure this out."" So he transfers me to Jim. Now Jim is a god-send. We like Jim. Jim says look, this shouldn't be this hard and you shouldn't have to do all of the work you are doing, this is ridiculous. So I take the opportunity to tattle on Buster and told Jim Buster at Merrill sucks and he's the reason for my misery (not entirely but Buster still sucks). Anyway, Jim says that he is going to personally get this all figured out for me, that my $ is still not in an Edge account yet, but it will be very soon. BUT in the meantime, if I wanted to get this into a fund or something while we wait, we can do that now. So he offers the person who can help me with that. Guess who? (No, it wasn't Buster thank God), but it was ""let's have a coffee"" lady. I told her I just want VOO for now. She says GREAT, let me send you some stuff on ETFs and other things we can offer and we'll get you in! And she sends me something on other ETFs they offer and in the email it says ""you will need to enroll in our Investment Advisory Program, our fee based program"". 

WHAT???????? Can someone explain this to me?? So they are willing to put my money into Merrill Edge but if I want to get my money in a fund, I still have to enroll in the Investment Advisory feed-based program? Are they that desperate (or cut-throat)? Or am I just not smart and this is totally normal?",1,1749235473.0,MerrillEdge,1,1.0,False

Here's the story,"Hey everyone! For the first official science post in this glorious new subreddit, I'm putting my own work on the altar. This is the project that has consumed my every waking thought, fueled by questionable amounts of coffee and a healthy dose of paranoia.

It all started with that nagging feeling... you know the one. The one where you realize most of the world's ""secure"" data is protected by math problems that a future quantum computer could solve for a light afternoon snack.

Well, I decided that instead of being scared of our future quantum overlords, we should use their own spooky physics against them.

# The Big Idea: ""Quantum Probabilistic Entanglement""

So I went down the rabbit hole and came up with a framework I call **""Probabilistic Entanglement.""** (Yes, I made up the term. No, you won't find it in your textbook... yet.)

The gist is this: we encode a secret into a quantum state not like writing a message, but more like giving it a specific ""vibe."" We weave the secret into the very probabilities and phases of the quantum amplitudes.

Then, using some fun quantum weirdness (specifically, orthogonality), we can check if the ""vibe"" is correct without ever having to ask the qubit what the secret actually is. It's the ultimate ""I know that you know, but you don't know that I know that you know"" security protocol.

# The ""Does it Actually Work?"" Part

Naturally, I had to see if this would work outside of my own fever dreams. So, I took my creation to the real world: **IBM's 'Brisbane' quantum computer**. I threw some truly gnarly circuits at it, including one with over 3,000 gates, just to see if it would stick.

**The results were... awesome:**

* **It Actually Works!** The quantum hardware didn't just laugh at me. My encoding methods held up against real-world noise, with the results showing high ""distribution quality"".
* **Fort Knox-Level Security.** My classical security tests showed **zero information leakage**. It's a digital black hole for secrets.
* **It's Fast. Ludicrously Fast.** The classical part of the proof is generated in under a millisecond. That's faster than most classical ZKPs, AND it's post-quantum secure. We get to have our cake and eat it too.
* **The ""Oh, Wow"" Moment.** We pushed it all the way to **256-bit security** and it held up. This is the level of security you use when you want to keep a secret from a civilization that can harness black holes for computing power.

# The Real ""Why""

Now, why this obsession? It gets a little personal. This entire project, this deep dive into the nature of reality and information, was born from the last lesson my father ever gave me. He was a teacher, engineer, and mathematician who was tragically murdered in 2020. His final lesson was about vectors. This whole project is my attempt to take that lesson and build something meaningful from it, in his memory.

I've written a full philosophical article on it, which is the kind of deep, weird, unpublished work this community was made for.

**TL;DR:** I got paranoid about quantum computers breaking everything, so I used quantum mechanics to fight back. Built a new, super-fast, post-quantum ZKP. It works. The project is a tribute to my late father and his last math lesson to me about vectors. Science is weird and beautiful.

Anyway, that's my unpublished science. Tear it apart, ask questions, tell me I'm crazy. Let's talk!",1,1749235378.0,UnpublishedScience,0,1.0,False

I swear to God if any of you comment saying this story is now ‚Äòcerealized‚Äô, I‚Äôm not posting again. Honestly, I‚Äôve heard enough cereal puns this week to last me a lifetime.

Anyway, things have gotten even weirder since my last post. For those wondering, yes, I did report my thumb tack incident to the knock-off brand and they replied the next day.

They apologized profusely, gave me a PO box to send the packaging to, and launched an ‚Äòdetailed internal investigation‚Äô. They got back to me a week later saying they'd found two different types of adhesive on the end tabs of the box and the inner wrapper, suggesting the product had become 'compromised' and resealed somewhere between leaving the factory line and hitting the store shelf. They said they‚Äôve since sent a memo out warning their suppliers and issued a product recall, so hopefully you guys won‚Äôt be accidentally eating that stuff anytime soon.

The next part of their email was basically legal mumbo jumbo covering their asses before saying although they weren't technically at fault ‚Äòdue to the packaging being compromised outside their facility‚Äô, as a gesture of goodwill they'd like to offer me two hundred dollars‚Äô worth of grocery vouchers and also a life time supply of their cereal. I turned down the cereal for obvious reasons but took the vouchers, mainly because I needed them to help fund my own ‚Äòinternal investigation‚Äô.

After my mouth had fully healed, I went back to the superstore to try to get back into a routine, but also to gather more evidence. I was a lot more wary as I walked the aisles, second guessing anyone who said hello or who so much as glanced my way. Even if they didn‚Äôt work there, they could still be the one behind the evil ‚Äòsurprise gifts‚Äô.

I stayed in the store for nearly an hour, not really adding much to my basket and mostly just scoping the place out. I did a circuit of the cereal aisle at least four times, trying to memorize which boxes were there when I‚Äôd first entered the store and whether any new boxes had somehow made their way onto the shelves since‚Äîperhaps with a ‚Äòspecial‚Äô surprise inside. As far as I could tell, cereal had only either left the shelves or moved slightly due to other customers rather than any members of staff.

On my final lap, I picked up the samples for my experiment consisting of six boxes of cereal in total; two from each available brand, one from the front of the shelf and one from the very back. My theory was that whoever was targeting me was placing the spiked box or boxes near the front of the shelves whenever they saw me coming in the hopes I‚Äôd bite.

Perhaps if I gathered enough of their ‚Äòsurprise gifts‚Äô I could pass them along to the police as evidence and either get them, or the store manager (assuming it wasn‚Äôt them all along) to cross-check the contaminated packages against any in-store CCTV.

I was glad to see the off-brand Cap‚Äôn Crunch was no longer on the shelves due to the recall, and used some of the vouchers the manufacturers had gifted me to pay for my shopping before heading home.

As soon as I got in, I dumped the rest of the bags, and put on some safety gloves and glasses I‚Äôd borrowed from work before opening any of the cereal. After what had happened with the thumb tacks, I wasn‚Äôt taking any chances.

My heart was racing, but I forced myself to work slowly and methodically. The first box was clean, and so too was the second, but that didn‚Äôt calm my nerves. It wasn‚Äôt until I opened the final box and emptied the contents onto the surface to find nothing but chunks of cereal that I felt my fear deflate into a strange sense of disappointment.

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù I muttered, finally tugging the safety specs off.

All six boxes were completely fine. My experiment was a dud and I had no new evidence to pass along.

I felt my stomach growl at the sight of the sea of cereal in front of me, but forced myself to grab something else to eat instead whilst I worked out what to do next. Maybe now I‚Äôd reported them, whoever had been spiking the cereal had decided to lay low for a while?

I‚Äôd just tugged the plastic clip off the loaf of bread and watched the first slice fall over when I realized my mistake.

They had been one step ahead of me the whole time.

There, running right through the loaf of sliced bread was a rectangular, hollowed-out hole and inside it sat two new ‚Äòsurprise gifts‚Äô‚Äîboth wrapped inside hygiene sealed, see-through packets.

‚ÄúOf course‚Ä¶‚Äù

After the thumb tacks they must have figured I‚Äôd be put off cereal and would eat something else instead. Leaving the gloves on, I carefully pulled out the surprise packets. One was a box of painkillers and the other was a small ‚ÄòGet Well Soon‚Äô card with an overly smiley face on. Somehow, the card creeped me out more than the single condom had done. It was the fact they knew they‚Äôd caused me harm with the thumb tacks, and I could tell the card was insincere. Sure enough, I carefully peeled open the wrapping on the card in the hopes of finding some kind of handwriting to identify them with, but it was blank. They just wanted me to know they were watching.

Feeling dumb, and slightly angry, I pulled out a bin bag and put the bread, painkillers and card inside to try to preserve my new evidence. Surely, I had enough to go to the police with now?

Realizing I now needed to get a new loaf of bread, I decided to walk to the nearby convenience store instead to clear my head. I grabbed another pack of sliced white and, to prove a point to myself: one more box of cereal. I figured if a ‚Äòsurprise gift‚Äô was inside either of them too then the problem wasn‚Äôt just at that one superstore after all, and was far bigger and more surreal than I‚Äôd first thought.

Thankfully, both bread and cereal were fine and I felt some sense of balance return to my small world. Feeling like I had more of a handle on the problem now, I made myself a sandwich and headed off to work.

I spent the first half of my shift in a sour mood, not knowing what to make of anything or who to trust anymore. Despite my lunch having been tucked safely away in my locker, I still picked apart my sandwich in my break before eating it on the off chance it‚Äôd somehow been spiked whilst I‚Äôd been away.

‚ÄúYou okay man?‚Äù My workmate asked as he caught me staring at the contents of my sandwich, splayed out in front of me.

‚ÄúYeah, just‚Ä¶tired.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou and me both pal. I tell ya, these night shifts‚Äîthey fuck with your head.‚Äù

I grunted and carried on with my shift, feeling like a bug in a petri dish. How could someone at that store know my routine so well they could guess exactly what I‚Äôd buy before I even knew. Was I really that predictable?

I spent the rest of my shift trying to guess which of the superstore staff could possibly hold a grudge against me but ultimately drew a blank. It wasn‚Äôt until I clocked out that I realized I‚Äôd been so freaked out by the blank ‚ÄòGet Well Soon‚Äô card that I hadn‚Äôt even opened the second ‚Äòsurprise gift‚Äô from earlier‚Äîthe box of painkillers.

As soon as I got back, I went straight to the kitchen to fish out the packet from the bin bag. I tore it open, half thinking it‚Äôd be just a pack of pills and another dead end, only to find something far stranger.

‚ÄòWINNER!‚Äô the foil wrapper tucked inside the pill box screamed.

Fearing the worst, I put the safety gloves and glasses back on and carefully opened it to find a cinema ticket. I had to read the ticket at least three times to make sense of it. It seemed to be to a showing of a film called ‚Äò2:30‚Äô, only it was showing at ‚Äò9:10‚Äô in the morning i.e. within the next hour. I quickly Googled the name of the cinema and realized it was on the other side of town.

Suddenly I not only felt like a bug inside a petri dish, but could almost feel the gigantic magnifying glass hanging over my head. Was someone just watching me, or about to burn me alive?

Knowing my window for answers would close if I didn‚Äôt leave now, I grabbed my coat and headed out the door.

The cinema was dead, which considering it was first thing in the morning in the middle of the week, was hardly a surprise. The dead-eyed attendant checked my ticket and pointed me to the screen at the end of the hall with a zombie like grunt. I didn‚Äôt bother asking if they‚Äôd heard of the film ‚Äò2:30‚Äô before even though I sure has hell hadn‚Äôt.

I was the only one inside the screen but chose a seat in the middle of the room, yet at the end of a row, figuring I could make a quick getaway if I needed to. I sat through the obligatory barrage of adverts and cellphone warnings before finally, the movie started.

There was no credit sequence, no musical score, just a straight cut to the title card ‚Äò2:30‚Äô followed by a grainy view of someone‚Äôs basement. There were tools on the walls and a rickety chair with someone frail and unconscious tied to it.

Whoever was holding the camera panned it up to show a pair of rusty pliers inside a gloved hand. There was no sound but I could tell what was about to go down before the unseen assailant even stepped towards their victim.

‚ÄúOh Christ,‚Äù I moaned aloud, as it finally dawned on me what the title of the film actually meant (tooth-hurty) before glancing around to spot a guy sitting two rows behind me, wearing a hoodie and staring straight at me.

The draw strings on his hood were pulled tight across his face, like he was going for a run in the middle of winter, leaving a black hole where his face should have been. I didn‚Äôt know if the film I‚Äôd been led here to see was some budget found footage horror, or a genuine snuff film, but in that moment I forgot about the damn film as real horror was two rows behind me.

My legs stood up before I even told them to. The guy stood up too. Behind me, the snuff film carried on playing to itself. Figuring this was where I got off the crazy train, I forced myself to walk back up the aisle, past the figure, trying to act as nonchalantly as possible despite my heart pounding like a drum.

I side-eyed the man as I passed and saw the hollow of his hood turn to watch me leave. I left the screen, and speed walked towards the foyer, hearing the screen door open again behind me.

I didn‚Äôt look back. I knew he was following.

The foyer was empty‚Äîthe popcorn stand not even switched on it was so early. I power-walked to the exit and jogged down the steps before taking off down the street.

It was light outside, making me feel slightly safer, so I risked a glance over my shoulder yet the sight of the guy in the black hoodie barrelling down the cinema steps made me whisk back around. He was wearing matching black joggers and sneakers and was built like he‚Äôd spent the past two decades in the gym.

I started sprinting but I didn‚Äôt stand a chance. I got a stitch before I reached the carpark and felt his huge hand yank on the collar of my coat before I reached my car. He spun me around and shoved me against the side of a white van. For one terrifying moment, I thought he was about to abduct me but he just shouted in my face instead, making me flinch.

‚ÄúAre you the guy?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I squealed.

‚ÄúThe guy that's been hiding stuff in my whey powder?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why were you running?‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought that was you‚Äîit‚Äôs been happening to me too!‚Äù Shaking like a leaf, I pulled out the cinema ticket from my pocket. ‚ÄúLook, I got a ticket to that showing.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the hell was that movie, dude?‚Äù

‚ÄúI dunno: you tell me?‚Äù

I finally opened my eyes and stopped cowering enough to look at him. He looked in his forties, rough shaven and haggard.

‚ÄúFuck. They're in my fucking head man, I swear‚Ä¶‚Äù

He let me go then and stormed off, looking dazed.

I stood there, doubled over, trying to catch my breath for a good few minutes after that. When I finally calmed down, I looked around the carpark to check no more gym ninjas were trying to jump me before heading back home to gather my thoughts.

I was too rattled to sleep so I decided to make a coffee in the hopes of getting some kind of brain wave. I opened the coffee canister, dug in the teaspoon and instantly regretted it. As soon as I heard the same telltale crunch of plastic wrapper that‚Äôd haunted my life for the past month, I dropped the canister like a live wire.

The coffee granules scattered over the floor but the ‚Äòsurprise‚Äô packet somehow landed on my foot. The thing inside was small, white and looked just like a tooth. Even from this distance I could see the flecks of blood on it.

At the same time as I figured out what the hell was on my foot, I also realized whoever had put the tooth inside the coffee canister must have broken into my apartment, and could still be here.

In a blind panic, I kicked the tooth away and ran out of the apartment. I banged on my neighbors door until they let me in and together we called the cops. They arrived within the hour and I told them everything, starting from the very beginning, with the toy alien.

They recovered the shrink-wrapped tooth from my apartment and a few hours later, I was in a police interview room being grilled by two of their detectives. Both were middle-aged, pot-bellied and balding and I could tell neither were taking me seriously.

‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre telling me, someone knew in advance exactly what box of cereal you were going to buy out of the hundreds on the shelves, planted some thumb tacks inside them and you ate them?‚Äù

‚ÄúBy accident, yes‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd someone working at the store is responsible for targeting you, and the individual you encountered earlier?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, someone who must know our routines.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd who might that be?‚Äù

‚ÄúI dunno‚Äîmaybe my old class mate, or maybe even the store manager.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah, how come?‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, it must be someone who works at the store and has some kind of connection to that cinema. I mean how else could they have played that film otherwise?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe've checked with the cinema and that screen was closed for maintenance today.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen how do you explain the ticket? Surely that's evidence enough right there.‚Äù

‚ÄúEvidence you've compromised by opening,‚Äù the other detective chimed in, arms folded.

‚ÄúIs the tooth real?‚Äù I asked them.

‚ÄúWe can't comment on that.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo it is then?‚Äù I guessed. ‚ÄúThis is some kind of serial killer, isn't it?‚Äù

The partner scoffed, ‚ÄúMore like a cereal killer, amma right?‚Äù

The other facepalmed, ‚ÄúReally, Jerry?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Jerry shrugged.

The other, sterner detective turned back to me and said, ‚ÄúLook, if you find something else, here's my card. In the meantime, stay safe and maybe skip breakfast for now?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo kidding.‚Äù

That interview had been two days ago and a cop car is still parked outside my apartment. I don't know if it‚Äôs standard procedure, and they're just keeping me safe, or if they‚Äôre actually staking me out. After all, I must be a suspect to end up so tied up in all of this mess?

My paranoia is spiralling and I‚Äôm eating nothing but tinned food. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm starting to become like that sketchy guy in the hoodie. I didn't notice until I got home but the detective who gave me his card is called Detective Winner, which reminded me of the ‚ÄòWINNER!‚Äô wrapper inside that box of painkillers. That‚Äôs just got to be a coincidence, right?

P.S. A buttload of that knock-off cereal just arrived, even though I specifically said I didn't want a life time‚Äôs supply. I'm talking fifty boxes. My hallway is full of the stuff. What am I supposed to do with all of it? Send it back? What if more comes next month?

P.P.S. a second delivery just came, an overnight fast-tracked parcel‚Äîthe heavy-duty black plastic wrapped kind with no return address. I opened it up and it‚Äôs full of creepy pre-packaged 'surprise gifts‚Äô, everything from small toys to unused single rounds of 9mm ammunition, to razor blades‚Ä¶

There was another tin foil 'WINNER!' wrapper inside just like in the painkiller box. I've just ripped it open and all it says on the piece of paper inside is 'You know the drill‚Äô.

Shit, I feel like I‚Äôm being framed, or maybe...initiated? What the hell do I do?",6,1749235352.0,nosleep,0,0.88,False

I‚Äôve started seeing a man who works a rotating shift - a week of long days, a week off, a week of long nights. We are both late 40‚Äôs. (I‚Äôm 48F) On his weeks off he‚Äôs devoted dad of teenagers. School pick up, drop off, sports etc. 

I would say this is the slowest slow burn of my life. And that‚Äôs okay, but I just want to make sure I‚Äôm not missing opportunities to give it my best shot.

We message daily, phone infrequently and catch up about twice a week for coffee or a low key dinner at home. He‚Äôs thoughtful and caring - he brought me takeaway when I was sick this week, for example.

I appreciate that he makes time for me in his busy life. I miss normal dating experiences like nights out, full weekend days together, doing activities or seeing music.  It‚Äôs calm and easy in his company and I‚Äôm curious to see where it may lead and whether those opportunities come in time. 

I guess I‚Äôm wondering two things. 

1. How successfully would a man in shift work get a relationship off the ground - I‚Äôd love to hear some positive stories about what made it easier. Were you initially catching the moments like we are? 

2. What sorts of gestures would you appreciate as a way of connecting or making life easier as someone with this lifestyle? 

I‚Äôm conscious that he goes without as much sleep to try to fit me in as he‚Äôs on 12 hour shifts. When I brought him a big serve of homemade dinner to last a few days, that seemed to be a hit. When he‚Äôs on nights I‚Äôm more likely to drive up to see him to reduce his travel. What else would help? 



As time goes on and it feels certain I will request more time together but I‚Äôm aware he can‚Äôt fit much more in. 

Thanks for your advice.

I felt really burnt out caring for him all the time. I used to bring groceries home even when I didn‚Äôt own a car and it was out of my capacity to fetch that much stuff from the grocery stores, he didn‚Äôt talk about future, when I was done with my exams he bought a pet cat home rather than spending time with me and he put my mattress out in the living room to accommodate the cat in the bedroom, he did not help me with any household chores as well as did not contribute in paying the rent, always used to record whatever I said when I felt his energy changing towards me and sent it to his family to make them believe that I was not good enough for him, stopped talking with me when there were conflicts rather than solving the problem, never ever took me out for even a coffee, told me not to take him out for date as he found it expensive to go on dates even though I was paying, watched me cry when my exam results were out and I failed rather than consolidating me, used to complain about me to his sister through chats.

The TV was on in their living room so I asked my husband to sit down on the coffee table in front of our baby (who was watching tv) to block her view. I did this because we do not let her watch TV/screens per the aap's recommendation to avoid screen time until they're at least 18 to 24 months. I didn't ask mother-in-law to turn off the TV all I did was just ask my husband to block my baby's view.
My mother-in-law said I'll just turn it off. My husband walked off. The she stated ""you mean you're not showing her anything educational? How is she going to learn her ABCs or her numbers?"" I told her screen time is not recommended anymore then she started to laugh as if I was ridiculous and said ""Well I guess we're all screwed then because X (my husband) has been playing video games since before he was two.""
I just calmly stated again that it's not recommended anymore.

She just kept laughing incredulously and then my father-in-law joined in saying it was ridiculous. My husband was across the room at this point and completely missed this part of this conversation somehow. I had to fill him in later, and he apologized that he didn't know what was going on. I asked how he felt about me following up with her via text with the aap's website, and he said it was a good idea.

So, a few days later, I drafted a kind text with a link to the aap's website and sent it to her. 

""Hey! I know there was some confusion the other day about screen time‚Äîjust wanted to share this what we‚Äôre trying to follow with our daughter. I know things were different when you were raising kids, so I thought this might help explain where we‚Äôre coming from.""

She said: I understand what they are saying and agree with most of it, but I know that some of the kids show that gear towards learning help with learning (still should be monitored). I know 2  olds that know abc's by site and can count to 20 by watching certain shows ( not letting th tv babysit). I am  not disagreeing with how y'all want to raise her. (The typos--I know)

While it seems she did back down, she still subtly defended herself with a follow-up text saying: ""I still feel that some of the old ways are good when used like we used them.""

I have been looking to open my coffee shop for a while.  

However, an opportunity has come up to purchase an already existing place that is fully outfitted. It operates as a cafe and vegan restaurant currently.  

If don't buy it they are not planning to close.  Reason for the sale is that they own 2 restaurants and their labour cost is too high at this location due needing to staff it without being there day to day.  

They currently average about $1000 in sales per day.   Rent it's $4500/month. Utilities $1100/month.  

The brand has little value to me even though their reputation is very good.   I'd want to put the coffee options much more forward and am not sure I'd run it as a full restaurant.  

The big appeal is the location, assets, lease terms (the landlord will need to agree to keep those) which are 2 years and option for 3 more, and the fact it only needs cosmetic changes and minor improvements (it has an espresso machine but will need a better one) as opposed to a full build out from scratch.   

I'm sure I'm forgetting something, but how should I determine a value?

1l5000s,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l5000s/theres_a_mansion_on_the_hill_beside_my_house_i/,There's a mansion on the hill beside my house. I think it saw me.,"I live in a place called **Halgrave**. You won‚Äôt find it on most maps ‚Äî and if you do, your GPS will freeze the second you cross the old stone bridge. It‚Äôs a town of about 500 people, tucked in a valley no one drives through unless they‚Äôre lost. There‚Äôs one diner, one gas pump, and a library run by a woman who hasn‚Äôt said a word since her nephew disappeared ten years ago.

Growing up here means you get used to silence. And secrets. Especially about **the hill**.

Behind the town, there‚Äôs a stretch of forest we call *The Thickets*. Thick-trunked, black-barked trees packed so tight they blot out the sun even at noon. The local kids used to dare each other to touch the moss-covered milestone at the edge of the trail. No one ever stepped past it. No one smart, anyway.

Past the forest, if you push deep enough (and people say not to), there‚Äôs a hill. And on top of that hill stands **Blackthorn Manor**.

We don‚Äôt talk about the manor. Not really. We talk around it. Someone might say they ""saw a light on the ridge last night"" or that ""the wind sounded strange"" ‚Äî but no one ever says the name. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ understood.

The last time anyone admitted going near it was in 2013. Her name was **Ellie Mayhew**. She was sixteen. One night, she told her friend she was going to find out the truth about the house. She walked into the forest alone. They never found her. Her house has been boarded up since.

I didn‚Äôt plan to go looking for anything. But one night last summer, I saw something.

I‚Äôd just finished a shift at the diner and was walking home down Main Row ‚Äî the stretch of town with the old community center, the boarded-up theater, and Connor‚Äôs garage (he‚Äôs the only one in town who can fix a carburetor without a manual). I cut past the trail like I always do. And then I saw it.

A faint light. Pale, golden. Coming from the top floor of the mansion.

I froze. The forest around me went dead quiet. Not just ‚Äúnight quiet.‚Äù *Wrong* quiet.

Then I heard a voice behind me:  
‚ÄúRuth. You see that?‚Äù

It was Connor. Pale, sweaty. Staring at the same light.  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the moon,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMoon‚Äôs behind us.‚Äù

I nodded, barely breathing. The light blinked off. The forest exhaled.

The next morning, the librarian nailed a note to the post office door.  
**""Children must stay inside after dark. The house remembers.""**  
That was all it said.

I thought maybe it was a prank. Until I got the envelope.

No stamp. No return address. Just black wax sealed with a symbol I didn‚Äôt recognize. Inside, one sentence written in careful, perfect handwriting:

>""It saw you too.""

That night, I dreamed of footsteps behind my bedroom wall. Slow, patient ones. They haven‚Äôt stopped since.

I haven‚Äôt told anyone. Not Connor, not my dad, not even Mrs. Calloway. But something in the town has changed. Dogs are barking at nothing. The post office clock is stuck at 3:33. And people are acting like they‚Äôre trying very hard *not* to remember something.

I think the house is waking up again. And I think it wants someone.

*Part Two: The house sent something into town.*

I didn‚Äôt open the envelope again. I burned it. Watched the black wax curl and blister in a coffee can behind the shed.

It didn‚Äôt help.

The **next morning**, my dad didn‚Äôt come downstairs. He usually made coffee before I woke up. I went to his room. His bed was untouched ‚Äî the covers too tight, too flat. Like a stage prop. His shoes were by the door, but the door was still locked from the inside. He just‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt there.

I called the sheriff‚Äôs station. It rang twice. Then silence.

Not a busy signal. Not voicemail. Just‚Ä¶ silence.  
Like the phone had been picked up, but no one on the other end was breathing.

I walked into town. It was foggy ‚Äî *but the sun was up*. Fog doesn‚Äôt hang like that in full daylight, not unless something‚Äôs wrong. By the time I passed the old theater, I noticed it: the silence was *too wide*. No birds. No wind. No sound of tires or chatter. Just my own footsteps on the sidewalk.

Then I saw her.

A little girl, maybe six or seven, in a **white dress**, barefoot, standing in front of the **Calloway Library**. Her hair was wet. Dripping.

‚ÄúAre you Ruth?‚Äù she asked.

I nodded, stupidly.

She smiled ‚Äî but only with her mouth. Her eyes stayed dead.  
‚ÄúThen it‚Äôs your turn to go up the hill.‚Äù

I blinked and she was gone.

I don‚Äôt mean she ran. I mean she *wasn‚Äôt there anymore*. Like someone had edited her out of the frame.

I ran to Connor‚Äôs garage. He was there, half under a car, headphones in. When I banged on the hood, he flinched hard enough to hit his head.

‚ÄúYou saw her too?‚Äù I asked.

He just stared. ‚ÄúYou got the envelope, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù

He had one too. His was still sealed. He hadn‚Äôt dared open it.  
We agreed not to talk about it in the open. Something was *listening*.

That night, I locked my bedroom door and pushed the dresser in front of it. The town felt wrong ‚Äî like we were insects sealed in a jar and something had just started tapping the glass.

At 3:33 AM ‚Äî not 3:32, not 3:34 ‚Äî my doorknob turned.

Not fast. **Slow**. Deliberate.  
Like it was making sure I heard it.

Then the whisper came through the wood. A dry, breathless voice that didn‚Äôt sound angry. It sounded... patient.

>""You don't have to walk to the house. We can bring it to you.""

The next morning, the road out of town was gone.

Not blocked ‚Äî **gone**. Just trees. Unbroken forest. As if no one had ever built a road at all.

Connor tried to drive out. He came back an hour later. Car totaled. Face blank. He wouldn‚Äôt speak. Just sat there muttering numbers that didn‚Äôt make sense.

And that night, I dreamed of my dad. Standing at the window of the manor. Smiling.  
Behind him, something moved.

I am not sure if I should go to a mental health professional kasi di naman ako masyado nagkaka panic attack. Napa post ako kasi a few nights ago, smth in me got triggered.

Yung family ko nasa province and nasa mnl ako with a few relatives.

What I felt during this attack was the same when I had a training for school. I experienced 2 panic attacks in a span of 2 weeks, with 2 days interval. Pinunish kami kasi all for one and one for all ang patakaran since semi-military. It was so hot, they were screaming the instructions, and made us do the push up position sa cement na walang roof after lunch. We were told to run to the field and within 10 secs nandon na dapat kami, hindi ko kinaya. My knees gave up, I couldn‚Äôt catch my breath, and I was dehydrated. Then the panic set in. Kala ko mamamatay na ako. It‚Äôs been more than a year but I still feel the same wave of emotions during that time. 

(I would like to add that I got absent for 1 week bc di ako makalakad sa punishment ng rotc namin, i got muscle spasm on diff areas of my thigh, it hurt so bad that i couldn‚Äôt even sit to pee, babae po ako lolz)

I tried to get over it but I fear na magkaroon ng mistake. Baka ipunish ako or what and it is holding me back from applying sa cadetship program. Di rin ako umiinom ng coffee bc every time nagpapalpitate ako para akong inaatake.

Every morning, Nora sat on the park bench with a thermos of coffee and a sketchpad. She never drew people‚Äîonly trees, clouds, the quiet shapes of the world.

One chilly autumn day, a boy appeared. He was maybe eight, with tangled hair and a jacket two sizes too big. He watched her draw in silence for days before finally asking, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you draw people?‚Äù

She hesitated. ‚ÄúPeople leave.‚Äù

He nodded like he understood. The next day, he brought her a crumpled paper with a stick figure under a tree. ‚ÄúNow you don‚Äôt have to draw me. I did it for you.‚Äù

She laughed, and something in her chest cracked open gently.

From then on, they met every morning. He brought paper, she brought coffee. She started sketching a small figure in the corner of each drawing.

One day, he stopped coming. A week passed. Then two.

Nora returned to the bench alone, sketchpad in hand. This time, she drew a boy beneath a tree, his jacket still too big, smile wide.

She didn‚Äôt stop drawing people after that.

**My version**

Every morning, Nora sat on the same old wooden bench, sipping on her tea and drawing a portrait. A small boy walked up to Nora and sat next to her. ‚ÄúYou're very good.‚Äù The boy said. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù Nora smiled. ‚ÄúWho is that?‚Äù The boy pointed at the portrait Nora was currently drawing. ‚ÄúHe looks like a sheriff from the wild west.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because he is a great sheriff,‚Äù Nora responded. ‚ÄúYou knew him?‚Äù The boy asked with a puzzled expression. ‚ÄúYes. He was the best sheriff in the west because he hated being lazy. Anytime he was not eating or sleeping, he had to help. He would help the cowboys round up their livestock, help the ladies clean their clothes, and listen to anyone who needed to talk. Not to mention, he had the fastest pistol in the west.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe sounds like a great guy.‚Äù The boy smiled.¬†

‚ÄúHe was, although‚Ä¶ I think he helped a little too much. Because every day was an exhausting day. One time, an outlaw robbed the town bank at 8 pm. The sheriff rushed over to stop the outlaw. But‚Ä¶ he had a very exhausting day after helping a trader move crates. His shooting arm was awfully tired, and he couldn‚Äôt grab his gun fast enough.‚Äù Nora sighed, her smile faded away as she stared at the smiling sheriff she drew.¬†

‚Äú...What happened to him?‚Äù The boy asked, holding Nora‚Äôs hand.¬†

‚Äú...He died that day. It was a sad day for everyone. Including me.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI bet he had a big funeral. I‚Äôve been to one before.‚Äù The boy sighed. ‚ÄúThere was lots of crying for my uncle Joe‚Ä¶ was there a lot of crying for the sheriff too?‚Äù The boy asked.¬†

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDid you cry?‚Äù

‚Äú...No.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù¬†

‚Äú...When you're as old as me. You get used to it.‚Äù

‚ÄúLosing people?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶ but also watching people lose themselves.‚Äù Nora looked up at the boy. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen lots of good people overwork themselves for others. I‚Äôve also seen good people ruin their bodies just for a chance to feel good. And people who stick with the wrong type of people‚Ä¶ When I met the sheriff for the first time, I knew that he was going to be one of those good people.‚Äù Nora sniffed. ‚ÄúI just wish I could‚Äôve stopped him when I could.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDo you think he would‚Äôve stopped if you tried?‚Äù

‚Äú...No.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDo you think he at least enjoyed his life?‚Äù

‚Äú...Yes.‚Äù Nora looked back at her sketchbook.¬†

The boy let go of Nora and held his hands together. ‚ÄúMy uncle Joe was a nice guy too. He played baseball with me every Sunday and bought me a sandwich after. But‚Ä¶ he also had these dots on his left arm.‚Äù The boy said, leading Nora to look back at the boy. ‚ÄúMy Dad told me that uncle Joe had some issues. And all I could do was make him feel welcomed and hope for the best.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDo you regret not doing more too?‚Äù Nora asked.¬†

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶ but I didn‚Äôt know what to do. And there is nothing wrong with that.‚Äù The boy smiled a little. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just happy I met and got to know my uncle Joe before we lost him. And all I can do is thank him for being in my life every Sunday.‚Äù¬†

Nora thought for a moment. ‚Äú...I think I understand what you mean.‚Äù¬†

‚Äú...Do you draw those pictures to remember the people you knew?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think they appreciate your drawings.‚Äù¬†

‚Äú...I hope so.‚Äù Nora smiled. ""I guess it is nice to live a long life.""

""I'd hope so."" The boy chuckled, causing Nora to chuckle as well. ",1,1749234960.0,HalfHumanTales,0,1.0,False

Trying to lose weight gain from last 2 years. I was at 200 before starting this (5'6'"" so that's stout), just checked and at 195 after 2 weeks, but having some weird symptoms that are hurting my motivation.

This is a basic approximation of how I've been eating for 2 weeks.

Breakfast  
\-Black coffee  
\-2 eggs and 1/2 cup black beans

Lunch  
\-Chicken or ground beef, 1/2 cup black beans, one large carrot

Dinner  
\-Chicken or beef, asparagus or brussel sprouts or peppers

\-Some meals I add more legumes or other veggies.

The first week felt great (when I was also having smoked salmon every breakfast because we had some leftover from a family trip).

This week has been hell, partly due to work /personal reasons.

Cheat day was last Sunday, and since then, I got hit with low level headaches and dizziness, almost the spins -  added more water and electrolytes, and that's almost totally gone.

But it's psychologically taxing to have work to do, family things to do, and be so anxious over staying hydrated and fed so I don't have a bad headache come back. (One of the worst headaches was right having an orgasm and felt like a ring right around my skull of pain. Very weird, I chugged two huge glasses of water and it faded away but I am concerned that might happen again).

I am really bad at tracking exact numbers and amounts of things. I have some magnesium, potassium, B12, D, and Iron vitamins and have been using some of those (spaced apart from each other, i.e. iron and D after breakfast, magnesium lunch and potassium after dinner, b12 before bed).  I am also taking a break on alcohol since I felt dizziest the morning after having 3 small cups of wine. I also was using cannabis during a recent vacation and am stopping that.

Are there are any obvious mistakes in how I'm approaching the diet? Thank you in advance seriously!",1,1749234725.0,4hourbodyslowcarb,4,1.0,False

1l4zpng,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1l4zpng/14yo_always_negative_and_angry/,14yo always negative and angry,"Let me first say that I have 5 kids, but I have one who has been a ball of fire from the start. She absolutely stands out from her siblings. She used to scream hours out of the day until she was about 5. I took her to doctors, physical therapists, optometrist for vision therapy, psychologist, etc. The screaming subsided as she got older, but she still had a lot of rage and she would break things, she left her big sister with scabs from scratching her so much. I would set limits and consequences and she would break rules smugly and say she didn‚Äôt care about the consequences.

As she got older, they said she was gifted at one point, but I‚Äôm not sure if it was partly because I held her back a year in school (she had a very late birthday and she‚Äôs really small, so it made sense at the time. She is currently in her correct grade again). She also was diagnosed with ADHD and she‚Äôs been on meds for a couple years now, which helps. When she was little, I got her involved in tumbling which also helped the sensory seeking behavior and she got really good at it.

Now, my issue is that she is very often in an irritated mood. She says really hurtful things to her siblings. In the past years, I‚Äôve multiple times caught her writing or saying extremely mean things about me (notes that say she wishes I were dead, pictures of me that she cut up and wrote mean things on my face, etc). I‚Äôve tried taking her to therapy but she stopped talking and she refuses to go back. I try taking her out one on one and she still seems angry most of the time. I‚Äôve had her tested for autism and they say it isn‚Äôt that at all, though there is adhd. She‚Äôs not at all affectionate, very different from my other kids. She‚Äôs unemotional, like I never see her cry. She seems to interact with me generally to get something, like she‚Äôll respond to my texts when she wants more time on her phone. 

I‚Äôve tried keeping her involved in tumbling and acrobatics, but she complains no matter what. I took her to a few different gymnastics classes and she was mad that they had her in easy classes since she only had experience in tumbling. I took her to acrobatics at a dance studio like she asked and she‚Äôs been complaining about having a recital, about the costumes, about the teacher, etc. she keeps saying she refuses to try because the teacher ‚Äúhates her‚Äù because she doesn‚Äôt like the costume. She was telling the other kids she was mad that I didn‚Äôt keep her in gymnastics, but when she was trying gymnastics, she wanted to go to a dance studio. Literally whatever I take her to, she wants the other thing and she‚Äôs angry at me specifically. I‚Äôve asked if she wants to try other activities instead but she doesn‚Äôt want to do anything.

She refuses to read. I‚Äôve bought her books and audiobooks. She says it‚Äôs boring, but also complained that she wants to go to an Ivy League college, but also got mad when I put her in the more advanced math track and complains that she hates math. She won‚Äôt take up any other interests unless her friends are doing it but even then she doesn‚Äôt like the interests (like when she had art as an elective). I tried getting her involved in a technology group and she made my life absolute hell with nonstop arguing until I let her quit.

The only things she seems to like are shopping or going out for coffee/boba/viral-tiktok-dessert. She rarely does her chore but then she complains when things are messy and she yells at her siblings for not doing their chores. She seems to just find ways to be angry at me. She finds something  that I can‚Äôt agree to, even if I‚Äôve agree to 99 other things, and she argues with me about that 1 thing all day every day (like when she wanted to get big fake nails right before she had a gymnastics camp). She has been telling me she wants her belly button pierced several times a week for over a year now, but last time I checked, the piercer wouldn‚Äôt pierce her belly button yet because she isn‚Äôt done growing. And when she was younger she did the same thing with wanting a side shave, so I finally got her a side shave and she was embarrassed by it almost immediately afterwards and hid and and complained about it all the time.

I get that some of this is ‚Äúnormal teen stuff‚Äù but I have two other daughters, one older than her and one younger than her‚Ä¶ neither have that same level of anger all the time. They can have a conversation that doesn‚Äôt involve just insulting people and then asking for things. They can enjoy things without being completely angry about every aspect. They can say positive things and negative things. I also have other kids with ADHD. I‚Äôm really gentle with her, I don‚Äôt put requirements on her grades or keeping her room clean. I ask that she contribute to the household with maybe 1 chore a day, like feeding the dogs. We have set household boundaries.

Criteria for the bag are:
1. Big enough to fit a coffee tumbler, book, and gym clothes. It would be nice if could fit a laptop, but that‚Äôs not a huge necessity. 
2. Ideally made of (real, not vegan) leather. I already have a Longchamp that fits all of the above, but I‚Äôd like something a more refined as I‚Äôm starting to becoming a bit more senior in the workplace.
3. Something that will hold up (in terms of quality) and won‚Äôt look super outdated in a few years! I don‚Äôt buy a lot of bags and would like to use this one for a while! 
4. Not a backpack (they make my dresses ride up during the commute)
5. Preferably under $500.

Hi guys, i(F27) just need some advice on what should i do. Yesterday evening I got a message from unknown phone number. When i opened it, it was a text from my first ever ex boyfriend. The text is like: hey, i know you probably didn‚Äôt expect this, but a few days ago i thought of you and i was thinking if we could ever go out for coffee or hang out, just as friends, i don‚Äôt have any hidden intentions. I was just thinking about catching up.  I wish you all good. 

The thing is: we were approximately 4 years in relationship(classical teenage romance), and we broke up 7-8 years ago. The breakup wasn‚Äôt nice, we were 1 year into long distance, and just a week after our breakup he posted photos with new gf. A year after that he asked me out and we met up so he could tell me that he is unhappy and regrets new relationship and he want us to be together again. I politely declined him as i was already seeing someone. Then he started stalking me, followed me, came up to my house, even waited outside my workplace. I called his mother for advice because i didn‚Äôt want to include lawyer, call police and make a big drama out of it. After that talk with his mother i haven‚Äôt heard or seen him. Last time i saw him was in august 2024, with another girlfriend, on one event where i was working and he just passed by me like i didn‚Äôt exist.
The reason why i would go meet him up again is just pure curiosity and nothing else since im FWB with one guy(he knows the whole story and he is very kind and respectful of me and my own decisions, he even gave me some advices and supports whatever decision i make).

Please help a girl out! 

Edit: i responded to his text message, just saying thanks for reaching out but i am not interested into reconnecting, and wishing him all the best

I (32F) just got a text saying the divorced papers are signed and are being sent for my signature. it just kinda hit me on like where I‚Äôm at in life. We lived overseas for the past four years. We moved due to my spouse‚Äôs being in the military. It was a small island when we first got there it was sort of hard for me to find a job. I got a job at a small coffee shop and worked my up to manager. With a decent salary for what I did. But in end of 2023 this is when my spouse said ‚Äúthey need to figure things out ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúwork on themselves‚Äù‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äùnot fair for me to you wait‚Äù blah blah‚Ä¶ I was like fair I know life can sometimes feel like you‚Äôre suffocating and sometimes you just need some time alone. A month later I was actually going to visit my family and They were going on deployment soon so i figured it would help with the whole time to process. I had hope we would figure it out go to counseling. I remember a message she sent me and it felt like we were going to figure it out well‚Ä¶spoiler alert we didn‚Äôt before they left I found out she cheated when I was on my trip and needless to say this is the catalyst that sent the marriage down the drain.  Things were said about what pushed her to another. She made a comment about my job and basically saying my job was pointless and dumb. I think that‚Äôs where maybe my insecurity is coming from. That I did all this work and I thought I was doing something and in her eyes it was just meaningless. 

Fast forward I tried to save up as much money as I could while she was on deployment before we moved back but now I‚Äôm unemployed getting a divorce and living with my parents I feel like a total and utter failure. With my marriage down the drain and any job opportunity‚Äôs very sparse. How did you guys pick up the pieces. And does this feeling of failure go away?
