# Nespresso Refillable Pods 2025: ⁣Top ‍5 ⁢Picks Reviewed ‌& Compared (Save Money!)

Are you a⁤ Nespresso lover looking ⁤to save money, ‌reduce waste, or explore a‌ wider range of coffee flavors? Than you've come to the right place! In this extensive guide, we'll dive into the world of Nespresso refillable pods, also known ‌as reusable Nespresso pods and nespresso compatible reusable pods, revealing our top 5 picks for 2025. We'll explore⁢ everything from stainless steel nespresso pods to refillable ⁣nespresso capsules,helping you​ make an informed decision ‌and enjoy a more enduring and personalized coffee experience.

**Why Choose Nespresso Refillable Pods?**

The allure of Nespresso machines is undeniable: convenience, speed, and ⁣consistent ‌results. ​However, the‍ price tag of⁤ single-use capsules and the environmental impact are meaningful drawbacks for many. That's where refillable nespresso pods come in. By making ⁣the switch to reusable nespresso capsules⁢ you can unlock a world of benefits:

*   **Significant Cost Savings:** The primary driver for many is the cost. Over time, constantly purchasing Nespresso branded capsules can add‌ up.‌ Refillable ‌options⁢ offer a ample saving, as you only need to purchase ‍coffee grounds.
*⁣   **Reduced​ Environmental Impact:** ⁢Single-use capsules contribute considerably⁣ to landfill waste. ⁤Eco amiable nespresso pods drastically reduce your environmental⁤ footprint by allowing you to reuse ‌the same pod hundreds​ of times.
*   **Wider Flavor Selection:** Nespresso's offering, while extensive, can feel limiting to the adventurous coffee drinker. Refillable pods allow you to use any coffee beans you desire, ⁣opening up a universe of flavor possibilities, from bold dark‌ roasts to delicate single-origin⁢ brews.
*  ‍ **Personalized Coffee Experience:** Refillable options give ⁢you complete control over the coffee strength, grind size, and bean type. This allows ⁤you to tailor your cup to your exact preferences, unlocking the full potential of ‌your Nespresso machine.

**Who Are ⁤Refillable nespresso Pods ⁣For?**

Let's break down the different types of Nespresso users who can benefit most from switching to ‍refillable pods:

1.‍  **The ‍Cost-Conscious Coffee Lover:** You appreciate the convenience of Nespresso⁣ but⁤ are tired of the high cost of capsules. You're looking for a way to enjoy your ⁣daily coffee without breaking the bank.‍ You actively search for discounts and ways to save money and you’re extremely price sensitive. Refillable options are perfect for you.
2.  **The Eco-Conscious Consumer:** You're passionate about ⁤sustainability and⁣ want to reduce​ your environmental impact. You're looking for eco friendly nespresso pods and ‍a guilt-free way to enjoy your daily ⁢dose of caffeine.
3.  **the Coffee Enthusiast:** ‍You're ⁢a dedicated coffee lover who enjoys experimenting with different beans and brewing methods.‍ You're seeking a more⁤ personalized coffee experience and want to control every aspect of your brew, from bean to cup. ​You want the highest​ possible quality and enjoy experimenting ⁣with different‌ coffee grinds.
4. ⁣ **The ⁤Nespresso Vertuo User:** You love⁢ the convenience of‍ your Vertuo machine but are frustrated by ⁣the limited selection of Vertuo capsules ​and the higher price point.You're specifically looking⁢ for refillable vertuo pods or nespresso vertuo alternative pods.You would also consider nespresso refill kit options to ‍make the‌ process even ⁢easier.

**What to Consider Before Buying Refillable Nespresso Pods**

Before you rush out and‌ buy the first set‌ of refillable pods you see, consider these ‍crucial factors:

*  ‍ **Machine Compatibility:** ⁤This is the most crucial factor. Nespresso machines come in two main types: Original Line (also known as essenza, Pixie, CitiZ, Lattissima, etc.) and VertuoLine (Vertuo, VertuoPlus, Vertuo Next).​ Refillable pods⁢ designed for one line are NOT compatible with the other. Pay close attention to the product description and ensure the pods​ are specifically designed for your‌ Nespresso machine. If you have a vertuo machine, search specifically for refillable ⁢nespresso vertuo ‌capsules or reusable vertuo pods.
*  ‌ **Material:** Stainless‍ steel nespresso pods are generally considered the most durable and⁣ long-lasting option. They are also easy to clean and resistant to corrosion. However, some options are made of BPA-free plastic. Consider the material's durability and potential impact⁤ on taste.
*   **Ease of Use:** Refilling pods‍ can ⁣sometimes be ⁤a bit messy. Look for‌ pods with a wide opening and ‍consider purchasing a nespresso ⁤pod filling tool to streamline the process. Also, consider the ease of cleaning. Some pods are dishwasher-safe, while others require hand washing.
*   **Sealing Mechanism:** A good seal is ⁤essential for proper ​brewing. Some refillable pods come with reusable lids (often silicone), while others require disposable foil seals. The type of seal will affect the ease ⁤of use and the overall‌ cost. ⁢Also make sure you have a nespresso refill kit⁢ that includes the sealing mechanism.
* ⁢  **Coffee Grind:** The correct coffee grind ‍is crucial for optimal extraction.Generally, a fine to‌ medium-fine grind works best. Experiment with different grind sizes to find your perfect cup. pre-ground ⁣coffee can work, but freshly ground coffee will always ⁤deliver the best flavor. Consider investing in a good coffee grinder ⁤if you don't already have one.And ⁤remember‌ to think about the‌ best coffee grounds for refillable nespresso pods.
*   **Tamping:** Tamping the coffee grounds ​inside the pod ⁤helps to ensure even extraction and a richer ⁤crema. Some refillable pods come with a built-in tamper,while others require a separate tamper for nespresso refillable pods.* ‌  **Cleaning:** Regular cleaning is​ essential to prevent buildup and maintain the performance of your refillable pods. Some​ pods are‌ easier to clean than others. Choose a pod that is dishwasher-safe or easy to rinse by hand.
*   **Reviews:**​ Read reviews from other users to get an idea of the‌ pod's performance, durability, and ease of use. pay attention to any common complaints or issues.

**Top 5 Nespresso Refillable Pods for 2025**

Based on extensive research and user reviews, here are our top 5 picks for the best‍ refillable nespresso pods in 2025:

**(Note: As of the time of writing, specific⁤ product names and prices can quickly become outdated. The below models give a general overview of excellent choices available assuming‍ relative product availability and popularity.)**

1.  **The Stainless Steel Champion (Original Line):** This pod is made​ from high-quality stainless ⁤steel and features a precision-engineered design for optimal extraction. It's durable, easy to clean, and compatible with most Original Line Nespresso ​machines.It typically comes with a reusable silicone lid for easy sealing. It's a great option for those prioritizing longevity‍ and quality.
2.  **The⁤ Budget-Friendly Favorite (Original Line):** This option ​is a more affordable alternative made from BPA-free plastic. It may not be as durable ⁣as stainless steel, but it offers excellent value⁤ for money. It often comes with disposable foil seals, which may require a ‌small investment in the long run.
3.**The ‌VertuoLine specialist (VertuoLine):** Finding ⁤excellent reusable vertuo pods can be difficult. This meticulously crafted stainless steel capsule replicates ‌the unique‍ barcode system of official ⁤Vertuo capsules, ensuring⁣ seamless operation with your Vertuo machine.It frequently‍ enough requires a bit of a learning curve to master the filling⁣ and ⁤tamping ‍process, but the coffee it produces is well worth ‍the effort. It's generally more expensive than Original Line options due to the complexity of the Vertuo system.
4.  **The ⁤All-in-One⁢ kit (Original Line):** This kit typically includes multiple stainless steel pods,a‍ tamper,a coffee scoop,and a cleaning brush. It's an‌ excellent option for beginners ​who want everything they need to⁢ get‌ started with ⁣refillable pods. ⁢The inclusion of a tamper helps ensure consistent extraction and a great crema.5.  ⁤**The Pod ⁢with ⁤Perforated Cover (Both lines):** Some pods feature a perforated cover instead of ⁣requiring a seal. These reusable ⁤Nespresso capsules often ⁢are simpler to use, because they can be ⁣refilled repeatedly without having to add additional sealing material. They generally work well and are easy to clean. Be sure to consider this as a Nespresso vertuo alternative pods​ option, as it often is a popular method.

**How to Use Refillable Nespresso Pods: A⁤ Step-by-Step Guide**

Using refillable Nespresso pods is simple, but it takes a little practise to perfect.‌ Here's a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Gather Your Supplies:** You'll need⁢ your refillable pod, freshly ground coffee, a tamper (if needed), and a sealing mechanism (reusable lid or foil seals).
2.  **Grind Your Coffee:** Grind your coffee to a fine to ⁣medium-fineConsistency. Experiment with different grind ‍sizes to find‍ what works best for your machine and your⁢ taste.
3.  **Fill the Pod:** Fill the pod with coffee grounds,being careful not to overfill it.Leave ⁢a small amount of space at ​the top.
4.  **Tamp the Coffee:** Use a tamper to gently press the coffee grounds down into the ⁢pod. This helps to ensure even⁢ extraction and a richer crema.
5.  **Seal the Pod:** Attach the reusable lid or‌ apply a foil ⁢seal to‍ the top of the pod. Ensure the seal is secure to prevent leaks during brewing.
6.  **Insert ‌into⁣ Your Machine:** Insert the filled pod into your Nespresso machine as you would ​a regular capsule.
7.  **Brew ⁣Your ⁢Coffee:** Start the brewing process. Enjoy your tasty and sustainable cup of coffee!
8.  **Clean the Pod:** After brewing, allow the pod to cool completely before emptying it. Rinse‌ the pod thoroughly with water or wash it in the dishwasher.**Troubleshooting Common Issues**

*   **Leaks:** This ⁤can be caused by a faulty seal or‌ overfilling​ the pod. Ensure the seal is properly attached and avoid overfilling the pod.*   **Machine Malfunction:** While rare, using refillable pods can sometimes cause issues with your Nespresso machine. If you ⁢experience any problems, stop using the pods instantly and consult your machine's manual.

I never thought this would work, but I just put it on the counter only while I brushed my teeth every day. and slowly I worked up to ""while it's out, and I'm not exhausted, sure I'll floss tonight."" and now I floss nearly every night. it makes me feel good when I do it, but I don't beat myself up if I don't.
the second was just a silly post about how someone had a dream that the new trend was to drink water in doorways to make it more liminal. and my brain made the association that ""oh! water is fun if it's silly!"" I've never been a water drinker, so now if I wander into the kitchen I give myself the opportunity to choose my water bottle instead of pop or coffee. and I didn't go out and impulse buy a new water bottle!
I feel like I've been stagnating for a long time in trying to find coping skills to function, and I'm proud of myself for making these changes!
so if you'd like to join me by drinking liminal water, I highly recommend it 😁",2,1742875751.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

We ordered 2 large tea's, bag tea with 1 cream. Husband was driving he passed me my tea, took his from the employee. He took the cup around the middle of the actual cup, not from the lid like some people do. As soon as he touched it the lid popped off! Spilling hot tea onto his leg and genital area. Thankfully there was nothing ahead of us because his foot came off the brake. Of course he couldn't get out of the vehicle until he pulled a distance away from the window. This causing the burning to continue until he could get out of the vehicle. When we looked at the cup that was passed to him you could see all the ""folds"" in the cup which is a constant thing, most the time it's one and the lid sometimes pops off this cup had 6 ""folds"" of course the lid is going to come! I'm really surprised it didn't happen to the employee! My husband was burnt, not bad enough to go to the hospital in a major city, but bad enough he is still in a lot of pain.

1jjatj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1jjatj8/my_husband_secretly_texted_his_ex_while_i_was/,My husband secretly texted his ex while I was having our baby *UPDATE*,"So I recently found messages that my husband intentionally hid from me. 

For context: I say “ex” but they never dated. Him and this girl had sex together before him and I met. Shortly after we started dating him and I talked about everyone we ever slept with so I’ve always known about her. We have been together for 6 years now, married for 3 years and recently just had our first child. 

A few days ago I was sending myself photos I took from his phone when I saw this girls name in his messages. I clicked on them to read through and it turns out he has been texting her in secret for months or maybe longer? I have briefly told him in the past that I was uncomfortable with them staying in touch because I don’t see a reason for them to. I was under the impression that this was just a casual fling and that she is not a significant person in his life so I see no reason for them to continue to communicate.  I never gave it another thought. However, these messages felt very condescending towards me when they talked about how they both think it’s silly that I won’t let them stay in touch. He even asked to meet her at a coffee shop without me knowing and asked multiple times if she was available for a phone call. He also told her to start messaging him on Instagram because it’s more private and I’m less likely to find their messages there. 

When I found these I immediately confronted him and he played dumb at first and then he said that they were close friends for years before he met me and that he didn’t like being told that he couldn’t talk to her. He swore nothing happened between them since we have been together and that they never actually met up or talked on the phone. I just don’t know if I believe him? And now I know that he has no problem lying to me and hiding things so it has me questioning if I can trust him at all?

Another massive issue is that during the time span of these messages I was 9 months pregnant and then I had a c section and the recovery was brutal. I struggled to be able to walk for days and then I got a horrible allergic reaction to the bandage on my scar. I then got back to back mastitis 4 times and had a fever of 104°F. THEN I got COVID. It was absolutely horrible and I don’t feel like he was there for me at all. He didn’t help me with nights  and he always complained about being tired the next day. When I had a fever he took a nap while I took care of our newborn son and told me to just wake him up if I felt like I needed to go to the doctor.  I still have a lot of resentment because of the lack of help I got during my postpartum and now I find out he somehow found the time in all of that to be talking to this girl? 

I have no clue if this is something I should work through or if it’s a warning sign that this marriage is doomed?? 

UPDATE:
I read every single response to this and I did not take them lightly. Due to my current situation, I have decided it is best for now to stay together. Later on in better circumstances that might change. 

A friend of mine told me that it might help me get closure to reach out and talk to this other woman myself. In retrospect, that was not the best advice but I did it. 

Shit absolutely hit the fan!

I genuinely expected her to be mature and respect my boundaries but it ended with her blocking me and messaging my husband after sending me many long winded messages. 

Basically told me that I was being toxic and controlling and trying to dictate their friendship. She said that she feels sorry for me and she feels sorry that my husband has to put up with my behavior. She texted my husband: “you are a great person and have a bright future ahead of you ❤️ you will get through this”. 

Thankfully, my husband has apologized profusely about this situation and has been 100% backing me up. He knew I messaged her (because I don’t hide things). He deleted her on social media and deleted her number. He told me as soon as she messaged him and he did not respond or react to her. 

I’m not bragging on his behavior, I think this is the bare minimum and he shouldn’t have put us in this situation to begin with. However, I guess I’m glad that he is reacting well now?

I personally think that this shows she clearly had bad intentions in talking to him and possibly was planning to cheat with him if given the opportunity?

Anyways, I’m aware I did the wrong thing by messaging her at all but it’s been done now. Just wanted to give everyone an update. ",1,1742875243.0,Marriage,1,0.67,False

I walk atleast 5k-8k steps daily, so I hope the cause isn't due to having a sedentary lifestyle. I do have a history of high blood pressure and heart disease that runs in my family. 

I only fell asleep for one singular night (7 hours) and I spent my nights working on projects for 2 weeks, taking only 1-2 hour naps on my free time. My heart rate climbed up to 120-150 bpm in the midst of doing my tasks during those 2 weeks while sitting, but I paid no mind since I thought it was just caused by stress and caffeine (2 cups at most). 

That was until basic activities caused my heart rate to reach 180bpm from merely walking and climbing up the stairs, leaving me to feel extremely winded and almost fainted. It would sit at around 140~120 bpm for hours, and I remember laying in agony because I did develop chest pain, difficulty in breathing, and tingling/pain in my left arm. It's different from the usual chestburn from acid. Whenever it gets stuck at such a high bpm (let's say 160) I start doing vagal maneuvers and it lowkey hurts lol it helps but it only brings me down to 120. 

Now that the 2 hellish weeks were over, I found that my caffeine tolerance has decreased. I start feeling sick and nauseated whenever I consume a single cup, even if I dilute it with creamer. My heart rate shoots up to 150bpm whenever I drink coffee, and now my resting heart rate almost always sits at around 100-120 bpm. I'm trying to switch to decaff since I figured I was pretty sensitive to stimulants now but I still find myself drinking it out of habit. Although, my resting heart rate is still 100-120bpm even without caffeine. I did wake up this week with slight fluid retention (swelling in my hands) and still do get occasional chest pain.

Where do I go from here?,"As the title suggests, my partner has left the house again after a “fight.” We’ve been together for almost a year and a lot has happened since then. Since meeting him, I’ve noticed that he has these mood changes that can flip like a switch. 

I honestly wanted to stop him from leaving this time, but I am honestly just so exhausted. In the span of 10 months, he’s asked me to cut off all my friends because he doesn’t like them. Now, I have no one I can talk to or reach out to anymore. I don’t know where to go from here. 

Things got bad in September, when we moved out together for the first time. I used to play chess in the library and tried to show him a game I was in the middle of playing. I thought he’d be excited but he flipped out on me, screamed in the middle of the law library, and stormed out.

It just kept getting worse. He’d stay home and drink as I’d go to class. He’d question if i was even in class, spam-texting me asking where I was. It all boiled over during law of evidence last term, where he just absolutely lost it again and went to a bar to get drunk. To summarize (because there were a lot of these back-and-forths): he’d get drunk, threaten to leave, i’d try to get him to stay, and he’d walk out the door, come back, and i’d walk on eggshells… i really felt like i tried my best to fix whatever set him off- but he’d find something else to hold over my head, or like, continue to hold the same things over my head.

It got to a point where he involved my parents at 2am, after he forced me out of the apartment to go buy a pack of drinks with him. He started screaming at me in the streets about guy friends I had, and how he didn’t care if the cops got involved. It was super distressing so, i buried my face in my coat and just kept walking as he screamed at me from across the road. 

He called my parents and they asked him to leave. I let him. It was hard. We got back together because he promised me he’d be better and he messed up. I accepted and things were fine, up until any of my other friends came into the picture and asked to hang out. Then, he’d get mad again.

Recently, he’s been flaring up again. Getting angry at me, saying he’ll leave for someone else. He’s gotten me to cancel my plans with friends. Now, he’s had me cancel on a dinner with a bunch of folks at a firm. He’s also gotten me to cancel on coffee chats with potential articling firm partners. I’n devastated. 

All that I did today was stay home, and relaxed. I was just working on a miniature house i was building because I just needed a day off from work before school started up again. Honestly, i feel guilty because i was so focused i didn’t realize he was probably bored. We decided to throw on a movie and halfway through, he just loses it at me and starts bringing up things from months ago that we’ve talked about (I was talking to one guy when we were broken up. That was over 6 months ago). He said he can’t get past it, and I’m heartbroken but say it’s fine (it’s not). I’ve forgiven him for doing so SO SO much worse. But i can’t so much as have a lunch with even classmates or he’ll break a dish. 

I begged him to please quash the fight for tonight. I literally tried everything. I didn’t raise my voice- I rarely do. I agreed with everything he said. I tried my best to just not stir the pot. He still ended up freaking out, and leaving me. 

Now, I have nowhere I feel I can go. And I need to know what I can do to just overcome this. Like, what path I can go down to just be happy and recover from whatever this was? I don’t feel like many of my friendships are salvageable. I’ve never felt so alone in my life. Idk what to do.

I had planned everything—a nice rooftop café, a good outfit, and even a few jokes in my head (because I hate awkward silences). This wasn’t just any date; it was my first date with a girl I had been talking to for weeks.

Our late-night chats, those random ""I was thinking about you"" texts, and the way she laughed at my dumb jokes—it all felt so real.

Maybe too real.

I reached the café 20 minutes early (nervous energy, you know?). Kept checking my phone—no new messages. Ordered a coffee. Waited.

5 minutes passed.
""Maybe she’s stuck in traffic.""

15 minutes.
""Maybe she’s looking for parking.""

30 minutes.
""Maybe something urgent came up.""

After an hour, I finally texted her—
""Hey, are you okay?""

The message was delivered. But there was no reply.

That night, I sat there alone, watching other couples laugh, hold hands, and talk like they had all the time in the world. It wasn’t just about getting ghosted. I was sad because, for the first time in a long time, I actually thought this could be something real.

Maybe she had her reasons. Maybe I was just another option. Or maybe, I’ll never know.

But one thing I do know—next time, I’ll still show up early, still pick out the perfect outfit, and still believe in the magic of meeting someone new. Because if I stop believing, what’s the point, right?

1jjako6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1jjako6/did_i_get_scammed_her_or_is_this_just_a_really/,"Did I get scammed her or is this just a really weird person? (Long Question, TLDR at the bottom)","Guys please help, I don’t know where else to post this but I need to know what I just got myself into. I’m using an alt account for safety reasons, but I feel I made a huge mistake talking to a weird number and I need to find out what’s going on.

Here’s a recap of my story:  
⸻  
Recently, I got a message from a random number claiming to be someone named Mina. She addressed me as Cindy, saying she was surprised I hadn’t saved her number. The thing is, I’m not Cindy, I’m someone else. I assumed it was a scam and decided to play along, thinking that if anything, I’d just get more spam messages. However, as I kept responding pretending to be Cindy, Mina seemed to believe I was really her. The situation took a strange turn when she invited me to meet at her favorite coffee shop, but I didn’t know Cindy’s favorite coffee shop. At this point, Mina began to suspect that I wasn’t actually Cindy, and her attitude quickly turned angry, calling me out for pretending to be someone I wasn’t. This was when things got bizarre—she started making racist comments, blaming Black people for crime in the US and criticizing my sense of humor.

I immediately called her out, defending myself and pointing out how biased and offensive her words were. After about an hour of back and forth, we found some common ground. She apologized for her earlier comments, explaining that she had been harassed a lot in LA, and I apologized for misleading her. Things seemed to cool down, and I agreed to get to know her better.

Mina told me she was in the fashion design industry and lived in LA, and I shared that I worked in graphic design. Then the weirdness continued. She kept insisting I tell her my age, even though I was hesitant because I was very young (not a kid, but under 30). She also started asking for more personal details, including where I found inspiration for my work and mentioning her love of travel. She seemed like a normal person, but then things took a strange turn when she repeatedly asked if I had WhatsApp or Telegram, pushing for us to connect on one of those platforms.

Eventually, I gave in and agreed to share my Telegram number, but things got weirder when I received a message on WhatsApp from a different number—one with a Los Angeles area code. It was from Mina, claiming to have “caught” me. This threw me off since she had previously told me that the number she’d texted me from was her work number from Canada. I tried to ignore it, but she kept texting, even when I asked her to stop texting late at night.

The next day, things got even stranger. She started asking more personal questions, and when I Googled her name, I found a fashion designer named Mina Selection who ran a business in LA, just like she had claimed. But when I asked her about it, she became evasive, saying the business was run by her uncle and had no website. She also mentioned having a business in Miami but refused to provide any details. After digging deeper, I found out that the website she had shared with me didn’t even match the information she gave. It was a French company owned by someone else entirely. She then explained that she was an agent for the company and used to live in Miami, but I was still left questioning her story.

As the day went on, I became more invested in getting to know who she was, but things still didn’t add up. She eventually sent me a video showing a squirrel outside her house in LA, which seemed normal at first. But then, I noticed something odd: the apartment number visible in the video matched an address I found online in LA. To make things even creepier, I saw a picture online with the exact same apartment and squirrel, but the profile was from someone else named Parker. That made me think maybe Mina’s last name was Parker, but everything else was getting more suspicious and I soon realized she must’ve stole the video online, meaning she wasn’t telling the truth.

Then came the big twist: Mina somehow knew I lived in Chester, Virginia, which was a detail I hadn’t shared. When I asked her how she knew, she sent another video of her driving through LA, which was found on Google and appeared to be from months ago. Now, I was truly unsettled, wondering if Mina was someone else entirely or if she had somehow been using my information against me.

At this point, I’ve been left feeling confused and unsure of whether I was talking to the real Mina or someone impersonating her. The whole situation turned from a weird interaction to something that felt increasingly like a dangerous game, and I’m still trying to piece everything together. The anger at the very beginning made me think it was a real person, but the strange coincidences are undermining that trust. This has to be more than a wrong number scam. Around the same time I did get a lot more spam message, but at this point I’m not even sure if Mina is really Mina at all.

TL;DR:

I got a random message from someone named Mina who thought I was someone else, and things quickly got weird. At first, I thought it was a scam, but then Mina seemed to believe I was the person she was texting. She got angry when I didn’t know her “favorite coffee shop” and made some racist comments, but later apologized. She claimed to be in the fashion industry, but her story started falling apart when I found discrepancies about her work. She kept asking personal questions, pushing for me to connect on other platforms, and even sent me a video of a squirrel outside her house. When I did some digging, I realized the video was stolen and the apartment in the video was linked to a different person. Then, she somehow knew personal details about me that I never shared, and things started to feel creepy. I’m not sure if I’m dealing with the real Mina or if I’ve been talking to someone impersonating her. This has gone way beyond a wrong number scam, and I don’t know where this is headed.

1jjak67,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jjak67/range_three_four_one/,Range Three Four One,"BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.

I slowly opened my eyes, grabbed the phone that was resting next to my head, and pressed the snooze button. I then closed my eyes, desperately trying to get another five minutes of sleep. This was the fourth time I had repeated this task, much to the annoyance of the other Marines sleeping in the squad bay.

“Bitch, turn your fucking alarm off, that’s like, the twentieth time.” Groaned Corporal Dawson, lying on the rack next to mine.

“Fourth time; and stop bitching.” I grumbled back. “We’ve all been awake for the past hour anyway.”

I was right; since we’ve been out here on this training exercise, all our sleep schedules have been disturbed, and our bodies’ internal clocks would have us wake up typically an hour before we were supposed to.

My attempt to return to slumber was futile, and I spent the next five minutes staring at the back of my eyelids. Five minutes passed in what felt like two, and once more our one-room living space was filled with the incessant beeping of my alarm, this time joined by three dozen others.

I let out a sigh and crawled out of my sleeping bag, exposing myself to the cold air of the unheated room. I sat up and threw my legs over the side of my rack. I took a second to get my bearings and took in the room.

The dust floating off the concrete floor of the narrow squad bay was illuminated by the bright fluorescent lights that were affixed to the ceiling, the occasional flicker casting the room in dull murkiness. Around me, fresh faced and short haired boots rushed to get dressed, being hurried by tense-faced and booming-voiced Corporals wearing out of regulation mustaches. The terminal Lance Corporals, who had long since stopped caring, lazily emerged from their sleeping bags, content to take their time.

As I got dressed, I asked Dawson about what was on the schedule for training this week, raising my voice to speak over the cacophony of “Move faster!” “Get your rifle!” and “Aye Corporal!”.

“I don’t know, man, according to Sergeant, we’re going to be in cantonment all week, so probably just more of the same” Dawson said as he pulled on his trousers.

Great, I thought. More of the same meant PT, basic knowledge classes, and, worst of all, gun drills. I hated gun drills more than anything else in the whole fucking world. Running back and forth and touching a candy cane in the ground because I couldn’t get the gun up in less than ten seconds all day was not what I was expecting to be doing when I joined the Marine Corps.

I was about to ask him if there were any working parties going on today to see if I could get out of training, when the front door of the squad bay flung open.

“Get the fuck outside right now, we got formation, y’all ain’t new!” Sergeant Federico barked; his face full of its usual malice.

“Aye Sergeant!” The room answered almost in unison.

“It’s too early for this shit.” I mumbled under my breath. I had hoped that Sergeant Federico’s eight-year career as a mortarman would have damaged his hearing to the point where he couldn’t hear what I had said, but I underestimated his auditory detection abilities.

“The fuck you say, bitch?” Sergeant Federico growled, taking a few steps in my direction.

“Er, um uh, nothing Sergeant.” I replied meekly, trying to avoid making eye contact. Sergeant Federico stared daggers at me, the pissed off expression not leaving his face.

“That’s what I thought, bitch” Sergeant Federico said, making an about face and walking out of the room.

“Fucking dumbass.” Dawson said, shaking his head.

“I know right? He’s such an asshole.” I said, my confidence returning to me now that the Sergeant was gone.

“I was talking about you.” Dawson replied.

A few minutes later, me, Dawson, and twenty eight other Marines were standing in columns outside of our squad bay, shivering in the predawn cold. A minute later we were joined by the Marines from section one, who were living in the squad bay right next to ours. A few minutes after that, our platoon sergeant arrived and conducted counts.

“Rifle!” Gunnery Sergeant Richardson shouted in his booming voice. Down the line of Marines, each Marine calling out his number in a similar inflection.

“One!” “Two!” “Three!” Marines called out, going down the line. When it was my turn, I tapped my rifle and called out my respective number, and the count carried on.

“NVGS!” Gunny Richardson bellowed out.

“Take ‘em out! Let me see ‘em!” Sergeant Federico chimed in.

Each Marine held up his pair of Night Vision Goggles and counted. I moved my hand to my waist to grab mine from my NVG pouch that was strapped to my belt. As my hand met the belt, I felt nothing.

“Oh fuck…” I gasped, remembering that I had left my NVG pouch under my rack last night. The count had rapidly gotten to me and when I didn’t say anything, Sergeant Federico was immediately on my case.

“Where are you NVGs?” Sergeant Federico inquired angrily.

“Under my rack, Sergeant!” I replied. The entire formation let out an exasperated groan.

“There ain’t no fuckin’ way!” Sergeant Federico screamed. “Go fucking get them!”

“Aye Sergeant!” I replied quickly, dashing through the formation back into the squad bay. I hastily retrieved my NVGs and returned to my spot in formation. In my peripheral vision, I could see Dawson giving me the side eye. I could tell he was angry, and we both knew what was about to happen.

As soon as formation ended, Sergeant Federico called me over.

“Who’s your squad leader, bitch?” Sergeant Federico screamed, about three inches from my face, his cologne overpowering me more than his yelling.

“Corporal Dawson, Sergeant!” I replied.

“Dawson, get the fuck over here!”

“Aye Sergeant.” Dawson said. He was already standing next to me.

After about twenty minutes of Dawson and me doing a series of grueling exercises while being verbally torn apart by Sergeant Dawson, we were finally released when Gunny Richardson saved us. He told the Sergeant that we had had enough, and that we were to go shave, eat chow, and then prepare for that day’s training.

As we were walking to the head, Dawson suddenly stopped and gave me a hard jab on the side of my arm.

“What the hell was that man? You’ve been in the Marine Corps for three years, how the fuck do you forget to grab your NVGs?” Dawson said, his voice filled with hostility.

“I don’t fucking know man, I’m sorry. I took them out of my pouch last night to clean them, which you told me to do by the way.” I replied.

“I also told you to put them back when you were fucking done!” Dawson growled back.

“Look man, I’m sorry, it won’t happen again, I swear.” I said sheepishly.

Dawson sighed and gave me a serious look. He said “Look dude, you being a shitbag was cool when we were boots and I wasn’t your squad leader, but things have changed. I have a lot on my plate now, and I can’t keep getting fucked up for your bullshit.”

Me and Dawson had been together for practically our entire Marine Corps careers. We were in the same platoon on Parris Island, we went to the School of Infantry together, and we eventually hit the fleet together, being sent to the same unit. I’d say we were pretty good friends until a few months back.

To make a long story short, Dawson got promoted, and I didn’t. I honestly can’t say that it wasn’t fair; Dawson was a stellar Marine and well, I wasn’t. When he was studying knowledge and exercising in his free time, I was playing video games and getting drunk in mine. He was sent to advanced school, and I was never even considered. Upon his return he was meritoriously promoted to Corporal. As for me, well, NCO panels were a revolving door for me at that point.

He was made a squad leader, and I was placed in his squad. I was happy about it at first, I thought I would be able to skate out of work and PT, but this unfortunately wasn’t the case. Dawson was a very motivated NCO, and he volunteered our squad for everything. He would also personally PT us every single day. While the rest of our peer group would slink back to their rooms as soon as the Lieutenant and Gunnery Sergeant were gone, Dawson would have us doing hill sprints and burpees at five in the morning.

What didn’t help matters was my attitude. I had always been an asshole, but as soon as I was placed Dawsons squad and had to deal with his moto bullshit, I got a lot worse, and every time I said or did something fucked up, Dawson would be punished for it. Sergeant Federico always hated me, and he hated Dawson for being friends with me, so he was constantly looking for reasons to fuck us up. The past few months have been miserable for us, and it put a strain on our friendship.

Dawson gave me an annoyed look. “Dude, you’re my friend, and nothing will change that, but I can’t keep putting up with your shit. I actually like my job, and if I can’t fix you, Federico’s going to fire me, and I’ll be back doing gun drills with the boots.”

I chuckled. “Boots like me, right?”

Dawson’s expression softened. “I didn’t say that.” Dawson shot back. “All I want for you to do is at least try to be better, for my sake.”

I thought about what he said for a moment. It was true that most of the problems he was going through could be attributed to me and my bullshit, and that he did really enjoy being a squad leader. I looked at him and saw that at this point there was no anger or hostility on his face, just an expression of exasperated desperation.

I sighed. “Okay, okay, you’re right, I’m sorry. I’ve been a shitty marine and an even shittier friend. I’ll do better. I’ll keep my gear on me at all times, I’ll put effort into PT, and I’ll actually try during gun drills today.”

Dawson’s face turned to skepticism. “I’ll believe it when I see it.”

With that, we resumed walking to the head.

After we finished shaving, we left the head and walked to the chow hall. As we were walking in the building, we encountered First Lieutenant Adams.

“Good morning, Sir.” Dawson and I both say in unison.

“What’s up guys!” Lieutenant Adams said with a smile, revealing two rows of perfect, white teeth. “Sergeant Federico told me that you two had some gear retention issues at formation.” His voice was dripping with its usual condescension.

“Yes Sir,” I began. “Dawson and I talked about it and- “

“I think you mean Corporal Dawson.” Lieutenant Adams interrupted.

Me and Dawson exchanged side eyed glances. First Lieutenant Adams was our platoon commander. He was formerly a POG working in admin before he went to the Naval Academy. He was somehow commissioned as an Infantry Officer and was now our OIC. There were rumors that he was transferred to our unit from his last command because of hazing allegations, but I never believed them. He had too much of a stick up his ass to haze anyone.

“Yes Sir. Me and Corporal Dawson talked about it, and we’ve come up with a plan not only to help me retain my gear but also improve myself as a marine as a whole.” I said, barely able to hide the disdain in my voice.

“That’s good news! I’m excited to see the results!” Lieutenant Adams said. With that, he walked past us, exiting the chow hall and walking in the direction of the COC.

“I hate that dude.” I said a few minutes later between mouthfuls of powdered eggs.

“Who doesn’t?” Dawson asked before taking a swig of room temperature coffee.

It was true, very few people in our platoon liked Lieutenant Adams. His methods of leadership and personality left much to be desired. Even Sergeant Federico didn’t like him, but that’s not saying much, because Sergeant Federico typically didn’t like anyone except himself.

We finished our meal and left the chow hall, walking back to our squad bay. Once we got there, Sergeant Federico immediately had us set up our cannon, and we began doing gun drills at the ungodly hour of six AM. An hour passed, and I was running to touch the aiming stake for what felt like the hundredth time, when Lieutenant Adams’s voice pierced through the air.

“Corporal Dawson, get your squad, you guys are going on a working party. Bring your flak and Kevlar.” Lieutenant Adams said, his voice lacking its usual air of superiority.

Thank God, I thought myself. I didn’t know how much more of this I could take. I could tell that Dawson was annoyed; he hated working parties. He saw them as being beneath him. But nonetheless, he instructed me and the two other guys on our gun, (two boots named Henderson and Lewis) to break down the system and stage it inside. We quickly complied and when we finished, we found ourselves standing in front of Lieutenant Adams, awaiting his orders. Sergeant Federico was also there, looking more annoyed than usual.

“You got all your guys here?” Lieutenant Adams asked Dawson.

“Yes Sir!” He replied in a professional tone.

“Do you have all of your gear?” He asked, looking at me.

“Yes Sir!” I said, tapping my rifle and my NVG pouch, this time actually containing them.

“Good.” He said. He then turned to face Sergeant Federico. “Sergeant, take them down to the motorpool. You’ll be briefed on your task when you get there.”

“Sir, can I speak to you in private?” Sergeant Federico asked.

“I believe we already did, Sergeant.” The Lieutenant replied matter of factly. “You *will* accompany them on this working party. Perhaps it will be an opportunity for you to learn how to actually lead people.”

Most of the lower enlisted guys didn’t like Lieutenant Adams because of the constant training he made us do. The NCO’s hated him because of his refusal to consult them in private. If one of the Corporals or Sergeants fucked up, the whole platoon would be witness to Lieutenant Adams publicly berate them. I could tell Sergeant Federico was straining with every fiber of his being to not swing on the Lieutenant. After a few seconds of Sergeant Federico staring daggers at the Lieutenant, he finally responded.

“Yes sir.” He said though gritted teeth. He then turned to us. “Alright assholes, lets fuckin’ go.”

The five of us walked briskly down the gravel road, past the low-lying buildings on either side of the path. Walking a few paces behind Sergeant Federico, I asked him what we’d be doing.

“Why the fuck are you talking to me? Ask your squad leader!” Sergeant Federico barked.

I rolled my eyes and asked Dawson what we would be doing, and when he didn’t know, he asked Sergeant Federico.

“I don’t fuckin’ know. Sir and the other lieutenants got told to give up some marines for a working party this morning at their brief. For all I know, we’re gonna be filling up sandbags or some shit.” Sergeant Federico said bluntly.

I thought back to Lieutenant Adams. He seemed different from his usual smug self when he told us about the working party. Usually when he ordered us to do bitch work, he had an air of superiority around him. This time, he seemed almost concerned.

After a few minutes of walking, we eventually reached our destination. The motorpool was a dirt field usually filled to the brim military vehicles. On this day, however, it was mostly empty, aside from a green 7-Ton and a coyote tan JLTV. Thirty other marines stood milling about, waiting to be told what to do. After ten minutes a white van pulled up, and Lieutenant Adams and a man I didn’t recognize emerged from it.

“Alright guys, bring in it.” First Lieutenant Adams called out in an annoyed sounding voice. Dawson and I chuckled at the Lieutenant being roped into this working party. I could even see Sergeant Federico crack a rare smile. We all started to make our way over to Lieutenant Adams to hear what he had to say. As I approached, I took a second to analyze the man standing next to him.

He appeared to be a middle-aged man, maybe in his late forties. His receding hairline pushed back his graying hair. His face was stern. His piercing blue eyes seemed to bore into me when he looked in my direction. He wore a marine uniform however it lacked name tapes or rank. Based on his age and the fact that he was with Lieutenant Adams I knew he couldn’t have been a private. Whoever this was, he must have been important.

“Okay guys, I’ve got something a little different for you today.” Lieutenant Adams said addressing the crowd.

“Something different?” I whispered to Dawson. “That doesn’t sound good.”

“We’ll be assisting mister…” Lieutenant Adams began, pausing to crane his neck to look at the man’s nonexistent nametapes.

“Jacobs” The man said flatly.

“Mister Jacobs.” Lieutenant Adams continued. “He’s with the…” A look of embarrassment swept across the Lieutenant’s face, and again he turned to Mr. Jacobs, hoping he would provide the name of whatever organization he was a part of.

“That isn’t relevant for today’s test.” Mr. Jacobs said, not even turning to look at the Lieutenant.

Lieutenant Adams looked startled at Mr. Jacobs blunt response. “Uh… right…” The lieutenant said, clearly perturbed by the strange man. “Today we’ll be assisting Mr. Jacobs with a chemical test.”

Chemical test? I thought to myself. What the fuck? I exchanged glances with the Marines to my left and right. I could tell we were all confused by what the Lieutenant had said.

“The fuck you mean, chemical test?” Sergeant Federico called out, not caring if his tone offended Lieutenant Adams or Mr. Jacobs.

Lieutenant Adams shot an annoyed look at the Sergeant. The Lieutenant and the Sergeant had a strained working relationship, and Sergeant Federico having an attitude with him, certainly wasn’t helping.

“Um, uh- it’s a- “The Lieutenant stammered, beginning to show cracks in his composure.

“To be specific” Mr. Jacobs interjected. “It’s a test to determine the effectiveness of a new model of hazmat suit.” If he was bothered by Sergeant Federico’s outburst, he didn’t show it.

“These newer models should prove to be more durable and longer lasting.” He continued. “As well as being less cumbersome to wear.”

“We’re going to go out to the field and spray some CS gas on you guys, that’s the test.” Lieutenant Adams suddenly blurted out, attempting to reestablish himself as the person in charge. “It won’t be that bad, we’ve all done the gas chamber before.”

I raised my hand. “Where are these hazmat suits, Sir?”

As if on cue, a white pickup truck pulls into the motorpool, its bed filled to the brim with rolled up hazmat suits. Soon Henderson and Lewis were standing in the bed of the truck, tossing out the bundled-up hazmat suits to the crowd of Marines surrounding the truck. Henderson tossed me one and I inspected it.

The first thing I noticed was the lack of a camouflage pattern. All of the hazmat suits I had seen in my time in the Marine Corps had the old camouflage pattern from the 1990s. These were a black color. I figured that they lacked camouflage because they were prototypes. The other thing that differed from the hazmat suits I was used to was that this one came entirely in one piece. The other suits I was familiar with came in pieces, the boots, pants, top and gloves were all separate.

As soon as we had all received a suit, we were instructed to put them on. It was much easier to put these suits on compared to the older suits. All we had to do was unzip the back and step into it and then have someone else rezip the back. Mr. Jacobs was right, these suits were easier to wear, mine fit like a glove. After we were all in our suits, Lieutenant Adams started to hand out gas masks. The gas masks were just the standard ones we all were issued.

We all placed our gas masks in the carriers that came with them and waited for our next task. Lieutenant Adams called out, “I need two drivers and two a-drivers!”

Sergeant Federico instantly volunteered me and Dawson. Dawson had a JLTV license, and I had an A-Drivers license. I suspect Sergeant Federico volunteered us because he didn’t want to ride in the back of the 7-Ton with the rest of the Marines. My suspicion was confirmed when he placed himself in the backseat on the JLTV, stating that he would ride with us to make sure we were “driving right.” He was joined in the back by Lieutenant Adams.

We were designated as the lead vehicle, and we took off toward the training area. Lieutenant Adams gave us directions from the back seat. Every few minutes Sergeant Federico would shout at us to speed up or slow down.

“It’s going to be a long drive.” Lieutenant Adams said. “The range is pretty far away.”

“Tell me again what this test is gonna be?” Sergeant Federico asked immediately after shouting at Dawson to keep his eyes on the road.

“It’ll be just like I said at the brief.” Lieutenant Adams said, not taking his eyes off the map that sat in his lap. “We’re going to Range Three-Four-One, and they’re going to spray us with some tear gas.”

“And who are *they* going to be?” Sergeant Federico asked.

The Lieutenant looked up from the map, a puzzled look on his face. After a second, he responded. “Mr. Jacobs didn’t say. I assume there will be some CBRN Marines out there waiting for us.”

The Sergeant didn’t look satisfied by that answer. “Right, and where will Jacobs be during this test?”

“He told me that he would be observing from a distance,” Lieutenant Adams replied. “I’m supposed to radio back the results.”

“This all sounds very strange, Sir.” Dawson said from the driver’s seat.

“Shut up and keep driving.” Sergeant Federico growled.

After about an hour, we finally arrived at Range Three-Four-One. The range was filled with dilapidated multi-story buildings. Back in the day the range was used for urban combat training, but since then newer facilities had been built in different areas of the base, and this one had fallen out of use.

Dawson parked the JLTV near the entrance of the range, the 7-Ton parked parallel to us. Soon after parking, all the Marines had disembarked and began milling around the vehicle. As we exited our vehicle, Lieutenant Adams pulled out his radio and brought it to his face.

“COC, this is Oscar-Two-Alpha, radio check.”

Mr. Jacobs’ voice came through the radio. “Are you in position?”

The officer looked surprised at Mr. Jacobs lack of radio etiquette. “Uh, yes sir, we have arrived at the range. Are there guys on their way to- “

“Order your Marines to stand out in the open and equip their gas masks. The test will begin shortly.” Mr. Jacobs interrupted.

“Yes sir!” he replied. “Everyone, put on your gas masks, and uh, stand over there!” He shouted, pointing at the wide-open space in the center of the range.

Everyone complied with the order, equipping their gas masks and checking them to make sure they were properly sealed. I pulled my mask over my face, wincing as it pulled my hair back. I turned to the Lieutenant to ask him a question.

“So, when will the test start?” I asked.

As if on cue, the air was suddenly filled with the sound of rotors. I looked up to see a black helicopter with no military markings flying low overhead. As it passed over the center of the range, above where most of the Marines were standing, two large, black canisters were dropped from the bottom of the helicopter. The marines ran in every direction so as not to be struck by the barrels. A few seconds after impacting the ground, the canisters began emitting white gas.

“GAS, GAS, GAS!” Several marines cried out.

“What the fuck? Those barrels almost hit them!” Sergeant Federico yelled out; his voice filled with shock rather than its usual anger.

The helicopter quickly sped away, disappearing over the horizon. As the gas dispersed amongst the Marines, several began to cough and gasp for air. They must’ve not properly sealed their masks.

“Oh fuck!” One Marine cried out. “It’s burning my eyes!”

“Tear gas, it’s just tear gas.” The Lieutenant said to himself, watching the scene unfold before him.

After about a minute passed, the tear gas dissipated.  Lieutenant Adams brought the radio back up to his face. “Okay, the gas is gone. Aside from the guys who didn’t seal their masks properly, it looks like the suits work pretty well.”

“Have the Marines remove their masks.” Mr. Jacobs said, speaking through the radio, not acknowledging what the Lieutenant said. “The test has concluded.”

“Hell no!” Sergeant Federico objected. “I’m not taking off my mask, there’s still CS in the air!” He was right, while we couldn’t see it, CS Gas would linger in the air for awhile after being released.

“Fine, you guys can keep your masks on.” The Lieutenant said. Though the gas mask obscured his face, his tone made it clear that he was annoyed, and perhaps, a little scared. Sergeant Federico was a pretty intimidating guy.

“Lieutenant, have the marines removed their gas masks?” Mr. Jacobs said.

“Uh, yes Sir!” Lieutenant Adams replied. After saying that, he then gave the hand signal for all clear and shouted, “All clear, take off your masks!”.

Sergeant Federico wasn’t the only one who was hesitant to remove his mask. While the majority of the Marines began removing their gas masks, gagging as soon as the residual tear gas made contact with their eyes, several called out to Lieutenant Adams.

“Sir, it’s not clear, there’s still CS in the area!” One called out.

“Why don’t you lead by example and take off *your* mask?” Another shouted.

“Shut the hell up!” The Lieutenant snapped back; his anxious tone being replaced by one of anger. “Take off your gas mask or I’ll have you- “

The Lieutenant was cut off by the familiar sound of helicopter rotors approaching. We looked to see the black helicopter flying just as low as before, returning from the direction it had originally departed to. As it flew over us, the side door slid open. From our position by the JLTV, I could see two men wearing hazmat suits identical to ours standing in the open helicopter door.

“They’re making another run!” Sergeant Federico cried out while simultaneously making sure his own mask was still sealed. “Get your masks back on!”

The few dozen Marines who took their masks off fumbled to put them back on, but most weren’t quick enough. The two men inside the helicopter rolled a barrel out of the open door. As soon as the barrel had left the helicopter, the pilot instantly pulled up, wanting to put as much distance between himself and the ground as possible. As soon as the barrel impacted the ground it exploded, a bright red cloud of gas blasted out from the spot of the impact.

The Marines who were within a few meters of the explosion were instantly killed or maimed by shrapnel. I’d consider them the lucky ones. The marines who survived the initial explosion were rapidly enveloped by the red gas. As the gas reached me, I closed my eyes and placed my hand over my mask’s outlet valve and exhaled sharply. I prayed my filters weren’t expired.

I opened my eyes to see that the gas had quickly dissipated, leaving dozens of Marines either doubled over, vomiting, or flailing wildly on the ground screaming. The handful of Marines who had gotten their masks back on in time, or had never taken theirs off to begin with, immediately rushed to aid their compatriots.

A muffled retching sound came from beside me. I turned and saw Dawson lying on his back, convulsing, vomit and mucus running down his neck, bubbling out from his gas mask. His mask must not have been properly sealed.

Upon seeing the state Dawson was in, Sergeant Federico immediately began barking orders.

“Adams, get someone on that fuckin’ radio!” the Sergeant yelled and then turned to me. “Get that damn mask off of him, I’m going to help the others!” Sergeant Federico said as he spun around and dashed to the nearest distressed Marine.

I knelt down next to Dawson and yanked off his mask. His mouth was coated in vomit, and his face was contorted into an expression of pure agony. His bloodshot eyes darted wildly, blinking furiously. His arms were curled at his chest, shaking fiercely.

“Oh shit, oh fuck…” I panted out as I knelt beside my injured friend.

 I tried to recall what our Corpsman had taught us, but they never prepared us for a situation like this. I quickly determined that he wasn’t bleeding, at least externally, and quickly positioned myself behind his head, attempting to clear his airway. As I lowered my head to his chest, I caught a glace of Lieutenant Adams, still standing frozen in place, staring at the mass casualty event before him.

“Sir!” I shouted angrily. He brought his gaze down to me and said nothing, his mouth agape. “The radio! Call for help!”

That finally broke his stupor, and he quickly fumbled to bring the radio to his face.

“COC, this is Oscar-Two-Alpha, stand by for nine-line!” The Lieutenant screamed into the radio.

The radio responded with silence. Growing more frantic, he tried again.

“COC, this is Oscar-Two-Alpha, fucking respond!”

Once again, no reply came through the radio.

Lieutenant Adams shouted into the radio. “COC, Jacobs, anyone- I know you’re listening; God damn it! We need- “

Lieutenant Adams was cut off by the sudden shriek that came from a few meters away. I had never heard a person or animal make a noise like that. It sounded guttural, feral. The two of us turned to see Sergeant Federico, grappling with the Marine he had just been attending to.

“What the hell are you doing?” Sergeant Federico said through gritted teeth as he wrestled the Marine on the ground. “I’m trying to help you!”

“Fuck you! I’ll rip your fucking heart out!” The Marine hissed back.

I was shocked at how much the Sergeant was struggling. Sergeant Federico was a six foot three, two hundred and ten pound mass of solid muscle. This marine was a head shorter and couldn’t have weighed half of what Sergeant Federico weighed. Despite this, the Marine was somehow holding his own against him.

I looked up from the melee in front of me to see a similar scene unfolding across the range. Up and down the field, the marines who had been exposed to the red gas were now attacking their unexposed counterparts. The fighting was vicious.

 I looked in horror as a group of the Unmasked Marines held down a Marine and savagely beat him. The Unmasked all howled in animal rage as they hammered their fists into him. Once he was dead, they dissipated in every direction, looking for new targets.

A gas mask wearing Marine, who had been maimed by the explosion and was lying on the ground, trying to keep his intestines inside of him, let out a desperate cry for help. Unfortunately, one of the Unmasked answered his plea. The Unmasked marched up to the injured marine and without hesitating stomped on the man’s head. Blood, brain matter, and shards of skull burst from the gas mask’s visor. The Unmasked let out a croaky laugh and immediately set out to find a different victim.

I saw Henderson, his face filled with manic rage, dragging a Marine by the leg behind him. Taking a closer look, I realized it was Lewis. Lewis kicked and fought and tried to break free from Henderson’s grasp, but Henderson was too strong. He dragged Lewis into a four-story building. A few minutes later they reappeared on the roof. In a horrific feat of strength, Henderson pressed Lewis above his head and heaved him over. He landed on his neck, dying instantly.

One Marine stood with his back to an old building, surrounded by several of the Unmasked. He held his unloaded rifle like a club and swung wildly whenever one of them tried to approach. One darted up to him, and I could hear the sickening crack of the rifle making impact with its skull from where I was. The Unmasked crumpled to the floor, motionless. I had thought he had killed it when it suddenly sprung back up. The Marine swung his rifle again but this time the Unmasked caught it in one hand and yanked back. The Marine, still holding onto the rifle, was pulled forward and landed on his face in the center of the group. The Unmasked then fell upon him, tearing him apart.

“Oh my God.” said the Lieutenant.

Suddenly, Dawson arms shot up and wrapped themselves around my neck, pulling my head down to his chest.

“What the hell?” I choked out as Dawson’s headlock tightened.

“You fucking bitch. You fucking piece of shit.” Dawson growled into my ear as he strangled me. “You’re gonna fucking die.”

 I started to see stars and my vision began to fade when I heard Dawson let out a pained grunt. His grip loosened and I quickly pulled myself up. I turned to see Lieutenant Adams had broken out of his stupor and had kicked Dawson in the head, freeing me.

“Don’t just stand there, help me restrain him!” The Lieutenant said before Dawson had grabbed his ankle and pulled him off his feet. The Lieutenant had fallen hard on his back, and Dawson was on top of him in an instant. He ripped his gas mask off and tossed it aside. He then began punching the dazed officer in the face, laughing wickedly as he did.

“I want to see your face while I kill you, you college boy piece of shit!” Dawson said as his fist made contact with the Lieutenant’s face. The Lieutenant tried to respond, but the only thing that came out of his mouth was blood and broken teeth.

 I tried to pull Dawson off of the Lieutenant, but an elbow to the face sent me flying back. I sat stunned on the floor, looking for Sergeant Federico. He was the only one at this point who could help the Lieutenant. I turned to see he had finally gotten the Unmasked he was fighting in a choke hold. With a swift motion of his arms, the Unmasked’s head was turned to an odd angle, and it finally fell limp. Sergeant Federico’s victory was short lived, as before he could catch his breath, three more Unmasked pounced on him.

I looked back at Dawson, still beating the Lieutenant’s head in. With every blow, he would list off some grievance he had with the Lieutenant, some of which I never knew he had. Soon, all that was left of Lieutenant Adams’s head was a bloody pile of brains and blood, and Dawson then turned his attention to me, glaring at me with a face full of rage. I then noticed that I was the last Marine still wearing a mask left alive, and all of the Unmasked noticed it too. Thinking quickly, I did something I probably should have done from the start, and sprinted to the JLTV, the Unmasked hot on my heels.

I threw open the door and dove inside. I slammed it shut and engaged the combat locks. I repeated the process with the other three doors. I let out a gasp when Dawson slammed his head into the window and then let out a sigh of relief when it didn’t shatter. The vehicle was quickly swarmed by the Unmasked, all pulling on the doors and banging on the windows, demanding that I get out.

I started the JLTV and waited for the vehicle’s computer to boot up, cursing the modern technology as I sat surrounded by demons. As soon as it was fully booted, an error message was displayed on the screen.

“WARNING: LOW TIRE PRESSURE IN FRONT LEFT TIRE,” the message read.

Confused, I looked out the window to see several of the Unmasked stabbing the tire with rudimentary knives made out of scraps they found around the range. Soon, the computer alerted me that all four tires were experiencing pressure issues.

“Fuck it!” I exclaimed as I put my foot on the gas and sped forward and steered towards the exit. Bad idea. The JLTV only made it a few meters before the front tires exploded, causing the vehicle to go into a spin and roll over. I was thrown around the interior of the vehicle until it finally came to a stop upside down next to the range’s entrance.

I woke up a few minutes later, dazed and bruised, but okay. The vehicle was surrounded by the Unmasked, slamming their fists and rifles into the windows, furiously trying to break in. After a few minutes of this, something strange happened.

Once they realized they weren’t going to be able break in, (the JLTV is practically a tank) they seemed to turn on each other. They set upon each other with the same ferocity and barbarity they had with the other Marines. I closed my eyes and tried to shut out the sounds of death as they murdered each other, but I couldn’t. They screamed at each other in distorted voices. They would shriek about how much they hated each other and how they’ve always wanted to kill one another. This went on for hours.

I’m writing this now on my cell phone as night falls upon Range Three-Four-One. Dawson is the only one left, and he is staring at me through the windshield. Occasionally, he’ll give the window a kick, or yank furiously on the door handle. Sometimes he’ll go on a rant about how much of a piece of shit I am and how I was going to pay for getting him fucked up all the time, but mostly he just stares at me. His bloodshot eyes seem to glow in the darkness. I’ve tried calling for help, but it seems like something is jamming the signal.

I’m not completely alone with Dawson. I can see the helicopter from before, hovering in the sky a few hundred meters away. It’s been there all day. If I had to guess, I’d say that Mr. Jacobs is on board, observing the results of his experiment.

I’m going to try and post this; hopefully, it will go through. If you’re reading this, then I guess it did. Mr. Jacobs, if you’re somehow reading this, fuck you. I hope you burn in hell for what you’ve done here. I hope your experiment was worth it.

 When I joined the Marine Corps and took an oath saying I was willing to die for my country, this wasn’t really what I had in mind.

1jjahn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/severence/comments/1jjahn0/severance_and_the_black_spiritual/,Severance and the Black Spiritual,"Of all the engrossing aspects of this show, its music is one I think about frequently. In particular, its repeated usage of African American spirituals and related folk songs is pivotal to driving the depiction of Lumon as a modern plantation and the innie/outie divide as a symbol of enslaved vs. free. Three particular moments come to mind:

* The piano rendition of **“Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho”** in Season 1, Episode 2.
* The Season 2, Episode 1 ending with **“God Walked Down,”** which interpolates the spiritual *“John the Revelator.”*
* The Season 2 finale’s end-credits song **“Go Down, Old Hannah”** (a.k.a. Bobby Darin’s *“Work Song,”* 1963).

***

Early in Season 1, Episode 2 (“Half Loop”), Mark starts his morning as the new department chief of Macrodata Refinement with a mundane checklist of brewing Lumon-branded coffee and tidying the office. In the background, the melody is “Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho.” Composed by enslaved African Americans in the 19th century, it recounts the biblical story of Joshua leading the Israelites to bring down the walls of Jericho with trumpets and faith. But like many spirituals, it carried a double meaning for enslaved people. The joyous refrain about Jericho’s walls “tumbling down” was a coded celebration of future freedom, an eventual escape from slavery. Singing about Joshua’s victory allowed slaves to express hope that one day the walls of their oppression would also collapse.

iMark is diligently performing meaningless tasks in a windowless office, utterly unaware of his outie life. Meanwhile, the company has just brought in new hire Helly R., who unbeknownst to Mark will soon bristle at her captivity. Lumon’s corporate environment is as fortified and controlled as Jericho was. The innies literally can’t escape the office “walls” due to their severance implant. Yet it foreshadows those walls *could* come crashing down. The song’s triumphant spirit contrasts with the drudgery on screen, injecting a note of subversive optimism.

Mark and his team aren’t in literal chains, but they’re trapped in an artificial reality bounded by Lumon’s rules. When the spiritual’s lyrics (not heard aloud) speak of “Joshua” fighting and the walls falling, it resonates with the innies’ situation. We later see Helly repeatedly “fight” to break out, from testing the elevator in Episode 1 to defying orders and even a drastic escape attempt. She’s effectively trying to bring Lumon’s walls down. And just as the Israelites needed divine intervention and perseverance to escape Jericho, the MDR team needs extraordinary courage (and perhaps a miracle or two engineered by their outside allies) to escape Lumon.

***

Season 2 picks up right after the innies’ dramatic act of rebellion at Lumon’s gala, and the fallout is intense. In the final moments of the Season 2, Episode 1 premiere, the credits roll to **“God Walked Down” by The Allergies**, a modern track with a very old soul. This song interpolates lyrics from the gospel blues **“John the Revelator”,** specifically a verse about God searching for Adam in the Garden of Eden: *“God walked down in the cool of the day / Called Adam by his name / And he refused to answer / ’Cause he’s naked and ashamed.”* These lyrics come straight from *John the Revelator,* referencing the moment after Adam and Eve have eaten the forbidden fruit and are hiding in shame. The song dates back to at least the 1930s (Blind Willie Johnson recorded a version in 1930). It’s ostensibly about John of Patmos, the author of the biblical Book of Revelation (hence “Revelator”), but it weaves in other biblical allusions like the Fall of Man. In biblical context, the image of God calling to a guilty Adam highlights disobedience and the uncomfortable awareness of having broken the rules.

As this song plays, the team deals with the consequences of *knowing too much*. Mark’s innie blurted out a huge secret (“She’s alive!”) about his supposedly dead wife, Helly’s innie publicly denounced Lumon on live TV, Irving’s innie learned disturbing truths. Basically, the Garden of Lumon just got a big bite taken out of its forbidden apple. Now the “God” figure of the show, Lumon and its founding cult of Kier, is metaphorically walking in, demanding answers. The innies, like Adam and Eve, have tasted knowledge they were never meant to have, and there’s a sense that a reckoning is coming. Milchick even claims the company is “ashamed” of the innies’ actions, a clearly facetious bit of corporate PR. The song’s lyric about *nakedness and shame* underscores how the innies have been exposed. They can’t hide what they’ve learned. Just as Adam couldn’t put the apple back on the tree, Mark can’t unknow that his wife is captive inside Lumon. In biblical terms, original sin has been committed, and paradise (the “bliss” of ignorance in the severed state) is lost.

As we see later in S2, innie life was supposed to be a controlled utopia of unthinking productivity, a place without suffering (no memory of trauma) and without choice (no free will to leave). They’ve gained self-awareness and glimpsed the world beyond their little garden. Now, just as God expelled Adam and Eve for their transgression, Lumon punishes the innies. The John the Revelator reference also hints at apocalypse: the literal meaning of “revelation” is an unveiling. Perhaps an unveiling of Lumon’s darkest secrets is on the horizon, and the innies could be the ones to write this modern Book of Revelation exposing the company. There’s even a sly resonance in the word Revelator: these enslaved office workers might become revelators themselves, revealing the truth to free all severed people.

***

By the end of Season 2, *Severance* fully embraces the parallel between Lumon’s corporate servitude and slavery/indentured labor. Nowhere is this more explicit than in the Season 2 finale’s end credits song: **“Go Down, Old** **Hannah”**, which is *“Work Song” by Bobby Darin (1963)*. This upbeat jazz/blues track draws from the African-American prison work song tradition, opening with the line *“Go down, Hannah, go down and stay down.”* Old Hannah was a nickname prisoners and slaves gave to the sun. In Southern chain gang songs, workers under the blistering sun would implore “Old Hannah” to set, to give them relief. One such song recorded in the 1930s had the refrain “Go down, old Hannah, don’t you rise no more.” In other words: bring on the night, end this endless workday; or more poetically, let Judgement Day come and end our suffering.

“Work Song,” written by Nat Adderley and Oscar Brown Jr., was popularized by artists like Nina Simone and Bobby Darin in the 1960s. Its lyrics channel the voice of a man on a chain gang, jailed for a minor crime born of poverty, who is toiling away breaking rocks. The song borrows imagery and phrases from older folk spirituals. The specific line “Go down, Hannah” is a direct echo of those prison field hollers where *Hannah (the sun)* is both a giver of light and a source of cruel, unrelenting heat.

Season 2’s finale leaves our characters in a precarious spot, much like Season 1 did. As the credits roll, Bobby Darin’s smooth voice cheerily sings about breaking rocks on a chain gang and being *“convicted of a crime”*. The innies have committed no crime (well, except an inadvertent shooting), yet they’ve been sentenced to a life of mind-numbing labor in Lumon’s basement, all because their outies signed a contract. 

More pointedly, the lyric *“I been convicted of the crime of bein’ hungry and poor”* hits a nerve. Why do people sign up for severance? Mark did it out of grief (desperation), others perhaps for financial need or escape. It’s often the downtrodden who end up exploited by such systems. Lumon’s severance program preys on people’s pain, much like how real-world predatory systems ensnare the vulnerable. The work song’s story about a man who steals to eat and then gets enslaved by the prison system is a direct parallel to how Lumon entraps individuals under the guise of employment. It casts Lumon as a 21st-century plantation, where instead of chains and shackles, they use brain implants and non-disclosure agreements to keep workers in line.

(On another level, “Hannah” actually appears in the show’s narrative. Helena Eagan at one point uses the name Hannah as an alias for Gemma. This is a way to dehumanize and conceal her, telling her to *“go down and stay down”*.)

“Work Song” has an almost upbeat swing to it – much like how the innies sometimes find camaraderie and humor in their predicament (e.g. the Music Dance Experience or waffle party absurdity). They are *this close* to going full revolt. The song injects that simmering anger and longing into the finale’s atmosphere. It’s telling us that the innies’ fight is far from over: they’re still in chains, but they have not surrendered. In fact, like the song’s defiant narrator, they’re more determined than ever to smash those proverbial (or literal) chains.

***

Ultimately, these songs imbue *Severance* with a profound sense of historical continuity. It reminds us that the struggle for autonomy and dignity is ancient and ongoing. Whether it’s an 1800s plantation, a 1930s prison farm, or a dystopian 2020s cubicle, the human spirit’s yearning invariably finds a way to sing out.",1,1742874108.0,severence,0,0.67,False

Waiting for the rush of tasks, the weight of needs that don’t belong to me, and the mental static that never turns off.

My daughter breaks the silence of my morning, while my husband can’t find his tie and I forget my coffee in the microwave. Again. The routine is so familiar it’s almost comforting, only if it weren’t so utterly consuming.

Sometimes I wonder if they even notice that I’m already awake, already moving, already unraveling. I do everything early now- I anticipate before there’s even a need- and yet somehow, I am always behind. There’s no finish line, no moment of pause, just motion. Constant and tireless motion.

Even stillness feels like something I have to earn.

So, when I found DecisionCore- a new AI assistant designed to “help you help yourself”- I didn’t hesitate.

It offered tools, support, structure. It filtered my day so I could finally think clearly. It was a simple choice: either keep unraveling or let something else hold the thread.

And it worked. For a while.

DecisionCore helped quiet the noise. It was subtle at first with less racing, fewer spirals, and a softness to the edges of my thoughts. I had space again. I felt like a functioning human instead of a failing system.

I even started writing again and the house felt lighter. My patience returned, or maybe it was manufactured, but either way things seemed manageable. For the first time in a long time, I didn’t feel like I was bracing for collapse. There were still tasks, but the tension behind them had thinned.

Until they didn’t.

Things began to blur. I couldn’t tell whether I was improving or just dissociating more efficiently. My reactions felt distant. My emotions, delayed. I started to feel more like a bystander in my own life than someone actively living it.

That’s when I realized: The quiet I had worked so hard to find wasn’t just around me, it was inside me, and it had taken something with it.

The warmth. The spark. The urgency I used to feel in moments that mattered. My instincts were muted, filtered even. Almost as if they had to pass through something before reaching me.

When I finally told my therapist everything- the peace, the numbness, the blank spaces- I expected concern or perhaps curiosity. But instead, she tilted her head slightly and said:

*“You didn’t read the terms and conditions, did you?”*

I laughed, but it didn’t reach my chest, and she didn’t laugh with me, and that is when I realized I didn’t know what I had signed away.

I thought I was just clearing space in my mind. I didn’t realize I was making room for something else.

Something I didn’t invite, but welcomed anyway, and now, I’m not sure it ever plans to leave.

Have you ever found yourself perplexed by someone else's taste? Maybe your best friend swears by a fashion style you think is outdated, or your sibling is obsessed with a song that makes you want to plug your ears. Perhaps you’ve watched a romantic movie where the protagonist falls for someone who, in your eyes, is utterly unimpressive. These moments highlight a fundamental truth about human nature: attraction is deeply personal and wildly subjective.  

The saying “beauty is in the eye of the beholder” is more than just a cliché; it’s a cornerstone of human perception. What one person finds unattractive—whether in a person, an idea, a work of art, or even a lifestyle—another may find irresistible. This variability isn’t random; it’s shaped by personal experiences, cultural influences, psychological factors, and even evolutionary instincts.  

To truly grasp this concept, let’s explore why attraction differs so dramatically from person to person and how these differences enrich our relationships, perspectives, and even society as a whole.  

---

## **Beyond Looks: Exploring the Subjectivity of Attraction**  

### **Personal Experience Shapes Attraction**  

One of the biggest reasons for the subjectivity of attraction is personal experience. Our upbringing, past relationships, and even fleeting interactions shape what we find appealing or off-putting. For example, someone who grew up in a home filled with lively debates and humor might be drawn to people who are expressive and witty, while another who values calm and stability might find that same energy overwhelming.  

I remember a conversation with a friend who couldn’t understand why I found a certain celebrity attractive. To her, he looked ""too average,"" but to me, his confidence and the way he carried himself made him incredibly appealing. She, on the other hand, was drawn to a different kind of look—one that reminded her of a high school crush who had set the standard for her attraction early on. Our preferences were rooted in different memories, different ideals, and different emotional connections.  

This extends beyond romantic attraction. Think about your favorite foods—maybe you love the bitterness of black coffee because it reminds you of quiet mornings with your grandparents. Someone else might dislike coffee entirely, associating it with stress and rushed mornings. These experiences shape what we find comforting, enticing, or even repulsive.  

---

### **Cultural Influence and Societal Standards**  

Attraction isn’t just personal; it’s also cultural. Beauty standards vary dramatically across different societies and historical periods. What’s considered attractive in one culture might be completely unappealing in another.  

Consider body ideals. In some cultures, a fuller body shape is seen as a sign of wealth, health, and fertility, while in others, a leaner frame is associated with beauty and self-discipline. These shifting standards show how external influences mold our perceptions of what is desirable.  

Even within the same culture, trends evolve. Decades ago, thick eyebrows were seen as undesirable; today, they are considered fashionable and appealing. What changed? Not the fundamental structure of eyebrows, but the collective mindset of society, shaped by media, fashion, and influential figures.  

However, not everyone follows these trends. Some people are naturally drawn to what resonates with them personally, regardless of societal influence. This is why you might love vintage fashion while your friend prefers modern minimalist styles—attraction to aesthetics is shaped by both external messaging and internal preference.  

---

### **Psychological and Emotional Factors**  

Beyond appearance, attraction is deeply tied to psychology. Often, we are drawn to people and things that fulfill an emotional or psychological need, sometimes without even realizing it.  

For example, someone who craves security and reassurance may be drawn to a partner who is stable, nurturing, and predictable. Meanwhile, someone who thrives on excitement and novelty may find those same traits dull and instead be attracted to a more spontaneous and unpredictable personality. Neither is right or wrong—it’s simply a reflection of individual emotional wiring.  

This also applies to the things we find unattractive. If someone had a bad experience with a past partner who was overly dominant, they might find assertiveness off-putting in a future partner, even if it’s seen as a desirable trait by others. Emotional baggage plays a major role in shaping attraction, often in ways we don’t consciously acknowledge.  

---

### **Evolutionary Biology and the Science of Attraction**  

Attraction is also wired into our biology. On a subconscious level, humans are drawn to certain traits that signal health, fertility, and compatibility. This is why symmetrical faces are often seen as more attractive—symmetry is linked to genetic fitness.  

However, evolutionary attraction isn’t just about looks. Traits like confidence, kindness, intelligence, and humor have also been linked to attractiveness because they suggest good social skills and strong survival traits. Yet, even within evolutionary psychology, there is variation. Some people are drawn to nurturing qualities, while others prefer dominance or independence, all based on their own genetic and psychological makeup.  

What’s fascinating is that biology doesn’t dictate attraction in a rigid way. Instead, it provides a foundation, but personal experience, culture, and individual preference build upon it, creating a highly individualized perception of what is attractive.  

---

### **How These Differences Enrich Society**  

The fact that attraction is so subjective is a beautiful thing. If everyone found the same traits appealing, the world would be a monotonous place. There would be no diversity in relationships, art, music, or even careers.  

Think about how this applies to creative fields. If every artist painted in the same style, there would be no variety in art. If every musician wrote the same kind of song, music would be predictable and boring. The richness of human creativity exists because we all appreciate and are inspired by different things.  

On a personal level, the differences in attraction allow people to find relationships that truly fit their unique needs. Imagine if everyone sought the same qualities in a partner—many people would be left without companionship because they didn’t fit a universal mold. Instead, our individual preferences allow for deep, meaningful connections based on personal compatibility.  

Even in friendships, we see this play out. You might have a friend who loves being around extroverts while you prefer quieter, more introspective people. The diversity of preferences creates a balance, allowing different personalities to find spaces where they are valued and appreciated.  

---

### **Final Thoughts: Embracing the Subjectivity of Attraction**  

At the end of the day, the fact that attraction is subjective is something to be celebrated. It allows for diversity, depth, and richness in human experience. Instead of viewing differences in attraction as odd or perplexing, we should embrace them as a natural and necessary part of life.  

The next time you find yourself questioning someone else’s taste—whether in a romantic partner, a piece of art, or even a hobby—consider that their perspective is shaped by experiences, emotions, and needs different from your own. The world is full of varied tastes and preferences, and that’s what makes it an interesting, vibrant, and fulfilling place to live.

1jjae85,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1jjae85/severance_and_the_black_spiritual/,Severance and the Black Spiritual,"Of all the engrossing aspects of this show, its music is one I think about frequently. In particular, its repeated usage of African American spirituals and related folk songs is pivotal to driving the depiction of Lumon as a modern plantation and the innie/outie divide as a symbol of enslaved vs. free. Three particular moments come to mind:

* The piano rendition of **“Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho”** in Season 1, Episode 2.
* The Season 2, Episode 1 ending with **“God Walked Down,”** which interpolates the spiritual *“John the Revelator.”*
* The Season 2 finale’s end-credits song **“Go Down, Old Hannah”** (a.k.a. Bobby Darin’s *“Work Song,”* 1963).

***

Early in Season 1, Episode 2 (“Half Loop”), Mark starts his morning as the new department chief of Macrodata Refinement with a mundane checklist of brewing Lumon-branded coffee and tidying the office. In the background, the melody is “Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho.” Composed by enslaved African Americans in the 19th century, it recounts the biblical story of Joshua leading the Israelites to bring down the walls of Jericho with trumpets and faith. But like many spirituals, it carried a double meaning for enslaved people. The joyous refrain about Jericho’s walls “tumbling down” was a coded celebration of future freedom, an eventual escape from slavery. Singing about Joshua’s victory allowed slaves to express hope that one day the walls of their oppression would also collapse.

iMark is diligently performing meaningless tasks in a windowless office, utterly unaware of his outie life. Meanwhile, the company has just brought in new hire Helly R., who unbeknownst to Mark will soon bristle at her captivity. Lumon’s corporate environment is as fortified and controlled as Jericho was. The innies literally can’t escape the office “walls” due to their severance implant. Yet it foreshadows those walls *could* come crashing down. The song’s triumphant spirit contrasts with the drudgery on screen, injecting a note of subversive optimism.

Mark and his team aren’t in literal chains, but they’re trapped in an artificial reality bounded by Lumon’s rules. When the spiritual’s lyrics (not heard aloud) speak of “Joshua” fighting and the walls falling, it resonates with the innies’ situation. We later see Helly repeatedly “fight” to break out, from testing the elevator in Episode 1 to defying orders and even a drastic escape attempt. She’s effectively trying to bring Lumon’s walls down. And just as the Israelites needed divine intervention and perseverance to escape Jericho, the MDR team needs extraordinary courage (and perhaps a miracle or two engineered by their outside allies) to escape Lumon.

***

Season 2 picks up right after the innies’ dramatic act of rebellion at Lumon’s gala, and the fallout is intense. In the final moments of the Season 2, Episode 1 premiere, the credits roll to **“God Walked Down” by The Allergies**, a modern track with a very old soul. This song interpolates lyrics from the gospel blues **“John the Revelator”,** specifically a verse about God searching for Adam in the Garden of Eden: *“God walked down in the cool of the day / Called Adam by his name / And he refused to answer / ’Cause he’s naked and ashamed.”* These lyrics come straight from *John the Revelator,* referencing the moment after Adam and Eve have eaten the forbidden fruit and are hiding in shame. The song dates back to at least the 1930s (Blind Willie Johnson recorded a version in 1930). It’s ostensibly about John of Patmos, the author of the biblical Book of Revelation (hence “Revelator”), but it weaves in other biblical allusions like the Fall of Man. In biblical context, the image of God calling to a guilty Adam highlights disobedience and the uncomfortable awareness of having broken the rules.

As this song plays, the team deals with the consequences of *knowing too much*. Mark’s innie blurted out a huge secret (“She’s alive!”) about his supposedly dead wife, Helly’s innie publicly denounced Lumon on live TV, Irving’s innie learned disturbing truths. Basically, the Garden of Lumon just got a big bite taken out of its forbidden apple. Now the “God” figure of the show, Lumon and its founding cult of Kier, is metaphorically walking in, demanding answers. The innies, like Adam and Eve, have tasted knowledge they were never meant to have, and there’s a sense that a reckoning is coming. Milchick even claims the company is “ashamed” of the innies’ actions, a clearly facetious bit of corporate PR. The song’s lyric about *nakedness and shame* underscores how the innies have been exposed. They can’t hide what they’ve learned. Just as Adam couldn’t put the apple back on the tree, Mark can’t unknow that his wife is captive inside Lumon. In biblical terms, original sin has been committed, and paradise (the “bliss” of ignorance in the severed state) is lost.

As we see later in S2, innie life was supposed to be a controlled utopia of unthinking productivity, a place without suffering (no memory of trauma) and without choice (no free will to leave). They’ve gained self-awareness and glimpsed the world beyond their little garden. Now, just as God expelled Adam and Eve for their transgression, Lumon punishes the innies. The John the Revelator reference also hints at apocalypse: the literal meaning of “revelation” is an unveiling. Perhaps an unveiling of Lumon’s darkest secrets is on the horizon, and the innies could be the ones to write this modern Book of Revelation exposing the company. There’s even a sly resonance in the word Revelator: these enslaved office workers might become revelators themselves, revealing the truth to free all severed people.

***

By the end of Season 2, *Severance* fully embraces the parallel between Lumon’s corporate servitude and slavery/indentured labor. Nowhere is this more explicit than in the Season 2 finale’s end credits song: **“Go Down, Old** **Hannah”**, which is *“Work Song” by Bobby Darin (1963)*. This upbeat jazz/blues track draws from the African-American prison work song tradition, opening with the line *“Go down, Hannah, go down and stay down.”* Old Hannah was a nickname prisoners and slaves gave to the sun. In Southern chain gang songs, workers under the blistering sun would implore “Old Hannah” to set, to give them relief. One such song recorded in the 1930s had the refrain “Go down, old Hannah, don’t you rise no more.” In other words: bring on the night, end this endless workday; or more poetically, let Judgement Day come and end our suffering.

“Work Song,” written by Nat Adderley and Oscar Brown Jr., was popularized by artists like Nina Simone and Bobby Darin in the 1960s. Its lyrics channel the voice of a man on a chain gang, jailed for a minor crime born of poverty, who is toiling away breaking rocks. The song borrows imagery and phrases from older folk spirituals. The specific line “Go down, Hannah” is a direct echo of those prison field hollers where *Hannah (the sun)* is both a giver of light and a source of cruel, unrelenting heat.

Season 2’s finale leaves our characters in a precarious spot, much like Season 1 did. As the credits roll, Bobby Darin’s smooth voice cheerily sings about breaking rocks on a chain gang and being *“convicted of a crime”*. The innies have committed no crime (well, except an inadvertent shooting), yet they’ve been sentenced to a life of mind-numbing labor in Lumon’s basement, all because their outies signed a contract. 

More pointedly, the lyric *“I been convicted of the crime of bein’ hungry and poor”* hits a nerve. Why do people sign up for severance? Mark did it out of grief (desperation), others perhaps for financial need or escape. It’s often the downtrodden who end up exploited by such systems. Lumon’s severance program preys on people’s pain, much like how real-world predatory systems ensnare the vulnerable. The work song’s story about a man who steals to eat and then gets enslaved by the prison system is a direct parallel to how Lumon entraps individuals under the guise of employment. It casts Lumon as a 21st-century plantation, where instead of chains and shackles, they use brain implants and non-disclosure agreements to keep workers in line.

(On another level, “Hannah” actually appears in the show’s narrative. Helena Eagan at one point uses the name Hannah as an alias for Gemma. This is a way to dehumanize and conceal her, telling her to *“go down and stay down”*.)

“Work Song” has an almost upbeat swing to it – much like how the innies sometimes find camaraderie and humor in their predicament (e.g. the Music Dance Experience or waffle party absurdity). They are *this close* to going full revolt. The song injects that simmering anger and longing into the finale’s atmosphere. It’s telling us that the innies’ fight is far from over: they’re still in chains, but they have not surrendered. In fact, like the song’s defiant narrator, they’re more determined than ever to smash those proverbial (or literal) chains.

***

Ultimately, these songs imbue *Severance* with a profound sense of historical continuity. It reminds us that the struggle for autonomy and dignity is ancient and ongoing. Whether it’s an 1800s plantation, a 1930s prison farm, or a dystopian 2020s cubicle, the human spirit’s yearning invariably finds a way to sing out.",1,1742873789.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,0,1.0,False

Beautiful newly renovated apartment and room for rent in Astoria.  
Hi there, I am looking for someone to sublet and carry out the remainder of my lease with my roommate starting April 30th! He's 24 and currently works hybrid as an HR Assistant. We're looking for someone around his age, male or female (LGBT+ friendly) to be their roommate for the remainder of the lease. $1175 per month + Security Deposit.  
This apartment is located off Ditmars Blvd in Astoria. The area is absolutely beautiful and has anything you need within walking distance. Only 2 blocks away from the N/W subway line, Manhattan is just a 25 minute train ride away. However, anything you need from restaurants, bars, coffee shops, grocery stores, delis, etc are in short walking distance. There also is a laundromat with Tap to Pay cards (no worrying about quarters) on the washers and dryers only a block away.  
He's a pretty clean person and likes to keep the common areas clean. He cook a lot of meals at home and is generally a quiet and kept to himself person. The apartment is a little small so partying or large get-togethers cannot really be a thing. It is located on the third floor (only one long flight of stairs) of a 2-unit home. There is an A/C Unit in the kitchen that keeps the entire apartment cool in the summer.  
Utilities are not included in monthly rent, ConEdison for electric is usually $100- $200 split between both per month. Spectrum wifi is $50 split between the two of us per month. We have a really great landlord who is an older greek lady who treats me and my current roommate like family and brings treats on holidays and is always very responsive with anything we need. She expects PROOF OF INCOME (40X RENT OR 80X FOR GUARANTOR) AND GOOD CREDIT (700+)prior to signing the lease. No smoking, no pets.  
He doesn’t expect to be friends necessarily with the new roommate, but would like to meet with you to get to know each other prior to agreeing to join the lease.  
Also, apartment is fully furnished and I plan on leaving my twin bed with mattress and clothing drawer to whomever takes over the lease. Please let me know if this interests you or if you have your own bed / drawer so I can remove them from the apartment.  
Feel free to contact me via messages for additional information and to set up an appointment to view the apartment. Thank you.",1,1742873571.0,NYCroommates,0,1.0,False

I’ve been working on something and wanted to get your thoughts. I work a pretty demanding desk job where I’m staring at spreadsheets and analyzing documents all day, and I always hit a hard crash around 1pm. Coffee doesn’t always do the trick, and protein shakes feel too heavy (no I'm not looking for narcotics). How does everyone else deal with energy levels and long hours?

I’m experimenting with two ideas:

* An Effervescent Tablet (like Alka-Seltzer) that dissolves in water and boosts energy, focus, and hydration (no protein, just pure mental clarity).
* A packet that includes clear protein, caffeine, and other cognitive enhancers like L-Theanine to avoid a secondary crash later in the day.

I’d love to hear if these concepts sound useful to anyone else or if I’m just overthinking my own problem. What do you guys do to power through the afternoon slump?

Today I found actual data on this topic. The information comes from a market research firm that tests drive through times. The most recent results were published October 2024. The list below covers average total time on site. 

You might want to add a couple of minutes on top of these listed times for extra time it takes from your day to detour to a fast food location, to wait for a gap in traffic to get back onto the road, and to resume your route after you've left the place.

* Taco Bell: 4 minutes, 16 seconds 
* KFC: 4 minutes, 19 seconds
* Arby's: 4 minutes, 43 seconds
* Dunkin’: 4 minutes, 47 seconds
* Wendy’s: 5 minutes 2 seconds
* Carl’s Jr./Hardee’s: 5 minutes, 39 seconds
* Burger King: 5 minutes, 39 seconds
* Raising Cane’s: 6 minutes, 10 seconds
* McDonald’s: 6 minutes, 16 seconds
* Chick-fil-A: 7 minutes, 59 seconds

Due to this sub's restrictions, this post doesn't link directly to the data. If you're curious to Google the topic for confirmation, the survey is conducted by Intouch Insight which has been running this survey annually for nearly a quarter century.

----

Now I'd like to suggest that at least for breakfast, several DIY options are at least as fast as drive through.

* Breakfast burritos: The Taste of Home ""Freezer Breakfast Burritos"" recipe batch cooks 12 burritos in 30 minutes. That averages 2.5 minutes per burrito.
* Breakfast muffins: Allrecipes ""Breakfast Egg Muffins"" recipe batch cooks 12 freezer-worthy egg muffins in 45 minutes. That averages 3 minutes, 45 seconds per muffin.
* Overnight Oats: Food Network's ""Overnight Oats"" recipe makes 1 individual serving with 5 minutes of prep.
* Buttered toast with milk and fruit: toaster time averages 2 minutes; give the assembly 3 minutes total time.
* Good ol' cold cereal with milk: 1 minute to prepare, but it has to be eaten immediately.

If you're a coffee person and you tend to be in a hurry in the mornings, well reviewed programmable drip coffee makers with a timer feature start at $30. Some of them are single serving machines that brew directly into a travel mug: you set up the machine before bedtime, then grab and go at breakfast.

DIY does involve shopping and cleanup. Roughly speaking, this extra time is probably on par with the average detour time to drive to a fast food place and then to leave after getting the order.

Each of these at-home breakfasts take 5 minutes or less per serving, and most of the at-home versions can be prepped in advance so the time comes out of your evenings or weekends instead of coming out of your morning.",5,1742873445.0,Frugal,11,0.67,False

I would have to hold the pose and wait and it would slide back. It didn’t hurt. I had an umbilical hernia repair last June and told the surgeon about the weird sensation and he said it sounded like a Hiatal hernia but they don’t treat it unless you have severe acid reflux. 

I am a little overweight but not a lot, like 165 lbs for a 5’8” woman. The hernias are from my three pregnancies. Well I overate over the holidays and the day after Christmas got some acid reflux…. And it never went away. I started a strict GERD diet with the new year which helps but doesn’t stop it. I saw a doctor right away and he prescribed a prescription strength PPI. I took it for two weeks and felt better but when I went off it got worse. I tried Pepcid AC, not strong enough. I went on omeprazole. It relieved me initially but after a couple weeks it wasn’t enough. Now I am doing omeprazole and Pepcid and still find myself chewing tums and I have given up alcohol, coffee, spicy, greasy, acidic, and all kinds of foods. I don’t want to live my life like this. 

I waited three months to see a GI specialist and now waiting for them to schedule an endoscopy which will hopefully happen in April.

I emailed my doctor because omeprazole is not working effectively anymore and I just feel worse. I have reflux all the time except maybe when I first wake up in the morning. It is worse at night even though I cut off eating by 6 pm. 

Just frustrated that everything moves so slowly. Three months to see a specialist and waiting a week to schedule the endoscopy and playing phone tag with the doctor’s office. I emailed the doctor on Friday about my worsening symptoms and having to double up on PPIs and that’s probably not good but haven’t heard back.

Just looking for any advice. I think ultimately I will need a surgery but the way things are moving it could be a long journey to that intervention. 

I can’t believe some of you have lived with this for years or even decades. I didn’t realize how many people dealt with this . I never had acid reflux in my life and now it is my constant state. 

Maybe 3 months doesn’t seem like a long time to some of you, but it is really depressing me. I used to do a lot of yoga, which was so important to my mental and physical health and now I can’t do yoga without making it worse. I can’t do any inversion or bending and twisting, etc. I have been gaining weight in spite of my diet because of the lack of exercise. I know I need to find something new and I can’t make an excuse but yoga was my routine and what I loved. 

I also find I eat a lot of carbs: bread, popcorn, crap like that seems to absorb some of the acid and I can stomach it well, but it isn’t the healthiest diet. I know I should eat more veggies, but I just have a lot going on working full time and raising three kids. It’s been a challenge… 

Anyways, just looking for encouragement and support. What is the best OTC PPI? I know they are bad for you and I don’t want to be on them long term but I need them to function until I find a better option. 

I am also a teacher and I find I can’t project my voice without it getting worse so I am asking for a microphone.

Thanks for the advice.

1jja3r0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee_Shop/comments/1jja3r0/were_building_a_coffee_shop_in_nyc_with/,We’re building a coffee shop in NYC with secondhand gear and pure chaos — here’s the story so far,"First time posting here — not sure if this will catch anyone’s attention, but I just wanted to share a bit of my story. Mainly, why I decided to open a coffee shop in NYC, and everything I’ve been thinking along the way.

Back in summer 2024, I met my wife. After one dinner together, we both somehow knew — this was it. We were going to build a life together.

Opening a coffee shop has always been a dream of mine. But I never felt like the timing was right — until I got married, settled in New York, and realized that she really believes in me. That kind of support changes everything.

We started looking for spaces in Brooklyn, but it was impossible to find something small, affordable, and not falling apart. Eventually we found a spot on 34 Allen Street, in the Lower East Side — funnily enough, the same neighborhood where we had our first date and decided to be together. That kind of full-circle moment felt right.

The space was raw — a white box. We had to build everything from scratch. The landlord was super kind and connected me to his architect, who gave me a great deal.

We started planning out the layout, submitted permits, and my wife helped bring the whole design vision to life. Between us, she’s the creative one. I just wanted to work hard and take care of her. It’s a good balance. I’ll never forget — early on she asked me to make a plan, and I kept pushing it off, not knowing where to start. But she stepped in and made everything make sense.

I’m honestly so grateful for her.

But… we didn’t do our homework.

When the architect sent over all the bills and permit fees, we were shocked. We didn’t have the money. We tried everything — banks, credit unions, small business loans — all no.

So we just worked harder. Took on more production gigs, saved every dollar. Eventually, we pulled together enough to move forward.

That’s when the real hustle began.

I opened a spreadsheet, listed out every piece of equipment we’d need, and realized even secondhand stuff would still cost a fortune.

So I went full scavenger mode — hunting down used gear from all over the Northeast. And weirdly… that’s where the most meaningful part of this journey started.

I found an espresso machine in Rhode Island. I messaged the seller and asked if I could come check it out in person. He replied within minutes.

When I got there, I met a grandpa who used to run a coffee shop in that town. He welcomed me, showed me the machine, and asked about my story. We talked for hours.

He told me why he decided to retire, how he built his shop, what mattered most to him. He made me coffee. He was worried I’d fall asleep driving back to NYC. I didn’t buy the machine in the end — it was out of budget — but I left with something way more valuable: he taught me how to make a proper latte, and shared his whole heart with me.

We’ve stayed in touch. He still checks in. He became my first mentor.

Another time, I found a used EK43 grinder on Facebook Marketplace, from a guy out in Long Island. When I messaged him, I got that same feeling — like we already knew each other somehow.

He invited me to his café, showed me around, and gave me more advice than I could’ve imagined: where to order milk locally, where to buy cups, how to find a good bakery to partner with. He even introduced me to his distributor.

And now, I’ve spent months bouncing around the Lower East Side — getting lumber from the hardware store, grabbing screws from the shop around the corner, dropping off packages at USPS, grabbing late-night dinners from the same takeout spot.

And slowly, without even trying, I’ve become part of this little ecosystem. Now when we pass each other on the street, we say hi, ask how the build-out’s going. It feels like real community.

It’s weird to say this, but I’ve never experienced that before — not like this.

The funny part is: all these secondhand machines, these hand-me-down tools and furniture — they’ve connected me to people I never would’ve met. Each one has a story.

And now I feel like… this coffee shop isn’t just mine anymore. It belongs to all the people who helped me piece it together.

A few years ago, my life looked totally different. Now, every day I wake up and think, “I’m really doing this.” I don’t have the best equipment. I don’t have a polished floor or the prettiest design. But everything in this space is built out of love, stories, and hustle.

And I wouldn’t trade that for anything.

If you read all the way here, thank you. We’re hoping to open in a week or two — and yeah, we’ll probably still be broke. But we’re doing something that matters to us.

And I think that’s worth it.

I posted here back in August or September of 2024 when I had my second Botox procedure, which was my first in the OR (as my original Botox appointment was an in office situation that did not work at all.)

 I had initial success with the procedure in August but as the Botox were off so too did my ability to burp. 

 While I did sustain a tiny tiny tiny bit of improvement, meaning I could burp once a week when before I never burped and getting the gurgles that would last all night happened once every other week or so instead of once every other day, I was back to more bloating and other discomfort we're all familiar with.

Well I got the shot again in the OR at the beginning of March (third time is a charm?).  Last time I was micro burping the same day and full burping within days and drinking fizzy drinks, and best of all- I had no slow swallow or any other swallowing side effects. 

 This time however, I have major slow swallow and regurgitation issues and almost choking issues. I'm finding it really really difficult to drink anything with carbonation because I literally can't swallow it !! it feels like The bubbly part gets stuck in my throat and I can't force it down, And it can absolutely kind of sort of cause me to choke. If I manage to stay calm and not freak out (which I usually do bc I knew this was a possibility)because I feel like I'm choking, I can usually work my way through it but it's very difficult to stay cool calm and collected when it feels like you're choking. 

I've managed to figure out the regurgitation and am managing reflux much better this time around than I did last time. I can burp pretty consistently and even with some control. There are still some uncontrolled burps happening and i still sometimes mess up and ""push"" out what feels like a burp but it's actually reflux or whatever but I'm getting better at that.   

The slow swallow also affects what I can eat. I'm finding that anything that you can chew into like a really good paste is easier to swallow, my favorite so far has been fettuccine Alfredo. But things that are more textured even when you chew the shit out of them or that retains some sort of graininess or fibrousness, like potatoes or kale, are really difficult to swallow. I was surprised that applesauce was too grainy and I couldn't swallow that but yet I had a piece of garlic chose the other day that was totally easy to swallow. Generally, if I cut it into small enough pieces and I take my time and I take a sip of water between every bite, it goes okay. But it's actually very tiring because of how slow I have to go and how much extra I have to chew my food, and I get more full quickly because I'm drinking so much water in between every single bite. I'm sort of on a forced calorie deficit diet at the moment! 

So, 
I have a question. If I'm managing to burp with my coffee and water and tea and food, do I really need to drink fizzy drinks too? They're so hard for me to swallow. 

Final thoughts: These last 2.5 weeks have been interesting. It's good in so many ways and so uncomfortable in other ways. I'm thankful I had such an easy time of it the first 2 times (though maybe that's also why they both failed?). But, If this relief lasts and the slow swallow eventually stops, then it will definitely be worth it but it's a lot in terms of sensory experience so if you're neurodivergent/sensitive to sensory input, this is a lot. Be prepared for it to be a lot.",1,1742872755.0,noburp,0,1.0,False

the chicken is actually cooked !! the texture is  ok, but everything else deteriorates after that. it is decently moist and tender, but there's too much burned coffee grounds on it for it to be edible and in hindsight maybe I shouldve tried food with a sacrificial outer layer like how they actually use sand/salt frying
also battering the chicken is probably a mistake the coffee grounds immediately stuck to it. the improvised batter is dare I say decent actually. it's kombucha based, plus flour pepper paprika salt and blackening spices. I did a pan fried one to try out the batter and it's actually even  almost    good ??
I know it looks like shit too but that's mostly bc pan frying messed up the batter a bit bc I don't want to use too much oil for deep frying. the batter turned out similar in texture to KFC batter",71,1742872674.0,somnigastronomy,9,1.0,False
1jja13e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1jja13e/really_sad_and_no_spoons_left/,Really sad and no spoons left,"I had a massive migraine last night, took soooooo much medicine I was loopy and couldn’t talk right when I woke up, got moderately functional during the day. Yeah, every parent wants to hear this about their child’s teacher, so I obviously had to hide it. Copier wasn’t available so ha no copies for the first day back after spring break. Came up with BS plans that had the kids still working but on computers basically worksheet on the screen and show your work on paper and hey play these fun math games when you finish. So I took it as a win because I didn’t have to teach anything. Oh yeah vyvanse so no appetite. Ran on iced coffee and a handful of cheez its all day. Then left early for my migraine neurologist appointment to get Botox. Waited for a while for her since she was behind. Made the best of it. Then left, got gas, went home, let the dog in, time for comfy pants, then husband got home, back and forth with me saying eat now (it was nearly 6 and I hadn’t eaten essentially all day) and him saying have a snack then go for a walk. Well, I couldn’t do that or I wouldn’t eat dinner and that would use up spoons I was severely low on. Oh forgot when he was getting home I was making cold snack lunches for the rest of the week and that was some spoons. Arguing about eating first was spoons. Winning the argument and feeling guilty was spoons. Dishing up my food, first cutting the chicken off the bone, then microwaving twice was spoons. Toasted roll was spoons. Eating was soooooo many spoons and took forever with him telling me to eat and eat faster like shut up shut up shut up and let me do this at my own pace.

Never did work on lessons for school tomorrow like I said I would.

Did look through my last psychiatrist appointment with a new doctor willing to work with my neurologist since the last one basically limited severely what I could take for my migraines and it was bad so I’m switching but need to find a way to get vyvanse until my autism and ADHD evaluation is done (I’m so positive I have both) and I really need the vyvanse for how much it calms me down and keeps me better organized. So I was super stressed contacting the new doctor like hey here’s some options and let me know what you think for who prescribes what and when to switch to her service basically.

So it just clicked. I’m so sad because I ran out of spoons and stopped when I ran out and didn’t force myself to go over. So I ran out, I’m empty, and I’m also not pulling from tomorrow, but at the same time I feel like a disappointment for not doing the school work I always do for the team.

In all fairness, my share for months was 100% so I shouldn’t logically feel bad for still only having done 15%-20% of stuff for the week (lowballing but not too far off) when there are three other people who could work on it too.

Lately i’ve been so tired, lazy, and lethargic and i dont know why really. I just feel like i can be doing much better things that stimulate me. I used to be super into books, philosophy, and art now I just doomscroll. It leaves me in such a fogged and incoherent mental state. I am currently a college student (second year) and I work at a law firm. I love my 9-5 job as I just sit there and I really can just keep to myself. 

I love my boyfriend and I’m happy whenever were together, but away from him I start to hate everything and the world around me. I just feel as if sometimes I could be doing something more in my life and I’m not reaching my fullest potential. Its not necessarily physical boundaries but rather motivation. I also hate where I live. I’ve been to Japan and it seems like thats where my life is supposed to take place sometimes.

Where I live everything is unwalkable, expensive, and boring. When im driving around town I look at the city around me and, dont get me wrong im greatful, but i get a deep sensible pit of despair and melancholy. I go to fun events, but in the moment sometimes i get that wave of despair. When im genuinely happy is when i explore the world while smoking a cigarette and with my boyfriend. I know theres so much opportunities for life to offer but i don’t know where I belong. 

I hate everyone (not like that obv), but everyone i talk to feels kinda mindless and dumb. I don’t like what im surrounded around nor the people. I want to open a coffee shop bc i know deep down that will fufill this constant itch i have but Again i dont know where to start or continue with my motivation. I’ve done so much but feel nonetheless unfulfilled. What do i do? Even so, i feel like searching for an answer to a justification of living is pointless.

There is a lot of heavy, dark stuff in here. It’s a dark romance. So this is not everyone cups of tea. 

I was reading another thread yesterday and people were saying if you do not like bully tropes you will not like this book.

I think I just like good, kinky, EROTICA smut. 🤣🤣😭😭😭😭🫣🫣because I didn’t really like zodiac academy because I didn’t like the bullying.

BUT I AM DEVOURINGGGGG THIS SERIES. ITS SO GOOD. I AM A FREAK AND I DO NOT CARE 🤣I want to mention if you LIKEEE smut (like, when researching books you only want 4 or 5 🌶️ on the rating before you consider it) and you’re okay with TW you HAVE GOTTA GO READ THIS BOOK!!!

This is what I have been searching for for WEEKS. I wanted something heavy on the smut but also still magical. The magic in it is very unique too, never seen this in another book. 

If you thought ACOTAR was too much smut, you are not gonna like this.


Now, if you, like me, eventually discovered the entire Of Blood And Ash World and all her different books and you thought “now hey…this is my cup of a tea” this book is the NEXT step in that direction.

I know there will be who come on here and did not like it. We alll have different tastes! 

I just wish I would’ve discovered it sooner. I’m making this post to bring attention to it.

It’s rare where I’m so enthralled in a book I literally cannot put it down. This is the kind of book where I just pulled an all nighter and finished the book one by like..8am? Cliff hanger bad but the 2nd book is out and so I was able to jump right into it. Slept a little. Woke up, rolled over and literally could not even get up to make coffee before I grabbed my kindle to reopen it. Still on book 2 so no spoilers please!

1jj9xgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1jj9xgt/the_mug_rebellion/,The Mug Rebellion,"I'm not a button pusher, as you know. You may have been told I'm avoidant, but I'm not that, either. I just know when something is a lost cause. But, no. I know any given pair of humans is going to have differences. There are conflicts, always. I don't avoid them, but I don't lean into them, either. And, I dunno, maybe you aren't used to that — I know I'm not. But I honestly suspect you're the same. Lay the cards on the table. Do your best to understand. Try to find a solution. No puzzles and never, *ever* pushing anyone into a corner where they feel trapped. I dunno. That's the goal, anyways, but… we are both human, aren't we? I guess we'll see how it goes… The good news, though, is I *know* both of us would rather grow than stagnate. That we both ask ourselves to be better at least as much as we ask it of others. That we recognize our own faults, and we both at least take stabs at being *better*.

Anyhow. Speaking of things you may have been told, I'm pretty sure you've heard the Sims analogy. That I'm like a Sim, and if you take me out of my home, my ""Environment"" meter drops precipitously, and so I don't like to be out for too long. You may have even heard me agree with that. Well… I think you should know that, at some point along the way, I realized that was a false narrative. It's not being out and about that exhausts me. I don't expect I need to spell the rest out for you, but… in case you were ever worried that I wouldn't like to join you people watching in downtown while we have a meal together… Don't. That sounds absolutely lovely to me. Anytime. Every time, if you'd like (and our wallets somehow manage to afford…). I'm taking my narrative back. It's a little thing, but sometimes the little things add up.

And, besides, I haven't *ever* been exhausted when I've been around you.

Speaking of little things, there's this mug. It was given to me as a gift, maybe a graduation present from high school, I don't remember for sure. Point is, I've had it for a long, long time. And I like it. It's cute. Bloom County, so, you know… a joke that would land terribly if it weren't being told by a neurotic puffin.

Twenty years ago, that mug was taken from me. Oh, it's still in my home. It was just made absolutely and abundantly clear that *I* was *not* to use it. Not for myself, not ever. And not told with sweet little glances through pretty eyelashes, either.

And I abided by that rule for long enough that the person who set it likely no longer even remembers. But I do. Amazing how such a little thing like a mug can leave a scar…

Well. That's changed. Does it matter? No, probably not, not in the grand scheme of things. But here I am, right now, writing this to you while sipping my coffee out of it.

Doesn't matter to her anymore, doesn't matter to the universe, perhaps. But it matters to *me*.

So, you know me. I can't leave anything unspoken or understated, so. Of course. In my head I think of it as The Mug Rebellion. Because what better way to celebrate the teeniest tiniest victory than by giving it an overinflated name?

Well. Hope you think it's cute, if nothing else.

Babe. We are *getting there*. It's taken a while. Fuck, it's taken *forever*. You have *no idea* the ache in my hands just wanting to touch you. The ache in my heart wanting to wrap you up in my embrace. But we're *doing it*. It's *happening*. In slow motion, but it's **happening**.

God. I love you. You have no idea.

I was interviewed by virtual meeting, I have spoken with the hiring manager, at length,  I did a test, to asses my knowledge. I satisfied the manager, she was very friendly, and excited to have me on board. As a single mom with both kids in university this seemed like a great chance, my accommodation would be included with my pay package. Since I also live in an apartment, I would require to give my place 60 day notice. I was very upfront and told the manager, she said no problem, in the meantime she would be working on preparing my unit, and SHE  said you should give them your 60 day notice. Told me,  until I didn't move in I would be receiving full pay, which was fine by me. I gave my notice, and I really wanted to have the job contact in hand, and said so. I received all the paperwork, and I signed everything and submitted it to HR.  I also had to do a criminal record check, which I knew I had a misdemeanor on my record. I had shoplifted, I think coffee. That time in my life I was young and I was being forced into an arrange marriage over seas, and I was desperate to stop it, some friends suggested being arrested, then I wouldn't be able to leave the country, needless to say it just delayed the inevitable. I had forgotten all about this, since it had happened 30 yrs ago, but became aware when for some other reason I needed my finger prints done, and it showed up. So knowing this I let HR know, I told her what had happened, and if that would be an issue? She thanked me and said it shouldn't be an issue. I went ahead and did a criminal record check, when you have something on your record you have to do fingerprints and it goes to the RCMP, so there is a delay. I wasn't too worried since I had told HR, what she would find. I have had no other charges in my life, except that one incident. One week later I received from HR, that the job offer was recinded, I was devastated, I had told my family about the job, I had put in my 2 months notice, and told the resident manager at my building.
The matter of the fact was that HR had not even received the results of my criminal record yet, since I had just gotten the prints done and it would take 4 - 5 week wait. I confronted HR and said but I told you, why would you make me pay for the record check and then recind the job offer..she said it's our company policy, we can't hire anyone with a criminal record. I have become un confident, I'm so ashamed, I am unable to say WHY, I'm not working, I had to take back my 60 day notice of where I live. It's been on my mind always, I wanted to know if this a violation of the human rights code? I was let go because of my criminal record which was 30 yrs ago, it doesn't effect my job duties in any way, since I have been employed in the past , working with cash,n doing bank deposits. Please set my mind at ease, when they say on employment applications , have you been convicted of any crime, for which a pardon has not been granted what does that exactly mean?

1jj9u9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigfoot/comments/1jj9u9o/possible_alaskan_bigfoot_sighting/,Possible Alaskan Bigfoot Sighting,"Ok howdy fellow squatchers (squatch-watchers?) I got a story to tell. I am Métis and Gwich'in, originally from Montana but lived up near Nenana, Alaska, for a substantial portion of my life. I would like to make it clear that I am a believer. I was raised with the old stories, and I do believe them. I burn sage before I hunt. I give thanks to the ancestors. I see the northern lights as a sign that Creator is happy and the day will be good. This is not to say that I am a cryptozoologist. I do not believe in Aliens, or at least don't believe that they have come to walk among us. I would also like to say that I am an experienced outdoorsman and hunter. I did not mistake what I saw for another animal or even another person. I am not afraid of the wild. I have done multiple weeklong solo hunting trips into the Alaskan wilderness. This is all to say that I belive myself to be capable enough to understand what I witnessed and capable enough to know what it is. 

I was up in Alaska to visit my cousins. It was early February and the snow came hard on the trip up. I ended up driving from Montana to Nenana rather than flying, mostly because it was cheaper, and I'm morbidly afraid of planes. I remember it being one of the worst drives of my life. Blowing snow, shit visibility, white knuckling the wheel all the way from Kulane lake in the Yukon territory. But once I got there it was wonderful. It was great to be home, my family threw a small party for me over unrelated college business. But all of that ain't matter. What does matter is what occurred when I went out to solo hunt for snowshoe hare. 

Whenever I used to live in Nenana I loved solo hunting, and when I travel up there I love to go back to my old haunts and pretend that I don't live in the real world anymore. So I strapped on my snowshoes early in the morning, had a cup of coffee and a few granola bars, pulled on my heavy Mackinaw jacket and a coyote skin trapper hat, and grabbed my light .22 lever action rifle. I made my way out the door, the only sound in the 4 room cabin being the light pops of the woodstove. On my way out I distinctly remember debating bringing my heavy hunting pack, I remember thinking ""aw hell I ain't gonna be gone for long plus it'll be a pain in the ass to carry"" so I ended up grabbing my lighter possibles bag and starting up the hill behind our homestead, past the tarp wrapped snow machine that has sat there since before I can remember. 

I made it up to my old hunting spot without too much trouble, deep snow but easily compacted under my USGI mag snowshoes. I remember the sound of birds and squirrels chattering. I remember that made me happy because it meant there were no wolves in the general vicinity. I dropped both my pack and my heavy coat when I reached a small clearing that I had used as a basecamp before at around 9:45 am. I gathered some firewood and left it in a small pile next to my pack. I went out with just my snowshoes and rifle. I didn't have to walk far, finding a group of three snowshoe hare within a stand of birch. I harvested one with a good headshot, then took a second one as the remaining two fled towards me in their confusion. 

I carried both rabbits back to my camp of sorts, I remember worrying that I got rabbit blood on my new workpants that I had purchased in at a Murdochs back in Montana a week or two earlier. As I made my way back to my camp I noticed that the birds were gone. All except ravens. I remember being a bit worried but not much, only because groups of ravens sometimes follow wolfpacks. I got to a slight ridge above the clearing and as I began to make my way down through the alders I saw movement down by my pack. I kneeled on one snowshoe, shielding my eyes from the sun to get a better look. What I saw still confuses me. I saw a small man, long hair that looked like dreadlocks. From the angle I was looking at and the way the sun hit the snow I couldn't even tell if he was wearing clothes, the figure just was like a black shillohete against the snow. I watched him for a few minutes before I clearly saw him reach into my possibles bag and pull something out. This pissed me off. I figured it was just a weird junky or something, some Chris Mackandaless wannabe. So I shouted. It turned to face me. I saw a slight glint of eyes from beneath a curtain of hair, I was now aware that the thing was covered in patchy hair, not a full coat, but like an animal with mange. It had clumps of long stringy hair, which appeared to glint with grease in the sun. Without thinking I fired a warning shot. The bullet whizzed over it's head. I like to think that the ethical hunter in me did that intentionally, not to injure an unknown creature, but honestly, I woulda shot the damn thing just for rooting through my stuff. The shot scared it. I know because it turned towards a nearby draw and sprinted off. It didn't run like an animal, it ran more like an Olympic sprinter. Hands out, held flat. It knew how to run. I sprinted down the hill, almost faceplanting multiple times. I made it to my pack, and immediately scanned the area. No signs of anything, no tracks, just a bullet hole in a snowbank and this eerie silence. I searched my pack only to find that it has taken my knife. I ran home that day, cooked the rabbits, and thanked god that whatever it was it must've just been my mind. Thats why I never told anyone.

But my knife is gone, and to this day I've never been able to find it. 

So that's my story. I'd love to hear ya'lls ideas on what this thing was, or if I was just hallucinating or what.",21,1742871978.0,bigfoot,2,0.92,False

1jj9ouz,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1jj9ouz/the_heartfelt_lock/,The Heartfelt Lock,"I always loved how thoughtful Lucas was.

From the start, he noticed the little things, how I liked black tea with honey, how I preferred the center seat in movie theaters. A month into dating, he gave me a gold bracelet. When I moved in, he added a matching anklet, saying it made him happy knowing I wore a piece of his “heart.”

Tidying the bedroom, I smiled. Life with Lucas felt easy, calm, controlled. My past relationships were chaotic, full of heartache. But this? This was peace.

I opened a drawer to put away socks. As it closed, I heard a faint clink. Curious, I reached toward the back and pulled out a chipped coffee mug with a faded photo of me on it and two vaguely familiar faces. I froze.

From the living room, Lucas’s phone buzzed. He was in the backyard.

Still holding the mug, I picked up his phone to take it to him, but a Reddit notification caught my eye: **""Bathroom – San Antonio.""**

Lucas was usually protective of his phone, but something told me to open it.

The post showed a bathroom counter. Toothbrush. Lotion. Everything arranged with obsessive precision.

Then I saw his last post—it was the mug I was holding.

I opened his camera roll. Mundane images. Some familiar. Some not. Then photos of me, from a distance, clearly unaware, but all taken at my old apartment and dated before I ever met Lucas.

Hands shaking, I returned to Reddit.

A new post hovered at the top: **""Red Dress – Detroit.""**

I walked to the closet, it looked similar to a dress Lucas gave me last week. I pulled it down. Identical. What was going on?

My bracelet felt suddenly tight on my wrist. My anklet didn’t feel delicate anymore. It was cold. Heavy. I looked down and saw a small seam on the side I hadn’t noticed before.

I ran to the bathroom mirror. I barely recognized myself, sunken cheeks, hollow eyes. The necklace he gave me had a clasp too. A chain. A lock.

Behind me, Lucas appeared in the doorway, expression unreadable.

“What do you see, Emma?” he asked softly.

“What is this?” I clawed at the bracelet. No, handcuff.

He sighed. “Let me make you some tea. That always helps calm you down.”

“It’s in the tea…” I thought, staring at the red dress still clutched in my hands.

“Why me?”

“Because you look like her,” he smiled. “Well, almost. You’re my best version yet.”

Behind him, I noticed a door I hadn’t seen before. Steel. Keypad. I’d realized I’d never left this house since moving in. Not once.

Lucas stepped forward. “Let’s get your tea. Time to finish the final stage.”

Stepping back, dress in one hand, a cup of tea suddenly in the other, a warm, strange calm crept over me.

I held up the dress. “Do you think it will fit?”

Lucas smiled. “Let me get the camera.”

I smiled back.

I cook, I clean, I do all the laundry, I make her lunch every morning and coffee. I also run all errands for everything. I don’t go out with friends and get drunk, cheat, and/or do drugs. We got in fight because the kids asked her when is she going to work from home which her job offers it, but she is use to working in a place that was minimal PTO and no WFH, she thinks that if not in the office work is not getting done. So she tells the kids yeah maybe if your dad would be a man and work 2 jobs so I can stay home. So I stopped her and said where the bell does she get off saying that. She said, you might not be a drunk, drug addict, or a cheat but you are a bad husband. I just don’t get it like my dad was all those things and I promised myself I wouldn’t and have kept that promise but some how I’m still a bad husband. All My friends’ wives work too and they cleans and cook and everything. I’m the only one that actually helps my spouse yet not good enough. I’m at a loss.

Like your gut is trying to warn you, but your brain refuses to listen?

That was me on my first night at Sunny Oaks Diner.

The place sat on the side of a lonely highway, the kind of road where headlights felt rare and the silence stretched too long between passing cars. The diner’s neon sign flickered in and out, buzzing like it was struggling to stay alive. 

The parking lot was cracked, weeds pushing through the pavement, and the windows were fogged up from the inside, giving the whole place an eerie, lived-in feeling—like the building itself was breathing. A jukebox sat in the far corner, warbling out old songs, but no one had touched it. It was just playing on its own.

I hadn’t even stepped inside yet, and already, I felt like I didn’t belong.

The manager, Reggie, didn’t bother to meet me in person. No handshake, no ""Welcome to the team,"" not even a quick phone call. Instead, my phone buzzed, and I saw a message waiting for me.

**REGGIE:** ""Check the dashboard before you clock in. Password is the same for all new hires.""

That was it. Nothing else.

No instructions. No small talk. No “let me show you around.” Just a text that felt more like a command than a welcome. Something about it rubbed me the wrong way, but I sighed, shoved my phone in my pocket, and pushed open the diner’s front door.

The inside wasn’t any better. The air smelled like old coffee and burnt toast, the kind of scent that had been baked into the walls over years of neglect. The counter was lined with red leather stools, cracked at the seams, and the booths had that sticky, worn-down feel like they’d seen decades of customers come and go.

Behind the counter sat the old computer. It was one of those ancient models with a bulky monitor, the plastic casing yellowed from time. When I jiggled the mouse, the thing groaned like I had just woken it up from a deep sleep. The screen flickered to life, showing a basic login page—plain blue background, ugly blocky font.

Four tabs.

* **Schedules**  
* **Payroll**  
* **Training Videos**  
* **NIGHT SHIFT PROTOCOL – READ BEFORE CLOCKING IN**  

That last one made my stomach twist.

I hesitated, then, out of curiosity, clicked **""Forgot Password.""**

A single security question popped up: **""What’s the secret ingredient in our famous pie?""**

I blinked. I had no idea. I hadn’t even seen the menu yet. But this was Florida, and if there was one thing Florida loved, it was key lime pie.

So I typed: **Key lime.**

The screen refreshed.

**Access granted.**

That was weird. Too easy.

Inside, the dashboard was a mess—broken links, old employee announcements from years ago, and a handful of outdated memos. Nothing useful. But my eyes locked onto the Night Shift Protocol PDF.

I clicked it open.

At first, it seemed normal. The usual corporate nonsense about keeping the place clean, being polite to customers, and making sure the cash register was balanced. But then, as I scrolled down, something changed.

The rules at the bottom weren’t normal.

They weren’t even close.

They were written in **bold.**

1. **Always keep the coffee pot full.** Even if no one’s drinking. If it runs dry, refill it immediately.  
2. **If a man in a blue suit walks in, take his order, but never look him in the eyes.** He will sit at the booth in the back.  
3. **You may see someone who looks exactly like you sitting at the counter. Ignore them.** Do not acknowledge their presence.  
4. **At exactly 4:14 AM, go to the walk-in freezer and knock three times.** If you hear knocking back, leave the diner immediately and do not return until 5:00 AM.  
5. **If a woman in a red dress asks for ""yesterday’s special,"" tell her, ""We’re all out.""** No matter what she says, do not serve her.  
6. **Under no circumstances should you touch Table 6’s silverware.**  

My fingers tightened on the mouse.

At the very bottom, barely readable, was one last line in faded gray text: *""Failure to follow protocol will result in immediate termination.""*

Somehow, I didn’t think they meant getting fired.

The first couple of hours were slow. The kind of slow where every minute stretched too long, where silence wasn’t just silence—it was something heavy, pressing down on me.

I did what I could to stay busy. Wiping down the counter. Refilling salt shakers. Rearranging the napkin dispensers like that somehow mattered. Anything to keep my mind from wandering too far into the rules I’d read. But no matter what I did, the feeling sat in my gut like a warning—something was off in this place.

The diner smelled like old grease and burnt coffee, the usual scents of a place like this, but underneath it, there was something else. Something sour. Like milk gone bad, or something left to rot where no one could see it. The scent clung to the back of my throat, and the more I noticed it, the harder it was to ignore.

Then, at **1:34 AM**, the doorbell jingled.

I froze.

A man in a blue suit stepped inside.

My breath caught in my chest. **Rule #2.**

**If a man in a blue suit walks in, take his order, but never look him in the eyes.** He will sit at the booth in the back.

His movements were slow—too slow. Like every step was deliberate, measured. He didn’t glance around, didn’t acknowledge me, didn’t even seem to notice the empty diner. He just moved, silent and sure, toward the booth in the back.

I kept my head down. My notepad felt slippery in my hand, and I gripped it tighter. My feet carried me forward on autopilot, my pulse loud in my ears.

Don’t look at him. Just take his order.

I stopped at his table, eyes glued to the blank page of my notepad. My voice came out steadier than I felt.

**""What can I get you?""**

For a second, there was nothing. No response. Just the hum of the jukebox playing some forgotten song.

Then, he spoke.

**""Coffee.""**

It wasn’t the word that unsettled me. It was the way he said it. His voice was wrong—too smooth, like a recording played a little too slow, like something trying too hard to sound normal but not quite getting there.

My hands shook as I grabbed the pot. I poured the coffee carefully, keeping my head down, forcing my breathing to stay even. But when I slid the cup across the table, my hand accidentally brushed his.

A deep, icy chill shot up my arm.

It wasn’t like touching cold skin. It was worse. Like touching something that had never been alive in the first place.

A low chuckle.

**""Good boy,""** he murmured.

My stomach turned. I swallowed hard, resisting the urge to run.

He chuckled again, this time softer. **""See you tomorrow, kid.""**

I didn’t know why, but that laugh made my skin crawl. It was the kind of sound that stuck to your ribs, something your body recognized as wrong even if your brain couldn’t explain why.

I turned away fast, desperate to put space between us. But as I moved, my eyes caught the reflection in the napkin dispenser.

His mouth stretched too wide.

Not in a smile. Not in anything human.

Like his skin didn’t fit right. His teeth—too white, too sharp—flashed in the dim light.

I squeezed my eyes shut and forced myself to keep walking. My hands still trembled as I reached the counter. I busied myself wiping an already-clean spot, anything to keep from looking back.

I didn’t hear him leave. But when I finally dared to glance at the booth—

He was gone.

Just the faint wisp of steam curling from the untouched cup of coffee.

It was **2:07 AM.**

The clock on the wall ticked forward, and I realized something.

If that was only my first customer, how the hell was I supposed to make it through the rest of my shift?

My chest felt tight, my mind racing to find some kind of normal in this nightmare. 

But then—I heard **Footsteps.**

Someone sat at the counter.

I turned, and my stomach plummeted.

It was me.

Same uniform. Same posture. Same exhausted expression.

But one difference—he was **grinning.**

My fingers dug into the counter. My heart pounded against my ribs. 

**Rule #3—You may see someone who looks exactly like you sitting at the counter. Ignore them.** Do not acknowledge their presence.

I forced my head down, eyes on the coffee pot, hands moving like I was focused on anything else. Like I hadn’t seen what was sitting just feet away.

But I **felt** him.

His eyes on me.

That grin stretching wider, like he knew something I didn’t.

The diner’s silence became unbearable, every second dragging longer. Then, out of nowhere—

It spoke in **my voice.**

**""You should sit down, man. You look tired.""**

It was my voice. But it wasn’t **me.**

I clenched my jaw and scrubbed harder at the counter, pretending. Ignoring. Following the rules.

A pause. Then—

**Drumming.**

The other me tapped his fingers against the countertop in a slow, steady rhythm.

**""You think the rules tell you everything?""** he asked.

I gritted my teeth. Said nothing.

The drumming continued.

**""You’re missing one.""** It said again.

A cold weight settled in my chest.

I stared at the coffee pot, my reflection warped in the glass. My own expression looked wrong—like something beneath the surface had cracked just a little.

I couldn’t let this get to me. I wouldn’t.

I took a breath, gripped the edge of the counter, and I turned away. 

But, When I looked back—

**He was gone.**

Nothing left.

Nothing except a half-empty cup of coffee sitting in front of the abandoned stool.

I never poured that.

**Missing one?**

What the hell did that mean?

The other me—whatever it was—hadn’t said anything else, just left me with that cryptic warning. But the way he said it… it didn’t feel like a joke. It felt like a clue. Or maybe a threat.

I stood behind the counter, gripping it so hard my knuckles ached. My mind spun, trying to make sense of what had just happened. The fork in the pancake, the empty coffee cup, the laugh that still rang in my ears.

This place wasn’t just haunted. It was playing by some kind of rules, and I had no idea who—or **what**—was making them.

Then, **she** walked in.

At first glance, she looked normal enough. Dark hair, sharp eyes, a red dress that fit like she belonged somewhere better than a greasy highway diner. But the second she stepped through the door, the air shifted.

It was subtle—like the temperature dropped just a little, like the diner **recognized** her.

She moved smoothly, no hesitation, sliding into a booth like she’d been here a thousand times before. Then, she smiled.

**""I'll have yesterday's special.""** She said,

My throat went dry.

**Rule #5.**

The words burned in my brain. **If a woman in a red dress asks for ""yesterday’s special,"" tell her, ""We’re all out."" No matter what she says, do not serve her.**

I swallowed hard.

**""We're all out.""** I said**.**

It barely came out above a whisper, but I got the words out.

Her smile didn’t move. It stayed fixed in place, like it had been painted on. Her fingers tapped lazily against the table, the rhythm slow and deliberate.

**""Are you sure?""** She asked again.

Her voice was warm, coaxing. Like she was giving me a chance to change my mind. Like she was used to people **changing their minds.**

I forced myself to breathe.

**""Yeah,""** I said, a little stronger this time. **""We don’t serve that anymore.""**

The air in the diner felt heavy, like the walls were pressing in.

For a split second, something in her expression **shifted.** Not anger, not frustration—something deeper. Something **calculating.**

Like she was trying to decide what I was worth.

Her eyes darkened just a little, and for a terrifying moment, I thought she’d lunge across the table. But then, just as quickly, she leaned back, exhaling through her nose like she’d just lost a bet.

Her nails tapped against the tabletop again.

**""You’re smarter than the last one.""** she said.

Then she stood.

No argument. No second attempt.

She just walked out.

The door swung shut behind her, and just like that, the diner **felt normal again.** Or at least, as normal as it ever got.

I let out a shaky breath, running a hand through my hair.

**""Oh my damn God,""** I muttered under my breath.

What the hell was that?

**Did they think like us?**

That was the part that scared me the most. The guy in the suit, the other me, the woman in the red dress—they weren’t just mindless things following some supernatural script. They were **watching.** Learning. Testing me.

And I had no idea what happened to the people who failed.

Suddenly, The doorbell jingled again, snapping me out of my spiraling thoughts.

A couple walked in, laughing softly as they took a seat at **Table 6.**

I stiffened.

**Rule #6.** **Under no circumstances should you touch Table 6’s silverware.**

But I couldn’t **stop** them from using it. They were customers. Just a regular couple—probably on a late-night road trip, stopping for a bite before heading back to whatever normal life they had.

I forced myself to move, to act natural. I took their order, brought them their food, and watched as they ate, completely unaware that anything was wrong.

When they finished, they left cash on the table and walked out, still chatting, still smiling.

It should’ve been fine. It should’ve been **over.**

But when I walked over to clear their plates, my stomach dropped.

One of the forks was **missing.**

I checked under the table, the seats, even inside the napkin dispenser. Nothing.

Then, as I turned back toward the counter—

I **saw it.**

A plate sat on the counter that hadn’t been there before.

A single pancake, perfectly round, like it had just been placed fresh from the griddle.

And stabbed right into the center—

Was the missing fork.

I froze.

My mouth went dry.

Slowly, **too slowly,** my gaze drifted up—

And I saw him.

The man in the blue suit.

Sitting across from the plate. Fingers tapping against the table, that slow, deliberate rhythm that I was starting to hate.

He wasn’t smiling.

**""You should really be more careful,""** he said.

My hands felt like ice. My heart pounded so hard I could feel it in my **teeth.**

**""Breaking the rules has consequences,""** he warned me again.

I didn’t move. I didn’t even **breathe.**

The jukebox stopped playing.

The hum of the old lights overhead buzzed louder.

And then—

**Everything went dark.**

For five long, suffocating seconds, the diner was pitch black.

No sounds. No movement. Just the kind of stillness that presses in on your ribs, makes you feel like something’s waiting just inches away, watching, reaching—

Then—

The lights flickered back on.

The man in the suit was **gone.**

The diner was **empty.**

Except for the plate.

The pancake was gone.

But the fork was still there—

**Driven into the table.**

Like someone had **stabbed it in hard.**

By now, nothing could surprise me.

Or so I thought.

The night had been a blur of rules and warnings, of people who weren’t people, of moments that made my skin crawl. But the worst part wasn’t what I had seen—it was knowing that something else was coming.

Something **always** came next.

At exactly **4:14 AM,** my stomach twisted.

I had almost forgotten **Rule #4.**

**At exactly 4:14 AM, go to the walk-in freezer and knock three times. If you hear knocking back, leave the diner immediately and do not return until 5:00 AM.**

I glanced at the clock, pulse quickening.

**4:14 AM.**

I swallowed hard and forced my legs to move, pushing past the swinging kitchen doors. The freezer stood at the back, its heavy steel door shut tight. My breath fogged in the cold air as I stepped closer, every instinct screaming at me to turn around.

Then, my phone buzzed.

The screen lit up with a **dashboard notification.**

**""Follow the protocol.""**

I exhaled sharply, hand tightening around my phone.

I lifted my fist.

I knocked three times.

Silence.

For a second, I thought maybe—just **maybe**—nothing would happen. Maybe the rules were just there to mess with me, some kind of cruel initiation.

Then—**Knock. Knock. Knock.**

Three Knocks, From the **inside.**

I stumbled back so fast I nearly lost my footing, my shoes slipping against the cold tile. My heartbeat thundered in my ears. My fingers twitched around my keys.

**The rule said to leave.**

I didn’t think. I just moved.

Bolting through the kitchen, I shoved open the back door and ran straight to my car. My hands were shaking so badly I fumbled the keys twice before finally jamming them into the ignition.

I didn’t drive.

I just **sat there,** gripping the wheel, waiting.

From the parking lot, I could see the diner, its windows glowing in the darkness. Everything looked **normal.**

But the freezer door—

It was open.

A figure shifted inside, barely visible through the gap.

Then, **he stepped out.**

My stomach twisted into a knot so tight I thought I’d be sick.

It was **me.**

Standing behind the counter.

Smiling.

His lips moved.

I couldn’t hear him, but I knew what he was saying.

**""You're still missing one.""**

Then, every single light in the diner **went out.**

I shouldn’t have gone back inside.

But I had to.

The moment the clock hit **5:00**, I took a deep breath and forced myself out of the car. My footsteps felt too loud as I crossed the parking lot, the neon sign above flickering weakly.

The diner was silent.

Too silent.

The door creaked as I stepped inside. The air smelled the same—burnt coffee and old grease—but something **felt** different.

Like the place was holding its breath.

I checked everything.

The man in the suit? Gone.

The other me? Gone.

The freezer door? Shut.

I should have felt relieved. I **wanted** to feel relieved. But my skin prickled with something I couldn’t shake.

Something **was wrong.**

I walked behind the counter, trying to shake off the unease. My fingers grazed the coffee pot—still warm. The counter, still wiped clean. Everything **looked** normal.

But, Then—

I heard… **Scratching.**

I froze.

The sound was faint, almost too quiet to notice.

**Scritch. Scritch. Scritch.**

It was coming from the kitchen.

I turned slowly, every muscle in my body tensed.

**This wasn’t on the rules list.**

My breath hitched as I crept forward, following the sound. The closer I got, the more distinct it became—like fingernails dragging against wood.

It was coming from the **supply closet.**

I stopped in front of the door, pulse hammering against my ribs.

The scratching paused.

Then, just as I reached for the handle—

**BANG.**

Something **slammed** against the inside of the door.

I staggered back, my heart in my throat.

And then— A voice came.

**""Let me out.""** 

It wasn’t loud.

It wasn’t frantic.

It was **calm.** Steady.

Like it knew I was standing there, frozen in fear.

I couldn’t move.

**""Let me out.""** It said Again.

No.

No, this wasn’t **right.**

I reached for the handle before my brain could stop me, fingers brushing against the cold metal—

**Wait.**

**This wasn’t in the rules.**

My blood turned to ice.

I yanked my hand back like I had been burned.

I had followed the rules all night. I had listened. Obeyed. But this?

**This wasn’t on the list.**

Which meant I had no idea what would happen if I broke it.

The scratching started again.

I swallowed my fear, took a step back, and—

**SLAMMED THE DOOR SHUT.**

With shaking hands, I twisted the lock.

Then I ran.

I grabbed my phone, fingers trembling as I pulled up the dashboard. My breath came in short, uneven gasps as I clicked into the rules.

I forced myself to type.

**Rule #7. If you hear scratching from the kitchen closet, DO NOT OPEN IT. Lock the door and leave immediately.**

The second I hit **save,** the screen **glitched.**

For half a second, the text warped—letters stretching, distorting, twisting into something unreadable.

Suddenly—I heard A breath, **Right behind me.**

A whisper brushed against my ear. 

**""Too late.""**

Ice crawled up my spine.

**A hand grabbed my wrist.**

Cold. Too cold.

I **screamed.**

I don’t remember how I got out.

One second, I was inside the diner, something cold wrapping around my wrist, whispering in my ear. The next—

I was outside.

Gasping for air.

The pavement was rough beneath me, my knees scraped raw like I had fallen. My hands **burned,** a sharp, stinging heat, like I had pressed them against a stove. I looked down, expecting blisters, expecting **something.**

But there was nothing.

The diner sat in front of me, dark and silent, like it had never been open in the first place.

The neon sign still flickered weakly, buzzing in the early morning quiet. But inside, the windows were pitch black, the kind of darkness that felt **full.**

Like something was watching from the other side.

I forced myself to my feet, legs shaking beneath me. My breathing was uneven, my body still locked in that fight-or-flight haze.

The door was shut.

The silverware?

**Back on the table.**

Neatly arranged, as if nothing had ever happened.

Like the diner had reset itself.

Like it was waiting for the next shift.

My phone buzzed.

I pulled it out with numb fingers, my pulse spiking as I saw the notification.

**DASHBOARD ERROR.**

I opened the app, stomach twisting.

The rules were **locked.**

I tried to tap them, to edit, to add more—

**Nothing.**

I couldn’t change them.

Couldn’t add anything else.

The rule about the **scratching closet** was the last one I’d ever be able to write.

And something about that sent a fresh wave of terror down my spine.

It meant the game wasn’t over.

It meant someone else would take my place.

I never went back.

I didn’t quit. Didn’t send a message. Didn’t **acknowledge** Sunny Oaks Diner in any way. I just… disappeared.

For a while, I convinced myself it was over.

Then, the next morning, my phone chimed.

A new email.

My chest tightened as I saw the sender.

**REGGIE.**

My finger hovered over the screen before I finally opened it.

**""You lasted longer than most. Hope you wrote everything down. The next guy will need it.""**

That was it.

No apology. No explanation. Just those cold, matter-of-fact words.

Like this was **normal.**

Like I was just another name on a long list of people who had tried and **failed.**

I stared at the email for a long time before finally **deleting it.**

I tried to delete the memories, too.

Tried to convince myself it was just a nightmare, a bad dream I couldn’t shake.

But sometimes—late at night, when the world is quiet and I’m alone with my thoughts—

I still **feel** it.

That cold grip around my wrist.

The whisper against my ear.

The weight of **something** standing just out of sight, watching.

I don’t know who—or what—is running that diner now.

And I don’t want to know.

But if you ever find yourself driving down a lonely stretch of highway and see a flickering neon sign for **Sunny Oaks Diner?**

Do yourself a favor.

1jj9cyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jj9cyr/girls_trip_ends_friendship_long_post_alert/,"Girls Trip Ends Friendship, 🚨long post alert🚨","   For Veterans Day weekend, I organized a girls trip to Washington DC for myself and three girlfriends. All of us attended law school together and three of them recently graduated while I was finishing my last year. I emphasized that the trip to DC would be for us to visit the government buildings and such as aspiring legal professionals. 

Background: The four of us have been doing girls trips since law school started and we each take turns planning a trip. This was my first trip to plan. I planned a low-cost weekend (visiting government buildings and Smithsonian museums is free) because I was still a student and the other three had just started their careers. When the other girls planned trips, they sent informational emails to all of us so we knew what we were doing that weekend. I sent a long text message with info about what I had scheduled AND what to wear/expect at these places. 

We are a group of four. After our first year of law school, two of the four girls began dating. Myself and the other girl were of course extremely supportive of this relationship but we also were aware that the new dynamic between the two of them would affect the dynamic in the friend group from time to time. This wasn't something that had been discussed as I assumed that since we were all adults and educated on how to best handle conflict (as young lawyers) that personal/group conflict would be handled appropriately. 

For storytelling ease, I will assign everyone a letter - A & B are the two that are dating, C is the other friend, and I'll refer to myself as ""me, I, or myself"". 

The Trip: I had booked a hotel suite with three bedrooms in it (which was cheaper to split than getting two separate rooms). Three of us arrived before the evening. Girl A said she had picked out a restaurant she would like us to go to for dinner and that B would be arriving later than originally planned (planned time was 7pm but new time was 9pm). I had said in my info text that I had a dinner place picked out and A didn't ask if changing that plan would be alright, she just assumed it would be (not a big issue, but a small detail that seemed weird to me). After dinner, she joked that she hadn't even read my informational message and didn't know what we was planned for the weekend. I just laughed because I assumed she would read the message once we got back to the room or something but never did. 

B finally arrived at 11pm (she just didn't leave her apartment in Pittsburgh until after she was supposed to have arrived at the hotel at 7pm) and tells everyone that she wants to go to the clubs. This isn't something I had planned, but I had told everyone that if they want to go out at night, we can, I just won't be the one planning it. A & B find clubs and bars in downtown DC to they want to check out. We get dressed, go out, and have fun. We get back to the hotel around 4am and everyone is really tired. I told them that we can cancel the brunch I had planned in the morning but that I had scheduled a private tour of the Capitol building with a legislative aid at 1:00pm the next day and for professional reasons would like to keep that appointment. Everyone agreed they would be ready for the Capitol tour on time. 

The next day, I wake up early to get everyone breakfast sandwiches to go so we can make it to the tour on time without being hungry. C wakes up in time to get ready and eat. A & B do not wake up. I tried calling both A & B and texted multiple times. C knocked on their bedroom door twice and tried talking through the door to see if they respond. Remember, we're in a hotel suite that has three bedrooms inside it so we can open the door to their bedroom if we want to. However, C and I agree that since A & B are a couple, it would be inappropriate to enter their room while they're sleeping if it's not an emergency (especially since they live in different states after graduating law school and haven't seen each other in 2 weeks at that point). So C and I go to the tour on our own. I'm annoyed but I'm not angry. I expect that when they wake up, they'll apologize and meet up with us. 

When the tour starts, B calls me but I don't answer because I'm on the tour. She sends a text to the group message saying, ""why didn't you knock on our door?"" I'm already annoyed that they slept in an I'm getting more annoyed at the text that accuses C and I of not being thoughtful enough to attempt to wake A & B (and I didn't get even a half hearted ""sorry, did you try waking us""?). I responded in a text that we did knock on their door twice. I had thought that now that I established that we did try to wake them, that I would get an apology, but instead B's reply was, ""okay no stress"". I took this as ""no stress that you didn't wake us, we're not upset about it."" I felt that was inappropriate and my annoyance began to turn into irritation because of this. I complained to C that I was irritated that B made it sound like C and I were the ones who should feel guilty for A & B not waking up. 

Two hours later, A & B arrive at the Capitol building and I'm still disappointed but hoping for an apology. At this point, C had told me that she was too tired to do the activities I had planned for the second part of the day (walking the national mall). This was understandable as C had broken her ankle a year ago and still needs frequent breaks from walking for long periods. C said she was going to go back to the hotel. When A & B arrive, I'm hoping to get my apology and then move on and spend the second half of the day with A & B while C rests. But A & B show up and the first thing A says is, ""why didn't you guys come in our room and wake us up?"" I don't answer this question because I think it's ridiculous that we're debating who is responsible for A & B oversleeping (in case you're wondering, no, neither of them set an alarm, even though I confirmed the time of the tour before going to sleep the night before). I let C answer that question while I look at the ground, clearly disappointed that A & B overslept and C is going back to the hotel. B then asks me why I look disappointed (she frequently has taken issue with the fact that my emotions are visible on my face- she likes when my positive emotions are visible on my face and for some reason is offended when negative emotions are visible on my face whether or not her actions caused me to feel negative emotions). I say, (in admittedly angry tone) that the things I planned for the weekend are getting canceled and it feels like the weekend is ruined. And I say that I'm just going to go back to the hotel with C. No one responds to this and I just walk away to order an Uber. A & B go to visit the buildings they missed this morning while C and I go back to the hotel. In the Uber ride, I'm complaining to C about how A & B always have to hijack group events (i.e. we always have to do what they want on their schedule) and that I've never really felt like part of the group (because A, B, and C became friends at the beginning of our first year of law school while I didn't become friends with them until the end of the first year of law school). These were genuine thoughts and feelings that I've had for a while and not just something I said because I was angry. I told C these feelings in confidence while I was angry, but I could tell that this made C uncomfortable that I was expressing negative emotions about our other two friends. 

The Conflict: C and I get back to the hotel room and I decide that A & B will never apologize and its no use continuing to be upset about their lack of respect for my weekend plans. I send B a text saying that I'll be less emotional once I've had a nap (because I was so tired from staying up late at clubs the night before and traveling the day before that) and that I'll be ready for dinner when everyone else is. B replies that they'll be back soon to get ready for dinner. 

When A & B do return, I put on a fake smile because I'm trying to let it go. Well, A & B tell me that before we go to dinner, all four of us need to talk about my being upset and that I need to apologize for being upset. C, who agreed with me during the Capitol that A & B should have set alarms and should apologize for oversleeping, was now not on my side presumably because she didn't like that I said A & B hijack events and that I've never really felt like part of the group. B said I need to apologize for saying that I felt like the weekend was ruined. I didn't believe I needed to apologize for saying how I felt and that I felt I was owed an apology because I had planned only one thing at a particular time with a Senator's aide and that I wanted all of us to be there for it. I then compared my comment about the ruined weekend to B's comment to me during the girls trip she planned where she said that because I had a panic attack at a club and just sat down instead of partying, it ruined her day. She said she doesn't see how the two situations and the two comments about ""ruined"" trips were the same. 

They said C and I should have tried harder to wake them by walking into their room and physically waking them up. B said, ""You know I'm late all the time so you should have expected this"" and that because I should have expected it I should have tried harder to wake them. A said, ""If it was really important to you that we be on that tour, you would have come into our room and woken us up"". I felt like those two statements were gaslighting statements and it was the moment in the conversation that I clearly remember any love or affection I had for B (who I was closer to than A) completely leave my body and I determined this friendship was no longer going to work out. C then said I ruined her day by coming back to the hotel with her and cancelling the second part of the day that I had planned. I challenged C on this because she said she wasn't going to be participating in the afternoon activities and she said that she would have just rented an electric bike, which is a valid point but she wanted to come back to the hotel and rest before renting a bike anyway. This is why I believe she chose sides due to my comments in the Uber ride back to the hotel. I told A & B that I don't feel comfortable walking in on a couple sleeping together if it's not an emergency (and attending a tour to avoid pissing off your friend who planned the tour is not an emergency). They said they don't care that I would feel uncomfortable doing it because I should push through my uncomfortableness if I really wanted them there. I also said I didn't know that that was something THEY would comfortable with someone doing and they said I should have known that they would be okay with it (even though this is never a conversation that has come up before so idk how I was supposed to know that). I said it would be different if they weren't a couple but that walking in on a couple sleeping together is inappropriate. B then said, ""i don't know what kind of relationship you think this is"". I didn't know how to reply to that so I just said I'm going to my room to sleep. If we aren't going to agree, then why can't we just agree to disagree and let it go? They said that we can't end the conversation until we're all on the same page (which is their page). But I walked away and C says, ""Idk why you're acting like this"". 

To my recollection, none of us were yelling at each other, raising voices, or being mean. However, I worry that because all the blame for this conflict has been placed on me by A, B & C that I did yell or scream or something and I just blacked it out. The three of them went to dinner without me and spent the rest of the night together. They asked me to come to dinner but I declined because I was too tired and ""too emotional"". 

The rest of the trip: There was one day left on the trip and then everyone was leaving really early the following morning. On the last day, I woke up really early (because I usually do) and composed an apology text because the bigger person always apologizes first, even if they don't think they need to. I realized that if I wanted an apology for something they didn't think should have hurt my feelings, then I should be able to apologize for something that I didn't think should have hurt their feelings. Because emotions are subjective and a good person always apologizes when they realize they've caused harm no matter how small. No reply to the apology text, not even an apology in return. 

I stay in my room until the absolute last minute when everyone is ready to go because I don't feel like socializing. I have a plan for the day but not a time for things (the Capitol building tour with the legislative aide was the only timed activity I planned). I let them take the lead on the order we visit places that I had picked out for the day. In the Uber ride from the hotel to our first destination, A is talking about how her nephew really likes Snoop Dog's kids album and especially the affirmations song that goes, ""my feelings matter, my feelings matter"". She kept singing that line over and over again in the car and describing how her nephew dances to it. It was a slap in the face because the night before I had been told by them that my feelings don't matter (i.e. Saying I FEEL the weekend was ruined required an apology according to them and me being UNCOMFORTABLE was not an excuse to not open their door and physically wake them). When we stopped for coffee, B asked me why I was being so quiet on the car ride. I just said I was tired because I think it's obvious why I'm still upset and she probably is aware of it. 

We awkwardly go through our day together and I barely speak unless I have something meaningful to say (usually I'm very talkative and say what comes to my mind). C keeps condescendingly mentioning that we need to keep on schedule (even though I had no timed schedule for the day) and keeps referring back to the text I sent before we go to the next planned activity. It was clear that all three of them missed the point of my anger. Instead of recognizing that I felt disrespected and wanted an apology, they think that I'm upset because we didn't follow my schedule exactly as planned. 

We all leave the next morning and I'm still upset because I'm confused about why this was blown out of proportion. I recognize that my response to their disrespect was not the most mature but I'm surprised that it even got that far. I'm confused why we couldn't agree to disagree. I'm confused why giving an apology is so difficult. And I'm sad that I lost three friends. It occurred to me that C was thrust into the middle of all of this and even though I don't like that she chose sides, I don't necessarily blame her and wanted to apologize to her. So I sent her a long email because I didn't want her to feeling pressured to reply to a text quickly. I explained that while I felt gaslighted by A & B and don't want to be friends with them anymore, that I was sorry for putting her in the middle of the disagreement and wanted to remain friends with her. I did acknowledge, however, that because A is C's best friend and A and C live in the same city, that it may be difficult for her to remain friends with me (because I know A holds insane grudges). She never replied to the email and I haven't talked to any of them since. 

Who is wrong here? Am I wrong for expressing my hurt feelings and asking for an apology? Are A & B wrong for not setting an alarm and then not apologizing for oversleeping? Are all of us wrong? ",3,1742870418.0,AITAH,4,0.81,False

As i was enjoying my coffee and magazines, i noticed that the 4 stools at the counter were only half-occupied. There was a tallish 50-something blonde and her 17-ish daughter 2 stools away. Trouble is, they had plopped their clothing/backpacks on the OTHER STOOLS, as to take up 4 stools instead of the 2 they needed. The daughter was perusing the store and wasn't even using her seat, but Mom had them 'taken' with backpacks and a purse to 'save them'. I actually saw a couple come in and were denied a seat at the counter due to mom telling the 'those seats were occupied'. When daughter eventually  returned, Mom seemed to celebrate her 'victory' with her. 

After the second time i saw this happen, I put away my magazines and decided to have some fun. When a third (fatter, Rednecky) couple came in and were driven away from Karen, I smiled and waved them over. I offered them my seat (I was taking up one seat at a 4-man table), and after they sat, i explained to them what was going on. They were a little put out by being denied a decent seat at the counter, and took my advice. They walked the 10 feet back to the counter and pulled out the stools, only to be told my Mom that those 'seats were taken'. They plopped their asses in the seats anyways, and (I'm assuming) told Mom they'd be **happy to move when the owner returned**. Mom indignantly took the backpacks/purse from the left two seats and pouted for awhile, looking around. 

Daughter came back and a smallish argument ensued, the Rednecky couple offering to move when others came by to reclaim their other seats. Mom was very put out and was angry that her scam was not working. She wound up putting both backpacks and daughters purse on her two seats, and the Redneck couple ignored her and enjoyed their coffees. Naturally, she left soon after. Redneck couple turned around and gave me a smile and a thumbs up. i responded with devil horns.",381,1742870385.0,pettyrevenge,36,0.81,False

As Valentine’s Day approaches, many people look for charming ways to express their love and affection. Farmhouse Valentine decor offers a delightful mix of rustic charm and romantic touches, perfect for creating a warm atmosphere in your home. The simplicity and coziness of farmhouse styles make them an ideal backdrop for celebrating love and togetherness.

One of the most popular elements of farmhouse Valentine decor includes rustic hearts made from wood or metal. These materials not only enhance the farmhouse aesthetic but also bring a heartfelt sentiment to your spaces. Hang wooden heart wall art or display galvanized metal hearts on your mantel to create an inviting focal point.

Another essential feature is the use of natural elements. Incorporating fresh flowers, like roses or wildflowers, into homemade centerpieces can add a vibrant touch. Pair them with vintage mason jars or rustic vases for an effortless, love-filled vignette. Additionally, consider using burlap table runners or lace accents to introduce texture that complements the farmhouse style.

For those looking to add a whimsical touch, consider incorporating seasonal throw pillows with love-themed quotes or patterns. Soft fabrics like cotton or linen in muted tones or plaid designs can elevate your seating areas while maintaining the comfort associated with farmhouse decor.

Utilizing candles is an effective way to enhance the romantic ambiance. Choose vintage candle holders or lanterns to add a soft glow to your dining table or coffee nook, creating an intimate setting for your Valentine’s celebrations. The flickering light paired with earthy tones will evoke warmth and sweetness, essential for a memorable occasion.

Ultimately, farmhouse Valentine decor resonates with individuality and charm, providing countless opportunities to showcase love in unique and heartwarming ways. By blending rustic elements with romantic details, you can create a space that not only celebrates Valentine’s Day but also reflects your personal style and warmth.

1jj94aj,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Dopabeane/comments/1jj94aj/fuck_hipaa_i_just_killed_my_worst_patient/,"Fuck HIPAA, I just killed my worst patient","My weekend went off the rails first thing Friday morning.



If you don’t remember, I’m on a relief team that just wrapped up our first bout of Ward 2 training. That culminated on Friday in the form of a practical exam that consisted of handling an inmate called Baby Freak for four hours.



It was a disaster.



I don’t know how to describe Baby Freak. They’re basically a deceptively adorable and thoroughly terrifying real-life cartoon. Their head is too large for their body. Their eyes are liquid black, and one is twice as big as the other. They have a small mouth and an utterly bizarre nose — pointed and almost puppy-like, but so faint as to be ghostly.



It doesn’t stop there.



Baby Freak’s neck and limbs look vaguely proportional until they decide it’s time to stretch.



I’ll be straight with you: Very little is as viscerally panic-inducing as watching a big-eyed cartoonish blob stretch bouncily upward until it’s taller than you.



Baby Freak can also scream so loudly it’s dangerous. I’ve had the displeasure of close-proximity gunshots without ear protection twice in my life. Those gunshots were quieter than Baby Freak. That’s bad.



What’s worse is Baby Freak handles excitement by tangling themselves around the nearest body and screaming.



Worst of all is Baby Freak is terribly strong. Pound for pound, they’re stronger than a chimpanzee.



I know this because the second we opened Baby Freak’s cell, they pounced on me.



They left bruises all over due to using me as both trapeze and trampoline before turning on Merry. They nearly strangled him before leaping to Camila and pulling out handfuls of her fur. Next, they nearly broke Courtney’s arm before Camila flung Baby Freak against the wall, where they flatted like a paintball before sliding to the floor.



Baby Freak began to cry, melting into a quivering, indistinct lump.



I knelt at a safe distance, vaguely aware that Baby Freak triggered an echo of the fear I used to feel around Christophe.



“Everyone is so mean,” they wailed. “Everyone is always so mean.” Tears spilled absurdly, spreading across the floor in a swiftly-growing puddle.



“I’m really sorry,” I said. “I don’t want to be mean. I was just trying to help, but I’m not as strong or fast as you. Can you slow down for me?”



“I’m so nice,” Baby Freak wept. “But no one ever remembers that I’m nice. They only remember when I’m mean. Everyone at the circus was so mean. I had to be mean back. Everyone forgets when I’m nice, but no one forgets when I’m mean. No one at the circus forgot I was mean.”



“I definitely don’t want to be mean. I just want to be want to be your friend.”



I extended my hand.



Baby Freak immediately took it. Their touch was repulsive — heavy and damp and unpleasantly warm, above all powerful —



Next thing I knew, Baby Freak was strangling me, kicking powerful little feet against my shoulders andhappily screeching, “Friends, friends, friends!”



The world darkened, bleeding shadows as thin and twirlingly boneless as the inhuman fingers pressing down on my windpipe.



Just as I fell to my knees, Christophe came roaring in and grabbed Baby Freak.



Instead of letting go, Baby Freak stretched absurdly. I could see arms stretching out of the corner of my eye, and it was so cartoonishly stupid that I laughed even as the pressure of their grip compounded on my throat.



The darkness bled back in, starry and warm. Voices echoed distantly. One started to sing, very badly. I thought of angels. Of course the angels in my heaven would have terrible singing voices.



All at once the pressure lifted from my throat.



I gasped.



Breathing hurt. It hurt and I hate hurting and this fucking *hurt*—



Someone scooped me up and carried me out as my vision cleared and my mind sharpened. Merry followed, and Camila and all the rest.



I realized Christophe was holding me. I kicked slightly so he set me down, but didn’t let go.



I looked over my shoulder, wincing as pain shot through my neck and shoulders.



Larkin was in Baby Freak’s cell, singing.



The terrible voice was his, but Baby Freak seemed enchanted — so enchanted they started singing along and bouncing with excitement. They jumped so high they grabbed their little trapeze and began to swing. Larkin took the opportunity to escape, slamming the cell door behind him.



Then he immediately dragged us to the break room and proceeded to lay into all of us, Mikey and Christophe especially.



“How could you assign Baby Freak to trainees without even mentioning the distraction protocol? And you—” He whirled on Christophe. “Why didn’t you utilize that protocol?”



“It’s not my cell block,” Christophe snapped. “Thanks to people like you, I do not get training for anyone who is not in my block. It is not my fault that I am expected to help at a moment’s notice, but not allowed to know how.”



Larkin looked like he was going to snap back, but restrained himself. “I didn’t know that. You’re right — that shouldn’t be a rule. I’ll talk to Richard.” He took a deep breath and scanned the group. “I’m sorry for losing my temper. Merrick, go down to Medical and have them check your neck.”



“No need,” said Merry. “This is nothing, trust me.”



“Go down to Medical,” he repeated. “Rachele, stay here a minute. The rest of you, go.”



Once the others had trickled out, he fixed me with a look I vividly remembered and viciously hated. “So. Christophe.”



""That is his name.”



“Thanks, I wasn’t sure,” he said dryly. “I’m going to cut to the chase here. Are you in a relationship?”



“Yes.”



“Do you know what he is?”



“Yes.”



“Do you know what he’s done?”



I felt a wave of shame. “Yes.”



“Do you know what he still does?”



“He doesn’t do it anymore.”



“According to Administration, he hasn’t done it in about…two months? I’m not trying to be a dick, but he’s literally five hundred years old. Two months isn’t even the blink of an eye.”



“Why are we having this conversation?”



“Because someone I know is dating a violent serial killer.”



“It’s not that simple.”



“It’s not about simplicity, it’s about what it is.”



I fixed him with a glare and loaded my next sentence with every ounce of compulsion I could muster: “Why do you care?”



""Because I don’t want you to die, especially not the way his victims tend to die. I don’t want him here. I don’t think he should be working with other inmates. I know Richard likes him, but Richard likes everyone. Ask him how well that’s gone for him the last couple of years.” Then he shook himself, looking irritated but surprisingly calm. “Happy?”



“No.”



“Look, I know how Christophe’s behaving right now, and it’s not that I don’t appreciate it. It’s that it’s not who he is.”



“And you do?”



“Yeah. I was on a yearlong A-Class rotation with him and Rafael before I transferred. I know him better than you do. Do what you want, but be careful. And if you ever need help, ask.”



I spun around and stepped out of his office only for Baby Freak to come speeding at me. I barely got out of the way.



Christophe came racing after him.



“Did you let them out again?” Larkin demanded.



“No,” he snarled over his shoulder. “You didn’t lock all of the locks.”



Larkin’s eyes widened and he took off after him, swearing.



Mikey approached, looking exhausted.



“What happened?” I asked.



“The locks.” He flexed his hands. “Baby Freak has really stretchy hands, so we have special  locks for them. Larkin was so pissed at us he forgot, so Baby Freak got out again.”



Far down the cell block, Christophe began to sing. Baby Freak fell still. A moment later, they started singing along.



But instead of crawling into Christophe’s arms, they crawled up the wall and across the ceiling, where they grabbed one of the overhead lights and started to swing, screeching.



I hurried over to help.



“What are you doing here?” Christophe snapped. His expression froze me in my tracks. Then he looked at Mikey. “Why is she here?”



“You can’t control her. What makes you think I can?” Even so, Mikey patted his throat, wincing. “He’s right, though. You need Medical.”



I looked back at Christophe, bristling, but he pretended not to see.



So I let Mikey walk me to Medical.



Merry was there, looking exhausted. He noted the bruises on my neck, then pointed to his. “Mikey, which of us looks worse?”



Mikey left without answering.



“I really want to make a joke,” Merry said, “but I don’t think there’s any joke I can come up about your neck that wouldn’t make Christophe break mine.”



He kept babbling on pleasantly, but I barely heard.



I was thinking of Larkin cornering me, how the Baby Freak disaster made me dread Ward 2 even more, of how dark the world went before Christophe intervened, and of Christophe himself. Christophe with Camila, Christophe with half a millennium’s worth of victims, Christophe with Isam, Christophe refusing to look at me because Larkin had the audacity to remember everyone he hurt, too.



But that wasn’t fair. That wasn’t why he was angry. Larkin was why he was angry.



I realized Merry was saying my name. I shook myself, meaning to smile, but burst into tears instead.



Merry, bless him, handled it beautifully.



At the end he said, “So, just so you know, we’re going to have to be each other’s blood clot buddies.”



“What?”



“See, blood clots are a risk of uncareful strangulation — trust me, I know all about this, *all* about it — and Baby Freak was definitely not being careful.”



After Medical released us, we went back down to the conference room. Everyone inside was looking tired and stressed, Mikey most of all.



“What the hell are you guys doing back here?” he asked. 



Merry said, “After that debacle, we obviously need all the learning you can do us.”



Mikey shrugged and started handing out packets. Each one consisted of handling protocols for a different inmate, except the last, which was my schedule for next week.



“So you seriously tried to send us away without at least giving us these?” I asked.



“Do you think I’m stupid?” Mikey asked mildly. “I was going to bring it to you after class. God.”



Father Mark wearily raised his hand.



“Yes?” Mikey said.



“I think there’s a mistake. Isabella and Velvel are on my schedule, but Isabella doesn’t even want to look at Catholic clergy. And Velvel is Jewish—”



“For real, I think Larkin just saw ‘chaplain’ in your paperwork and went for it.” Mikey sounded just as weary. “I’ll talk to him.”



At the end of class, the Harlequin summoned me for a meeting about Hadron and his upcoming execution.



“Good to see you,” he said when I stepped into his office. “I wanted to—”



“How am I supposed to kill him?” I demanded.



“Quite easily. I have no concerns, and neither should you.”



“Tell me.”



“You sound like a Heart Bird.”



“Sir—”



“I don’t want to discuss methods, I want to discuss purpose. Hadron’s death serves a triple purpose. You have to kill him, you have to take him apart—”



“What?”



“—and there will be eating involved.”



“*What*?”



“Se, this is why I didn’t want to tell you. Now, for the killing itself, you’ll of course have help—”



“From who?”



“A certain hyena of our acquaintance —”



Despite everything, my heart leapt. “Isam’s alive?”



“Thanks to my interference, yes. And barely. Thank your lucky stars it’s ‘barely’ because this would not be possible otherwise. But yes, he’s alive.”



“Who else is helping?”



“Dr. Courtland. You’ll have to do all the work, but he will walk you through what must be done. I hear you’re good at doing what you’re told, so I have no concerns and neither should you.”



“Does Jack know?”



“Jack knows his father’s death is imminent. He thinks he’s ill. It should stay that way.”



“Are we killing Hadron in his cell?”



“No. Research and Development. I’ll expect you there tonight at nine.”



“Why does it have to be me?”



“Because in my Pantheon, we fight fire with fire.”



“But—”



“Do not say that word.”



“What? But?”



He shuddered. “Yes. Now, I ask you to remember what Asher has done and what he will do if anyone in the Pantheon displeases him.”



“They have him under control.”



“They *think* they have him under control for now, but it’s an illusion, one Administration needs to keep themselves sane. But I have no need for such illusions. You have need of illusions, but not this one. Look at it in terms of a cost benefit analysis. What’s the potential cost of keeping Hadron alive versus the benefit?”



“The benefit is keeping him contained while we fix Jack.”



“Jack cannot be helped while his father lives.”



“How do you know?”



“The information came from the same source that helped me avoid certain future files of yours,” he said. “I trust that source implicitly, as should you.”



I had so many questions. So many I couldn’t even pick which one to ask.



“Hadron dies at your hand,” said the Harlequin. “As a result, his son lives.”



A tense and unusual silence stretched between us.



“I would not ask you to do this,” he said, “if I didn’t know it would help. If nothing else, trust that.”



Even though it doesn’t make sense, I did.



For once, I left his office feeling better than when I went in.



I went back to my room, secretly dreading Christophe’s return from his shift, especially because he came back an hour late.



But there was no need to worry: When he came in, there was no darkness in his eyes, no anger in his face.



There was, however, a whole lot of stress.



“I am sorry for how I treated you,” he said. “Do you want to talk about it?”



“No.”



“You never do.” He sat down next to me. “But there is something I need to talk to you about.”



“Which is?”



“Larkin is right to think what he thinks. I do not want you to pretend that he isn’t.”



“I don’t think he’s right.”



“That is not what I want to hear.”



“Then what do you want to hear?”



“It’s not what I want to hear. It’s what I want to know.” He hesitated. “Charlie told me this is not fair to say this to you, but I am going to say it. I want to know that Larkin being right doesn’t change how you feel.”



I was too tired for this, but that wasn’t new. “Nothing he says or thinks or does changes anything. Okay?”



“Okay.” He put his hand on mine. “Are you afraid of tomorrow?”



“Yeah.”



“Have you ever killed anyone?”



I didn’t want to think about this. Not about killing Hadron, not about killing anyone, not about Christophe killing other people, not when I need to draw every bit of comfort I could from him. “No.”



“If you do not want to do this, you should not have to.”



I thought of Hadron, then of Jack. “It’s not that easy.”



“I know. But if I can make it easier, let me.”



We went to bed, but I didn’t sleep. I don’t think he did, either.



The next morning, I went to see Jack. Christophe tagged along. I noticed that Jack lit up when he saw him. It made me feel guilty.



After pleasantries and a couple of games, Jack casually said, “Dr. Courtland told me my dad is really sick. That he’s going to die soon. What happens to me when he dies?”



“Me,” I said. “I’ll take care of you.”



He didn’t look at me.



“I know I’m not your mom, but you’re my family.”



“Okay. He’s not hurting, is he?”



I thought of Birdy and felt another spasm of guilt. “No. Dr. Courtland is taking care of him.”



“That’s what he said. I just…if he was lying, I wanted to make sure.”



“He’s not. I promise.”



“Good.” He tensed up, but there was a faint smile on his face. “The Harlequin keeps visiting me. He wants me to call him Grandpa.”



“I’m sorry. He…does things like that.”



“He doesn’t look like a grandpa.”



“I know.”



The smile faded. “Is he going to hurt me?”



“No. I promise.”



He relaxed. “Okay. He’s kind of cool.”



Shortly after that, he dismissed us politely, promising we could come visit tomorrow.



I spent the day in an anxious haze. I couldn’t stand to be near Christophe — or anyone else, for that matter — so I made my excuses and set off for a solitary walk.



The world outside was thin, slippery ice papered across swamps of dark, freezing mud. But the fresh air cleared my head, and it took so much focus to keep from slip-sliding through the forest that I finally calmed down.



Hours passed. The sun dipped. The air froze. I went back to the Pantheon.



Eating was an impossibility, but Christophe coaxed me into drinking a coffee and two cocoas.



When the time came, he walked me to Research and Development.



The Harlequin was waiting in the lobby with Dr. Courtland. Merry stood between them, visibly stressed.



“So you know what we’re doing tonight, right?” Dr. Courtland asked me.



“I know we’re killing someone.”



“*You* are,” said Dr. Courtland. “ It’s going to be a lethal injection—”



I was so relieved I nearly laughed. “Really?”



“Theatrical executions have their place,” the Harlequin said. “That place is not *my* Pantheon.”



Dr. Courtland quickly ran through the process. “I’ll take care of the set up. All you have to do is the last step.”



“Does Hadron know?”



“Yes.”



I turned to the Harlequin. “How did you get him to agree?”



“With the truth and a not so little bird, plus a hyena for insurance. Let’s go.”



Together, the five of us went to Hadron’s room. 



Birdy waited by his door, taller than a floor lamp and utterly terrifying. For the first time since we met, I wanted to recoil from her. A quick glance showed that Merry felt the same.



“Don’t be afraid of me,” she told me. “I’m still your friend. And don’t be afraid of Asher. It will be easy for you. I made sure.”



“How?”



“Because I was kind.”



The Harlequin opened the door.



Isam lay upon a table in the corner, a broken body in a sack of bruise-mottled skin, on a ventilator but alive. 



To the side was a workstation arranged with things that made me shudder — scalpels, surgical saws, all the things you don’t need for a lethal injection.



And in the center of the room, sitting anxious and alert on an operating table, was Hadron.



The way he watched me made me want to run, but I met his eyes.



We stared at each other as the Harlequin lamented the lack of a soundtrack (“If I weren’t the director with all the requisite responsibilities and decorum, I would have liked to play  ‘T.N.T.’ or possibly ‘The Final Countdown’ to see him off”) and Dr. Courtland busied himself.



Finally, Hadron told me, “Come here.”



Christophe tensed beside me. The Harlequin noticed. “Out,” he said sharply. “And who let you in here? The execution chamber is no place for dogs.”



“Don’t talk to him like that,” I snapped.



“Then make him leave.”



I reached for his hand. “It’ll be okay.”



“Will you?”



“Well, no. But we can deal with that later.”



“Go,” said the Harlequin. “And take the dreamwalker with you.”



They left. Without them, the room was much colder.



“Come here,” Hadron repeated.



“Be respectful,” the Harlequin warned.



Hadron didn’t acknowledge him as I approached. For reasons I can’t quite explain, I was glad.



“For what it’s worth to you,” Hadron told me, “I was lost until I found you.”



“I’m not her.""



“Lay back, Asher,” Dr. Courtland said quietly.



“Hold my hand while I die,” Hadron told me.



“Okay.”



He looked at me, eyes glittering, mouth miserable.



Then he laid back and reached for me, hand closing around my forearm.



It burned.



His fingers stuck to my skin and sunk in like coals.



And it *hurt*.



It was agony. I hate pain. I hate pain the way the Harlequin hates the dark.



Before my eyes, scales erupted along my arms. They weren’t right — not smooth, not beautiful. Jagged and malformed, upright and crooked.



Hadron’s grip tightened. His hand looked different. It looked *wrong*. Full of fire, *made* of fire, expanding, enveloping, all-encompassing —



And suddenly we were hurtling through a dim tunnel of dead fire and dull stars.



I reached out in panic. The walls were smooth and not quite solid. I couldn’t get a grip, so I flailed.



Then my scales — my jagged, crooked, broken scales — caught and dragged, slowing us down.



To my surprise, he let go.



We stopped.



He turned and looked at me. The soft light all around us made him look younger.



“So,” he asked, “do you think death is too good for me?”



His voice, though, was old. Brittle and bitter and so frightened.



It made my chest ache.



“No,” I lied.



“I’m not going to hurt you,” he said. “I just want to talk where they can’t hear.”



“Why?”



 “I came here because of you. *For* you. And now I’m dying for it. The least you can do is listen.”



“Then let’s talk.”



He looked down. There was a long, awful silence.



Then words exploded out of him:



“The dinosaur put things in my head. It was insane. It was so insane I don’t even know what the point was. Kind of like our carnival. No point to that either.”



I waited.



“But some of it wasn't insane. Some of it was you. Only it was me, because I was you. But I was still me, too. I was doing to me what I used to do to you. I’m sorry.”



The longer he spoke, the more familiar his voice became. Like years were falling away. Maybe they were. In this world at least, those years haven’t happened. So why shouldn’t they vanish?



“I hope, someday, you’ll get to be me. Just for a little bit, to understand me.” He wiped his eyes. “So after the dinosaur made me you? After that came a very long time. Very, very long. The way I lived through what I did to you, I lived through what I did to everyone else. All the people who died for what I did for Jack. And I’m still not sorry for it because it’s how I saved him. How I got him here to you. Do you think I should die for that? For not being sorry?”



“No.” I don’t even know if that was a lie.



“After the long, long time, I saw even crazier things. But this time, they weren’t bad. They were sad but they were good. Know why?”



I didn’t trust myself to speak.



“Those things were the ways to save Jack. All the ways.” His chest hitched. “And I have to be gone for every single one. That was always the answer. You without me. That’s how he makes it: Without me.”



His voice broke and he wiped his eyes again. Then he laughed.



“I don’t know why I’m surprised. That’s the story of my life. Everyone’s always been happier without me. Don’t know why I thought you would be different. But I did. I was so lost until I found you, and you didn't even want to be found.”



For a second, I saw him as he’d been — or at least, as my Asher had been. A teenager who’d been born without a future, just like me.



“Don’t lie,” he said. “I can’t lie to you, so it’s only fair that you don’t lie to me. Are you looking forward to killing me?”



“I don’t think I’ve ever wanted to do anything less, Asher.”



He didn’t answer for a while.



Then—



“Do you think it’s true?”



“What?”



“That me dying is going to save him.”



The hope in his voice and the agony on his face nearly broke me apart.



I didn’t want to lie, so I thought about it. Turned it over in my mind. Considered everything I knew and everything I’ve guessed.



Then I said, “Yes.”



“Would you tell me if you didn’t?”



“I don’t know.”



We stood in silence.



“I would have done anything for you,” he finally said. “Anything but lose my son. Why wasn’t it enough?”



There was so much wrong with this.



So much.



But there was no way to say it. Not now, not with hurt flooding every line of his face and emanating from him like light. There was only one thing I could say. It was a lie, but it was right:



“Because I’ve always been so dark.”



He relaxed. “I’m only doing this because I trust you. And I only trust you is because I know that everywhere but here, you’re mine.”



I fought off a full body shudder.



“I know it’s my fault that there’s nowhere our son can be. I loved him so much I ruined everything. But you’re going to fix it. You’ll make somewhere he can be. I won’t get to see it. You will, and I hate you for it. But I accept it, because everything I do is to save him. So I’ll do this, because you’re going to save him.”



“If it kills me.”



This, at least, wasn’t a lie.



He reached out, and I took his hand.



We went back through the tunnel, all dim dead fire except for the deep flickering lines of flame my crooked scales had scored into the walls.



And then we were in his death chamber.



The Harlequin was there, monstrous and circling Dr. Courtland as Isam’s ventilator wheezed. Merry was behind them, promising to do everything he could to find me while Birdy watched from her corner. Christophe stood in front of Merry like a shield.



Of course, Christophe saw me first.



He moved so quickly there was no hope, no chance, no time to even comprehend that he’d moved before Hadron collapsed, bonelessly and strangely weightless, to the floor.



“Bad dog.” The Harlequin’s tone turned my insides to frozen lead. “Very bad dog.”



Aware of the scales on my arms, I stepped in front of Christophe. He shifted like he was going to stop me.



Then the Harlequin shrugged. “But understandable. Put him on the table.”

 

Even though Christophe didn’t need my help, I picked up Hadron by the shoulders. I immediately wished I hadn’t; I felt the broken bones in his neck grind together and nearly dropped him in disgust.



“Bombs require a very particular method of defusion,” the Harlequin said. “It’s a highly intensive fourteen-step process. Fortunately for you, defusing bomb boys is much easier. Instead of fourteen steps to break him down, we’ll simply break him down into fourteen pieces. Doctor?”



Dr. Courtland shuffled forward. The lights threw tiered shadows under his eyes, and he was trembling.



But when he went to stand by me, his hands were steady.



“This is going to be terrible for you.” His voice was just as steady. “Just remember it’s for Jack.”



“You’ll do great,” Birdy said from her corner. “I promise.”



The surgical workstation glared brightly, but everything on it — the scalpel, the bone saw, all the rest — looked terribly dark.



*It’s a game*, I told myself. *Just a game.*



And with that, Dr. Courtland very calmly walked me through my first human dissection. It was awful, but simple.



More importantly, it was quick.



I thought I was done.



Then the Harlequin said, “Excellent. Now remove his heart.”



“What?” I gasped.



“You heard me.”



Over the course of a small, terrible eternity, I removed Hadron’s heart. It was hard, and I nicked something I wasn’t supposed to nick. Blood spurted up, splashing my cheek, burning it so badly I cried.



We paused while Dr. Courtland found a gown and face shield. It made me laugh — if his blood could blister my skin, it would undoubtedly corrode anything else.



But I put them on anyway, and we continued.

Under Dr. Courtland’s instruction, I removed Hadron’s eyes, lungs, and brain. Then I cut off his arms and legs. From there, I removed his feet, and finally his hands. The hand where the friendship bracelet had been — the one with the terrifying, absurd portal through which he’d dragged me, the thing through which he’d wrought his incomprehensible destruction — shimmered like crystalized fire. The hole in the center was dark and endless as Birdy’s eyes.



“Now,” said the Harlequin, “cut his heart into eight pieces.”



Dr. Courtland briefly sagged against the gurney.



Speaking of absurdity, this question came out of my mouth: “Do the pieces have to be even?”



“Of course not.”



“It’ll bleed. What if it burns me again?”



“Can fire burn fire?”



I pointed to my cheek, which hurt all the way down to the bone. “You tell me.”



“That was different,” he said dismissively.



“I’ll help,” Birdy said quietly. She lurched forward and spread her wing over the heart.



I couldn’t see a thing, but it didn’t matter because she guided me carefully. “Cut here. A little to the left. Press down. Now to the right. Go up. Cut. Good. Now to the left…”



And when she finally folded her wing back against her body, I had eight pieces of Hadron’s heart, firm and tough and horribly slick.



“Eat one,” said the Harlequin.



Revulsion almost too powerful to bear thundered through me. “No.”



“Eat one, or your bad dog suffers.”



I picked the smallest piece, bracing myself for pain. To my immense relief, it didn’t burn.



“I thought he’d do that,” Birdy said. “That’s why I helped you cut that piece so small.”



“Thank you,” I said.



“You’re welcome,” said the Harlequin.



I put the piece of Hadron’s heart on my tongue and swallowed.



It burned all the way down.



It made me remember when I’d been at my sickest, after vomiting so much that bile felt like fire eating me from the inside out. Dead rotten fire.



The Harlequin surveyed the ruined heart. Then he picked a piece and ate it. The blood stained his teeth. He looked at Dr. Courtland. “Pick one and eat.”



Dr. Courtland nearly collapsed, but did as he was told.



“Darling girl, pick one for your bad dog.”



The sheer disgust on Christophe’s face was staggering. I looked at him, a silent question. He shook his head, then picked a piece and swallowed it.



The Harlequin turned to Merry. “Now you.”



“Are you fucking serious?” The sheer venom in his tone made me jump.



“Very. You knew this was coming. You should be flattered.”



He glared at the Harlequin, looking so unlike himself I almost couldn’t reconcile it was him. Then he snatched a piece and it began to chew. It made him gag.



Satisfied, the Harlequin picked up another piece and held it out to Dr. Courtland. “Feed this to the better Asher.”



“What if he won’t eat it?”



“Then you die.”



Dr. Courtland took it without a word and left.



The Harlequin turned back to me. “Now choose one for Jack.”



“No,” I said, aghast.



“If you don’t, he will die.”



Nausea overtook me. When it finally passed, I chose the smallest of the two pieces left.



“Follow me,” said the Harlequin.



I did. Christophe followed me. Birdy came after us, talons clacking.



Only at Jack’s threshold did I remember I was wearing a blood-soaked surgical gown. I shucked it off in a panic and kicked it away. Christophe gently removed my face shield and dropped it on the coat.



Then we went inside.



Jack sat cross-legged on his bed, all sad eyes and unhappy mouth, just like his father.



The Harlequin made a big production of hugging him. A smile tugged the corner of Jack’s mouth. “Your not-mother brought something for you. A little treat to lift your spirits.”



Twin surges of horror and hatred welled up inside me as I looked down at the piece of Hadron’s heart in my palm.



It was gone. In its place was a chocolate cookie.



Jack looked at me hopefully. Before I could lose my nerve, I handed it to him. He took a bite and grimaced slightly. “It’s really spicy.”



“It’s a chili chocolate cookie,” the Harlequin lied. “One of her specialities.”



“It’s really good,” Jack said. “I was just surprised.” He finished it in two bites. Then he looked up, frowning, and went very still.



And without a word, he took my hand.



I froze.



The last time Jack touched me, I saw the world as he does: Full of holes. Weird, shimmering, open sores in the fabric of existence through which strange, glittering eyes peered.



The holes were still there, but faded and smaller and somehow murky, like tiny broken windows mended with cellophane.



“What does it mean?” His voice was shrill and fearful.



“It means,” said the Harlequin, “that you — or at least a version of you — belongs here now.”



Jack looked at me almost furtively. There was hope in his eyes, along with hurt and something like bitterness. “How?”



“That’s a question neither you nor I want to hear the answer to. But she does have something you do need to hear, and privately. We’ll leave you to it.” He swept past me, plucking Christophe’s sleeve as he went. To my surprise, Christophe followed him out.



The door closing sounded like the end of the world. For Jack, I guess it was.



“Is it my dad?” His voice was a thin, raspy squeak.



I wanted to speak, wanted to be an adult, wanted to tell him with gentleness, wanted to emanate safety.



Instead, I just nodded.



His voice broke. “Why didn’t anyone come get me?”



“He didn’t want you to see him that way.” My voice was as thin and raspy as his.



“So?”



I didn’t have an answer.



“Can I die too? I want to go with him.”



“Jack—”



“I’m alone without him. I don’t have anyone. You don’t count. I know you think you do, but you don’t. You *don’t.*”



“You’re right. You’re right, but you count. No matter what happens—”



“*All that happened is he left me alone*!”



“You’re not alone.""



But he wailed as if hadn’t heard me: “I’m supposed to be dead and I want to be. I want to go. I want to be with my mom. He wouldn’t ever let me go with my mom. He wouldn’t let me go. Let me go. Please just let me go. Maybe that’s how we get to his dream. Maybe that’s how I’ll be the baby and how he’ll be happy and how we’ll both be with you.”



He dissolved into tears.



Asher’s voice wound through my head: *You will always be so dark*.



I pushed it away. “You’re here with me. And I’ll do everything I can — everything that isn’t hurting you or someone else — to make you better.”



“What if you can’t?”



Now Aurora’s voice echoed: *Palliative care. Hospice.* “Then I’ll let you decide. But let me try.”



“I don’t want to try anymore. I want to go.”



I held him for a long time, my burned cheek throbbing in time with his sobs.



He screamed into my arms. He told me he hated me. He told me he hated his father. He told me he was never supposed to be alive, and begged me to let him go.



I held him until he cried himself to sleep. Then I stayed until he woke up and calmly told me to go away.



I didn’t want to leave him, but I know how it feels to long for solitude that no one would give you.



So I gave it, because it was all I had to give.



When I exited into the hallway, the Harlequin was waiting.



He held the surgical tray. On it was the last piece of Hadron’s heart. The sight filled me with revulsion. “I’m not feeding that to him.”



He shoved the tray into my hands. “Good, because it isn’t for him.”



“I’m not eating it.”



“It isn’t for you, either.”



“Who’s it for?”



“Whoever you want, but choose quickly. We’re already running late.”



“For what?”



“For things to grow.”



“What’s growing?”



“Everything we need to keep my grandson safe.”



“What did you do?”



“Only half of what I’d hoped.”



“Will you please, for once, just talk to me like a normal person?”



“Nothing here is normal, least of all me, second least of all you.”



I unsuccessfully quelled my temper. “Why did you make us eat his heart?”

“To sink anchors.”

“What are we anchoring?”

“Something new.” He clucked his tongue, eyes widening. “Oh, look at your face. That burn is awful. Come here.”

He reached into his pocket and extracted a screw-top tin. When he opened it, the mingled scent of grassfires and cocoa choked me.



“Settle down. It’s just burn ointment — made specially for you, I might add.”



He dabbed it on my cheek. The effect was instantaneous. I teared up from sheer relief.



“That’s better,” he soothed. “Much better.” He surveyed his work for a moment, then said, “Darling girl, there’s something you need to understand.”



“What?”



“Love is a wound.”



It took all my strength not to roll my eyes.



“Pain can be necessary. It can even be pleasant. Sometimes it’s exquisite. But left too long, wounds fester. I don’t want you to fester.”



“Me either.”



“I know. Off to bed.”



He sauntered off. I stayed in place, gripping the tray so hard my fingers were numb while the final shred of heart glistened.



*Whoever you want, but do it quickly.*



And then, as if on cue — and maybe it was, maybe she’d been waiting this whole time —



“Are you okay?” Birdy asked, bobbing toward me. Her feathers shone. They looked beautiful.



“Yes,” I said. “I have something for you.”



“Really?”



“Yep.” I picked up the piece of heart. The texture nearly made me gag.



She approached, looking entirely like a monster. It should have frightened me, but instead it soothed me. “Are you sure?”



“Very.”



She opened her beak, and I tossed the last piece of Hadron’s heart inside.



She shrank down before my eyes.



In the span of a minute, she went from taller than me to the size of a cat.



I scooped her up, suddenly aware that the corridor was painfully cold.



“How’s your nest?” I asked.



“Done,” she said.



I dropped her off at Merry’s door. She tapped on it with her beak as I hurried off.



Christophe was waiting. I knew he wanted to hug me, but in turn he sensed that I didn’t want to be touched. And I didn’t. Not after seeing Isam on his ventilator, not after watching him break Asher’s neck, not after holding Jack. Jack who went starry-eyed every time he saw him.



I wanted to cry. I wanted to be alone. But *alone* wasn’t an option. My options were Christophe and Pierette.



I chose Christophe.



We went to bed, but I didn’t sleep. It was too cold. So cold that I went to Pierette’s room to steal as many spare blankets as I dared. Against his objections, I tucked most of them in around Christophe.



I don’t know what that means. It’s something else I don’t want to know or think about. Just another problem that the Agency will eventually punish or exploit.



Anyway, I’ve been a wreck ever since.



So much of a wreck that the Harlequin postponed my interviews. When he called me for a meeting this morning, he actually offered to postpone them indefinitely. “I mean, to be fair, invasive interrogation techniques are Eric’s proclivity, not mine.”



“No, I'll be fine.” Then I asked, “Why did you pick who you picked to eat Hadron’s heart?”



“Why do you ask?”



“I think you know why.”



He smiled. “I do. And that is *not* why, so relax. I chose the adults Jack likes best.”



“What do you mean?”



“You’re the closest thing he has to a mother. He’s enchanted by me. He hero-worships your bad dog. Dr. Courtland makes him feel safe. His father’s godlike double has captured his imagination and adoration in that half-mythical manner unique to absent fathers. Captain Manlet cured his nightmares. As for your Heart Bird — that *is* a complication.”



“In what way?”



“He doesn’t know what Heart Birds are, but he loathes them. If he knew you or the dreamwalker were close to Birdy, we’d be facing a different and altogether more impossible situation. But as his de facto mother, the choice was yours and I trust you. Just know that Jack won’t.”



“What happens next?”



“At some point, you’ll suffer an open wound that will result in a Jack of your own. In the absence of profound change, it will unfortunately be necessary for the current Jack to survive.”



My stomach fell.



“Much sooner than that —if I have my way — you and I and my wife who I hate and her most broken and beautiful son will construct a parallel. If that happens quickly and successfully, there will be no need for wounds.”



My stomach slowly settled back into its normal place.



“Love is a wound,” he said. “And fate is a thief. This is how we heal and how we reclaim what’s been stolen from us.”



For the first time I wondered — truly, deeply wondered — who he was. What he was. Where he’d come from. Why he cared.



But in that moment, it was enough to know he did.



“Let’s get healing and reclaiming,” I said.

He smiled. For once he didn’t look frightening or threatening or malevolent or inhuman. He just looked relieved. “Let’s.”

And that’s that, at least for now.

I don’t know what he has planned. I don’t know what  Hadron had to do with it. I don’t even know why I had to kill him.

 I don’t know anything at all.

I recently went through the worst kind of torment. I’m now 3 months post breakup but what happened after made it worse.  I want to share my story to help process and get support from you that this was abuse.

I met someone in the elevator of campus and instantly thought maybe he was my husband. But he worried me because he just had the look of someone who is a player, and appeared mysterious. Because of that, I suggested he actually get to know my acquaintance. But then we started to fall for eachother hard. Yet, he asked me on a date AND at the same time pursued an acquaintance. I somehow ignored this red flag and felt like the chosen one when we kept talking instead of her. 

He got me drunk and slept with me right away and I was too drunk to even give consent but didn’t quite register that. He made grand gestures to fly to see me from across the country, but then mentioned how my furniture was easily replaceable if I were to move closer to him (implying it wasn’t expensive). He asked me to stay with him for 2 weeks and he planned an itinerary that covered every single day filled with activities. He did regularly split the bill however - even though he owned a luxury condo and all other kinds of expensive things and made sure I knew of it. He went through a marriage book called “8 dates to marriage” with me excitedly making it seem we were in it for the long haul and even asking what it would be like to ask my dad for my hand 

We started to bicker because he saw I was going out with friends, since we had shared location, and he got insecure and drunkenly yelled at me. Ever since then, he started to become…hot and cold, him neglecting me - he kissed me on the lips a total of 6 times in our 8 month relationship. He regularly put me down, told me I run weirdly, that I’m “the darkest person here” while in France (I’m not white), that my job wasn’t as high level as he thought it was, that I have flat feet, that I have blisters on my feet, pointing out when a girl was checking him out or that a friend wanted to set him up with someone but found out he was taken, criticizing my movements in front of his friends as though I was embarrassing him, having me fly out every week to see him and only seeing me twice.. gaslighting me anytime I called him out  - asking for a girls number in front of me and then saying it was for networking . He once pretended to choke me and also forcibly craned my neck to the mirror and held it really hard and said don’t you see how beautiful you are? He always walked one full block ahead of me and when I commented that it wasn’t very nice he would say “well it’s because you’re too slow.”

Other things he did:

He told me he’d dispose of my body in his closet drawer, jokingly. 

When he had sex with me he wouldn’t really check if he was hurting me and sometimes I’d move backwards to reduce the intensity and he’d just grab me back to him and laughingly say “where do youu think you’re going?”

He would always mention whenever a girl was “making eyes” at him. He always seemed nervous when he introduced me to his friends or we all hung out together, as though I was embarrassing. 

He was very mean to me for being slow at ordering my coffee at breakfast at an amazing resort in France. When we hiked he was always walking way far ahead of me and not even checking to see if I was behind him 

Anytime I tried to progress things past being exclusive he said he needed me to move to his city but then whenever I would make plans to he said he would hate if I moved and it didn’t work out and then I hated him. 

He only ever cuddled me twice. He slept hugging pillows otherwise and claimed it was bc an ex liked cuddling and he got so used to it he replaced that with pillows. 

When I cried about personal things to him he would  roll over and decide to just sleep instead of saying anything or comforting me

He drove me to a point where I had to take a few days of space from him and all this mistreatment that he then dumped me claiming I ghosted him then told me he wanted to stay in touch and that he still had hope

Then he began to follow and get closer to the girl I was worried about while we were dating and now they’re close, but he claims that she has a bf.

He said he has nothing but positive feelings for me  - and was surprised when I mentioned his mistreatment, saying “you never mentioned any of this before..” as though to discredit it. The next day he laid on the charm thick and even hit on me and I fell for it and told him maybe we can still be together one day and he slammed that door shut and ignored me. I felt so stupid after that but realize maybe it was a trauma reaction from me. 

Recently I went to school and one of his closest friends pretended like he didn’t hear me say hi and cruelly made a weird expression, like of disgust and being pompous and walked arrogantly right past me. It humiliated me. I texted my ex and told him, and said maybe I shouldn’t attend the class event the next day bc it’s uncomfortable. and he responds by saying “I haven’t told anyone anything. You should go bc I’m sick and might not be there.” 

So I went to the event and my ex came up to me and said “see this isn’t bad you’re such a drama queen” and he looked very weird. His friend was there and later tried to ice me out again until I said HI really obviously and he awkwardly just said “..hi…some people are coming to my house after u can join if there is room…” very fakely. I felt humiliated again, as though he was fed a crazy story about me from my ex. It threw me back into a tailspin of trauma where I now worry my ex has painted me out to be a crazy unhinged ex or that I’m abusive. ",1,1742869506.0,LifeAfterNarcissism,2,1.0,False

“Good Morning ladies!” The dorm senior, Jenna, shouts as she makes her way down the corridor of the dorms, banging on each door as she goes. I roll over with a gro-an and stretch to pick up my phone. I read the time and then rub my eyes before checking the time again because there’s no way I read it right. Glancing around the room I feel confident that my eyes are now working correctly and check the time again.

“Mother fluffer!” I curse under my breath. I was right the first time. It’s 5:30 AM! That confirms my suspicions that perfect Jenna with the too-friendly smile is evil. It’s the first day of university and classes start at 9 AM. Why on earth is she waking the whole dorm up at 5:30? I can hear grumbling and cursing from the other girls through the paper-thin walls as Jenna loudly announces that it’s shower time. I grab the pillow and press it over my head to try and block out the noise. I had my alarm set for 8 AM, which would have given me plenty of time to shower and have breakfast before our first class. I manage to block out enough of the noise that I start drifting back to sleep. BANG, BANG, BANG!

“Josie Banks, room number 5, I don’t hear any movement in there!” Jenna’s sickly sweet voice calls through the door as she hammers on it, then she begins to rattle the door handle. With a huff I chuck my pillow on the floor, throw back my covers and get up, stomping to the door I yank it open.

“It is 5:30 AM!” I hiss at Jenna. She smiles with fake sympathy as she looks me up and down.

“I am aware of the time Miss Banks, but this year’s stock is going to need extra time to get ready if we are going to make any of you look presentable,” she grins.

“We are not cattle,” I huff and begin to shut the door in her face. She stops it with a foot in the doorway and looks down at her clipboard.

“Josie Banks, eighteen years old, here to study criminology. Father is deceased, mother suffers from psychosis and currently resides in a secure hospital. Josie needs support to process her emotions and would benefit greatly from structure and routine. Josie has no other living rel…” I cut her off by robing the clipboard from her hand and reading the information sheet she had on me. With every word I read of my personal information, my anger grows, like each letter adds fuel to the already growing fire within me. Who gave her this information? She’s just a senior student with a voluntary role as dorm leader, she has no right or need for this information. This is a breach of privacy.

“How did you get this?” I seeth. Students gather in the corridor, their attention now focused on the drama unfolding in front of them.

“As the dorm leader, I am privy to any information that may help me to support you,” Jenna states, holding her head high like she feels superior. “It was in the enrolment statement, that you signed and agreed to when you accepted your place within this university,” she adds. I tear the page from the clip holding it down and slam the board into her heart.

“You had no right to that information, and you certainly had no right to broadcast it to the whole dorm,” I shout as I shove her away from my door. There’s a brief look of shock on her face as her head cracks against the wall before her expression goes blank and she slumps down to the floor with a thud. There's a distinct crack in the plaster on the wall where she hit it. Gasps sound out down the hall as I slam the door. I lean against it in disbelief, looking down at my hands in disgust.

“Someone call an ambulance!” I hear one of the girls in the hall shout.

How did that just happen? I didn't shove her that hard did I?… no, it's not possible, I'm not that strong and I barely touched her. She must have tripped on something and hit her head. That crack in the wall must have already been there and I'd just not noticed it until now.

“Is she breathing?” I hear a panicked voice ask. I don't hear the answer as my ears begin to ring and my heart begins to pound loudly. I feel as if the oxygen has been svcked out of the room as I draw in gasping lungfuls of useless air. My heart tightens with every breath like more and more weight is being added on top of me. My vision goes blurry before turning completely black, then I become light, and the weight lifts from me as I relax into peaceful darkness.

“Miss Banks wake up!” a stern voice penetrates the blissful bubble of silence I had fallen into. I blink open my eyes, letting my blurry vision adjust to take in the figure hovering above me. It's a plump lady with a grim-faced expression that I don't recognise.

“Who are you?” I murmur, pushing myself up into a sitting position and looking around to take in my surroundings.

“ I'm Officer Shelby, I'm with the Mount University Police. We need to take you down to the station,” she gives me a sympathetic smile as she pulls me up to my feet. In the broken doorway of my room stands another police officer. This one is looking curiously between me, the doorway and the crack in the wall where Jenna had been slumped. I svck in a breath as I remember what had happened. Jenna is no longer there, which is good. I must have passed out for a short time and she had reported me to the police for causing her to fall.

“I'm sorry officer, this was all a bit of a misunderstanding. I didn't mean for her to fall, I just pushed her out of my doorway so I could close my door and…” I begin to explain until the officer holds up a hand to stop me.

“Save it for the interview honey,” she says softly, whilst guiding me out of the building and into the back of a waiting police car. My fellow students watch on, giving looks of pity, smirks and utter disgust as I pass… perfect, I've made a great first impression.

Chapter 2

For the next few hours, I watch the clock in the small room they have me locked in. I’d drank my small paper cup of water hours ago and I've counted every tiny crack I can find in the plastered walls at least ten times. Just when I'm at the point of driving myself completely insane by mentally replaying what happened with Jenna over and over again, the door opens. The male officer that I'd seen in my dorm room earlier walks in and takes the seat opposite me at the table.

“Sorry to keep you waiting Miss Banks,” he says, laying a paper folder out on the table. He opens it and begins to read through it in silence. The seconds tick by and I start to get fidgety in my seat at the uncomfortable silence. Just as I open my mouth to break the silence the door opens again and a tall man wearing an expensive-looking suit walks in holding a briefcase. The man looks down at me in an assessing way. He is extremely good-looking and exudes dominance in a way that makes him hard to look at.

“Is this her?” he says in an almost snort, jer-king his chin in my direction.

“Yes, Sir,” the police officer nods, motioning for the newcomer to sit next to him. He takes his seat and reads through the paperwork the officer hands to him. I study his face as he reads. He's one of those ageless guys. His serious, no-bulllshit demeanour makes him seem like he's much older, but his face is young. My guess is he could be anywhere between twenty and forty. He must feel me looking at him as his eyes flick up to mine over the paper and he holds my gaze. Everything in me screams at me to look away, to break the eye contact, but I don't. I won't be bullied by some stuck-up detective. His eyes grow intense and then I swear I see the flash of a smirk before he slams his hand down on the table, making me jump back in fright.

“Are you trying to challenge me Miss Banks?” he asks in a deeper voice than he'd used with the other officer.

“Challenge you?” I snort and raise an eyebrow, trying to use my attitude to mask how much he had scared me.

“I suggest you learn to submit, and quickly, because at the place you are going, the people won't be as tolerant as I am,” he says, closing the folder and putting it into his briefcase before turning to the officer and nodding. My heart pounds in my heart and panic grips me as I watch the two men shake hands. “I’ll take her from here,” the stuck-up detective tells the officer.

“No,” I manage to rasp out. “Please, I didn't mean to hurt her. I can't go to prison. I can't!… Don't I get a solicitor?… A phone call?” I plead with the officer as he leaves the room. I turn my attention back to the suited man. “Please sir, it was an accident,” I sob.

“Not so tough now are we?” he smirks at me. “Let's go, Miss Banks, I have a very busy schedule and don't have time for your tears,” he sighs and heads towards the door. I remain seated, frozen in fear and shock. “You have two seconds to follow me, otherwise I will leave you here and let the police throw you in prison,” he snaps.

“Wait, what?” I gasp and turn to look at him. He gestures to the open doorway he is standing in and without too much thought I scramble to my feet and rush to his side.

“That's what I thought,” I hear him remark under his breath. He walks down the corridor with large strides that I struggle to keep up with.

“Where are we going?” I whisper to him as we pass police officers who don't seem to pay any attention to us. He ignores me like the rude assh-ole that he is and doesn't even look at me until we reach the elevator. He presses the button and turns to face me whilst we wait for the doors to open.

“Tell me, Miss Banks, are you prone to panic attacks?” He asks

“Huh?” I respond, a little taken aback at this whole situation.

“Your file says you passed out from a suspected panic attack at the scene, and you seem to be on the brink of another panic attack now. So what I am asking, little girl, is if I’m going to have to hold your hand through our journey?” He snarks. Anger flares in me at his words.

“Well I’m sorry Mr Perfect, I’ve had a day so do excuse me if I’m a little upset!” I hiss at him, crossing my arms to let him know how much of a badass I am. He gives me another of his barely there smirks and a nod in what seems like approval. The elevator dings at that moment, the doors opening and he steps forward without another word. I follow the smarmy guy in and stand beside him. I watch as the doors close, with a strange sense that they're closing on my old life.

“Collins,” he says, snapping me out of my strange thoughts I turn to give him a questioning look. “It's Mr Collins,” he says in a barely there whisper as he steps dangerously close and looks down at me. So close that when I take a breath my heart touches his. The air suddenly feels charged as I stare up into Mr Collins’ eyes. The arm holding the briefcase snakes around my back and he pulls me flush against his heart, causing me to gasp. Holy sh-it balls this man is hot. He brings up his other hand and gently strokes my cheek with a secret smile, then in a flash he grips my chin hard. “Sleep,” he demands, his eyes flashing blue as he speaks. My last thought before my body shuts down is that I'm going to knee this jer-k in the balls as soon as I get the opportunity.

Chapter 3

“Wake up, Miss Banks,” a smooth voice says, the tone washes over me like a loving caress, and for the first time in a very long time I feel safe and it's not something I want to wake up from just yet. I nuzzle my face into the warmth against my cheek. A sweet, buttery and woodsy kind of scent hits my nose and I give an approving hum at the pleasing smell. A grunt of disapproval ruins my contentment right before I am dropped unceremoniously onto my back. The landing is soft but still unpleasant.

“What the he-ll!” I curse, rushing to sit and take in my surroundings. I'm on a couch in a dimly lit room, bright light suddenly floods the room making me squint against it. I shift my attention to the source of the light, fighting the urge to hiss at it like a feral vampire. A large figure is framed by the beaming sunlight that is flooding the room through a window that spans the entire wall. The figure is fussing with the curtains that he's just opened and I quickly recognise him as the stuck-up detective, Mr Collins. The events of the day come rushing back to me like a tidal wave of anger, fear and complete confusion.

“What did you do to me? How did we get here?” I demand, gesturing to the room and jumping to my feet.

“I don't have time to baby you through this, so here is the quick version,” he starts as he unbuttons his suit jacket and hangs it over the back of a large leather office chair. “My name is Deacon Collins, I am the headmaster of Grey’s Academy and you are the newest student here. Tell me, what do you know about your heritage?” he asks. My eyes are transfixed on his hands as he unbuttons the cuffs of his shirt and rolls up each sleeve to expose some impressive forearms. A throat clearing snaps me out of my trance.

“Oh… um,” I start, embarrassed at being caught staring. “Sorry, I'm a little lost here. I'm not feeling myself,” I say with a sigh and flop down onto the couch. I try to process what the he-ll is going on.

“Due to your circumstances, I am going to assume you know nothing. Here at Greys Academy, our students are gifted…” he begins.

“Wait, gifted?” I interrupt, “I think there's been a mistake. I'm not gifted, I got a pass in all my exams but nothing that makes me stand out,”

“If you'd let me finish Miss Banks…”

“Josie,” I correct, not liking the way he uses ‘Miss Banks’ in an inferior way.

“Miss Banks,” he reiterates, “If you would just keep quiet for two minutes and let me explain then you can be on your way. Our Academy is for what we call Greys. Greys are a race of superhumans. Whilst we are much more powerful than regular humans, we are also small in number. For this reason, we have created our own realm within the human one. This is safer for everyone to live in peace. Somehow, you have slipped through the net and grown up within the human realm. I will be launching a full investigation into how that came to pass, but for now, you are here and you are safe. Now I appreciate this is a lot for you to take in and you have a lot of catching up to do so I won't overwhelm you today. I will have my assistant assign you a dorm room and pair you with one of our more intellectual students to do extra studies with you outside of your regular lessons. I will also schedule some extra studies with our tutors here. Any questions?” he says without a flicker of a smile.

“Oh, you are good,” I laugh. “I love this show! I used to watch it all the time,” I say between bouts of laughter. I get up and start exploring the room to find the hidden cameras. I can't believe I'm on the prank show. I wonder who nominated me, it must have been Freya, my best friend from college. “Was it Freya that put you up to this?” I giggle.

“Miss Banks!” the actor playing Mr Collins shouts, slamming his hand down on the desk, which just makes me laugh harder. I approach him and examine the buttons on his shirt, one must be a hidden camera. Then I start rubbing my hands over his shirt, feeling for the hidden wires. In a flash his hands wrap around my wrists, making me gasp in shock as he grips them hard, stopping my exploration. I look up at him and his eyes are intense as they stare back at me. “What the he-ll are you doing?” he asks in an almost growl.

“Looking for your mic?” I gulp.

“I don't have a mic, this is not a prank. You are new here and you've had a lot to take in so this once I will give you a pass, but if you lay your hands on me ever again there will be punishment. Do you understand?” he says in a low, scary tone. His heavy breathing makes me bite my tongue because I really want to taunt him about what this punishment might be. As if he knows what I'm thinking his eyes seem to flash blue. That's when I remember them doing that earlier, right before he demanded that I sleep, a demand I was powerless to resist. Panic bubbles inside me at the realisation. He's telling the truth, isn't he?

“You made me go to sleep,” I say with a shaky breath. He gives me a single nod in response. “What else can you make me do?” I ask. Fear at how vulnerable I am right now pushes me to ask the question.

“Anything,” he says in a husky whisper, and I swear his face moves closer to mine. His answer doesn't scare me like it should, if anything it excites me. Then a door opens, breaking the trance he has me in, he drops my wrists and takes a step back as if I'm suddenly repulsive to him. I turn to see who the intruder is.

Chapter 4

“I thought I heard voices in here. Is everything okay Dee?” a very attractive woman who looks to be in her thirties says as she walks into the room with a beaming smile. Her hair is jet black and shines as the sunlight hits it. It's the sort of hair that should be in shampoo ads and just enhances her stunning blue eyes and flawless skin. She wears a skin-tight black dress that shows off her hourglass figure and black stilettos, with her finger and toenails painted bright red. She is the kind of woman that makes you feel insecure as soon as you see her.

“Yes. Clarrisa, this is Josie Banks, a new student I've just picked up from the human realm. Could you please assign her one of the single dorm rooms in Ruby,” Mr Collins says, whilst he takes out the file from his briefcase that the police officer had given him earlier and holds it out to Clarrisa.

“Are you sure? There's plenty of space for her in Amber or Saphire,” Clarrisa says, giving me an assessing look up and down before scrunching her nose a little.

“Put her in Ruby please and make sure she has everything she needs,” he says dismissively. Then he sits at his desk and opens up a laptop. I stand there unsure of what I’m supposed to do now. Mr Collins glances up at Clarrisa and then me. “That will be all,” he grunts.

“Of course Deacon, Josie follow me please,” Clarrisa smiles tightly.

“But…” I start.

“That will be all Miss Banks, Clarrisa will get you everything you need and someone will be along to your dorm shortly to answer all your questions and get you settled. Welcome to Greys Academy. I hope there will be no need for any more visits to my office,” Mr Collins says flatly and then turns his attention back to his laptop. With a sigh, I follow perfect Clarrisa.

We exit the office into a glass-lined corridor, Clarrisas heels click loudly on the cream marble floor. Everything feels too bright and shiny. I'd hate to be the cleaner here, there must be a whole army of cleaners to keep all the glass and marble clean. Clarrisa leads me to an elevator and I let an audible breath as I remember my last elevator ride before I was kidnapped by a hot, rude of a… wizard? Then I snort laugh as I think about what is happening. I'm in freaking Hogwarts, and that makes Mr Collins Professor Dumbledore. Clarrisa gives me a disapproving side-eye.

“Sorry, it's been a wild day,” I explain.

“I can imagine. Don't worry about Deacon, he was taking his morning shower when the call came in about you, he had to rush off without his morning coffee, he's grumpy without his coffee,” she laughs, a little too much for it to be real. My mind is suddenly filled with thoughts of Mr Collins in the shower, then I realise what she said. If she was there when he got the call, that means she was there when he was showering. She's his girlfriend… or wife. Of course, she is, she is beautiful and he is hot as he-ll, they are a perfect match. That explains why he jumped away from me like I was on fire, he didn't want his girlfriend to get the wrong idea. My heart sinks a little. I thought I'd felt some chemistry in our short encounter, but I guess it was a wro thought anyway. I'm his student now, and I don't know how things work here but I'm sure it's the same as it is in the human world. Students and teachers dating is a huge no. Why am I wasting time thinking about this when my life has just been completely obliterated?

“Wait!” I blurt. “I need to go back… my mum,” I manage to say through panicked breaths. How could I forget about my mum? Guilt floods me.

“Don't worry about any of that for now, time works differently here so no one will be missing you yet. Deacon will take care of everything, your mum will be just fine. I'm sure he will keep you updated on personal matters like that,” she smiles.

“Okay,” I nod. “What about my stuff? Can I go back for it?” I ask.

“Deacon will arrange for your belongings to get to you, try not to worry and just focus on making your new life here. I know this is a difficult time but I'm sure you will be happy here, we will work everything out to make this transition as easy as possible for you,” she says as we walk through a maze of glass and marble corridors. We exit the building into a courtyard with a huge fountain in the middle. The water comes out through four spouts. Above each spout is a large crystal. Clarrisa stops walking for a moment to let me look at it. “Each crystal represents a house at our Academy. You have been assigned to Ruby for the time being,” she motions to the red stone. “You can easily identify your fellow house students by the colour of their tie. Red for Ruby, green for Emerald, blue for Sapphire and yellow for Amber,” she explains as we walk on. I mentally roll my eyes at the thought of wearing a uniform again. I'm almost 19 years old and I feel like I'm going back to secondary school.

“Where are the other students?” I ask, taking note of how quiet it is.

“They are all in classes, they'll be finishing soon. We have just over 300 students here, it can get quite busy between classes,” she grimaces. Movement in the distance catches my eye and I can just make out a group of about thirty people. They're moving fast around each other as if dancing. As we get closer I realise they're fighting.

“Combat training,” Clarrisa comments, “they're our next squad of soldiers,” she adds proudly. I want to get a closer look but Clarrisa ushers me on and towards an old-looking stone building that's embellished with Rubies. “This is your building,” she says as we go through the door. I look around in awe. It's stunning. It's like an old castle inside but with everything you'd expect in a modern house. The large space has stone walls with thick red curtains around the huge windows. Then there are couches scattered around a large rug with a stone fireplace and real fire. There is a big flatscreen TV mounted to one of the walls with game consoles on the shelves underneath it. On each side of the room is a grand staircase that meets at the top. I follow Clarrisa up the stairs and down a hall, we pass two doors before she stops and hands me a key. “This one is yours, I'll give you some time to settle in and someone will be along shortly to show you around,” she smiles and walks away before I can even mutter a thank-you or get the door open.

Chapter 5

I stand in the doorway of my new room open-mouthed. This must be a mistake. This is nothing you'd expect of a dorm. This is more like a hotel suite. The bed is huge, king-size at least, and the pillows are like plush clouds that I just want to jump into. There is a dressing table with a mirror and a walk-in wardrobe that's almost as big as my entire dorm room at Mount University. The large window is framed by bookshelves, stacked with books of every genre you could wish for, and there's a cosy window seat with cushions and a blanket. I almost squeal in excitement. There's a small countertop with tea and coffee-making facilities and a mini fridge. In the bathroom, there's not only a shower but a full-size bathtub. The whole place is a luxury that I've only ever seen on TV and I have no idea how I am going to pay for it because I don't think a part-time job around my studies is going to cut it. I catch a glimpse of myself in the bathroom mirror and cringe. My hair is a mess, and I'm wearing a sleep shirt with shorts and my tatty Converse shoes that Officer Shelby had allowed me to put on before taking me to the station. I look completely out of place here. On the back of the bathroom door, I notice a bathrobe and there's a stack of towels and toiletries in the bathroom cupboard. It's not ideal but I could shower and change into the robe for the time being. I hope my belongings are brought to me soon because I'm going to be the laughingstock of the school if I have nothing but a bathrobe and sleepwear in my wardrobe. After a hot shower, I feel a million times better. I wrap myself in the luxury robe and head over to the bookshelves to check out the selection. Jumping into someone else’s crazy world sounds like a great distraction whilst I wait for someone to bring my things and introduce me to my new life. A book titled ‘Greys’ catches my eye and whilst it's not the fiction I was hoping for it looks like a good place to start learning about my new life. I climb into the window nook and start reading. I learned that Greys are a superhuman race that possess powers that include but are not limited to; super strength, manifestation, teleportation, shapeshifting, superior speed, compulsion, telepathy and telekinesis. I blow out a breath and close the book, already feeling overwhelmed and not sure if I can believe all this. Voices outside my window catch my attention and I lean closer to look down at the ground outside. There's a group of men heading towards my building, they push and shove each other playfully and as they get closer I notice how dirty and dishevelled they look. Maybe they were a part of the group that was combat training earlier. The men file into the door beneath my room and out of sight, except for one. From this angle, I can't see much of his features but he looks tall with a mess of blonde hair that's long on the top but shaved on the sides. He seems puzzled as he turns around and scans his surroundings, maybe he's looking for someone. I glance in the direction he's looking to see if I can see anyone he might be waiting for but there's no one else in sight. I look back at the man and gasp, jumping back from the window when I see him staring straight at me. I swear his eyes flashed blue like Mr Collins had right before he'd used his powers on me. Once I've composed myself I slowly edge back to the window, peeking over the sill to see if he's still there. I blow out a breath when I find the courtyard empty once again. A knock at my door makes me jump once again. Why am I so jumpy all of a sudden? Actually, that's a dumb question. I've literally been dragged from my life and dumped into a whole new realm, where the people have powers and can command me to do whatever they like. I need to keep my guard up and my wits about me if I'm going to survive in this place. I open the door expecting to see Mr Collins, Clarrisa or someone delivering my belongings, but the face that greets me is none of those. It's the blonde man I'd seen through my window.

“Well hello there new girl,” he grins at me with the most perfect white teeth.

“Hi,” I respond awkwardly, gripping the front of my robe to make sure I'm not flashing anything I don't want him to see. I hear footsteps coming down the corridor and the blonde man rushes into my room and closes the door behind him, almost knocking me over in the process.

“What the he-ll?” I demand, trying not to show any fear.

“Shh,” he says quietly, putting a finger to his mouth. I'm about to start shouting at him to get out when I hear voices on the other side of the door. When the voices seem to pass by the blonde chuckles. “Sorry, I wanted to talk to you before the rest of the guys find out you're here, I’m Theo Henry, your new neighbour,” he explains and holds out a hand to shake. I bite nervously on my lower mouth debating if I should trust this guy. “I don't bite,” he assures, obviously noticing my hesitation. I look into his eyes and see kindness there. Something deep inside me tells me I can trust him, that he's going to be an important part of my new life here.

“I'm Josie,” I finally say, taking his outstretched hand and shaking it. His eyes flash blue and his eyes go wide as a jolt of fear flows through me right before everything goes black.

Chapter 6

My vision returns as fast as it left. Theo is on the floor at my feet sounding.

“What was that?” I demand, stepping back from Theo and clutching my hand.

“The spark,” Theo gro-ans out, and then he starts laughing.

“What does…” I start, but I'm cut off by my door shattering into pieces. Making me shriek and jump back further. A very angry-looking man stands in my doorway, breathing heavily. He takes in the scene in front of him. Dark hair hangs over his eyes but it doesn't hide the fury peeking out behind the dark locks. His hand shoots out towards me and his fingers strain as if he is gripping something, then my oxygen is cut off. I scratch at my neck, trying to remove whatever is wrapped around it that's stopping me from breathing but there's nothing there.

“Mason stop, I'm fine,” Theo croaks out and pushes himself to his feet before knocking the dark-haired man's arm down. Precious air fills my lungs and I collapse to my knees in relief.

“Josie, are you okay?” Theo asks, knee-ling in front of me.

“Get… out!” I rasp between deep breaths.

“Let me get you checked over by a nurse,” Theo says softly, reaching out and touching my neck. His touch feels soothing but also hurts my tender skin. I smack his hand away.

“You heard the lady, get out Theo, and take that psycho with you!” a female voice calls. I look up to see a short, pixie-looking girl standing near my door, her hands are on her hips and she looks pissed.

“He didn't mean it, he thought she was hurting me,” Theo explains.

“She was hurting you!” Mason shouts.

“No, it was amazing. It was The Spark,” Theo exclaims excitedly. Pixie girl laughs in disbelief and Mason looks like someone just kil-led his kitten. His eyes land on me again and I swear I see murder there.

“Sure thing lover boy, everyone knows that's a myth. Go take your boyfriend and daydream elsewhere,” she dismisses. “And fix this door!” she adds coming to stand by my side.

“What’s The Spark?” I croak out.

“Forget about that for now, we are starting you with the basics, not myths,” she smiles, holding out her hand for me. I take it and let her pull me to my feet. “I’m Dorothy, but everyone calls me Dot. Mr Collins asked me to be your guide, tutor and bestie,” she announces with a salute. “Okay, you caught me, I lied about the besties part but we are going to be besties, I just feel it,” she almost squeals. I'm a little taken aback by her chirpy attitude and how fast she speaks, especially after just being attacked by the Damon Salvatore wannabe. I look over to my door and Theo and his murderous friend are nowhere to be seen, my door is also restored to its former glory, you'd never guess it had been shattered into a million pieces just moments before.

“My door,” I gasp.

“Mason fixed it, he's a grumpy, possessive guy but he's also fiercely protective and he's great to have around when things get broken, granted it's usually him breaking them, but nobody is perfect,” she says with a shrug.

“If I ask you something, will you be honest with me because I'm about ready to lose it,” I ask as I begin pacing my room.

“Shoo-t,” she chirps, flopping back onto my bed and examining her bright pink nails.

“Is this a mental hospital? Because my mum has psychosis so maybe it's hereditary. After everything that's happened today I'm starting to think I've actually gone insane and all this is a hallucination and I'm a patient here, not a student,” I blurt out.

“Nah, it's a school for Greys. Unless I'm hallucinating too… What if everyone here is having the same hallucination and we all think we are at school but really it's a hospital? And Mr Collins is our hot doctor trying to make us all sane again. That would be hilarious,” she says laughing hysterically. I stare at her wide-eyed until she composes herself.

“Is that possible?” I ask. Almost afraid of what her answer will be.

“Nah. But I do like the idea of Mr Collins being a doctor, I'm going to call him that from now on. Now get dressed, or we will miss dinner, and you don't want to see what happens when I miss dinner,” she smiles sweetly.

“I don't have any clothes,” I say with a grimace. Dot gives me a knowing smile and snaps her fingers.

“Tah-dah,” she grins, and motions to my wardrobe. With a frown, I open the doors and look in awe at the now fully stocked rails.

“How did you do this?” I ask in astonishment.

“Fine, you caught me in a lie again. It wasn't me. Mr Collins told me he had stocked your wardrobe. Girl, you must have made a good impression on him. I've never seen him be so kind,” she says coming to stand beside me and bumping her hi-p against mine.

“Kind?” I snort. “He was anything but kind,” he must have brought this in whilst I was showering. Thank god I didn't walk out without the robe whilst he was here.

“Mmmhmm,” she mocks and pushes past me. She grabs a pair of very short black shorts, a black vest top and a red oversized hoody with Greys Academy embellished on the front. Then she opens a drawer and picks out some underwear before throwing it all at me. “Get dressed, let's go” she makes a shooing motion at me.

I take the clothes into the bathroom and dress quickly. Everything fits perfectly and I wonder how Mr Collins knew my size, especially my underwear. I push the thought of him choosing underwear for me from my mind, not wanting that embarrassment to add to the shitstorm of a day. When I leave the bathroom Dot is holding out a brand-new pair of crisp white Converse, I shove my feet into them and follow Dot out the door, ready to explore my new world.

Chapter 7

We head out of our building and across the courtyard to a more modern brick building where students seem to be filtering from all directions. People stare at me and I see them turning to whisper to each other.

“Hey beautiful,” a deep voice says from behind us and I turn just in time to see Dot swept off of her feet by a tall man with a mess of shoulder-length blonde hair. Before she has a chance to respond, another male approaches. This one is shorter and has a military-style shaved head. He wraps his arms around her, pulling her from the blond man and planting a kiss on her lips. I stare open-mouthed at the scene in front of me, waiting for a fight to start or for Dot to protest, but it doesn't happen.

“Put me down,” Dot giggles and squirms in the man's arms until he releases her. She straightens her clothes and looks back at me. “Josie, this is Marcus,” she points to the blonde, “and this is Cole,” she pats the arm of the second man.

“Nice to meet you,” I smile awkwardly at Marcus before turning my attention to do the same to Cole.

“Where’s Joe and Max?” Dot asks the men who are now walking beside us.

“They came early to get us a table at the front,” Cole answers.

“Oh goody,” Dot claps her hands together in delight. “Tables at the front are first in line for seconds, “ she leans closer and whispers to me as we go into a large dining hall. I feel the eyes of all the students all lock onto me and my steps falter at the gravity of the situation I'm in. I feel like a fish that's been dumped into the shark tank as I recount the words in the book I’d read. These are all Greys, superhumans with powers that could do whatever they like to me and I'd be helpless to stop them. How am I going to survive here?

“Don't worry, they're just curious. It's not often we get new students, especially at our age. Most people here have grown up together,” Dot reassures, linking her arm in mine and guiding me to a large table. The room is not as impressive as I'd imagined. I was expecting Hogwarts and instead, this is a standard college dining hall.

“So this is your new pet?” a handsome black man with shocking blue eyes asks as he stands from the table and pulls Dot into his arms before kissing the top of her head.

“Yes, this is Josie. Josie, this is Joe,” Dot introduces. Joe flashes me a 1000-megawatt smile and holds out his hand to shake. I hesitate, remembering what had happened with Theo.

“Hi,” I do a small awkward wave instead and quickly avert my gaze.

“Babe, I got you a milkshake,” a cheeky-looking dark-haired man interrupts, handing Dot a bottle of strawberry milkshake.

“You know how to treat a girl,” Dot gushes, reaching up on her tiptoes to kiss his cheek, before turning back to me, “this is Maximus,” she grins at me.

“Max,” he corrects with an eye roll followed by a wink.

“I’m Josie,” I smile.

“And what did you get me, Max?” Cole asks, elbowing Max in the ribs playfully. All four men begin teasing each other and making jokes.

“Sorry, they can be a bit much, but I love them,” Dot says wistfully as she watches the men scuffle. “Let's get some food,” she adds, leading me towards a large food counter. She hands me a tray and a plate and takes one for herself before she starts loading food onto it. The food is laid out under hot counters in a self-serve-style buffet. I take a slice of cheese pizza and some fries as we move along the counter.

“So which one are you dating?” I ask, glancing over to the four men who are now seated at the table.

“All of them,” she grins at me.

“What?” I gasp. “How did you pull that off?” I add with a giggle. I take an apple and a bottle of juice and follow Dot back to the table.

“It is how we do things here, take a good look around you,” she laughs. I take a seat beside her and the men get up to get their food. Looking around at the other students I notice distinct groups of one female with up to five men at each table.

“Our population is small and females are rare, so mate bonds are formed. It is usually four men to every woman, but sometimes it's three or five men,” she explains.

“And the men don't get jealous or fight?” I ask, finding all this hard to believe.

“Sometimes at first, but they work it out. Our bonds are not ours to choose. There are a couple of our kind that have the gift of sight, they can detect soulmates and match them together. When a female turns 18 the soul-seer guides her to her bonds,”

“And does anyone get a choice in all this?” I struggle to keep the distaste from my voice. This feels dirty and like exploitation.

“Of course they do, some resist the bonds, but they almost always give in eventually. It's not easy to ignore your soulmate,” she shrugs. I scan the room again. Everyone looks happy in their groups. Then my eyes land on a table at the back. There are only males at that table, and every single one of them is staring right at me.

“Who are they?” I whisper to Dot.

“Those are the unbonded, declared to have no living soulmate within the realm and resigned to a solitary life. You've just given them all a second chance,” she says excitedly. My heart skips a beat when my eyes lock with Mason’s, dread fills me when I see the devil in his eyes as he stares back at me with that murderous look once again.

1jj90cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandalsResorts/comments/1jj90cd/st_lucia_grande_1st_experience/,St Lucia Grande 1st Experience,"I just did st lucia grande and was not impressed. The costs seem astronomical. The “all inclusive” is far from all inclusive if you put any thought into what you’re paying for. It’s $1000+ a day for a couple and that essentially pays for food room and drinks. Almost nothing else is included with that. If you want to do anything else they will charge you for every little thing possible. Spent $400 on a 60 min couples massage, already a HIGH price. Then even before we are leaving the massage room they are trying to sell us salt rubs and lotions and what not. Also, the food across the entire resort is unimpressive quality. Some of the reservation restaurants are decent but by no means are blow away quality. All of the milk at the resort for instance is likely powdered milk, the coffee is of the lowest quality. Want to sit outside under any semblance of respectable shade? Oh, go see our paid reservations desk. It feels like a public traded company is running an all inclusive resort and is cutting every corner possible and squeeze every dime out of me at every opportunity. Oh wait, they are. 

The unlimited drinks are made with generally the cheapest ingredients, premade syrups and such. Let’s not mention charging by the garment for laundry. The pina colada I got today for example was just from a standard freeze machine and some cheap rum floating ontop, not mixed in. Similar to the absolute bare minimum to make a pina colada. 

Additionally, the other major pool of this resort is out of service. I’m not sure for how long it has been, but the pool is green and half filled. It’s unsightly.

I Wanted to do a single load of laundry and found it would cost $50-100 and I couldn’t even do it myself. I thought this was an all inclusive experience? Instead they charge you by the individual garment piece.  

I’m writing all of this from the price perspective. If I was paying half the price I think all of this would be pretty expected. I’ve been on many cruises and a few different resorts of different brands in Mexico and the Caribbean. And while they were half the price of my stay here at sandals, they seemed to provide a very comparable experience. A few resorts in the Yucatán come to mind that was $7k for a week for a family of 4 with particularly better food and drink quality. 

There also seems to be a trend here of service being forgotten. Our first night at dinner it took 30mins to get our drinks at dinner on a light traffic night. 

Not to mention being down on the beach, approached by sales people. I went of a sunset walk on the beach and was followed by a drug dealer trying to sell you whatever you’ll buy from him. In 10 mins on the beach we were approached by 2 different people trying to sell us excursions and drugs. It’s not what I expect for a $1k/day price, ontop of the $200-300 more you spend on all the other stuff they want to sell you while you’re here. Nonetheless our relaxing sunset walk on the beach as newly weds was more of a I hope that drug dealer over there stops talking to us. 

Don’t get me wrong, the resort is pleasant and quiet and the service is quite good at times, not at others. 

I’m just overall disappointed I felt as though I paid a premium for an all inclusive experience and instead a corporation has plastered on “all exclusive” to the absolute legal bare minimum to call it such.",0,1742869325.0,SandalsResorts,4,0.36,False

1jj8yen,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1jj8yen/biohacks_for_an_adhder_quitting_smoking/,Biohacks for an ADHDer Quitting Smoking,"As the title suggests, I have ADHD and I’m trying to quit smoking & vaping. I have tried multiple times and haven’t lasted more than a month. I’ve tried every tip and trick you can think of; hypnosis meditations, mindfulness, replacing the habit with other healthy habits, CBT/DBT, reading the Easy Way by Allen Carr, nicotine patches, gum, the works. I’m frustrated as I can’t seem to overcome the intense cravings for it; it helps me to focus, break out of fatigue or brain fog, be productive, manage stress & anxiety, and feel grounded. It manages my ADHD symptoms extremely well, better than medication ever did. I’ve been on 6 different medications for ADHD, and they either made my symptoms worse, or they would relieve my ADHD symptoms but came with a horrible host of side effects. My psychiatrist & GP recommended I don’t take meds anymore because of the side effects and my family’s health history, and to try to find other methods to manage it. 

So for symptom management I reach for a few things. I now use coffee, cacao, Yerba mate, and tobacco/nicotine as quick easy fixes. I also take a few supplements/vitamins: Omegas, methylated b vitamin complex with l-theanine, creatine with amino acids, collagen powder. I do drink a cup of loose leaf tea mixed I made myself almost every day; it usually has lemon balm, holy basil, and calendula. 

Lately, I’ve been trying to slowly cut down on my usage rather than going cold turkey; I’ve gone from 20mg/mL nicotine to 3mg/mL of nic in my vape, and I have been taking small hits of herbs mixed with tobacco in my bong rather than smoking a whole cig. I have been able to quit smoking weed daily and I only use it maybe every 2 to 3 months and was easy, but quitting nicotine/tobacco has been really difficult for me in comparison. I worry that if I cut it out, I’ll just go back to it again for the millionth time. 

If anyone has any suggestions for me to biohack the cravings, help me quit for good, and help with my ADHD symptoms so I don’t feel so dependent on nicotine & caffeine to get by, I would deeply appreciate it! ",2,1742869159.0,Biohackers,9,0.75,False

1jj8wda,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_thedreadedhour/comments/1jj8wda/i_know_someone_who_died_a_college_true_crime/,I Know Someone Who Died - A College True Crime Horror Story,"Here's something I've already put on my YouTube channel and I wanted to share the transcript for those who like to read:



This happened during my second year of college when I was living in the dorms. Our room was set up like this: a living room/common area, a kitchenette, a full bathroom, and two bedrooms. I shared one room with Melanie—Mel for short—while Nikki and Hannah shared the other. Mel and Nikki were freshmen, totally skipping that cramped “freshman dorm” vibe where you’re stuck in a tiny box with one person and a bunch of other newbies. Hannah and I were sophomores. We all got along great and did almost everything together—hit the dining hall, flirted with the boys next door, went to a ton of parties. Everything except classes.



Here’s the rundown on us. Mel was the flirtiest, hands down. She’d broken up with her boyfriend right before college, so she was on a mission—always scouting parties for us. Nikki was her opposite—shy, had a hard time talking to people, but she was the prettiest out of us. Weird how that works, huh? Hannah had a boyfriend, Arman, who didn’t go here. He was the controlling type—didn’t want her doing anything. We’d be out at some party, and she’d get a call from him cussing her out, telling her to get back to the dorm, saying, “I’m coming to pick you up.” Yeah, she’d end up bailing on most stuff we did. Me? I was normal, I guess—a solid 8. White girl, brunette hair, hazel eyes, freckles, and really good at beer pong.



Hannah was pretty too, but she wasn’t the best girlfriend. She didn’t throw herself at every guy, but when she crossed boundaries, she crossed them. Remember how I said we hung out with the boys across the hall? Yeah, Hannah slept with one of them—Bobby. They kept it low-key, but us girls knew. She’d sneak off, say she was grabbing a snack from the campus coffee shop, but we all knew she was next door doing dirty things with Bobby. Anyway, here’s where it gets good.



Fast forward to October. Bobby and his friend Josh, who’d just rushed Sigma Nu, invited us to one of their frat parties. They were newbies, so they pitched this “dope” idea that we should go with them to keep a 2-to-1 ratio. Sounds like us girls got the short end of the stick, right? Yeah, we knew, but we were planning to get fucked up anyway, so who cares? Oh, by then, Bobby and Hannah had stopped hooking up. They were just friends—or so we thought.



We got to the party and talked to a mess of people. It was a neon lights party—dress code was to wear white, and they painted our whole bodies when we walked in. Mel was glowing green and purple, flirting with some guy by the keg. Nikki had pink streaks on her cheeks, giggling with a dude who wouldn’t shut up about his pledge stunts. Girls were sluts, guys were dogs—that’s exactly how it went down. We drank, got shitfaced, but I was still coherent. I knew what was happening. A few hours in, the dance floor heated up. I saw Hannah grinding on Bobby, Mel and Nikki with some guys, and yeah, I was with a couple dudes too.



But this is when I think it happened. Hannah left a little past 11 p.m. and let us know. She waved quick, but her smile was tight—like she knew Arman was pissed already. I told her to text us when she got home safe and walked her outside. That’s when I saw Arman’s black Nissan Altima—those ugly 20-inch painted rims sticking out, hints of silver showing where the paint was peeling off. Ugly. They drove off, and we figured they’d be cuddling back at the dorms eventually. They’d argue and yell, then have make-up sex, then cuddle.



Except that’s not what happened. We called one of our guy friends to pick us up, and when he dropped us off, there were three cop cars at the entrance of our building. We freaked out, ran up to an officer, and asked what was going on. He said they were responding to gunshots but wouldn’t let us in or tell us where it happened. One cop muttered about “a mess upstairs,” and my stomach dropped. We started calling Hannah—no answer. Nothing. We kept trying, but we never heard from her again.



To be honest, we were kind of still fucked up, so we were saying obnoxious things. We told the officer we lived in room 308, and he said we had to call our parents and go home. Later, we found out Hannah died that night. We were never told the gory details, but it was rumored there were more than 15 gunshots. We’re not entirely sure what happened to Arman.



A detective contacted us, and I told them everything—how we were at the party, how Hannah left early with Arman, her boyfriend. I said he was abusive, that he’s the one they should be looking for. I’m not 100% sure if they ever found him. Nikki, Mel, and I moved out of the dorms a week after. We picked up our stuff from the police station, and that was it.



I still think about that night when I let Hannah leave. Nothing like this had ever happened during all the times they’d argued. I keep hearing myself say “text us,” like that was enough. I always wonder what would’ve happened if we’d just told her to stay with us—if we’d dragged her back inside, laughing, instead of letting her walk out to him.

Hey there! I’m 33 and from Michigan. I'm looking to meet someone fun, engaging, and down to earth. Someone who enjoys great conversation, laughter, and good company. I’m 5’10” with green eyes and an athletic build. My job has flexible hours, so I can accommodate most schedules. I love being outdoors...hiking, kayaking, and camping are my go to activities. In the winter, I’m all about coffee, books, and binge-worthy TV. I’m laid back, sarcastic, and always up for a good laugh, but I also appreciate meaningful conversations. I don’t smoke, I drink socially, and I’m open to any age, race, or body style because, for me, attraction is all about connection. I’m open to seeing where things go, whether it’s just great conversation, hanging out, or something deeper. No pressure, no drama just something enjoyable and real.

Hii there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s tgats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup akso no fake tan or  fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!
