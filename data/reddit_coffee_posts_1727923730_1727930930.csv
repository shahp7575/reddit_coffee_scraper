So my RG-35xx I’ve had for almost a year. I left it on a coffee table and my very curious cat decided it needed to be on the floor. Now my screen is broken, I think too much so that I won’t be able to fix it. My question is, is there an easy way to fix this, or which one would have a more durable screen/back light for a drop of 2 feet? Don’t worry I’ll be getting a case for storage for my next one and keeping my cat far away from it lol. 

If it helps for new one, I don’t care about DS games. I mainly like GBA games and NES/SNES. I just found out about more possibilities with these like the Android OS and being able to play later games, I would think the latest I would potentially play maybe GC or N64 though but haven’t looked into those.

In the past naging dahilan ng break up namin yung paninigaw nya at pag babato ng gamit sa sahig dahil natrigger sya sa convo namin night before my bday. Eventually we got back together at nasabi ko sa kanyang pag naulit pa uli yung paninigaw at panduduro nya hindi ko na yun itotolerate. Naghiwalay kami dahil sa anger issues nya pero sabi nya babawi daw sya kaya nanliligaw uli. 

Dahil sa nature ng work ko before at sa mga personal reasons sometimes kapag nag hyper focus ako sa isang bagay wala na ko naririnig sa paligid ko. 

Fast forward 1 year later nagpunta kami sa starbucks para mag coffee. After drinking coffee sabi nya gusto nya mag poop sa cr ng SB kaso maraming tao. Sabi ko sa kanya, antay tayo onti. Few minutes later less busy na si sb so he got the chance to go sa cr. Lowbatt phone ko at no data. so I borrowed his phone to play Piano Tiles. Few minutes later, habang nasa mabilis na kong part ng game he came back at nag aaya na umalis sa sb. 

I said ""wait lang, tapusin ko lang to."" 
Inulit nya, ""tara na alis na tayo"". 
 
I wanna complete a certain level kaya focused parin ako, kaya sabi ko ""wait"". 

Inulit nya ""tara na nga"" this time iritable na. Medyo confused na ko bakit sya iritable so sabi ko ""pindutin mo nga yung lock button (habang naglalaro pa) para ma-pause yung game. (Inaabot ko sa kanya phone while smiling)"" no response.
  
I looked up to see na galit na sya. I turned off the game and said ""bakit?"", 
he said angrily ""kanina pa ko nag aaya umalis dito inuuna mo pa yang laro mo!!"" sabay walk out sa sb while I follow along. Sobrang confused na ko kasi normal lang naman samin mag-game sa phone while waiting for the other person. At nag aantayan talaga kami para tapusin yung nilalaro namin. Di rin tumagal ng 1 minute yung interaction namin bago sya mag walk out. 

I asked uli, ""ano meron?"", he replied pagalit ""sabi ko tara na ayaw mo pang tumayo. kanina pa ko aya ng aya napapahiya na ko dun"". 

Sobrang confused ako at that time, which resulted sa pagka-inis at nag translate yun sa muka ko. In my mind, ""bakit galit na galit ka na dahil di ako tumayo agad?"". Kita nya sa muka ko na nakakunot noo ko habang nakasunod lang ako sa kanya and he said ""tara na uwi na tayo"". We weren't talking on our way home. 

Pag baba ng tricycle at pag pasok namin ng bahay, that's where he went off. 
""KANINA PA KO AYA NG AYA SAYO UMALIS DI KA TUMATAYO INUUNA MO PA YANG TANGINANG LARO NA YAN"" 
""Di mo alam hiyang hiya ako dun?!?!?! GUSTONG GUSTO MO KO NAPAPAHIYA NO""  
At this point mas lalo na kong nainis. Kasi bakit ka galit na galit kasi di ako tumayo agad? Sa 3 years natin ngayon lang naging big deal to. Sabi ko ng mahinahon ""ano problema mo? Dahil di ako tumayo agad??"" Pero iritable itsura ko. 

""Baka mas galit ka pa nyan sakin ha? INIINVALIDATE MO FEELINGS KO?""
Me: ""ano nga problema?""
""SERYOSO KA DI MO ALAM? HIYANG HIYA AKO DUN. WALA KANG PAKIELAM.""
""KANINA PA KO NAG SASABI TARA NA TARA NA. GINAWA MO KONG TANGA DUN. ANTAY AKO NG ANTAY""

Di na ko nag salita. I was trembling. Di ko alam sa galit ba, confusion, or ewan. Nasa corner lang kami, yung mga dogs ko nakatago sa likod ko, takot. Rinig ng buong compound yung paninigaw. Tumigil sya sa paninigaw at umakyat. 

Nag chat na ko sa mom ko na uuwi na ko para iexpect nya ko. 

Umakyat ako sa kwarto kung san sya nag pahinga. Nag log out ako ng accounts ko sa phone nya. Sabi ko sa kanya:

Me: ""Sorry di ako tumayo agad. Di ko alam bat ka galit na galit dahil dun pero humihingi ako ng pasensya sa actions ko."" 
Ex: ""Seryoso ka di mo alam dahilan?""
Me: ""hindi ko alam bakit ka galit na galit kasi di ako tumayo agad pero sorry""

Natawa sya, side smirk, scoffed. ""Nag cr ako sa SB. Walang bidet. Ang baho ng tae ko dun. Pag labas ko cr may dalawang taong nakapila. Hiyang hiya ako. Inaaya kita umalis ayaw mo tumayo. Laro ka ng laro.""

Atp ako yung meme na ""???"". I said ""di mo sinabi yan sakin?"" Sabi nya ""Kasi di ka nakikinig"".  I took my bag, he asked me san ako pupunta. Sabi ko uuwi na ko. Bago ako bumaba sabi ko in my trembling voice 

""pasensya ka na, hindi ko alam na yan pala yung dahilan mo. wala akong narinig na yan pala yung dahilan—"" 
""kasi inuuna mo yang laro kesa saki—""
""believe me, kung nalaman kong yan pala dahilan ako pa naunang umalis sa SB. Hinding hindi ko sasadyain na magstay para mapahiya ka lalo."" 

Desidido na ko umuwi. Nung pababa na ko sabi nya ""wag ka na umuwi okay na ko. maghahabulan pa ba tayo?"" I insisted na uuwi na ko kahit anong mangyari. Pinipilit nya kong wag na umuwi pero buo na loob ko. He even said ""sorry nanigaw ako. wag ka na umuwi."" Pero I left. 

Nung nakauwi na ko he called me so many times pero di ako sumagot. Few hours later nag long message sya sakin na titigil na daw sya sa panliligaw sakin at madami daw syang narerealize. Kaya sorry daw sa unfulfilled promises. 1 month later no contact parin ako and he never resolved things with me. Lately sya rin lumalabas na victim sa family & friends nya.

1fuzplz,https://www.reddit.com/r/retailhell/comments/1fuzplz/wheres_the_hot_water/,"""Where's the hot water?""","This is a question I get asked at my store all the time. I work third shift at a gas station along the interstate. Our ""coffee area"" as we call it, has everything you'd need for hot drinks or food. And we have it set up so simple for people so they'd know where everything is. 

For context, this is how we have it set up. We have a counter dedicated solely to drinks and hot water. On the very left of the counter is the slurpee machine. Next to it is the cappuccino machine, then there's the 6 coffee pots. Then on the very right of that counter is our Franke machine. If you're familiar with them, they're those instant coffee machines that have 3 coffee bean containers on the top and have a touchscreen you can use. These machines also allow customers to get hot water in case they want to make soup. We also offer a microwave for customers as well. 

Anyways, you'd think customers wouldn't have a hard time finding the Franke machine for their hot water needs. But it seems they do.. Every single night, I get 1 - 3 customers who ask me that infamous question.. ""Where's the hot water?""

I don't usually mind this question. It can be a little tricky finding it if the Franke's screen isn't swiped to the hot water display. So I usually answer these customers like this.

""You're gonna want the machine on the very right of the counter, next to our coffee pots. It's the counter with the coffees and cappuccino machine. Just swipe left on the screen and you'll see hot water.""

Is this explanation enough for them? Not at all. They'll stand there and stare at the counter aimlessly, like a lost puppy. Then after staring for a moment, they look at me and say ""I don't see it..""

Of course, I need to try and explain it better to them. So I start to actually point at the Franke machine and tell them ""It's the machine on the very right of the counter. Has the screen on it and the blue light.""

Is this enough for them? Hell no! For some reason, as if they never learned the difference between right and left, they start to GRAVITATE TOWARDS THE LEFT OF THE COUNTER TOWARDS THE CAPPUCCINO MACHINE. 

I have to step in and say ""No, it's on the RIGHT of the counter. The RIGHT."" On a very rare instance, this is enough, but majority of the time, it isn't. They'll either continue to gravitate towards the cappuccino machine, or they'll touch one of the coffee pots and look at me with that dumb face.. 

9 times out of 10, I need to drop everything I'm doing at my register, whether that be tending to a customer, making a money drop in the safe, or organizing the register area, just to walk over to that damn Franke machine and PHYSICALLY TOUCH it in order for them to understand that ""Hey! There's actually a machine here besides the coffee pots and the cappuccino machine!"" 

You'd think it stops there, but no. Of course it doesn't. They can't figure out how a touchscreen works. They stare at the screen, which says at the very bottom ""swipe left for hot water."" Either I explain to them to swipe left on the screen and they start either pressing the coffee options, or they start swiping RIGHT.. So of course I need to show them how a touchscreen works..

What the hell is wrong with people? How have some of these specimens make it this far in life without knowing how a touchscreen works.. Without knowing what the difference between left and right is.. Without understanding a very detailed answer to their question.. They're obviously not completely braindead considering they're traveling the turnpike and understand road signs...

When she and I first started dating 2 years ago, she was kind of lazy. She did work a 9-5 job, but it was a pretty simple and easy job. I know that because that's where we met. That's about all she did. She worked and slept. She would go to sleep by 1AM and 4 days out of the week she'd start her shift at 9AM. She'd go home and repeat the process until the weekend, where she'd sleep until 3PM-5PM and then just hang out in bed. Every single week this was her schedule. This was a bit of a problem, because the area in which we live snows heavily 6-8 months out of the year. At the beginning of our relationship, she was living with her parents who never pushed her to do anything, and didn't care what she did. I moved from my hometown in with my parents for about 5 months so I could get back on my feet in the new area. She would come over and stay with me 3-5 nights a week every week in the winter season. Where my parents' house is gets VERY heavy snow and requires relatively constant maintenance from morning 'til late evening. My parents and I would get up early in the morning and plow the driveway, take turns shoveling, putting on chains, and repeat in the evening. Mind you, this is JUST so you're able to leave the house. She would be in bed while all of us are busting our balls. I expressed my frustration about how it seemed as if she was taking advantage of me and my parents. While we're outside sweating in the middle of winter completely bundled up, she'd be in the warm house drinking coffee watching TikTok. This never changed, so my parents didn't allow her to stay for more than 2 nights out of the week because they felt it was unfair to them, which I totally understood.

We have since moved into our own apartment and have been here for little over a year. Things were changing (kind of). She was lightly doing things around the house (after I begged her for help for months), did most of the cooking, and would help me on cleaning days 2 days out of the month. Recently this last month, she has started staying up until 4-5AM most nights/mornings, and then wakes up for work at about 8:30AM, works until 5PM and then comes home and IMMEDIATELY gets in bed until she falls asleep. She'll then wake up anywhere from 9PM-11PM and repeat the process. I have explained to her how bad this is for her sleep schedule, I have encouraged her to start setting alarms for 1.5 hours TOPS, and I have expressed how concerned I am for her mental and physical health. No matter what, nothing changes. She does not care. This is beginning to affect me. I have started going to bed by 1AM at the LATEST. I'm constantly woken up and disrupted by her showering, turning on the TV, watching YouTube videos, turning on the lights and/or using the kitchen. Mind you, we're in a small 1 bed, 1 bath apartment. Again, I expressed my feelings and my concerns about her habits and nothing is changing. I've encouraged her to start going to the gym with me. I have encouraged her to go on walks with me. I encourage her to go on hikes with me on the weekends, which she says she wants to do, but she won't even wake herself up at a time in which we could still go.

Lastly, she has deeply hated her job pretty much since she started it, and blames all of this on hating the state in which we live and hating her job. She works 36-38 hours a week making $16/hr and constantly complains about how broke we are and how ""little time"" she has. She has very basic adult responsibilities and it crushes her. She has just recently started looking for a new job, but every job she's ever had, she's either been fired from, she hates or she gets burned out after 6 months. I want her to feel accomplished and I want her to feel empowered, loved and supported but she doesn't really have any drive or dedication. I sometimes feel like I'm dating a girl, when I want to date a woman.

What are things I can say? She wants to change her situation, but won't do the things it takes to do so. I want to empower her to want the best for herself. How can I, as her partner, encourage her to be a better version of herself and grow past these childish habits?",1,1727929534.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

https://preview.redd.it/pm44p8eojgsd1.jpg?width=901&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a68382c5469432c177b2a0243d1a6bffb4230186

It has 1-shot and 2-shot preset buttons, which I never use. There's also a milk steamer, but the wand feels too short and the steam is sputtery. Fortunately it has a manual start/stop button, which is enough to make espresso according to weight.

The first few months resulted in many bad shots and wasted coffee. 🤮 It took a while, but these past few weeks I've settled on a workflow that generally results in pleasant coffee:

Accessories used:

* Commandante X25 grinder
* 51mm bottomless portafilter with 2-shot basket
* 51mm dosing funnel
* WDT tool
* 51mm self-leveling tamper
* 51mm paper filters
* 51mm puck screen

The workflow:

1. Dose 14-16.5g, grind size 7-9 clicks depending on the beans
2. Paper filter at the bottom of the basket, plop the ground beans, agitate with WDT tool, tamp, another paper filter on top, and finally drop the puck screen.
3. Target yield is 1:2 ratio, slightly higher/lower depending on the beans or how I felt about yesterday's coffee.
4. Timer starts at the first drop, and stops when I reach the target yield. I'm satisfied if it's anywhere around 30-40 seconds.

The paper filter sandwich has been a HUGE help! As long as the beans are good, this gives me yummy espresso that I can enjoy straight out of the cup. It also yields mostly consistent results. Sometimes I have a lopsided puck, and I will see that as soon as the extraction emerges underneath the basket, but the output is still usually delicious.

So here's my question. Because I'm currently happy with this workflow and the espresso it makes. Are there flavors or qualities of espresso that I can only unlock by getting a better machine?",0,1727929463.0,espresso,0,0.5,False

It’s been one year since I start having gastritis symptoms.
My baby was born and spent 3 weeks on icu - due that I made a promise that if she was to be out of icu healthy and good I would stop eating chocolate for 1y ( that’s what I used to love the most ) - my baby is healthy and good so I kept my promise.
Once I could go back to chocolates a year ago - I started having diarrhoea on and off - soon after a strong pain in my stomach 2 min after eating , I did a endoscopy and it’s chronic moderate gastritis with no specific cause ( biopsy was made and nothing ) - I was on ppi for 2 months but did nothing , this whole year was pain for me that’s my only symptom.
I’ve noticed that when my pain it’s at the worst I have had diarrhoea too - my doctor wants to do a colonoscopy but it costs 2k - my sister has Chrons Disease and he now insists that I also have it even my inflammation mark being 8 ( higher than 5 which is the norm but not super high).
For me , coffee , chocolate and sugar are the triggers - I stopped drinking coffee and helped a lot , chocolate I don’t even touch anymore , just replaced to carob bars and it’s amazing for me.

**WAITAH for not believing my ex was faithful due to fake evidence?** 

**Originally posted to r/AITAH** 

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!accusations of infidelity, invasion of privacy!< 

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/0biJZOdFCc)  **Sept 11, 2024** 

So I broke up with my ex some years ago, and it was because I believed she was cheating with her ex. 

There was just too much ""evidence"" 

Her ex sent me screenshots of them sexting, including nudes. The screenshots were dated for some weeks ago (from that day). 

When I confronted my ex about this she denied it, but I demanded to see her phone, and yep, they were there. Also, yes, we had been officially together by then. My gf swore up and down she had no idea those messages where there. 

Those dates were around the time my gf was staying out, and I remember my gf not responding to my texts those days, and when I asked her what was going on, she said ""It's none of your fucking business, I don't need to tell you where I am all the time"" 

Our relationship was rough during that time. 

So with the texts and how rough our relationship was, I figured she was lying and broke up with her. 

Fast forward, and her little brother, who is a troubled young man, called me. He's doing some sort of program where he is taking responsibility for a lot of hurt he caused. 

He admitted he planted those messages because he hated me, and he liked my ex's ex more, and wanted them back together. 

I reached out to my ex to apologize. Her brother told me he already spoke with her about this. 

She hasn't responded to me yet, I don't know if she ever will, but that's fine. 

Was I the asshole for this? I feel guilty for not believing her, but seeing those messages felt too real for me. I didn't even think they could have been faked. 

**RELEVANT COMMENTS** 

**JoffreeBaratheon** 

>NTA. If she has crazy people in her life trying to sabotage her relationships, that's still on her, not you. Also why are you assuming little brother is even telling the truth? Either multiple people conspired together to set this break up evidence up, which sounds farfetched, or little brother is full of shit and its a manipulative ploy from them to just try to stick it to you and/or clean up ex's image. 

**OOP** 

>>I mean, I knew he hated me back then. He wasn't subtle about it. He was also just a kid back then. He was 15. 

>>It's been about 8 years since. And he seemed genuine. 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/ktVNSWZ9zS)  **Sept 26, 2024** 

First [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/8mgeMx653l) 

My ex reached back out. 

She said her brother had already talked about this to her. She's furious at her brother right now. 

We chatted for a while, catching up and stuff. She has a kid now, but is single. Part of me wanted to ask her out, another part was hoping for her to ask me out. But with all the baggage we have now, it's hard to tell. 

In the end, we did actually meet for coffee. We are both very different people now, so idk if we would even be a good match. 

She said she forgives me for not believing her, and she said that if she had seen messages like that on my phone, she would have done the same. 

I'm not really hoping for anything here, but it's been nice to reconnect with her at least.

My symptoms have changed in the last 2 months since all these habit + medication differences.

I started because I work out 6 days a week and my weight hasn’t budged at all. I have been really nervous about keto flu because I have a physically demanding job and I don’t want to be miserable during the day so I haven’t done any cardio, only lifting since I started (I get cardio at work too tbh). I have had weight gain issues in the past. 

A normal day of eating so far is 3 eggs in butter with uncured sugar free bacon for breakfast, some steak and either shrimp or salmon for one meal, black coffee before work and I’m usually pretty hungry during/after work so another meal would be ground beef and or the steak/seafood. If I need something in between boiled eggs and if I’m feeling snacky pork rinds. 

I haven’t had any symptoms at all other than being thirsty and peeing a ton. My gut is regular, I’m not crazy hungry, my head doesn’t hurt I feel fine. And I stepped on the scale today and have gained 1.7 lbs. I’m trying not to be discouraged! Any fixes I can add to this to get that weight loss going? 

Edit to add I’m taking electrolytes,  fiber gummies (no sugar or carbs in those) and I’m still taking my greens powder because like I said in the beginning, my job can be really active and I’m afraid of being too sick. ",2,1727927587.0,carnivorediet,2,1.0,False

1fuyzkp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1fuyzkp/im_so_conflicted/,I'm so conflicted,"There's a long story that I can share if people want but I'll just give the quick version.

I ended up typing far more than expected as usual. If you want to read it all, that's great. I honestly don't care. Here's the short of it: I like a girl but I can't decide if she likes me or not. We've kinda been on two dates but they were never clarified as such. I asked her to a picnic and a movie but she seemed like she really was interested, but busy this weekend. I got a rain check. Now I really want to confess but I can't find a good time or place. Texting would definitely be easier, but she isn't a fan of texting. So now I don't know what to do. 

I have a crush on a girl and ask her to coffee. She accepts then asks if I want to go grocery shopping with her after we were done. I was confused but also kinda excited cause I thought it could mean she liked me. 

Later I text her and she ends up saying we should cook or bake together next time. This also excited me. So we baked cookies and banana bread together.

Over time she's made multiple comments that make me think she likes me and multiple that make me think otherwise. 

A lot of people I know are telling me almost certainly that she likes me by what I told them. So after too many people trying to convince me, I'm finally starting to think she likes me.

Its just weird. She doesn't really behave how I would expect if she liked me. I was standing with her and a mutual friend earlier and she seemed just completely disinterested in me. She still laughed at jokes and continued conversations like just normal people. Which I thought was odd since the couple times it was just the two of us (also outside of school) she was much different. Very energetic, almost a constant smile, and we could keep talking for hours. So I don't get why when we aren't hanging out, she seems to treat me like kind of a friend. Someone you talk to but don't really care if they're there or not.

Anyway, so I texted her earlier asking if she wanted to go on a picnic and watch a movie. I thought this would be something that was just outright seen as a date. Coffee and baking could be friends, sure. But combine those then with a picnic and a movie, I figure it's obvious.

Anyway, I planned to confess during the picnic. Or at least try to. After I asked, she said ""that honestly sounds like so much fun but I'm completely booked this weekend"" I replied ""okay, that's fine! Rain check?"" her again ""rain check"". 

So I mean I guess that went well? I'm just disappointed now cause I was really counting on telling her at the picnic. The soonest we could do it would be next weekend, but I don't even know if she'll be free. 

I want to confess sooner than later because it's taking a serious strain on me mentally cause I have horrible anxiety and this just keeps making my brain go between her liking me and not, constantly. 

I would like to confess in private, or at least something more private than school near friends. Just cause it's something personal. But the only time that would be, is at the picnic (or any other kind of date). 

I could text her, but that feels kinda wrong. She doesn't like texting all too much as is. It would surely be a lot easier for me then. And she could have time to process if she needs. I'm just not sure it's the best idea. 

So that's what I need help with. When and how do I confess? ",1,1727927155.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

I am NOT:
A “lifestyle coach”
A “manosphere influencer”
An expert on this topic

But I AM:
Providing my perspective based off of my life experiences in hopes of helping men of my generation.

This post comes as a response to the hundreds of posts on this subreddit (many from incels as trying to radicalize us) bringing up the “male loneliness crisis” and how too many young men seem to live solitary lives.
And it is true that men are feeling higher rates of loneliness than say 10 or 20 years ago. But what I do not agree with is who and what we are blaming for it. I will list some proposed causes of this crisis from this subreddit and say my thoughts about them.

The “third space” and their disappearance:
This one interests me because I’m fascinated with urban planning and how cities are designed and used. Basically a third space is any place aside from work or home (the first and second spaces) that can be used to hang out and socialize. Think of parks, coffee shops, city plazas and similar types of areas. While I do believe that the decrease of these spaces is a factor in the decrease of socialization I do also have a counter example from personal experience. I live on a college campus with all of these things within walking distance. They are accessible by public transport and all that. But I still hear stories of roommates that never leave their rooms or talk to anybody, so that means that cannot be the only factor.

Online dating and how women’s standards are “too high”:
I think that men these days put too much effort towards getting into a romantic/sexual relationship. They believe that their self worth is determined by their relationship status and feel awful about themselves when they’re not in one. Why do you think that men outnumber women on dating apps? It’s because women have realized that they don’t have to be in a relationship, they can find self worth in other things. Also, women tend to be pickier on dating apps because they have more to choose from.

Finally, what I do believe is responsible for the high rates of loneliness in men is well… men. Too many men would rather play video games late into the night than leave their room and meet people in real life. Too many men would rather watch porn than find a partner that loves them. And it’s because of fear. And the cause of that fear is uncertainty. And men feel this uncertainty because they lack the support groups (friends, trusted peers) that tell them that their feelings are okay. And why do you think that men don’t have these support groups? Because they would rather stay inside all day and do the things previously stated. Resulting in a positive feedback loop of misery.

So, in order to break this cycle, we must first take accountability for the situation we put ourselves through. Then we find our own support groups. I’m not certain if what I propose would work, but I do believe that it is a step in the right direction.",0,1727927037.0,GenZ,6,0.29,False

Ananya, my neighbor, was a 31-year-old woman, beautiful but with loneliness in her eyes. Every evening, she would walk around the park with her young son, Samarth. Her husband worked abroad. She seemed alone, burdened by the responsibilities of raising a child and managing the household all on her own.

One day, while playing with Samarth at the park, I struck up a conversation with her. At first, it was casual talk about the weather, work, and the struggles of raising a toddler. But soon enough, I found excuses to linger longer. I’d brush against her hand while handing her Samarth’s toys, and each time, I felt a spark I couldn’t ignore.

Our friendship grew naturally from there. After a few days of chatting at the park, we exchanged numbers, and that opened up a new world of communication between us. At first, it was just forwarded WhatsApp jokes & memes. But as days turned into weeks, our conversations deepened. We started chatting late at night, sharing stories about our lives. Slowly, Ananya began to open up to me, revealing the loneliness she felt in her husband’s absence. The time zone difference made it hard for them to talk regularly, and she admitted that sometimes it felt like she was raising Samarth all alone.

She confessed one night. “I don’t have anyone to talk to. Everyone assumes I’m okay just because I keep myself busy, but sometimes I just want someone to ask how I’m really doing.”

I made sure to be there for her, offering her emotional support, always responding quickly to her messages, offering a sympathetic ear when she needed to vent. I liked making her smile, knowing that I was one of the few people who could make her forget her struggles.

But beneath the surface of this growing friendship, there was an undeniable tension. With every late-night chat, that tension grew.

One night, Ananya asked me.

“Rohan, why are you always online so late? Don’t you have a girlfriend or something?”

Her question surprised me. “No,” I replied, “Just friends. And honestly, I haven’t found anyone as mature and cute as you.”

There was a brief silence before she replied.

“Really?” she asked, a hint of surprise in her voice.

“Yeah,” I continued, “You’re someone who understands. I haven’t met anyone who makes me feel the way you do. It’s not just about the late-night chats; it’s about how you make me feel like I’m a part of your life.”

Ananya didn’t reply immediately. I could almost sense her processing my words, the silence between us filled with unspoken emotions. When she finally responded, her message was softer.

“I didn’t realize you felt that way. I guess we’ve become quite good friends”

“We have,” I answered. “And it’s more than I expected. I care about you, Ananya.”

There was a pause again, and then she sent a message that was both reassuring and revealing.

“I care about you too, Rohan. It’s nice to have someone who listens and understands. But things are complicated for me right now.”

I knew she was referring to her situation with her husband and the challenges she faced. I wanted to offer support without pushing her boundaries.

“I understand,” I said. “I’m here for you, no matter what.”

Ananya seemed to appreciate my response. We continued chatting late into the night and it had become a cherished part of our routine.

One day, Ananya asked me for help. “Rohan,” she said, “Samarth's birthday is coming up, and I wanted to buy his birthday dress. Would you be able to drive us to the mall and help us out?”

I was thrilled at the chance to spend some more time with her and gladly agreed. We decided on a weekend for the outing. On the chosen day, I picked up Ananya and Samarth from their place, and we headed to the mall.

We spent the afternoon browsing through various stores, chatting and laughing as we searched for the perfect birthday dress for Samarth. Ananya’s eyes lit up with excitement as she found a cute outfit that she knew Samarth would love. It was heartwarming to see her so happy and engaged, and I enjoyed every moment of our time together.

As we continued to explore the mall, I noticed Ananya glancing at the clothing sections with a hint of hesitation. I saw an opportunity to have a little fun and suggested, “Why don’t you try on some clothes for yourself too? ”

Ananya looked at me, slightly taken aback. “I’ve been so focused on Samarth’s needs. I haven’t really thought about shopping for myself.”

I insisted, “Come on, it’ll be fun. You deserve it.”

We made our way to the women’s clothing section. As Ananya began browsing through tops and T-shirts. I decided to intervene and gently steered her towards the saree section.

“Hey, Ananya, why don’t you try on one of these sarees?” I suggested with a grin.

She stopped and looked at me in surprise. “A saree? When did you see me in a saree? ”

I couldn’t resist a playful response. “Let’s just say I’m a good stalker of social media profiles,” I said with a wink and a mischievous smile.

Ananya’s eyes widened in disbelief, but she couldn’t help but laugh. “so someone is closing looking at my old pics? ;)”

I shrugged with a chuckle. “Just paying attention. Plus, I think you’d look amazing in a saree.”

She considered my suggestion for a moment and then decided to give it a try. I waited outside the fitting room, eagerly anticipating the reveal. When she stepped out, wearing a beautiful black saree that accentuated her grace, elegance, and curves, my heart skipped a beat.

“You look stunning,” I said sincerely.

Ananya looked at herself in the mirror and smiled, though she seemed to hesitate. “It does look lovely, but I think I’ll buy it some other time.”

I understood her reluctance and didn’t press further. “Alright, but keep it in mind for the future. It suits you perfectly.”

We finished up our shopping and headed back home.

As the day of Samarth's birthday approached, Ananya was busy in preparations. I rang the doorbell of her house, and she answered with a look of surprise.

“Rohan? What are you doing here at this hour?” she asked surprisingly.

I gave her a warm smile and said, “I took the day off from work to help you out with the birthday party preparations. I thought it would be nice to assist you and make sure everything goes smoothly.”

Her eyes widened with appreciation, and I saw a hint of tears in them. “You really didn’t have to do that,” she said, her voice a mix of gratitude and emotion.

We both felt a deeper connection as we began to work together.  I suggested, “How about you handle the food preparations, and I’ll take care of decorating the room? That way, we can divide the tasks and get everything ready more efficiently.”

Ananya nodded in agreement, her smile widening. “Good idea, Rohan. I really appreciate your help.”

As she worked in the kitchen, preparing delicious treats for the party, she occasionally came out to check on the decorations. With a warm smile, she would offer me a taste of her dishes. “Here, try this,” she said, handing me a small sample. “Tell me what you think.”

I savored the flavors, nodding in approval. “This is too tasty, Ananya.”

Throughout the preparations, I kept asking her for suggestions on the decoration, making sure that our conversations went deeper and more meaningful.  It felt as though we were sharing pieces of ourselves, building a connection that went beyond mere friendship.

Once I had finished with the decorations, I headed home to get ready for the party. After a quick change, I returned to Ananya’s place, feeling a mix of excitement and anticipation.

When I arrived, the house was bustling with energy, and the party was in full swing. Samarth’s laughter filled the air, and the atmosphere was vibrant with joy and celebration. I was greeted by Ananya’s grateful smile as she saw me walk in.

“Thanks for coming back,” she said, her eyes reflecting the happiness of the day. “Everything looks fantastic.”

I smiled back, feeling a deep sense of satisfaction. “I’m glad I could help. It’s been a great day, and seeing Samarth so happy makes it all worthwhile.”

As the party came to end and guests started to leave. I turned to Ananya with a determined look. “Why don’t I stay a bit longer and help you clean up?” I offered.

Ananya looked at me with a touch of concern. “Oh, Rohan, you’ve already done so much today. You don’t have to stay.”

I shook my head with a reassuring smile. “It’s no trouble at all. Tomorrow is Saturday, and I don’t have to go to the office. I can stick around and help you finish up.”

Her expression softened, and she seemed relieved. “Well, if you insist,” she said with a grateful smile. “I’ll put Samarth to sleep quickly, and then I’ll join you.”

She headed towards Samarth’s room, and I set to work. I moved around the house, collecting garbage, putting used utensils into the sink, and storing leftover food in the refrigerator. I moved efficiently, making sure everything was tidied up and in order.

When Ananya returned after almost 45 minutes, she was taken aback by how much I had managed to accomplish. The hall was nearly spotless, and the kitchen was well on its way to being cleaned.

“Oh my gosh, Rohan,” she said, her voice filled with astonishment.

I shrugged with a grin. “Just wanted to make sure you didn’t have to do all the work yourself. ”

Her eyes welled up with tears as she looked around at the clean space. “Kaise mujhe tum mil gaye,” she said, her voice breaking slightly, referring to Ghajini movie song.

""Kismat pe aaye na yakeen"", I replied with a smile.

Without thinking, she pulled me into a hug. It was a casual, grateful and thanking embrace

“Thank you so much, Rohan,” she whispered. “I don’t think I would have managed without your help.”

I returned her hug, feeling a strong sense of fulfillment. “You don’t have to thank me. Friendship mai no thanks & sorry.”

As she pulled away, the tears in her eyes were mingled with a smile. The bond between us had grown even stronger through the day’s events, and as we finished the remaining tasks together. The moments of support had cemented our relationship in a way that went beyond friendship.

After we finished tidying up, I turned to Ananya with a playful smile. “You know, since I’ve done all this work, I think I deserve a return gift,” I said, half-jokingly.

Ananya looked at me with a raised eyebrow, amusement dancing in her eyes. “Oh really? Tell me, what you want ?”

I shrugged, trying to look as serious as I could. “Well, I was thinking if you could treat me with some more sandwiches. They tasted amazing. Also, I am thinking if you could pair them with a nice cold coffee”

Ananya chuckled, a warm and genuine laugh. “You really know how to make an evening special. I’d be happy to make us some sandwiches & cold coffee.”

“Great,” I said. “I’ll set up the table, and you can handle the kitchen.”

As Ananya went to prepare for us, I set up a small table in the dining area. I made sure the atmosphere was cozy, with a couple of candles flickering softly. The aroma of the freshly baked sandwiches filled the room, adding to the homely feel.

When Ananya returned with the food, we sat down together, and I could see the gratitude and affection in her eyes. The conversation flowed easily as we enjoyed the sandwiches and coffee, sharing stories and laughter.

“This is perfect,” Ananya said, taking a sip of her cold coffee. “Thank you for making this evening so special.”

“I’m glad you think so,” I replied. 

As we finished our late-night snack and our conversation turned to more personal topics, I decided it was time for one final surprise. I reached into my bag and pulled out a neatly wrapped gift.

Ananya looked at it with curiosity. “What’s this?” she asked, her eyes reflecting a mix of surprise and confusion.

“Just a little something,” I said with a smile. “I wanted to give you a gift to show how much I appreciate everything.”

I handed her the package, and she unwrapped it carefully. Her eyes widened as she revealed the black saree that she had tried on at the mall.

“Oh my gosh, Rohan,” she said, her voice filled with disbelief. “This is the saree I tried on the other day. I didn’t expect this.”

I nodded, feeling a sense of warmth at her reaction. “I remember how much you liked it, and I thought it would be a lovely way to show my appreciation for everything you’ve done and for the connection we share. You deserve it.”

Ananya looked at the saree, her eyes welling up with tears. “I can’t accept this. It’s too much.”

I reached out and gently placed a hand on her shoulder. “You’re my good friend, Ananya. It’s not too much. You’ve been there for me, and I wanted to do something special for you. Please accept it.”

She hesitated for a moment, then took a deep breath. “Thank you, Rohan. This means a lot to me. I really didn’t expect anything like this.”
As we sat together, enjoying the evening, I couldn’t resist one last playful suggestion. “You know,” I said with a mischievous grin, “I think you should try on the saree now. It would be amazing to see how it looks on you.”

Ananya’s eyes sparkled with amusement. “Alright, I’ll give it a go,” she said, heading towards the bedroom to change.

When she emerged, my breath caught in my throat. The saree draped around her gracefully, accentuating her elegance and beauty. My eyes widened, and I couldn’t help but let out a soft whistle of admiration.

“You look absolutely breathtaking,” I said, my voice filled with genuine awe.

Ananya smiled, a touch of shyness in her demeanor. “Is there anything missing?” she asked, twirling slightly to show off the saree.

I took a deep breath, mustering all my courage. “Actually, yes,” I replied, stepping closer to her. With a gentle touch, I reached up and loosened the bun that held her hair in place, letting it cascade down her back.

“There,” I said softly, “you look even more beautiful with your hair open.”

The moment felt charged. We both sensed that this was a pivotal moment, a point where the boundary between friendship and something more was about to be crossed. The attraction that had been building between us was undeniable, and as we gazed into each other’s eyes, it was clear that we both wanted this.

Our faces drew closer, and without a word, our lips met in a tender, romantic kiss. It was a kiss filled with longing and passion, a culmination of the emotions that had been simmering between us. My hands moved to her back, feeling the warmth of her skin through the fabric, while her fingers wove through my hair.

The kiss deepened, and we lost ourselves in the moment, knowing full well that this was crossing a line. But the emotions we had been holding back could no longer be contained. We wanted this, and the intensity of our feelings was too strong to ignore.

As we finally pulled away, our breaths mingling, I knew that this moment had changed everything. It was a turning point.

After that first kiss, Ananya and I kissed again, this time with even more passion. Her fingers tangled in my hair, pulling me closer. My hands roamed over her back and waist, feeling the warmth of her skin through the fabric of her saree.

Ananya shivered as my hands traced her body, my touch both gentle and firm. She held onto me, fingers weaving through my hair, savoring the way I held her. Our kisses were deep and urgent, making everything else fade into the background.

My hands traveled slowly, savoring the curve of her hips and the softness of her skin. Her breathing grew shallow and quick, pressing herself into me, feeling the intensity of our bond. The soft rustle of her saree against my fingers heightened the intimacy, every touch sending shivers through her body.

Then, I gently pushed Ananya against the wall. The cool surface made her shiver, and she quickly wrapped her arms around me, pulling me closer. Her heart raced, the contrast between the cold wall behind her and the heat of our body overwhelming her senses.

Every touch sent chills down her spine, making her breath quicken. She closed her eyes, feeling the warmth of my lips against her cool skin. My soft breathing near her ear, combined with the light pressure of my lips, made her lose herself in the moment.

""You look so sexy Ananya !!"", I said.

"" Then show me how much you want me, Rohan !!"" She replied with a naughtiness in her eyes.

Ananya felt cherished and desired in every possible way. She couldn’t remember the last time she had felt like this—so completely wanted and treasured.

Unable to handle the overwhelming pleasure, tenderness, and emotions coursing through her, Ananya turned around, her soft moans escaping as she whispered my name. Her back now faced me, and the anticipation in the air grew thicker.

Gently, I placed my lips against the curve of her neck, feeling the warmth of her skin under my touch. I kissed her slowly, savoring every inch of her as I trailed my lips down to her shoulder.


""Aaaaaahhhhhh Rohaannn.... Ohhhhh Fuckkkkk !!"" She moaned.

My hands moved from her shoulders, gliding down the length of her body until they found her waist. The delicate fabric of her saree barely shielded the soft curve of her skin beneath. 



Slowly, I slid my fingers across her stomach, feeling the warmth of her skin as I traced the outline of her waist. My hand lingered at her navel, teasing the sensitive skin there with gentle, circular motions.



She shivered at my touch, her body pressing back against mine as I rubbed my fingers gently around her bellybutton.



My lips continued their slow journey down the curve of Ananya’s back, tasting the warmth of her skin with every kiss. Her breathing grew unsteady, her body trembling slightly under my touch. I kissed the soft line of her spine, trailing my lips lower with each delicate movement.




Unable to bear the overwhelming pleasure any longer, Ananya turned to face me, her eyes clouded with desire. Without a moment’s hesitation, I gently moved the edge of her saree aside, revealing the smooth skin of her stomach. 



The sight of her navel, so perfectly inviting, drew me in. I leaned down, pressing a tender kiss just above it, feeling her shiver at my touch.



She moaned my name, ""Ohhhh Shhhitttt...Rohan...""




I lingered there, savoring the moment. My lips caressed her waist, kissing the soft skin around her belly. With slow, deliberate movements, I let my tongue gently trace the edge of her bellybutton, feeling her body quiver under my attention.

I licked the sensitive area, teasing her, as she gasped in response, her hands gripping my hair tighter.

Her soft moans filled the air, every sound an expression of the pleasure she was feeling. I kissed her again and again, making her feel cherished, adored. The taste of her skin, the heat of the moment—it was intoxicating. I wanted to show her, with every touch, how deeply she was loved, how much I desired her.

Each kiss, each soft lick against her bellybutton made her body respond in ways that words could never capture. Ananya’s moans grew more urgent, her fingers tugging gently at my hair, pulling me closer, as if she couldn’t get enough of the intensity between us.

long story short is anyone on this med that is having success? or any recommendations? still struggling and just trying to finish college :( my dr is far away and tired of hearing they don’t know why i’m still so tired and in pain. i know stress can really affect chrons but kind of inevitable being in my senior year and just trying to push thru. looking for any suggestions or words or advice !!!

1fuysf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheatingconfessions/comments/1fuysf6/unspoken_desires/,Unspoken Desires ,"It all started in March 2018. I was 26 at the time, living in Noida, and used to come home from work everyday around 6:30 PM.

Ananya, my neighbor, was a 31-year-old woman, beautiful but with loneliness in her eyes. Every evening, she would walk around the park with her young son, Samarth. Her husband worked abroad. She seemed alone, burdened by the responsibilities of raising a child and managing the household all on her own.

One day, while playing with Samarth at the park, I struck up a conversation with her. At first, it was casual talk about the weather, work, and the struggles of raising a toddler. But soon enough, I found excuses to linger longer. I’d brush against her hand while handing her Samarth’s toys, and each time, I felt a spark I couldn’t ignore.

Our friendship grew naturally from there. After a few days of chatting at the park, we exchanged numbers, and that opened up a new world of communication between us. At first, it was just forwarded WhatsApp jokes & memes. But as days turned into weeks, our conversations deepened. We started chatting late at night, sharing stories about our lives. Slowly, Ananya began to open up to me, revealing the loneliness she felt in her husband’s absence. The time zone difference made it hard for them to talk regularly, and she admitted that sometimes it felt like she was raising Samarth all alone.

She confessed one night. “I don’t have anyone to talk to. Everyone assumes I’m okay just because I keep myself busy, but sometimes I just want someone to ask how I’m really doing.”

I made sure to be there for her, offering her emotional support, always responding quickly to her messages, offering a sympathetic ear when she needed to vent. I liked making her smile, knowing that I was one of the few people who could make her forget her struggles.

But beneath the surface of this growing friendship, there was an undeniable tension. With every late-night chat, that tension grew.

One night, Ananya asked me.

“Rohan, why are you always online so late? Don’t you have a girlfriend or something?”

Her question surprised me. “No,” I replied, “Just friends. And honestly, I haven’t found anyone as mature and cute as you.”

There was a brief silence before she replied.

“Really?” she asked, a hint of surprise in her voice.

“Yeah,” I continued, “You’re someone who understands. I haven’t met anyone who makes me feel the way you do. It’s not just about the late-night chats; it’s about how you make me feel like I’m a part of your life.”

Ananya didn’t reply immediately. I could almost sense her processing my words, the silence between us filled with unspoken emotions. When she finally responded, her message was softer.

“I didn’t realize you felt that way. I guess we’ve become quite good friends”

“We have,” I answered. “And it’s more than I expected. I care about you, Ananya.”

There was a pause again, and then she sent a message that was both reassuring and revealing.

“I care about you too, Rohan. It’s nice to have someone who listens and understands. But things are complicated for me right now.”

I knew she was referring to her situation with her husband and the challenges she faced. I wanted to offer support without pushing her boundaries.

“I understand,” I said. “I’m here for you, no matter what.”

Ananya seemed to appreciate my response. We continued chatting late into the night and it had become a cherished part of our routine.

One day, Ananya asked me for help. “Rohan,” she said, “Samarth's birthday is coming up, and I wanted to buy his birthday dress. Would you be able to drive us to the mall and help us out?”

I was thrilled at the chance to spend some more time with her and gladly agreed. We decided on a weekend for the outing. On the chosen day, I picked up Ananya and Samarth from their place, and we headed to the mall.

I insisted, “Come on, it’ll be fun. You deserve it.”

We made our way to the women’s clothing section. As Ananya began browsing through tops and T-shirts. I decided to intervene and gently steered her towards the saree section.

“Hey, Ananya, why don’t you try on one of these sarees?” I suggested with a grin.

We finished up our shopping and headed back home.

As the day of Samarth's birthday approached, Ananya was busy in preparations. I rang the doorbell of her house, and she answered with a look of surprise.

“Rohan? What are you doing here at this hour?” she asked surprisingly.

I gave her a warm smile and said, “I took the day off from work to help you out with the birthday party preparations. I thought it would be nice to assist you and make sure everything goes smoothly.”

Her eyes widened with appreciation, and I saw a hint of tears in them. “You really didn’t have to do that,” she said, her voice a mix of gratitude and emotion.

We both felt a deeper connection as we began to work together.  I suggested, “How about you handle the food preparations, and I’ll take care of decorating the room? That way, we can divide the tasks and get everything ready more efficiently.”

Ananya nodded in agreement, her smile widening. “Good idea, Rohan. I really appreciate your help.”

As she worked in the kitchen, preparing delicious treats for the party, she occasionally came out to check on the decorations. With a warm smile, she would offer me a taste of her dishes. “Here, try this,” she said, handing me a small sample. “Tell me what you think.”

I savored the flavors, nodding in approval. “This is too tasty, Ananya.”

Throughout the preparations, I kept asking her for suggestions on the decoration, making sure that our conversations went deeper and more meaningful.  It felt as though we were sharing pieces of ourselves, building a connection that went beyond mere friendship.

Once I had finished with the decorations, I headed home to get ready for the party. After a quick change, I returned to Ananya’s place, feeling a mix of excitement and anticipation.

When I arrived, the house was bustling with energy, and the party was in full swing. Samarth’s laughter filled the air, and the atmosphere was vibrant with joy and celebration. I was greeted by Ananya’s grateful smile as she saw me walk in.

“Thanks for coming back,” she said, her eyes reflecting the happiness of the day. “Everything looks fantastic.”

I smiled back, feeling a deep sense of satisfaction. “I’m glad I could help. It’s been a great day, and seeing Samarth so happy makes it all worthwhile.”

As the party came to end and guests started to leave. I turned to Ananya with a determined look. “Why don’t I stay a bit longer and help you clean up?” I offered.

Ananya looked at me with a touch of concern. “Oh, Rohan, you’ve already done so much today. You don’t have to stay.”

I shook my head with a reassuring smile. “It’s no trouble at all. Tomorrow is Saturday, and I don’t have to go to the office. I can stick around and help you finish up.”

Her expression softened, and she seemed relieved. “Well, if you insist,” she said with a grateful smile. “I’ll put Samarth to sleep quickly, and then I’ll join you.”

She headed towards Samarth’s room, and I set to work. I moved around the house, collecting garbage, putting used utensils into the sink, and storing leftover food in the refrigerator. I moved efficiently, making sure everything was tidied up and in order.

When Ananya returned after almost 45 minutes, she was taken aback by how much I had managed to accomplish. The hall was nearly spotless, and the kitchen was well on its way to being cleaned.

“Oh my gosh, Rohan,” she said, her voice filled with astonishment.

I shrugged with a grin. “Just wanted to make sure you didn’t have to do all the work yourself. ”

Her eyes welled up with tears as she looked around at the clean space. “Kaise mujhe tum mil gaye,” she said, her voice breaking slightly, referring to Ghajini movie song.

""Kismat pe aaye na yakeen"", I replied with a smile.

Without thinking, she pulled me into a hug. It was a casual, grateful and thanking embrace

“Thank you so much, Rohan,” she whispered. “I don’t think I would have managed without your help.”

I returned her hug, feeling a strong sense of fulfillment. “You don’t have to thank me. Friendship mai no thanks & sorry.”

As she pulled away, the tears in her eyes were mingled with a smile. The bond between us had grown even stronger through the day’s events, and as we finished the remaining tasks together. The moments of support had cemented our relationship in a way that went beyond friendship.

After we finished tidying up, I turned to Ananya with a playful smile. “You know, since I’ve done all this work, I think I deserve a return gift,” I said, half-jokingly.

Ananya looked at me with a raised eyebrow, amusement dancing in her eyes. “Oh really? Tell me, what you want ?”

I shrugged, trying to look as serious as I could. “Well, I was thinking if you could treat me with some more sandwiches. They tasted amazing. Also, I am thinking if you could pair them with a nice cold coffee”

Ananya chuckled, a warm and genuine laugh. “You really know how to make an evening special. I’d be happy to make us some sandwiches & cold coffee.”

“Great,” I said. “I’ll set up the table, and you can handle the kitchen.”

As Ananya went to prepare for us, I set up a small table in the dining area. I made sure the atmosphere was cozy, with a couple of candles flickering softly. The aroma of the freshly baked sandwiches filled the room, adding to the homely feel.

When Ananya returned with the food, we sat down together, and I could see the gratitude and affection in her eyes. The conversation flowed easily as we enjoyed the sandwiches and coffee, sharing stories and laughter.

“This is perfect,” Ananya said, taking a sip of her cold coffee. “Thank you for making this evening so special.”

“I’m glad you think so,” I replied. 

As we finished our late-night snack and our conversation turned to more personal topics, I decided it was time for one final surprise. I reached into my bag and pulled out a neatly wrapped gift.

Ananya looked at it with curiosity. “What’s this?” she asked, her eyes reflecting a mix of surprise and confusion.

“Just a little something,” I said with a smile. “I wanted to give you a gift to show how much I appreciate everything.”

I handed her the package, and she unwrapped it carefully. Her eyes widened as she revealed the black saree that she had tried on at the mall.

“Oh my gosh, Rohan,” she said, her voice filled with disbelief. “This is the saree I tried on the other day. I didn’t expect this.”

I nodded, feeling a sense of warmth at her reaction. “I remember how much you liked it, and I thought it would be a lovely way to show my appreciation for everything you’ve done and for the connection we share. You deserve it.”

Ananya looked at the saree, her eyes welling up with tears. “I can’t accept this. It’s too much.”

I reached out and gently placed a hand on her shoulder. “You’re my good friend, Ananya. It’s not too much. You’ve been there for me, and I wanted to do something special for you. Please accept it.”

She hesitated for a moment, then took a deep breath. “Thank you, Rohan. This means a lot to me. I really didn’t expect anything like this.”
As we sat together, enjoying the evening, I couldn’t resist one last playful suggestion. “You know,” I said with a mischievous grin, “I think you should try on the saree now. It would be amazing to see how it looks on you.”

Ananya’s eyes sparkled with amusement. “Alright, I’ll give it a go,” she said, heading towards the bedroom to change.

When she emerged, my breath caught in my throat. The saree draped around her gracefully, accentuating her elegance and beauty. My eyes widened, and I couldn’t help but let out a soft whistle of admiration.

“You look absolutely breathtaking,” I said, my voice filled with genuine awe.

Ananya smiled, a touch of shyness in her demeanor. “Is there anything missing?” she asked, twirling slightly to show off the saree.

I took a deep breath, mustering all my courage. “Actually, yes,” I replied, stepping closer to her. With a gentle touch, I reached up and loosened the bun that held her hair in place, letting it cascade down her back.

“There,” I said softly, “you look even more beautiful with your hair open.”

The moment felt charged. We both sensed that this was a pivotal moment, a point where the boundary between friendship and something more was about to be crossed. The attraction that had been building between us was undeniable, and as we gazed into each other’s eyes, it was clear that we both wanted this.

Our faces drew closer, and without a word, our lips met in a tender, romantic kiss. It was a kiss filled with longing and passion, a culmination of the emotions that had been simmering between us. My hands moved to her back, feeling the warmth of her skin through the fabric, while her fingers wove through my hair.

The kiss deepened, and we lost ourselves in the moment, knowing full well that this was crossing a line. But the emotions we had been holding back could no longer be contained. We wanted this, and the intensity of our feelings was too strong to ignore.

As we finally pulled away, our breaths mingling, I knew that this moment had changed everything. It was a turning point.

After that first kiss, Ananya and I kissed again, this time with even more passion. Her fingers tangled in my hair, pulling me closer. My hands roamed over her back and waist, feeling the warmth of her skin through the fabric of her saree.

Ananya shivered as my hands traced her body, my touch both gentle and firm. She held onto me, fingers weaving through my hair, savoring the way I held her. Our kisses were deep and urgent, making everything else fade into the background.

My hands traveled slowly, savoring the curve of her hips and the softness of her skin. Her breathing grew shallow and quick, pressing herself into me, feeling the intensity of our bond. The soft rustle of her saree against my fingers heightened the intimacy, every touch sending shivers through her body.

Then, I gently pushed Ananya against the wall. The cool surface made her shiver, and she quickly wrapped her arms around me, pulling me closer. Her heart raced, the contrast between the cold wall behind her and the heat of our body overwhelming her senses.

Every touch sent chills down her spine, making her breath quicken. She closed her eyes, feeling the warmth of my lips against her cool skin. My soft breathing near her ear, combined with the light pressure of my lips, made her lose herself in the moment.

""You look so sexy Ananya !!"", I said.

"" Then show me how much you want me, Rohan !!"" She replied with a naughtiness in her eyes.

Ananya felt cherished and desired in every possible way. She couldn’t remember the last time she had felt like this—so completely wanted and treasured.

Unable to handle the overwhelming pleasure, tenderness, and emotions coursing through her, Ananya turned around, her soft moans escaping as she whispered my name. Her back now faced me, and the anticipation in the air grew thicker.

Gently, I placed my lips against the curve of her neck, feeling the warmth of her skin under my touch. I kissed her slowly, savoring every inch of her as I trailed my lips down to her shoulder.


""Aaaaaahhhhhh Rohaannn.... Ohhhhh Fuckkkkk !!"" She moaned.

My hands moved from her shoulders, gliding down the length of her body until they found her waist. The delicate fabric of her saree barely shielded the soft curve of her skin beneath. 



Slowly, I slid my fingers across her stomach, feeling the warmth of her skin as I traced the outline of her waist. My hand lingered at her navel, teasing the sensitive skin there with gentle, circular motions.



She shivered at my touch, her body pressing back against mine as I rubbed my fingers gently around her bellybutton.



My lips continued their slow journey down the curve of Ananya’s back, tasting the warmth of her skin with every kiss. Her breathing grew unsteady, her body trembling slightly under my touch. I kissed the soft line of her spine, trailing my lips lower with each delicate movement.




Unable to bear the overwhelming pleasure any longer, Ananya turned to face me, her eyes clouded with desire. Without a moment’s hesitation, I gently moved the edge of her saree aside, revealing the smooth skin of her stomach. 



The sight of her navel, so perfectly inviting, drew me in. I leaned down, pressing a tender kiss just above it, feeling her shiver at my touch.



She moaned my name, ""Ohhhh Shhhitttt...Rohan...""




I lingered there, savoring the moment. My lips caressed her waist, kissing the soft skin around her belly. With slow, deliberate movements, I let my tongue gently trace the edge of her bellybutton, feeling her body quiver under my attention.

I licked the sensitive area, teasing her, as she gasped in response, her hands gripping my hair tighter.

Her soft moans filled the air, every sound an expression of the pleasure she was feeling. I kissed her again and again, making her feel cherished, adored. The taste of her skin, the heat of the moment—it was intoxicating. I wanted to show her, with every touch, how deeply she was loved, how much I desired her.

Each kiss, each soft lick against her bellybutton made her body respond in ways that words could never capture. Ananya’s moans grew more urgent, her fingers tugging gently at my hair, pulling me closer, as if she couldn’t get enough of the intensity between us.

This is her third visit since I've lived here for a while, and I've taken her to all the main ""touristy"" spots like the Empire State Building or the Met. 

She likes broadway so I'm taking her to Wicked. She likes horror films, cooking, excercising, cocktails, coffee, facials, and shopping on a budget. Like she will devour a TJ Maxx but will refuse to set foot in a Tiffany's. 

She dislikes massages, full-on spa days, museums, wine bars, and dives. 

She adores a mom and pop establishment, but I don't know any good ones in Manhattan, and she's only in for three days so I don't want to spend an hour going into queens. Her favorites are Indian and Thai.

1fuyqhx,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1fuyqhx/i_had_a_really_odd_experience_a_few_weeks_back/,I had a really odd experience a few weeks back with a delivery and I didn’t really process it all until now. ,"So a few weeks ago I was at my work office, I was having a bad morning, so I ordered coffee and a breakfast sandwich from my favorite local coffee place for delivery. I usually avoid doing this as much as possible because I work in one of those corporate america maze areas where it’s just office building after office building and it all looks the same. Deliveries always have a hard time getting there. 

Anyway, my food got picked up pretty quickly, so I was pleasantly surprised. I usually head down downstairs and stand outside when they’re about 2 minutes out just in case they can’t find the building. I put in the instructions to let me know when they’re close. 

So my dasher texts me about 2 minutes out saying  they’re almost here so I head downstairs and wait outside. I don’t see anyone coming. To paint a picture, my office building is basically in the back of this huge parking lot that holds like 5-6 other office buildings. I check my app and I see that my dasher is stopped in the right parking lot, but is like 2 buildings away, which is a very honest mistake. I call them, and they… decline my call? I keep calling them and then she answers and sounds very on edge and upset, saying she’s sorry but her phone isn’t working and she can’t find me. I was like, “what?? just drive back a little more, you’re almost here” and then she hung up on me!!! I’m trying to keep an eye out for her car which was a white SUV but I didn’t see one. The next few minutes was spent with me blowing up her phone, blowing up door dash support who of course won’t help me, until finally she answers. At this point I’ve been standing down there for 15 minutes. 

She starts apologizing profusely and said that her phone was glitching out because she spilled water on it the night before , I was like it’s whatever, can you just come drop it off please? She says yes yes of course. 

Then I look up and I notice a beat up , run down old Chevy sedan coming towards me. It’s clearly my door dasher , not in the car they said they were in, and the driver was a MAN. No this was not just a man with a womanly voice. When he spoke, he said “I’m sorry about that maam” and it was a deep male voice. Like imagine hearing Megan the Stallion talking, followed by Morgan Freeman talking. VERY distinct and unmistakable voice. 

So who the fuck was I talking to on the phone?? And whose fucking car was that and who WAS that and why were they off the grid and stopped at the wrong building for 15 minutes???? There were other people standing out front , just other office workers on a smoke break or phone call,
or just going in and out, so I was never alone out there. I just can’t help but wonder if that was someone with bad intentions who was maybe spying on me from a different car and was waiting until I was alone, then just gave up because I never really was. 

I should’ve reported it now that I think about it but I was having a record busy day at work and I had already wasted 20 min of my day so I had to get back upstairs and it slipped my mind. 

TLDR; A dasher was exhibiting odd behavior and wouldn’t drop off my food or answer my calls despite being a few buildings away. When I spoke to her on the phone, she was clearly a female, but the person who ended up delivering my food was a male in a completely different car than the one listed. I can’t help but wonder if they had bad intentions. I did not report it because I was at work and very busy. I should have. ",0,1727926282.0,doordash,2,0.5,False

Regardless of your stance on the occult, in my opinion the occultModTeam's response was uncalled for.  Like seriously, their response has nil to do with the post. They are answering a question that was never asked and making a faulty assumption as to the reasons why. As to why they removed my post I have my suspicions ranging from misaligned comprehension at best and the mods being malignantly obtuse with a possibility of coordination at the worst.

a couple months ago i visited the cheyenne mountain zoo in colorado springs and when i came across this orangutan he looked so sad. I could literally see in his eyes that he didn’t belong there and it struck a nerve. This image has been replaying in my mind and i never understood why until just today i learned something new: 

most of starbucks baked goods contain palm oil, which is a cheap filler used to mimic cocoa butter. forests in indonesia and malasia have been converted to palm oil estates, harming the habitat of tens of thousands of orangutans to the brink of extinction. there is roughly only about 50-65,000 left in the wild, at this rate they’ll likely be gone in the next 50 years. 

I know i can’t make anyone give up something but if it isn’t for them do it for the children ( and adults ) working in horrible conditions while being underpaid on starbucks coffee farms or the sick cows starbucks sources their milk from … or maybe because rainforests supply us with something we kinda need to survive! just to name a few. 


unfortunately i’ve worked for starbucks and like everything else in life, all they care about is money!!!!!!!
They serve overpriced crappy drinks that are 50% ice. Please- if you can, support local coffee shops, or even better make it at home!

I dated a guy for about six weeks a few months ago, and we hit it off instantly on the first date - both agreed that we didn't want it to end. We had an 11/12 hour second date, and things moved pretty quickly. On the third date, he said that he was 8 months off of a serious relationship but open to a relationship if the connection/chemistry was there and then said he liked me a lot. He said that towards the end of the relationship, things had broken down to a point where he was pretty much over it pretty quickly. We had actually planned to go to NYC together for a joint birthday celebration (a train ride away) which would've been our sixth date, but his texting suddenly dropped off for a few days before the trip. I finally reached out saying I wasn't sure what was going on with the sudden lack of communication but that it seemed like he was losing interest. 

Later that day, he sent a long text back apologizing, saying that he really liked me a lot, that I was someone who he could fall for very easily, but that he was beginning to realize that we were moving too quickly and was hesitant to enter a relationship. He also said he'd never moved so quickly before. We ended up meeting in person to talk more about it, and he revealed that he had been in a six year relationship where he had been engaged for a couple of months. He was pretty open that his ex occasionally reaches out and he meets with her for coffee to discuss why things ended and said that the previous week, she had reached out again saying that she was more in love with him than ever and wanted another chance. He told her it was over, which took a pretty big emotional toll on him. Putting two and two together, it seems that maybe his ex reaching out made him realize he wasn't as over the relationship as he thought, and when I directly asked him if he wished he could work things out with her, he said ""No, but I'm still dealing with resentment and a lot of those other big emotions."" At the end of the convo, he told me that he personally made himself exclusive with me because it ""felt right"" but said he understood if I wanted to end things. I decided to continue, because it seemed he was genuinely interested in me since he had brought up exclusivity and I was in no rush to be in a relationship, even if I would've gladly agreed to be in one if he asked me. 

Two dates after that discussion, a friend actually found him on Hinge (but we matched on Bumble), and I confronted him about it and said he was what I was looking for and if he couldn't be exclusive, it would be better to end things. He said he had basically been swiping out of boredom, didn't converse with anyone on the apps and didn't want to meet with anyone new. Said he assumed as long as our apps were active, there was some degree of activity and that even though he didn't think it got better than me, he was beginning to realize that he was not in the right headspace to be dating, needed to take a long break, and agreed to end it. We had mutually agreed on an earlier date that the mutual attraction was too strong for us to be friends without it being really painful, so I think it was understood that we wouldn't try keeping in touch after that.

About 2.5 months after we stopped seeing/talking to each other, I actually ran into him, and he apologized again for how things ended, saying that it had nothing to do with me but that ""it was just too much."" I told him I understood but wished that he'd just ask me out again. He said ""I'll let you know,"" which brings me to my question -- do people actually mean it when they say these things? I honestly haven't met someone I clicked with so well and felt so comfortable with and feel like he'd be worth the wait, but after seeing how some of his other actions didn't align with his words while we were dating, I feel like he could also just be saying some bs. On the other hand, from our convos he knew me well enough to know that it's extremely important to me for people to mean what they say, and it would've been just as easy for him to say he'd rather not make any promises since there were pretty much no stakes in that convo (after all, we had already ended things, and this was just some chance meeting). Can anyone else comment on their experiences with this? Do people who say things like this actually try and come back eventually?",2,1727925160.0,dating,7,1.0,False

The city of Glass was not a kind place. Built at the end of the Resource Wars by a consortium of megacorporations, it was a shining testament to the power of Capitalism, and Free Commerce. From outside, the glass facade of the towers glittered in the light, seeming like a place of freedom and hope. And it was, really.

If you happened to be one of the wealthy and elite that lived on the upper levels.

The upper levels were called, by the locals, Topworld. The air was kept clean by discreet atmospheric scrubbers, the sun shone freely, and it was a truly spectacular sight. 

For those in the lower levels, called Undercity by most, it was a world of darkness. A land of rust, grime, and filthy air,  it was far from the clean air and sunshine of the Topworld. Their options were slim to none. Either join the corporate machine, and become an easily replaceable cog or join a gang and become embroiled in an endless struggle for territory and survival. 

For some, there was a third path. A dangerous one that often didn't end well for anyone involved. 

Rebellion.

No matter how pretty you dress up the cage, or how much you beat the occupants down, Humans always recognize the cage. Humans always want to escape.

For those that sensed the bars of debt and struggle that surrounded them, a voice whispered. 

Join us.

Whatever names they had previously were systematically eradicated, digital traces removed, and they became something else, something dangerous to the ivory tower elite that ruled those beneath them.

Deviants. Seditionists. Criminals. Terrorists. 

Rebels.

Many organized themselves into cells, waging silent and mostly ineffective war on the megacorps.

A.O. Corp, which controlled the weapons and police. The Janus Group, which dealt with the banking and finance industries. AllComm, the corporate media titan. They, among others, held the city in a credit covered fist. 

Rumors in the undercity spread without corporate oversight, word of mouth spreading the Whispers almost as fast as AllComm's propaganda machine. 

People who gave everything up to become ideas. Heroes and monsters both, to the working class. They hijacked shipments of medicines, depriving the Prometheus Labs hospitals. They stole weapons from A.O armories. They hacked AllComm broadcasts and streamed their own. 

The corporations came together and conducted a purge, killing or capturing thousands of people they claimed were insurgents. Most were never seen again. Those that were, were loyal workers, their previous allegiances seemingly erased.

This is the story of some of those people.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Upbeat music blared from the vidscreen playing in the background of Dominic Sutherland's small, fifty square foot apartment. Everything was multipurpose, and not a single thing inside it was new. 

The lyrics were incomprehensible, sung in a foreign language, but something about them brought a smile to Dom's face. Maybe it was the animated characters flashing across the screen joyously.

Dom stretched, joints popping on his large, muscled frame, and settled back on the overstuffed, worn couch. 

A disgraced veteran of A.O.’s military force, Dom had been kicked out due to excessive use of force, and other equally terrible crimes.  

It was all lies, of course. Dom had actually intervened and prevented the killing of innocent families by rogue elements within the police. They'd received intel pointing to a rebel base in one of the abandoned buildings in the industrial sector, and had immediately moved in. The idea was to capture them, get them to talk. Find out enough to go after the one who was really running things. The Firefighter.

It turned out that the rebel base was a small community of homeless people, scraping by on whatever junk they could repurpose. 

People just trying to get by outside of a system that had failed them. 

Standing orders were to apprehend them and take them to be processed at one of the many A.O. prison camps. It got them off the streets and kept the great machine of industry humming.

Something, though, maybe the look of hopeless defeat on their faces, maybe the fear in their eyes, changed things for Dom. He had stepped in front of the line of guns, using his own body to block the angles of fire, ordering the soldiers to stand down.

It had worked, briefly. There had been a lot of shouting, a lot of threats, and Dom heard the crack of a discharging capacitor. Lightning had coursed through his veins, and he had blacked out. When he came to, he had been strapped to a medical bed, and informed that he had gone on a rampage, unfortunately, and the civilians were dead, unfortunately, and he was being let go, unfortunately. No charges would be pressed, unfortunately, but he would be placed under close surveillance, to make sure he didn’t do anything like that again. 

When he asked to see the evidence, he was informed that the helmet camera footage had been damage, unfortunately, and that they had witness statements and the footage from the other soldiers. He had asked to see the footage and wouldn’t you know it. That footage was damaged as well, unfortunately.

The message was clear.

Get out. We don’t want you here. 

*Protect and Serve, my ass.*

That had been two years ago, and Dom was still salty about it. He had been raised to protect those around him, which caused his current employer no small amount of headaches.

Dom worked for a small-time mob boss, one Jake Harkness, who styled himself as something of a freedom fighter. Dom didn't really care. The money was good, and Jake was generally alright to be around. 

Unless he was toting that oversized flamethrower he got somewhere. Then things got complicated. 

Still, Dom's job wasn't bad. His role in the organization was simple. Protect Jake. Bounce the heads of anyone within it that tried to pull a fast one. Don't die.

He took the remote for the vidscreen and changed the channel. The AllComm logo appeared, playing the oh-so-serious jingle associated with their news as it always did when the channel was selected, and the news anchor appeared.

*“...and that, folks, is why you never mix cybernetics with piñatas.* 

*In other news, the terrorist organization Black Lotus has claimed responsibility for the explosion at Miller Barracks, one of the Allan-Otashi Corporation’s military training facilities, resulting in the death of over a dozen of our hard working heroes in uniform.* 

The image cut to a view of a burning building, emergency services fighting to put out the flames that engulfed it. It could have been anywhere.

*A.O. has vowed to crack down on the terrorists, and has declared heightened security at all A.O. facilities.*

Dom’s comm buzzed quietly, and he glanced at the screen. It was Jake. A button on the remote muted the vid, and he answered with a grunt.

*“Dom. Dom, thank the Gods you answered. Dom, I fucked up. I really fucked up. They got me on camera, Dom. I’ve got Sec goons closing in on me right now. I need you.”* a voice said, clearly panicked.

Dominic closed his eyes for a moment, cursing quietly and reached under the coffee table to pull out his oversized pistol. He checked the chamber, ensuring it was loaded, and put it on safe. 

“Where?”

Jake rattled off an address, and Dom grabbed his jacket. The gun went into a shoulder holster and he covered it with the jacket as he stepped out the door.

“Jake, talk to me. What am I getting into? How many? Which unit? How secure are you?” he asked, locking the door.

*“Uh.. I make six. I’m secure for the moment. Lead them away from the kids, you know? Don’t want them mixed up in this life,”* Jake babbled, a tinge of hysteria in his words. *“Ah, the unit… patch looks like.. A rope? Maybe? It’s a squiggly line in a circle.”*

*Damnit. Taskmasters.* 

They were a high threat response team, sent when the target had to be taken alive, but was also strong enough– either via drugs, cybernetic enhancements, or something else– to be able to argue about it. They weren’t a particularly nice unit.

He hurried down to the elevator, hitting the button to take him to the garage. After about a minute of descent, the only sounds being the humming of electric motors, the doors gave a happy little \*ding\* and opened. Dom moved to the  parking space he shared with six other tenants, currently showing an electric car. A keypad on the side received a few button presses, and the space the car was in retracted, taking the car with it. There was a few moments of humming and the sounds of machinery, and his vehicle slid out of the wall. 

He threw a leg over his heavy motorcycle and hit the ignition, putting his full helmet on his head. Popping the clutch and shifting into gear, he roared out of the garage and into the busy Glass traffic.

He wove through traffic, a symphony of horns and shouting left in his wake. 

He drove recklessly, cutting vehicles off, blowing through red lights, even mounting the curb once or twice. Anything to get more shave time.

About a quarter mile from the location, a small office building, Dom began seeing signs of Corporate Security. Drones in the air, cruisers hovering menacingly over intersections, checkpoints being erected. He cursed, slowing down, and pulled over.

He called Jake. 

“Boss. Extraction is going to be tough. Pigs already have the whole block closed, and the net is growing as I watch. I’m…” Dom took a deep breath. “I’m going to have to do something stupid.”

*“Are you saying you can’t get me?”* came the frantic reply.

“No, I’m coming. Sit tight.”

This part of the city was riddled with tunnels. Sewers, service and maintenance tunnels, even military tunnels that allowed units to appear almost anywhere. Dom accelerated back onto the street and turned down an alley after a few minutes, coming to a stop in front of a large, overflowing dumpster. He stepped into the dumpster and through it, disrupting the holographic camouflage for a moment that covered a manhole. Taking hold of a handle welded to the top, Dom muscled it off and set it aside. He took a moment to prepare himself, and dropped in. 

He descended only about 6 feet before he landed on the floor of a tunnel lit with flickering light from old bulbs inset into the wall at head level. The tunnel extended in two directions, left and right, their ends vanishing into the gloom. Turning to the left, he started hurrying.

A city as old as Glass had many places that were abandoned or little used, and this tunnel happened to be one of those. Exploration during a misspent youth had let him discover it, and he had realized over time that it made for a great, private highway. He unfolded a much creased paper, a crude map scrawled on it, and continued moving as he plotted his route.

A few minutes, and several turns later, and Dom was at a boarded up door. He could hear voices on the other side, heavily distorted by helmet speakers, and cursed quietly. Peeking through a small hole deliberately placed in the door, he spied two soldiers, chatting in boredom as they guarded an apparently empty section of tunnel. 

Dom drew his pistol and checked it, ensuring it was still loaded, and quietly slipped it off safe. With a breath to psych himself up, he kicked the door. The wooden boards, cleverly designed to look like they were solid, shattered along carefully concealed faults and flew into the tunnel in a clatter of debris.

The soldiers jerked, their amicable conversation rudely disrupted by the emergence of a large figure from what had seemed a previously solid section of wall. Before they could comm for help, Dom raised his pistol and fired twice, one round for each. Visors shattered, and heads snapped back, and both soldiers spun to the ground, dead.

Briefly feeling remorse, Dom steeled himself and hurried past, quickly moving down the tunnel as he counted ladders to himself. Each one lead to a building up above, and after five hundred feet, he stopped in front of one.

He quickly climbed up, reaching the trapdoor that separated the buildings above from the service tunnels below. He knocked on the door twice, waited a moment, then knocked three times. There was a few seconds of silence, then the answering two-three knock came, and the door was pulled open.

Peering down on Dom was Jake’s pale, anxious face, long red beard covering half of it, the tip of his flamethrower pointed into the hole. Upon seeing Dom, Jake’s expression changed to one of relief, and he pulled away to let Dom up.

Dom finished his climb and slipped through the trap door, into a dusty kitchen, debris scattered all over the floor.

“Jake, let’s go. Into the tunnels, I have an exit for us.”

Jake looked pained as he looked at Dom.

And neither am I. 

I thought they were embarrassed by their moon-drunk selves, but no. 

They were playing Silent Hill with my emaciated body. 

The moon's influence has moved past sending them into a trance-like state and acting moon-drunk. This was a whole other level of side effect. One they were trying and failing to hide with smiles and nonchalant faces. And I couldn’t stand it.

I was going to go fucking crazy.

Especially when the three of them were acting like the night before never happened. 

I needed answers.

Why we were replicating—and the numbers carved into mine and Rowan’s necks supposedly marking our copies.

Were Immie and Kaz the same?

I wasn’t going to find them staying in that house. Not in my state of mind, anyway. 

Paranoia had taken over like a virus, like a parasite leeching onto my brain. 

Conversations with them turned into a game of cat and mouse. 

Kaz cornered me in the kitchen to lecture me about leaving the refrigerator door open, and I felt… trapped. Like he was going to lunge at me any second, like he could sense my smell, the taste of fresh flesh on my bones ready for him to tear off. 

He looked normal enough, talking like usual, with a brow raised and the slight curve of a smirk on his lips. 

But I didn’t see intense hunger in his eyes. I didn’t see anything predatory. 

Kaz seemed like himself, like the guy I’d been living with for almost two years. 

And somehow, that made it worse. 

That made them good actors. Rowan and Immie were exactly the same, becoming the perfect mimics of the people I had grown to love. 

It was around midnight when I dragged myself down the stairs, shouldering a backpack with everything I could pack on such short notice. Yanking open the door and stepping over the threshold, I sucked in the cool night air. Before I could step out, however, a chuckle startled me.

Rowan. Standing in his robe, dark brown curls sticking up everywhere, he regarded me with dark eyes—and just for a moment, I wondered if he was going to drop the act.

Out of the three of them, Rowan was the one who struggled most with the façade.

I hadn’t forgotten the look of resentment and hatred he’d given me on the night of the full moon. The real him. Relief flooded me at the thought of him giving in and finally ripping off the mask. Instead, though, he folded his arms across his chest and took a step forward, still with that smile, a smile I knew was a grimace.

Rowan really wasn’t trying to hide his disdain for me.

Instinctively, I took a step back.

And like clockwork, he took another step forward, and another, until I could smell the coffee on his breath.

“It’s almost midnight,” Rowan said. If he noticed my panicked steps back, he didn’t say anything. “Where are you going?”

“The store,” I replied smoothly. “I need some fresh air.”

Rowan cocked his head, his lip curling. “At midnight?”

The door slammed shut in my face, and I resisted the urge to shriek.

“Yeah,” I hissed out. “I’m gonna get some food.”

“Hungry?” He gestured behind him. “Dude, Kaz just made veggie lasagna. Don’t you want that?”

“No,” I said. “I’m not hungry.”

“Uh-huh.” His lip curled. “So, what are you going to the store for?”

The gleam in his eye was driving me crazy. His whole expression, every contortion in his face, was challenging me to make more excuses.

The conversation was going nowhere, and somehow I could tell he was loving it; he was loving the fact that I was trembling, trying to stay calm, trying to stabilize my body. “Candy,” I said through my teeth. “I’m going to get some candy.”

Rowan hummed, an almost genuine smile pricking. I might have fallen for it if it wasn’t for how close he was standing to me, how he was cornering me. “Sweet. Get me some, would ya? There’s something about those gummy snakes that seriously slap.” He offered his hand for a high five, his gaze flicking to my backpack. He knew.

I knew he knew, and yet he wasn’t saying anything. He was playing with me. 

Rowan’s smile widened. “Hurry back, all right? There are some freaks out there, Nin. We don’t want you getting hurt now, do we?”

Something ice-cold slipped down my spine, and I forced a smile back.

Every instinct inside me told me to run. I had to get out. Away from him. From his coffee breath turning my gut, his erratic movements like he was ready to tear out my throat at any moment. I felt my body moving, my legs starting to work.

One step—and then another. I turned away from him. It took one single breath to reach the door, and another to remember how to grab the handle and twist it.

He was coming after me, I thought, my mind going into overdrive. 

I imagined his footsteps, heavy breath as he wrapped his hand around my arm and yanked me back inside, his teeth grazing the back of my neck. I forced my legs further until I was halfway down the path, reveling in the cool night air grazing my arms. When I pushed open the rickety gate which squealed under pressure, I risked turning back, my heart in my throat. 

In my head, Rowan was a monster bleeding back into the dark.

Turning around to face the house, though, there was nobody there. 

The door was still open, the hallway lit up in all-too-familiar golden light. 

But Rowan was gone. 

When I squinted, I could just about glimpse his figure moving back up the stairs in slow, almost defeated strides.

Something held me there for a second, staring at the house I always saw as a home and the people I saw as family. 

Before I turned and finally catapulted myself into a run. 

It’s not like I could go back to my parents' house.

They live across the state, and it was the middle of the night.

I had a friend from class. Sam. We used to be close, but a while ago he started to distance himself, only smiling at me in passing. We went from hanging out almost every day to barely talking, and I figured it was just natural for a friendship to crumble, even if I didn’t want it to. Sam got new friends, and I moved out of my dorms.

I could either turn up at his door and make a fool out of myself, or go back to my cannibal roommates. 

Making a fool out of myself, it was.

Sam lived in a large building with ivy crawling up red-brick. The house was old and crumbling, but cozy. I remembered freshman days, sitting under the late glow of the sun, the two of us spread out on a worn picnic blanket watching the July 4th fireworks in the sky. Before I could hesitate, I knocked three times. 

The windows were dark, so that wasn’t exactly comforting. 

Sam used to leave the door open so I could slip in whenever I wanted. Seeing it locked made my stomach twist.

Sure, it was midnight. Why *wouldn't* he lock it? 

I was frowning at a decaying dandelion when the door opened, and a pixie redhead stuck her head out. I recognized her automatically. Poppy. Sam’s roomie.

I had grown used to her over-the-top smiles and obsession with mini cacti, but this girl seemed like a different person. 

There was something else. Something I couldn’t put my finger on. The girl was fully dressed in a leather jacket over jeans and shirt, her collar glistening from the downpour I’d managed to miss. Half lidded eyes drank me in for a moment like she was in a daze before she seemingly snapped out of it, yanking the door open. 

“Nin?” Poppy’s gaze snapped to my feet. 

“Why are you barefoot?” She folded her arms. “Don't tell me you've got a weird fetish.”

I stared down at my feet, and she was right. I didn’t even put on shoes. The worst part is I barely felt the rough gravel between my toes and bare soles. I was numb on adrenaline. I shook my head with what I hoped was a smile. “Is Sam in?”

Something flashed across her face, and it was so fast I could barely read it. Poppy was quick to hide it with a smile. “Uhh, he's kind of busy right now.” Her attention went back to my feet. “More importantly, why are you running around with no shoes on?”

Before I could choke some kind of answer, the girl gestured me inside. “Get inside! Jesus, Nin, your feet!”

I managed a smile, stepping into the hallway. The house was exactly how I remembered it. Homely. Safe.

“Thanks.”

“What do you need Sam for?” Poppy asked, shutting and locking the door.

I shrugged, shivering. I didn’t realize how cold I was until I stepped into warmth. “Just to talk to him! You know, catch up.”

Poppy laughed. “About? You ran across campus to talk?” Her smile was teasing, and I’d missed it. “Nin, have you heard of texting?”

“I’m kind of locked out.”

Poppy’s smile faded. “Ah.” She cleared her throat, stepping aside. 

“Well, you know you’ve always got a home here if you’re ever in trouble.” she gestured over her shoulder. “Sammy is in the lounge.” 

Poppy led me into their kitchen and plonked a can of soda on the table. It was just like the old days. Poppy and I would hang in the kitchen drinking while Sam took a millennia to get ready. “You drink that. I'll drag Sam away from his game.” 

I nursed the can between my hands, rolling it around. *”Game?”*

Poppy rolled her eyes, yanking open the refrigerator with a little *too much* gusto and pulling out a beer. She cracked it open and took a sip through a  groan. 

“Urgh. They're in the middle of a tournament, or whatever. It started last night, and it’s still going. You’d think grown adults would do something more interesting with their time, but alas, I digress.” Poppy set the can down. “I’ve been trying to sleep for the last few hours, but they’re pretty loud. I just block them out with whatever’s on Netflix.”

Cracking open my soda, I downed half of it. God, there was nothing better than a frosty Coke. Rowan and I used down bottles of them for our failed Tik-Tok account. We stopped doing it when he had to get his stomach pumped.

“Tournament?” I said through a mouthful. 

I couldn’t help noticing her attire, and her claim about not being able to sleep suddenly seemed dubious. What, had she been sleeping fully dressed?

Poppy smirked and perched herself on the edge of the table. ""Just a nerd game,"" she said dismissively. ""Sam’s friends are quite… odd.""

I glanced at her jacket, still glistening. ""Have you been outside?""

""Outside?"" Her expression crumpled before she realized what I meant. ""Oh. Oh, yeah. I went for a walk."" She grabbed her beer. ""Hey, why don’t we head into the lounge instead, huh? I’m sure Sam wouldn’t mind us interrupting him.""

With a mischievous glint in her eyes, she spun around and grabbed my arm. ""Besides! Sammy’s friends have been here long enough.""

As she pulled me into the lounge, I caught a fleeting glimpse of... something.

I didn’t see much, just enough to know it wasn’t some typical Dungeons and Dragons game.

Papers were strewn across the table. A group of people, including Sam, was gathered around, one of them marking something on the paper.

Sam’s other housemates were conspicuously absent. When Poppy walked in, dragging me along, the group quickly turned to block my view, hurriedly clearing papers and shutting laptops. 

It felt like I’d just walked into something I wasn’t supposed to see. Poppy, however, seemed delighted by their reaction. ""Oh, Saaaammmyy,"" she sang, leaning against the door with a smile. ""You have a visitor.""

Sam looked different, though I couldn’t put my finger on why. 

His light sandy hair was tied into its usual clumsy ponytail, but the look on his face was one I’d never seen before. 

Flustered, his cartoonishly wide eyes blinking at me like I was a hallucination. 

Like Poppy, he was fully dressed. Sam murmured something to the group, and they quickly gathered stained coffee mugs and bits of paper, clearing the table.

Poppy, now slumped into a beanbag, shot me a grin. ""And then there were three!” 

She stretched out like a cat and squealed when Sam threw a cushion at her. ""We finally have our house back!""

""You know I have the lounge until two,"" he retorted, continuing to tidy up.

Poppy mimicked his voice, her body melting into the beanbag. *""You know I have the lounge until two.""*

""What did I tell you about mimicking me?"" Sam shot her a glare, exasperated.

The girl chuckled. ""Hey, it’s fun.""

""It’s not fun when you sound absolutely nothing like me.”

“Cry about it, Sammy.”

Their back and forth reminded me of my own roommates.

His lip curled into the slightest of smiles, and he picked up another cushion to throw. “Poppy.”

“Sam.” She shot back in a mocking exaggeration of his accent.

Sam’s accent never failed to take me by surprise. Hard Aussie. When I first met him I could barely understand him.

It didn’t help that upon first meeting him, he talked like he’d been fast forwarded.

Originally from Victoria, Sam Fuller was my first friend. 

That’s how we became close, actually. His amusement at my failure to understand him. Poppy folded her arms, her gaze trailing after the group filing out of the room. They were mixed ages, though none of them were Sam’s. 

They all looked to be middle aged to ancient. I glimpsed a woman who looked to be at least 70 stride to the door. “Don’t give me that look.” Poppy said.

“Your weird friends can find another meeting place for your games. I want to sleep. Allie and Tom have locked themselves in their rooms since you decided to invite half of the neighborhood.”

“They’re not weird games. We’re saving the town.” Sam shooed Poppy out of the room. “Don’t you have work to do?” 

“Maybe.” Poppy nodded at me. “I’ll make you another drink.” Her gaze fell on Sam. “Beer?”

He grinned. “That’d be great.""

“Awesome!” Poppy playfully hit him. “Get one yourself. You’re a big boy, aren’t cha? I’ll be in my room!”

Ignoring Poppy slamming the door behind her, Sam’s attention flicked to me. “Nin, what are you doing here?”

I couldn’t help it, the words slipping out before I could stop them. “Who were they?”

Sam dragged his hands through his hair. “Just friends.” His expression softened, and the knot in my gut loosened.

“You look like shit, Nin. What happened?”

I figured telling him a diluted version of the night of the full moon was better so I didn’t sound out of my mind.  

By the time I was finished explaining, the two of us were curled up on his bed in front of his laptop playing YouTube videos on low. Poppy had lent me some clothes to sleep in, and I was ready to pass out. Sam sat in front of me, his arms wrapped around his knees. 

“So, your roomies got you freaked?” He frowned, his sleepy eyes on me. “What did they do?”

Cannibalise my body. I thought dizzily.

No, worse. They weren’t just eating me.

They were replicating me, so they could eat me again, and again, and again, and—

“They were just acting weird.” I said.

“Weird *how*?”

Hours later, when I was falling asleep, and Sam was watching YouTube, he nudged me.

“Nin?”

“Mm?” I mumbled into his pillow.

“Where do you live now? Like, which house?”

“It’s just down the road from here.”

He hummed. “And those roommates…who are they again?”

I didn’t answer him.

I mean, I couldn’t.

Their names were entangled on my tongue whenever I tried.

Sam asked me the same question every day, and the words tangled in my throat. 

I told him it was a prank gone wrong, and that seemed to appease him.

But his expression never seemed to believe me, forcing a smile and nodding. 

Like a parent reassuring a child everything was going to be okay. 

A week flew by in a confusing blur, and I went to class as usual, staying at Sam’s until I could find a more permanent place. Much to Poppy’s delight, Sam didn’t invite his friends over again. Instead, he insisted on video games and takeout every night.

It was like freshman year again, and I found myself drowning out the thoughts and questions still haunting me with alcohol and drunk games of Risk.

Classes were more or less the same, but they were a good distraction.

I got texts and missed calls from Immie, and Kaz and Rowan were blowing up the group chat with “?????” messages. 

I muted it and ignored my phone. There would be a point when I’d go back, I thought. After all, I had to know what was wrong with them, why the moon afflicted that kind of behavior, and just what exactly they had done to me. 

But it wouldn’t be yet. 

I can’t remember what day it was when I fully came to reality, badly hungover and feeling sick to my stomach.

Class was ending, and as usual, I filed out of the hall, heading to where Sam usually met me before we went to his house. My head was spinning, a striking pain rattling my skull.

I’d suffered from hangover headaches before, but this was something new. Swallowing two Tylenol with the cold coffee I’d had in my backpack all day wasn’t a good idea. Slumping down on the stairs leading to the main reception, I fought against a cry. The pain was like nothing I’d felt before, like someone had plunged a lead pipe through my brain and stirred my brain into a soupy mess. 

Luckily, Sam joined me quickly, his smile dampening when he saw my expression. 

“Oh, man.” He felt my forehead. “You look like you’re going to barf everywhere.”

Despite the pain, I managed a smile. “Do I look like a zombie?”

I could practically hear the cogs in his head turning. Sam dragged a hand through his hair. “Will you hit me if I say yes?”

I shooed him away when he held up his hand. “How many fingers am I holding up?”

“Fifteen.” I rolled my eyes. I meant to say that we should head down the stairs because I was feeling progressively sicker by the second and felt like I was going to faint, the world around me becoming a blur of colors and faint noises I could barely decipher. 

A sudden loud slam, however, pricked my ears. It didn’t seem to alert the crowd of students, merely a whisper in a room full of loud chatter and laughter. 

To me though, it was a sound I knew all too well. 

Lifting my head, I scanned the crowd enveloping the hallway. 

Sam was speaking behind me, but his voice collapsed into a low buzz of white noise bleeding into my muddled brain. 

I knew that sound. The sound of skin hitting glass, or wood, sometimes plastic. The sound of slipping on a rug, or tripping on literal *air.*  There was nobody else it  would be but my chronically clumsy roommate. 

Which meant he was on campus, and I had zero idea how to confront him about the *cannibalism* thing. 

He wasn't what you'd expect a monster to look like—especially not one you knew had already killed and eaten you multiple times. It was all about perspective. 

To a passerby, he seemed like an ordinary college student, a dishevelled one who had just stumbled headlong into an automatic door, leaving a glaring red bruise in the center of his forehead. 

But to me, Rowan Beck was a monster surrounded by fresh meat. 

The students pushing past him were a blur to me, but to *him*, I caught his gaze drinking each one in, his nose flaring when a guy sauntered past him. 

From a distance, my roommate appeared unchanged, wearing a faded, threadbare t-shirt bearing a logo that had long since peeled away, a pair of well-worn jeans with frayed edges and a patch over one knee.  So much for his *pretentious phase.* 

The glasses were a *choice*.

His dark brown curls were tousled and unkempt, partially hidden under a baseball cap that looked like it had seen better days. But as he drew nearer, I could see his mask slowly starting to crumble. 

His wide smile faltering, twitching into a grimace. 

His cheeks looked hollow, gaunt even. Like something was sucking the life from him. 

Closing in on me, his penetrating gaze hidden behind a pair of raybans, my mediocre lunch crept up my throat. 

I stepped back, scanning for am exit.

And like he had read my mind, his steps quickened. 

He was still wearing that disguise. Still mimicking my best friend. 

Hiding whatever spell he was under.

Rowan oozed broke college student who hadn’t showered in days. 

In his hand was a to-go cup of hot cocoa--which was my favorite. 

Rowan knew that. It had been my  coffee order every time we studied there as a four.  

“Yooo, Nin! Sup!"" Rowan was attracting stares as he sort of danced towards me, tripping over his feet, only for him to steady himself with a grin. 

His words were slurred slightly when he handed me the drink, and he stumbled, managing to right himself. He wasn’t moon-drunk, I thought.

Actually drunk.

“Hey.” Sam nudged me. I noticed he’d stiffened up. “That's your roommate? Rowan Beck?"" 

I didn’t get a chance to reply, with Rowan situating himself right in front of me, swaying a little.

“Now call me craaaaazy!” My roommate said in a slurred giggle. He stumbled again, and this time my hand shot out to steady him on impulse. I caught the flash of disgust on his face. Still wearing that smile, he swiped my hand off of his shoulder. “But I’m getting the vibe you’re avoiding us! Which is like, sooo rude. You could have just sent us a text, but noooo, you decided to be cool and mys-te-ri-ous.""

I took the drink hesitantly. “Are you drunk?” 

Rowan cocked his head. He had that stupid smile again. The one he pulled during a full moon. Outside though, it was daylight, the sun shining in the sky.  

“Drunk? You think I can get drunk? Nah man, I just feel kinda shit. He shrugged. “I haven’t been eating great the last few days. Not eating can fuck a guy up. Right Nin?”

Every word penetrated like a knife, and suddenly it was hard to fucking breathe.

My roommate turned to Sam. “Ooh, I know you!"" He spread out his arms, a choked laugh escaping his lips. ""You’re the guy who wrote that fucking article about us!” 

Rowan was causing a scene and he didn't give a shit. I couldn't tell if he was moon drunk, or just more insane than usual. 

He jumped in front of Sam, with the kind of manic energy which was still him, and yet cranked to 100. “Loved it, Fuller! You're a literary genius! Especially when you called us ‘evil body snatching demons’ who should be burned at the stake. A truly riveting read.""  

Sam’s expression stayed stoic. “Rowan.” He said my roommate's name like poison. “Where’s Kaz?”

“Playing COD, probably.” Rowan’s lips curled into a smirk. He leaned close to the guy, raising an eyebrow, his words more of a breathy laugh. “Why? Do you want me to pass a message to him?”

Sam stepped back. “Nin, I gotta go."" He said, pulling out his phone. “I’ll speak to you later.”

“Right.” I panicked. “Am I still okay to stay?”

“I’m… I’m busy.” Sam nodded at me, ignoring Rowan, before stumbling back into the crowd. “Come by later, all right?”

He was gone before I could open my mouth.

“Aww, noooo. Don't gooooo.” Rowan mocked a pout, turning to me. 

“Damn. Did he seem… offended? By my presence?"" He waved Sam away with a grin. ""Anyway! Imogen is making dinner tonight. She’s bought all the ingredients for something she saw on Pinterest, so I’m not holding my breath that it’ll be good—or even edible.” 

I didn’t fight back when he slipped his hand in mine, pulling me down the stairs. 

His tone was already puppeteering my limbs. 

My roommate twisted around, shooting me a sheepish smile. 

“Okayyyy, you got me! I should probably apologize for the other night.”

I was already backing away, pulling away from him.

“I don’t care what you have to say.” I said in a breath. “I’m staying with my parents.”

“You mean halfway across the state?” Rowan’s hand tightened around my arm. ""Come on. We just want to talk.”

“Talk?”

That got my attention. Following him to his car parked out front, I slipped into the passenger seat.

I was aware I was following the big bad wolf into the forest, every horror movie cliché.

But what other choice did I have?

I needed answers. Maybe he was finally going to tell me what the fuck was going on. Rowan was still my roommate. 

I had lived with him for two years. I needed to know what was going with them. Why were they like this? And why, according to him, this was my fault. 

Rowan jumped into the drivers seat and started the car, dragging his hand through his hair. “Yeah.” He said. “I mean, once again we left you on a full moon and I bet it sucked. But hey,” He chuckled. “At least you didn’t see us moon-drunk again.” My housemate sent me a mocking look, “Wait, did you? Oh, man, what did I do this time? The last thing I remember is playing Monopoly, and I think at some point I cuffed you to your bed.”

Twisting around to face him, my heart slithered into my throat. The bastard was still playing his games.

“You’re still saying that?” I hissed. “Moon drunk?”

Rowan’s gaze didn’t leave the road. “I mean, yeah.” He murmured, “You said we freak you out, so we keep our distance.”

Rowan didn’t speak for most of the ride, and I spent the majority of it trying to find out how to jump out of a moving car without seriously injuring myself. 

My phone vibrated and I pulled it out, glimpsing a text heading my notifications bar.

Sam: Sent: 4:05PM.

“That thing is NOT Rowan Beck. Get out of that house.”

Another message:

Sam: Sent: 4:06PM: “GET OUT, NIN. GET OUT OF THAT HOUSE.”

Instinctively, I grabbed for the handle, pawing for a way out. 

I felt like I was on fire, my body moving closer to the door, leaning into it, as if it would magically fucking open for me. 

“You okay?” Rowan murmured. He slipped off his raybans and turned to me. 

That same gleam was in his eyes, that sliver of moonlight. 

He looked worse without the raybans, bloodshot eyes, a mixture of burst blood vessels and moonlight haloing his iris. 

My roommate looked beautiful and horrifying at the same time, a mixture of human and inhuman; the shell of the guy I thought I knew filled with her. But there was something else, something I didn’t understand. His skin looked… cracked. 

Like it was splintering apart. 

And in those cracks was what I imagined pins and needles to look like. Static. 

There was static leaking from the cracks, spider webbing across his pasty skin. 

Rowan sighed when I couldn’t bring myself to answer. 

“You know,” he said, his hands tapping the steering wheel. ""Eating makes me feel better. It... “ He took a long breath, tapping out a tune. “Well, it takes the memories away, you know? Makes me feel so fucking good.” He tipped his head back, eyes rolling back, like he was in euphoria.

“Rowan.” I managed to get out. 

His eyes flickered shut at a red light. “You would not believe how good the human skull tastes when mixed with intestines. Oh my god, the crunch! It's fucking *insane*. Your skin is my favorite part.""

He tapped a beat with his shoe. ""Damn, you taste good. Like chicken! But a little sour.”

When I grabbed for the door handle, one arm whipped out, pinning me to the seat, the other straying on the wheel. 

He was unsurprisingly strong, his heavy weight restraining me against cool leather. “The flesh under Kaz’s bed is good. I mean, it’s a little soggy and gross on the outside. It’s not peak meat, but it’s tolerable. If you ask me honestly, I’d say I prefer you refrigerated.” 

His lips split into a grin. “And we’re saving those for a good game of Smash.”

“Rowan.” I heard myself say his name again, straining against his arm.

“You said we should talk.” He deadpanned. 

Outside, the world went by as normal, the evening rush hour flying by in a blur of vivid reds and oranges. “So, that’s what we’re going to do.” He whistled. “Talk.”

Words appeared in my throat, but they wouldn’t form on my tongue. 

He surprised me with a laugh. And with that laugh, his façade was shattered. 

He’d finally ripped off his mask. “Why did you have to come downstairs?” 

Rowan finally twisted to me, his lips curled into a grin, his eyes telling a different story. So many emotions. Past emotions. Emotions from a time ripped from my memory. Hatred and pain, anger and something else entirely I couldn’t read. 

“All you had to do was stay in your fucking room, and we wouldn’t have to… have to remember. We could go on living together. You, me, Kaz and Immie. And yeah, when I’m agitated or it’s nearing totality, I start to remember pieces of it.” His voice broke, which was so unlike him.

So haunted, so hollow and wrong. “Why I… why I fucking despise you, Nin.” He was trembling, and when I dared look, his skin was slowly coming apart, a cocktail of moonlight and static pouring out. 

I was frozen. I couldn’t fucking move. Rowan grabbed the wheel with both hands, his knuckles turning white. 

He’d let me go, but I couldn’t bring myself to move. Not when he’d said that. 

Not when his words had stirred something in me. Still though, he kept speaking—like him—the real him—had been silenced for so long, and here he was, letting it all out. 

“She takes all the bad away,” he whispered, a dreamy smile spreading across his lips. “As long as we eat, I don’t feel anything at all. I don’t have to fucking think or breathe, and I can look at you with rose-tinted glasses and a foggy brain. It’s fucking bliss. Like I’m….drowning.” Rowan sighed, dragging his hand through his hair. 

“Not now,” he said. “Now, she’s punishing me because I haven’t eaten.”

The car swerved around a truck, and I fought against my own body, fighting to grab the wheel. But I was frozen. 

“Now, I remember.” His tone was poison spitting from his tongue. 

“She made us remember, and it’s… it’s fucking there in my head,” His voice strained, and he stabbed at his left temple. “Right here! It’s right fucking here, Nin, and I can’t… I can’t stop it. I can’t stop her. She’s in my... my head.”

Rowan didn’t look at me. In fact, he was actively avoiding making eye contact.

Tears were welling in his eyes, hysterical tears leaking that same buzzing black and white static. “She’s in my head. Always in my head. Singing, man. Singing at the top of her voice.”

“What did I do?” I didn’t mean to say it. 

The car swerved again, and I braced myself against the seat. “Rowan, you keep telling me I did something.” I managed. “Why can’t you tell me?”

My roommate turned to me, his eyes filled with that unearthly light I knew he’d been trying to avoid for months.

His smile was suddenly maniacal. Not his. Someone else's. “Because it’s fun!”

This time I did grab for the wheel, trying to shove him from his seat. “Stop the fucking car.”

Rowan easily got the upper hand, grasping it. “No. Like I said, we’re going home. And.. and we’re going to talk.”

It was me who laughed this time. “Talk?” I spluttered. “You mean eat me. Copy me. Whatever you do.”

I couldn’t control my emotions. I laughed. It felt good. ""You suck at being a serial killer."" 

I managed to take him off guard for a moment. He blinked before regaining control. “It’s not… like that. Jesus fucking Christ.”

""Then what is it?” I spat back, days of repressed emotions rushing to the surface. 

“I catch you eating me, and what am I supposed to think? Did you guys seriously think I’d just go along with whatever this is? Are you trying to shield me, is that it?” 

I was laughing, and I couldn’t stop. 

And at that moment I realized we were both under her spell. Both of us were screaming at each other. 

Rowan, leaking her light, and me, bathing in it. 

It hit me, then, that I was as inhuman as him. 

Whatever the moon had done, it was affecting both of us. 

I just didn’t have the cannibalistic tendencies he had. 

“I caught you chewing on what I presume was my *twenty sixth* body! What the fuck do you think you can shield me from?” 

Rowan surprised me with a scoff. “I’m sorry, *shield* you?” He turned to me fully, and I realized, my stomach creeping into my throat, that he wasn’t looking at the road. 

“Are you fucking *kidding* me?” My roommate choked out. “I want you to remember!” He yelled. “Do you think I like looking at you, knowing that you’re completely oblivious about what you… about what you did to us? No, it fucking hurts! You think I *want* to play happy families with you?” Rowan was cracking. 

I wasn't sure if that was good or bad. 

I noticed him inching away from me. 

“That's why I *eat*, Nin. That’s why we eat. She numbs those feelings. Those thoughts. She only makes us think about the good.”

When his hands slammed into the steering wheel, I finally caught a sliver of humanity coming back to fruition on his face.

My hand slipped from the handle, and I heard myself speak. “What did I *do*?”

But Rowan’s eyes were on the road again. He squinted, and reality seeped in. “What the fuck is *that*?”

No longer on the main road, we were heading into darkness, an empty stretch of oblivion I didn’t recognise. There were no signs of cars. I swallowed. “What did you see?""

Rowan shook his head, blinking rapidly. “Nothing.” He said. “I think I’m… seeing things—”

Whatever Rowan was about to say was cut off suddenly, followed by a blinding flash which felt and sounded like the world had been ripped apart in front of us.

Something was there, blinding me, searing my eyes from my skull. 

But I had no time to scream, no time to think or breathe. 

Before I could, my mind was working, and dizzying thoughts were hitting me. 

Our car had hit something, and that something was powerful enough to propel me into the air, my roommate's car shredded apart. The world was shattering around me, my body caught in a whirlwind. 

The sensations were too real, too real to be feeling them. 

I wasn’t supposed to feel this. 

I wasn’t supposed to feel my body being ripped apart, and still be self-aware enough to screech into nothing, a nothing which existed when my head had been ripped from my torso. I wasn't supposed to– 

Exist. 

I waited to die. 

Without a brain, without a body, I waited for the dark. And yet somehow, I didn’t fall fully. Instead of plunging into the dark, my body was still mine. It still had a head.

A torso.

It was still mine when it hit something with a sickening crack.

Concrete.

Dying kind of feels like melting. I was aware my eyes were snapping open for a moment, something wet and warm spreading around me and trickling from my lips. I could taste rust, and I couldn't stop it. My vision was blurry, too blurry to make sense of anything. I watched my eyelids flickering, like they were unsure what to do.

The sky was pretty. I think I tried to name a star, before everything just kind of… melted. 

It was the 28th time I’d died, and this was the first time I really felt it. 

Melting. 

I melted into the ground, my body and thoughts fragmenting. 

Before whatever had taken me choked me back out. 

Death had rejected me. 

After a disorienting moment of *nothing*, trapped between nothing and something, awareness came back to me in splinters, reality bleeding back into focus. I could feel the breeze tickling my back. 

I had…moved.

I was no longer where I’d landed on my back after being propelled from the car in the crash.

Now I was lying on my stomach. 

Something tickled my face. 

Grass. 

I was lying face down on the side of the road.  

I can’t describe the sensation it was to awaken only being part real. 

When I sat up, I felt real. 

I felt like I was part of this universe. 

But looking down at myself, I resembled a ghost, both see-through and not. Prodding at my skin, that same static bleeding from Rowan’s face worked effortlessly, carving my outline and stitching me back together. 

My body was a brand new copy of the me before the crash. 

I even saw the coffee stain on my shirt. The smear of pen I’d drawn on the back of my hand when I was bored in class.

I felt nothing. Like I was made of stars. 

Hollow.

Something was missing, though, a cavern in my mind beginning its purge.

Do you know when you wake up from a dream, and it slips away as you regain consciousness?

That’s what it felt like. Like everything which had happened, the crash, everything Rowan said—was a dream.

Once I felt more like myself, and when my fingertips could touch real objects, wet gravel and grass, my own skin, I shakily got to my feet. I found my old body at the side of the road. I’d bled out, just like I thought. My eyes were still wide open, still struggling to name that constellation. 

When I crawled over to it, I couldn’t resist, grasping hold of her hand, only to get a flash. Like I was seeing her POV. 

She was my old body’s memories. I saw Rowan’s expression, his skin splintering apart, his eyes filled with moonlight. 

I saw him struggling with the wheel, and then the crash. Letting go of her ice-cold hand, I let out a sharp breath, her memories flashing out of existence. I didn’t have time to think about what I’d seen—about the questions piling in my skull, taking over my thoughts. 

Rowan was still in the car, his body twisted like a pretzel, my roommate’s head smashed against the wheel spattered with gore, his brain leaking from his ears. 

“Rowan.”

I stopped shaking him when I realized his spine had snapped, his body more liquid than solid. 

When I felt for a pulse, it was still there, but faint, as sharp red pooled around him, sticking to his hair and drenching his skin and clothes. His head lolled to the side, and I saw and *felt* that final breath escape his lips. When I crawled out of the wreck of his car, I dropped onto my knees. 

There it was again. 

This time it was louder, completely unmistakable. The sound of a photograph being taken.

When that light filled my eyes once again, I turned away from the car wreck, blinking through intense light. It was at the back-end of that sound, the sound of a photo snapping reality and stealing away a moment, when I glimpsed the body seemingly bleeding into existence right in front of me. Like a polaroid coming to life. 

Stumbling over to him, I found Rowan curled into himself, and like me, he was made up of static, which became flesh, which became skin, spreading across him, making a perfect copy, an exact replica of the dead guy in the wreck. 

He was beautiful, like a shadow coming to life, a sketch bleeding into a human. 

Hesitantly, I reached out and brushed dark curls out of the way, hair which was still shadows and shapes seeping into  contorted reality. This time the number 3 was carved into his skin—and by the look of it, the number was fresh, only just coming into existence. 

Did my asshole roommate just *respawn*? 

After a moment of just… watching him, watching my roommate be brought to life, his chest rising and falling, eyelids flickering, lips parting, I got a hold of myself and tried to grab him. 

But when I was sure my hands had made contact with him, flesh with flesh, something smashed into the back of my head, and stars filled my vision. 

I hit the ground, barely physical. Which made me easier to capture. 

I was being dragged, my bare arms burning across rough concrete, before a shadow was looming over me, something cold suffocating my nose and mouth. In the corner of my eye, I glimpsed an adult figure lifting  Rowan into their arms, his body still flickering in and out of existence. 

Before I could cry out, I was forced to inhale, choking on what smelled like lemons. 

Before my body went limp, and I allowed myself to be dragged into the pitch dark.",1,1727925129.0,Malliem,0,1.0,False

In June 2024 I noticed I felt a bit dizzy. It progressively got worse and I went to the ER where they diagnosed me with BPPV. During this whole month I felt absolutely horrible. Like I thought I was dying. All I could do was sleep the dizziness away which made me weak. I even used a walking cane while walking around the house because I was so dizzy. I attempted to go to Walgreens and the floor felt like it was moving like I was on a boat. There were plenty more symptoms that went along with all this. Especially anxiety. I haven’t been alone inside a store since Walgreens because it was such a scary experience. But I noticed as time has went by my dizziness isn’t as bad. Since June I have been to an ENT who said I actually have Vestibular Vertigo. I went to physical therapy where they thought it was coming from poor posture (my neck). We did some exercises which actually seemed to help. I’ve also been taking my iron pills and magnesium every day. I have also just decided I was just going to get up and do things I used to do and suffer through it. Fast forward to today, I’m still dizzy here and there and occasionally get migraines. But i’ve noticed my symptoms aren’t as bad. Oh I also quit coffee. Just decaf now. Is this something that eventually gets better? Could I possibly cure myself somehow? 🤷🏻‍♀️ I still have an MRI scheduled so I’ll have more answers soon I guess. ",2,1727924963.0,VestibularMigraines,1,1.0,False

We bought a 2/2 SFH several years ago and are looking to expand our house. It’s not the perfect neighborhood or school district but it’s a great proximity for commute, restaurants, coffee shops, nature and pretty much everything else we like. Assume we’d stay in the house another 5-7 years. 

The conventional knowledge here has always been it’s cheaper to sell and buy the house you want but candidly buying a 3/2 in our area would double our mortgage generally with interest rates now vs when we bought. 

So our options are 

- do nothing and save
- add on <200 sq ft, finance minimal, lose a little backyard and gain an extra bedroom 
- sell the house and double our mortgage 

The last option doesn’t really make sense. We can’t afford to increase our mortgage that much. 

Curious what Bay Area real estate people think of this … and what questions you’d ask yourself before doing this.

Worth the experience, but not something I want to continue doing. I've had 92M on my mind for awhile, it seems cool, definitely the most interesting MOS I've seen.

1fuy5yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1fuy5yi/just_looking_for_some_advice/,Just looking for some advice ,"I, 20M, have seemingly had a bout of GERD that started around 2 months ago. I had been eating really unhealthy and at poor times (graveyard shifts) and probably in a way damaged my stomach. Around 2 months ago, started having horrible reflux, stomach/rib pains, etc. I could barely eat anything besides white bread and rice for the better part of 2 weeks. My PCP originally thought it was gastritis and seemed to not make much of a deal about it, but being a little health paranoid I got some labs done (blood work, chest/abdominal xray) and everything was normal. I got on 20mg Prilosec daily after a week of not feeling better on Pepcid. Thankfully the prilosec seemingly made my stomach much better. I stopped taking the Prilosec about 2 weeks ago (6 week trial) and with watching my diet, I'm like 99.999% back to ""normal"". My last residual symptoms are just burping after eating, having some minor stomach aches, and very occasionally a little relfux if I eat the wrong thing. I'm slowly introducing new things (in moderation) back into my diet, but have been still eating mostly right (im trying to work out/be healthier so i should anyway).  I can eat pretty much whatever I want with a little tums/pepto bismol but still have a few weird symptoms (globus, rib cage pain with no burning just a dull ache). Is this normal/long term for you guys too? Also it seems like this came on out of nowhere, ive gotten acid reflux before but it was never to this degree and im hopeful the fact ive improved significantly and seem to be doing okay now without the PPIs. 

Its also funny that some things cause it that I wouldn't expect to and other usualy triggers are fine. Coffee? Fine on my stomach. I had a little bit of frozen tyson rotisserie chicken? Horrible heartburn for a whole night. I also have seasonal late summer/fall allergies and sometimes the symptoms overlap with gerd. 

I guess my question is, keep doing what I'm doing and I'm turning the corner on this?",1,1727924355.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

1fuy5b7,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1fuy5b7/finally_met_one_my_own_age/,"finally met one, my own age!","So I’m 25F, I knew I wanted to be CF since I was 14. I never liked kids, I have a lot of older siblings some of them in their 30s with multiple children of their own, interacting with my nieces and nephews spark nothing in me. I never thought babies were adorable, never had a blimp of a baby fever. Among my peers, if I ever declare my desire to be CF most people are pretty accepting of it. It’s usually a “as you should” or a little “pop off queen” or even a “in this economy? Understandable” and the conversation is over. BUT! I finally met a girl at work! My own age, at 25, who just could not accept that I plan to remain CF!! I usually don’t bring this conversation up voluntarily but it was 3 of us women working and talking about BC naturally led to my thoughts on a CF life. I explained that I just never had the desire and I am very uncomfortable around children. I also shared that I think a lot of young adults think of family and fulfillment interchangeably. When adults settle into their life financially and in their career they seek fulfillment elsewhere and instead of looking into themselves, they think bringing a new life into the world will bring them fulfillment and purpose, which I don’t agree with and i think is selfish. My coworker was having none of it. I concluded with my final thought that, life will always be full of regrets and I would much rather regret not having kids than regret having kids. She would just NOT let it go! Her ONLY arguments against me were “but you’re so young you never know!” And “you might change your mind soon” or even a “you just need to meet the right partner” (after I’ve mentioned I’m perfectly happy and healthy in a committed relationship with a partner who is also in on being CF). She had NOTHING to argue against my points. And the onnnnly way she dropped the conversation was after I mentioned that being foster parents for older kids might be something I want to look into in the far future once I’m financially stable. 

Just for additional background, we work together in a kitchen for a coffee shop in a very rich neighborhood, where a lot of our clientele during the weekdays are stay-at-home moms. Mothers like to sit at our cafe with their kids and their other mom friends to have a coffee and a snack during the day and relax….except…. They are never relaxed. They are exhausted, they are spending most of their day wrangling their 4 toddlers they birthed back to back,  they are busy yelling at their kids, and busy yelling at their idiotic husbands who have no clue how to interact with or control their own children. We as workers often have to clean up messy tables, sticky windows, knocked over plants, and messed up menu boards after the toddlers storm around in the cafe and the moms apologetically retreat from the store. Our kitchen is downstairs with thin ceilings so our workday is often interrupted by the sounds of children running around, screaming, crying and stomping all over the floors and we can hear their mothers chasing after them. I just found it baffling that my coworker who is the same age as me, coming from a similar financial situation as me, working the same job as me witnessing the same messy lives of mothers, just could not let go of the fact that I decided to be CF.",6,1727924293.0,childfree,2,1.0,False

I’m going through a weird period of life where my world has kind of been shaken and flipped upside down - I’m going through a divorce and moving home with next to nothing, starting over, etc.

My family is in Idaho, and I have a few long distance friends, but with this divorce obviously comes the challenge of losing friends.

I want to make new friends, some good girl friends, meet like minded people, etc. I’m rediscovering myself and excited to do so. :)

I’m 30F (not interested in dating for a while obvs). I love my dog and spend a lot of time with him! I would love dog park dates. I also love hiking, outdoorsy adventures, trails/walks, camping, fishing, paddle boarding, swimming, skiing, traveling/road tripping. I’m into gaming (console & PC), edm festivals and shows, rock concerts (warped tour 2025 anyone???), the gym, art. I am very passionate about art and would like to find art communities (paint nights, drawing get togethers, pottery, photography, etc). I’m a big nerd in the department of Japanese culture, anime, and fantasy related lore. I’m also really passionate about the body mod industry, specifically tattooing. I love street and nature photography, I love walks around town, hitting up local cafes (LOVE a good conversation over a cup of coffee) and bars (not a big bar hopper, but the experience of trying new places is nice from time to time). I love to explore and kick rocks basically haha. I love hosting holidays and bbqs. Generally I’m pretty introverted and can be quiet, but I like to have fun too.

I don't want to consume it , since I believe if there are so many benefits of it , there must be some great downsides of it too. Google says that it's ok to drink a cup everyday.

I don't remember but some week on Friday night I texted her that my junior needed some work who has been struggling to find work for 6 months so she can give some pointers in starting freelancing (she's been doing it for the past 4 years ig). I specifically mentioned that if she's unable to call then even a voicenote would work. She told me it's difficult as she's busy and will call after Tuesday and I was like okay, fine. Sat, sun, mon, Tue passed. I got a text that she's unable to call me, on Wednesday midnight. I was annoyed bt still I replied ""no problem"" and waited for 2 more days, got nothing from her.

Meanwhile I have been seeing her Instagram stories about the books she's been reading with a coffee mug and then next day posted another insta story where she's telling everyone about something like she wants to read every book in the world (mindless blabber). This is where I lost my mind and the rest is history. Even when confronted, the utter disrespect and ""akad"" was the breaking point. My GF was also shocked to know about this.

I am an understanding person bt if you cannot spare 10 minutes in 1 week for someone then being understanding and being a ""chutiya"" has no difference. I did help her at the times in need where she needed some money so that she doesn't get into trouble, or the time where I booked movie tickets from her while I too was busy with something, selecting a tws earphones as she's not a techie etc etc. Now I feel like a total fool for prioritising her.

After blocking, she texted me on Instagram confirming that if I blocked her on Whatsapp to which I did not respond. Mind you, still not a single call from her since 10 days of this shit. Fast forward to now, she has unfollowed me from everywhere and deleted few texts from the chats. 

People actually do not care. All they're trying to do is to not get into trouble. That's what the fuck is wrong. I am not even sure if I'll be trusting/caring for someone else to that extent. Maybe just reciprocation is the answer.",48,1727924109.0,indiasocial,80,0.85,False
