1hcbdji,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1hcbdji/i_problem_i_didnt_know_i_have_chapter_2/,I problem I didn't know I have - Chapter 2,"""Hi, Elie,"" my mom says as I walk into the kitchen. There’s someone sitting at the table, someone I don’t recognize.  

""Good morning,"" I say.  

""This is Mr. Kon,"" Mom says.  

He stands up and shakes my hand. ""How are you?""  

""Good,"" I answer hesitantly. ""What brings you here?""

My mom places a hand on my shoulder. ""Take a seat. I’m preparing some coffee, and I’ll have breakfast ready in a minute.""  

Breakfast? I normally just have a bagel with cream cheese before I head upstairs to start my workday. So why is she making me breakfast?  

I study the man more closely. Maybe in his late forties. His black hat, like a magician's hat, is on the table. He has a leather case next to the chair. Is he some kind of debt collector? Do we even have any debt? I’ll have the business debt paid off next month. Is my mom dating him? ""Gross,"" I mutter.  
But no, that can't be it. I take a seat, my face puzzled.  

""So, Elie, is everything okay with you?"" He asks, turning to me. ""I heard you had a business. Did you have to close recently?""  

I can’t bring myself to say anything. I have no idea what’s going on. This feels like an icebreaker. Is my mom trying to set me up with this guy?  

""I told Mr. Kon about your business,"" my mom says as she pours coffee and hands us each a cup. Then she places a plate with eggs and toast in front of me.  

""He can help you,"" she adds as she sits down.  

My eyes narrow. ""Help me with what?""  

Mr. Kon takes a sip of his coffee. ""I’ve helped many people with problems like this. There’s nothing to worry about.""  

""What problems? The business is closed, and I don’t want to reopen it.""  

""It’s not about that, Elie,"" my mom says. ""You haven’t been yourself lately. You’re not sleeping, you’re not eating well, and you’re not taking care of yourself. You’re angry all the time. This isn’t like you at all.""  

My eyes widen, and I feel betrayed by my mother thinking I have some sort of mental problem. I’ve never told anyone about my struggles. Why would she go out of her way to find a stranger and tell him I can’t sleep? How in the world did she find this person? He’s probably a con artist, maybe someone she met at church.  

I stand up. ""Mom, can you come with me, please?"" I say with a forced smile, managing to keep calm.  

I lead her out of the kitchen into the hallway. ""What are you doing?""  

""I’m trying to help you. You need help, and you never want to accept it.""  

""I don’t need help. I’m figuring this out. I’ll move on soon.""  

""How is it that the business has been closed for over a year, yet you still have all that stuff? You go down there, you look at it. You don’t sleep. I don’t know what’s going on, but this is all you think about all day. I bet.""  

""I don’t... I don’t..."" I sigh. ""Listen,"" my voice is low but confident, ""I don’t need help. There’s no problem. A lot of people don’t sleep. I don’t think this is a problem—it just happens sometimes. It’s not like I don’t sleep every day, and it’s not like I cry about it. I’m totally fine.""  

""Just listen to what he has to say,"" she says. ""I already paid him to come.""  

""You did what?""  

""Yes. He’s a therapist. Now go back in there because I’m paying him for the hour.""  

""I’m grown up, Mom. You can’t just force me to do things.""  

""Just give it a try. Do it for me. I’m really concerned about you. Just listen to what he has to say, and then we’ll never talk about it again.""  

I sigh. ""Fine.""

I regularly rant to my friends about how much I love this subreddit - there are some seriously amazing writers here and the intellectual discourse on minutiae can be so interesting to read. I think the conversations here are amongst the most thoughtful and respectful I've seen on any subreddit, so a sincere thank you to this community!

Now onto my ask: I booked a spontaneous trip to Bangkok for the month of March. On my radar are Sorn and Ore, so I'd love to know if one is strongly preferred to the other. Further:

1. Because this community is so amazing, if there are cheap recs that you enjoy please let me know! I enjoy doing high/low dining when I travel 

2. If anyone will be in Bangkok around those dates, I'd love to share a meal, night out, coffee, or conversation! 

3. I'm heavily debating whether to stay in/near Bangkok the full time or travel around Thailand. Aware the decision is a very personal one, but I would love thoughts if you feel strongly on this.

  
Thank you all! Stay safe and warm :)",1,1733971767.0,finedining,0,1.0,False

First time posting this, here goes.

At the age of 42, I've been told I am socially awkward when it comes to family by my cousin, who we'll call A. It's not Adam.

Before I became a first-time parent in 2022, I always put family first. The ""blood is thicker than water"" bullshit. I was like a milking ATM: flights to visit my sisters, cash gifts for every child they had, any event milestone—you could hear the ATM ringing. My sister got married, and I had to splash out that magic golden egg. Before I continue, let me explain that it wasn't about the gifts. They were expected to show respect in my culture (so fucking wrong), especially considering I was earning only £10.50-£11 per hour for six straight years with no pay rise.

Okay, back to the story. I have two siblings whom I've always tried to help whenever I could.

In January 2022, I became a first-time father. I raced to the hospital like Lightning McQueen when my son was unexpectedly born at 29 weeks (1.3 kg). When I finally brought my bundle of joy home, I expected my family to rush over with gifts and well wishes, but that wasn't the case. Once things settled down, I told my family the great news, but their responses were as lukewarm as a work colleague thanking you for a Zoom invite via text.

I paid for parking that night but parked in a residential area instead of the pay-and-display because it was 1:58 AM, it was dark, and I had bigger things on my mind. I got a parking ticket.

My son needed a tube to help him breathe, which scarred his vocal cords. The hospital was understaffed and overwhelmed. At night, his condition worsened, and he contracted NEC, a serious condition for a healthy baby.

Back to the story.

I received one gift: an embroidered name bathrobe for ages 2-3 from one of my sisters, let's call her B. My other sister, with all her kids and a bundle of my golden eggs, ghosted me on visits but demanded photos and updates as if she was part of my son's life. I tried to share the love at first, but my son's health issues took a toll.

My son spent his first two and a half years in the hospital, undergoing multiple surgeries. He still suffers from croup.

Fast forward to 2022-23, Sister B suggested meeting up to see the baby, but I declined. I wanted to protect my son's privacy, and I didn't want to expose him to the stress of hospital visits.

This December, Cousin A asked if I was going to visit Sister B on Sunday, but I declined because I was still on holiday. I later realized it was a big family gathering.

My upbringing was relatively normal, but I have a couple of siblings who are, let's say, unique.

When I asked my cousin why my sister hadn't reached out, he said I never attended family gatherings. I explained my reasons, but he seemed unconvinced. He even questioned whether she had invited me, which was impossible given my holiday plans.

I supported my cousin when he was struggling, but he now labels me as socially awkward. I'm trying to be civilized and explain that principles and respect matter.

I believe my son's privacy should be respected, and I shouldn't be judged for prioritizing his health. I've gone above and beyond to care for him, even using my annual leave.

Who gives a newborn a garment embroidered with their name for ages 2-3?

Sister A never made any attempt to visit, which is good for my bank balance.

Should I be brutally honest with them or play the happy family game?

Sister B has a good heart, but she's always looked down on me. She's constantly criticized my choices and achievements. Despite her judgment, I've managed to overcome obstacles and build a life for myself.

I feel like I need therapy and a strong cup of coffee.

I just want to be myself and let them assume what they want. My life is too hectic with a toddler to deal with their drama.

1hcb259,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hcb259/my_husband_has_always_wanted_kids_now_that_we/,"My husband has always wanted kids, now that we have one on the way, everything has changed.","Hi, I don't have many to talk to, for the last couple of years I have lost many friends. So l created this throwaway account to share something that has been very difficult for me.

I (29F) live with my husband (31M), we have been together for 5 years now and known each other for many more. People used to say we were meant to be as we were inseparable best friends for many years before we started dating.

I never really knew what I wanted to do with my life and I have been working as a barista for a few years. I was very happy with this job even though it didn't pay much. I had great coworkers and I love talking to customers.
My husband, lets call him Mike, has always knew what he wanted to do. Always had his entire life planned out. Something I used to find very attractive and I was happy to follow him everywhere and help him achieve his goals and dreams.
We have had a great relationship, until everything changed. Mike has been such a great guy, always eager to help out and has shown me what love truly is. I grew up with in a very complicated family that left me feeling unloveable, Mike has proved this to be wrong.
One of the things Mike has always wanted is kids. I have been on the fence about it all, afraid that I might not be a great mother and be able to love it as I should, purely because I wasn't very loved as a child myself. This has been a discussion for years. I have never said directly ""no"" to kids, yet I have expressed my concerns. Mike has always assured me that I would become a great mother.

Now, I am currently 7 months pregnant, I initially did not want to have this child as I did not have a great income and I honestly just wasn't ready. Mike on the other hand became ecstatic when I shared the news. I told him that I didn't feel ready and that there was so many other things I wanted to do before even considering having a child. This really broke his heart. He spent days trying to convince me that our economy is good (he has a very good job and gets payed very well), that I’ll be a great mother and that the timing will honestly never be perfect. So in the end I ended up keeping it. I also quit my job to be a stay at home mom, because we can live comfortably on Mike's payment and it was something that just felt completely right in the moment.

When I was around 4 months pregnant, a change happened in Mike. He became distant and ultimately just stopped helping out at home. He stopped cooking, which was usually something he did as he loved it, he started getting mad when I asked him to take out the trash or do anything else in the house. I ultimately stopped asking him for help because of his attitude towards me and how he increasingly became more and more angry.
I have always enjoyed doing chores as I love a clean house and I feel at peace when I do it. But being pregnant and having a lot of morning sickness and just exhausted all the time, I have really needed his help. For the past 3 months, I have done it all. Laundry, vacuuming, cleaning floors, done the dishes ect. During this time, Mike has withdrawn more and more, at this point all he does is get up, drink coffee without even talking to me, go to work, come home for dinner where he still won't say much and then just go to his office where he will either work, play video games or just watch youtube/ twitch.

I have felt so alone in this pregnancy that it has really started to tear at me. As I said, I don't have many friends and the ones I have lives many hours away, because me and Mike moved due to him getting a great job offer.

The biggest thing happened earlier this week. Mike came home late one night, he had been out with some friends and he was clearly pretty intoxicated. I asked him if he had fun, how much he had to drink and what they did.
This made him fuming, telling me that he doesn't appreciate being interrogated by me. I tried to explain that I just wanted to know about his night out and I honestly just wanted to show interest in his day.
He then started to yell that I was gaslighting him and that he can't even be with friends anymore. I started full on sobbing (damn hormones). He then yelled even louder that I was playing the victim, how I have ruined his life and many more hurtful words that I don't want to repeat. The one thing that really stuck with me was when he said under his breath ""you shouldve aborted it, you'll never be a good mom"".
This made me go into a rage fit where I yelled back at him, and tried to tell him how I have been feeling for the last few months. In hindsight, a bad time to take it up, but I was just so emotionally exhausted, angry and sad.
One thing lead to another and he picked up a lamp and chucked it at me, it hit my stomach and I have never felt such intense pain and fear in my life.
I ended up having to call an ambulance and left by myself, Mike didn’t even look in my direction when I left. Luckily everything looked good and they kept me for observation overnight just to be sure. Mike didnt show up at all.

When I came home, everything was cleaned, like nothing ever happened. On the kitchen sink there were flowers and chocolates with an apology letter. Still, Mike has refused to talk about the incident and has been keeping his distance. He leaves to work before I even get up and he comes back even later than usual, to the point where he just goes straight in the shower and then goes to sleep in the guest bedroom. Not even saying anything to me at all.

What do I do? It’s been a few days now and I just feel so unsure and overwhelmed. I cannot just leave him, as I’ll be left pregnant with nothing. We signed a prenup and basically everything is his, except for my car. I don’t have anywhere to live if I decide to leave and I no longer have a job.
The problem is that I don’t feel comfortable and safe about raising a child with him if this is how it’s going to be. I cannot let my child grow up in a broken home.

So l created this throwaway account to share something that has been very difficult for me.

I (29F) live with my husband (31M), we have been together for 5 years now and known each other for many more. People used to say we were meant to be as we were inseparable best friends for many years before we started dating.

I never really knew what I wanted to do with my life and I have been working as a barista for a few years. I was very happy with this job even though it didn't pay much. I had great coworkers and I love talking to customers.
My husband, lets call him Mike, has always knew what he wanted to do. Always had his entire life planned out. Something I used to find very attractive and I was happy to follow him everywhere and help him achieve his goals and dreams.
We have had a great relationship, until everything changed. Mike has been such a great guy, always eager to help out and has shown me what love truly is. I grew up with in a very complicated family that left me feeling unloveable, Mike has proved this to be wrong.
One of the things Mike has always wanted is kids. I have been on the fence about it all, afraid that I might not be a great mother and be able to love it as I should, purely because I wasn't very loved as a child myself. This has been a discussion for years. I have never said directly ""no"" to kids, yet I have expressed my concerns. Mike has always assured me that I would become a great mother.

Now, I am currently 7 months pregnant, I initially did not want to have this child as I did not have a great income and I honestly just wasn't ready. Mike on the other hand became ecstatic when I shared the news. I told him that I didn't feel ready and that there was so many other things I wanted to do before even considering having a child. This really broke his heart. He spent days trying to convince me that our economy is good (he has a very good job and gets payed very well), that I’ll be a great mother and that the timing will honestly never be perfect. So in the end I ended up keeping it. I also quit my job to be a stay at home mom, because we can live comfortably on Mike's payment and it was something that just felt completely right in the moment.

When I was around 4 months pregnant, a change happened in Mike. He became distant and ultimately just stopped helping out at home. He stopped cooking, which was usually something he did as he loved it, he started getting mad when I asked him to take out the trash or do anything else in the house. I ultimately stopped asking him for help because of his attitude towards me and how he increasingly became more and more angry.
I have always enjoyed doing chores as I love a clean house and I feel at peace when I do it. But being pregnant and having a lot of morning sickness and just exhausted all the time, I have really needed his help. For the past 3 months, I have done it all. Laundry, vacuuming, cleaning floors, done the dishes ect. During this time, Mike has withdrawn more and more, at this point all he does is get up, drink coffee without even talking to me, go to work, come home for dinner where he still won't say much and then just go to his office where he will either work, play video games or just watch youtube/ twitch.

I have felt so alone in this pregnancy that it has really started to tear at me. As I said, I don't have many friends and the ones I have lives many hours away, because me and Mike moved due to him getting a great job offer.

1hcb0ow,https://www.reddit.com/r/g_s_revengance/comments/1hcb0ow/new_commitment/,New Commitment ,"The arkonok steak that she had bought that very afternoon was almost ready. Kezale stood over her simple nano-wave stove, moving the heavy pan back and forth. Her home was simple, one bedroom and one bathroom with the living room and the kitchen being one in the same. Perfectly cozy enough for her, having lived there since she had moved out of home to follow her dreams and all that. Tonight it was not just going to be her however for she was having company. She had spent a large portion of the evening not cooking but rather cleaning because of that.  It was practically more pristine then the day she had moved in. The only thing that was not ready was herself.

There were several loud bangs on the old durasteel door and Kezale's heart skipped a beat, leaving her head spinning around quickly towards the door. He was early. She had only ever known him to be completely on time, never too early and never ever late either. Kezale still needed to do her hair again and put on the outfit that was still sitting unused on her bed. She looked back towards the darkness that was her bedroom. There was a light sigh,  hardly any time to think about any of that now. She began to approach the door, her bare feet making the wooden floor creak with nearly every second step that Kezale took. She made sure that her comfortable housecoat was buttoned up, with it wrapped firmly around her considerably small waist. She had reached the door when there was another knock, more loudly that time. Kezale pressed the button to open the thing and it slid into the wall with minimal effort, extremely quiet too, thankfully as she had only gotten it fixed recently. With a bit of help of course.

""Oh, my apologies."" The man, who was only a year older than her, said genuinely. Clearly referencing the second set of knocks. ""I hadn't the slightest idea whether or not one had heard me the first time.""

The Crown Prince of Onderon stood before Kezale on the assorted stone path that led up to her home. The neighborhood outside was unsavory, a single lane road separating the houses on either side of the street. Though it was much more like a massive footpath, nobody owned a landspeeder around here. Largely because few people had the financial means to do so but otherwise because everything in the community was so close together.  The only ones that ever came past were those belonging to the military and Tolvar's personal landspeeder, which took up a quarter of the road behind him. It was an open top craft with only two seats. One for him and one for the guard that stood behind him in plain clothes. Kezale found his piercing blue eyes unsettling to say the least. An elegant white blaster pistol with gold accents was sitting exposed from his coat. It would have been worth a couple months of her wages easily.

""You could have given me more time."" Kezale stated, leaning herself against the door arch. The outside world was so dead, nobody was normally out after dark unless it was very important. ""I would have looked so good to you.""

""Well... we could always drive about for a time and come back some minutes later."" Tolvar laughed, that jovial laugh that she had become so accustomed to. The one that she loved ever so much. ""No, truthfully, I wanted to come this afternoon ever so much after missing you at your performance this week. Unfortunately my royal obligations would not allow such a thing to transpire, I've only been allowed to slip away this past hour.""

""I understand. The only thing I care about is that you're here now."" She smiled, it was so thoughtful that he wanted to spend the whole night with her, even if it ended up not being possible. He rarely missed an opportunity to see her after a show but when he did he never stopped trying to make it up to her. She kissed him on the cheek facing her, staring into her eyes. Everything else seemed so distant, the guard included.

""You are ever so sweet, my dear. One must thank you for your understanding."" He returned the kiss, his head gracefully tilting down to perform the deed on her forehead. Before he knew it he was suddenly being dragged into the premises by both hands. His head turned the other way. ""Be a good sport and look after the landspeeder would you, Venjon?""

Venjon had not the time to nod to his charge before Kezale punched the button next to the door with her fist, shutting the door behind her lover. It was just them now, she knew that Tolvar preferred it that way. He had people that would lay down their lives for him, kill for him if need be but what Kezale and he had together was between them. Certainly not anybody from the Royal Palace. Tolvar had only acquiesced when his head of security had suggested just one guard for his more private ventures. The prince has handpicked Venjon because he was quiet, unlikely to let anybody know what he was up to. He appreciated it. Kezale began unhooking the chain connecting his flowing cape to his person, removing it before she hooked it back together and hung it on her coat holder on the opposite side of the door right next to her fur coat that Tolvar had bought. It felt completely natural to Tolvar, having his personal valet at the Royal Palace. It was different when Kezale did it however, much more intimate in a way that he could not explain with words.

""I cannot help but say that you always look good to me. One could never stress that enough if they tried,"" Tolvar took her gently by the wrist as she walked past him, gracefully spinning her around in his direction before he took both of her hands into his. Tolvar seemed far more open to talking about his feelings when the two of them were alone. ""Kezale, I would not have you any other way. Your beauty comes from your authenticity, that is what matters to me most of all.""

""Thanks. I think that you're pretty authentic yourself."" Kezale looked up to him, her cheeks blushing a bright red. He was a tall man as his sister was a tall woman. She could not help herself, perhaps she did not want to, as she pecked his lips. She had missed that, being with him. He had been so busy lately, all she wanted to do was to make this night special for them both. Part of the reason why she had wanted everything to be perfect earlier. ""I really should go check on how your dinner's going. Make yourself at home!""

""What is one having for dinner if one might be so inclined?"" Tolvar asked. He strolled over to the living area, his boots making the floor creak. It was a simple space with an upholstered two seat sofa and two modest armchairs. All of them were considerably dated and older looking, as was the coffee table between them that bound the space together. A small side table sat next to one of the armchairs. He elegantly sat down that chair as he threw his right leg over his left thigh, hands together in his lap while proceeding to lean back into the seat. Kezale had to let him buy her some new furniture, Tolvar thought. He would have her living like a princess if she so allowed him. The smell of the food was prevalent now with the door closed. ""Something to do with arkonok I must assume.""

""That's right, arkonok steak!"" Kezale knew that he had hunted it for entertainment before, he had told her that much, but she was unsure if he had ever eaten it like this before. The steak looked like it was almost ready as she pressed on one of her cupboards, the sizzle beneath being extremely notable while juices were shooting off into the pan around it. She took out a utensil, lifting it out of the pan after the stove had been shut off and onto a plate. ""They told me that it was freshly hunted, but I guess you'll be the judge of that.""

""A steak? That hardly sounds cheap, my dear."" A picture caught Tolvar's eyes as he spoke, one that he had not seen when he had last been around, sitting on the side table next to him. It was Kezale and her ballet trope, with her standing proudly dead center. Her auburn hair was firmly straightened. By the stars did she look skinny in her ballet kit, without her housecoat to offset it, many of the other ladies did too he noticed but she did especially. His vision shifted back to her in an instant. ""Surely you must allow me to reimburse you for such a thing?""

""No need, it's me that's meant to be treating you tonight. Not the other way around."" Kezale responded politely. He had a habit of doing that, offering to pay for things that she did not want him to. It did grow somewhat tiresome at times, but it was sweet to have somebody that cared about her in that way even if it was not always wanted. ""I need to be able to pay for the things I need to survive. Call it pride if you want.""

Tolvar seemed to drop the topic entirely, which seemed to please her.  Kezale took a bottle of wine out of the cooling chamber. It wasn't old or anything, in fact she had only bought it from the market that afternoon with the steak but she thought that it would be nice to give Tolvar at least some of the lifestyle he was accustomed to. She began to reach up to the upper most cupboards to grab a couple of glasses but there was already a hand going for it. Tolvar had stood up and strolled over to help, taking a glass with both hands. He placed them on the bench and Kezale poured the red liquid into them after screwing the lid off like a true team.

Tolvar picked up the plate with the steak on it, the divine smell penetrating his nostrils with ease. He could not wait to get stuck into it. He followed Kezale, who was holding a glass in each hand, towards the table. It was rectangular in shape, able to fold up against the wall when she required the extra living space. Handcrafted wooden chairs sat around it, two on both sides. Tolvar had gotten them for her too after she said something about one of the ones in her last set being unsafe, even matching the color her table was. They were so ornate, she loved them, but she would have preferred to get her own ones for cheaper even if they looked more ugly. Part of her liked buying her own things.

It was always awkward when she had to explain where her jewelry, fashion and even furniture came from. The girls in her ballet trope had some idea, they were always together after pretty much every show, but her family? She hated lying to them, a secret admirer. She was surprised she was still able to get away with that. There was so much in her home that he had bought for her.

""Well... I must say that it is my meal so it only seems right."" Tolvar had been wondering what Kezale had made herself for dinner but then he saw a salad sitting down in front of her usual chair. Needless to say he was worried, his eyebrow raising subtly. He could only come to the conclusion that she was not eating again. The topic of the conversation quickly changed as he pointed towards the salad. ""Is that all you are eating this evening My dear, surely you must  have more than that somewhere.""

""I....I'm not really hungry tonight."" Kezale placed the glasses on either side of the table for them both before she pulled out her chair and sat down, sticking her fork into her salad as she struggled to maintain eye contact with Tolvar. She never was a good liar, for as long as he had known her. ""I was out and about with a friend from ballet the other day and I had a really big lunch.""

""Kezale, when was the last time you ate a proper filling meal?"" Tolvar saw right through her, sitting himself down directly across from her. He used his fork to hold his steak in place as he cut through it with the generously sharp knife that Kezale had provided His movements with the utensils were as elegant as the ones he would use when dining with a foreign dignitary.  ""Dare I ask if it was the last time that we were together some weeks ago now.""

""I weighed myself after our lunch that day and I was over where my director says that I should be."" Kezale replied, taking a sip from her glass of wine. She was looking at Tolvar again now, her usual confidence returning as a result of finally telling the truth. ""This is only temporary, until I get back to that desired weight again. I promise.""

""Desired by you, or that insufferable director?"" Tolvar asked, devouring the piece of the steak that he had cut off for himself in a single bite. Tolvar could have that disgusting little man removed with the drop of a hat. As a patron of the arts, he had high level contacts in the ballet industry. He said nothing, however, not wanting to scare Kezale. ""What might happen when you make an attempt to perform those legendary feats of jumping you are so proficient at and your thin legs give out when you touch the ground during a show? I very much doubt he would simply let you keep your position.""

""That's never going to happen, promise. I've got the opportunity of a lifetime on my hands."" Tolvar knew better than anybody, aside from maybe her parents, that all she had wanted to do since she was a little girl was to dance. Her poor parents had invested so much into her, starting from taking her to classes as a child. Her practice was often more important then her going to school as she grew older. She grabbed something from her salad bowl, forgoing her knife for her hands, before she chomped it down. ""Hundreds, even thousands, are lining up to take my place. If I lose my chance, I'm never getting another shot.""

""My dear, you are slowly killing yourself. The only place that you will be dancing, if you continue not to eat, is in a grave. Is that truly what you want? Think of your parents, those who care about you. Would they desire to see you this way?"" Tolvar seemed deadly serious, deliberately blunt in his phrasing and demeanor only because he thought that Kezale needed to hear what he was saying. He cut another piece of his steak, holding it on the edge of his fork for a minute before consuming it. ""Please, just have a bite of one's steak. I implore you.""

""You've never even met my parents. How would you know what they think is best for me?"" When she saw Tolvar holding up that piece of steak, her stomach grumbled. It was loud, Tolvar could certainly hear it from across the table. Perhaps even Venjon could have if the door was open. She had been looking at the piece of food as a homeless person would look at a piece of bread. Kezale blushed embarrassingly but the jig was very much up. The ballerina seemed to relent. ""Fine, if it'll make the Crown Prince of Onderon happy, I'll have a couple bites.""

Tolvar's lips curled into quite the large smile. However as he was about to push his plate over towards the middle of the table Kezale pushed her chair out from the table, standing up as she began to stroll around the table towards his side. Tolvar pushed his chair out slightly, looking up at her as she stood over him the only way she ever could. She maneuvered herself between the table and his torso, sitting herself on his lap. Kezale grabbed the fork that she had been using, along with taking Tolvar's steak knife when he gave it to her to use. She cut a small bit off from the opposite side, the one that he had not been eating from, before chomping it down rather quickly. She was so hungry that she cut off another bit. It was just so tasty.

""My mother has become quite set on the idea of finding myself a wife as it were."" Tolvar started to caress Kezale's hair, his hand weaving gracefully through her curls as he leaned back into his seat to give her some extra room. ""I do not care for any of those noble families hurling their daughters at me for power after they fought so long to deny me my birthright. Oh if you could meet them, they are the most self serving individuals imaginable. I desire to make us official. Of course it will be a long road ahead but one has never been above hard work.""

""Are you sure that I'm not just some phase?"" She asked curiously. This was always meant to be a short term thing until he did in fact find himself a wife. She had come to terms with that long ago, even if she did not exactly agree with it. Kezale knew what he meant by a long road, that she would most likely have to give up dancing professionally eventually. She had never even thought of getting pregnant before, her career did not allow it. His father had been so accepted because he was a well known politician, but she was just a nobody in their eyes. Somebody that had seduced their Crown Prince some might say. ""I'm not exactly princess material, Tolvar.""

""My dear, that is exactly why I am so fond of you. I would not dare change a thing about you."" Tolvar said, planting a kiss on her cheek as he continued to run his hand delicately through her hair. ""Do you think I was born knowing how to be a prince? No of course not but one can learn all those procedures and things quite easily. However, nobody can simply teach somebody to have a certain personality. I want to be with you.

""I want to be with you too."" The words escaped her lips without her even realizing at first but she did not make an effort to retract them in the slightest. She dropped the utensils, wrapping her arms around the back of Tolvar's neck as she planted the longest kiss she possibly could on his lips, nestling herself into his shoulder.""

""Marvelous. Of course we must go somewhere publicly to celebrate our new found status, one week where you do not have to attend rehearsals. I can clear my schedule for the Council of Nobles easily enough, delegate my vote to a trusted ally so to speak."" He seemed to be deep in thought for a moment, his hand shifting from her hair to his chin. ""Have you heard of a resort world called Spira?""

She had not. Kezale had only ever been off world once as a gift from her parents after finishing her schooling but she did not care where they went together, only that they were in fact together. That was all she wanted, they could figure out the specifics later. Tonight all she wanted to do was celebrate with him.

I ended up having to call an ambulance and left by myself, Mike didn’t even look in my direction when I left. Luckily everything looked good and they kept me for observation overnight just to be sure. Mike didnt show up at all.

When I came home, everything was cleaned, like nothing ever happened. On the kitchen sink there were flowers and chocolates with an apology letter. Still, Mike has refused to talk about the incident and has been keeping his distance. He leaves to work before I even get up and he comes back even later than usual, to the point where he just goes straight in the shower and then goes to sleep in the guest bedroom. Not even saying anything to me at all.

What do I do? It’s been a few days now and I just feel so unsure and overwhelmed. I cannot just leave him, as I’ll be left pregnant with nothing. We signed a prenup and basically everything is his, except for my car. I don’t have anywhere to live if I decide to leave and I no longer have a job.
The problem is that I don’t feel comfortable and safe about raising a child with him if this is how it’s going to be. I cannot let my child grow up in a broken home.
Am I totally overreacting or should I be genuinely concerned about me and my baby’s wellbeing?",1,1733970640.0,whatdoIdo,9,1.0,False

Here's an example. I met a woman from a dating app over the weekend for a coffee date, and it went great. We stayed for 3 hours just chatting. Every day since we texted back and forth, but today she left me on ""read"" and hasn't texted once.

I did all the prep for the machine before pulling my first shot. I weighed out 18g’s of beans that were not new new but no older than a month old from an unopened bean bag from a local coffee shop. I ground them at the 15 setting in the encore. I used a WDT tool on the beans in the portafilter, using the *not* duel wall basket.  Tamped it with decent pressure, hit double shot and basically it took 15 seconds just to start dripping out individual drops of espresso very very slowly.

Cut to today, it’s been 4 days, I’ve tried every different version of pulling a shot and the only way I can get a shot to come out smoothly is grinding my beans at the 20-24 setting on the encore, which doesn’t seem right.

I spent an hour on the phone with breville and they said the machine seems sounds based on tests we did, but I just don’t believe that it’s normal to have to do a super course 20-24 setting on my beans in order to pull a shot. (The person on the phone was extremely nice but said that it’s normal to have to grind at 20-24 for espresso on the encore which breville technically owns) 

Breville very kindly is sending me different beans to try and see if anything changes but because I’m impatient I went and got new 15 day old beans at a specialty coffee shop today and pulled a shot and same issue arose, I had to grind extremely course.

It’s possible that I’m just misguided but something doesn’t seem to be adding up based on my research.

Flaring on the limbs with the occaisional moderate flare facing us, mostly impulsive, mostly non eruptive, and boring. I felt like I should get an update out anyway since its been a few days. It is also worth noting that the M6.4 from yesterday did produce a CME that may have had some earthward directed ejecta, but if so, not very much. Let's take a look.

**SUMMARY**

As noted above, solar activity remains fairly uneventful with the occaisional big flare but of the impulsive variety thus far. However, since 12/10 the x-ray has been quite a bit busier and has produced 6 solar flares between M1 - M6.7 in magnitude. This of course follows the X2 on 12/8 but from then until 12/10 the x-ray was quiet with a single M1 flare. So there is reason to be a little encouraged we may continue to see an uptick in activity, but temper expectations. AR3917 has decayed a bit over the past few days but is holding steady. AR3920 is putting on size quite nicely over the 36 hours with modest complexity and the result has been 6 C-Class flares and 2 M-Class flares in the last 24 hours. I really hoped that it was this region responsible for the M6 today. It's challenging to evaluate sunspot development without SDO. The GONG images we are using are not video and are taken several hours apart. As a result, the only way I can feasibly evaluate sunspots without a ton of legwork is on the [spaceweatherlive.com](http://spaceweatherlive.com) sunspot regions section where you can see side by sides of current and the days prior. It will do for now.

The 10.7cm SFI remains elevated despite modest sunspot activity so there remains an elevated baseline of activity but it just has not equated to flaring. Our coronal hole stream wound down overnight. Maybe coincidence, but as the effects subsided, the seismicity sharply declined back down to baseline levels with only 3 earthquakes over magnitude 5 in the past 24 hours after a few days between 8-20 M5+ quakes including some noteworthy shakes in Alaska, California, and Nevada among other places. We still have two coronal holes present which may cause some solar wind enhancement in the next few days, but the coronal holes we have now are far less imposing than the week prior. We have a few plasma filaments in geoeffective locations should they decide to erupt. Here is imagery and then your geomag forecast and something very cool

**GEOMAGNETIC SUMMARY/FORECAST**

The last several days have seen unsettled to active conditions primarily due to the coronal hole stream and reached active conditions (kp4) once in the last 72 hours. It is possible there were some minor enhancements from the eruptive activity that took place on 12/8 but they were not substantial to present as obvious in the solar wind data. As mentioned in the intro, it does appear that the M6.4 produced a CME with the possibility minor earth directed component as I will show you in the coronagraph below. Frankly its a stretch to even call it a halo, but we did see ejecta on both N and S of the disk. It was not modeled by NASA or NOAA as anything of note and I agree but just in case, I figured it best to tell you about it. CME Scorecard did receive some entries and they estimate Kp2-Kp4.

**Do We Really Know Aurora? Who the hell is STEVE?**

**I am about to blow your mind. Grab a cup of coffee..**

I read a very interesting article the other night and I feel compelled to share it with you. The article is titled [Sky Lights Called STEVE Are Challenging What We Know About Auroras](https://www.earth.com/news/mystery-lights-called-steve-are-challenging-what-we-thought-we-knew-about-auroras/) and is from earth.com. STEVE is not a traditional aurora and the acronym stands for ""Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement"". It was officially discovered in 2016 but likely existed long before it and was just never delineated from regular aurorae. Before I continue, I need to make it perfectly clear that we do not understand aurora comprehensively. This nature.com study sums it up very nicely in their introduction.

*""While the aurora has attracted attention for millennia,* ***important questions remain unanswered. Foremost is how auroral electrons are accelerated before colliding with the ionosphere and producing auroral light. Powerful Alfvén waves*** ***are often found traveling Earthward above auroras with sufficient energy to generate auroras, but there has been no direct measurement of the processes by which Alfvén waves transfer their energy to auroral electrons.*** *Here, we show laboratory measurements of the resonant transfer of energy from Alfvén waves to electrons under conditions relevant to the auroral zone. Experiments are performed by launching Alfvén waves and simultaneously recording the electron velocity distribution. Numerical simulations and analytical theory support that the measured energy transfer process produces accelerated electrons capable of reaching auroral energies.* ***The experiments, theory, and simulations demonstrate a clear causal relationship between Alfvén waves and accelerated electrons that directly cause auroras.""***

There is that name again. The godfather of plasma physics and the plasma universe. You would think at some point, when enough key processes are confirmed by modern science to be built around plasma physics that he would get the recognition he deserves and plasma universe theory would get the attention it deserves but I digress. Let me explain the above paragraph in simple terms. Where does the power come from? The aurora is not just light, its electric. A typical aurora is generting around 8 trillion watts per NASA. Let's get back to STEVE and we will revisit the regular aurora.

The question I commonly encounter from people is what's the difference? I see that it has my dad's name and that it is less common than regular aurora but what gives?

STEVE

* Often found in lower latitudes and outside the aurora oval and is a 25km wide ribbon of hot plasma around 450km up.
* Has a different color spectrum including white/taupe and presents either in a ribbon or pole like structure and often line up in rows called ""picket fence aurora""
* Aligned east-west
* Appear simultaneously in both hemispheres

This list will certainly grow. Ultimately we will never know for sure whether it has always been here in this form but as far as science is concerned, its known about it for less than a decade so the books are still being written as they say. The current held theory by most is that a ribbon of hot gasses breaks through the magnetosphere and into the ionosphere possibly causing nitrogen to interact with oxygen and form glowing nitric oxide. A secondary theory is that its caused by a SAID which stands for ""subaurora ion drift"" or polarisation jet. SAID is also an atmospheric phenomenon driven by perturbation and excitement of the magnetosphere and is also a narrow layer of east to west moving ions but it was not thought to be visible. Basically a really intense SAID is powerful enough to create an optical emission aka STEVE. I have to admit there are some solid points. Let's see what the latest theory has to say and why and I will let Claire Gasque Grad Student Berkeley and Brian Harding Assistant Research Physicist at SSL who co-authored with her say it in their own words from the article and then discuss.

*Gasque thinks that electric fields parallel to* [*Earth’s magnetic field*](https://www.earth.com/earthpedia-articles/earths-magnetic-field-origin-structure-and-impact-on-humanity/) *might be creating the picket fence colors.*

*Traditional auroras come from charged particles streaming down from space and energizing oxygen and nitrogen molecules, producing familiar colors.*

*But Steve’s purple or mauve tones do not match the pattern, and the picket fence appears in latitudes where auroras typically do not form. Gasque sees this as a sign that something else is going on.*

*Gasque’s research shows that a parallel electric field of about 100 millivolts per meter at an altitude of about 110 km could energize electrons enough to* [*produce the observed colors*](https://www.earth.com/news/steve-phenomenon-not-aurora-has-dawn-side-twin-swarm-satellites-discovery/)*.*

*She also points out that this region has special conditions, like reduced plasma density and more neutral atoms. This environment might allow the field to do its work without shorting out.*

*“If you look at the spectrum of the picket fence, it’s much more green than you would expect. And there’s none of the blue that’s coming from the ionization of nitrogen,” Gasque said.*

*“What that’s telling us is that there’s only a specific energy range of electrons that can create those colors, and they can’t be coming from way out in space down into the atmosphere, because those particles have too much energy.”*

*Instead, she said, “the light from the picket fence is being created by particles that have to be energized right there in space by a parallel electric field, which is a completely different mechanism than any of the aurora that we’ve studied or known before.”*

[*Brian Harding*](https://www.ssl.berkeley.edu/full-directory/name/brian-harding/)*, an assistant research physicist at SSL and a co-author on Gasque’s work, appreciates the significance of these findings.*

*“The really interesting thing about Claire’s paper is that we’ve known for a couple of years now that the Steve spectrum is telling us there’s some very strange physics going on,” Harding enthused.*

*“We just didn’t know what it was. Claire’s paper showed that parallel electric fields are capable of explaining this strange spectrum.”*

*The team plans to set their sights first on something called the* [*enhanced aurora*](https://www.earth.com/news/auroras-are-a-visual-warning-of-shocks-to-earths-magnetic-field/)*, which is basically this bright layer that’s embedded in the normal aurora.*

*“The colors are similar to the picket fence in that there’s not as much blue in them, and there’s more green from oxygen and red from nitrogen,” Gasque explained.*

*“The hypothesis is that these are also created by parallel electric fields, but they are a lot more common than the picket fence.”*

*“It’s fair to say that there’s going to be a lot of study in the future about how those electric fields got there, what waves they are or aren’t associated with, and what that means for the larger energy transfer between* [*Earth’s atmosphere*](https://www.earth.com/news/geomagnetic-storms-are-influenced-by-earths-atmosphere/) *and space,” Harding concluded.*

*“We really don’t know. Claire’s paper is the first step in the chain of that understanding.”*

I am sorry to drop so many words on you but if you have made it this far, you aint just killin' time so I will give you the full experience. She says it is time to question old assumptions and look for new answers. These are the people we need folks. They made a model of the ionosphere and tested the hypothesis and that is the beauty of electricity is that it scales so wonderfully. True to form, it generated the hues of STEVE and did so by the proposed mechanism. An electric current from the earth. Not from space. A new paradigm is being born. One where plasma physics and by extension electromagnetism will be given their due and with it, the crown, or should I say corona? Oh yeah, pun intended.

But wait...I told you I would get back to the aurora we know and love. Back to the original nature article about Alfven waves. The title is ""Laboratory measurements of the physics of auroral electron acceleration by Alfven waves"". They argue the following.

*Space weather embodies the study of how variable forcing by the Sun, mediated by the supersonically flowing solar wind, affects the near-Earth space environment*[*^(1)*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR1)*. One of the most spectacular displays of the Sun’s effect on the Earth is the aurora, statistically appearing in an oval-shaped region around the magnetic poles at high latitude*[*^(2)*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR2)*,* ***with manifestations on both the nightside and the dayside.*** *High-energy particles precipitating down along the Earth’s dipolar magnetic field into the auroral ionopshere collisionally excite atoms and molecules*[*^(3)*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR3)*, leading to the auroral emissions with a variety of appearances, from bright discrete arcs, to faint arcs, to diffuse aurora.* ***The differing magnetic local time and morphology of observed auroral events suggests distinct source regions as well as differing mechanisms of generation, with a clear disconnect between dayside and nightside aurora***[***^(4)***](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR4)***.*** ***Three main magnetospheric drivers for the aurora have been identified***[***^(5)***](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR5)***: (i) the precipitation of very energetic magnetosheath particles from the magnetospheric boundary layer on the dayside***[***^(6)***](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR6) ***or plasma sheet electrons on the nightside***[***^(7)***](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR7)***^(,)***[***^(8)***](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR8)***; (ii) quasi-static, field-aligned currents***[***^(9)***](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR9)***^(,)***[***^(10)***](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR10)***; or (iii) energetic electrons accelerated by Alfvénic fluctuations, either as field-line resonances (effectively global-scale standing Alfvén waves in the Earth’s dipolar magnetic field)***[***^(11)***](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR11) ***or Alfvén waves propagating down the field lines towards the auroral ionosphere***[*^(12)*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR12)*^(,)*[*^(13)*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23377-5#ref-CR13)*. For all of these cases, the detailed kinetic plasma physics governing the flow of energy from the outer magnetosphere into precipitating energetic particles remains a topic of ongoing study.*

I am going to greatly simplify that.

When a CME arrives at earth and interacts with the earths magnetosphere generated by the earths magnetic field and generates aurora propagating downward from both poles and the aurora manifests on both the night and day side of earth but it does so differently in magnetic time, source regions, and even mechanism. They go so far as to call it a disconnect. This is puzzling. They then outline the state of theory for aurora. There is particle precipitation that gets through the magnetosheath when a CME arrives that falls to the earth and is supposed to excite the gasses in the air making the colors. Simple gravity makes the particles rain down. They identify quasi-static electric currents aligned with the earths dipolar magnetic field or energetic electrons being accelerated by Alven waves within the magnetic field and mention Alfven waves propagating down the field lines towards the ionosphere which is earth plasma and electric. They note all are being pursued to their end but with no end in sight.

They then list all the evidence for Alfven waves forming in the magnetosphere due to the massive electromagnetic disturbance and then transferring energy down to the ionosphere to excite electrons forming the aurora. They can recreate it in a lab, they can make it work on the ol' spreadsheet, its backed up by observational data, not just on earth, but on all planets. What it really boils down to is this. STEVE made people question whether particle precipitation alone could be responsible for generating such rigid and repetitive structures outside the auroral oval on both hemispheres at the same time and other researchers had been pushing the Alven waves theory to the limit and its passing every test. In that theory, the earths ionosphere especially when coupled with an excited magnetosphere is much more powerful than we would have thought. Their theories rest on field aligned electric currents from the earth itself. Its hard to tell just how far it can scale up. Remember how much energy I told you was in an aurora. The earth is VERY electric. We could see a major shake up in aurora science very soon.

You can't imagine what it means. Truly, it is not something that you just go ""eh, cool"" about and go about your day. This is a big F\*\*\*\*\*\* deal. Don't worry, because I am going to tell you why.

These people and mainstream science are way late to the party. They just had to take the hard way to get there, and boy I am glad they did. Let me tell you about Mr Anthony Peratt and the most commonly inscribed petroglyph in the entire inhabited earth with 100,000s of them on every explored continent. Mr Anthony Peratt is an old man now at 84 years old but was employed at Los Alamos as a plasma physicist. Mr Peratt is a disciple and grad student of Alfven. He is as qualified as a man can get. He noticed something very strange one day. The petroglyphs he had become so fond of had resemblances to his work in plasma physics. Resemblences is putting it too lightly. 100% morphologically similar is more appropriate. No chance coincidence. This glyph was inscribed in more rocks than any other, but there were many archetypes which were replicated in place after place. The owl, the spiral, the bird, the serpent were common, but this one stands out above the rest.

I am going to post this image from an article on [Medium.com](http://Medium.com)

https://preview.redd.it/bqcw9cnorb6e1.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=be1bc69e9d1d2ca1833cbebdb1e5d3cb2abfda73

The top right two and bottom rows are from all around the world inscribed in rock around the same time and the top left two plasma rendetions by doing the exact same process the experiments in the article were doing. Its no mistake. It wasn't aliens. They saw this in the sky. It faced magnetic south and was almost universally found in sheltered places and were chisled deep. This symbol was adoped as a sigil for many tribes and peoples including the Carthagenians and the Dogon tribe of Africa today and has been featured in Graham Hancocks Ancient Apocalypse. This symbol held great meaning and the events surrounding it had profound impacts on the artists and people. I will link Mr Peratts video as I have done before. I will let you do the math on its significance and leave that for another write up. If you made it this far and you have understood what I have just told you, I commend you for your ability to digest a complex and nuanced subject and appreciate you hearing me out but I apologize if I have made you just slighhhhtly uneasy about how you feel about surging southerly aurora and new phenomena being discovered. Did our ancestors record ""enhanced auroral displays"" in the past on stone to be preserved for thousands of years in some cases? The evidence says yes. We now have confirmation from archaeology, the plasma lab, numerical calculation, observation, and logic to support that. The ubiquity of alfven waves, which he theorized but couldnt really observe at the time, is noted. Earth generated electric fields of unimaginable power is noted. Gravity having absolutely nothing to do with it is noted.

Much love for all the support,

It is the first time I came as not as a child/young female/female with a white male (husband)) next to me. I already could presumed that can change the experience up a bit, but I was ready for the true genuineness!

Pros- Hong Kong will always, always be 2nd home to me. I even enjoyed watching elderlies doing their taichi/swords exercises in the morning. I can walk aimlessly down Nathan Road and Sham Shui Po and eat egg puffs and jackfruits and Milk Tea/Coffee ( Yin Yern)  for the whole day and that would be a great day! There is something about Hong Kong. My total accumalative time ( from all trips) spent in HK is less than 6 months.

Cons: People ARE rude and look at you weird if you say jo sun. What makes me very sad/angry is their favoritisms toward Whites and Japanese. To counter that feeling, I've been listening to LMF's 1127 ( it's good, please listen if you haven't). People said its post colonism effect but I don't agree because even the mainlanders do so. 

I think, it's due to what white people symbolize to them ( freedom, bigger houses, more opportunity, usually has money ( white tourists). I was pissed when I couldn't find a Sham Sui Bo Starbucks mug when there was a Lan Kwai Fong one. The Japan/White people favoritism was very apparent before but this time it hits differently (maybe because I'm older now). I think the youngs now are lost and confused and angry and I do not blame them- but I wish there were more self pride. No need to look up to others when Hong Kong itself has so much to offer!

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for nine months but I just feel like our relationship is going nowhere.

I tried to end things twice but both times he convinced me that he would change and things could be better and he begged for another chance. I’ve communicated the same issues to him several times - way too many for a relatively short relationship - and he’s just always the same and it’s just so disappointing and boring and frustrating and exhausting. 

I can feel how much I’m disrespecting myself by putting up with him but I do love him and I’m really lonely and can’t bring myself to properly let him go because I would genuinely have no social life and would be really bored. I hate that I feel like this even though I’ve given him so many chances to change and he won’t. I hate that I’m so pathetically lonely that I will let myself be so continuously treated like this when I know that I deserve better.

Another issue is that I don’t feel like better exists. I clicked with my boyfriend and have felt a connection and ease I hadn’t found with anyone else I’d met. I don’t live somewhere with many romantic prospects, I would see the same people on the apps all the time and they either wouldn’t reply/would ghost after a few messages or weren’t my type, I don’t drink alcohol so wouldn’t meet anyone at a bar, dont smoke/vape so wouldn’t meet someone in the smoking area, don’t have friends outside of work so wouldn’t meet anyone naturally. I work with mostly middle-aged ladies and my hobbies are solitary, I just read, bake, go to the gym, and go out on walks or out for coffee with my mum. I count the ladies I work with and my mum as friends but I have no one my age to hang out with apart from my boyfriend. We get on well and I know I’d miss him if we broke up and that I’d be so bored and alone. 

I just wish he would value me more. I think I’m a good girlfriend - I cook nice dinners and desserts, know lots of cool cafes and restaurants because I used to have a food blog, I take interest in my boyfriend’s day, I listen and remember details and ask questions, I would say I’m reasonably attractive and funny, I care about him, I text him consistently, I’m loyal - when I’ve agreed to a second date with someone I never entertain others and I’ve told him about three instances of other men asking me out (we crossed paths as they worked in different departments at my work), I love spending time together, I’ve never said no to sex with him, I pay for my half of meals out (even though he earns over double my salary), I’ve bought him small gifts (snacks and coffees) when he’s been stressed, I just don’t understand why I’m always second best to him and he can’t treat me like a priority. And I hate that I’m letting him 😔

When I met him I thought I’d found someone who could be right for me but I was clearly wrong. I still believe that he could be if he would just make the very small effort to change his ways. I know you can’t date someone’s potential and you have to see them for what they are but it’s so difficult when you want it to work out.

1hcalo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hcalo4/struggling_with_dating_this_past_year_35m/,Struggling with dating this past year [35M],"To give some context: at the beginning of 2022 I went through a bad break up and I was at a low point with little friendships to help me through it due to moving to a new country and working a lot. I casually dated a few people with some reservations because I still wasn't fully over my ex.

In the autumn of 2022 met a great girl but it was only going to be fwb and it was fun, but I struggled trying not to catch feelings and making this a relationships and I think certain frustrations came out in a negative way, she knew exactly what she wanted and I wasn't sure what I truly needed. At the beginning of 2023 I met someone and it really started to go well; so I had to call it off with my fwb who I was still seeing. I knew it wasn't right if this gets serious.

She worked a typical 9-5 with weekends off and I was the manager of a bar, so my hours and days off (to the best of my ability) wasn't always the most consistent. So trying to spend time with her all the cost a lot of my own me time on my days off and my sleep as well on my late nights. I struggled to communicate all of this and it eventually lead to a lot of disagreements and misunderstandings to where it ended... I also think some of my quams from fwb relationship seeped in as well.

So from the end of summer 2023 to the present I went on a lot of dates, I was in a brief relationship with a girl for short of 3 months, had a couple one night stands met some really amazing people which I was excited for something to start up before being ghosted. To a burn out from my promotion at work to an area manager of multiple bars where I called off dating all together for just over 3 months. And getting  back on the apps have had worst results, I paid for a subscription till mid Christmas season, barely had interest to go on it all for most of the time. Most of the matches have either died or we got the number exchange and then it died. So nothing much as really come from it. Until just recently.

I matched with someone who is in hospitality as well, unfortunately she is in the side if managing coffee shops so her hours are early mornings, where most of mine are evenings. We've been talking for just over six weeks now, we meet once and too my surprise we hooked up on our first meet, which I had no intention to. But some odd things made think that she was hoping for it. We've still been talking on the daily some days more than others. But I recently met up with a friend and he asked to see what she looks like and her WhatsApp photo isn't very clear so I went on the dating app we met on and he scrolled through and I noticed she updated a photo and I felt uneasy since then. We tried to meet up the other day I was able to move around my schedule to match her day off she said don't worry about it, she was going to the dentist and they had to use gas on her due to personal issues so she's usually not 100% for most of the day. We chatted for a bit and by the time the evening hit she went completely radio silence when she was meant to be home, she doesn't usually go that quiet. 

On our first date we talked about being in our 30's and how much of a different struggle it is. And how we can only focus on one at time because our social life is nearly non existent with how busy we can get. And it was great to hear, she's not the biggest social butterfly similar to myself. I know it's early and we haven't even mentioned committments, but with everything, it just feels somethings that shouldn't exist in my 30's? 

But with my confidence at an all time low, and now these random aspects has my already broken trust in people making my mind wonder, when it shouldn't. I feel more lost, uncertain and paranoid then I've ever felt. I went into 2024 thinking I'll try and do better and all it's felt like is one disaster after another.

TL;dr
It's been one confidence break after another and the current girl I've been seeing is making me question so much that I've sunk even lower in my own dread.

1hcaknu,https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/1hcaknu/are_we_reading_the_man_wall_wrong/,Are we reading the man wall wrong? ,"Okay so I could just be clowning but I decided to take a look at the man wall again. If this had been said before then I apologize in advance. I’m pretty new here.

But…. Let’s just say karma is next.

First we have to look at the karma music video! Specifically the coffee cup. Remember it’s a clock.

We see the blue nail on 8 (1989 TV in August). Then the little hands of the clock stuck at 11 (TTPD) and the black nail (REP) at 2.

But if you look at where Taylor is positioned when holding it, her body is positioned at 5 (1989) straight across from 11 (TTPD). It seems that although we are in TTPD, Taylor is still metaphorically stuck at 1989. And only when she released the coffee cup onto the piano, does it click to 12 (karma)

https://preview.redd.it/u15q063yub6e1.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=a10fc8182312e38c79a302ddc1beae9448b9348b

So with all of this in mind, I went to the man wall and traced the path of releases and re-releases. Which would mean we would go up from 1989(white) to 1989 (dark blue) to karma (organge) and then back down to REP & Debut at the end.

We’ve all been thinking it could be a butterfly or an infinity sign guiding us to each re-release but what if it’s not. Because when i traced it, at first it seemed like a random swooping line, but then when i flipped it, it looked like a 2

https://preview.redd.it/b1ttoq6mqb6e1.jpg?width=664&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96dbabc1f41c83fd28a7c42e3ebafe50b90ee820

She has been pointing out the number 2 so many times. Again, this could be nothing but I find it odd that if we follow that track on the man wall, the shape flipped sideways looks like a 2.

Maybe we haven’t gotten an LA post or any 1989 videos because we truly have to go back and get it & Karma to set the timeline straight before debut and rep can come out.

So what if this is the glitch? Before this we had two re-releases, one new album. 2 re-releases, new album. But what if this time the pattern breaks?

  
Just to also go back to Taylor saying she is collecting infinity stones. It makes me think of the ego stone. It was the 7th stone that nemesis created when she split herself into the stones. But the ego stone (the one that held her consciousness) got lost/hidden in another realm/dimension. If this stone represents the lost album we all clown about, then basically in order for nemesis (in this case taylor) to “come back” she needs all the stones, not just the ones we see in the movies.

*""In the comics, there is a seventh Infinity Stone that is hidden in the Ultraverse. When the seventh stone comes into contact with the other stones, it is said to rebirth Nemesis. Some consider the Ego Gem to be the most powerful and dangerous of the Infinity Stones.* *N****emesis split her powers because the Ego Gem's consciousness was at odds with the other Gems.****""*

Do we have to collect those stones in order to leave the woods for real?? because today Taylor nation Tweeted 2 tweets about evermore's 4th birthday and made a cryptic comment saying ""going deeper in the woods today to celebrate."" 

https://preview.redd.it/yvulhqjawb6e1.jpg?width=1320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee6b836c1ee3e682bcc65997cd579aa571372512

When they mention the grid aligning, it made me think of how today, Taylor aligned the yellow brick road on the grid with the rainbow at the end. (goodbye yellow brick road) and how they mentions ""our favourite sister sequel"" sequel being another 2. Two days from now is December 13th Taylor's birthday. 

But then they posted this: 

https://preview.redd.it/i7kyrkh8xb6e1.jpg?width=1320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5757ecf292dc7766a881081d0339524f4960560e

This caught my attention because 3 weeks from today would be new years day. Which was the last song she sang on Vancouver N3 as well as LA N3. 

  
This could mean absolutely nothing and I certainly don't think after everything Taylor has done for us, she owes us more. I am just speaking in terms of the man wall and what could come next with that. These few points caught my attention!! 

Or maybe this is nothing and I’ve fallen too far down the rabbit whole but let me know your thoughts.

Also what questions should I be asking?. This donut shop is located in a smaller town that is growing. It's located in the downtown shops. There are 3 antique stores down there that bring in a lot of traffic. The owner is asking $175k for it turn key and ready to go. She has owned it for a year and already almost tripled the profit from the previous owner.she says she is wanting to retire and has 7 grandkids she wants to spend more time with than running the business alows. She pays herself 60k a year. Her square app shows $150k in sales so far plus she gets another $100k in cash. The previous owners sales were only 60k because according to her they didn't manage it and were always out of product. She has 1 full time girl at $13/hr and a couple bakers she pays $75 for the day. My concern as this would be my first buisness is just failing of course. I know I would put in the work it needs and I would want to eventually make a few changes down the road for example they sell premade iced coffees I would like to do real coffe and partner with a local roaster. They do a fish fry a couple nights a week that they just started  and is doing good. They use daylight donut dough I guess which isn't a contract they just use the product and you put a sticker  on your window that says you served daylight dounts. The building there in they pay $500 a month that is another concern the owner is looking to sell that and soon. Which I could potentially buy depending on what he wants. She says in 2 weeks they make a enough to cover bills then the rest is profit. Please tell me what you think! ,0,1733969344.0,smallbusiness,12,0.33,False

This day was fun! 

From the moment I fetch you at SM taytay and saw you smile when I arrived, it felt heart warming. Driving up to our first destination, we talked a lot and I really felt appreciated, like all our topics are not forced but we truly gave each other a chance to talk and listen and I never felt that before. I really appreciate how you can absorb thoughts and share your inputs as well. 

This day was indeed well spent with you, trying different things and criticizing what we eat is fun! I love your standards for food. You know your pallet so well hahahaha. I apologize if we have to spend so much money everytime we see each other, we have this common denominator that if we want something snd we need it, we buy it. 

Another fun thing about you is your interest in pastries. Trying out FUMU was a great experience, a cozy place just to talk and enjoy their pastries. Buti nalang ang dami mong alam na cafe's that you think or know are good. By the way, their coffees are good! Perfect for consuming while you're with your favorite person, talking about any type of stuff. I can't believe that I got a chance to talk about business with you, I really adore how business minded you are since your father is a business man and I like to grab that opportunity that a person like you has that same drive as me when it comes to having a business. 

The friendship status we have right now, I'll never take for granted. I hope this friendhip will last, but when the time comes and you started to feel what I feel for you, I hope you'll not leave. 

I'll be here for your Anne. A one call away friend, a badminton buddy, I'll never let you feel that you're alone. 

Stay safe, have fun driving, and always remember that I'm here for you!


You're Inloved friend,

She remained an unidentified Jane Doe, until this morning. 

The phone ringing was what woke me. 
I grumbled, my hands swinging wildly to find the source of the incessant chirping.

I was too late, missed call from a private number flashed upon my screen. No message left, no option to call back. 

Since I was awake, I decided 6am wasn't too early to start my day. 
I got up and made a cup of coffee, settling in on the couch to sip on it while I watched the morning news.

A breaking news story flashed across the screen, the reporter held a concerned expression as she detailed how human remains had been found over 3 years before but had only been identified this morning through DNA. 

My name wasn't particularly unusual, but seeing it flash across the screen gave me a strange feeling. 

Seeing my photo splashed on screen was much worse, though.

According to the reporter, I was the person identified as the Jane doe who had died under suspicious circumstances. 

Some sick mistake, I told myself.

And then I saw my own mother on tv, crying and asking for privacy for the family at this difficult time. 

I have tried calling her, my co workers, friends.. no one is answering. 

I've even called 000 and my calls won't connect. 

I tried going to my neighbours but they didn't answer the door when I knocked, even though I could clearly hear them talking inside.

I know I shouldn’t, but I’ve googled and googled, learning as much about this Jane doe and her murder as possible, and while I was on my searching frenzy, I googled myself..

I found the missing persons report that had been filed on me back in 2021. 

Interviews that my family had done to bring awareness to my case.. there’s even true crime sub Reddit’s dedicated to me.

What happens when the pieces of the puzzle all fit, but the picture just doesn’t make any damn sense?

I walk into my office that overlooks my great city, sitting in my chair and sipping on some coffee, I look out towards my people in the dead of night when I notice something, a familiar glow of power.

B: ""Can it be.."" 

I say while shooting out of the chair, my eyes locked on the glow, memories of another timeline coming into my brain.

I fly through the castle making it out to the front entrance without anyone even feeling a breeze, suddenly Feelin appears coming in for another meeting.

F: ""Burnie..?"" He says with a yawn ""I'm surprised your up so early, I'm normally all ready to go for the meetings every time when you wake, are the wives keeping you up?"" 

B: ""Feelin, look to the Western side of the capitol, do you see that glow""

F: ""Glow?"" He says turning, his eyes widening when he sees it ""It's so eerie""

B: ""I know what it is, get another marriage ceremony ready for me, my final wife has arrived"" 

F: ""Can you do the marriage after our meeting""

B: ""Yes just wait for me to return, I'll hurry""

And with that I flicker away running on the glass of skyscrapers while never looking away from the glow.

Suddenly I jump above a building with a long slant of glass, as I land I slide down but suddenly I break the glass and fall inside.

B: ""Unfinished ey? No problem"" 

As I fall I grab a rope and swing onto a platform and start sprinting and jumping around, eventually making it out and jumping towards the glow.

B: ""So it is you, you kept your promise to me""

1hca978,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/1hca978/where_could_i_use_the_bathroom/,Where could I use the bathroom?,"So, I currently live with my father, stepmother, and little brother in their home. It’s a two bed one bath small house. My father and stepmother gave me their room while they sleep in the living room. The living situation isn’t terrible but it also isn’t great either. I mean nothing psychical. Just a lot of other things like controlling and narcism. 

I go to work around 7:20 am while their 13 year old son gets ready to go for school at 8 am. He likes to shower nearly every single day. sometimes he’ll shower more than once a day. I prefer to shower in the morning before work or an event. I sweat in my sleep, my face gets dirty, I also have a cat who sheds a lot on the bed. I try to use the restroom and be done with it before 7 am. Preferably before 6:40 am. It seems he likes to shower around 7 am if he doesn’t shower at night.

It seems that their son would shower in the mornings but he can’t exactly because of me.  They aren’t too happy when I shower in the morning. I seem to use up all the hot water, spend a long time on the shower, spend time luxuriously. Even if I wake up earlier to use the restroom. 


They don’t really like it when others use the restroom. Especially when they’re eating at the table and or someone’s going #2 or blowing their nose. If someone’s in the restroom they make a comment. Like they’re trying to eat, or they want to use the restroom but someone else is in it etc.. 

this morning I accidentally forgot to flush. It honestly wasn’t intentional, my thought was to make less noise. That maybe I could flush when I started the shower to make less noise. I must’ve forgotten. My stepmother like literally one of the first thing she does when she wakes up is to use the restroom. 

She had walked in the restroom after me and made a whole scene over it. She could’ve just quietly flushed it and moved on. But she was saying things, stomping around, flushing at least 3 or 4 times, and making noise. Called whoever did it attention seeking. Also made comments on the size and who couldn’t or could’ve done it. 

I try to use public restrooms like at work, the gym, coffee shops. Literally any public place with a restroom. So that I wouldn’t like need to use it when I get home. But sometimes I can’t help it, like I get the urge to go. I either can’t hold it  or I hold it until it feels like I might make an accident of the sort.

I honestly feel afraid to eat any food because I know I’ll have to use the restroom later. I’m also afraid to use the restroom again after what happened this morning. I’m off tomorrow so I’ll be spending the day at home most likely. I don’t really have any friends or family. I don’t have a drivers license or a car. I don’t think I could exactly like walk to the nearest place with a bathroom in the middle of the night. Could I knock on a neighbors door?

1hca8vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1hca8vn/i_cant_admit_im_powerless/,I can't admit I'm powerless,"Tl;dr in and out of AA, sceptical and standing on the sidelines and can't find the willingness to throw in the towel, dive in and commit wholeheartedly to the steps

I first wound up in a meeting in 2018. I left and came back a year ago. I worked the steps straight out of the book with a sponsor, but in my heart I didn't really believe I was an alcoholic. I could say it, sure, but I always felt weird about it. Time went on and despite working the steps and having deep experiences along the way and starting 10/11/12, I could not shake the feeling that I was an imposter, just a codependent alanon with a drinking problem but not a real alcoholic. It was like ""taking out insurance just in case I was an alcoholic"". Truthfully I had reservations but I heard lots of people say they were ""dragged through the steps kicking and screaming"" and they were seemingly comfortable and sober now, so I figured it was worth trying to stick with it even though I was flapping between ""holy shit I get it"" and scepticism.

I grew tired of meetings, of the competitive drunkalogues, slogan slinging and false humility. My experience of working with someone else did not seem to make me immune to alcohol, rather the guy I was trying to help was struggling and the more he faltered, the more I obsessed over alcohol myself. I lost faith in God and the steps and concluded I have never done step 1 and must not be an alcoholic. After all, I never ended up in treatment or detoxed.

Eventually I stepped into a bar room to try to drink and stop abruptly. It worked. I tried it again. It worked, but it was uncomfortable. By the 3rd day I was getting drunk by accident. A few weeks later I was back to where I'd left off, but getting worse. I want to stop but I don't seem to be able to, and I know I have little control when I do drink. But I can't hold on to them. I flip from one to the other - ""I've got to stop, I hate this, drinking is not working whatsoever and my life is falling apart"" changes to ""I can't bear this, I'll just have a couple, I don't really experience the phenomenon of craving, I just keep changing my mind and choosing to have another drink, if it's inconvenient enough to continue drinking I can sometimes stop, "" and back and forth and back and forth. I haven't been able to string more than a few days in a row without drinking since I started again.

This whole experience has also left me really questioning if it works. A lot of long term sober people seemed to be completely miserable and very much still obsessed with alcohol. I drank on 12, and so did my first sponsor.

Yesterday I put vodka in my coffee in the morning. I spent much of the day listening to recovery podcasts, ruminating and slamming through beers and by the evening I was drunk, sitting on my bedroom floor, texting my sponsor, ""ok, I seem to be an alcoholic after all"". Today, I'm back to rejecting it. I just can't seem to let it in. I can admit I have a problem, I have little control, I can't seem to stay away from the first drink, drinking is not working for me, but I just cannot seem to honestly accept that I'm an alcoholic and it'll never get better and I'll never regain control. 

I feel like a bit of a lost cause at the moment, like a total idiot for filling my head with AA despite reservations, devestated that I don't seem to be able to conclusively prove I'm not an alcoholic, embarrassed that I drank again despite presenting well in meetings, particularly ashamed and humiliated that I drank while trying to help others, scared that I can't seem to stop even though I could before, frustrated that I can't let go and get along with the rest of the steps.

I don't know what will finally completely deflate me and make me ready but it just seems like this is going to keep going until then. Maybe on some level I believe I can manage this, despite just fuckin' dissolving into a total puddle since I started drinking again, who knows? I hope something will knock me off the fence sooner or later, either I just finally give up give up and truly admit defeat or figure out how to control and enjoy drinking.

Ive adopted 5 teenagers for Christmas through a program akin to an angel tree but more personalized. I've bought those 5 teens a shit ton of things and I'm really happy with their gifts. There are 2 sets of sisters and one boy, so 3 parents/sets of parents. I'd like to include something relatively small but a nice ""treat"" for them. My originAl thoughts were a grocery gift card or a gas gift card but none have cars and they live in a more rural area so the closest grocery store is a 40 minute bus ride away. The local ""spot"" is a chain coffee shop in the area, so im considering getting them all $25 gift cards for that, but it doesnt* really feel like something out of the ordinary. I've considered high end coffee but coffee seems to be the social hub of the town, and I have no clue if they have coffee makers at home. I am doubtful they would have access to non school computers.

What's something ""treat"" like you can get for adults with teenagers when you don't know them? 
Should I just stick with the chain coffee shop and some chocolate?

 I don't know their* backgrounds or cultures but I know one family recently immigrated here. I was considering going to the grocery store and putting together a Christmas food basket (stove top stuffing, potatoes, carrots, turnip, beans, candy canes) but I think giving someone raw meat would probably be frowned upon so a full turkey dinner would be out.

A few years ago, I started brewing pour overs with Fellow’s Stagg XF system. Shortly thereafter, discovered the Japanese iced pour over, where you brew directly over ice. The YouTube link below explains the recipe and reasons this works. 

After getting the Aiden (which makes better coffee than I do), I was hoping it could replicate this for an easy afternoon iced coffee. However, it doesn’t make it easy. Can Fellow add a mode for this?

Using the recipe from the YouTube video as best as I could, I made a brew profile for 12oz of iced coffee, but it’s a bit hacky. The finished ratio is 15.4:1, but this includes 40% ice. The ratio of hot water to coffee is 9.2:1, but the Aiden’s minimum ratio is 14:1.  I got the recipe to work, but you have to ignore the guided brew numbers. 

Recipe:
1. Add 136g ice to the carafe.
2. Add 22.1g coffee grounds to the single brew basket. 
3. Use guided brew on the profile linked below and select 7.5oz.

Can anyone do better?

I'll be providing all the necessary information upfront to save time.

As the title suggests, I'm looking for someone who could be my EXCLUSIVE sexual partner.

I want it to be exclusive for a certain period of time para naman hindi papalit-palit ng partner dahil ayoko maka-contract ng sakit o infections 🤢

Must know how to communicate properly, non-judgmental, reasonable, considerate, respectful, and most importantly hindi kupal.

I'm currently focused on platonic connections and exploring non-romantic intimacy, so please DO NOT misinterpret my sweetness and affection as a romantic gesture/interest.

Gusto ko lang madiligan ng masarap on a weekly basis, hence the lambing and all.

Both of us should have stable financial situations and be earning a decent income, para naman masustentuhan natin yung kalandian natin..

Additionally, PLEASE RESPECT MY PREFERENCES. If you believe you don't meet my criteria, kindly refrain from sending a message. Save your precious time.

About you:
- Sexually experienced
- Preferably inked but not required
- TALL, 5'8"" AND UP (non-negotiable)
- Hygienic, smells good, nice set of teeth
- Average or masculine body type. Gusto ko yung lalakeng-lalake tignan at kaya akong bayuhin maigi (I'm not into super slim or huge tummy guys).

About me:
- Inked
- From Manda
- 5'2"" tita who always wear wedge heels
- Hygienic, smells good, nice set of teeth
- Voluptuous body type. Firm and big boobies and butt.
- People often describe me as cute or pretty, but I know that beauty is subjective. Regardless, I'm confident that I'm not panget. 

> You should be genuinely attracted to my body type, para naman hindi ka mapilitan just because you wanna ""try."" I'm not here to be someone's ""trial pack"".. I'm here for a fun and positive sexual connection.

If you're interested, just send me interesting info about you.. Let's exchange photos and meet up for a coffee just to check the vibe, and if we're attracted to each other, then let's talk about the setup. Toodles!

""seems to me more unhappy than the man whom no misfortune has ever befallen."" 

He never has had an opportunity of testing himself; 

though everything has happened to him according to his wish, nay, even before he has formed a wish, 

yet the gods have judged him unfavourably; 

he has never been deemed worthy to conquer ill fortune, which avoids the greatest cowards, 

as though it said, ""Why should I take that man for my antagonist? He will straightway lay down his arms: 

I shall not need all my strength against him: he will be put to flight by a mere menace:

Male, 32, 6' tall...although, the nurse Tuesday said I was 5'11""... They said 6' last year so I'm going to go with that lmao.

I've done IF in the past with amazing success - Previously was 240lbs in 2012, got done to 165lbs pretty damn fast. This was before anything really other than the bodybuilding forum to guide me back in the day. I honestly did it back then just by feel. Learned the concept of IF and just guessed and got it right lmao. I also did ECA back then because that was all the rave. Not sure if that helped but just pointing it out there. (I don't recommend or condone ECA stacks).

28 days ago, I decided to do IF again and get back into shape. I play semi-professional paintball, I'm blessed to get to travel all over the US playing a child's game that I love. So, I am fairly active. However, I have gotten stagnant over the last couple years. When I started IF I was **208lbs** wet. Currently, I'm at **186.3lbs.** Goal weight: **160lbs**. I've been trying to consume as much content on here and the IF subreddit as much as I can, and I feel like I hear mixed results on if this fast of weight loss is safe/if it's all water weight, etc.

I do a mix between OMAD and 18/6 and 20/4. However, for the last few weeks, I've been doing OMAD. I have heard doing it for prolonged amounts of time isn't good but it really works best with my schedule, and after the first day or so of doing it, my body is really just adjusted to it. I get hungry right around 4 every day. Otherwise, I'm really just doing fine. I am a department manager at my job but I walk a LOT. I'm clocking 5 miles a day just walking during my 9-5, and then I hit the gym and do a pretty intense workout. It's all hypertrophy, but I'm averaging about 90-95 set workouts. For example, DB bench 10x10 and then DB bench @ 10RP Max 3xfailure, and then 11 other lifts/exercises that are also 10x10 then 3xfailure etc. I then bike on the stationary bike for 45 minutes to finish my workout. I do this EVERY day. For eating, lets use OMAD for example, I'm literally eating the same thing every day: steamed broccoli, baked chicken breasts and a large multi-vitamin pack and drinking hella water and black coffee/black and green tea.

Admittedly, this is the best I've felt in awhile. I've literally shrunk in less than a month. At practice I am noticeably faster, my stamina is higher, etc. My calves and quads have gotten so defined from all the biking and lifting etc that one of my teammates swears I'm on tren (I just have really good leg genetics. That and I've been dirty bulking almost my entire life). This is the most I've worked out in years, and I have yet to feel weak, dizzy, etc. I went to the doctor yesterday and everything checked out great.

I am on a VERY aggressive calorie deficit. I'm not going to deny that at all. I eat a lot of broccoli and two good sized chicken breasts, sometimes a chicken quarter depending on what I buy and decide to grill up, etc. But, I do know no matter what way I cut it, my deficit is aggressive.

The basics: I'm open to chatting with anyone! I'm 31 and out on the West Coast of the United States. I am married but currently my wife works nights so I am adjusting to the empty quietness around my house. I like all the things most like including watching a variety of genres of shows and movies and delving into podcasts, mainly No Such Thing as a Fish and Last Podcast on the Left but Lore squeaks in every now and then; especially in the fall. I also like my coffee black and my beer cold.

The fun stuff: I'm somewhwhere between enthusiastic and deepy passionate about music, photography and this wild and wonderful world of ours. I have also dove headfirst back into reading regularly and have been greatly enjoying traveling down that road; especially when work finds me on the road. 

Other stuff about me: I'm a mediocre photographer at best, although it is quite fun, and a biologist by trade. In another life I probably would have spent some time as a vagabond searching for something with nothing but my car and my camera. But life is infact not an indie coming of age movie.

I am a sucker for hearing people's stories; and love to meet new people. I also think you can really get a good idea of someone based on their music; more specifically how they describe themselves with a selection of songs. So if you're inclined send me 3 songs that scream you.

1hc9pfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1hc9pfa/thoughts_listening_comprehension_comparison_at/,"Thoughts & listening comprehension comparison at 3,000 hours","This is going to be long! Feel free to skip the sections that don’t interest you. The usual comprehension comparison is the final part.

**Housekeeping**  
Other than titles of shows, I don’t use Spanish in my posts. Keep in mind that there are thousands of people here who read these posts, but never post or comment. I wouldn’t want beginners to be confused or have to look up words. I don’t record myself speaking.

**Reading & writing**  
These still aren’t priorities for me. I read during lessons to help train my pronunciation and only write messages to teachers in Spanish. While I realise that reading is helpful, it’s not *essential* to learn the language. Listening is simply more important to me. The plan is to focus more on reading and writing once my teacher says I’m around a B2 level. I’d then like to take a Spanish proficiency exam, like SIELE.

**Listening**  
As you can likely imagine, my listening is pretty developed at 3,000 hours. Even taking into account learning difficulties and autism - which I’ve mentioned many times and don’t wish to bore people by going on about in detail - I’m quite pleased with my progress. I can understand most native Colombian content at a high level. I’m not interested in Spanish from outside of Colombia and my [comprehension of Spanish from Spain](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1gdhpyh/i_finally_watched_la_casa_de_papel_without/) is lower. That said, I do continue to watch videos from some non-Colombian DS contributors - Sandra, Andres, Agustina and Michelle - because I like their style. However, I avoid non-DS content that isn’t Colombian.

The biggest difference/improvement of late is that my brain now notices small linking or filler words. Typically during the second watch of some content that features softly spoken characters or lots of background noise. This happens a fair bit with Vecinos, for example.

**Hearing “new” words**  
On that note, I sometimes notice “new” words. For example, I first noticed the word for could at around 1,900 hours. The same happened with the word for would at 2,795 hours. These are not new words per se; I knew exactly what they meant and my subconscious was aware of them. I simply hadn’t consciously heard them before that point. They’re very common words and I imagine this has happened with other words, too. These are the only ones that have really stuck out, though.

**Accidentally turning up the difficulty level**  
I've mentioned a novela called Vecinos many, *many* times on this sub. I adore it. The fact that I enjoy it so much means I didn’t really notice its relatively low production values until I happened to watch an episode of the more polished Enfermeras directly afterwards. My love of the former means I've unwittingly trained my brain on hundreds of hours of relatively challenging Spanish audio content. This includes speech being overpowered by loud “background” music, low quality audio and fairly challenging accents. [This scene](https://youtu.be/4O0OoijHonE?si=O9p0mkD97r5KazjG&t=665) is a good example of this. Thus, watching Enfermeras directly afterwards felt almost comically easy by comparison. These more challenging audio conditions likely mean my “Spanish ears” have got more sensitive.

**Current listening challenges**  
Vecinos also features a lot of characters who speak with working class accents. Those same characters typically don’t pronounce words perfectly and use tons of very Colombian slang. That’s currently much harder for me than background noise. However, like all problems, it will be overcome with - *say it with me* \- more input!

Pablo’s said that easier content is better and there’s probably no need to watch harder content on purpose. However, a lot of easier stuff is frankly boring at this stage. There are entire novelas I’ve lost interest in due to this as my listening comprehension has improved. Harder content means there’s more reason to focus and that makes it more engaging for me.

**Focusing on harder content**  
As a result of the above, I decided to watch more [Laura Mejia](https://www.youtube.com/@LauraMejia/videos). She’s a Colombian vlogger who speaks *much* more quickly than most Colombians I’ve come across. As with Vecinos, I expect other content to feel easier after watching her.

**Speaking**  
The biggest recent difference insofar as my speaking is that I’ve been making fewer tiny pronunciation mistakes of late. For example, I used to mix up the pronunciation for old and travel in the moment, as they have similar endings. The pronunciation of the words for comedy and meal was also an issue.Naturally, my vocabulary has continued to expand. I had lessons in the UK for a couple of months at 02:00 every day. That meant an alarm going off at 01:25 to give me time to get out of bed, make coffee and such. I realise how stupid that sounds and I did stay up after those lessons. I mention this only because I was pleased that I could function at that time of day/night with only a little coffee as support. It’s clear that Spanish is ingrained in me and that I can function in the language at the drop of a hat. Not at a crazy high level, but I can definitely get my point across. My lesson times changed once I arrived in Colombia and my current teacher’s schedule will be less insane for me once I’m back in the UK.

My current level of speaking is a tiny bit under a B1. I can definitely use 5 of the 9 conjugations Google says are required for a B1 level with ease. I’d say I can use 7 in total, but I have to think about the other ones for a few seconds. My teacher’s current focus is getting me to the point where I don’t need to think about the others. I don’t know whether or not this slowness with conjugations is an autism/Asperger’s thing, but I think it is. Regardless, we’re working on it. A little bit with lessons practically every day and input daily without fail. I’ve only been with my current teacher for about two months, but my conjugations have definitely improved. My vocabulary is naturally pretty far ahead of my speaking and it’s rare that I don’t understand Colombian native speakers in normal conversations.

**Current speaking challenges**  
My teacher expects my speaking level to reach a B1 by the end of this trip, which would be early February. There will be a report on this trip, but not for several weeks yet.

Preply encourages teachers to share feedback on a monthly basis and my teacher’s most recent comments said that I’m fine in terms of vocabulary and fluidity of speaking. The highlighted issues are pronunciation. She’s said many times that my pronunciation is okay, but that it and conjugations are what I need to improve to reach that B1 level. As far as I’m concerned, English is the problem; we don’t always pronounce every single letter and Spanish speakers - especially Colombians - absolutely do. Due to this, I often combine sounds or omit tiny sounds when speaking. My other issues largely come down to reflexives but we’re also working on those.

I don’t share details of my teachers. Why? A teacher is not like a plumber. You could be spending 100+ hours with this person, so I think you should try several people to make sure you like their style and materials and you get along. I did write [a guide on how to find a teacher](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1bl4m0j/guide_how_to_find_a_good_teacher_a_little/), though. Hopefully it helps someone.

**Current goals**  
My current goal is to reach 4,000 hours of input by August 2025, when my third trip to Colombia begins. I would like to be at a B2 speaking level by then, too.

**Content consumed from 2,500 to 3,000 hours**  
Unless specifically noted, all the content I mention or link to is Colombian native content and therefore isn’t designed for learners.

**Comprehension improvements**  
Below is the standard content comparison I do every 500 hours. Listed percentages refer to words understood in a typical scene.

I haven't tested myself on dubbed, children's or teen content this time around. It was simply too easy last time. I only bother with native Colombian content designed for an adult audience now. You can see my 2,000 vs 2,500 post - which did include dubbed & other categories of content - comparisons [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1ffoupw/thoughts_listening_comprehension_comparison_at/).

**Pedro el escamoso** \- a [super Colombian telenovela](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1bgusfi/pedro_el_escamoso_a_super_colombian_telenovela/)  
2,500 hours: My comprehension was around 85 to 90% for episode one last time around. It’s the easiest native Colombian show for adults I’ve ever watched because there’s not much shouting, most characters speak at a reasonable speed and there’s rarely background noise.

3,000 hours: This has jumped to around 95% for me this time around. Again, there’s a distinct lack of background noise. Additionally, the vocabulary isn’t that sophisticated. Pedro’s inner monologue is particularly easy to follow.

**Enfermeras** \- a [Colombian medical telenovela](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1dft9as/enfermeras_a_colombian_medical_telenovela_for/)  
**Synopsis**: This is the story of a nurse and all her personal and professional issues. It’s full of medical vocabulary, relationship drama and she’s a mother to two kids. I specifically chose this because I wanted something challenging. There’s a lot of background noise, such as drunk patients, chaotic emergency scenes and medical equipment making noise/beeping.

2,500 hours: This jumped up to about 75% to 80% in quieter/calm scenes with either one-on-one conversations or slower group conversations last time. More hectic scenes were around 60% for me.

3,000 hours: In 500 short hours this has gone from fairly understandable to obscenely easy. I can attribute a great deal of that difference to watching so much of Vecinos. Some small details - such as the main character’s husband trying to juggle his anniversary and his mistress - were much clearer this time around. The only scenes below \~90% at this point were those that were chaos-filled; not only machines beeping, but shouting and/or multiple people talking at once. My comprehension was around 80% for those.

**Vecinos** \- [a romantic & funny Colombian telenovela that's free on YouTube](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1e5jtfu/vecinos_a_romantic_funny_colombian_telenovela/)  
**Synopsis**: This is the love story of Oscar and Tatiana. I adore it and them. There’s a mixture of accents and differing slang, as he’s working class and she’s well-educated. However, Tatiana’s shy and reserved. That plus the frequent background music in their scenes can make her challenging to understand.

I’d avoid this if you find neediness annoying. They both are at times, but Tatiana suffers and cries *a lot* as her addiction to him grows and they’re unable to be together. Her suffering sadly becomes a fundamental part of the show as things progress.

2,500 hours: This is a romantic & *funny* novela. There is physical comedy, such as when the normally kind and polite Tatiana throws another woman into a pool. However, I know that I missed some verbal jokes. My overall understanding was around 80% last time.

3,000 hours: I got some jokes and comments I didn’t notice during my last watch. With some exceptions, I’d say this feels around about 85 to 90% for me at this point. Those exceptions are two characters from Oscar’s old neighbourhood who both speak quickly and also use a lot of slang when they’re frustrated. My progress from last time isn’t as dramatic with this novela versus some other content. This is due to the large amount of slang and Oscar’s challenging accent/pronunciation.

Improvements happen without warning in this process. A good example of this is a scene between Tatiana and Oscar that I’ve watched many times. When discussing their wedding, she says that they should take their time to plan things, as they’ll only get married once. His overall response was always clear. However, a word eluded me due to background music again and again. It was suddenly clear one day. *Forget*. “You can forget me marrying you just once. I’m going to marry you two, three, four or five times.” This happened at around 2,600 hours.

I initially wanted to learn Spanish so I could 100% understand La casa de papel without subtitles. Colombian Spanish is now my focus and understanding this show as much as possible is one of my goals. The more I understand them, the nobler and more vulnerable they respectively become. I simply don’t find any other TV couple - including in English - as enjoyable to watch.

**New for this comparison**

**Pa' Quererte** \- [a relatively easy advanced Colombian telenovela](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1g8v5ee/pa_quererte_a_relatively_easy_advanced_colombian/)  
**Synopsis**:This is a novela about several families and their relationships. Naturally, there are affairs, dodgy business dealings and other issues. Its production values are good, almost everyone speaks clearly and I only noticed one accent that I found challenging. I’d rate it easier than Vecinos in that regard. However, it’s not as easy as Pedro el escamoso.

2,750 hours: I’d probably put myself at 80 to 85% in general. The only issues for me were multiple conversations happening at once, young children speaking over each other and the occasional character who spoke quickly.

3,000 hours: This felt fairly easy at 2,750 hours, when I first tried the show. In truth, I gave up on it and skipped to the end after a few dozen episodes because too many of the characters were just far too manipulative for me to tolerate. To test myself, I watched an episode I’d previously skipped. I’d put myself at around 90-ish%. A little under 95%, I’d say. I think that the “gains” get harder as you get close to 100% understanding content. I’m going to have to try and find some more challenging things, or at least different themes to broaden my vocabulary.

**Vix**  
I used a platform called Vix to watch some of the content I’ve mentioned in this post. If you’re in the US, no special instructions are required. If you’re not, paying for Vix is more complicated than simply using a VPN. I [wrote a guide](https://www.reddit.com/user/agentrandom/comments/1geo5hq/how_to_use_vix_from_outside_the_us/) covering this. I hope someone finds this post and that guide useful.

**Disclaimer**  
Keep in mind that I’ve pretty much always been behind where the road map says I should be. I attribute this to my ADHD and Asperger’s/autism. Most neurotypical people should be way ahead of me with the same number of hours of input. In other words, please don’t feel that you’ll need 3,000+ hours to have a good understanding of any of the shows I’ve mentioned. My brain is simply slower than most and thus needs way more input.

this is what happened tonight.
i walk into the kitchen, wash my dish. wash my fork. and my moms bf comes and sits HIS PLATE right next to the sink. and i said. “ur not even gonna wash off ur plate?” and he said “youre using the sink” so i walk into the living room after putting my dishes on the drying rack and i say to my mother that i wasnt gonna wash his plate off for him and my mom goes “yeah well now ur gonna do all of the dishes” so i say that i always do my dishes right after using them and that im not doing a grown mans dishes. 

and this really set her off. which is understandable because i wouldnt have said that now. but she goes “hes working.“ just to put it into perspective, he sits in a computer chair all day and smokes pot. he also told my mother that she did not have to work because he would bring in money. which he does not do. atleast not a steady flow of it. 

after all of this im trying to get out of the conversation and she brings up how much SHE does for me, talking about how she bought me nonslip shoes for my new job and how she does all of these things for me, but it was never about her in the first place. so of course as a teenage girl (17) i snap back and say “yeah the job i got thatll bring in a more steady flow of money than your boyfriend does” and i walked away into my room. 

of course ill do the dishes. since he cant stop smoking pot or sitting down cause its too tiring to get up and do 20 mins worth of dishes. im so tired of taking care of this man like hes 5, hes 40 something and needs to learn how to clean up after himself. im extremely tired of wiping up his coffee spills, sweeping the grounds off of the floor, and cleaning up after him in general.

I decide to have a night out with a friend.  We go bar hopping and she ends up sleeping over. 

We both sleep in til noon. 

A random sense of dread hit me and I check my schedule again. I was supposed to work a double. 

My friend said that she will help me get to work and explain the situation. 

We both go out to my car and there’s a woman in a dark green dress and short curled brunette hair. Her eyes are all black and they are bleeding a dark inky liquid and she is sitting in the driver’s seat. 

We immediately run inside from what we saw. Fear and panic sets into my heart. 

Suddenly I’m connecting dots from last night. Someone was following us all night. I had made a note of it when I saw her at the second bar of the night.  I saw her again at the fourth but assumed it was just coincidence. 

She was eye catching for sure. With her emerald green vintage 50s dress with fishnets and black pumps.  Her dark brown curls fell just at her jawline. And a wide, almost too wide smile. Showing off perfectly pearly teeth incased in ruby red lipstick. She was always looking at the both of you with that large smile but then again that night was filled with us having obnoxiously loud conversations. I just thought that maybe she found our humor funny. 

Now there was no laughter only a deep sense of dread. Why did her eyes look like that? They weren’t pitch black last night you would have remembered that.  Was she still alive?

My friend suggested to call 911. I agreed immediately but realized that my phone was at 5% when I had checked my work app.  I had left it open in the chaos of getting ready and it had died. I asked my friend if she could call the police. She then realized she didn’t have her phone. She must’ve left it at one of the many bars we had been at last night. I had set my phone on the charger when my friend called for me to come to the window. 

The woman had to be alive because she sitting up straight as a board with her hands on the wheel.  She was staring right at the front door as if she was waiting to pick someone up. 

I gulped and turned away from the window.  The fear was making me feel nauseous. Who was this woman? 

In an instant we heard rapid knocking on the door. It was that woman and she was positively banging on my front door. As if she was trying to break down the door with just her one fist. I looked out the peephole and she was gone as quickly as she arrived. My friend went to look out the window to see if the woman went back to her car. As soon as she pulled back the curtains she let out a scream. The woman had been standing right out side the floor to ceiling window. Just as my friend screamed the woman busted the glass to the window with her bare fists. 

Hands gushing a thick black blood as she stepped through window and into the house. Her smile unwavering.  My friend and I booked it away. We weren’t sure where we were running as long as it was away from her. She stayed close behind. We ended up in the bathroom and locked the door behind us. 

I felt so stupid. Of course I ran into the most useless and inescapable of the house. Maybe I can launch some scrunchies at her. I’m sure that will really get under her skin.  There were no windows so the only way of getting in or out was through the door we had entered. 

At the bottom of the door I could see her shadow. Waiting. She made absolutely no noise but after seeing her easily smashing the window I wasn’t about to put my ear to the door to double check. Lest my head fall victim to her brute force.  Sitting in the tub I whispered, “What we should do now?”  My friend didn’t have a response. She sat in disbelief of what our situation was. 

“Well, she hasn’t tried to bust through the door yet so that is a positive.”  I said. 

“Maybe she will just leave?” my friend said doubting the words the moment they left her lips.  

I shared her doubt with a shrug but I didn’t any better options in the moment. 

“Hey maybe it’s a good thing that I missed work today.” I said.  “Maybe somebody will be curious about my absence. It’s not like me to not show up to work without saying anything.”


And so we sat. For what seemed like an eternity. Watching the door but the woman’s shadow remained. Still. Like a prison guard. 

Suddenly we heard thumping from somewhere in the house.  The thumping got closer until I could make it out as foot steps. Large footsteps that sounded like that would come from a man with boots on except there was an unmistakable squish to them. As if stomping through mud. 

They grew louder until they ended right by the bathroom door. Then I heard whispers impossibly low but I could make out didn’t even sound like English to me.  I’m not very educated on other languages. I took French for 4 years but retained almost none of it.  The whispering seemed to belong to two women. Then it ended. And heavy foot steps trudged away until it seemed like the person had left the house. But the woman’s shadow still stood unmoving. 

I was getting fed up and desperate. I started to yank the towel rack off the wall. 

“What are you doing?” my friend quietly shouted at me. 

“I’m not waiting until more of this chick’s friends show up there is two of us and one of her.”  I replied being sure to keep my plan at low volume. I want to have some sort of element of surprise. 

Once the rack was free of the wall I handed it to my friend I figured if we were to do my stupid plan then she should at least get to be more armed. I grabbed a glass vase I used for all hair ties. It was small but had a little bit of heft to it. 

“I’m going to smash this vase over her head as soon as you open the door okay?” I asked. 

My friend nodded and held tightly to the towel rack.  Her hands were shaking but she somehow found the resolve to stop them long enough to turn the lock. The tick that came from the knob sounded to me like an anvil thudding on the floor. The shadow didn’t move. I admired her bravery as she took the knob brazenly and turned it carefully. She gave me a nod that simply said, Your turn.” 

I inhaled silently. As waited to make my move. I took one last glance of under the door.  The shadow still there. I wished that she would have just left as fast as she had entered. I wished that I wouldn’t have to come to such a violent solution to protect myself and my friend. But problems don’t always just go away. 

The bathroom door swang open and I blindly brought down the vase with as much might as I could muster. Down onto nothing. What? I had checked to see if she was still there before the door was opened and she definitely was. Am I going crazy? Was there even a woman here to begin with? Did I allow my anxiety to manifest into something beyond my control?

My friend was gobsmacked.  “She was just here.” she said. With how long we had spent in silence it had seemed like she screamed it. But I found comfort in that she saw the woman too. There is no way something in my head could be seen by others. 

We continued with caution. I kept a gun in my bedroom closet and lead us toward that way. As we walked through the hall we passed the living room where the broken window was. Glass still littered through the room I had been so adamant about keeping clean. But I saw no one.  

I didn’t let the relief hit me just yet. Not until I could do a sweep of the whole house. 

We made it to my bedroom. I asked my friend to keep an eye on the door. So close to being more than defenseless. I inched towards the closet door being fully aware that it would be a great hiding spot for my unwelcome guest. I open the door slowly peering inside as I did.  

Before I knew it my friend had screamed but it was cut off short. She was lying on the ground unconscious. Standing over her was that woman. Smiling devilishly. Her black tears must’ve been flowing this whole time because they began to stain the front of her emerald green dress. Before I could comprehend her movement she had made her way to me. I didn’t even see her move her feet when she had slammed my head against the wall.  I was out like a light. 

When I came to my ears were ringing. My fuzzy vision started to make out the familiar sight of Dragon Ball Z on the TV.  I was so confused as looked around to see that I was sitting on my couch in my living room.  All the lights were off save for the glow emanating from the TV. Right next to me was my friend and next her was that woman. I instantly froze up.  The woman was staring straight at the TV with her ever present smile.  My friend was also staring at the screen but with a more terrified expression. She was on the verge of tears but her eyes stayed glued to the screen. Fearing what the woman would do if I tried to get up I also watched the television. 

I was never a fan of Dragon Ball Z so I didn’t understand what was happening in the plot. I could feel the cool air from the broken window on my neck. I wondered if my friend was thinking what I was thinking. Maybe we could make a run for it?  Suddenly the show changed to old merry melodies Halloween special.  There were dancing skeletons on screen. I typically love this sort of light hearted macabre entertainment but it felt especially sinister with the woman’s presence. 

Then it quickly changed to a PSA about if you know where your children are right now. In my peripheral I could see the woman’s black tears start to fall with more intensity than before. Sopping the front of her dress. You wouldn’t even be able to tell that it was once green. Then the program changed again the Betty Boop Snow White cartoon.  The remote sat mockingly in front of us on the coffee table. As the long legged ghost crooned on the screen I dared to pass a glance at my friend. I was searching for any semblance of hope that we could make it out of this. 

She looked at me too but only dread was plastered on her face. We both looked back at the screen. As we continued to watch the show she whispered something in a hushed tone so that only I could hear. 

“Do you see it?”

What was she referring to? I looked intently on the screen. I had seen this episode before and nothing seemed out of the norm. And then I saw it. 

Not on the screen but in the hallway past the TV and into the dark. Something with a hulking frame stood back there with a familiarly wide smile.  It stood back there like a brick wall imposing and stationary. Loose hair threaded from its scalp and its eyes were like two tiny white glints. It stared holes into my soul. I couldn’t tell what it was wearing but it seemed absolutely drenched.  

Horrified I quickly averted my gaze back to the screen.  My hope felt squashed. I didn’t know how we were going to make it out of this.

The TV changed again to an episode of goosebumps. I looked at the screen not even taking in what was happening. I was too focused on my fear dumbing down my mind until my thoughts felt like static. I wanted to scream, cry, throw up, anything. Instead I sat side by side with my friend staring at the TV but watching them in utter silence.  It was several seasons later when something unexpected happened. 

My friend got up and made a dead sprint towards the gaping window. I should have followed her but I just sat there dumbly. As look back forward it was right in front of me I hear a loud crack and all goes black. 

I woke up three days later in a hospital bed.  I was right people at my work took notice to absence immediately.  My boss had called the police after she had done a drive by of my house and noticed the broken window in the front the next day. When the police found me both my legs were snapped like twigs. As if my body was the start of an origami piece. Folded over and over on themselves.  And message was carved into my forearm.

“Wait here.”

The police had questions for me obviously. But I needed to get mine out of the way first.  “Is my friend okay?” I ask desperately. 

“Ma’am,” the officer replied “That is what we are trying to find out. We still have no sign of her.” ",0,1733966518.0,nosleep,0,0.5,False

Now…

1. *For the girls* - I don’t want to be very full when he proposes but the breakfast is quite big. Should we do it with morning coffee (which is almost our ritual after his night shifts) OR shall we go to the fancy place, drink a Prosecco and exchange rings, then move onto lunch?

2. *For the men* - I know he will go down on one knee. I think we will say our pieces to each other before or after through the meals on the day but he won’t shy away from public attention. When I pull out his ring, should I go down on one knee with him? Will that overshadow his moment? Should I simply open the box and keep it in front of him?

3. He has often joked and asked if we should simply propose to each other thrice at all 3 joints which is quite funny to me. Do you think that takes away the sincerity or novelty of it?

Like he's literally crying from happiness from getting to see me and falling asleep cuddling on my chest. Then he says he only got to know me because he was bored and I'm too ugly to be his girlfriend anyways.

And he always always has this people pleasing mask on. But one time I saw it slip without a warning when we were just having a coffee at the kitchen table. Suddenly his pleasant expression just... dropped, and while we were looking into each others' eyes, not saying anything, his face became completely blank. Somehow at the same time his stare was completely devoid of any human expression and yet something so painful seemed to peek through from that void that he almost didn't look like a human anymore to my lizard brain. Something about that stare was so scary that I immediately reflexively stood up and walked away to the kitchen counter because it startled me. I still sometimes get goosebumps when I think about his face like that. It was in the middle of a normal pleasant conversation - like seeing my friend suddenly change into a complete stranger, a strange and dangerous man, in front of my eyes. Like in a nightmare.


Only took a second and I've never seen it since. I used to love his sunny smile but I now hate to think it's just a front for that weird scary blankness. I'm now convinced it was the only moment when I ever saw honestly what it must feel like to be him. I say this with empathy, but also, shit's scary af. I'm working up the courage to stop caretaking him and to cut contact. I know what to do but feel deflated and completely out of energy.

 I'm still nursing my toddler because I just don't wanna fight about it in the middle of the night. 

I'm hesitant to take meds bc it kinda feels like it'll possibly make my volatile family situation worse if I have ANY negative reaction - and even if it ""works like it should"" and takes the edge off, it kinda feels like I need my emotions ""sharp"" to make sure I'm not letting anything abusive slide. 

I'm also hesitant to take meds bc most substances that most people can handle hit me really really hard - coffee makes me anxious and hyperactive, cough medicine makes me loopy far past the ""8 hours"" it should last, etc. So I'm going to also ask my doctor about like 5-htp and gingko/ginseng because maybe a supplement would be enough?

I'm wondering if just plain sleeping enough would help me enough that I could handle all this. I've been hesitant to wean because it feels like it's not a guarantee that my toddler will also actually sleep. But maybe the simple tasks I'm struggling to stay on top of would be easy enough if I slept more than 3-5 hours at a time.

1hc9gt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1hc9gt6/aio_old_friend_used_my_wouldbe_wedding_dress/,AIO: Old friend used my would-be wedding dress. ,"This is a bit of an odd one, therefore I have absolutely no idea where I am with this, but bear with me. For context, I have ADHD and I'm autistic (late diagnosed and still learning to cope) so I can struggle to understand some social rules, especially when it comes to changes in relationships and dynamics, and have had issues with processing emotions, although I'm working on this. 
""Anna"" (32F) and I (32NB/Trans M) were close friends from the age of 14 till we drifted apart in our late 20s, mostly just through having very different lives. We didn't always see each other regularly, but when we met, it was like we picked up from where we left off, and we considered each other siblings. 
In 2018, when I still identified as female, I got engaged, started planning a very budget, non-traditional wedding and asked Anna to be my Maid of Honour. Prior to transitioning, I was never particularly feminine or formal in my dress sense, and a ""proper"" wedding gown would never have been my style. In 2019, I purchased a gorgeous off-white 50s style tea dress with red foil flowers for around £65 and brought it to Anna's house to show her and keep it out of my fiance's sight. Unfortunately, my fiance and and I separated in 2020, but remain friends to this day. During a later video call, I had mentioned to Anna that I'd like to get the dress back to resell it, or use for crafting as I'm a very sentimental person and would like to use the dress for another purpose, if not my wedding. Over time, I had reached out but Anna has always been a bit challenging to keep in contact with, which I don't entirely blame her for as she has children, mental health struggles, and spends time caring for family members, but I've often felt like I had been the one to put most of the effort into our friendship, despite struggling a lot with my own mental and physical health. Anna was the kind of person that you could call in a crisis, but trying to organise meeting for a casual coffee was a whole other ball game, but I cared very deeply for her and very much miss her. Over time I didn't really forget about the dress but kinda gave up on everything getting it back and assumed that Anna would have gotten rid of it by now. 
The last time we spoke was a very brief conversation over a messaging app in summer of this year (2024).
I came out as Transmasculine in 2021.  I'm very happy in a pretty non-conventional and healthy relationship and I know that marriage and children will unlikely be for me. 
Anna got married this year and I was delighted to see the photos and how happy she and her family are. I did have a brief moment of sadness at how close we had once been and that I didn't even know about the wedding. I never would have expected to be invited, and am sincerely so happy to see that she is living her best life, after a very rough road to get there. I expressed my congratulations over comments but didn't message privately due to dealing with a challenging situation of my own at the time, and I also figured that she would be very busy with newlywed life. In some later photos, I recognised the dress her Grandma was wearing. I'm almost entirely sure was the dress I had bought. There were small details that matched it, and Granny would be a similar size to me at the time of purchase. 
At this point, I felt hurt in a way that I'm struggling to explain. If I had not been a part of the wedding at all, that would have been totally fine, but surely they must have remembered it was my dress.  Could they not have at least asked me if they could have it? Was I forgotten about entirely? Was it assumed that I had forgotten about the dress? Did they assume that it was no good to me as I ""would never wear it anyway""? (I would have LOVED to transform it into another garment, or turn it into a drag costume!) Did Anna know they were going to use it when we spoke in August? 
I messaged Anna to ask if it was the same dress, not asking for it back, and got left on read. It feels like it would be petty to ask for it back at this point as it's not really my dress anymore, as well as the fact it's been 5 years, but neither of those things were down to me. I asked for it back and tried to stay in touch. I also don't want to upset her or make her feel like I'm angry or jealous. 
I'm aware that my own emotional struggles cloud my judgement and I know that this is just as much about my abandonment issues than it is about the dress, but am I somewhat justified in my hurt here? ",2,1733965987.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

I tend to find a more comfortable and open communication style with women, which is why I'm specifically reaching out to this demographic.

Due to my work travel, there's a possibility we might occasionally be in the same location. If that happens, and if you're open to it, I'd be happy to meet for coffee or lunch for a chat – entirely optional, of course.

If this resonates with you and you're interested in connecting, please feel free to message me. I'm hoping to offer support and mentorship, perhaps even a supportive presence like an older, guiding figure.

I currently work in a programming job where I work fully remote, not even like have to work 9-5 just as long as I get my work done it’s fine. Lack of structure has really messed with me and I’ve always had a hard time staying motivated when I don’t have to do something right away. I really like my job but some of the stuff I’m doing right now is sort of repetitive but I know once this part is over I’ll get to be creative in it again. I’ll work for a bit during the day but then play video games as I can get what I need to get done fast. I live with my girlfriend and she works at weird hours so whenever she is home I try and spend time with her so that makes it so if she works early and I sleep in I only have a few hours of work a day. I know I need to force myself to go to a coffee shop and go to the gym early but even when I do that I work for like 2-3 hours and then slack off because I felt productive enough that day. Any advice would be great. Thanks!",1,1733965590.0,self,0,1.0,False
1hc9byi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1hc9byi/frequent_urination/,Frequent urination,"Hi I am post- menopausal (last period Feb 2023) and on light HRT (.025% 2x weekly estradiol patch and 100mg progesterone). My A1C is normal/low and I don't have diabetes.

  
Currently in pelvic floor PT. My PT thinks peeing 14 times in a 24 hour period is too much. I know caffeine is an irritant and I know that the 6-12 oz or so a day I have of tea or coffee is likely part of the issue, but I suspect that even if I cut that out I would still be peeing at least 11 times a day. I think I would literally have to starve and dehydrate myself to get down to the 7x per day she says is normal. I drink very minimal fluids from 7pm to 7am most days and still get up at least once to pee at night.

Also i feel like this frequent urination has been a problem for decades so I am not sure how much is hormones.

My fluid intake is about 70-75 oz on a typical day and I am 170 lb.

  
Just looking for anecdotes and thoughts on how much is too much and what you would do if you were me. 

My current plan is to try quitting caffeine in the new year, get allergy testing done, and maybe try an elimination diet...not looking forward to that.",3,1733965583.0,Menopause,20,0.81,False

1hc9avb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1hc9avb/i_am_not_quite_sure_what_to_do_about_this_one/,I am not quite sure what to do about this one...,"Hello! So, I would like to begin how I don't really believe in all the supernatural or paranormal kind of things, which in turn this one is baffling/unnerving me.

So, it all started about 10 days ago. I live on my own and basically do everything on my own as I have done for about the last 4 years. As such I have headphones on most of the time indoors and out, listening to podcasts/audiobooks/music and such. I left the house 10 days ago with nothing. I was walking to the bus stop (about 1 mile away) when I heard footsteps behind me, not in pace with mine so I knew they weren't mine. I thought ""That's odd, this is quite a long straight road, and I didn't see or hear anyone come out of a house behind me."" So, I glanced over my shoulder without stopping, nothing was there. Thought nothing of it and carried on walking. The footsteps started again, I must add they sounded about 10 to 15 steps behind me, so not too close. I glanced again confused, nothing there and the steps stopped. Again, thought nothing of it and the steps started again. This time I stopped and turned around, the steps stopped and once again, nothing was there. I thought whatever, I'll just ignore it.

Fast forward to in our local town later that day the roads are all cobble stone, so your feet make quite a lot of noise on it, 50 or so people around me and in front of me. Then I hear steps again, same distance away. I glance back, you can guess it, steps stopped, nothing was there. This went on for a couple of days every time I left the house.

I was walking across a big open field near my house and as per usual the steps are behind me going through the grass. So now I want to start testing things. I changed the tempo of my steps so I can match the steps behind me but the ones behind me don't change. I speed up, the ones behind me don't change but keep the same distance. So, I stopped, but didn't turn around. The steps didn't stop for about 3 or 4 steps after I stopped. So, I slowly look behind me, and decide my mind is just playing tricks on me.

Couple of days later in my house my stairs creak a little, I was walking down them and as I am close to the bottom I hear the top steps start to creak. As you can imagine, this made me jump. I spun around to an empty staircase. I got to the bottom and the ground floor is slate. I had socks on, so socks on slate make no sound (obviously). Started walking to the kitchen at the back of the house. In which case the creaking on the stairs started again. I was becoming not a happy chappy by this point, but as every other time. I never said a word. Until I heard it get onto the slate flooring... It was still following me... The sound it made sounded like nails on the slate, walking in my direction. Now I feel tingles going up my back and feel this horrible darkness creeping in. I slowly turn around. To nothing. I inspect the floor, not a mark. Me being me, not believing in this stuff, grabs a beer and heads back upstairs to watch a bit of TV.

2 days ago, I was at my friends house having a nice coffee in his back garden talking about cars. His back garden is all gravel, his cars are round the side of his house is on concrete. We decide to take a look at his car to see what's wrong with it. Walking across the gravel, get onto the concrete. And he whips around in a shock. Saying ""Did you hear that?"" To which I replied, ""Hear what?"" Then he said, ""The footsteps, on the gravel, it sounded just behind us."" Then to my excitement I exclaimed ""I KNEW I WASN'T GOING MAD!"" In which case, the excitement suddenly dropped to horror... Now thinking... Wait... I wasn't going mad... He believes in all these demons, ghosts, ghouls and all that stuff. And he ushered me out without an explanation. I have tried giving him a ring and message the past few days and got no response. I think I've spooked him.

Now I know my house quite well. Quite often I will walk around in the dark. Say from my bedroom, down the stairs, down the hallway to the fridge, then back up again. Now the stairs and hallway have no lights, you could put your hand in front of your face, and you couldn't see it. But I have lived here so long I'm a master at thinking. Which has got me thinking... If this ""thing"" is following me, it stops when I look... What if I can't see? Or when I am walking and suddenly stops it takes 3 to 4 steps before it stops, what if it takes 5 to 10 steps? It would be on top of me.

So, all in all, shall I just carry on living my everyday life pretending to ignore it? Or is this actually more serious than that? To describe the feeling... It isn't a cold feeling, it's like a hair starting to stand up feeling, it feels like a darkness is all around you and there isn't any light anymore. Like a horse with its blinkers on, you can only look forwards and the rest is darkness.

Sorry for the long spiel. I thought if I was going to get a proper response I should say the full story. Thank you!",1,1733965491.0,Paranormal,1,1.0,False
1hc99x0,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagofood/comments/1hc99x0/tasting_menu_at_el_ideas_december_2024/,Tasting menu at EL Ideas (December 2024).,"I went for the tasting menu at EL Ideas and had a fun night out with friends. **8/10 overall.**

**Food - 8.** Most of the food was tasty and well-balanced, with distinct flavor profiles, contrasting textures, and a variety of proteins. There didn't seem to be a clear course progression to me, but I care more about the taste of the individual dishes, so I didn't really mind. We bounced all over the globe in terms of cuisine. My favorite courses were the apple pie-ish dessert (one of the best sweets I've had this year), Szechuan-style duck leg, and Indian-inspired crab beignet. There were only a couple misses for me, including their iconic french fries and frosty dish, which was entertaining conceptually but just too salty. I do want to mention that dietary restrictions may have a big impact on your menu. My companion who couldn't have dairy didn't enjoy the food nearly as much because the chefs tended to simply omit components containing dairy in lieu of making substitutions, which threw off the balance of several dishes. Another thing to note is that we did leave somewhat hungry, which is disappointing at this price.

**Drinks - N/A.** The restaurant is BYOB. They provide some suggestions on what to pair with the food, but we decided to just bring a bunch of mixers and gin to make some simple cocktails. The restaurant also offers a small hot beverage bar with (free) coffee and tea to accompany the dessert courses.

**Service - 8.** The courses are served to the entire restaurant in waves, so the pacing depends on the other parties you're dining with. The service itself is unfussy and you're mostly left on your own except for the presentation and clearing of dishes. Most of the servers were also the chefs; they were friendly but obviously busy with preparations, so interactions were pretty brief unless you ventured into the kitchen for a closer look.

**Ambiance - 7.5.** The atmosphere was casual and relaxed, with plenty of eclectic decor. It's a bit of a choose-your-own-adventure experience: you can stay seated at your table and treat this like a standard fine dining meal, or get up and wander around and head into the open kitchen to chat with the chefs and watch them create the dishes. We did a bit of both. I think this restaurant is better suited for bigger parties as opposed to solo diners since the vibe was very social. It also seems like a great place to bring people who are interested in fine dining but uncomfortable with or reluctant to sit through a very formal service.

**Note:** The bill is prepaid and includes a 20% service charge which covers gratuity. You just walk in and out on the night of service. They have an independent reservation and payment system which is a little more complicated and glitchy than the major platforms, but still manageable.

**Would I go again?** Although this was a fun experience, I think one visit was enough for me.

I'm a 43-year-old man hoping to connect with a young woman between 18 and 24 who could benefit from some guidance and support as they navigate the early stages of adulthood. I've been fortunate enough to achieve a good level of success, particularly financially, and I'd love to share the lessons I've learned along the way – both the successes and the mistakes.

Life in your late teens and early twenties can be challenging, filled with big decisions about careers, relationships, and finding your place in the world. I'm here to offer a listening ear, practical advice, and a positive perspective based on my own experiences. I've been through the ups and downs, learned how to manage finances effectively, and built a successful life for myself. I'm happy to share what I've learned in hopes of helping someone else navigate their own path.

I find I connect more easily with women, so I'm specifically looking to mentor a young woman in this age range. I understand this type of request can be unusual, so I want to be completely transparent and assure you my intentions are purely to offer support and mentorship.

My work involves frequent travel, so there's even a possibility we might be in the same city at some point. If that happens, and you're open to it, we could meet for coffee or lunch – no pressure at all, just a thought!

If you're feeling a bit lost, facing tough decisions, or simply looking for someone who's been there and done that to offer some friendly advice, please feel free to reach out. I genuinely want to help and believe I can offer valuable insights.
