1g8qk95,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vilnius/comments/1g8qk95/can_i_buy_you_beer_or_coffee/,Can I buy you beer or coffee?,"So I went to therapy to stop avoiding intimacy. Then I learned how hard I avoid intimacy and what I’ve done to avoid intimacy. 

Therapy helped. After learning what I’ve done to avoid intimacy my confidence increased. Women started treating me differently. My confidence skyrocketed. Then I couldn’t sleep long enough anymore. I took a break for 5 weeks from everything and everyone. Eventually had to use sleeping pills. They gave me a reset. 

Now I don’t let myself feel confident and attractive, unless I’m in a situation where my brain is more quiet, e.g just waking up. 

Now I’m avoiding women I might connect more. Way more than before. I’m like pre emptively taking action such that they don’t get close to me. 

I’m in a difficult situation. So I was wondering if anyone would like to give me a little push. We go out together, if I see someone interesting, I tell you, and you push me on my back maybe. Or maybe we can just talk about this stuff. Maybe you’ll give me a useful idea. 

I’m avoiding my therapist since she said I should talk to a girl about something she did if I liked her. I talked to her but I waited for 2 months first",1,1729519688.0,Vilnius,0,1.0,False

Three years back, I lost my job. It was a good job , decent pay, great location etc. but I hated it. I hated every minute of it. I couldn’t focus at all and do anything. I went back on my meds (Vyvanse), still nothing. I couldn’t focus at all. I was even giving a training part where I was supposed to read a book and they gave me two weeks to do it but I couldn’t do that at all. They gave me two warnings but still I couldn’t do anything.
The anxiety (generally throughout )was so much that that’s where my psychosis started. I could hear voices etc. 
Anyway , I also did a couple of jobs after that but got fired from them as well. What is keeping you all going? What’s the secret? I can’t have coffee like I know a lot of people do.

Except, when I went to start it, I somehow started on episode 2. I played through and then, you guessed it, immediately started episode 2 again.

Having played American Nightmare and Control, I'm used to being presented the same story again with minor changes. Another loop is no surprise. So that's what I think is happening. I play through once again but end up getting distracted and having to turn it off just before concluding. 

At this point, I'm pretty disappointed in the DLC. I know there will be more unveiled on episode 3 (which I'm thinking will be another run of coffee world with jesse) but I'm not dying to learn or anything so I end up not playing for months. 

I finally come back to it. Play through coffee world again, then finally start episode 3. Wow finally something new. Can't belive I missed this.

Had so much fun I started on my final draft playthrough. Got all the way to episode 1 of njghtsprings where Alan can access it in game. 

Just now playing #1 Fan for the first time. 

Wow.

I'm John, from the greatest city in the world, Chicago. With a city so big you'd think dating is easy, I wish that was the case. Tired of the dating apps and I've had connections on here before so I figured I'd give it another shot!

I work in a very demanding customer service job, it's not my favorite job but at least it's work. On my downtime on weekdays you can find me binging a double feature of two movies l've never seen before.

I'm a big horror nerd, and I get excited to watch things I've never heard or seen. Currently doing a deep dive into 1970's Italian Horror.

I watch a lot of other stuff too. I basically live on the Tubi app after work. Comedy, action, even some romantic comedies. B movie are also a favorite of mine. I'm literally filled with weird, obscure film recommendations.

420 friendly! I def hit my vape every night after work, it calms me down after a very stressful day. Weekends if I have nothing to do l'll smoke a bit more, but I can def go days without it. Not a deal breaker if that's not your thing!

Outside of watching stuff on weekends I try to stay as active as I can. Summer and fall I love going to the parks out here with my dog, Buddy! He's a 11 year old rescue dog who I got about 4 years ago. He's got my heart and I know you'll love him.

I'm pretty simple! Go out one weekend night a week with friends to shoot some pool and have a few drinks. I tend to visit coffee shops and check out record stores on weekends too. However, I'm also good at being a coach potato on a weekend if it's needed.

I love all kinds of music. Mainly older things like Beatles, Pink Floyd, Nirvana, I could go on and on. I'm definitely a bit of an old soul. 70s and 80s rock, 90s stuff and of course good old emo music from the 2000s

A cup of coffee grew colder on the outskirts of cafe Henre, Paris as Jhene’s  warm chestnut eyes swelled up. Almost as if puddles sat eagerly awaiting descent. Across her pale palm laid a pearly white envelope, something so small yet so life changing. 

The fifth of September had arrived, simply two months following what was set to be her  fathers five day orbit with space-x transformed into a living nightmare for the ones down on the ground. 

As the clock hands tick with each second passing by, Jhene  prayed some satisfactory news would grace her presence ;  It was almost impossible living in such fear and dismay of his return.

Regardless of five years without contact, Jhene was too vulnerable to face defeat.She crumpled the envelope with her bare hands. The news channel was said to be on soon, Jhene knew. It was much easier this way. The clocks hands almost ticked noon. As anticipation lurked she felt an invisible hand clutching her heart. How much worse could this situation become? 

As it striked noon her eyes met with the led television sitting just above, hoping a rush of relief would be what's next for her. Muffled sounds of a reporter echoed across the outskirts of the wide cafe as her heart began to race. Written in bold brick red letters “ Keith Green case : stuck in space - No new information”. 

Jhene trembled. Her eyes watered 

This left her with two options, neither ones to favour. She could either face her fears at this instant or perhaps live with them for a couple more weeks. 

Gently bending down to pick up the crumpled envelope, a sudden rush of guilt filled her. What if she may never get to see her father again? What if he’s stuck in space for life? Almost about to leave the letter on the ground, a sharp gust of wind echoed down the streets with a wail, grabbing her scarf from around her neck and whisking it down bay road into a strangers arms. 

Jhene's faded chestnut eyes met with the sudden strangers ; surprised paris winds were strong enough for the theft of knitwear, then relieved a old man clutching her scarf with no motive to let go…..and finally,wide,disbelieving,shocked..all the things Jhene feared vanished as their gazes locked. 

There he stood,not even five metres from her, the cause of all her prior pain and sorrow. Startled , she took a couple steps back with her mouth open. 

“Dad?” he saw the words escape her mouth as he was filled with shame and guilt. Reminiscing of the childhood times she begged him not to leave for each mission. 

This was the last, no more he ensured her as they shared a tight hug filled with cherishing laughter.  “Let’s go somewhere so we can talk properly, Its been five years I've seen you, How about this place? Cafe Henre seems like a great place to start?” 

Jhene nodded, indeed it was a good place to start,it was the least she could ask for.

It's my husband's first time in Paris, and it's been a good while since I've been so we would like to visit the hotspots (Musee d'Orsay, the Louvre, Montmartre, Jardin des Tuilieres etc) but we don't want to stay in an overly touristy area. We both like to visit art museums, good restaurants and coffee shops, independent and design stores and bookshops.

Since we'll have a stroller, we would love for restaurants to be within walking distance from our hotel as it will make it easier to go out for dinner in the evening. It also needs to be a safe area. Ideally a few cafes around too for easy breakfast.

Which locations do you suggest we stay in and what are your itinerary suggestions? Any tips are greatly appreciated!

Many of the women I've spoken to (who are all younger than myself — I want to date someone younger than I am.) are not looking for something serious or are not sure what they want. Two or Three of the women I've spoken to who are looking for something a bit more long term focused (and have other shared values), I don't find particularly attractive nor unattractive, just plain looking. I'm on the fence about taking these women out for a coffee date. I don't know if one can or should try to get past looks for the purpose of a long term relationships, which hopefully ends up in marriage.

I feel like we argue more now than ever before.  A few weeks back we had spent a really nice Sunday together and my wife suggested we call in sick on Monday.   My calendar that week was jammed with things I couldn’t move.  I said I couldn’t take the day.  I said “I have commitments”.  Things spiraled from there into a “you care more about your job than me”.  That led to a few days without speaking.   

A few days later the topic came back up.  She was still angry and noted I should be committed to her first and job after.  While I agree I think there is a balance.  I digress…. Where I’m going with this…. During our argument she said “I deserve to be with someone who adores me”.  I agreed and said I did…. I constantly tell my wife she is beautiful or how good she looks or how sexy she is.  I make her coffee every morning.  When I’m working from home I stop work to ask her how her day ways.  I take care of her dishes.  I try and do all the little things and when you combine all of this… it’s my way of showing her I adore her.  Though I’d never thought about it in those terms prior to this.  

If I mention I do those things to show her I love her she simply says, I don’t have to do those things for her.  I feel like she takes what I do for granted.  If I ask, what would make you feel adored she can’t quantify that.   I’m at a loss here…. I know there are other aspects of our relationship that are impacting me and maybe I don’t show her.

He said""I got you this"" it was a tiny little  ring. I was shocked and said ""I love you""... it felt so forced and awful, but I was nearly homeless, living in a near empty apartment with my baby... it was the ace  first time someone ever bought me jewelry..... after that he was awful, pushing me to get marriage certificates, of course all he did was insult me, say I'd be alone, threaten to leave... he had no one to stand up for him at our severer coffee shop paper signing, so I had to get my best friends husband to sign for him. So many red flags. I lost my wallet on the wall to the coffee shop that day, sadly I had my passport in my pocket, otherwise I would not have had ID..

They all still came up sour, and it doesn't make sense... until now.

What I did noticeably different in my most recent attempt was that I didn't spend even half a minute to let the boiled water cool down. I was told that brewing coffee with water too hot isn't good, but maybe I was underestimating for quickly hot water cools down. I assumed that the water wasn't hot enough which lead to the coffee extraction being little and sour. Another new thing I did was I placed the gooseneck on a piece of cloth so it won't make contact with the cool surface.

Now, I have a balanced coffee that's neither sour nor bitter :D

I only manage this whole thing now and again, when I really have the time to enjoy it, but in case anyone else wants pampering inspo:

- playlist or audiobook - ‘Shower Chill’ on Spotify for eg
- make a tea or coffee or drink of choice 
- exfoliating face mask on. This is key. I used to do it after but starting with it is WONDERFUL as you can wash it all off and cleanse in the shower. If you’re in the UK and looking for budget options, I swear by the Superdrug exfoliating ones. 99p. Yet to find anything better.
- I don’t use a hair mask but I’d put that on at this point too!
- dry brush or exfoliating mitt all over body. I put some body oil on the mitt as I go over. I’m thorough on places I intend to shave 
- remove nail polish and file/buff nails
- once mask is set, hot shower on!
- rinse and cleanse face
- other shower bits as needed: wash, shave, hair mask, etc
- shower off, hair up in towel. Now I moisturise all over OR tan depending on what I need
- while hair dries, mani/pedi in my dressing gown
- hair serum & styling

Overwhelmed by my sudden rush of emotions, I hurried downstairs before he could leave the closet, trying to appear busy. I grabbed a cloth and began wiping the kitchen counter, even though it was spotless.

 

A minute passed, and I heard him come down the stairs. Keeping my back to him, I continued cleaning, hoping to avoid any interaction. Relief washed over me when I heard the front door open and close. He didn’t say anything.

 

I needed a job—something to save up for law school in Seattle. I remembered a café just down the street. Maybe it was time to venture out and try my luck there.

 

I pulled on a light purple sleeveless top with thin straps, paired it with my favorite jeans, and tied my hair into a high ponytail. Grabbing my phone, I stepped outside for the first time since I arrived.

 

The fresh air was a welcome change, and a gentle breeze tickled my skin as I walked down the street. The overcast sky mirrored my mood, but for a moment, I found comfort in the simple beauty of it all. Soon, I arrived at the café: Love & Coffee.

 

Suppressing the urge to judge the name, I took a deep breath and pushed the glass door open. The warm scent of coffee and pastries enveloped me, instantly soothing my nerves. The café’s simple elegance, with its white and brown décor, felt inviting.

 

The counter was busy, but I managed to squeeze into the line. When it was my turn, I approached the girl taking orders. “Excuse me,” I stammered, “I’m...looking for a part-time job. Could I...speak to the manager?”

Her understanding smile eased my anxiety. “Hang on, I’ll get the owner for you.”

 

A minute later, she returned with a man following behind her. He appeared to be in his mid-twenties, with messy dark curls and striking green eyes. Dressed in black from head to toe, he wore a warm smile.

 

He led me to a table and gestured for me to sit. “So, you’re looking for a job?” His voice was friendly, his tone casual.

 

“Yes,” I replied, struggling to steady my nerves. “I really need one. I don’t have much experience, but I’m a fast learner and willing to do anything.”

 

A waiter appeared with two glasses of water, and he slid one toward me with a soft chuckle. “Relax. Drink some water first. You look nervous.”

Newly learned of the underconsumption movements and I believe I do align with the values. 90% of my wardrobe is thrifted and I still have pieces from over 10 years ago. 

When my clothes get too big or too small I try and tailor first and if that's not possible I donate back to thrifts and if they are too torn or full of holes I reuse the fabric for other projects. 

I too get confused when people have like 80 different coffee mugs or whatever other things. 

Anyway a lot of people say a good way to start underconsumption is to not buy anything for a year. 

How does this work for jobs where you need to buy things? Teachers, mechanics, artists, electricians, etc. all have to buy some (or all) of the supplies for their work. Do work things not count in no buying things for a year or are those jobs just incompatible with the underconsumption lifestyle?

The afternoon drifted into a quiet hum of activity as the café began to fill up. Atlas sent me out to serve water to the new arrivals, and I was so focused on not spilling a single drop that I didn’t even glance up at the table.

As I placed the glasses down, a voice broke through my concentration—one I hadn’t heard in years. ""Drea?""

My heart stuttered. There, standing before me, was Adrian. After all these years. Alive. My throat tightened as emotion surged. ""Adrian?""

Tears stung my eyes as we stared at each other, neither of us daring to move, still trying to grasp the reality that he was standing there, whole and unharmed.

“Drea!"" He quickly stepped forward, gripping my hand as if afraid I might vanish. ""I can't believe you're here!""

He was back. After three long years of wondering, worrying, and sleepless nights, he was really here. My mind raced with a thousand questions, emotions twisting inside me.

""You should be saying that to me! You disappeared without a word!"" My voice wavered, an odd mix of anger, relief, and disbelief. ""I didn't have your number, I didn't know if you were okay. I thought—""

He cut me off, guilt written all over his face. ""I know, I know. I'm sorry. I left without saying anything because I didn’t want to drag you into my mess.”

“Messed up?” I scoffed, hurt and frustration boiling over. ""I lost my best friend, Adrian. I was alone!""

His head dropped, and he whispered, ""I’m so sorry, Drea. I promise, I’m not going anywhere again.""

The soft clearing of a throat interrupted us, and I realized we weren’t alone. A woman sat nearby, cradling a baby boy in her arms, and a little girl perched next to her, wide-eyed and curious. They all watched us with mild curiosity.

Adrian looked over and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “Oh, right. Drea, this is my wife, Darcy. And these are my kids—Isla and Josh.”

I blinked, trying to process the words. His wife? Kids? “Oh... hi,” I managed, giving them an awkward wave. Darcy smiled warmly, while Isla waved back with the enthusiasm only a child could muster.

“It’s Isla’s third birthday today,” Adrian added with a soft chuckle.

“Happy Birthday, Isla,” I said gently, though my mind was racing.

Isla’s face lit up. “Thank you! Are you Aunt Drea? Daddy told us all about you!”

I shot Adrian a confused glance. Aunt Drea?

Adrian grinned. “Yes, Isla. This is Aunt Drea.”

Before I could react further, I heard Atlas calling me back to the kitchen, pulling me away from the whirlwind of emotions I was feeling.

“I’ll catch up with you later, Adrian,” I said hurriedly, dashing back inside.

The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur, with Adrian’s family lingering for Isla’s birthday cake. We exchanged polite smiles, but I knew we needed more time to really talk about everything that had happened. There was too much to say, too many questions I still had.

Hours later, after my shift had ended, I stepped out of the café and mentally kicked myself. I’d forgotten to get Adrian’s number. Again. How could I be so ridiculous? After all these years, I still hadn’t managed to ask for his contact details.

Just as I was internally scolding myself, I collided with someone outside.

“Drea,” a familiar voice called out, and I looked up to see Adrian standing in front of me, his expression soft and warm. “I was just coming to see you.”

“Adrian?” I blinked, surprised. “I thought you left hours ago.”

He shrugged, that boyish smile of his spreading across his face. “I did. But I came back because we still have a lot to talk about.”

I nodded, my heart pounding. “Yeah, we do.”

“Want to take a walk?”

Without thinking, I agreed. We strolled through the streets, avoiding any route near my house. I didn’t want Sorin to know about this. Not yet.

“So…” Adrian’s voice cut through the silence, a teasing note in his tone. “You got married.”

I shot him a sideways glance. “How do you know?”

“Really? It was all over the news. Didn’t you see it?”

I fiddled with my fingers, nerves bubbling to the surface. “Oh…”

He laughed softly, shaking his head. “Yeah. To Sorin Zaveri, no less. I was shocked but also happy for you. You’ve always loved him, Drea. Seems like your dream came true.”

His excitement was palpable, but his words only made my chest tighten. I couldn’t lie to him. Not after everything we’d been through.

I swallowed hard and stopped walking, staring down at my feet. “It’s not real, Adrian.”

His brow furrowed as he halted beside me. “What do you mean?”

“It’s just… a business deal,” I whispered, feeling the weight of the truth crash down. “My parents married me off to save their company. Sorin hates me.”

Adrian’s expression darkened, his hands balling into fists. “Drea…”

I wiped at my eyes, fighting back the tears. “I’m okay, Adrian. I am. I’ve learned to deal with it.”

His jaw clenched. “If I’d been here, I would have taken you away. I wouldn’t have let this happen.”

I placed a gentle hand on his arm. “It’s not your fault. You couldn’t have known.”

After a long silence, Adrian offered to walk me home, but I declined. The last thing I needed was Sorin seeing us together and making assumptions.

When I finally reached the house, I tried to unlock the door, but the code wouldn’t work. Sorin had changed it. I knocked several times, but there was no response. Defeated, I sat down on the doorstep, scrolling through old photos of him. His smile in those pictures always made my heart ache.

Suddenly, his voice startled me. “What are you doing out here?”

I jumped, my phone slipping from my grasp. Sorin stood over me, his face unreadable as he bent to pick it up. He glanced at the screen, which displayed a picture of him, and his expression changed—though I couldn’t quite tell how.

Without a word, he handed my phone back. “Why didn’t you just come inside?”

“The door… it wouldn’t open,” I stammered.

Sorin frowned, stepping forward to test the lock. After a moment, he sighed in frustration. “Did you try using your fingerprint?”

I bit my lip, guilt written all over my face.

He sighed. “Unbelievable. Now we’re locked out.” He pulled out his phone, pacing away to make a call for help.

When he returned, he sat down beside me, though he made sure to keep some distance. The silence between us stretched on as we waited for someone to fix the lock, and I couldn’t help but sneak a glance at him.

I wished, just for once, he’d let me in—both literally and figuratively.

Good morning all! I hope everyone is doing well and getting through the work day! I’m here enjoying my second (maybe third?) cup of coffee and would love some company. Join me and let’s be friends or soulmates or whatever we become!

A little about me. I’m a tall, glasses wearing brown haired guy working in the legal field, though I don’t get into any courtroom dramatics. My username here comes from my cinematic hero and all around icon Elle Woods. I enjoy my job, which is mostly research and writing, but I think some people might think it’s boring.

In my spare time, I really enjoy reading and enjoying nature. I’m always up for a book recommendation or a good hike. I love to bake as well, though I’m definitely not ready for the tent yet. I just enjoy trying to make tasty things to give to friends and family. I play board games and D&D when I can. I like to write fiction. I’m too big a LotR nerd. I speak two languages with various degrees of “this would offend a native speaker,” guess what they are! (One might be more obvious!)

If you were there and had a different experience, please add some more information for future triathletes wondering what T100 is like.

Expo and checkin: 4/5

At a hotel, felt more like a big city marathon with the indoor expo and checkin. Expo was light but didn't expect much. From what I could tell the mechanic was free.

Swag: 5/5

Probably the nicest bag I've ever got from a race. They gave a shirt, cap, coffee mug, water bottle. The finish medal is very unique as well. The for sale branded clothing is also very high quality. Looking forward to running in my new singlet.

Location: 5/5

I've been to Vegas 25 times and never to Lake Las Vegas. We used to come to the strip all the time when I was in grad school at UCLA. Beautiful area, mountains, scenery. I'd definitely come back. They had a parking shuttle (coach bus) too and from the self parking lot, was easy and quick.

Course: 4.5/5

Not an easy course. Swim was well marked. And seemed plenty of safety support. Bike course was on public roads but completely separate from cars (blocked by large cones the entire way just not part). They also had like a 100 traffic personal out there monitorg and helping. Amazing actually.  Road seemed clean from debris as well, I didn't see anyone with a flat tire. Run: hard AF but again off the road completely so no interaction with motor vehicles which is the best. Finish line, blue carpet, was also pretty solid. 

MISC stuff: 3.5/5 

Transition only had a few toilets and there was 0 on the bike and course and a set of 5 at swim start on the run course. It was a 4 loop bike and 3 loop run, no reason they couldn't have at least 1 at each station. The swim start ones were kinda hidden while running so you had to know where they are.

Would I race another T100? Yes. 

How does it compare to other brands? It was comparable to nicer Ironmans, it will definitely be higher quality than local races. Roth is still the best.

How was spectating the pro race? Really fun. Got to see everyone up close. Literally inches away, tons of awesome photos and videos and talking to some.",4,1729517070.0,triathlon,0,1.0,False

I like to keep milk on hand for times that I want to eat cereal, use it in my coffee, or the occasional Oreos and milk before bed.  Buying a 1/2 gallon is out of the question, it spoils too quickly for me to consume it.  On some weeks, I do manage to finish a quart, but not always.  

So while I was grocery shopping yesterday I saw the single serving milk cartons (the tetra pack ones) that one would put in a child's lunchbox.  I immediately thought, ""duh! why haven't I thought of this before?"" So I bought a 12 pack of shelf stable, single serve milk cartons.  I have 2 in the fridge and the rest in the pantry.  I ate a bowl of cereal last night for dinner and used one.  It is the perfect amount!

So basically my question is do you think we'll get to see enough of Dublin in 2 days, with one of those days being a holiday?

I've had extreme social anxiety for a while now where even talking to the people I live with makes me anxious and I know I seem visibly nervous and anxious in basic conversations and overthink what I say. I think coffee is one of the things that makes my anxiety worse as I'm naturally a more calm person. Buut I am always SO spaced out I genuinely cannot function without coffee - one coffee feels like the bare minimum for me not to be very tired, even if I have enough sleep. 

Does anyone have any alternatives that might help? I've tried matcha but it's not strong enough, I've heard of mushroom powder/ drink but not sure if thats effective at all. Thank you if you've read this far!<3 ",1,1729516758.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

1g8pd5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1g8pd5z/finally_blocked_uninvited_my_narcissistic_mother/,Finally blocked & uninvited my narcissistic mother from my wedding,"Apologies for the long rant, this is all a long time coming. I've known my mother was a narcissist for years, maybe a decade. She's always the victim, but is righteous in her verbal abuse towards us. She must be thanked for even thinking to call us. She will turn any conversation back to herself and roll her eyes when someone else tells a personal story. Over the last decade, my younger sister and I have taken ""breaks"" from her, which we were able to do because we lived with our dad. My parents separated when I was 10 because my mother was caught cheating with her boss. My sister and I only found out about the cheating 2 year ago.

My mom is very Catholic and her insistence on forcing her faith on me and my sister has been a point of tension for a long time. We were raised Catholic and attended Catholic school from K-12, but we each in our own way decided that it wasn't for us. My mom will go on long rants about how we've strayed from God and how we've been influenced by ""society"" telling us we can leave God. My mom often asked me and my fiancé what we would do if we didn't have God in our life if the other was in an accident and became quadriplegic. You know, normal questions.

Two weeks ago, my younger sister came out to my mom. My sister had been wanting to come out to her for awhile and agreed to do it while I was in town (I live on the other side of the country) and when it was just the 3 of us at dinner. My mom just sort of said ""ok"" and left, which was fine because it was just before we said goodbye. 

Two days later, my mom and sister were together because my mom needed a ride home from a medical procedure. She asked to sit down with my sister and talk, so we don't know if she was in her right mind or still loopy from the procedure. But she said all the vile and homophobic things that a Catholic person would say to someone queer. That women are only built to be with men (specifically one man by her words). That women cannot provide for women like a man can, because two women can't have children together and that's what couple are meant to do. That she would not acknowledge any relationship with a woman that my sister had. That she thought my dad would hit her and that she didn't like being called stupid, so yeah she cheated (Of my two parents, my mother was more physical with us, up until I was 19 years old, which she also denied during this conversation. And my dad has admitted to being physically aggressive towards my mom  AFTER he was told she was cheating on him, during their first conversation about the cheating.) After 20 minutes of this, my sister left her at the coffee shop they were at and told her to get a uber home. 

My mom has not reached out to my sister or I in the lats 2 weeks. She has talked to her sister and her cousin (who I both consider my aunts) and my cousins (the children of her sister). She's told them that she would respect and love whoever my sister loves. I asked to talk to her last week and she said she wanted to talk to my dad first. I told her to talk to me by Sunday or that would be her last chance to talk to me. She talked to my dad during the week and said the same thing, that she would love my sister and her partner unconditionally. She never reached out to me on Sunday so I texted her :

""Hi \[First Name\], (she's said that texts without a greeting are impolite)

I am going to bed at 11pm tonight. I will be disappointed if we do not talk today, but that will not stop my from blocking your number tomorrow""

Her response:

""When you stop referring to me by my first name, then perhaps we will talk...""

So I blocked her number. My sister blocked her number. And my fiance text her that it would be best if she didn't attend our wedding in 6 months and we hope she respects our decision. She said ""Thanks for letting me know""

My cousins and dad know and I will have to let my in-laws know. But I'm glad I did it. Even before I got engaged I knew she would try and make the day about her. I've seen her do it at other weddings, including her own sister's. I had already been pretty distant about my wedding with my mother, not telling her when I was getting a wedding dress because she called me fat last year in front of my fiance. She also told my fiance to his face that she didn't really know him or feel like she could trust him. This was after we had been dating for 12 years (we met at age 14) and we got engaged 2 weeks later. She bought herself jewelry after our engagement to celebrate.

So I am not sad about my mom not being there. I know it will make the day a little more stress free. But now I have to figure out how to get some decorations I've had shipped to her house, do I invite her childhood friends or not since they already got save the dates, how do I get my grandmother who lives with my mom to the wedding. I just wish it could be a clean cut but its messier than that. So for right now, I know that I won't ever get answers from her for what she did or said, but I don't owe her any more of my life.

I’d like to understand how much caffeine the pods actually provide. I can be a bit sensitive to caffeine so I usually just have 1 coffee a day. I have it once I wake up so that I feel active for the rest of the work day.  

I always pour an espresso shot using 1 pod to make an Iced latte. I bought Pike Place Roast and Blonde Espresso Roast pods to try. The coffee sometimes seems to be a bit weaker than a normal latte/cappuccino that I would get from a cafe.

Does 1 Nespresso shot have the same caffeine as an espresso shot? 
Do I have to use more than 1 pod to get the same effect as I would get from a latte/cappuccino from a cafe?  

As mentioned earlier, I don’t want to overdo it since I don’t really want to build much of a tolerance to caffeine and it can sometimes even affect my sleep at night even if I drank it during the day.

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

Felt pretty weird to say no after he basically spent $900 on me.,"I, 20F has been going on dates with this guy 23M and he’s willing to spend a good amount of money on me. I’ve never experienced anything like this before, so I am not sure how to react. I would like to come to the conclusion that he is love bombing, because I really cannot tell if this is a red flag or not. I think he’s a really nice guy, and I like him.

I would like to preface and say that being a 20F, especially one in college, who already comes from a low-income family, things happen a lot lol. I guess that is the typical life of any young-adult my age. My old ass car shuts down or my college asks me to pay for a class out of pocket sometimes. I’m sure many people my age experience the same thing, but this guy would like to help me be less stressed about it. Which I guess is okay, the only problem is we have not known each other that long. He also mentions us moving in together, getting married, and having children one day a lot. I thought he wasn’t being serious but as a joke he refers to me as “Mrs. (His last name)” a few times already.

We’ve went on a total of three dates. The first date was fine. I remember him offering to spend a little more on a few things, but I told him that I was okay.

Before the second date, we have been texting each other pretty much everyday about our days at work. He’s a math teacher, and I am a nursing assistant in the hospital. Throughout that week, my car shut down. It happens quite often with me, it is a pretty bang up car. I spent about $200 to have the battery replaced. I was joking to him on how my car shuts down so frequently (I tend to be optimistic when crappy things happen lol) and then he offered to reimburse me the $200 I spent. I told him that I was okay, and that I was only joking. Am I wrong? Was it too soon for me to say something like that when I would have a potential relationship with that person in the future?

On the second date, when we’re coming home, my car shut down again. We tried to jumpstart start it, and it didn’t work. I had to get a tow truck, which was actually quite difficult to do because my car was in a parking garage. I think I’m cursed with bad luck lol. He called his insurance company for a solution and was willing to pay $1060 to have my car towed. I thought he was insane, and told him that I’ll be fine and called Triple AAA. 

Last night was the third date. We know each other for month as of yesterday. The date itself was fine. I had a mid-term essay due last night. He offered to take me to a coffee shop and help me research a few things, and give me pointers on the essay. I was okay with that. 

But because my car is down and my mechanic is on vacation, he picked me up yesterday. When we went to the coffee shop, my laptop wouldn’t turn on (it’s an old MacBook). So then he took me to the Apple store, and the technician said my display is broken and that it would be $598 to fix. I freaked out, only because I still needed to fix my car. He offered, I declined. He tried to convince me to let him pay for it, then I told him to just take me to Best Buy or any nearby electronics store to buy a monitor as a cheaper alternative for me. On the ride there, my mother called and said I might as well buy a new laptop since it is very important for school, and that I could use her car for any errands I need to run or classes I must attend. I said okay, I took the very little savings I had to fix my car, to buy a new laptop. When we got there, I was able to get a student discount off a new MacBook from $999 to $899. I had $800, I just needed my mom to send the other $200 or so that I could complete the purchase. And then my date paid for it. 

Beforehand, I pulled him aside from the cash register and asked him what was his deal with offering to pay for all of these expensive bills of mine. He said that I needed it, and that he doesn’t spend his money on anything else. He told me to just fix my car. I offered to pay at least half, he said he wanted to pay for the whole thing. I felt like my back was against a wall because we were in-person. It was easier for me to text no and end the discussion. 

Later he asked me to be his girlfriend, I accepted. I do like his personality, so I think I said yes because of that because I am not sure how to feel right now. Is this a kind gesture or should I just run? Or am I the one that is wrong with my joking or freaking out where money is concerned? He offers to help out with other things, like my school assignments. But should I just shut up and never mention when something goes down again that could be solved money-wise?

I can't thank you all enough for the incredibly useful and thoughtful critique you offered on my [first attempt](https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1fzr83i/qcrit_contemporary_romance_love_focaccially/) (also to those of you who slid into my DMs offering encouragement). I've tried to incorporate most feedback, particularly on expanding both main character arcs.

A few questions.

* I've removed the settings from the query blurb but do want to show that the book is frothy and escapist with lots of travel porn, so have expanded my bio to mention them. Does this work?
* In my first attempt, I spoiled that Elisa herself is more into the fauxmance than F knows, though this reveal doesn't come until around 70% into the book (and causes F and L's third act breakup). This detail led to a lot of questions. My understanding is that the query blurb should only set the scene for the first 50% or so of the book. Should I include full details of this second reveal? Hint (as in brackets in the blurb below)? Or just leave it out altogether?
* I have removed wording on POV altogether. The book is about 70% from Francesca's POV, though we occasionally dip into Luca's thoughts (can't go into as much detail because he's hiding quite a lot). Should I instead mention this in the initial housekeeping (as bracketed)? Does this count as single or dual POV?
* I didn't get any critique on my first 300 in the initial round. Would love your thoughts. In particular is the foreshadowing stuff about secrets and changing perspectives intriguing or just clunky?

Again, SO MANY thanks to all.

 

Dear \[Lovely Agent\],

\[Personalisation\]

**Ingredients**

For ***Love, Focaccially***\*,\* a contemporary \[dual POV?\] romcom with recipes, complete at 95,000 words.

Take the celebrity romance of Curtis Sittenfeld’s *Romantic Comedy*; add a dollop of the movie *Notting Hill*; stir through a generous serving of the Italian food and travel porn of Ali Rosen’s *Recipe for Second Chances* and leaven with the wit and sparkle of Mhairi McFarlane.

**Recipe**

*Freelance food photographer Francesca Edwards is determined not to fall for her client, footballer-turned-food-writer Luca Danieli, even though the most exciting thing she's meeting currently is her monthly mortgage payment. Despite being a legit snack, he's obviously off the menu, and not just because he has the curls of a Botticelli angel, eyes the colour of aged balsamic vinegar and an utterly disarming grin. Luca comes from a three-Wikipedia-page family; and he and superstar Italian actress Elisa Fiorentino make up the celebrity couple known as #Lulisa.*

 

*But as they collaborate on Luca's cookbook and bond over their love of food, shared Italian heritage, and only child status from homes broken by death and divorce, Francesca becomes increasingly puzzled by Luca’s relationship and irritated by his inappropriate flirting. When confronted, he admits #Lulisa is a fauxmance, faked to help kickstart his food career in the wake of his injury-induced retirement from football.*

 

*Francesca and Luca embark on a secret relationship, though the need to hide from predatory paparazzi, prying phone cameras and even friends and family, sits badly with them both. But unwinding a ‘relationship’ the whole world \[and maybe Elisa herself\] is rooting for might not be as easy as Francesca believes. As Luca learns to rely on talent and integrity instead of his charm and nepo baby connections and Francesca gains the confidence to claim the relationship, and career, she deserves, online blind items reveal someone is onto them, and this make-believe love triangle might just be a recipe for disaster.*

 

I have a degree in French and Italian from \[xxxx\] and after decades in the corporate trenches worked as a freelance food writer and photographer in both the US and UK, published in \[xxxx\], \[xxxx\] and \[xxxx\]. I am now based in the UK, dividing my time between Notting Hill and the Cotswolds, both settings for the book. I am half Italian, and also draw on my experiences with my Italian family in Naples and my travels in Sicily. I’d be delighted to create recipes for some of the dishes described in the book to include in an appendix.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards

“Chocolate on that?”

Jazz nudged Francesca. “Go on. Live dangerously. I dare you.”

Francesca nodded to the barista, gave her friend’s shoulder a playful thump, then took the lattes over to their favourite window table. Jazz brought over the almond croissants, set them down and pulled out a chair.

Francesca remained standing, eyeing the table. She shifted the sugar lumps a few centimetres, brought the jam jar of marigolds closer to the coffee cups, broke the end off a croissant and scattered a few aesthetic crumbs onto the marble tabletop. If she caught it right, the soft morning light would bring a silvery gleam to the ornate teaspoons and highlight the chocolate-dusted fern etched into the foam. She shuffled to the left to crop out the recycling bin outside the window. There. Angling her phone just so, she held her breath and took the photo.

It was always intriguing how a simple change of position–a slight shift in perspective–could transform a picture. How light and composition could focus attention on certain details. Or conceal. They said the camera never lied. Maybe not, but it could be economical with the truth.

She sat down, to catch Jazz exchanging eye rolls with the woman at the next table, who was watching Francesca while fishing a crayon out of her toddler’s mouth.

Jazz nodded at her coffee. “Any chance of me drinking this?”

 “S’OK, I’m done. It’s all yours.”

 “You’re too kind.”

 Francesca peered at her phone and started poking the screen.

“You’ll get frown lines.” Jazz grabbed the broken bit of croissant and munched while she watched. “And your drink’s getting cold.”

“Huh. Occupational hazard. I can’t remember the last time I had a hot cup of coffee.”

After Francesca had tapped her screen some more, created an Instagram story and given her 18,247 Instagram followers their daily fix, she sipped her lukewarm coffee with its sadly collapsed foam.",2,1729515531.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False
1g8p2c3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGIWhistleblowersMITA/comments/1g8p2c3/139b_good_morning_ladies/,"# 139B: Good morning, Ladies!","I loved reading all of the reports about yesterday's discussion meetings! 

We were very busy yesterday and I didn't get a chance to tell about ours. Dee and Eulogio supported Group A together with the Twinettes. We at Group B had confirmed a couple of guests but they didn't make it and we knew that Chima had a job. Oh, well, try sgain.

I guess we can count Bernie as a guest, though. She was walking around the rec room as if she was doing work but we think she came to listen in. Veera wasn't feeling well but John came and he's statistically a guest although he doesn't feel like one anymore and he does a demon gongyo. 

So there were ""the regulars”: Guy, me, Emily, John, James (the new Reddit name our YMD has chosen), plus our Central Figure. Mix in the Future Division: Mikey, Charlie, the Twinmen, and Benjamin Kdaké. Total (yes, Blanche, we do count Future Division members as attendees). Total: 11. (I am running out of time so I will share the details of the meeting tomorrow.)

Ladies, let’s continue working on the seventh section, entitled *Purification of the Six Sense Organs Means Human Revolution.* It is in Part 14 of Ikeda Sensei's commentary on *The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings* ([October 2024 Living Buddism](https://www.worldtribune.org/2024/key-passages-from-the-record-of-the-orally-transmitted-teachings-part-14/)), “‘The Bodhisattva Never Disparaging’ Chapter—Engaging in Dialogue in a Spirit of Friendship and Activating the Goodness in Each Person’s Heart.”

In *The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings*, Nichiren goes on to say: 

>Bodhisattva Never Disparaging’s bow of obeisance is acknowledging the fact that “self” and “others” are in fact not two different things.

>For this reason, when the bodhisattva Never Disparaging makes his bow of obeisance to the four kinds of believers [monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen], the Buddha nature inherent in the four kinds of believers of overbearing arrogance bows in obeisance to the Bodhisattva Never Disparaging. It is like the situation when one faces a mirror and makes a bow of obeisance: the image in the mirror likewise makes a bow of obeisance to oneself. (OTT, 165)

Question to think about, Ladies: What does “the bow of obeisance” mean to *us*?

Sensei explains further:

>Bodhisattva Never Disparaging believed in the supremely noble Buddha nature within everyone he encountered and bowed to them out of respect and reverence. When he did so, their Buddha nature bowed back to him, as if a reflection in a mirror. Such gestures of respect form a positive connection that mutually inspires and elevates the minds of both.

Notice there are two levels of responses from his friendly neighbors to his bows. On the surface they responded by throwing rocks and such. But at a much deeper level, their Buddha natures were connecting to his.Can you paint a picture of their Buddha natures bowing back, waving, hugging, saying thank you, and exchanging texts. Sooner or later–perhaps even in a future lifetime–the Buddha natures of people filled with anger and arrogance gain ascendency over their dark sides. Everyone lives happily ever after from that point on.

Where is Bodhisattva Never Disparaging right now, this very second? They are right here on MITA where we make bows of obeisance to our friends across the hedges. Sure, our stated goal is to “set the record straight” for the sake of others who come across Whistleblowers. But full of compassion, we hope that our words imperceptibly and slowly wake up the Buddha natures of the angry and arrogant critics at Whistleblowers. So what if it takes many years or even a couple of lifetimes to help awaken the frozen sweet soul of Blanche that u/55RuePlumet once described?

So, [What's Playing at the Roxy](https://youtu.be/HL9lhzvQV1M?si=abkyl-RuHRHCX5vR)? There's a new person posting there, a “Weak-Run-6902.” Although her cake day was less than a month ago (September 22, 2024) she was apparently so curious to vacuum up several juicy dirty tidbits over years of posts about the people in the RV Park Metaverse. *(Shhh! It's Blanche! After taking hours to block every single person on Reddit who has any association to the RV Park from reading her posts on their Reddit apps, she felt a need to have a new “public” identity)*. There's also a Reasonable_Show8191 who only just started posting on Whistleblowers 2 months ago but has [intimate knowledge](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/s/NtNqmdRPjG) of obscure RV Park-related posts going back many, many years.

Some of their sample rage thoughts:

>How *dare* people like Guy, Andy, and Marilynnnn imagine new national models for P-12 education? (Let's just leave that to the experts–who have failed [again](https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/opinion-federal-education-reform-has-largely-failed-unfortunately-we-still-need-it/2024/06) and [again](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/opinion/covid-education-crisis-election.html?smid=nytcore-android-share))

>How *dare* people like Dee imagine solutions to the wars in Ukraine/Russia and Israel/Palestine? (Why, she should be following the high bar set by Blanche who declared “I don't give a sh*t about Ukraine!”)

And why don't I just follow BF's technique of finding a couple of obscure long-lost  comments to malign *all* SGI members and *the entire* SGI movement? 

Now Weak-Run-6902 has secured the spare key to Blanche's extensive database and memory. Of course, we RV Parkers are all the creations of u/Marilynnnn *(Shhh! We keep telling her that u/Andinio is our master sockpuppeteer.)*

But Blanche's point is to confuse, rage, and and draw others into her ugly world. So far Blanche has refused to engage with any of this series’ 139 posts (345, actually, if you take a conservative estimate of 2.5 actual posts for each number). Sockpuppet to Sockpuppet, Blanche: why bother engaging within the plane of actual ideas or the flow of what's written in this month’s SGI publications when you can just pass out some moldy old samples from your database.

The time and effort I take to write this post to you, dear Blanche, is written after being very inspired by the act of Bodhisattva Never Disparaging’s bow of obeisance. I hope when the kids are a little bit older I can drag myself to an FNCC conference. Knowing that you are surely bowing back to me right now, let's plan on having coffee there together sometime this lifetime or next. 

Bowing deeply across the hedges,

I’d been dreaming of escape again, this time Mom and I had found a shuttle during one of our missions. Why is it so much louder than usual? It sounded like Winfred had sent us off on another one. A hand rubbed my upper arm, a sensation I was unfamiliar with.

I jerked away before my eyes had fully opened. That wasn’t a dream, it was a memory! Everything began coming back. The dead station filled with black slimy tendrils, the screams. Mom sending me away so I could escape.. Mom! With a start I tried to jump to my feet so I could wave goodbye to her, but a hand clamped over my arm.

“Let me go!” I tried to pull away. Mom couldn’t be called back without me waving goodbye. I had to wave goodbye! We didn’t get to say it. “Please! I just want to wave to my mom!”

“Sweetie, I’m right here.” Mom sat next to me with a small smile, in her eyes was something I’d never seen before. Victory?

“Mom, what happened?” I looked back at the pod. The landing pod doors closed as the scouter finished clearing the ship.

“What do you remember?” Mom turned me to go inside the station. I remembered she told me to wait two light cycles after she left, but I couldn’t go back there. I sat down on the ground.

“We heard screams. You sent me away, made me go back while you continued on! The slime peeled from the wall and wrapped around me. There were so many voices then. I woke up here.”

“The slime is.. I’m not sure but it has a consciousness. They need a host to live. So in exchange for *our* freedom, I gave them access to the Copperwoods.” Mom chuckled at my gasp. “The Copperwoods think we’re dead, that me and my ‘cat’ were thrown into space.”

The doors to the station remained open behind her. The slimy tendrils were gone, though where they’d once been sparkled a bit brighter than where they hadn’t.

“We’ve got two days to load up our shuttle. I call dibs on a really large bed!” I cried out. All those nights sleeping cramped in hiding earned as much.

The light cycle’s hue changed to a deep violet as we entered the residential hall. The sleep shift had begun. I darted back and forth in the hall, opening each door to find a cot larger than a single person. The third door on the right revealed a double person cot. Perfect!

“No! Not that one!” Mom snapped, mouth slightly parted with furrowed brows. “It’s where I found you.” She stared at the bed, as though it presented some kind of danger.

“Okay.. Maybe there’s another one!” I darted across the hall and found another. “How’s this? It’s still close to *that* room, but we shouldn’t go too deep.”

“Oh! It has a sanitation pod,” she cooed, “and two beds! Yeah, let’s use this one.” Mom’s eyes flicked further down the residential quarters, as though reluctant to go too deep herself. What could she be hiding from me?

The next couple of light cycles almost felt like a paradise. Comfortable cots, warm sanitation pods, meals with actual flavor! I wanted to stay forever and never leave, but Mom reminded me that pirates or a scavenging crew could show up and we’d be defenseless. We saw little of each other while we attended our individual tasks.

I worked with the shuttle’s artificial intelligent user interface (AIUI), Nexus, to plot our course to the nearest colonial station seven light cycles away. Under its guidance, I managed to fill the tank and battery to capacity as well. Meanwhile, Mom took the supplies we gathered daily from the station and put them away until no room remained. Then she filled the aquatanks and exchanged the waste canister.

Shuttles were intended for personal travel to visit another station briefly, but their layout didn’t differ much from a station. Upon entry you have the cockpit, where common simple medical supplies would be held. Next you would find the communion area, the lounge on one side and kitchen on the other.

Then a cramped hallway holds four bunks, a top and bottom on each side. I called dibs on the top left bunk, because of the window, and arranged my belongings on the bunk beneath mine. Mom did the same on the right, though it was the bottom bunk that had the window. Finally you have the hygienic chamber, with a small sanitation pod and toilet.

On our last night in the station, we placed all the clothes we’d claimed from the station’s wardrobes in the laundry to be automatically cleaned and folded while we slept. We went to bed in clothes that were in poor condition, so that when we finished in the sanitation pod they could be thrown away.

“Good morning Nexus,” I said as we entered the shuttle.

“Good morning, Jessie and Tracy,” it responded. “It appears breakfast time has passed according to my chronometer. Would you like me to adjust the schedule?”

“No,” Mom answered. “Your schedule is correct. We wanted to finish our morning routines before leaving.”

“I Understand. ‘Good morning’ was not a reference to the time but rather a customary greeting.”

“Yes, Nexus. I’m sorry, we’ll try to be more clear in the future. We’ve never interacted with an artificial intelligence before, let alone one that’s a user interface.” I told it.

“Understood. We shall adapt together. If you require assistance, please do not hesitate to ask; I am here to facilitate your journey.” Mom thanked it as we fastened ourselves in the cockpit for take off. “Would you prefer a countdown sequence or shall I initiate the launch directly?”

“Ooh! We’ve never had a countdown before. Please, do your favorite countdown for us!” I raved. 

Winfred always just pushed the launch button. For half a minute we’d have no idea why the doors were locked and found out only when take off would throw us back.

“Of course. Countdown commencing. Launch in thirty seconds. Please ensure you and all personal items are securely fastened. If additional time is required, please state so now. Launch in twenty-five seconds. I am delighted to assist you on your journey to a new destination. Launch in twenty seconds. Windows are now sealing and will reopen once stable.”

I gripped my arm rest as the chair began to recline backwards. Above me paneling that I hadn’t noticed before slid open to reveal a screen.

“Launch in fifteen seconds. Please remain calm. The screen above will display a simulated view of space, designed to help reduce motion discomfort for sensitive passengers. Launch in five… four… three… two… one.”

It was at this point I wished we had given the ship a test run, as it shook violently. Mom’s wide eyes met mine and I briefly worried the shuttle might collapse on us. After a few minutes, the shuttle smoothed into a soft vibration, and we relaxed.

“My apologies,” Nexus said calmly. “I have been parked for a quarter of a cycle and some parts were stuck. I have applied lubricant to all necessary components. The rest of the flight should be smooth.”

“How often will you need to apply the lubricant during the trip and do you have enough? Should we get more?” Mom asked in a high voice.

“Rest assured, I have sufficient lubricant to maintain optimal performance throughout our journey. Additional supplies are not required.”

“Mom, look at the display.” Above us, we watched as nebula and distant galaxies swirled among a splatter of stars. A smell came and went as quick as the blink of an eye. I sniffed the air, wondering what it was, but it had faded.

“Nexus, did you release a scent into the room?” Mom asked.

“My apologies, Tracy. This model does not have scent release capabilities and my sensors do not detect any scent particles present.” Slowly the panels above closed as the chairs raised into a sitting position to face the opening window. “We are now stable and en route to the colony. Please enjoy the view. You are free to move about until further notice.”

Mom unbuckled but made no move to get up, instead she stared out the window with her eyes unfocused. The hands she had placed on the arm, as though to push herself up, remained loose. I wanted to say something, make a suggestion to move around, but nothing came to my mind. I jumped when she suddenly shook her head then turned to me.

“Those lounges in the communion area looked comfortable. What do you say we relax in them while we enjoy our elevated status?” Mom finally pushed herself out of the seat, but yelped when she tried to open the doors. “It shocked me! I hope this thing can at least get us where we’re going alive.”

“You go ahead. I’m going to sit in here and watch out the window for a while,” I said. There had been no windows in the pod’s loading room. Besides, our previous situation kept us apart and I was accustomed to being alone.

While the window displayed several stars and nebulae, not much changed and I eventually grew bored. As I stood up, a soft sweet aroma briefly tickled my nose. I paused as an idea came to mind. Then bent over so that my nose was close to the back of the chair, I pushed on the material while smelling the air. Nothing. I leaned down to try the seat.

“What are you doing?” Mom asked.

I jumped and looked up at her. She stood in the doorway with her arms folded and eyes squinted. “When I stood up, I smelled something kind of sweet. I thought it might be in the chair?” I pressed on the seat of the chair and sniffed. “Nope, I don’t smell anything but dust.”

“It was an idea, I suppose,” she said, though her expression remained guarded. “Its close to lunch time. I was just going to grab something, but then realized we never really got to eat together before so…?”

“We’ve never really cooked together either! Please, Mom, can I help too?” I jumped. Mom agreed. Once in the communion area, I rushed to the kitchen side and sat down at the little table. “What are we making? A mystery casserole mix? Ooh! What about crunchy spice cookies?”

“Let’s start off small and work our way up? I’m not much more experienced than you in this,” Mom laughed. “How about.. uh.. tuna salad sandwiches? That shouldn’t be too difficult for either of us.”

It didn’t take much to put canned tuna salad onto a sandwich, I had made many of them myself already, and felt disappointed that our first meal together would be so simple. I nodded reluctantly, but perked up when I noticed Mom setting the ingredients on the table. We were going to make our own tuna salad!

We didn’t talk much while we worked. We tried, but after a few awkward exchanges we both just focused on our tasks. Mom seemed jumpy. Now that I thought about it, she had been like that since the slime. Once in a while I would look up from my sandwich and catch a watchful look on her face.

Did the slime take over my mom? Maybe my body wasn’t strong enough to hold them, and they needed an adult until I got older. I shook my head firmly. “You don’t seem yourself,” I finally said between bites.

Mom’s eyes narrowed while she finished chewing. “I’m not entirely sure,” she began then broke off and restarted. “I’m not used to freedom. I keep expecting the Copperwoods to intercept the shuttle. There’s no reason why they should but,” she faded off with a shrug.

It was my turn to narrow my eyes, though I dared not direct them at my Mom. Instead I eyed the sandwich. What had she started to say? That she wasn’t sure she was herself? Could she have some slime influencing her actions? “I’m not used to this either,” I said instead. “We’ll figure it out, it will just take some practice!” I didn’t feel as excited as my voice sounded.

“You’re such a good little kitty,” Mom laughed. For a moment, I saw a flash of her old self in her eyes. Maybe I didn’t have anything to worry about after all.

“Meow.” I watched as her eyes became watchful again. It hurt. I’d rather be alone than have something masquerade as my mom. I focused my attention on eating and we finished our meal in silence. It ended up being more than we could eat, so it would be eaten for supper. We finished the light cycle in mostly silence with brief bursts of awkward interactions.

Sometime that night I woke up to soft mumbles from the cockpit. A quick look across the hall revealed that Mom’s bunk was still closed. A nudge from my bladder had me climb from my bunk to the hygienic chamber for the toilet. When I entered, a metallic tang floated through the air before fading away.

The hygienic chamber was as cramped as the rest of the shuttle. In one corner, the sanitation pod stood just big enough to hold a single grown adult. There was barely enough room between the sink and sanitation pod to enter, and the toilet sat right against the other side facing a waste bin. Just enough room to be functional, but not enough to stretch without bumping into something.

While washing my hands I noticed a bit of fog on the mirror before the smell briefly reappeared. A smile tugged on the corner of my mouth. It was nice to see Mom enjoy something. Winfred only allowed her a single shower every other light cycle, and we often took turns on who showered. I wiped the mirror and looked up.

There was something written on it. I couldn’t make out what it was, and regretted wiping it off before seeing it. On the left side the letter H was placed above the letter Y, on the right side only the letter E remained. I sighed and finished cleaning off the window before leaving.

The door wouldn’t open. I pushed the release button and fidgeted with the door a few times, nothing. “Mom! Let me out?” As though it would help, I mashed the button rapidly a few times. The smell lingered longer and stronger this time. “MOM! Open the door!”

“I can’t, it’s locked.” Her voice sounded strange, almost detached.

“Mom, this isn’t okay. There’s an emergency release button above the door. Can you pull it, please?” I snapped.

“Watch your tone,” now her voice had some energy to it. Time seemed to stretch out as I waited for the click. “Got it!” Click. Whoosh. “What are you doing up so late?”

“You woke me up talking to Nexus,” I said. Her bunk was now open, the bedding on the cot now messy. Is that what took so long? What was she trying to do?

“No, I was sleeping.” Mom furrowed her brows at me, then glanced towards the cockpit. “I didn’t hear anything until you screamed to open the door.” She crawled back into her cot, then with the push of a button, her bunk closed her inside.

How could she be so calm? Did she somehow cause this? The emergency release also doubled as an emergency locking mechanism. I stared out the window while thoughts chased one another around my mind. I’m not sure when sleep returned.

“Good morning night owl!” Mom called. The smell of coffee and pancakes filled the air as I woke.

I had no desire to argue about who woke who up this early in the morning. “I’m going to study the piloting book more,” I announced while climbing down from my bunk. It had a chapter about common user interface functions that may help me figure out how to get evidence of events, as well as prevent another day of awkward interactions.

“Okay, but not while you’re eating,” she admonished. “I’ll try to find something to read as well so we can sit together in the lounge.”

“I was going to read it in the cockpit,” I complained. “So I can watch out the window and compare the information to Nexus.”

Mom expressed distaste at the idea of spending her day like she’d spent most of her life already. I hurried through my meal, which seemed to worry her, then took the book with me to sit in the cockpit. The door closed behind me and I felt myself relax.

“Nexus, were you talking to someone last night?”

“No.”

“I heard a conversation last night, it woke me up,” I frowned.

“Apologies. If you close your bunk at night, it will reduce sound so that further conversations will not wake you from your slumber.”

“So there was a conversation last night?”

“Yes. There was a conversation last night. However, I was not one of the participants.”

“What was Mom talking to herself about?” I wondered.

“Tracy went to rest shortly after you, and did not leave her bunk until you called for her assistance.”

That made no sense. Was it possible to program an AIUI to give inaccurate information? Maybe its memory could be edited so that it reported events differently than they happened. I thanked Nexus then cracked open my piloting book to the AIUI operator guide.

I studied most of the day, only taking a break when it was time to eat. For lunch Mom prepared a garden salad, later she added imitation chicken to it and wrapped it inside tortillas for dinner. We hadn’t spoken much the whole day, and the silence went past awkward and straight into uncomfortable.

“What have you been doing?” I said, then shoved another bite into my mouth.

“Nothing really. Fighting the demons in my head mostly.” Mom sounded tense. She was picking at her food again like she had at lunch.

I looked up at her then and studied her. Mom’s eyes flickered around everywhere, briefly they would land on me then quickly skitter past to focus on something else. Her shoulders were hunched in as she curled up, leaned in on the table.

“What sort of demons?” I ventured. While the chicken salad wrap had tasted wonderful before, it now seemed bland and unappetizing.

“I’m not supposed to be doing this. There’s no real getting away. There will be punishment, there is always punishment. No matter how clever it was done.” With that, she abandoned her half eaten plate and enclosed herself in her bunker.

I now found myself unable to finish as well. Was Mom talking about her stolen freedom, or did she have something planned? Maybe I should ask her outright if the slime got into her as well. I tidied up, then made a choice. I had to know. I don’t know what I would do about it but I had to know.

I knocked on her bunk and called out to her. No sound came from within, the door didn’t open either. Though, the panel did shock me a little. I retreated into the cockpit.

“Nexus,” I whispered. “I need you to record visual and audio activity tonight, except for inside the bunks and hygienic chamber.” Two green lights appeared, the only indication that my command was heard. I climbed into my bunk, then closed and locked it to go to sleep.

“Let. Me. OUT!” I jolted awake, hitting my head on the bunk roof. “NOW!” Mom sounded angry, and a little afraid. It reminded me of when she’d talk about if Winfred found me hiding during brief stolen moments together.

“Coming!” I called out and pushed on the release for my bunk door. There was a slight delay before it slowly creaked open and a metallic tang wafted into my nose. The hallway illuminated in deep amethyst light, signaling the dead hours of the light cycle when all slept. I found the emergency release and pulled it.

“What the hell were you thinking?! Why did you take so long?”

“Mom, relax please,” I cried. “The hygienic chamber locked on me last night too, remember? Then when I tried to get out of my bunk, it didn’t seem to want to open. Maybe we should just make all the doors except the sanitation pod stay open.”

“I’m not your mother! No, you took over and replaced my daughter and promised you’d give her back to me! Now you’re stalking around behind my back, plotting to ruin me.”

Nobody had ever yelled at me before, granted I’d only ever talked to Mom and Nexus, but it was still new and painful. Tears came unbidden and unable to stop them I fled to the cockpit with Mom right behind me. Demanding that I give Jessie back to her.

“Nexus, please show Mom the recording from while we slept,” I hiccuped. “Show her that I didn’t lock her in her bunker.”

This caused Mom to stop and fold her arms suspiciously. We watched as the screen played the events from that night. We didn’t have to wait long to see that something had indeed happened. The hygienic chamber opened and a humanoid blur walked while another exited the cockpit. They met at the kitchen table, where they had a distorted and warbled conversation.

“Nexus, how many life forms are on this shuttle?” I asked.

“There are only two life forms on board this shuttle.” The two figures turned from the table.

“What about parasitic life forms?” Mom snapped.

“There are no unknown parasitic life forms, the known parasitic life forms consist only of harmless forms regularly featured in human biology.”

“So, there are only two present aboard the shuttle,” I concluded.

“No. There are four present aboard this shuttle.” The two figures turned to Mom’s bunk and pulled the emergency locking mechanism. On the screen, Mom began to call for me to release her.

“You said there are only two life forms?”

“Correct. There are four present aboard this shuttle. There are two life forms aboard this shuttle. Goodnight.” The two figures turned towards my bunk, they began to pull on the lock but my door had already begun opening.

We looked at each other as Nexus powered itself down. I tried everything I knew to bring it back online but it refused to respond. A quick check of the available monitors revealed the course was still correctly set to arrive at our intended destination.

“Okay, so the ship is haunted. What harm can a ghost really do? We’ll be fine.” The two figures on the screen turned towards the cockpit. The screen went off. The lights began to flicker. I reached out for Mom as the temperature began to drop and metallic tang filled the air.

Together we backed as far from the door as we could, but the cockpit was cramped enough to provide no place to run. Before long I could see my breath crystallize in the air. The lights flickered more rapidly. I could now see the figures in front of me, like a humanoid mirage caused by waves of something. It was too cold to be heat, though it reminded me of heat waves, and I was unaware of any waves brought on by intense cold.

They approached steadily, and though it grew so cold the tips of my fingers stung, they never became more than a waver. Mom and I huddled close, though the little warmth she provided did little comfort. The lights flickered, but this time they remained off. I whimpered and tucked my face into the crook of Mom’s neck. I felt her do the same to me. I squeezed my eyes tight, though I couldn’t tell much difference, and waited.

“Good morning,” Nexus said.

My head snapped up and I looked around the cockpit. The lights had returned in a rose colored hue to signify the start of the next light cycle, the time display read seven in the morning, the temperature display showed it to be mild. I still felt cold, though it was now abating.

“Nexus, how many are present?” I asked, my voice tiny.

“There are two present on the shuttle.” I looked at the screen that now displayed the video again. The recording from last night now appeared normal, the figures we’d seen last night no longer showed on the screen.

Mom placed her hand on my elbow and gave a gentle tug, leading me out of the cockpit and into the communion area. We sat at the table on the kitchen side, but made no move to fix anything for some time. We sat there for half an hour, though it didn’t feel that long, before Mom got up and began working.

“That was real,” she said as she pulled a selection of dried fruits down. “We both saw it, we both experienced extreme temperature drop. We’ve both been locked in.” Mom placed the fruit into a blender and reached for a powdered yogurt mix.

“I thought you were replaced by the slime, just pretending to be my mother,” I whispered. “I’m sorry.”

“Don’t,” she stroked my hair then grabbed some seasonings, “I thought the same about you. It was easier to blame everything on the slime. The slime could be fought. How do you fight a ghost?”

We waited without speaking while the blender loudly mixed everything together. I was grateful for the smoothie. I had no interest in eating actual food, even food that tasted better than anything we’d had before, but could make myself drink something.

“We won’t arrive until tomorrow, a few hours before the rest shift starts,” I told her. “We’re going to have to make it one more night.”

“Each night has gotten worse. There’s nowhere to go. Can we travel faster? We won’t make it another night.”

“ There's restrictions on the shuttle to control its speed. So far they’ve only locked us into places. I can disable the emergency lock, it won’t lock or release, and jam our bunks open.”

“They were coming for us last night. That’s going to make it easier for them to get to us.”

“And being in bed won’t? There’s no way out of the bunks, I don’t know if I want to be cornered into them. Last night they were going to lock both of us in our bunks. How would we get out then?”

“We can sleep in the lounge,” Mom suggested, “or we could stay up during the rest shift. Then we would be awake when they get here instead of being woken up by them. It’s only at rest that anything happens. We have coffee.”

“I’ll check the emergency lighting, see if it can be switched on manually somewhere, also if we can just skip the rest shift of the light cycle. Keep it on active shift until we arrive tomorrow.”

“You can’t skip the rest shift. There were some employers that toyed with the light cycle to mess with their employees' sleep. It led to a major accident about twenty cycles ago that caused a lot of injuries. Since then the cycle cannot be changed or altered.”

We finished our smoothies then got started on everything. Mom slept first, while I made the preparations she couldn’t help with. I woke her up in time for us to have a late lunch, then we did the work that required both of us. It took longer than I expected to remove the bunker doors. Then it was my turn to sleep.

Mom would wake me with just enough time to eat supper and drink a few cups of coffee before the horror would begin. I struggled more than I expected to fall asleep, my nerves wrecked over the oncoming rest shift. I must have drifted off at some point because Mom shook me awake.

The lights began to flicker while I was on my fourth cup of coffee. The status screen showed it to be approaching the rest cycle, and moderate temperature even though the air already had a chill to it. Mom’s eyes locked onto mine and we nodded. It had begun.

“Nexus, switch us to emergency lighting. The lights on the rest cycle appear to be malfunctioning on our end.” Mom called out as I made my way to the manual switch.

“My sensors indicate the rest cycle lighting to be functioning correctly. There is no need for emergency lighting, but I will honor your request.” The lights continued to flicker at an increasing speed. “Emergency lighting has been activated. Would you like to switch to regular lighting after the rest cycle is complete?”

I opened the panel behind a display providing kitchen safety and manually switched on the emergency lighting. There was a slight delay, before a faint sickly yellow light turned on. It was just a thin small rope light, at the top and bottom of each wall. I provided barely enough to navigate through the shuttle safely.

“Thank you. Yes please,” Mom answered it. We weren’t sure how safe Nexus was during the rest cycle, and felt we’d be safer if it knew as little as possible about our activities.

We positioned ourselves into the lounge, the largest area in the shuttle where we would have the best opportunity to escape. At first it seemed like nothing would happen, or maybe we imagined everything last night. Then we heard it.

Angry whispers seemed to surround us, like two people were stage whispering an argument from opposite ends of the shuttle. I tried to pick up what the one in the shuttle said, but the words sounded too scrambled.

“Okay,” Mom whispered. “They’re just ghosts. They’re incorporeal. They can’t really hurt us, just make it really cold.”

“Mom!” I whispered back. “In every story that I have ever read, one thing always happens that makes everything worse.”

“What’s that?”

“Somebody saying that it’s not that bad, or that it can’t get worse!” I hissed. The whispering at the ends of the shuttle began to get louder, the temperature lowered further. “See! Now they’re coming.”

“This isn’t a story, honey.”

“Yes it is, Mom! Life is a story. All we can do is try to make it a good one, so that it echoes through time.” I snapped. The ghosts had already heard or seen us, there was no point in whispering now.

“You’re so smart, what a neat way to look at life.”

“I stole it from a book,” I chuckled. The humor was short lived as I heard a new sound. A metallic rattle from the kitchen. Something must have shown on my face because Mom quieted and followed my gaze.

“There!” She pointed. One of the cabinet doors shook, before it slammed open. I pulled my blanket closer, then dodged to the side as a jar flew out at us. “Okay, time to move!” She cried.

An ear piercing screech blasted the air, as though the spirits were angry they had missed us. It had grown so cold now, my breath again crystallized in the air, and revealed the spirits. The first reached for another heavy item to throw, while the second reached to open another cabinet. The bathroom was clear, and had nothing harmful to throw at us.

Dragging our blankets behind us, we raced down the hallway. My blanket brushed against the second figure and it turned to screech at us. A shock of cold stabbed my arm. I gasped and sped up closer to my mom.

We spun around and secured the door as soon as we entered the hygienic chamber. Less emergency lights filled this room, making it darker than the others. The cold remained intact, the temperature neither rising nor falling further. Thuds and screams sounded from the other side of the door.

We began to relax. I turned to smile at Mom as she sat down on the chamber floor with her knees against her chest. She didn’t have room to stretch her legs out. Then I noticed the mirror. It had fogged over like that first night when I’d been locked in here. A soft squeak as though somebody pressed and dragged their finger across the surface. Letters began to slowly appear as I watched. “H.. E…”

“Mom…?” I whined.

“I don’t know sweetie.”

The sounds from outside grew louder, but we couldn’t take our eyes off the mirror. “R… E…” The mirror now read “HERE” and a new letter began to form beneath the H. I didn’t want to know what the message said, there had to be a way to stop it.

“Turn on the sanitation pod, as hot as you can!” Mom shouted as she failed to get off the floor.

“What good would that do?” I stared as the second word finished appearing.

“They make it cold, if we can make it warm maybe they can’t do anything to us. Its better than doing nothing!”

The mirror now said “HERE YOU” and beneath the O a new letter began. I feared what it may be warning, and forced my eyes away to the sanitation pod. I cranked the hot water on as far as it could go and waited. “D…” was now finished and I began to choke on my heart.

“Come here, don’t watch it.” Mom held her arms out to me, and I hid my face in her shoulder again. We waited.

The temperature slowly rose, and the sounds began to fade. It worked. We had survived the night. In as little as six hours we would be exiting the shuttle and safe on a new land. The regular lights came on, a new day cycle had begun. Time flies when you’re terrified it seems. The shuttle landed around lunch time, and Nexus asked if we’d partake in a meal before departing the vessel. We didn’t even stop to answer it.",3,1729515501.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

I'm looking for a recommendation for an all-in-one combo coffee/espresso machine and would love some recommendations. A machine with an iced setting would be awesome.

I drink a good bit of coffee but I'm not an aficionado like I know some people are. I usually drink 2-3 cups per day. In the summer I love a black iced coffee with a shot of espresso, in the winter I make it black with some local honey.

I've done k-cups forever but would like to shake that up and get a machine that makes a better cup of coffee while also being able to make espresso. My wedding is coming up and it feels like the right time to add a good machine to my registry that I can use for years to come. I know these combo machines are not cheap but I'm thinking nothing above $1200.

Together there is always hope! But of course, this isn't news to us. We might have a flat week ahead of us, but National Cat Day (the LONG awaited) is just around the corner and, as you've seen in the title, IV levels are likely getting tasty for some of our #FundFriends out there. We'll take a look at what drove this last Friday and what we can expect heading into this week's trading and our new and shiny November monthly OPEX cycle. Let's go!

**Price Movement Recap**

The defining moment of our price action on Friday was another instance of untraceable interventive shorting. I posted about this in an edit on Friday exactly as I saw it happen at 10:11am EDT:

[10\/18 Trading Day 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/dx5leec2k3wd1.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&s=f362954ccf76f7a876f2c1b3a84e8e9c9646a4a9)

The stock started off the day trading up on some low volume as traders initially took advantage of the steady and highly call-gamma concentrated conditions I called out pre-market. After touching what would be a daily high of $21.61, the price retraced at a normal pace back to VWAP and the 200-min SMA. It was exactly at this point that 120,000 and then 60,000 shares of sell volume materialized on the tape. After some midday recovery and flattening, Charm set in - perhaps with some additional encouraging shorting - to try to get the price under $21 and drive the $21 Calls OTM. This attempt looks to have been countered and the stock closed a full dollar above Max Pain. This might mean some OPEX tailwind for today's trading.

But, why, again, above do I say 'untraceable' and 'interventive' shorting? These orders were undetectable on any data feed. Not on a whale feed, not a dark pool feed, and indeed not in the options data. In fact, the options market looks to have been caught by surprise by this volume, as options traders didn't even respond with Long Puts or Short Calls to ride the dip down to $21.11.

What brought this about? Yesterday was apparently another Computershare recurring buy-in day (supposedly around 500,000 shares). If this is true, and whoever this #FundFriend was did not short the price, we could expect that lengthy recovery in the stock up to $21.50 to be transposed up about $0.50 - putting us at around a high of $22.11.

Again, this is speculation on the motive and aim of this action, but at the very least it serves as a reminder - especially on low volume days - as to the kind of action that institutions can take to control the price. We've seen it AT LEAST half a dozen times here at Open Interest over the past six months.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

[10\/25 OI Changes 10\/18-10\/21](https://preview.redd.it/fscnok31n3wd1.png?width=1867&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bb735b2fe58004e06e1346fa7b16bf847708e62)

With Friday having been a quarterly OPEX, we had a pretty sizable gamma wipe over the weekend. Traders rolled calls and opened new positions into this week off of Friday's deep IV lows late in the day on the expectation of a natural post-OPEX IV spike at today's open. Given that the price dipped sub $21 so close to the close (within about $0.40 of our last monthly cycle's low), this was likely seen as a great swing opportunity for regular traders. 

Accordingly, we had new OI fill in for this Friday's weekly expiry roughly along the same distribution as our set up heading into Friday's trading, though notably our total OI numbers are about 1/4 the numbers we were seeing for October OPEX. We should expect an IV spike out of the gates this morning as a result.

As we look farther out into November OPEX, we also see some new OI expansion, though largely at familiar strikes:

[11\/15 OPEX OI Changes 10\/18-10\/21](https://preview.redd.it/dehe5wlto3wd1.png?width=1858&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bedd83268aeef53a8380e2e809fbdc5108d5ff5)

Although we see a sprinkling of new Puts added to the board and some new calls at higher strikes, the real expansion here is at our familiar whole dollar strikes of $20, $21, $22, which continue to project locked-in stability in that range. Indeed, the Call OI at this point is large enough that it will have a continual influence on MM hedging even throughout this week's trading. While there is a decent-sized Put nugget at $18 (\~4,000 contracts) this OI set-up projects continued stability in our familiar trading range without much downside risk for the time being.

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/h0pwjkoqp3wd1.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&s=95461344cfbb2e3a4c10a53c99bae82c50d2e978

A familiar set-up returns in our gamma landscape. We've got characteristic positive gamma thiccness from $21 up to $22. $22 is going to serve as a Call Wall and upside resistance. $20 is major downside support and price action between $21 and $22 is where most of our destiny looks to lie amid the low-volume conditions we've seen recently. $20.50 has become a bit negatized, if only slightly and on a small amount of low OI.

Some interventive shorting could try to push us into this zone amid enough volume from the options market for a quick rundown to $20.50 which would likely reverse back up above $21 in about an hour (similar to what we saw late on Friday). No major downside volatility is forecasted otherwise. 

Gamma ramp dynamics come into play if we are crazy light on volume, crazy low on IV, and dealers are light on long share hedges for their short call positions heading into the end of the week. 

These are the set-ups, but as we've seen time and time again, how they unfold is going to depend on our overall volume conditions and how the big boys plan on dropping battlefield tactical nukes. I'm not expecting any catalysts this week to pump volume (though you never know), so as I mentioned in my forecasts last week, I'm anticipating a flat week that continues to flirt with $22 at its upper end range.

IV down, RSI down, volume slightly up versus the weekly average (though slightly), and MACD still kept from that realizing that coveted crossover and conversion to a bullish trend. Our 200-day SMA has continued to creep up - now at $19.30 (or our post Q2 Earnings report low), and the 50-day SMA is stagnating at $21.70 (a $0.03 dip versus last Thursday). Indeed, this week the 50-day SMA might slump just a little bit into the $21.60s again as we trade $22+ values from mid-late August for our current daily averages around $21+. If our current price levels remain consistent, we would see the 50-day SMA close downward for about a 10-day stretch into the $21.50s before a return to the upside for a few days as we eliminate our 8/26-8/28 sub-$21 average values. Our 200-day SMA will continue with its inexorable march upward for months to come. 

**IV Trends**

[10-Day Mean IV](https://preview.redd.it/lwua6r04t3wd1.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d513f6eb8c61cc2f13207d926db829efbc16dea)

Friday's interventive shorting turned a potentially IV-elevating day (or at least stagnating) into a serious slump. The daily average IV value of 74% was the lowest seen since our January doldrums sub 70%. This implies that long options values are approaching yearly lows and, thus, yearly discounts. 

While this is not an advertisement for going out and buying long options, it is an important sign. As IV values continue to push toward these discounted levels, bets on bullish reversal for GME will become increasingly appetizing toward institutions who might look to go long on the stock and drive some upward price mobility. At the same time, short options premiums become less and less appetizing for dealers, who might tolerate (or coordinate to stimulate) such moves in order to renew the potency of their GME call-writing cash cow.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

10/25 Weekly OPEX projects for a stable, relatively flat trading environment along our familiar $20-$22 axis. IV values are approaching yearly lows, which may entice institutions to begin to build long call positions on the stock in anticipation for a bullish reversal as our recent 4-month bear trend comes to a close. The 10/29 CATalyst is still on the horizon - and it is possible that institutions are aware of the Reddit hype around this date. Maybe they know and don't care. Maybe they know and do care. Maybe they know and will be 'duped' by the hype to become the CATalyst themselves (as they were back on 9/6). The conditions are certainly there to make a pump extremely lucrative for whoever times it right - if it's going to happen. If it's not going to happen, our immediate signs point to more consolidation, more IV depreciation, and about 5-6 more weeks before the lead-up to Q3 earnings becomes our next identifiable catalyst and target for deviation from our current trading paradigm.

Good luck out there!

Cheers

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I never hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.",99,1729515169.0,Superstonk,8,0.96,False

1g8owoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1g8owoc/i_au_paired_when_i_was_18_and_im_still/,I au paired when I was 18 and I'm still embarrassed that I didn't stand up for myself in that terrible situation,"I'm 24 now, but every now and then it crops up and I get embarrassed thinking how weak I was and how I let myself be taken advantage of. 

I went straight out of school because I didn't know what I wanted to do in uni, and a gap year seemed like a safe option. I'd au paired the summer before and it had gone relatively well. That being said, I was a mess of a human being. I left school with one friend because I got so depressed in my final year that I didn't really care about anyone there, and as a result other people hated me for my attitude and my unwillingness to fake it to fit in. I knew the whole time I'd never see them again, and I was just counting down the days until I could leave. 

When I first moved in with the host family, it started off okay - they got me settled, help me sort out the required documents and set me up with a bus pass. We looked into German lessons, but there weren't any affordable ones for a few months (the family provided €50 a month towards it and I had no savings). I didn't think anything of this until a couple months later when other au pairs told me they hadn't done German lessons and their host families had given the €50 directly to them - I never saw the money between July and December for the lessons I didn't take. 

I was supposed to work 30 hours a week, but this didn't happen. At first, the father was finishing up his paternity leave so he was helping me get settled and I didn't mind because he was showing me how things were done, what food/appliances were where etc. Suddenly I was working 10 hour days, 5 days a week because my free time didn't start until the mother came home at 6pm. 

Then he went back to work and I was on my own - only the kid hadn't settled into kindergarten yet, so I'd take him them, leave him two hours, then had to look after him til one of the parents came home. I don't think I said anything here because I thought eventually he would be there all day and I'd begin the routine that was outlined in our contract - and it did. When he finally went to school for the full day, I was finally working my 30 hour week. 

Only I wasn't, because somehow it had become a thing that I would do another 6 hours of work on a Saturday. So a 36 hour week with no extra money. 

When the kid was sick, they wouldn't take time off work, I would have to look after him. 

The mother told me she was pregnant again after I had arrived. Halfway through the expected year, she gave birth and started maternity leave. In fairness to her, she never asked me to look after the newborn while the other kid was at kindergarten (unless it just while she had a shower or something small), but she would always want to hang out or ask me to help with other things. I soon began getting a bus into the city every morning after taking the kid to school and wandering around, stopping to read in cafe's where I could get €2 coffees and €1 pastries. I'd sit and read, and these are some of my most peaceful memories at the time (which is so depressing looking back).

Starting German lessons helped too because I met more au pairs and began to make friends and explore the area. When I'd speak to them about my situation, they would urge me, beg me and even get irritated that I wouldn't stand up for myself. 

I ended up handing in my notice early, although I gave them two months notice (instead of the 2 weeks I only needed to give per my contract). I went home for a week, and when I came back I told them I'd have to cut it a week shorter because my passport was expiring (and I had no money to replace it). The mother then started yelling at me, how I was inconveniencing them by cutting the contract short, yelling at me about how they had to go through the effort of finding my replacement, yelling at me that I was messing them around. I just shut down and couldn't get a word out - when I really wanted to say ""I only owe you two weeks notice""

The entire thing was a mess. I eventually left and I was so relieved. I'd spent three years (including school) now trapped in situations that I thought I could make work but turned into disasters. I couldn't stand up for myself at all. Looking back, I keep thinking about how trapped I felt - I lived in their home, I relied on their money, I was in a country that I didn't know very well, she would yell at me, they would constantly act like I was the problem, they would yell at me if I stayed out past midnight the night before work. I remember they once had a party on my day off, and she shouted into my room at midday ""well, are you going to help?"" then made me clean my room so that the guests could come in and admire their renovations. 

I'm so embarrassed, especially now that I've learned to stand up for myself or quit. I was so unhappy and I let myself be. I never told my family exactly how bad it was, although I don't think they would have encouraged me to leave early anyway (or book me a short notice ticket so I could escape). 

I acted out a lot as a result of this - on my Saturday evenings I would get hammered with strangers and get myself into terrible situations. I put myself in danger a lot. I can't blame the host family for this, but I can see why I was absolutely desperate to enjoy myself when I did get time off. Something happened, and I'd then spend my Saturday nights in my room alone, chatting to my friends online with a cheap bottle of wine. Sometimes I'd even treat myself to a pizza!

My replacement left within two months - she had to go home for some reason then never came back. I'm so glad for her. 

I was just a passive person and I didn't get myself out. I had some good times, but whenever I reflect on it now I'm just embarrassed. ",1,1729515045.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

Though they lived miles apart, their stories would soon intertwine in an inspiring tale of resilience, friendship, and the search for a healthier life.

Jenna, a 38-year-old graphic designer, was juggling her career and parenting her energetic seven-year-old son. Despite her hectic schedule, she found herself stuck in a cycle of failed diets and workout routines. Each time she scrolled through social media, seeing friends celebrate their fitness victories, a pang of envy struck her. She longed to feel that way, but the weight around her midsection seemed to have other plans.

One rainy Saturday morning, while savoring her usual cup of coffee, Jenna stumbled upon a blog post titled “Java Burn Coffee — A Game-Changer or Just Hype?” Intrigued by the idea of a weight loss supplement that could easily blend into her coffee routine, she began to do her research. The article highlighted Java Burn’s natural ingredients, including chlorogenic acid and green tea extract, which were known for their weight-loss benefits. Encouraged by the promise of a 60-day money-back guarantee, Jenna decided to take the plunge.

**The Taste of Transformation**

Meanwhile, in Chicago, Emma Carter, a marketing executive in her late thirties, faced her own challenges. Long hours at work left her with little time to focus on health, and stubborn weight around her midsection clung to her like an unwanted guest. One day, while scrolling through a health blog, she came across Java Burn Coffee and felt an instant connection to Jenna’s story. The seamless integration of Java Burn Coffee into her coffee routine seemed like a potential solution to her struggles.

Excited but skeptical, Emma ordered Java Burn Coffee, and within days, she was mixing it into her morning coffee, just as Jenna had done. The flavor remained unchanged, and soon, subtle changes began to occur. Her energy levels surged, her cravings diminished, and the stubborn weight began to budge.

**Finding Support in Sisterhood**

As Jenna and Emma navigated their respective journeys, a beautiful friendship began to blossom. Jenna shared her Java Burn Coffee success with her friend Lisa over coffee one day, inspiring Lisa to join her on the journey. Emma, on the other hand, excitedly relayed her progress to her friend Sarah, who was struggling with similar weight issues. Both pairs became each other’s accountability partners, encouraging one another and sharing healthy recipes.

Weeks turned into months, and both women started to see remarkable transformations. Jenna lost a solid 25 pounds and found herself more engaged with her family. She started planning outdoor activities and even cooked healthier meals, inspiring her son to try new foods. Emma, too, shed ten pounds and felt empowered to embrace life fully, thanks to the newfound energy that Java Burn Coffee provided.

**A Celebration of Change**

The journeys were not without their challenges. Jenna faced moments of doubt, especially when the scale didn’t budge as quickly as she hoped. Emma experienced similar frustrations, but through it all, their friendships flourished. They shared laughter, tears, and, most importantly, unwavering support. Their morning coffee rituals evolved into moments of connection, where they celebrated small victories and reminded each other that health is not just about the numbers on a scale.

Eventually, they decided to organize a gathering to celebrate their transformations and inspire others. Surrounded by friends, Jenna and Emma shared their stories of perseverance, emphasizing the importance of community and finding simple solutions that fit into daily life. Their journey wasn’t just about weight loss; it became a testament to empowerment and the strength found in friendship.

As Jenna reflected on her experience, she realized that Java Burn Coffee had become more than just a supplement for her; it was a symbol of resilience and determination. Emma felt the same way, knowing that her decision to try Java Burn Coffee had ignited a spark in her life that she thought was lost.

**A Final Reflection**

Today, Jenna and Emma continue to thrive, living healthier and more fulfilling lives. They’ve both embraced the journey, understanding that transformation is a marathon, not a sprint. The laughter and support shared over countless cups of coffee have left a lasting impact, reminding them that every small step counts.

In a world filled with quick fixes and fleeting diets, Jenna and Emma's stories serve as a beacon of hope. With determination and the right tools, anyone can achieve their health goals, one cup of coffee at a time. So, if you’re standing at the edge of your own journey, take a leap of faith—you never know what beautiful transformations await. **Start your transformation today with Java Burn Coffee, which will make a difference in your way of life.** [https://javaburn.com/](https://freezegluco.com/Javaburn.html)",1,1729515012.0,celebrityweightlose,0,1.0,False

1g8ouba,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1g8ouba/just_advice/,Just advice.,"I  2019 I lost my wife suddenly. She was 32. My daughter who was 4 lost her mom. Since then Ive also lost some friends to illness. I went from loving my life and believing in God, to losing faith and hope, to gaining a new awareness and appreciation for life and Christ. In all, the last 5 years can be described as exhausting. Physically and mentally.

During my trip down the road of grief I started to journal, which led to me sharing my pksts, which led to a public blog, which led to me creating and running a grief support program here in my city that meets every other week. Its been a long road to this point.

I wanted to write to say a couple things that maybe someone wants or needs to read today. 

First, dont assume your path will mirror someone elses. I remember the 1st support group i went to after losing my wife Kim. It was a month after she passed. A woman stood up to speak and said how she had been coming to the group for 9 years. 9 years! This was such a punch to my gut because I wanted the pain to stop. The loneliness to go away. The fear to leave. I wanted it NOW. Hearing that Id be like this for 9 years floored me. The thing is, her story didnt have to be mine. Truth is, there are some people who eventually identify with their grief and dont want to let it go for various reasons. Some dont want to lose the pain because they worry that means they are losing that love they shared. Others feel it means theyve moved on away from their person in a bad way. 

Second, it takes TIME. There is no fast forwarding grief. Ive seen many people come to my program because they tried 1 therapist that didnt work, then they come to abgroup a meeting or two, then try reiki, then rapid eye movement, then psychic mediums, then reiki etc etc. Working through griefs alot like working on your physical body. If you go to the gym a couple times, sit down and watch everyone exercise you wont attain your physical goals. Same applies to your mind. If you dont put in the hard work consistently, you wont heal. What does that work look like? Well thats different for everyone. Im not knocking any type of grief treatment...whether its a therapist or reiki, but pick a lane and work on it and gove it time. It wont happen overnight.

Lastly, ignore all of the slogans and grief cliches. Youll hear ""the 2nd year is worse than the 1st"", ""the 1st year i was in a fog"", ""just breathe"", ""youll never be the same""....the list goes on. Look, These may be true to the person saying them to you but they may not be true to you. Your path might be entirely different. Furthermore, one of these types of sayings (there are many believe me) might have been a negative thing for someone else but a positive thing for you. For instance, its true for me that I will never be the same. Thank God! 6 years ago I wouldnt be writing this, concerned for people ill never meet. I wouldnt be running a website and a grief support program for free. I wouldnt be meeting w strangers regularly over a coffee to talk about our paths. I wouldve been more concerned about NFL scores from the weekend than your tears. My faith in God wouldve been lukewarm as it was my whole life. So much changed, but today I know that my wifes passing saved me and probably our daughter in many ways.

Look I could go on, but know this. The road is tough but your not travelling it alone. Just like and journey, there are many ways to get to where you want to be at. My gps route doesnt need to be yours. When you write your post on here seeking advice and asking questions, take comfort in the replies that resonate with you and discard the rest. If someone tries to give you medicine that tastes too bitter, dont drink it yet. Give yourself time to heal. I promise you will gwt there if you decide you want to and you allow yourself to heal. Believe it or not, this is probably the most important step of all.

I am in college studying engineering and near my school I frequent a coffee shop. I am a regular there. I met some cool people there and it’s a nice place to grab a coffee and read. I saw a girl that comes there as well I could say she is also a regular, I see her almost weekly. I am an avid reader and pretty much always reading classic novels drinking a macchiato(a routine that relaxes me). First time I saw her she was reading Jane Austen and she sat next to me, I remember thinking she’s gorgeous and actually reads a classic like me. Ever since then I notice her in the crowd, I am sure there are many regulars there and I don’t know them but her, I NOTICE HER PRESENCE. And I KNOW she notices me too because almost all the time we make eye contact and crack a smile. Sometimes i would be leaving the coffee shop and she would be walking toward it, we would pass each other on the road and I can’t control my smile and she smiles from far away till we pass each other. 
A little background on me, I am relatively new to the country been here since I was 18(no family members at all and only had $45 when I arrived) so It was a struggle to stabilize my living situation and go to school while working and learning new culture. But I am doing well now well acclimated so that’s why I am a little late to college 2nd year undergraduate at 27. It was really difficult to get here and so I HAVE NEVER HAD A GIRLFRIEND. I’ve had sexual encounters with several women but NEVER a relationship. So I have a certain level of anxiety about it. I am always self conscious about my finances my career and where I should be at 27 etcetera so I never thought about dating someone till I am done developing myself in to the man I want to become.
But, I can’t get her out of my mind. Now whenever I go to the coffee shop I am thinking “I wonder if I see her today” . Recently I was drinking coffee and reading on the patio and she came and sat next to me and she had her mom with her(I know it’s her mom because she called her “mom”). The entire time her mom and her barely said a word to each other. When I stood up to leave both of them were looking at me smiling 🙂. I said “hello” and smiled and left. At this point am feeling STUPID, because I’ve missed soooo many chances to strike up a conversation. I am almost done I promise lol. Now two weeks ago I was leaving the coffee shop she was coming in and I see a guy with her. She looks me dead in the eyes 👀 I didn’t even look at the guy I just smiled and kept walking. The 3 days later I see her there and the guy is sitting with her, and he’s not facing me but she was and we looked at each other a couple of times. When she went to order a coffee she placed an order and turned around and she would look at me. We saw each other today she was by herself didn’t have her book bag or nothing just dressed beautifully and she got her coffee and left. 
I feel like I a dumbass. I feel like a useless idiot. Now I know I am supposed to talk to her I know that. But I don’t know how to go about it. What if I speak to her and all this is just in my head what if she doesn’t even know I exist, like she just looked at me like a random guy. And now she might have a man. Wouldn’t it be weird? How can I go about it. Please help me. I WANT HER.  DID I BLOW IT? 😔😔😔😔😔",1,1729514767.0,BrosDatingAdvice,1,1.0,False

As cafés evolve to meet the expectations of modern customers, the 4-lane LED QR code coffee-tea vending machine offers an innovative solution that combines speed, convenience, and customisation.

For café owners aiming to enhance customer satisfaction and streamline operations, this advanced vending machine can be a game-changer. Let’s explore how this technology can benefit your café and why it's a smart investment.

What is a 4-Lane LED QR Code Coffee-Tea Vending Machine?

A 4-lane coffee-tea vending machine is an automated self-service unit that allows customers to choose and pay for drinks across four lanes, offering a wide variety of coffee and tea options.

Each lane operates independently, allowing multiple users to order at once, reducing wait times and enhancing the overall service experience.

With its LED display, customers can easily browse options and make selections, while the QR code payment system simplifies the payment process for a faster, cashless transaction.

Key Benefits of a 4-Lane Coffee-Tea Vending Machine for Cafés

Boost in Operational Efficiency: A four-lane coffee vending machine allows you to serve multiple customers simultaneously, speeding up service during peak hours.

Whether it's the morning coffee rush or a busy lunchtime, this machine ensures customers aren’t left waiting in line for long, improving overall satisfaction and boosting your café’s capacity to serve more people efficiently.

Convenient QR Code Payment System: The QR code payment feature lets customers pay for their drinks directly from their mobile phones, eliminating the need for cash or card transactions.

In a world that’s moving towards contactless payments, this technology is ideal for offering a smooth, quick, and secure purchasing experience, making your café more efficient and reducing queues.

Customisation at Customers’ Fingertips: This vending machine allows users to customise their drinks—whether it’s choosing between different types of coffee and tea or adjusting the sugar, milk, or strength of the beverage.

The clear LED screens guide customers through these choices, ensuring they get their preferred drink without any confusion. The ability to tailor drinks to individual preferences adds a personalised touch that customers will love.

Round-the-Clock Service: If your café is in a location where late-night or early-morning customers are frequent, such as in hospitals, airports, or office buildings, this self-service coffee and tea vending machine can keep serving customers even when your staff aren’t available.

Its 24/7 availability ensures that customers always have access to their favourite beverages, enhancing convenience.

Space-Saving Design for Maximum Efficiency: Modern coffee and tea vending machines are designed to be compact and efficient, making them ideal for cafés with limited space.

Despite their size, they can produce a variety of high-quality drinks, ensuring that your customers receive a premium experience without requiring extra floor space.

Over the years, he just mainly had bad anger issues. It’s hard for me to recount a lot of things. But I know he broke a lot of stuff in the home, punched holes in the walls, and attacked me a couple times. I was very distraught off and on through the years. I am a very strong willed person, and I was raised to move on everyday from the bad things. Basically I was good at forgetting, and pretending it never happened.

2 years ago almost, he got mad at me on morning for “running my mouth” so he broke a glass coffee table. We were back and forth arguing. I was cleaning the glass up by sweeping. He got in my face and taunted me telling me to hit him etc. my mom came in the door, she seen all this. Idk what happened but I ended up hitting him with the broom, I just snapped. He immediately called the cops, I actually was put in jail over it. Right infront of my kids. 

When I got out, it’s like my mentality toward him finally changed. I seen him so different. 

He called me fat and ugly a lot during arguments. Would say nobody would ever love me like he did, especially with already having kids. So I should stop being so “ungrateful” 

I finally turned 30, lost a lot of weight, started taking better care of myself. and just got so tired of it. I got my hair done one day, he poured water on my head and told me it was ugly and stupid. So I kicked him out. That’s was over a month ago. 

He blows up my phone, calls me names, calls my mom and tells her he’s taking my kids from me because I assaulted him and they aren’t safe. Told me he won’t financially help with them. I’m paying ALL the bills, barely. He shows up and tells me the yard needs work and this and that. Tells me I’m trash cause I “can’t do it all since he’s gone” 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. He says this is all my fault and he only was ever like that because I ran my mouth and treated him horrible. I’m trying to stay strong but it’s so so hard ",0,1729514436.0,AskWomenOver30,13,0.5,False

We are traveling to celebrate my sons 5th birthday - he wanted snow and what better place than the arctic circle lol. I know it’s going to miserably cold but I think he’ll enjoy the novelty of it all. 

We plan to fly in and out of Copenhagen from India as those are the least expensive tickets we can find. We plan to do 4 days in Copenhagen, 3/4 days in Kiruna, 4 days in Stockholm, maybe 1 more day in copenhagen before departure. 

Things we’ve broadly listed to do: 
Copenhagen 
-experimentarium 
-lego store 
-copenhagen zoo
-rosenborg palace 
-Tivoli christmas market 
-nyhvan 
-orsted park/torvehallerne
-a public children's library 
- a kid friendly art or design musuem 

Kiruna 
-Husky dog sledding (hopefully on his birthday!)
-northern lights 

Stockholm
-Skansen
-Vasa musuem 
-a good children's public library 
-ikea (my husband and I just really like IKEA lol)
-juinbacken
-Gamla stan christmas market 
-tyresta national park (would weather permit?)

I'd love & appreciate any suggestions you can throw at us in terms of whether these activities are doable or are there any more suitable for our group/interests/weather. 

We enjoy cozy cafes, good food and art. Or chill places to grab a drink where kids would be welcome too. Would welcome any suggestions around these as well! 

We plan to stay in airbnbs for most of our trip. If there are any tried & tested hotels/boutique hotels, we'd love to experience those too. 

We want the trip to be relaxed and fun with lots of art, food and coffee + experiences for my son that he wouldn't have back home.

After a leisurely brunch in Harper’s Ferry we got on the trail early afternoon. Twenty-six miles, found a campsite with nobody already there (they are first come, first serve) so we took it and settled in. Bonus — was near a town, White’s Ferry, so we scored a couple cold beers, and some coconut water for the next morning.

Day two, 40 miles, into D.C., right up to the Capitol, then into the hill district for a delicious late lunch from our friend. Glass of wine, nice chat, and we rushed off to catch our 4 p.m. train back to Harper’s Ferry!

We are both experienced backpackers, with the usual gear, so our ‘system’ involved strapping our tent, sleeping bags etc. to our Topeak pannier frames as best we could. I also have some cheap panniers that I pushed to the limit, but they worked. Wife’s duffel bag was quite a sight to see as we rode through D.C., coffee cups clinking off the back.

Singing the same song, cover masks and costumes 





Acetylcholine, if the shoe fits 

Cinderella speeding, burning up and disappearing

Oh Prince, oh prince, serotonin stepsister

Quetty P for your brand new you





Cadaver on stop 9..4

Blood and bones in the dollar store 

Operation/operation all a laugh

The world turns on wheels of sponge





Ignorant to be ignorant 

Blinded leading the blind

This a dream or a mind-bind

Every room has its elephant





Sunrise and sunset, cradle to black tomb

Moon howls at the cold cold womb 

The stars don’t care, tremble in fear

Born again, only 1 end is near





Teddy bear trance traps 

Repression regression a cathedral-campus 

Messenger from a Drowned God, cross life’s stormy Holy-See

In my bones I once was a forest and the True Cross

The fleet of the Theseus and the lips of Orpheus





A cross is too light to wear

Lappelled on a bleeding heart 

Pin up girl in a pin up whirl

Perfect pretty poison puke

Masterbation and flagellation

The pleasure of pain

The pain of pleasure 

At your leisure





Suicide risk, a firestorm in a pocket

Razor blades are hammer/star/sickle

A dancing mind races a rocket 

Chokehold fancies are tickled.





Skyscrapers built on apple trees and snake spines 

Milk and honey flow like blood down washed out streets

Sluts and their ribs feast and starve to a leech’s envy

Suburban pareidolia, the Face of God in the Dow Jones





Laugh at the world (listen) laugh at yourself 

Mirror and a window, my eyes and ears 

A fucken freak, un-disgraced (under)overachiever 

Tender and brittle-tough, heart of glass leads weapon-shards to cut

Laugh at the bloodshed, brutality (scream) laugh at it all





I take my hands in my arms and kiss my lips

I am fire desire, I am I am I 

Self immolating loving, bittersweet autocannibal

Pawn star; whoring a sickness for dollar-dimes

A medicine of mine and mine alone

Never so alone when dancing drunk at death’s door





Spirits in the low light snoring and whoring 

Sell your soul to Freud and Faust

A voice is the dark, isn’t nightmare

NOTHING BUT AND NOTHING MORE

The same old lines and the same old words

Same old same old same old pills

For a kaleidoscope of renewed wounds





Black coffee, blacker night

White walls, whiter noise

Is it dim or is it grey

A mind so black in a room too white

Well then you’ve gotta be tough (obey)

If you’re (ever) gonna get out of here

Alive, half dead, a life, a new man





Born with a silver spoon in my mouth

But biting down on a dirty rag

Numbs the pain, I love you little Susie

I'd say the only 'habit' I have left is using a thc gummy edible to wind down in the hours before bed. I don't intend to ditch this, yet, as I'm new to not relying on alcohol to unwind.  

In the mornings, I wake VERY early, usually by 4 AM to get to the gym and complete my workout before the kids need to get out the door for school.

And honestly, for the rest of the day I was in an on and off cycle of eating. My weight has never been a factor or issue, but I never felt 'great.' Today, I decided to give I.F. a try. Surprisingly, I got the noon mark with some ease. This would mark a window of 8 PM- 12 PM that I didnt eat. 16 hours, is that recommended? (I had dessert at 8.) To my surprise, I feel better than I normally do at baseline, in terms of bloating (not as bad as I often struggle with) and more energy.

I had to modify my goals after turning my ankle in July, but was still shooting for 1/ Finish, 2/ 4:20, 3/ 4:00. 

My training went pretty good. The turned ankle early on impacted my goal times, which I reset once I was back to running. I had to watch how fast I ran and remove hills for a bit, but better to run than not! I had added a few more miles here and there to the plan, not to make up for anything, but just to push. I wanted a 20+ miler, as I wanted to feel a bonk before. I didn’t feel the bonk, mainly because I ran it easier. 

Taper week was a bit of a drain, due to family emergencies. I didn’t have time to rest up, and every thing was emotionally charged. At first, I wasn’t sure if I’d get to run. I obviously did run, so there’s that. But the week was a bummer. 

The day before, my stress was quite high. Couldn’t get to sleep and tried to rest. I ended up with about 4 hours of sleep. My normal preparation (coffee, banana) didn’t yield normal results (no morning BM). I got ready and headed to the start line hoping to use a portajohn before the race (no go). 

The start was great, a little warmer than I hoped for. I lost my extra layer before we started. The national anthem played, I got into race mode, and tried to focus on my plan as the corrals went through. I hung near the back of my corral. 

 When my corral started, I tried to focus on my plan. Get a couple of easy miles in and try to settle into a groove. I hit play on my headphones only to get nothing (they were paired with my watch and my watch had gone into battery save countdown 2 times in the corral. I think it was disconnected during one of these times). Welp, let’s move to the plan. 

The first couple miles were a little faster than I planned. Each was about :10 off of goal pace and I was targeting about :30 slower. So, not bad. Kept my shoulders down, kept talking myself down from the excitement. 

Miles 3 and 4 were uphill and I just wanted to focus on keeping my HR low. They were a bit slower, but I was good. I knew I’d let things go on the downhill to get some time back. I got some great photos of the skyline on the way up and executed my plan. When I got to the bottom of the hill, I walked a bit to pair my phone to my headphones.  I wanted some music. 

Miles 4-7 were nice and easy. A bit of weaving, but I didn’t think it was that bad. I was putting time in the bank and running about :10 / mile faster than goal. I felt good and relaxed, the weather was cool and was warming a bit. I figured I could use a bit of a buffer and, as long as it felt good, I’d hang there. Got a bit of traffic coming up a tunnel, but just hung back instead of weaving in and out. 

The next 6 were nice and mostly flat. A part of me wanted to go, but I focused on my mile pace and stayed in a decent range. I got through the first half on my watch in what I thought was perfect time. About 13.4 miles in, I passed the 13.1 flag. With my bank time, I was still good for 4:00. I knew I needed to watch weaving in the second half. 

Around mile 14, my music stopped. Ugh. I wanted to line up some power songs for the last 10k. I walked a bit to try to get the songs back, but now my phone wasn’t streaming or playing anything I downloaded. F it. Time to get moving. 

I held the pace through 18, when I started to get a little hip pain. I slowed it down a hair so I wasn’t in pain, kept it manageable. 4:00 was still in my sight and I didn’t want to pack it in. I used my training miles as a mantra to keep myself moving. I did about 1200 during training, what’s another 8?

At mile 20, I noticed I was now about .35 miles extra from weaving.  That was good. I kept it a bit lower, but not gone. Time was still with me and it was the last 10k. I didn’t feel like I could race it, but I kept going.  Part of me wanted to walk a bit and I used the hydration stations as a bit of a break to keep moving. I can’t drink from a cup and run anyways and I felt better coming out than I didn’t going in. It was a bit disheartening seeing the people ahead of my on their way back in while I was heading out. I felt like turning in at one point. Not a way to top off my training. I kept heading out and trying to look away from those in front.  

I kept watching how close to 4 I was and tried to use math to distract me. Could I do 4? I was so close. I hit mile 23 and knew it was close. I had a bit of time in the bank, but I needed at least .35 extra. I had 3:30 to spare, so I was coming close. 

Miles 23-25.5 hurt bad. My feet were pounding, one was hurting. I found out later I had a nice new blister on a toe. I was losing some of the banked time, but I was also seeing how close I was to my goals. I just couldn’t keep the pace I wanted. I slowed down a bit more, thinking maybe I could regroup mentally for a strong push. It worked. 

At 25.5. I turned it on a bit. I was around a 9:30 pace for that first half mile and brought it back to a 9:00 pace for mile 26. I estimated I was still .55 away and had about 6 minutes. It was going to be close!

I dug deep for it after 26. I was listening to my body to see if anything was tightening up or hurting more. I let my stride increase a bit more. Honestly, passing people in that last half mile felt great! I tried to cheer them on, I mentally did for most of them. But I kept the pedal down while it felt good. 

When I made the last turn, I saw the finish line in front of me. I glanced at the clock and knew I could do it. I kept the pedal down and finished strong! Watch time was 3:59:24 for 26.6. Chip time was 3:59:18. 

For my next race, I’m going to start my music 10 minutes early from my watch. I ended up with about 2 minutes of walk/idle time, not to mention the frustration. And, if my music stops next time, I’m just going to leave it off. 

Also, I’m going to try to cut some of that weaving out.  Some of my passes only got me past a couple of people and it was a lot of extra motion. I need to look forward a bit more to see what I’ll be running into and how I can minimize the extra time. ",6,1729513472.0,Marathon_Training,0,1.0,False

I’m 29 and I’m looking for something real in a world that’s often too caught up in the superficial. I’ve spent the past few years balancing between chasing career goals and searching for meaning in everything else. What I’ve learned? Life’s too short to live on the surface.

I’m the type of person who thrives on deep conversations—whether we’re talking philosophy, what makes us tick, or just what makes the perfect cup of coffee. I love discovering new places, but not in the typical “touristy” way. I want to find the hidden spots—the ones only locals know. I’m just as happy hiking through the wilderness as I am staying in, watching a mind-bending film, or listening to music that makes you feel something.

If you’re someone who enjoys the little things—like late-night drives, spontaneous adventures, and talking about the stuff that matters—then we’ll get along just fine. Let’s connect and see where things go. After all, the best connections often come when you least expect them.

He will dive right into my dog’s food while she’s eating and she’s already almost killed him-not once, but on NUMEROUS occasions. She even bit his ear to the point of drawing blood and this man was unfazed and keeps trying.

It’s got a hill at the beginning but then flat, water views.  I stopped for a nitro at Borealis, right on the path, a coffee roaster in a former small train station.  Then I stopped for lunch in Warren, at Guild Brewing.  Water view, Adirondack chairs.  Excellent flight and sliders.  Warren reminds me of Provincetown.  Old wooden buildings along narrow streets filled with shops, with the water (a different river) in view in between.  there were 3 different places having outdoor musicians.  
I had to turn around and go back, didn’t make it to the end in Bristol.  
I had taken the 10:15 train.  Next time I’ll leave earlier.  Another option, earlier in the season, is to take the providence Newport ferry, which stops in Bristol and no charge for bikes.  I’m definitely doing that next year for the return.  
Downtown providence is stunning.  Gorgeous historical buildings along bricked riverfront.
And the bridges!  The bridges put mass bike ped infrastructure to shame.  
The first, huge bridge, Washington Bridge, has its own bike ped bridge running alongside.  Wide two way bike path, separate pedestrian path.  It’s gorgeous, made to match the automobile bridge.  The other bridges also had separate protected bike paths.  
It’d be a great trip to take advantage of the weather.  Lots of historic information plaques along the way but I didn’t stop for them, too busy enjoying mostly nonstop riding.  There were road crossings but most were so empty that you could just slow down and keep rolling.
Hope you get to go soon!",15,1729513284.0,bikeboston,4,0.94,False

1g8o8gj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AncientCoins/comments/1g8o8gj/need_help_identifying_roman_coins/,Need help identifying Roman coins. ,"Hello Reddit,   
I've been a long-time coin collector and have recently gotten into ancient coins (I'm a massive history nerd for Classical Antiquity) ! 

  
A while back I had purchased some Roman coins (or at least I hope they're legitimate). The first I think I've identified as a coin from Emperor Postumus from the breakaway state of the Gallic Empire (260-269), a fitting coin since I live in a city that belongs to this state. (First image), this coin weighs between 3.2 and 3.3 grams and is about 2.1 cm in diameter. 

https://preview.redd.it/lwtooor9o3wd1.png?width=433&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ebd8ea25ed42b03ce1d161d462c419b15bdee68

The second coin poses more of a problem. I believe it belongs to a Gordian, which one is the problem (there's 3). The coin weights 4.1 grams and has a diameter of roughly 2.2 cm. 

https://preview.redd.it/25yv90dto3wd1.png?width=433&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7106eb52326571d954bffadafff058543e96f01

As to the metal content of these coins, its clearly not bronze or gold (I wish haha). I'm guessing since they seem to date from the 3rd century that they're not pure silver as Rome debased their currency substantially by this point in the Empire. I'm guessing billon? 

  
I really apologize for the poor quality of these images, I own an Android and drank too much coffee this morning.... 

I'm curious as to their denomination, rough dates of minting and if possible the location where they were minted. I doubt they're ""Antoninianus"" since those are heavier...",3,1729512951.0,AncientCoins,6,1.0,False

I have had chronic constipation my whole life. I’ve tried every different way of eating and drinking, gone to a pelvic floor PT, GI, taken laxatives and nothing seemed to work. But recently I was determined to fix it naturally and tried many different things. I’d love to share what worked as it’s really simple. I don’t know if it’ll work for you, but who knows! 

The main thing that helped:
Taking this amazing supplement. One before I go to bed and one first thing when I wake up(both on an empty stomach). 
It’s called Tri-magnesium by Integrative therapeutics. 
I tried many other magnesium supplements over the years and this is the only one that helped with my constipation! 

I also try to drink a cup of organic pure prune juice around 5 days a week. 

Most mornings I get a coffee with espresso(drip coffee does nothing for me) and I put MCT oil in it. But sometimes I just drink the MCT oil with water if I can’t put it in coffee. I use the bulletproof brand. 

If I’m really desperate on rare occasions I’ll drink some salt water first thing in the morning followed by lots of regular water. 

About my diet- I noticed over eating foods like bread and chips really back me up. So I try to stay away! 

With all this, I’m never constipated anymore. I hope any of this was helpful for people, I know how hopeless it can feel. Reddit has helped me so much I thought I’d give something back! ",4,1729512678.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False
