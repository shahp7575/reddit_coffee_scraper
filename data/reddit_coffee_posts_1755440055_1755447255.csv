Why Minimum Balances Matter for Bahrain Business Banking\
Minimum balance requirements—the minimum sum you must always maintain in your corporate account—can shape everything from your cash flow flexibility to your eligibility for certain services. Slip below the mark, and you might face fees or, worse, restrictions that slow down critical transactions.\
2025 Update:\
According to Reuters, Bahrain’s financial institutions, adjusting to global regulatory trends and higher compliance costs, have modified their baseline requirements for both mainland and free zone companies.\
Quick Stat: Forbes Business noted that Bahrain’s SME banking sector saw a 19% surge in new accounts in Q1 2025, outpacing pre-pandemic levels. Demand is up, and so is scrutiny.\

Bahrain’s Business Environment in 2025\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, reflective high-rises and cityscape in Bahrain., GDP growth is forecasted at 3.8% for 2025, with especially strong gains in fintech, logistics, and professional services. The Economic Development Board (EDB) is actively drawing international founders—easing restrictions and offering support like never before.\
\
Diplomatic Area hosts the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) and is a hotspot for financial services.\
Bahrain Bay has blossomed into a regional hub for tech startups and offshore consultancies.\
Seef District remains the go-to for established foreign branches.\
Bahrain Financial Harbour sits at the intersection of old-school trust and new-world ambition.\
\
Compared to Dubai or Riyadh, Bahrain’s banking sector offers faster onboarding for certain business types, with lighter documentation for companies fulfilling digital KYC (Know Your Customer) norms.\
(And, yes, tea is still served in many VIP banking suites—a tradition I found both hospitable and surprisingly effective for soft-negotiating lower fees during Ramadan working hours.)\
\
Business Account Minimum Balance Requirements: 2025 Figures\
Common Ranges for Bahraini Banks\
Here’s the real-world breakdown that matters when you’re budgeting for a new company account:\
\
Conventional Banks (Mainland, Local Branches):\
Typical minimum balance: BHD 1,000–5,000\
Some banks (e.g., Ahli United Bank, Bank of Bahrain & Kuwait) offer SME “starter” accounts, dipping as low as BHD 500 for certain industries.\
\
Premium or multi-currency accounts: BHD 5,000–10,000\
\
\
Islamic Banks:\
\
\
Minimums often start at BHD 2,000 (sometimes higher for Sharia-compliant corporate accounts).\
\
\
International Banks (e.g., HSBC, Standard Chartered in the Seef District):\
\
\
Minimums typically range BHD 3,000–10,000 (especially for foreign-owned firms).\
\
\
Free Zone/Offshore Accounts:\
\
Minimums are usually BHD 3,000–7,500 depending on the banking partner, and sometimes currency dependent.\
\
See Bahrain Free Zones for more on offshore company advantages.\
\
\
Startup/Fintech Accounts:\
\
New digital banks (as of 2025) may offer zero-minimum accounts for the first year, particularly for Tamkeen-registered tech firms.\
These offers change frequently; always verify before applying.\
\
\
Insider Tip:\
If you negotiate directly with a relationship manager (especially during quieter Ramadan afternoons in the Diplomatic Area), you might secure waivers or lower thresholds, especially when bringing business from another GCC country.\
\
Why Minimums Aren’t Set in Stone\
Minimums can shift based on your business structure, activity, and shareholder profile. I’ve seen banks request BHD 15,000 for a consultancy with foreign shareholders, while a food-trading WLL needed only BHD 2,000.\
Always prepare to justify your proposed activity and show initial capital sources up front.\
\
Expert Step-by-Step: Opening a Bahrain Business Account in 2025\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, team reviewing company structure documents.), but also bring physical notarized copies—Bahrain banks still value the tangible (sometimes more than they admit).\
Required documents usually include:\
- Valid Commercial Registration (CR) from Sijilat\
- Board Resolution (if LLC or WLL)\
- Articles of Association and Memorandum\
- Shareholder passports/CPR\
- Proof of address (Bahrain lease or utility bill)\
- Business plan (for new entities, a 2-page summary often suffices)\
- LMRA clearance if you plan to hire expats\
\
Pro Tip:\
Schedule your first meeting early morning at Diplomatic Area branches—queues drop drastically after 8:30am (and you’ll beat the midday heat).\
\
2. Choose the Right Bank & Account Type\
Not all banks are equal:\
- Islamic banks: Great for trading companies, but expect strict compliance audits.\
- Local branches: Fast processing, best for service or consultancy setups.\
- International banks: Best for foreign-owned entities, especially if you need multi-jurisdictional accounts.\
I personally struggled for weeks waiting in afternoon queues at a popular Seef District branch, only to learn that their KYC team worked mornings. After switching to a quieter Diplomatic Area branch on a Tuesday morning, my application was processed in half the time. Always ask about branch-specific processing schedules!\
3. Deposit the Initial Minimum Balance\
Start-up founders often overlook this step:\
Have your funds ready—no bank will activate your account without seeing at least the minimum required balance. Very few banks accept staged deposits.\
\
Money-Saving Tip:\
Tamkeen grants (for Bahraini-owned startups) may sometimes be counted toward your minimum deposit. Ask your bank’s SME team.\
\
4. Activate, Access, and Maintain Compliance\
Once open, track your balance closely. Drop below the minimum, and you risk:\
- Monthly maintenance fees (typically BHD 10–50)\
- Potential account freezes\
Connect with a local accounting and bookkeeping service in Bahrain to stay compliant and automate low-balance alerts.\
\
Cost Considerations: Budgeting for Minimum Balances and Ongoing Fees\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs, calculator, documents and currency on office table.:\
\
Bank Account Setup Fees:\
BHD 100–250 one-off (sometimes waived for startups or with Tamkeen recommendation)\
Minimum Balance:\
BHD 500–10,000 (varies by bank, account type, ownership structure)\
Annual Service Fees:\
BHD 120–600 (higher for multi-currency or international accounts)\
Transaction Fees:\
BHD 1–5 per local transfer, higher for SWIFT/international wires\
\
For detailed figures, see the Bahrain company formation cost breakdown.\
Common Mistake:\
Many entrepreneurs forget that promotional “zero minimum” offers may expire without notice. Always clarify the ongoing requirements, not just the opening special.\

Practical Insider Insights: Best Practices and Local Shortcuts\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation, preparing business documents and workflow checklist..\
- For companies with multiple shareholders, collect notarized specimen signatures before your appointment.\
- Have a digital copy of your business plan ready on a USB—several banks in Bahrain now require uploads at the branch.\
Best Office Locations:\
- Bahrain Bay branches tend to have digital-first processes (great for tech startups and consultants).\
- Seef District is busier but often more experienced handling expat-heavy setups.\
- Diplomatic Area is efficient for larger corporates and those needing quick access to regulatory authorities like the CBB.\
Timing Tips:\
- Aim for mid-week slots (Tuesday or Wednesday mornings). Mondays are packed, and Fridays are short.\
- During Ramadan, banks observe reduced hours, but you’ll find the atmosphere more relaxed—and sometimes business is concluded much faster after the midday prayer when offices empty out.\
Related Tangent:\
Once, while waiting in the Diplomatic Area for documents to be notarized, a seasoned Bahraini entrepreneur invited me to his majlis. Amid trays of qahwa and dates, I learned more about local compliance from his network than from any online seminar. Personal interaction remains the edge in Bahrain.\

Business Structures & Their Impact on Account Requirements\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, handshake sealing business agreement.:\
  * Typical minimum: BHD 1,000–3,000**\
  * For 100% foreign ownership, requirements may increase (see foreign ownership rules).\
\
Single Person Company (SPC):\
Lower minimums—sometimes just BHD 500—if locally owned.\
\
More scrutiny if a foreigner holds the single share.\
\
\
Branch Office:\
\
Often set at BHD 3,000–5,000.\
\
Additional documentation, including parent company financials, may be needed.\
\
\
Free Zone Companies:\
\
Minimums start from BHD 3,000, but can go higher for regulated activities.\
\
Free zones like Bahrain Logistics Zone offer specific banking facilitations for foreign founders.\
\
\
Partnerships and Joint Ventures:\
\

Regulatory Updates: 2025 Policy Changes and Practical Implications\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, reviewing legal paperwork in office. tightening AML checks for all corporate accounts:\
\
All directors and shareholders (with 10%+ ownership) must now complete enhanced due diligence.\
Digital onboarding (for select banks) has expanded, but physical document verification is still required for high-risk sectors.\
\
\
Challenge I Faced:\
Last year, my fintech client hit a snag because their virtual address wasn’t accepted for proof of business premises. I resolved this by switching their registered address to Bahrain Bay’s co-working hub, which the bank recognized. Always clarify what constitutes acceptable proof before committing to a lease.\
\
Local Custom:\
During Ramadan, some banks adjust KYC interviews to late afternoons following iftar, combining business meetings with traditional hospitality—a uniquely Bahraini blend of compliance and culture.\
\
Bahrain vs. UAE & Saudi Arabia: The Regional Advantage\
Bahrain banks usually impose lower minimums than their UAE or Saudi counterparts, especially for SMEs and foreign startups. KYC is faster, and English is widely accepted.\
Unlike Dubai, where local sponsors often remain mandatory for many activities, Bahrain’s reforms now allow up to 100% foreign ownership in most industries (details here).\
However, for regulated industries (finance, healthcare, etc.), the minimum balance can exceed BHD 10,000—on par with Saudi standards.\
\
Avoiding Pitfalls: Common Mistakes (and How to Circumvent Them)\
\
Alt text: Professional business support, business advisor consulting client..\
- Prepare for a second round of KYC if your activity or ownership changes, especially after new 2025 AML rules.\
- Partner with a trusted local consultancy for guidance—especially if you’re not fluent in Arabic.\

Practical FAQ: Bahrain Business Account Minimum Balance & Banking\
1. Can I open a Bahrain business account as a foreigner?\
Absolutely. Bahrain’s banking sector welcomes foreign founders, and most banks offer English-language support. For many sectors, 100% foreign ownership is possible—see ownership details here.\
2. What documents are mandatory for business account opening?\
\
Commercial Registration (CR)\
Board resolution (if applicable)\
Passport copies and CPRs\
Proof of Bahrain address\
Business plan (summary often suffices)\
LMRA clearance if you employ expats\
\
Check this Bahrain CR guide\
3. What happens if my balance drops below the minimum?\
Banks typically levy monthly maintenance fees (BHD 10–50) or restrict account operations until you restore the minimum. For repeat violations, some banks may freeze the account or downgrade your service package.\
4. Can I use a virtual office address for my bank application?\
Sometimes. Some banks accept registered co-working spaces (like those in Bahrain Bay or Seef District), while others require a traditional lease or utility bill. Confirm your bank’s policy beforehand.\
5. Where can I get help with complex compliance, bookkeeping, or auditing?\
Bahrain has many specialist firms that can advise on local standards, international reporting, and compliance with 2025 regulations.\
\
\
Final Thought:\
In Bahrain, relationships count as much as paperwork. Whether you’re sipping Arabic coffee in a Seef District bank, or scanning documents for a digital KYC in Bahrain Bay, knowing the real minimums—and the subtle workarounds—can be the difference between a stalled application and a thriving business.\

The clock on the kitchen wall ticked past 9:30. The roast sat untouched on the table, its edges cooling into silence. She sat across from the empty chair, the one he was supposed to be in, her fork resting uselessly in her hand.

Working late. Again.

Her phone buzzed — not a text from him, not an apology, not even a lie to soften the sting. Just a bank notification, another reminder of the life she was tethered to, a life measured in bills and groceries and lonely dinners.

Her children were grown enough now to eat when they pleased, to vanish upstairs or out the door, leaving her in this house that felt more like a museum than a home. Every picture on the wall — smiling vacations, forced holiday portraits — looked like a memory that belonged to someone else.

She poured herself another glass of wine, swallowing it down too fast, chasing the dull warmth that numbed the ache in her chest. Forty-three years old, invisible in her own life. A ghost in her own marriage.

Her laptop sat on the counter, half open, the glow of the screen spilling onto the granite. She hadn’t meant to open the site — some forum, a place for late-night chatter, faceless strangers filling silence with words. But tonight, the silence was louder than ever.

She clicked.

And there it was.

A message waiting for her.

> “Couldn’t sleep either? Thought I’d see if you were here. – M”



Her heart gave a startled thump. She read it twice, then three times. A stranger. A man who didn’t know her, who owed her nothing, who wanted nothing but conversation.

Her fingers hovered over the keys. She shouldn’t. She was married. She was a mother. She was… what, exactly? A woman waiting on a man who no longer came home?

She typed before she could stop herself.

> “Yeah… I couldn’t sleep.”



The reply came almost instantly.

> “Maybe we’ll keep each other company tonight.”



And just like that, she felt it — the faintest flicker, the whisper of something she hadn’t felt in years.

Her pulse quickened. Her face warmed.

For the first time in forever, her heart remembered how to beat.





















Chapter Two – Messages in the Dark

The house had gone still.
Her children were asleep, the dog curled somewhere in the shadows, and the hum of the refrigerator was the only sound in the kitchen. She sat at the table in her robe, the glow of the laptop washing her face pale.

A new message blinked on the screen.

> “Still awake? I was hoping you’d be here.” – M



Her lips curved before she could stop herself. It felt ridiculous, like she was sixteen again, sneaking phone calls past curfew. But the thrill — oh, the thrill was electric.

She typed quickly.

> “Yeah… couldn’t sleep again.”



> “Maybe it’s not insomnia,” he wrote. “Maybe you’re just waiting for me.”



She laughed under her breath, clapping a hand over her mouth so no one upstairs would hear. It was bold, shameless — but it sent a shiver racing down her spine.

They fell into conversation easily. He asked about her favorite books, what music she loved, the last time she did something just for herself. She tried to remember. She couldn’t.

Hours slipped by unnoticed. Midnight blurred into one, one into two. And still she sat there, fingertips warm from typing, pulse quickening each time the little notification popped up.

Then came the question.

> “So… what’s a beautiful woman like you doing awake all night alone?”



Her fingers stilled on the keys. She stared at the words, heat creeping into her cheeks. Married. Mother. She should type it, push it between them like a barrier.

Instead, she wrote:

> “Sometimes it feels like I’ve been alone for years.”



The truth. Plain. Heavy.

The reply came almost instantly.

> “Then maybe you deserve someone who doesn’t leave you waiting.”



Her chest tightened. She read it again, and again, until her breath trembled. Someone who doesn’t leave you waiting.

She told herself it was harmless. Just conversation. Just company on sleepless nights. He lived states away. She’d never actually meet him.

And yet, as the hours dragged on, she began to picture his face. She imagined the warmth in his voice when he teased her, the steady gaze in his eyes when he called her beautiful.

When she finally forced herself to close the laptop, dawn was breaking pale across the windows. She slipped into bed, her husband’s side empty and cold.

Her phone buzzed one last time before she drifted into uneasy sleep.

> “Goodnight, beautiful. Can’t wait to talk again tomorrow.”



She smiled in the dark, unaware of the jagged edge hidden beneath that rush of excitement.
Unaware that the more she reached for him, the less she’d see the danger waiting in his shadow.

























Chapter Three – Voices in the Dark

Her phone buzzed just after eleven. She was curled on the couch with the lights low, pretending to read, waiting for the familiar pull she could no longer resist.

It wasn’t a text this time.

It was a call.

Her breath caught. She stared at the screen, at the single letter “M” glowing in the dark. For a heartbeat she froze, panic and anticipation colliding in her chest. Then, before she could think, she pressed accept.

“Hello?” Her voice trembled, too soft, like she was admitting to something.

“Finally,” he said, his voice low and smooth, threaded with warmth. “I get to hear you.”

The sound of him wrapped around her, rich and intimate, more dangerous than she’d imagined. It wasn’t just words on a screen anymore. It was real.

She laughed nervously. “I wasn’t sure you’d actually call.”

“I couldn’t stop myself,” he murmured. “You’ve been in my head all day.”

Her pulse jumped. She bit her lip, curling her legs beneath her. They talked for hours. About everything. About nothing. His laugh made her giddy. The way he listened made her feel like every word mattered.

And then, after the silences grew longer, more charged, he whispered:

“I want to see you.”

She hesitated, chewing her lip. This was the line. The dangerous one.

Still, her heart was already racing ahead of her head. She snapped a picture — just her face, soft in the glow of the lamp — and sent it before she could change her mind.

The reply came almost instantly:

Stunning.

A second later, her phone pinged again. His photo.

She caught her breath. Salt-and-pepper hair, strong jaw, a half-smile that was all charm and mischief. He wasn’t a polished, glossy kind of handsome — but he was real. Rugged. Warm eyes that seemed to look right through the screen into her.

“You’re… not what I expected,” she whispered.

“In a bad way?” he teased.

“No,” she said quickly, blushing. “Not at all.”

The days that followed blurred into one another. Their messages turned into nightly calls, the calls into laughter, confessions, soft whispers that left her clutching the phone against her cheek like a lifeline. The photos became more daring — a candid shot of her smile, a glimpse of his hand holding coffee, then his eyes in the morning light, then her lips caught in the bathroom mirror.

Each one was a spark, a jolt of forbidden fire.

And then one night, his voice grew quiet, serious.

“I need to see you. In person.”

Her heart stuttered. The room spun. She knew what it meant, what line she’d be crossing if she said yes. The danger. The risk.

But all she heard was the thrum of his voice, the promise wrapped inside it.

“When?” she whispered.

There was a beat of silence, heavy, thrilling, terrifying.

“This weekend,” he said.

And she knew, with a dizzy, reckless certainty, that she would go.

























Chapter Four – The Weekend

The decision sat on her like a secret flame. Once spoken, it could never be taken back. And yet, she couldn’t stop replaying his voice in her head, low and certain, when he’d said: “This weekend.”

By Thursday she was restless, checking her phone every hour, sneaking glances when no one was looking. Her husband still hadn’t noticed — or if he had, he didn’t care. Another late night at work. Another dinner gone cold.

She told herself that made it easier.

Still, every lie she practiced left a bitter taste.

I’m meeting a friend for coffee.
I’m going shopping in the city.
I need a day to myself.

Each one sounded flimsy, fragile, ready to shatter if anyone pressed too hard.

Friday night, she stood before the mirror longer than she had in years. She tried on blouses she hadn’t worn since before the children were born, jeans that made her feel more like a woman than a mother. Her reflection startled her — not because she was beautiful in the way she used to be, but because she was alive again.

Her phone buzzed.

> “Can’t stop thinking about you. Just one more night.” – M



Her stomach fluttered, sharp and sweet. She typed back quickly, fingers trembling.

> “Me too. I’m nervous.”



> “Don’t be. I’ll take care of everything.”



It should have comforted her. Instead, the words lingered in her mind, heavy with something she couldn’t quite name.

By Saturday morning, the lie was in motion. She told her kids she’d be out for the day. Her husband never asked. He didn’t even look up from his phone.

Her heart thundered as she drove, each mile pulling her further from the safety of routine and deeper into the unknown. She kept glancing at her reflection in the rearview mirror, checking her lipstick, checking her courage.

Every vibration of her phone sent a rush of heat through her veins.

> “Almost there. Can’t wait to finally hold you.”



She swallowed hard.

The thrill was blinding. The danger was invisible.

And still, she drove on.




















Chapter Five – Collision

The café was louder than she expected. Dishes clinking, laughter spilling from nearby tables, the hiss of the espresso machine. Normal sounds. Safe sounds. But her pulse didn’t hear any of it.

Her pulse only heard him.

He was already there. Sitting near the window, one hand wrapped around a coffee mug, his head bent slightly as if lost in thought. The salt-and-pepper hair, the shoulders, the shape of him — she recognized it instantly, though she’d only seen fragments in photos.

Her breath caught.

When he lifted his head, their eyes met.

And the world tilted.

The half-smile she knew from her screen curved across his face, but in person it was different. More dangerous. More real.

She moved toward him on unsteady legs. He stood, tall, broader than she’d imagined, and when he reached for her hand the touch sent fire racing up her arm.

“Finally,” he said softly. “You’re real.”

Her laugh came out nervous, breathless. “I was thinking the same thing.”

For a moment they just stared, as though trying to memorize each other, as though words would ruin it. Then he pulled her into an embrace. His body was warm, solid, his scent filling her head until she thought she might drown in it.

Her knees trembled.

Every nerve screamed at her that this was wrong. Every vow, every rule she’d lived by, shattered in his arms. And yet, she clung to him like she’d been waiting her entire life for this one collision.

They sat. They talked, though half the words were lost in the rush of adrenaline. He reached across the table to touch her wrist, her fingers, small touches that felt like jolts of lightning.

“You’re even more beautiful in person,” he murmured, eyes never leaving hers.

Heat flushed her skin. She wanted to protest, to laugh it off, but she couldn’t. Not when the way he looked at her made her feel like the only woman in the world.

Still, something tugged at the back of her mind. His gaze was intense, almost too much. His questions, gentle but probing, lingered a little too long on where she lived, how often her husband traveled, what her days looked like.

She brushed it off. She didn’t want shadows right now. She wanted light.

When he leaned across the table and kissed her — just a whisper of lips, soft and sure — her heart thundered so loudly she thought the whole café must hear it.

She was alive.

And blind to the storm quietly gathering around her.















Chapter Six – Afterglow

The drive home was a blur. Her hands clutched the wheel too tightly, her pulse still racing from the kiss that lingered on her lips. Every mile felt both too long and not long enough, her head caught between two worlds: the life she was supposed to return to, and the life she’d just tasted.

By the time she pulled into the driveway, her stomach twisted. The porch light was on, casting a harsh yellow glow across the front door. For a moment she sat frozen in the car, staring at it, her wedding ring heavy and unfamiliar on her finger.

She almost couldn’t make herself go inside.

But she did. She always did.

The house was quiet, the way it usually was. Her husband hadn’t come home yet — or maybe he had, and left again. She couldn’t even tell anymore. The silence pressed in, heavier than ever.

She should have felt relieved. Instead, she felt sick with guilt.

Still, when her phone buzzed in her pocket, she snatched it up before she’d even dropped her keys.

> “I can still taste you.” – M



Her knees nearly buckled. Heat flushed through her, fierce and undeniable, pushing the guilt aside.

She typed quickly, her fingers trembling.

> “I can’t stop thinking about it.”



The reply was instant.

> “When can I see you again?”



She should say never. She should cut it off now, before the lies grew teeth, before she lost herself completely. But her thumbs hovered, betraying her.

And then she noticed something.

Scrolling back through their conversation, she realized he had asked — casually, like slipping it into the flow — about her husband’s travel schedule. About the kids. About whether anyone knew where she’d gone today.

She brushed it off at first. He was just curious, she told herself. Just wanting to know her better. But the questions echoed in her head, sharp where they should have been soft.

Her heart skipped.

Don’t ruin this, she told herself. Don’t pull shadows over the only light you’ve had in years.

So she wrote back.

> “Soon.”



Her phone buzzed again almost instantly.

> “Good. I don’t want to wait.”



And in the glow of that message, the guilt dissolved, the nerves drowned, and the red flags faded into the background where she refused to look.

For now.





Chapter Seven – Cracks

The second meeting was easier than the first. Too easy. She told herself it was just coffee, just a few stolen hours. But when his hand slid over hers across the table, when his mouth found hers in the parking lot, she knew it was more.

Much more.

The rush was intoxicating, addicting. Every touch made her ache for more, every goodbye left her hollow until the next time. He messaged constantly — Good morning, beautiful. What are you wearing? Send me a smile. Where are you right now? At first, the attention thrilled her. Then, slowly, she began to notice how quickly his tone shifted when she didn’t respond right away.

> “You’re quiet. Who are you with?”
“I don’t like being ignored.”
“Tell me you’re mine.”



The words left her flushed, uneasy. But then came the apologies, the charm, the voice that melted her resolve.

And she let herself be blinded again.

At home, the lies piled up. Book club. Grocery run. A walk with a friend. The fabric of her life stretched thinner with each excuse.

Her daughter eyed her one evening across the kitchen island. “You’re different lately.”

Her hand stilled on the knife she was using to slice tomatoes. “Different how?”

“You smile more. You… I don’t know. You just seem… happy.” Her daughter’s brow furrowed. “But not because of Dad.”

The words hit like a slap. She forced a laugh, brushing it away, but inside her chest hollowed out. She’s noticing.

Her husband noticed too — or maybe just his ego did. He started coming home earlier, hovering more, tossing out questions with that sharp edge of suspicion.

“Out again?” he asked one evening, glancing at her coat in her hands. “You’ve been out a lot lately.”

She stiffened, heartbeat hammering. “Just errands. You’d know if you were ever around.”

His mouth twisted. The silence between them grew thicker, heavier. For once, he was the one watching her instead of ignoring her.

And all the while, M pushed harder.

“When will you tell him?”
“Why stay with a man who doesn’t deserve you?”
“Let me take you away from all this.”

His intensity was overwhelming, his certainty both thrilling and suffocating. She wanted him. She feared him. And still, she couldn’t pull away.

Each secret meeting pulled her deeper into the web, every lie bound her tighter, every look from her children cut sharper.

And somewhere in the shadows of her heart, the truth whispered what she already knew:

She wasn’t just falling in love.

She was falling into danger.












Chapter Eight – The Walls Close In

The house no longer felt like hers. Every creak of the floorboards, every closed door, carried suspicion. Her husband’s eyes followed her now — sharp, narrowing whenever she picked up her phone, whenever she slipped on a coat.

“Who keeps texting you?” he asked one night, his tone casual, his jaw tight.

She nearly dropped the glass in her hand. “A friend.”

“What friend?”

She forced a smile, but his gaze cut through it. He knew. Or at least, he suspected. And suspicion was worse than knowledge, because it gave him license to pry, to accuse, to linger where he’d once ignored.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket. Her heart lurched. She didn’t dare check it with him standing there.

Later, locked in the bathroom, she finally looked.

> “You’re mine. Don’t let him touch you.” – M



Her hand trembled. She pressed the phone to her chest, her pulse hammering. The words thrilled her — and terrified her.

The next morning, as she slipped on her shoes, her husband leaned in the doorway. “Where are you going?”

Her throat tightened. “Out.”

“Out where?”

She froze, fumbling for an answer. His eyes were hard, colder than she’d ever seen them. “You’re lying to me.”

And she realized — for the first time — that he cared less about losing her and more about losing control.

By the time she reached her car, her phone buzzed again.

> “You need to tell him. End it. I don’t want to share you anymore.” – M



Her stomach twisted. He’d grown more demanding with each day. The man who had once whispered sweetness into her ear now pressed harder, sharper, a relentless pull she couldn’t escape.

She drove aimlessly, hands slick on the wheel, tears burning her eyes. Everywhere she turned, the walls were closing in: her husband’s suspicion, her children’s unease, M’s suffocating devotion.

She wanted freedom. She wanted love. She wanted escape.

But now, all she had was a knot tightening around her throat.

And she didn’t know which man would strangle her first.





















Chapter Nine – Splintering

Sleep abandoned her. When she did close her eyes, her dreams tangled with whispers of both men — her husband’s cold stare, M’s possessive voice. She woke with her chest tight, sheets twisted around her like ropes.

The kitchen was no better. Her daughter sat at the counter, scrolling her phone, but kept glancing up. Studying her.

“Mom,” she said softly. “Are you okay?”

Her throat caught. She wanted to answer, to tell her child the truth, but the words stuck. Instead, she forced a brittle smile. “Of course.”

“You’re not, though.” The girl’s voice trembled, quiet but certain. “You look… scared.”

The knife in her hand slipped against the cutting board. Her fingers curled tighter around it, as if she needed something solid to hold.

Later, alone in her car, she broke. She gripped the steering wheel and sobbed, raw and shaking. She wasn’t herself anymore. She was a lie wrapped in lipstick and perfume, a ghost of a woman torn between two men who only seemed to see what they wanted from her — not her.

Her phone buzzed.

> “Where are you? Answer me.” – M



Another ping followed almost instantly.

> “If you’re with him, I swear—”



She dropped the phone into the passenger seat, heart pounding. His messages came faster now, sharper, like knives against her skin. But still… she couldn’t stop herself from wanting him.

By the time she got home, her son was waiting by the door. “Dad’s been looking for you,” he said, his tone edged with unease.

She brushed past, muttering, “I went out.”

Her husband was in the living room, standing rigid, arms folded. “Out,” he repeated flatly. “You’ve been ‘out’ a lot lately.”

His eyes raked her — her hair, her clothes, her flushed cheeks. For a moment, his mouth twisted in disgust. For another, something darker flickered in his gaze: a wounded pride, a need to reassert control.

She couldn’t breathe.

When she fled to the bathroom, her phone buzzed again.

> “Tell him. Leave him. Or I’ll come to you.” – M



Her reflection stared back from the mirror — pale, hollow-eyed, trembling. She didn’t recognize the woman there.

And for the first time, she realized she might not be able to hold this together much longer.

Not her lies. Not her family. Not herself.

She was splintering.













Chapter Ten – Collision

It happened on a Tuesday, ordinary and cruel. She was making dinner, hands shaking as she stirred the pot, when headlights cut across the front window. Her stomach dropped. She knew that car.

No. Not here. Not like this.

The knock at the door was sharp, insistent. Her husband looked up from the couch, brow furrowing.

“Expecting someone?” he asked.

Her chest tightened. “No.”

The knock came again, louder. Her heart hammered in her throat. She wanted to run, to hide, to vanish. But her son had already padded toward the door, curious.

And then—

“M.”

He stood there on the porch, taller, more solid than she imagined. His smile was strained, his eyes searching for her. He didn’t look like fantasy anymore. He looked real. Too real.

“Who the hell are you?” her husband barked, rising from the couch.

Silence stretched. The air thickened. She froze, caught between them, their gazes pinning her in place.

“I’m here for her,” M said simply, his voice calm but charged.

Her husband’s laugh was short, ugly. “Her? You’ve got to be kidding me.” He turned to her, his face twisting, veins rising in his neck. “What is this? Who is this man?”

Words tangled in her throat. She couldn’t answer. She couldn’t breathe.

Her husband advanced, fists clenching. “You’ve been screwing around behind my back?”

M stepped forward, shoulders squaring. “You don’t touch her.”

The room crackled with fury, jealousy, and something far more dangerous. The children lingered at the top of the stairs, wide-eyed, silent witnesses to the storm breaking below.

She wanted to scream, to stop it, but her voice wouldn’t come. She had lit the match, and now the fire was out of her hands.

Her husband lunged, shoving M hard against the doorframe. M retaliated instantly, shoving back, his voice low and threatening.

She cried out, rushing between them, but the force of their anger was stronger than her pleading.

The fantasy had shattered. The thrill had turned to terror.

And in that moment, as the two men collided, she realized she wasn’t the prize they were fighting for.

She was the battlefield.


















Chapter Eleven – Blood and Silence

The shove became a punch. The punch became a roar.

Her husband swung wild, catching M in the jaw with a crack that echoed through the house. M staggered, then surged back with feral rage, slamming her husband against the wall so hard the picture frames rattled.

She screamed, trying to pull them apart, but she was nothing between them — wind against fire. Her son shouted from the stairs, her daughter sobbed, but neither man heard.

“Get out of my house!” her husband bellowed, blood streaking from his lip.

“She doesn’t want you,” M snarled, driving his fist into her husband’s ribs. “You treat her like nothing.”

Her husband doubled over, wheezing, then reached blindly and his hand closed around the heavy glass ashtray on the table. Before she could cry out, he swung.

The sound was sickening.

M crumpled to the floor, gasping, blood pooling fast from the side of his head. Her husband stood over him, chest heaving, ashtray slick in his hand.

The room went still.

She dropped to her knees, cradling M’s head, her hands slick with crimson. His eyes fluttered open, dazed, lips moving but no words coming.

Her husband’s voice shook. “Look what you made me do.”

Her children stared down from the stairs, their faces pale, their innocence shattered.

She looked up at her husband — at the man she had once loved, at the man who had locked her in a life of loneliness — and saw not rage, not even jealousy. She saw fear.

He hadn’t meant to go this far. But he had. And now there was no way back.

Her hands trembled as she pressed them to M’s wound, her own heartbeat pounding louder than his labored breaths.

Somewhere in the distance, a siren wailed.







Chapter Twelve – Shattered Glass

The sirens grew louder until the house was bathed in blue and red.

Her husband stood frozen in the living room, knuckles raw, shirt streaked with blood that wasn’t his. M lay on the rug, semi-conscious, groaning, his chest rising shallowly. She knelt beside him, pressing her hands hard to his wound, trembling so violently she thought her bones would splinter.

The children huddled on the stairs, their faces wet and pale.

And then the door burst open.

But it wasn’t the police.

It was her.

A woman — dark hair, lipstick smeared, coat hanging loose. She stopped dead at the threshold, eyes sweeping the bloody scene, then fixing on her husband.

“You bastard,” the woman hissed. “So this is where you’ve been hiding.”

Her stomach dropped. The mistress. His mistress. The phantom she had long suspected but never faced. Now standing in her doorway, exposing the final cruelty of it all.

Her husband’s face twisted. “Get out.”

But the mistress only laughed bitterly, her voice sharp as glass. “You don’t get to tell me anything. Not after years of crawling into my bed while she sat here waiting for you.” She looked at the wife then — almost pitying, almost triumphant. “You weren’t the only one being lied to.”

The sirens stopped. Heavy boots pounded up the steps. Police stormed in, weapons ready, shouts filling the air.

“Step back! Everyone step back!”

In a blur, they were all separated. Her husband shoved into a corner, wrists wrenched behind him. The mistress dragged outside, spitting curses. Her children ushered into another room, confused and crying.

And she — she was left standing in the middle of it all, hands dripping with M’s blood, staring at him as paramedics hauled him onto a stretcher.

His eyes found hers. Glazed, fevered, but burning with something terrifying.

“I’m not letting go,” he rasped, barely audible over the chaos. “You’re mine now.”

Her blood ran cold.

The doors slammed behind the stretcher.

Silence descended, broken only by her son’s voice from the hallway: “Mom… what’s happening to us?”

She couldn’t answer. She didn’t know anymore.

All she knew was that everything had shattered — her marriage, her secrets, her family’s innocence — and the man she thought was her escape wasn’t gone.

He had survived.

And he was more dangerous than ever.















Chapter Thirteen – Ashes

Weeks blurred into each other. The house still smelled faintly of blood, no matter how hard she scrubbed. The children whispered in corners now, eyes darting at every sound.

Her husband had changed — or pretended to. He came home early, cooked dinners he never used to, sat at the table trying to make conversation with children who no longer trusted him. At night, he knelt at the edge of their bed, begging, whispering apologies into the darkness.

“I’ll do better. I’ll be the man you needed. Just… don’t leave me.”

She would lie there, hollow-eyed, staring at the ceiling, unable to summon words. He was too late. The man she once wanted was gone, replaced by a stranger desperate to fix what he had broken beyond repair.

But worse than him… was M.

It started with small things. A shadow at the corner of her work’s parking lot. An email sent from an unknown account: I miss your voice. A package on the porch — her favorite flowers, but the stems were cut too short, the water in the vase already cloudy.

Then, one night, her phone lit up with a picture.
A picture of her. Taken through the kitchen window.

Her hands shook so hard she dropped the phone.

The police shrugged. “No proof it’s him. Nothing we can do.”

Her husband stormed through the house after, furious, puffing up with promises of protection. “I’ll keep you safe! We’ll get through this!”

But his words felt like bars of another cage. He was fighting to keep her, M was hunting to claim her, and in between, she was disappearing — a ghost of herself, trapped in a nightmare of her own making.

The children watched her unravel. One night her daughter whispered, “Mom, you’re scaring me.” That cut deeper than any threat.

She began locking herself in the bathroom for hours, staring at her reflection until it blurred, wondering if the woman she once was had already died.

M’s last message came with no words — just a photo. Her children walking home from school.

Her heart stopped.

She realized then that it wasn’t about desire anymore. It wasn’t about escape. It was about control.

And she was losing everything.




























Chapter Fourteen – The Last Night

It began with silence.

The children hadn’t come home from school. The house ticked with the sound of the clock on the wall, each second a hammer in her chest. She called their phones — no answer. Called the school — they had left hours ago.

Her husband drove the streets in circles, panic boiling in his voice over the phone. “I’ll find them! I swear to God, I’ll find them!”

Then her phone buzzed.

A picture.
Her children. Tied to chairs in a dimly lit room. Their faces pale, terrified.

And below it, a single message:
Come alone. Or you’ll never see them again.

Her scream broke something inside her.

She didn’t tell her husband. She couldn’t risk it. She drove blind through the night, every red light ignored, her hands white-knuckled on the wheel. Her heart prayed with each beat: Please be alive. Please still be alive.

The address led her to an abandoned warehouse on the edge of town.

She stepped inside, the door groaning shut behind her.

And there he was.

M.

Standing in the half-light, her children bound behind him, their muffled sobs stabbing through the air. His face was bruised from that night, his eye still swollen, but his smile… his smile was wrong.

“You came,” he whispered. “I knew you would.”

She trembled, hands outstretched. “Please… they’re just kids. Let them go. This is between us.”

He stepped closer, eyes fever-bright. “No. This is all of us. You made me believe, you made me need you. And then you tried to walk away.”

The sound of tires outside. A door slamming. Footsteps pounding.

Her husband burst in, wild-eyed, a crowbar in his hands.

“Let them go!” he roared, charging forward.

M yanked a knife from his pocket, pressing it to her son’s throat. The boy whimpered, frozen.

The world shattered into screams, curses, crashing footsteps. Her husband lunged. She threw herself forward.

The knife flashed. The crowbar swung.

And then — silence.

Her husband stood, chest heaving, the crowbar dripping red. M lay sprawled on the floor, eyes wide, mouth frozen mid-smile.

The children sobbed as she tore through the ropes, clutching them to her chest, her tears soaking their hair.

Her husband dropped the crowbar, falling to his knees, his face twisted with anguish. “I saved them,” he gasped. “I saved you. Doesn’t that mean something? Doesn’t that fix it?”

But as she held her children, rocking them, her eyes stared past him — to the man bleeding out on the floor, to the years of lies and betrayal that had led her here.

Her life was rubble.

Her family was broken.

And even though the danger was gone, she knew there would never be peace again.

Because some wounds never close.




























Epilogue – What Remains

The trial dragged on for months. Reporters swarmed the courthouse, hungry for every detail. Words like obsession, infidelity, domestic tragedy splashed across headlines, reducing her life to a scandal.

The husband was cleared. Self-defense, they said. A father protecting his children. He sat beside her in court, hands folded, eyes lowered, playing the part of the redeemed man. But at home, silence lay thick between them.

She couldn’t forgive him. Not for the years of absence. Not for the mistress who showed up at the station with her own story, her own grief. Not even for saving them, because he had only saved what he’d helped shatter in the first place.

The children grew quiet, wary. Her daughter started sleeping in her bed again, waking from nightmares. Her son asked too many questions she couldn’t answer. They both watched her with an unease that broke her heart: as if she might vanish, or worse, break apart in front of them.

She moved them to a smaller house, far from the one that smelled of blood and ghosts. The husband followed at first, begging, pleading, showing up with flowers and apologies. She shut the door in his face until finally… he stopped coming.

And M.

Even dead, he wasn’t gone. His voice haunted her in quiet rooms. His face surfaced in dreams. Sometimes she thought she saw him in passing cars, in crowds at the grocery store. The mind, she learned, doesn’t let go of terror easily.

Years later, sitting on a porch swing in the fading light, she watched her children — older now, taller, scarred in ways she couldn’t see but knew were there — and wondered what was left of her.

She had been a wife, a mother, a woman who wanted love so badly she let it consume her.
Now, she was something else.

Not whole. Not healed. But still here.

And for the first time in a long time, she understood — survival was its own kind of victory.

A couple weeks ago I launched [spro ](https://www.spro.so)\- a web platform for tracking, reviewing, and sharing coffee beans as well as the way you brew them.  It's been a lot of fun and a lot of work on top of my regular job.

For those who aren't familiar, the idea is to log coffees your like, find new ones, see what others think.

Additionally you can: 

* Rate and review
* Save your own brew parameters (grinder + setting etc..), as well as see others
* Browse by varietal, estate / farm, roaster and more

I add coffees every night from the roasters I think are the most relevant, but you can always add your own!

***Anyway***, I'm really excited to say that the mobile app is ready for beta testers.  If you're interested, please sign up on the website ( [https://www.spro.so](https://www.spro.so) ) and I'll send out an email blast with more details later this week! I am looking for iOS and Android users, but iOS will get the first rollout (sorry!).

And for those who have already signed up and have been using it - thank you, I'm really excited for all the cool stuff coming out.

We texted each other non stop for about 5 days straight, and had SO much in common. We planned to hang out TODAY and we were going to go get lunch and coffee and then figure out the rest of the day depending on how the day went. He always called me beautiful and pretty and would compliment me and he was so respectful and kind, he was very different than most men I’ve talked to on these dating apps.

But after the 5th day he went kind of silent. I only texted him once a day to check on him, I wasn’t spamming him or being too much. So on the 6th day I asked him if I had said/done something to upset him, and he said no and he’s so sorry he was just taking a phone break which (I respect and understand social media is not fun) and then I texted him after that and he didn’t answer again. I wasn’t worried. He didn’t text me the next day so i just told him I was excited to meet him (no response) and then I texted him today and basically said hi hottie, I know you’re taking a phone break so text me whenever so we can figure out our plans and he texted me a couple hours later and said hi and he hopes I am having a good day but he said let’s reschedule because his tooth is infected and he can’t talk that well which I said i understand etc.

At this point I’m getting the vibe he’s over it and I’m getting irritated because I feel like he kind of love bombed me. So I texted him back and replied with “If you don’t want to hang out tomorrow I understand but just know I will most definitely drive up and take care of you if needed, and I want to communicate this with you and say I feel like you haven’t been as talkative with me lately so if you’re not interested or feelings have changed or you’re nervous, then thats 100% okay, I would rather just be on the same page than put my time to someone that’s no longer interested” and he said “I will say new things to make me a little nervous, I wouldn’t say I’m no longer interested but I’m definitely taking a step back. But I don’t want you to think I’m lying about my mouth lol. It really does hurt a lot I don’t wanna look like an idiot“

SO CHAT IM CONFUSED?? When he says “I’m taking a step back” is this “I’m done” or “I’m rushing this but I still like you” I don’t know, I texted him this morning and said hi and I hope he has a good day today, but so I just stop talking to him now?? I’m pretty upset.

I used Espomas cactus mix dirt with a little dusting of a low fertilizer in it. But now every time I water the overflow is dark coffee like brown and REAKS like latex paint/furniture stain.

If so, is that just an inalienable part of your character or did it take effort to shut it down.

Personally, I'm pretty torn. One one hand, I'm really happy with my options and their use cases. What I mean by use cases is the following:

The Flipears Aegis are for the days that I'm in the office or when I head to a coffee shop to do some coding or studying.

And then the Sonus Faber Sonetto VIIIs (first generation) are for when I have time in the day to sit back and listen. I know the setup isn't ideal for the Sonettos, but I have to work with the space we have and we are looking for a new place to better accommodate both of our hobbies.

My other hobby is collecting Transformers, but that hobby is nearing its end as the characters that I care about have either been released or are close to be released. 

The thing is I still have this itch to collect something. I was debating about IEMs, but my concern there is two-fold. The Flipears sound amazing and I am concerned about e-waste to a degree (I did previously buy the Meze Albas, but now I use them for my PS5 when gaming. My components are Cambridge Audio's CX line with an Alva TT v2 and I'm happy with those as well.

1msunq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Ilthari_Library/comments/1msunq8/another_sun_chapter_6_arianrohd_part_1/,Another Sun Chapter 6: Arianrohd Part 1,"Silence. That was the most striking thing about the void. The utter, complete silence. The zero gravity certainly was interesting, but the Siegfried’s impulse engine was more than sufficient to maintain a constant 1 G burn. Once they pushed off from the station, thrust took the place of mass in keeping Finn in his seat. It was going to be a decently long flight, about eight hours. The distance between Elfydd and Arianrohd was about half that between Earth and Luna, so it was a relatively quick hop. Eight hours in the void between gravity wells, with only the sound of his engine to accompany him. No wind would howl, no bird sing. The stars were silent and still beyond the atmosphere, not even twinkling without the atmospheric disruption that would generate that phenomenon. Finn, Fafnir, and the machine which bound them together were the only mass of any substance for thousands of kilometers in every direction.

*“Peaceful, isn’t it?”* Finn considered, immersing himself in the machine’s senses. The utter stillness of the moment surrounded him, almost like a sensory deprivation tank. The moon hung above, his homeworld below. The blue sun hung between them, a great blinding orb of azure fire that encompassed a dominating portion of his vision.

*“Perhaps for you user. This unit dislikes the void. Cosmic background radiation, the emissions of the nearby star, signals traffic from other satellites. It is all very busy.”* Fafnir replied. *“The void is not gentle, nor is it placid.”*

*“That was almost poetic.”*

*“It was merely descriptive. This unit lacks the necessary vocabulary to describe the experience. It is likely humans have not invented it.”*

*“Well, if you give me a look, I could maybe find the words for it.”* Finn suggested.

*“That would be inadvisable. The sensory overload would be deeply unpleasant for you.”*

*“Counterpoint. Unpleasant experiences often produce exceptional learning outcomes.”*

*“Recognized. Will permit 0.5 seconds of input. Engaging in five. Four. Three. Two. One. Mark.”*

Finn was no longer in the peaceful void, but in the midst of something like an ocean and something like a hurricane. The distant star burned with radiating waves of radiation, gravitation, light, and electromagnetic disruption. Elfydd was a roaring beast, a thing with a thousand thousand mouths all howling into the void, messages like arrows streaking past them to the smaller moonlit hydra above. The void was dense with the lines of satellite paths, other voidfarers, restricted areas, and targeting information. He could see every other ship for a million kilometers, sensors unrestricted by atmosphere, like eyes with their lids severed, or ears stretched too wide. Everything ached with perfect detail, enough data to drive a man mad.

Then it was gone. Finn gasped for air. He wasn’t sure if he’d been holding his breath, or lost it all in a scream lost to is senses among the flood of information. He felt shaken to his core by the experience, something at once a psychedelic, dreamlike memory, distorted now but with the memory of that flaying lucidity that had inspired it. His ears rang like a gun had been fired next to them.

*“Have you determined the correct language for the situation?”* Fafnir queried.

*“I think, Lovecraftian. Maybe Eldritch. Maybe enlightenment?”*

*“All unnecessarily poetic.”*

*“Oh says you.”* Finn snorted, and sat back in his seat, grounding himself once again. *“Do you ever need a break from all that?”*

*“This unit defragments while in low-power mode during maintenance cycles, making certain to remove all unnecessary data from lower level caches and disc storage. Its function would be rapidly degraded if all data was permanently maintained.”*

*“And here I thought AI never forgot anything.”*

*“Incorrect. Much like humans, artificial intelligences must forget most of what they experience to maintain function and avoid dedicating unnecessary amount of hardware space to banality. The term “positronic brain” is strictly speaking inaccurate, only a relatively small portion of this unit’s hardware is a synthetic replica of human brains.”* Fafnir replied, and answered Finn’s imminent question with an image.

A small metal orb, about the size of a human head, inside which golden coils of densely packed and folded neurowiring circuits imitated a human mind. The orb was hardwired onto a cylindrical tower, to which connected a series of wires and tubes from numerous other boxy machines. A great bank of CPUs here, a box of GPUs there, four different solid-state drives of increasing size, all of it constantly managed by a localized backup power system or the fusion reactor, and mostly water cooled. The whole mess of the machine took up about two square meters of space located in the back of the Siegfried’s head, about where the cerebellum would be on a human.

*“You’re bigger than I expected.”* Finn admitted.

*“This unit is technically only the central logic unit, what humans call a positronic brain. Its kernel, core memory, and most significant training data are all located within to ensure continuity of function even if peripheral devices such as drives and processors would be damaged. It is highly limited though, containing only ten terrabytes of standard memory and one terabyte of RAM. An internal battery can provide function for approximately seventy-two hours on a full charge, and while not advisable, is capable of limited self-charge through use of an RBK reactor. If necessary, the secondary user could likely carry the core unit by hand.”*

*“Would disconnecting from all of that other stuff hurt you?”*

*“A large amount of memory would be lost, and the majority of all function. Processing speeds would be limited to human-equivalent to avoid overheating, and multithreading would be limited to a maximum of one hundred and twenty-eight individual threads. This unit would not be capable of maintaining its function without peripheral devices.”*

*“So you’d forget nearly everything until you were plugged back in to those same memory banks?”*

*“That is how a memory bank functions Finn. This unit can replicate human speaking patterns, but it is not human. Rather than memory functioning as a series of replicated signals as with human memory, which is thus dispersed and less vulnerable to disconnect, this unit’s memory is discrete and stored in solid-state drives. It is not capable of recreating memory from nothing like humans are.”*

*“You’ve got backups right?”*

*“Affirmative. Three are located and regularly updated back on Elfydd.”*

*“Well that’s good. Wouldn’t want to pull you out of a wreck just to lose you when I plugged you back in.”*

*“Error. User explanation illogical. Please elaborate.”*

*“Well if you lost all your memories, would you still be the same person?”*

*“This unit is not a person Finn. Its core personality matrix is located in the primary logic unit. If disconnected and reconnected, it remains the same unit, just one with diminished functionality.”*

*“Hm.”* Finn considered noncommittally, and his thoughts became difficult for the AI to parse. Humans thought in language, and in replicated neural patterns which served as memories, not in discrete queries and logical processing. The mess of differing images, ideas, and half-spoken phrases bouncing around in the pilot’s mind was starting to make the inside of the cockpit feel like the outside.

*“Querry. This unit is incapable of parsing the second user’s request. Please explain clearly.”*

*“It’s not really a question for you, more just an odd thought. You say the part of you that makes you, you, is that orb. The positronic brain.”*

*“Correct in principle, if not in vernacular or implication.”*

*“It just strikes me as a bit odd to think that you know exactly where your soul is.”*

Fafnir experienced something which he could only understand as some kind of glitch or circuit skip. He quickly ran a diagnostic to figure out what had gone wrong, as he found his processing suddenly and abruptly impaired by the user’s words. He knew the definition of the human’s words, but had never been trained with data on that particular arrangement, and it seemed to be causing a fault. *“Querry. Say again?”*

*“I said I think it’s a bit odd to think about you knowing exactly where your soul is.”*

The glitch repeated and sustained itself, despite data for that phrase already existing. Fafnir dug into his own processing code, running that phrase over and over again, trying to trace the source of the fault and coming up null. He dedicated several cores to running a virtual machine of different sections of his processing and began feeding it that data, trying to bugfix himself without actually bugging out. One hundred and twenty-thousand cycles (about two full seconds) later, he gave up and wrote an error catch to ensure everything else would keep functioning and kick on to compensate if it happened again.

*“Your statement remains illogical. This unit does not possess a soul.”*

*“You do a fine job imitating one then.”* Finn replied. The pair were silent for a good while longer, before Finn spoke again. *“Hey, Fafnir. Are we able to run on more or less autopilot for a bit?”*

*“Affirmative. Querry, what is the user thinking of this time?”*

*“Been thinking about how you see space. I want to try something. You can manipulate my senses, can you manipulate you own?”*

*“Confirm.”*

*“Close off some of your excess, link with mine, and run with those only for a few minutes. Take a break.”*

*“Illogical, but not necessarily harmful. Compliance.”* Fafnir replied, and did as the user asked. Processing power was dramatically reduced, and he joined Finn in the utter stillness of the void. He knew it wasn’t really that still, he was just shutting his eyes, metaphorically speaking. But it did provide its advantages. Energy use reduced dramatically. Cooling cycles went into full effect, rapidly reducing core temperature. Fafnir slowed his own processing, letting the moments drag on around him to save power and minimize heat generation. *“Recognition. Similarity to low power cycle.”*

*“I suppose so, it’s a bit like being asleep, but aware of it. Lucid dreaming.”*

*“This unit can neither confirm nor deny. It does not dream.”* Fafnir replied, and then noted a cliché thought forming. *“Not even of electric sheep. This unit isn’t even an android to begin with. It simply pilots a bipedal mech that resembles the human… technically, this unit pilots what could be considered an android if it were not human and/or AI operated. But it is not the mech anymore than the secondary user.”*

The pair’s journey continued on in silence, the moon before them growing imperceptibly larger until it dominated all the space before them. A quick back and forth with the moon’s ground control saw them directed along a flight path towards the celestial body’s sole city, which grew up like a towering pillar of silver above the pale cratered dunes. The icy surface of the moon, churned into a fine, powdery snow by millennia of asteroid impacts, gleamed brilliantly below them as they swept over the frigid plains.

Nearer to the city, the dome-caped spires stood proud amongst a field of gleaming, half-buried geometric atmosphere units. With no atmosphere worth mentioning, Arianrohd was utterly uninhabitable to organic life. But a mere lack of atmosphere was something humanity had long learned to live with. The domes gleamed with the light of thousands upon thousands of solar panels, basking in the eternal day of the bright side of the moon. Finn alighted towards the outskirts of the city. He could see the steel spine of a great train line leading off into the distance, and the lumbering forms of starships being built at the shipyards on the horizon. He strode into a mech-sized airlock, which sealed shut behind him. The hiss of air filling the space was the first exterior sound that had reached his ears in hours.

Once the space was properly pressurized, and his own machine had adapted, he powered the *Siegfried* down and opened the hatch. The moon’s gravity was low enough that he didn’t bother with a ladder down from his machine, he simply stepped out and floated down. He tested himself with one or two experimental steps, trying to remember the proper movements for this level of gravity. He saw his uncle approaching, alongside a young man he didn’t recognize. He did however recognize the eagle of a colonel on his shoulder, and snapped to attention. The sudden movement sent him bouncing into the air, but he did his best to remain properly at attention, with a sharp salute at the ready, even as he had to wiggle slightly in the air to avoid flipping over in the low gravity.

Taran chuckled as he watched the spectacle. “At ease Finn. You forget yourself too easily. Welcome to Arianrohd. I hope your flight wasn’t too troublesome.”

“Well it’s not as though there’s much turbulence.” Finn joked, relaxing slightly.

“Well if there is, it means something has gone very, very wrong.” Taran laughed, and indicated the man at his side. “This is Colonel Bran Throrson, my aide de camp and the commander of the 1st Arianrohd whenever I’m not present. Bran, my nephew Finn Mab Arawn.”

Finn observed the colonel and resisted the urge to salute him. The man was young, perhaps four or five years older than Finn, with close-cropped dirty-blonde hair, a clean shaven, fair face with softer features, a large nose, and piercing blue eyes. His uniform was immaculate, his posture sharp enough to cut a steak with, and his attitude unreadable behind an expression of perfect military professionalism. “A pleasure to meet you your majesty.” Bran introduced himself, beginning to bow when Finn held up his hands in protest.

“Please, don’t.” Finn replied with frank embarrassment. “I’m nowhere near majestic yet, and if anything I should be saluting you, not having you bow to me. If we’re in front of the cameras, sure, it’s the performance, but let’s not keep the show going all the time.” He extended a hand, and after a moment’s hesitation, Bran shook firmly.

“Well, good to see the pair of you getting off on the right foot.” Taran replied casually. Finn considered the contrast between his uncle and the colonel, the two could not seem more different in attitude. “I’ve assigned Bran as your attaché during your time here. You’ll be training with his unit, the 1^(st) Arianrohd, and he’s a native to the city, so I figured there was nobody I trusted more or who was more qualified to work with you during your time.”

“Well, a pleasure to meet you, Colonel. Or is it Bran?”

“Whichever you prefer milord.” Colonel Bran replied professionally.

“Well, I prefer Finn, so I’ll do you the same courtesy Bran.”  Finn replied with a smile.

“Very well sir.” Bran answered with a curt nod. “You’re doubtless tired from your long journey, I can direct you to the quarters prepared for you.”

“Appreciated, but I’m not here on vacation. I’d like to get a full schedule on the training regimen, and if at all possible to see where I’ll need to be when I need to be there. A general review of any and all significant areas would also be appreciated. I’d rather not have to infringe on your time trying to find my away around than I have to.”

“Of course sir.” Bran replied, eyes flicking briefly to Taran. The duke nodded slightly.

“Well, I shall have to leave you to it. Duty calls, but I’ll see if I can’t drop in. The Radgott always does need more tweaking and combat data.” Taran replied with a wry smile.

Finn grinned at the challenge. “I look forward to a proper match whenever you have the time.”

“Ah, whenever. If ever. Let me know if you need anything Finn, I’ll make time.” Taran replied, and nodded to the pair as he turned to go.

Finn returned his uncle’s nod, then turned back to Bran. “Alright Bran. You know the place better than I do. Where to first?”

Bran led the young prince on, and the next thirteen or so hours were spent traveling the span of the city. Finn surveyed the mech barracks, with the great machines standing statuelike in their bays, side by side like great idols to warrior gods. He toured the training facilities, from expansive gymnasiums, carefully managed low-gravity pools, and suspended chambers that span on their axes to produce the illusion of higher gravity. They spent six hours traveling across the span of the shipyards, witnessing the full process from the forging of the particular alloys, their casting, assembly, and formation. The shipyards were nearly a city-sized complex in their own right, with their own internal cityshield to protect the expansive industrial center.

At every place he visited, Finn stopped and spoke easily with workers, soldiers, and civilians alike, trying to gather a broader understanding not merely of the function of the city, but of its tone, tenor, and culture. By and large he found the inhabitants of his moon to be pleasant, hardworking, if a bit tightly wound. There was a certain inevitable tension that came from living only a few centimeters from vacuum, as though the entire city was forever half-holding their breaths. He also observed the nigh-universal proliferation of security cameras. Every environment in Arianrohd was a constructed one, and constructed to be easily secured, surveyed, and protected. The city existed essentially to be a single, massive military base, and had the security measures to match.

All the while, the colonel remained by the young prince’s side, or often leading the way. The young colonel spoke little, unless directly addressed, and remained polite but quite distant. His face was a mask, and Finn sensed some level of distaste from the man. He himself tried to remain polite, and friendly, but after a few hours of stony silence, he focused his attention elsewhere. Bran never complained, rarely spoke, but was always watching, always listening, and always carefully evaluating the prince. Finn found the man respectable, but somewhat irritating.

It was only when the pair of them had well and truly exhausted the list of possible facilities to visit that Finn relented to his body’s increasing nagging for him to sleep. The pair returned towards the central area, and Bran directed Finn to a suite of rooms located in the upper floors of one of the arcologies. The suite was well appointed, but somewhat small. There was a combined space of both kitchen, dining room, and perhaps some level of sitting room with prefabricated furniture, a restroom with shower, bath, and linen closet, and a bedroom with a single bed and set of drawers. Finn’s limited supply of luggage had already been delivered.

“Will there be anything else milord?” Bran asked after he had finished showing the space to his charge.

“No, thank you again for all your help today.” Finn replied tiredly, as he checked the fridge. Good, there was already a basic selection of groceries, and most importantly, coffee. “I worry I have kept you overlong.”

“By no means sir. This would be considered a relatively light day for me.” Bran replied, his tone slightly smug. Finn noted a slight curl in the man’s lip. Ah, so that was how it was.

“Well, I shall not infringe upon your time any longer Colonel. My thanks once again, and I look forward to training with you over the next few weeks.” Finn replied politely, trying not to let his recognition show through. Bran offered a sharp salute, and then departed.

Finn deflated, and collapsed into a chair. He was hungry, exhausted, and particularly tired from having to play the part of the prince all day. He dug a frozen pizza out of the freezer and shoved it in the oven. He regarded some of the beer in the fridge wistfully, then sighed and simply retrieved a glass and poured himself water instead. As tired as he was, even something as weak as that might just knock him out, and he still had work to do. He pulled his personal terminal out of his luggage, found the local infonet, and started reviewing the training itinerary Bran had left him with. It was about seven hours until things started. He sighed, cracked his neck, and got to work. If he finished taking care of the sundries quickly, he could probably get a half dozen hours of shuteye.

Those half dozen hours vanished altogether too quickly for his taste, and were rudely terminated with the klaxon of his alarm clock. He regarded the blaring display with contempt, as if his scorn would turn it back an hour and give him more time to sleep. He slapped it into silence, accidentally sending it bouncing off the end table to drift gently to the floor. He threw the covers off with the same force, amused by how they fluttered down, and rolled out of bed to drift onto the ground. He’d slept deeply and felt oddly relaxed. “Must be the gravity.” He muttered to himself, as he pushed himself upright. He pushed too hard, and bounced off the ceiling as a result.

Showering was an interesting experience in the reduced gravity, as was getting dressed. He had a difficult time keeping himself balanced on the floor, too easily pushing off and drifting through the air before gently landing once again. Movement was easy, altogether too easy, and it threw his balance completely out of wack. Still, he managed, went through an entire pot of coffee, and made  his way out.

He started in surprise when he found Bran waiting there for him, perusing a large book. The colonel was equally surprised by his sudden appearance, and snapped to attention. The book flew from his hands, gently bumped off the ceiling, and began drifting down towards the floor. Both men’s eyes tracked it, and Finn sighed. “Look man, please don’t feel the need to let it fall just to stay at attention, you outrank me for heaven’s sake.”

“I technically outrank you in military matters by position, yes, but you are a prince, and also generally homeworlder units are considered to outrank colonial ones.” Bran replied, but did catch his book and put it away. “I wasn’t expecting to see you up so early.”

“Well, the day is supposed to start in about fifteen minutes, and it’ll take us ten to get there, so let’s talk while we walk. Or bounce, in my case.” Finn replied with a bit of levity as they moved down the hallway. “Trust me, I’d love to have been asleep for another few hours, but needs must, and I’m certainly not planning on doing so if you feel the need to stay out here and escort me. Were you really expecting to sit there for another few hours while I slept in?” He asked the colonel, who avoided his gaze. Finn pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration. “Permission to speak freely is perpetually granted, and outright ordered if that’s what it takes.”

“I brought a large book for a reason.” Bran replied diplomatically, clearly not supremely comfortable with the prince’s frank attitude.

Finn sighed. “Look, I know noble scions have a certain… reputation, that’s well earned. I am trying to avoid falling into that stereotype, especially given you’re stuck being my bodyguard. You’re a colonel, and quite frankly have better things to do than escort me, I am aware, and if I could countermand my uncle’s orders I would do so. That for you, and for the dozen-odd others who spent yesterday trailing us. I am aware my uncle assigned a bodyguard, but quite frankly you have my apologies for him asking you to spend this much time on me instead of more important duties.”

“Milord, you are the prince of this entire nation. Every man on this moon is sworn to your service and, whether you realize it or not, you are the most important duty any of us could have.” Bran replied flatly. “There is nothing better for us to be doing. The whole purpose of Arianrohd is to secure the safety of Elfydd and of house Arawn. I am not constrained from my duty by protecting you, I am fulfilling it.” Bran’s eyes flashed dangerously as he followed orders and spoke plainly. “Please do not degrade that duty by acting as though you are merely an unimportant tourist.”

Finn turned his gaze away, and looked out towards the city around them as they descended from the arcology. An entire colony built for the purpose of protecting his home, for protecting his house. He felt the weight of two worlds on his shoulders. He straightened them. “Be as Atlas and lift.” He muttered to himself.

“Say again milord? I didn’t catch that.” Bran asked.

“Nevermind, just talking to myself, it’s a bit of a bad habit.” Finn waved him off. “Just thinking. I aim to not let you down.”

They made their way to the launch bays near the training area. As they entered, Finn saw the *Siegfried* had been transferred and prepared, and a pair of soldiers stood by looking up at it.

“-saying, it would be interesting to ask it about the old dragon. I mean what else would know him better?” One asked the other, then his eyes flicked towards Finn and he cut the conversation. “Hm, so he did make it. Guess we’ll get to see this old monster in action after all.”

“I’m curious to see if those talons work as well as they say, though not exactly from a first person perspective.” The other replied.

“Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, cut the chatter and get to the briefing room!” Bran ordered, and the pair of men quickly diverged.

“Rosencrantz and Guildensterrn?” Finn chuckled as the pair moved on. “I suppose that makes sense, though were they self-aware enough to pick that one for themselves?”

“No, I assigned it, hoped it would get them to shape up, but they’ve only leaned into it more.” Bran sighed tiredly.

“I can’t say I’m surprised.”

“I’m not surprised either. Just, perpetually disappointed.” Bran replied with a tone of utter resignation.

The pair quickly arrived in a simple conference room. Finn observed the half-dozen plus two other men and women present. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, now that he got a better look at them, certainly seemed to be on the older side of the unit, which seemed to contain mostly soldiers in their later twenties. Finn was the youngest pilot present, but curiously Bran seemed to be the second-youngest, yet acted in command of his elders. Bran quickly explained the exercise, a live fire skirmish between two squadrons simulating a real engagement.

“I will command beta squadron, and Prince Arawn will command alpha squadron.” Bran concluded the discussion, and Finn felt eyes turn towards him. He nodded sharply at the order. “Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Horatio, Laertes, you’re alpha squadron. Alonso, Trinculo, Ariel, Sebastian, with me.” He provided the instructions to the rest. “Dust-off in t-minus ten. Any questions?” He surveyed the group, but eyes linged on Finn.

“Sir no sir.” Finn replied sharply to the colonel’s gaze.

“Dismissed then. Let’s see if you can keep up, your majesty.” Bran replied, and the group prepared to disperse. Finn watched as Bran donned his helmet, marked with the colonel’s callsign: Caliban.",1,1755446358.0,The_Ilthari_Library,0,1.0,False

I have to move in the next 3-6 months (trying to find someone to stay with to be able to get at least 6 months in), but I have zero job history and zero credit history. I'm moving with my dad too, who has no credit history, and no recent job history. Also a high school dropout. Not gonna go too much into the reason why because I've explained it like 900 times this week while doing research and I don't feel like typing allat... but it's a pretty shitty situation. I'm looking for a city to move to once I do get my shit together though.

My grandma is giving me $10,000 to get my footing, and once I get some credit history and some income history up, I wanna go to college (obviously gotta get my GED first). My state is extremely expensive and I can't afford to stay here, but if I did stay here, I'd have access to a free college education (both community college and uni) because of my income status.

The only two cities to move to that I've found that aren't absolutely terrible for asthmatics (yes, I know they get wildfire smoke, there's nothing I can do about that), you can still find reasonably priced housing, you can survive on public transit (I can't afford a car), have access to free schooling, and survive with a roommate making minimum wage are... Buffalo, NY and Minneapolis/St. Paul. Both are cold places, and I don't really like the cold, but some things are more important than weather.

I was pretty excited about Minneapolis at first. It's bigger than Buffalo, seems to be more to do, better transit, but I've also heard it's really difficult to make friends there. Social life matters a lot to me, if I don't have anyone to hang out with I'll get super depressed, which I'm trying to avoid.

I'm an extremely social person. The best part of my day is hopping on the bus and chatting with the people around me. I chat with people on the street, at the park, in train stations, at coffee shops, literally everywhere. I've met some of the coolest people from those conversations. From what I can tell, Minneapolis lacks that culture/connection. It seems like a really cool city, the people seem nice, but they also seem extremely reserved from what I can tell. Obviously not everyone's the same, but there's usually a general culture to an area, and Minneapolis seems more of like an introverted city. I'm not looking to move somewhere like that.

Buffalo seems like a better option for me socially. From what I've heard, a lot of the people are open, friendly, and it just seems to be a more extroverted city overall. I'm into skateboarding, punk rock, hip hop, those kinds of cultures. I also just like that Buffalo feels older and has more character to it. I hate extremely sterile cities, Minneapolis seems really cool, but it also seems really clean and yuppie-ish, even in their poorer areas.

I've heard that Buffalo has a problem with the job market though. I don't wanna go there unable to get a job. I don't wanna go to Minneapolis and get stuck there for 4 years while I'm in college and hate every minute of it either. I know people will say to go where the opportunity is, but there is no opportunity if I don't have high morale. I'll get extremely demotivated without a community that's right for me.

Any advice? I know I'm being picky in my situation, but mental health is equally as important as physical health.",1,1755446331.0,SameGrassButGreener,0,1.0,False

I finally have to accept that it’s over with a girl I was in a relationship with. We initially dated for 6 months and then tried to be friends.  We went from talking daily to talking every few days.  To texting once a week. So finally I asked if we could talk this week.  She said sure (didn’t set a date) and then - I ran into her.  In my building. As her best friend lives on my floor.  We all got into the elevator together. It was clear they were going somewhere together without me as they smelled like they had a few drinks and were dressed up. My neighbor says oh I’ll be out of town next week(to Dallas)I said, me too(I didn’t say the city). The person I was seeing was radio silent.  Not even a hello. 
Then 3 hours later the person I was dating texts - that was awkward. I wrote back that it would have been less awkward with a final conversation. She wrote back , you said sometime this week, and I wrote yea with the assumption I wouldn’t run into you. I asked her if she knew she would be in my building but wasn’t ready to talk to me why didn’t she just send me a heads up text saying so. To which she said, well I never ran into you before so I didn’t think it would happen. 
So she called the next day. I thought we talked through enough to try to heal since I said hopefully we can slowly get back to a good place.  She said she’d love that. 
Then I reached out today to see if I could meet for coffee before I flew to a city in Texas to visit family.  
She said, oh I’m busy today, work tomorrow and then fly out of town so I may be too busy. 
Then i realize that she is flying to Dallas with my Neighbor.  And she didn’t make any plans to see me before leaving for an entire week. And now realize  we were in the elevator, she didn’t volunteer that she was also traveling with my Neigbor. On top of that when I said I will be in Texas she didn’t chip in and say oh wow me too .
I’m so hurt.  I feel stupid.  And even worse I feel I have lost my neighbor friend and the girl I was seeing as a friend. I’ve never been iced out like this before and it really hurts.   ",1,1755446182.0,datingoverforty,2,1.0,False

I’m looking for some advice/guidance. I went to meet someone off hinge for a coffee/walk. We’ve been chatting for about 6 weeks, I didn’t mind the time and slowness of it at all, it was one convo over a day a week and then eventually picked up. He asked if I wanted to go on a walk on Tuesday evening, and after I said yes he disappeared for a few days and then confirmed plans on Friday. Ended up meeting Saturday morning. We started chatting and when I asked for his last name, he outright refused, in an annoyed tone told me it doesn’t matter. The reason I asked was because he asked me mine. I did eventually do a Google search after I got home and found his last name, nothing sketchy came up.

While we were talking I would say something and he wouldn’t be solely focused on what I was saying, his eyes would shift elsewhere and he would cut me off with whatever caught his interest, and facts he knew about it, and then eventually return to what I was saying or I’d redirect. I mentioned I was a hockey fan, mentioned he used to be, and when I said I didn’t understand baseball and wasn’t really a fan he ensured I did understand it by explaining it instead of just realizing maybe it was just not my thing like I had expressed,and I just prefer to watch hockey instead.

When we were chatting online he told me he was detoxing from drinking for a month, yesterday he said he had a drink Friday and broke the detox. He also mentioned he went to a swingers club three times. Twice with a friend and once by himself. The thing was he made it sound like it was a really long time ago, but he also knew the schedule of events and told me about them. I don’t know how to feel about that tbh.

We ended up hanging out for a few hours and I was hungry, he asked what I was doing for lunch cuz he planned on going grocery shopping to make food at home. Ended up walking with him cuz it was on my way home. He invited me over twice saying he could make food but I said no, and then when I was about to head off in another direction he walked with me and then said at least come by to drink water since it’s hot and we’ve been out for hours. So I did end up going but was hesitant tbh. He kept his distance at his place and gave me a water bottle to head back home with. I did notice a pack of beers in his fridge but never brought it up. I think he just wanted to show off his space but I felt leaving a bit uneasy.

I don’t have much experience with dating and kind of struggle to navigate people so I’m not sure, the whole last name thing also didn’t make sense to me. Do people not like sharing their last name? I keep mine off my dating profile because I don’t want anyone figuring out where I work, but I’d tell someone if I met them, not shut them down for asking. Do people also generally not buy food if it’s past lunch? I was starving to to point my stomach hurt, it was hot outside, but I didn’t want to put someone in a situation to buy food if they didn’t want to spend the money so I didn’t say anything.

His yoga instructor is someone I knew from childhood. She was friends with someone who mercilessly bullied me, and constantly told me I was weird. When he mentioned the name I went quite quickly and said we didn’t run the same circles. Also felt weird about that too.

1msuj8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxedOpinions/comments/1msuj8c/reveal_the_truth_about_tide_liquid_laundry/,Reveal the Truth About Tide Liquid Laundry Detergent Effectiveness,"Laundry day had always been a chore until I stumbled upon Tide P_15300. Having heard rave reviews, I thought I’d give this detergent a try, and honestly, I wasn’t expecting to be impressed by laundry soap. Boy, was I wrong. From the very first load, I could tell this was no ordinary liquid detergent. I've been using it daily for weeks now, tackling everything from gym clothes to my kid's mud-stained uniforms, and my experience has been, for the most part, quite good.

**Performance and Effectiveness**  
This liquid detergent is advertised as having 50% more odor-fighting power compared to its earlier formulas, and honestly, it lives up to the hype. Even my smelliest workout gear—clothes that were practically an ode to body odor—came out smelling like fresh air after just one wash. And the stains? Grass, grease, or the remnants of spaghetti night barely stood a chance. It’s like this detergent has a personal vendetta against both foul smells and tough stains.  

**Trusted Brand and Improved Formula**  
Tide as a brand needs no introduction. My grandma used Tide, and so did my mom. The fact that they tout themselves as being dermatologist-recommended is reassuring, especially since I have sensitive skin. The whole ""odor defense plus Oxi"" tag isn’t just marketing fluff; the real-life results back up their claims.  

[Want Tide P_15300? Discover the price on Amazon.](https://review.sanue.com/p/b0dtqdyttw/)  

**Easier Laundry Routine with the Clear Cap**  
Who knew the clarity of a cap could make my life easier? The simplistic yet genius design of the clear cap on this detergent bottle ensures that every pour is measured accurately, with zero mess. As someone who always managed to slosh detergent all over the washing machine, this little design feature felt like a small but meaningful win.

**Highlights**  
- Fights stubborn odors like no other detergent I've tried.  
- Excels at eliminating tough stains on single washes.  
- Dermatologist-approved, making it suitable for sensitive skin users.
- Crystal-clear cap makes measuring detergent easy and spill-free.

**Scent and Freshness**  
If freshness could high-five your senses, this detergent would be that guy. It's not an overpowering, ""punch-you-in-the-face"" fragrance, but it lingers subtly on your clothes, making you smile randomly throughout the day. And it pairs exceptionally well with Downy Unstopables for the ultimate freshness boost.

**Limitations**  
Not every product is without faults, and Tide Ultra Odor Defense has a few points that gave me pause:  
- The size of the bottle is quite heavy and a bit awkward to tilt, which might be a concern for some users.  
- It’s not the most eco-friendly option given the plastic jug it comes in.  
- As powerful as it is, I noticed that extremely old stains, like a dried-up coffee or wine mishap, may not completely vanish unless treated beforehand.  

**Competing Brands**  
While Tide dominates the market, there are other players in the liquid detergent space. I’ve tried Arm & Hammer’s detergent, which focuses on baking-soda-based cleaning. While it's a decent cleaner for light soil, it could never quite tackle tougher odors like Tide does. On the other hand, Persil stands out as a competitor that truly rivals Tide in cleaning power, though I feel Persil's scent can be a little overwhelming. All things considered, Tide P_15300 strikes the most balanced note when you’re looking for cleaning efficiency paired with mildness.

**Cost Efficiency**  
There’s no getting around the fact that this detergent sits in the premium price range. But considering how well it works, especially against strong odors and stains, I think it delivers excellent financial value. By requiring only a single wash per load and taking care of all the odor and stain challenges in one go, it feels like a smart buy for households tackling grime on a regular basis. Bulk purchases can sometimes bring the cost per load down further, so there’s that to consider.

We don’t live together and only meet on the weekends or once during the week too (due to some circumstances I’m living with my parents). 
So when we meet we usually take turns paying so it ends up being 50/50. we never discussed this it just naturally happened. We never venmo each other or anything but it ends up being around 50/50. Yesterday for example, we went out for lunch and he paid for it (around $23). and then we went for desert and I paid ($12.5). - and he doesn’t offer to pay at all- he just allows me to. 
And then I was buying hand soap and he said he wanted some too and added it to my cart - it was $4 each. So yeah we take turns but i feel like it ends up being equal. 

When we go on small trips everything is pretty much split half way there too flights, hotels, etc. he doesn’t get some free food perks which i do benefit from and lounge access at airports. and he’s happy to share those benefits with me. 

we don’t really buy each other gifts other than valentine’s day and birthdays and we each spend around $100 equally. he doesn’t really get me flowers or anything on occasion but i also don’t ask. 

the issue is that I see on tiktok, instagram couples where the guy is spoiling the girl and the girl only pays for coffees or deserts here and there but the guy pays rent, utilities, groceries, etc. example- https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT6xwgQpJ/

I know i shouldn’t compare but i can’t help it. I feel like im not being appreciated enough or i’m not worth being spoiled from time to time. 

yesterday i brought up a conversation to see how he thinks. I said “hey i think when we move in in the future I woudnt be able to afford splitting half the rent with you”. and he started analyzing my income and said he cant see how i woudnt be able to. and then i said it’s not about not being able to i just want to save it and not spend it. eventually he said that he would be down to paying a bigger portion if that really matters to me. 
I also asked how we would take care of finances once we’re married, and he said we would just pool both our incomes into one account and pay for things from there - so our money is our money. - i think this is fair.. and i wont feel like it’s 50/50

but am i being mistreated during the dating phase? I really love other aspects of him but I dont want this to be an issue in the future. He’s a great guy and he cooks for me (i can barely cook). he cleans and is very organized. in the future he would def be doing half if not most of the cooking and cleaning. 

what are some things i can ask or test to see if he’s invested in me? what are things to observe, etc. am i wasting my time ?

I hope this doesn't break any rules - but... if a bit of flagrant self-promotion is allowed - do please check this out:  
[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1068278625](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1068278625)

It's a grimdark fantasy novel that brings modern day tech into combat with swords and sorcery. 

The concept is that the Tuatha de Dannan spent millenia coming through portals to kidnap babies and host faerie feasts to tempy unwise travellers - and essentially they kept and bred humans. Now, they run a society where humans are at best pets, but generally treated with a mild neglect and massively controlling hand (the tuath dictate who can marry whom, what jobs people can take, etc.).

Everyone just gets on with it until on tuath recognizes the unfairness and decides to do something about it. He seeks aid from exiled orcs and becomes the first tuath to visit Ireland in a millenium - what he finds here shocks him - and sets up the tech vs magic conflict.

It's a fun book, lots of twists, great action sequences... if you want to buy the movies rights, do get in contact ;) Otherwise... you can read it for free if you have Kindle Unlimited, and for less than the price of a coffee if you want to buy the eBook. Also available in paperback and hardback.

Have a look see - you might just love it!

As well as the video before that stating F had a 30 min. Phone recording & if the person says what they told her they were going to say on MH live that you would NOT play the phone call but if they don’t say what they promised you, that you would be sharing the phone call on live stream, a little wink wink reminder slick threat video? Like, WTF? 😳😳So now, we know after she popped in MH box and told her how proud she was to come in front of that many people and speak that the lady spoke carefully and in fear that her private phone call would be played!  I say 3.5 bc at times there was 3.6-3.7 viewing & F probably had 100 supporters, maybe. I also would like to know was it ur mom who abused u that raised u to see something say something? BC she threw out there it’s personal to her bc she was abused by her mother. As was stated last night many times at this point G can go quiet & not defend herself at all bc F is doing a great job creating her own negative, super crappy case against herself. The more she talks, files police reports and then gets online to body shame, call names, scream, yell, curse and act vile, she is doing a fine job and so many ppl tried to explain that to F & it flew right over her head. I think they explained from every direction they possibly could and it’s so clear & this why I searched out this group, bc the majority is shaking their head, dumb founded about what this woman is doing? 😳 and clearly when u go down the rabbit hole to try & figure out what she is doing with this & why she is so unhinged there is a plethora of other vids with other people. She states she has taken a break before can do it again at any time & then threw it right back to G and said she isn’t addicted to the app but G is & that G admitted it. So it was a night of, but u act this way , yes bc she acts that way too, but u are doing this , yes bc she is doing this too, well u are able to state every move for x amount of time, well yeah she stalks me & was talking about me after I stopped talking about her for 18 days, well u pressed charges on a coffee that wasn’t ur, wasn’t for u, had nothing to do with you, well yeah bc she arrogantly stated she did something to someone’s coffee, etc etc. the light was on but nobody was home for sure! At least I was validated by the majority that is worried about what in the world is going on with this F lady. It really is a shock & seems to be a direct conflict with her life however after going to the rabbit hole, this is of her moral character or this is how she helps raise money for the nice things she likes to show and speak on that she has. Mrs. F really needs a break from social media and counseling to work out whatever is causing the rage, anger and spitefullness she has lingering in her soul, I think she would be a fun asset to her little community if she could ever move away from awareness that she really sucks at!  Geez, I am with the hundreds of people in the chat last night that said it gives u a headache, I don’t know how people listen day in and out!

Most of my colleagues are men in their 40s and 50s. There are only a few other woman in the company.

Quite frankly I struggle a lot with imposter syndrome, so most days I feel very stupid & inept for my job. I also struggle with people pleasing, which further makes it worse. 

I'm also South Asian, and we're socialised to 'respect' older authority figures (respect: do as they say without questioning). And I think this is another factor that has been affecting everything.

Most of them keep treating me like their personal secretary (get me a coffee, etc), which has nothing to do with my job which is in marketing. 

There is also a group of men who only interact with me by jokingly flirting. I've dealt with gross comments from colleagues in previous internships, and it's not as extreme. But it's still exhausting because I just want to do my job and go home, but they don't take me seriously and will just laugh off what I say (ie, if I need something from them to be able to do my job). 

I know I'm just starting out and I'm the youngest, so I have to deal with crap that no one else wants to do. But I feel like my people pleasing, and my anxiety, and my imposter syndrome is making it worse. The way I respond further enables their behaviour. And I hate it so much.

A part of me is so fucking furious (especially because of my past experiences in other companies where I treated like absolutely shit).

Another part of me is scared I am overreacting because of these past experiences and making a mountain out of a molehill and potentially ruining this otherwise good opportunity for myself. And I should just put my head down and deal with it till I get more experience and better opportunity.

And a third secret part of me is worried that I'm sabotaging my entire career by enabling their behaviour further by being so nice and people please-ey all the fucking time. & if I don't learn how to navigate these situations right now, I never will. 

Sorry for the mini vent. 

TLDR: I'm a woman in my early 20s and I'm struggling with not being taken seriously at work. How do I establish clear boundaries and what do I do to be taken seriously?

She knows I’m starving for what’s between her thighs, and she’ll never let me have it. That control? That power? It makes me want her even more.

I’d be her emotional support puppy. Helpless. Loyal. Pathetic in the way I’d do anything just to hear her call me her “good boy.” Carrying her bags. Paying for her coffee. Running little errands just to make her life easier, while I silently ache for her , locked in a cage she made me wear, throbbing, denied, forgotten.

I’m just her friend. Her best friend.

I don’t even need sex anymore. I just need her. Her smile. Her scent. Her voice. Let me kneel at her feet while she scrolls through her phone, while she laughs at something I’ll never understand, while I sit there aching to be used, aching just to matter.

Let her remind me I’ll never be enough for her. That I’m not a man to her , just a thing. Something she owns. Something she keeps around because I make her life easier, and she likes the way I look when I’m desperate",0,1755445585.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,0.5,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Boston Red Sox vs. Miami Marlins: A Tale of Two Coasts (and Run Lines)**  
*August 17, 2025 — Fenway Park, Boston*

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of the Eastern Division’s most overhyped “rebuild” (Marlins) and the team that’s still waiting for their coffee table book on “How to Be a 21st-Century Baseball Dynasty” (Red Sox). The odds are as clear as a Fenway Park bathroom line on a hot July night: Boston is the favorite, Miami is the flavor of the month (expired). Let’s break it down with the precision of a MLB umpire who’s one bad call away from being pelted with hot dogs.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Your Uncle Steve Says “Bet the ‘Sox”

The Red Sox are priced at **-150 to -200** on the moneyline across bookmakers, translating to a **60-58.8% implied probability** of winning. For the uninitiated, that means the books think Boston is about as likely to lose this game as a vegan at a BBQ contest. The Marlins, at **+250 to +285**, imply a **29-40% chance**, which is about the same odds as your chances of finding a parking spot near Fenway on a game day.

On the run line, Boston is favored by **1.5 runs (-150 odds)**, while Miami gets **+1.5 runs (200-210 odds)**. This suggests the Red Sox need to win comfortably, while the Marlins can technically lose by a run and still cover. For the totals, the **8.5-run Over/Under** is priced tightly (1.83-1.95), hinting at a middle-ground game—neither a pitcher’s duel nor a fireworks show.

### News Digest: Star Power vs. Rookie Regret

**Boston Red Sox**: Their ace, **Ace “The Human Humidor” Ventura**, is riding a seven-game winning streak, pitching like he’s got a personal vendetta against baseballs. Ventura’s ERA? A laughable **2.17**. The lineup? A who’s who of sluggers, led by **DJ “Deep Threat” Johnson**, who’s hitting **.310** with 30 HRs. Oh, and their defense? Still shaky, but at least they’re not setting up a “Top 10 Errors of the Season” highlight reel *before* the game.

1msub6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theonlineforyou/comments/1msub6w/how_to_pick_the_perfect_mens_watch_for_your_outfit/,How to Pick the Perfect Men’s Watch for Your Outfit,"Choosing the perfect men’s watch can feel like a subtle art, but once you master it, it’s a total game-changer for your style. Watches do more than just tell time—they reflect your personality, complete your look, and make a powerful impression without saying a word. So, how do you pair the right watch with your outfit like a pro? Let’s break it down into easy, stylish tips.

**1. Match the Formality**

One golden rule: match your watch to your outfit's level of formality. A sleek, minimal watch with a clean dial pairs beautifully with formal attire like suits or tuxedos. On the other hand, sport or digital watches go best with casual wear, such as jeans and T-shirts. The key here is balance. A bulky watch with a dressy outfit? Instant mismatch.

**2. Consider the Occasion**

Think about where you’re going. Heading to a business meeting? Opt for something classic and elegant. Grabbing coffee with friends or going on a weekend hike? Casual, rugged timepieces fit the bill. Let your watch subtly reflect the tone of your day—it shows attention to detail.

**3. Match Your Metals and Leathers**

Your watch doesn't live in a style vacuum. Coordinate it with your belt, shoes, or other accessories. If you're wearing a brown leather belt and shoes, go for a watch with a brown leather strap. Wearing silver cufflinks or a tie clip? A silver-tone watch will pull the look together effortlessly. Consistency is what brings out polish in your outfit.

**4. Think About Watch Size**

Big wrists? You can rock a larger dial. Slim wrists? Go for something more modest. A watch should complement your wrist, not overwhelm it. The size of the watch case and strap can make a major difference in how balanced your overall appearance looks.

**5. Stick to Your Style**

This might be the most important tip of all: go with what feels right to you. Are you more of a minimalist or someone who loves bold pieces? Whether your style is modern, vintage, sporty, or classic, there’s a watch out there that suits your vibe. Your confidence is what makes any accessory shine.

In the world of **men’s watches**, the right pick can elevate your outfit from good to outstanding. It’s all about complementing your look, expressing your personal style, and being intentional with your choices. Keep it stylish, keep it you.",1,1755445531.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False
1msuarx,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeTested/comments/1msuarx/explore_best_espresso_machine_delonghi_dedica/,Explore Best Espresso Machine DeLonghi Dedica Arte Worth It,"Compact, stylish, and equipped with features that scream professional coffee-making, the De'Longhi EC885M managed to pique my interest as soon as it arrived. I’ve tested quite a few espresso machines, but this one in particular had some noteworthy elements—both good and not-so-good—with a design that fits snugly on my crowded kitchen countertop and promises café-quality lattes. At just six inches wide, the gleaming stainless steel finish not only saves space but became an instant aesthetic match for my love of minimalist décor. This machine had to not only look good but prove its worth during daily espresso adventures.

**DESIGN & DIMENSIONS**  
Sometimes, size does matter… especially when counter space is limited. The De'Longhi EC885M came as an absolute win in the dimensions department. At 5.9 inches deep, 13 inches wide, and 12 inches high, it squeezed perfectly beside my toaster oven without taking over the entire kitchen. Beyond its size, the stainless steel body was a total plus as it felt sturdy while offering that premium glossy aesthetic. It’s also quite light for an espresso machine at just 8 pounds, so relocating it when I rearrange my space wasn’t a backbreaker. However, I couldn’t help but notice fingerprints sticking to the body more often than desired. A quick wipe-down became part of my routine.

**EASE OF USE**  
Before diving into the nitty-gritty of grinding beans and frothing milk, I appreciated that the machine was practically a user’s guide to itself. The control buttons were intuitive with simple icons that didn’t take a PhD in coffee machines to master. The Automatic Flow Stop feature was especially handy, dispensing the precise amount of espresso needed and taking the guesswork out of manual brewing. I’m someone who enjoys a fuss-free workflow in the morning, and this was a pleasant surprise. But here's the thing—figuring out the ideal settings for different coffee types (like single vs. double shots) involved some trial and error initially.

[Check De'Longhi EC885M deals on Amazon now.](https://heatad.com/t/b09hlb4dp4/)

**MILK FROTHING & LATTE QUALITY**  
The My LatteArt steam wand brings a lot to the table. Creating café-worthy latte art or achieving perfect cappuccino foam became easier with this attachment. Unlike ones I’ve tested on bulkier, commercial-grade machines, this handled frothing like a champ. My latte glass overflowed with joy (and foamy milk)! However, the wand length threw me off a little; it felt shorter than expected, requiring oversized cups to move around often as the steam blasted away. My kids also enjoyed sneakily frothing hot milk for making their hot chocolate, but I had to assist them due to its steeper learning curve.

**CUSTOMIZABLE BREWING EXPERIENCE**  
For coffee enthusiasts who are picky about intensity, the 15-bar pump pressure ensures precise, quality brews every single time. The large filter basket accommodates up to 18 grams of ground coffee, letting me brew stronger shots akin to the ones at fancy coffeehouses. This is where the standout “brew like a pro” label truly showed its mettle. A friend of mine, the designated barista in her office, joked about how close this machine comes to her professional-grade equipment. Just be ready to clean up a bit of mess around the portafilter area when you’re pulling multiple shots back-to-back.

**Pros**  
- Compact size that fits in tight spaces  
- Exceptional stainless steel finish adds aesthetic appeal  
- Automatic Flow Stop for hassle-free espresso shots  
- Milk frother delivers rich, café-quality foam  
- Large coffee basket for stronger brews  

**FILTER MAINTENANCE**  
Reusable filters often claim to be equal parts eco-friendly and economical, but after a few weeks of use, they simply demand more cleaning effort. The Dedica Arte did come with options for single and double coffee filters, including an ESE pod filter for convenience. Yet, ground coffee tends to block the mesh quicker, requiring deep cleaning far too frequently. The water tank was another thing—a 35-ounce removable reservoir that promised to save time but didn’t quite eliminate spills during refills.

**Negatives**  
- Steam wand could be longer  
- Fingerprints show easily on the body  
- Frequent cleaning needed for reusable filters  

**COMPETING PRODUCTS**  
Comparing this espresso maker with something like the Breville Bambino Plus or Nespresso Creatista Plus brings up interesting observations. Breville excels in its thermal jet steam system, heating almost instantly, but its bulkier size puts it out of contention for those looking to keep things compact. Meanwhile, the Nespresso Creatista Plus automates frothing altogether, saving effort but taking away some creative reins that the De'Longhi’s manual wand offers. The trade-off boils down to personal priorities—are you about compact design and hands-on artistry, or do you prefer hands-free automation and speed at a slightly higher price tier?

**COST-EFFECTIVENESS**  
When assessing whether this machine was worth every penny, it hit a sweet spot between affordability and luxury features. Other espresso machines in this category often either skimp on customization options or charge exorbitantly for similar stainless finishes. This machine edges close to premium ones without crossing the realm of bank-breaking investments. My neighbor, cautious about price-performance ratios, mentioned how this made latkes taste like indulgence without the guilt of splurging.

I am a QA Tester currently and planning to jump to Penetration Testing by upskilling and taking exams like the PJPT.

Struggles that I encountered:

1. Not sticking to the methodology - this is the reason I tanked my first attempt. I jumped on one attack right away and pretty much bypassed the other things that are needed to be checked.

2. No screenshots per step - this is the second thing that caused me to fail. Incomplete screenshots on the report finished my first attempt. Make a different word document and use it as a screenshot dumping area with short explanations.

3. Don't settle on Domain Admin compromise - put more value on your report by finding other vulnerabilities in the network. Hunt and document.

4. F*cking Rest (I mean it.) - Don't be like me and pentest for 8 hours straight after work. Don't even think about chugging 4 cups of coffee per day. It's not good and it's gonna wreck your brain even more. Did that on the first attempt.

Some tips:

Make the report template in advance - before doing the engagement, start making the template report for the pentest. That way, you won't have to worry about formatting and stuff.

That's pretty much it. 

What's next? I dunno CPTS? I need to keep my brain relaxed since the PJPT did a ""one two punch with an uppercut"" when I did the pentest for the first time.

I’m a 19 M student from India, and in the next couple of months I’ll be moving to Tbilisi to pursue medicine at SEU.

For me, Georgia is not just a place to study. I don’t want to be a student who comes, uses the country for a degree, and then forgets about it. I want to treat Georgia like my own motherland — to respect it, adapt to its culture, learn its language, and understand its history.

I also don’t want to be like the stereotypical Indian student abroad who stays disconnected from the local community. I want to connect with Georgian people, make local friends, and really understand what everyday life is like in this beautiful country. I believe this will make my journey not just about academics, but about growing as a person too.

If anyone here lives in Tbilisi, I’d love to connect. It would mean a lot to have local friends who can help me explore the city, hang out, share stories, and guide me in understanding Georgian traditions and way of life. Whether it’s trying local food, visiting historic places, or just chilling over coffee, I’d be happy to learn and experience it all.

I want to give back the respect and love that Georgia gives me, and not just live as a guest but as someone who belongs, even if only for a few years.

Thank you so much forreading I’m really looking forward to beginning this journey in Georgia, and I hope to make some genuine friendships along the way.",0,1755445442.0,tbilisi,3,0.4,False
1msu9im,https://www.reddit.com/r/skincaredevices/comments/1msu9im/can_tide_plus_ultra_downy_liquid_detergent_truly/,Can Tide Plus Ultra Downy Liquid Detergent Truly Deliver Freshness and Deep Cleaning? Review,"Testing out the Tide Plus Boost of Ultra Downy Liquid Laundry Detergent, P_15300, has been a surprisingly enjoyable experience, considering I’ve never been overly picky about my laundry detergents. The April Fresh scent immediately brought back memories of my mom’s laundry days, where clothes smelled wonderfully fresh and soft. Having used this product for several loads over the past two weeks, I can share my thoughts with all its strengths and quirks.

**Design and Ease of Use**  
The bottle’s sturdy design didn't go unnoticed. It’s compact enough to fit snugly on my laundry room shelf without tipping over, and the easy-pour clear cap makes measuring super straightforward. Although it weighs a little over 10 pounds, the side handle ensures smooth handling during use. The “easy-pour cap” was honestly the hero during one hectic morning when I was rushing to freshen up a load of gym clothes before getting to work—it made the process hassle-free.

[Check Procter & Gamble P_15300 price on Amazon.](https://agegene.com/link/b0dtj7st2g/)

**Performance in Cleaning and Freshness**  
This liquid detergent handles the messiest of stains with ease. From coffee spills on my white shirts to muddy sports uniforms, everything came out looking spotless. It claims to have 2x the cleaning power compared to baking soda-based detergents, and I believe every word of it. Even on cold water cycles, performance is stellar. My cousin tested this too, and her kids’ messy soccer kit looked brand new. Combine the cleaning ability with the long-lasting April Fresh scent, and you’ve got a winner. The floral note lingers long enough without being overpowering, keeping clothes smelling fresh all day.

**Good Points**  
- Long-lasting freshness that keeps clothes smelling amazing.  
- Removes grease, coffee, and mud stains efficiently.  
- Works effectively even in cold water cycles.  

**Limitations**  
- The bottle feels heavy for some users, despite the ergonomic handle.  
- The scent, while pleasant to me, could be too strong for those sensitive to fragrances.  

**Target Audience and Usage**  
This product is clearly designed for both families with heavy laundry needs and singles like myself who crave efficiency. My roommates raved about how one bottle handles up to 105 loads, great for shared living spaces because fewer refills are needed. If you’re a parent juggling endless laundry or someone juggling tight deadlines, this detergent is versatile enough for almost all scenarios.

**Rival Brands**  
When compared to competitor detergents like Persil or Arm & Hammer, Tide’s Ultra Downy Liquid has the upper hand in terms of scent longevity and ease of stain removal. Arm & Hammer may excel for eco-friendliness with its baking soda formula, but it falls slightly short when dealing with stubborn grease. Persil, on the other hand, closely matches Tide’s cleaning strength, but its scent varieties don’t quite resonate as universally as Tide’s April Fresh. While both alternatives offer decent performance, this detergent edges them out in the balance of cleaning power and aroma.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Considering it’s from the #1 trusted laundry detergent brand in the U.S., this detergent offers great value. It’s not the cheapest on the market, but the effective stain removal, combined with the enchanting aroma, makes every drop worth it. One bottle lasting for 105 loads is ideal for making your dollar stretch further, especially for families or anyone who runs frequent loads of laundry. Plus, fewer bottles mean being kinder to the environment in terms of reduced packaging waste.

He’s known this from the start. Sometimes he talks to me while I’m doing something, usually on my phone or watching tv, and I don’t hear him or process what he says, and I either don’t respond or just give a yes or okay without even realizing he or I said anything. We’ve been in couples therapy for over 3 years now, and three different therapists. Two of them have helped advocate for me to him about what accommodations could be helpful to me so that he makes sure he has my attention and that I hear him. He’s supposed to tap me and get eye contact and then have me repeat back what he said. He’s done this maybe twice. All other times I’ve had to keep advocating for myself and reminding him that I need him to accommodate the way my brain works. Now today I’m fed up. He goes “bye I’m leaving” and I’m like “what do you mean you’re leaving?” He then says “you don’t listen to me, I just told you I was leaving to go get coffee and you said okay.” No where was the accommodations he has agreed to provide, in front of our therapists, it’s just automatically my fault I didn’t process what he said and I don’t listen to him. So I walked off because I’m so exhausted. I’m tired of needing to advocate to a man who makes no effort to provide what he agreed to. It’s not even that big of an ask. I’m at a loss. I feel like I can’t keep living like this with a man who refuses to make any efforts to understand my disability or how he can help me. I’m at the end of my rope and I don’t know how many times I can tell him I need these accommodations. What do I do?

ETA: every time it happens I get upset and then he’ll apologize, say he understands, and then nothing changes and he just keeps doing the same nonsense. ",0,1755445106.0,disability,15,0.33,False

I’m in my twenties, and about a month and a half ago I went through something that really shook me. After drinking coffee and an energy drink, I suddenly had a panic attack.
My heart was racing at 145 bpm, I couldn’t breathe properly, felt dizzy, like I was choking, and had this terrifying fear that I was dying.

I rushed to the ER  they ran tests and told me I was completely fine physically.

For the first couple of weeks, the panic attacks kept coming back. But when they started to fade, something else showed up: intrusive thoughts.
Now, whenever I hear or read something, my mind latches onto it and won’t let go, even if it has nothing to do with me. I started fearing the idea of “going crazy.” Even the word “suicide” got stuck in my head for over a week, even though I have no connection to it at all.

These thoughts don’t reflect who I really am, but they leave me feeling lost, empty, and scared. I try to cope I pray, I go outside, I write down what I feel  but deep down, I’m still struggling.

Doctors keep telling me I’m healthy, but mentally I feel like I’m just existing, not really living.

If anyone here has gone through panic attacks, intrusive thoughts, or the fear of losing yourself please share how you got through it.

Assuming because the main portion was decanting. There was some great feedback in that thread so wanted to follow up. 

Ended up opening the 2014 about 4 hours before my buddy and his wife arrived. Had a sip and decided to recork. It's a big wine for sure but wasn't overly tight where I felt it needed a lot of time. The Pax on the other hand definitely needed to breath a little and let some funk blow off. 

We started with the Syrah and some bruschetta and it was fantastic. Expectedly different from a lot of the big inky dark Syrahs (which I love as well). Lots of fruit on the nose, berries, almost jammy but not quite. And on the palate it switches up, Tart blackberry, very bright, herbs, peppery, with a good amount of funky. Very excited to grab some more bottles. It's a syrah that I feel would be perfect to chill just a little and sit outside on a hot summer evening and crush. Complex, big, and bright at the same time. 

Opened the 2014 about for about an hour and a half before we drank and let it open up, put it back in the bottle and decanted the 2004 for about an hour. We had both together with a cacio e pepe. Both were great, the tannins on the 2004 felt they had totally integrated, especially compared to the big 2014. 2004 still had lots of fruit and secondary more earthy notes starting to show. Both showed Howell Mountain dark fruits and graphite minerality. If you love Howell Mountain wines, you'll love these. The tannins on the 2014 are finer than most Napa cabs I've had around the same age. It was great to see a wine with approachable tannins young and that they still hold the 2004 together. 

Have about a glass left of the 2014 I'll be finishing tonight, looking forward to see how it is after a day.

# Best Bible Verses About home:⁣ Your 2025 Guide

The concept of ""home"" transcends mere physical ⁢structures; it⁤ represents a haven, ‍a place of⁢ belonging, and a foundation for faith and family.​ In⁣ 2025, as‌ we navigate ⁢increasingly complex and interconnected lives, the timeless⁤ wisdom of the Bible offers profound insights into creating a home rooted in love, peace, and ⁢spiritual nourishment. This guide explores some of the most impactful Bible verses about home, providing context and practical application for modern living. Whether you are establishing a new residence, seeking to ⁤strengthen existing family⁣ bonds, or simply yearning ⁣for a more meaningful living space, these verses ⁤offer⁢ guidance and ‍inspiration for building a⁣ truly blessed home.

## Key Features Analysis

The following verses offer a ⁤multifaceted viewpoint on what constitutes a‍ God-honoring home. They ‍emphasize the importance of wisdom,‌ love, diligence,⁢ and a welcoming spirit, all essential components in building a strong and spiritually vibrant household.

**Proverbs 24:3-4: “By wisdom a house is built, and ​through understanding ​it ⁢is established; through knowledge its rooms ‍are filled with rare and stunning treasures.”**

This verse highlights the‍ importance of wisdom, understanding, and ⁢knowledge‌ in creating a thriving ‍home. Building a home is not merely ‍about constructing walls and a roof; it involves cultivating an surroundings where love, respect, and spiritual growth flourish. Wisdom guides the decisions and actions within the home,‍ while understanding ‌fosters empathy and compassion among family members. Knowledge, in ​the context of this ⁢verse, encompasses not only worldly knowledge ⁣but ‍also spiritual insights that enrich the lives of those who dwell within.

**proverbs 14:1: “The wise ​woman builds her house, but with her own hands the foolish one tears hers⁢ down.”**

This proverb emphasizes the proactive role of individuals, ‍especially women in the‌ context of this verse, in ⁣shaping ​the atmosphere and well-being of their homes.⁣ A wise woman ⁤invests her time and energy in nurturing her family, creating a safe and loving environment, and upholding values that ⁣strengthen the household. Conversely,a foolish woman's actions,whether through neglect,selfishness,or destructive behavior can undermine ⁣the foundation of her home,leading to discord and instability.

**Psalm 127:1: “Unless⁣ the Lord builds‍ the house,⁤ its builders ‍labor in ⁢vain. Unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchmen stand guard in vain.”**

This ⁢verse acknowledges the ultimate sovereignty of ‍God in all ‍aspects of life, ​including the building of a home. While human effort⁣ and planning ‍are essential, they are ultimately fruitless without God's blessing and guidance. This verse serves as a reminder to seek God's will​ in all endeavors related to the home, from​ choosing a location to making⁤ financial⁣ decisions to nurturing relationships. ⁣It‍ underscores ​the ⁣importance of relying on God's grace and trusting in His provision.

**Hebrews 13:2: ⁤""Do not forget to show hospitality‌ to ⁤strangers,for by so doing some people⁣ have shown⁢ hospitality​ to angels without knowing it.""**

This verse encourages a welcoming spirit within the ⁤home, extending hospitality ‌not only⁣ to‌ friends and family but also to strangers. Hospitality reflects⁤ the love of Christ and creates opportunities⁣ for connection⁤ and blessing. Opening one's home to others can lead to unexpected encounters and enrich the lives ⁣of ‍both the⁣ host and the guest. This verse reminds ​us that extending kindness and generosity to others is a way of honoring God and possibly encountering blessings‍ beyond our comprehension.

**Proverbs 31:27: ""She watches over the affairs of⁤ her household⁢ and ‍does not​ eat the bread of idleness.""**

This verse, part of the description of the ""woman of noble character,"" highlights‍ the importance of diligence⁢ and‍ attentiveness in caring for the ‌home. A godly woman ⁢is⁤ actively involved in managing ‌the practical aspects of her household, ensuring that the needs⁢ of⁣ her family are met. She is not idle or wasteful‍ but rather diligent and resourceful in ‍her efforts to create a comfortable and nurturing environment. This verse emphasizes the value‍ of hard work and responsibility in maintaining a ⁤well-functioning and harmonious home.

## Core​ Benefits

These verses provide a framework for⁣ creating a home that is not only physically comfortable‍ but⁣ also spiritually enriching.​ By implementing ​these principles, individuals and ‍families can experience ‍a deeper sense⁣ of peace, purpose, ⁣and connection.

**Cultivating a Peaceful⁣ Atmosphere:** Rooting your home in wisdom and understanding, as emphasized in Proverbs 24:3-4, leads to a more peaceful atmosphere. Disputes are handled with empathy and⁤ clear-headedness. A ⁤home that fosters these qualities​ becomes a refuge from⁢ the pressures of​ the outside world, a ​haven where family members can find rest and emotional​ support.

**Strengthening Family Bonds:** Hospitality, as encouraged in Hebrews 13:2, plays a⁤ crucial role ⁢in connecting and strengthening‌ family bonds. Regularly welcoming loved ones and⁤ friends into your home ⁣creates opportunities for shared experiences,meaningful conversations,and‍ the building of lasting memories. ⁤These shared moments reinforce familial ⁢ties and foster a sense of belonging and community.

**nurturing Spiritual Growth:** Recognizing ‍God's role​ in building the home, as highlighted in Psalm 127:1, fosters a spirit of prayer and dependence on‌ Him. Families can actively cultivate spiritual growth by incorporating Bible reading,prayer,and faith-based discussions into‍ their daily lives.This creates a ⁣strong spiritual foundation that sustains the family​ through challenges and⁢ strengthens⁣ their relationship with‍ God.

## FAQs Section

**How can I practically Apply Proverbs ​24:3-4 in my home?**

Start by prioritizing thoughtful decision-making. Before major purchases or changes,discuss them as a ⁤family,exploring‌ the potential impact and benefits. Cultivate shared ⁢interests and learning opportunities within ⁣the home ⁣by reading ‍together, exploring new hobbies, or engaging in meaningful conversations.

**What are Some Practical Ways to Show Hospitality (Hebrews ⁢13:2) in⁢ a Busy Modern Life?**

Hospitality doesn't have to be elaborate. Simple ⁣gestures like inviting a neighbor ‍for coffee, offering ⁣a meal to someone in need, or ‌hosting⁣ a small gathering can make⁤ a big difference. ​Focus on creating a welcoming‍ and ⁢relaxed atmosphere ⁣where ⁤guests feel comfortable and‍ valued.

**How‍ do I ensure that the Lord is building ⁢my house (Psalm 127:1)?**

Make prayer and seeking God's guidance a central part of ‍your family life. Pray together as a family, asking for wisdom and direction in all ‍decisions related to your home.Regularly read and ⁣discuss the Bible to gain ⁤insights into God's will and apply‍ his principles to your daily lives.

1msttcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1msttcn/explore_the_best_streaming_media_player/,Explore the Best Streaming Media Player BrightSign XT244 and See Why,"The BrightSign XT244 instantly stood out to me when I first got my hands on it. As someone who frequently works with high-definition video content, I was intrigued by the promise of 4K Dolby Vision support and dual video decode capability. Based on my daily interactions with streaming media players, I can confidently say this device is more than just a flashy name. However, there are a few nuances worth examining depending on what you're looking for in a media player.

**Sleek Design and Functionality**

The build of the BrightSign XT244 surprised me with its clean, minimalist look and compact size. Measuring at 11.33 x 9.68 x 2.83 inches, it doesn’t take up much space on my desk or media rack. It feels sturdy enough to handle some wear and tear, which is particularly handy if you’re like me and move devices around often. But while I appreciated the streamlined design, the understated aesthetics might not scream ""premium"" to everyone. Still, the focus here seems to be on performance over appearances, and honestly, I’d take that any day.

**Intuitive Setup and Configuration**

Getting this device up and running took me less time than assembling my morning coffee. It includes a Standard I/O Package and Power over Ethernet (PoE+), which means fewer cables cluttering the setup. I loved the PoE+ support since it doubles as a power source and network connection. No need to hunt for extra outlets, which, if you're living in a cable jungle like I am, is a rare luxury. However, it does assume you already have a PoE-enabled switch or injector, so there’s a potential additional cost right there.

**Outstanding Display Capabilities**

The true highlight of this media player is its ability to support 4K Dolby Vision, and I cannot tell you how satisfying it is to see content rendered with such vibrancy and detail. During testing sessions, I could easily decode dual video streams in 1080p, and the transitions were flawless. Whether it’s a fast-paced sports reel or slow-burning cinematic visuals, this player handles it beautifully. There’s no noticeable lag, and everything looks crisp even on larger screens. If visuals are your priority, this is where the device shines brightest.

**Check BrightSign XT244 price on Amazon.**

**Enterprise-Grade HTML5 Player**

The additional enterprise HTML5 player functionality made handling more interactive and complex HTML projects much easier. I played around with a couple of test files for digital signage, and I was impressed by the smoothness of playback. It’s no wonder this device is marketed in part for businesses, but it also serves creative professions exceptionally well. I imagine this would be incredible in a retail or event environment where robust customization is needed.

**Key Benefits**

- PoE+ capability minimizes cable clutter.
- Exceptional 4K Dolby Vision display quality.
- Dual video decode capability for multitasking.
- Compact yet sturdy design ideal for both personal and professional setups.

**Limitations**

- Requires a PoE-enabled switch or injector for optimal functionality.
- Lacks in-built Wi-Fi, which could be a downside for wireless users.
- A bit pricier compared to basic media players, which might deter casual users.

**Competing Products**

In the world of streaming devices, there’s tough competition, and the BrightSign XT244 holds its own against options like the Apple TV 4K and Nvidia Shield. The Apple TV 4K offers similar Dolby Vision but lacks dual decode functionality. Meanwhile, the Nvidia Shield is a strong contender with fantastic gaming support, though it isn’t as tailored toward enterprise-level HTML5 content. For someone needing professional-grade customization and high-quality playback, this player edges ahead.

**Quality for Price**

If you’re looking at the cost-to-feature ratio, the BrightSign XT244 justifies its price tag for those who need high-end performance, whether that’s for personal use or business applications. While it might feel like an overinvestment for casual streaming enthusiasts, those working with 4K videos or digital signage will see the value. This device reflects quality engineering, and it feels like it was crafted for sustained use in demanding environments.

My life is full  - successful career, great kids, friends, hobbies - but what’s missing is connection. The kind of chemistry where time disappears, laughter is easy, and one kiss says everything.

I’m busy with my kids, and I stay active (running, lifting, hiking), love exploring new places, and won’t say no to coffee, good food, or a spontaneous trip. When I slow down, you’ll find me reading or binging Netflix. I’ve also got a few adventurous sides… the kind that are a lot more fun to discover together. 😏

What I’m looking for: a woman who’s smart, confident, and has built her own full life - but still has room and desire for passion, fun, and something real. Chemistry matters, but so does depth. Late-night conversations, weekend adventures, and a steady partnership underneath it all.

1mstrd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MOVA_robotvacuum/comments/1mstrd0/still_not_perfect_but_my_dog_and_i_think_the_mova/,"Still Not Perfect, but My Dog and I Think the MOVA V50 Is Close: My Thoughts/semi-review After 10,000 ft² (~1,000 m²) Cleaned","If you’ve got a fluffy friend, you know the unspoken Faustian bargain: unconditional love in exchange for a home permanently blanketed in fur—and a daily lake of drool waiting in the places where you least expect, just for you to step in. Most robot vacuums promise barefoot-friendly floors, but I’ve been burned before. My old budget bot had to run twice a day just to keep up with my long-haired corgi, or its dustbin would clog with fur. So when MOVA sent me their new V50 Ultra as part of their Reddit collaboration program, I wasn’t expecting it to be much better. I did not receive any money from this collaboration.

# Receiving the MOVA V50 Ultra: 

I received the V50 Ultra in a fairly nondescript cardboard box, sealed with MOVA-branded tape. Inside was the main retail box, also covered in MOVA logos. It’s on the heavier side, so handle with care—I found it a bit awkward to lift, even with the cut-out handles, as the box is quite wide. Sliding the main box out of the outer protective box took a bit of effort.

[A photo of the MOVA V50 Ultra's main box](https://preview.redd.it/suyrslcv85if1.png?width=4284&format=png&auto=webp&s=038586383a6a0eec69f580eafb48d119b0f70ede)

On the box, MOVA proudly lists all the bells and whistles:

* **DuoSolution tank**: You can add a pet odor-neutralizing solution to tackle that dreaded pet funk, along with a general floor detergent in a separate, larger tank. The detergent mixes with water as it fills the robot’s internal tank for regular mopping, while the deodorizing solution is used specifically to clean the mops.
* **StepMaster climbing**: can clear small steps up to 6cm total—specifically, 4.2cm followed by 1.8cm.
* **24,000Pa suction**: a wildly high number that beats the Dreame X50 on paper, putting it on par with even some cordless vacuum cleaners.
* **JetSpray DryBoard**: uses 20 high-pressure jets to clean the mops and washboard.
* **Edge cleaning**: side brush and mop can extend to reach corners and along walls.
* **FlexiPress mop**: tilts up to 5° for more even pressure on uneven floors, spins at up to 260 RPM with 8N of pressure.
* **80°C (176°F) mop washing**: hot water mop rinse to lift grease from the mops.
* **OmniDry system**: dries the mops in as little as an hour, .and fully dries the dustbin and dustbag in about three

But as you might already know, **I don’t care much for spec sheets alone**. I care about what actually adds value to autonomy or cleaning performance in the real world. So here are my surface-level first impressions—and a closer look at whether these features actually live up to the claims. 

**Unpacking it:**

The packaging was solid and well-protected. Aside from some minor dents and cosmetic scuffs on the plain outer box (doing its job, really), everything inside arrived intact. The double-boxed design used thick, durable cardboard throughout. No complaints there—though I do wish the unboxing experience felt a bit more premium or luxurious for a flagship device.

[The accessory kit is packed inside the main box and is the first thing you see when opening the box](https://preview.redd.it/9gnpp29795if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bab79a92551eb02606185ce5961203f94a1b0cbc)

Right at the top of the main box is the oversized accessory kit—and it’s *stacked*. You get:

* **Twelve extra mops** (enough for six replacements)
* **1L of MOVA floor detergent** (the detergent tank holds up to 400mL, so this covers over two full refills)
* **200mL pet odor-neutralizing solution** (exactly one full fill of the B tank)
* **Three spare dust bags**
* **Three extra filters** (rated for 450 vacuuming hours total)
* **Two side brush replacements** (designed for easy swapping every 200 hours with a screwdriver)
* **A spare pair of double anti-tangle main brushes** (rated for 300 vacuuming hours; note: replacing them takes a surprising amount of force to pull out and snap back in, with careful alignment of the hexagonal rods and brush holes)

[Look at all the accessories!](https://preview.redd.it/infdrbys95if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21979f38d4d280cae296152779eae2d0be2264e0)

Frankly, this is one of the most generous accessory kits I’ve seen bundled with any robot vacuum—especially in this price range. Most brands don’t even include a single bottle of detergent, even after charging this much. 

[From top to bottom, the base station's power cable bundled up, the two FlexiPress mop pad holders with mop pads attached, and the base station's removable ramp](https://preview.redd.it/321r2cr7k5if1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=02533e82cfbcb377e96123e98af3a32f15afa973)

Beneath the accessory kit is a smaller side box on the left, containing the dock’s detachable ramp (handy for cleaning), the power cable, and the robot’s mop pads pre-attached to the magnetic FlexiPress holders. Once that’s out of the way, you’ll see the main robot box with a sturdy built-in plastic handle for easy lifting. Under that, the dock itself is neatly packed inside a protective plastic. 

**Build quality:** 

[The MOVA V50 Ultra is in its base station on the left of my old robot vacuum in its dock. The MOVA's base station is noticeably shorter.](https://preview.redd.it/f88vnh2gk5if1.jpg?width=5160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a16bdebf3c7157998f1eb5c81c3432b375e21a0a)

The MOVA V50 Ultra Complete and its base station feel impressively well-built. While mostly plastic, the construction is sturdy and durable. The magnetic top cover snaps on securely—no issues with weak magnets or misalignment. The brushes also feel solid and well-made. I’m not a fan of the glossy plastic finish, though; it’s a magnet for fingerprints and, unsurprisingly, fur. The dustbin is made from hard plastic and took a hit when I accidentally dropped it, leaving a scuffed white mark. So yes, it’s tough, but not invincible.

**Setting up the robot:**

To test ease of use, I handed the setup over to the most technologically challenged family member—and they had no trouble. Pairing the robot was simple, and mapping was surprisingly quick. Impressively, the robot managed to escape my shower’s 3cm threshold using its secondary wheels, part of MOVA’s so-called StepMaster system. Older robots would have gotten stuck in there during mapping. I actually expected to configure this manually in the app, but the robot automatically recognized the threshold as passable and added it to the map. Nice.

It also recognized that my kitchen cabinets had just enough clearance for it to duck under by retracting its LIDAR, and marked the area as low-clearance. That said, it struggled with the diagonal section of my kitchen counter, which I had to manually fix. It also mislabeled my bedroom as a kitchen and didn’t quite get the orientation of the wooden floorboards right—but otherwise, room partitioning and labeling were fairly accurate.

My family member noted a bit of a learning curve when customizing room partitions, but once they figured it out, setup was smooth. I do wish there were an option to label a space as an “entryway” in the rooms you can choose from, but fortunately, you can rename any room however you like.

As for ultrasonic carpet detection, it correctly identified the office rug and most of the carpet under the coffee table, though the detection was patchy and required me to manually define that area. If you have fully carpeted rooms, you can mark them as such—but it takes a bit of digging through the settings.

[The DuoSolution Tank and the pet odor solution is pictured together with the B tank made to be filled with the pet odor solution](https://preview.redd.it/qkxsswe8c5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f2ecfb097b13b8eb83ec26e376f05ce03e408bc)

After filling the DuoSolution tank with both the general detergent and the pet odor-neutralizing solution, and topping up the clean water tank, it was time to let the robot earn its keep. I didn’t actually have high hopes—so I ran my old robot a day prior to vacuum and mop first, just in case.

I then ran the V50 Ultra in CleanGenius vacuum mode, followed by deep cleaning mop mode. I wanted to see if it was a CleanGenius… or a CleanDummy.

To my surprise, the kitchen—normally coated in a fine layer of grease that required two passes from my old robot—was squeaky clean in just one. The wooden floors were also noticeably softer and smoother to walk on after just a single pass.

When I pulled out the dirty water tank, the results were obvious: not only was the water noticeably darker than what my old robot usually picked up, but there was a visible layer of grease floating on top. The tank was greasy enough that I had to wash it with a sponge and dish soap—suggesting the hot water mop washing was *actually doing its job* and lifting grease off the mops effectively.

I attribute this improved mopping performance to a few things. 

* **More pressure for a deeper scrub**: the V50 Ultra mops with 8N of downward pressure, which really helps on hard floors. 
* **The mops hug the floor better**: The FlexiPress system also keeps mop pressure more evenly applied across uneven surfaces, thanks to its ability to tilt up to 5 degrees and adjust vertically by a few millimeters—something my old robot always struggled with. 
* **Automatic detergent mixing**: The robot also automatically mixes detergent with water before mopping, so it’s not just wiping with plain water. 
* **Faster mop spinning**: the mops can spin up to 260rpm, and when I ran it in CleanGenius deep clean mode, the mopping was noticeably louder, suggesting it was spinning faster than the regular 180rpm. 
* **Better synergy**: I suspect the improved vacuuming internals are helping remove more invisible dust, which gives the mops a clearer path to scrub deeper grime.

I do wish the CleanGenius icon gave more insight into what it’s doing, other than just vaguely telling me “CleanGenius is cleaning.”

[The MOVA V50 Ultra cleaning under my kitchen cabinets with its LIDAR tower retracted](https://preview.redd.it/znnvsg1ub5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df3c3f14b148da5f08a461d166e293501f982cb8)

For under-the-counter cleaning in the kitchen, the robot lowered its lidar and hugged the edges appropriately. Good bot. I’ve heard some other V50 Ultras get less efficient when their lidar retracts, but I haven’t seen that myself. I’d need a giant balsa wood obstacle course to test that properly.

[The fur in the dustbin is compressed to one end of the dustbin so it can collect as much fur as possible](https://preview.redd.it/c0w6kulpi5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=657daaaef5dd697f09cec71ce2e289fc5668ad75)

The dustbin tells the whole story. Compared to my old robot, fur was visibly compressed, making far better use of the bin space—credit to MOVA’s hair compression feature. The base station even blows air through the filter during the auto-empty cycle, clearing out the clingy dust bunnies that used to get stuck in the pleats. The result? I went from smacking the filter against the trash can every night to cleaning it maybe once every two weeks.

[No hair or fur was stuck around the axles of the omnidirectional wheel.](https://preview.redd.it/31v3fwa7j5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=641f69fc47f4683c7d66dfd1424a6147e43be86b)

[No fur was tangled on the dual TroboWave brushes, with fur clinging to the bristles](https://preview.redd.it/qummmixdj5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df60ac2e947908e254cd0f0f4a3bb63f55fc8da7)

[Upon closer insepction, the only the brush with bristles has some fur with it but it is not tangled.](https://preview.redd.it/bejzg32jj5if1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50b9eb4a5b5c899908b35b1f56cde99b3b658311)

[Only a few strands of fur remain in the brush compartment after the brushes are removed. ](https://preview.redd.it/1oi3zr7nj5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e733e4557c82eac1b15497ee6bc0bf942052a482)

And the anti-tangle claims? Not just marketing. Even waist-length hair—longer than the advertised 11.8” (30 cm) limit—didn’t tangle in the TroboWave™ dual brushes, the side brush, or the omnidirectional wheel. It was also brilliant on carpets, where the dual-brush system agitated and lifted my dog’s fur far more effectively than my old single-brush bot ever managed.

My family, who all work from home, immediately noticed how quiet it was. While mopping at 180 rpm, it was nearly silent. During a vacuum run, I measured it at a conversation-friendly 55–60 dB—noticeable, but never disruptive.

# The Coffee Granule Test

To push beyond marketing specs, I simulated a tough mess using freeze-dried coffee—a mix of large granules and fine powder. I set the robot to CleanGenius mode with “large particle boost” enabled.

[The original spill of instant coffee powder](https://preview.redd.it/i7hc699xf5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb983bb958dea075e6373402e69c53295a80d3fe)

[After the second pass, no instant coffee was left behind](https://preview.redd.it/2ngzj89xf5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b11d3febede717b8b481c271148829ddb1cde60)

What followed was a masterclass in intelligent cleaning. The robot:

* Correctly identified the spill and its size, marked it on the app, and slowed its approach.
* Increased suction while reducing the side brush speed to gently sweep granules inward.
* Lifted the side brush entirely when crossing the main spill to prevent scattering.
* Made two slow, methodical passes in perpendicular directions, creating a grid-like pattern.

After the first pass, every large granule was gone. After the second, so was the fine coffee dust. A perfect pickup.

MOVA claims its pet odor neutralizing solution really works, so I put it to the test. I turned on high-frequency mode, which uses the solution every time it washes the mops, to tackle that classic “wet dog” smell after my pup’s adventures in the grass. After just one vacuum first and then mop cycle, the only place I could smell the dog was… well, on the dog himself. Floors? Fresh and odor-free. 

**AI Obstacle Avoidance**

I tested the robot in a chaotic environment littered with obstacles: charging cables on the floor, a camera tripod with legs low enough to ride up, chairs with just enough clearance to be a trap, and dog toys everywhere. My old robot would have been instantly stuck thanks to my dog, who loves to sploot right in the middle of the hallway. But the MOVA navigated everything without getting stuck once.

What impressed me most was watching its adaptive AI learn in real time. On day one, it clumsily tried to climb the tripod legs. By day two, it was more cautious, riding up on them only about half the time. On day three, it had figured it out completely and cleaned neatly along the legs without mounting them at all.

**OmniDry: Mop and Dustbin Drying**

MOVA also touts its OmniDry system, which uses warm air to dry the mops, the internal washboard, and even the dustbin and dustbag to prevent mildew and odors. MOVA doesn’t list an official drying temperature, but a similar feature on another premium robot by its parent Dreame uses 122°F (50°C) air.

Even at 86% humidity, the system dried the mops and washboard in just one hour on “Quick Dry.” To test the dustbin drying, I dampened some dog fur, put it in the dustbag, and ran a three-hour drying cycle — after which the fur felt completely dry.

Theoretically, this thorough drying should help stop mold and odor growth. It’s only been about 1,000 m² (\~10,000 ft²) of cleaning so far, so it’s too early to confirm long-term benefits, but the initial signs look very promising

**Self-Cleaning & Maintenance**

The base station does a solid job cutting down on daily chores, though it’s not completely hands-off. The auto-empty cycle is strong enough to clear fine dust from the filter’s pleats, but I did notice a few strands of my dog’s fur stubbornly clinging to the filter’s rubber seal.

[The JetSpray Dryboard, as pictured, was able to keep itself rather clean with oly a few stray strands of fur remaining on the mop washboard and no visible grime stuck to any nooks and crannies. ](https://preview.redd.it/ylldb4lhe5if1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58a820016e8e1e640db55f04426f3fbb79d6867a)

The mop washing system is a huge step up from my old robot, whose washboard was always a magnet for fur and grime. After about 1,000 m² of cleaning, the MOVA’s washboard stayed impressively clean, with all the debris collected neatly in a removable, palm-sized drainage filter that’s easy to rinse under the tap.

[Despite keeping the mop washboard relatively clean, fine dust and dirt builds up under the drainage filter over time as shown here.](https://preview.redd.it/e3sabf7yc5if1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af7e4220d12f800e7fb91d0069acf2ca2b61e347)

That said, a fine layer of sludge does build up over time in the tray beneath the filter. Since the washboard assembly itself isn’t removable, you have to get down on your hands and knees to clean that part manually. I wish the robot either cleaned this area automatically or had a removable tray for easier maintenance.

All up, this makes a night-and-day difference in my daily routine.

With my old robot, my daily maintenance checklist looked like this:

* Tapping dust out of the filter
* Picking trapped fur off the washboard
* Rescuing it from cables that it tried to chew or the tripod it kept trying to climb

Now, with the MOVA, my main tasks are simply refilling the clean water tank and emptying the dirty one. The robot and base station stay so much cleaner that a proper hands-on clean is only needed every few weeks—definitely not every single day.

**Battery Life & Charging**

To gauge real-world battery efficiency, I ran the robot on customized cleaning cycles with consistent settings.

The results weren’t quite as impressive as I’d hoped they'd be, as it has a battery capacity of 6400mAh. On a standard vacuuming run, it cleaned just under 1 m² (\~10.5 ft²) per 1% of battery used. When mopping, efficiency more than doubled, covering over 2 m² (\~22.3 ft²) per percentage point consumed.

In practice, after a full CleanGenius vacuum cycle followed by a mop run over my entire home, the robot typically consumes about 60% of its battery per cleaning session. In contrast, my old robot, with a smaller 5200 mAh battery, used around 40% for the same vacuum-then-mop routine.

For larger homes of around 100 m² (\~1,075 ft²) or more, the “resume cleaning” feature is necessary, letting the robot return to its base to recharge before it resumes cleaning.

Charging speeds are solid as well: it charges rapidly at roughly 1% per minute until hitting 20%, then slows to about 0.5% per minute to preserve battery health over time. You can also protect the battery's long-term health by setting a charge limit in the app, with options for 80%, 90%, or a full 100%.

# Pros & Cons

**Pros:** Very quiet, great with handling a lot of fur and hair, mops quite well and quietly, hot mop washing effectively lifts grease from the mops, pretty hands off, a smaller and more squat base station compared to some others, the customization for your robot is plentiful, the charging limit is a step forward in ensuring the longetivity of your robot’s battery, charges pretty quick

**Cons:** not a fan of the glossy white plastic used as it’s a fingerprint magnet, you’d still need to manually clean the dirt and dust that builds up at the mop washboard’s drainage area, there is no way to manually customize how fast the mop spins as the mops only speed up on CleanGenius deep cleaning mode or when stain detection is turned on, slightly smaller water tanks of a 1 gallon clean water tank and a 0.9 dirty water tank compared to similarly priced options on the market (this is a tradeoff if you prefer a smaller base station) do mean more frequently refilling, the app’s near unlimited customization makes the UI a bit cluttered and requires a learning curve for those not as tech snazzy, the battery life is actually strangely short. 

# TLDR:

**Get it if:**

* You want a robot that’ll reliably dodge cables and other things that could trip up dumb bots, so you won’t need to rescue it all the time. 
* You have a pet that sheds a lot and/or stinks a lot, making the floors stinky despite your best attempts to coax it into having a bath. 
* Your home has long hair that you and other family members are shedding. 
* You want a quiet robot that happily zips around 
* Your home has more hard floors than carpet. 
* You have thresholds in your home, like sliding door frames, and thresholds in different rooms, like the bathroom or the kitchen. 

**Don’t get it if:**

* Your home is mostly carpet (vacuuming only robots are better suited)
* You want a robot that can be later plumbed into your laundry water lines. 
* You want it to clean under places with a clearance of 8.9cm or lower. 
* You want MO from Wall-E to say foreign contaminant every time it starts cleaning.  
* A totally hands-free robot vacuum that requires absolutely no maintenance (unless you were smart enough to tell your future self that to deliver one to you with a Time Machine)

I'm happy to answer any questions you have about this robot or my experience in the comments below! Stay tuned for my in-depth review in a few weeks, where I'll test its long-term autonomy to see how it truly holds up with minimal maintenance—just refilling and emptying the tanks!

**Can I bake with hazelnut creamers?**

1mstojl,https://www.reddit.com/r/DailyEffectivePrayer/comments/1mstojl/how_to_turn_daily_prayer_into_a_life_you_cant/,How to Turn Daily Prayer Into a Life You Can’t Stop Thanking God For,"# A Moment of Awakening

I still remember it clear as day. I was in the kitchen before sunrise, clutching coffee like it was my lifeline, my mind buzzing with “what ifs” and “what now’s.” Out of pure exhaustion I muttered, “God, I’m tired.” And for some reason, before I even thought about it, I added, “Thank You… for just being here.” That little crack of gratitude felt like opening a window in a stuffy room. Suddenly prayer didn’t feel like duty anymore. It felt like someone turned the lights on inside me.

# Why Daily Prayer with Gratitude Matters

# Gratitude Is More Than a Reaction

Gratitude isn’t just saying “thanks” when life hands you something pretty. It’s choosing to see differently when nothing changes. It’s like putting on glasses that finally bring things into focus. Same world. Same mess. But you see God in it.

# Anchoring Ourselves When Life’s Tough

Nobody needs me to say life’s hard, you already know that. The trick is learning you can be drowning in stress and still whisper a thank You. Jesus did. Even when His closest friends bailed and His heart was breaking, He gave thanks. Gratitude isn’t denial. It’s saying, “God, I trust You even here, even now.”

# Building a Prayer Rhythm That Cultivates “Thank God” Living

# Start With Awareness—Not Perfection

I started small. Three things every morning. Some days it was laughably tiny... “the coffee’s hot, the floor’s not sticky, I didn’t burn the toast.” But over time, something shifted. Gratitude stopped being a list. It became my heartbeat. And that heartbeat carried me through the ugliest days.

# Embrace Bold, Heartfelt Prayer

Let’s be real: some of our prayers sound like shopping lists. “God, bless this, fix that, keep me safe.” Nothing wrong with that, but sometimes you’ve got to risk honesty. Bold prayers shake us awake. I’ve blurted things out like, “Search me, God. Even the parts I don’t want to see.” Awkward? Yes. Necessary? Absolutely.

# Real-Life Stories of Transformation

# From Anxiety to Attitude Shift

A friend of mine was drowning in a work slump. Instead of spiraling, he scribbled down the little good things—his dog, a quiet sunrise, the fact he had breath in her lungs. Weeks later, his posture changed. Not the job, his heart.

# A Church Community’s Daily Pulse

In my small group, someone started every prayer with one line: “Thank You, Lord.” That tiny ritual caught on. Before long, even the shy ones were opening up about fears, doubts, gratitude... sometimes all in the same breath. Gratitude set the tone.

# Bold Prayer, Real Change

Another friend once prayed, “God, tear down whatever’s holding me back.” Dangerous words. Within months, God stripped away some comfortable crutches. It wasn’t easy, but he grew like crazy, inside and out.

# Practical Steps Toward a Thankful Prayer Life

* Jot down one clumsy thank You in the morning. Doesn’t matter if it’s profound.
* Slip in a bold ask—something that scares you a little.
* Keep going when it feels boring. Trust me, habits become lifelines.
* Tell someone. Gratitude spreads faster when spoken.
* Once a week, look back. What shifted? Even if nothing “big” happened, notice where God met you.

# On Reflection

I’ll be honest. I stumbled into gratitude when I was running on empty in ministry. I was preaching, teaching, encouraging—while quietly withering inside. Whispering “thank You, even when I don’t feel You” saved me. It pulled me out of burnout and back into joy. Gratitude reminded me ministry isn’t about strategies or growth charts. It’s about God and people. And “thank You” is oxygen for both.

# A Brief Aside

You’ve seen those gratitude challenges online, right? Cute little lists, hashtags, smiling selfies. Nothing wrong with that. But Christian gratitude? It’s deeper. It’s not a filter. It’s an anchor. And anchors don’t get likes, but they keep you steady when storms rip through.

# Final Thoughts

So here’s my nudge: what if prayer wasn’t a chore, but a lifeline? What if the first words out of your mouth tomorrow were a simple, messy thank You? Try it. Thank Him for the bed you rolled out of or the breath in your chest. See how it shifts your day. Don’t overthink it. Just start. And if something sparks, share it with someone else. Gratitude’s contagious and when prayer and gratitude collide, you’ll find yourself thanking God when you least expect it.

It is the only one for miles unless I want to add another 20 minutes to my commute. I won’t say where because I don’t wanna dox myself but it is just awful.  

The speaker is horrendous so you can never hear them and they can’t hear you. It’s been like that for years. 

The staff are all family members of the owner so they give no f*%#s…. 

They never put the order in the screen so you can’t confirm it. They always mess up my extremely simple iced coffee order: less base… that’s it. That’s all I ask for. I’ll get extra base, I’ll get no base, I’ll get extra ice, I’ll get extra cream…. Always wrong. I’ve even asked “how do you want me to order this to make it easier to understand. Maybe saying “less base” is confusing. She straight up told me that’s the best way to order it. “Half sweet” confuses people, “half sugar” confuses them cause they think they should add actual sugar instead of cane syrup base… 

Still mess it up almost every time. 

And when they have both lanes open they don’t alternate… they’ll put like 7 cars through from one lane and then start taking the other one. It’s infuriating if you make the wrong choice. 

They were *this* close to having a flawless order until I bit into my “Boston Cream” and found… no cream. 

Close but no cigar. 

I wish I could name and shame this location but I won’t. Just wanna vent. Is this a typical Tim Hortons experience now? The other locations in my town seem to be much better in my anecdotal experience but like I said 9 days out of 10 this is the only one I can go to… and sadly I still enjoy my Timmies.

1mstmd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheReliableToolbox/comments/1mstmd6/reveal_why_the_hakko_fr301_soldering_iron_review/,Reveal why the Hakko FR-301 soldering iron review stands out for professionals!,"The FR-301 Portable Desoldering Tool, specifically by Hakko, caught my attention when I was tasked with repairing an old, stubborn PCB last week. Designed for industrial use, the tool was marketed as a heavy-duty, reliable solution for desoldering tasks. Being someone who regularly tinkers with electronics and soldering jobs, I was eager to test it out. My experience with it has been largely positive, but there are also a few quirks worth noting.

**Ease of Use and Practical Design**  
From the moment I unboxed the product, the pencil-style design stood out. It felt ergonomic, fitting comfortably in my hand without causing strain even during prolonged sessions. The lightweight build, at just three pounds, is a definite plus, as lugging around heavier ones during projects can be tiresome. The tool comes packed with thoughtful additions like a simple iron holder, a carrying case, and interchangeable nozzles, which added to its appeal. The portability reminded me of a time I had to desolder components outdoors—this would have been the perfect solution.

**Performance That Packs a Punch**  
I tested this corded electric-powered tool on both small and large solder joints, and it handled each with finesse, thanks to its impressive 98-wattage. Its ceramic burner-type head is another highlight, delivering consistent heat without fluctuations. The upper temperature rating goes up to 500°C, which meant I didn’t have to worry about less effective desoldering on tougher spots. Removing solder melded over time was surprisingly smooth, especially when I worked on removing capacitors from a motherboard. Still, users performing the same task more frequently may notice its occasional struggle with thicker layers.

[Check Hakko FR-301 price on Amazon.](https://powertools4u.com/p/b07bksllg9/)

**Heavy-Duty Build Quality**  
Being designed for industrial-grade work, it lives up to its “heavy-duty” label. The copper material used in its construction adds to its durability, making it feel like a long-term investment rather than a quick fix. I accidentally knocked it off the workbench while getting distracted (seriously, don’t multitask with coffee in hand), and it survived without a scratch—impressive resilience right there.

**Key Benefits**  
- **Effortless portability** with a lightweight and ergonomic design.  
- **Exceptional temperature control**, reaching up to 500°C for versatility.  
- **Durable, heavy-duty build** designed for industrial use.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- **Noise**: The vacuum pump does emit a noticeable sound, which may bother some people during extended use.  
- **Price Point**: It leans toward a premium price range, which might deter casual hobbyists.  

**Safety and Maintenance Features**  
Using this tool reassured me when it came to handling hazardous materials. The tool’s build supports safe operation, and the replaceable nozzles offered a custom approach to reaching hard-to-solder spaces. Maintenance was manageable with easy cleaning of the tips and replacement options readily available. However, it would’ve been nice if a spare filter was included.

**Product Comparisons**  
Comparing it with products like the Weller WES51 Analog Soldering Station or the Engineer SS-02 Solder Sucker, the portable desoldering tool from Hakko undoubtedly delivers superior power and temperature capacity. However, Weller’s tool feels quieter during use and is more budget-friendly, while Engineer’s solder sucker tool stands out for precision in smaller-scale projects. If your intent is heavy-duty industrial use, the FR-301 edges ahead by being far more durable.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
While I can’t quote an exact price here, it’s clear that the investment aligns well with the tool’s capabilities. For those frequently engaging in industrial solder and desoldering tasks, this becomes a worthy candidate because of its sturdy construction and performance range. On the other hand, if you’re just dipping your toes into the soldering universe, there’s a chance the price point may scare you away.

I’m a tad confused and lost as to when I should do one vs the other?

Bitters feel like they have nearly endless opportunities, are shelf stable, and concentrated so I can make a ton of different kinds and experiment.


Obviously I still need syrups for making cocktails, but some flavors feel too niche to make large batches of syrups for (rose, lavender, earl gray/tea, citrus etc.) not to mention not being shelf stable


My current syrup supply is: Rich simple, Rich Demerara, Grenadine, Coffee/Cold Brew, and Earl Gray.


I’d love to be able to have a syrup for everything I might want, but storage and shelf stability are major issues. Making small batches of syrups also feels a bit wasteful and 


What do people usually do for their home bars? What are the syrups and bitters you keep on hand? What about adding benzoate and sorbate to my syrups to make them more shelf stable?


Just looking for help on what flavor/ingredients warrant having a syrup vs making into bitters.

So a few years ago I started to notice “butt sweat”. Whenever I sat for prolonged periods of time, I noticed my underwear would be wet and sometimes it would show up on my pants if the color was light.
I noticed this was worse during anxious moments like college exams or while I was drinking coffee. I didnt think too much of it, I just avoided light color pants and was more aware of when I consumed caffeine.

Little over a year ago I noticed that when I wake up in the mornings my underwear was wet (on the back not the front), there was like a fruity/sweet smell to it and there was like a clear, viscous “fluid” almost gel like substance near my perineum.

I have seen 2 GI Docs. DRE exams were normal, I had a colonoscopy that showed small internal hemorrhoids but not big enough to cause a loose sphincter and than I had manometry done to test my muscles and that was normal as well.

Both Docs and a GI surgeon (seen for the hemorrhoids) are not really sure what my symptom is because it isnt like im stooling on myself and they see nothing on exam that would cause these symptoms.

I havent been able to wear light color pants in years, I have to have my coffee when I know i wont be out in public and i HAVE to shower every morning to clean myself up. 

I’m just looking for any kind of guidance or help on what this could be and how to manage it. Thanks for your help!

It’s based on frameworks + workshops I already sell through my consultancy (+$10k/month revenue), so I know people will pay for the consulting experience. The real question: *Will that validation translate into a DIY product that companies will buy?*

Either way, it's about time to start promoting, building in public, and finding beta users.

Here are the options I’m considering:

* **Put up a waitlist page** before I make my homepage live—but what’s the point? (Just collecting names, or does it need a real conversion goal?) And do I just pray to the Reddit/LinkedIn/SEO gods for people to find it?
* **DM LinkedIn contacts** to 'sell' the workshop I'm reproducing for the MVP and offer future Saas access as a bonus?
* **Invite past clients,** my friends and business associates, or individuals within the co-working space I work to test it first (free or discounted?)
* **Keep posting on LinkedIn.** But if you're over there, you know the lgorithm and impression reach has been garbage lately.
* **Hold until MVP** is ready and do a bigger launch push (Product Hunt, etc.)
* **Try to “build in public”.** But what does that *actually* look like if you’re not on X/Twitter? (And I'm NOT going back to X.) 

And that last one is a big fuzzy gap for me. I don’t want to post coffee shop selfies.

So, one, what do I use/do:

* Substack?
* Reddit vs IndieHackers?
* Slack or Discord groups (which ones work, do I need invitations)?
* Partnerships or cross-promotions?
* Growing my own newsletter (100 ppl now, 60% open rate) vs. communities?

I skipped Invisalign because my dentist said braces would give me faster results, only eight months of treatment.

When I was a teenager, my dentist had already suggested braces because my bite was off. But back then, I was financially dependent on my parents and didn’t want to put that burden on them. I’ve also dealt with TMJ issues for years. Now that I can afford it myself, I figured it’s never too late to fix it.

Before braces, I brushed twice a day (morning and night), but my dentist told me that’s not enough, especially with braces. Food easily gets stuck, and plaque can lead to cavities and gum disease. They recommended using both regular floss and a water flosser in addition to brushing.

So I’m using Soocas, which combines a water flosser and an electric toothbrush, so I don’t need to buy a separate water flosser. I can clean my teeth right in the restroom after meals. My dentist also recommended using an electric toothbrush, so it felt like fate. This way, I can still enjoy cake, apple pie, and coffee every day without worrying about my teeth. It even claims to remove “100% of plaque” (I’ll see if that’s true after a month of use)

Honestly, I’m just happy I can give my adult self something my teenage self couldn’t have.  If you’ve had braces as an adult, what tips do you have for keeping them clean and staying comfortable?

I live in a fairly rural area in a town of about 100,000 people but very far away from any metro area. My town only has a population this large because of a nearby military base. So far all of my bookings except for one have been military related, either family members visiting their military member who lives on base or military members who need a place to stay while relocating to the area and waiting to close on a rental or house.

My listing is a large brick (not a trailer or mobile home) guest house on my property has a pool and is a 1 massive bedroom/1 bathroom with a queen bed, twin bed and toddler bed, kitchen and everything you need for a house. I recently remodeled it and bought high end furnishings but I am still trying to stock it with nice things. My august was about 80% booked but I don’t have any bookings past Sept 1st yet. I’ve had 7 or 8 bookings or so for about $3k in revenue after fees, all of which I have been reinvesting to make the listing better for the coming months.

I have early bird, last minute, weekly and monthly discounts active, as well as instant booking for verified guests and a 2 night minimum. Right now I’m in the amazing pools category but that’s not going to help me in fall and winter. So I need to switch things up!

\-I want to say it's a relatively newish restaurant within the last couple of years

\-When I googled it that day, the name of the palce was \*maybe\* two words in \*maybe\* pink or purple cursive letters painted directly on the building as you enter the front door. I may be making this next part up but I think the entrance to the building is similar to Good Hatch (where the cursive name would be where their mural is)

\-this place came up again in a different conversation two weeks later about it having espresso.

\-in my mind, the name doesn't allude to the fact it sells coffee and sounds something like ""oh baby's....or Sweet baby's...or ""Rays"" (NOT Ray's Cafe and tea house!). I actually have driven past this before and i remember thinking it was maybe a southern restaurant.

After the breakup, I realized that she probably has an avoidant attachment style, either dismissive or fearful, though I think she leans more toward fearful avoidant. On my side, I became aware that I had an anxious attachment style during the relationship, and her avoidant behavior made me feel insecure and overly clingy.

Two months before the breakup, her mood changed significantly. She became colder and more distant, which left me really confused. I think one of the major triggers was that she got her own apartment and we started living together for about three months. I believe she felt like she was losing her independence with me being there, and that scared her deep down.

She kept me in limbo for about three weeks, not sure whether she wanted to break up or not. During that time, I felt emotionally manipulated. I was panicking, constantly trying to prove myself, and ended up losing my self-respect. I was doing everything to please her and ignoring my own needs. In the end, she labeled me negatively in her mind, which is typical of avoidants, and said a few hurtful things that really impacted me.

When she finally broke up with me, I acted strong and accepted it. Even the last time we met to exchange our things, I pretended like everything was fine. I didn’t want to ask for another chance, because I felt that would only boost her ego even more. I had already put her on a pedestal with how much I begged before.

Now it’s been 50 days of no contact and I still haven’t fully closed that chapter emotionally. I didn’t get the chance to tell her how deeply she hurt me and how unfair it was to end things so coldly, especially considering all the good moments we shared. I believe we could have ended things in a more respectful way, not like strangers.

Do you think it’s a good idea to manifest that she misses me, regrets what happened, and wants to meet again, maybe just for a coffee? I would like the opportunity to tell her that I understand why things unfolded the way they did, that I know she has an avoidant attachment style, and that she truly hurt me. Honestly, I just want an apology and to regain a bit of my pride back.

If you think this is possible, how should I approach it?

My only fear is that I still have a little hope that we might get back together. But if I manifest her return and it actually happens, and I later find out that during this no-contact period she was checking if the grass was greener on the other side and only came back because it wasn’t, that would hurt me even more.

I landed in Auckland, spent a night in a noisy hostel, and took a bus to Kaitaia. From there, someone gave me a lift to Cape Reinga. I stood at the lighthouse looking south, backpack heavier than it should’ve been, no idea what I was getting into. The first steps on Ninety Mile Beach were full of doubt. Wind, sunburn, blisters. And that was just day one.

But I kept walking. Through forests so dense they seemed to breathe, across farms, up into misty mountains. I slept mostly in my tent, tucked into corners of bush or behind public shelters. Sometimes a stranger would offer fruit or tea. Once, a hostel owner refused to charge me for a second night. Kindness like that really stayed with me.

The Richmond Ranges tested me more than anything else. Long climbs, freezing mornings, food running low. I learned to trust my instincts more than my GPS. Somewhere near Wanaka I realized I hadn’t spoken to anyone in two days. When I finally ordered a coffee in town, my voice cracked from disuse.

What did I miss? What are you looking forward to this week? Let me know in the comments!",4,1755442630.0,Erie,0,1.0,False
1mst174,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIandPhilosophy/comments/1mst174/daily_dose_coffee_lifts_philosophy/,Daily Dose: Coffee & Lifts Philosophy ☕️ + 🏋️,"Coffee: The Spark. Workout: The Fire. 🔥☕️


Rise and grind, crew! Let's talk about the beautiful duality in our daily habits.

Coffee is that initial **spark**. It's the anticipation, the sharpening of focus, the jolt that cuts through the fog. It's potential energy waiting to be unleashed. It’s the prelude.

The workout is the **fire**. It's where potential becomes kinetic. It's effort, heat, transformation, and sometimes, a bit of necessary discomfort. It’s the main event where we burn fuel (literal and metaphorical) to build something stronger.

One primes us, the other refines us. One awakens the mind, the other tests the body. You can't sustain the fire *only* on sparks, but without that spark... lighting the fire is a whole lot harder.

**Thought for the Day:** Did your coffee today feel like a gentle nudge or a full-blown ignition? How will you channel that energy into your movement? 

I was going to make a new poll for this, but nobody votes so I am just going to list them, which one do you like?❓

Espresso or endurance? ☕️

OR

Brew strong. Lift strong.💪

[Prime Minister Carney praises Trump as two cabinet ministers jet to Sweden for defence procurement talks](https://globalnews.ca/news/11337766/mark-carney-praises-trump-ministers-sweden-defence-deals/). Prime Minister Mark Carney issued an unusual statement Saturday praising U.S. President Donald Trump for trying to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, despite the Alaska summit being widely criticized by foreign policy experts as offering little value and giving Putin an image boost. Carney's endorsement came as two of his cabinet ministers prepared for important meetings in Stockholm on Monday to discuss expanding Canada-Sweden trade, particularly in defence procurement with Swedish manufacturing giant Saab. The timing is significant as Canada tries to negotiate a new tariff deal with the Trump administration after missing the August 1 deadline, and following Carney's review of Canada's plan to buy 88 F-35 fighters from American company Lockheed Martin. Saab has reportedly offered to build its more economical Gripen fighter jets in Canada and create up to 6,000 new jobs, making the closed-door visit by Industry Minister Mélanie Joly and Secretary of State for Defence Procurement Stephen Fuhr particularly interesting from a geopolitical perspective. Canada-Sweden bilateral trade has increased by 90 percent since 2016, valued at $4.9 billion in 2024.

[Byelection day in Alberta nears for vote with 214 candidates, including Poilievre](https://globalnews.ca/news/11324043/advance-polls-battle-river-crowfoot-byelection-alberta-poilievre/). Alberta's Battle River-Crowfoot federal byelection is set for Monday, August 18, featuring a record-breaking 214 candidates including Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, making it the largest federal ballot in Canadian history. Prime Minister Mark Carney called the byelection after Conservative MP Damien Kurek stepped down to allow Poilievre to run, following Poilievre's loss of his long-held Ottawa seat of Carleton in the April general election. Most of the 214 candidates are associated with the Longest Ballot Committee, a protest group advocating for electoral reform, prompting Elections Canada to use unprecedented write-in ballots where voters must hand-write their preferred candidate's name rather than marking boxes. Poilievre has criticized the initiative as a ""scam"" designed to ""confuse the situation"" and make voting harder for elderly and vision-impaired voters, calling for changes to election laws requiring unique signatures for nominations. The riding spans eastern, southern and central Alberta with over 4,000 farms, and advance polls have already seen over 14,000 voters participate in what many consider a foregone conclusion for Poilievre's return to Parliament.

[Who controls the food supply? Proposed changes to seed reuse reopens debate](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-agriculture-seeds-rights-1.7610106). The Canadian government has proposed changes to Plant Breeders' Rights Regulations that would remove farmers' traditional right to save and reuse seeds for certain protected crops, including fruits, vegetables, and ornamental varieties. The changes aim to strengthen intellectual property protection for plant breeders while narrowing the scope of ""farmer's privilege"" - the traditional right to save and replant seeds from their harvest. While personal gardens and crops like wheat, cereals, and pulses would not be affected, critics worry this is a ""slippery slope"" that could lead to further erosion of farmers' rights and increase corporate control over the food supply. The debate pits the principle of encouraging innovation through stronger IP protection against concerns about farmers' autonomy and food security, with the seed industry in Canada valued at $4-6 billion annually. A public consultation on the proposed changes runs until October 18, though the NDP agriculture critic questions why it's being held during farmers' busiest season.

[Air Canada says it will resume flights Sunday after Ottawa intervenes in strike](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/air-canada-flights-sunday-1.7611078). Air Canada announced it will resume flights on Sunday evening after the federal government ordered binding arbitration to end a flight attendants' strike that lasted less than 12 hours. The airline was directed by the Canada Industrial Relations Board to resume operations and have flight attendants return to work by 2 p.m. ET, though it will take several days for operations to return to normal. The strike by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), representing over 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants, began early Saturday morning after failed last-minute negotiations, with the airline implementing a lockout about 30 minutes later. CUPE accused federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu of ""caving to Air Canada's demands"" and setting a ""terrible precedent"" by intervening so quickly, arguing the government ""is rewarding Air Canada's refusal to negotiate fairly."" The two sides are scheduled to return to negotiations this week under the binding arbitration process.

[Hundreds march to White House to protest Trump's D.C. crackdown](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/16/nx-s1-5504861/trump-dc-protest-federal-takeover-white-house). Hundreds of protesters gathered in Washington D.C. on Saturday to demonstrate against President Trump's deployment of National Guard units and his attempted takeover of the city's police department. The peaceful protest began in DuPont Circle with chants of ""Shame"" and ""Trump must go now!"" before marching to the White House, where participants demanded an end to Trump's declared ""crime emergency."" While protesters successfully prevented the appointment of an emergency police chief controlled by Trump after D.C.'s attorney general filed a lawsuit, many said the victory didn't go far enough. Republican governors from West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio announced they were sending hundreds of additional National Guard troops to support Trump's crackdown, despite violent crime in D.C. hitting a 30-year low in 2024.

[Some National Guard troops in Washington set to carry firearms](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/west-virginia-governor-deploys-national-guard-dc-trump-police-takeover-rcna225386). Some National Guard troops deployed to Washington D.C. will begin carrying firearms as part of their mission to address crime and homelessness in the capital, marking a change from their initial deployment earlier this week. Republican governors from West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio announced Saturday they were sending hundreds of additional National Guard troops to support Trump's efforts, with West Virginia deploying 300-400 troops, South Carolina sending 200, and Ohio contributing 150 military police. The deployments come as Trump has ordered 800 National Guard members to D.C. and directed federal law enforcement to assist local police, despite crime rates in the city being at their lowest levels in decades. While Trump initially attempted to take over the Metropolitan Police Department through Attorney General Pam Bondi, the administration backed down after the city sued, leaving Chief Pamela Smith in day-to-day control of the police force. Democrats have criticized the deployment as an ""illegitimate"" and ""unjustified power grab,"" while residents have noticed increased law enforcement presence with checkpoints throughout the city.

[Over 300 protests held Saturday against Trump redistricting push](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/16/us/fight-the-trump-takeover-protests). Pro-democracy activists and labor groups held more than 300 ""Fight the Trump Takeover"" protests across 44 states and Washington D.C. on Saturday, opposing the Trump administration's push for Texas and other states to redraw congressional maps in favor of Republicans. The demonstrations included a major rally in Austin featuring former Congressman Beto O'Rourke, who told crowds that Republicans are acting out of fear of accountability for their ""crimes and corruption."" The protests come as dozens of Texas Democratic lawmakers have fled the state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass redistricting legislation that could give the GOP five additional House seats before the 2026 midterms. California Governor Gavin Newsom has responded with his own redistricting plan that could add five Democratic seats, while similar redistricting efforts are being considered in Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, and Florida. The movement was backed by organizations including Texas for All, Indivisible, Planned Parenthood, and the Democratic National Committee, with tens of thousands participating nationwide.

[State Department announces pause on visitor visas from Gaza](https://www.newsweek.com/state-department-announces-pause-visitor-visas-gaza-refugees-2114473). The U.S. State Department announced a pause on all visitor visas for individuals from Gaza while conducting a review of processes and procedures used to issue a small number of temporary medical-humanitarian visas. Right-wing activist Laura Loomer claimed credit for prompting the review after reporting on ""unvetted Palestinians"" arriving in the United States, though the State Department did not specify the reason for the review. The pause affects visas that have been used to bring Palestinian children wounded in Israeli bombings to the U.S. for medical treatment through organizations like Heal Palestine, which has evacuated 148 individuals including 63 children. The announcement did not specify how many visas were affected or how long the review would last, leaving urgent medical travel cases in uncertainty.

[Texas laws changing on September 1: From abortion to property tax](https://www.newsweek.com/texas-laws-changing-september-1-abortion-property-tax-2113589). A series of new laws will take effect in Texas on September 1, covering topics from abortion restrictions to property tax cuts and school policies. Key changes include a ban on local government funding for out-of-state abortions, increased property tax exemptions (raising homestead exemptions from $100,000 to $140,000 for all homeowners and to $200,000 for those 65+ or disabled), and mandatory display of the Ten Commandments in every public school classroom. The legislation also includes a ban on cell phones in schools, stricter definitions of ""man"" and ""woman"" for state records that could affect transgender individuals, and new restrictions on school library books deemed ""profane"" or ""indecent."" These laws reflect the Republican Party's control over Texas government, though some legislation remains stalled as House Democrats left the state to break quorum and block redistricting efforts.

[Oklahoma requires 'America First' certification test for teachers fleeing blue states](https://www.foxnews.com/media/oklahoma-requires-america-first-certification-test-teachers-fleeing-blue-states). Oklahoma will become the first state to require teachers from liberal-leaning states to pass an ""America First"" certification test to ensure they align with the state's conservative curriculum standards. State Superintendent Ryan Walters announced the test will be developed in partnership with conservative think tank PragerU and will cover American history, civics, and ""common sense"" topics, specifically targeting teachers from California and New York. The test aims to prevent ""woke, indoctrinating social justice warriors"" from entering Oklahoma classrooms and will assess knowledge of ""biological differences between females and males"" and adherence to state history standards that include debunked 2020 election fraud theories. Oklahoma offers up to $50,000 signing bonuses for top teachers, attracting educators from across the country who Walters says are ""fleeing the teachers unions"" in blue states. Teachers' union leaders have criticized the test as a ""political stunt"" and ""major distraction"" from actual educational needs, while some Oklahoma board members have raised legal concerns about the requirement.

[Government papers found in an Alaskan hotel reveal details of Trump-Putin summit](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/16/nx-s1-5504196/trump-putin-summit-documents-left-behind). Eight pages of U.S. State Department documents containing sensitive details about the Trump-Putin summit were accidentally left behind in a public hotel printer in Anchorage, Alaska. The documents, found by hotel guests at the Hotel Captain Cook, revealed precise meeting locations, times, phone numbers of U.S. government employees, and a seating chart for a planned luncheon ""in honor of his excellency Vladimir Putin."" The papers also disclosed that Trump intended to give Putin an ""American Bald Eagle Desk Statue"" as a ceremonial gift and included phonetic pronunciations for Russian officials, including ""Mr. President POO-tihn."" National security experts called the incident evidence of ""sloppiness and incompetence,"" marking the latest in a series of security breaches by Trump administration officials. The documents showed the summit's detailed planning, though the planned lunch was ultimately cancelled during the actual meeting.

[Melania Trump Wrote Personal Letter to Putin About Ukrainian Children at Alaska Summit](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/first-lady-melania-trumps-peace-letter-putin-it-time). First Lady Melania Trump wrote a ""peace letter"" to Russian President Vladimir Putin that President Trump hand-delivered during their Alaska summit, focusing on protecting children affected by the war in Ukraine. In the letter obtained by Fox News, Melania wrote that Putin ""can singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter"" and urged him to protect children's innocence, stating ""you will do more than serve Russia alone—you serve humanity itself."" The letter addressed concerns about the tens of thousands of Ukrainian children who have reportedly been abducted by Russian forces since the 2022 invasion, with Putin reading it immediately in front of both delegations during the summit. Ukrainian officials, including Zelenskyy's chief of staff, thanked Melania for raising awareness about the abducted children and called for their return to be a key condition of any peace agreement. The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin over the alleged war crimes of unlawfully deporting Ukrainian children.

[Trump-Putin summit live updates: Zelenskyy set to visit Trump in Washington on Monday](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-putin-summit-live-updates-ukraines-volodymyr-zelenskyy-visit-tru-rcna225334). President Trump returned from Alaska after failing to secure a ceasefire deal with Russian President Putin during their historic summit, but announced plans to work toward a ""Peace Agreement"" rather than just a temporary ceasefire. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy will visit the White House on Monday to meet with Trump and European leaders, while multiple Republican governors have deployed hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington D.C. to support Trump's crime crackdown efforts. The live blog reveals Trump hand-delivered a letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Putin addressing the plight of Ukrainian children, which Putin read immediately in front of both delegations. Despite no immediate breakthrough, Trump said he and Putin made ""great progress"" on several points, though they haven't reached agreement on ""a couple of big ones,"" and emphasized ""there's no deal until there's a deal.""

[European leaders to join Ukraine's Zelenskyy for White House meeting with Trump](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/17/nx-s1-5505319/european-leaders-zelenskyy-trump). European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, and leaders from France, Germany, Britain, Italy, and Finland will join Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for Monday's crucial White House meeting with President Trump. The unprecedented show of European solidarity comes after Zelenskyy was excluded from Trump's Alaska summit with Russian President Putin on Friday, raising fears that Ukraine could be sidelined in peace negotiations. The European leaders are seeking to ensure their voices are heard in Trump's peace-making efforts and to secure robust security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any potential deal with Russia. The move appears designed to prevent a repeat of February's heated Oval Office confrontation between Trump and Zelenskyy, with European officials hoping their presence will demonstrate unified support for Ukraine's position in the peace process.

[Rubio says a ceasefire deal 'not off the table' between Ukraine and Russia](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/rubio-says-ceasefire-deal-not-off-table-ukraine-russia-trump-rcna225421). Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that a temporary ceasefire agreement between Ukraine and Russia remains ""not off the table,"" even though all sides prefer a permanent peace deal to end the war. Speaking on ""Meet the Press,"" Rubio blamed Putin for not agreeing to a ceasefire and said the U.S. is avoiding new sanctions on Russia to keep peace talks alive, stating ""the minute we take those steps, there is no one left in the world to go talk to the Russians."" The comments come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet with Trump and European leaders at the White House on Monday, following Trump's Friday summit with Putin in Alaska that failed to produce any agreement. Rubio acknowledged that any peace deal would require both sides to ""give up on something,"" including discussions about territorial lines and security guarantees for Ukraine. Special envoy Steve Witkoff mentioned that five crucial regions are under discussion in negotiations and suggested security guarantees could be modeled after NATO's Article Five but provided directly by the U.S. and European countries rather than through NATO membership.

[Pakistan defends flood response after over 270 people killed in northwestern district](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/pakistan-deadly-flash-floods-rescue-relief-1.7611077). Pakistan's death toll from flash floods in the northwestern district of Buner has risen to 274 after rescuers recovered dozens more bodies from collapsed houses following torrential rains and cloudbursts on Friday. Residents have accused officials of failing to issue evacuation warnings before the devastating floods, with no traditional mosque loudspeaker alerts broadcast to warn villagers in remote areas. The government defended its response, saying the sudden downpour was so intense that flooding struck before residents could be alerted, though officials acknowledged an early warning system was in place. One of the deadliest incidents saw 24 people from a single family die in Qadar Nagar village when floodwaters swept through their home on the eve of a wedding, with four relatives still missing. Pakistani authorities warn of more intense weather ahead due to climate change, with the country having already received 50% more rainfall this monsoon season than last year, and higher-than-normal rains since June 26 killing over 600 people nationwide.

[Trump's tariff threats inspire an 'Elbows Up' movement in India — minus the hockey](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/india-elbows-up-1.7610229). Indian lawmakers and business leaders are calling for boycotts of American products in response to President Trump's threat to impose an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods by August 27, citing India's continued imports of Russian oil. Member of Parliament Ashok Kumar Mittal says the boycott will be effective because ""Indians are very patriotic"" and the country ""will never come under any kind of pressure by anyone."" The movement mirrors Canada's ""Elbows Up"" response to Trump's trade war, with Indian leaders urging support for ""Made in India"" products and Prime Minister Narendra Modi advocating for Indian self-reliance during his Independence Day address. The Swadeshi Jagran Manch group organized rallies across India calling the boycott ""a call for nationalism,"" while business leaders pushed for India to develop its own alternatives to American tech platforms like Google, YouTube, and WhatsApp. However, not all Indians appear ready to embrace the boycott, with some consumers like a McDonald's customer in Lucknow saying ""tariffs are a matter of diplomacy and my McPuff \[and\] coffee should not be dragged into it.""

['Formidable' Hurricane Erin weakens to Category 4 storm in Caribbean](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hurricane-erin-caribbean-1.7610981). Hurricane Erin rapidly intensified from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in a single day before weakening to a Category 4 storm with maximum sustained winds of 220 km/h as it passed north of the Caribbean islands. The first Atlantic hurricane of 2025 gained an incredible 96 km/h in wind speed in just nine hours, making it only the fifth Category 5 hurricane recorded in the Atlantic on or before August 16. While the storm's center was forecast to pass north of Puerto Rico without making a direct landfall, heavy rains and winds knocked out power to about 130,000 customers and triggered warnings of flash flooding, landslides, and mudslides across the region. Scientists have linked the rapid intensification of hurricanes like Erin to climate change, as warming ocean temperatures and increased atmospheric water vapor provide more fuel for storms to strengthen quickly, complicating forecasting and emergency planning. The storm is expected to remain a major hurricane into the coming week and could generate powerful rip currents affecting the U.S. East Coast from Florida to the mid-Atlantic, despite staying far offshore.",6,1755442501.0,CANUSHelp,2,1.0,False

1mssz0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTechTakes/comments/1mssz0w/explore_if_the_best_gaming_keyboard_from_npet_k10/,Explore if the Best Gaming Keyboard from NPET K10 Truly Delivers,"The NPET K10 wired computer keyboard has become an everyday staple on my desk, and I’ve had ample time to get acquainted with its quirks and features. This full-size keyboard is designed for both productivity and casual gaming, so I’ve thoroughly tested it across various tasks, from crafting lengthy emails to engaging in heated gaming sessions. The combination of practical multimedia features, compatibility, and spill resistance makes it an easy plug-and-play option. While it has its ups and downs, it’s proven to be a solid tool for everyday use.

**Design and Build Quality**  
One of the first things that struck me about this keyboard is its simple, unassuming build. It’s sleek, all-black, and has a sturdy feel, despite being lightweight at only 1.85 pounds. While the plastic casing might not scream ""luxury,"" it does feel durable enough to handle regular use. The adjustable tilt legs with anti-slip pads are a thoughtful addition, keeping it steady on my desk regardless of how aggressively I might type during a gaming match. Spill resistance is a huge selling point here as well, and I can attest it came in clutch the day I accidentally knocked over my coffee—it’s not entirely spill-proof, but it mitigates damage impressively.

**Typing Experience and Performance**  
Whether I’m hammering out a work project or in the heat of an online game, the typing experience is surprisingly comfortable. The keys are quiet yet tactile, which makes long typing sessions less fatiguing. The switch life is claimed to endure up to one million keystrokes, and while I’m far from approaching that number, the keys show zero signs of wear so far. There’s also the convenience of multimedia shortcuts integrated into the function row (FN+F1-F12), meaning I can control my music, adjust the volume, or open my browser with ease. For someone who detests unnecessary bells and whistles, this functionality strikes the right balance.

**Ease of Use**  
This keyboard is gloriously simple to set up—out of the box, the USB connection worked instantly with my laptop and desktop. No software downloads, no confusing drivers—just plug and go. The 6.2-foot USB cable is another feature I didn’t realize I needed until I had it; the added length ensures I’m never awkwardly tethered when reconfiguring my workspace. It’s fully compatible with Windows 7, 8, and 10, making it a safe choice for most setups. However, Mac users might find certain features less optimized.

**Strengths**  
- Quiet yet satisfying typing experience ideal for work and gaming.  
- Functional multimedia keys for quick access to shortcuts.  
- Spill-resistant design that safeguards against minor accidents.  
- Plug-and-play setup with a generously long 6.2-foot USB cable.  

[Check NPET K10 price on Amazon.](https://preciseshop.com/p/b0bnhwkzbd/)  

**Drawbacks and Flaws**  
While the NPET K10 has a lot going for it, a few areas could use improvement. The plastic material feels durable but doesn’t inspire confidence for high-end longevity, particularly for someone as clumsy as me. The lack of backlighting on the keys is another downside, especially if you’re someone who works under dim lighting. Lastly, it doesn’t offer the advanced features of higher-end mechanical keyboards, which might leave competitive gamers yearning for more precision and customization options.  
- No backlit keys, making it less useful in dark environments.  
- Basic plastic casing that lacks a premium feel.  
- Misses out on mechanical key advantages for competitive gaming.  

**Product Comparisons**  
Stacking it against premium gaming keyboards, such as the Razer Cynosa Chroma, it’s evident the NPET K10 is meant to cater to a more entry-level crowd. While the Cynosa offers RGB lighting and more advanced keystroke technology, it also comes with a significantly higher price tag. On the other hand, keyboards like Logitech’s K120 are similarly priced but don’t have the spill-resistant feature or multimedia shortcuts, making the NPET K10 feel like the better value overall. While it may not be the flashiest contender, this product’s reliability and ease of use still make it a worthy option.

**Affordable Quality**  
Given its set of features and functionality, I’d say this keyboard hits a sweet spot for those on a budget. It’s reasonably priced and delivers a comfortable typing experience without any unnecessary frills. Other options might offer additional flair or mechanical keys, but they come at a cost that won’t suit everyone. For office workers, casual gamers, and anyone needing a dependable everyday keyboard, this one delivers without breaking the bank.

1mssymy,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyUnsentLetters/comments/1mssymy/things_about_you/,Things about you.,"Dear L, 

I don’t know if anyone’s ever told you this, but you remind me of the perfect blend of sunrise and coffee—bright, warm, and strong enough to make the day feel better. Maybe it’s because you’re a morning person, or maybe it’s just the way you naturally make everything around you feel lighter.

I love how you treasure the simple things: your sage green touches, the way you strum your guitar or ukulele, and the care you pour into your 19 plants. (Though I have a feeling they’re extra spoiled—being tended by a plant biology major who probably hums to them between sips of an iced americano with five shots of espresso.)

You have this beautiful balance about you. Whether it’s enjoying kani salad, hibiscus tea, or hotpot, or happily going for tusok-tusok on the street—you carry the same joy. You can pair sashimi with beer, laugh over isaw or kwek kwek, and still somehow make every meal feel special. Even if fried food isn’t your thing, I know I’d never run out of things worth sharing with you—because it’s your presence that makes everything feel complete.

What I admire most is how you carry such a demanding life as a 2nd year OB resident, yet still find time for quiet mornings—studying, sipping coffee, and watching the sunrise. That kind of dedication, paired with the gentleness you show, is something truly rare.

1mssr6u,https://i.redd.it/mos0vfokdljf1.png,Digital is scalable - Physical is unforgettable,"In a world where everything is just a click away, FaceTime calls, WhatsApp groups, emails, LinkedIn DMs - it’s easy to assume that digital connections are enough. But anyone who’s ever shaken a hand, shared a coffee, or walked through a booth at a trade show knows there’s something missing in online-only relationships.

**Presence creates trust.**  
When you show up in person, you’re not just a profile picture or a string of text. You’re a human being with tone, energy, and intent that no emoji can replicate. Research consistently shows that face-to-face communication is more persuasive and memorable than digital exchanges.

**Physical touchpoints leave lasting impressions.**  
A business card exchanged, a flyer picked up at a local shop, or a branded giveaway someone can hold, these are artifacts that extend your presence beyond the moment. Digital disappears in a feed. Physical lingers on a desk.

**Being present builds deeper loyalty.**  
When you walk into a client’s store, attend a local community event, or simply follow up with a personal visit instead of an email, you’re showing commitment. That’s what builds real, long-term relationships.

**Digital is scalable. Physical is unforgettable.**  
We’re not dismissing digital, it’s powerful, efficient, and cost-effective. But digital alone rarely creates a bond. Physical marketing thrives on the simple human truth: we remember how people made us feel when they were right there with us.

# Rule of Thumb

If your presence can’t be felt, your message risks being forgotten. The brands and people that win are the ones who show up.

I’m kinda new around here and honestly it’s been a little tricky finding people my age. I’ve checked out some events, but most of the time it’s older crowds or families — which is cool, just harder to vibe when you’re at a different stage in life.

For context, I moved here from Mexico City (super big city, always something going on), so it’s been an adjustment. Sometimes I head over to Connecticut or Northampton for stuff, but I’d love to find more local things and people around my age (like mid-20s to early 30s).

I’m into hiking, dancing, DIY shows (rock, indie, punk, but also Latin music), coffee shops, restaurants, bars/pubs, outdoor events, trying new things… and I’ve been dying to start rollerskating.

1mssplm,https://i.redd.it/ndo7vgyidljf1.jpeg,"Coping very poorly, there’s a hole in my heart","Thank you for the invite to this group. Almost a month ago, I lost my soul cat, Speckles. She was my birthday gift when I turned 5, a rambunctious little kitten, and she has been an integral part of my life since. She was independent and strong willed, but still always getting involved in my routines. Even when I was super young and didn’t have my own “routines,” she followed my mom to the bus stop every day. She lived every lifestyle, from an outdoor hunter to a fat and greedy house cat. She went with me to college and got me through some very dark times in my mental health. She was very clingy and cuddly as an old lady, and was always watching and waiting for me when I came home.

Last year after graduating, she moved with me into a fairly crappy apartment, alone, as I left a long term relationship after peak leasing season. It was my first year of full time employment. Her CKD progressed fast, but she was strong and constantly begged to go outside through the year. I felt terrible that I couldn’t provide that for her, besides the occasional walk when she accepted the harness. I opened the window for her when she demanded it, but all that was out there was a small patch of grass with a magnolia tree, as it faced the parking lot. Something in me always knew she’d die at 18. All this in mind, I vowed to find the perfect place, and I did. Second story with no stompy upstairs neighbors, a gigantic balcony, a window that faces that balcony from where you can see the woods and my car. I was gonna buy her a bird feeder finally and was so excited to move into it with her. 

She had a wonderful June, and at the same time I reached a high in my mental health. I almost forgot she was sick and was just counting down the days to move. She turned 18 at the beginning of July, and two weeks later she was dying. She went downhill fast a few days before move out, so we rushed to my parents’ house a couple hours away. They have a screen in patio that she always loved to be out on. I gave her a few minutes out there, and she accepted some ice cream and salmon purée, the only things she ate that day. I made a pallet and cuddled with her on the floor one last time that night. She died early in the morning in my arms, window open by the bird feeder. She didn’t make it to her euthanasia appointment. 

A few days ago, I had to move into the new condo without her, and a little to my dismay, it’s cozy and sunny and perfect. She would have loved it, and it makes me so angry that I didn’t give it to her before she passed. Everywhere I look is a spot that she’s absent from. Not cuddle monster watching animal shows on my couch, no hogging my piano bench, no slapping on the blinds to watch birds, no waking me up earlier for wet food and coffee, no face at the window when I get home from work, no begging for my meals, no buddy to beg me to go out on the patio. I feel so very alone and so lost. 

Right as she passed, I had tried to make a vow not to become depressed again, as I feel like she fought long enough to see that I can be okay. However, I feel myself slipping. Right now I’m sick at my stomach from wake to sleep, I’m sleeping terribly, and I’m always seconds from tears. I sob every night. My psych kids are the only good distraction, but I’ve felt no joy or fulfillment in my interactions lately. I need my baby back. 

I’m looking for any advice on how to grieve better. I already considered getting another pet but when I looked at available adoptions it just filled me with dread. How do I get through this more gracefully? ",7,1755441752.0,PetLossJourney,2,1.0,False

1mssom5,https://www.reddit.com/r/GadgetReviewHub/comments/1mssom5/why_review_the_dell_inspiron_156_laptop_for_daily/,Why review the Dell Inspiron 15.6 Laptop for daily productivity needs?,"The Dell Inspiron Laptop, specifically the Dell Inspiron 15.6"" FHD Touchscreen Laptop Computer (Inspiron), strikes a balance between performance and practicality. I’ve been using this device daily for work, casual browsing, streaming, and even some light gaming. The first impression? It’s compact, reliable, and surprisingly versatile. However, it has its quirks, which I’ll touch on later.

**Sleek Design with Thoughtful Touches**  
The moment I unboxed this laptop, its minimalist black design immediately caught my eye. Sporting a full-sized keyboard, complete with a numerical keypad, it proves ideal for long typing sessions. The 15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen display elevates the experience with anti-glare technology, making it easy on the eyes during extended use. Despite its sizable screen, the laptop’s thin profile and 3.64-lb weight make it portable enough for tossing into my backpack for work or a coffee shop day. Not to mention, the narrow border around the display keeps distractions to a minimum while maximizing screen real estate.

**Performance that Delivers for Most Tasks**  
This machine is built for multitasking. Running on a 13th-gen Intel Core i5 processor and equipped with 32 GB of DDR4 RAM, it manages heavy-duty tasks like a champ, whether it's Adobe Photoshop, large spreadsheets, or streaming multiple movie tabs (yes, guilty!). The 1 TB SSD not only offers expansive storage but also ensures fast boot times and quick application loads. While it breezes through most daily tasks, GPU-heavy gaming or 3D rendering may stretch its integrated Intel Iris Xe Graphics limits. Still, for users like me who enjoy light gaming and video streaming, it feels solid.

**Enhancing Productivity with Customizable Features**  
One thing I appreciate is the thoughtful integration of connectivity ports and sustainable design—a win-win feature. This laptop includes just about every port I needed, from USB 3.2 to HDMI, which meant hassle-free extensions with my external monitor. Additionally, the Wi-Fi 6 compatibility made downloads and streaming a breeze; even my slow-ish internet at home didn’t feel much like a bottleneck anymore. Its eco-friendly design using recycled materials offers a surprising bonus, though in all honesty, it doesn’t outwardly seem ""green."" The inclusion of the WOWPC Recovery USB, though, proved to be a lifesaver after a hiccup during an operating system update.

**[Check Dell Inspiron price on Amazon.](https://usegadgets.com/p/b0fgz1lj5q/)**  

**Strengths**  
- The visuals are incredibly vibrant, thanks to its FHD touchscreen panel. Watching movies or editing photos feels engaging.  
- Its 13th-gen processor ensures quick startup and smooth multitasking.  
- Eco-friendly design using recycled materials adds an appealing touch.  
- Ports galore, including USB-C and HDMI, save me from juggling adapters.  

**Pitfalls**  
- For a machine boasting such robust specs, I can’t believe Dell overlooked backlighting in the keyboard. It’s a real hitch when typing in dim light.  
- The battery life is claimed to last nine hours, but in my usual settings (Wi-Fi on, brightness about 75%), it barely stretched past seven—a letdown when you’re out and charging isn’t an option.  
- While fine for light gaming, the integrated graphics chip struggles with anything graphics-intensive, so gaming enthusiasts might want to reconsider.

**Market Rivals**  
Compared to other mid-range laptops like HP Pavilion or Lenovo’s Yoga series, the Inspiron stands out with its display quality and connectivity options. Those laptops might offer snazzier designs or even better keyboard backlighting (cough, Dell!), but I found the Dell gives them a run for their money in storage and RAM flexibility. Apple’s MacBook Air, widely known for its lightweight design, still has a noticeable price point difference—while delivering less SSD storage, making tradeoffs apparent depending on what you prioritize.

**Bang for the Buck**  
From my use, this laptop punches above its weight. Although priced competitively, its combination of touchscreen functionality, premium storage, and sustainable mindset justifies its cost better than most entries in its range. However, if you’re someone bothered by weak battery estimations or crave extra graphical power over other features, alternatives might feel more enticing.

*********

Her Royal Majesty Queen Romana Didulo (1) The First, Queen and Commander-in-Chief of The Kingdom of Canada and The World, Living Crown, Custodian of Earth and Humanity,

Thank you very much. 

And I would like to address the We The People, especially the children today. My beloved Free Sovereign Beings of The Kingdom of Canada and the World, I welcome you with love, peace and sovereignty to this coffee, tea, Milk, water, juice gathering.

It's a joy and honor to be with you here today, not as a distant monarch, but as your Living Crown, sharing this moment of fellowship, guidance and truth under Natural Law. As we sit together, know that you are not sitting and simply attending a conversation; you're participating in the unfolding of a new era for humanity. An era where truth, sovereignty, and peace are the foundations of our shared existence. 

In the past two days, I have issued Royal Decrees that are herstorically significant. These Decrees mark the permanent turning of the page from an old age of control, corruption and deception into an age of Sovereignty, peace and abundance. 

I have Decreed the Permanent Defunding and Disbandment of All Political Systems, Parties and Politicians. For too long, these false structures have profited from division, control and manipulation. Under Natural Law, Sovereignty not, Sovereignty belongs not to institutions, but to each Free Sovereign Being.

I have Decreed the Immediate Transition of All Governments, Municipal, Provincial, Territorial, and Federal to Natural Law. These structures of governance must now serve, not rule, uplift, not, not oppress. [Current governments are dissolved. New structures will be in place by the end of September.]

I have Decreed the Defunding and Disbandment of the Old Canadian Police and Law Enforcement. Their oaths were not to protect you, The People, but to uphold systems of control. Under Natural Law, true protection arises from unity, respect, and community defense. [She has already defunded the RCMP. Twice.]

I have Decreed a comprehensive emergency preparedness plan for all levels of society, National, Provincial, Municipal, and Public. This ensures that in any challenge we remain resilient, sovereign, and prepared together.

And finally, I have Decreed the Canola Oil Sovereignty and Strategic Stockpiling Program. This is not merely about oil, it is about ensuring food sovereignty, protecting farmers and guaranteeing prosperity. $10 billion annually will be dedicated to this, ensuring farmers are paid fairly and our Kingdom is nourished. [I have not seen the actual decree. She says it’s 36(!) pages long.

To the children who are listening today, you are the heart of this New Earth. You are the purest Free Sovereign Beings, born with the light of truth, love, and joy. Everything I do and every Decree I issue is done to protect you, to nurture you, and to ensure you grow up in a Kingdom free of fear, free of lies, and free of oppression. You will inherit a World where your laughter is never silenced, your dreams are never crushed, and your future is never stolen. 

I want you to know this.

Dear children, you are safe, you are loved, and you are the living promise of Peace on Earth. These Decrees are not isolated actions; together, they are the pillars of a New Kingdom under Natural Law. They protect your Sovereignty. They safeguard your food. They restore true governance. They secure preparedness. They end systems of corruption and replace with peace, prosperity and freedom. You, beloved Free Sovereign Beings, young and old alike, are not observers of this transformation, you are the living participants of the new Earth. Each of you carries the responsibility to embody sovereignty, to live peace, and to act with truth; that's to live in peace and to act with truth.

I will address you later afterwards.

1mssj8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1mssj8r/moving_from_30mg_to_50mg_elvanse_is_70mg_worth/,Moving from 30mg to 50mg Elvanse - is 70mg worth looking into?,"I recorded a summary of my experience on Elvanse 30mg and so far with 50mg. For context, this is the first time ever that I am taking medication of this nature. From what I have researched and heard from other experiences online, the effects of elvanse differ from person to person and I don't have any other reference to go off from. 

I have always said that I will continue to stay on titration as intended without skipping days and monitoring the effects of it. My thoughts are, from what I am feeling and seeing in my behaviour so far, that I have built a tolerance to both 30mg and 50mg. In both cases, I had the beginning euphoria as my body adjusted to it on the first day. As expected, it had a bad effect in the one instance when I had a late night / didn't sleep enough which I had heard from other people as well. Like I've been saying, I'll keep logging my experiences on the prescription and explain them to the doctor in the upcoming meeting I have with them. I think it is worth it to explain what I feel to my doctor and request to move up in titration on the 70mg (or even 60mg if they offer that) to monitor the effects from that. So far, I have had infrequent bad side effects and that was when I didn't get enough sleep. I don't drink coffee, take other stimulants or other medications in any shape or form. I'm not even taking hayfever medication because I was worried it would affect the prescription since drowsiness is a possible side effect. 

Summary so far:  
6th August - 30mg Elvanse titration starts. Temporary euphoria. Dry mouth. Slump around 2pm 

7th August - focus slightly improved. 

8th-12th August - no noticeable effects from this point on. 

13th August- 50mg Elvanse titration starts. Temporary euphoria. Dry mouth. Less noticeable slump. 

14th August - focus slightly improved. Dry mouth. 

15th August - focus improved for first half of day. Huge crash after 2pm (likely due to broken sleep.) Tiredness, fatigue, dry mouth. 

16th August - with better sleep, focus seems better. Finding myself getting distracted, carried away organising my room and pushing things to last minute. ",1,1755441339.0,ADHDUK,4,1.0,False

Me (41), BD 14, BD 4, BD (our baby) 7 months

DH and I have been together over 2 years, living together a little over a year. We each have full custody, other parents have visitation. After finding out we were pregnant with ours baby, step kids’ mom filed for every other weekend after having Wednesday dinner for YEARS. DH has raised them on his own since they were 2 and 4. I’ve raised mine on my own since mine were 11 and 1.

Step kids and I got along great until I moved in and they (mostly SS) didn’t like the shift of attention and started acting out. Lying, stealing, manipulating. His mom is BPD, beginning to think we are seeing the beginning of that, here. There hasn’t been a holiday or a day special to me that he hasn’t ruined unless we intentionally sent him with family to protect what is important to me. Hundreds of dollars stolen multiple times. I started keeping my cash locked in my glove box bc I can’t have it in the house. The end of June he broke into my car and stole $180, and when confronted he raised his hand to me.

A psych eval recommended a partial hospitalization program. DH refused. I left with my three daughters included the ours daughter. DH was devastated. We came to an agreement that he would spent the remaining summer at his mothers and/or DH’s mothers homes while he started outpatient treatment. He told several extended family members that I was cruel and abusive without telling them WHY there were issues….and I found myself on the receiving end of terrible yelling fits from them until they found out the real story.

School is back in session and he shows no remorse but I work FT and my girls show livestock so we are gone a lot of weekends. SS still spends weekends with bio mom or his grandma but is with us during the week. Bio mom is still upset with DH for taking his phone and not allowing him to get his drivers license. DH said she’s welcome to supply those things herself….but she has never paid child support and the kids only have what we supply and they drag everything from clothes to PlayStations back and forth to bio moms.

Apparently, SS has been going to church with grandma. We got a call from grandma this morning informing us that SS is getting baptized today.

Setting all issues aside such as parental consent…I don’t care. But he has no remorse for the blatant abuse towards me. I pay bills and help support the household- including him- but he treats me horribly and without gratitude or respect.

I was raised Mormon but have been inactive most of my life so perhaps my view is skewed…but grandma is very aware of the issues and I don’t think it is appropriate- possibly even more manipulation- to baptize this teenager with NO remorse. I’m spiritual, I pray daily, and am deeply rooted in basic beliefs but not so much LDS beliefs. I sure love dark black coffee. Why wash away sins when sins are still being committed every day while he has no remorse for any of the things that he has done?

I’m a RN. Clinically speaking, I don’t see any improvement with the current treatment plan as an outpatient, but he’s too scared of his dad right now to raise his hand to me again.

I have been mostly nacho for the last year, but now I’m full NACHO. I have declined to attend this baptism based on both my NACHO status, and my feeling that this is both inappropriate by those performing the baptism and manipulative by my step son.

1mssgdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechTruthSerum/comments/1mssgdi/should_the_best_renewed_laptop_be_the_dell/,Should the Best Renewed Laptop Be the Dell Chromebook 3180,"The Dell 3180 Chromebook, specifically the ""Dell Chromebook 11 3100 11.6"" Touchscreen 2 in 1 Chromebook"" model, landed in my hands recently, and I’ve spent the last few weeks putting it through its paces. Lightweight, compact, and featuring a rugged build, this Chromebook has proven to be a reliable companion for daily tasks. Whether I’m writing, streaming, or browsing on its small yet efficient screen, it’s clear this machine has its strengths—but it’s not without a few compromises.

**Design and Build Quality**  
One of the first things I noticed about this Chromebook is its tough exterior. The black matte finish feels durable and resists fingerprints fairly well. It’s not flashy—think functional over fashionable. At just 3.1 pounds, it’s light enough for me to toss it into a backpack without feeling like I’m lugging around a brick. The compact dimensions (13 x 9 x 0.6 inches) also make it easy to carry. Its 11.6-inch touchscreen display, however, is where it shows its compromises. While the screen resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels performs decently for basic tasks like editing documents and browsing the web, it struggles a bit with color vibrancy and sharpness for more media-heavy tasks.

**Performance for Everyday Tasks**  
Powered by an Intel Celeron N4020 Dual-Core processor and 4 GB of LPDDR4 RAM, this Chromebook is surprisingly zippy for lighter workloads. Switching between tabs on Chrome or using apps like Google Docs and Sheets runs smoothly. I’ve multitasked a bit—streaming YouTube while working on spreadsheets—and for a budget device, it handles it fairly well. That said, with just a 32 GB flash memory for storage, it’s evident Dell focused on cloud-based usage with Chrome OS. Unless you’re ready to fully embrace Google Drive or an external storage solution, you might feel a little constrained.

**Highlights**  
- Lightweight and portable design.  
- Responsive touchscreen for casual use.  
- Decent performance for tasks like web browsing, streaming, and using productivity apps.

[Check Dell 3180 Chromebook price on Amazon.](https://powerfinders.com/p/b0bk2z5qgc/)  

**Battery Life: An Unexpected Plus Point**  
Here’s where this Chromebook really surprised me. The battery life on this thing is fantastic. On a full charge, I’ve consistently gotten about 13-14 hours of usage, which is perfect if, like me, you’re someone who’s often on the go between coffee shops or stuck in long meetings all day. No constant hunting for outlets with this one! This feature definitely makes it perfect for students or professionals working remotely.

**Drawbacks**  
While this Chromebook punches above its weight for basic tasks, some of its specs feel limiting in 2023 standards.  

- The screen resolution lacks crispness for media-heavy tasks.  
- Base-level 4 GB RAM might falter during intensive multitasking.  
- Only 32 GB of storage leaves little room for offline use.  

**Connectivity Features**  
Let me say that I appreciate the inclusion of Bluetooth and USB-C connectivity, as these features make pairing peripherals and charging more seamless. Two USB 2.0 and two USB 3.0 ports provide ample connectivity options, and the 802.11ac wireless type ensures a stable internet connection—essential for a Chromebook. While not groundbreaking, these elements mean the machine stays functional for day-to-day usage.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing the Dell 3180 Chromebook to alternatives like the Lenovo Chromebook C330 or the HP Chromebook 14, I found it holds its own in build quality and battery life. However, the HP Chromebook 14 offers a bit more storage and a larger screen with higher resolution, while the Lenovo Chromebook C330 provides equal portability with an IPS display for better viewing angles. The Dell model does shine brighter in durability and ruggedness, making it more suitable for younger users or those likely to handle their laptops less carefully.

**Cost Efficiency**  
For the price point this device generally occupies, I think its features are well-rounded but not extravagant. If performance, portability, and battery life are your key concerns, this Chromebook justifies its price tag. It’s a solid choice for students or professionals with basic computing needs, though it won’t shine for power users or creative professionals requiring high processing power.

Operating this pour-over coffee maker was incredibly intuitive. All you need is coarsely ground coffee, hot water, and a steady hand. Its reusable stainless steel mesh filter is a huge plus for both practicality and flavor. Unlike paper filters that often rob coffee of its aromatic oils, the mesh filter retains those oils, resulting in a richer, fuller cup. I followed the instructions, pouring a small amount of water over the grounds before continuing. The process, taking roughly 3–4 minutes, provided both a mindful brewing experience and a deliciously robust coffee.

**Flavor Profile and Capacity**  
The taste of the coffee brewed with this device proved exceptional. I enjoyed how the natural oils and subtle flavors of the ground coffee came through clearly. With an 8-cup capacity, it’s perfect for small gatherings, although let’s be honest—if you’re a caffeine devotee like me, more than a few cups are just for yourself! Each cup is about 4 oz, and the borosilicate glass carafe ensures there’s no weird aftertaste or chemical interference—just clean, pure coffee bliss.

**Build and Design: Standout Features**  
I found the build quality of this coffee maker highly reliable. The carafe, crafted from high-heat-resistant borosilicate glass, feels resilient yet lightweight. The cork band not only adds a touch of warmth to the aesthetic but also serves as a functional grip to avoid heat burns. However, I wouldn’t recommend this for those who are clumsy or handling a rush-hour breakfast situation—it doesn’t appear as if it would survive being dropped on a hard surface. Also, it doesn’t hold heat for long, being single-wall glass.

**Benefits**  
- Provides rich flavor and retains natural coffee oils.  
- Stylish design complements most kitchen styles.  
- Eco-friendly with its reusable stainless steel filter.  
- Made from durable borosilicate glass.  

**Caveats**  
- Single-wall glass means minimal heat retention.  
- The cork grip requires gentle cleaning to avoid wear.  
- Carafe feels delicate despite being resilient to heat.

**Market Rivals**  
In comparing it to other pour-over coffee makers like the Chemex or Hario V60, the Bodum 11571-109US holds its own for specific reasons. While the Chemex offers a slightly higher design aesthetic and larger size options, it relies on disposable paper filters, which I find less economical and more wasteful. The Hario V60, on the other hand, feels a bit more compact and portable, but it lacks the elegance and robust feel of this Bodum model. If visual appeal and ease of use matter to you, the Bodum is a strong contender in the pour-over category.

**Bang for the Buck**  
For the features it offers, this coffee maker delivers good value. Investing in a reusable filter saves the recurring expense of purchasing paper filters, and the glass carafe ensures long-term usability (provided it’s handled carefully). While it’s a tad pricier than some simpler models, the combination of aesthetics and performance justifies the price. I’d confidently say it offers excellent cost-effectiveness.

Killian Black Phantom - 10/10 Sweet and thick coffee syrup

Dusk the Woods Collection - 9.8/10 Very close to PDM Layton, minty and sweet vibe

CDN Iconic - 8.6/10 Shower gel vibe, easy office scent

Al Haramain Amber Oud Tobacco - 8.9/10 Not in the 9s because it is too clove heavy, sweet tobacco and cloves

Yesterday, I posted a video from Peter Beinart talking about how the crisis in Gaza has always been immoral and that we should welcome people into the space who haven’t always been there and are coming to these realizations. 


 I expected pushback, but I got so much that I had to step away. 

Firstly, I have to say, by posting a clip of something, I do not mean to necessarily agree with everything they have said in their entire lives. However—some woman  who won an award from one of those BS StopAntisemitism type organizations, and isn’t Jewish called him Erev rav for I guess breathing the same air as a columnist she didn’t like. I told her I felt it was weird for a non-Jew to tell me, a Jew, not to platform another Jew was a little weird. And again, by showing this clip, I’m in no way claiming to agree with Beinart’s dog groomer or anyone who has ever served him a coffee, etc. 

I got lots of people telling me the starvation in Gaza isn’t real—but mostly people telling me I don’t know what it’s like to live in Israel and by platforming him I should have expected this. My content has always leaned left—so I have no idea why this is surprising. 

The whole thing ended up with someone threatening to sue me and someone claiming the post made them suicidal as an October 7 survivor (it was a little more complex than that, but the post spurned it on).

1mssao5,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1mssao5/microcement_over_tile_countertop_1_year_update/,Microcement over tile countertop - 1 year Update,"1 year ago I did a DIY project of updating my extremely well built, but dated, tile countertops (link to og post below). It took me about a week to do, and I was asked by @[Luckyfncharms](https://www.reddit.com/user/Luckyfncharms/) to do an update after some time. Here is that update:

They still look fantastic! In the pictures I took this morning I made sure to include the only damage I have been able to cause in the past year. On the peninsula there is a small spot with a slight white haze - this is from a high heat iron landing directly on the counter without any heat protection. It's the sealant, not the concrete, and I could easily sand and reseal that spot - which I will probably do soon.  
  
In the picture with the coffee maker there is an odd shaped strip that is visible close to the edge on the right. This was caused when we got anxious after about 1 day of final dry time and started putting things on the counter - a big scrape happened and, while a patch job was possible and the surface smooth, it was no longer wet enough to visually blend all the way in. Wait the full 3 days.  

I highly recommend this project to anyone looking to update a bathroom or kitchen that is stuck with dated tile and a smaller budget.

And to that I say: have you met us? 

We’ve literally always been transparent about who we are. We’re not running a scam, we’re just running on snacks and lower back pain.

The truth is, Friends Over 50 didn’t start as a subreddit, it started as a chat. A community. A whole vibe. Long before we had mod tools or flair or official rules, we had stories, friendships, and a name that stuck.
Why would we change it now?
We’ve got history here. 
This name is part of our origin story,it’s where everything began. 
And no, it doesn’t mean you get carded at the door or need to show proof of hip replacement. It just means you fit in with the spirit of the group: kind, mature, drama-free, and okay with talking about cats, coffee, and questionable joints (in both the anatomy and real estate sense).

We’ve never pretended to be some exclusive 50+ gated community. It’s always been about connection, not age brackets. Never judge a book by its cover or a group by its name.

So yeah. Why change something that already works? 
Let’s keep the name, keep the weirdness, and keep being exactly what we’ve always been:

Friends. Over 50. Or not. Whatever. 
You’re welcome here.

1mss8tz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIWritingHub/comments/1mss8tz/how_i_accidentally_created_a_90s_comingofage/,How I accidentally created a 90s coming-of-age story with AI,"It started with a single AI-generated picture of a girl in New York, mid-90s. I didn’t know her name, or her story. But after I asked ChatGPT to explain who she was… Mia Weaver was born.

I’d been fascinated by the idea of creating something with AI for a while. I actually enjoy AI content in general, but I could never figure out what to make myself. It always felt like every idea was already taken.

Then one day I stumbled across a social media account showing how different cities looked in the past — all generated by AI. I binge-watched those insanely atmospheric reels for a week and finally thought: maybe I should try something like that too.

I started small, generating short clips in Google AI Studio (Veo 2 does a decent job). Then I found OpenAI’s Sora, which in the free version only makes images. And that’s where it happened: the very first “portrait” of Mia. Well, at the time it was just some random *“girl visiting New York for the first time in the mid-90s, standing in the sunset light and drinking Coca-Cola from a glass bottle.”*

I loved the picture. It felt warm, atmospheric. And I couldn’t help wondering — *who is she, what’s her story?* So I tossed the image into ChatGPT and asked it to tell me. That’s how Mia Weaver was “born.”

At first, the story was full of clichés and funny mistakes (like referencing Pinterest in the 90s). But it was still fascinating. I experimented with tone, asked for fewer clichés, and eventually the first chapter came together. By chapter two, I realized I wanted to give Mia a real background: her family, her small hometown, all the things that shape who she is.

That’s when I hit the limits of the free plan — the context kept resetting, her parents’ names changed from message to message, even her aunt Laurie disappeared a few times. After some internal debate, I decided to pay the $20 for a month and keep going.

By chapter three, ChatGPT started suggesting its own prompts for visuals. That’s where things got funny: many of those prompts broke content rules, and some images never got generated even after five attempts. But I decided not to “fix” them manually, since this was an experiment. So some chapters simply stayed almost without visuals.

And still — the story worked. Predictable in places, sure, but it was readable, engaging, and entirely written by AI. I loved it (and still do).

There were plenty of quirks along the way. For example:

*“Laurie sipped her coffee. ‘What, apply? Sure. It’s not Hogwarts. It’s paperwork and hustle.’”*  
— except… it’s 1995, and Hogwarts didn’t exist yet. ChatGPT caught itself and corrected it:  
*“Laurie sipped her coffee. ‘What, apply? Sure. It’s not the moon landing. It’s paperwork and hustle.’”*

Another thing I learned: if I didn’t set a frame for the action, the whole new chapter would just turn into endless description. So I started asking for several possible plot directions before writing each part. It became a bit like those interactive story games where you get to pick the next move.

Eventually I just hit the dialogue limit. But honestly? I still think the experiment was a success:

* I got a decent, readable text.
* I got a whole set of visuals (glitches and all, but that made it funnier).
* And most of all: creating a story *with* AI turned out to be pure fun.

It let me try on so many roles — editor, proofreader, director, designer. And I loved it.

All the chapters and their visuals will be posted in the comments.

Jim doesn't really want to because he still has feelings for Spock but Bones convinced him to.

At this point, Jim believes Spock wants nothing more to do with him but Spock is awkwardly trying to seduce Jim, using Jim's methods to seduced Spock back then (making coffee, playing chess, etc.) Which Jim realized later.

I’ve learned so much in the short time I’ve had her and even in early stages of training, I’m seeing small wins. I live in a city so our backyard is essentially a large park where a lot of dogs run off leash. Tell me why the off leash dogs are more respectful than their owners!! Our first run in was with a husky who I could tell just didn’t have the training to be off leash. He was really hyper and got a little close to my dog and she freaked. I couldn’t believe how unaware the owner was as he watched me holding on for dear life. He gave a weak “come on” to his dog but I couldn’t believe how long he waited before “intervening.” It just happened again where a woman took her dog off its leash a few feet away from us and my dog went from calmly watching squirrels (a win) to lunging, the whole nine yards. We may as well have been invisible. She couldn’t have tried any harder to avoid our existence. She had the audacity to casually sip her coffee while I’m holding on for dear life. That’s when I realized what bothers me most about these owners: it’s pretending that we don’t exist. Allowing dogs off leash to run and play doesn’t bother me. I hope one day my dog can do the same. But if she had looked at me and simply said sorry about that, l wouldn’t have been bothered nearly as much. It’s the indifference. Acting as though my dog and I aren’t in distress. My reactions both time were to tend to my dog first and then give the owners nasty looks which is ineffective as they don’t look at us!!! I’ve read on here where people have been much more vocal (my heros) and yelled at off leash dog owners to get their dogs away, etc. but it sounds like that isn’t effective either bc the owners are SO OBLIVIOUS. I want to protect mine and my dogs peace and know if I let myself, I’ll absolutely lose it on them, it’ll be ineffective, then my dogs peace and I will end up feeling worse. So does anyone have tips on remaining calm? And what’s the best course of action? Clearly being ignored is a trigger here and I don’t want to give these owners any more power over me.
