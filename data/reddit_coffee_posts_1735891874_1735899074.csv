Well, this time, it turned out we both felt the same way. We've (me 29m and her 27f) known each other for seven years now—taken trips together, just the two of us, and had countless ""friend dates,"" like going to museums, grabbing coffee, or trying out new activities.

We’ve always been incredibly comfortable with each other. A week ago, I told her I had feelings for her, and to my surprise, she admitted she felt the same. We spent New Year’s Eve with friends, but honestly, I think we’re both a bit unsure about how to transition from being very close friends to something more romantic. After all, we know each other so well, and for so long, that it feels like uncharted territory.

So, what now? How do we move past this barrier and give a real shot at something deeper? We’re both confident that, even if it doesn’t work out, our friendship is strong enough to survive. But still, figuring out how to take that leap feels like a challenge.",1,1735898853.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Everyone has shared so many lovely memories over the years with our green kirin - ones that undoubtedly will be fondly looked back upon for many more to come. Whether it was soothing ASMR, cozy yap sessions, or goofy collabs with her friends, we all found a place to gather and build a community.

Many people can be especially stressed out around this time of the year, so please look out for one another and reach out. If you are having troubling thoughts and feel you need someone to talk to immediately, head to https://findahelpline.com/i/iasp to find a crisis hotline best suited for your location and needs. It may sound silly to some, but losing an oshi could easily be the final straw for someone who is already down on their luck.

One thing I can promise you, though, is that it will get better, so worry not! Even though Fauna is graduating, there's plenty of ways we can still keep her around and in our hearts. Her channel isn't going anywhere, so watch away! Use cute Fauna emotes on Discord! Buy some Fauna merch! Draw your own Faunart! Heck, plant trees in her name! If you haven't checked it out yet, you can visit https://flora4fauna.net and donate to the Arbor Day Foundation so they'll even do it for you!

Now, as sappy as it sounds, it truly does help to remember the good and not dwell on the bad. What sort of moments with Fauna stood out to you? How has she impacted your life? What is something you would have looked forward to her doing in the future? Positive, hopeful, and introspective questions such as these are great ways to discuss the matter in a way that doesn't bring despair.

Like, for me personally, I tried out matcha after hearing her yap about it so much. At the time, I was a heavy coffee drinker and would always get horrible coffee jitters and headaches. As if by magic, that all went away as soon as I switched to matcha - I haven't looked back since!

Even if you haven't watched the most Fauna content, only saw her VODs, or just clicked through a few of her clips, you're still a part of what makes Fauna's community so great, and this sapling thanks you from the bottom of their heart. Neither Fauna nor any of us could be where we are now without any of each other, and that's what makes each and every one of us special.

As much as it pains me to say - for *all* of us to say - Man, I Love Fauna. Uuuuuu...

These white dots popped up in a way that looks like liquid that’s dropped from above. Above is an attic. I checked the ceiling above and it’s dry.

Forensically, It doesn’t look like liquid that’s fallen from a height as usually the splash would cause more oblong shapes when the energy disperses in outward direction upon impact. And the groupings don’t look familial. Also it’s a thick liquid. But the vertical stacking on the 3 different layers (desk, keyboard, floor) is aligned as if something rained down that specific area.

Crucially, about a week ago, I woke up to around a dozen white-ish grey dots each as big as the biggest ones here, found in the exact same place on the floor underneath the keyboard. I didn’t know what it was and assumed maybe it was milk from my coffee that had spilled down the side of the glass. Although forensically again, the pattern didn’t resemble a splash, and if it spilled from my coffee then there would have also been some on my desk where I rested it (and there weren’t).

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly—the Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded exploration. As I embarked on this freewriting journey, the repetition of the existential inquiry became the rhythm of my introspection.

For a thousand words, I delved into the varied perspectives of individuals wrestling with the ultimate question. From philosophers contemplating the intricacies of existence to everyday people seeking purpose in mundane routines, the epanalepsis served as a constant reminder of the universal quest for meaning.

The narrative weaved through different characters and their unique experiences, creating a tapestry of reflections that echoed the complexities of human existence. The repetitive structure became a literary heartbeat, pulsating with the shared yearning for understanding amid the chaotic symphony of life.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents. The mayor saw it as a sign of prosperity, the local florist interpreted it as a call for unity, and the elderly storyteller regarded it as a harbinger of forgotten tales. The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

As the story unfolded, I traced the journey of the dove's symbolism, following its subtle influence on characters and events. The once quaint town underwent a transformative metamorphosis, and the symbolism of the dove became a thread that wove through the narrative, connecting disparate lives in unexpected ways.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

**Response to Prompt 43: Epizeuxis**

""Never, never, never give up."" The words echoed in my mind, a relentless epizeuxis that fueled the protagonist's journey against insurmountable odds. In the dystopian world I crafted, where hope was a rare commodity, the power of repetition became a beacon of resilience.

For a thousand words, I immersed myself in the protagonist's struggle, exploring the emotional depth of the epizeuxis as a mantra against despair. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry, a whispered promise that carried the weight of a shattered world on its shoulders.

As the narrative unfolded, the epizeuxis became a driving force, propelling the protagonist through a landscape of desolation and uncertainty. The repetition served as a reminder that, in the face of adversity, the strength to persist often lies in the relentless echo of one's own determination.

**Response to Prompt 3: Hyperbole**

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers. ""This is it, the end of our mundane lives!"" proclaimed Mrs. Thompson, the town's eternal pessimist, as she clutched her cat, Captain Whiskers, with an air of impending catastrophe.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation. In this hyperbolic haven, Mistwood's residents discovered the joy in embracing the absurdity of life.

**Response to Prompt 6: Assonance**

Amidst the rolling hills of Harmony Valley, where the soft hum of nature's symphony echoed through the meadows, a mysterious traveler arrived, bringing with them a melody that resonated with the delicate assonance of a forgotten tune. The townsfolk, captivated by the harmonious vibrations, felt an inexplicable connection to the stranger.

As I explored the narrative, the assonance became a musical thread weaving through the story, emphasizing the emotional cadence of the characters' experiences. The traveler's words, laced with vowel-rich verses, carried the echoes of a distant melody, leaving an indelible impression on the hearts of those who listened.

Through the lens of assonance, I delved into the subtle interplay of sounds that defined the atmosphere of Harmony Valley. The lyrical quality of the narrative mirrored the town's collective journey, where the resonance of shared moments and emotions harmonized with the traveler's enigmatic presence.

**Response to Prompt 7: Onomatopoeia**

In the bustling city of Metropolis, where the rhythm of urban life played out in a cacophony of sounds, a peculiar street performer emerged. Armed with an array of unconventional instruments, he orchestrated a symphony of onomatopoeic brilliance that echoed through the crowded streets.

The narrative unfolded with the vibrant expressions of onomatopoeia, capturing the essence of the city's sonic landscape. The performer's drumming evoked the rhythmic tap-tap of raindrops, while his wind instruments mimicked the whoosh of passing cars. The city, typically drowned in noise, became a canvas for this auditory artist.

As I delved into the story, the onomatopoeic symphony became a language of its own. The characters communicated through the vibrant echoes of everyday sounds, fostering a unique connection between the performer and the people of Metropolis. The narrative danced to the beat of onomatopoeic creativity, transforming the mundane into a dynamic celebration of city life.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed—a pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden. The juxtaposition of these contrasting elements created a visual paradox that fascinated both residents and visitors alike.

As the narrative unfolded, the stark contrast between the city's cutting-edge architecture and the serene beauty of the Zen Garden became a metaphor for the characters' internal conflicts. The bustling metropolis symbolized progress and innovation, while the tranquil garden embodied the need for balance and introspection.

Through the lens of juxtaposition, I explored the dichotomy within the characters as they navigated the relentless pace of Silicon Haven. The Zen Garden became a refuge, a place where the cacophony of technology met the soothing whispers of nature. The juxtaposition served as a visual metaphor for the characters' quest to find equilibrium in a world defined by extremes.

**Response to Prompt 22: Metonymy**

In the political arena of Capital City, where decisions echoed through the corridors of power, a single phrase dominated conversations—the ""Iron Throne Statement."" This metonymic expression encapsulated not just a policy decision but the entire narrative of political maneuvering that unfolded within the city's hallowed halls.

The story unfolded with the metonymy acting as a symbolic gateway into the complexities of governance. The Iron Throne Statement, while seemingly straightforward, carried the weight of a thousand debates, negotiations, and betrayals. Its impact rippled through the lives of citizens, shaping their destinies in ways they could scarcely fathom.

Through the lens of metonymy, I delved into the layers of meaning hidden within this political shorthand. The characters grappled not only with the literal implications of the Iron Throne Statement but also with the overarching themes of power, ambition, and the sacrifices demanded by political gamesmanship.

The narrative unfolded with the charm of understatement, as the townsfolk continued their routines, blissfully unaware of the cosmic storm brewing beneath the surface. The serene descriptions of everyday life served as a stark contrast to the impending upheaval that threatened to reshape the very fabric of Serenity Springs.

Through the lens of understatement, I explored the characters' nonchalant reactions to the unfolding events.

**Response to Prompt 31: Epanalepsis**

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded introspection. As I embarked on the freewriting journey, the repetition of this existential inquiry became a rhythmic pulse, guiding the exploration of diverse

perspectives on life's purpose.

For a multitude of words, the epanalepsis led me through a kaleidoscope of reflections. From the philosophical musings of scholars to the simple yet profound revelations of everyday individuals, each recurrence of the question served as a gateway into the vast tapestry of human contemplation.

**Response to Prompt 38: Asyndeton**

In the dystopian city of Emberfall, where the remnants of a fallen civilization lay entwined with the shadows of despair, a lone figure emerged—a rebel determined to dismantle the oppressive regime. The narrative unfolded with the rapid pace of asyndeton, omitting conjunctions to mirror the urgency of the protagonist's quest.

Through a cascade of words, the asyndeton propelled the reader through the city's decaying alleyways and towering citadels, each sentence building upon the last.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

1hsio7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1hsio7x/the_psychology_of_freemium/,The Psychology of Freemium,"I'm new to this whole indie hacking journey, and I've been pondering over one question lately: ***how do you make free users actually want to pay for your stuff?***

Been spending late nights reading indie hackers' stories, watching product teardowns, and honestly, making all the rookie mistakes myself. You know, the usual - launching with too many features locked behind a paywall, then wondering why nobody's upgrading. Classic beginner stuff.

But after countless coffee-fueled research sessions and some hard lessons from my own tiny project, I'm starting to see patterns. And no, I'm not going to pretend I'm some freemium guru - I'm just a fellow builder sharing notes from the trenches.

So grab your coffee (or tea, no judgment), and let's figure this out together.

# The Freemium Puzzle

You know that feeling when you're using a free app, and suddenly you hit that ""upgrade to continue"" wall? Yeah, it's annoying. But as someone building a product now, I'm starting to understand the science behind it.

First off, freemium isn't just about blocking features. It's like dating - you need to show your value before asking for commitment. *(Yeah, I just made that analogy. Stay with me.)*

Look, I used to think freemium was simple - lock away the good stuff, and people will pay to get it. Turns out that's like trying to get someone to marry you before the first date. Not exactly smooth, right? The more I dig into this, the more I realise it's about building a relationship with your users, showing them you're worth their time before asking for their money.

I mean, think about it - would you pay for something if you weren't sure it could solve your problem? **Neither would I.**

# The Psychology That Makes Sense

Here's what's clicking for me after reading countless indie hacker discussions and product teardowns. And trust me, I've gone deep down this rabbit hole - we're talking 3 AM, surrounded by empty coffee cups, scrolling through endless forum posts kind of deep.

The psychology behind why people decide to pay for something isn't really about features **at all**. It's about moments, triggers, and tiny decisions that add up. Here's what I've pieced together from all those late-night reading sessions:



1. Make Them Say ""Wow"" First



Think about Spotify's free trial that lets you experience the full premium experience. Or how Slack lets you see all your message history before hitting the limit. They're not just showing features - they're letting you taste the full experience. When users see what's possible, upgrading feels less like a forced choice and more like an obvious next step.  No paywalls, no frustrating limits - just pure, instant value that makes you think ""okay, this is actually useful.""



1. The ""Already Home"" Effect



Ever noticed how hard it is to switch apps once you've set everything up just right? I'm still using the same note-taking app I started with two years ago. Not because it's the best, but because all my notes, tags, and systems are there. That's what we want - make users feel so at home with your free features that upgrading feels like adding a room to their house, not buying a new one.



1. The ""Too Good"" Problem



Here's my favorite discovery - sometimes users hit a ceiling with your free plan because they're using it too much. Look at **Google Drive** \- you start storing your docs, sharing files, collaborating seamlessly... until that storage limit notification pops up. But by then, your whole workflow is built around it. You're not mad about hitting the limit - you're actually kind of glad you got so much value from the free version.

The trick isn't forcing the upgrade - it's making your free plan so useful that hitting its limits feels like outgrowing your favorite jeans.That's the sweet spot we're looking for.



1. Let Them Get Hooked



This one's simple - don't lock away the addictive parts of your product. Let users get used to solving their problems with your tool. One indie hacker told me they let users create unlimited basic reports for free. The paid plan? That's for when they need to share these reports with their team. By then, they're already hooked on the value.

# What Seems to Work

From what I've gathered (and tested on my small project):

**Clear Value Steps:**



* Free: Solve one specific problem really well
* Paid: Make it faster/better/easier
* Premium: Take away all their headaches



**Natural Limits:** Instead of blocking features entirely, let people:



* Use core features freely
* See what premium stuff looks like
* Hit natural usage limits



# The Growth-First Mindset

The biggest lesson? Stop thinking about ""converting users"" and start thinking about ""helping users grow."" When they grow, some will need your paid features naturally.

Just like a good gym trainer. They don't start by trying to sell you the premium package - they help you get those first few wins. Run your first mile. Lift that weight. Feel that progress. Then, when you're hooked on the results, upgrading to personal training sessions just makes sense.

Here's what this looks like in practice:



* Show them what's possible (greyed-out premium features that hint at better results)
* Give them a taste of premium (like that one-time export to Excel feature)
* Focus on their success milestones (""Hey, you've created 10 reports! Want to automate this?"")
* Make upgrading feel like a natural growth step, not a forced move



The moment you switch from ""how do I make them pay?"" to ""how do I help them succeed?"", everything becomes clearer. Because successful users don't need to be convinced - they're already looking for ways to do more.The Psychology of Freemium",3,1735896419.0,Entrepreneur,0,1.0,False
1hsina1,https://www.reddit.com/r/magyar_adhd/comments/1hsina1/livizux_30_mg_kezdeti_tapasztaltok/,Livizux 30 MG kezdeti tapasztaltok,"Igértem egy kis beszámolót Livizuxal kapcsolatban, ezért íme: December 28.án kaptam vettem be az első adagot a legalacsonyabb 30 mg-os kiszereléssel kezdtem.

Úgy érzem referenciának fontos lennek egy kis háttertörténet  ezért elmesélem hogy stabilan 2023 Decemberétől kezelem magam ADHD miatt, Ritalin illetve Concerta segitségével. 2024-es évem rengeteg változást hozott, letettem a cigi-t az alkohol-t és elvégeztem egy Python kurzust a neten amit már az év végén alkalmaztam is a munkahelyemen kisebb projektekben. Emelett rendszeresen edzem és gitározok hobbiként.

Az hogy már maga a Concerta és Ritalin működött az kétségbevonhatattlan. Amenyibben kiépítesz magadnak egy rutint és rendszert akkor a fejlődés úgy érzem garantált. A legnagyobb problémam ezekkel a gyógyszerekkel a hangulatingadozások voltak, néha elképesztően depresszív tud lenni az ember szinte annyira hogy már észreveszi hogy ennek az érzésnek nincs a valósághoz teljesen köze. Lényegében ez motivált arra hogy mihamarabb kipróbáljam a Livizuxot ahogy elérhető nálunk.

Próbáltam listázni a kezdeti élményt órákról – órákra de ez külön tehernek bizonyult és nyűgösnek éreztem magam miatta, ezért elég zavgyva lehet, ennek ellenére bemásolom majd itt alul, ilyen nyers élménynek. A lényeges különbség amit észrevettem hogy nincs ez az ultra bealtatós érzés amennyiben reggelivel együtt veszed be, ugyanúgy működik miközben emésztek, és amennyiben ráfokuszálok egy feladatra abban sokkal mélyebben benne tudok lenni mint előbb.

Aggódtam amiatt is hogy vajon edzeni eltudok e menni majd alatta de tegnap sikeresen letoltam egy lábedzést kb 9 órával az adag bevétele után, és semmi gondom nem volt. Az edzés utáni full ADHD mód ami szokott lenni, nem volt meg. Hazaértem és automatikusan neki álltam mosogatni és főzni, majd lazítás képpen sorozatot néztem (doomscrolling helyett).

* 12:40 - finished the major scale practice, feeling good overall. Started to take photos of my arm because I noticed something like a rash appearing, but not sure if it was always there. I had the same episode with concerta as well where I thought my tongue is swallowed and I panicked my way to the gp and it turned out to be nothing
* 12:52 - finished with chord practice - b diminished to a minor - b min to e - g major (root on the 5th fret) to f# dim - all on 70 bpm for 3 minutes each, it was alright, I’m surprised the guitar still in tune

* 18:20 - almost arrived and I learned most of  Breaking the law by Judas Priest, very easy song though
* 19:22 - got hyperfocused on the bus and registered myself to wigo carsharing because I was upset about how much time it takes to get anywhere in the city. However, this is a false need as this is a luxury and I can’t exactly afford to drive around like this.
* I used wigo carsharing to visit my friends, it was a vibe to drive around in the city and meeting my friends was cool. Socializing was totally fine, and I drove back to home by 23:00. Slept good

I didn't take Livizux the next day since we went for a hike.

So we have a young kitten, Dobby (14-ish weeks now), that came too us way too young. He was born wild and his mother likely died or abandoned him very early on, and he came into our care.

Overall he's adjusting well to the cozy life of a household cat, although he requires a great deal of attention. We're both fine with this and have started all the necessary care and clicker-training to stimulate him as much as necessary. Mostly, we're very happy with our furry friend.

However, my fiance and I seem to have some difficulties with him in the morning. He doesn't sleep with us because his playfulness impedes with our sleep so much that it affects our work. We tried letting him join us in the morning, but he is always horribly behaved as soon as he is in our bedroom. 

We attempt to play with him at that moment and give him the attention he craves, but he often walk away from us while giving off the whiny meow that he also does when he is frustrated or doesn't get his way. We've tried feeding him before, after or leaving him downstairs untill we've had our coffee.

We regularly switch out and introduce new toys for his self-stimulation during the night. Nothing seems to please him when morning comes. Does anyone have any advice how to deal with this specific issue/ moment?

Secondly, he's been destroying electric cables as rapidly as we can repair them. We've ordered some disgusting liquid to smear them with, but any additional prevention advice would be very welcome.

Thanks in advance.

TL;DR: Cat misbehaves in the bedroom in the morning, tips would be much obliged.

Nothing is missing, fortunately, but it's quite frustrating, especially when the payments appear in a different month and screw with my budgeting.

Is it a bug? A known one? Do I write to support?

Thanks for the insight, all!

Me and my partner of 7 years have agreed we might try an open relationship, to see how we feel and how things work out. I am in contact with a guy who showed interest previously, I made sure to let my partner know what we're talking about and when we went out I was 100% transparent about what happened during (nothing sexual or intimate, it was just flirty). I made sure they were ok with everything and stressed that we should make boundaries for what's ok and what's not, I constantly went over how I would like to know if they're on dating sites and if they start talking to anyone. In my head, as long as I have a clear picture of what is going on, there should be no issue with jealousy or negative feelings. Well, today they texted me at work that they didn't want to tell me yesterday, because I was really excited about something (?), but they have been in contaxt with someone for over a week and they're going out for coffee on Sunday and apparently, they (the other person) do know about me. And they did make a dating profile, that's how they got in contact. I felt like I got stabbed in the gut a little because there have been so many opportunities to tell me sooner than after a week of talking? We were at my parents house for the holidays when they were in contact and they're didn't mention a thing, so they have been messaging them on the side and I haven't noticed. What kind of struck me is that on New Years, they very weirdly said that they ""congratulated everyone"" in a tone and a smile I just know alludes to something (I've known them for years, I know the ques), but when I was pressing for what they meant and joking about what ""side girls"" they were messaging, they laughed and said just their mom and male friend. Now I know that they had this contact in mind aswell and left them out on purpose. I know it's small and ridiculous and I shouldn't have tried to open the relationship if I'm feeling a little bettayed over this, but am I really overreacting over this and feeling like they might communicate too poorly for this to work out?

On the way there she asked me if I want to drop by , before I go home , I gave it a second of thinking before saying no , saying I have work tommorow , then a few more seconds pass by and I say :"" you know what I'll just come for a coffee"" as I wanted to see how it would be to be there without drinking .

We got there , she got on the shift  and I sat down at the bar , next to me were a male and a female drinking a beer and a cocktail , and another guy who was drinking soft drinks and smoking weed ..

I sorta found my anchor not being the only alien who isn't drinking at the bar , I ordered a black coffee , lit up a cig , and got off to conversation with the other guy who was sober.

From there I got into a conversation with the man and the woman next to me , they were good friends and the guy was basically chatting to everyone around him , so me and the woman started talking and joking , and it was really fun , some time has passed and she noticed that I'm not drinking any alcohol on a Thursday night ..

I told her I had a busy day , and that I work tommorow so I just popped to breath some fresh air without drinking , she was really impressed by it and said she wouldn't be able to sit at a bar without drinking , we ended up exchanging numbers right before I called it a night ;)

So the moral of the story guys , if you struggle about how you are going to be precieved about going out and not drinking , don't overthink it , you don't have to explain what are your reasons for not drinking .
I also broke the stereotype for myself that you need to drink to loosen up , you can be just as fun and talkative without being drunk , and it actually sets you up to be on your top game when paying attention to woman taking interest in you .

I had a few moments where I was really tempted to order a beer , or anything alcoholic just to feel a little bit better , everytime I had this urge I ordered soda , or cola and remembered that my promiss to myself is much more important rather than being ""cool"" and have a drink.

-Dance (I started dancing while getting my Associates and it's been 8 years since I started dancing. Right now I'm teaching at a dance studio as a side job and have been liking it so far but it's just one class one day a week for 2 hours so the pay is terrible)

Overconfident after Farah Khan's Weekend Ka War? He was the only person who remained unchanged after it. It was Avinash and Eisha who suddenly changed their personalities. People stopped targeting him as much.

It is very clear that this Kashish vs Avinash trial is very personal to him which is why he gets so hyped about it whenever it's brought up - to the extent he wants to fight people's parents. Sushanth Singh Rajput was also falsely accused in #MeToo before his death.

By putting Avinash on a pedestral, Karan has destroyed his game totally. He cannot pick fights with Karan and at the same time cannot hide how much he doesn't want Vivian to shine. If he loved Avinash so much, would he have exposed Avinash for being ""Brutus"" in front of everyone?

1hsidws,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hsidws/omg_kit_has_got_expensive_specifically_electric/,OMG kit has got expensive (specifically electric grinders),"I'm a current aeropress / C2 user looking forward to pulling some espresso when I finish my espesso machine build.

My favourite beans are a fairly middle of the road med roast Brazilian (acually quite dark to me) espresso blend from my local roaster Chimney Fire. It's very similar to the caff / decaf Brazilian which is a staple at Monmouth Coffee (for you UK peeps). Flavour is in the nutty chocolatey region.

I'm nearing the end of a Gaggiauino build that I've been slowly progressing since my in-laws gifted me a Gaggia Baby Dose (internally similar to Classic Pro)

So I'll soon have a machine, but oh my have grinders got expensive since I started the build some 2+ years ago.

I did use the Gaggia Baby stock (attempting to temp surf) with my C2, the 36 clicks mod and a hand drill - results were... interesting. Then the gaggia cracked its boiler and got put to the back of the workshop.

Looking at grinders after a good 2+ years  I have two issues:

1. Everything has moved, my previous research highlighted a Sage Smart Grinder (even folks at the roaster used this at home - but they know what they are doing with other parameters I guess) - but now that isn't popular and budget electric grinders have competition from the K4 / K6 and the like, which weren't around before.

That helps me, because I have very little counter space for a big electric grinder - my Gaggia will be in / out of a cupboard rotating with the rice cooker and bread maker.

2. Electric grinders are way more expensive. Maybe I was just at the end of the covid cafe closures, but ""cafe"" grinders (Luigi etc) could be found for under £100. 

I'm now seriously considering selling the Gaggia when it's finished, as I think the hobby might have got too expensive for me.

I know ""buy once, cry once"" but £150+ for a grinder just to get started with my fancy machine gives me (and my bank manager)the shivers. Especially as that's just the starting point.

- Hubby has gone away 4 times on 2-3 days fishing trips in the last 10 months.
- I have had 1 x 6hrs to myself since our bub was born as I work part time and have since 2wks postpartum and solo care for bub the other days.
- We both pay our outgoings with hubby paying an extra $200 because I’m working 30-50% less now.
- Hubby is great with the household chores. He doesn’t need told and has initiative. I do majority though when bubs sleeps as I’m home plus the grocery shopping, cooking, sorting out the animals and their food delivery and well organising all our lives. 
- As soon as I’m home from work I have the baby attached to me. It’s like I come home and “default parent” is home so hubby will go do whatever and just assume I’ll be with the baby.. I don’t think hubby realises that I get no break until I sleep.
- I feel disgusting. I look unrecognisable and I don’t know how he doesn’t care about my appearance enough to allow me enough time to even shower long enough to wash my hair or workout or just have a coffee uninterrupted. 
- I feel resentment forming I think that’s what it is.. but then remind myself how he has built us a home with literally his bare hands so he deserves the break and weekends away fishing with the guys. It’s just I work hard too.. at work & home. 
- I usually sort bub in the mornings especially if he is doing childcare drop off as he is never on time so this atleast helps him out the door faster. He is then back home for approx 2-2.5hrs before bubs sleep at night but he will shower and then bathe Bub while I cook dinner so again, no stopping for me.

I just think I need to hear someone else’s opinion, and what I’m really looking for is validation, I think. 

Right after we found out my dad died, my sister decided to drive to our grandparents to tell them. She was horrible on the way there, and I just sort of dissociated to cope with being in the same car with her. When we arrived, she asked if I wanted to go in with her. 

I hadn’t spoken to my grandparents in 10 years, and they’d always hated me and been abusive to me as a child - my sister was the favourite. I barely spoke to my sister, and I was scared to go in there alone with her. Because she hates me too. And ya know, I also found out 30 minutes ago my dad died and my brain was overwhelmed by confusion & grief. But I said: ‘tell me what you want, do you want me to be there?’ My sister then said: ‘No, you need to decide what you want.’ And my mother agreed. I said: ‘well, I just want to be helpful, so if you want me there I’ll go.’ I was absolutely fawning and also just terrified of both of them. My sister then got sort of angry and said: ‘you really just need to do what feels right for you right now.’ So I said: ‘okay, then I don’t want to go.’ My sister simply said ‘okay.’ 

So she went in, and I got out the car and sat in a field nearby and cried. 

This is what constantly happened with my mother & sister, while men enabled them. This was brought up later as evidence for why I was a terrible person. I didn’t go in with my sister when she needed me, I let her handle everything on her own, how selfish, how horrible. In the weeks after his death, this was only some of the material used to continue to make me the scapegoat. Defending myself was useless, and only made it worse. My mother would always say things like ‘but you knew I meant yes when I said no.’ She’d literally say: ‘no I don’t want coffee’ and I somehow was meant to know that meant yes. She’d call me a liar, I was doing it on purpose. 

And this is also one reason I’ve wondered if I’m autistic. Because no, I don’t know. I never knew. I didn’t pretend. All I did was try to read my mother’s and sister’s mind, to prevent more abuse. Are these social cues I was missing? Is that part of it? Or was it really just all manipulation? I used to set myself on fire to keep them warm, so if they asked me for help, to do something, I did it, I obeyed. I abandonded myself, I ignored my own boundaries, I put them first. And for a long time, I fell for the manipulation and believed I was a terrible person. So I would’ve done anything. Trying to prove them wrong, trying to be a good sister & daughter. 

What I’ve noticed is that in my new life, without them, this has never happened. In fact, I’ve been told I read into things when I shouldn’t. I complicate things by not taking people at their word. There must be something behind it, there’s another secret language I’m not picking up. In the past, I’ve often been scared a yes means no and vice versa. 

When they told me I had to do what felt right, I took their word for it. In my mind, I did what they asked. In those weeks after his death, my sister also began calling me manipulative. And that was one of the things that woke me up. She was being manipulative, and she switched the blame. Just like my mother had always done. This isn’t the only manipulative thing she did during that time, it was constant. 

I know my mother is narcissistic and abusive, I know my sister probably is too. I’m not at the beginning of figuring this stuff out, I’ve healed a lot, I’m NC. But at the time, I had no one to talk to. And so, for ten years, I’ve wondered about what happened after my dad’s death, and in that car and after it - was I wrong? I don’t think I was. But I guess it’s still hard to believe the alternative. That someone would manipulate their younger sister like that, that a mother joins in, that my brother in law supported my sister once again, that it’s used against me by the whole family - that it still is. That it goes on the pile of reasons to hate me. 

The questions I kept asking myself for so long, that still linger, are: what did I do wrong? What could I have done differently? Was none of it my fault? Did I deserve all the hate I got for it? And the ultimate question I’ll never be able to answer: if this is all them, why? Why did they do it?

Even though I know my family is awful, this in particular feels so cruel that it’s hard to process, I guess. So the doubt has never gone away. I hope this post isn’t too long, I tried to keep it short but I failed, I think. ",1,1735893161.0,CPTSD,2,1.0,False

1. Counter-clockwise; start from Tokyo station
2. Have a big meal every 10 stations 
3. Protein calorie / coffee break every 90 min (I’m doing omad so didn’t want to do sugar) 
4. Use my long distance running shoes 
5. Stretch every time I hit a red light 
6. Nice salt bath at the end

I believe it’s intentional. For instance, if I don’t serve him coffee but I make it.. he’ll pout when I ask him to make his own, he’ll literally say he doesn’t know how to make it, and then he’ll make a mess on purpose. This is a 40 yr old man that makes his own coffee at gas stations on a regular basis. Same goes for cooking and sometimes when he’s cleaning. 
Today he made me so upset when he volunteered to go pick up lunch.. asked me to send him the order, I even screenshot it and typed out exactly how he needs to order! When he came back our youngest asked for something in particular and to my surprise he says… I didn’t get that! I said of course you did I sent the details like you asked. Did you read them? He goes back to look and says oh that doesn’t specify. I said I sent you a photo and it has the details. I didn’t even want to make eye contact with him because I knew he’d blow up and play victim. My youngest calmly says it’s ok I like this.. even though I know she doesn’t. And our oldest also doesn’t eat that. He should know this. But he doesn’t care to know what everyone likes. He made a mistake and we have to deal. It’s like he doesn’t even try with us there’s no effort. BUT If I had gotten his order wrong! That would be another story. 

All this to say I think it’s intentional. So that I can’t count on him. So that I just do it myself.

i do know medical jobs in general are constantly in demand forever, but i understand that a degree is needed to become one? i'm worried that the route to becoming one would be much longer and less cost-efficient, which might take a toll on my living situation


💬 translator

i'm multilingual and have always loved languages in general! i was suggested to learn mandarin and arabic alongside too, so i'm willing to go down this path, probably for call centres or any other translation jobs! are there in-house jobs for translators though, or would it be mostly freelance?

With thoughtful design choices and the right [home decor](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/), you can make even the tiniest home feel spacious, functional, and inviting. From clever storage solutions to strategic [wall decoration](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/wall-hanging-decorations), here are some big ideas to transform your small spaces into chic, cozy retreats.

# 1. Maximize Space with a Wall Mirror

Mirrors are a small-space decorator’s best friend. A well-placed [wall mirror](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/mirrors) can make a room feel larger and brighter by reflecting light and creating the illusion of depth.

**Tips for Using Wall Mirrors:**

* Place a large mirror opposite a window to amplify natural light.
* Use a series of smaller mirrors as a [decorative item for the living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration), adding texture and style to your walls.
* Choose mirrors with ornate frames for a dual purpose—functionality and artistic wall decoration.

# 2. Choose Multifunctional Furniture

In compact homes, furniture that serves multiple purposes is key. Opt for ottomans with hidden storage, foldable dining tables, or a sofa bed that doubles as guest seating. This approach ensures your space remains clutter-free without compromising on style.

# 3. Vertical Storage is Your Friend

When floor space is limited, look up! Utilize vertical storage solutions like floating shelves, tall bookcases, or hanging racks. Not only do these free up valuable floor space, but they also provide opportunities for wall decoration.

**Design Idea:** Add a few carefully selected decorative items for the living room, like small plants, photo frames, or vases, to give your vertical storage a personal touch.

# 4. Incorporate Light Colors and Reflective Surfaces

Light, neutral colors make small spaces appear more open and airy. Incorporate reflective materials like glass and metallic finishes to enhance the effect. Pair a light-colored rug with glossy surfaces to create a cohesive and expansive look.

# 5. Create Zones with Rugs and Decor

Even in small spaces, defining zones can make your home feel organized and functional. Use rugs to separate a living area from a workspace or dining corner. Add decorative items for the living room that reflect your personality, such as framed art, sculptures, or accent pillows.

**Styling Tip:** Stick to a consistent color palette across zones to maintain harmony and avoid visual clutter.

# 6. Think Big with Small Decor

Just because your space is small doesn’t mean you have to skimp on decor. Large, bold pieces like oversized artwork, statement lighting, or a dramatic wall mirror can create a focal point and make your home feel luxurious.

# 7. Optimize Your Walls

Walls in small spaces are untapped real estate. Beyond traditional shelving, consider unique wall decoration ideas such as:

* A gallery wall with a mix of photos, art, and mirrors.
* Hanging planters for a touch of greenery.
* Pegboards for customizable and stylish storage.

# 8. Choose Decorative Items that Double as Functional Pieces

Every item in a small space should earn its keep. Look for decor that serves a purpose, such as decorative baskets for storage or elegant trays for organizing coffee table essentials.

**Smart Picks:** Select items that enhance your home decor without overwhelming the space, like small sculptures, candle holders, or a sleek vase for fresh flowers.

# 9. Let There Be Light

Lighting plays a vital role in creating a warm and inviting small space. Layer different lighting sources, such as pendant lights, floor lamps, and wall sconces. Avoid heavy, dark shades and instead opt for light fixtures with clean lines and a touch of elegance.

# 10. Bring the Outdoors In

Even a small home can benefit from natural elements. Introduce plants, wooden accents, or woven textures to add warmth and character to your space. Use hanging planters or small potted plants to incorporate greenery without taking up floor space.

# Final Thoughts

Decorating small spaces is all about balance—combining functionality with aesthetics. By incorporating smart design choices like a wall mirror, versatile furniture, and thoughtful wall decoration, you can create a home that feels both stylish and spacious. Don't forget to add personal touches with decorative items for the living room that make your space uniquely yours.

1hshmg0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hshmg0,"(Review) A superb combo! Aldi Vanilla, Trader Joe’s Coffee, Private Selection Pumpkin Cheesecake, and Costco pumpkin streusel muffins! ","Got to visit somewhere which had Aldi, Kroger and Trader Joe’s nearby. Finally got to try some ice cream which I’ve heard so much about on the sub! 

##Aldi Specially Selected - Vanilla (super premium), $5-6, 48 oz
“Super premium” is not just a marketing term, but a protected term for a class of ice cream that has 14-16% milk fat and low overrun (air). 

This vanilla Aldi ice cream in the black carton lives up to the super premium claim with perhaps the smoothest, cleanest melt I’ve experienced. The milk fat coats the tongue and the vanilla taste is mild and simple, like the original Haagen Dazs Vanilla, which has been compared to a sweet cream flavor (ice cream without additional flavor). The mere five ingredients list also invites comparison with Haagen Dazs, known for their short ingredients list and inclusion or egg yolks. 

Haagen Dazs - Vanilla: 
> Cream, Skim Milk, Cane Sugar, Egg Yolks, Ground Vanilla Beans, Vanilla Extract.

Specially Selected - Vanilla: 
> Cream, Nonfat Milk, Cane Syrup, Egg yolks, Vanilla. 

While perhaps not having as much vanilla flavor as Haagen Dazs, I think Specially Selected Vanilla has a gorgeous texture that’s rare to find in this price range. Maybe it’s not the most exciting in itself, but I would definitely get it again with the mind to add toppings because of its pleasant, neutral taste, or make a milkshake because of its high milk fat content. 

Note: I included a pic of Aldi Vanilla ice cream vs Private Selection Pumpkin cheesecake ice cream to show just how smooth and air pocket free the Aldi ice cream is. So smooth! 

RATING: 9/10!   

##Kroger Private Selection - New York Style Pumpkin Cheesecake, $5 sale price ($7.49 retail), 48 oz 
_Description: Pumpkin ice cream with New York Style Cheesecake pieces (plain flavor)._
* Pumpkin ice cream: As a lover of pumpkin ice cream, this one delights as it has pumpkin purée that I can taste and a good amount of spice, while maintaining that milky, pumpkin pie flavor. However, the texture is somewhat gummy for Private Selection ice cream. Not bad. 
* Cheesecake pieces: Had a good amount of sizable cheesecake chunks. Some small, some large. Some pieces did not have much flavor while others were delectable bites of cream cheese. A variable experience, but pleasant in the end. 

RATING: 7/10. Not the most consistent ice cream, but a relatively good experience of cheesecake when there is not that much on the market. A nice pumpkin flavor as well. Was excellent with some pumpkin muffin, walnuts and whipped cream—I think it needed the textural dimension. 

##Trader Joe’s - Coffee Bean Blast (super premium), $4.49, 32 oz 
Another “super premium” ice cream at a very affordable price! This ice cream is interesting as it has the highest milk fat (calories) and lowest overrun of the bunch. It freezes harder but when it melts it is a bit more sorbet in texture than the others. 

The ice cream is a strong coffee flavor with the look of coffee grounds in the ice cream, but the coffee grounds does not have any gritty texture like Ben and Jerry’s Change is Good ice cream had. Some including myself enjoy a bit of grit, but others don’t, so I’m making that note. 

The strength of the coffee is like a bold, medium roast coffee with a bright, acidic flavor. To me it is more like a cup of coffee than an ice cream. I enjoy coffee with my muffins and this ice cream was a nice substitute to have with my pumpkin or chocolate chip muffin from Costco. 

RATING: 9/10! An excellent value that I’d totally get again. I was looking for a bold coffee flavor, and this one is right up my alley. For reference I do like Haagen Dazs Coffee, but just wanted something a little bolder. 

##Combinations & Toppings
I liked all these ice creams individually, but together they made an excellent combination with a few additions I had:
* Whipped cream. Complemented the coffee and pumpkin cheesecake very well. 
* Costco Pumpkin Streusel Muffins variety pack (the pumpkin muffin added a kick of spice and the texture of its crumble topping). Sometimes I had this pumpkin muffin and the cream cheese flavor of the cheesecake in the Kroger ice cream in the same bite which was heaven. 
* Aldi Bakers Corner Mini Semi Sweet Chocolate Morsels. Baking chocolate, but tastes good. I liked the mini size. 
* Sahale Snacks Pomegranate flavored Pistachios Glazed Mix. Had cranberries and almonds for fruity sweetness and a nice crunch. Gave my ice cream bowl an autumnal twist. 
* Walnuts and other nuts mix. Mmm walnuts. 

##Related ice cream:
* Haagen Dazs - Vanilla. A very good neutral vanilla ice cream that leans towards sweet cream. https://www.reddit.com/r/icecream/s/mt8lqyj3sr
* Aldi Specially Selected - Chocolate (super premium). Also excellent, melt in your mouth texture with not the most flavor. A nice base for toppings at the right price.  https://www.reddit.com/r/icecream/s/gtiA1BtBLG
* Haagen Dazs - Coffee. A nicely balanced ice cream with good milk fat taste and a roasted coffee quality.  https://www.reddit.com/r/icecream/s/wpr1WaglYz
