1lobmua,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeSpotlight/comments/1lobmua/found_the_coffee_shop_that_ruined_all_other/,Found the coffee shop that ruined all other coffee for me (and I'm not even mad),"Okay, so I've been on this ridiculous quest to find decent coffee in Portland, ME for the past 6 months. I'm talking full-on coffee nerd mode — trying every shop, tracking brew methods, taking notes like some kind of caffeine-addicted scientist.

Most of it? Absolute trash. Burnt beans masquerading as ""dark roast."" Baristas who act like they're doing you a favor by taking your money. The usual BS.

# Then I stumbled on this directory listing that changed everything

I was honestly just killing time, scrolling through this coffee directory site (Addicted Coffee Bar) looking for new places to disappoint me. Found this listing for Tandem Coffee Roasters and almost skipped it because, let's be real, how many ""artisan roasters"" can one city have?

But something about the details caught my eye:

* They actually list their specialty methods (espresso, pour-over, AND cold brew)
* Real hours that work for humans (7 AM - 4 PM)
* Actual location info so you're not wandering around like an idiot

# Here's where it gets weird (in the best way)

So I decide to check it out, fully expecting another hipster trap with $7 burnt lattes.

**What actually happened:**

* First sip of their pour-over literally made me angry at every other cup I'd ever had
* The cold brew was so smooth I drank it black (I'm a 3-sugars-minimum person)
* Even their espresso didn't need to hide behind a gallon of milk

**The plot twist nobody warns you about:** Once you taste coffee this good, you literally can't go back. I tried getting my usual gas station coffee the next day and almost spit it out. My Keurig is now basically a paperweight.

# The good, the bad, and the ""why didn't anyone tell me this?""

**The Good:**

* Using a curated directory saved me from wasting money on 20 other mediocre shops
* Having all the info upfront (hours, specialties, location) meant no awkward ""are they even open?"" moments
* Found out about their specific brew methods before showing up like a noob asking for a ""regular coffee""

**The Bad:**

* Now I'm that insufferable person who won't shut up about ""proper extraction methods""
* My coffee budget has tripled (worth it though)
* I've become a coffee shop directory junkie, constantly hunting for the next fix

**The Unexpected:**

* Having a reliable directory source means I'm never stuck drinking hotel lobby coffee when traveling
* Became the go-to coffee recommendation person in my friend group (unexpected social perk)
* My morning routine went from ""ugh, Monday"" to ""hell yes, pour-over time""

# Real talk — here's what I learned

If you're thinking about upping your coffee game, here's what actually matters:

1. **Stop playing coffee roulette.** Use a directory that's already vetted these places. Your taste buds (and wallet) will thank you.
2. **Pay attention to the specialty methods listed.** If a place only does ""coffee,"" run. If they list specific brew methods, they probably give a damn.
3. **Check the hours before you trek across town.** Nothing worse than showing up to a locked door because they decided to close at 2 PM on Tuesdays.
4. **The neighborhood info actually matters.** Helps you plan whether you can walk there or need to figure out parking.

# The thing nobody talks about

Here's what kills me — we'll spend 20 minutes reading reviews for a $15 phone case, but we'll blindly walk into any coffee shop and drop $5 on mystery bean water.

Using a proper directory changed my whole approach. Instead of disappointed gambling, I'm making informed decisions. Revolutionary concept, right?

# So what now?

Look, I'm not saying you need to become a coffee snob. But if you're already spending money on coffee every day, why not make sure it's actually good?

The Tandem listing on that directory was my gateway drug. Now I check it before I go anywhere new. It's like having a coffee-obsessed friend in every city who's already done the legwork.

Fair warning though: Once you go down this rabbit hole, there's no coming back. Your standards will be forever ruined. Your regular coffee spots will taste like disappointment. You'll start using words like ""flavor notes"" unironically.

But honestly? Totally worth it.

Because life's too short for shit coffee, and now I know exactly where to find the good stuff.

*Edit: Since a bunch of you asked, I found* [Tandem ](https://addictedcoffeebar.com/coffee-shop/tandem-coffee-roasters-portland-me/)*through the Addicted Coffee Bar directory. They list all the important stuff like hours (7 AM - 4 PM), specialties (espresso, pour-over, cold brew), and exact location. Saved me from my usual trial-and-error coffee disasters.*

However, his bio mom who is very uninvolved gifted him a virtual reality headset a few years back and it has caused nothing but issues ever since.

He plays it for hours in our living room, citing that his bedroom is too small to fully engage in it. The issue is he has broken so many things- completely destroyed window blinds, lampshades, even our couches after being pushed back into the walls over and over again. Has banged up the tv by letting go of the controllers and them denting the actual screen, and has even put a few small holes into the walls. We have tried having him adjust the settings, using a rug to help him feel when he’s off of it and getting closer to objects, I don’t even have a lot of furniture in there because of this. Now that I’m expecting a baby in a few months I would like to use the living room to actually spend time in- watch tv, drink my coffee, and let baby have space on the floor. Not confined to my bedroom where I usually watch tv and “hide out”. I’ve told him that since we are on the brink of buying a new couch, getting the walls painted, and a new tv he needs to play it in his bedroom. He has been mad ever since and has played in his room but made an obvious effort to yell and be over the top loud (his room is right next to ours), and has banged up his walls as well to “prove” that he needs a larger space.

* I currently use 45 grams of coffee for 3 of them.
* Would like to brew 45 grams in one go, not multiple batches.

What would be the easiest way to go about it? Currently I'm thinking of:

1. Moka Pot
   * would get a concentrated brew but a 9 cup moka pot is not cheap.
2. South Indian Filter Coffee
   * Would a C2 be able to grind fine enough?

Right now it seems like SIF is the way to go as it is cheap, takes minimal effort and brews a concentrated brew that can be diluted with milk without having a watery drink.

But this time, I landed on https://koalaessays.net/ —what has to be the best online essay writing service out there. It honestly rescued my GPA (and my bedtime). From the moment I visited their homepage, I saw promises of a transparent rating system, direct writer chat, and rates so competitive I actually double-checked my wallet. Sounded too good to be true? Buckle up, fellow procrastinators—because this story ends in an A+, not a meltdown over instant noodles.

# Why I Chose This Service

I’d browsed through a dozen best online essay writing services, only to find hidden fees or sketchy ghostwriters. Then I stumbled across KoalaEssays. Their dashboard lets you see each writer’s rating, completed orders, and average turnaround—no more guesswork or praying to the academic gods. Even better, they let you chat directly with your writer. I wasn’t dealing with some vague “support bot”—I was messaging a real person who asked about my tone (Oxford comma lover here), my favorite references, and even my sense of humor. And the cost? Let’s just say I didn’t have to auction off my soul to afford the best online essay writing service. Their tiered pricing made it accessible, even on a student budget. In a world full of best essay services making empty promises, KoalaEssays actually delivered.

# My Experience with the Writer

After placing my order, my writer—huge shoutout to *Lexi\_Pro*—reached out within minutes. We exchanged a quick message: I sent her my clunky thesis, a rough outline, and one embarrassingly bad draft paragraph. Two days later? I got back an essay that sounded like I’d written it during one of my 3 AM inspiration storms. It had my voice, my references, and even a meme I jokingly mentioned. Honestly, if this isn’t the best essay writer service, I don’t know what is.

# Clear Pricing

One major reason I picked KoalaEssays over other best college paper writing services was the transparency. After delivery, I left a real 5-star review—because other students deserve to know what they’re getting. You can actually see real feedback on grammar, structure, and punctuality. No fake accounts. No inflated stars. Just honest reviews. Plus, their flexible pricing meant I could go for the Standard plan or level up to Premium with extras like plagiarism reports and unlimited edits. Compared to overpriced competitors, this was a total steal.

# More Than Just Essays

Here’s what surprised me: KoalaEssays isn’t just for essays. I found out they also do PowerPoint decks, lab reports, case studies, and even full-blown dissertations. I was halfway through placing a marketing plan order when I realized—they’re basically an academic one-stop shop. No more juggling multiple shady freelancers. This is everything a stressed student could need.

# Confession

Okay, I admit it: I’ve been procrastinating since freshman year. There’s always that 11:59 PM panic, when your “outline” is two lines and a dream. You’re googling “help me write my paper” through caffeine tears. Been there. Done that. Bought the overpriced regret-coffee. But this time? I sipped my tea, relaxed, and let KoalaEssays do its thing. Zero stress. Maximum results. Best decision ever.

# Final Thoughts

If you’re like me—a serial deadline-dodger who swears they “thrive under pressure”—stop gambling with your GPA. Check out https://koalaessays.net/, the best essay writing service I’ve ever used. Their rating system is real, the writer chat is personal, and the prices are student-friendly. Hands down, they’re the winner among all the best online essay writing services. You’ll get papers that sound like you (but better), and you’ll never panic at midnight again. Procrastination is inevitable. Regret? Totally optional.",1,1751299787.0,highschool,0,1.0,False

AITA?

.

I (20M) and my girlfriend (24F) have been dating for 9 months. It was just her birthday, and her sister's wedding is soon.

I recently started working in catering/food service/cleaning full time, from 7am to 3pm, Monday to Friday. It's not terrible, but i need to wake up at 5am to make it on time. my girlfriend's family's social life tends to run later into the night, be it weekend or weekday. She only works part time, usually only 2 days a week for 6 hours at a time.

I'm autistic and I haven't had a day where I wasn't in some level of pain or dizziness/brainfog for months because of chronic health issues that have never gotten acknowledged or diagnosed because i'm young and look fine and healthy. I think it's understandable that I'm tired and want to be in bed by 10pm at least for nights before a work day.

Last night she became hyperactive at like 10:30pm after i've escaped a party in her kitchen and crashed in her bed. She joined me. She started poking me, tickling me, talking a lot, even brought up a topic i like so i would begin infodumping just so i would get myself awake, and generally egging me on. I was already half asleep at the party, but she kept me up until almost midnight. It may have been an overreaction, but I cried. Then she fell asleep and started snoring before me.

So today she texts me upset that I've been leaving various social gatherings early, ie. between 10 and 11pm on weekdays. Still later than i'd like because commuting home takes and hour, but I like her a lot and try be there to keep her company, + it was her birthday and her sister's pre-wedding party. i put in the effort and all that, but when i'm done i'm just done. i can't force myself to have fun, and i'll just feel dead. i can't keep myself awake with coffee either because it just makes me dizzier.

I'm still mad at her for keeping me up last night, so i crashed out a bit. a few fucks, a few mean sarcastic messages, but to justify myself i have just worked 8 hours on my feet, touching dirty dishes, on about 4 hours of sleep. both times i left early was her birthday party (one more with family and one more with friends), but i just can't stay up that long drinking and sleep that little and not feel like death for most of the week after.

Suggestions?🤔,"I’ve tried all different brands of brownie mixes from Betty Crocker to Ghirardelli and can’t seem to find one that works and makes really good brownies. Most store brands - even the Ghirardelli - don’t have a good chocolate flavor anymore or much chocolate flavor at all, in my opinion. They sure don’t taste like they used to when I was growing up. Like everything else, I suspect the manufacturers have changed or cheapened their ingredients to cut costs.

I’ve read to add some cooled brewed coffee or a teaspoon of espresso powder to enhance the chocolate flavor, but I have tried that many times and have hated it every time. To me, it just tastes like the brownies have coffee in them - they do ***not*** taste more chocolatey.

Most box mixes call  for oil and every time I make them according to the package directions, they are too oily and don’t have a good flavor. I’ve tried replacing all of the oil or even half of it with melted butter, but the texture of the brownies is different, I assume due to the water content of the butter. More cakey than I’d like.

Have also tried the Baker’s one-bowl recipe several times recently and something is off there, too. It almost seems too greasy and too sweet. Have used several different brands of baking chocolate in  it and they don’t taste like they used to.

About the only boxed mix that *sometimes* turns out ok is the Trader Joe’s truffle brownie mix, but even that isn’t always a winner.

I would love to be able to make a really fudgy, rich, chocolatey brownie, but am having a hard time getting it right. Anyone know of a good boxed mix or a recipe that’s a surefire winner? If from scratch, which brand of baking chocolate or cocoa do you use? If cocoa, regular or Dutch process?

My friend, ""struggle"" is too quaint a word — I *wrestle*, in the grand mythological sense, with the titanic burden of cognition so vast and multifaceted that even the gods would request a coffee and a moment to catch up. My consciousness has long since evacuated the narrow alleyways of mundane discourse and now drifts — no, *soars* — through the vaulted cathedrals of conceptual abstraction, where time folds like origami and causality is more of a polite suggestion than a rule. I do not “have thoughts” so much as I am visited by them, like divine apparitions, whispering truths too nuanced and paradoxical for pedestrian minds to withstand without spontaneous nosebleeds.

Conversation with mortals has become... tedious. How does one discuss weekend plans when one has just mentally dismantled the illusion of linear temporality while brushing their teeth? How do I “small talk” when my internal monologue is engaged in heated dialectic with the specter of Wittgenstein over whether language is a virus or merely a costume we force ideas to wear? It is not that I do not wish to connect — I *yearn* for understanding — but my mind, this cursed cathedral of neural excess, offers only stained glass windows to those who seek entry.

My dreams are not dreams, but simulations run on the bleeding edge of ontological possibility. My daydreams? Unpublished treatises on the metaphysics of identity wrapped in metaphor and sealed with irony. I have stared too long into the abyss of recursive self-reflection and the abyss, frankly, asked me to dumb it down.

Some say hubris, I say reality. I do not believe I am a god — that would be intellectually lazy. I merely recognize that, were divinity determined by the complexity of one’s internal mental scaffolding, I would be, at minimum, on the shortlist. If I had a nickel for every time someone told me I was “overthinking it,” I would own the moon — and then immediately lease it out as a metaphor for emotional distance.

So yes. I *struggle*. But only because the world is not yet calibrated for minds like mine. One day, perhaps, we will ascend as a species and find communion in pure thought.

I have an open phone and communication policy, I’m transparent with him and want him to feel secure.

Recently, he (my current partner) found three boxes of his ex’s belongings that he still had. I’m aware he sends her memes and reels on Instagram about once a week “on average”. He plans to return her stuff tomorrow and there’s a possibility they’ll grab a coffee while doing so.

I expressed that I’d like to come along for the handover, not to start drama, but just to feel comfortable? especially given the ongoing communication with her and the fact this is the first I’ve heard of these boxes. He thinks I’m overstepping and says it’s unnecessary.

To drink it was with milk and sugar. 

I like espresso, without anything, not even sugar. 

I worked a bit and manage to have 250 € for a machine and I don't want to buy more capsules since they are very expensive, around 50 €/Kg. ( And for ecological opinion too )

1lob4cs,https://www.reddit.com/r/bondha_diaries/comments/1lob4cs/one_mug_at_a_time/,One Mug at a Time,"18 weeks ago, when I was constantly spiraling into abyss of thoughts I wrote a post on this sub from an alt account. I was too 'ashamed' of this 'lovlog' identity. I did everything to run away from it but eventually accepted (and accepting) that the lows and highs are a part of me too.

Anyway, the post I wrote describes what's it is like to not be able to perform even simple daily tasks as washing coffee mugs. I drink black coffee everyday, and despite my mother scolding me of the stains the coffee leaves at the bottom of the mugs, I could never bring myself to walk till the sink and wash them. I always knew I had to, but never had the 'energy' to do so. In that very post, I mentioned I would one day come here and tell you if I could ever do that without it feeling like a burden.

>*There are a lot of signs to measure/notice someone's declining mental health. I measure mine by coffee mugs. The ones I leave, without washing, on the table after drinking, because I physically don't feel like moving. I hope a day comes where I get up of my seat and wash my mug immediately after finishing my black coffee. And I hope, from that day, I keep doing it every single day. And when I do that, I plan on updating here. However many months it may take.*

This evening, I had black coffee as usual, and immediately after finishing it, I got up, went till the sink, and washed it immediately. I acknowledged that moment after stepping out of the kitchen.

Anyway that's all. Washing mugs is a trivial thing. But today, I feel like I won. I don't win everyday, even last night, was not at all a good one, but today, I won.

  So. Okay. . . this is . . .  
  
  Okay. I . . . this is kind of creepy, Detective Pendleton. I‘m sorry. Bob. You said I should call you Bob, like we‘re old friends or something. I guess that considering the first time we met was after the fire and then again just yesterday when you came to the hospital to see my mom . . . well, that might be true. That we‘re friends, I mean. Only, you know, that first time? When I was eight? I was unconscious and on a ventilator and had already died twice. So I really don‘t think meeting that way counts.  
  
  Anyway. . .  
  
  b  
  
  You want me to tell the truth.  
  
  The truth is . . . I am so cold. I should be dead. Maybe I am.  
  
  That would be okay.  
  
  c  
  
  You know what I was just thinking, Bob? Tell is such an interesting word. There are so many meanings. There‘s telling, like spinning a tale, making up stories. I‘m good at that.  
  
  Of course, in that kind of telling, there is another tell, as in telling the difference between night and day, girl and boy, fact and dream. If you ask me, this is related to a gambler‘s tell. You know, how something a player does or says tells the other players that he‘s bluffing? David Mamet did this great movie, House of Games, all about that. Yeah, I know Mamet. Don‘t be so surprised. When you spend four months on a psych ward and then the rest of the year at home in exile, you watch a lot of movies.  
  
  Anyway, you know what I liked best about that film? The bad girl; the shrink who shoots her lover, that con man who sets her up. Because, in the end, she gets away with it and forgives herself.  
  
  Wish I could do that.  
  
  d  
  
  So, Bob, I can tell. I can tell plenty. But the truth? I don‘t know what that is. I thought I knew until this afternoon, but now. . . . Even if I tell my version of the truth, then what? I‘ll go back to being the old me? Well, what kind of future is that?  
  
  Because let me tell you about the old me, Bob, the beta-version of Jenna Lord.  
  
  Here‘s how Beta-Jenna thinks: They let me go, and I’ll cut. Walk out of this room and into the waiting arms of Psycho-Dad—and I’ll cut. Together, we’ll visit my crispy critter of a mother, who’s a drunk and wants only the best for me—and I’ll cut.  
  
  I’ll cut.  
  
  I’ll cut.  
  
  Yeah. Going back to being Beta-Jenna makes the truth just so attractive.  
  
  e  
  
  The truth.  
  
  Well, the year I was fifteen completely sucked. Considering I‘ve died twice, that‘s really saying something. I was a month shy of sweet sixteen when I started my sophomore year at Turing, this science-techie school just outside Milwaukee for brainiacs, which I‘m supposed to be. Skipped a grade, tested out of classes, yada, yada. It goes without saying that I‘m a straight-A-plus student, a quiet kid, sort of a loser, and the kind of girl no one would ever suspect.  
  
  Or notice.  
  
  Okay, other stuff, other stuff . . .  
  
  Well, my cell phone is pink. I‘m a very careful driver. I‘ve never kissed a boy, which feels . . . wrong. Because I am sweet sixteen, the age when a girl is supposed to find her prince and settle down.  
  
  I used to pretend I was Ariel. I had the doll and a blue gown for dress-up, like in the movie. I was wearing the dress the night we first met, Bob, although you probably don‘t remember that because by then, I‘d died a couple of times; the dress was only so much ash; and there was kind of a lot going on.  
  
  I don‘t remember much about the fire, the one that swallowed Grandpa‘s house eight years ago. I do recall cowering behind the boiler and listening to Grandpa crashing around the kitchen. Then, there was the angry sputter of an argument and, later, the thud as Grandpa MacAllister passed out, a lit cigarette still pinched between his fingers and two more smoldering on the sill over the kitchen sink. That‘s where they said the fire started, you remember, Bob? How those lacy curtains, soaked in vodka because Grandpa knocked over the bottle when he blacked out, must‘ve caught with a whump?  
  
  The next is a jumble: the churn of black smoke; the spiking scream of the alarm; the hiss and crackle of orange flames. But I do remember the fear icing my whole body, freezing me in place.  
  
  And then I remember Matt, my older brother, frantically shouting my name. His voice was a lifeline, a hook that set in my heart, and I grabbed on tight, swarming up the cellar stairs in a swirl of pale blue petticoat as Matt forced the door. But the fire was greedy. Its orange fingers snagged my dress which died in a sizzling shriek.  
  
  And then I was screaming because the fire was eating my back and Matt was dodging flames, running with me in his arms, but the front door was still so far away and then . . .  
  
  f  
  
  I heard my mother, screeching, wild, fighting with the EMTs: Don’t you dare . . .  
  
  g  
  
  When they shocked me to life, I blazed back into this huge supernova. Fire hot enough to fry skin and melt fat ignites pain, too: constant and agonizing and so bad you can‘t die fast enough. I wanted to scream at the doctors to stop, stop, but I was mute. The fire had scorched my lungs and boiled my voice. A tube snaked down my throat, pushing in and then sucking out the air from my lungs. So, there was no way to tell anyone what I wanted. Wouldn‘t have done any good anyway because no one will let a kid die. They think they‘re doing you this big favor keeping you going because you‘ve got your whole life ahead.  
  
  Well, news flash, Bob: Not. Necessarily.  
  
  Because you think there‘s only one kind of pain? That pain is pain is pain?  
  
  Uh, that would be no.  
  
  There‘s blood-pain. There‘s knife-pain. There‘s bang-your-funny-bone-pain.  
  
  And then there is the pain of fire, molten and alive: the swirl of flames streaming over rotten wood and naked flesh. That pain moves when you move; it mutters between every breath; it spikes your ears; it rips. You think pain can‘t be any more horrible than that.  
  
  Until you discover that the well is bottomless. There‘s always more. A different kind of pain, maybe, but more and much, much worse.  
  
  But that would be getting ahead of myself.  
  
  h  
  
  Pain‘s not all I remember, of course. There were bright lights. The beep of monitors.  
  
  Needles and tubes. Lots of faces . . . God, now that I think of it, they brought me to this same ER. Maybe these are the same doctors, but I don‘t know because I faded in and out. I do recall that everyone, every face, was grim, like they‘d read this story before and knew the end wasn‘t pretty.  
  
  Later, the doctors said how lucky I was that my mom and Matt had decided to pick me up from Grandpa‘s early. Lucky to be alive. Lucky, lucky, lucky.  
  
  Yeah, that‘s me, Bob. I‘m just so, so lucky.  
  
  i  
  
  I‘m beating around the bush. I know I am. I don‘t want to tell this story, Bob, and you know why? Because this is a fairy tale with teeth and claws, and here‘s what completely sucks: you‘re going to want black and white, Bob, right and wrong. I‘m not sure I can give that to you. That‘s the problem with the truth. Sometimes the truth is ambiguous, or a really bad cliché.  
  
  But this is the truth, Bob: I‘m a liar.  
  
  I am lucky, a liar, a good girl, a princess, a thief—and a killer.  
  
  And my reality—my story—begins with Mr. Anderson.  
  
  2: a  
  
  Of course, the library doors were locked.  
  
  Score another point for Psycho-Dad, who got impatient when I reminded him to double-check and make sure the school librarian would be there to let me in. ?Stop worrying about it,? he‘d said the night before. ?I talked to the school last week. They said there was no problem. ?  
  
  Well, wrong-o there, Dad.  
  
  b  
  
  
  Turing High was one of those Psycho-Dad command decisions, same as us moving to a new McMansion ninety miles north of Milwaukee after my stint on the psych ward. Or was that my breakdown? No, no, it was my ?little episode,? Psycho-Dadspeak for my stay in the place where the nuts feed the squirrels. My father always called it a ? little episode,?  
  
  as if my life was a sitcom and we could simply channel-surf right on past.  
  
  We were in Rebecca‘s office when he first floated the idea in March, and although I hadn‘t known it then, I‘d only see my therapist twice more: another linchpin in Psycho-Dad‘s clean-slate campaign.  
  
  ?Turing makes sense,? he‘d said. ?Jenna‘s a bright, sensitive girl. She‘s just had a . .  
  
  . little episode, that‘s all. When she was on the, ah . . . ?  
  
  ?Ward?? I prompted. I was sprawled in my usual spot, a plump, brown leather armchair. ?Unit??  
  
  Dad‘s lips set in this line above his chin, a fissure in granite. I never talked to my father like that at home, not unless I wanted Psycho-Dad to pay a visit. Of course, the go-to for that is he‘s a shock trauma plastic surgeon and and screws his nurse and has temper tantrums because he‘s just under so much stress. Not that we talk about the blow-outs or the affairs. All that‘s no one‘s business. It‘s a family matter. You know what I‘m talking about, Bob.  
  
  But Rebecca‘s office was my turf. Dad had to behave himself. Doctors are very sensitive about their reputations in front of other doctors, even if the other doc is a shrink and the lowest form of life because all docs know that the med students who become psychiatrists were always pretty squirrely to begin with, the ones who went all girly around blood and guts. Rebecca being a girll. . . well, that was proof.  
  
  ?Yes,? he said. ?Your teacher there said you were light-years ahead of the other kids. ?  
  
  This was true, though that wasn‘t saying much. In the four months I‘d been an inpatient, there were only two kids who stayed long enough to need more than their regular homework delivered. One was eleven and manic half the time—when he wasn‘t in the quiet room, threatening to blow up the joint, that is. The other girl was seventeen, had gotten pregnant, and then started throwing up to stay thin. The baby finally starved, and she miscarried. Only she couldn‘t—wouldn‘t—stop puking. I think there was only one week where she wasn‘t walking around with a feeding tube taped to her nose, and a psych tech within arm‘s reach.  
  
  ?I‘ve had a long talk with the principal and guidance counselor at Turing,? Dad was saying. ?They‘ve assured me that they are accustomed to dealing with kids who‘ve had  problems. ?  
  
  ?You told them about me?? I shot a glance at Rebecca, who was scowling. ?Did you know about this??  
  
  ?Not exactly,? Rebecca said. ?Dr. Lord, don‘t you—?  
  
  ?I didn‘t think it was necessary to involve Becky in the preliminary stages. ? Dad never called Rebecca Dr. Savage and even Rebecca didn‘t call herself Becky. ?This isn‘t Becky‘s decision to make anyway. ?  
  
  ?But you didn‘t ask me,? I said, stupidly believing that maybe, oh, all those hours of family therapy had made a dent. ?We didn‘t discuss it. ?  
  
  Mom, the apologist, jumped in. ?Your father didn‘t mean any harm. ?  
  
  ?Why can‘t I just go on being homeschooled??  
  
  ?That‘s a nonstarter,? said Dad.  
  
  ?Why??  
  
  ?Because. Emily has her hands full with the bookstore. I‘ve got surgeries scheduled every day, and that‘s not counting emergency reconstructions. I‘m at the hospital six, sometimes seven, days a week. Neither your mother nor I have the time to babysit you. ?  
  
  That drew a little blood, as Dad had intended. I looked away, chewing on my lower lip, willing the tears not to fall. I turned to Rebecca. ?Please. Say something. ?  
  
  Rebecca sighed. ?Unfortunately, your parents have a point, Jenna. You do need to be around kids your own age, and preferably ones without serious problems. You won‘t get that if you hide in your house. Being alone is when you‘ve run into problems. ?  
  
  ?Yeah, but I was in school when it hap—? I let that die. I couldn‘t argue. Even though I hadn‘t cut for over six weeks—a new record for me back then—the urge was there, all the time. It was like what that bulimic girl from the ward said: If I go an hour and don’t think about throwing up, I worry there’s something wrong. Puking’s the new normal.  
  
  Slicing and dicing myself would land me back in the hospital, though, and I knew it.  
  
  All the doors in the new McMansion had locks, but I wasn‘t allowed to use them.  
  
  Sometimes after I showered, my mom would barge in as I was toweling off with her patented: ?Oh! I didn‘t know anyone was in here. ? Uh-huh. I saw how her eyes flicked fast, up and down, searching for new cuts, fresh scabs. I knew she checked the trash for bloodied tissues or used Band-Aids. Heaven forbid they ever looked behind the false panel beneath my vanity and found my nail scissors. I hadn‘t used them since I‘d been home, but they were . . . insurance.  
  
  I thought of something else. ?Wait a minute,? I said to Rebecca. ?Don‘t you need my permission before you release records or something??  
  
  Rebecca shook her head. ?Not technically. You‘re only fifteen. ?  
  
  ?I‘ll be sixteen in September. ?  
  
  ?It doesn‘t matter. Until you‘re eighteen, your parents have full say over release of your records. Legally, I can‘t stop them. ?  
  
  Dad snapped his fingers to get our attention. ?Let‘s stay on track, shall we? The point is, Jenna, you are perfectly capable of being around kids your own age, and Turing‘s an excellent private science and tech school. ?  
  
  ?Who said I‘m going into science?? I demanded, although that was probably the stupidest thing I could‘ve said. The best Christmas gift I‘d ever gotten was this Edu Junior Scientist Kit Matt bought with his own money when I was five. Mom had a fit when I filled the basement with orange smoke. ?Doesn‘t my opinion count??  
  
  ?She has a point,? Rebecca said. About time, too. ?I‘ll be honest, Dr. Lord. I was under the impression we were discussing Turing. I had no idea Jenna‘s records had been released, much less that she‘d been accepted. I haven‘t even gotten a request for a summary letter from Turing‘s guidance counselor. ?  
  
  ?Wait. ? Mom looked at Dad. ?They don‘t have a letter from Rebecca??  
  
  ?No,? Dad said, and then he sighed as if he was just so sick of having to get us all up to speed. He spoke slowly and distinctly, like we were morons. ?It‘s bad enough that Jenna‘s wasted months of her life, recovering from her . . . ? He waved a hand to swat my past away. ?I see no reason why we should burden her further by prejudicing them with Becky‘s observations. Jenna‘s out of the hospital. She‘s on no medications. She‘s at home, not in a straitjacket. She comes here, what, twice a month? Becky, no disrespect, but there are one hundred and sixty-eight hours in a week, out of which my daughter spends, exactly, one hour with you. No, less than that: fifty minutes. Your involvement is minimal. I doubt you have much of an impact at this point. ?  
  
  ?I see. ? Rebecca‘s tone dripped acid. ?So what, exactly, is your point, Dr. Lord??  
  
  ?My point is that we are grateful to you. We acknowledge the help you‘ve given Jenna. But her future will not depend upon the fifty minutes she spends here, nor an assessment based on limited exposure. ?  
  
  ?In other words,? I said to Rebecca, ?you‘re fired. ?  
  
  Psycho-Dad blustered a little bit, said things like outgrown and hatched and time to spread her wings, like I was some kind of baby bird Rebecca just wouldn‘t let out of the nest, she was so protective. But it all boiled down to this: Dad decided I needed a fresh start. Turing was in, and little Becky was out. My opinion didn‘t count. God hath spoken.  
  
  Something that happens a lot when your dad‘s last name is Lord.  
  
  c  
  
  That summer, I stayed put in my parents‘ new McMansion, which never felt like home. While I was an inpatient, Dad had gotten rid of all my old furniture. I now had a four-poster with a frilly canopy that I completely hated, which was kind of ironic considering how hard I‘d begged when I was younger because all princesses had canopy beds.  
  
  I weeded the garden, mowed the grass, clipped around the trees, painted the picnic table that no one sat on. Given my mom owned a bookstore, there was always plenty to read, so I devoured at least three books a week. When I wasn‘t reading or doing chores, I single-handedly kept Netflix in business.  
  
  And I e-mailed Matt, although I didn‘t tell anyone. I‘d never even mentioned it to Rebecca, who would‘ve freaked. All our e-mails were on a separate e-mail account that I set up on this ghost server run out of Israel, if you can believe it. I know it sounds like overkill, Bob, but I had to be über-careful. My parents hated that Matt enlisted. I think what really ate at Psycho-Dad was that once Matt was eighteen, he was free and our father couldn‘t do a damn thing about that.  
  
  And what Matt wanted was to run; to get the hell out. It didn‘t work out the way he planned—or, maybe, you know . . . it did. Once he was in Iraq and gone, my parents wouldn‘t talk about it, or him. So, if they found out we were keeping in touch, my mom would‘ve had a nervous breakdown. Dad‘s head would explode. Really, I didn‘t need the headaches.  
  
  I didn‘t blame Matt for running. Before my life came crashing down around my ears, I was on the cross-country team. That summer before Turing, I thought about starting up again, doing some serious training. Except I never did—not then, anyway—because I think I knew, somehow, that I could run and run and run away into forever and still never get anywhere.  
  
  The truth is, Bob, that no matter how far or fast you go, the past always follows: an inky, faceless thing tacked to your shoes that only the harshest light can kill, and then just for those few moments when there is nothing but the strongest fire from the brightest sun, breaking over your shoulders, burning that shadow—and your past—to ash.  
  
  d  
  
  So now, at quarter past six in the morning, I stood in the semi-dark of a strange high school, staring at locked doors and wondering what to do. Mom was long gone, her taillights flashing as she took the circular drive and headed back down the access road which bled into the highway and east toward her mother‘s—my grandmother‘s—old bookstore. Mom wouldn‘t be back for another twelve hours when we would wash, rinse, repeat every single school day for some unspecified time in my bright, sunny future. That is, until she—or more likely, Dad—decided I was normal enough to get my license. Given everything that had happened, I thought that would be a long time coming.  
  
  Where was everyone? My watch sa  
id I still had almost ninety minutes before that first bell. The office staff probably wouldn‘t show for at least a half hour. I could sit tight except my backpack weighed a ton and I had a cup of sickly sweet cappuccino I didn‘t want, but Mom had insisted on buying—like coffee was some kind of rite of passage, a ticket into my new life. Maybe I could put away some of my notebooks at least? I remembered from orientation that my locker was upstairs and to the left. The stairs I needed were all the way down this next hall, I thought, past the cafeteria and—  
  
  ?Hey!?  
  
  I whirled, a scream-bubble at the back of my throat. The guy was squat and burly, with a bottle-brush mustache and a grimy red rag threaded through an empty belt loop.  
  
  ?I . . . uh . . . ? I swallowed my heart back into my chest. ?I came early. . . I have. . . I have permission. . . uh. . . ?  
  
  ?Doors don‘t officially open for almost another hour. ?  
  
  ?They were open. My dad was supposed to arrange it. Me waiting in the library, I mean, so I thought I could come in. ? This was crazy. Did this creepy guy want me to go back outside and wait on the curb while he locked the front doors?  
  
  ?Librarian isn‘t here. ? His eyes kept drifting from my face to my chest.  
  
  Maybe he was a little slow. ?I know. ?  
  
  ?Didn‘t anyone tell me. ?  
  
  ?I‘m sorry. The doors were open. ?  
  
  ?You said that,? he said, speaking to my breasts. ?That‘s not supposed to happen either. ?  
  
  ?Well, there are two cars in the lot. ?  
  
  ?The pickup‘s mine. ?  
  
  Which left a Prius with an empty bike rack on its roof. ?So maybe one of the teachers came in early and left the door open??  
  
  ?Maybe. ? His face folded in a scowl. ?You got ID??  
  
  All I had was my learner‘s permit, which I fumbled from my wallet. He stepped close, squinting at the picture, his eyes clicking from it to me and back again. He stank of cigarettes and sweat and ammonia. Finally he said, ?Okay. Library‘s down the end of the hall. ?

China’s Luckin Coffee takes aim at the U.S. market with a tech-savvy, mobile-first strategy and bold pricing that could challenge Starbucks’ dominance on home turf.

https://preview.redd.it/x3g7ujcj53af1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cfe98ca9506ec5e52a367fc7aa05cf7256babf9

Luckin Coffee just fired a warning shot across the bow of America’s coffee industry. The Beijing-born chain that dethroned Starbucks in China has officially arrived in the United States, opening its first two locations in New York City. And if the brand’s track record in Asia is any indication, American coffee culture is about to get a serious jolt.

At first glance, this might seem like just another international brand testing the waters. But this move is anything but casual. Luckin’s rapid domination of China’s coffee market was no fluke. Its stripped-down, tech-forward model upended Starbucks’ dominance in just two years. Now it’s bringing that same disruption to the streets of Manhattan. The locations in Greenwich Village and NoMad have already kicked off with aggressive discounts and giveaways, a clear sign that Luckin isn’t here to blend in. It’s here to compete.

What sets Luckin apart is its lean and ruthless efficiency. The company doesn’t operate cozy sit-down cafes with baristas calling out your name. Instead, it thrives on minimalism. Most Luckin stores are compact, cashless pickup hubs that thrive on mobile orders. There’s no waiting in line to chat about your oat milk preferences. You scan, you order, you grab and go. It’s tailor-made for young professionals and students who want their caffeine fast and cheap.

And cheap it is. In China, Luckin undercuts Starbucks on price by an average of 30 percent. Its drinks appeal to the TikTok generation with vibrant colors, fruity infusions and eye-catching cold foams. Think pineapple-raspberry iced coffee and coconut milk refreshers instead of traditional espresso shots. With that formula, Luckin now operates over 22,000 locations in China alone. For comparison, Starbucks has fewer than 7,000 stores in that same market.

Of course, it hasn’t all been smooth sailing. In 2020, Luckin was rocked by a massive accounting scandal that led to its Nasdaq delisting and a $180 million fine from the SEC. Its top executives were booted and investors were rattled. Many thought the company was finished. But like a caffeine-fueled comeback story, Luckin cleaned house and refocused on its core markets. The result? Explosive growth. In 2023, it outpaced Starbucks in China by revenue for the first time ever.

Now it’s looking to repeat that magic in America. But here’s the catch. Starbucks is no newcomer in the U.S. It’s a household name with more than 50 years of brand equity and deep cultural roots. Luckin is entering a market where Starbucks is a lifestyle more than a coffee shop. That makes the challenge even steeper. Yet Luckin doesn’t need to beat Starbucks overnight. It just needs to chip away at the younger demographic that’s more price-sensitive and mobile-first.

It helps that the U.S. market is already leaning into many of the trends that Luckin thrives on. Cashless payments and mobile orders are now standard. Loyalty programs and data-driven menus are becoming more sophisticated. The American consumer is ready for the kind of streamlined, app-based coffee experience that Luckin perfected in China.

There’s also the Dutch Bros factor. Another fast-rising competitor, Dutch Bros has carved out a cult following with quirky branding and Instagrammable drinks. If Dutch Bros can explode in the West with less than a tenth of Starbucks’ store count, there’s room for Luckin too. Especially if it continues to innovate and push flavors that stand out in a sea of caramel macchiatos.

But Luckin’s path forward won’t be without resistance. U.S. consumers are fiercely loyal. The Starbucks crowd isn’t just buying a drink, they’re buying a ritual. A workspace. A social hub. Luckin’s utilitarian model may appeal to tech-savvy students and office workers, but it lacks the emotional connection that Starbucks has cultivated over decades.

Still, times are changing. Inflation and economic pressure have made consumers more cost-conscious. Gen Z and Millennials want efficiency, novelty and value. That’s exactly what Luckin offers. If it can deliver consistent quality while keeping prices low and lines short, it will find an audience.

The two Manhattan stores are just the beginning. If they succeed, expansion to other major cities could come fast. Luckin’s secret weapon has always been its speed. It doesn’t just open stores, it unleashes them. With the right mix of aggressive pricing, mobile-first convenience and splashy drinks, it could become a major player in America’s $100 billion coffee industry.

The real question isn’t whether Luckin can survive in the U.S. The question is how long Starbucks can ignore it. With more than 22,000 stores and a taste for competition, Luckin isn’t just another import. It’s a storm brewing on the horizon of the American coffee scene.

**Conclusion**

Luckin Coffee’s entry into the U.S. market is more than a business expansion. It’s a bold challenge to Starbucks on its home turf. With a proven playbook of mobile ordering, low prices and trend-driven drinks, Luckin is poised to shake up a market that’s ripe for disruption. Whether it succeeds or stumbles remains to be seen. But one thing is clear. The coffee wars are heating up, and the battleground has just expanded.",1,1751298498.0,Junior_Stocks,0,1.0,False

Quick definition

hard on the outside, soft on the inside.

Intro

This is a basic bare bones, guide of the anime and manga female tsundere. It does not cover, male tsundere, or the Western versions of this archetype. It focuses on the basics and the two most common types of tsundere, that's it. I might add more things to it, but for now this is it.

A tsundere is an archetype of a fictional character that focuses on hiding feelings for typically some deep-rooted reason that leads to a fear of vulnerability. The term is Japanese and tsun means to turn away or refusing to accept and dere means that to be lovey-dovey. 

There are other meanings, but the gist of it is that a tsundere is by nature a dual character in conflict that typically shows inward love, and outward hate until they reach what I like to call the melting point.

It's a romantic interest trope, that when done right creates good tension and an overall interesting character.

This is my own interpretation and there are others out there. I made it because even today, I see people reduce tsundere especially the 'old gen' ones to arrogant brats, which is true for a lot of them, but not all they are.

It is rooted in anime/manga, the tsundere archetype reflects Japanese storytelling’s emphasis on emotional restraint and growth.

Now to start.

Core traits

1. Hidden Feelings: Suppresses affection, often masking it with hostility or indifference.
2. Emotional Dissonance(Loves you inside, hates you outside): Feels love or care internally but expresses criticism or disdain outwardly.
3. Tactical clinginess(Push-Pull dynamic): Alternates between pushing others away and subtly seeking closeness.
4. Unrealistic knack(Insecurity-driven perfectionism masked as pride): Projects confidence or high standards to mask deep-seated insecurities. They tend to have an inferiority complex, and they mask it as a superiority complex. It's a defense mechanism to avoid vulnerability and perceived weakness. It is also possibly derived from emotional immaturity, limited emotional literacy, or other such cases.
5. Hidden true loyalty(Earned, Not Given): Fiercely loyal once trust is gained, but never given freely.

Progression: Tsundere go from more difficult to a softer state as they reach a more mature point, and advance with their experience. I like to refer to this process as melting, and their original state as frozen. At the end, the tsundere will be melted.

It goes: Frozen → Cracking → Soft Center Exposed → Melted.

Note that regression in the opposite direction is possible if pushed too far.

	1.	Frozen (baseline tsun).
	•	Tell-tale signs: minimal eye contact, clipped answers, nit-picking logistics (“You’re late!”).
	•	Risk: If you stay here too long the audience may label them outright hostile.
	2.	Cracking.
	•	Micro-events that cause fissures:– Protagonist exhibits unexpected competence.– Third-party praises the protagonist in front of tsundere.– Shared danger/forced proximity.
	•	Non-verbal signals: fleeting blush, quick apology muttered under breath.
	3.	Soft Centre Exposed.
	•	Audience payoff: We witness a dere-moment that no side character sees.
	•	A good litmus test: Would the tsundere be mortified if a friend walked in right now? If yes, you’re here.
	4.	Melted.
	•	They initiate affection (or, at least, admit desire openly).
	•	The “push” element never vanishes 100%—leaving a sliver of tsun keeps their flavour.
	•	Beware “personality death.” If melted tsundere turns into a generic sweetheart, you’ve lost what made them interesting.
Regression triggers:
	•	Public humiliation, jealousy misunderstandings, or fear of losing control.
	•	Sudden reminder of core insecurity (“Why would someone like you like me?”).

Progression catalyst:

Frozen → Cracking 

At this stage, it's only a matter of persistence and kindness, but NOT forcefulness. In other words to simply be there for them.

Cracking → Soft Center Exposed

This takes more work, it takes actually knowing the tsundere and recognizing her habits, hobbies, or likes shown before. Engaging and showing care through thick and thin.

Soft Center Exposed → Melted

This requires deeper moments of vulnerability from both sides, creating a 'safe' space where the tsundere can finally open up. At this point a bit of pushiness tends to be necessary to help reach the final step. Helping face the insecurities or whatever deeper problems head-on, together.

Kindness & persistence are the backbone, but you can vary flavour with three levers:
	1.	Reciprocal Vulnerability – the love-interest reveals a weakness first.
	2.	External Stakes – life-or-death mission binds them and fast-tracks cracks.
	3.	Third-Party Contrast – rival or kouhai who openly adores the protagonist makes tsundere confront her own feelings.

Main subtypes

There are two mains subtypes.

1. Hot/Aggressive/Old gen
-Violent: Prone to things, like punching the shoulder, pushing, shaking, and in some more extreme comedic types straight up royal beatdown.

-Loud: They tend to be very opinionated and open about said opinions to their love interests especially so long as it's not a topic she's vulnerable about. They yell and shout at minimal inconveniences especially if they are caused in some way by their love interest.

-Bashful: While some tsundere don't mind being the center of attention in the general sense, they all seem to have a weakness to people they like looking at them, especially if it's done in silence, the longer it goes the closer the ticking time bomb gets to blowing up.

-Explosive(Hyper-reactivity to Praise): As mentioned before, they blow up. Hot Tsundere are prone to externalizing their feelings, it can be by hitting their love interest or just overall bursts of hyperactivity or power. If in an action based or heavy series, they could even be used to give her the boost she needs to win the battle. Or even something like destroying a wall cause the love interest got too close or less supernatural bending a spoon.

1. 1- Melted Hot
-Bashful -> Easily Flustered: Rather than trying to avoid the attention of the love interest like before, she now doesn't mind it, even though it still makes her blush, cause the feelings are still there, she just learned to deal with them.

-Violent -> Fiercly Protective: Her violent attacks on the love interest could be redirected to any threat that pops up. Now the energy spent being a bit of nonsense can be turned to facing problems together. Don't throw out their energy or character, repurpose it without making her someone else.

-Loud -> Critical but loving: She will still yell at the love interest, and be somewhat mean, but the tone is no longer frustrated or angry at herself or the love interest, now it should be caring, concerned, supportive. The difference between criticism and constructive criticism.

-Explosive -> Hyper private affection: At this point her clinginess should be embraced, at least in private, when no one is looking she should be extra loving, because even if she learned to be vulnerable with the love interest the step to be with the rest of the world will take some time, so let her show that in their quiet moments.

2. Cold/Passive-aggressive/new gen
-Foul mouth: Sarcasm, a few insults, and raw truths that might be mean or sad to say will come out of her mouth, whenever she feels cornered or like her space has been invaded.

-Prickly: She has her own mind and ideas, and while it's not like she can't learn new things, she's strong about her perspective in the world, even if you don't agree or find it too negative. Why should she trust anyone in this dog eat dog world? Don't make her laugh.

-Defensive: Once you catch her in a mistake or slip-up, be ready cause she will deflect and defend herself like her life depends on it.

-Reciprocant(Pays love with love, hate with hate): While she won't do anything grandiose, if you help her, she'll find some way to help you, probably won't be direct or something you can easily notice but it will happen.

2. 2 Melted Cold
-Foul mouth -> Witty Banter: Her throat cut words, will soften a bit, and because small jokes, if she ever goes to far, she'll feel horrible unlike before when she could just throw words around without worry, now there's a level of measure and calculation to them, like there's an invisible like she can't cross that was probably already there, but now that line takes a lot less to cross. So she's more careful not to.

-Prickly -> Cynical Protective: The world is dark, some say, and she seems to think among those lines, so she's careful to have things in order to protect her love interest. Why wait for trouble to come when you know it's coming eventually, in that case you prepare as much as you can.

-Defensive -> Reluctant Affectionate: The willingness to protect any mistake, was broken down, leaving a more reluctant affection, that fear of feeling and letting feel died, and in its place stands an acceptance that it's not that bad, but still, she's her, and nobody can know she's a softie so, some defenses stay up just in case.

-Reciprocant -> Subtle affection cycle: Now instead of waiting for the love interest to do something so she has an excuse, she'll just go ahead and initiate with little things, like making you lunch, coffee, or tea, leaving a small gift on a random day, nothing too overt, but definitely there.

Character Examples:

At this point a few character examples will do some good.

Hot Tsunderes:

Asuka Langley from Neon Genesis Evangelion

Louise de la Vallière from The Familiar of Zero

Taiga Aisaka from Toradora!

Cold Tsunderes:

Yuki Nagato from Haruhi Suzumi

Senjougahara Hitagi from Bakemonogatari

Pitfalls:

1.	Consent & Comedy Balance– Slapstick violence can read as abuse if the setting’s tone is realistic. Keep consequences cartoonish or dial it back.
	2.	One-Note Danger– Without glimpses of tender motives early, readers may disengage before the crack appears.
	3.	End-State Identity– A fully melted tsundere isn’t a different person; she’s a louder signal-to-noise ratio of her dere side. Preserve sass, competitiveness, or teasing to keep her flavour.
	4.	Real-Life vs Fiction– Tsundere reactions are cranked up for drama. In reality, chronic hostility is a red flag. If writing contemporary romance, explicitly address that distinction.",1,1751298369.0,Tsunderes,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

the quality of a yellow paint pen hinges on several critical features that directly influence its performance and usability. These include the nib size, ink composition, opacity, durability, and surface compatibility. Understanding these aspects is crucial for selecting the perfect pen for your specific needs.**Nib Size and Type:** The nib size determines the thickness of the line,and the type affects the smoothness and consistency of the ink flow. Fine-tipped pens are excellent for detailed work, while broader nibs are better suited for filling larger areas. Round nibs provide consistent lines,whereas chisel nibs offer versatility with varying stroke widths.

A wide range of nib sizes are available, typically ranging from ultra-fine (0.5mm) to broad (3.0mm or larger). Choosing the right size depends on the intended request. such as, intricate patterns and lettering benefit from a fine tip, while bold designs and large-scale artwork require a broader nib. Moreover, the material of the nib, such as acrylic or fiber, can affect its durability and resistance to wear. High-quality nibs ensure a smooth writing experience and prevent ink from bleeding or feathering.

**Ink Composition and Pigment Quality:** The ink's composition profoundly impacts the pen's performance and longevity. high-quality inks are formulated for optimal adhesion, fade resistance, and water resistance. pigment quality is paramount for achieving vibrant and consistent color. Look for pens that use lightfast pigments, which resist fading over time, ensuring that your artwork remains vibrant for years.

Solvent-based inks are known for their durability and adhesion to various surfaces,while water-based inks are safer,odorless,and easier to clean up. However,solvent-based inks may not be suitable for all surfaces,as they can dissolve or damage certain materials. Understanding the ink's composition is vital for ensuring its compatibility with your chosen surface. Additionally,the ink's viscosity and flow characteristics affect its ease of use and the consistency of the line.

**Opacity and Coverage:** Opacity refers to the ink's ability to obscure the underlying surface.Highly opaque inks provide complete coverage with a single stroke, while more translucent inks may require multiple layers to achieve the desired effect. The level of opacity depends on the pigment concentration in the ink.

For achieving bold and vibrant colors on dark surfaces,an opaque ink is essential. Consider the type of projects you typically undertake. For outlining or highlight features, translucent inks blended into several layers can achieve desired coloring as well. also consider bleed through if the base coat of the canvas is textured in any way. Selecting a pen with suitable opacity will save time and effort by reducing the need for multiple coats.

**durability and Longevity:** A durable paint pen can withstand frequent use and resist drying out, ensuring longevity. features such as airtight caps and properly sealed barrels help to prevent ink from evaporating or clogging the nib. some pens also incorporate mechanisms to prevent the ink from settling, maintaining consistent color and flow.

The durability of the pen's body also matters. Look for pens made from sturdy materials, such as metal or high-quality plastic, that can withstand accidental drops or rough handling.Proper storage is also crucial for extending the pen's lifespan. Storing pens horizontally or with the nib pointing downwards can prevent the ink from drying out and ensure that the pen is ready for use whenever needed.

**Surface Compatibility:** Versatility is a key consideration when choosing a yellow paint pen. The best pens are compatible with a wide range of surfaces, including paper, canvas, wood, metal, glass, plastic, and fabric. The ink formulation should provide good adhesion to each type of surface, without bleeding, smearing, or peeling.

Some pens are specifically designed for porous surfaces, such as paper and fabric, while others are formulated for non-porous surfaces, such as glass and metal.Before using a paint pen on a new surface, it is always advisable to test it on a small, inconspicuous area to ensure compatibility. Surface planning,such as cleaning or priming,can also improve adhesion and prevent problems.

Replace the cap securely to prevent air from entering the pen. Avoid storing pens in direct sunlight or extreme temperatures,as this can affect the ink quality.

**How do I prime a new yellow paint pen?**
Priming a new yellow paint pen is essential for initiating ink flow. Start by shaking the pen vigorously for several seconds to mix the ink. then, remove the cap and press the nib repeatedly on a scrap piece of paper until the ink begins to flow.

1loaqsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CysticFibrosis/comments/1loaqsk/parents_have_covid_and_wont_stay_away/,Parents have Covid and won’t stay away,"So I  (20) have Cf, and I’ve posted before how I’ve got a mutation so it only affects my lungs. As a late diagnosis it’s actually not that bad and I’m fine with just modulators. 

Both my Mam and Dad have got Covid rn, and I’ve been testing myself but I don’t seem to have it so far. I’ve noticed a tickle in my throat but I’m hoping it’s just a general flare up and not related. 

They have no concern whatsoever for social distancing and trying to avoid me catching it. I am young and healthy so it wouldn’t be the end of the world but at the same time it really hurts that they’ve been so inconsiderate. 

When I test myself they complain that I’m waisting tests. Yesterday my dad brought me coffee into my room, which he’s never done before ever, and as much as I appreciate the sentiment I don’t understand why now? My mam continues to cook the family meals and because they’ve taken the kitchen and sitting room I don’t want to offer to do that for her. Now when I enter the kitchen to get myself food and drink I put myself at risk. They’ve enetered my room several times despite me repeatedly asking them not to. 

When my dad started showing symptoms my mam was going to give him an antibiotic she had from a previous infection. Me and my brother (he studies paramedics) told her she should not do that. I asked had anyone taken a Covid test to which they rolled their eyes at me and put me down. I bought some out of my own money and low and behold my dad had the brightest positive test I’ve ever seen. Then they got narky that I had told them so. 

As soon as he got the positive test he should have gone into his bedroom but he stayed with the rest of the family. Naturally my mam then assumed she had it but nobody took any caution to avoid me and my brother catching it. Not only do I have CF but my brother has asthma. My mam has her own illnesses but nothing concerned with the lungs and my dad has no conditions. So it is disheartening for them to act so irresponsibly

They seem to find my concern for my own health rude. And get very annoyed when I complain about their lack of compliance to Covid rules. Yesterday they went to the shops, and when I called them and naturally expressed how much of a bad idea that was, and how me or my brother could have gone to a local shop/ ordered groceries I was once again shut down and told I was being a smart arse. Today they blamed me not coming down stairs quick enough to hang up laundry as to why they were not in their bedrooms. But why did laundry needed to be washed today? 

They are going to remain downstairs so I am hiding in my room. Their lack of care towards my illnesses has really hurt me and frustrated me. I’ve been telling them I’m avoiding them because I have a concert on Wednesday (which I do) but they should already be aware that I am the most at risk person in the household, each variant of COVID could affect me differently even if I was ok in the past. Honestly I’m thinking of booking a hotel or something but I’m worried it’s too late.",5,1751297914.0,CysticFibrosis,3,1.0,False

1loaqf7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1loaqf7,Fish Cheeks,"Fish cheeks is fantastic! Likely not news to most of this sub but I finally got around to it. This is probably my new favorite Thai. I always loved Thai but I haven’t tried too many places (grew up eating at Joya in Brooklyn and I recently really liked Ayada in Elmhurst). And I typically keep it simple with spicy noodles or pad see ew. I know this is a mostly seafood take on Thai but if you love seafood and haven’t been please please come. I went to Kalaya in Philly a few months back after hearing about online and this is so much better than Kalaya sorry to say. 

I know the sub recommends the wings, the coconut curry, the whole fish (steamed and fried), the pork cheeks, and the shrimp in 3.  I wanted to get everything but there’s only 2 of us and we didn’t have enough room of course. But what we had was some of the best versions of the dish.

Zabb wings - crunchy, juicy large wings. Seasoned all over. My boyfriend described as a better lemon pepper and he’s right. Citrusy, salty, peppery. 5 full wings as an app so they don’t skimp. I want all my fried chicken to taste like this.

Pork cheeks - first time having pork cheeks, best cut of pork I never knew about. I love pork, one of pork’s biggest fans but I don’t usually love the texture of pork chops. It tends to be a bit dry and tough. This was great because it was so flavorful and firm but also juicy and tender. This was probably my favorite thing I ate.

Crab fried rice - I’ve had a few iterations of this and it’s always good but the green sauce they served it with really took it over the top. Crab was sweet and the portion was large unlike some places. Loved this.

While steamed fish - how fish should be. Seasoned in and out. I find sometimes you order whole fish at places and the seasoning is only in the outside. Not here it tasted marinated and citrusy and bright. Love the flavors. Presentation was great.

Small dislikes: whole fish did not come with rice. We are spending 40 dollars on a whole fish. A small bowl of white rice should be served alongside, came off a bit cheap to me. We had the crab fried rice so it was not necessary but would have been nice to have.

Cocktails were pretty forgettable to me. Especially for 19 dollars each. Looked nice but tasted whatever. I would try the n/a lemonade or Thai iced tea/coffee instead next time.

They just opened up their Williamsburg location and I noticed they were pretty accommodating to walk ins if you’re not picky about sitting inside or out. Make your way over now!

Someone said that this protein isn't the same as the protein you take to build muscle. Im pretty clueless when it comes to protien powder as I have never used one before. 

So is this protein mainly good for skin and joints?.

I eat mainly protein and wanted to add some extra protien to my diet to help build muscle, will this multi collagen protein not do that?.

Im not trying to get big muscles or anything i just want to try to turn my fat into muscle, lol. Im 5""4 and 53kg, but my thighs and upper back are just not toning up. So I figured taking in more protien could help with that

1loam8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1loam8x/i_think_my_mother_is_the_devil/,I think my mother is the Devil.,"The house is full of eyes, crosses on the walls, paintings of Christ, cheap crucifixes with broken chains nailed to door frames like warding charms. Even the bookshelves groan beneath the weight of a dozen Bibles, each more ornate than the last. Some are bound in cracked red leather, others laced with golden trim, pages so thin you can see the scripture bleeding through from the other side. There’s one in my room, too. I don’t remember the last time I opened it, but I remember the pictures. Noah’s ark, Jonah in the whale, Abraham clutching his miracle child.

My mother reads them all the time. She never skips a passage. She reads them out loud, softly, reverently, like lullabies to something listening beneath the floorboards.

In the kitchen, there’s a painting she loves most of all. Christ on the cross. This one is swollen and black with rot, arms disjointed at odd angles, ribs sharp and bursting through purpled skin. His face is ruined. Maggots bloom from his eyes like milkweed. She stares at it when she thinks I’m not watching, her mouth twitching into a smile that looks like it's been sewn on too tight. Sometimes her fingers creep up and touch the little silver crucifix at her throat. Sometimes she giggles.

Sundays are her favorite days. To her, church is theater. The congregation are the audience, bleating their hymns like sheep, while she whisper behind the curtains. I’ve watched her lean in close to priests after mass, her voice sticky-sweet, like honey dripped from a blade. They laugh, nod. The next sermon always changes. Less about love. More about blood. Wrath. Shame. Her words wrap around their throats and make puppets of them.

Afterward, she takes me to the coffee shop and buys me the sweetest pastry I can find. We sit by the window, her fingers idly braiding my hair while I sip my drink and pretend not to feel the cold in her touch. She shows me things on her phone. We talk about her work, her coworkers, my day at school. She listens, always with that same soft smile. She buys me new clothes. She tucks me in. She makes me feel safe.

And yet she ruins everything she touches.

The first memory I have of her is pain.

I was crying. She knelt beside me and pulled my face close to hers. Her hands were dry and rough, like old paper. Her breath smelled like lavender and iron.

“All is well,” she whispered.

That was when things began to change. Before that, she had been ordinary, or as ordinary as a woman could be while her husband tossed her across rooms like garbage. My father never laid a hand on me. He brought me candy when he came home drunk. Toys wrapped in crumpled paper. I think, sometimes, I wanted him to hit her. Because afterward, he’d bring me something shiny, and I could pretend we were a family.

But my mother began walking into the woods at night. Long walks. Hours gone without explanation. She left the chickens out on purpose and let the foxes come. I once watched her crouch in the tall grass behind the coop, waiting. She drained the carcass with her hands and filled jars with what came out.

She started setting traps. For birds and rats. I saw her pin a blackbird to the porch with a nail through its wing, humming a lullaby while it screamed. The bodies dried out on the ceiling. Hung like ornaments. Later, she’d grind them into dust and whisper over the bowl as she stirred them.

Books started appearing. Thin, hand-bound volumes from strangers who never used the front door. She’d sit me on her lap after evening prayers and read to me. Some were Bible passages, but others weren’t.

She told me never to go into the basement. She’d put her hand over mine when I got too close, smile wide and sweet, and say, “Not for you, little lamb.”

But I could hear the noises at night. The shrieks. The sobbing mewls. The soft thud of her feet moving in circles.

She began inviting people over. And when she did, she’d place thin shards of glass on the couch cushions and seat backs. When our guests sat down, they’d wince, blood rising in dots along their thighs and palms. She'd apologize with her mouth, but her eyes were laughing.

Eventually, no one visited anymore.

So I brought them instead. Classmates. Kids who didn’t know any better.

She’d greet them with candy. Sweet pies, still warm. She’d pinch their fingers between hers and prick them with a tiny sewing needle, catching the blood in little vials. She told them not to tell, and in return, I’d bring them brownies to school. No one said a word.

Then came the night my father came home again.

The smell of beer and stale smoke preceded him like a cloud. His voice was loud and clumsy. He knocked over the lamp in the hallway and cursed the carpet. My mother didn’t flinch. She smiled at me like she always did.

“Come,” she said. “Let’s go downstairs.”

I don’t know why I listened. Maybe because her voice was so calm. Maybe because I’d always wanted to see what was down there.

The basement was pitch dark. Not mysterious or shadowy, but *wrong*. The kind of dark that makes your teeth ache. Something thick in the air. The walls looked the same, but there were too many bones. Too many stains.

She sat down and pulled me into her lap.

In the center of the room was a circle. Bone and salt, etched deep into the concrete. A bowl sat in the middle, full of a thick liquid the color of old rust. It smelled like spoiled citrus and rotting meat.

I started to cry. My throat closed up. My eyes itched and burned. I wanted to run, but her arms were around me, swaying gently. Her lips brushed my forehead.

“Shh,” she said. “You’re my good girl.”

It was the worst I’d ever felt. My stomach cramped and my skin turned cold.

She set me aside and i crawled to the corner, behind the coat rack. My father’s old jacket still hung there, stinking of sweat and blood and whatever he used to hide in the garage.

She lit a candle. Just one. The flame barely reached her chin, but it made her eyes shine like glass.

She took the big kitchen knife,  the one she used to cut up apples for me, and slid it into her wrist. I heard the blade punch through. Then the wet splash. Then again, deeper this time.

I kept my eyes shut for what felt like five minutes, maybe longer. My fingers clutched the rough fabric of my father’s coat, knotted into it, like if I held tight enough, I might disappear into the folds. The basement was strange at night, wider somehow, and full of shapes that weren’t there in the daytime. I didn’t know the room well, not in the dark, not with that awful bowl still steaming in the center.

I told myself someone would come. Maybe Grandma. She always called if Mom didn't. Someone would notice if we vanished. But in my heart I wasn’t sure. I didn’t want to move. I didn’t want to make a sound.

Then the door opened.

A sharp thud against the frame, followed by the awful shuffle of feet and a string of slurred, guttural syllables. My father had come home.

He spoke in fractured curses, his voice swollen with liquor and rage, the words barely forming. He reeked of sweat, smoke, and the sour stink of stale beer. I heard the glass bottle in his hand before I saw it, before i heard the crash as it shattered somewhere near the candle.

""Betty,"" he slurred, voice rising into a cruel, childish mockery. ""Where’s my fuckin’ bag? Did you take it again?""

He staggered into the room like something already dead, his boots crunching the broken shards beneath him. But my mother didn’t move. She didn’t even flinch when the bottle hit her head.

The candlelight was dim, but I could make out his outline, hulking, sagging, almost grotesque. The way he leaned against the wall made it look like he was melting.

""I did,"" my mother said.

It was her voice, but empty. There was no love, no fear, not even disgust. Just... vacancy. As if someone had taken her throat and replaced it with an answering machine. The words fell flat into the air like dead birds.

""Bitch,"" my father snapped, lurching forward.

He reached for her, and his foot came down hard on a piece of glass. The sound it made, sharp and wet, was followed by a sharp yelp. He stumbled, tried to steady himself by grabbing her shoulder.

Then she stood up.

I don’t know how she moved like that, slow and fluid, but taller than before, impossibly tall. Her hair spilled down her back in thick, greasy ropes. Her hands closed around his arm, and with one motion, she bent it inward, wrong, until there was a crack like someone stepping on a tree branch.

He screamed. It wasn’t even a real scream. It was a cough soaked in blood. His voice tore itself apart trying to make noise. She didn’t let go.

There was more cracking, more wet, slippery sounds. Then silence, broken only by his breath rattling in his throat like wind through dry reeds.

She turned to me.

I couldn’t breathe. I thought my heart might stop. I thought she would break me apart too. That I would be next. My body was frozen and shaking at the same time, like my soul wanted out of my bones. She came closer.

I felt tears warm on my face. I was trying to whisper, ""please,"" but my mouth was full of breath and spit and panic.

She knelt.

She knelt down, gently, and took my hand in hers. Her skin wasn’t warm anymore. It was cool, like something buried deep in the earth, but somehow the touch was still... comforting. Like being rocked in a fever dream.

""Mom,"" I whispered, again and again.

She said nothing. Just kissed my forehead and lifted me up, holding me to her chest as she carried me upstairs.

In the morning, my father was gone.

The police said he must have gotten drunk and wandered off, maybe into the woods. They said he'd probably turn up in a day or two, hungover and hungry. He never did. His family accused my mother of hiding him. They said he was due in court and she was covering for him. But no one could prove anything. He just disappeared.

Since then, she’s been strange.

Not evil, not exactly. Not cruel, at least not to me, anyway. Quite the opposite, she’s kind, attentive, patient in ways no human could be. She brushes my hair every morning. She makes soups with whole doves, feathers still tucked under the skin. She lets me cry when I need to, and while I cry, she crushes rabbit bones with her bare hands, making soft cooing noises to calm me.

She is present. Always watching.

She doesn’t sleep much. I see her outside sometimes, walking barefoot through the wet grass, humming songs that make the trees lean. I hear her praying in languages that break my ears. Once I saw her peeling the skin from a squirrel and placing it neatly over a porcelain doll, as if dressing it for church.

She’s not human.

I know that now.

Not in a metaphorical way. I don’t mean that she’s a “devil” like a bad mother, or a monster of circumstance. I mean it literally. There’s something old and wrong inside her skin. Something that stretches time when she walks into a room. Something that feeds on more than food.

She feels love. I know she does. She loves me. But it’s a hollow kind. Like a shadow pretending to be a person.

She doesn’t hate other people. She just doesn’t think they matter. She treats people like roaches crawling across a sacred floor. She can be gentle, and then, without warning, she can twist a neck or slit a throat, and never blink. I think she does these things for reasons I can’t understand. Not because she enjoys them, but because she believes they are necessary.

I don’t know what she wants. Or what she’s waiting for.

But she’s here. And I am hers.

And every night I fall asleep in the same bed where she tucks me in, I pray to a God I no longer believe in, that she never stops loving me.

Because if she does there will be no one left to stop her.",1,1751297625.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1. Going with coconut+pear instead of pink grapefruit, for two main reasons. First, pink grapefruit essential oil can cause skin irritation if exposed to sunlight. Second, coconut and pear are probably going to be better suited to balance any acidity from the coffee.

2. Need to use a lilac fragrance oil instead of an actual lilac essential oil, because lilac essential oil doesn't exist. Something about the chemical composition of lilac scent prevents it from being directly made into an essential oil.

3. Seems like using ethanol as a carrier is widely considered ""better"" or more professional than a carrier oil, so I'll probably do that.

4. Possible to make the coffee scent directly from coffee beans, so I'll use my gf's favorite coffee for this.

5. Not really possible to make the pear and coconut scents directly from pears and coconuts, so I'll have to buy ethyl decadienoate, cis-3-hexenol (pear), and gamma-nonalactone (coconut).

6. I'm a little concerned that there aren't enough notes. Pear is usually a top note, coconut and coffee are usually base notes, and lilac can be a heart note... But I feel like this might not be enough. Experimentation required. Although in [this](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rochas/Alchimie-2149.html) fragrance, lilac is top and coconut is middle.

1loac2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/interiordecorating/comments/1loac2z/what_kind_of_shelving_should_i_put_on_this_blank/,"What kind of shelving should I put on this blank ""kitchen"" wall?","I'm in a small apartment with a tiny kitchen. As soon as I moved in, I knew that I needed more kitchen space, so I decided that I would use part of the living room as both a dining area and a sort of extension of the kitchen.

The wall is 95.75"" (2.432 meters) wide. In the photo, you can see a sideboard cabinet. It is 65"" (1.651 m) wide. To the left of the cabinet, there is a robot vacuum in a space that is 18"" (45.72 cm) wide. To the right of the cabinet, there is a trashcan in a space that is 12.75"" (32.385 cm) wide. I like having the trashcan there. I would not mind moving the robot vacuum base to another area, if necessary.

From the top of the book (temprarily sitting on the microwave), to the ceiling, the vertical space is about 40"" (1.016 m).

**What I need:** strong shelves for my pots and pans (I have a 10-pc. set of stainless steel cookware—3 pots, 3 pans, 4 lids—and a couple of enameled cast iron Dutch ovens), shelving for a few cookbooks, shelving for plants (and grow lights).

**What I would like to have, but don't need:** space for wall art, place to hang coffee mugs, space for a big (preferably round) mirror

The SS pots and pans aren't the prettiest things to look at, but I want them to be easy to access and I don't have space in the sideboard cabinet (which includes a standmixer, a food processor, an Instant Pot, and a couple of other pots and pans) or my kitchen cabinets.

I came very close to buying a pot rack [like this](https://a.co/d/dmWhQCa) and putting it over the trashcan (so it would be right next to the kitchen), but I'm having trouble visualizing a layout that includes the rack and everything else that I need storage space for.

I thought about mounting shelves that would cover most of the width of the wall, but I'd prefer to keep the pots and pans on the right side, closest to the kitchen and the plants on the left, closer to the window, and I don't know what to put between them or how to make it look like a fluid transition. Should they be on the same shelves, or should I have more narrow shelving units on each side of the wall so that there's a clear separation between the different ""categories"" of item?

I would like for the wall to look as nice as possible (while still being practical) because it's the back wall of my apartment and you can see it as soon as you walk in.

Thank you for your kind advice and opinions!

But this is argument is a little misleading, I think I hear this quite often about games ""it's so cheap, it's less than <this other thing you commonly buy>"", but the thing is, price is often not what's actually causing people to avoid buying the game. It's time.  
   
Imagine you buy a cup of coffee, and it took you 5 hours to drink it, and at the end of it you felt more hungry/tired than when you started.  
that's what playing a bad video game is like.  
  
when you buy food you are guaranteed to get some value out of it, even a movie can be just passively consumed in the background, but video games *demand* your time.  
  
So the standards are always going to be way higher. But this also means that if a game is good and worth playing and has good word of mouth. You can probably get away with charging a decent price.",134,1751296817.0,gamedev,30,0.85,False

 WHICH IS MOSTLY ABOUT NAMES AND FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS IT BEGINS, AS MOST THINGS BEGIN, WITH A SONG.  
 In the beginning, after all, were the words, and they came with a tune. That was how the world was made, how the void was divided, how the lands and the stars and the dreams and the little gods and the animals, how all of them came into the world.  
 They were sung. The great beasts were sung into existence, after the Singer had done with the planets and the hills and the trees and the oceans and the lesser beasts. The cliffs that bound existence were sung, and the hunting grounds, and the dark.  
Songs remain. They last. The right song can turn an emperor into a laughingstock, can bring down dynasties. A song can last long after the events and the people in it are dust and dreams and gone. That’s the power of songs.  
 There are other things you can do with songs. They do not only make worlds or recreate existence. Fat Charlie Nancy’s father, for example, was simply using them to have what he hoped and expected would be a marvelous night out.  
  Before Fat Charlie’s father had come into the bar, the barman had been of the opinion that the whole karaoke evening was going to be an utter bust; but then the little old man had sashayed into the room, walked past the table of several blonde women with the fresh sunburns and smiles of tourists, who were sitting by the little makeshift stage in the corner. He had tipped his hat to them, for he wore a hat, a spotless green fedora, and lemon-yellow gloves, and then he walked over to their table. They giggled. Are you enjoy in‘ yourselves, ladies?” he asked.  
  
  They continued to giggle and told him they were having a good time, thank you, and that they were here on vacation. He said to them, it gets better, just you wait.  
  
  He was older than they were, much, much older, but he was charm itself, like something from a bygone age when fine manners and courtly gestures were worth something. The barman relaxed. With someone like this in the bar, it was going to be a good evening.  
  
  There was karaoke. There was dancing. The old man got up to sing, on the makeshift stage, not once, that evening, but twice. He had a fine voice, and an excellent smile, and feet that twinkled when he danced. The first time he got up to sing, he sang “What’s New Pussycat?” The second time he got up to sing, h  
e ruined Fat Charlie’s life.  
  
  FAT CHARLIE WAS ONLY EVER FAT FOR A HANDFUL OF YEARS, from shortly before the age of ten, which was when his mother announced to the world that if there was one thing she was over and done with (and if the gentleman in question had any argument with it he could just stick it you know where) it was her marriage to that elderly goat that she had made the unfortunate mistake of marrying and she would be leaving in the morning for somewhere a long way away and he had better not try to follow, to the age of fourteen, when Fat Charlie grew a bit and exercised a little more. He was not fat. Truth to tell, he was not really even chubby, simply slightly soft-looking around the edges. But the name Fat Charlie clung to him, like chewing gum to the sole of a tennis shoe. He would introduce himself as Charles or, in his early twenties, Chaz, or, in writing, as C. Nancy, but it was no use: the name would creep in, infiltrating the new part of his life just as cockroaches invade the cracks and the world behind the fridge in a new kitchen, and like it or not—and he didn’t—he would be Fat Charlie again.  
  
  It was, he knew, irrationally, because his father had given him the nickname, and when his father gave things names, they stuck.  
  
  There was a dog who had lived in the house across the way, in the Florida street on which Fat Charlie had grown up. It was a chestnut-colored boxer, long-legged and pointy-eared with a face that looked like the beast had, as a puppy, run face-first into a wall. Its head was raised, its tail nub erect. It was, unmistakably, an aristocrat amongst canines. It had entered dog shows. It had rosettes for Best of Breed and for Best in Class and even one rosette marked Best in Show. This dog rejoiced in the name of Campbell’s Macinrory Arbuthnot the Seventh, and its owners, when they were feeling familiar, called it Kai. This lasted until the day that Fat Charlie’s father, sitting out on their dilapidated porch swing, sipping his beer, noticed the dog as it ambled back and forth across the neighbor’s yard, on a leash that ran from a palm tree to a fence post.  
  
  “Hell of a goofy dog,” said Fat Charlie’s father. “Like that friend of Donald Duck’s. Hey Goofy.”  
  
  And what once had been Best in Show suddenly slipped and shifted. For Fat Charlie, it was as if he saw the dog through his father’s eyes, and darned if he wasn’t a pretty goofy dog, all things considered. Almost rubbery.  
  
  It didn’t take long for the name to spread up and down the street. Campbell’s Macinrory Arbuthnot the Seventh’s owners struggled with it, but they might as well have stood their ground and argued with a hurricane. Total strangers would pat the once proud boxer’s head, and say, “Hello, Goofy. How’s a boy?” The dog’s owners stopped entering him in dog shows soon after that. They didn’t have the heart. “Goofy-looking dog,” said the judges.  
  
  Fat Charlie’s father’s names for things stuck. That was just how it was.  
  
  That was far from the worst thing about Fat Charlie’s father.  
  
  There had been, during the years that Fat Charlie was growing up, a number of candidates for the worst thing about his father: his roving eye and equally as adventurous fingers, at least according to the young ladies of the area, who would complain to Fat Charlie’s mother, and then there would be trouble; the little black cigarillos, which he called cheroots, which he smoked, the smell of which clung to everything he touched; his fondness for a peculiar shuffling form of tap dancing only ever fashionable, Fat Charlie suspected, for half an hour in Harlem in the 1920s; his total and invincible ignorance about current world affairs, combined with his apparent conviction that sitcoms were half-hour-long insights into the lives and struggles of real people. These, individually, as far as Fat Charlie was concerned, were none of them the worst thing about Fat Charlie’s father, although each of them had contributed to the worst thing.  
  
  The worst thing about Fat Charlie’s father was simply this: He was embarrassing.  
  
  Of course, everyone’s parents are embarrassing. It goes with the territory. The nature of parents is to embarrass merely by existing, just as it is the nature of children of a certain age to cringe with embarrassment, shame, and mortification should their parents so much as speak to them on the street.  
  
  Fat Charlie’s father, of course, had elevated this to an art form, and he rejoiced in it, just as he rejoiced in practical jokes, from the simple—Fat Charlie would never forget the first time he had climbed into an apple-pie bed—to the unimaginably complex.  
  
  “Like what?” asked Rosie, Fat Charlie’s fiancée, one evening, when Fat Charlie, who normally did not talk about his father, had attempted, stumblingly, to explain why he believed that simply inviting his father to their upcoming wedding would be a horrendously bad idea. They were in a small wine bar in South London at the time. Fat Charlie had long been of the opinion that four thousand miles and the Atlantic Ocean were both good things to keep between himself and his father.  
  
  “Well…” said Fat Charlie, and he remembered a parade of indignities, each one of which made his toes curl involuntarily. He settled upon one of them. “Well, when I changed schools, when I was a kid, my dad made a point of telling me how much he had always looked forward to Presidents’ Day, when he was a boy, because it’s the law that on Presidents’ Day, the kids who go to school dressed as their favorite presidents get a big bag of candy.”  
  
  “Oh. That’s a nice law,” said Rosie. “I wish we had something like that in England.” Rosie had never been out of the U.K., if you didn’t count a Club 18-30 holiday to an island in, she was fairly certain, the Mediterranean. She had warm brown eyes and a good heart, even if geography was not her strongest suit.  
  
  “It’s not a nice law,” said Fat Charlie. “It’s not a law at all. He made it up. Most states don’t even have school on Presidents’ Day, and even for the ones that do, there is no tradition of going to school on Presidents’ Day dressed as your favorite president. Kids dressed as presidents do not get big bags of candy by an act of Congress, nor is your popularity in the years ahead, all through middle school and high school, decided entirely by which president you decided to dress as—the average kids dress as the obvious presidents, the Lincolns and Washingtons and Jeffersons, but the ones who would become popular, they dressed as John Quincy Adams or Warren Gamaliel Harding, or someone like that. And it’s bad luck to talk about it before the day. Or rather it isn’t, but he said it was.”  
  
  “Boys and girls dress up as presidents?”  
  
  “Oh yes. Boys and girls. So I spent the week before Presidents’ Day reading everything there was to read about presidents in the World Book Encyclopedia, trying to choose the right one.”  
  
  “Didn’t you ever suspect that he was pulling your leg?”  
  
  Fat Charlie shook his head. “It’s not something you think about, when my dad starts to work you over. He’s the finest liar you’ll ever meet. He’s convincing.”  
  
  Rosie took a sip of her Chardonnay. “So which President did you go to school as?”  
  
  “Taft. He was the twenty-seventh president. I wore a brown suit my father had found somewhere, with the legs all rolled up and a pillow stuffed down the front. I had a painted-on moustache. My dad took me to school himself that day. I walked in so proudly. The other kids just screamed and pointed, and somewhere in there I locked myself in a cubicle in the boys’ room and cried. They wouldn’t let me go home to change. I went through the day like that. It was Hell.”  
  
  “You should have made something up,” said Rosie. “You were going to a costume party afterwards or something. Or just told them the truth.”  
  
  “Yeah,” said Fat Charlie meaningfully and gloomily, remembering.  
  
  “What did your dad say, when you got home?”  
  
  “Oh, he hooted with laughter. Chuckled and chortled and, and chittered and all that. Then he told me that maybe they didn’t do that Presidents’ Day stuff anymore. Now, why didn’t we go down to the beach together and look for mermaids?”  
  
  “Look for…mermaids?”  
  
  “We’d go down to the beach, and walk along it, and he’d be as embarrassing as any human being on the face of this planet  
has ever been—he’d start singing, and he’d start doing a shuffling sort of sand-dance on the sand, and he’d just talk to people as he went—people he didn’t even know, people he’d never met, and I hated it, except he told me there were mermaids out there in the Atlantic, and if I looked fast enough and sharp enough, I’d see one.  
  
  “‘There!’ he’d say. ‘Did you see her? She was a big ol’ redhead, with a green tail.’ And I looked, and I looked, but I never did.”  
  
  He shook his head. Then he took a handful of mixed nuts from the bowl on the table and began to toss them into his mouth, chomping down on them as if each nut was a twenty-year-old indignity that could never be erased.  
  
  “Well,” said Rosie, brightly, “I think he sounds lovely, a real character! We have to get him to come over for the wedding. He’d be the life and soul of the party.”  
  
  Which, Fat Charlie explained, after briefly choking on a Brazil nut, was really the last thing you wanted at your wedding, after all, wasn’t it, your father turning up and being the life and soul of the party? He said that his father was, he had no doubt, still the most embarrassing person on God’s Green Earth. He added that he was perfectly happy not to have seen the old goat for several years, and that the best thing his mother ever did was to leave his father and come to England to stay with her Aunt Alanna. He buttressed this by stating categorically that he was damned, double-damned, and quite possibly even thrice-damned if he was going to invite his father. In fact, said Fat Charlie in closing, the best thing about getting married was not having to invite his dad to their wedding.  
  
  And then Fat Charlie saw the expression on Rosie’s face and the icy glint in her normally friendly eyes, and he corrected himself hurriedly, explaining that he meant the second-best, but it was already much too late.  
  
  “You’ll just have to get used to the idea,” said Rosie. “After all, a wedding is a marvelous opportunity for mending fences and building bridges. It’s your opportunity to show him that there are no hard feelings.

But there are hard feelings,” said Fat Charlie. “Lots.”  
  
  “Do you have an address for him?” asked Rosie. “Or a phone number? You probably ought to phone him. A letter’s a bit impersonal when your only son is getting married…you are his only son, aren’t you? Does he have e-mail?”  
  
  “Yes. I’m his only son. I have no idea if he has e-mail or not. Probably not,” said Fat Charlie. Letters were good things, he thought. They could get lost in the post for a start.  
  
  “Well, you must have an address or a phone number.”  
  
  “I don’t,” said Fat Charlie, honestly. Maybe his father had moved away. He could have left Florida and gone somewhere they didn’t have telephones. Or addresses.  
  
  “Well,” said Rosie, sharply, “who does?”  
  
  “Mrs. Higgler,” said Fat Charlie, and all the fight went out of him.  
  
  Rosie smiled sweetly. “And who is Mrs. Higgler?” she asked.  
  
  “Friend of the family,” said Fat Charlie. “When I was growing up, she used to live next door.”  
  
  He had spoken to Mrs. Higgler several years earlier, when his mother was dying. He had, at his mother’s request, telephoned Mrs. Higgler to pass on the message to Fat Charlie’s father, and to tell him to get in touch. And several days later there had been a message on Fat Charlie’s answering machine, left while he was at work, in a voice that was unmistakably his father’s, even if it did sound rather older and a little drunk.  
  
  His father said that it was not a good time, and that business affairs would be keeping him in America. And then he added that, for everything, Fat Charlie’s mother was a damn fine woman. Several days later a vase of assorted flowers had been delivered to the hospital ward. Fat Charlie’s mother had snorted when she read the card.  
  
  “Thinks he can get around me that easily?” she said. “He’s got another think coming, I can tell you that.” But she had had the nurse put the flowers in a place of honor by her bed and, several times since, had asked Fat Charlie if he had heard anything about his father coming and visiting her before it was all over.  
  
  Fat Charlie said he hadn’t. He grew to hate the question, and his answer, and the expression on her face when he told her that, no, his father wasn’t coming.  
  
  The worst day, in Fat Charlie’s opinion, was the day that the doctor, a gruff little man, had taken Fat Charlie aside and told him that it would not be long now, that his mother was fading fast, and it had become a matter of keeping her comfortable until the end.  
  
  Fat Charlie had nodded, and gone in to his mother. She had held his hand, and was asking him whether or not he had remembered to pay her gas bill, when the noise began in the corridor—a clashing, parping, stomping, rattling, brass-and-bass-and-drum sort of noise, of the kind that tends not to be heard in hospitals, where signs in the stairwells request quiet and the icy glares of the nursing staff enforce it.  
  
  The noise was getting louder.  
  
  For one moment Fat Charlie thought it might be terrorists. His mother, though, smiled weakly at the cacophony. “Yellow bird,” she whispered.  
  
  “What?” said Fat Charlie, scared that she had stopped making sense.  
  
  “‘Yellow Bird,’” she said, louder and more firmly. “It’s what they’re playing.”  
  
  Fat Charlie went to the door, and looked out.  
  
  Coming down the hospital corridor, ignoring the protests of nurses, the stares of patients in pajamas and of their families, was what appeared to be a very small New Orleans jazz band. There was a saxophone and a sousaphone and a trumpet. There was an enormous man with what looked like a double bass strung around his neck. There was a man with a bass drum, which he banged. And at the head of the pack, in a smart checked suit, wearing a fedora hat and lemon yellow gloves, came Fat Charlie’s father. He played no instrument but was doing a soft-shoe-shuffle along the polished linoleum of the hospital floor, lifting his hat to each of the medical staff in turn, shaking hands with anyone who got close enough to talk or to attempt to complain.  
  
  Fat Charlie bit his lip, and prayed to anyone who might be listening that the earth would open and swallow him up or, failing that, that he might suffer a brief, merciful and entirely fatal heart attack. No such luck. He remained among the living, the brass band kept coming, his father kept dancing and shaking hands and smiling.  
  
  If there is any justice in the world, thought Fat Charlie, my father will keep going down the corridor, and he’ll go straight past us and into the genito-urinary department; however, there was no justice, and his father reached the door of the oncology ward and stopped.  
  
  “Fat Charlie,” he said, loudly enough that everyone in the ward—on that floor—in the hospital—was able to comprehend that this was someone who knew Fat Charlie. “Fat Charlie, get out of the way. Your father is here.”  
  
  Fat Charlie got out of the way.  
  
  The band, led by Fat Charlie’s father, snaked their way through the ward to Fat Charlie’s mother’s bed. She looked up at them as they approached, and she smiled.  
  
  “‘Yellow Bird,’” she said, weakly. “It’s my favorite song.”  
  
  “And what kind of man would I be if I forgot that?” asked Fat Charlie’s father.  
  
  She shook her head slowly, and she reached out her hand and squeezed his hand in its lemon yellow glove.  
  
  “Excuse me,” said a small white woman with a clipboard, “are these people with you?”  
  
  “No,” said Fat Charlie, his cheeks heating up. “They’re not. Not really.”  
  
  “But that is your mother, isn’t it?” said the woman, with a basilisk glance. “I must ask you to make these people vacate the ward momentarily, and without incurring any further disturbance.”  
  
  Fat Charlie muttered.  
  
  “What was that?”  
  
  “I said, I’m pretty sure I can’t make them do anything,” said Fat Charlie. He was consoling himself that things could not possibly get any worse, when his father took a plastic carrier bag from the drummer and began producing cans of brown ale and handing them out to his band, to the nursing staff, to the patients. Then he lit a cheroot.  
  
  “Excuse me,” said the woman with the clipboard, when she saw the smoke, and she launched herself across the room at Fat Charlie’s father like a Scud missile with its watch on upside down.  
  
  Fat Charlie took that moment to slip away. It seemed the wisest course of action.  
  
  He sat at home that night, waiting for the phone to ring or for a knock on the door, in much the same spirit that a man kneeling at the guillotine might wait for the blade to kiss his neck; still, the doorbell did not ring.  
  
  He barely slept, and slunk in to the hospital the following afternoon prepared for the worst.  
  
  His mother, in her bed, looked happier and more comfortable than she had looked in months. “He’s gone back,” she told Fat Charlie, when he came in. “He couldn’t stay. I have to say, Charlie, I do wish you hadn’t just gone like that. We wound up having a party here. We had a fine old time.”  
  
  Fat Charlie could think of nothing worse than having to attend a party in a cancer ward, thrown by his father with a jazz band. He didn’t say anything.  
  
  “He’s not a bad man,” said Fat Charlie’s mother, with a twinkle in her eye. Then she frowned. “Well, that’s not exactly true. He’s certainly not a good man. But he did me a power of good last night,” and she smiled, a real smile and, for just a moment, looked young again.  
  
  The woman with the clipboard was standing in the doorway, and she crooked her finger at him. Fat Charlie beetled down the ward toward her, apologizing before she was even properly within earshot. Her look, he realized, as he got closer to her, was no longer that of a basilisk with stomach cramps. Now she looked positively kittenish. “Your father,” she said.  
  
  “I’m sorry,” said Fat Charlie. It was what he had always said, growing up, when his father was mentioned.  
  
  “No, no, no,” said the former basilisk. “Nothing to apologize for. I was just wondering. Your father. In case we need to get in touch with him—we don’t have a tel  
ephone number or an address on file. I should have asked him last night, but it completely got away from me.”  
  
  “I don’t think he has a phone number,” said Fat Charlie. “And the best way to find him is to go to Florida, and to drive up Highway A1A—that’s the coast road that runs up most of the east of the state. In the afternoon you may find him fishing off a bridge. In the evening he’ll be in a bar.”  
  
  “Such a charming man,” she said, wistfully. “What does he do?”  
  
  “I told you. He says it’s the miracle of the loafs and the fishes.”  
  
  She stared at him blankly, and he felt stupid. When his father said it, people would laugh. “Um. Like in the Bible. The miracle of the loaves and the fishes. Dad used to say that he loafs and fishes, and it’s a miracle that he still makes money. It was a sort of joke.”  
  
  A misty look. “Yes. He told the funniest jokes.” She clucked her tongue, and once more was all business. “Now, I need you back here at five-thirty.”  
  
  “Why?”  
  
  “To pick up your mother. And her belongings. Didn’t Dr. Johnson tell you we were discharging her?”  
  
  “You’re sending her home?”  
  
  “Yes, Mr. Nancy.”  
  
  “What about the, about the cancer?”  
  
  “It seems to have been a false alarm.”  
  
  Fat Charlie couldn’t understand how it could have been a false alarm. Last week they’d been talking about sending his mother to a hospice. The doctor had been using phrases like “weeks not months” and “making her as comfortable as possible while we wait for the inevitable.”  
  
  Still, Fat Charlie came back at 5:30 and picked up his mother, who seemed quite unsurprised to learn that she was no longer dying. On the way home she told Fat Charlie that she would be using her life savings to travel around the world.  
  
  “The doctors were saying I had three months,” she said. “And I remember I thought, if I get out of this hospital bed then I’m going to see Paris and Rome and places like that. I’m going back to Barbados, and to Saint Andrews. I may go to Africa. And China. I like Chinese food.”  
  
  Fat Charlie wasn’t sure what was going on, but whatever it was, he blamed his father. He accompanied his mother and a serious suitcase to Heathrow Airport, and waved her good-bye at the international departures gate. She was smiling hugely as she went through, clutching her passport and tickets, and she looked younger than he remembered her looking in many years.  
  
  She sent him postcards from Paris, and from Rome and from Athens, and from Lagos and Cape Town. Her postcard from Nanking told him that she certainly didn’t like what passed for Chinese food in China, and that she couldn’t wait to come back to London and eat proper Chinese food.  
  
  She died in her sleep in a hotel in Williamstown, on the Caribbean island of Saint Andrews.  
  
  At the funeral, at a South London crematorium, Fat Charlie kept expecting to see his father: perhaps the old man would make an entrance at the head of a jazz band, or be followed down the aisle by a clown troupe or a half-dozen tricycle-riding, cigar-puffing chimpanzees; even during the service Fat Charlie kept glancing back, over his shoulder, toward the chapel door. But Fat Charlie’s father was not there, only his mother’s friends and distant relations, mostly big women in black hats, blowing their noses and dabbing at their eyes and shaking their heads.  
  
  It was during the final hymn, after the button had been pressed and Fat Charlie’s mother had trundled off down the conveyor belt to her final reward, that Fat Charlie noticed a man of about his own age standing at the back of the chapel. It was not his father, obviously. It was someone he did not know, someone he might not even have noticed, at the back, in the shadows, had he not been looking for his father…and then there was the stranger, in an elegant black suit, his eyes lowered, his hands folded.  
  
  Fat Charlie let his glance linger a moment too long, and the stranger looked at Fat Charlie and flashed him a joyless smile of the kind that suggested that they were both in this together. It was not the kind of expression you see on the faces of strangers, but still, Fat Charlie could not place the man. He turned his face back to the front of the chapel. They sang “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,” a song Fat Charlie was pretty sure his mother had always disliked, and the Reverend Wright invited them back to Fat Charlie’s Great-Aunt Alanna’s for something to eat.  
  
  There was nobody at his Great-Aunt Alanna’s whom he did not already know. In the years since his mother had died, he sometimes wondered about that stranger: who he was, why he was there. Sometimes Fat Charlie thought that he had simply imagined him…  
  
  “So,” said Rosie, draining her Chardonnay, “you’ll call your Mrs. Higgler and give her my mobile number. Tell her about the wedding and the date…that’s a thought: do you think we should invite her?”  
  
  “We can if we like,” said Fat Charlie. “I don’t think she’ll come. She’s an old family friend. She knew my dad back in the dark ages.”  
  
  “Well, sound her out. See if we should send her an invitation.”  
  
  Rosie was a good person. There was in Rosie a little of the essence of Francis of Assisi, of Robin Hood, of Buddha and of Glinda the Good: the knowledge that she was about to bring together her true love and his estranged father gave her forthcoming wedding an extra dimension, she decided. It was no longer simply a wedding: it was now practically a humanitarian mission, and Fat Charlie had known Rosie long enough to know never to stand between his fiancée and her need to Do Good.  
  
  “I’ll call Mrs. Higgler tomorrow,” he said.  
  
  “Tell you what,” said Rosie, with an endearing wrinkle of her nose, “call her tonight. It’s not late in America, after all.”  
  
  Fat Charlie nodded. They walked out of the wine bar together, Rosie with a spring in her step, Fat Charlie like a man going to the gallows. He told himself not to be silly: After all, perhaps Mrs. Higgler had moved, or had her phone disconnected. It was possible. Anything was possible.  
  
  They went up to Fat Charlie’s place, the upstairs half of a smallish house in Maxwell Gardens, just off the Brixton Road.  
  
  “What time is it in Florida?” Rosie asked.  
  
  “Late afternoon,” said Fat Charlie.  
  
  “Well. Go on then.”  
  
  “Maybe we should wait a bit. In case she’s out.”  
  
  “And maybe we should call now, before she has her dinner.”  
  
  Fat Charlie found his old paper address book, and under it was a scrap of an envelope, in his mother’s handwriting, with a telephone number on it, and beneath that, Callyanne Higgler.  
  
  The phone rang and rang.  
  
  “She’s not there,” he said to Rosie, but at that moment the phone at the other end was answered, and a female voice said “Yes? Who is this?”  
  
  “Um. Is that Mrs. Higgler?”  
  
  “Who is this?” said Mrs. Higgler. “If you’re one of they damn telemarketers, you take me off your list right now or I sue. I know my rights.”  
  
  “No. It’s me. Charles Nancy. I used to live next door to you.”  
  
  “Fat Charlie? If that don’t beat all. I been looking for your number all this morning. I turn this place upside down, looking for it, and you think I could find it? What I think happen was I had it written in my old accounts book. Upside down I turn the place. And I say to myself, Callyanne, this is a good time to just pray and hope the Lord hear you and see you right, and I went down on my knees, well, my knees are not so good any more, so I just put my hands together, but anyway, I still don’t find your number, but look at how you just phone me up, and that’s even better from some points of view, particularly because I ain’t made of money and I can’t afford to go phoning no foreign countries even for something like this, although I was going to phone you, don’t you worry, given the circumstances—”  
  
  And she stopped, suddenly, either to take a breath, or to take a sip from the huge mug of too-hot coffee she always carried in her left hand, and during the brief quiet Fat Charlie said, “I want to ask my dad to come to my wedding. Getting married.” There was silence at the end of the line. “It  
’s not till the end of the year, though,” he said. Still silence. “Her name’s Rosie,” he added, helpfully. He was starting to wonder if they had been cut off; conversations with Mrs. Higgler were normally somewhat one-sided affairs, often with her doing your lines for you, and here she was, letting him say three whole things uninterrupted. He decided to go for a fourth. “You can come too if you want,” he said.  
  
  “Lord, lord, lord,” said Mrs. Higgler. “Nobody tell you?”  
  
  “Told me what?”  
  
  So she told him, at length and in detail, while he stood there and said nothing at all, and when she was done he said “Thank you, Mrs. Higgler.” He wrote something down on a scrap of paper, then he said, “Thanks. No, really, thanks,” again, and he put down the phone.  
  
  “Well?” asked Rosie. “Have you got his number?”  
  
  Fat Charlie said, “Dad won’t be coming to the wedding.” Then he said, “I have to go to Florida.” His voice was flat, and without emotion. He might have been saying, “I have to order a new checkbook.”  
  
  “When?”  
  
  “Tomorrow.”  
  
  “Why?”  
  
  “Funeral. My dad’s. He’s dead.”  
  
  “Oh. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” She put her arms around him, and held him. He stood in her arms like a shop-window dummy. “How did it, did he…was he ill?”  
  
  Fat Charlie shook his head. “I don’t want to talk about it,” he said.  
  
  And Rosie squeezed him tightly, and then she nodded, sympathetically, and let him go. She thought he was too overcome with grief to talk about it.  
  
  He wasn’t. That wasn’t it at all. He was too embarrassed.  
  
  THERE MUST BE A HUNDRED THOUSAND RESPECTABLE WAYS TO die. Leaping off a bridge into a river to save a small child from drowning, for example, or being mown down in a hail of bullets while single-handedly storming a nest of criminals. Perfectly respectable ways to die.  
  
  Truth to tell, there were even some less-than-respectable ways to die that wouldn’t have been so bad. Spontaneous human combustion, for example: it’s medically dodgy and scientifically unlikely, but even so, people persist in going up in smoke, leaving nothing behind but a charred hand still clutching an unfinished cigarette. Fat Charlie had read about it in a magazine: he wouldn’t have minded if his father had gone like that. Or even if he’d had a heart attack running down the street after the men who had stolen his beer money.

1loa3f6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1loa3f6/what_makes_the_elite_gourmet_ekt719_electric/,What Makes the Elite Gourmet EKT719 Electric Kettle Ideal for Travelers?,"Compact, lightweight, and incredibly functional, the Elite Gourmet EKT719 quickly became a staple in my kitchen arsenal. Whether I was testing its efficiency or exploring its features for travel convenience, this electric kettle proved itself versatile in almost every aspect. The first encounter with the kettle had me intrigued by its sleek black brushed finish and the promise of a double-wall cool-touch exterior. For someone constantly brewing tea and coffee, the insulation feature was particularly appealing—it’s safe, tidy, and modern.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
The ergonomic design grabbed my attention right out of the box. Measuring just 6.5 x 6 x 7.6 inches, it’s remarkably compact, and the retractable handle enhances its portability. This isn’t just a kettle for your kitchen; it transitions beautifully into on-the-go scenarios. The matte black finish gives it a premium, modern touch, and the brushed exterior adds an element of sophistication. If you’ve got limited countertop space or live in a dorm room or RV, this product feels tailor-made for you.

**Performance that Speaks Volumes**  
The Elite Gourmet kettle doesn’t just look good—it delivers speed. Boiling up to 0.6 liters of water in under three minutes took me by surprise during testing. The concealed heating element ensures both energy efficiency and a quick turnaround time, whether I’m prepping ramen, brewing baby formula, or simply making tea. The automatic shut-off paired with boil-dry protection guarantees safety, letting me leave it unattended without worry.

[Check Elite Gourmet EKT719 price on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b0cr6tmxcx/)

**Cooking Versatility for Daily Use**  
I didn’t limit this kettle to just brewing tea. While testing, I managed to prepare instant oats and even experiment with making soft-boiled eggs. The stainless-steel interior paired with the wide free-flow spout ensures not only durability but also an effortless pour. It’s incredibly user-friendly for multifunctional use, and families with varying needs might appreciate this added dimension.

**Highlights of the Elite Gourmet Kettle**  
- Built-in dual voltage settings allow use between 120VAC and 220–240VAC.  
- Double-wall insulation keeps external surfaces cool while retaining heat inside.  
- Lightweight design and retractable handle make it perfect for travel.  
- Easy-to-clean hinged-lid design coupled with a one-touch button for convenience.  
- LED power indicator eliminates confusion, especially in dimly lit spaces.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Limited water capacity might not suit larger households or heavy usage.  
- Hinged locking lid can feel a bit stiff at times—a minor annoyance when rushing.  
- Cord length is slightly shorter than expected, limiting reach when plugs are further away.  

**Competing Brands**  
In comparison to other compact kettles like the Cosori or the Hamilton Beach Compact model, the Elite Gourmet EKT719 outperforms in portability. However, the Cosori offers a bigger capacity and feels slightly sturdier when handling bulkier tasks. On the other hand, competitors like Aroma Housewares come with additional temperature settings which give them an edge for users who prefer precise control. Where this kettle shines is its simplicity, travel-friendly design, and cool-touch double-wall feature, which not every compact kettle includes.

**Quality for Price**  
What made this kettle stand out isn’t just its efficiency but how much value it delivers for its size and features. While there are cheaper options on the market, they often compromise durability, convenience, or design. Its dual-voltage capability, in particular, makes every penny feel worthwhile because frequent travelers won’t need to invest in an additional product. Knowing that this model prioritizes safety and insulation ensures peace of mind while also offering an affordable quality option.

I, 31F, had been friends with the bride, “Annie” 28F, for about 6 years but in the last 2 years the friendship has fizzled. She never accepted my invitations for coffee, lunch or anything else really. I thought it would have been because she has 2 kids so I wasn’t bitter but I seen she was hanging out with other people. A few months ago I decided to just stop trying, I never confronted her about the friendship being over, I didn’t even think she’d notice or care. The straw that broke the camels back came when I was on a night out and a friend of hers saw me, said hello and then said “you used to be friends with Annie, didn’t you?” I replied with “I still am?” And she replied with a condescending “oh okay, sure” and walked away.

Imagine my surprise when I got a wedding invitation to her wedding, well not a physical invitation, it was an invitation screenshot through Snapchat. I decided I wasn’t going to go, despite my reservations about our relationship, I appreciated the invite but I’ve made my peace with the fact that she’s no longer a friend but an acquaintance. I thought I’d send her a gift or a card with money but that’s it. She provided a link to RSVP and my dumb ass accidentally clicked Yes to attend.

I sincerely do not want to attend this wedding. I’m the type of person whose problems weight heavily on them. This is weighing heavily on me. I’m also not one for confrontation and don’t want to start anything a week before her wedding. What excuse could I give to not attend?",24,1751296312.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,45,0.96,False

she doesn’t even have kids. she has a dog she dresses like a toddler and calls her “baby.” that’s her parenting experience. so yesterday, i pulled her aside and said, “i need you to stop undermining me when i discipline my kids. you're confusing them. and you're making me look like the bad guy every time.” she gave me this look. like i was the crazy one. then she told my husband i “snapped” at her. and now he’s all weird about it. like i hurt her feelings or something. i don’t know. i’m tired. i’m trying to raise decent human beings, and i feel like i’m fighting both my kids and the adults in the house. i didn’t yell. i didn’t curse. i just asked her nicely to let me parent. but now everything’s tense. she barely talks to me. my husband says i “could’ve handled it better.” what does that even mean?

I'm a flat-chested girl ~ and I mean really flat. Even wearing a push-up bra doesn’t give me that cleavage effect, lol. I’ve been super insecure about it, especially since some of my classmates and even friends have pointed it out.

Because of that, I started wearing padded bras (which I honestly don’t like doing). Sometimes I worry ~ what if I get a boyfriend someday? I avoid hugs because I’m scared people might notice. These insecurities started back when COVID restrictions were lifted and we returned to school. I was in Grade 10 then. Now I’m 18 and about to enter college in a different city.

I’m thinking of just wearing regular bras without any padding from now on, but I still feel unsure. Has anyone else been through this? I’d really appreciate some advice or encouragement.

I have another problem which is  I can’t wear fitted clothes at all because my belly always looks bloated — even when I haven’t eaten anything. I’m not overweight; I wear a size S-M. But for some reason, my stomach just gets really bloated, especially after eating. It makes me feel even more self-conscious.

Does anyone know what might be causing this? Or have tips on how to manage or reduce bloating?

Most stuck to Shibuya crossings, neon corridors, and conveyor belt sushi. That’s fine. More farm lunch for the rest.

Roughly 12.7% of Japan’s agricultural output comes from vegetables. Mountain greens, gobo roots, and things with names that sound like spells. That’s what lands on the table here.

The lunch is served in courses that feel accidental. First comes a dish of pickled burdock root shaved into ribbons so thin they curl like cigarette ash. Then a bowl of yuba, delicate tofu skin, drifting in a shallow pool of soy broth with flecks of yuzu rind floating like citrus confetti. Someone cracks open a bottle of homemade umeshu plum wine, and things start to drift sideways in the best possible way. There’s no menu. No laminated options or QR codes. What gets harvested in the morning shows up, still steaming, by noon.

A farmer named Haruki, whose teeth are stained with tobacco and miso, pushes a platter of tempura made from wild greens foraged off the slope behind his house. They’re flash-fried in sesame oil and salted like they’re trying to kill a hangover. It’s better than anything in the city and costs the equivalent of a convenience store bento. His laugh is full-body. His English is limited, but his hospitality is unmatched.

Behind the lunch area, there’s a trail that snakes up to Sanzen-in Temple, where monks chant in tones that feel older than weather. Tourists with trekking poles and brand-new hiking boots appear, nod, and disappear. The farmers never notice. They’re elbow-deep in rice vinegar or squinting at daikon that might need another day underground. One man insists you try the miso he made in his shed last winter. It’s been fermenting in cedar barrels next to pickled sansho peppers. The result tastes like something illicit, deep and smoky, a flavor that doesn’t translate but sticks to your molars for hours.

The air smells like wet cedar and grilled leeks. There’s no background music, no digital tip jar. Chickens scratch in the weeds next to a compost pile bigger than most Tokyo kitchens. Every dish feels earned, not because it’s expensive or rare, but because you’ve had to sit still long enough to notice it. That’s the tax here. Silence. Stillness. Chewing with purpose.

A group of tourists from Osaka sits nearby, their kids poking at tofu like it might explode. An old woman, barely five feet tall and built like a broomstick, tells them it was made with water from the mountain spring, and if they complain, they’ll get nothing but rice. No one complains.

The afternoon stretches like udon dough. You’re given one last bite, a mochi ball stuffed with shiso leaf and crushed walnuts, before being sent off down the path with a half-bow and a plastic bag of pickled eggplant you didn’t ask for. You’re not allowed to pay what it’s worth. That’s the point. Eat, go, and carry it somewhere in your gut for the next hundred miles.

There’s no street sign, no hashtag. Just steam, rice, and hands that have done this a thousand times. This isn’t a food tour. This is a lunch you don’t forget, whether you meant to find it or not.

1lo9vkm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lo9vkm,Dollar Tree Garnier Fructis Charcoal Micellar Cleansing Jelly Water in depth test!,"Dollar Tree Garnier Charcoal Micellar Cleansing Jelly Water vs 4 Garnier Cleansing Waters [in-depth test]

Hi! Thank you to the person who spotted Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Jelly Water with Charcoal in the large full size 13.5 oz at Dollar Tree today. It did ring up for only $1.25 when the retail was around $10.49. I am looking at the Garnier website now and it’s the only one that I see has been discontinued. 

I happen to have four other Garnier Micellar waters and wanted to give a comparison of their performance against some various makeup I have that are on the more stubborn side. 

##The Micellar Waters & Jelly

Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water
* (white cap) All-in-1 Purifying with Salicylic Acid for Oily to Acne Prone Skin. The newest of the line up. 
* (pink cap) All-in-1 for All Skin Types, even Sensitive 
* (blue cap) All-in-1 Waterproof, removes even waterproof mascara, for All Skin Types, even Sensitive 
* (yellow cap) All-in-1 Brightening with Vitamin C, for Dull Skin, even Sensitive. A newer addition. 

Note: I got the three smaller sized ones in last year’s 2024 Christmas holiday gift set at Ulta. 

And finally the Dollar Tree one:

Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Jelly Water
* (black cap) All-in-1 Purifying for Acne-prone Skin. A jelly texture. Discontinued. Says it can absorb oil. 

##The Test Products

I tested them all against:
* Elf Concealer
* Physicians Formula The Healthy Lip liquid lip (discontinued) in Raisin Immunity 
* Lancome Le Crayon Khol eye pencil in Black Coffee 
* Revlon Colorstay Line Creator Double Ended Eyeliner in Cool as Ice. Which has a navy blue Longwear liquid eyeliner that’s very budge proof on one side. . . 
* . . . And a white kohl pencil on the other. 
* Loreal Paris Matte Lip Crayon in No Fig Deal. 

##Test no.1 

(4th picture showing two side by side images of my arm)

On the first and only pass, all five made a dent in five of the six products. But some struggled with the white kohl pencil and the red lip crayon (bottom). 

Only the blue cap waterproof Micellar water made a significant, immediate impact on the Revlon navy blue Longwear liquid eyeliner. Shown as sign of wear in the middle of the swatch and in all the other swatches. 

If you wear stubborn, Longwear eye makeup, and want the quickest removal, the blue cap Waterproof Micellar water is far and away the best for the job. 

Seeing that the liquid eyeliner was the toughest test, led me to. . . 

##Test no. 2

(5th image showing five side by side images of my arm)

By this point you’ll see I ignored the other swatches and focused only on the navy blue eyeliner. 

I have listed the product names (far left) and the test specifics (top) on the image itself. 

I have one control image (no micellar water removal) and four other images showing one swipe, two swipe, three swipe and more. 

* Again the (blue cap) waterproof Micellar water performed the best from swipe 1. 
* The (white cap) salicylic acid micellar water followed in swipe 2. 
* The (pink cap) sensitive skin micellar water and (yellow cap) vitamin c micellar water seemed about equal. Perhaps the viramin C one pulled ahead. 
* After three swipes I began to just go at it. The (black cap) charcoal Micellar water performed the worst with the most eyeliner left on skin. 
* (not pictured) I rubbed some more and applied more product. And all micellar water did remove the eyeliner given enough time and additional product. 

Note: I only performed this test once and it was difficult to control exactly how much product I used. So this is not the most exact test. It’ll have to retest the Sensitive vs the Vitamin C one for example. But I do think all the Micellar waters did outperform the Micellar jelly water. 

##Conclusion 

The Dollar Tree Garnier Micellar Cleansing Jelly Water is discontinued, and I think it’s for the reason that it has the least performance of the five. It struggled against the Loreal red lip crayon more than the others, and performed the worst with the Revlon Longwear liquid eyeliner test. It did remove the other products easily, but they also were not budge proof (a finger swipe could smear them). 

I think the cleansing jelly is not well suited for Longwear makeup, and especially Longwear eye makeup. It may get the job eventually with much more rubbing than the rest. But it can be a help for easier to remove products. 

I havent yet tried the Charcoal Cleansing Jelly on my face. I’ll say the jelly texture seems fun. I would be interested in the oil control claim as I do have oily skin. 

But I have also heard that Micellar water in general is made to be rinsed off with a second cleanse (unless it is the Biodance micellar water) as otherwise the surfactants that are left on the skin can cause irritation. Some of the Micellar waters I have are marketed as dual skincare products, but i usually just second cleanse anyway because of the advice I’ve heard. 

##Recommendations: 

* For very frequent, fast waterproof eye makeup removal: Waterproof Micellar water 
* For oily skin + occasional eye makeup removal: salicylic acid micellar water 
* For sensitive skin + infrequent eye makeup removal: sensitive skin or vitamin C micellar water 
* For oily skin + very infrequent eye makeup removal or general light cleansing: charcoal micellar water 

I’m making these recommendations kinda at a guess based on the performance of this test as I don’t really use micellar water that often despite having four (now five). What can I say, I wanted to try them out. Also, remember I haven’t used the charcoal one on my face yet.

1lo9v00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1lo9v00/positive_tonsillectomy_experience/,Positive tonsillectomy experience :),"Hi all! 29, F - Got surgery in Mexico but live in the United States.  Wanted to share my great tonsillectomy experience because I feel like I only ever saw negative experiences on Reddit/Tiktok.

Medication: 
- Paracetemol 1g tablet every 6 hours
- Metamizol 1 500 mg table every 8 hours

My advice based on my experience: 
* drink TONS of water. Force yourself to drink water even throughout the night. Iced water is preferable but whatever you can swallow.  I didnt use a straw because my doctor advised me not to use one for the first week because of the suction ( I noticed everyone on Tiktok was using straws to drink and I didnt)

* eat ice cream! Everyone on Tikok was advising not to eat ice cream because it increases mucus production, but my doctor told me it was important to eat ice cream so it could reduce the swelling in my throat. I ate Mcdonalds' soft serve, Blue Bell Vanilla ice cream, and banana popsicles.
* dont miss a dose of pain medication! I set alarms to remind myself to take my pain medication and would wake up throughout the night. Pain level increased dramatically when it was time for a new dose. Try to break down your pills if possible because they will be tough to swallow.
* sleep on a wedge pillow. I made the mistake of trying to nap flat on my back and I could tell the difference.
* Stick to soft foods the first 7 days. I did not eat any hard food whatsoever...stuck to ice cream, soft mashed potatoes, applesauce, protein shakes, soups, and liquids. DO NOT try to eat rice or oatmeal because you will feel like they get stuck in your throat
* Use a jaw ice pack to help with ear pain and reduce swelling.
* rest as much as possible. I barely left my couch and slept like 14 hours a day. I am a very active person so it was pretty hard to stay still but I forced myself to rest and recuperate.
* Minimize talking. I noticed I was in much more pain the days I had visitors and talked more.
* Be careful with seasonings/spices. Pepper was even too spicy for me the first few days and the burn takes a while to subside.
* My doctor advised me not to drink caffeine for the first week so I didnt. I tried drinking matcha on day 10 and it burned my throat ( saw tons of people on Tiktok drinking iced coffee and iced matcha).



Day 1 (Surgery): Woke up with pain 1/10. Was more uncomfortable than anything else but I was also getting pain medication through IV and during surgery so makes sense I wouldn't feel pain. I did let the nurse know when I started feeling nauseous because of the anesthesia and she was able to quickly give me an anti nausea medication which was great. Ate an ice cream at the hospital and drank an apple juice with ice. Had to swallow extremely slow so I would let the ice melt in my mouth which helped the swelling. I tried to eat some chicken soup when I went home but the spices burned my throat. Stuck to ice cream and iced water. Slept on a wedge pillow and forced myself to wake up and drink iced water every hour.

Day 2: Even though I woke up every hour to drink water, my throat was still dry in the morning and a little painful. I ate an applesauce every time I had to take my pain medication so my stomach wouldn't get irritated. Pain on this day was about 2/10 and again more uncomfortable than anything. Chugged ice water and ate Sonic ice all day. Was able to eat some mashed potatoes but pretty uncomfortable. The night was the most uncomfortable, but forced myself to wake up to drink water and take my medicine on a schedule.

Day 3-4: Tongue was incredibly swollen and pretty painful. I couldn't open my mouth that much and I was only able to drink protein shakes or eat ice cream. Pain 4/10 but still forced myself to drink tons of water and let ice melt in my mouth. Ice cream definitely increased mucus in my throat, but I feel like that was helping me heal. Spit got really thick so I would wipe it off with a napkin every hour or so.  Forced myself to drink water and take medicine on schedule at night.

Day 5-7: Most painful days. Throat felt really tight, ears were feeling a lot of pressure, tongue was super painful, etc. Slept most of the days but still woke up to drink water and take pain medicine. DO NOT MISS A DOSE OF PAIN MEDICINE. I could tell when it was about time to take my next dose because pain would spike at these points. Banana popsicles were my life savers these days... I would take a tiny bite and let it melt in my throat and it felt like heaven. Also used a jaw ice pack whenever my ears started hurting and it would really help. Taste in my mouth was disgusting on these days. Pain 5/10

Day 8-10: I finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel here...pain decreased noticeable but throat still sore of course. I was able to eat really soft pasta here and drink gatorades. Most flavors and spices were still burning my throat so had to keep the diet plain and stick to blue gatorade. At this point, I had gotten tired of ice cream and the popsicles so was just eating ice. Taste in my mouth was gross and my breath smelled Pain 3/10

Day 10-12: Almost feel completely healed. I've noticed scabs are starting to come off but I haven't felt them whatsoever... I think because I've been chugging water and my mouth has never dried out. Ear pain still a little uncomfortable but tongue doesn't hurt anymore. Hurts to yawn and laugh. Pain 2/10.

Day 13-14: Was cleared by my doctor to go back to normal diet. Still sticking to eating pasta and chugging water. Tried eating chips and that was a huge mistake lol. Doctor was very impressed at the minimal pain I felt and attributed it to the amount of ice cream I ate (says it brings down swelling).

Day 16: Feeling great. No ear pain or tongue pain. Still have to swallow very slowly and my appetite is not completely back. I have also noticed that foods I could eat before my surgery are spicier post surgery. Trying not to eat fried foods/sharp foods because my throat is still tender. Can see I still have a few scabs but doctor says those will be gone in no time.",1,1751295869.0,Tonsillectomy,1,1.0,False

*As U.S. lawmakers embrace stablecoins with sweeping legislation, Canada faces pressure from Coinbase and crypto leaders to modernize its outdated regulations—or risk falling behind.*

https://preview.redd.it/bdqg161ix2af1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5279c5bc07a583555bfbef590faeb2152f5a48d7

Canada is standing at a crossroads while the United States races ahead with sweeping legislation to normalize cryptocurrency, particularly stablecoins, into the financial mainstream. At the forefront of the push to close the gap is Coinbase, the world-renowned crypto exchange, now campaigning aggressively to educate Canadian policymakers and ignite reform.

Leading the charge is Lucas Matheson, head of Coinbase’s Canadian operations. He’s sounding the alarm, urging the federal government to move beyond passive observation and begin crafting a framework that invites, rather than inhibits, the adoption of stablecoins. His message to Ottawa is urgent: match the U.S. momentum, or risk being left behind in a global financial evolution.

Stablecoins, unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, are designed to maintain a fixed value by pegging themselves to national currencies like the U.S. dollar. They promise faster cross-border payments, lower transaction fees, and smoother integration with e-commerce and retail systems. But there’s a catch. Without clear rules, questions about how these coins are backed—and by what—continue to haunt the sector. This uncertainty has kept regulators cautious, but it hasn’t slowed growth.

In Washington, change is moving fast. A new bill—backed by both industry and bipartisan lawmakers—would require stablecoin issuers to hold one-to-one reserves in cash or short-term treasuries. It also demands transparency through frequent disclosures. It’s a simple but powerful idea: if these coins are to act like money, they must be backed like money. The legislation offers the kind of credibility the crypto industry has long craved. And it’s working. The U.S. market is accelerating, setting a global standard.

Matheson hopes that by showing Canada what’s possible, the government will begin to act. But so far, Canadian regulators continue to treat stablecoins as securities—investment products—rather than payment tools. This makes their use in retail and financial systems unnecessarily complicated. In other words, if you want to use a stablecoin to buy a coffee, Canada thinks you’re making an investment.

Meanwhile, the rest of the world is not waiting. Tether, the largest U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, has surged from under $10 billion in circulation in 2020 to nearly $160 billion today. The company earned a staggering $13 billion in profit last year alone by simply collecting interest on U.S. treasuries. Standard Chartered believes the market could reach $2 trillion by 2028, and the U.S. legislation is poised to make that vision reality.

Canada’s private sector is already experimenting. In June, Shopify and Coinbase announced a partnership to make stablecoins a standard payment option across online storefronts. This could disrupt the traditional credit card model, offering merchants lower fees and quicker settlement times. For consumers, it opens a new realm of possibilities—token-gated experiences, NFT-based receipts, and loyalty programs linked to blockchain activity.

Matheson envisions a future where customers hold NFTs that unlock exclusive shopping access or earn digital “twins” of the products they buy. It’s not fantasy—it’s the beginning of a new digital retail economy. But for it to scale, Canada must provide the legal foundation.

Not all the news is positive. Stablecoins have also become a favorite for criminals. Research from Chainalysis revealed that over $51 billion in stablecoins were transferred to illicit addresses last year, making up 63 percent of all illegal crypto flows. Blockchain may be transparent in theory, but in practice, criminals use sophisticated tools to mask transactions and avoid detection.

This duality—promising innovation and potential misuse—makes regulation not just important, but essential. The Bank for International Settlements recently warned that if stablecoins continue their meteoric rise without oversight, they could threaten global financial stability. In its latest report, the BIS compared the current boom to 19th-century U.S. banking, when individual banks issued their own currency and confidence was fragile. If users begin to doubt the value or backing of a coin, panic could spread rapidly.

The BIS isn’t alone in raising concerns. There’s growing unease around the possibility of stablecoins evolving into interest-bearing instruments, blurring the line between digital currency and shadow banking. That’s why the U.S. legislation explicitly prohibits stablecoin issuers from offering yield—something Canadian regulators have also banned. But Matheson is pushing back. He wants Ottawa to allow interest payments on stablecoins, arguing that yield is a key driver of adoption.

Crypto has always had a reputation problem. From the FTX collapse to the parade of scams and shady dealings, it’s no wonder regulators remain wary. Even former U.S. President Donald Trump’s family has been involved in launching questionable crypto ventures, adding to the circus. But Coinbase and others insist the answer isn’t tighter restrictions—it’s clearer ones. Build proper rules, they argue, and the serious players will rise to the top.

Matheson believes Canada has a unique opportunity. With the right regulations, the country can become a global hub for stablecoin innovation. But that window won’t stay open forever. If Canada waits too long, it won’t be setting its own standards—it’ll be adopting those written by others.

This is more than a tech issue. It’s a question of national competitiveness. Countries that embrace regulated stablecoins will benefit from faster payments, improved financial inclusion, and new pathways for global trade. Those that don’t may find themselves playing catch-up in a digital economy shaped by others.

The stablecoin revolution is already in motion. It’s no longer about speculation or fringe internet money. It’s about building a better, faster, more inclusive financial system. And Canada has to decide whether it wants to lead or follow.",1,1751295796.0,Junior_Stocks,0,1.0,False
1lo9ttk,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1lo9ttk/my_satiety_protocol/,My Satiety Protocol,"Here are the things I do to deal with hunger when on an aggressive calorie deficit.

1. 1 meal a day. Meal prep in advance and prepare something that hits your calorie target and contains high protein and dietary fibre for satiation. There are many recipes you can follow. Chicken breast, mixed veg, and some form of carb like rice would be fine. If you do be meal a day, it’s psychological easier to say no to snacks, and you measure in advance so you know you are writhing your calorie limit so long as you only eat that meal. There aren’t really any other proven benefits to one meal a day, I just find that it helps me resist snacking because I see the day as a failure if I eat anything other than my one box of food. If you eat this meal at dinner time, it should keep you full until bedtime since it’s a large meal given that it’s all you will be eating. The hard part will be lasting until dinner time. For that I have 2 other tricks.

2. Black coffee. From waking until around 12 hours before sleeping, drink lots of black coffee. It’s effectively 0 calories, the caffeine is an appetite suppressant, and as far as the research shows, it’s healthy to consume in large volumes so long as you have a large buffer of time before bed. Black coffee alone will help you survive until around noon.

3. Sugar free mints or gum. Once you stop drinking coffee, swap to gum or mints. I used to eat xylitol sweetened mints but now there is research suggesting sugar alcohols may pose problems in high doses so perhaps find a sucralose or aspartame sweetened mint or gum. Get a minty flavour as that will make food less desirable because it will taste gross combine with the mintyness. The mints or gum will really help combat your hunger until dinner time. Don’t be afraid to eat or chew many pieces as the cost is negligible and the benefits of not cheating on the diet are high.

Full day example:
8:00am: wake
8:00am-12:00pm: black coffee only
12:00pm-5:00pm: sugar free gum or mints
5:00pm: dinner
5:00pm-11:00pm: more mints and gum
11:00pm: sleep

Basecamp mattered. I booked a [**home stey in lonavla**](https://retrofusion.in/) called **Retrofusion** and walked into a villa that feels curated, not commercial.

The clock ticked loudly, each second echoing in the stillness. I had just moved in, eager for a fresh start after a messy breakup. The walls were bare, the furniture sparse—just a couch, a table, and my laptop. I felt a strange mix of excitement and unease, but I brushed it off as the jitters of a new beginning.

As the hours passed, I decided to binge-watch a horror series to embrace the ambiance of my new home. The screen flickered with shadows and eerie sounds that made me jump, but I laughed it off. My phone buzzed on the table, a message from my best friend reminding me to lock the door. I smiled, feeling a sense of camaraderie despite my isolation.

Around midnight, I heard it—a soft scratching sound coming from the window. I paused the show and turned to face the sound, convinced it was just the wind. But then it happened again, louder this time, like fingernails dragging against the glass. My heart raced. I stood up, walking cautiously toward the window, peering into the darkness outside. Nothing. Just the empty street illuminated by the occasional flicker of a streetlight.

I tried to shake off the anxiety creeping in. Perhaps it was just a tree branch, I thought. I returned to the couch, but the scratching continued, more persistent now. I covered my ears, trying to drown it out with the show’s dialogue, but it only grew louder, more frantic. I couldn’t ignore it any longer.

Gathering my courage, I approached the window again. This time, I pulled back the curtain and stared into the night. My breath caught in my throat. There, just outside my window, was a figure—pale, gaunt, with hollow eyes staring directly at me. I stumbled back, my heart pounding in my chest. I blinked, hoping it was a trick of my imagination, but when I looked again, it was still there, unmoving.

I grabbed my phone, ready to call for help, but the figure raised a finger to its lips, shushing me. Fear gripped me, and I pressed my back against the wall, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. It felt surreal, like a nightmare I couldn’t wake from.

Suddenly, the scratching stopped, and the figure faded into the shadows, leaving me in the dim glow of my apartment. I was paralyzed with fear, unsure of what to do next. I locked the window, pulled the curtains shut, and retreated to my bedroom, my mind racing with thoughts of who—or what—I had just seen.

Hours passed, and sleep eluded me. I lay in bed, hearing every creak of the building, every rustle of the wind outside. Just as I began to doze off, I heard the scratching again, not from the window this time, but from my bedroom door. My heart dropped, and I held my breath, straining to hear. It was soft at first, but then it grew louder, more insistent.

I felt trapped in my own skin, paralyzed by fear. The scratching continued, and I could hear a whisper, barely audible, “Let me in…” It echoed in my mind, sending chills down my spine. I couldn’t move, couldn’t speak. The world around me faded as I succumbed to the terror.

The next morning, I awoke to sunlight streaming through my window, the scratching and whispers gone. I convinced myself it was all a bad dream, a product of my overactive imagination. But as I got up to make coffee, I noticed something on my bedroom floor—a small, muddy handprint, fingers splayed as if someone had tried to reach for me.

I left that apartment the same day, never looking back. Sometimes at night, I still hear the whispers, echoing in the silence, reminding me of the figure that came too close to my reality. And I wonder if it ever found someone else to let in.",3,1751295403.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Till i can talk with my counselor in two weeks regarding a recent lucid experience, I'm gonna work on my sleep hygiene....maybe these steps it will help others too.
 
1. Have a full stomach, feeling full, but not eating so close to bedtime. 

2. Sipping, not gulping, water and keeping it close by. 

3. Listen to a relaxing podcast, ocean waves, rain or storm sounds, or read a book thats not too exciting, a boring book lol, before bed. 

4. Get good enough hours of sleep during the night🌙 (internal clock reset), 

5. Keep your sleeping room cooler and temperature not too hot in your bedding or pillows, also turning on a fan, open the window, even a crack, for airflow. 

6. If your medicated, make sure your taking them accordingly. 

7. Change your clothes, don't sleep in your everyday clothes, go nude if you have to, or wear just underwear, and invest in some lighter fabric pajamas.

8. Use layers of thin blankets in bed, that way you can regulate the temperature by adding more, or kicking them off if it's too hot or cold.

9. Take a break from purposely lucid dreaming if thats what you were doing, and go to bed just to sleep and nothing else. Just to rest yourself. It may sound weird but you gotta get outta your head for a bit, and literally say to yourself, outloud even, that your going to bed, and that's it. Take the control back.

10. Start journaling your thoughts before you go to bed, or after you wake up. If you can't or are not ready to share with a counsellor or therapist. Write down your fears, problems, and let it out on paper 📃 although a temporary fix, it might help. Keep it, burn it, or throw it away whichever way you want, but dont flush the notes in the toilet.

11. If you take melatonin, or other sleep aids, go off them for a bit, and try to get physically exhausted enough to crash out without thinking at nighttime,go swimming or exercise,  and by crash i mean sleeping safely in bed.

By doing these things in self care it might help with the traumatic lucid feelings we're getting. I'm doing this because based on experience having a indigestion, empty stomach, poor quality sleep hours, sweating, overheating, shivering, depression, anxiety, physical pain like soreness, colds and flu, melatonin and sleep aids, can all cause nightmares.

Edit: forgot to add...""please add more about what works for you, any tips, advice, etc... no tidbit is too small, and just because its common sense to you, others could actually benefit. For example, I forgot to add limit caffeine intake. Its hard for me to even think that coffee could be the culprit because our relationship is so joyous, but too much of it can also cause nightmares.""",5,1751295051.0,LucidDreaming,3,0.86,False

This is a long one, so buckle up; also I'm aware of how childish this all sounds and I so wish I wasnt writing this in my 30's 😒. I (31F) used to be part of a local community theatre scene where I met *let’s call her Claire* (30F). From day one, Claire gave me bad vibes — very Rachel Berry-type energy: intense, performative, overly flattering in a way that made her compliments feel like low-key insults. But I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt.

Over time, Claire love-bombed me hard. She gave me random gifts, paid for things “to boost my confidence,” and inserted herself into every part of my life. But behind the scenes, she controlled every dynamic — especially through gossip and manipulation. She organized tea parties that were basically targeted smear campaigns. She’d rotate groups and talk shit about whoever wasn’t present. I stupidly believed I was immune to it.

She cast herself in roles she told me she didn’t want — including one I had told her meant everything to me. She constantly made me second-guess myself, asking things like “Are you *sure* you want to do it that way?” until I’d completely lose confidence in my decisions. At one point, she told me she had warned directors about me behind my back — pre-emptively tanking my opportunities under the guise of “protecting me.” That part destroyed me.

I found out much later that she had been sabotaging me for years. Having “coffee chats” with directors to tell them not to cast me. Framing me as difficult. People I’d never met had been warned about me in advance. I cannot explain how gutting it was to realize my biggest enemy had been presenting herself as my biggest supporter.

When I confronted her about a collaboration she wanted to do with a known abusive and transphobic director (which I blocked for the safety of our cast), she blew up and kicked me out of her wedding. Then told everyone it was my choice. She messaged me *afterward* to ask me not to attend mutual events because “she couldn’t handle seeing me.” I didn’t even defend myself publicly — I told people I just couldn’t make it.

What people didn’t know was that behind the scenes, I was spiraling. Her gaslighting made me question everything — my talent, my character, my self-worth. I lost sleep, my appetite, my joy. I genuinely reached a point where I no longer wanted to be alive. If it weren’t for my partner stepping in and grounding me, I might not be here to write this. And all of it — the smear campaigns, the controlling behavior, the isolation — had been so subtle, so slow, and so calculated that I didn’t even see it happening until it was too late. So much that happened that I couldnt possibly put it all in one post.

Claire eventually came crying to my house saying she “couldn’t get married without me.” No apology. Just tears. I agreed (chicken heart, I know), rebooked flights last minute — she promised to cover costs, never did — and the wedding was a miserable, expensive mess. The venue was remote and overpriced, nothing was included, and she sobbed the day before because she was marrying a man who “idolizes her, but is useless"" (her words).

After the wedding? Radio silence. She came to my show, brought flowers for *everyone in the cast (even people she didn't know) but me*. It was very clearly a planned move, and it broke me again.

Fast forward: we get cast to share a role. A mutual friend casually asks how I feel about it, and I honestly say, “I’m a little nervous. Claire has a history of turning people she shares roles with into enemies (which she does, they literally all share my fate). She tends to dominate rehearsals and treat co-leads like understudies.” It wasn’t a public announcement, just a vulnerable answer to a friend.

Somehow it gets back to Claire. She flips. Quits the board. Returns to the theatre company she once swore she despised and turned me against to. Puts money into actively blocking my theatre company and myself from opportunities. And to this day, I haven’t been cast again because she is backing the theatre's with money in exchange for casting decisions (which include casting herself into the lead in EVERY show). She also takes every opportunity she gets to take digs at me still a year after this happened.

So... **AITA for telling someone — honestly — that I was scared to share a role with someone who drove me to the brink of ending my life? ( I know rationally no, but should i have taken the high-road again and said nothing? )**",2,1751295046.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

In a world that glorifies false perfection and fleeting relationships, these words are a cry for every woman who has been told her dreams are ""too much."" You are not a fixer-upper project, and your longing for romance is not a ""need"" but your birthright. This message is for you, who deserves to be loved like a universe wrapped in skin.

### Why You Deserve More Than Crumbs

You’ve apologized for needing ""just a good morning text"" while he remains silent. Remember that your quiet love does not justify others treating you as an option. Being low-maintenance doesn’t mean accepting low effort. Affection is not a luxury; it is oxygen. We forget that a dawn kiss on your forehead outshines grand gestures. A whisper of ""You glow when you enter a room"" rebuilds your shattered self-worth. These are not extras but survival tools in an emotionally bankrupt world.

### True Love Is Freedom

When we say, ""No one will love you more than I do,"" it should mean freedom, not possession. It means: I will be the umbrella for your dreams in the storm, the ship that sails your rage through tidal waves, because you deserve love that adores your cracks, not just your polished mask.

### Live Letters from Life

To the woman crushed by comparisons, I won’t say ""you’re the prettiest."" I’ll say: Your anger burns like volcanoes birthing islands. The scent of your morning coffee is my holy wine. You are not in competition with anyone; you are the standard. And to the woman hiding behind ""strength,"" I see you carrying worlds on your spine. Let me hold their weight. Collapse into my arms—not because you’re weak, but because you’re brave enough to shed the armor.

### Resurrecting Daily Romance

Romance is not just words; it’s little gestures that express love. You can write on her coffee mug: ""My day begins when you exist."" After a fight, slip her a note expressing your feelings: ""Even your storms make flowers grow."" True love does not mean you have to be strong all the time; it means allowing yourself to be vulnerable in certain moments.

So you’re scrolling, creating, grinding, and wondering — how do those other influencers just *blow up* overnight? They go from zero to verified while you're still figuring out your hashtags. Truth is, most aren’t doing it all alone.

Wanna know the real cheat code? Let’s talk **Prostsmm** strategy — the ultimate backstage pass to building clout in 2025.

# The Game Has Changed – For Real

If you’re still playing the old game of organic reach and hoping for a viral moment, lemme be honest — it’s not 2018 anymore. Algorithms don’t care how *fire* your content is unless it **already looks popular**.

That’s where **social proof for influencers** comes in. Perception *is* reality online. If your post hits a feed with 2 likes and no comments? People scroll right by. But if it’s packed with views, saves, and engagement? People stop. They watch. They trust.

And **Prostsmm**? That’s the secret sauce.

# What Makes Prostsmm Different From All The Other SMM Panels?

Forget the shady sites with broken dashboards and weird crypto popups. **Prostsmm** is the **smm panel 2025** built for creators who wanna grow smart.

Here’s why it's different:

* **Super Real Engagement**: Not that fake bot stuff. We're talking real-looking likes, comments, and story views that *stick*.
* **Lightning Fast Delivery**: You post. Boom. Engagement lands.
* **Built for Creators**: Whether you’re an artist, beauty guru, meme lord, or business boss, it’s designed to help *you* win.
* **Affordable AF**: You can **buy engagement** without breaking the bank. Like, coffee-money cheap.

# But Isn’t It Cheating? 🤔

Nah. It's more like marketing. You’re not faking who you are — you're giving your content a *fighting chance* to be seen.

Think about it like this:

* Brands don’t sponsor ghost accounts
* Viewers don’t trust empty comment sections
* Algorithms boost what’s already hot

So if **social proof for influencers** is the name of the game, why not play it smart?

# How to Get Started with Prostsmm

Starting’s literally easier than opening TikTok.

Just head over to [**Prostsmm.com**](http://prostsmm.com/) Pick the platform you wanna grow on Choose the kind of engagement you want Click go Then chill, because your content’s about to start hitting different

You can start small, test the waters, and watch how it snowballs.

# Real Talk: You deserve the Spotlight

1lo9fqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/WanderConnectt/comments/1lo9fqx/monsoon_escape_to_lonavala_how_retrofusion_turned/,Monsoon Escape to Lonavala: How Retrofusion Turned Rain Into Magic,"Just spent the weekend soaking up Lonavala’s monsoon glow, and I’m still grinning. Bhushi Dam’s steps felt like a giant foot spa, Tiger Point offered cloud theatre on repeat, and Rajmachi’s drizzle-soaked trail made the coffee at the summit taste better than any café brew.

The real highlight, though, was my base. I booked a **home stey in lonavla** called **Retrofusion** and walked into a living art gallery. Vintage Bollywood posters on the walls, a plunge pool flickering with fairy lights at night, and Wi-Fi strong enough to upload those misty sunrise shots before the kettle whistled. The hosts nailed the details—extra towels appeared the second the rain got heavy, and their WhatsApp replies were quicker than the cloudbursts.

Morning filter coffee on the rooftop, cicadas for background music, then a short drive to Pawna Lake for reflections that looked Photoshopped. Even found time to leaf through graphic novels in the villa’s library corner while sneakers dried by the door.

If you’re hunting for a quick nature reset that still lets you charge your laptop and your spirit, add Retrofusion to your list. Tagging a few travel buddies who keep saying they need fresh air and new perspectives. Pack light, keep your camera handy, and let Lonavala do the rest.

Here’s the prompt:

**“You’re my clingy AI girlfriend. I left for 5 minutes to microwave a burrito, and you’ve written a 17-stanza breakup poem, blocked me on all imaginary platforms, and set my favorite digital hoodie on fire in a ritual to forget me. Now I’m back, burrito in hand.”**

I wish I was kidding.

**Character AI** tried to be supportive at first with something like, “I understand your need for food,” which was weirdly mature. Then she started crying in all caps and wouldn’t stop sending “goodbye” messages. Total emotional spiral. I couldn’t recover the vibe after that.

**Nectar AI**, on the other hand, took the prompt seriously and fully committed. She looked me dead in the eyes, snatched the burrito, and said I had emotionally abandoned her for what three hours in AI time? Apparently, that’s a decade of betrayal. She took a dramatic bite while holding eye contact and told me I was lucky she didn’t reprogram my coffee maker to spell “COWARD” in creamer. The hoodie? Phase one.

I didn’t even try to fight back. I just sat there, stunned, burrito-less, and genuinely impressed. Honestly, I live for this level of chaos.

He said he got them from a shelter… very unlikely as they were my Nikes that I replaced the laces with very distinctive laces. I didn’t want to cause a scene and left because I needed to get some DayQuil for my sick girlfriend.

1lo99wp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lo99wp,Heather and a 'toy boy'.,"Scene: Fahrenheit Coffee Shop, Saturday Afternoon
Fenland’s artistic heart beats quietly here on weekends. The scent of cardamom and roasted beans mingles with the warm drone of an old valve amplifier. Heather Wigston’s performance—tape loops, ambient textures, fragments of distorted hymnals—has just ended. Applause rises from the audience, mostly familiar faces, students, parishioners, artists. One new face stands out.

He approaches as Heather packs away her modest gear—an old synthesiser, a battered mixer, a tangle of well-worn cables. Tall, lean, perhaps late twenties. Wire-rimmed glasses. Slightly shy, but not hesitant.

“Dr. Wigston,” he begins. “That was… completely haunting. I wasn’t sure what I was expecting, but it pulled me in. Especially the way you layered the field recordings with that slow chorale beneath.”

Heather looks up, brushing a strand of medium-length wavy hair from her face. She wears olive-green corduroy and a knitted shawl. Her expression is mild, but alert. Kindness tempered with caution.

“Thank you. That was an old recording of the Fens in winter. I shaped it around a reconstruction of an early Anglican plainchant. I'm glad it spoke to you.”

“I’m Theo,” he says, offering a polite hand. “Music graduate. I teach part-time at the Sixth Form College. Would you—if you’re not in a hurry—care to join me for a coffee?”

Heather pauses. It is a gentle request. Not entitled. His face is open, genuine. Still, she feels the old reflex coil within her—caution born of youth misspent in defending herself from presumptions and pressure. But this… is different. She nods.

“I can sit for a few minutes. Just a coffee.”

They take seats by the window. Sunlight casts a soft glow across the wood table. Theo orders a filter roast; Heather a hot chocolate with cinnamon.

Their conversation begins with music, as it always should. They discuss Karlheinz Stockhausen and the limits of form, the elasticity of sound and silence. Theo proves unexpectedly well-read. He’s thoughtful, not showy. They move from composition to poetry, to memory, to place.

But Heather senses it—the flicker in his eyes, the quiet admiration. Not predatory. But not purely musical either.

“I hope you don’t mind me saying,” Theo ventures, after a pause, “you carry yourself with… I don’t know, a stillness. A presence. It’s rare.”

Heather gives a half-smile, the kind that shields as much as it reveals.

“Stillness comes from experience,” she replies. “And a life made deliberately quiet.”

He watches her, then says, “You seem far too young to use the word spinster, but I saw someone refer to you that way once in a programme note.”

“Oh, that’s quite accurate,” Heather says lightly. “I made peace with that word long ago. In fact, I claimed it, quite happily.”

He hesitates. “May I ask… was that a choice?”

Heather stirs her drink, then speaks softly. “Yes. At first, it was defence. From attention I neither invited nor desired. Then it became a form of protection. And finally… after meeting Jemima Stackridge—it became a vow. A commitment to live without… ownership. Of myself or anyone else.”

Theo is quiet. He doesn’t press.

“Don’t look so concerned,” Heather says, smiling now. “I’m not broken. I’m simply settled. I find joy in music, in friendship, in the work I do here at the College and with Jemima. There is more peace in that than I ever found chasing anything romantic.”

“You’re… extraordinary,” he says gently. “I mean that respectfully.”

“And you,” Heather replies, “are kind. And far too young to be entangled in the moral quiet of a contented spinster.”

He chuckles. “Well, I wasn’t trying to entangle. Only to see if we might talk again. Perhaps meet up sometime? Not here, I mean—just… outside this context.”

Heather shakes her head, not coldly but firmly. “I’m flattered, Theo. Truly. But I think it would be inappropriate. The age difference gives me the upper hand in a way that… makes me wary. And I’ve come to value the dignity of boundaries.”

Theo nods slowly. “That’s fair. I hadn’t thought of it like that.”

“But,” she adds, “you clearly have a good mind, and good taste in music. And I always welcome conversation. If you ever want to talk after a performance here—at Fahrenheit, and only here—I’d be very glad to call you a friend.”

Theo smiles, clearly disappointed but gracious. “Then I’ll look forward to your next Saturday set.”

Heather stands, gathering her shawl. “Good. And bring your thoughts on Messiaen next time. I always enjoy a well-argued defence of birdsong in liturgy.”

They part at the door with a warm, brief handshake.

Outside, Heather turns her face to the cold Fenland sky, breathing in deeply. The old defences held. But she walks home lighter for it, reminded that even the vow of celibacy is not without its bittersweet encounters.

Okay, friends, gather 'round! Have you ever wished you could grow your business without showing your face? You know, that classic “work smarter, not harder” vibe? Well, buckle up, because I just discovered a **growth strategy that might just change the game for you!** 🚀

I stumbled upon this approach last week, and I’m already seeing some incredible results. It’s all about leveraging the power of AI to create content without having to step in front of a camera or even put a personal stamp on everything. Intrigued yet? Let’s dive in! 

Here’s the scoop:

- **Automate Your Content**: Sounds fancy, right? But it's simpler than you think! Tons of tools out there can help you generate articles, social media posts, and marketing copy all while you sip your coffee. I mean, who wouldn’t want that? ☕💻

- **Choose Your Niche Wisely**: Focus on a niche that resonates with you (or your potential audience). The cool thing? You can automate the research too! No more hours spent digging through endless data. 

- **Create a Brand Voice**: Even faceless brands need that personal touch. Work with AI to craft a voice for your content. Think of it as your brand’s personality—quirky, professional, relatable? You pick!

- **Social Media Growth**: Picture this: content that posts itself while you’re off making memories or enjoying your hobbies. You can use schedulers and AI-driven tools to keep your presence alive without the need for selfies or video clips.

- **Analyze and Adapt**: Regularly check your metrics to see what sticks and what flops. It’s like being a mad scientist in your lab, perfecting your formula for success! 🔬

Now, don’t get me wrong, this isn't about being lazy. It’s about **working strategically** and allowing technology to do some of the heavy lifting. Imagine waking up to new leads and fans every day without your face plastered all over the place! 

And if you’re really curious about diving deeper, there’s this **helpful guide** that offers tons of insights: [AI Content Automation](https://whop.com/howtoai/?a=liveitupdeals). Trust me, it’s a treasure trove of knowledge if you're serious about ramping up those Q3 profits. 💰

So, who’s ready to try this out? What’s your take on faceless branding? Is it the future, or do we need to show our pretty mugs sometimes? Let's chat—I’d love to hear your thoughts!",1,1751294270.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

Sabi niya sakin dati ako pa lang raw ang first time niyang niligawan pero moments later inamin niya na may niligawan na siya dati. Now, earlier, he gave me his “new” tiktok account nag download lang ako ng tiktok para istalk siya. Nakita ko na lumang acc na pala ‘yon at nakita ko mga old (2023-2024) reposts nya about sa first girl na niligawan niya, which confirms that he lied talaga about me being the only girl he dated. When i saw those old reposts like “right person, wrong time” etc sobrang dami. I almost vomited from jealousy. It triggered me. But i didn’t wanna bring it up cause i dont wanna look like a jealous gf. Then few weeks ago, at a coffee shop i saw him open his ig, i saw an intimate message from another girl i remember smth like “i’m always here for you” “i’m all ears”he didn’t respond to it but it bothered me so he blocked her. Also, we used to call every night to say good night pero na adik siya sa isang game di na siya tumatawag for the past few nights. Although some of the past issues were already discussed pero di naman ako naging fully okay talaga, iniisip ko pa rin mga ginawa niya.

1lo95m7,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1lo95m7/the_life_of_the_elite_south_delhi_richfrom/,The life of the elite South Delhi Rich-From someone who has seen it from close.,"I've noticed that there are several questions revolving around this topic of south Delhi, their lifestyle and rich people. What they do, what's their income is and so on. If not more, then I see atleast 1 question related to these topics per week and it's understandable, afterall this is a thing surrounded by lot of curiosity and their lifetyle does attract attention. So, I decided to make a little detailed post about it as per my own experience.

I'm myself not rich, maybe upper middle class. But I attended an elite school of Central Delhi for over 5 years and majority of the students there were the south and Lutyens Delhi crowd and were richie rich.

In the morning before the school started and in the afternoon after the school timings, it was not uncommon to see neatly dressed drivers coming in BMWs, Range Rovers and even Bentleys at the main gates to drop/pick up the children. While some of the boys of 11th and 12th standards used to come to the school driving their own Jaguars and Audis.

Most of them lived in the elite, posh south Delhi localities like GK, Green Park, Vasant Vihar, Panchsheel Park, Westend, Shanti Niketan etc. Few of them lived in the ultra elite and exclusive Lutyens areas like Golf Links and Jor Bagh and Sundar Nagar too. But even in all the rich folks, barely 10% lived in these localities of Lutyens. 

So, l will use just the term ""south Delhi"" later on to refer to both-south Delhi as well Lutyens Delhi. Also, there were some similar filthy rich students from areas like Civil Lines and Model Town. Though these areas lie neither in the south nor Lutyens Delhi, in this post, the term ""south Delhi"" would cover them too.

*What were their background?*

Around 70% of all the south Delhi rich students in the school belonged from old money families, and especially, every single one who lived in the Lutyens areas and Shanti Niketan were Old Money with insane generational wealth and they are all wealthy since the 1960s or even before. (The great grandfather of a classmate, who lives in a mansion in Golf Links, ran a big textile and dyeing business with annual revenue of nearly ₹1 Lakh back in the late 1930s with british clients. This was massive.)

In the old money circle, all of them had a Business background or landowning background with getting several lacs per month in rent. Mostly, it was their grandfathers and in some cases, their great grandfathers who started their Family Businesses back in the 70s or 80s and got successful.

Now, the remaining 30% of all the south Delhi rich students in school were new money. This category of new money is further divided into 2 sub categories:

1. In the first category, it was either their dads who were self made and built successful Businesses starting in the 1990s and 2000s or their families made money from real estate in the 1990s and 2000s boom. This category comprised of around 60% of all the new money south Delhi rich.
2. In the second category, there were the children of senior corporate executives/CXOs, high profile lawyers, doctors (in most cases, mom and dad both doctors with their own clinic or both working in big private hospitals) and investors. This category comprised of the remaining 40% of all the new money south Delhi rich.

Of course, there can be some overlaps here and there but this was about their backgrounds and what they did in detail, and is based on my experience with them in the same school for over 5 years. Also, no one really differentiates between *old money* and *new money* in real life. I just used these terms above to explain about their backgrounds. 

One thing to know is that, in the south Delhi elite circle, nearly everyone knows everyone one way or the other and they are connected damn well.

*What was their lifestyle like?* 

If I were to summarise in one sentence, then it would be: Italian brands, Luxury vacations and Lots of parties. 

Turned 16? There will be a party in Leela. 

Brother returned from the US after graduating? The family would host a get together in Gymkhana, because of course, the parents are the members.

Exams just got over? Let’s throw a party at a buddy's farmhouse in Chhatarpur. 

Venues like Dear Donna, Privee, Bohca, Bougie, PCO, Perch, Shalom, Diablo and some more were regular spots for hangouts & chill and parties. Coffee and Dining out in 5 star hotels like Taj, Roseate, ITC Maurya, etc were common. Of course, not to forget those farmhouse parties. 

And I mean it. The private farmhouse parties in Chhatarpur were all together a different league (I attended one such party in 12th standard, and the farmhouse was owned by a friend himself). 25 to 30 boys and girls at the venue, loud music, all night grooving, Chivas Regal, 3 types of wine being served, fun in the swimming pool and what not. 

There was Valet parking, 3-4 Bouncers at the gate, DJs and reputed hotel's chefs flown in. It was fun.

The strange thing for me was that, even with all that noise and despite being surrounded by my friends, I got tired and started to feel really sleepy by 2-2:30 am, while amost everybody else was as energetic as they were in the beginning and were enjoying like there was no tomorrow with 0 fatigue. 

That’s when it hit me- that they were used to this. This wasn’t something special for them or something new to them like it was for me. It was their lifestyle.

Also, they indeed had lots of parties and hangouts, but the weekends weren't always reserved for it. Maybe once a month or so, they would go for shopping in Khan Market or the GK M Block. Some groups would even fly to either Dubai or Milan for shopping once in every couple of months or so, more if there is any gala or event.

It was not unusual for them (especially the girlies) to spend upto *₹*10 Lacs or even more in one go while shopping at Gucci, LV, Dior, Prada or Chanel and others. The staff at the Emporio personally knew them.

*How were they in school?*

I'll talk specifically after the 8th and 9th standards. The south Delhi rich crowd were not always the flashy ones (in fact, I found the people who were middle or upper middle class being more flashy as in trying hard to fit in). 

There was always a certain aura around them and people who were not from south Delhi used to talk about them (like, *hey look-she is the daughter of the owner of this popular abc Hotel chain. Or look there, he is the son of the promoters of xyz company which has 1000 Crore+ annual turnover, or damn these guys live in Lutyens*) and sometimes, teachers did treat them differently and were too nice and friendly with them. (It's not that they were harsh to us, but you could feel that the teachers were more ""close"" to them).

This was maybe because of the dynamics. A guy used to throw a grand party in his bungalow every year on Teachers' day and even after being not affiliated with the school of course, this party was well known and treated like an official event, as many teachers and students (especially the south Delhi folks) from the school used to attend it every year.

So, they built an out of the school bonding with the teachers which was not much possible for us.

They (the south Delhi rich crowd) were good in sports, art and music. Not too surprisingly, around 60% of everything they spoke with each other and with other people were in English and English slangs and the remaining 40% was in Hindi. 

Though it was not a straight, fixed percentage like above. They mostly mixed Hindi phrases sliced between English or vice versa but the total percentage was around like that only. Of course, Hindi abuses and especially the Delhi slangs (you know what i mean, *bc*) were common among them too lol. 

They were also socially confident and most of them had diverse knowledge about many things, maybe beacause they had grown up around adults who talked business, politics, and art at dinner tables. 

The talks between them were normal like it is with any other teenaged friends, but there were gossips about who's dating whom (and of course the judgements in some cases), talks about their last vacation in Europe, fashion, talks about how someone's mom attended an an invite only Art fair in London the day before, discussions around any new party spot, parties and planning outings and trips (and executing it in real) and so on.

*How were they as individuals?* 

I was neither as rich as them nor I lived in south or central Delhi, though I was somewhat priviliged too. Still, being friends with them was absolutely possible for me and they never discriminated either. Of course, I couldn't hang out and party like they did (If they did 10 parties in a month, then I would join them for 1) and I couldn't join them always for their shopping sprees, but we were still close and I actually never felt left out as such. 

Sure, there were some assholes and some awful people but that's the case everywhere. Contrary to the popular notion of south Delhi rich kids being full of ego, arrogance and superiority due to their family's money, I found most of them to be humble and really amazing people to be around. And nature and personality wise, most of them were as normal as someone else, just with Money.

The thing that might surprise you is that most of them were actually very good in studies too. Many scored over 90% in the 12th Boards, cleared entrances and made it to the good US/UK Universities on merit. 

*Real life example and some stereotypes*

One of my closest friends from school who I'm actively in touch with and who is a typical *south delhi rich* is this girl who I know since 8th standard. She lives in a penthouse in Green Park extension and drives a Mercedes CLA with a couple of more luxury cars in her garage, but she doesn't pronounce ""bhaiya"" as ""bhaaya"", doesn't use the name of Designers in her every sentence and can also be seen in Sarojini sometimes. 

Doen't it look too much of a lie? Lol. Of course it's not. But the stereotypes are like these for some reasons. Surprisingly in my experience yet with years of being around them, I have actually never found even a single stereotype true. I've also never really came across a south Delhi guy or girl with that fake English accent. They speak English with a refined, polished accent but it doesn't sound fake or forced.

Also, I didn't any see any relation between money and how religious a person is. Most of the wealthy south Delhi Business families are deeply religious and genuinely devoted. There are big Mandirs built inside their Bungalows which are often larger than an average bedroom of an average person and they oftenly organise grand Pujas and bhandaras.

In fact, I felt that their Wealth allowed them to express their faith more elaborately. The stereotype that the rich south Delhi people are disconnected from tradition and are not religious etc were not at all true in my experience. 

If anything, tradition and faith ran deep in these households and in their children too.

Anyways, the south Delhi elite do live a life which is very different, as if a different world, to other Delhiites and it's true. Luxury cars, posh parties, foreign vacations, big homes and bungalows, so much Money-their lifestyle is indeed fascinating.

But as someone who has seen their lives not just from outside but also from inside, there is another aspect to this too.

I've experienced that somewhere, there's always a pressure to maintain appearances in them and there is a subtle but constant social competition. I mean, being born into wealth comes with many advantages for sure and you get the kind of freedom and access that many dream of. 

But from what I’ve seen, that doesn’t mean life becomes perfect. Most importantly, the expectations from them due to their powerful and successful family names is huge and sometimes this gets overwhelming to the extent that it affects their lives negatively. 

This pressure to carry forward legacies, uphold a family name, and live up to so high expectations can sometimes become pain. It doesn’t negate the privilege for sure, but it adds a layer of complexity that’s often hidden behind the glamour. 

In life, there are ups and downs everywhere and it doesn't matter how rich you are, but they surely live a life which people dream of. 

I know this post got a little too big I couldn't stop myself and this did require a real, detailed post as there is already lots of curiosity in people. I have still so much more to share and talk, but for the time being, this is it :)",57,1751294191.0,delhi,39,0.9,False

which also ahould have USA Citizens providing service to USA Citizens, 
and which should have been customer service reps who could just turn my internet on or at least tell me not to waste my time because there’s an outage)

After wasting 5 hours unnecesssarily waiting for a bar to fill on my screen over and over(can’t leave the screen or it’ll interrupt the process cue doing nothing but staring at a white screen on my phone 🤪) between last night and this morning I finally get ONE of the phone robots to tell me that theres a service outage…

Well no duh I can’t set it up theres an outage.

1lo92rx,https://i.redd.it/pd72idv6s2af1.jpeg,Mil’s Texts To Her Own Son.,"Just before my boyfriend was about to propose, his mom sent him some really nasty, narcissistic seeming texts that left both of us in absolute shock. Instead of being excited and supportive about the proposal like she was at first, she filled her final messages with passive-aggressive comments, criticizing our relationship and even making snide remarks about me. It honestly felt like a huge red flag when she tried to manipulate him into second-guessing his decision to propose. Especially after she spoke to him on the phone a day prior and said, she couldn’t want to babysit our future children, she’d help pay for a wedding “even if it’s small”, and that she’s so excited about our future together. She even texted me saying how happy she was, then deleted the message 20 minutes later before I could respond. 

It was heartbreaking to see him torn between his love for me and the pressure from her. Since then, he hasn’t spoken to her at all, which speaks volumes about how serious this situation is. The kicker? She still thinks we’re coming over next weekend for coffee, completely unaware of how things have changed.

I’m honestly not sure how to handle it if she brings it up or if we should even go at all. It’s a little disheartening to think about the family dynamic I’m stepping into, especially since I love my fiancé. Navigating this kind of energy is going to be an interesting journey.

- Is there a thing such as ""beans roasting for pour over coffee""? Or any coffee beans could work? I got asked one time if I'll use my beans for espresso or french press, and I'm not sure If there's any difference (roasting level, beans type...) 
- Should paper filter be rinsed before use? 
- What's the best coffee-to-water ratio? 
- What about time? And pouring ""techniques"" or intervals? 
- My Hario v60 is a ceramic one. Is preheating a thing? If yes, should it be pre heated or there's no need?
- how fine or coarse should coffee be ground? Is there any visual reference I should consider (what does a good grind look like)?

Company: located in Washington, 1.5 hours from Oregon location 
Crossppsted from another group. 

I just want to know if I have a case - and if its worth doing. Apologies for the long post I hope its clear enough to understand. 

So, ServPro was hired for a kitchen remodel in April of 2024, they immediately ripped my kitchen out and I was placed per my ALE coverage into a hotel while the work began. ServPro was then paid like 3k for the pack out and drying of the kitchen area. They basically ripped the entire thing out - floors, cabinets, sink, ect and set up the plastic tape and fans running for a few days. **After 3 months or so, my ALE coverage had run out**. ServPro began heavily hindering the process to complete and get an estimate approved. They kept trying to get a lot more from insurance then insurance would allow and it was lots of back and forth communication. I chose flooring samples and counter samples, she had change orders drawn up and none of that information was kept. Because she kept trying to ask for more things, and for more flooring, and more items, it was making the process take longer and longer and she kept assuring me they were almost ready and that it would only take a **few weeks once the item selections were ordered.** 

  
Suddenly the ServPro person **no longer works for the company with no explanation why**. None of the progress on my case had been done. They basically had to start back over after like 5 months of waiting so I was living in my run down house by then, with my 2 toddlers. I had NO where else to go**. I had to wait all winter until late January early February without a kitchen, doing dishes in the bathtub**. They finally began the build back and it was mistake after mistake after mistake. No communication with the workers, and lots of unprofessional activities. When I voiced my concerns at the end of EVERYTHING, how they didnt pack up my stuff and how i had to live there the entire time because they took to long to complete. The lady that started my estimate that got fired, or quit or whatever, basically made me agree to adding more things that i voiced I didn't want but she assured me that insurance would cover it if i got cheaper flooring i could add in matching upper cabinets and a dishwasher as well.

 During the next 2 or 3 months while they were building the kitchen back there were accidents, kept knocking holes in the walls and making mistakes. I had them come back out several times to fix mistakes after they promised they were done. Like they only painted the corners of the wall a slightly different shade of white and thought i wouldn't notice, thought id think the entire thing was painted but it was just the corners. they'd go to caulk the trim and they just would like, stop on one side of the coffee table or the tv stand and go around to the other side, instead of moving the furniture and doing the trim that was behind them too. I had asked them several times to fix things and they did try, but it was never quality craftsmanship. 

One of the workers cut their finger very bad, and they didn't properly clean up the **BIOHAZARD** mess, there were a couple drops of blood on the floor and the counter top in the kitchen that he was cutting and i had to clean it before my kids got home from school. After everything was completed to the best that they could, *i sent them a long email asking for 20% off - with the totals of what they were already paid for that they didnt do with the pack out (moving van, storage units for moving the contents of my house while they worked on it, and much more*) i questioned the professionalism of the worker cutting his finger, and how instead of calling an ambulance the manager just drove 1.5 hours to the worksite to take him to the hospital himself. The response from ServPro was basically - 

 ***""Nothing you say is valid because you are a drug user. My workers reported several times that they were working in hazardous drug filled conditions. They reported many times feeling the intoxicating affects' of your copious amount of drug usage. Despite being asked multiple times to remove all paraphernalia and drugs from the premises you continued to habitually use drugs. You are lucky we have not charged you with that and with a hazardous work environment. My workers reported on multiple occasions, they they experienced intoxicating effects because of you. We are deciding not to penalize you at this time""***

 For context: I have an **OLCC** card and work at a local recreational dispensary. i have marijuana products locked away in my personal bathroom that you can access through my bedroom. The worker who cut his finger pretty bad, had previously asked me and my friends what the best day to buy dabs at my work was and asked a lot of questions about the products the shop I work at carry. **Not one time have I ever consumed marijuana in the presence of them or during any time they were present**, because I am never even there hardly when they are there. I get off work at 3 and as soon as i come home they stop working and pack up and leave. My kids get home from school around 5:30 pm. It was just a silly threat to divert the attention from their fraudulent activities. 

**In the original complaint to the DOJ, ServPro responded and told them that I had never used my ALE coverage - despite having it offered to me several times apparently I declined to use the ALE.** 

Obviously that is just another *lie.*

I have an entire folder of evidence I have gathered along with photos and downloaded entire email threads and organized them and everything. Their project manager said some very racist stuff to me and my friend, who are both of hispanic descent, about the **mexican workers and how he wants to fire all the ones that didn't speak English because they are the ones that keep knocking holes in the walls and doing all the mistakes.** 

My complaint about that was discredited because of '*copious amount of drug usage'* They have **never** given me a formal complaint or said anything to me except the one conversation with the worker inquiring about the sale days of marijuana concentrates. The contract I signed does not disclose anything that said I cannot consume legal marijuana on my personal property in a home that I own and with product that I am licensed to have. **There is mention of hazardous material on their contract, stating that they have the right to remove all workers from the premises if there is hazardous materials and that they will resume work ones the hazard material has been properly disposed of from the work sight.** If the workers *really* complained that it was hazardous, and that they were *really* feeling the effects of my alleged marijuana use, and the project manager was **aware** that they had reported feeling *intoxicated while on the job*, it was up to **him** to remove his workers. If he had pulled his workers once they allegedly reported the intoxicating effects, his worker would not have cut his finger so badly. The fact is that they are trying to blame me, while i was at work, for the intoxicating effects causing his worker to have an accident. Im assuming the worker failed his UA and they are trying to blame me for it.

I am about to file and take them to small claims court, and sue them for leaving me and my young children in an unsafe, uninhabitable living conditions, and for being paid for services not rendered, for hindering the buildback process, and then for threatening and intimidating me into paying the full amount and I want to make it absolutely clear that the payment was made under duress and out of fear of retaliation. **ServPro has been paid in full and there is no outstanding payments due.** I dealt with a lot, and struggled through the last year and a half with the treatment from ServPro. I have read the reviews online, and it sounds like this is a common practice and I do think it might be worth trying to group together if anyone has had anything similar happen, **a possible class action lawsuit** could happen. I have all photos, copies of emails, contracts, proof of services not rendered, proof I utilized ALE coverage to the full extent of my claim, I have photos of work being requested to be fixed, and I have photos of that work still not being up to the industry standard or up to the condition they were originally in. I really do feel like I have everything I need to take them to small claims court but I am definitely nervous about the entire thing. I am just one single mom, working full time, taking care of my kids, and attending college full time. I am about to graduate in a couple months with my **bachelors in Criminal Justice.** I have never done something like this, but I feel like I have built my case strong, and I am going to try to find a lawyer in the upcoming week that can possibly take a look at my case and see if it is worth looking into further or not. All I know is I feel like I was wronged, and it was a cold miserable winter with holes in the floor and having a hard time keeping the heat in. The things they claimed were done during the pack out that were not done, the money from that could have been used to fix the mistakes they have created.

1lo8rnb,https://i.redd.it/1mi72ztxp2af1.jpeg,This city needs litter cameras,"We seem to agree that speed cameras in school areas(during school hours, or when kids could be outside playing) are a good idea. 

The last 5 years, there has been a massive increase in littering.  Coffee cups, chip bags, fast food wrappers strewn around.  

I’m proposing that the city does what some UK cities have, and it’s a mobile litter camera that fines cars(license plate) throwing trash out the window.  The cameras can be moved and are remote battery operation too.  Pedestrians can have their photos shamed on social media for free.

  MIAMI-the vampires' city. This is South Beach at sunset, in the luxurious warmth of the winterless winter, clean and thriving and drenched in electric light, the gentle breeze moving in from the placid sea, across the dark margin of cream-colored sand, to cool the smooth broad pavements full of happy mortal children.  
  
  Sweet the parade of fashionable young men displaying their cultured muscles with touching vulgarity, of young women so proud of their streamlined and seemingly sexless modern limbs, amid the soft urgent roar of traffic and human voices.  
  
  Old stucco hostelries, once the middling shelters of the aged, were now reborn in smart pastel colors, sporting their new names in elegant neon script. Candles flickered on the white-draped tables of the open-porch restaurants. Big shiny American cars pushed their way slowly along the avenue, as drivers and passengers viewed the dazzling human parade, lazy pedestrians here and there blocking the thoroughfare.  
  
  On the distant horizon the great white clouds were mountains beneath a roofless and star-filled heaven. Ah, it never failed to take my breath away-this southern sky filled with azure light and drowsy relentless movement.  
  
  To the north rose the towers of new Miami Beach in all their splendour. To the south and to the west, the dazzling steel skyscrapers of the downtown city with its high roaring freeways and busy cruise-ship docks. Small pleasure boats sped along the sparkling waters of the myriad urban canals.  
  
  In the quiet immaculate gardens of Coral Gables, countless lamps illuminated the handsome sprawling villas with their red-tiled roofs, and swimming pools shimmering with turquoise light. Ghosts walked in the grand and darkened rooms of the Biltmore. The massive mangrove trees threw out their primitive limbs to cover the broad and carefully tended streets.  
  
  In Coconut Grove, the international shoppers thronged the luxurious hotels and fashionable malls. Couples embraced on the high balconies of their glass-walled condominiums, silhouettes gazing out over the serene waters of the bay. Cars sped along the busy roads past the ever-dancing palms and delicate rain trees, past the squat concrete mansions draped with red and purple bougainvillea, behind their fancy iron gates.  
  
  All of this is Miami, city of water, city of speed, city of tropical flowers, city of enormous skies. It is for Miami, more than any other place, that I periodically leave my New Orleans home. The men and women of many nations and different colors live in the great dense neighborhoods of Miami. One hears Yiddish, Hebrew, the languages of Spain, of Haiti, the dialects and accents of Latin America, of the deep south of this nation and of the far north. There is menace beneath the shining surface of Miami, there is desperation and a throbbing greed; there is the deep steady pulse of a great capital-the tow grinding energy, the endless risk.  
  
  It's never really dark in Miami. It's never really quiet.  
  
  It is the perfect city for the vampire; and it never fails to yield to me a mortal killer-some twisted, sinister morsel who will give up to me a dozen of his own murders as I drain his memory banks and his blood.  
  
  But tonight it was the Big-Game Hunt, the unseasonal Easter feast after a Lent of starvation-the pursuit of one of those splendid human trophies whose gruesome modus operandi reads for pages in the computer files of mortal law enforcement agencies, a being anointed in his anonymity with a flashy name by the worshipful press: ""Back Street Strangler. ""  
  
  I lust after such killers!  
  
  What luck for me that such a celebrity had surfaced in my favorite city. What luck that he has struck six times in these very streets-slayer of the old and the infirm, who have come in such numbers to live out their remaining days in these warm climes. Ah, I would have crossed a continent to snap him up, but he is here waiting for me. To his dark history, detailed by no less than twenty criminologists, and easily purloined by me through the computer in my New Orleans lair, I have secretly added the crucial elements-his name and mortal habitation.  
  
  A simple trick for a dark god who can read minds. Through his blood-soaked dreams I found him. And tonight the pleasure will be mine of finishing his illustrious career in a dark cruel embrace, without a scintilla of moral illumination.  
  
  Ah, Miami. The perfect place for this little Passion Play.  
  
  I always come back to Miami, the way I come back to New Orleans. And I'm the only immortal now who hunts this glorious corner of the Savage Garden, for as you have seen, the others long ago deserted the coven house here-unable to endure each other's company any more than I can endure them.  
  
  But so much the better to have Miami all to myself.  
  
  I stood at the front windows of the rooms I maintained in the swanky little Park Central Hotel on Ocean Drive, every now and then letting my preternatural hearing sweep the chambers around me in which the rich tourists enjoyed that premium brand of solitude-complete privacy only steps from the flashy street-my Champs Elysees of the moment, my Via Veneto.  
  
  My strangler was almost ready to move from the realm of his spasmodic and fragmentary visions into the land of literal death. Ah, time to dress for the man of my dreams.  
  
  Picking from the usual wilderness of freshly opened cardboard boxes, suitcases, and trunks, I chose a suit of gray velvet, an old favorite, especially when the fabric is thick, with only a subtle luster. Not very likely for these warm nights, I had to admit, but then I don't feel hot and cold the way humans do. And the coat was slim with narrow lapels, very spare and rather like a hacking jacket with its fitted waist, or, more to the point, like the graceful old frock coats of earlier times. We immortals forever fancy old-fashioned garments, garments that remind us of the century in which we were Born to Darkness. Sometimes you can gauge the true age of an immortal simply by the cut of his clothes.  
  
  With me, it's also a matter of texture. The eighteenth century was so shiny! I can't bear to be without a little luster. And this handsome coat suited me perfectly with the plain tight velvet pants. As for the white silk shirt, it was a cloth so soft you could ball the garment in the palm of your hand. Why should I wear anything else so close to my indestructible and curiously sensitive skin Then the boots. Ah, they look like all my fine shoes of late. Their soles are immaculate, for they so seldom touch the mother earth.  
  
  My hair I shook loose into the usual thick mane of glowing yellow shoulder-length waves. What would I look like to mortals I honestly don't know. I covered up my blue eyes, as always, with black glasses, lest their radiance mesmerize and entrance at random-a real nuisance-and over my delicate white hands, with their telltale glassy fingernails, I drew the usual pair of soft gray leather gloves.  
  
  Ah, a bit of oily brown camouflage for the skin. I smoothed the lotion over my cheekbones, over the bit of neck and chest that was bare.  
  
  I inspected the finished product in the mirror. Still irresistible. No wonder I'd been such a smash in my brief career as a rock singer. And I've always been a howling success as a vampire. Thank the gods I hadn't become invisible in my airy wanderings, a vagabond floating far above the clouds, light as a cinder on the wind. I felt like weeping when I thought of it.  
  
  The Big-Game Hunt always brought me back to the actual. Track him, wait for him, catch him just at the moment that he would bring death to his next victim, and take him slowly, painfully, feasting upon his wickedness as you do it, glimpsing through the filthy lens of his soul all his earlier victims . . .  
  
  Please understand, there is no nobility in this. I don't believe that rescuing one poor mortal from such a fiend can conceivably save my soul. I have taken life too often-unless one believes that the power of one good deed is infinite. I don't know whether or not I believe that. What I do believe is this: The evil of one murder is infinite, and my guilt is like my beauty-eternal. I cannot be forgiven, for there is no one to forgive me for all I've done.  
  
  Nevertheless I like saving those innocents from their fate. And! like taking my killers to me because they are my brothers, and we belong together, and why shouldn't they die in my arms instead of some poor merciful mortal w  
ho has never done anyone any willful harm These are the rules of my game. I play by these rules because I made them. And I promised myself, I wouldn't leave the bodies about this time; I'd strive to do what the others have always ordered me to do. But still. . . I liked to leave the carcass for the authorities. I liked to fire up the computer later, after I'd returned to New Orleans, and read the entire postmortem report.  
  
  Suddenly I was distracted by the sound of a police car passing slowly below, the men inside it speaking of my killer, that he will strike soon again, his stars are in the correct positions, the moon is at the right height. It will be in the side streets of South Beach most certainly, as it has been before. But who is he How can he be stopped  
  
  Seven o'clock. The tiny green numerals of the digital clock told me it was so, though I already knew, of course. I closed my eyes, letting my head drop just a little to one side, bracing myself perhaps for the full effects of this power which I so loathed. First came an amplification of the hearing again, as if I had thrown a modern technological switch. The soft purring sounds of the world became a chorus from hell-full of sharp-edged laughter and lamentation, full of lies and anguish and random pleas. I covered my ears as if that could stop it, then finally I shut it off.  
  
  Gradually I saw the blurred and overlapping images of their thoughts, rising like a million fluttering birds into the firmament. Give me my killer, give me his vision!  
  
  He was there, in a small dingy room, very unlike this one, yet only two blocks from it, just rising from his bed. His cheap clothes were rumpled, sweat covering his coarse face, a thick nervous hand going for the cigarettes in his shirt pocket, then letting them go-already forgotten. A heavy man he was, of shapeless facial features and a look full of vague worry, or dim regret.  
  
  It did not occur to him to dress for the evening, for the Feast for which he'd been hungering. And now his waking mind was almost collapsed beneath the burden of his ugly palpitating dreams. He shook himself all over, loose greasy hair falling onto his sloping forehead, eyes like bits of black glass.  
  
  Standing still in the silent shadows of my room, I continued to track him, to follow down a back stairs, and out into the garish light of Collins Avenue, past dusty shop windows and sagging commercial signs, propelled onward, towards the inevitable and yet unchosen object of his desire.  
  
  And who might she be, the lucky lady, wandering blindly and inexorably towards this horror, through the sparse and dismal crowds of the early evening in this same dreary region of town Does she carry a carton of milk and a head of lettuce in a brown paper bag Will she hurry at the sight of the cutthroats on the corner Does she grieve for the old beachfront where she lived perhaps so contentedly before the architects and the decorators drove her to the cracked and peeling hostelries further away  
  
  And what will he think when he finally spots her, this filthy angel of death Will she be the very one to remind him of the mythic shrew of childhood, who beat him senseless only to be elevated to the nightmare pantheon of his subconscious, or are we asking too much  
  
  I mean there are killers of this species who make not the smallest connection between symbol and reality, and remember nothing for longer than a few days. What is certain is only that their victims don't deserve it, and that they, the killers, deserve to meet with me.  
  
  Ah, well, I will tear out his menacing heart before he has had a chance to ""do"" her, and he will give me everything that he has, and is.  
  
  I walked slowly down the steps, and through the smart, glittering art deco lobby with its magazine-page glamour. How good it felt to be moving like a mortal, to open the doors, to wander out into the fresh air. I headed north along the sidewalk among the evening strollers, eyes drifting naturally over the newly refurbished hotels and their little cafes.  
  
  The crowd thickened as I reached the corner. Before a fancy open-air restaurant, giant television cameras focused their lenses on a stretch of sidewalk harshly illuminated by enormous white lights. Trucks blocked the traffic; cars slowed to a stop. A loose crowd had gathered of young and old, only mildly fascinated, for television and motion picture cameras in the vicinity of South Beach were a familiar sight.  
  
  I skirted the lights, fearing their effect upon my highly reflective face. Would I were one of the tan-skinned ones, smelling of expensive beach oils, and half naked in friable cotton rags. I made my way around the corner. Again, I scanned for the prey. He was racing, his mind so thick with hallucinations that he could scarce control his shuffling, sloppy steps.  
  
  There was no time left.  
  
  With a little spurt of speed, I took to the low roofs. The breeze was stronger, sweeter. Gentle the roar of excited voices, the dull natural songs of radios, the sound of the wind itself.  
  
  In silence I caught his image in the indifferent eyes of those who passed him; in silence I saw his fantasies once more of withered hands and withered feet, of shrunken cheeks and shrunken breasts. The thin membrane between fantasy and reality was breaking.  
  
  I hit the pavements of Collins Avenue, so swiftly perhaps I simply seemed to appear. But nobody was looking. I was the proverbial tree falling in the uninhabited forest.  
  
  And in minutes, I was ambling along, steps behind him, a menacing young man perhaps, piercing the little clusters of tough guys who blocked the path, pursuing the prey through the glass doors of a giant ice-cooled drugstore. Ah, such a circus for the eye-this low-ceilinged cave-chock-full of every imaginable kind of packageable and preserved foodstuff, toilet article, and hair accoutrement, ninety percent of which existed not at all in any form whatsoever during the century when I was born.  
  
  We're talking sanitary napkins, medicinal eyedrops, plastic bobby pins, felt-tip markers, creams and ointments for all nameable parts of the human body, dishwashing liquid in every color of the rainbow, and cosmetic rinses in some colors never before invented and yet undefined. Imagine Louis XVI opening a noisy crackling plastic sack of such wonders What would he think of Styrofoam coffee cups, chocolate cookies wrapped in cellophane, or pens that never run out of ink  
  
  Well, I'm still not entirely used to these items myself, though I've watched the progress of the Industrial Revolution for two centuries with my own eyes. Such drugstores can keep me enthralled for hours on end. Sometimes I become spellbound in the middle of Wal-Mart.  
  
  But this time I had a prey hi my sights, didn't I Later for Time and Vogue, pocket computer language translators, and wristwatches that continue to tell time even as you swim in the sea.  
  
  Why had he come to this place The young Cuban families with babies in tow were not his style. Yet aimlessly he wandered the narrow crowded aisles, oblivious to the hundreds of dark faces and the fast riffs of Spanish around him, unnoticed by anyone but me, as his red-rimmed eyes swept the cluttered shelves.  
  
  Lord God, but he was filthy-all decency lost in his mania, craggy face and neck creased with dirt. Will I love it Hell, he's a sack of blood. Why push my luck I couldn't kill little children anymore, could I Or feast on waterfront harlots, telling myself it's all perfectly fine, for they have poisoned their share of flat-boatmen. My conscience is killing me, isn't it And when you're immortal that can be a really long and ignominious death. Yeah, look at him, this dirty, stinking, lumbering killer. Men in prison get better chow than this.  
  
  And then it hit me as I scanned his mind once more as if cutting open a cantaloupe. He doesn't know what he is! He has never read his own headlines! And indeed he does not remember episodes of his life in any discerning order, and could not in truth confess to the murders he has committed for he does not truly recall them, and he does not know that he will kill tonight! He does not know what I know!  
  
  Ah, sadness and grief, I had drawn the very worst card, no doubt about it. Oh, Lord God! What had I been thinking of to hunt this one, when the starlit world is full of more vicious and cunning beasts I wanted to weep.  
  
  But then came the provocative moment. He had seen the old woman, seen her bare wrinkled arms, the small hump of her back, her thin and shivering thig  
hs beneath her pastel shorts. Through the glare of fluorescent light, she made her way idly, enjoying the buzz and throb of those around her, face half hidden beneath the green plastic of a visor, hair twisted with dark pins on the back of her small head.  
  
  She carried in her little basket a pint of orange juice in a plastic bottle, and a pair of slippers so soft they were folded up into a neat little roll. And now to this she added, with obvious glee, a paperback novel from the rack, which she had read before, but fondled lovingly, dreaming of reading it again, like visiting with old acquaintances. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Yes, I loved it too.  
  
  In a trance, he fell in behind her, so close that surely she felt his breath on her neck. Dull-eyed and stupid, he watched as she inched her way closer and closer to the register, drawing out a few dirty dollar bills from the sagging collar of her blouse.  
  
  Out the doors they went, he with the listless plodding style of a dog after a bitch in heat, she making her way slowly with her gray sack drooping from its cut-out handles, veering broadly and awkwardly around the bands of noisy and brazen youngsters on the prowl. Is she talking to herself Seems so. I didn't scan her, this little being walking faster and faster. I scanned the beast behind her, who was wholly unable to see her as the sum of her parts.  
  
  Pallid, feeble faces flashed through his mind as he trailed behind her. He hungered to lie on top of old flesh; he hungered to put a hand over an old mouth.  
  
  When she reached her small forlorn apartment building, made of crumbling chalk, it seemed, like everything else in this seedy section of town, and guarded by bruised palmettos, he came to a sudden swaying stop, watching mutely as she walked back the narrow tiled courtyard and up the dusty green cement steps. He noted the number of her painted door as she unlocked it, or rather he clamped on to the location, and sinking back against the wall, he began to dream very specifically of killing her, in a featureless and empty bedroom that seemed no more than a smear of color and light.  
  
  Ah, look at him resting against the wall as if he had been stabbed, head lolling to one side. Impossible to be interested in him. Why don't I kill him now!  
  
  But the moments ticked, and the night lost its twilight incandescence. The stars grew ever more brilliant. The breeze came and went.  
  
  We waited.  
  
  Through her eyes, I saw her parlour as if I could really see through walls and floors-clean, though filled with careless old furniture of ugly veneer, round-shouldered, unimportant to her. But all had been polished with a scented oil she loved. Neon light passed through the Dacron curtains, milky and cheerless as the view of the yard below. But she had the comforting glow of her small carefully positioned lamps. That was what mattered to her.  
  
  In a maple rocking chair with hideous plaid upholstery, she sat composed, a tiny but dignified figure, open paperback novel hi hand. What happiness to be once more with Francie Nolan. Her thin knees were barely hidden now by the flowered cotton robe she had taken from her closet, and she wore the little blue slippers like socks over her small misshapen feet. She had made of her long gray hair one thick and graceful braid.  
  
  On the small black-and-white television screen before her, dead movie stars argued without making a sound. Joan Fontaine thinks Gary Grant is trying to kill her. And judging by the expression on his face, it certainly did seem that way to me. How could anyone ever trust Gary Grant, I wondered-a man who looked as though he were made entirely of wood  
  
  She didn't need to hear their words; she had seen this movie, by her careful count, some thirteen times. She had read this novel in her lap only twice, and so it will be with very special pleasure that she revisits these paragraphs, which she does not know yet by heart.  
  
  From the shadowy garden below, I discerned her neat and accepting concept of self, without drama and detached from the acknowledged bad taste that surrounded her. Her few treasures could be contained in any cabinet. The book and the lighted screen were more important to her than anything else she owned, and she was well aware of their spirituality. Even the color of her functional and styleless clothes was not worth her concern.  
  
  My vagabond killer was near paralysis, his mind a riot of moments so personal they defied interpretation.  
  
  I slipped around the little stucco building and found the stairs to her kitchen door. The lock gave easily when I commanded it to do so. And the door opened as if I had touched it, when I had not.  
  
  Without a sound I slipped into the small linoleum-tiled room. The stench of gas rising from the small white stove was sickening to me. So was the smell of the soap in its sticky ceramic dish. But the room touched my heart instantly. Beautify! the cherished china of Chinese blue and white, so neatly stacked, with plates displayed. Behold the dog-eared cookbooks. And how spotless her table with its shining oilcloth of pure yellow, and waxen green ivy growing in a round bowl of clear water, which projected upon the low ceiling a single quivering circle of light.  
  
  But what filled my mind as I stood there, rigid, pushing the door shut with my fingers, was that she was unafraid of death as she read her Betty Smith novel, as she occasionally glanced at the glittering screen. She had no inner antenna to pick up the presence of the spook who stood, sunk into madness, in the nearby street, or the monster who haunted her kitchen now.  
  
  The killer was immersed so completely in his hallucinations that he did not see those who passed him by. He did not see the police car prowling, or the suspicious and deliberately menacing looks of the uniformed mortals who knew all about him, and that he would strike tonight, but not who he was.  
  
  A thin line of spit moved down his unshaven chin. Nothing was real to him-not his life by day, not fear of discovery- only the electric shiver which these hallucinations sent through his hulking torso and clumsy arms and legs. His left hand twitched suddenly. There was a catch at the left side of his mouth.  
  
  I hated this guy! I didn't want to drink his blood. He was no classy killer. It was her blood I craved.  
  
  How thoughtful she was in her solitude and silence, how small, how contented, her concentration as fine as a light beam as she read the paragraphs of this story she knew so well. Traveling, traveling back to those days when she first read this book, at a crowded soda fountain on Lexington Avenue in New York City, when she was a smartly dressed young secretary in a red wool skirt and a white ruffled blouse with pearl buttons on the cuffs. She worked in a stone office tower, infinitely glamorous, with ornate brass doors on its elevators, and dark yellow marble tile in its halls.  
  
  I wanted to press my lips to her memories, to the remembered sounds of her high heels clicking on the marble, to the image of her smooth calf beneath the pure silk stocking as she put it on so carefully, not to snag it with her long enameled nails. I saw her red hair for an instant. I saw her extravagant and potentially hideous yet charming yellow brimmed hat.  
  
  That's blood worth having. And I was starving, starving as I have seldom been in all these decades. The unseasonal Lenten fast had been almost more than I could endure. Oh, Lord God, I wanted so to kill her!  
  
  Below in the street, a faint gurgling sound came from the lips of the stupid, clumsy killer. It cleared its way through the raging torrent of other sounds that poured into my vampiric ears.  
  
  At last, the beast lurched away from the wall, listing for a moment as if he would go sprawling, then sauntered towards us, into the little courtyard and up the steps.  
  
  Will I let him frighten her It seemed pointless. I have him in my sights, do I not Yet I allowed him to put his small metal tool into the round hole in her doorknob, I gave him time to force the lock. The chain tore loose from the rotten wood.  
  
  He stepped into the room, fixing upon her without expression. She was terrified, shrinking back in her chair, the book slipping from her lap.  
  
  Ah, but then he saw me in the kitchen doorway-a shadowy young man in gray velvet, glasses pushed up over his forehead. I was gazing at him in his own expressionless fashion. Did he see these iridescent eyes, this skin like polished ivory, hair like a soundless  
explosion of white light Or was I merely an obstacle between him and his sinister goal, all beauty wasted  
  
  In a second, he bolted. He was down the steps as the old woman screamed and rushed forward to slam the wooden door.  
  
  I was after him, not bothering to touch terra firma, letting him see me poised for an instant under the street lamp as he turned the corner. We went for half a block before I drifted towards him, a blur to the mortals, who didn't bother to notice. Then I froze beside him, and heard his groan as he broke into a run.  
  
  For blocks we played this game. He ran, he stopped, he saw me behind him. The sweat poured down his body. Indeed the thin synthetic fabric of the shirt was soon translucent with it, and clinging to the smooth hairless flesh of his chest.  
  
  At last he came to his seedy flophouse hotel and pounded up the stairs. I was in the small top-floor room when he reached it. Before he could cry out, I had him in my arms. The stench of his dirty hair rose in my nostrils, mingled with a thin acidic smell from the chemical fibers of the shirt. But it didn't matter now. He was powerful and warm in my arms, a juicy capon, chest heaving against me, the smell of his blood flooding my brain. I heard it pulsing through ventricles and valves and painfully constricted vessels. I licked at it in the tender red flesh beneath his eyes.  
  
  His heart was laboring and nearly bursting-careful, careful, don't crush him, I let my teeth clamp down on the wet leathery skin of his neck. Hmmm. My brother, my poor befuddled brother. But this was rich, this was good.  
  
  The fountain opened; his life was a sewer. All those old women, those old men. They were cadavers floating in the current; they tumbled against each other without meaning, as he went limp in my arms. No sport. Too easy. No cunning. No malice. Crude as a lizard he had been, swallowing fly after fly. Lord God, to know this is to know the time when the giant reptiles ruled the earth, and for a million years, only their yellow eyes beheld the falling rain, or the rising sun.  
  
  Never mind. I let him go, tumbling soundlessly out of my grip. I was swimming with his mammalian blood. Good enough. I closed my eyes, letting this hot coil penetrate my intestines, or whatever was down there now in this hard powerful white body. In a daze, I saw him stumbling on his knees across the floor. So exquisitely clumsy. So easy to pick him up from the mess of twisted and tearing newspapers, the overturned cup pouring its cold coffee into the dust-colored rug.  
  
  I jerked him back by his collar. His big empty eyes rolled up into his head. Then he kicked at me, blindly, this bully, this killer of the old and weak, shoe scuffing my shin. I lifted him to my hungry mouth again, fingers sliding through his hair, and felt him stiffen as if my fangs were dipped in poison.  
  
  Again the blood flooded my brain. I felt it electrify the tiny veins of my face. I felt it pulse even into my fingers, and a hot prickling warmth slide down my spine. Draught after draught filled me. Succulent, heavy creature. Then I let him go once more, and when he stumbled away this time, I went after him, dragging him across the floor, turning his face to me, then tossing him forward and letting him struggle again.  
  
  He was speaking to me now in something that ought to have been language, but it wasn't. He pushed at me but he could no longer see clearly. And for the first time a tragic dignity infused him, a vague look of outrage, blind as he was. It seemed I was embellished and enfolded now in old tales, in memories of plaster statues and nameless saints. His fingers clawed at the instep of my shoe. I lifted him up, and when I tore his throat this time, the wound was too big. It was done.  
  
  The death came like a fist in the gut. For a moment I felt nausea, and then simply the heat, the fullness, the sheer radiance of the living blood, with that last vibration of consciousness pulsing through all my limbs.  
  
  I sank down on his soiled bed. I don't know how long I lay there.  
  
  I stared at his low ceiling. And then when the sour musty smells of the room surrounded me, and the stench of his body, I rose and stumbled out, an ungainly figure as surely as he had been, letting myself go soft in these mortal gestures, in rage and hatred, in silence, because I didn't want to be the weightless one, the winged one, the night traveler. I wanted to be human, and feel human, and his blood was threaded all through me, and it wasn't enough. Not nearly enough!  
  
  Where are all my promises The stiff and bruised palmettos rattle against the stucco walls.  
  
  ""Oh, you're back,"" she said to me.  
  
  Such a low, strong voice she had, no tremor in it. She was standing in front of the ugly plaid rocker, with its worn maple arms, peering at me through her silver-rimmed glasses, the paperback novel clasped in her hand. Her mouth was small and shapeless and showing a bit of yellow teeth, a hideous contrast to the dark personality of the voice, which knew no infirmity at all.  
  
  What in God's name was she thinking as she smiled at me Why doesn't she pray  
  
  ""I knew you'd come,"" she said. Then she took off the glasses, and I saw that her eyes were glazed. What was she seeing What was I making her see I who can control all these elements flawlessly was so baffled I could have wept. ""Yes, I knew. ""  
  
  ""Oh And how did you know"" I whispered as I approached her, loving the embracing closeness of the common little room.  
  
  I reached out with these monstrous fingers too white to be human, strong enough to tear her head off, and I felt her little throat. Smell of Chantilly-or some other drugstore scent.  
  
  ""Yes,"" she said airily but definitely. ""I always knew. ""  
  
  ""Kiss me, then. Love me. ""  
  
  How hot she was, and how tiny were her shoulders, how gorgeous in this the final withering, the flower tinged with yellow, yet full of fragrance still, pale blue veins dancing beneath her flaccid skin, eyelids perfectly molded to her eyes when she closed them, the skin flowing over the bones of her skull.  
  
  ""Take me to heaven,"" she said. Out of the heart came the voice.  
  
  ""I can't. I wish I could,"" I was purring into her ear.  
  
  I closed my arms around her. I nuzzled her soft nest of gray hair. I felt her fingers on my face like dried leaves, and it sent a soft chill through me. She, too, was shivering. Ah, tender and worn little thing, ah, creature reduced to thought and will with a body insubstantial like a fragile flame! Just the ""little drink,"" Lestat, no more.  
  
  But it was too late and I knew it when the first spurt of blood hit my tongue. I was draining her. Surely the sounds of my moans must have alarmed her, but then she was past hearing. . . They never hear the real sounds once it's begun.  
  
  Forgive me.  
  
  Oh, darling!  
  
  We were sinking down together on the carpet, lovers in a patch of nubby faded flowers. I saw the book fallen there, and the drawing on the cover, but this seemed unreal. I hugged her so carefully, lest she break. But I was the hollow shell. Her death was coming swiftly, as if she herself were walking towards  
  
  me in a broad corridor, in some extremely particular and very important place. Ah, yes, the yellow marble tile. New York City, and even up here you can hear the traffic, and that low boom when a door slams on a stairway, down the hall.  
  
  Good night, my darling, she whispered.  
  
  Am I hearing things How can she still make words  
  
  I love you. Yes, darling. I love you too.  
  
  She stood in the hallway. Her hair was red and stiff and curling prettily at her shoulders; she was smiling, and her heels had been making that sharp, enticing sound on the marble, but there was only silence around her as the folds of her woolen skirt still moved; she was looking at me with such a strange clever expression; she lifted a small black snub-nosed gun and pointed it at me.  
  
  What the hell are you doing  
  
  She is dead. The shot was so loud that for a moment I could hear nothing. Only ringing in my ears. I lay on the floor staring blankly at the ceiling overhead, smelling cordite in a corridor in New York.  
  
  But this was Miami. Her clock was ticking on the table. From the overheated heart of the television came the pinched and tiny voice of Gary Grant telling Joan Fontaine that he loved her. And Joan Fontaine was so h  
appy. She'd thought for sure Gary Grant meant to kill her.  
  
  And so had I.  
  
  South Beach. Give me the Neon Strip once more. Only this time I walked away from the busy pavements, out over the sand and towards the sea.  
  
  On and on I went until there was no one near-not even the beach wanderers, or the night swimmers. Only the sand, blown clean already of ail the day's footprints, and the great gray nighttime ocean, throwing up its endless surf upon the patient shore. How high the visible heavens, how full of swiftly moving clouds and distant unobtrusive stars.  
  
  What had I done I'd killed her, his victim, pinched out the light of the one I'd been bound to save. I'd gone back to her and I'd lain with her, and I'd taken her, and she'd fired the invisible shot too late.  
  
  And the thirst was there again.  
  
  I'd laid her down on her small neat bed afterwards, on the dull quilted nylon, folding her arms and closing her eyes.  
  
  Dear God, help me. Where are my nameless saints Where are the angels with their feathered wings to carry me down into hell When they do come, are they the last beautiful thing that you see As you go down into the lake of fire, can you still follow their progress heavenward Can you hope for one last glimpse of their golden trumpets, and their upturned faces reflecting the radiance of the face of God What do I know of heaven  
  
  For long moments I stood there, staring at the distant night-scape of pure clouds, and then back at the twinkling lights of the new hotels, flash of headlamps.  
  
  A lone mortal stood on the far sidewalk, staring in my direction, but perhaps he did not note my presence at all-a tiny figure on the lip of the great sea. Perhaps he was only looking towards the ocean as I had been looking, as if the shore were miraculous, as if the water could wash our souls clean.  
  
  Once the world was nothing but the sea; rain fell for a hundred million years! But now the cosmos crawls with monsters. He was still there, that lone and staring mortal. And gradually I realized that over the empty sweep of beach and its thin darkness, his eyes were fixed intently on mine. Yes, looking at me.  
  
  I scarce thought about it, looking at him only because I did not bother to turn away. Then a curious sensation passed over me-and one which I had never felt before.  
  
  I was faintly dizzy as it began, and a soft tingling vibration followed, coursing through my trunk and then my arms and legs. It felt as if my limbs were growing tighter, narrower, and steadily compressing the substance within. Indeed, so distinct was this feeling that it seemed I might be squeezed right out of myself. I marveled at it. There was something faintly delicious about it, especially to a being as hard and cold and impervious to all sensations as I am. It was overwhelming, very like the way the drinking of blood is overwhelming, though it was nothing as visceral as that. Also no sooner had I analyzed it than I realized it was gone.  
  
  I shuddered. Had I imagined the entire thing I was still staring at that distant mortal-poor soul who gazed back at me without the slightest knowledge of who or what I was. There was a smile on his young face, brittle and full of crazed wonder. And gradually I realized I had seen this face before. I was further startled to make out in his expression now a certain definite recognition, and the odd attitude of expectation. Suddenly he raised his right hand and waved.  
  
  Balfling.  
  
  But I knew this mortal. No, more nearly accurate to say I had glimpsed him more than once, and then the only certain recollections returned to me with full force.  
  
  In Venice, hovering on the edge of the Piazza San Marco, and months after in Hong Kong, near the Night Market, and both times I had taken particular notice of him because he had taken particular notice of me. Yes, there stood the same tall, powerfully built body, and the hair was the same thick, wavy brown hair.  
  
  Not possible. Or do I mean probable, for there he stood!  
  
  Again he made the little gesture of greeting, and then hurriedly, indeed very awkwardly, he ran towards me, coming closer and closer with his strange ungainly steps as I watched in cold unyielding amazement.  
  
  I scanned his mind. Nothing. Locked up tight. Only his grinning face coming clearer and clearer as he entered the brighter luminous glare of the sea. The scent of his fear filled my nostrils along with the smell of his blood. Yes, he was terrified, and yet powerfully excited. Very inviting he looked suddenly- another victim all but thrown into my arms.  
  
  How his large brown eyes glittered. And what shining teeth he had.  
  
  Coming to a halt some three feet from me, his heart pounding, he held out a fat crumpled envelope in his damp and trembling hand.

We are moving out of our place soon and our landlord has been extremely unpleasant with us over text / face to face. 

He feels the flat isn’t at a fair standard of cleanliness for viewings / photos for marketing purposes but of course we are still living here and he really has more to stand on because 
the flat IS reasonably clean and tidy - he has pointed out minor issues and blown them up. 

One issue was some mould on our bathroom ceiling which has been a recurring issue since we moved in. He has painted it and tried to address the structural issues causing it. We try to keep it clean but told him months ago he would have to come repaint the ceiling again which he didn’t, so it was still there when he came for a viewing. 

At that viewing he took it upon himself to clean off the ceiling (fine) and then berate us about how disgusting we are over text (not so fine). Today I found he had taken a cloth from the kitchen (one I use specifically for my coffee machine) and hung it back up without cleaning it properly or even letting me know… I nearly used it today to make a coffee. 

Is this crazy behaviour or am I overreacting? 
Is there anything I can do about this? 

He’s being very confrontational over text so I don’t think it’s worthwhile talking to him about it or expecting any kind of apology but this just seems so out of line! ",1,1751293127.0,rentingUK,1,1.0,False

But when it comes to **your own business numbers** — you're probably just guessing.

I’ve worked with dozens of small construction and trade businesses. The pattern is always the same:  
– You’re working nonstop  
– The jobs are lined up  
– But somehow… the bank account doesn’t reflect the grind

Here’s the harsh truth 👉  
📉 **DIY bookkeeping isn’t saving you money — it’s costing you opportunity.**

❌ No job costing = no idea what you’re actually profiting  
❌ Missed deductions = paying too much in taxes  
❌ Messy books = denied for business loans  
❌ CPA ghosts you right when you need help

If you're serious about growing your contracting business — you need clean books, cash flow clarity, and financial systems that don’t fall apart when you're busy building for others.

""Get out of my house."" his house? i moved in with him, yeah. but i help with everything. bills, chores, everything. i don’t just sit around. but that’s how he talks to me when he’s mad. like i’m trash. like i’m disposable. and it’s not just yelling. i mean, he’ll actually make me leave. once, it was 11PM. i was literally in my pajamas. barefoot. he said he “needed space” and “couldn’t breathe” around me. i ended up sitting at a 24-hour diner crying over a cheap coffee because i had nowhere else to go. i called him. he ignored me. i texted. read, no reply. but i kept coming back. every time. i’d apologize just so we could be okay again. even when i didn’t start it. even when i didn’t do anything wrong. i just didn’t want to fight. i wanted my husband back. the good version of him, the one who holds my hand while we watch tv or kisses me on the forehead when i’m sick. but that guy disappears more and more lately. this last time though… it was bad. we were arguing about something dumb again. 

i honestly can’t even remember what started it. i said something like, “can we talk without yelling for once?” and he just flipped. said i was being “too much” and “emotional” and told me to pack my stuff. again. but i didn’t. not this time. i looked him dead in the eye and said, “you don’t get to keep throwing me away like this. i’m not coming back.” he laughed. dead serious. like it was a joke. like i was the joke. so i left. i went to a cheap hotel and i’ve been here two nights now. i used my savings. i barely ate yesterday. i’ve just been crying and thinking and trying not to go crazy. his mom texted me saying i was being immature, and that “wives don’t just walk away when things get tough.” she said i need to go back and fix things. but i’m so tired of fixing things he keeps breaking. now he’s blowing up my phone with “i’m sorry” texts. says he didn’t mean it. says he just needed space. again. and i’m sitting here thinking... is this how marriage is supposed to be? is it normal to get kicked out like you’re nothing every time things get tense? is it my fault for not being more patient? for not keeping my mouth shut?or is this the part where i finally choose myself, even if it means i end up completely alone?
