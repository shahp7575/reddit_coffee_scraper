While I was away, one of my team members temporarily took on some of my responsibilities. When I came back, my manager confirmed that my role remained the same, and I began catching up on projects.

At first, everything seemed fine, but then I noticed a shift in this team member‚Äôs behavior. She became cold, distant, and uncooperative. It started three months ago when she snapped at me during a team meeting. I addressed it with her separately, and she apologized, saying she didn‚Äôt realize she was being rude. I brushed it off but made my manager aware so he had context.

Not long after, I had a discussion with my manager about my workload and whether we needed maternity cover for her upcoming leave. He decided to reassign some of her work to another team member and called her into a meeting to inform her. From that point on, her attitude toward me worsened. When I later asked her about her behavior, she told me I was the one triggering all of this and that I shouldn‚Äôt have had that meeting without her. I explained that I was simply raising my own capacity concerns, but she remained cold and dismissive.

In the same conversation, she also claimed that our manager and another senior leader had offered her my role while I was on leave. She said she never wanted the role and that it was mine anyway, but the way she said it made me question whether she felt she was still in charge. I found this concerning since my manager had assured me my position hadn‚Äôt changed.

Her hostility continued‚Äîshe avoided me, was uncooperative in meetings, and I heard from others that she was speaking negatively about me behind my back. Wanting to clear the air, I invited her and another colleague for a casual coffee chat. Instead of a constructive conversation, she turned to me and said, ‚ÄúDo you want sympathy? Do you want empathy? There are plenty of other mothers who have had emergency deliveries.‚Äù Then she walked off, leaving the conversation unfinished.

I later spoke to my manager about this, but he downplayed it, saying maybe she‚Äôs stressed, doesn‚Äôt like being managed, or had too many meetings. The next day, despite her previous comments, I still tried to offer input when she needed help, only for her to shut me down with a short ‚ÄúI‚Äôm busy.‚Äù

This has been ongoing for three months. I‚Äôve tried to stay professional, but I feel like I‚Äôm being shut out and undermined. Has anyone else experienced something like this after returning from leave? How did you handle it? Would appreciate any advice.

Is it time to reconsider this relationship?","TW: EDs

I'd like to start by saying I sincerely believe my partner is the love of my life. Or was. I'm already starting to emotionally clock out and that's unfair to both him and I. 

I know all couples go through rough patches, and I genuinely don't know if this is just a ""rough patch"" or something I really need to reconsider. 

Let's start with this: After doing long distance, we finally decided to move in together last summer (2024). I quit my job, moved countries, committed myself to learning the country's language, and took up a lot of the housework. 

At first, everything was great. We got along incredibly well, he tried to do some housework when time allowed, and he graciously covered a lot of our expenses while I waited to reach a sufficient level of the country's language (I enrolled in intensive courses) in order to get a job. I love spending time with his family, his friends and I get along great, and at this point we've basically been living the married live without actually being married. 

We just signed the lease for a new flat together. 

And for some reason, it seems like everything is going downhill. 

I had a therapist for a couple of years that helped me unpack childhood trauma, emotional abuse--basically what I'm trying to say is I'd like to think I picked up some healthy communication habits from them. I was also a teacher, previously, and have been told I have the patience of a saint. 

That being said, I like to approach my partner and I's discussions in a calm manner, when we both have time, and in a non-stressful environment (e.g. home). Yet, this somehow always ends with him ultimately saying ""Well, I guess now I'm the bad guy."" 

I've stressed time and again that I've never once used those words, I don't want him to think he's the ""bad guy"", I'm only discussing how his actions made me feel, and when he drops that phrase, I feel like my feelings are being invalidated and I'm then made to cater to his.

I'll give some examples.

1. Healthy eating. 

I have OCD (diagnosed). I suffer from obsessive compulsive thoughts about certain topics (e.g. contamination), and have had a run in with eating disorders in the past (""no soda"" turned into ""no processed food"" turned into ""no processed sugar"" turned into...and so on and so forth). 

I mentioned that with our awesome new flat I'd be so happy to make chicken nuggets in the oven (yes the dino ones, and I don't plan on eating them every day or even every week).

My partner said we don't eat heathy enough and that he'd like to start implementing rules. Five days a week we eat healthy and on the weekend, we can eat other things. 

I told him that eating healthier is something we can always improve on, and I'm happy to incorporate more healthy food into our diet, but I'm not comfortable with ""rules"" about what we should and shouldn't eat, when we should or shouldn't eat things. Plus, we already eat pretty healthy (we cook most of the time at home, using fresh, non-frozen ingredients, make our own sauces, buy organic when we can, and keep the processed foods and sweets to a once-in-a-while thing. Plus, we live in Europe, so we walk quite literally everywhere).

He said that having processed food around would be a temptation for him and would affect his ability to eat healthy. And that rules would help us stick to our healthier eating goals. He's aware of my past struggles with food and my OCD, so I told him I had to set a boundary with the foods. I can't allow myself to overthink what I'm eating (e.g. when I buy juice and he always, and I do mean always, comments about the sugar it contains, I've explained that this affects me negatively), or I will absolutely spiral down the ED path again. I reiterated that I'm more than happy to incorporate more healthy food into our diet, but I can't be told what or when we should or shouldn't eat certain things. 

He got upset that I was drawing a boundary, then brought up how I sometimes comment on his smoking habits and it bothers him. I said that if he wants to draw a boundary on smoking, that's okay with me. If it's bothering him and making him feel uncomfortable, that's completely understandable. He asked me why I comment on him smoking. I replied that early in our relationship, he made it a goal to quit, and that he wanted my help and reminders to stop smoking. He said then, that he'll decide when and where he quits smoking, and that because I drew a boundary about our eating habits, he was going to draw a boundary about the smoking, *otherwise it wouldn't be fair.* 

I told him boundaries are made when something makes us uncomfortable, but you setting that boundary just because I set a boundary about food, doesn't sit right with me. It feels like a retaliation. 

He response was to tell me that I need to start working internally on the problems I have with food because they weren't normal. He then told me I can eat whatever I want during the day, but for dinner, the one meal we share together, it would be nice to follow the rule.

2. Running

I don't enjoy running. Whatsoever. My partner consistently and repetitively asks me to go on a run with him, even after several discussions and arguments about it. I told him I don't enjoy it, I'd rather find another way to stay fit. After a run last year, I went to an ortho and discovered I have slight damage to my meniscus and bone issues affecting my cartilage. I got a nice knee brace that keeps everything where it's supposed to be. He insists now we can and should go running. 

I told him I don't want to discuss the issue more, *many times*, but he inevitably asks me again. He revealed that it's because he thinks I'll eventually change my mind one of these days. And that if I tell him I ""never"" want to go running again, he'll stop asking. 

I should also mention he did very kindly buy me good running shoes when I started showing signs of knee pain, but now that I'm not running, he's telling me to sell them. 

And again, he's the ""bad guy"" for wanting me to be healthy and trying to get me to run and me telling him I'm feeling pressured into going running and like I'm disappointing him if I don't go. (Once, he said it was to his ""displeasure"" that I wasn't exercising enough, which lead to another argument). 

Conclusion:

These are just some examples. I'm so conflicted because at times it seems he's so emotionally mature and at others, not. He's so so sweet. He brings me coffee in bed every morning. He gives me massages (though that, too, has turned into a tit for tat). He covered us financially while I was taking intensive language courses and searching for a new job (which I'll be starting soon). He sends me pictures of dogs he sees because he knows I love dogs. He encourages me to pursue my hobbies, always serves me food first, holds my hand to support me going down the stairs when my knee hurts...I really, truly do love him.

Any advice for how to navigate these difficult discussions with him? Am I coming onto these arguments too strongly, and if so, how can I phrase things better? Or is it ultimately time to start reconsidering our relationship? 

Much love and thanks xx

I (27F) moved to Chicago last August and have been unemployed since. Before my move I was in a small software company doing tech support, hoping to move into a more IT-focused role which is what my degree was in. Basically after months and months of banging my head into a wall trying to break back in, I am still unemployed and it's hard to even want to get back into IT as it feels like I have an abusive relationship with the industry. I want a do-over since I picked this degree when I was 17 and I didn't really know what I was in for.

  
Recently, however, I've been learning web development and it's been a lot of fun. It's something I enjoyed in college but I only scratched the surface really. Still, I feel like I absolutely have the makings of a great web developer. I have been following The Odin Project, taking it slow, making sure to really absorb all the knowledge I possibly can, and hopefully after I finish TOP and create a portfolio of work I want to get into the world of web development. It is legitimately fun in a way IT never was. The only issue is that I have no income. My wife makes near six figures which has been keeping us afloat but I need to work so we can live more comfortably.

  
The plan? Work in a thrift store or coffee shop while focusing my full attention on learning web development. I assume that if I really dig in and focus my full attention, it will take me a full year or more to be comfortable enough in my skills to start looking for a webdev job. Who knows, maybe tech will be out of its current hiring funk? I am attracted to coffee and thrift because A.) I have been a barista before and I'm damn good at it and B.) I have a very large interest in fashion and feel like I could really creatively express myself working in a thrift store. I would also be able to make some friends along the way.

  
Basically, this feels like the first time in months I have had any direction other than spamming job applications to get into an industry I don't want to be in. What do y'all think? Is web development something I should pursue? Is it going to still be a relevant industry 10, 20 years in the future, especially with the advent of AI and codeless website builders? If you are in web development, what would you have done at the beginning to give yourself an advantage?

I just asked her if she would like to go out sometime, have a coffee, but to no avail. I turned to YouTube, and stumbled upon what is referred to as The Red Pill (it's not just an internet thing, it is an actual phenomenon in my personal belief), and this channel called The33Secrets.. there was this American guy and he openly advertised himself as a pickup coach, and he was offering courses teaching how to you know like pick up girls, be Alpha and all that stuff. But the course was too expensive and I just ignored it, BUT what really shocked me, because although having been exposed to American cinema, and knowing that over there ""Dating"" usually started in teens and stuff, I was shocked to learn how common divorces in the US were,50% mostly initiated by wives, how women centred their family laws were, like even in cases of adultery, the man had to pay the alimony or face jail time. I thought he was just making it up, but then I started reading the comments, dozens and dozens of men recounting their own personal experiences. They had loved, gotten married, she had cheated, divorce, alimony. Poor men, middle class men, rich men. Even in case of a paternity test, even if the child is found to be of another man, the husband still had to pay up. The court system was also very misandrist, almost always siding with the woman. Child support and alimony had to be paid, or go to jail. The Youtuber talked about how this had become the thing now, how promiscuity had destroyed and entire generation of women, how hook up culture and the steamrolling of traditional value system had destroyed the family unit, and the resulting consequences. 
After this I stumbled upon other Manosphere/RedPill content videos, and I had also experienced similar things, seen such cases with some of my guy friends...anyways it has caught up to India now guys. The statistics don't lie, more young Indian men every year are saying Don't want to get married in multiple surveys..there are actual stories coming out, in the media, online social media, Divorces are rising in India.
So just be aware of all this, the next time you ""fall in love"" and decide to tie the knot. 
Ofcourse not all girls are like that many say, but with today's dating and hook up culture, easy connectivity online, the rise of promiscuity, the rise of greed and materialism, just be careful.
She could be your high school sweetheart, you could have been married for years, and have children, but ""an affair"" can happen anytime anywhere. Just remember the female of the species also has strong urges, they have a mind of their own, they can also lie, cheat, manipulate etc.and can be greedy. People are just people, and people can change..
Anyways it is what it is, my intention is not to discourage anyone from getting married or anything like that, I'm just saying life is not always going to be a bed of roses like you imagine, nor is fidelity a guaranteed thing. Just see things, and people for what they are, just see through society and be wise. Cheers ",3,1742910662.0,onexindia,1,1.0,False

After tons of doctor appointments with all kinds of specialists, we found out that the two rounds cipro he was prescribed for two UTIs four months ago was most likely the reason he has been experiencing so much pain throughout his body. I don‚Äôt really know what my purpose is in posting, other than to just get some support or suggestions. 

My dad is 84, but maintains an active lifestyle and is otherwise very healthy. After getting prescribed the cipro for two UTIs, he started suffering with extreme pain in his major muscle groups, including upper arms, thighs, buttocks, and wrists. It‚Äôs so bad that he can barely lift his coffee cup in the morning. I feel completely devastated for him that this could be due to this antibiotic. He wasn‚Äôt issued any kind of warning, and it seems like it‚Äôs common knowledge at this point that cipro shouldn‚Äôt be prescribed to patients over 60 years of age. 

I guess my question for the community is- does the pain ever improve? Is there anything to do about it? Has anyone had any luck working with a doctor to treat this? His internist that prescribed the medication is dodging questions about the risks of prescribing cipro to over 60, so it seems like he wouldn‚Äôt be the right doctor to work with, as the problem started with being in his medical care. My mom and dad are starting an elimination diet and he‚Äôs trying to walk a couple miles a day, but outside of that, we‚Äôre at a dead end.

Almost zero anxiety, even a boost in libido (at a later time in my cycle which is rare), and all around feeling much better, even with a few nights of bad sleep.

I‚Äôm running Ubuntu 24.04 with GNOME 46.2 on Wayland, using a hybrid GPU setup: Intel UHD Graphics 630 (i915 driver) and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 Mobile (driver version 550.120, nvidia-drm). I have two screens:

- **External monitor** (via HDMI): 2560x1080 at 179.96 Hz, where the cursor is fluid at 180 Hz, but windows and other elements feel stuck at 60 Hz.

I‚Äôve tried switching to full NVIDIA mode with `sudo prime-select nvidia` and rebooted, but it didn‚Äôt change anything. The external monitor still has the same issue: cursor at 180 Hz, windows locked at a lower frequency (seems like 60 Hz). The internal screen remains perfectly fluid at 240 Hz.

It seems like Mutter/Wayland isn‚Äôt applying the full 180 Hz refresh rate to windows on the external monitor, even though the hardware supports it (cursor works fine). The internal screen at 240 Hz has no issues. Any ideas on how to fix this? Should I try Xorg or tweak something in Wayland/Mutter?

I shout, and she looks frozen in fear. I step closer to her and she snaps out of it and takes a step back. Before something dark takes over her features.
""Courtney. Tell me ...""
She punches me in the face and I stagger back and everyone goes quiet.
""Do I look like that bimbo over there? No, so screw you Kaden, this baby is mine and is nothing to do with you. You lost your rights when you f****d that."" She screams, pointing at Chloe.
""bimbo, who the heck do you think you are punching? He is my man!"" Chloe screams, ""Daddy, why is she here? What the heck is going on?"" Chloe screeches like a wounded cat.
""She is my daughter! Your sister and by what has just happened, I would say you and him have a lot of explaining to do. So my office now! Storm, go and check on Courtney and bring her as well."" Wolf gives his orders and Chloe and I just look stunned. No, this is not possible.
Courtney POV.
Today is my 20th birthday.
I stand here alone, dressed in all black. The rain beats against the umbrella that is in my hand, mimicking my own sorrow as the tears fall silently. My free hand reaches up to the gold chain that is around my neck. Where mom's wedding ring sits. The ring my semen donor gave her when he married her.
I don't even know who he is or why she left him. All I know is that she ran with me when I was a baby. She promised me she would tell me on my twenty-first birthday. But she never will.
A small kick makes me drop the necklace and I rub my swollen belly. Yes, twenty years old and pregnant. The man I thought I was in love with and loved me only lasted a few months before I found him balls deep in some other woman. According to her, I was a child and couldn't handle a man like him. He didn't even shut her up, she can have him.
I don't need him or his precious club. Kaden Venom Frost is a president of a motorcycle club or MC called Satan's Reapers. I had no business getting involved with a man like him, but I did and look how that ended.
Momma always warned me to stay away from bikers. All they do is cause you heartache, she would say. She wasn't wrong because they do.
We moved here not long after I found out I was pregnant where there weren't any bikers. If any were seen in any town we were in, we would up and leave, leaving no trace of our presence.
Why was she running like this?
Either way. It no longer matters. She was diagnosed with cancer not long after we moved here. Stage 4, she was given six weeks to live; she lasted twelve. I held her hand as she took her final breath just past midnight on Christmas. I won't remember her like that. I will remember her as the carefree, fun-loving and proud momma bear she was.
The priest is speaking, but I'm not listening. It is only me and him here. We kept to ourselves and because we moved so often, we never made friends with anyone.
I'm truly alone. Well, not completely. In about four months, my little bean will be here. This baby is loved so deeply already. Momma left a lot of money for us. I think she always knew something like this would happen.
""Amen."" The priest says and I repeat what he has said. I look down and my momma is now in her final resting place. I walk to the mound of earth and take a hand full I walk towards the edge and smile down.
""Momma, you are no longer in pain. Please don't worry about us, we will both be ok. I know you will always be here, momma. I love you so much. Rest in peace."" I throw the dirt and step back and just watch as the ground is slowly being covered.
I wait until she is completely covered. No sooner did they shovel the last of the earth did the rain stop and the sun shone through. The God rays shining down on momma's final resting place. I chuckle and look up at the sky. A sad smile on my face.
""Love you, momma. Always light the way."" I turn to walk towards my car when I heard the distance rumble of motorbikes. I freeze, then shake my head as I walk away. Only to stop when a huge convoy of bikes enters the cemetery. I just stand back and watch.
The leader pulls over and jumps from his bike, throwing his helmet as he runs towards ... Momma's grave. He drops to his knees and screams in pain. Who is he? I stand there in shock at what I'm seeing. I stagger slightly no. Not now! Why now?
""Caitlyn!"" He roars and my breath catches in my throat. I'm stuck. I can't move, even though everything in me is telling me to move and get out of there. He is sobbing when he turns his head and looks right at me.
His eyes go wide like he is seeing a ghost. He mumbles something under his breath and all the men turn to look at me. Oh!
""Courtney, baby girl, is that you?""
I walk away as fast as I can towards my car when my upper arm is grabbed. I turn round, and on instinct, I punch him in the face. The men gasp and some are wincing with the force I used. He looks at me, blood pouring from his nose and lip.
""Never, and I mean ever, put your hands on me, sir. I don't know who you think you are or why you are here. But back off."" I snap at him and he looks at me, stunned. I think I broke him.
""Courtney. I've finally found you, baby girl. I have been looking for you and your momma for twenty years."" Nooooo way! No, no, no, no, I refuse to believe this prick is my semen donor. There is no chance.
I fight the urge to vomit. My heart is beating hard and loudly. Can he hear it? Why is so big? Then again, all bikers are.
I'm almost certain they are werewolves or something. Either that or they truly love steroids. I mean, he puts the hulk to shame. And I ... Oh, I've just punched him in the face.
""You have the wrong person. I don't know who you are referring to. Sorry for your loss."" I say as I step back before looking him up and down in disgust. How dare he? Like seriously. f
k him and his heartbreak. If momma could see me now, she would be laughing at my choice of words right after she shot him.
""You're so much like her, a real spitfire. Same red hair as her, but those eyes, baby girl, those eyes are mine. Not to mention that gold chain with the diamond wedding band around your neck are your momma's. My wife."" I instinctively touch the chain. No! Absolutely not.
""Courtney Nevaeh Morrison, you are my daughter. I have been looking for you both for the past twenty years. Now I have found you. I'm not letting you go."" The tears are falling from my eyes, but not with joy. No, from hate, rage, and anger. I'm shaking with it, ready to explode like an atom bomb. How dare he? Who the f
k does he think he is? Oh right, daddy dearest.
Well!
""You think you can claim me as your long-lost daughter after twenty years? You're dead wrong. I ain't going anywhere with you. Try it if you dare. But don't think I won't put up a fight, because I will happily lay you out."" I say and he smiles at me, full of amusement.
""Ok, ok. You will come to me when you are ready. The name is ...""
""I don't care who are you or what your name is. I don't need you and I never have. I have been doing well without you. Goodbye."" I turn and walk away towards my car.
""Keep telling yourself that, darlin. But you and your baby will come to me soon enough. I'm not giving up on you, Courtney. Not now, not ever."" He shouts after me. I reach my car and stop. Looking over my shoulder.
""Too bad you will be waiting a long time. Because that will never happen. I would say it was nice to meet you, but momma always told me to tell the truth. So I won't."" I open the car door and climb inside, slamming the door shut.
My hands are shaking, and my heart is racing. My little bean is quiet for now. I start my car and drive away. Checking the rear-view to make sure I'm not being followed. Which I'm not. Thank you, momma and God, of course.
Looks like I need to leave and find a new town. I chuckle. What's the point? He has found me now; I need to get rid of the car and use momma's for a while. I pull into the street where our house is.
The street is quiet; the neighbors watch out for each other and it's super safe. I drive toward the house and park the car in the garage. Thank god. I climb out and walk out of the garage, pressing the fob for the garage doors to roll closed.
I walk up the porch steps and open the front door. Kicking it closed behind me. I remove my shoes and coat. I walk barefoot into the living room. I look at the sofa, expecting to see her sitting there. I sigh and wipe my eyes as I walk to the kitchen and wash my hands and make a drink.
I lean my butt against the counter and think of the cluster f**k today has been. I pat my belly as bean kicks again.
""It's ok baby, we will be ok. I will make sure we are."" I sigh as I move back to the living room and sit down on the sofa. Before I know it, I'm sobbing, clutching a pillow to my chest as I let it out. Tomorrow is a new day. Silver linings and all.
Courtney POV.
""Ok, sweetie, stop doing that unless you want me to pee my pants?"" I stretch in bed and bean kicks and wiggles on my bladder. I chuckle and rub my growing bump.
I push up and stand, rubbing my eyes as I enter my en-suite bathroom. I look in the mirror that is over the sinks and wince. My eyes are crusty and swollen from all the crying and my pale skin is blotchy. Dried drool on my cheek, lovely.
I use the toilet and wash my hands and face. Grabbing my toothbrush, I get to work. Wiping my mouth as I walk back into my bedroom. No point in getting dressed. I'm not planning on going anywhere for the next few days. I just want to surround myself with the memories of momma. Maybe cry some more. The possibilities are endless in grief.
I grab my dressing gown and put it on and my fluffy slippers and leave the bedroom. Holding my bump, I walk down the stairs. Only to stop, the fine hairs on the back of my neck stand to attention.
There, sitting on the sofa holding a framed photograph of me and momma, is the semem donor. Didn't take him long to find me.
""Why are you here? How did you get in?"" I say and he stands, turning to look at me. He has tears streaming down his face. He gently places the photograph on the coffee table.
""Courtney, I know you don't want to see me, but ...""
I cut him off. ""Yet, here you are. Look, you know I want nothing to do with you. Whatever happened to make momma run with me, I'm assuming it is because of you. So please, leave me alone. I can't deal with this right now."" I say as I try my hardest to look menacing with the way I'm glaring at him. My fists are balled tight at my side.
He sighs and looks down, his emotions showing on his face. I scoff as I walk to the kitchen to make a drink.
I had bad morning sickness and couldn't drink coffee but now it has passed and I can. In moderation, of course, but still. I open the cupboard and freeze seeing momma's mug that I painted for her when I was five years old. She always drank from it. I reach behind it and grab mine. It says, My World, My daughter, Love Momma. I take it down and softly close the cupboard and start on my drink. I know he is behind me, but I won't turn or offer him one.
I always wanted to know who he was, but here he was in my kitchen and the timing couldn't have been worse. The way he rode up on his bike with his crew and then expecting me to run into his arms like a cheesy reunion from some kind of soap opera. He deeply hurt momma and in turn me.
""Court, please, baby girl. Let me explain."" I walk round him and back into the living room. I sit down and grab the pillow and place it on my lap. It was momma's pillow. She loved her scatter cushions and her home comforts. Like throw blankets, deep soft pillows, candles, and pebbles.
We would sit on this very sofa in the winter months, in onesies, wrapped up in blankets sitting side by side with our fluffy socked feet on the coffee table, sharing popcorn watching movies. My momma was like my best friend. We would tell each other everything.
Well, almost everything, giving the present unwanted guest in my home.
""Go on then, explain. Why did my momma run? What did you do to her? Why now?"" I fire at him. Momma always said I had a mouth on me and an inquisitive mind. I wanted to know the ins and outs of everything. She was always happy to answer my questions unless it was about her family or where I came from.
That was a huge guarded secret, a secret she took to the grave. Now I'm depressed again. I look away and take a few calming breaths to stop the spiral of my emotions. I'm mad, sad, confused and scared for the answers.
""I cheated on your momma. I was drugged. The woman that drugged me is no longer part of the club. When I came too and found you both gone, I knew your momma must have seen what I did. I'm sorry, baby, I was too late to tell her the truth. I have had my club and other clubs looking for you both. Your momma was skilled in hiding."" He says, looking down in shame.
My heart freezes in my chest. He cheated on momma? Now I know why she always said to stay away from bikers. Even Kaden did the same thing.
""You are all the same. You are so eager to get off it doesn't matter who gets hurt in the process."" I mumble and he looks at me.
""A biker hurt you? I want his name."" He asks and I don't answer him. I just sip my coffee. I sigh and just shake my head.
""No point. He made his choice. I won't see him again."" I say and rub my bump. He is watching me.
""I'm sorry Courtney, you haven't had a good impression with bikers. We aren't all like me and whoever he is. Some are good and some well, are bad. That brings me to why I'm here."" I look up at him and he is looking at me seriously.
""Did your momma ever talk about how we met?"" he asks and I shake my head because she didn't say anything about him or her family.
""No, why?"" I ask seeing him flinch maybe he knows and I will finally be able to learn about what her life was like before I came along.
""I met your momma in a diner in a different state. She was the most beautiful woman I had ever laid my eyes on."" He smiles and looks wistful. I can see the love shining in his eyes as he speaks.
""You look just like her. The only difference is ...""
""I have your eyes."" I say, and he chuckles and nods his head.
""Yeah, you do. I went back to that diner everyday I was there. I knew then and there she would be my ole lady, my wife. She told me she was running from bad people and with me being a president of a club. It is the code that we help women and children in need. Your momma was scared about who was after her. She told me her family was attacked in the dead of night. Her momma, father and older brother were killed. She ran and never looked back. We married four moths later, and you came along eighteen months later."" He says and I'm leaning forward listening to the story.
""She was the most beautiful creature on the planet. Strong, fierce and wouldn't take anyone's s
t, mine included. But she had a soft, loving and gentle side to her. Then she walked in or was told about what happened that night. She ran. My world collapsed that day I found you both missing. I thought the people responsible for the deaths of her family had found her and you,"" he says, his elbows braced on his knees as he watches me.
""What are you trying to say?"" I ask him and he looks at me his jaw is ticking and I know he is angry.
""You are in danger, Courtney, you and your child both. I won't lose you. You are coming with me, you both will be safe, I promise you that,"" he says and I look at him as he stands up.
I blink at him and start laughing. Is he for real? Does he think I can't protect myself? I think the bruising to his face should remind him I can, in fact, defend myself. Not to mention the guns I have in the house.
""If your job as club president doesn't pan out, I think you have a promising career in comedy. This is utter nonsense. We are not in danger. Listen to yourself, for god's sake. If whoever they were had found me and momma, we would be dead by now. That is, if anything you have said is true. You are only here to try to get me to come with you. I wasn't born yesterday, wait you already know that."" I laugh as I struggle to stand. He moves to help me, but I straighten up before he can.
""Courtney, I am being serious. Why do you think you and your momma moved so much? She knew they would be looking for her. Without the protection from the club, she and you were both vulnerable."" He says as the front door opens and three huge men step inside. They all nod at my dad before they smile at me.
""You are coming with me, even if it is until we figure out who it was. Please darlin, I can't lose my daughter or grandchild. Your momma would understand.""
""You have had twenty years to find out the truth, and you are no closer to it. Look, I can pack up and leave. Whoever they are will never find me."" I say more to myself than him and he sighs, stepping forward. He reaches for me and I flinch away. He doesn't stop there. He rubs his thumb under my eye.
""They will know who you are. What you look like. How do you think I found you? Your details were easy to find from the death register database. One search of your momma's name and we found out everything about you. We don't know who they are. But."" I raise an eyebrow at him. Waiting for him to continue.
""Have you ever heard of the Devil's Warriors?"" He asks and I look at him confused.
""Pretend I don't. Who are they?"" I sass back. See, my mouth gets me into a lot of s
t.
""They are the biggest MC in the world. Word on the street is their club president was looking for your momma. We don't know why. We believe whoever killed her family had requested help from them. This is serious, Courtney."" He is trying to scare me and it's working.
I rub my bump and look down, thinking about what he has told me. Who ever was after momma is after me too. I could fight my way out, but I can't risk getting hurt while I'm pregnant. I would never forgive myself if anything happened to my bean, especially if I can prevent it. I sigh, looking up at him.
""I suppose it's better the devil you know than the one you don't. Fine, I will come with you, but you have four months to find whoever they are. Then I leave."" I say to him and he smiles and nods his head.
""Ok, boys, help her pack and load her up,"" he says and I sigh. Momma, what did you get involved with?
Courtney POV
I pack my clothes, toiletries, and things I will need to stay where ever I will be.
""Is there anything else you need, darlin?"" One of the men called Snake asks as he zips up the third suitcase. I look around my bedroom and sigh. I grab my pillow and leave the room.
Walking back down stairs dad is on the phone, and I sit down on the sofa. I type an email to work and tell them I will be working from home for the foreseeable. I don't think the club will allow me to leave.
I'm an artist. My designs have been used worldwide for various things, from signage, to decals for cars and bikes, to book covers. I need my iPad and laptop. I can't just do nothing while I'm imprisoned. So may as well make money.
Momma bought the house and so I don't have to worry about that. The door bell rings and the men all drawn their guns and I sigh as I stand again when my dad grabs my arm and shakes his head no.
""Courtney darling, are you ok?"" I sigh and look at him and roll my eyes.
""One minute Mrs Johnson."" I look at my dad, and he nods his head once as I move and open the door.
""Oh Courtney dear, are you ok?"" she asks as she looks around me and into the living room.
""Oh hi Mrs Johnson, what can I help you with?"" I say to her and she looks sadly at me and pulls me into a hug. My arms are at my side. I slowly hug her back.
""Everything will be ok, sweetheart. I know she loved you very much. You could see it whenever you were both together. If you need anything, call me."" I nod my head. I won't I don't even have her number or need her being a nosey prick.
""Thanks, look I have to go. I have a lot to sort out. Have a nice day."" I say as I prepare to close the door.
""Are you in some sort of trouble?"" I stop closing the door and look at her and she smirks, looking at the bikes.
""No, those belong to long-time friends of my momma. They are here to ..."" Why am I explaining to this nosey old bat?
""Never mind, I have to go. Take care, bye Mrs Johnson."" I shut the door and see my dad and the guys looking and me in different stages of amusement. I groan and move away from the door.
""She seems nice."" Dad says and I just give him a pointed look.
""She is a nosey ole biddy who has nothing better to do than gossip. Momma was always nice to her, but me, not so much."" I say, and Snake chuckles.
""Ruthless."" He says as he hands my suitcases to the other two. One is called Storm, and the other is called Dagger. Where do they come up with these names?
I learnt my dad is called Hunter Wolf Harrison. Morrison was my momma's maiden name. His club is called the Devil's Army. Why are all the names associated in some way or other to the Devil? I suppose it makes them sound scary.
""Ok you ready to go?"" Dad asks me. I'm not ready, but I suppose I have to be now more than ever until he finds out who these people are. And why they have recruited the help of the Devil's Warriors.
I leave the house and walk to the garage with my momma's keys in my hand. I open the garage and walk to her baby.
Her Ford Ranger Raptor. Momma loves big American trucks, whereas me, I like the classic American muscle cars, the Dodge Challenger. You can never go wrong with a bit of American muscle.
I hit the fob and the Raptor beeps. I move to the trunk and open it up and the men place my things inside.
A low whistle makes me turn my head as Storm runs his hand up over the smooth, sleek lines of my car.
""Now that right there is a work of art."" He says and I smile at him and walk closer to him.
""Yeah, she is. She is my baby. The first car I bought with my first paycheck. She didn't look like this when I got her. I worked long and hard getting her to this stage. Complete overhaul with her body, chassis, and engine."" I say to him and he looks at me and blinks rapidly.
""Wait, you built her from the bare bones?"" He asks in awe, and I smile and nod my head.
""Sure did. Momma always said I'm not just a pretty face, even when it was covered in grease and oil."" I say, and he smiles at me and winks at me. I don't feel uncomfortable with him or any of them.
""I dismantled my first engine when I was seven years old and put it back together. Momma taught me that, too."" I say remembering the memory of us both sitting on the dirt covered ground both in dirty dungarees grease on our hands and faces as we both dismantled it together so she could teach me. Her long red wavy hair was in a loose, messy bun on top of her head. Her gold chain around her neck with the wedding ring inside her white vest top.
""Will she stay here?"" Storm asks me, and I know why they call him Storm. He has blonde hair and silver eyes. I nod my head.
""She will, until the danger has passed, then I will come back for her."" I say and I pat the roof of her and walk towards momma's truck and climb in to the driver's seat. Storm helps buckle me up even though I can do it myself and he shuts the door. He steps back and directs me to reverse out of the garage.
Once a distance away, I press the fob to close the garage. I look at the house and sigh. I will be back soon, hopefully before my bean is born. I reverse onto the street and my dad is on his bike in front of me, Storm on my left, Snake on the right, and Dagger behind me. I follow my dad. I turn on the stereo and sing along to the music that is playing Post Malone and Morgan Wallen. I Had Some Help. Momma and I love Morgan Wallen and Post Malone.
I sing to the lyrics, tapping my hands on the steering wheel, and can see my momma as we both sing and bum shuffle in our seats, doing little dances. I smile. So many happy memories with her.
The sun is bright in the sky as I follow behind my dad. I sing loudly and nod my head along to the song, shrugging my shoulders. I turn my head and see Storm watching me. He is waving his hands in the air as he rides, and I chuckle at him. He is crazy. I look to the right and see Snake doing the Vogue moves by his face. Nutters.
After four days of driving, sleeping in crappy motels, and eating junk food. We finally pull into what looks like a parking lot with bikes parked up front. There is a working garage. Men and women are either working or lazing around.
I park the truck and shut off the engine. My heart is beating loudly as I look at the building. The men and woman all stand and look towards the truck. I gulp. Not liking this one bit.
My dad walks to my side and opens the door.
""Welcome home, princess."" He says and I look at him and then back at the growing crowd.
He offers me his hand, and I ignore it and climb down by myself. My hand goes to my bump, and he walks with me side by side. I look at the people here and I can hear whispers.
""She looks like Caitlyn.""
""He found her. The crazy prick found her.""
I walk through the doors and there are a lot of people here. Men and woman all drinking and having a good time.
""Listen up everyone. This is my daughter Courtney Nevaeh Morrison. She is the rightful princess of this club. You will all show her respect. Today is still a day of mourning, but also a day of celebration. We will remember Caitlyn and we will celebrate the return of our daughter. Your princess. CHEERS!"" my dad shouts and the room erupts in cheers. I was not expecting this.
People come and offer me their condolences and the ole ladies hug me and compliment me on my beauty.
The party is in full swing and I'm so overwhelmed. They all seem like nice people, even dad.
The club house doors open and I hear it, the voice I never will forget.
""DADDY!"" I see her as she runs on sky high heels towards ... My dad. Oh, no! she isn't, no chance. That hoe is my ... I throw up a little. She is my sister?!
I stiffen as she hugs him and a man hugs her. But it's not her I'm looking at.
It's the man who is stuck in a trance, looking from my eyes to my bump. The one I thought loved me the same way I loved him.

Ive had bloating and gerd symptoms for the last 3-4 years. Ive lost a ton of weight and like to think im healthy but it seems my stomach is very sensitive still. Everything has been fine for 4 months or so but I decided to dip for a couple months while I knocked out a big car project. Ive wrapped up the project and therefor stopped dipping but my stomach is still sour. Its sore in the mornings and it seems im easily bloated. Coffee in the AM (almost no caffine, I do half decaff and half half-caff) makes my stomach upset, sometimes slight puke vomit feelings. Ive only had maybe 8 drinks all year so far, probably doesnt help. My poos always seem loose, and sometimes spicy when I have this pain.

This has been on and off and has triggered with different things, I think the coffee and nicotine mixture messes my gut up now. Even 2 weeks after no dip and trying to limit coffee my stomach is still sensitive.

I think its time I go in and get a endoscopy just to be safe. The pain always feels like its from my lower stomach. Ive even had some sharp pain from my appendix area.

Has anyone had a similar experience? I started taking famotidine 6 or so months ago which has eliminated most of my gerd symptoms. I take it every morning.

I've drank and dipped tobacco since I was 16. The tobacco I would go on and off after I was 20. If I dip, its one or two a day max. I can quit cold turkey pretty easy since I dont like the effects of nicotine. I would say out of the last 10 years Ive dipped 4 of them and even then maybe a can every 2 weeks max. Now for drinking, I used to drink heavily from 18 to 25 then I started slowing down. Now its once in awhile. I noticed that if I pick up a can of dip, I get a sour stomach after about a week. I do dip when I drink coffee so probably makes it even worse.",1,1742909552.0,stomachcancer,0,1.0,False

It could be a minor news story from a random town that blows up, or the recasting of some beloved character in a movie IP. There really is no bottom to the conservative demand for this issue.

But one of the main talking points associated with the trans debate is that its being ""shoved down their throats."" That conservatives don't want to debate trans issues, it's just been foisted upon to them and they are just reacting.

But I rarely ever see liberals discuss trans issues, and if they do, there isn't a lot of fervor behind it.

Democrats barely mention it in their campaigns. Republicans had to go back to a DNC questionnaire from 2019 to attack Kamala Harris for it.

Some movies and TV shows occasionally have gender fluid or trans characters, but I only see that in like 10% of the media I consume and half the time it's not a major plot point.

I was in grad school recently and I expected a huge cringe progressive wave to drown me, and in many ways it did, but it was focused mostly on race.

A huge volume of liberal online spaces dedicate more page space to Trump fucking up institutions and immigrants than to anything related to trans people.

The liberals I know IRL, my friends, we pretty much never discuss trans issues at all.

The few times I've run into a visibly trans person IRL, they've been completely normal people who want to talk about Wheel of Time or coffee.",26,1742909442.0,centrist,72,0.68,False

I found them too mild and I wanted something stronger. But after 10 years of smoking, I've come to appreciate the subtle flavors of a Connecticut cigar, especially the nuances and the details in each part of it. There are still CT trends I don't like, which include very mild and relatively flat cigars. But the new CT wave of medium-high strength cigars with a CT wrapper is something I love: Henry Clay War Hawk, FQ Phenom No. 1, Powstanie CT, Joya de Nicaragua Anta√±o CT, to name a few. 

That led me to the **Brib√≥n Connecticut,** a cigar made in Colombia with an Ecuadorian Habano wrapper. Maybe not as different from a mild CT, but much more complex. Classic flavors of leather, hay, nuts and coffee, which in themselves are not a big deal. But I paired it with what remained of a **Zacapa XO** bottle I was gifted last year. 

The rum is mild and expensive, and for someone who knows a bit about rum, it can be a turn off, especially if you've already tried the Zacapa 23. The XO costs about double what the 23 is, but it's not twice as good... even if you don't consider the 23 good (and you can count me in that too). But the rum was in my cabinet and there was little left, and it was a mild cigar, so I thought why not. 

The result was a great pairing, as the rum had similar but sweeter flavors, and also included some fruit notes of banana and pineapple. I don't think I'll repeat the pairing, mostly because I'm not about to spend $100+ on a bottle of rum I didn't enjoy. But the Brib√≥n I'll have again. ",2,1742909070.0,EveryDayIsCigarDay,0,1.0,False

We are both married, so there is nothing between us; we are like brother and sister. Two years ago, a new lady joined the company. She's always been the quiet type and had a best friend here but never interacted with anyone else. She is very self-confident and has an arrogant attitude, so she is not too likable. I never spoke a word to her in those two years, and she never said hello to me either. We work in different teams and had no reason to interact.

We had to attend a team-building event three months ago. We went to a seaside resort and stayed overnight. We had dinner and a party, and my friend got very, very drunk. He spoke to a lot of people and doesn't remember much about it, but it seems he spoke to this lady a lot. They have a few things in common and they clicked that day. After that, he distanced himself from me for a couple of weeks. I was hurt, but I accepted it. It was the first time in 10 years that he actually wanted the company of another person during his breaks, so I assumed he needed a fresh start or a change. I didn't want to look like a clingy, needy friend, so I hung out with other people as well.

All of a sudden, this lady started talking to me and inviting me on coffee breaks. She basically became my shadow. My friend had to put some distance between them as he thinks she misunderstood his interaction with her at the party and now wants something else from him. The more distance he puts between them and the more he talks to me, the more she wants to be with me as well. I'm not stupid, and I know that the only reason she talks to me is because I'm the connection she has with our common friend. It's so silly, considering we are all in our 40s.

The problem is, she has started lying to him to make him like her. She lies about her hobbies and lies to me about her personal life (for instance, she said she has no siblings, then the next day that she has a half-sister, and the next day she says she has two sisters). She seems desperate to get back her connection with him, and it is affecting my friendship with him. He wants to eat lunch with me, but she comes along. We are having coffee, and all of a sudden, she appears out of nowhere. She seems to know where he is at every moment, and it's creepy.

This is a big corporation where they highly value personal relationships between people and want us all to be friends, so I can't stop talking to her or reject her invitations for lunch. She is ruining my friendship with him and other people as well, and I don't know how to handle this. She is extremely toxic, always badmouthing others, and she hugs everyone, which is very uncomfortable for me (I value my personal space).

How would you deal with her? I don't want to lose my friend, and he doesn't know what to do about her either. We can't tell her not to join us for lunch or coffee.",1,1742908991.0,WorkAdvice,7,0.67,False

There are still CT trends I don't like, which include very mild and relatively flat cigars.

*Day-by-day: Reparenting yourself with fun, discipline, love and hope.*

**Strategic Empowerment Guide for the Unparented**

Growing up in abusive, overprotected, or neglectful environments can leave you feeling overly trusting, passive, or unsure how to assert yourself. The good news is that strategic thinking, assertiveness, and social influence are skills you can learn. This step-by-step guide will help you recognize manipulation, project confidence, and take control of social dynamics ‚Äì without becoming cruel or deceptive. Each section includes practical exercises and examples so you can take action and build a mindset that commands respect.

**Step 1: Recognize & Counter Manipulation Techniques**

Manipulators often treat others like puppets on strings, exploiting trust and vulnerabilities. People raised in abusive or sheltered homes are often na√Øve, over-giving, or conflict-averse, which can make them prime targets. The first step to empowerment is learning to spot manipulation tactics and respond strategically instead of getting pulled by the strings.

Common Manipulation Tactics to Watch For:¬†

Manipulation is any coercive or unethical behavior intended to control or exploit you for someone‚Äôs personal gain. Be alert for tactics such as:

‚Ä¢ Guilt-Tripping: They try to make you feel responsible for their feelings or indebted for past help (e.g. ‚ÄúAfter all I‚Äôve done for you‚Ä¶‚Äù). This leverages your conscience against you.

‚Ä¢ Gaslighting: They deny facts or twist your words to make you doubt your sanity or memory, causing you to question your own reality .

‚Ä¢ Flattery & Love-Bombing: Over-the-top compliments, gifts, or affection used to lower your guard and create a sense of obligation . Later, the warmth may vanish, leaving you chasing their approval.

‚Ä¢ Passive Aggression: Indirect hostility like the silent treatment, backhanded compliments, or ‚Äújoking‚Äù insults that undermine you.

‚Ä¢ Moving the Goalposts: Constantly changing demands or standards so you never feel ‚Äúgood enough,‚Äù keeping you anxious and compliant.

‚Ä¢ Triangulation: Drawing a third party into conflicts or communications to isolate or pressure you (e.g. ‚ÄúEven so-and-soagrees you‚Äôre wrong‚Äù).

How to Counter Manipulation:¬†

Once you recognize a manipulative tactic, pause and take back control of your response. Use these strategies to protect yourself:

1. Stay Calm and Detached: Do not react emotionally or get defensive right away. Manipulators want to rattle you. Keep your cool so you can respond thoughtfully . Take a deep breath and remind yourself that their behavior is about their issues, not yours . This mental detachment (sometimes called depersonalizing) helps you resist taking the bait.

2. Name the Tactic (Internally or Out Loud): Silently acknowledge ‚ÄúThis is a guilt trip‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm being gaslighted.‚Äù If appropriate, assertively call it out: e.g., ‚ÄúI sense you‚Äôre trying to make me feel guilty, and I won‚Äôt accept that.‚Äù Simply naming it can disarm the manipulator, as they realize you see through it.

3. Set Clear Boundaries: Calmly assert your boundaries when someone oversteps . For example: ‚ÄúI value honesty, so I need you to stop denying what happened,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not okay with being spoken to that way.‚Äù Use ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements to express how their behavior affects you and what you expect going forward. Be firm but civil.

4. Don‚Äôt Chase Approval or Over-Explain: Manipulators often flip situations to make you seek their approval or doubt yourself. Stand your ground. You don‚Äôt owe lengthy excuses for saying no or disagreeing. A simple, confident statement of your stance is enough. For instance, if pressured by a sob story to lend money, you might respond, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre in a tough spot, but I‚Äôm not able to help with that.‚Äù No excessive apologies; hold the line.

5. Limit Engagement or Remove Yourself: If the manipulation persists, gracefully end the interaction. Change the subject, physically leave, or minimize contact, especially if it‚Äôs a repeated pattern. Reducing the manipulator‚Äôs ‚Äúaudience‚Äù (you) deprives them of power. In extreme cases (ongoing abuse), consider seeking support from a counselor or authority on safely distancing yourself .

Practice Exercise ‚Äì Identify and Respond: Think of a past situation where you left feeling used, guilty, or confused. Write down any phrases or behaviors from the other person that now seem manipulative (e.g. ‚ÄúIf you really loved me, you‚Äôd do this for me‚Äù). Identify which tactic(s) these were. Re-script your response: How could you have replied or set a boundary? For example, for a guilt-trip scenario, you might script: ‚ÄúI understand you‚Äôre upset, but I won‚Äôt be made to feel guilty for sticking to my decision.‚Äù Practicing this in writing (or role-playing with a friend) will build muscle memory to counter such tactics in the future.

**Step 2: Develop a Commanding Presence That Earns Respect**

People who grew up being belittled or overprotected often carry themselves in a timid way ‚Äì slumped posture, avoiding eye contact, hesitant speech ‚Äì which unfortunately attracts disrespect or further bullying. To change how others treat you, change the signals you send. Research shows that confident body language makes others pay attention and take you seriously. By adopting a commanding presence, you teach people to respect you before you even say a word.

Key Elements of Confident Body Language:

‚Ä¢ Posture ‚Äì Stand Tall: Keep your back straight, shoulders back and relaxed, and chest open (imagine a string lifting you from the top of your head). Avoid slouching or shuffling. An upright posture immediately makes you look more confident and in control . Try the ‚Äúpower pose‚Äù exercise: stand like a superhero (legs apart, hands on hips or arms wide) for two minutes in private. It can actually boost feelings of confidence by lowering stress hormones.

‚Ä¢ Eye Contact: Don‚Äôt dart your eyes to the floor or ceiling when talking. Look people in the eye around 60% of the time . Eye contact shows you‚Äôre engaged and unafraid. If direct eye contact feels hard, start by looking at the bridge of the person‚Äôs nose or their forehead ‚Äì it almost looks like eye contact and gets you comfortable. Practice with yourself in a mirror: can you maintain a steady, calm gaze?

‚Ä¢ Hand Gestures and Stillness: Use your hands to emphasize points (not nervously fidgeting). Confident people gesture deliberately and then return hands to a relaxed position. Avoid wringing your hands, touching your face, or tapping your feet ‚Äì those signal anxiety. Keep movements controlled and purposeful, which conveys self-assurance. (Tip: If you have excess nervous energy, channel it by squeezing a stress ball or pressing your fingertips together out of view.)

‚Ä¢ Facial Expression & Voice: Maintain a neutral or pleasant expression. It‚Äôs okay to smile when greeting, but in serious discussions, constant nervous smiling can undermine your authority. Speak clearly and at a measured pace ‚Äì not too fast, which can signal insecurity, and not so slow that you seem unsure. Aim for a steady, audible tone. Check that your voice isn‚Äôt rising at the end of statements (which can make assertions sound like questions). Try lowering your tone slightly for weighty statements to project confidence.

‚Ä¢ Physical Presence: When entering a room or joining a group, don‚Äôt shrink. Walk in with purpose, with your head up and eyes forward (no looking at the ground) . Take space: if seated, avoid tucking your limbs in tightly; if standing, stand open (arms uncrossed) and at a comfortable distance. You want to signal ‚ÄúI have a right to be here.‚Äù Even if you feel insecure inside, ‚Äúfake it ‚Äôtil you make it‚Äù with confident externals ‚Äì your body can feedback to your mind, helping you actually feel more confident.

Example ‚Äì The Confident Introduction: Imagine meeting a new group or starting a job. A commanding presence from Day One can set the tone. Instead of hunching and waiting to be addressed, you might: walk up to the nearest person, make eye contact, smile politely, and say, ‚ÄúHello, I‚Äôm \[Name\]. It‚Äôs nice to meet you.‚Äù Offer a firm handshake if appropriate (firm, not crushing, and accompanied by eye contact). A confident greeting establishes you as assertive and respectful, encouraging others to respond in kind.

Adopting a confident stance ‚Äì head up, shoulders back, and a relaxed, poised posture ‚Äì immediately changes how people perceive you. They are more likely to see you as competent and respect your presence. Work on these nonverbal cues daily until they become second nature.

Practice Exercise ‚Äì Power Pose and Feedback: Every morning or before a high-stakes social interaction, strike a powerful pose privately (for instance, stand with arms stretched wide or fists on hips like Wonder Woman). Hold it for 2 minutes and breathe deeply. Notice the feeling ‚Äì a mix of awkwardness and growing boldness. After some social interactions (a meeting, a casual chat, etc.), write a quick journal entry: How did I carry myself? How did people react?If you maintained good posture and eye contact, did you sense a difference in their respect or attention? Over time, these reflections will reinforce the improvements in your demeanor.

**Step 3: Influence Social Interactions & Control the Dynamics**

Being strategic in social situations doesn‚Äôt mean being manipulative; it means being proactive and mindful about how interactions unfold. Instead of always reacting or following others‚Äô lead (a common habit if you grew up having to ‚Äúgo with the flow‚Äù of others), you can start steering conversations and relationships in ways that serve your interests andcreate mutual respect. In social groups and power dynamics, those who assert influence tend to gain respect, while constant followers can be overlooked or exploited.

Ways to Ethically Influence and Lead:

‚Ä¢ Take Initiative: Don‚Äôt wait for others to make decisions for you ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs choosing a restaurant, assigning roles on a team project, or planning a weekend activity with friends. Practice being the one who suggests ideas or solutions. For example, at work you might volunteer: ‚ÄúI have a suggestion for this problem‚Ä¶‚Äù or among friends: ‚ÄúHow about we try X this Saturday?‚Äù People often appreciate initiative, and it subtly positions you as a guide rather than a passive participant.

‚Ä¢ Guide the Conversation: Pay attention to the tone and direction of group discussions. If it‚Äôs going somewhere you don‚Äôt like or find unproductive, assertively redirect it. Use transitional phrases like, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one perspective. Another idea is‚Ä¶‚Äù or ask a pointed question to shift focus. If someone interrupts or talks over you (common for those used to not being heard), calmly say ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to finish my thought‚Äù and continue. By not ceding the floor, you train others to give you space in conversation.

‚Ä¢ Use Reciprocity: One of Cialdini‚Äôs key influence principles is reciprocity ‚Äì people feel obliged to return favors. You can build goodwill by genuinely helping others or giving small tokens of consideration without immediately asking for something back. For instance, lend a hand to a colleague with their task or remember a friend‚Äôs favorite coffee and surprise them with it. These create positive social debts. Later, when you need support or a favor, you‚Äôll likely find people are eager to reciprocate and help you. (Important: Do favors sincerely and selectively ‚Äì over-giving or doing so with blatant expectation can backfire).

‚Ä¢ Establish Yourself as a Resource/Authority: You don‚Äôt need formal power to wield influence; knowledge and competence are power. Develop expertise in areas relevant to your world ‚Äì maybe you become the go-to person for tech help in the office, or you‚Äôre the one who reads up on rental laws in your toxic apartment situation. When people see you have valuable information or skills, they will defer to you more in decisions (because you know what you‚Äôre talking about). Even displaying confident knowledge in small things ‚Äì speaking about your hobbies or sharing news insightfully ‚Äì can build your authority aura in everyday interactions. Authorities are naturally influential.

‚Ä¢ Build Alliances and Social Proof: Don‚Äôt go it alone if you want more sway. Befriend or seek alignment with individuals who are respected or hold influence in a group. If at work, form a good working relationship with team leaders or highly regarded coworkers. In friend groups, earn the trust of the most socially influential person. This isn‚Äôt about clique-y politics ‚Äì it‚Äôs about earning trust and showing loyalty so that when you voice an opinion, others back you up. Additionally, gather social proof for your ideas: e.g., ‚ÄúI checked with a few teammates and they also think this approach could work.‚Äù People are more likely to agree if they think others already do.

Example ‚Äì Steering a Group Decision: Suppose your friend group or coworkers are stuck or ignoring your needs. Maybe the friend group always picks activities you don‚Äôt enjoy, or your team is leaning toward a plan that overlooks your perspective. Instead of silently acquiescing, try this: Initiate by saying, ‚ÄúHey, can I propose something?‚Äù (This grabs attention). Then assert your idea: ‚ÄúI know we usually do X, but I‚Äôd love if we could try Y this time. It could be fun for everyone because‚Ä¶‚Äù. By proposing confidently and highlighting mutual benefits, you‚Äôve taken control of the dynamic in a positive way. Even if the group doesn‚Äôt go with your idea this time, you‚Äôve signaled that you expect to be heard and that you bring ideas to the table. Over time, people will start asking your opinion more proactively.

Practice Exercise ‚Äì The 1-1-1 Rule: To ease into influencing, use the 1-1-1 rule in your daily life for the next week: In at least 1 conversation each day, take 1 initiative and assert at least 1 preference. This could be as simple as picking the meeting time (‚ÄúHow about we meet at 3 PM?‚Äù), expressing a differing opinion (‚ÄúActually, I see it a bit differently‚Ä¶‚Äù followed by your view), or guiding a plan (‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do A first, then B‚Äù). Write down each instance and the outcome. Did others agree? Did anyone push back? You‚Äôll find that more often than not, people are fine with being led as long as you‚Äôre respectful. Reflect on what felt comfortable or scary, and gradually up the ante (e.g., from suggesting where to eat to negotiating a raise at work) as your confidence grows.

**Step 4: Leverage Psychological Principles to Navigate Power Structures**

Navigating power dynamics in social or professional settings can feel like walking into an invisible maze. But psychology gives us a map of the maze! By understanding a few key principles of influence and group behavior, you can read situations and subtly shape them to your advantage. Think of this as learning the ‚Äúrules of the game‚Äù of social power so you can play it wisely (instead of being an unwitting pawn).

Understand Hierarchies and Roles: Human groups, whether we like it or not, often have unspoken hierarchies. This hierarchy might be based on formal authority (a boss vs. an employee), but also on confidence, charisma, or expertise. Start observing who people listen to or defer to in different settings. Notice body language and communication patterns: Who interrupts whom? Who gets consulted for decisions? This isn‚Äôt to envy or resent those individuals, but to learn what traits or behaviors earn that status. Often it‚Äôs those who are assertive, provide value, and stay calm under pressure. Emulate positive aspects of those high-status behaviors (without losing your authenticity). Also, identify if youautomatically defer to others unnecessarily ‚Äì challenge yourself to sometimes hold your ground instead of defaulting to a lower rung.

Key Influence Principles: Psychologist Robert Cialdini outlined powerful universal principles of persuasion that you can ethically apply:

‚Ä¢ Reciprocity: (We covered this ‚Äì give and take.) People tend to return favors. Use this by being generous first, as discussed in Step 3.

‚Ä¢ Commitment & Consistency: People want to appear consistent in their actions and commitments. If you want someone‚Äôs cooperation, get a small ‚Äúyes‚Äù first. For example, if you need a big favor, start with a small request a person can easily agree to (the ‚Äúfoot in the door‚Äù technique). They‚Äôll be more likely to say yes to the larger request later to stay consistent with their earlier commitment. Conversely, be aware of this if others try it on you ‚Äì saying yes to coffee doesn‚Äôt oblige you to say yes to lending money next, for instance.

‚Ä¢ Social Proof (Consensus): We look to what others are doing to decide what we should do. In a meeting, if you need support for your idea, you might mention that ‚ÄúSeveral team members have expressed excitement about this approach‚Äù (but only if true ‚Äì remember, we‚Äôre not advocating lying). Similarly, be cautious of going along with something just because ‚Äúeveryone thinks it‚Äôs okay‚Äù ‚Äì manipulators often exploit herd mentality. Pause and think for yourself.

‚Ä¢ Liking: We are more easily influenced by people we like or feel connected to. Building genuine rapport and finding common ground with others increases your influence. Even something simple like matching someone‚Äôs communication style or finding shared interests can make them warm up to you. (This is different from people-pleasing; it‚Äôs about affinity, not bending over backwards.) Use liking by showing liking: give sincere compliments, show interest in others‚Äô lives, and smile when appropriate. Just beware of excessive charm from others ‚Äì remember, flattery can be a manipulation tool .

‚Ä¢ Authority: We tend to obey or defer to those who appear authoritative or expert. You can project authority by looking the part (dressing appropriately, good posture as in Step 2), speaking with assurance, and citing valid knowledge or experience when you have it (‚ÄúIn my X years doing this, I‚Äôve found‚Ä¶‚Äù). Even something small like referencing a credible source in conversation (‚ÄúI read a study that‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúAccording to \[expert\]‚Ä¶‚Äù) can lend weight to your points. Just be careful to question authority when you‚Äôre on the receiving end ‚Äì titles and confidence can be used to mislead, so evaluate the substance of what an ‚Äúauthority‚Äù figure says, not just their status.

‚Ä¢ Scarcity: People value things that are scarce. You can apply this by not always being too available or eager, which can unfortunately be taken for granted. Set your availability on your terms. For instance, instead of jumping to respond to a disrespectful friend‚Äôs call at 2 AM, wait until a reasonable time ‚Äì subtly signaling your time is valuable. In negotiations, you might say, ‚ÄúI have limited time, so let‚Äôs focus on reaching an agreement,‚Äù which presses urgency. Scarcity also means being willing to walk away from offers or people that don‚Äôt meet your needs ‚Äì often, that‚Äôs when they realize your worth. (E.g., being ready to quit a job if boundaries are violated can sometimes shock an employer into treating you better.)

Emotional Intelligence & ‚ÄúReading the Room‚Äù: Knowledge of influence principles must pair with emotional intelligence ‚Äì the ability to read and manage emotions (yours and others‚Äô). Pay attention to nonverbal cues: are you boring someone, upsetting them, intimidating them? Effective power-wielders adjust their approach based on feedback. For instance, if you notice a colleague withdraw when you speak firmly, you might soften your tone to keep their alliance; if a manipulator smirks when you concede, note that and stand firmer next time. Emotional intelligence helps you know when to push, when to yield, and when to just listen.

Example ‚Äì Navigating Workplace Power: You‚Äôre in a meeting and your boss (formal authority) is present, as well as an outspoken coworker who isn‚Äôt the boss but has clout (informal authority). You have an idea that you believe in but worry about stepping on toes. A strategic approach might be: before the meeting, mention your idea to that influential coworker casually and get their feedback (leveraging liking and consensus by gaining an ally). In the meeting, when the topic arises, you say, ‚ÄúI was speaking with \[Coworker\] earlier and we thought maybe \[your idea\] could work well, because ‚Ä¶.‚Äù Now you‚Äôve combined social proof (implying support), a bit of authority (showing you‚Äôve done pre-discussions), and initiative. If the boss hesitates, you could add a touch of scarcity: ‚ÄúI know time is limited, but perhaps we can pilot this approach for a month ‚Äì it might be a rare opportunity to get ahead of our competitor.‚Äù You‚Äôve framed it as low-risk and urgent. This layered influence often makes your proposal compelling. Regardless of the outcome, you‚Äôve showcased yourself as a strategic thinker in the group.

Practice Exercise ‚Äì Influence in Action Journal: Each day, identify one interaction where you want a certain outcome (big or small ‚Äì e.g., getting your sibling to help with chores, convincing your professor to extend a deadline, or simply getting a refund from customer service). Plan it using 1-2 principles above. For instance, if asking for a deadline extension: you might use commitment (‚ÄúI‚Äôve completed 70% of the project and I‚Äôm committed to delivering quality work‚Ä¶‚Äù) and liking (‚ÄúI really appreciate how understanding you‚Äôve been in this class, which is why I feel comfortable asking‚Ä¶‚Äù). Execute your plan, then record what happened. Did the principle seem to work? How did the person react? Not every attempt will succeed (people are not robots), but over time you‚Äôll refine a toolbox of tactics that fit your style and conscience.

**Step 5: Recondition Your Mindset from Passive to Strategic**

Finally, the most important change has to happen internally. Your upbringing may have instilled a mental script of passivity: maybe you feel selfish for putting yourself first, or you fear conflict like it‚Äôs life-or-death, or you just doubt your own judgment. Reconditioning your mind means rewriting those scripts. You can be self-serving in a healthy way ‚Äì valuing your needs and goals ‚Äì while still being a good person. This step is about cultivating a mindset of confident, strategic self-interest instead of naive trust or martyrdom.

Adopt Your Personal Bill of Rights: You might never have been taught that you have rights in relationships. Internalize that you have the right to your own needs, boundaries, and choices. For example, ‚ÄúI have the right to say no without feeling guilty‚Äù and ‚ÄúI have the right to be treated with respect‚Äù are fundamental truths. In fact, a Personal Bill of Rights developed in therapy circles includes these and more: the right to ask for what you need, to make mistakes, to choose your priorities, and not to be responsible for others‚Äô problems. Write down a list of your rights (use the ones above to start). Keep it where you‚Äôll see it daily and repeat them to yourself. This builds an inner conviction that you deserve to take up space and won‚Äôt tolerate violation of your basics.

Shift Your Inner Voice: Abuse and neglect often plant a harsh or doubting inner voice (e.g. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll mess up if you try to lead‚Äù or ‚ÄúKeeping quiet keeps you safe‚Äù). Start noticing when that voice speaks. Challenge it as if you were defending a friend: Is it really true that I‚Äôll mess up? Even if I‚Äôm not perfect, I can learn. Replace overly trusting thoughts too: instead of ‚ÄúEveryone has good intentions,‚Äù a more strategic belief is ‚ÄúSome people act in their own interest; I should see what their actions show me.‚Äù This doesn‚Äôt mean becoming paranoid ‚Äì it means fact-checking people‚Äôs words against their behavior. If someone repeatedly crosses your boundaries, your strategic mind says ‚ÄúI must enforce consequences or distance, because expecting them to change on their own is unrealistic.‚Äù Train yourself to think two steps ahead: ask ‚ÄúIf I do X, how might others react, and how could I handle that?‚Äù This anticipation is the heart of strategic thinking, versus the old reactive mindset.

Heal Trauma Responses: Recognize if you have any ingrained trauma-driven behaviors like people-pleasing (fawning), freezing up, or excessive compliance. These often served you in a toxic environment but now hinder your growth. Reconditioning involves gradual exposure to new behaviors. For a chronic people-pleaser, that means deliberately saying ‚Äúno‚Äù in low-stakes situations to build tolerance for others‚Äô mild disappointment. You might feel intense anxiety or guilt the first few times ‚Äì that‚Äôs normal. Ride it out and you‚Äôll discover the fear of backlash is often worse than reality. Each successful assertion rewires your brain, proving that standing up for yourself is safe and even rewarding. If the trauma responses are very strong (like panic or dissociation when you assert yourself), consider working with a therapist on specific strategies ‚Äì therapy can greatly accelerate the reconditioning process by providing support and new tools.

Stay Ethical but Firm: As you become more strategic, you might occasionally question, ‚ÄúAm I being manipulative?‚Äù Remember, there‚Äôs a difference between healthy self-interest and cruelty. You‚Äôre simply claiming equal respect ‚Äì not bullying others. True assertiveness respects others‚Äô rights and your own. You can be kind and assertive simultaneously. For example, you can be empathetic to someone‚Äôs feelings while still saying no to their request. Aim for win-win situations when possible, but know that ‚Äúwin-win‚Äù includes you winning too ‚Äì not you always sacrificing. It‚Äôs okay if not everyone is happy with your choices; what matters is you acted with integrity and reasonable fairness.

Example ‚Äì From Passive to Strategic in Action: Let‚Äôs say you always went along with what your romantic partner wanted because you feared conflict, but you felt miserable inside. A reconditioned, strategic you would start small: you might say, ‚ÄúActually, I‚Äôd prefer to stay in tonight rather than go out. I‚Äôve had a long week.‚Äù This is a low-risk assertion of preference. If your partner pushes back or guilt-trips (‚ÄúCome on, don‚Äôt be boring‚Äù), old you would cave. New you holds steady: ‚ÄúI understand you‚Äôre excited to go out. I‚Äôm just really in need of rest. You can go without me, or we plan something tomorrow together.‚Äù This response shows you‚Äôre prioritizing self-care and giving options ‚Äì that‚Äôs strategic and assertive. Over time, if your partner respects these boundaries, great ‚Äì the relationship becomes healthier. If they don‚Äôt (some manipulators won‚Äôt), strategic you recognizes this as a red flag to possibly exit the relationship rather than endure endless exploitation. The key shift is you‚Äôre no longer acting out of fear or blind trust; you‚Äôre making calculated choices that honor your well-being.

Practice Exercise ‚Äì Daily Debrief and Self-Correction: Each evening, reflect on the day and identify one situation where you fell back into passive or naive behavior. Maybe you nodded along when you disagreed, or didn‚Äôt speak up when someone cut in line. Without judgment, visualize yourself handling it the strategic way. What could you have said or done? Re-play it in your mind or jot it down. Then also identify one win ‚Äì a moment you did assert yourself or think strategically. Celebrate that win, no matter how small (‚ÄúI told my friend I only had 30 minutes to talk, which respected my time!‚Äù). This daily practice cements your learning. Over weeks, you‚Äôll notice the ‚Äúmissed opportunities‚Äù for assertiveness decrease as the strategic responses become your new default.

\-

By following these steps, you will gradually transform from feeling like a victim of circumstance into a confident navigator of social life. Remember, this is a journey ‚Äì you‚Äôll slip up and have days where you fall back into old habits, but each time you practice these skills, you‚Äôre strengthening new mental muscles. Strategic thinking and assertiveness are like a personal shield and compass: they protect you from users and abusers, and guide you toward relationships and situations that uplift you.

Most importantly, you can grow strong without becoming the very thing you hated. You don‚Äôt need to lie, bully, or exploit to get respect. True strength is calm, fair, and self-assured. As you assert your needs and exercise influence with empathy, people will notice the change. The ones who thrived on your weakness may resist or fall away ‚Äì let them. You‚Äôre building a new circle around you that respects the real, powerful you. Keep reinforcing your rights, stand tall, and never forget that you deserve every bit of the respect you command.

A high-performing PPC campaign driving immediate traffic while your well-optimized SEO ensures lasting visibility.

¬†Together, they‚Äôre a powerhouse duo that can elevate your product rankings, attract more customers, and maximize ROI.

Whether you‚Äôre an established Amazon FBA seller or a newcomer, understanding the right PPC-to-SEO ratio is your secret weapon to dominating search results and converting clicks into sales. In this guide, we‚Äôll explore how syncing these two essential strategies can boost your Amazon success like never before.

*Explore More:*¬†[*3 Ways to Measure the Performance of your Amazon PPC Ads*](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/3-ways-to-measure-the-performance-of-your-amazon-ppc-ads/)

# Immediate Visibility Through PPC Campaigns

PPC campaigns are especially helpful when a new product is introduced to Amazon since it can target the desired population instantly as opposed to waiting for it to be found in the sea of constrained traffic that may not purchase anyway due to its limited feedback and reviews.¬†

New products for instance face a lot of challenges, initially have low ranking value when it comes to search, and hence lots of competition from well-established brands. The PPC ad places the product strategically where targeted customers are in the search results and gets to them on time.

* For instance, an¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†seller who is selling a fitness tracker will post specific keywords such as ‚Äòcheap fitness tracker‚Äô under PPC ads. This makes the product to be among the first to be seen once the search is done hence attracts the buyers.¬†

# The idea of Long Term Sustainability with SEO

SEO provides an effective tool for staying relevant on the site for a long time after PPC campaigns have finally exhausted their potential.¬†

Learning from the defunct free-for-all ad war, most Amazon FBA sellers have adopted the use of keywords such as in product title, bullets, descriptions, and relevant back-end searches to enhance organic ranking.¬†

* For instance, an Amazon FBA seller with a product ‚ÄúMulti-functional vegetable slicer‚Äù. So, if it is associated with such text as ‚Äòtime-saving kitchen tools‚Äô or ‚Äòthe best vegetable slicer for salads‚Äô, it will be continuously presented at the top of articles with those words.¬†

In the long run this constant exposure means constant flow of traffic and sales without having to spend more on adverts.

The need for SEO increases even more by 2025, considering the increasing ad expenses around that time. Because of the impact of inflation in PPC budgets, those¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers who do not utilize SEO subject themselves to essentially unmanageable advertising costs.¬†

Additionally, the targeted search results provided by AWS in the form of the A9 algorithm filters promote well-optimized listings more and more and thereby make SEO an essential part of an Amazon FBA seller‚Äôs success plan.

# Towards Better ACoS with Synergy Amazon FBA

ACoS is the most important yardstick regarding the effectiveness of¬†[PPC campaigns](https://medium.com/@begom37641/ppc-campaigns-can-be-highly-effective-but-they-also-suffer-from-a-variety-of-problems-that-can-21922ffa2b5e). For those who intend to combine PPC with SEO, the ACoS of their products will be cut down in the course of the business, which will help in increasing the overall revenue return on investment.

¬†Enhanced product that helps speed up the pay per click advertisements so that the clicks through rates as well as the conversion rates are higher yet the number of unproductive or unnecessary advertisements is lower.

* For instance, suppose the¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†seller is interested in bidding on the PPC ad section to appear in searches next to the term ‚Äòorganic baby shampoo‚Äô. If the keyword is used both to create a category listing and to optimize that listing, it is a smooth transition for the customers.¬†

The next shoppers clicking on the ad will see a listing that contains ideal keywords and branding descriptions, or benefits including ‚Äògentle on sensitive skin‚Äô or ‚Äòno harsh chemicals‚Äô. This alignment enhances the probability of conversions; this makes each of the ads clicked to be more valuable.

By 2025, competition shall also increase, and the costs of ads shall be even higher, meaning that controlling ACoS will be twice as important.¬†

# Brand Credibility Through Review

Reviews are the basis for amazon‚Äôs success and PPC supports the creation of these reviews especially during the start of a product.

¬†Sites having healthy reviews not only improve visibility but also tend to draw more organic traffic as well as conversions. Always, using PPC with SEO means that the reviews can support both, paid and organic results.

* For example, the¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†seller who released noise-canceling headphones will leverage PPC to obtain 50 first sets of headphones. Some of these sales can be used to gather reviews which make the listing more trustworthy and more conspicuous.¬†

It means that Additional keywords such as ‚Äù the best noise-canceling headphones‚Äù can then be part of the SEO strategy to keep the product competitive in organic search results.

And as the trend of consumers turning to reviews to guide them in their purchase decisions intensify in 2025, Amazon FBA Amazon FBA sellers need to accrue a good review profile. Consumers even sort the product list results with a specific attribute of the product such as high rating and number of reviews.

¬†Sales through PPC give the much needed early push to meet such criteria while search engine optimization keeps the product in front of the buyer.

# Identifying High-Performing Keywords

Through PPC campaigns, brands get useful insights on timely customer perceptions as well as popularity of certain¬†[Amazon keywords](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/5-things-you-need-to-know-to-master-amazon-keywords/). Thanks to such analytics, the Amazon FBA sellers themselves can see which keywords have the best CTR and, therefore, the greatest conversion rates.¬†

Such insights generate a loop by which Amazon FBA Amazon FBA Amazon FBA sellers are able to enhance existing SEO techniques with improved keywords that are incorporated within their product offers.

* For example, an Amazon FBA seller targeting vegeans using PPC and selling ‚Äúvegan protein powder‚Äù may have stumbled upon a fact that the keyword like ‚Äúplant-based protein for sportsmen‚Äù brings great conversion.

¬†It can be used in the product title, bullet points, and in the description where the title was included to rank organically. This makes the listing to be perceived by more potential buyers who are in the search for the same products.

Data viewership as a critical success factor to Amazon‚Äôs Amazon FBA sellers in 2025. The ability to receive the keyword performance data of PPC campaigns also helps the Amazon FBA sellers make a smart choice for the TOP placement of the listings.¬†

Those Amazon FBA sellers who take advantage of this information will have a better stand as compared to the¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers who will try to guess.

# ¬†Constructing Seasonal and Trend-Based Sales

In my conception, it is important to maximize revenues during consumption high seasons or when trends dictate so through both¬†[Amazon PPC](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-ppc-all-you-need-to-know-about-amazon-ppc/)¬†and Amazon SEO.¬†

Since PPC brings campaigns to the target audience‚Äôs view immediately, they are especially effective at higher traffic periods during trend increases, whereas SEO guarantees constant traffic periods.

* For instance, an¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†seller of holiday gift boxes can use PPC advertising and post the ad each in the search engine under keywords such as Christmas gifts during the months of November and December separately.

¬†These ads generate traffic and sales in the shortest time possible so that the Amazon FBA seller can make the best out of the holiday season. At the same time, the Amazon FBA seller can fine tune the keywords and phrases which can be something more neutral like ‚Äúgift boxes‚Äù for customers who may need them at any time of the year.

By 2025, growth in demand and relevance of seasonal purchases and purchase driven by trends, requires¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers to adjust to its corresponding fluctuating demands.¬†

PPC enables the Amazon FBA sellers to respond to new trends or high seasons as compared to SEO that focuses on the foundation of long-term visibility. These two tactical strategies help Amazon FBA sellers to create constant sales regardless of the nature of the market.

# Competing in Saturated Niches

Saturated niches on Amazon means that when a niche is very competitive Amazon FBA sellers end up incurring high ad costs and it becomes hard to make a difference.¬†

This makes the complete reliance on PPC unsustainable in such environments though competent SEO strategy minimizes on paid ads to achieve sustainable competitiveness.

* Let us take, for example, an Amazon¬†**FBA**¬†seller in the beauty niche selling an ‚ÄòAnti-aging serum for sensitive skin‚Äô. First, the Amazon FBA seller might apply PPC campaigns to gain traffic and attract clients to its Internet site.¬†

However, in order to cut down the headline advertisement cost in future, the Amazon FBA seller concentrates on Search Engine Optimization. This explains how the product gains organic traffic and conversions by being optimised with poetic language, keyword descriptions and¬†**listing images.**

When it comes to the year 2025, self-Amazon FBA sellers operating within competitive markets cannot afford to incur much costs on selling their products.¬†

Moreover it makes other campaigns such as PPC more effective because it guarantees that optimized listings will convert better.

¬†If a customer submits his/her query and gets a PPC ad and a listing presenting a well-coordinated offer, a buy is most likely. It also serves to drive up the sales while, at the same time increasing the effectiveness of¬†[PPC ads.](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/3-ways-to-measure-the-performance-of-your-amazon-ppc-ads/)

# ¬†Customer Retention and Loyalty the Strategies

It is essential to retain customers and be loyal to amazon and the best method of achieving this is by using both PPC and SEO techniques.¬†

While PPC targets those potential consumers who directly enter into the market through searching for particular products, SEO guarantees that the product stays relevant and easily found when consumers return for more.

* For example, a subscription¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†seller who provides coffee delivery services will possibly employ PPC to keywords such as ‚Äú best coffee subscription.‚Äù These ads create a market for new users, first-time users to the product, and create brand awareness.¬†

At the same time, the Amazon FBA seller reallocates resources and targets keywords such as ‚Äúmonthly coffee delivery ‚Äòand detailed descriptions that will appeal to the recipient. This helps the customers to easily locate the product and make their orders again When customers plan to buy the same product again.

The probability by which customer acquisition costs will exceed the costs of retaining the existing ones will increase in 2025. Consumers are inclined to continue purchasing from brands that help make the process frictionless, and that‚Äôs where optimized listings stand out.¬†

By opening access to the listings and guaranteeing that any information a buyer might need is available, there is a level of trust established and thus repeated business is created.

# How to Allocate Budget Between PPC and SEO Efforts

# Product Lifecycle Stage

Budget allocation is influenced by the stage at which your product is currently at its life-cycle. All the stages require specific action plans to strike the best timing between short-term exposure and sustainable development.

# New Product Launch

When developing a new product, a common goal is to maximize the amount of attention a product receives as soon as it hits the market and as time goes by. PVC to PPC campaigns should consume 70‚Äì80% of your total advertising budget.¬†

This provides a brand‚Äôs product with a high ranking of relevant keywords to increase the rate of its sales, initially helping to rapidly gain reviews from clients ‚Äì an important factor in SEO optimizing.

¬†As previously explained the higher PPC investment guarantees quicker traffic more often benefiting from a tested and active listing against the well set organic listings.

* Let‚Äôs imagine that you have a fitness tracker that you are going to launch. Blowing a lot of money on PPC for terms such as ‚Äòcheap fitness tracker‚Äô guarantees traffic and impression as your product gathers reviews and sales records in the market.

# Established Product

¬†SEO should be given maximum priority once your product is established; in that case, shift your budgets towards it. Spend 50-60% of your time for the purpose of enhancing product tile, description, as well as backend keywords to enhance the rate of organic search.¬†

Effective SEO strategy minimizes the utilization of PPC which increases profitability and the sustainability of an online business.

* Imagine a multi-functional vegetable slicer already ranking well for ‚Äòkitchen gadgets‚Äô. The current listing helps more. This means that SEO investment guarantees consistent penetration of the market without regular ad spend.

To sum up, the novelty of the product implies high saturation with PPC to start its active sale, advanced products should transform their budget to SEO for more organic growth. This means that dynamic allocation approach lets you use the strength of the two methods at the right time.

# Competitors as well as Niche oversaturation

The competition level within your specialized area defines how your financial resources should be divided between PPC and SEO.

# High Competition

¬†As in many competitive segments, the question of visibility determines success in highly specialized fields. PPC principles also should take 60‚Äì70% of your budget because your product has many competitors.¬†

Engage PPC alongside SEO since they can be run in parallel to create traffic and sales on the short end while developing SEO on the long run. This kind of PPC should be steadily phased out with time due to change in ranking, especially when organic rankings have taken root.

* An¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†seller in the skincare niche that decides to introduce an anti-aging serum will realise that the market belongs to more prominent players. PPC campaigns targeting such keywords as ‚Äòanti-aging serum for sensitive skin‚Äô puts the product in front of the potential buyer despite competition.

*Low Competition*

¬†If your niche is not too competitive you can set aside a higher percentage of the total budget to go to SEO right from the start. There are lesser competitors and organic ranking is attained easily; although, PPC can be planned purposefully to support the SEO work.

¬†Here, investing $50000 or more to SEO offers the brand‚Äôs sustainable growth because it requires less ad spending.

* For example, an ‚Äòeco friendly yoga mats,‚Äô which occupies a relatively small market segment, will not need extensive PPC advertising; significantly more advertising funds need be allocated to optimization for search engine result pages.

To sum up, the higher the competition the greater the share of PPC you will have to use in the beginning. In other words, the opposite is true when there is little competition: a balanced or SEO approach would be more successful.

# Ad Cost Trends and ACoS Goals

It is one of the most important KPIs and, in combination with ad cost, will help set your budget. The relative use of PPC and SEO depending on these parameters provides for its profitability and effectiveness.

# Rising Ad Costs

While costs of ads are continuously rising, if ACoS is either constant or improving, it might be worth preserving a higher PPC budget (50-60%). This approach makes certain that you maximize your returns from the ads hence harness its constant upward trend on costs.

* That is why, even if the ACoS is 20% and PPC campaigns are remarkable in bringing conversion, it is justified to maintain high PPP when the costs are rising.

# Declining Profitability

If ACoS goes beyond your established profitability points, it is high time for SEO to be funded more. SEO investment affects organic places; it has little reliance on paid advertisements resulting in less cost.

* Whenever a keyword such as ‚Äòorganic baby shampoo‚Äô sells a lot but in the process incurs a very high ACoS, then moving the budget to improve the position of the same keyword is a way of achieving more permanent standing, without having to cut on the ad spend all the time.

If the above metrics are tracked, one can be able to make decisions that are informed by data. Since SEO is less costly as compared to PPC when the latter becomes unprofitable, it is used for sustaining visibility and sales.¬†

This should be done continuously in order to identify current trends that should be followed to ensure the allocations result in the most profit possible.

# Seasonal and Nonseasonal Goods

Whether or not the product is eventually going to sell in the particular year determines where the most of the available finances is going to be spent between the PPC and the SEO.

# Seasonal Products

¬†Back in the peak of demand, particularly during festive seasons or events, it is advisable to invest 70-80% of your budget on PPC. Seasonal¬†[PPC advertising](https://www.inc.com/peter-roesler/ensure-your-ppc-campaign-is-successful-with-these-tips.html)¬†takes advantage of the increased interest, which should be done anyway so that your product is visible to interested consumers.

¬†During the winter, you should move to SEO and dedicate 60-70% of your efforts for the long-term ranking of the business listings.

* An¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†seller of gift boxes particularly those for Christmas could use PPC in the months leading to December targeting phrases such as gift ideas during the holidays. After the holiday season, they need to ensure that they continue to optimize for general terms such as ‚Äògift boxes‚Äô.

# Year-Round Products

¬†For products, which are in a steady demand, a balanced approach is effective. Distribute your expenditure in PPC and SEO in a 50/50 ratio meaning that you spend 50% of your budget in PPC and 50% in SEO.¬†

PPC generates traffic to the website instantly, while SEO focuses on consistently causing a constant increase in traffic to that website in the long run.

* This may be done by a reusable water bottle¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†seller so as to continually capture new customers and at the same create natural rankings for terms such as ‚Äòrecyclable water bottles.‚Äô

# Keyword Performance Data

Keyword performance indicates how to properly set up PPC and SEO accounts, and how money should be allocated between these two strategies.¬†

Employing PPC information can help make a determination of the keywords to use that would help in conversion and the ones that should not be used. It can help you tweak your PPC and SEO so that they offer the best returns for your business.

# Well-Performing Keywords

It may be useful for instance to assign part of your SEO spend to ensure that your PPC refined key phrases are optimised on your product pages. If there are customers interested in high-performing PPC keywords, it is likely that if you optimize your listing in a relevant manner, it will rank higher organically.

¬†This would be more efficient for the growth of any business since it is not fully dependent on paid advertisement in future.

* Seeing that ‚Äòplant-based protein for athletes‚Äô has high conversion rates in a PPC campaign on a vegan protein powder, the search query should be incorporated into SEO. In this way, when your listing starts to rank for that keyword organically, it can rest assured knowing that without spending much on ads, it will remain prominent for that keyword.

# Poor-Performing Keywords

¬†On the other hand, target keywords that yield low results with PPC campaigns should not be used any longer. It‚Äôs recommended to refocus ads from those keywords to better performing ones in order to decrease your ACoS and increase your ROI.

¬†Redirecting the SEO activities to focus on those keywords that have proved to be more useful in PPC helps avoid directing our resources in the wrong direction.

* If you are struggling with the ‚Äòvegan protein powder for weight loss‚Äô PPC campaign then it might be best to look for an alternative keyword that works well in that platform such as ‚Äòplant-based protein for muscle gain‚Äô then to apply SEO techniques in an attempt to make the term work when in fact it might never does well in that platform.

By using PPC campaigns, you can keep reviewing the keyword‚Äôs success, and by doing so, you can use them on your SEO strategy and have your listings appear without using an ad.

# ¬†Scaling and Retention Goals

It is crucial to decipher if you require extended customer acquisition resulting from PPC or focus on retaining those customers with SEO services hence understand the budget allocation that is needed.¬†

These goals will affect your strategy, and the acquisition will address PPC way more than the retention who looks into more SERP investment in the long term.

# Customer Acquisition Focus

If your main objective is to gain as many new customers as possible within the shortest time possible, you should allocate 60-70% of the budget to PPC.

¬†PPC is useful in terms of providing instantaneous exposure, meaning products are moved up to the top result where customers can easily access them, leading to more buys on your listings and, in effect, creating more customers.¬†

This is mostly applied when launching new products, or diving into new industries, where getting initial attention is critical.

* A new subscription box service may experiment with PPC campaigns seeking the keywords ‚Äòbest subscription boxes for \[targeted group\]‚Äô in order to gain an immediate positive response and lead traffic to their listings.

Retention and Loyalty Focus: If the key objectives of your brand are centered on retention and subsequent, customer loyalty then it will be most suitable to allocate between 60 to 70% of your budget to SEO.¬†

Robust SEO guarantees that your product sticks in the eyes of the consumers, encouraging re-buying, and referrals. By providing focus on SEO you are able to lower the amount of money spent on advertising and have returning customers flooded with organic exposure.

* For instance, an¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†seller of quality skincare products would apply SEO in a way that their target product listings would appear frequently when clients seek products such as ‚Äúthe best anti aging serum‚Äù and ‚Äúskincare for sensitive skin‚Äù instead of paying for PPC adverts.

Keeping a proper ratio of spend on PPC and SEO guarantees that you are establishing new customers whenever needed and increasing the client database overall while keeping it stable at the same time.

# Budget Examples: Use Case for Different Budgets

Whether you need to constantly attract traffic to a site or draw customer attention to a specific product, there should be a direct PPC to SEO budget ratio.¬†

Here are examples of how you would apportion your budget depending on a given business condition; when introducing a new product or when wanting to boost sales of a particular product during a particular season.

# Scenario 1: New Product in a Competitive Niche

* Monthly Budget: $5,000
* PPC: $3,500 (70%)
* SEO: $1,500 (30%)

Here, a new product in a highly sensitive market requires significant PPC to generate traffic and visibility and kick start the market. Nevertheless, SEO stays important yet is more of a supportive aspect that should aim primarily at creating a solid basis for the listing and for the formation of organic positions.

# Scenario 2: Defending a Moderate Competition Niche Market

* Monthly Budget: $3,000
* PPC: $1,200 (40%)
* SEO: $1,800 (60%)

For a regular product with average competition it is necessary to go for SEO. There is a good presence on the organic side and you can definitely cut down your PPC cost and put more money to work in other areas like refining product listings. This helps maintain organic traffic with some sale traffic as the icing on the cake.

# Scenario 3: Usage During Peak Demand Applies To For A Seasonal Product.

* Monthly Budget: $10,000
* PPC: $8,000 (80%)
* SEO: $2,000 (20%)

Seasonal products need a lot of money spent in PPC during the high demand season. This is particularly helpful since PPC enables you to bid for ad spaces during an occasion where search traffic is high season.¬†

The following examples show why your budget allocation needs to change depending on the stage of the product, its competitors, and its demand: Knowledge of such factors makes the allocation scheme efficient and flexible.

# It Is Actually Imperative To Flow¬†

PPC budgets and SEO are not constant percentages of a brand‚Äôs marketing budget. It thus requires constant assessment and optimization, which is based on both past and current performance figures. Monthly PPC and SEO audit reviews of how both types of marketing campaigns are faring will ensure the best results.

# PPC Metrics

¬†Many parameters: dynamics of CTR, conversion rates, ACoS, etc. It also allows you to decide whether your PPC campaigns are bringing the expected returns on the investment. If ACoS is higher than expected you should consider optimising your budget and cut PPC spend and shift more of your attention on SEO.

# SEO Metrics

¬†Track organic rankings, traffic and sales that are attributed to organic SEO efforts. Therefore, for websites generating a good amount of traffic through SEO and converting this traffic, the PPC can be cut back on, freeing up the resources to improve the listing positions and build overall organic rankings.

# ROI and Profitability

¬†It is also important to keep measuring the returns on investment for both PPC and SEO. If, for instance, PPC strategy is giving better short-run results in terms of conversion, then it might be more rational to spend more of the amount on ad placements.

¬†However, if SEO is effective in constantly feeding a brand with organic sales, then the increased spending will greatly offset the total marketing cost, and positively impact the brand‚Äôs long-term profitability.

# When to Scale Back PPC and Focus More on SEO

The next question is when is it so appropriate to start scaling back on PPC, and start focusing more on search engine optimization?

It means that if your business is gradually growing on Amazon, the approach to the ratios between PPC and SEO should also change. Although PPC can produce instant traffic and quick sales, SEO affords long-term stability and therefore a cheaper method of retaining organic rankings.¬†

The ability to identify when you should reduce your utilization of PPC and switch to SEO majorly affects your profits and productivity. Here are some of the signs that point to that crucial time when change of strategy is necessary.

# Unaware Your Product Went Viral

As soon as your product goes to the organic search results for its primary keywords, more PPC campaigning is not as necessary. Those that remain consistently within the first page or two of the search results for their defined keywords do not need expensive adverts to sustain them.

¬†If what you see is a gradual increase in your organic rankings you should be able to know that it is time to increase the budget on SEO more.¬†

By optimising product titles, descriptions, and any hidden keywords put behind the¬†[product title](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/writing-balanced-product-title-features/)¬†you create a solid organic footprint, which inevitably helps to lessen the need for ongoing paid advertising.

* When you are doing PPC for ‚Äúwireless earbuds‚Äù for several months, your product starts capturing the first three positions for this word. This is something indicating that your product is gaining acceptance naturally and you can now cut down on PPC and focus on SEO to strengthen those positions.

# When Advertising Cost of Sale is Becoming Unaffordable

ACoS is a very important metric that helps you know how much you are spending on ads to ensure a particular level of sales. It serves as a heads up that reaching that ACoS level is costly not to mention if the returns are not proportional to the spend, then getting sales this way is not as efficient as it used to be when using PPC.¬†

Muting the PPC campaign and focusing more on SEO will eventually cut on costs and yet keep the productVisible. The other benefits of optimizing for say long-tail keywords or increasing your product conversion rate can help increase organic traffic at a fraction of the cost.

* Let‚Äôs assume you are using $5 per sale on its PPC campaigns and while making $10 in gross profit out of them, there is almost little room for expansion. Instead, you can cut down on PPC spend and instead opt for SEO to rank your product more organically, to sell more and spend less on advertising.

# Gain Benefits From The Reviews¬†

Customer opinions or reputation seem to have a strong bearing on both forms of paid ads and organic rankings. PPC campaigns can work for achieving initial couple of sales and more that are followed by the reviews, but with the given number of reviews are likely to be ranked naturally.

¬†As you advance to this step your priority should move to improving the appearance of your listing to showcase the reviews much as you aim at topping the organic search results and therefore reducing on the use of the paid advertising.

* A food selling kitchen appliance has garnered more than 100 positive reviews. If the review profile is strong, it ranks organically, and this means less push for GPaaS to aggressively sell PPC campaigns.¬†

This is the right time to go back to the listing and use proper researched keywords and make proper changes in the product descriptions especially targeting for the SEO for long term results.

# When Your Product‚Äôs Niche Becomes the Problem

If your product markets within a sphere which is not as keenly contested or indeed if your product has adequately distinct itself from other similar products, SEO can then become a long term, efficient marketing tool.¬†

If you just develop enough brand equity and credibility, you can get sustained visibility through organic without having to purchase click throughs. In such instances, the SEO strategy will ensure that product visibility is maintained, while less money is spent on advertising.

* There is an identification of brand loyalty and customer recognition by a firm selling environmentally friendly cleaning products in a specific segment. Once their product listings are made they automatically rank for Buy Terms such as ‚Äònatural cleaning supplies‚Äô.¬†

Since there is not much competition in this particular niche, the¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†seller can reduce spend on PPC ads and concentrate on SEO to stay relevant as well as to keep on growing gradually.

# Performance of PPC

Long-run, running PPC campaigns will prove to be very useful in generating insights as to which keywords, and product listing are likely to generate the most traffic. In case you have accumulated a lot of data from the PPC campaigns you can then shift more energy towards SEO for those keywords that proved to be more effective.¬†

This means you get to make your listings keyword rich for the keywords that have high click through rate on ads hence improving your organic search results and avoiding over reliance on ads.

* One day after having been running PPC for several months, you tend to realize that ergonomic office chair term is a huge convert.

¬†If you can rank for that keyword in the first place, it also means you can now invest more into the SEO of your product listing by including that keyword in the title, description and backend keywords of the product.

¬†That means that when other variables are held constant, as the organic traffic increases you can reduce the PPC for that keyword.

# When Your Product is Seasonal

For products with high periodicity, then the PPC campaigns are usually most appropriate during those periods. As the season comes to a close, there is no urgency for increased PPC usage and tuning in for more SEO for sustained all-year presence.¬†

To address the latter issue, you should position your products for less popular, but more universal, keywords This way, your product will always remain in demand, even after the ‚Äòseason‚Äô of highly popular search queries is over.

* As an example, a particular¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†seller of holiday decorations has many PPC ads running every time in the holiday season. During the¬†[holiday season](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/top-10-ecommerce-strategies-for-holiday-season-that-your-brand-cant-afford-to-ignore/), they can spend a lot of money on PPC but after that, they can cut it down and just work on the lifespan of listings under broader keywords such as ‚Äòunique home decorations‚Äô.

# When You Have to think Long-term

SEO is a good long-term plan that will help your products to stay relevant in the market without having to keep on with constant advertising costs. Although PPC is helpful for advertising in the present time, it is also essential to develop a good SEO for the future of the business.¬†

This way, transitioning to SEO enables you to shift some focus away from the paid ads while still maintaining overall organic performance, meaning that your brand will always remain relevant without escalating your ad budget.

* One sustainable fashion merchant has relied on PPC as a means of creating brand familiarity and the first sale. When the business expands, they start concentrating on SEO through using broader and more general keywords.¬†

This makes it easy for the Amazon FBA seller to create a good organic profile, and pump most of the investments into creating a long-term business rather than being compelled to constantly increase PPC expenses.

# How SEO Lowers Ad Spend by Increasing Amazon‚Äôs Organic Sales

Future and current businesses aspiring to cut down their ad spend and at the same time boost their organic sales on the likes of Amazon need to embrace search engine optimization, also called SEO. Through general unaided product listings, firms can reduce the explicit use of paid ads which may be expensive in the long run.¬†

# Enhanced search result rankings

The basis of SEO in Amazon is based on optimization of products for searches that are conducted on the platform. In other words, the more frequently a product is exposed, the more likely it will attract the clicks finally culminating in sales.

¬†Title, description, and keywords that are associated with a product must be optimized for higher rankings in Amazon search.

* For example, if we have a product such as Bluetooth headphones. Hence the challenge if the title is displayed as ‚ÄúWireless Headphones,‚Äù it will be more complex for the product to feature on the search results when a customer is looking for headphones of a Bluetooth type suitable for gym use or the noise-cancellation headphones for running.¬†

This way, by keying in the words like ‚Äògym use,‚Äô sports‚Äô or ‚Äònoise-canceling‚Äô the product then has higher chances of being featured in the search results. When the product being sold is higher in the SEO rankings, there is no necessity to frequently make ad spendings to attract the customer‚Äôs attention.

Increased visibility through link SEO enables the products to go to the right market after dismissing the costs incurred on paid ads thus leading to a long-term cost saving through optimizing the organic sales.¬†

Also, more people are able to see the product and that shall reduce the dependence on the sponsored campaigns to bring traffic.

1jjizr1,https://i.redd.it/fbag2as05uqe1.jpeg,Dangerous Seaside Streets No One Talks About üò°,"Let‚Äôs be real for a second. I‚Äôve been diving into crime data, local reports, and year-over-year statistics for Seaside Heights, NJ, and here‚Äôs what nobody ‚Äî not the realtors, not the tourists, not even most locals ‚Äî wants to admit:

The eastern side of Seaside Heights, especially around Sumner Ave, Webster Ave, and Ocean Terrace, has been a consistent hotspot for crime for over a decade. Property crime rates near the boardwalk? 1 in 9 chance of becoming a victim. Go west, and that number drops to 1 in 59. You‚Äôre not imagining it ‚Äî the east side has been rough. Drugs, assaults, thefts ‚Äî you name it.

But here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm going to flip the script: It‚Äôs changing. And that‚Äôs a good thing.

You‚Äôve probably noticed the coffee shops popping up, the new condos, the influx of investment around previously sketchy blocks. Yeah, that‚Äôs called gentrification. And yes, it makes people mad ‚Äî the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre pushing locals out!‚Äù argument comes up every time. But let‚Äôs talk facts:

1. Gentrification is bringing police presence year-round. No more seasonal patrolling and winter free-for-alls.


2. Investors are turning abandoned properties ‚Äî often drug dens ‚Äî into livable spaces.


3. Families and remote workers are moving in and demanding safety, forcing change.



I‚Äôm not here to romanticize gentrification. But ask yourself: would you rather leave these streets to decay while city officials plaster over it with summer fireworks and street fairs? Or clean it up, even if that comes with growing pains?

The east side has been dangerous for too long. Gentrification might finally make people care enough to change that.

If you‚Äôre mad, good. Prove me wrong. Otherwise, buckle up ‚Äî because in 5 years, that ‚Äúdangerous block‚Äù near the boardwalk is going to have a $1 million brownstone on it and a waitlist for brunch.

More than I would ever consume. Unfortunately, you can't send the offer to others so I have to make the order for you.

From now to noon EDT (9 AM PDT), Mar 25, 2025 (today), I will order for you¬†**up to 2**¬†hot beverages. This includes modifications such as extra toppings/syrups for free. Again, HOT beverage. Not cold beverages such as ice capp, donuts, or sandwiches!

**If you want plain ""brewed coffee"". Don't bother!** Make it at home I won't order it for you¬† Might as well get the maximum value out of this freebie.

I had this offer on RFD and it was pretty popular.  Not so popular on my local city subreddit.

Rules:

1. only contact via chat from now to noon, other times will be ignored. I will try to respond as soon as i can but things happen or I'm in the middle of another order
2. valid at Canada locations only
3. ideally, once we start the chat you should respond pretty quickly as I am ready to order.  If an order takes more than 5 minutes to make I may just lose interest
4. I reserve the right to ignore you if I feel like you're just trolling me or making me waste an order/time
5. Don't blame me if they make your order wrong... even if it is my mistake :) You get what you pay for.

Also get me as much order details as possible in your initial chat. ie. exact menu item name, size, dairy, sweetener, toppings, espresso shots, etc. If not I will just leave the default values as is.

I lost a phone inside the IAH airport (Its not the end of the world). I have made a lost and found claim with both the airport and united airlines. I was hoping I would be able to call someone in the airport, send them a screen shot my `Find My Device` (included below),  and start the retrieval process. Unfortunately I can't seem to get a response. 

1-800-335-2247 (Directs me to a call center that was only able to suggest I go online to make a claim). This number often does not respond or simply hangs up when attempting to connect to a live rep.

So what should one do when they are in this situation?

Since I bought my Delonghi Magnifica S Feb 25, I went through multiple trouble. The grinder got broken already twice and went to the repairer. Was great after all. Then it got stucked twice and I fixed it by myself. I recently moved house with the machine well protected in its box.

When I unpacked it, I still had the same recurring problem of the shredder running partially in a vacuum.

I've got a bit of ground coffee falling into the infuser and some stuck in the grinder, but I've got the failure lights for lack of coffee on.

I've tried dismantling the whole grinder to look for a coffee bean blocking the rotation.

I checked the ball bearings. It grinds a little, partially in a vacuum, makes a little ground coffee, but I've broken down.

Do you have any ideas? I'm thinking of putting some lubricant back on the ball bearings at the base of the grinder, but I'd like your advice on how to fix it.

Kinda hard for people to know you exist if you don't make yourself seen!

I live in the Midwest USA, and I am willing to start a relationship from anywhere. Japan, Europe, Africa doesn't matter to me! That being said however, if you are not willing to travel or communicate - then a more serious relationship is off the table. Still more than happy to be a friend, though.

I do not care about your religious beliefs or politics. I feel like differing beliefs create nothing but friction and can be damaging to a relationship that has everything else going for it. I'm an Omnist Pagan, this means that I believe the true spiritual way is hidden amongst the world's religions. What do they all have in common? I feel that by studying that, one can find peace and positivity sprinkled amongst them all. Whether you are Christian, Buddhist, Islam, or any other religion - I will always respect your beliefs. We believe what we believe and we are all on our own spiritual path - and I expect the same respect. Similarly, whether you are right wing or left wing doesn't matter to me. Believe what you feel is right, but do NOT try to force them on me.

I have minor standards when it comes to what I want in a potential permanent partner.

This standard is non-negotiable, the rest I can be flexible on: I am not romantically or sexually attracted to transgender women. I want a biological female, because I want children that come from me. I am more than happy to be a friend, but I will never be able to commit to a permanent relationship. The biological compatibility just isn't there.

Do not be clinically obese. Obesity causes severe heart problems, diabetes, and damages the cartilage in your joints which can lead to permanent pain management as you grow older. It also damages your ability to enjoy things like hiking, roller coasters, or certain foods (depending on medical condition), and the worst part of all? These conditions can be passed down to your children. That's not what I want for my children, or my permanent partner down the road.

Be hygienic. Brush your teeth, shower regularly, use deodorant. I really feel like I shouldn't need to mention this but you'd be surprised...

Do not be needy. My job means I have to take occasional business trips. If you are demanding my attention 24/7, then you are asking me to sacrifice everything I have built for myself and everything that I want to enjoy just to focus on you. That's not happening. If we're relaxing at home - of course we're gonna spend time together! But if I need a couple hours of me-time, or want to go to the gym, I expect that time to be respected. I'll do the same for you! Whether it be a girl's night out, or spa date - all I'll want is a text when you leave and when you come back just so I know you are safe.

Finally - if we don't have a lot in common, a serious relationship isn't going to happen! It just isn't. I don't want someone who thinks they have to change themselves and who they are just to be with me. I like video games, and you like movies? Don't force yourself to like video games - and don't force me to watch your movies. I love Legos and you think they're childish? Don't force yourself to love Legos - but don't expect me to be willing to be a partner if you try to force me to stop enjoying Legos.

That being stated, I love trying new things! I will try everything at least twice. I love new experiences, and I love exploring. Maybe you have something you are passionate about and want to share? Chances are, I'll explore it myself and ask you where to go with it. Maybe I'll find a new like! Or potential dislike. Know that I am willing to try just about anything, how can I have the integrity to say I like or dislike something when I haven't even tried it?! That being said, there is a small group of things I inherently dislike and will never do - but all of those are related to more adult matters. If you know, you know.

I always set some time aside to keep my place clean and organized. I just like a clean environment.

I really enjoy creative games like Rimworld, Space Engineers, or Cosmoteer. The only FPS I really play is Rainbow Six Siege. I'm far more likely to play Dragon's Dogma, Project Zomboid, or whatever else scratches my itch.

I love to cook and make desserts! Chicken n Dumplings, a good steak, a comforting soup, a sweet banana pudding - I just enjoy making them!

I also love coffee, sometimes I'll make my own lattes or cappuccinos with what I have on hand - Starbucks can be expensive! I try to go outside or be active at least once a week, there's just a lot to do out there and I want to be able to enjoy it. Home time is fine - but if the weather is nice, why not go out and do something? Touch grass!

One of my indoor activities is weekly DnD. I'm a Pathfinder 2E kinda guy, and I really enjoy all the creative character-crafting and problem-solving that it offers. Also, it's just plain fun.

If you're willing to try new things, care about yourself and your body, are willing to keep in touch and communicate with honesty, and are willing to take an interest or enjoy my hobbies with me - then maybe you're the one! My boundaries are not end all be all. For example, if you are needy - but we have a ton in common and enjoy the same things - then the chances are good! Just keep in mind that the less we have in common, the less likely it will be for something serious. I will still be more than happy to be friends, but it will most likely never progress beyond that.

If you ever want a pic, or have questions, or just wanna chat - just shoot me a DM! I track my notifications and check my inbox often, especially after submitting a post like this. So if I am not busy at work, or focusing on another task - chances are you will get a reply at least within an hour.

That being said... If we get to to chatting regularly and you can't find the time to reply within 3 days, don't bother. I am looking for someone who wants to be active with me and engage with me, not feel me out for a week and then disappear.",1,1742906597.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

I get super dry mouth when I drink alcohol and caffeine. I‚Äôve always been a lightweight with alcohol and very sensitive to caffeine, but it‚Äôs a whole other level lately. 

While I have other things going on, I think menopause is partially to blame. 

I‚Äôm going to doc in a couple of days, and hopefully getting meds to help all the other stuff‚Ä¶ hot flashes, aches, mood, brain fog, etc. 

It seems like a lame complaint, and I‚Äôve never been big on either alcohol or caffeine, but lately I‚Äôm so tired, I want a tea or even coffee to focus. My best friends want us to go to vineyards and whiskey tour and tasting (we are so fancy) now that the kids are all moved out. 

I just want to be able to participate in life again. 

Mind you, they are the absolute best girlfriends, buying me all sorts of non-alcoholic and decaf teas and mocktails and making sure restaurants we go to have them. They even made sure there was a non-drinking whiskey tour with chocolate pairing add-on, so I could participate before they even invited us. Both of them had hysterectomies years ago, so they have that in common and claim they never really had menopause symptoms as a result. 

I cannot relate.

But anyway, will HRT allow me to hang out with my girls or have a cup of coffee in the morning, especially on days I need to read legal contracts for work? hah.

***CBDL Targets a Multi-Million Dollar Market as Tens of Thousands of Attendees Converge for Arizona's Hottest Motorcycle Event***

**SCOTTSDALE, AZ /** [**ACCESS Newswire**](https://www.accessnewswire.com/) **/ March 25, 2025 / CBD Life Sciences Inc. (OTC PINK:CBDL)**, a market leader in the CBD and mushroom wellness industry, is revving up for its high-octane presence at the legendary Cave Creek Bike Week, March 28 - April 6, 2025. With tens of thousands of motorcycle enthusiasts and thrill-seekers converging on Cave Creek, this premier event presents an unparalleled opportunity for CBDL to showcase its groundbreaking product line, maximize brand visibility, and generate explosive revenue growth.

Cave Creek Bike Week, hosted by the Hideaway Grill and Roadhouse, has become a nationally recognized gathering of riders, industry professionals, and lifestyle brands. The 2024 event boasted record attendance, featuring jaw-dropping stunt shows, live music, exclusive vendors, and premium entertainment. The Hideaway Grill is located at 6746 E Cave Creek Rd, Cave Creek, AZ 85331.

While exact figures for Cave Creek Bike Week remain undisclosed, it coincides with Arizona Bike Week, which reported an astonishing 85,000 attendees in 2023. With attendees typically spending hundreds of dollars per visit on lifestyle and wellness products, this event represents a major revenue catalyst for participating businesses. Estimates suggest that Arizona Bike Week alone generates upwards of $20 million in local economic impact, a number that underscores the lucrative potential for vendors like CBDL. By tapping into this high-spending demographic, CBDL is strategically positioned to capitalize on the surging demand for premium wellness solutions.

1jji4qk,https://i.redd.it/uh9mmo76xtqe1.jpeg,Update: from sandwich to cookie,"I just took my flight from Porto to Amsterdam, and there were indeed some changes. Besides swapping a sandwich for a cookie (a small stroopwafel), the free drink options have also been reduced. Only coffee, tea, and apple juice are available, while all other drinks‚Äîexcept water‚Äîare now only available for purchase.

On other flights and routes not included in this trial, water is usually served in the same cups as coffee. However, today each passenger received a 25cl plastic water bottle instead.

Some passengers complained to the cabin crew about the service changes and asked if they were permanent. The crew responded that the purpose of the trial is to see how passengers react‚Äîwhether they start purchasing what was previously free, bringing their own food from home, or if in-flight sales decrease.

The cabin crew advised dissatisfied passengers to file a complaint or send an email, as KLM (supposedly) cares about customer feedback.

Lastly, giving every passenger a plastic water bottle instead of using one to serve multiple people is a noticeable change. For an airline that says it cares about the environment, this feels like a step in the wrong direction.

I was going to wait until the completion of the project to post about it, revealing a super cool, nearly phr together, finished project. 
I have totally changed my mind
After all, the PIP BOY is something of a companion, a wasteland multi tool, the ""Leatherman"" of its own post-societal/economical time.
This leads me to how I now plan on posting updates for this project, and that's going to be here-and-there, most likely each time I add additional functionality to it/additional features within reason. 

BUILD SO FAR:
  -Aluminum cans, larger can is a mini coffee can and smaller can is a mid size bush's baked beans can
  -paint, each can was ""rhino lined"" with bed liner spray for texturization and ruggedness, then each was painted army green or a variation of dark green. Scuffs to the paint job (due to my eagerness to build before allowing the paint to dry) are being covered with black sharpie or brown acrylic paint as I scratch it more and more while working on it. 
  -the elastic tensioned bracket system in picture 2. I designed and printed these brackets for these heavy elastic loops I already had on hand and will slice the large can down the middle longways in between these sets of brackets to allow for stretch/flexion over the arm. 

Some specified goals for the project:
Wrist worn media station (of sorts)
OTG soldering station with helping hands claws & magnifier glass / work light
AM/FM radio 
Customized Bluetooth speaker
Analog watch
Analog thermometer
18650 hot swappable power for all devices
Power ON/OFF multi-switch board for all devices
(Possibly) A multimeter 
A retractable fabric in/cm ruler

We‚Äòve been friends for years and I don‚Äôt mind her clumsiness since it‚Äôs not her fault and she doesn‚Äôt do it on purpose. But over the last few weeks there were a few moments it actually affected me. We were sitting in the park on my picnic blanket drinking coffee when she spilled her cup over the blanked. She was really sorry about it and tried to clean it up. It wasn‚Äôt that bad but I was kinda annoyed since we had to sit around a wet stain until it dried. But last week her, a friend and I were sitting in my living room. I have a new couch and purposely placed a blanket on top of it. We were drinking wine and it just so happens that she spilled wine on the blanked. She apologized and I put the blanked in the washer telling her to be more careful and to not get anything on the couch. Of course it didn‚Äôt last long. About half an hour later her quarter full wine glass slipped out of her hand. She apologized a thousand times and helped getting the stain out of the couch (at least most of it). When we were sitting on the couch again she asked for a refill. At this point I was kind of fed up and afraid for my couch. So I took her glass, went to the kitchen and came back with wine in a sports bottle. She was startled and asked if she could have an actual glass since drinking wine out of a sports bottle feels wrong. I told her it‚Äôs just for precaution. We didn‚Äôt fight or anything but the vibe was gone after this. I can‚Äôt help feeling bad now since I know she didn‚Äôt do it on purpose and I really value our friendship.

I‚Äôve never really told anyone about this, aside from my current partner. When I was a child, not sure exactly how old but around 4-6, I‚Äôm 99.9999% sure I saw a Duende. 

I was entering my living room and had thought I saw our family cat under the coffee table, so I crouched a bit to see her, and that‚Äôs when this tiny ginger haired creature. They poked their head out, sorta looked side to side to see if the way was clear, noticed me, and quickly went back under the table. Seemingly disappeared from there. 

I just froze. I didn‚Äôt know what to do for a very long time and I don‚Äôt know when I moved again, but I never told anyone. I either thought that no one would believe me, or even worse, that people would tell me that creature I thought I saw was real and was gonna ‚Äúcome get me‚Äù some day. 

While I was scared, I don‚Äôt recall feeling threatened by the creature. It sorta reminded me of the behaviour of a skiddish cat. I imagine it would have ran from me if I tried to catch it. 

I‚Äôve since decided that I probably hallucinated that. Flash forward to age 30 and now I‚Äôm seeing things online about Duendes and my brain hurts. They look identical. IDENTICAL. 

Could I have actually seen a Duende? Idk‚Ä¶ I also have aphantasia, so the thought that my brain was even capable of creating such imagery is baffling to me.

Yes, that's my salary as an industrial engineer in Morocco. Been working for almost two years; I never saved anything because of gambling. It was not just the money, but also the time and the stress. My family is so poor, and yet I dragged my father into this (I provide a little at home before losing it all). I once borrowed from my father, and I'm still paying him back (he doesn't know the real reason). I blame myself every day.

After one month of reasoning that I was just chasing losses and that what's gone is gone, yesterday I thought I should've saved at least a decent amount by now. I wanted to buy a gaming chair, an air conditioner, and what I had in my account was 600 USD. It was not enough for me. I installed the gambling app again, kept telling myself to just go to sleep, that I won't win anything, and yet, knowing that I'm going to lose, I hoped for that 100 USD to turn into 1,000 USD. It didn't happen. I swear to you guys, it was not the rush; I felt nothing, just emptiness clicking, knowing what was going to happen at the end. Why I did it? I don't know.

I confronted my brother, and he told me he's not going to talk to me again. I felt him; why would he? I wouldn't talk to myself either. I'm going to disappear for the next month, not going out, even to coffee shops with friends, just to fix a little bit of my account.

Lets start from the beginning so everyone can have an understanding of the situation and really give me some ideas.

My boyfriend and I met on tinder around 4 months ago. Things have been great. Things started as just hooking up, then I would spend the night, then I picked him up from the airport, then he was meeting my family and I was meeting his family and basically for the better part of 3 months we have been attached at the hip.

I‚Äôm talking we stay at each others house a few nights a week, normally hang out after work when we aren‚Äôt spending the night together and we see each other on our work lunch breaks. ATTACHED. AT. THE. HIP. But i would like to clarify that when we spend time apart its really no big deal (we are apart while im writing this) Its not like we are on the phone 24/7 or texting every second of everyday. We just like hanging out all the time. 

Now my only problem with this and he brought it up the other day too is that nearly every second of our free time is spent together and we dont really have time to do our own thing and chase our own dreams. He also lives an hour away from me (we work in the same area just live in two seperate areas). 

My question is how do we spend time apart? Like do we make a schedule on when we can and can‚Äôt see each other because to me that sounds a little bit ridiculous. Because I am trying to save money and buying my morning coffee and lunch when I stay the night at his is making it really difficult along with just trying to stay on top of my own general life upkeep.

I really need advice. As much as we really like one another I don‚Äôt think living together is on the table yet since I just moved into my house, he just moved into his and not to mention we LITERALLY met 4 months ago. I want to hear all the options. 

My main issues at the moment are as follows:

I am trying to get back into the gym which is near my house (around an hour away from his)
I am trying to save money so the fuel money, lunches, coffees
I also know that space is a good thing in any relationship and I don‚Äôt want to become dependent on him at any point so I figure now is as good a time as any.
But also is this just the honeymoon phase of a relationship where we are just all over each other and it will end naturally?",2,1742905111.0,relationship_advice,4,0.75,False

My mind is flipping like a mischievous dolphin through all aspects of my life and it‚Äôs hard to just lay there when my brain is so activated. 
If I can commit to getting rid of a few things a day (in my office), I may have enough space in my room for a double bed. I was going to get a twin but I‚Äôm turning 40. I should get an adult bed. I don‚Äôt need all this shit anyway. I almost pulled the trigger on a twin bed set yesterday. I was so angry. 

Since Friday I have been complaining about the litter that the cats track around the house. Thursday, we got yet another rug (this would be the 5th one that they have destroyed) and by yesterday there were whole chunks of litter coagulating to the textiles. The rug is cheap. I compromised and got a cheap ass fucking stupid ugly Amazon rug because I‚Äôm sick of them destroying everything that I love. I digress. I had hoped that by pointing out the litter rolling around my partner‚Äôs already sick feet‚Ä¶ maybe he would make a connection? Maybe he‚Äôd be inspired to help with the maintenance and care of his home and pets? No. That is not what happened. He asked me to give him some sugar. I realize he was trying to make a bid for connection- I have been avoidant of all contact. But hot damn it pissed me off. 

I decided to not order a twin bed because I was pissed off. Like I said, I want a double. I have to make room for my crafts. lol. 

Yesterday was hard. Professionally I am completely uninspired. How do people stay at jobs for 10 + years?! Is it complacency? And if so‚Ä¶. How do i get that? And why do i resist it so? Do I just want to be chronically unhappy? Is that it? I have the best job. I really do. I work with the best people. But lately, it has been a challenge. 
I can‚Äôt fuck this job up. I have to find a way to get over this hump. 

I‚Äôm just burned out man. 

I‚Äôm overwhelmed by the care of the cats. It‚Äôs like having children. I had no idea that they were so messy. No clue. I had no idea that they would impact my lifestyle so fucking much. I had no idea that I would end up giving so much of a fuck about their grooming and their enrichment and their health and so on. It frustrates me that my partner has not been a good pet owner. The cat box makes me insane and after I resumed all of the responsibility there‚Ä¶. I expected my partner to wake up and help with something. 

I deep cleaned the house Thursday. The house is trashed. There‚Äôs cat hair everywhere. Coffee droplets on the floor. The dishes need to be done twice a day as we both cook but have vastly different diets. 

I can‚Äôt keep up with the household chores. It feels the way that it felt when I had a bunch of little kids and a partner who treated me like a maid. There‚Äôs always a mess, a need‚Ä¶ somebody always needs something. 

The problem is, I can‚Äôt enjoy my free time when the house is a pigsty. Even worse, when I bring up how messy the house is, my partner says ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that bad‚Äù. It triggers the fuck out of me because when I first moved in with him he was living basically in biohazard. Which gave me a lot of perspective into his health conditions, if I‚Äôm being honest. I don‚Äôt care what anyone says, the state of my home is a reflection of my current mental status. Every time. In every way. This is an absolute. I‚Äôve tried to have grace for the situation because my partner is really unwell. But. I‚Äôm also burned the fuck out. 

I think I keep ruminating on this because I feel guilty for pulling away. I feel ashamed of myself for not being able to do this with him. I want to be stronger than this‚Ä¶ I want to be a better person than this. I don‚Äôt want to ruin my life AGAIN because I hooked up with the wrong man AGAIN. I fear for what could happen to my partner in my absence. I‚Äôm putting off this conversation because I don‚Äôt want to cause him harm. I feel like I have to plea my case before I can be granted release. The reality is, it‚Äôs not working and that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs not my job to bring my already deluded partner into reality. 
I don‚Äôt want to be a whiney ass baby anymore.
I think I need to start ordering him around. Which is not something I enjoy at fucking all. Which is par for this fucking course. 

It may be time to start steering this thing and I‚Äôm not looking forward to it. But I want to be sane too. And I want to stop justifying my feelings which are already valid. I don‚Äôt have to build a case. Literally any other person would feel the way that I feel now. 
If my struggle is the house, I can make my room my sanctuary and that‚Äôs what I need to do. That‚Äôs the answer. Instead of bitching in my brain constantly, I can turn my thoughts towards more empowering things:

Empowering things:
-converting my office into a bedroom
-saving money
-finding things to do in Portland alone(ACTORS SHOOOOOWWW!)
-crochet (a friend asked me to participate in her farmers market tables and I may‚Ä¶. We shall see if I can produce market quality crochet products)
-weight loss
-investing in other relationships; friends, colleagues, my dad (who is incredibly lonely)‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Other 
-maybe plan a trip to Alaska?
-plan trips to Washington to spend time with my bestie


This are all awesome things and It‚Äôs not delusional to think about them. Or to invest in them. Or to spend my energy making them happen. 

When I was with my abusive ex, he was the only thing I could think about. And my misery. I don‚Äôt want to live like that and I think that on some level I feel like I have to plea my case for unhappiness. What do I need from my friend group? Permission to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to do this anymore‚Äù? My partner is a really good person, with an amazing, beautiful, tender heart‚Ä¶but that doesn‚Äôt mean that I have to stay committed to something that doesn‚Äôt work. And I don‚Äôt have to make a case for it. It‚Äôs out In the open. In black and white. 

Perhaps I would feel less slimy if I stopped this behavior of whining about my partner and instead, just acted in a way that supported my decision to detach emotionally as I work through a safe separation from my partner. Which will take time. 

I think I also have been struggling because my partner wants pecks on the lips and does things that indicate he still has romantic feelings for me and those gestures are unwelcome now. I do not want to operate as a romantic partnership anymore. I do not want to socialize as romantic partners. So again, with the case making. I don‚Äôt want to do this anymore so I am being a butthead and pushing him away. 

I felt rage last night after work. I‚Äôve been camping out in the bedroom to avoid the cat mess and all the things. When my partner came home he said i could have the livingroom. I declined because all of my crochet stuff was in the bedroom. When I left the room an hour later, he was sleeping, sitting up on the couch. 
I asked him what he was doing. He said he was napping. When I asked him why he didn‚Äôt go for the bedroom, he wouldn‚Äôt give me an answer. So I just went back to the room. When I came out of the room again moments later, his head was fucking rolling around and he was snoring. So I moved my shit out to the livingroom. 
Why wouldn‚Äôt he just tell me that he wants the room?! I was placed in a stupid, fucked up situation where I was the villain no matter what I chose from that moment on. Argh!!!! It upset me so much. If I asked him about it he‚Äôd just say something like ‚Äúwell you are pmsing and you needed the room and I‚Äôm fine on the couch‚Äù. Which is insane and ridiculous. He‚Äôs not fine on the couch. I‚Äôm tired of being the villain. Somehow I have to take care of everything and be the asshole for it too. 

I feel like, in partnership, we are supposed to be verbal about the things we love about our partner. I think it‚Äôs important to build my partner up and invite them to see themselves as I see them. Likewise, I know that when those things are happening for me, I also feel competent, valued, cherished and successful in my relationship and it makes me want to continue doing the things that I am doing. I hate living in a home where I am the bad guy. 

Anyway. Shits fucked and I‚Äôm burned out. 
I think he is playing boardgames with one of his friends tonight. We will see.

1jjhvif,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jjhvif/bf_22m_made_ai_porn_of_my_21_nb_friends_and_our/,Bf (22M) made AI porn of my (21 NB) friends and our coworker,"hi everybody. i don‚Äôt have anybody to talk to about this and it‚Äôs been a month or so since i snooped, so this is me trying to get over everything. my boyfriend has reddit so im not gonna use any names, but if he sees this he‚Äôll know it‚Äôs me. 

my (21NB) partner (22M) and i have been together for almost four years now. we‚Äôve known each other since middle school (so 10 years) and have been friends the majority of the time. there was some on and off dating in middle school but we got back together senior year and have been inseparable since. we go to the same college, work the same shifts at the same job, and were having sleepovers every night for three and a half years until we moved into a place together two months ago. i have my permit but not my license, and we live in a very rural area so there‚Äôs no way i can get around without bf or a family member driving me (i‚Äôm working on this). 

all of this to say that we have had a beautiful relationship, the start was very rocky as we were both dealing with medication/mental health/situational struggles, but the last two years we have very rarely had problems. we communicate well, we work together well, i could genuinely be around him 24/7 and never feel like it was too much. 

so two and a half weeks ago, i woke up fairly early and was scrolling reddit. bf sleeps a lot later than me so i normally spend the first two hours of my day making coffee, breakfast for our pets, and scrolling on my phone. i saw a story where a woman described her perfect relationship and how it was ripped apart when she checked his hidden photos. i don‚Äôt know why this piqued my interest, but it did. i‚Äôve never felt that he was cheating on me in the slightest, he is the most loyal person i‚Äôve ever met and he genuinely made me feel like i was so exciting to him that he could never want anyone else. but there were pictures of girls in his hidden photos. pictures of our female friends, specifically my best friend and one of our coworkers. some were screenshotted from instagram but some were nude photos. this sent my heart into my chest because obviously i‚Äôm thinking that he‚Äôs having a romantic relationship with our friends. but there‚Äôs an AI app watermark in the bottom corner. 

god even just thinking about it still makes me sick to my stomach. i scrolled a little more but i ended up panicking and waking him up asking wtf was going on with the pictures in his camera roll. we talked about it for pretty much the entire day. he said he didn‚Äôt have feelings for them, compiling porn is something he‚Äôs done since a very very young age, he tried not to make excuses but it basically boiled down to ‚Äúthis is a bad habit that i have been trying to stop, this will never happen again.‚Äù 

i know he was introduced to porn at entirely too young of an age, and despite having successful middle/high school relationships before me, he has always felt insecure about his ‚Äúcrushes‚Äù not liking him back. i‚Äôm really trying not to make excuses for the behavior either (as i also explained this is a huuuge breech of consent and i had previously had conversations with him about the dangers of AI for this reason specifically) but i really believe that it‚Äôs stemming from some unanswered sexual trauma. he‚Äôs never been creepy, never been pervy, there were never any signs with how he acted around my friends. i just feel so disappointed. i really would never have guessed anything like this was going on. 

it‚Äôs been about a month and a half since i found the photos, and they‚Äôre torturing me daily. sometimes i close my eyes and i see them, sometimes i see their body over top of mine in the mirror, i‚Äôve been resenting my best friend despite none of this being her fault (i feel the most guilty for this) and same goes for our coworker (luckily i haven‚Äôt worked with her in over a month). i feel an intense guilt and shame for not telling anyone, for keeping his secret. if i ever found new pictures i would leave and spread the word, but i promised him if nothing else happened i would stay quiet. he has encouraged me to leave but i just can‚Äôt. the past four years of my life have been him. he‚Äôs everything to me. i really believe that we‚Äôre supposed to be together, i just don‚Äôt know how to move on from this. if i wake up early to take the dog out i end up spending anywhere from 5-30 minutes scouring his phone to make sure i know about everything. i truly believe he feels guilty about this, but there‚Äôs the part of my judgement telling me that people who get caught are only ever upset because they got caught, not because of guilt. i just don‚Äôt know what to do. 

am i doing myself a disservice by staying? is this more akin to addiction or some fundamental flaw? 

TL;DR: bf of almost 4years had his hidden album filled with AI porn and social media screenshots of my best friend and our shared coworker. lol.
