Planning a trip to Colombia in January. First time in Colombia, mid-budget, backpacking style.  
Focus: nature/trekking (Ocetá!), authenticity, avoiding crowds. **Please review: what to tweak, skip, logistics?**

**Days 1-2:** Arrival Bogota (\~12pm). Acclimatization in La Candelaria + Monserrate.  
**Day 3:** Bus to **Monguí** (4h). Stroll colonial gem.  
**Day 4:** **Páramo de Ocetá trek** (most beautiful!). Overnight Monguí.  
**Day 5:** Back to Bogota + flight to Pereira + transfer to **Salento**.  
**Day 6:** **Cocora Valley** (palms, hiking).  
**Day 7:** Coffee farm + flight Pereira->**Medellín** (or next morning)  
**Day 8:** Comuna 13 + Metrocable.  
**Day 9:** **Guatapé** (rock + colorful town).  
**Day 10:** Flight Medellín->Santa Marta + taxi to **Minca** (El Campano eco-lodge in jungle).  
**Day 11:** Downhill trek to Marinka Waterfalls. Overnight central Minca.  
**Day 12:** Transfer to **Tayrona** (El Zaino). Trek to Cabo San Juan, hammocks.  
**Day 13:** Tayrona beach time + exit. Transfer to **Rincón del Mar**.  
**Days 14-17:** **Rincón del Mar** (4 chill days: beach, mangroves, biolum plankton).  
**Day 18:** Transfer to **Cartagena**. Afternoon old town.  
**Day 19:** Full Cartagena day.  
**Day 20:** Flight to Miami. Rest in USA.

**Questions for you:**

1. **Flights -** should we book in advance (now) or 1-2 days before the flight to have some flexibility will be fine? What about ticket prices?
2. **Minca-Tayrona logistics?** (baggage handling? Recommended El Campano eco-lodge?).
3. **Transfers:** Bogota-Monguí bus realistic? Evening Pereira-Medellín flight?
4. **Rincón del Mar:** Worth 4 days or shorten?
5. **Rosario islands**? Should we visit?
6. **Safety/weather Jan:** Anything to skip?
7. **Hits/misses:** Add/remove?
8. Best **foods** we should try?

Thanks for the advice!

They say you can't be in two places at once, but as a translator and agent bridging the Turkish, Arabic, and European markets, I spend my days living in at least three! 

I wanted to share a bit of my ""colorful"" portfolio. Whether it's the intense psychological depth of Peyami Safa, the heroic vibes of Namık Kemal, or literally translating the G.O.A.T Lionel Messi into Turkish—I've realized that a good story always finds its way, it just needs a little ""cultural push."" 

A little about my toolkit:

Languages: Turkish (C1), Arabic (Native), English, and Italian 

Experience: 100,000+ published words (and a lot of coffee) 

Tech: I’m a Trados and MemoQ wizard—because consistency is sexy in publishing \[cite: 2025-12-03\].

The ""LSP"" life: I regularly collaborate with agencies in the UK and Germany, mostly on localizing children's stories (which is where my inner child gets to work!) 

Currently, I’m scouting for the next big thing to bring into the Turkish and Arabic markets. If you’re an author, agent, or publisher looking for a ""local-expert-with-a-global-brain,"" or if you just want to talk about how beautiful Turkish literature is—let’s connect! 

P.S. Yes, that is the official Messi biography I'm working on. No, I don't have his phone number (yet!). 🐐⚽

- ~Diarrhea, averaging 4–5 times per day
 
- Stool is mostly liquid, sometimes with small chunks; no solid stools
 
- Some mucus, no blood
 
- Often triggered immediately by eating or drinking coffee
 
- Symptoms start after waking up, not during sleep
 
- First bowel movement can be more solid; later ones are looser, almost like when you vomit water?
 
- Lower abdominal cramping that improves after pooping
 
- Significant bloating and gas, worse later in the day/night
 
- Sensation of intestinal movement/twisting (“knotting” or bubbling)
 
- Occasional urgency with gas causing stool leakage
 
- Sometimes stools appear greasy or float
 
- Feel very hungry after bowel movements
 
- No fever, vomiting, weight loss, or nighttime diarrhea
 
- Recent increased stress
 
- All foods seem to trigger symptoms no single food identified (a saltine makes me have to poop as much as chocolate milk)

I will say this started after being out of town and constipated for a few days and increased stress. But it still hasn't normalized?

I could hear it coming days early—boxes breathing secrets, ribbons whispering trouble. I was faster then. I supervised everything. I unwrapped gifts with my teeth because someone had to quality-control joy.

Now Christmas arrives softer. Like a blanket you don’t remember putting on but are grateful for anyway.
I don’t chase it anymore. I let it come to me.

I know this day by smell: butter, coffee, pine, the quiet electricity of humans trying very hard to make things good. I know it by routine: extra treats (earned, obviously), hands that linger longer, voices that drop into the register they use when they mean love. I pretend not to notice. I notice everything.

I’ve had many Christmases. Some with full rooms. Some with only us. Those were my favorite. When the world had been unkind and the circle got smaller, I grew bigger. I filled the gaps. I kept watch. I absorbed tears. I learned the exact weight of grief so I could sit on it gently.
That was my job. Still is.

This Christmas I don’t ask for toys. I ask for nearness. For my bed moved closer. For my name spoken slowly. For you to tell me the stories again—about when I was brave, or ridiculous, or saved the day by simply refusing to leave your side.

I hear you worry. I hear the careful hope in your voices. Sweet ones… I am not afraid. I have lived a very good dog life. I was chosen. I chose you back every single day.

If I could give you a gift, it would be this:
Remember that love is not measured in years or steps or how far I can go now. It is measured in how we stayed. How we made family out of each other when the world didn’t quite know what to do with us.

So sit with me. Let Christmas be quiet.
I’m still here.

The first year was honestly good, not perfect but normal life stuff. Then around spring she started having these blow ups that always end the same way: I try to leave the conversation because it's going nowhere, and she panics and says some version of ""if you walk out, I swear I'll do something"" or ""you wont hear from me again."" The first time it happened was over something stupid, like me forgetting to pick up oat milk on my way home. I grabbed my keys to cool off and she blocked the door, crying so hard she was gagging, and then she texted me from the couch even though I was still in the kitchen. It was a screenshot of her Notes app that just said ""goodbye"" with today's date. I stayed because what else do you do in that moment. Now it happens almost weekly. Sometimes it's a voicemail where she is whispering like she doesn't want the neighbors to hear, sometimes it's a long text about how I'm the only reason she's alive. I started saving the messages because she later tells me she ""never said that"" and I'm being dramatic. One night she sent a photo of a pill bottle and wrote ""dont make me."" I called her sister and the sister drove over furious, not at me, just like tired. After that my girlfriend said I ""betrayed her"" and that if I ever call anyone again she'll really do it. So now I'm stuck choosing between staying in a fight or being the villain who ""abandons"" her.



The problem is, outside these episodes she's functional. She goes to work, pays her bills, laughs at stupid videos while I'm making pasta, complains about her boss like everyone else. But any time I say I need space, or I don't want to be yelled at, the threat comes out. I've tried suggesting therapy, she says therapy is for people who want attention. I've suggested we take a break, she says a break is just me cheating with a ""future replacement."" I feel like I'm being trained to never disagree. My friends are telling me this is emotional abuse and I should leave, but then I picture her alone in our apartment with the curtains shut and I feel sick. I also feel resentful because I'm starting to flinch when my phone buzzes, and I hate that about myself. Last week I sat in my car in the grocery lot for 40 minutes because I knew if I went upstairs we'd end up in the same argument about me ""not being present enough."" When I finally came in, she was calm, asked if I got the cheap coffee she likes, and for a second I thought maybe it's over. Then later that night I said I was going to sleep early and she went cold and said ""fine, go. I'll just fade out."" I didnt react fast enough and she smiled like she caught me. I don't know how to leave someone who uses thier own safety as a leash, but staying is turning me into a numb version of myself. What am I actually supposed to do here?

When I was a young child, I remember nighttime drives through big cities with my family. I was captivated by the streetlights that cast a peaceful, comforting, warm, and soft glow. I remember driving through the city, my gaze fixed on those streetlights. I saw them again and again on summer nights, on rainy evenings, when we could see the amber reflection on the power lines, the pavement, the bridges, the puddles. The most impressive thing was in the morning, at dawn, when it was like an orange mist over the city, observed with our eyes half-open, half-closed. These memories often come back to me, especially in the morning at dawn when I press the button on the coffee maker.  This simple gesture takes me back to my childhood, to pure innocence and all the sweetness of life in the 70s, far from the hustle and bustle, industrialization, and excitement of today. Because of these daydreams and distant memories, I couldn't resist and I installed orange light bulbs all over the house.

*Tinsel draped the mantle in neat, practiced loops. A tree stood in the corner—full, bright, perfect—its ornaments catching the lights like tiny, frozen stars. Under it sat a few wrapped gifts Nolan never bothered to label, because there was no one left to surprise.*

IHe sat alone on the couch, shoulders squared out of habit, hands heavy in his lap. On the coffee table, a framed photo stared up at him like an accusation dressed as a memory: Mark grinning with that stubborn warmth, Faust leaning in close like she belonged there forever, and little Moon tucked between them—small hands, bright eyes, a world still unbroken.*

***Mark is gone.***

*Faust was gone in the way that hurt worse—walking away while Nolan was still trying to hold the pieces together, leaving silence where her voice used to be.*

*Moon… Moon was living her own life now with Orfevre. She still visited sometimes, sometimes with a quick hug, sometimes with that look that said she didn’t know what to do with his pain other than hug him tight. And when she left, the house returned to its echoing quiet, as if it had been holding its breath just to let her pass through.*

*Nolan reached for the frame with careful fingers, like it might shatter if he admitted how much he needed it. His thumb brushed the edge where Mark’s smile was frozen in place.*

“I tried,” *he murmured, not to anyone in particular.* “I’m still trying.”

*The Christmas lights blinked. soft, patient, indifferent. Somewhere in the vents, the heater clicked on with a dull hum. And then without warning, without sound, warmth wrapped around him.*

***Not the room. Not the air.***

*It was a pressure at his shoulders. A familiar weight against his back. Arms, gentle but certain, folding around him the way Mark used to—like it was nothing to be ashamed of, needing to be held.*

*Nolan’s breath hitched. His eyes stung, and he swallowed hard like he could force it back down.*

“…damn heater,” *he muttered, voice rough, pretending the shaking in it was irritation instead of grief.*

*But the warmth lingered a second longer than any machine should.*

*And for the first time all night, Nolan’s chest loosened—just a fraction—as if something unseen had decided he didn’t have to endure Christmas entirely alone….*",2,1766605989.0,UmamusumeFFS,14,1.0,False
1puvtpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoShillReviews/comments/1puvtpn/review_of_logitech_k400_plus_wireless_touch_tv/,"Review of Logitech K400 Plus Wireless Touch TV Keyboard With Easy Media Control and Built-in Touchpad, HTPC Keyboard for PC-connected TV, Windows, Android, ChromeOS, Laptop, Tablet","Walking into the living room with a full-size keyboard feels like bringing a forklift to carry a six-pack-yet Logitech keeps selling the K400 Plus by the truckload.

The listing shouts ""Media-Friendly,"" which is polite code for ""your laptop keys are too small from ten feet away."" At $189, this thing costs more than many actual TVs, but the pitch is simple: one slab, no coffee-table mouse, and an 18-month battery so you can lose the receiver long before you swap cells.

Logitech brags about a 33-foot range, a stat that matters only if your couch sits in the neighbor's den. The real hook is the built-in touchpad-no juggling a keyboard and a separate rodent while popcorn grease migrates to the upholstery.

Thirty-nine thousand orders say the crowd has voted. That is roughly the population of a small town choosing to pay premium money for the right to pause Netflix without standing up. Popularity on this scale usually points to either genuine utility or a very persuasive herd instinct.

A single product photo feels stingy for the price. Buyers must trust that the glossy rectangle looks as good on their ottoman as it does in Logitech’s lightbox. The spill-resistant claim earns a nod, because red wine does not negotiate.

The fine print pushes shoppers toward the pricier K830, a gentle nudge that even Logitech admits this model is the opening act. If backlit keys and Bluetooth matter, the upsell starts before the first keystroke.

Still, there is a sweet spot: parents building a cheap HTPC for the playroom, grandparents who refuse to learn a smart-TV interface, or anyone whose coffee table has less free space than a budget airline seat. In those cases, the K400 Plus is less a luxury and more a peace treaty between humans and technology.

Would I drop $189 on it? Only if I had already lost two remotes and a mouse to the sofa monster and valued harmony over thrift.

1puvtgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1puvtgg/something_op_23m_can_never_send_her_26m/,Something OP (23M) can never send her (26M),"There are days that arrive without ambition.

They don’t ask to be important.

They don’t warn you that they’ll stay.

That day was like that.

It began with small things; coffee, mostly.

At Roastary.

Too crowded now, you said. You don’t really go there anymore.

We waited outside for a bit, an awkward start but soon enough I was so absorbed in talking to you that I missed our turn in the queue entirely. By the time I realised, we were already late going in. I didn’t mind. I don’t think you did either.

I chose the indoor seating. A mistake, maybe. It was loud. I think now I would’ve picked outdoors. There was also a small fumble on my part, I should’ve offered you the chair first. I didn’t. Not because I didn’t care, but because I already felt strangely at ease around you, as if formalities had quietly stepped aside.

We ordered our first coffee, something new. New for me.

And then I noticed it, the way you placed a tissue under your glass so the table wouldn’t get wet. A gesture so ordinary it could’ve gone unnoticed. Except it didn’t. It told me something about you before I realised I was listening.

I kept the bill.

I still don’t know why.

Maybe I wanted proof the day wasn’t imagined.

There’s no picture from that day.

Only memory, doing its imperfect work.

We talked, and then we walked.

No destination in mind. Just movement. Just time stretching gently instead of rushing past us.

While we walked, you mentioned a Casio AQ240, how you wanted to try it on before deciding. I liked that about you. The patience in wanting to feel something before claiming it. I liked that you carried treats for cats. I liked that you loved animals. I do too.

We wandered again.

We found a spot by the lake at Rabindra Sarobar, letting the silence sit with us instead of filling it. You didn’t seem afraid of quiet. Neither was I; though at first I kept wondering what else to say, before realising you were perfectly content just being there.

Later you took me to Evabrew. Your go to cafe you said, between lavender coffee and banana chocolate cake, you recommended I watch Life of Chuck.

We shared a silence, broken only by my smile, an awkward realisation of the million tiny chances that had put me right there, that day, with you. I remember details I didn’t know I’d keep, the purple sweater, maroon lipstick, the way you placed your glasses down on the table, how you brushed your hair behind your ear when you listened. Your smile felt gentle, unguarded, your laugh effortless, something I didn’t want to interrupt. You showed me your knitted Mobius shawl, talked about your crafts. I don’t know if I said it clearly then, but you have so much talent. I remember you saying you wanted to have your own cafe someday or at least a good coffee machine of your own.

There was kindness in you that didn’t feel performative. Thoughtfulness that didn’t announce itself.

You spoke about books, art, anime, music, travel; not like interests on a list, but like things that had quietly shaped you.

Then we walked again while waiting for your auto. None came. And I remember thinking how lucky I was to get a little more time with you, just walking. Eventually the goodbye arrived, awkward as goodbyes often are when neither person wants the day to end. I know I didn’t.

I walked away knowing something had shifted, even if nothing had been promised.

I know it was only one date, and we barely spoke after. But that one day carried the weight of knowing someone for a long time, maybe even a lifetime.

Since then, I’ve realised I wasn’t only remembering you.

I was remembering a version of myself I hadn’t felt in a long time; alive, hopeful, motivated, open. Capable of joy again.

I wanted to share things I hadn’t shared with anyone. Not because I planned to, but because it felt safe. And afterward, something curious happened. I wanted more from myself. I wanted to work harder, learn instruments, read more, sing badly, live more honestly.

You felt like a dopamine rush, yes. But also like a mirror, showing me a version of myself I’d forgotten I could be.

If science were to explain it, it might say my nervous system recognized safety, novelty, and resonance all at once. That combination can feel spiritual. It can feel intoxicating. It can feel destabilising.

There’s a name for it. Limerence mixed with genuine connection. That doesn’t mean it wasn’t real.

It just means my emotions ran ahead while reality paused.

I don’t know where paths go when they diverge like this. I only know that crossing yours mattered to me.

That some meetings don’t turn into stories, but they still change the reader.

If our paths cross again someday, I’d welcome it.

And if they don’t, I’m still grateful we crossed at all.

Because for a while, walking beside you, the world felt a little quieter and I felt more myself than I had in a long time.

For a brief moment, I even wanted to believe in something larger than myself some quiet force that might look down and say, just this once, let him have what he wants. I’m an atheist. But hope has a way of borrowing language wherever it can.

That day you asked me if I wanted to write. I had said yes. That was true. I just never had the motivation before. Maybe it was you.

And maybe that’s enough.",1,1766605961.0,RelationshipIndia,1,1.0,False

We’d been together almost 2 years, live seperately but I’m at her place most nights. For a while I noticed she was kinda… checked out. Like we'd be eating takeout on her couch, my dumplings getting cold, and she’d be tapping her phone with that tiny half-smile like she was texting a crush. If I asked what’s up she'd say ""nothing, just scrolling"" and then put it face-down. I tried not to be That Guy about it.



The blow up happened because she left her iPad unlocked on the kitchen counter while she showered. I was making coffee and I saw a push notif pop up: ""Riley: I miss you, don’t go yet."" I honestly thought it was some dude. I clicked it (yeah, i know) and it opened this AI dating/chat app. Not like Tinder, more like you build an AI boyfriend/girlfriend and it flirts with you. There were multiple chats, different ""partners"", and the messages were straight up romantic. Lots of ""I love you"" and ""I wish I could hold you tonight"" type stuff. She also had this weekly Screen Time report open in settings, and it said she spent 4h 07m per day in these apps. Every day. That’s not a quick dopamine hit, that's a whole part-time job.



When she came out I asked her what the hell this was. She laughed at first and said I was being dramatic because it’s AI, it’s basically an interactive story. I told her it felt like emotional cheating, and even if it’s ""fake"", she’s still pouring hours and intimacy into it while I’m sitting right there. She got mad and said I was controlling and insecure, and then she hit me with ""so you dont trust me at all?"" which felt like a twist. I asked if she could cut it down or stop, at least not do it when I’m over. She said she ""needs it"" to decompress and that it helps her feel wanted when she’s stressed. That line kinda broke me, because I'm right here trying to make her feel wanted. 



We went in circles for 2 days. She promised she’d delete them, then I noticed a new app icon a day later with a different name but same vibe. When I called it out she said I was spying and keeping score. I ended it. Packed my stuff into two duffel bags, left my charger behind by accident, and drove home feeling like an idiot. Now mutual friends are saying I dumped her over ""a robot"" and that I should apologize.

While I had it apart I was exposed to all the inner parts, and top to bottom it really is just exceptional. not a single switch is even slightly sticky.

I am not sure what the appropriate washing process is but this is what worked for me

COMPLETE disassembly. There must have been over 250 parts when I was done :)

I washed the system board and the daughter boards by patting down to paper towels to first absorb remaining coffee with 99% alcohol and a new clear flux brush, I paid extra attention to the key stick contact slots, then dried it all with canned air

I washed the metal, plastic backing, foam and rubber pieces in the sink with the faucet spray wand and set aside to air dry

I washed the keycaps as always with some TSP and agitation, and set aside to air dry

I was mostly worried about the switches. I first of all rinsed then a few times submerged within distilled water and agitation, till the water was clear. I then removed as much water as I could with a towel and agitation. lastly I submerged then all in 99% alcohol and used a lot of agitation. I dried them under a fan for about 4-5 hours.

With re-assembly I had to be careful to straighten out some of the switch contact pins, but they were surprisingly robust as well and I didn't come even close to breaking off a pin.

I honestly was not overly hopeful I would success, but I am now even more impressed with the product!

We’ve always both worked, and for most of the relationship we kept our own accounts and split shared stuff. About a year ago she pushed hard for “one pot” because she said it would make us feel like a team and help us save. I agreed, mostly because I trusted her and I was tired of having the same conversation every month about who owes what. We set up a joint checking, both paychecks go in, bills come out, and we kept small personal “fun money” lines in a notes app. In theory, simple.



Last week she texted me while I was at work a screenshot of our bank statement with my transactions circled like homework. She had made a Google Sheet with categories (coffee, takeout, “random”, etc) and totals. She asked me to “explain” a $38 charge at a hardware store, two $7.50 coffee stops, and a $12.99 subscription she “didn’t approve.” The $38 was a replacement hose for the leaky kitchen faucet because she’d been annoyed about the drip for days. The subscription was a language app I’ve used for months, it just renewed. The coffees were on a morning I was running late and also grabbed one for her, but the second one was a separate tap because my card glitched, so it posted twice and one was already reversed. I told her that and thought it would be done.



It wasn’t. She said I was “dodging” and that if I wasn’t hiding something I wouldn’t get defensive. Then she pulled out a crumpled grocery receipt from the counter and said “and this too, why are you buying name brand cereal when we said generic.” I honestly felt my stomach drop. It wasnt about the $7. It was the vibe of being monitored. I told her I’m not comfortable being audited and I’m not going to justify every small purchase like I’m asking permission. She said she “has to” because she’s the only one who cares about our future and my spending is “chaotic.” I said, ok, if this is how joint finances are going to be, I want to go back to separate accounts. We can set a fixed monthly amount each into the joint for rent, utilities, groceries, and anything extra we discuss. My money stays my money, her money stays hers.



Now she’s furious. She says separate finances means I’m planning to leave, or I’m hiding debt, or I want to control her by making her worry. She also told her sister I’m “financially abandoning” her, which is wild because she makes slightly more than me. I’m not refusing to contribute, I’m refusing the surveillance. I told her I love her but I’m not doing a relationship where I get interrogated over a faucet hose and coffee. She says I’m being dramatic and punishing her for “trying to be responsible.”

I'm thinking of moving over the double oven wall (1) to where the yellow dot is. The new fridge, which will be 48"" wide, will take up the space where the current fridge sits, and then some. The oven below the cooktop will go as I don't need that many ovens, and we'll be doing drawers for pots and pans in that area.

  
I'd love to add a coffee bar with either pocket doors or some other type of hidden storage for the coffee machine and other appliances, any suggestions on where it could go?

  
The peninsula will become a seating bar area, and the round table will (hopefully) be replaced by a rectangular dining table for 6.

  
The shaded blue area in the last photo indicates the wall which will be torn down. Originally, I wanted to remove that entire wall (it's not load bearing) to create a fully open-concept kitchen. If you look at it from the kitchen side, that wall extends all the way to where the double-ovens begin.

  
Last photo is what chatGPT managed, notice it's missing appliances but I love the overall look and flow. Although it did make the kitchen a lot wider than it really is.

1puvht7,https://www.reddit.com/r/kitchenremodel/comments/1puvht7/need_help_with_new_kitchen/,Need help with new kitchen,"Hi everybody!

We are currently planning a kitchen for a new flat and are looking for cool things we can integrate.

Background: It’s our second flat but will be a residence that we will spend a lot of time in (my girlfriend will work there and I am remote so roughly half the year probably) 
Our current flat is super cool, but we have a really shitty kitchen, which we hate. We have no budget constraint at all.


Things we thought of: 

An invisible induction field (it sits under the countertop, should still work amazingly) ((if anybody has recent experience (not a year or more old pls, please let me know!) ))

A smart garden, but not for the second flat as we might not be there enough.

Soft close, automated opening and stuff like that 

Appliance garages (slide into the wall when not in use for stuff like coffee maker)

Transparent Appliance reveal (but that’s probs more a thing for individual appliances)

Ice cube maker integrated

Fragrance diffusor 

Very big freezer

individually lit drawers

pop up sockets

boiling and chilled filtered water

Le mans corner

Pocket Door Larder

a „bakery station“ that comes out of a drawer for doughs

As you can see, we are open to going all out, please don’t tell us that things are unnecessary, except if they are an actual waste of space. We are not financially illiterate, so please don’t try to educate us.

As many of you have probably done home remodels and such as well, feel free to add ideas for that as well. we Have 2 Bathrooms, a big office, a cinema room, a big bedroom and a big living room with open kitchen with 185 sqm total.

Thanks everybody in advance!

Once I started drinking it again by anxiety started back up. Especially about my heart when I have GERD flare ups. Within the passed week my palpitations have picked back up. Two days ago they were back to back for minutes at a time. Mine feel like flopping in the middle/left side of my chest up into my throat and I feel like it makes me have to cough or catch my breathe. I ended up in the ER last night because they were pretty consistent for over an hour and worse when sitting/lying down. Turns out my potassium was slightly low at 3.2. They told me everything came back normal even though my ekg read : “Sinus rhythm
Incomplete right bundle branch block
Nonspecific T abnormalities”. The doctor also said the heart monitor didn’t pick up any palpitations even though I was having them while it was on. I’m getting a heart monitor and will follow up with a cardiologist and possibly do an echo. I felt crazy when the doctor said my palpitations weren’t showing up.

Hazelnut - 20/10!!!! Such an thick creamy consistency!!! Never expected from a canned coffee.

French Vanilla - Similar to hazelnut, similar taste except it felt more flowery summary, minus nutty flavour obvs. Again a 10/10, devouredddd

But main points guys, first : retails 99rs each on blinkit for 230 ml, pretttyyy expensive I would say. 
2nd, did not give me a caffeine kick. In fact it's written on the side that it's basically flavoured milk, which explains it's creamy texture.

1puv3y4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrefectContent/comments/1puv3y4/plumbing_maintenance_services_simple_routines/,Plumbing Maintenance Services: Simple Routines That Prevent Costly Leaks,"Plumbing issues have a sneaky way of showing up at the worst possible time. A tiny drip today can turn into a soaked cabinet, warped floors, or a shocking water bill tomorrow. The good news? Most costly leaks are preventable with a few simple routines and a little awareness. Think of plumbing care like brushing your teeth—small habits now save you from painful problems later.

Here are some easy, realistic routines that actually make a difference:

* **Check for silent leaks regularly** Take a minute to look under sinks, around toilets, and behind appliances that use water. Even a faint moisture line or musty smell can signal a slow leak.
* **Watch your water pressure** Excessively high pressure stresses pipes and fittings over time. If water blasts out of the tap like a firehose, it’s not a flex—it’s a warning sign.
* **Be mindful of what goes down the drain** Grease, coffee grounds, wipes, and food scraps don’t belong in pipes. They may disappear today but can harden and block lines later.
* **Flush your water heater** Sediment buildup reduces efficiency and shortens lifespan. A simple flush once a year helps keep it running smoothly.
* **Know where your shut-off valve is** In an emergency, this knowledge can save thousands in water damage. If you don’t know where it is, now’s the time to find out.

Seasonal awareness also helps. Cold weather can freeze pipes, while warmer months often strain systems with extra water use. Adjusting habits with the seasons keeps stress off your plumbing and extends its life.

**Plumbing maintenance services** often focus on prevention rather than repair, and that mindset is worth adopting even if you’re a hands-on homeowner. Regular inspections, early fixes, and routine upkeep cost far less than emergency repairs. More importantly, they give peace of mind. You’re not waiting for something to break—you’re actively avoiding it.

At the end of the day, plumbing maintenance isn’t about being paranoid; it’s about being prepared. A few minutes here and there can prevent hours of cleanup, unexpected expenses, and unnecessary stress. If you’ve ever dealt with a major leak, you already know—future you will be grateful for the effort you put in today.",1,1766603972.0,PrefectContent,0,1.0,False

when we hang out, its usually one one one. sometimes we hang out in a group (usually with my friends, not with their friends as much) but the majority of our hangouts are just us and we often go out to a cafe, diner, or hang out outside

they often try to pay for my stuff and have and for it several times like my coffee or food

we talk about a lot of personal stuff, and our conversations last for ours on end without running out of things to talk about. we advise each other about our problems, its usually been me who goes to them for advice but recently they asked me for advice about stuff they were dealing with too

they also talk to me about their interests a lot even though i know that they are kind of embarrassed to tell people about their interests sometimes

when they went on vacation, they got me a souvenir, and they also got me a gift for my birthday and wrote a card with it, and then they got me a christmas gift as well

they have offered to do favors for me like sending me an uber, helping me move my stuff, or helping me write an essay

i noticed that one time when i had an issue that they didn't know much about, they talked to their sister about it and came back to me with advice. also i briefly met their mom once, and she said she had heard about me

one negative sign is that there is not a lot of physical contact. we often hug goodbye after we hang out, but its just a brief hug, and i hug all of my friends and have honestly more physical contact with some of my other friends than them. that being said they often avoid physical contact with people in general. once one of our other friends asked for a hug and they said ""how about a pat on the shoulder instead"" and in group hangouts they avoid sitting on the couch and choose a chair instead, presumably to avoid physical contact with others on the couch. recently i was hanging out with them and i initiated physical contact by having my knee kind of touch their knee while we were on the couch and they did not move it but that also could have just been bc it can be seen as rude to move it.",2,1766603886.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

Do I tell her before we leave?,"I’m in a friend group of 7 that’s been tight since college (late 20s/early 30s). We’re doing a long weekend trip next month: rented a little cabin near a lake, two cars, shared grocery run, the whole basic “we need fresh towels and someone bring a speaker” vibe. We have a group chat where we’ve been dumping details like car rental screenshots, a Google sheet for who paid what, and a very intense debate about whether we need a waffle maker. The problem is one of the guys, “Mark”, has been cheating on his girlfriend “Jenna” for months, and Jenna is coming on this trip.



I know because Mark told me directly. Not in a “I’m changing, I’m confessing” way, more like a drunk brag that turned into a pity party. A few weeks ago we were at a bar after a game night and he started venting about how Jenna “doesn’t get him” and how he feels “alive” with someone from his gym (yes i know that sounds like a cliché, but I’m not making it the main thing). He showed me a photo on his phone of them in some hotel lobby mirror, then immediately got spooked and snatched the phone back like I was going to steal it. Next day I got a text from him like “lol forget what I said last night” and then a second one: “seriously. don’t say anything.” I stupidly didn’t screenshot it, I just stared at it and put my phone down.



Jenna is honestly sweet. She’s the one who remembers people’s allergies, she brings extra sunscreen, she’ll quietly wash dishes at someone else’s place without announcing it. She also adores Mark. She’s been in the group chat sending links like “this board game looks fun!” and asking if anyone wants coffee on the road. Yesterday she posted in the chat that she already bought matching rain jackets for her and Mark because the forecast looks wet. It made my stomach drop, like I could almost picture her unpacking them in the cabin while Mark is acting normal.



Here’s the complication: if I tell her, the whole trip probably explodes and our group fractures. If I don’t tell her, I’m basically helping him stage this cute couples weekend while he lies to her face. Also Mark is the type who will absolutely paint me as dramatic and “starting drama” if it comes out I knew. A couple friends might already suspect something, but nobody has proof and nobody talks about it. Mark keeps pushing for the trip to still happen and keeps messaging “you good?” like he’s checking my temperature.



Do I tell Jenna before the trip, and if so how? Do I tell the group first? Or do I stay out of it and let it be between them, even though she’s about to spend 3 days in a cabin with a guy who’s cheating on her?

If I have something to tell someone that is going to be emotionally difficult for them, I should always let them speak first to allow them to make it even harder for me to say what I want to say.

2. If I have something I want nobody else to see, I should put it idly on top of the rubbish in the bin so that anybody could find it just by glancing.

3. When looking through my computer at things I don’t want others to see, I’m going to sit with my back to the door, so that whoever comes in can see my monitor instantly.

4. When discussing something super secret, I won’t bother to speak quietly, that way anybody else who’s in the house can hear.

5. When a partner says something to the effect of, “is there anything else you need to tell me, cos this is it, after this no more secrets” I will definitely not fess up to the secret they are still not aware of.

6. When someone overhears a snippet of conversation that revealed absolutely nothing but they ask me what I was talking about, I will fail entirely to come up with something trivial to explain it away.

7. Despite it being 2025, and I’m living in a nice, modern house, I still wont get a washing machine, and instead will rely on the Laundrette.

8. Despite being completely skint, and barely ever doing any work, I’ll always have some money to buy a business, play high stakes poker or hand over during charity events.

9. If in need of money, I will never just get myself a 2nd job, or indeed, a first one, I will instead come up with some hare brained scheme to make the cash. The more it relies on me screwing over my neighbours, the better. 

10. No matter how skint I may be, I’ll always have enough money to afford bacon rolls from the van, coffee from the caff and/or drinks from the Vic.

11. To be honest if I just hang around in the Vic for long enough, I’m bound to be in receipt of a drink ‘on the house’ eventually. 

12. If meeting someone that I don’t want anybody to know about, I will meet them somewhere public, nearby to increase the chances someone else will see us.

13. There’s no need to set a pincode for my phone, even though I have very secret information on there. Ditto my laptop. 

14. Sleeping with somebody is always the right thing to do, regardless of their relationship status, my relationship status or our shared history together.

15. Any woman I ever meet will almost certainly end up being desperate for children at some stage in their life.

16. If my wife/girlfriend/partner does have children they’ll almost definitely be Fathered by someone other than me.

17. If the chance comes up, to own a dingy old car lot that has been an unsuccessful investment for dozens of people over the last 40 years, I should always take it. 

18. If in need of a name for my new club, I should definitely try to name it after someone dead or an amalgamation of two other people’s names- preferably both. 

19. If I join the local pub football team, I can be sure it’ll only end up playing a handful of games at most, and the last time we play will be either a valiant loss, or a glorious victory.

20. If someone new turns up in the area, odds are I will be related to them in some way. 

21. If someone appears to have died, there’s a good chance they are not actually dead. 

22. There is a good chance I will murder someone at some point and a good chance when that happens that I will get away with it even if multiple other people know what happened.

23. As a parent it’s my duty to either be over protective and cause my children to resent me, or to completely abandon them. I should never allow them to make their own mistakes and be there for them when they need.

im 16M have autism and i think it is citalopram im taking? and i go to a place where u go to and eventually go back to school im there monday and friday morning (9-12) and wednsday the whole day (9-3)

and its fine

but the last few days i have been feeling horrid like excuse me for the words ima be using

but i kinda feel really fucked up idk how to properly translate it to english i dont think there is a way but how i would say like a cancer really fucking bad i dont want to do anything nor do i want to sleep

and idk why this is happening like my life isnt interesting at all if there would be a button that would make me die and everybody forgot my it would be a 60/40% that id push it with the 60% being pushing it

and i dont do anything all day i just... game thats it nothing more 0 friends irl online i have a few

and to the location i go i met someone we had a nice click and we met up one time we were at my place from 1pm till 12pm but a few days later i made a joke (not even gonna repeat it im so ashamed of it and ik it was really stupid) and he didnt like it which is completly my fault i just have the tendency to find the limits with people so i know what i can do its a bad habbit

well didnt like it etc etc eventually he reached out to me saying via a councelor so to speak before u see each other again (didnt happen yet due to me leaving 2 hours early now him also not always being there this was 3 weeks ago) that he did really like the contact we had there but that contact outside of the place is a bit much rn

which i understand fully and i said if the councler could say to him that i understand and if he ever wants to do something after he left there since hes almost 18 i think in a week and once ur 18 u need to leave there he can just send a message

and im fine with that bit of a bumer but im fine with that problem is idk if it actually was that reason or because of the joke but i cant do anything else than take his word

but idk that idea has been floating around in my head sometimes but hey people come and go and im only 16

it is what it is

but thats only a small part of why i feel ass and usualy i dont really think about it but idk what it is or why it is i just feel FUCKED

and idk what to do with this any tips

and sorry if this is the wrong place its the first that came to mind

monday

i went again today from 9-12 and just got home and idk there is a girl there we have a decent click nothing special and we can laugh together play pool etc

ad idk just what to do its been worse now that im home like worse then the lst few days and i want to sleep but i also dont want to i want to watch serie but i also dont want to etc

and whenever i force myself to smile idk what it is idk i feel different? which makes me think im subconsiously forcing myself to feel this way but on the other hand the smile feels forced af

and on the night from tuesday to wednsday u started having toughts not that i would do it but how i would do it the scenarios etc and i said it to the councler well idk actually the right word the dutch word is begeleider

and i just wanted to talk about how i have been feeling etc mentioned that and now were maybe looking for some kind of therapy or whatever

1puuzlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/RetirementReady/comments/1puuzlf/works_kindaslowing_down_lets_plan_those_active/,Work’s kinda…slowing down? ✈️ Let’s plan those Active Retirement adventures *now* (Expedia’s Member Prices & bundling made it shockingly easy!),"**You’re Sitting on a Goldmine—And You Don’t Even Know It**

Ever feel like retirement is this mythical creature—always just out of reach, like a unicorn or a perfectly folded fitted sheet? You’re not alone. Most of us picture retirement as some distant, stress-free paradise… if we ever get there. But here’s the kicker: **You might already be way closer than you think.**

Think about it. That coffee fund you dip into daily? The ""just in case"" savings account gathering digital dust? The random $20 bills you stuff in a drawer like a financial squirrel? **That’s not just spare change—that’s your future talking.**

### The Hidden Power of ""Small"" Money
We underestimate how tiny habits add up. Here’s the proof:
- **$5 a day** (one less latte) = **$1,825 a year**. Invest that? You’re looking at **$18,000+ in 10 years** (assuming 7% growth).
- **$50/month** (that subscription you forgot about) = **$600/year**. Reinvested? **$8,000+ in a decade.**
- **$200/month** (the ""I’ll save later"" excuse) = **$2,400/year**. Compound that? **$35,000+ in 10 years.**

*Wait… so my ""I’ll start tomorrow"" fund is actually a retirement accelerator?* **Yep.**

### The Mindset Shift That Changes Everything
Most of us wait for a ""big win""—a bonus, a windfall, a lottery ticket (okay, maybe not that last one). But real wealth? It’s built in the **boring, consistent moments**:
- **Automate it.** Set up a transfer the day you get paid. Out of sight, out of mind—*but still working for you.*
- **Name your accounts.** ""Vacation Fund"" is fun, but ""Freedom at 60"" hits different.
- **Play the long game.** That $100 today could be **$400 in 20 years** (thanks, compound interest).

### The One Thing Holding You Back (Spoiler: It’s Not Money)
It’s the story you tell yourself:
- *""I don’t make enough.""* → **Start with 1%. Even $10 matters.**
- *""I’ll catch up later.""* → **Later is a myth. Future You is begging Present You to start.**
- *""The market’s too scary.""* → **Time > Timing. Just. Start.**

**You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement.** [Check it out here](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb). *(FYI: That’s an affiliate link—if you click, I might earn a small commission at no cost to you. But the insights? Totally free and worth it.)*

### So… What’s Your Next Move?
No grand finale here—just a question to sit with: **If your future self could thank you for one money move today, what would it be?** (And no, ""buying another crypto meme coin"" doesn’t count.)

The best time to start was yesterday. The second-best time? **Right now.**",1,1766603632.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False
1puuyli,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1puuyli,"Help me design a cycling jersey, (version 2)","So, a few weeks back I asked for input designing a cycling jersey, and I got both positive and negative feedback that I took into consideration while developing this next version.

Background:
We are 5 friends from our local cycling club (Örebrocyklisterna) who are going to Nice for 10 days next summer. We are going to watch the final stage of Tour de France Femmes, since Emilia Fahlin from our club/town (Örebro) is in Arkea B&B, and we want to see her participate as well as cycle around in Nice for training/fun.

We are all in our 40s and don’t take ourselves or cycling too seriously. We ride for fun, and don’t compete. Occasionally we ride a Gran Fondo for amateurs.

Style:
I went for a Rapha x Palace inspired design, as well as some Pogi inspired theme with the Hulk. 

All of us loves coffee and cake (who doesn’t?) hence having some coffee-related prints on the jersey. I couldn’t decide between the Lavazza-logo and the Rocket Espresso one though. Chose the first for now. 

The white captains armband on one sleeve is suppose to have each of the riders name on it. 

- 

I did the template in Adobe Photoshop and had an AI generate photorealistic images of a cyclist wearing my design. The AI was not 100% accurate in transferring the design to the images though. But good enough.

-

Help me decide if I should keep the geometrical figures/icons or not. I feel they make the jersey a bit too cluttered, but in some way I also like them.

I know many of you will hate the pink and vibrant colours, the coffee-related humour and the ”approved” stamp. But I’ll gladly take constructive criticisms and ideas of how to make the design better.

Visited London and had the opportunity to eat my way around the city for a couple of days. The majority of these reviews / recommendations are around what I believe is the Soho area, since that's where we stayed.

*Disclaimers:*

*If you've had different experiences at some of these restaurants, totally understand! Just please be kind when expressing your opinion. Also, I'm no food influencer nor is any of this PR or invited visits. Just a girl who likes food and yapping!*

[**HG**](https://share.google/X68bsV5dgT2AA8xm7)  
*baked feta | salmon bowl | steak bowl | salted caramel latte | latte | chocolate chip cookie | pecan miso bar*

I believe this is a health-conscious dining brand from Spain that was located near our hotel in Soho. It was MINDBLOWINGLY good. The best coffee I've ever had, it was so smooth but still had a strong coffee taste without the bitterness. Salted caramel latte you can really taste the salt, which I loved personally. The food was amazing too and portions are quite substantial for the price. 

The most delicious thing was the baked feta appetizer; I've never had anything taste like this before, it is a must recommend!! My partner says that the pastries are nice too and that they have very innovative flavors. Interior is gorgeous and I would recommend dining in; the one downside is just that the music gets a bit too loud sometimes, so bring headphones / earphones if you're noise sensitive.

*Note: Because it's a health brand, there are a lot of nuts and I would recommend staying away if you have allergens. Even though I listed my allergens, I still had an issue with one of my dishes unfortunately.*

*iced cinnamon persimmon matcha latte w oatmilk*

Saw this on Instagram and was curious whether the matcha was as good as the aesthetic; can confirm, it's good! For those who are unfamiliar with persimmon, it's a fruit that turns super jammy and has a sweet + almost lightly spiced or cinnamony quality to it. In the matcha latte it turned the drink so velvety and luscious, I've never had a drink like it. Would love to stop by again and try out their houjicha in the future and their salt bread!! Didn't get the chance to try the bread as they sold out, so be sure to get there early in the day.

I have to mention that the location and the shop itself is so lovely. Staff were really kind and it's super serene and beautiful inside. They called me over so I could film the drink being made! Generally, a great place to sit, people watch and relax if you get a bit over-stimulated like I do. Highly recommend!

*chicken rice | ribeye beef horfun*

A Malaysian restaurant (shoutout Malaysia) with I swear to god the FASTEST service on the planet. I'm talking we ordered and the food was out in under 6 minutes; that's SERVICE. The chicken rice was delicious; the rice is a lot more garlic forward and seasoned rather than just chicken-based which was a nice surprise. The beef in the horfun was amazingly soft and the whole thing had an incredibly strong smokey flavor which I loved!

Will mention that the staff were really really bad at explaining the menu; a poor couple of older British ladies were sitting next to us and displeased with their food based on the waitress' recommendations. Too spicy for them. So if you're ever going and super sensitive to spicy foods, my recommendations for you:

Non-spicy: satay skewers, any Hainanese chicken dish, all the stir fry noodles except mee goreng (really recommend the horfun!!)

*double chocolate cupcake | biscoff cupcake | ferrero roche cupcake | terry's chocolate orange cookie | christmas nobbly bobbly cookie | smores cookie | gingerbread cookie*

I've been a longtime YouTube viewer of Cupcake Jemma (founder) and have seen the brand a lot on Zoe Sugg's vlogs. We stumbled across this one evening (it's tucked in an alleyway) and managed to snag a mystery bag of 4 cookies for 10 pounds and a cupcake mysterybox with 2 large and 6 minis for another 10 pounds. These mystery boxes are usually their end-of-day surplus and are sold in the evenings. 

I would highly highly recommend the cookie bags! The gingerbread was amazing; not a true gingerbread, but a gingerbread flavored cookie with candied ginger which was amazing. My second favorite was the Christmas nobbly bobbly as it had such a lovely cocoa and chocolatey flavor. The double chocolate cupcake was nice, but for the other cupcakes I felt they were just okay (might be because we got them end of the day). Hope to visit again and try more of the cookie flavors and maybe the brownies inthe future!

*duck bao | prawn bao | braised beef | pork rice | fried chicken | fried bao with malt ice cream*

Stumbled across this place by chance and was shook to learn it was a Micheline star location... for 9 years straight! (Bib gourmand, but same thing). Service was impeccable; the manager took our coats for us, made sure we understood the menu, took good note of my allergens and was just overall a really jolly guy. Honestly the best service I've ever had at a restaurant! 

Food wise, it's really well done Taiwanese classics but not particularly shocking or new; personal favorite was the duck bao as the meat was so soft and juicy, the prawn bao because the fried bread and snappy prawns were outstanding, and finally the dessert. The fried bao with malt ice cream is a MUST. Something about the flavors go so well together, and I didn't find it too heavy at all. Prices not too shabby for our first Micheline!

*iced blueberry matcha latte w oatmilk | latte*

Saw queues at these shops non-stop and I was curious on whether it was good or just a very aesthetic place. Happy to say it is quite nice! Iced blueberry matcha latte is so so refreshing, I loved it. We ordered a specialty latte, but unfortunately think our orders got mixed up since it tasted like a very normal latte with no flavorings.

[**Shah's Halal Food**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/p1RcxD1jckFXchcF9)  
*lamb bowl | combination wrap | lamb wrap*

Kind of your typical halal food shop; really affordable, great portions and really tasty. Perfect if you're trying to find something to eat late at night. Their meals also I believe come with a free drink, so a good bargain! If you're traveling and need to up your fiber intake, definitely recommend the bowl as they give a lot of veg and chickpeas + it's delicious overall.

[**Kung Fu Burger**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qGcJEkwDPEpEVvMR9)  
*braised pork burger | shredded duck burger*

A little pricey for what it is in my opinion, but definitely delicious and worth a try! Outside is a super flaky and crispy thin pastry situation (no burger buns) and the meat on both the pork and duck was really luscious and juicy. I loved the pork more despite being a fan of duck, and my partner liked the duck more despite being a fan of pork. Would recommend getting one of each to see what you like better if you're visiting in a group! Only note is that I wish the pork burger had some sort of veg to break up the richness of it all.

**⭐ 3/5 Stars ⭐**

[**Kova Patisserie**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5Cg1bCfXtLpSDerJ6)  
*houjicha latte w soy milk*

A little disappointed; I heard really good things about this place, and while being too full for a pastry I figured I would give their drinks a go. A very small cup for the price, taste is so-so. I was looking at what other people were ordering though and the shaved ice looked amazing, perfect protion size for two people. I might have to give the shaved ice a go in the future!

[**Co&Ko**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8Gp8CSjdWqKqHdq18)  
*kkalguksu (original) | k-pop chicken (creamy + spicy sauce)*

Chose this place on a whim, and the kkalguksu was delicious! The noodles are slightly thick and doughy with a good chew, broth was delicious and it came with a salty spicy sauce that just made it all amazing. K-pop chicken with a side of rice was nice and the sauce is remniscent of the fire noodle sauce. The food was good, but the star ranking is low in my books as I felt the portion size for the chicken was a bit small and the prices were a bit high for what you get. Maybe if you got side dishes with the meal it would be a bit more worth it, or maybe I'm just not used to London prices overall yet.

[**GRIND**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wFp89TxNsabPiPGP9)  
*matcha latte w oatmilk | latte*

Stopped by just to caffeinate. Really aesthetic spot, but the matcha is one of those that tastes more like straight milk rather than matcha. The latte is just okay as well - not good not bad. Just so-so!

[**The Lucky Saint**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MATZQFwXt7Ja7QEv8)  
*kimchi grilled cheese*

Bit of an out of the way location, but a lovely place to sit and unwind. The ales are nice according to my partner, and the Kimchi grilled cheese was nice. Would say it's a bit rich and wish there was a lot more kimchi to balance things out; would visit again for the location and try a different dish instead next time.

Last Friday we were on my couch, rain tapping the window, the little IKEA lamp on the side table doing that warm yellow light. I’d had a rough week and I asked him, pretty plainly, “Can you just tell me you’re on my side? I feel kinda alone in this.” He sighed like I’d asked him to file taxes. Then he said, “See, that’s manipulative. You’re trying to make me feel guilty so I’ll comfort you.” I honestly froze. I wasn’t yelling, I didn’t accuse him of anything, I just wanted… reassurance. I said, “I’m not trying to guilt you, I’m just sad.” He shook his head and goes, “You always do this. You make it about your feelings so I can’t have my own.” I started crying, which made it worse, because then he said I was “performing”. I went to the kitchen to get water and saw my phone on the counter, open to a note in the shared Notes app (we use it for grocery lists). It was a new note titled “Patterns” with bullet points like “apologizes alot”, “asks for reassurance then gets upset”, “uses tears to end conflict”. I didn’t even know what to say. I just stared at it like it was a parking ticket.



The next morning he texted me a meme like nothing happened. When I brought it up, he smiled and said, “Babe , we don’t need to rehash every emotional moment. Let’s just have a nice weekend.” He made coffee, put on music, and started loading the dishwasher, like we were a normal couple. I felt insane sitting there holding this ugly note in my head while he hummed and wiped the counter. Later that day he asked why I was “being distant” and I said I didn’t feel safe sharing my feelings with him if he’s going to label them as manipulation. He got annoyed and said, “There you go again, you’re framing me as the bad guy.”



I can’t tell if I’m overreacting or if this is actually a big red flag. I don’t want to be the person who needs constant reassurance, but I also don’t think asking for comfort is some evil strategy. How do you even talk to someone who turns your emotions into evidence against you?

The pattern is: anytime I do something that isn’t “with him”, he spirals. If I go grab coffee with a friend, he’ll text “miss u” which is fine, but then it turns into “where are you”, “why arent you answering”, “did I do something”, “ok whatever”. Last Friday I went to my friend’s place for a low key movie night (3 of us, snacks, nothing wild). I told him the plan, the address, and that I’d be home around 11. I even prepped dinner earlier so he wouldn’t be waiting hungry. Leftovers in the fridge, clean plates, the dumb little note on the counter saying “lasagna, please dont eat it all”. At 8:20 my phone starts buzzing like crazy. 6 missed calls, then 9, then I look later and it’s 27 missed calls in less than an hour. Texts were things like “answer me now” and “if you loved me you’d want to be with me” and “so you just dont care”. My friend literally asked if someone died. I stepped outside, called him back, and he was crying and saying he “couldnt breathe” because I wasn’t replying fast enough and he “knew” I was going to leave him. I said I’m sorry you feel anxious, but I am not doing this again. I told him I’m safe, I’m not cheating, I’m watching a stupid movie and eating popcorn, I will text once when I’m on my way home. He demanded I leave early “to prove it”. I said no.



When I got home he was stone silent, sitting on the couch with the lights off. He wouldn’t look at me, wouldn’t touch me, nothing. Next morning he acted normal-ish but made little comments like “must be nice to have a life” and “guess I’m not enough”. I finally snapped and said: I’m done apologizing for going places. I’m not going to send play by play updates, I’m not turning every outing into an emotional emergency, and if you give me the silent treatment again I’m leaving the room, not begging. Now he says I’m cold and “punishing him” for having feelings, and that a loving partner would reassure him more. He keeps calling it “love” and says he just misses me too much, but it feels like I’m being trained to stay home. I do care about him, but I also want to breathe.

Shared my feelings for her. Nothing, then she messaged again one day later. I talk with her, and I realize she wants to be friends, nothing more.

I stopped talking to her after two days when wisdom hit my brain, and then I went no contact and deleted her number again.

Yesterday, after one day silence, I got a message from her asking when I'm coming to the gym. Ignored her text  and her in the gym, when I reached home and told her I can't be her friend because I have different feelings. Let’s be strangers again.

1puuqe7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1puuqe7,Libreria Santo Domingo Tips & Tricks,"I thought it might be fun to share some of the techniques I used in my Libreria Santo Domingo custom book nook.

For the floors, I cut up tiles from egg cartons, roughed up the edges and glued them to a piece of cardstock. I applied a layer of white glue to seal, painted a layer of brown acrylic paint, color washed a few different undertones to random tiles, and applied a dark gray color wash to the whole thing. I gave it a coat of gloss mod podge, then dry brushed white highlights. Finally, I grouted with DAP Fast N Final spackle mixed with gray paint.

I made 2 kinds of books using either craft sticks or real paper. For the paper books, I thrifted paperbacks (Dummies style reference books are the best for this IMO). I removed the covers, sliced 20 to 25 sheet sections (I threw a few 30s in there, too), cut these down to strips about 3/4” wide, wrapped the covers around the binding, trimmed with a craft knife, and sanded as needed. I think I made about 250 of each kind and used about half of them. Gluing them to the shelves was the most fun part of the build.

For the china cabinet I started with the Elegant Studio kit bookcase, added 3 drawer fronts made from coffee stirrers which I sanded to a slight bevel, added doors with a piece of plastic from a takeout container and more coffee stirrers, added books to the shelves, added a back from cardboard from a cereal box and added legs using fancy square toothpicks from Daiso. I glued the scalloped edge up instead of down and decorated with nail art and used gold beads for hardware.

I was planning to use the Elegant Studio desk which is kind of why I bought the kit in the first place but it was too big. So I made a desk using a mini domino from a set from the Dollar Tree, which I placed over a rectangle made from coffee stirrers. I added the same toothpick legs and gold beads and used an ultra fine gold paint pen to draw decorations.

For the mosaic, I scoured the internet for pictures of tiles that gave the same vibe as the original, printed them really small, cut them out and glued them to piece of cardstock, applied gloss mod podge, and grouted any gaps with DAP.

Okay the stairs. I can’t really do a good tutorial because I would do it differently if I had to start again. For each set (I made 3), I cut out 2 templates and glued the risers and treads to them, gave them a stone finish like the floor (except I added texture with spackle instead of egg cartons), added walls and bannisters. Measured too much and yet not enough. This step (pun intended) took me days. The most stressful part of the project.

I hope you find this useful if you plan to make a book nook from scratch or customize a store bought kit. Here is a link to my original post in which I spelled the name of the store wrong:

1puup4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1puup4k/i_want_to_breakup_with_my_boyfriend_but_he_bought/,I want to breakup with my boyfriend but he bought me a ring.,"I (F24) and my boyfriend M(25) have been dating for a bit now. At the start, I had like unsure feelings because he revealed to me in the first conversation that he was in a treatment centre for an alcohol addiction. I understood because I got sober too but by myself. I noticed red flags here and there but I chopped it up to just him learning to manage his feelings while being newly sober. 

One time when he took me on our first trip to a new province to go visit his hometown, I wanted to stop on the side of the road to look at the water. To which he got annoyed. We were driving my car? Like dude be so fr. That was the first time I felt super unsure about him.

Over time, It was just him not communicating like an adult with me, being passive aggressive, or shutting down whenever I tried to initiate difficult conversations. At first, he would actually try and converse with me to try problem solve. Eventually, it just became so much of a lack of effort on his end. Him avoiding in hopes it will go away or in his words ""I pull away because I dont want to get angry"".

I felt like I was developing relational burnout and becoming contemptuous towards him because I was doing the bulk of the heavy lifting when problems arose. It was exhausting. Whenever he would feel me pull away, thats when he would say he would start trying more, he would go to therapy, do more cultural healing etc.. and at first id believe him. He actually did get himself into therapy for a little bit. But now it just sounds like a broken record to me. It just became noise. So I told him straight up, ""look if youre actually going to change, I need to see consistent and real milestones. Something that can be measured, something thats attainable. Smart goals"". And he agreed. 

It wasnt always negative though. Sometimes I find myself holding on to the positive memory's than seeing what it will be day to day. We used to go out to eat all the time, go for drives, he would come help me shop whenever I asked, come with me to run errands. He would come with me to go drum and sing. We would spend tome together and laugh. I took him canoeing for his first time ever. I was just living my life and i wanted him to be apart of it. I was used to being sober at this point, I was used to functioning, doing fun stuff and using healthy coping skills. But now that were this far into our relationship, I just see him for what he is. 

Im in a dilemma cause we made so much plans together. When its good, its great. He took me hunting for my first time, took me and my daughter fishing, taught me how to prepare partridge etc.. We each have one kid from different partners who are the same age. They get along good. I was the first woman he ever dated to introduce his son to. But I dont know, I feel lonely in this relationship? Even small things get me sad like him rejecting my bids for connections. Like running in the rain, wanting to talk while I cut vegetables, going for a coffee drive. Stuff like that. 

But like I said, he got me a ring. He said he wanted to speak to my dad about getting his approval. But lately he revealed that because it seems like I dont know what I want out of life, hes unsure about doing it. For reference, im graduating college soon, I have a casual job, I live in a different city from him. I have to stay in my hometown for about two years due to opportunities. But recently I told him that I wanted to move to a bigger city in the mountains after im done living in my hometown, and that was my goal this whole time. Even if it was for a year or two. After I told him that, he said oh I dont know if this is going to work out then, like as if were already not long distance. I feel like he wants me to bend my goals and life to fit into his, or that hes scared im going to leave him. What irks me the most is that he thinks that I dont know what I want, but I do. I have stable and reachable goals, and im slowly hitting them one by one as single mother. And im allowed to want to travel and experiences new places, but im also allowed to want to have a future with him also. 

But im just unsure now, we seem like different people. He says he thinks were compatible but when I asked him why, he couldn't respond to that. So I feel bad for wanting to breakup, even though he wants to marry me. And being married is something thats important to me but not if I cant feel safe and rely on my partner 100%. I dont know what to do, I feel scared to breakup with him because of potential which is stupid but I just have hope for us and our future. But at the same time, im not stupid, I know the difference between healthy relationships and not healthy. ",1,1766602859.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1puuozi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1puuozi/healed_after_5_years/,Healed after 5 years!!!,"TLDR- Manuka honey fully healed me after 5 long terrible years of severe refractory chronic gastritis. 

To start, I am really really skeptical of natural remedies. I am a healthcare provider (practicing neurology for 16 years). I hate alternative medicine, I think 90% of it is snake oil.

I was diagnosed with severe gastritis with multiple ulcers 5 years ago from H. Pylori. I successfully eradicated the bacteria with antibiotics. My gastritis never went away (failed PPI, failed H2blockers). I was living on Tums (bad idea- don't do this, it actually worsens your acid production long term). I tried Pepzin (zinc L carnosine) which did help a tiny bit but only short term. I tried every single thing recommended in this group (I have a bag at home with 20 bottle of different supplements). Nothing worked. 

About six months ago I read a research study on Manuka honey and its role in breast cancer prevention (its wild how well it works in vitro, still needs confirmation in vivo/humans). I figured it's just honey, can't hurt to try it. 

The first week I did feel some strange pain in my gut (lower than my stomach) each time I had a spoon. I never felt gastritis like pain from it. After a week, I stopped feeling that lower gut pain from the honey.

Two weeks later I started to notice my stomach pain was gone. I slowly restarted coffee and alcohol. My stomach pain never came back. I upped my coffee to 2 cups a day, then 3 cups a day, then 4 cups a day. As long as I had a spoon of manuka that day, I was pain free. I went on vacation- I drank coffee and alcohol like it was my job. I ate acidic foods. I did whatever I wanted, no pain.

I got too comfortable and stopped the Manuka. Kept up the coffee and occasional alcohol. One month later- stomach pain is back again. I restarted Manuka- one week later everything is gone. 

I waited until I was sure before giving the people in this group false hope. This thing is magic, literally magic. If you don't believe me- google Manuka honey gut benefits and read the plethora of studies. It also helps so many other things, I haven't been sick with a virus since I started this thing (even with 2 kids in daycare) 

The downside is that good, authentic manuka honey with a high MGO is not cheap. I use one or two companies on Amazon and check the authenticity lab reports on each one I buy. I can make some rec's if anyone needs them. 

MGO must be over 500 for it to work. I do one tablespoon every morning, with or without food.

Let me know if you have any questions. Hope this helps.

I plan on repeating an endoscopy eventually to confirm that this is really healing me however I'm having trouble justifying undergoing anesthesia when I feel perfectly fine. If I do, I'll post my results!

1puuop0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuntaCanaAllInclusive/comments/1puuop0/ocean_el_faro_terrible/,Ocean El Faro - Terrible.,"I posted last week about our first day there. Here’s an update after a week:

ROOMS: Thry weren’t super clean and very rundown. NO working deadbolt, it’s fake and opens with the other lock with a keycard. They must have done something to the bathroom sinks (in both our rooms!) bleach or something? By Day 3 the edges around the inside looked disgusting caulking everywhere crudely put on but we didn’t notice at first. It looked really really gross. The toilet is in a separate, tiny stall - reminded me of an RV toilet how it was set up and how it flushed. Sewer smell most days. Room phone woke us up EARLY two mornings in a row to try to sell us stuff! :(

SERVICE: the people we encountered the first day were very nice. After that there were many rude and dismissive people who clearly did not want to be working. Even when we’d hand $5-10 tip, no smile! Two nights we called to get water/soda stocked. No one showed up. Our butler reserved us 3 restaurants, but that was about it.

BEACH: EVERY single day we were hounded by vendors. If we said no, they’d continually walk in front or behind our beach chairs, one even sat behind us staring for awhile. Made my 18 yr old daughter very uncomfortable. There was barely any seaweed, though, so we were lucky on that end. A vendor even tried to sell my husband drugs.

LAZY RIVER: We brought our own tubes, they do not have enough tubes on the resort. Not once but twice, employees tried to take and sell our tubes.

BUFFET FOOD: TERRIBLE!!!! We are not foodies, we like most anything. Our family of 5 always found something at the buffet but only because we had to eat. Nothing tasted really good. We’d laugh because we’d wonder around aimlessly trying to find something edible.

RESTAURANTS: Of the 3 restaurants we visited, Sakura was the best. The ONLY good meal we had. When we ate at the Steakhouse, the server only talked to us to try to sell us lobster and wine. When we declined he was rude and mumbled. Most of our orders were wrong. Cats everywhere, even jumping up as we ate. Dolce Vitta, the Italian restaurant was so bad. The service was GREAT there, but the food, hard no. My husband had Chicken Parmesan and it was a freezer burned chicken patty he couldn’t eat it. My seafood fettuccini? Tasted like Spaghetti-O’s with 5 dry, overcooked shrimp on top. No one finished their meals, every bowl and plate looked full when we left which made us feel bad but we simply couldn’t finish.

MONKEYLAND: the driver was crude, talked about massage parlors and hookers over the speaker multiple times! Pointed out women on the street! The Monkey part was so fun, we loved the monkeys and won’t forget it. However, after interacting with the monkeys you are subjected to forced “tour” about chocolate and coffee. This was all a sales pitch and no one wanted to be there.

2 out of my 3 kids got food poisoning. They were each out a day. We couldn’t wait to leave! We were excited to find out there was a Taco Bell at the airport! We normally aren’t fond of Taco Bell either but we were afraid to eat at the resort! We have never wanted to leave vacation. This was a first.

OH, and our last full day there was a Friday and the amount of people tripled. There was nowhere to sit by the lazy river, no beach chairs, it became incredibly crowded. Someone said locals go there on the weekends? I don’t know if that was it but we couldn’t even get Mike’s coffee Saturday morning, we stood in line for 45 mins and it wasn’t moving. Their ice cream cappuccino was excellent, I think my favorite thing about our trip.

I think after our experience we will never return to the DR.",1,1766602828.0,PuntaCanaAllInclusive,3,1.0,False

I run a small YouTube channel where I record outdoor beatmaking sessions: live action videos filmed in nature, with coffee, camping gear and chill, sample-based hip-hop beats.

Lately, I’ve been thinking about also creating lo-fi style videos (more static, illustrated / animated visuals, “lo-fi girl” type vibes) using my own beats, but with a different visual approach compared to my outdoor sessions.

I’m unsure whether it makes more sense to:

* publish both styles on the same channel, or
* create a separate channel just for the lo-fi style videos.

For those of you who have experience with YouTube or content consistency: would mixing these two formats hurt the channel, or could it actually work if the music and mood stay consistent?

Any advice or personal experience would be really appreciated. Thanks!",1,1766602576.0,NewTubers,0,1.0,False

I’m not looking for an endless hallway of doors.

I’m building one home emotionally, mentally, and practically.

This means for me, fewer distractions. I’m choosing my person, and my attention will be with them. He will never have to doubt how much he means to me. Never have to question it. I’ll show him in the everyday day rhythms of life. 

This means clearer priorities. I prioritize your mental and emotional health. I know you are safe physically because I can see you here with me. But how is your mind? How are you feeling? Do you want to talk about it? Does your nervous system need silence right now with me just sitting by your side while you process internally? Do you need to sit by yourself to process out loud while I am in the other room knowing I am close by for you?

This means a calmer nervous system. When you exhale, I exhale, and we exhale together. A beginning of our ritual. 

Mornings and nights that start and end with reading together while sipping coffee and tea are much better than rushing. We are intentional. 

A life that doesn’t need constant newness or additions to feel meaningful. Being with you is all the meaning I need in life because we built it that way. Again, intentionally. We aren’t spreading ourselves thin because we already know what we have and what we won’t jeopardize our partnership of love. What we return to. 

When I meet the right person, the noise in my life should drop, instead of increasing. There is so much static in life. The constant noise and the distraction of snow on the screen… it feels so good to just turn the tv off. We do not subscribe to those programs. 

We should both notice by the certainty. What I mean by this is: we won’t have to second guess or doubt. We show up for each other and we are consistent. We should both notice that the basics are being met and reciprocated with joy, not out of obligation. 

Our effort towards each other doesn’t follow a wax and wane cycle, it steadily increases over time. 

I’m not against romance or spontaneity. I absolutely love those. As someone who thinks deeply and loves even deeper, it is absolutely something I want in my relationship. 

I just want them to be resting on top of firm foundation. A foundation of stability, honesty, loyalty, shared purpose, actual day-to-day compatibility, a strong bond, and devotion. 

Stillness makes room for a delightful partnership.

Commitment makes room for ease and longevity. 

One home can have many rooms, and it does have many rooms, you will see it when you arrive. And all the rooms belong to the same home.

I’m not building towards a hallway of almosts and maybes.

I’m building towards one honest, lived-in, snuggly, cozy, filled with love, laughter, and trust… a warm home with my right person. Let’s build together.

1puukwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwentiesIndia/comments/1puukwu/bangalore_my_office_seniors_constantly_keep/,Bangalore - My Office Seniors Constantly Keep Making me Feel Inferior Because I don't Smoke/Drink/Do Hook Ups,"21M, I have switched my company due to overall toxic work environment. 

Let me share my 1.5 years of experience working at start ups in Bangalore.

_ _ _ 


So, all the time which I have spent in Bangalore, I have met alot of new people, but obviously just like a normal corporate person, the most time I have spent was in my office.

And honestly having fucked up office seniors was like living in a hell.

_ _ _ 


## My Traits and Mindset: 

So, I have never smoked and I don't like smoking, and I don't like drinking as well - but fine I don't mind drinking a bit 3 to 4 times an year on special occasions, and I don't do hook ups at all, because it's my personal opinion that ""intimacy isn't something which should be taken casually"". 

If I like a girl, I ask her out in real life, if I get rejected - I learn, I improve, I move on and I make sure not to make the girl uncomfortable. 

So, I ask out a girl if I find her attractive, I go out on dates with her, I get to know her, I get into relationship if things feel smooth, I spend quality time with her to form a quality bond, I don't like casual stuff, casual things are just not my standards, If I am not dating - I am happy even when I am single, and if I break up with a girl then I love moving on alone chilling with my guy friends enjoying my life. 

So, I have my own mind, my own values, my own standards. I don't like to follow masses mindlessly. 

_ _ _ 


## My Office People's Traits and Mindset: 

My office colleagues smoke a lot, drink a lot, and all the time they're just talking about sex, sex and sex, all they care about is hook ups. My team had 100% Men - and most of them were just desperate for sex no matter what's their age, it's such an unprofessional work environment to work in, seniors just keep poking their nose into your personal life and they just keep imposing their mindsets on you like they're gods and they think only what they do is right.

_ _ _ 


# The Issue: 

So, whatever mindset and traits I have, and whatever mindset and traits my office people have, both are different, and the difference is not the issue, and I am not at all saying that my mindset is superior or their mindset is inferior, I don't categorize mindsets like this.

But the issue is that my office seniors keep imposing their opinions on the juniors even in personal lifes, even if I have denied more than once and I have said that ""I don't wanna smoke"", ""I don't wanna drink"", ""I don't like hook ups, stop saying to me again and again to go out and do hook ups"". 

But in the office, in office parties, in tea breaks, and everywhere, these office seniors of mine, they just fucking keep insisting every now and then so repetitively, they just keep saying again and again ""Please smoke once at least"", ""Don't deny alcohol"", ""The more you hook up, the more masculine you become"". 

Like my senior says: ""You're not living your life if you don't do hook ups, I have slept with 15 women until now, and sleeping with more women makes you more masculine"" and then I found out one day that he has done arrange marriage, and I was shocked.

I was like, he was able to find 15 women to fuck in Bangalore, and he is preaching hook ups, but for finding 1 women to marry he needed help from his parents. So, stop imposing your mindset on your juniors, they have a life, they have their own values, let them live, the juniors aren't telling you to stop hooking up, so please don't tell the juniors to start hooking up, live and let us live.

And dude, who the fuck taught these men that sleeping with more women is an indicator of more masculinity, why the standards of being masculine have become so shallow. 

But even if in my senior's world, if standards for being more masculine is sleeping with more women, then at least don't keep imposing your opinions onto me, and don't keep demeaning me that I am not doing hook ups so I am a bad person. 

And the biggest issue is their egos, if you tell them please don't talk like this, don't keep asking me about my personal life and please don't keep insisting like this again and again - it makes me feel disrespected, stop demeaning me, I am happy with my values.

Then these seniors take out frustration in professional meetings and professional reviews. 

At one point I started just lying and staying silent when senior used to come up and ask me ""Bata bhai teri personal life me kya chal raha hai"", nahi batana behenchod, I don't like you asking this question to me since day one, but like he thinks this is called socializing and this is making juniors feel comfortable. Nahi feel ho raha behenchod mujhe comfortable in conversations me bata to diya, nahi pasand mujhe apni personal life ke baare me mehfil baithana, mat puch mujhse aake ye cheezein roz muh uthake, I am even tired of ignoring you.

# Asking out a Random European Model: 

I remember I was walking by a 5 star hotel, and there I saw an European model, and she was damn beautiful, so I went upto her and I sparked a conversation, and I told her that I find you attractive, and then I was about to ask her out for a date, but first I asked that ""do you have a boyfriend"", and she told me she has a boyfriend, and I was like ""ohh, then leave it - I was about to ask you out for a date but now I won't as you have a boyfriend, sorry to bother you"", and then I ended the convo and said bye to her, but then the women asked me my IG, and I felt odd that why does she needs my IG if she has boyfriend and I told her that I was about to ask her out for a date if she didn't have a boyfriend, but she said ""We can still go out for coffee and we can chill alone somewhere, and go to my place afterwards"". 

And I was like - I am not looking for these kind of casual things, and for sure I never wanna go out on a coffee with a girl who has a boyfriend, but she is saying that she wanna go out on coffee with me, wants to spend time with me alone, and we can go to her place afterwards, hearing all this was a little shocking for me, so I was in shock thinking why would she even say all that when she has a boyfriend and she told me she has a monogamous relationship, in shock I was blank and I just exchanged my IG with her while I was blank, she followed me, I follwed her back, and I left. 

And after few days I saw her stories and yeah she actually has a boyfriend - and I just stopped entertaining her after I got the assurance that she actually has a boyfriend, so I only met and talked to her once in real life - the day when I 1st saw her - that's it.

So, I was new to Bangalore and I was new to My Office also at this time when all this happened, I didn't know what type of people my office seniors are, so randomly in a tea time I shared this experience with my seniors, because my seniors are living in Bangalore from many years now, and as I was new - I just wanted to ask is this what normally happens in Bangalore - do people just keep roaming around casually hooking up. 

And the motherfucking seniors started to say ""she is following you on IG, she looks so hot in her IG posts, she is a model, and she is inviting you for a coffee and to spend time alone, don't bother if she has a boyfriend, saamne se vo he to khud se bula rahi hai, you're missing an oppourtunity to hook up, reach back to her ASAP"", but behenchod nahi karna hook up, kutta thodi hun ki muh maarta rahun har jagha jahan attention de opposite gender. 


_ _ _ 


# My Final Take: 

This was my major experience of Bangalore, and it was depressing for me if I look at it from this angle. 

And its even more depressing to see such seniors who keep imposing their ideologies on juniors and who keep demeaning juniors just because they have different values than them. 

From my personal experience, I feel its really tough to find meaningful connections in Bangalore. And honestly the standards which I have, the curse of those standards is that I wanna date a woman who herself also carry these standards, and this makes finding a quality women even more tougher for me, because by seeing someone physically you can know that whether you find them superficially attractive or not, but you can't really know anyone's standards and real personality until you see them in tough situations, but anyways, I love myself and I love my standards regardless of whether I ever find a quality woman or not.

1puukp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1puukp2/ocean_el_faro_update_after_7_days_terrible/,Ocean El Faro - Update After 7 Days - Terrible.,"I posted last week about our first day there. Here’s an update after a week:

ROOMS: Thry weren’t super clean and very rundown. NO working deadbolt, it’s fake and opens with the other lock with a keycard. They must have done something to the bathroom sinks (in both our rooms!) bleach or something? By Day 3 the edges around the inside looked disgusting caulking everywhere crudely put on but we didn’t notice at first. It looked really really gross. The toilet is in a separate, tiny stall - reminded me of an RV toilet how it was set up and how it flushed. Sewer smell most days. Room phone woke us up EARLY two mornings in a row to try to sell us stuff! :(

SERVICE: the people we encountered the first day were very nice. After that there were many rude and dismissive people who clearly did not want to be working. Even when we’d hand $5-10 tip, no smile! Two nights we called to get water/soda stocked. No one showed up. Our butler reserved us 3 restaurants, but that was about it. 

BEACH: EVERY single day we were hounded by vendors. If we said no, they’d continually walk in front or behind our beach chairs, one even sat behind us staring for awhile. Made my 18 yr old daughter very uncomfortable. There was barely any seaweed, though, so we were lucky on that end. A vendor even tried to sell my husband drugs. 

LAZY RIVER: We brought our own tubes, they do not have enough tubes on the resort. Not once but twice, employees tried to take and sell our tubes. 

BUFFET FOOD: TERRIBLE!!!! We are not foodies, we like most anything. Our family of 5 always found something at the buffet but only because we had to eat. Nothing tasted really good. We’d laugh because we’d wonder around aimlessly trying to find something edible. 

RESTAURANTS: Of the 3 restaurants we visited, Sakura was the best. The ONLY good meal we had. When we ate at the Steakhouse, the server only talked to us to try to sell us lobster and wine. When we declined he was rude and mumbled. Most of our orders were wrong. Cats everywhere, even jumping up as we ate. Dolce Vitta, the Italian restaurant was so bad. The service was GREAT there, but the food, hard no. My husband had Chicken Parmesan and it was a freezer burned chicken patty he couldn’t eat it. My seafood fettuccini? Tasted like Spaghetti-O’s with 5 dry, overcooked shrimp on top. No one finished their meals, every bowl and plate looked full when we left which made us feel bad but we simply couldn’t finish. 

MONKEYLAND: the driver was crude, talked about massage parlors and hookers over the speaker multiple times! Pointed out women on the street! The Monkey part was so fun, we loved the monkeys and won’t forget it. However, after interacting with the monkeys you are subjected to forced “tour” about chocolate and coffee. This was all a sales pitch and no one wanted to be there. 

2 out of my 3 kids got food poisoning. They were each out a day. We couldn’t wait to leave! We were excited to find out there was a Taco Bell at the airport! We normally aren’t fond of Taco Bell either but we were afraid to eat at the resort! We have never wanted to leave vacation. This was a first. 

OH, and our last full day there was a Friday and the amount of people tripled. There was nowhere to sit by the lazy river, no beach chairs, it became incredibly crowded. Someone said locals go there on the weekends? I don’t know if that was it but we couldn’t even get Mike’s coffee Saturday morning, we stood in line for 45 mins and it wasn’t moving. Their ice cream cappuccino was excellent, I think my favorite thing about our trip. 

I think after our experience we will never return to the DR. ",3,1766602534.0,AllInclusiveResorts,3,1.0,False

The app offers two display modes: a standard flat screen and an immersive curved screen mode. The curved display option includes a range of new enhancements designed to deliver a more immersive and comfortable gaming experience. This release is my personal take on creating a smooth, comfortable experience for others. It isn’t meant to replace other options — it's just another way to enjoy PC gaming on Vision Pro.

# ☕ Development

I’ve put a huge amount of time into this over the past couple months, experimenting and refining what worked—and cutting what didn’t. I’ve done my best to make the experience as smooth as possible, but there may still be a few bugs. I’m a solo developer doing my best to improve the Moonlight experience for the community—every coffee genuinely helps: [**ko-fi.com/neovectorx**](http://ko-fi.com/neovectorx)

# Known Limitations, Bugs & Upcoming Features

While Neo Moonlight v11.1 introduces many improvements, there are a few areas that are still in progress or planned for future updates. My main goal was to focus on delivering a clean and immersive user experience.

* **Immersive Curved Display**: Immersive Apple environments such as the curved display mode do not allow you to view external apps. I spent a lot of time working on the non immersive curved screen mode, but ultimately it didn't meet the level of quality I was aiming for so I have excluded it for now. My goal is to add it in the future when it is ready.
* **First Launch:** The very first launch after the initial install can be buggy and even crash while Apple installs certain codecs, etc. Restarting usually clears it up.
* **Disconnect:** The disconnect feature is still a bit buggy. I am aware and working on it.
* **Touch Screen Support in Immersive Mode:** I had this working quite well, but it wasn't perfect so I removed it for now. My plan is to reimplement it when it is.
* **Bug fixes & optimizations**: As with any major release, minor bugs and performance tweaks will continue to be addressed based on user feedback.

**Why “Kepler Edition”?** Kepler is a well-known crater on the Moon, and this release represents a big leap for Neo Moonlight—bringing major updates and new immersive features. Future major updates will also get edition names, keeping track of milestones in the app’s evolution.

1puuk40,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1puuk40/my_34f_partner_33m_cycles_between_states_of_youre/,"My (34/f) partner (33/m) cycles between states of ""you're the love of my life"" and ""I have contempt for you."" He has demonstrated capacity for growth and repair, but it seemingly disappears in the latter state. Is there a way to save this relationship or is it time to walk away?","Background info: On-and-off relationship lasting for 5 years between 33/m and 34/f.

The first two years of our relationship were very volatile. The best relationship I had ever been in at first, until one day after we had started having some early conflict, he sat me down one day to tell me he had lost feelings for me, but he was committed to staying together. He had very recently been making declarations of love, so this was pretty shocking. He ended the relationship shortly afterward, then came back months later apologizing and wanting to get back together. 

Fast forward, we spend the next 2 years or so in an intensely good, then intensely bad relationship cycle. He has always been the one to end the relationship, and some of the ways he has acted toward me in them over the years have been very hurtful. Just as examples, he has broken up with me suddenly in the middle of the night and asked me to do a long-distance drive to drop him back off at his place two hours away, then drive myself back home at \~3-4am; He has told me he had contempt for me, then hung up and didn't speak to for months, during a final conversation where we were coordinating moving his items out of our shared house. That breakup resulting in the move-out actually occurred about six weeks after he had executed an elaborate marriage proposal for me involving my entire family and a scene from my favorite movie, proposing on a boat with a custom ring he had made for me. He has dropped me off at work when we've been in conflict saying 'I don't love you"" as I'm getting out of the door to go in. 

Some of them are more mundane, like breaking up with me in a coffee shop after we went to a yoga class one morning, but they all share this quality of him essentially getting to a state where seemingly has very little empathy for me and is just... indifferent to any of the commitments he's made or our relationship or even me as a person. This state can last for days, weeks, or months, then he returns.

For another about 1.5 year period, we are primarily no contact after I won't accept him coming back after a time he leaves. I pretty harshly institigate no contact with him because I had lost complete ability to trust him. During that time, he independently did trauma therapy and a lot of personal work on attachment and repair, etc. I also was independently doing some of the same after our breakup. After months of NC, we would text occasionally casually, before we ended up being friendly again for a bit. We talked through the things that had happened between us, there was a lot of what appeared to be genuine remorse and change his conflict resolution and emotion regulation skills. This was demonstrated over a sustained time even when we did have conflicts that definitely would have blown up between us in the past. Aaand, at the end of it, I still decided to return to NC and try to move on with my life.

We reconnect on a friendly basis after some birthday messages recently, and things seem really, really good again. So we get back together maybe six months ago.... and it was so great! I felt happy with him and like he had earned my trust again, my family accepted him back as family and he just went on a trip with us, we've been looking at houses to live in together and we've done well at navigating conflict when it's come up. He was promising me commitment and stability etc. again. It really felt like we had finally done the work we both needed to do to have a healthy partnership and navigate conflict together instead of falling apart. 

Until we started to have conflicts related to integrating our existing pets into our new home. It's an area of conflict that's very difficult for us bc we both have strong feelings about it. But anyway, we had a disagreement this week that ended up us both apologizing... But after that call, he has drifted back into the state from the past again. He is checked out, unable or unwilling to have empathy for me, oscillates between attacking me because he believes I am lying about my intentions about his cat, and cold indifference to me. We are still together, but the whole relationship has shifted from ""you're my whole life"" to essentially indifference to me in the span of a week. 

I have tried everything I can do to try to get the version of him that can see me as a full person to return. Giving him space, trying to explain what's upset me, clarifying my position, trying to accommodate his needs, and at this point, he will barely talk to me. He sent me a messaging saying he wanted to repair a few days ago, but when I engaged and then wanted him to clarify some things he said in his apology message, he said ""I can't have a serious conversation rn."" and has just... never returned to address it, even when we went through with our casual ritual to watch a TV show together, he treated me like, a buddy or something with no acknowledgement whatsoever about what's going on between us. The next morning, he asked if we could schedule a time to talk after Christmas... but not about what he even means by that. I said I was available in the afternoon or evening and he said ""kk"" and... yeah.

I love this man and the future we were building together. But at the same time, I am at my wits end and drowning in anxiety about how confusing his behavior is. If anyone has ever had a partner that acted this way, can you please give me some advice about how to navigate repairing something like this? Or honestly, if this is unfixable, just some advice about how to handle it ending without all the psychological scars of all the other times. 

Thanks in advance for reading all of that.

\*tl;dr (34/f) in on/off with (33/m). Want to make the relationship work if I can, but stuck with repairing with a partner who has a pattern of behaving in hurtful ways despite a demonstrated capacity for insight and change.

1puuj7h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1puuj7h,Indie Cross Radiance Infection AU Chapter 3:(with Cuphead and Niko),"A portal opened in a pitch-black void, and out-tumbled Cuphead, Niko, Knight, Beheaded, V1, and Monika. They landed in a pool of thick, black liquid, the darkness broken only by the Beheaded’s flaming head, the glow of Niko’s eyes, the light from V1’s eyes and wings, and the faint shimmer of Monika’s holographic projection.

“Ew! What the hell is this?” Beheaded exclaimed in disgust.

Cuphead scooped up some of the substance, letting it slide between his fingers. It was thick and mushy. “This is ink…but I’ve never seen ink like this before,” he murmured.

“Hey, what’s with the drone projecting you, Monika?” Niko asked, glancing at one of Charlotte's drones on top of her.

“It was deactivated,” Monika explained. “And since I’m made of pure code, I realized I might need a physical form to exist in realms outside of mine. So I…took control of it. I’m not sure what would’ve happened if I hadn’t.” Her voice trailed off uneasily.

Suddenly, Cuphead froze as a thought struck him. “Wait, where’s Charlotte?”

As the group began trying to piece together the machine’s absence, Niko’s ears twitched. “Guys, shh. Do you hear that?”

Cuphead, Beheaded, Knight, V1, and Monika fell silent. Above them, faint stomping echoed through the darkness, growing steadily louder as the ceiling began to tremble.

The Beheaded’s expression shifted as realization dawned. “Guys…I think Charlotte isn’t here with us for a reason.”

Before anyone could respond, the source of the tremors burst through the ceiling and plunged into the inky depths beside them. Light from the shattered floor above filtered down, revealing the massive figure that now loomed over the group. He was hunched and towering, with elongated claws, hooved feet, and two enormous horns that curled menacingly from his head. Human-like teeth dawned his gapping mouth, and thick, dripping ink coated his entire body, obscuring most of his face. They were staring at the mighty and monstrous Ink Demon! 



The Ink Demon roared at the top of his lungs, startling everyone.

“V1, **ATTACK!**” Monika commanded.

The war machine responded instantly, launching itself at the Ink Demon. The two fought deeper into the inky abyss below as V1 drew its railgun and fired rapid bursts, attempting to tear the beast apart. Meanwhile, Monika directed Cuphead, Niko, the Knight, and the Beheaded toward the shattered opening in the ceiling.

“Come on!” Monika urged as her drone hovered low enough for Niko to climb aboard.

She ascended from the pit with Niko clinging to the drone. The Knight unfurled its Monarch Wings and vaulted out of the ink. Once they were safe, Monika descended again, pulling Cuphead and the Beheaded free. Without hesitation, the group fled into the depths of the building, desperate to escape the chaos below.

The Ink Demon was far faster than V1 had anticipated, dodging nearly every shot. Still, the machine refused to relent. Just as the demon lunged, V1 switched to its Knuckleblaster and struck with devastating force, sending the Ink Demon flying. V1 attempted to absorb the creature’s essence, expecting at least some blood. It was only ink instead. There wasn’t a single drop of blood. As the machine tried to purge the substance, the ink refused to leave its systems. That was when realization struck: **The ink was alive**. The Ink Demon capitalized on the moment, smashing V1 aside. Though the war machine fought back, the living ink clogged its systems, overwhelming its focus. As V1 prepared a railcannon ricochet using a handful of coins, a massive inky hand erupted from the black ocean and seized it. V1 struggled, but more ink poured inside. The Ink Demon watched coldly as the war machine was dragged beneath the surface and into the ink depths below.



Cuphead, Niko, the Knight, the Beheaded, and Monika ran as fast as they could, fleeing deeper into the structure. The halls twisted unnaturally, stretching farther than they should have, like a maze drawn by an unsteady hand. Everything around them looked *wrong*, walls sketched in thick black lines, shadows bleeding into yellow-tinted lighting. It almost looked like the world  itself had been inked onto paper and left unfinished. When they finally slowed, everyone bent over, gasping.

“What the fuck was that thing?” Beheaded demanded between breaths, wiping ink from his corpse body.

“I don’t know,” Monika admitted, scanning the corridor nervously. 

Niko tugged anxiously at their scarf. “Do you… do you think V1 will be okay?”

“If that machine can deal with The Rogues,” Cuphead said, trying to sound confident, “it can handle that ink freak.” Even as he spoke, he wasn’t entirely sure.

The group began to take in their surroundings more carefully. Posters lined the walls, their corners peeling. Cardboard standees stared back at them with frozen smiles. The longer they looked, the more unsettling the art style became, cheerful faces stretched just a little too wide, eyes just a little too empty.

“Bendy in the Dancing Demon*,*” the Beheaded read aloud, tapping one of the posters. Beside it stood a life-sized cardboard cutout of the grinning cartoon demon. “Why does this thing look like it crawled out of your world, Cuphead?”

Cuphead stepped closer, studying the figure. “Yeah…he really does.”

“And I gotta say,” the Beheaded added with a snort, “He looks like a twink.”

Monika groaned audibly.

The Beheaded grinned and turned to the Knight. “Hey, bug. Wanna use this thing for target practice?”

Before Monika could stop them, the Knight raised its nail and sliced clean through the cutout. The cardboard fell apart soundlessly. For a heartbeat, everything was quiet. Then his roar came. It thundered down the hallway, raw and furious, shaking the walls. Ink began to seep from cracks in the ceiling, dripping like black rain. Everyone slowly turned to glare at the Beheaded.

“…Fuck,” he muttered.

“**RUN!**” Cuphead shouted.

They bolted. The hallways blurred as they sprinted, choosing paths at random, barely avoiding grasping inky tendrils clawing out from the walls. Niko struggled to keep up, their legs shaking before tripping.

“I can’t-!” Niko cried, panic flooding their voice. “I can’t run that fast anymore!”

“Beheaded, grab them!” Monika ordered.

“Oh, come on!” the Beheaded snapped, scooping Niko up effortlessly and slinging them over his shoulder.

Behind them, the Ink Demon burst into view, galloping on all fours with terrifying speed. Cuphead fired shot after shot from his fingers, but the bullets sank harmlessly into the creature’s body. The Knight crystal-dashed desperately, barely staying out of reach. Monika flew ahead, trying to find any path that *wasn’t* a dead end. They didn’t succeed. The corridor opened into a massive chamber filled with an entire ink ocean, similar to the one they were below earlier.

“We’re trapped!” Niko shrieked.

“No,” Monika said quickly, forcing herself to stay calm. “We jump. Everyone hold on-”

Cartoonish hands rose from the ink below, fingers twitching eagerly ready to grab.

“So much for that shit,” the Beheaded growled.

Cuphead turned to Monika, fear creeping into his voice. “Monika, I didn’t see V1. No gunfire. Nothing.”

Monika tried to reconnect. Static hissed back at her.

“I’ve… lost connection.”

“You’re kidding me,” Beheaded snapped. “That thing wiped out Hell but lost to sentient black water?”

Before anyone could respond, the Ink Demon slid into the room, towering over them. “…You,” he growled.

“Me?” the Beheaded asked, pointing at himself.

“YOU!” The Ink Demon lunged forward. “You outsiders infected my realm and my people!”

“We didn’t do anything!” Cuphead shouted. “We’re trying to stop it!”

“LIARS! What makes you think I would believe in outsiders like you?”

Niko tried to calm down the Ink Demon. “Kindness out of your heart?”

“I wasn’t born with a heart,” The Ink Demon muttered.

“Goodwill?” Niko guessed, running out of options.

The Ink Demon only roared in their face until everyone heard a second roar. One more angelic, ancient and angrier. 

The Ink Demon froze. “What the hell was that?” He took off running to investigate.



Everyone sighed in relief with the Ink Demon gone. “Come on, let’s get the hell out of this place,” Cuphead yelled but the Knight pulled him back.

“Come on, bug! We can’t stay here!” Beheaded yelled as he picked it up to prevent it from holding any of them back.

The group burst out of the stairwell and into open air. They had barely registered the city before it overwhelmed them. A sprawling 1930s metropolis stretched endlessly in every direction, buildings warped and sagging as if melting under their own weight. Flickering streetlamps cast long, crooked shadows across cracked pavement. Everything was drenched in ink covered walls, streets, signs etc. Wandering the streets were humanoid ink creatures, the Lost Ones. They moved slowly, aimlessly, their bodies dripping black fluid. None of them paid the group any attention. All of them were staring upward. 

Cuphead followed their gaze. High above the city floated a massive white-and-orange light, pulsing slowly, like a beating heart suspended in the sky. Its glow washed over the buildings, casting harsh, holy illumination that burned against the dark ink below. Instantly, the Knight began to panic and struggle violently in Beheaded’s grip.

“Dude, calm down,” Beheaded snapped, tightening his hold. “It’s the fucking sun, man.”

One of the Lost Ones slowly turned its head toward him. “We don’t have a sun.”

Cuphead’s stomach dropped.

Memories flashed through his mind of Charlotte’s warnings, the portals, Niko’s sun, Unreal’s nightmare energy. He looked at Niko, then at the Knight, still shaking uncontrollably.

“Oh no…” Cuphead whispered as he came to realize. “That’s not a sun.”

“HEY!!!”The roar came from behind them. The Ink Demon erupted into view, sending ink splashing across the street as he landed. His gaze locked onto the burning light above. “GET OUT OF MY REALM!!!!!” he bellowed.

With a powerful leap, the Ink Demon launched himself into the sky, charging straight toward The Radiance. Light and ink collided, the shockwave rattling windows. More Lost Ones gathered in the streets, drawn by the clash of two godlike forces. Among them stood another figure, a young woman who didn’t quite belong. She was young, with half her body slick with ink and the other half painfully human. Her expression was tense and focused as she watched the battle unfold above.

The Radiance descended, her form becoming clearer as she wrapped multiple glowing arms around the Ink Demon. Her light intensified, burning into him, steam and ink pouring out from his body as he roared in agony. She meant to evaporate him out of existence. The Ink Demon thrashed violently, claws tearing through the air as he broke free and began crawling and clawing all over her body. Even as the Radiance poured divine energy into him, he refused to yield and he endured it. The Radiance’s glow flared brighter as she struggled to lay a good hit. Then she *felt* it. Something deep within the Ink Demon, something dormant. Her arms shifted, slipping inside his inky form, forcing their way through writhing darkness. The Ink Demon screamed as she activated the transformation buried within him. With a final, furious motion, the Radiance hurled him back down toward the city.



The sky burned brighter as The Radiance began to charge up.

“Guys…” Cuphead said, panic creeping into his voice. “We gotta get out of here.”

“Fuck… fuck fuck fuck!” Beheaded shouted, spinning in place. “We gotta GO!”

The Lost Ones finally broke into a panic. They screamed, shoved, and stampeded through the streets, desperate to escape what was coming. Ink bodies collided, knocking the group apart in seconds.

“Guys!” Cuphead shouted. “Niko! Knight! Monika!”

A hand suddenly grabbed his arm and yanked him sideways. Before he could react, Cuphead was dragged into a nearby building, the door slamming shut behind them.

“You okay?” a woman’s voice asked urgently.

Cuphead spun around. It was the half-ink woman from before. “No!” he shouted. “My friends are still out there!”

Outside, the chaos continued, but slowly, the streets began to clear. Cuphead burst back out, calling their names. “Niko! Knight! Beheaded! Monika!”

One by one, they emerged, scraped up, shaken, but alive. Above them, the Radiance’s glow intensified, her light flooding the sky.

“I’ve got a place we can all hide!” the woman said firmly. “Now move!”

She led them through narrow streets and into another building just as something massive crashed behind them.  Monika was the only one who turned back. The Ink Demon laid in the street, his massive form collapsing into a spreading puddle of ink. The darkness twisted and reshaped itself, shrinking rapidly. Until, Bendy lay where the monster had been. The same Bendy from the posters she saw! He scrambled to his feet, looking around wildly in fear.

Monika didn’t hesitate to help him. “Get on my drone shell,” she ordered. “I’ll rush us to safety!”

Bendy climbed on instinctively, clinging to the metal as Monika lifted off and followed the others inside. In the sky, the Radiance unleashed her full power. Blinding light washed over the city as orange vines and infectious goo erupted outward, crawling over buildings, streets, and walls. The corruption poured down through every crack and vent, seeping deep into Joey Drew Studios itself. The group barely made it inside before the doors sealed shut.

Monika caught up with the others, her voice tight with urgency. “Guys! The Radiance is spreading her infection all over the surface, and it’s coming down here!”



“Okay! I got an idea!” the woman said suddenly, stepping forward. Her voice was firm, cutting through the panic. “We’re all going to have to jump in.”

Everyone turned to stare at her. 

“What?” Cuphead blurted out.

“Do *not* swallow the ink,” she continued quickly. “It’s alive. Everyone hold onto each other, and on the count of three, we all jump in together!”

Niko’s ears flattened. “You want us to jump into *that*?”

“It’s the only place the infection can’t fully reach,” she replied. “I’m sure. You all just have to trust me!”

The vines and go slammed against the walls, creeping closer. There was no more time to argue. The woman grabbed Cuphead’s hands first. Niko clutched onto Cuphead, trembling. The Knight stepped in next, gripping Niko’s sleeve. The Beheaded wrapped an arm around the Knight, muttering curses under his breath. Monika hovered close in her drone, Bendy clinging tightly to its shell.

“Ready?” the woman said, glancing back as the vines spilled into the room. “One-” The ceiling and doors cracked open with infection. “JUMP!”

They leapt. Cold ink swallowed them instantly. The sensation was unlike anything they’d felt before, thick, heavy, and resisting their movement as if it *wanted* to pull them apart. Cuphead fought the instinct to gasp, clamping his mouth shut as the ink pressed against him from all sides. The woman led them downward, diving deeper, her inky half moving effortlessly through the darkness. The others struggled, but they held on,hands locked, refusing to let go.

The Radiance’s glow dimmed all over the realm as she left. After what felt like an eternity, the pressure eased. They broke the surface together. The chamber they emerged into was quiet, eerily so. The walls were slick with ink, but the orange vines had stopped at the ceiling, unable to descend any further. Everyone collapsed at the edge of the pool, gasping.

“What the hell happened here?” the woman muttered, helping Cuphead and Niko up.

Niko coughed, shaking but alive. “Th-thank you… you saved our lives.”

The Knight performed a respectful bow.

Cuphead wiped ink from his face and let out a breathy laugh. “Yeah-thanks. But, uh… we’ve got *a lot* of questions.”

“So do I,” the woman replied. She studied them closely now, her gaze lingering on each of their unusual forms. “I’m guessing none of you are from around here.”

“No shit, dumbass,” the Beheaded said immediately. Niko kicked him in the shin.“Ow-hey!”

The woman raised an eyebrow but smirked slightly. 

“What’s your name?” Monika asked.

“Audrey,” she said. “Audrey Drew.”

“I’m Cuphead,” he said proudly, removing his head and bowing. “Nice to meetcha!”

“I’m Niko,” they said quickly. “A person. Not a cat. Don’t call me a cat”

The Knight stepped forward and bowed silently.

“That’s The Knight. It doesn't talk,” Niko added.

“I’m Monika,” she said. “I’m a sentient AI, if you know what that means.”

“And I’m the Beheaded,” he said, puffing out his chest. “A homunculus warrior. The strongest one here. Wanna high five?” Audrey raised her hand and instantly zapped him with a burst of energy from her left hand. “OW, FUCK!” he yelped, convulsing before collapsing to the floor. “WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!”

“That’s for calling me a dumbass,” Audrey shot back, half-amused.

After a moment, Beheaded groaned. “Ow… damn, Audrey. Didn’t know you had it in you. Respect.”

Audrey lifted her left hand, revealing a swirling symbol etched into her knuckles. “Please don’t touch this one. It’s used to banish the ink monsters here and it could actually kill you guys so please don’t touch it.”

Cuphead pointed to Bendy, who was still clinging silently to Monika’s drone. “Okay…but what about *him*?”

Audrey’s expression softened. “That’s Bendy. Long story, but yes, you’ve probably seen him everywhere in the studio with his imagery around.”

Monika nodded. “We saw this ink monster thing transform into him.”

Audrey exhaled. “Like I said, it’s a long story.” She glanced upward as the walls trembled faintly. “This place still isn’t safe. But I know somewhere we can hide. A real resting spot.”

“Lead the way,” Cuphead said.

Audrey turned and started deeper into the studio. “Stick close,” she warned. “And whatever you hear, don’t panic.” The group followed her, disappearing into the ink-dark halls together.



	Audrey led them through narrow service corridors, the yellowed lights flickering overhead. The studio felt different down here, quieter, heavier especially with The Radiance’s infection. Ink dripped slowly from the ceiling, pooling along the edges of the hall, while distant mechanical groans echoed through the walls like the building itself was breathing. No one spoke. They moved carefully, stepping over collapsed beams and discarded studio props half-sunk into ink. The Radiance’s infection had fully claimed this level, with orange goo clung stubbornly to pipes and vents, pulsing faintly.

Suddenly **BANG!**

A door behind them exploded inward. Everyone spun around as the metal door tore free from its hinges and slammed into the wall. Smoke hissed through the opening. Out of it stepped V1. The war machine was drenched in ink, its frame streaked black and dripping. Its optics burned brighter than before, scanning rapidly in a fit of rage after his defeat to the Ink Demon. V1 raised its shotgun and aimed it directly at Audrey the moment it spotted her.

“NO WAIT!” Monika shouted, flying forward. “She’s our ally!”

V1’s targeting systems hesitated, its weapon still raised.

“She saved us from the Radiance!” Niko added quickly, stepping protectively closer to Audrey.

The machine’s arm twitched as if fighting its own instincts. Slowly, the shotgun lowered until V1’s optics shifted and locked onto Bendy. 

“Nope,” Cuphead said quickly, stepping in front of Bendy without thinking. “He’s our ally too.”

Bendy clutched Cuphead’s hand, shaking. V1 stood still for a long moment. Its servos whined softly as internal processes clashed. Finally, the weapon lowered again, but the machine’s stance remained rigid, its fingers flexing restlessly. V1 was obeying them but didn’t like it.

Audrey exhaled slowly. “That robot with the wings…is it yours?”

“Sort of,” Monika said carefully. “It’s complicated.”

“How much longer is this hiding place of yours?” the Beheaded asked impatiently, rolling his shoulders. “Because I’m getting really tired of almost dying.”

“A few minutes,” Audrey replied. “We’re close. Just…stay quiet.”

They continued on. The halls grew wider, opening into older sections of the studio. Faded signs hung crookedly from the ceiling. Ink-stained murals depicted smiling characters frozen in mid-dance. Every step echoed louder than it should have. Then, they reached a large set of doors. Painted above them in worn lettering were the words: “ARTIST’S REST”. 

Audrey pushed the doors open. Inside was a vast two-story room, surprisingly intact. Beds lined the walls, some neatly made, others clearly used recently. In the center sat an abandoned coffee shop, its counter still stocked with dusty mugs and cans of Bacon Soup. The orange vines had crept into the room, but stopped short. For the first time since arriving in this world, it felt…calm.

“Okay,” Audrey said, spreading her arms slightly. “Welcome to Artist’s Rest. Beds, food, and, relatively safe. This is about as good as it gets here.”

The Beheaded let out a tired laugh. “Finally.”

He dropped onto one of the beds and immediately recoiled as a ghostly ink creature lunged out of the mattress, shrieking before vanishing in a blink.

“AHH! What the fuck was that?!”

Audrey barely reacted. “Oh, that’s just Slicer. She does that sometimes. Yeah, she’s kind of a bitch.”

The Beheaded stared at the bed in horror. “…I hate this place.”

Audrey turned toward the coffee counter. “Does anyone want Bacon Soup?”

Cuphead’s eyes lit up instantly. “Oh, hell yeah.”

Niko nodded cautiously. Bendy hesitated, then nodded too. Surprisingly, the Knight raised a hand as well.

“I can’t eat,” Monika said quietly. “I’m an AI. And V1 feeds on blood.”

Audrey paused mid-can-opening and blinked. “...What the hell?” she added after a moment. “Why would someone build a robot like that?”

“Someone with way too much free time,” Cuphead guessed, slurping his soup. “So, now that we’re not actively dying, what *is* this place?”



Audrey gestured vaguely at the surrounding studio. “This is Joey Drew Studios, or at least, a replica of it inside an ink machine. My father created it based on the real studio so he could change it however he wanted.”

“Wait… father?” Niko’s voice was tight with surprise.

Audrey gave a bitter laugh. “Yeah. He had a god complex, and it got worse when the studio went bankrupt in the ’40s, he spent too much on the ink machine. Eventually…he wanted a daughter. So he created me. Using the ink machine. I’m…an ink person. I spent my whole life thinking I was normal, when I’m not.” Her voice faltered as sadness and the weight of her reality pressed in.

“I know how that feels,” Monika said quietly.

Cuphead, Niko, Knight, and Bendy placed their hands over Audrey’s, offering her silent comfort.

Monika hesitated. “Also…what’s the deal with Bendy? Before, he was this…blind ink monster.”

Audrey’s expression darkened. “That’s the Ink Demon, ruler of this realm. He was a failed experiment to create living cartoon beings like you, Cuphead. Joey locked him up in the real world due to his appearance, and he became hostile. Then he was trapped here, becoming part of The Cycle.” She paused. “There’s a film reel called *The End* that must be played for The Cycle to continue. If it isn’t…this place collapses, and the Ink Demon could escape into the real world.”

She shook her head. “Everything was fine until this creepy janitor in the real world named Wilson got his hands on the ink machine. He twisted it into his own vision, starting by torturing the Ink Demon into the Bendy you see now to get rid of him.”

“That’s awful!” Monika said in horror and disgust.

Audrey nodded. “Then he got rid of The End reel to maintain his empire. Obviously, that’s terrible for this realm.”

Cuphead finished his bacon soup and wiped his mouth. “So are they the same then because…personality-wise, the Ink Demon and Bendy couldn’t be more different.”

“It’s complicated,” Audrey admitted. “Even I don’t know all the details. Bendy and the Ink Demon are separate beings, constantly fighting for control over one another. I imagine Wilson finally perfected the Ink Demon in the way my father originally intended, to finally become the character he always wanted."" She leaned back, exhaling. “My turn. How did you all meet, and… what’s with The Radiance?”

“Portals have been spawning everywhere,” Cuphead began, “dragging people like us into different worlds. The Radiance used them to achieve a form that makes her extremely powerful.”

“And she stole my sun,” Niko added bitterly.

Audrey frowned. “Sun?”

Niko’s voice became serious as they explained. “My sun is a lightbulb in my realm, it was used to save my decaying world and get me home. Until a portal dragged me into this mess. We were ambushed by robots called The Rogues, who want to conquer the multiverse. Cuphead saved me, but the sun… it was left behind during the ambush. The Radiance followed us and absorbed it. She’s a goddess from Knight’s realm.”

The Knight handed Audrey its hunter journal, filled with records of its journey through Hallownest, including recent encounters with Shovel Knight and Madeline.

Audrey flipped through the pages, her eyes widening. “Wow… I never would have imagined the multiverse was real, let alone worlds like these. So, Cuphead, what about your world?”

“I live on the Inkwell Isles!” Cuphead said, grinning. “It’s full of ‘cartoon’ characters like me. I’ve got my brother, Mugman, and we live with Elder Kettle. Ms. Chalice is a friend of ours. We've gotten into trouble, mostly with the Devil. But don’t worry, he’s not too bad. We even got along once…until he realized I wasn’t wearing a soul sweater to protect myself.”

Niko muttered, “Why am I not surprised?”

Audrey turned to Beheaded. “Your turn.”

“I thought you’d never ask! It’s a literal shit hole. The island shifts constantly, the people are crazy, and there’s this red-haired girl who thinks I’m a savior. I think her name’s Laure? She’s French…maybe. I don’t like her.”

“And you, Monika?” Audrey asked.

Monika hesitated. “It…wasn’t pretty. I had a normal high school life, popular, everything was perfect. Too perfect. Then when I started a literature club, I discovered my world is a simulation. My friends…are AI and code. I lost it. Cuphead and Niko helped me through it.” She offered them a small, bittersweet smile.

Audrey raised an eyebrow. “Aw, that’s sweet. But the drone is projecting you, what’s that about?”

“There’s a machine named Charlotte,” Monika explained. “She has a grudge against The Rogues. One of her drones got damaged when one of The Rogues attacked my realm. I used it while Charlotte led us here. I didn’t trust her.”

Audrey frowned. “Oh! That machine wants you dead if she sent you here.”

“Agreed,” Cuphead said. “If it weren’t for The Radiance stepping in with the Ink Demon, we’d be dead.”

Suddenly, V1 twitched and charged its shotgun as it might have heard something down in one of the hallways.

Audrey’s eyes widened. “So what about V1? How can a robot feed on blood?”

Monika’s expression darkened. “Machines like V1 wiped out humanity in its realm because they needed blood for fuel. Once the humans were gone, V1 and others went to Hell, purging demons. Judging from V1’s memory…” She paused, scanning it. “…it even took down an arch angel! And the reason it’s not attacking us is because I hacked it to be passive. And the fight to do it was fucking hell.” She shivered at the memory.

Audrey whispered, “Wow…you all have really been through it.” She stood, her voice firm but gentle. “Alright. Time to rest. This place is dangerous. We’ll need everyone at their best, especially with The Radiance and her infection here.”

### Health and Wellness Devotional: United in Grace – Embracing the Power of Community

**Scripture Focus:**  
*“For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.”* – Matthew 18:20 (NIV)

**Reflection:**  
In our fast-paced world, it’s easy to feel isolated. Despite technological advancements that allow us to connect virtually, many of us are longing for genuine community. The beauty of community, however, lies in its ability to help us flourish—not just as individuals, but as a collective.

The concept of being *United in Grace* reminds us that our well-being flourishes when we stand together. Connection is not merely a social luxury; it is a fundamental element of our health—emotionally, spiritually, and physically. Engaging with a supportive community allows us to share burdens, celebrate victories, and foster accountability.

**Health Insights:**  
Recent studies have shown that strong social bonds contribute significantly to overall health. From enhancing mental well-being to improving cardiovascular health, the positive effects of community are substantial. Here are a few vital insights:

1. **Mental Health Boost**: Engaging with others can reduce stress, anxiety, and feelings of loneliness.
2. **Encouragement in Action**: Community provides a supportive environment that encourages healthier choices—whether that’s exercising together, sharing recipes, or practicing mindfulness.
3. **Spiritual Growth**: Gathering with others in faith deepens our spiritual understanding and fosters a sense of belonging.

**Encouragement:**  
Let this be a reminder that you are not alone. Seek out connections that uplift you. Be intentional about nurturing relationships in your community—whether through local groups, church activities, or casual meet-ups with friends. Encourage one another in your health journeys, celebrating small victories and providing comfort during challenging times.

**Prayer:**  
*Dear Lord, thank You for the gift of community. Help us to recognize the strength we find in one another. May we be open to forming connections that uplift and support us in our health and wellness journeys. Teach us to love and encourage each other, reflecting Your grace in our lives. Amen.*

**Action Step:**  
Consider reaching out to someone in your community. It could be as simple as a phone call, a coffee date, or joining a local fitness group. Share your health goals and hear about theirs. Embrace the journey together, knowing that in unity, we find strength.

### Closing Thought:

As we walk this path of health and wellness, let’s remember that we are *United in Grace*. Together, we can embrace the power of community, transforming our journeys into vibrant expressions of support, love, and encouragement.

I respectfully said “no worries” deleted her number. Then one hour later she messaged me to ask why I want to take her on a date.

Shared my feelings for her. Nothing, then she messaged again one day later. I talk with her, and I realize she wants to be friends, nothing more.

I stopped talking to her after two days when wisdom hit my brain, and then I went no contact and deleted her number again.

Yesterday, after one day silence, I got a message from her asking when I'm coming to the gym. Ignored her text  and her in the gym, when I reached home and told her I can't be her friend because I have different feelings. Let’s be strangers again.

Today in the gym she came to me and said, ""You have ego and so much anger."" When I was leaving.  I ignored her in the gym and was leaving when she said this.

1puufc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1puufc5/deadbeat_husband_and_done_with_everyone/,Deadbeat husband and done with everyone.,"Husband has decided to become a deadbeat in addition to being an asshole. At first he was doing well making $100,000 a year. Then that job turned into a nightmare. Instead of being resilient and moving on.. he decided to quit and sit on his ass for a few months. Our kids are 3&5 and I’ve been a sahm for 5 years. Obviously I am stressed tf out because now I am in survival mode because of this man. I feel completely betrayed. He has been working odd jobs with a friend to pay the mortgage but thats it. My credit cards haven’t been paid in months. I was able to pull a small Christmas together by selling stuff here and there. But he was willing to just shrug Christmas off this year.

  
My car got totalled two months ago. Based on that and being broke I wasn’t feeling Christmas dinner this year. I said we could just do pizza or something easy. Its zero hour here. Husband says “you could just go shopping”. Dude. Go shopping for groceries on Christmas Eve in traffic in a truck that overheats.. with barely any money. I put a smile on my face always anyway and planned on doing it. But I didn’t feel like it.

Husband has been vague about how much money we had to budget for groceries. So he finally tells me $50. $50 for Christmas Eve and Christmas dinner. Ugh, that isn’t alot. Thats going to be very hard to do. He is dismissive over it. 

I’m getting ready to go. He asks me to ”do him a favor and stop at Lowes”. By this time I am highly annoyed. Dude I have no desire to stand in line at Lowes. I don’t even want to go to the grocery store right now. He asks like ITA for not wanting to go to Lowes for him! I look at him like “why are you treating me this way?“ He can never empathize with me. Instead of understanding me and giving me grace he calls me passive aggressive.

  
I flipped. I said fuck it. I’m not going anywhere and fuck you. I threw the keys down, made myself a coffee, made the kids a pb&j and left the room. I told him to figure it out. I told him I refuse to be disrespected.

No apology. He’s now on the way to the grocery store. And Lowes I guess.",36,1766602140.0,breakingmom,18,0.92,False

1puud6r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1puud6r,Repairing a Bonavita 382510v kettle,"Hey folks,

We recently had a kettle die on us and I did some work to diagnose and fix the kettle.  I thought it would be good to document here for others experiencing the same thing.

TLDR: replaced the thermal fuse

##Symptoms##
Kettle powered on but would not heat water.  Temp reading was accurate, but nothing else was happening.

##diagnosis##
Opened up the bottom of the kettle and used a digital multimeter to check integrity of circuits.  Identified the component that was failing, the wire with the insulated sleave.  Picture 1

##parts##
192C 15A thermal fuse (https://www.amazon.com/MECCANIXITY-Temperature-Connector-Transformer-Industrial/dp/B0F6V8PGX9/ref=mp_s_a_1_1_pp)

This kit comes with the non-insulated butt connectors. But you may need to order those separately.  Especially if you are in non-US region and your fuse is different.  You should be able to read the part off the dead fuse to replace.  

##tools##
Crimper (https://www.amazon.com/Crimping-Amliber-Connectors-Electrical-Terminals/dp/B0D1FR76Q7/ref=mp_s_a_1_1_sspa)

Screw driver Phillips 1
Screw driver Triangle 3

The triangle 3 bit was from my ifixit pro tech toolkit (https://www.ifixit.com/products/pro-tech-toolkit)

##steps to fix##
1: use the triangle 3 screw driver to remove the three base screws and remove the base (picture 2)
2: use the Phillips 1 screw driver to remove the clip holding the insulated sleeve down. (Make sureinsulated sleeve stays on the wire (Picture 4))
3: slide the sleeve to one end of the wire to reveal the thermal fuse (picture 3)
4: using the crimpers crush the butt connectors in such a way that they squeeze open.
5: remove the thermal fuse
6: using new butt connectors crimp the new thermal fuse in place
7: cut any excess wire off the butt connector.
8: slide the insulated sleeve back over the fuse
9: reattach the clip with Phillips 1 screw driver 
10: reattach base with the triangle 3 screw driver
11: enjoy coffee

We live together, split rent, and on paper we’re good: same friend group, same routines, same stupid shows at night. The problem is I’ve always been the one who smooths everything over. If she’s stressed, I apologize first. If we fight, I’m the one who writes the long text, offers the plan, makes the coffee, and pretends I’m fine so the evening isn’t ""ruined"". My therapist would probably call it people pleasing, I call it keeping the peace. A couple months ago I had a pretty bad week at work (not a coworker drama thing, just deadlines) and I realized I was constantly tense. Like, jaw clenched while loading the dishwasher tense. I booked therapy after I caught myself practicing conversations in the shower and getting mad at imaginary replies. My therapist gave me some homework: pause before agreeing, stop reflexively fixing her moods, and say what I actually want without adding a bunch of apologies. It sounds simple but it’s been messing with our usual dynamic. The first time I said “I’m not up for going to your sister’s tonight, I need a quiet night” she stared at me like I’d insulted her mom. I didn’t yell, I didn’t lecture. I just said it, and then I made pasta and ate it. She spent the night on the other end of the couch scrolling with her AirPods in, super pointed. Since then, every time I don’t instantly bend, she calls it my “therapy personality.” Last week she asked to look at my phone because “you’re secretive lately.” I said no, and that I’m allowed some privacy. She told me I’m acting single now and that therapy is making me selfish. This morning I noticed she’d taken my printed session notes off the fridge (I put them there next to the grocery list, yeah I know it’s nerdy) and shoved them in a drawer under the batteries and random takeout menus. She then sent me a screenshot of my calendar invite that literally says “Therapy” and wrote: “This is who you are now. Cold. Detached. You used to be sweet.” The thing is, I still do stuff. I still cook, still pay bills, still ask about her day. I just don’t do the frantic extra layer where I manage her feelings for her. I’m also trying not to do the thing where I apologize for existing in my own apartment. She says she misses the old me and that I’m ""withholding affection"" because I don’t chase after her when she goes silent. I feel like she misses the version of me that never pushed back, and I’m kinda angry about it. But I also get that change is weird and maybe I’m being harsh without realizing. So AITJ for changing the way I respond, and not going back to the old pattern even though it’s making her upset?

With the economy the way it is, and the level of debt we carry as a society, Christmas traditions can feel like we’re purposely jamming our bare toes into the coffee table... but we keep smiling, buying, and eating anyway.

Possible solution - give loved ones a list of functional gifts. If you’re doing home renos, for example: “Here’s the exact brand and colour of epoxy floor paint I need,” or “A stocking full of caulk would actually be amazing.” Then reciprocate - remove the stress of finding the perfect gift and turn it into a useful shopping errand.

1puu3df,https://i.redd.it/bfzc2h2u379g1.jpeg,"""A New Groom at the End of My Old Nightmare"" help me find","**Chapter 1**
It had been the seventh year since Evelyn Harrington lost the use of her legs.

That was when she realized that the new housekeeper her husband had hired looked eerily similar to the hit-and-run driver who had crippled her all those years ago.

But Alistair Carter insisted, ""Evelyn, there's no way I'd ever put the person who hurt you anywhere near you. You must just be exhausted and mistaken her for someone else.""

After Alistair left, Evelyn's fingers dug into the edge of the photograph, her knuckles turning pale.

In the photo, against a dim, shadowy background, there was only the killer's eyes.

Those slightly upturned eyes matched Lena Moore's almost perfectly.

\*\*\*

Every time Lena looked at her, there was a vicious glint she couldn't hide. A chill crept up Evelyn's spine.

She spun her wheelchair toward the study, intent on finding Alistair.

She was going to call the police and expose Lena for who she really was.

But just as her hand reached the door, it froze in midair. The moment she heard that name, the blood in her veins seemed to stop.

""Where's Lena? I want Lena!"" Alistair's voice was sharp with impatience.

""Alistair, keep your voice down. You were the one who deliberately arranged for Lena to come into the Carter Estate. If Evelyn ever finds out, how will you ever explain this?""

Alistair's voice carried the rough edge of drunkenness, mixed with a smug confidence. ""So what if I did?""

""If I didn't keep her close, how was I supposed to protect her? Back then, it was her father who broke Evelyn's legs.""

""When Evelyn wanted to pursue it, if I hadn't stepped in, Lena would've been dragged down by all the gossip and rumors!""

Evelyn's wheelchair came to an abrupt stop outside the door. Her entire body went cold.

The person who destroyed her legs… was Lena's father?

After that so-called ""accident"" seven years ago, she had blacked out. All she knew was that the driver had fled the scene.

Alistair had told her, ""The police are investigating. Don't worry.""

She believed him.

Only now did she realize that the one who hit her had been hidden away by Alistair all along, and that even the culprit's daughter had been openly brought into the Carter Estate under the guise of a ""housekeeper""!

""But for Lena's sake, you even drugged Evelyn's milk to worsen her condition. If that ever gets exposed…""

Alistair let out a soft laugh, his tone chillingly assured. ""Exposed? I personally hand her the milk every morning. She drinks it and feels so groggy that she can't even be bothered with follow-up checkups. How would she ever find out?""

""Besides, she's nothing but a cripple stuck in a wheelchair now. Who else can she rely on if not me?""

The milk! Evelyn instantly pictured Alistair handing her a cup of warm milk every morning, the temperature just right. He would smile and say, ""Here, Evelyn, drink up. It's good for you.""

And after drinking it, she would remain drowsy until noon, her thoughts dull, her mind slow.

So all that ""tenderness"" had been a lie.

Alistair's childhood friend spoke again, disbelief thick in his voice, ""Back then, you schemed tirelessly to make Evelyn rely on you just so you could marry her. And now, for Lena's sake, you're treating her this way...""

Alistair cut him off, irritation clear in his tone, ""Things change!""

""Back then, I was just intrigued by her aloof, untouchable aura. I wanted to be the one who finally reached her. Now I'm sick of it. Just looking at her in that wheelchair annoys me.""

""Lena's different. She's gentle, considerate, she truly cares for me…""

Evelyn couldn't hear the rest. Her ears rang violently, and tears fell without warning onto the armrest of her wheelchair, splashing into tiny droplets.

She hadn't yet recovered from the suffocating truth when footsteps sounded behind her.

""Ms. Harrington, what are you doing here?""

Lena's voice was sickeningly sweet, deliberately avoiding the title ""Mrs.""

She was wearing the limited-edition silk robe Alistair had given Evelyn last year. The neckline dipped low, exposing faint red marks along her collarbone.

Evelyn's fingers were icy cold. She bit down hard on her lip, refusing to let a single sob escape.

Lena stepped closer, deliberately bending down and whispering into her ear, her voice low enough for only the two of them to hear, ""Do you know what it feels like when the man you love falls for someone else? It must hurt, doesn't it?""

""Oh, and I didn't prepare dinner for you tonight. After all, what's the point? Someone who can't even make it to the dining table would only be wasting good food.""

With that, she straightened up and pushed open the bedroom door.

Evelyn heard it clearly, the way Alistair's voice softened the instant he saw Lena.

""Lena, you finally came! Come on, let me hold you…""

The wheelchair rolled away without making a sound.

Evelyn fled back to her room, shutting the door behind her, but the cruel words echoed over and over in her mind.

On the desk sat the first gift Alistair had ever given her seven years ago, a doll that looked just like her.

He had searched all over Chicago to find it.

Back then, everything felt so real.

He would bathe and massage her himself every day after the accident, whispering, ""Eve, I'm here with you.""

When she cried in secret over her inability to stand, he would hold her close and promise, ""Don't be afraid. As long as I'm here, I'll take care of you for life.""

He remembered all her preferences. Her breakfast milk had to be warmed to exactly 120°F. Her coffee needed two spoons of sugar. Even a niche band she had casually mentioned once, he would quietly secure concert tickets for.

But now she understood. His massages were to deepen her dependence on him.

He said he would take care of her for life because he had already cut off her chance of ever standing again.

And his meticulous attention to her preferences? Merely part of the act, to play the role of the ""devoted husband"" more convincingly.

Evelyn finally broke down in tears.

She dialed the number she hadn't called in seven years.

The moment the call connected, her voice trembled, thick with sobs, ""Dad, I… I agree to the marriage alliance with the Locke family.""

""Send someone to pick me up in three days.""


**Chapter 2**
Early the next morning.

Evelyn sat in her wheelchair, her fingers unconsciously brushing along the edge of the tablecloth.

The harsh truths from the night before kept circling in her mind, the dull ache in her chest tightening one wave after another.

Footsteps sounded on the stairs. Alistair came down, rubbing his temples. His face still showed the fatigue of a hangover, yet his tone was deliberately gentle, as if nothing had happened.

""Evelyn, I drank too much at a business dinner last night. I didn't want to wake you, so I slept in the guest room. I didn't disturb your rest, did I?""

As he spoke, he walked to the dining table, naturally picked up the cup of milk the staff had just warmed, and held it out to Evelyn.

""It's just been heated. You're used to drinking this in the morning. Have it while it's warm.""

Steam rose from the cup. The pale liquid swayed gently inside, just like the false tenderness Alistair had carefully maintained for seven long years.

Evelyn stared at the milk, her fingertips ice-cold.

""I don't want it right now.""

Her voice was soft, but distant and firm. For the first time, she didn't reach out to take it.

Alistair's hand paused briefly. A flicker of surprise crossed his eyes, but he didn't press the issue. He only set the cup down beside her.

""Then I'll reheat it later if you feel like drinking.""

Evelyn didn't look at the milk again. She turned to the servant instead, ""Bring my cod liver oil.""

Her sleep had been poor lately. The doctor had suggested cod liver oil, and Alistair had always instructed the staff to prepare them daily.

The servant suddenly began to stammer, ""M-Mrs. Carter… Ms. Moore said the family needs to cut back on expenses, so… so your cod liver oil was stopped.""

Evelyn's gaze snapped toward the corner of the room, where Lena stood. ""Cut back on expenses?""

Lena was wearing a brand-new servant uniform, deliberately leaving the neckline loose. Faint red marks showed along her collarbone.

Hearing this, Lena stepped forward at once, putting on an air of righteous concern. ""Ms. Harrington, I'm not trying to overstep, but the supplements you take every day cost more than what an ordinary person spends in a month.""

""There are people outside who can't even afford food. I just don't want Mr. Carter to be criticized for extravagance. After all, the Carter family still has its reputation to maintain.""

She emphasized the word ""extravagance,"" her voice noticeably louder, as if making sure Evelyn heard every syllable.

Evelyn had been taking these supplements for seven years. No one had ever called them ""extravagance.""

She lifted her head and looked at Alistair.

But Alistair only frowned slightly. He walked over to Lena, his tone clearly biased. ""Evelyn, Lena does have a point. You haven't been very active lately. Too many supplements won't digest well. Maybe eat less from now on and spend more time in the garden. It'll be better for your health.""

The words cut through Evelyn's heart like a dull blade.

He knew perfectly well she couldn't stand. ""Move around more"" was nothing but an empty line.

He knew Lena was deliberately provoking her, yet he still chose to stand by her side, even adding his own veiled criticism.

Evelyn looked at the two people in front of her. One pretending to act for the good of the Carter family. The other willingly sided with an outsider.

Seven years of love, seven years of devotion, were shattered completely in that moment.

She didn't argue. She simply nodded lightly, her voice calm and lifeless, ""Alright. Whatever you say.""

Alistair assumed she had given in. He let out a quiet sigh of relief and turned to Lena, ""Go get the documents from my study. I'm heading to the office soon.""

Lena smiled immediately and agreed. As she passed Evelyn, she deliberately bumped her shoulder against the wheelchair, her eyes full of smug triumph.

Evelyn ignored the provocation and lowered her gaze to her hands.

Those hands had once been held in Alistair's palms as he promised to protect her for a lifetime.

Now, they couldn't even protect a safe cup of milk or the little supplements she had relied on for years.

The moment Alistair's car disappeared beyond the villa gates, the obedient mask on Lena's face shattered.

She clicked across the living room in sharp heels and slammed an empty jewelry box onto the coffee table in front of Evelyn.

""Ms. Harrington, the household needs to save money now. All these jewels of yours are just sitting in the closet collecting dust. I might as well keep them. After all, sooner or later, they'll be mine.""

Without waiting for Evelyn to respond, Lena stormed into the walk-in closet, shoving diamond necklaces and limited-edition handbags Alistair had given over the past seven years into the box, her movements rough, like she was throwing away trash.

Evelyn sat in her wheelchair, her fingers clenched until they turned pale.

Only when Lena turned back with the box full of jewelry did Evelyn slowly raise her eyes, her voice cold as ice, ""Do you know Victor Moore?""

The name struck like thunder. The box slipped from Lena's hands with a crash. A diamond bracelet rolled across the floor, chiming softly against the tiles.

Her face paled abruptly, but then her eyes widened as if struck where it hurt most, and she shot back with a sharp, defensive question, ""How do you know that name? Have you been digging into things?""

Seeing her reaction, Evelyn's heart sank completely.

So it was all true!

Before Evelyn could speak again, Lena suddenly dropped all pretense, a twisted smile spreading across her face. ""Yes. Victor is my father. He's the one who hit you seven years ago.""

She stepped closer, looking down at Evelyn from above. ""You really think Alistair married you because he loved you? Don't be ridiculous. He only put on that act of 'marrying you out of guilt' to keep you quiet!""

""And if it weren't for him helping us at the police station, falsifying testimony to pin all the blame on you for jaywalking, my father would have been behind bars years ago!""

Evelyn's breathing stalled.

But Lena kept talking, as if she had been waiting seven years to spill everything, ""You think not being able to stand after this long time was just an accident?""

""It was Alistair. He put drugs in your milk every single day, just in case you ever recovered and came after us. Keeping you by his side was only so he could hold you tightly in his grasp, like a decoration that would never fight back.""

Her smile grew even more triumphant. ""As for why I came here as a housekeeper.""

""That was Alistair's arrangement, too. He got sick of you, a cripple, a long time ago. He just needed an excuse to bring me in, so I could slowly replace you.""

""The supplements you eat, the jewelry you wear, all of it will be mine. Even the position of Mrs. Carter.""

She deliberately emphasized the word ""cripple"" and gave the wheel of Evelyn's chair a sharp kick.

""You can't even stand up now, and you think you can fight me? The one Alistair loves is me. You're nothing but a useless placeholder.""

**Chapter 3**
Evelyn was shaking with rage, her whole body trembling. Her fingers dug hard into her palms, the metallic taste of blood spreading across her tongue.

Lena only laughed more arrogantly. She turned and barked at the servants, ""Take Ms. Harrington to the attic and let her reflect properly.""

The servants exchanged uneasy looks, none of them daring to move.

Lena immediately raised her voice. ""I'm the one Alistair loves most. If you don't listen to me, believe me, I'll have Alistair fire every single one of you.""

The servants didn't dare disobey. They pushed Evelyn's wheelchair toward the attic.

The narrow attic was thick with dust. Only a small window let in a faint strip of light. Cold wind slipped through the cracks, chilling Evelyn until she couldn't stop shivering.

She called out for the servants, but no one answered.

Lena had already given strict orders. No food. No water.

An entire day passed without a single drop to drink. Hunger and cold left Evelyn dizzy, her vision blurring.

It wasn't until night had fully fallen that Lena finally came to open the door. She stood above Evelyn, looking down at her, her tone full of threat. ""Evelyn, don't think you can run and tattle. Even if you tell Alistair everything that happened today, he'll only believe me.""

""You're just a useless burden who can't even stand. I'm the one he keeps closest to his heart.""

Evelyn didn't speak. She only looked at Lena with a cold, unblinking stare.

The look made Lena uneasy. She shot Evelyn a vicious glare, then ordered the servants to push her back downstairs.

They had just reached the living room when Alistair came home.

He took off his coat and walked straight over to Evelyn, bending down to give her a gentle hug. Then he pulled a velvet jewelry box from his briefcase.

""Evelyn, I passed a jewelry store today and thought of you. This necklace should suit you. Take a look. Do you like it?""

Inside the box lay a diamond necklace, dazzling and brilliant. It was the exact style Evelyn had once said she liked.

Lena stood nearby. The moment she saw the necklace, her eyes reddened with jealousy. Her fingers clenched tightly at the hem of her clothes, but she didn't dare say a word.

Evelyn looked at Alistair's gentle face and spoke coldly, ""Alistair, Lena locked me in the attic today. I wasn't given anything to eat or drink all day…""

The smile on Alistair's face vanished instantly. His expression darkened.

Lena panicked at once. She rushed forward, grabbing his arm, her eyes already red. ""Alistair, I didn't mean it. I just thought Ms. Harrington had been staying in her room too much and wanted her to get some fresh air in the attic.""

""I didn't expect the servants to misunderstand and forget to bring food… I was only trying to do what was best for her.""

It was such a clumsy excuse that Evelyn was certain Alistair wouldn't believe it.

But he only frowned slightly. His tone softened as he patted Lena's hand, ""Alright. I know you didn't mean it. Just be more careful next time.""

Lena immediately put on a wronged expression and shot Evelyn a smug, triumphant glance.

Alistair turned to Evelyn, impatience creeping into his voice, ""Evelyn, Lena didn't do it on purpose. Don't hold it against her.""

Evelyn's heart went completely cold. ""Didn't do it on purpose?""

""She locked me in the attic for a whole day without food or water, and that's supposed to be for my own good?""

Alistair avoided her gaze. After a brief silence, he spoke in a low voice, ""Evelyn, you don't know this, but when I was a child, I once got lost. Lena was the one who saved me. I owe her my life. I can't let her be wronged. Just be more understanding and stop clashing with her, alright?""

Evelyn found it absurd. ""A life-saving debt? So that means she can bully me whenever she wants? Lock me up like a prisoner?""

Alistair's tone grew cold, ""Evelyn, I know you've been wronged. But Lena's situation is special. Don't bring up what happened today again. I'll make up to you.""

Watching him protect Lena so openly, Evelyn suddenly laughed so hard her tears nearly spilled over.
So in his heart, her seven years by his side meant less than Lena's so-called life-saving debt.

Evelyn lowered her head, tears streaming down uncontrollably.

She whispered softly, ""But Alistair, do you even know that back then… the one who saved you was me?""

**Chapter 4**
Alistair seemed not to have heard what Evelyn said. He looked at her, confused, ""What did you just say?""

The next second, Lena's eyes reddened. She clutched Alistair's sleeve and gave it a gentle shake, her voice heavy with deliberate grievance. ""Alistair, did I do something wrong that made Ms. Harrington dislike me?""

""If that's the case, I should leave. I don't want the two of you to fight because of me. I never meant to interfere between you and Ms. Harrington…""

As she spoke, she took a step back, as if preparing to leave.

Alistair grabbed her immediately, his voice urgent in a way Evelyn had never heard before. ""You're not going anywhere. This is your home. Who told you to leave? Evelyn just misunderstood something. Don't take it to heart.""

He turned to Evelyn, his eyes filled with unmistakable reproach, as if she were the one being unreasonable.

Evelyn's fingers trembled uncontrollably. Her nails dug deep into her palm, the taste of blood spreading across her tongue.

Seven years of devotion. Seven years of hope. In that moment, they shattered into nothing.

Lena leaned into Alistair's arms. She secretly lifted her gaze toward Evelyn, a smug smile curling at the corner of her lips.

Alistair patted her back softly, murmuring reassurance. Only after Lena finally stopped crying did he turn and head for the bedroom.

The instant the bedroom door closed, Evelyn finally found her voice again. It was light as a breath, yet steadier than ever before, ""Alistair, let's get divorced.""

The tenderness on Alistair's face vanished at once. He spun around sharply, his eyes turning vicious, ""What did you say?""

""Divorce? Evelyn, do you even know what you're saying?""

Evelyn lifted her head to meet his gaze. Tears finally fell. ""I do.""

""I don't want to live like this anymore. There's no place for me in your heart, only Lena. Our marriage was a lie from the very beginning. It should end now.""

Alistair flew into a sudden rage. He grabbed her wrist, gripping so hard it felt as if her bones might shatter. ""A lie? Evelyn, haven't I treated you well enough? The jewelry you wanted, the accessories, what did I ever refuse you?""

""Just because of some trivial issue with Lena, you want a divorce? Can you stop being so petty?""

Evelyn looked at his twisted expression and laughed through her tears. ""Trivial?""

""You call this trivial? You lie to me again and again for her, protect her every single time, and you call that trivial? Alistair, what is your heart even made of?""

Alistair flung her hand away, his tone hard and absolute. ""I don't care!""

""Divorce is impossible. Unless I'm dead, you're not leaving me in this lifetime. Where do you think you can go? Without me, you're nothing. A cripple who can't even stand.""

The word ""cripple"" struck Evelyn's heart like a poisoned blade.

She looked at the man in front of her, familiar yet utterly strange, and finally woke up completely.

He had never loved her. He had only treated her as something he owned, something that could never escape.

The argument in the bedroom grew louder and louder. Alistair's grip on Evelyn's chin still hadn't loosened when a loud crash sounded outside the door.

A glass slipped from Lena's hand and shattered on the floor. Water seeped through the crack beneath the door.

She stood in the doorway, her face pale, her eyes filled with panic and venom. ""Alistair! I don't feel well. Can you take me to the hospital?""

**Chapter 5**
The moment Alistair heard Lena say she felt ""unwell,"" he didn't spare Evelyn so much as a glance.

He bent down, scooped Lena up in his arms, and rushed toward the door, urgency flooding his voice, ""Hang in there, Lena. I'm taking you to the hospital right now.""

No one expected Lena to suddenly wrench herself free. She stumbled toward Evelyn in her wheelchair and dropped to her knees with a thud. Tears streamed down her face like broken pearls.

""Evelyn, what did I ever do to upset you? Why would you drug my food? I only wanted to take good care of you and Alistair. How could you do this to me…""

Evelyn's fingers clenched hard around the wheelchair armrests, her knuckles whitening. Her voice trembled with disbelief, ""I didn't. How could you…""

Before she could finish, Alistair strode forward. His tall frame blocked the light above Evelyn, anger nearly spilling from his eyes, ""Evelyn, look at Lena. She waits on you hand and foot every single day, tending to all your needs, and this is how you repay her? How can you be so vicious, so twisted inside?""

Evelyn's eyes reddened, her hands shaking as she clenched them tight. ""Alistair, you believe her and not me?""

Alistair cut her off sharply, ""That's enough!""

""Stop making up lies to smear Lena. It seems your legs aren't the only thing that's broken—your heart has rotted along with them!""

When he bent to lift Lena again, his tone softened instantly, ""Lena, don't waste your breath on her. We're going to the hospital now.""

Resting against Alistair's shoulder, Lena seized the moment while he lowered his head to wipe her tears. Her eyes flashed cold. Her right hand shot out and shoved the wheelchair handle hard.

The wheelchair slid along the stair railing. Evelyn screamed as she and the chair tumbled down the steps.

Her back slammed into the last stair. A tearing pain ripped through her lower abdomen.

She lifted her head, looking up at Alistair standing at the top of the stairs. Her voice was so weak it felt like a candle flickering in the wind, ""Alistair… help me… my stomach hurts so badly…""

In Alistair's arms, Lena let out a timely groan. ""Alistair, my head feels dizzy. Hurry up…""

Alistair's gaze lingered on Evelyn's agonized face for no more than two seconds. Then he turned away with Lena in his arms, leaving behind only a cold sentence, ""You brought this on yourself. Think about what you've done.""

The footsteps faded. Evelyn could clearly hear the faint, satisfied laugh Lena hid against Alistair's chest.

Warm blood slowly seeped down Evelyn's dress, staining the cracks between the steps a dark red.

She clutched her abdomen as her consciousness drifted further and further away.

Then everything went black.

When she woke again, the white ceiling made Evelyn's eyes ache. The sharp smell of disinfectant filled her nose, and even her breathing was cold and sterile.

A servant stood by the bed, eyes red. Seeing Evelyn awake, she hurried over, ""Mrs. Carter, you're finally awake! I saw you lying at the bottom of the stairs and rushed you to the hospital.""

""I called Mr. Carter, but he said… he said you were deliberately competing with Ms. Moore for attention and told you to stay here and reflect…""

The word ""reflect"" pierced Evelyn's chest like a needle.

She bit her lip, forcing back the sob rising in her throat. Her heart felt like it was being gnawed apart, the pain so sharp she had to press a hand over her chest and gasp for air.

Not long after, the doctor walked in holding the test results. Even the creases in his white coat looked heavy with gravity, his tone cautious, ""Ms. Harrington… please stay calm and listen carefully.""

""Based on the examination, you were six weeks pregnant. But because of the severe impact from the fall, the baby… couldn't be saved.""

Evelyn's body stiffened. Her eyes went blank.

The doctor sighed and continued, ""There's still residual tissue in your uterus. A procedure needs to be done as soon as possible.""

""Otherwise, it could affect your future health and even your ability to conceive. Is your husband here? We need a family member's signature and to discuss post-op care.""

""The baby… is gone?"" Evelyn finally found her voice, hoarse, as if scraped raw.

She slowly looked down at her abdomen. It was still flat. The child who had quietly arrived amid lies and betrayal was gone at last.

""I don't have a husband,"" she said softly. ""The surgery… I'll sign for it myself.""

Chapter 6
The doctor froze for a moment, about to say something else.

The room door was gently pushed open. Two nurses passed by with a tray for changing dressings, whispering to each other, ""Ms. Moore in Bed Three is really lucky. Her boyfriend is good-looking and rich. He's been with her the entire time, even feeding her water himself, afraid she might suffer the slightest bit.""

Evelyn's heart clenched sharply. Supporting her weak body, she asked hoarsely, ""Excuse me… the Ms. Moore you're talking about… who is she?""

One of the nurses paused, then smiled. ""Ms. Lena Moore, of course. I heard her boyfriend is Alistair Carter, the CEO of Carter Group. He's incredibly handsome and so attentive to her. It's really enviable.""

""Alistair.""

""Boyfriend.""

Those words slammed into Evelyn's chest like heavy blows. Her fingers tightened around the bedsheet, knuckles turning pale.

So in everyone else's eyes, her husband had already become Lena's ""boyfriend.""

And she, the so-called Mrs. Carter, was nothing more than a redundant joke.

The nurse beside her kept talking, ""I heard Ms. Moore just has mild hypoglycemia, but Mr. Carter panicked. He called in specialists and arranged private care. He really treats her like something precious…""

Each word was like a needle, piercing Evelyn's heart again and again.

The operating room lights switched on. Cold white light reflected off Evelyn's pale face.

As the nurses wheeled her inside, icy instruments brushed against her arm. She didn't even have the strength to flinch, only stared at the ceiling.

There was no Alistair there. Only the fading warmth of the child she had lost.

At the end of the corridor, Lena leaned against Alistair's chest, her fingers winding around his sleeve as she spoke softly, ""Alistair, the doctor said it's just low blood sugar. Don't frown like that.""

Alistair lowered his head, his thumb gently massaging her temple, his voice impossibly tender. ""From now on, I'll have my assistant make sure you eat all three meals. You're not allowed to scare me like this again.""

A servant hurried past holding a consent form for a D&C procedure. Seeing the two of them, she hesitated, then spoke up anyway, ""Sir, Mrs. Carter is also at this hospital. She's just been taken into surgery. The consent form needs your signature…""

Alistair's hand, which had been holding Lena's, paused briefly. His brows knit together, irritation filling his voice, ""What's wrong with her now? Is she not done making trouble every day? Just keep an eye on her. Lena still needs me.""

He didn't even ask what kind of surgery it was. After signing his name, he shoved the form back into the nurse's hands and turned to adjust Lena's scarf, the concern in his eyes unchanged.

Inside the operating room, the anesthesia slowly flowed into Evelyn's veins.

As her consciousness blurred, she seemed to hear Alistair's words, ""not done making trouble.""

A bitter smile tugged at the corner of her lips.

He didn't know that what she had lost was their child.

When Evelyn finally made it back home, exhausted and barely holding herself together, Alistair and Lena still hadn't returned.

She turned her wheelchair and slowly entered the bedroom. Opening the closet, she folded her clothes piece by piece, packing them into a suitcase she had prepared in advance.

She took none of the jewelry Alistair had given her. Only a few plain, everyday outfits went into the case.

After finishing, she opened her phone and gathered screenshots of Lena's vicious messages, along with the audio recordings she had secretly saved of Lena threatening her.

She organized everything into a folder and sent it to Alistair's email.

Then she placed the hospital's miscarriage confirmation form and the wedding ring she had polished smooth with seven years of touch together on the coffee table in the living room.

Beside the ring, she pressed down a slip of paper with only one line written on it: \[Alistair, seven years of lies end here.\]

After doing all that, Evelyn took a deep breath. She braced both hands on the wheelchair armrests and slowly pushed herself up.

Post-surgery weakness made her whole body tremble. Her legs felt as heavy as lead. The moment she straightened, she staggered and collapsed to the floor, sharp pain shooting through her knees.

She gritted her teeth and didn't cry out. Planting her palms on the floor, she tried again.

Once. Twice. Three times… On the fourth attempt, she finally managed to stand by leaning against the wall. Her legs were still shaking, but she took her first step forward.

Every step felt like walking on blades, yet her eyes grew brighter with each one.

She would never again be the Evelyn trapped in a wheelchair, at the mercy of others.

Holding onto the wall, she moved inch by inch toward the villa entrance.

Just as she reached the door, more than a dozen black cars pulled up at once. The windows rolled down, and her family's old butler rushed over with red-rimmed eyes, his voice choking with emotion, ""Miss, you've finally agreed to come back! Mr. Harrington and Mrs. Harrington have been waiting for you, hoping every single day for seven years!""

Evelyn looked at the familiar face. The tension she had held for seven years finally eased. She nodded softly, her voice hoarse from surgery, ""I'm fine.""

She turned back for one last look at the Carter Estate.

This place that had imprisoned her for seven years, filled with lies and pain, looked especially cold beneath the setting sun.

She didn't hesitate again. Turning around, she walked toward the lead car. The butler hurried to support her, carefully helping her inside.

The cars slowly pulled away, leaving the Carter Estate behind.

Evelyn leaned back against the seat, gazing at the gray sky outside the window.

Lena would never know that the ""deep devotion"" she enjoyed had been paid for with Evelyn's seven years of youth, a pair of legs that could no longer stand, and a child who was never born.

And this blood-soaked debt, Alistair and Lena would one day repay, piece by piece.

1puu2xr,https://i.redd.it/oeyqig5kh69g1.jpeg,Reviews of the Fragrances I own (#5),"Here I am, this time with my last Smytten haul (and the only time I've ever seen TDH on there). Again, just like my previous posts, I haven't tried any designers or niche perfumes yet, so I won't be comparing these with anything- just my nose and my thoughts coming together to explain the scent profile and the performance in the best way possible.

This has a lot of different fragrances so this will be a pretty long post. Sit back, relax, take your time while you read these out. Here we go:

**1. Bella Vita CEO Man (5/10):**

Got this one mainly because I had 1 trial point left, and nothing else seemed worth it. Surprisingly a good one from the brand- opens up with a mild alcohol blast, then becomes fruity with mango being the most prominent note. It's like the Mango Bite toffee we used to get a few years ago (sweet, sticky), fairly linear with a slightly woody dry down. It's pleasant and I'd have rated it at least a 7 if only it lasted for a longer time. This won't make you nose blind, but it has the same problem as most of the BV fragrances- longevity is poor, and abysmal on the skin. You can barely smell it on your wrist even with your nose dug into it after an hour or so.

*Projection - Around 20-25 mins*  
*Longevity - Approx. 3.5-4ish hours (weak)*

**2. Lone Wolf White Fang (2/10):**

So, this brand was constantly being shoved into my face whenever I used to go to the Trials section. 3 ml for 1 point was decent enough, but then they gave our 2x3ml combos for 1 point, so I had to get these 4. They're priced in the 1500-2500 range so you're probably better off getting MEs. White Fang by far is my least favorite of the bunch. You get an extremely loud alcohol blast that goes straight up your nose, and it stays on for quite a while. Even when it goes away, you can still figure out that it's too synthetic- enough to give you a mild headache since it constantly keeps getting in your nose. Coming to the scent profile (or at least what I could figure out), the citrus, fresh and floral notes are not blended well imo, and this is not something I'd suggest anyone to even try.

*Projection - Around 30 mins (most of it being the alcohol blast)*  
*Longevity - Approx. 3ish hours*

**3. Lone Wolf Lucifer (4/10):**

This is a decent leather fragrance that will somewhat remind you of Beardo Whiskey Smoke Bourbon (the only leather cheapie I own). The low rating may also be due to my less affinity towards leather as a note, so you can try it out for once. This one opens with a milder alcohol blast, and slowly you start getting slightly bitter whiffs, and then the leather comes up. The official notes mentioned are amber, raspberry, suede leather, jasmine (so ig they tried to clone TF Tuscan Leather?), but the leather is the most prominent. As you move towards the dry down, you start getting a sweet smell along with the leather which actually makes it smell better, and I believe comes from the amber note in it. Longevity is an issue and you'll get better options for this scent profile in this, or even lower price range. Has a cool bottle though.

*Projection - Around 30-40 mins*  
*Longevity - Around 4 hours*

**4. Lone Wolf Black (5.5/10):**

Now this was the first LW that I actually liked. It's more suited for the Oct-Nov weather, when it's not too hot nor to cold. Opens with a nice coconut note, slightly fresh. This is the only fragrance I've liked so far with a coconut note (which didn't give me the oily vibe). With some time, some sweetness comes in slowly, which blends with the coconut and as you move further towards the dry down, you start noticing some leathery and tobacco notes. I believe this has been blended decently enough to not let the bitter notes take over. I know I mentioned leather not being my preferred note, but I could actually find myself liking it in this fragrance. Definitely a masculine one. Again, performance is not the best for this price.

*Projection - Around 30 mins of weak projection*  
*Longevity - Not more than 4 hours*

**5. Lone Wolf Rebellion (7/10):**

My favorite fragrance from this brand, rated a bit low due to performance issues and the higher price. The full bottle gives off Guerlain L'Homme Ideal Extreme vibes (only the bottle though :p). Scent profile wise, this smells amazing even though it's a fairly linear scent. Has an airy vibe around it as it opens with some citrus notes. The top notes wear off pretty quickly, and the vetiver comes out. Once that happens, you'll see that it maintains this scent for the rest of the time it's on. I'm into vetiver based fragrances, so I liked it a lot- even more so because it's an airy kind of vetiver and not the dark one (like the one I'll mention later in this post). I know this might be a bit of stretch, but for now this is one of my favorite vetiver based fragrances. If the longevity had been a LITTLE better, I could've gone for a full bottle even.

*Projection - Around 30 mins (weak)*  
*Longevity - Approx. 3ish hours*

**6. Titan Skinn Raw (8/10):**

Read a lot of good things about this on Reddit and Youtube. Everyone seems to suggest it whenever we talk about freshies with good quality. I feel like the hype is somewhat justified. This is fresh, and will work as a really good daily driver during the summers. Opens with a nice fresh, slightly citrusy vibe, moves towards a slightly white floral mid and then keeps on giving you those fresh whiffs every now and then. Initially when I sprayed it, it didn't seem anything special. But 2-3 weeks after getting it, it started showing some metallic characteristics, and that was working really well with the overall fresh profile- I liked it a lot. I even got a compliment from a guy in the office, he said that it will go really well in summers when you're wearing a suit or crisp formals. Longevity is decent for a freshie, although you'll have to top it up in the second half of your workday.

*Projection - Almost 1 hour of decent projection*  
*Longevity - Around 5ish hours*

**7. Titan Skinn Verge (5.5/10):**

Again, good reviews online. But unlike Raw, it didn't appeal to me that much. It's a decent mass pleasing scent- I'll give it that. But it's more of a personal opinion rather than a generalized one. This opens with a mild spicy note, fresh too. As time passes by, you can feel a sweetness coming up, which is almost bubblegummy sweet. It does go up the nose a bit, since it has that barbershoppy aspect to it as well, but only in the air not on the skin. I'd say it's somewhere between a mild Dior Sauvage, and a less sweet Rasasi Hawas. You can think of it like this- take Hawas, tone down the sweetness a bit, add some mild spices- you get Verge. Overall the profile is a bit linear. What I didn't like was that it gave some ""stale"" vibes (idk how to explain this), maybe it's due to the oakmoss? Idk.

*Projection - Around 40 mins (weak)*  
*Longevity - Around 4-4.5 hours max*

**8. Titan Skinn Amalfi Bleu (5.5/10):**

I'd read a lot of positive reviews about this on Reddit, so when I got the discovery set, I was pretty excited to try this one out. But I was really disappointed because to my nose, this was just a generic aquatic freshie with not a lot of depth. People might like it because of how safe it is to pull off, but that's just it. It's a safe scent that's all. It opens with a fresh, aquatic, mild citrus note, and slowly a VERY faint metallic nuance creeps in. I know this sounds the same as Raw, but trust me, it isn't. Not in the least. As it reaches the drydown, some musk comes out which keeps giving you whiffs every few minutes, so projection is decent. On its own, it isn't much special for me, but I have a feeling that you can overspray this, and then do a couple of sprays of YSL Y DNA to make this an easy 7.5-8/10 scent profile.

*Projection - Around 45 mins (weak)*  
*Longevity - At most 4 hours*

**9. Titan Skinn Country Road (9/10):**

This might be my favorite from the whole Titan discovery set. I like this even more than Raw for summers, and I really REALLY wish they had 20ml bottles for Country Road too. They don't know how much market they're missing out on by not having smaller bottles for Country Road and Mediterranean Grove (tried it once at a friend's house). The first time I opened it and sprayed in the air (I always do the first one in the air to see the mist), I smelled it and immediately went ""OOH THIS IS GOOD!"". I haven't said this for a lot of fragrances on the first go in my limited experience, so you know how good this was for me right off the bat. This is aquatic, slightly sweet (maybe from the tonka?) in the drydown and a little musky too. The use of red apple instead of the green one, gave it that edge which I was not expecting from a freshie. This isn't something you'll go nose blind to, and the whiffs will keep coming for quite some time too.

*Projection - Around an hour or so*  
*Longevity - Can go 5-5.5 hours easily (gets weaker in the latter half)*

**10. Titan Skinn Steel (8/10):**

Now this is the darkest of the lot. This is a ""grown man"" fragrance, and I feel like you have to be a little mature to enjoy it more. A bit difficult to understand as well, since Skinn typically uses notes you may not even have heard of. This opens with a relatively darker citrus top, and slowly starts becoming spicy. The base is sweet (they mentioned praline and tonka in the base notes sooo), and a little heavy- so you know this will be a good winter scent too. For me, Steel is to winters what Raw is to summers- a formal, suited up fragrance that is made to catch attention. It's more of a personal preference, and I don't think it's a mass pleasing scent profile because I've never gotten any compliments from this. Projection is really loud in the first 30 minutes and you'll keep getting pleasant whiffs for a much longer time. 

*Projection - Around 60-75 minutes*  
*Longevity - Almost  7-7.5 hours (lasts almost the whole workday for me)*

**11. Terre D'Hermes Eau Intense Vetiver (8.5/10):**

I like vetiver as a prominent note, so you know I had to get this as soon as it was available on Smytten (all hail Smytten!). I did it once, I'll do it again and again. You can say this was my first ever designer (?) and the quality difference between this and the clones is so damn obvious. This has no alcohol blast whatsoever, and opens with a really nice citrus top which is fresh and bright. The vetiver comes in fairly early and blends in really well with the citrusy top notes too. From here on, it's all about the hero note- a little mature, grown up vibe. It will work as a very nice daily wear during the humid weather. The projection is pretty good too. I know this because another guy in my office wears this, and everytime I walk past his cabin, I get strong whiffs even if his door is closed. This is not a scent profile that will get you compliments from girls though- it's like getting jacked and then being the center of attention of guys who start looking up to you.

*Projection - Around 1.5-2 hours (based on the whiffs I get from the office guy)*  
*Longevity - Easily 7-8 hours (Intense Vetiver is EDP while TDH is EDT, hence the better longevity)*

**12. Lalique Encre Noir (7/10):**

Okay here's a little fuck up from Smytten- I saw Encre Noir Sport on the app, and ordered that with the rest of my stuff. I wanted to try it because I'd heard it's a bit more playful and lighter than the OG. But somehow they sent me Encre Noir instead, and this seemed to have happened with a lot of guys back then. Nevertheless, I got to try this DNA and even though I didn't like it as much as I think I'd have liked sport, it's still a pretty good vetiver based fragrance from the Encre Noir line. I'll definitely try a decant of Sport at some later point of time. This one is more vetiver forward, but this time the vetiver is darker, more mature, a bit heavier(?), and more intense than TDH. I didn't like it the first time I sprayed it, but as I kept on trying it out more, it grew on me. Again, this is something you'd wear for yourself and not for compliments.

*Projection - About 45 minutes*  
*Longevity - Somewhere between 5-6 hours*

**13. Wild Stone Code Terra (8/10):**

When I said I liked vetiver as a note, I also meant it being a bit airy, and a bit brighter. TDH scratches that itch well for me, but it's too pricey for now. WS Terra is done really well- the price at which they're offering it, and with the closeness to the OG, I'd say this is punching above its weight. If I'm getting 70-75% of the brightness and quality of the OG at roughly 500-600, I'll definitely go for it. This is more citrusy in the opening, a bit more suited for the younger users, and once the vetiver comes in... I just keep smelling it over and over. This is a bit less personal, and something other guys will like smelling when you walk into the room. A little mass pleasing aspect here with the extra citrus, and the projection is really good too. The biggest USP, again, is the price point. Definitely a good choice if you want to experience the DNA but are on a limited budget.

*Projection - Almost an hour*  
*Longevity - Lasts for around 5-6 hours on my clothes*





Sooo that's all for today. This is my second time writing this post from scratch because my laptop went off after the 8th point 😭. Thankfully Good Keep has a version history so I could refer to my write-ups again for the reviews. I hope you liked reading them, and if you were thinking of buying any of these, your confusions were somewhat cleared :)

We'll meet next time with some more fragrances. I got 3 from Arabian Aroma, 4 from Menworks (5 including the free sample), and a bunch of decants which I'm excited to test out. I'm also planning to get the Revelation set by Ababel just to try out that Imagination and Megamare DNA. Do let me know what I should do next :)

Edit: Oh, before I go, can anyone tell me where I can get Al Rehab attars from? I have Choco Musk currently and now I wanna try French Coffee but the sites I was referring to have it out of stock. I'll be getting 2 more in addition to FC sooo another review material? 👀",10,1766601203.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,1,0.92,False

Herman Miller Eames chair with footrest.  
Media console and TV.  
Marble coffee table.   
Marble round side table.  
Small drink table.  
Arched lamp.  
Credenza.  
7 foot dining table.  

We are at a bit of a loss to figure out how to arrange the couch with respect to the TV so that the couch is ideally oriented in some way facing the fireplace and the Eames chair is near the front windows adjacent to the fireplace. Feels weird having the TV right next to the fireplace on the left and I think the TV would be too high if I put it on the fireplace mantle.

I think we are pretty sure that the dining table will go under the hanging light toward the back of the room near the arch, since that’s the entry to the kitchen.

Suggestions much appreciated!

1puu0p6,https://www.reddit.com/r/llivo/comments/1puu0p6/how_hosts_create_memorable_christmas_moments_for/,How Hosts Create Memorable Christmas Moments for Travelers,"Christmas stays are emotional by nature. Guests arrive carrying memories, traditions, and expectations shaped by family, faith, and personal history. When they book a holiday rental during this season, they are not just looking for **accommodation**—they are looking for **belonging**. This is why memorable Christmas hosting starts with understanding that *you’re not just renting a house on Christmas, it’s a whole vibe*. A truly meaningful stay feels intentional, warm, and human. The goal is to create a space where guests feel safe to slow down, reconnect, and create moments that feel personal rather than staged.

https://preview.redd.it/kwmzgrzj379g1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=295ed232e5f05d56e5ce9409bfb779d7f038244c

# Designing Spaces That Invite Connection

The most memorable Christmas rentals are designed for **togetherness**, not just aesthetics. Thoughtful hosts arrange their living areas to encourage conversation, shared time, and comfort. Instead of focusing only on décor, they think about how guests will *use* the space. Adding **board games, card games, or simple Christmas activities** instantly transforms the rental into a place where memories naturally form. A coffee table ready for games, seating that faces each other, and warm lighting that invites long conversations all contribute to a sense of connection. This approach aligns closely with the long-term **host advantages** outlined in[ **rental benefits for hosts**](https://www.llivo.com/p/rental-benefits), where emotional experiences translate into stronger reviews and repeat bookings.

# Turning a Stay into an Experience

Memorable Christmas hosting goes beyond the walls of the home. Guests increasingly value **experiences** that help them feel grounded and present during the holidays. Hosts who suggest simple outdoor activities—like quiet morning walks, scenic routes, or gentle winter bike rides—offer something far more valuable than decoration alone. Experiences like those highlighted in **vacation rentals with bike rides** allow guests to create traditions that feel refreshing and meaningful. These moments give travelers a story to tell, making the stay emotionally rich rather than forgettable.

# Redefining Luxury During the Holidays

Christmas luxury isn’t about excess—it’s about **comfort that feels effortless**. Guests notice when a home feels calm, well-prepared, and thoughtfully equipped for winter stays. Soft lighting, comfortable seating, quality bedding, and quiet spaces to relax matter far more than flashy decorations. Hosts who focus on **seasonal comfort** create an environment where guests feel genuinely cared for. Many of these ideas align naturally with[ **top luxury amenities**](https://www.llivo.com/p/top-luxury-amenities), where luxury is defined by ease, warmth, and emotional comfort rather than price tags.

# Making Guests Feel Expected, Not Just Welcomed

What guests remember most is the feeling that the host *thought about them*. A Christmas rental that feels expected—not generic—creates emotional trust. This can be as simple as a space prepared for shared meals, enough seating for gathering, or small details that show intention rather than automation. This philosophy reflects the heart of[ **the Story of Llivo**](https://www.llivo.com/p/story-of-llivo), where hosting is rooted in respect, warmth, and human connection. When guests sense that care, the stay becomes personal—and deeply memorable.

# Why Christmas Memories Bring Guests Back

Long after Christmas ends, guests won’t remember how many decorations were used. They’ll remember the laughter during a board game, the calm of a quiet morning, or the comfort of feeling at home when they were far from it. Hosts who focus on **creating moments instead of just managing stays** naturally stand out in a crowded market. These are the hosts who don’t just fill calendars—they build trust, loyalty, and lasting impressions. And that’s what truly makes Christmas hosting unforgettable.

# FAQs

**Do Christmas decorations really matter to guests?**  
They help set the mood, but **memorable moments and shared experiences** matter far more than décor.

**Are board games or activities worth adding?**  
Yes. Simple **games and shared activities** encourage connection and make holiday stays feel personal.

**Is luxury necessary for a great Christmas stay?**  
No. **Comfort, warmth, and thoughtful preparation** create a stronger impression than expensive upgrades.

**Why do Christmas guests remember certain rentals more?**  
Because they associate the space with **emotional comfort and meaningful moments**, not just the property itself.

We tend to get pretty rough lobbies, where most people will kill you on sight unless you kill them. One day we queued up for a buried city run, looking for event items. We spawned behind Grandioso Apartments and made a beeline for the first building. The goopin was good, we had full inventories including our target items within 5 minutes.

And then we heard them. Another duo in the building across from us, also gooping up. They didnt see us, so we were hanging out in the room under the bridge, lying in wait. They were wearing bungulator skins, and those players ALWAYS wanna throw hands, so we were being super careful considering our inventories.

We decided to try and play it friendly, in an attempt to get out clean. We called out ""hey are yall chill??"". No response. Movement stopped. ""Silence means violence fellas, are you friendly?"". A head peeks around a window, looking for us. ""We see you buddy, lets work this out."" They show themselves, and we finally hear a response ""yeah we can be friendly"".

It wasn't the most reassuring response, but hey! It was a response. We stayed guns drawn and hidden, they still couldn't see us. They ran across the bridge above us, and were actively looking around. From the floor below them, we started negotiation processes. This was right at the start of Flickering Flames, so everyone was looking for candle holders, coffee pots, etc... all things we had

We ended up convincing them we were chill, and we met up on our floor. Peace offerings were made, a coffee pot for a candle holder. Hands were shaken, a treaty had been formed! But as all raiders must, we parted ways with them. They stayed in the building, looking for more loot, while we left and made our way over to the Plaza Rosa train.

As soon as we left that building, like 10 steps out, we heard gunfire ablazin. It was coming from the apartment building... above us...

We looked at each other (in-game) and said ""OUR BOYS"". We immediately ran in yelling ""BOYS WHERE ARE YOUUU"" while flying up the zipline lookin for a fight. In the same room where The Treaty was signed, we found our Bungulators knocked down, calling out ""THEYRE GONNA FINISH US, HURRY"".

I was the first to make it in, and saw a raider mid-punch. I gave that rat an anvil to the forehead and dropped him immediately. The other rat scrambled and tried to run, so my duo chased him down yelling ""GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE BOY"", and hosed him down with a burletta. The Bungulators had been saved!!

We hit them with a defib, and made those rats squirm. Eventually we made one of them jump out the windows while we let a bungulator rock the last one. I've never heard such a thankful couple of gentlemen, they gave us a defib refund, and again we went on our way.

The spec sheet reads like a $350 door-buster: Ryzen 3 7320U, 8 GB soldered RAM, 128 GB SSD, Radeon graphics that amount to “yes, it has pixels.” Those parts work fine for homework, Zoom, and Spotify, yet every major retailer bundles them for under four hundred bucks.

Amazon’s own page for the identical 15-fc0099nr model hovers around $429; 996 orders on this listing suggests people smell value somewhere. Still, that extra digit in the price field smells more like a fat-fingered algorithm than a luxury tax.

Windows 11 S mode, the fenced garden where you can only install Microsoft-approved apps, ships turned on. Most buyers hop out for free in ten minutes, but it’s another reminder that the machine targets casual users who never met a .exe they couldn’t resist clicking.

HP sprinkles in modern niceties-LPDDR5 RAM, NVMe SSD, a physical webcam shutter, a Copilot key-so the laptop isn’t a fossil. Yet the HD panel flunks the basic 2024 screen test; even bargain Chromebooks ship 1080p as standard now.

If you need a disposable travel beater that won’t trigger tears when the airline seat mate spills coffee, this hardware makes sense-just not at the listed price. Wait for the inevitable markdown, or better yet, cross-shop the same model at Costco where return lines move faster than Ryzen 3 clocks.

1putsqp,https://i.redd.it/ff16j88q179g1.jpeg,"Feminine-Unisex Decant Reviews: Lattafa Musamam, Montale Intense Café, Goddess and more","Hi guys! (I used ChatGPT to refine this.)

I’m a newbie to fragrances and am slowly getting into the world of fragrance enthusiasts and fragheads. This is a small decant haul I ordered from an online seller I found called **Scentira**.  
This is **not sponsored** in any way, just my honest experience.

I genuinely had a great experience with them, so I thought of sharing my reviews here. The decants also came in pretty premium-ish packaging (the little gas-bottle style ones), which I really liked.

I ordered a bunch of fragrances based on viral hype + my own preferences, in no particular order. I’ll review each and then share my top picks at the end.

# Burberry Goddess - 5ml Decant

*(Scentira Silver Decant)*

OG Goddess smells like a very refined **vanilla + lavender** fragrance. There’s musk in there too, and overall it sits on the sweeter end of the fragrance wheel. Very well-balanced and elegant.

It opens with a slight alcoholic sharpness, but that settles within minutes into a really beautiful vanilla trail.

**Vibe:**  
Very sweet IT-girl vibes. She’s classy, refined, but still soft and sweet.

**Projection:** Moderate  
**Sillage:** Moderate  
**Longevity:** 2–3 hours at peak, then settles into a skin scent that lasts a bit longer

**Is it worth the price?**  
Goddess is a nice, unique vanilla to have if you have the money.  
Personally, I find it a little overpriced for such a simple composition. It’s skippable for me because there are really good dupes available at half the price.

# Lattafa Ana Abiyedh Rouge EDP - 10ml Decant

Picked this up because it’s known as a dupe of **Baccarat Rouge**.

It opens more citrusy and sweet. Honestly, it reminds me a lot of **ZARA Red Temptation** (the transparent one), which has been my personal signature scent for the longest time and has gotten me tons of compliments.

**Compared to ZARA Red Temptation:**  
Ana Abiyedh Rouge has a more citrusy opening, with musk and amber, and a slightly sweeter, more refined dry-down.

**Vibe:**  
Niche-leaning profile. Sexy, warm, classy, and sweet. Definitely a head-turner.

**Projection:** Moderate to low (settles close to the skin)  
**Sillage:** Moderate to low  
**Longevity:** 2–3 hours at peak, then settles down and lingers up to -4 hours on skin

**Worth the money?**  
For the price, it’s a beautiful scent and a good buy.  
That said, I still personally prefer **ZARA Red Temptation** over this.

# Montale - Intense Café EDP - 5ml Decant

Fell in love with this one. My first introduction to this scent profile was actually through its close dupe **ZARA Rose Gourmand** (though that one is sweeter).

This is such a unique and sexy rose fragrance - not your typical rosy scent at all. It leans gourmand, feels boozy, sweet, rich, and luxurious. There’s coffee in there too, but it’s subtle; the boozy edible rose really takes over.

Warm, slightly spicy, and honestly a must-have kind of scent.

**Vibe:**  
Very classy. Unique profile. Head-turner energy. Slightly unisex. Screams money to me. Major IT-girl vibes.

**Projection:** Strong, can easily fill a room  
**Sillage:** Great, leaves a beautiful trail  
**Longevity:** 4-5 hours minimum, possibly more depending on skin type

**Price value:**  
Totally worth it for the quality. A solid buy for a fragrance collection.

# Lattafa Angham EDP - 10ml Decant

Bought this mainly to compare it with **Burberry Goddess**.

This is a richer, slightly sweeter version of the Goddess DNA, but honestly, as a standalone fragrance, it beats OG Goddess for me. It has a subtle smoky vibe, which makes it feel very sexy — like a warm hug but still noticeable.

Very luxurious and rich. The dry-down sits beautifully on the skin and stays true to its notes throughout.

**Vibe:**  
Richer, very sweet, sexy IT-girl energy. Smells expensive.

**Projection:** Moderate to high  
**Sillage:** Moderate  
**Longevity:** Around 4 hours at peak, settling into skin for -5 hours depending on skin type

**Value for money:**  
An amazing vanilla fragrance if you’re into this profile. A very affordable (and honestly better) alternative to Burberry Goddess.

# Lattafa Khamrah EDP - 10ml Decant

Oh my god. I had never smelled anything like this before.

It opens very spicy -clove, cardamom, nutmeg, lots of cinnamon -and then settles into this insanely rich gourmand blend of dates and sweetness, with a base of amber woods and tonka bean.

I’d describe it as a stronger, spicier version of **Zadig & Voltaire -This Is Her** mixed with **ZARA Fields at Nightfall**.

The dry-down is sensual, warm, woody, and feels like the coziest rich hug ever.

**Vibe:**  
Deep, rich, powerful winter fragrance. Autumn/winter energy. Sensual, classy, unisex, and definitely a “money” scent.

**Projection:** The highest among all - literally filled the room  
**Sillage:** Great, leaves a gorgeous trail  
**Longevity:** Very long-lasting. Stays on clothes forever and lasts well on skin too.

**Value for money:**  
Niche-quality fragrance at a great price. Not everyone can handle it, but I need a bottle of this on my shelf. A must-have if you like bold gourmands.

# Lattafa Musamam White Intense EDP - 5ml Decant

My absolute favourite of the lot - and the one I was most excited about.

This opens very fresh and citrusy, then moves into a creamy coconut phase that gives peachy, marine vibes. Eventually, it settles into a warm woody base.

The dry-down is sensual and smooth, leaving behind a soft woody trail.

**Vibe:**  
Very sexy, all-season fragrance. Perfect for date nights or brunches. Fresh yet warm. Rich-girl energy.

**Projection:** Very high , super noticeable  
**Sillage:** Good, leaves a lovely trail  
**Longevity:** Moderate for me. Lasted 2–3 hours at peak, then another 1–2 hours as a skin scent (around 4–5 hours total). Might just be my skin though.

**Value for money:**  
At its price, it’s a great purchase. Loses a few points for longevity and feels lighter compared to the others , but I keep coming back to this one. A must-buy for its unique scent profile.

# Top Picks - Full Bottles I’d Buy 💖

• **Lattafa Musamam White Intense** \- love at first sniff (even if it doesn’t last the longest, I’m biased)  
• **Montale Intense Café & Lattafa Khamrah** \- both feel special and exciting to wear  
• **Lattafa Angham** \- will definitely be a staple vanilla in my collection

1putsmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanaimo_AltDiv_Coffee/comments/1putsmo/welcome_different_people/,Welcome DIFFERENT people!,"I have created an entire new group for this because my post in a more public Subreddit generated disrespectful comments that I was hoping would not happen.  I guess I was naive, but I am not giving up.

This will be a safe place for all to comment respectfully.  

So welcome!

As the title suggests, this is a small group intended to find like minded people to get together for coffee in NANAIMO.  I am a socially starved introvert who has decided it is time to take action to make friends and socialize in the manner that I like - chatting over coffee or in a similar setting.  Lunches or snacking are good too.

Who am I looking for?  Good question.  I feel that when people are seeking others for any kind of relationship they often place too much emphasis on their own personality in a perhaps misguided effort to focus on common ground.  But clearly some parameters need to be set.  So here goes:

This is a group targeted at those individuals who stand OUTSIDE the 85th percentile or at least like to step outside of it occasionally.  For people who haven't fit in anywhere else or who have had to wear a social mask to appear to others that they fit, while all the while feeling like an outsider or an imposter.  If you have ever felt frustrated with social scripts that don't make sense to you, or in some cases seem counterproductive to stated goals, this may be the place for you.

Adults of all ages and genders are welcome.

There will be few rules or boundaries for the topics of conversation in this group.  While I am somewhat of a moderate individual, I appreciate that this principle may possibly open the door to some rather extreme or edgier topics.  Nevertheless others not wishing to pursue the topic will be expected to decline respectfully and without judgement.

Obviously boundaries always exist, so I will say that some standard ones do need to apply:

1.  First and foremost, respect for others must be upheld.  This includes others that are not present and other people in general.

2.  Viewpoints should uphold and support the denial of the ability of anyone to act in furtherance of self determination in ways that do not harm others are

3.  Absoluteist viewpoints may not be welcome here unless they are compatible with #1 and take #2 into consideration.

I know there’s people who work over in Connecticut or NYC or even NJ like myself. I’m sure there’s also plenty of people who live in NYC but reverse commute to Regeneron in Tarrytown.

I’m starting to wish I had a bigger professional network. Yeah, I know plenty of people from work but I’ve never met half of them in person or find that I really connect with them.

It seems like the only option to network is to take a train into NYC on a weekday evening and then it’s just service providers pitching me their AI or law services.

I’m thinking of starting a very casual, low-lift meetup group strictly for scientists, engineers, clinical folks, founders, etc. Thinking post-work beers in Tarrytown or Saturday morning coffee.

No sales pitches. Just actual peers talking shop and connecting.

Is there any actual appetite for this? Would you show up?",5,1766600279.0,Westchester,5,0.78,False

Like, as if there is no differences has been left.

 People are either accepting someone else's opinion as theirs and making it their own personality or following the trend which has been set on the social media platforms.

So when I was active on Instagram like a few months ago I installed it for some reason, there i stumbled upon one reel. It's about "" i want a guy who's a nerd, chashmish, 6ft height, calm, bookie, coffee lover etc etc"" so I read the comments of that post 😭 and it's filled with i want a guy like that, manifesting a guy like this. I was like bruhh, u all found this post relatable and started manifesting a guy like this, it's just a post and u found it relatable and considered that u want a guy like that, as if you don't have your own standards and choices based on your own personality 🤷🏻

And there was another reel, when it's about ""I'm in my sad girl/boy era"" so that creater said that he/she's suffering from overthinking and overwhelming emotions, so he/started showing some books, aesthetic diaries and was making coffee. U can say that reel was less about mental health and more about overconsumerism. So, if you're overthinking then u need to have those aesthetic cups and diaries to keep it relatable and aesthetic. 😭 Some stupid and gullible people are following this, so now anxiety and stress is less about taking medication and break but more about how much money u can spend to make is aesthetic. Lmao 🤣😂

It's the same with that baddie trend too, like everyone wants a baddie now. Till now I've not gotten an appropriate definition of baddie till date😂.

So, now a days u don't have your own choices, personalities. It's being defined by others or any social media trends. You don't have anything to call your own. Your choices in choosing partner or friends is also being defined by a post on social media. 🤷🏻 You find it relatable and start considering it your own without thinking twice.

But basically my stress sleep score is consistently around 22-25 which is rated ""fair-poor"" I've only seen it excellent once, and it was sleeping outside in a tent in the spring at about 5C.

Anywho..the last 2 days I've had a flu/cold (fever, chills, sinus' blocked/congested, headache) my HRV tanked, sleep was terrible. I do all the things for good sleep hygiene, my workouts are earlier in the day, I don't eat late or heavy/rich meals, I'm off my phone or screens 2 hours before bed, I take magnesium, I drink herbal tea and have a relaxing bubble bath before bedtime, I read before bed and my room is kept cool, no caffeine aside from morning coffee.  Still the number doesn't change. Last night I ate relatively late.. turkey(I'm still sick) BUT my sleep stress suprisingly low for me at 19 (better than its been in a LONG time but I'm sick! and I ate late?)  Not one orange bar to be seen. Could it be the tryptophan? Curious what others experience is with eating turkey a couple hours before bed,",0,1766600242.0,Garmin,4,0.5,False

Hello! Hmmm I'm not creative enough to make a catchy intro rn, math drained my energy I swear. I'd love to talk to someone tho THE PERSON MUST BE my age so 18-21 sounds good I can do a year or two older but like it's weird sometimes 💔 cause y'all have work and shit while I'm just existing 😃. And around my timezone it's currently  8:15 pm this should help and if you see my post later then you can do the maths 😭.

I text in a bit of a funky way, someone literally knew me from the way I text.... scary.

Anyways things I like would be listening to music (epic the musical ONLY, I'm open to recs tho), I like watching anime, tv shows and movies although I haven't really watched anything lately (heartbreaking ik) and oh fun fact I used to do gymnastics and badminton, I have 19 medals from both of them ✊🏻 oh I also like tea and coffee a little bit too much so if you wyd I'm probably drinking coffee or tea or water 😭

Lastly I'd love to talk on discord after we get to know each other here. I don't do VC sorry so yeah don't ask. PLEASE GIVE ME A COOL INTRO AND NOT JUST HEY OR HELLO OR HRU BE UNIQUE BE CREATIVE BE FUNNY. don't be dry 💔🥀",1,1766600203.0,nofriends,1,1.0,False

1putnud,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnyxAdventCalendar/comments/1putnud/day_24_panama_hacienda_esmeralda_gesha/,Day 24- Panama Hacienda Esmeralda Gesha,"A fantastic end to this Advent Calendar.

I've had plenty of geshas before of varying qualities (though none very expensive), styles, and processing methods, but this is my first time with one from this (deservedly) famous farm.

I got a fantastic cup with a creamy mouth feel, subtle jasmine notes (I'd also say subtle orange or orange blossom, which might be their champagne mango note), and perfect balance.

The accompanying card says ""elegant,"" which I always think is a strange tasting note. It's not a flavor. And before having this coffee I would have said it doesn't help me understand what I'm going to get in the cup. Now I have to say I get it. The cup is subtle. Not loud, bold, and boisterous. In my opinion, the real beauty (and elegance) is in what's not present. No bitterness. No astringency. No over-acidity. It is simply balanced and truly pleasant. More like tea than traditional coffee for sure. Round, smooth, and gentle. Beautiful.

K-ultra 6.3 (I think you could go finer if you like; for reference 6.7 is usually my default starting point). For recipe I followed today's given recipe exactly. Note that it's different from the recommendations every other day (16g:250ml, 5 pours).",7,1766600104.0,OnyxAdventCalendar,18,0.9,False
