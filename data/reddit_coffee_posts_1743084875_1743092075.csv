1jl7ndd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ourconsciousness/comments/1jl7ndd/sartre_freedom_responsibility_and_that_rogue_bus/,"Sartre: Freedom, Responsibility, and That Rogue Bus","Picture this: I’m standing at a street corner, waiting for the bus to head to university. Suddenly, the bus careens out of control, slams into me, and sends me flying 50 feet. Both legs broken, concussion rocking my skull. Ouch. Now here’s the Sartre twist, am I responsible? I *chose* to be there. I could’ve walked the few miles to campus, slept in, grabbed coffee instead, or just stayed home pondering life. Infinite alternatives, but I picked that spot, that moment. Sartre’s “existence precedes essence” kicks in hard here: we’re free to choose, and that freedom means owning the fallout, even the wild stuff like a rogue bus.

It’s weird, right? Sartre wouldn’t say I *caused* the bus to crash, freedom doesn’t mean controlling everything. But he’d argue I’m responsible for putting myself in that chain of events. No excuses, no dodging behind “fate” or “bad luck.” It’s not about blame, it’s about facing the raw truth of my choices. That’s the weight of his radical freedom: every step I take (or don’t) shapes my reality. Makes you wonder how far that responsibility stretches in our conscious lives.

I made a post a few weeks ago showing my wacky blood sugars and got lots of support and advice from people here.

I got an appointment with a dietician and a  nurse from my clinic who said they would review all the info on my libre with food/insulin dosage/exercise etc for a few weeks and let me know what their thoughts were.

I wasn't expecting much but they called today and said: there's nothing more we can do from our end.

What a load of crap. How many years of medical school, decades of experience treating diabetes does a team of 25 people have?  I haven't been to medical school! But I'm still trying, I'm still fighting every single day and they have just written me off. I have done every diet, tried all the available insulins, more exercise, less exercise, changed my job, changed my sleeping patterns, reduced any/all stress and moved to a different city for this team. I don't smoke or drink or have more than one coffee a day.

In 2.5 years I have had no improvement in my blood sugars. I spend every minute of every hour of every day trying to manage this disease which is by the way, ONE of my EIGHT permanent physical diseases which i have to manage. And I'm seeing fuck all effort to investigate anything on their side! 

They completely dismissed my concerns about gastroperisis, although I have consistent symptoms, and two chronic illnesses that cause/go hand in hand with it.

Arrrrrgg! Sorry i just don't know where to go from here!

As I was standing there, the man who actually looked like a manager( he had on plain clothes)was mixing the beverages.
I first saw him aggressively wipe his nose with his bare hands...still while mixing the beverages. 
 I was a bit turned off by that but proceeded to wait.

I then saw him spit out a large amount of what looked like coffee and cream residue.
I did not know where he spat it out, because the partition was blocking his lower half.

I was mortified 🤢 because at first I thought he was spitting up or vomiting because why would his saliva be brown? But after my visit it dawned on me maybe he was taste testing the people's drinks? Is this common?
I'm not sure but all I know is as soon as they prepared my order I discreetly returned the food to the cashier, explained to her what I saw and requested a refund.

This is why I don't think it's wise to do pickup orders. I like to see how my food is being prepared.

I'm thinking if he's doing this in plain view what is he doing while preparing the pastries early in the morning before they are open?
Did I overreact?

1jl7jm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jl7jm4/the_man_i_am/,The Man I am,"Burner account. Long letter to myself. Maybe I'll share it. I don't know. I have to say it to someone though.

Everyday is the same. There are great moments, dull times, and a constant addiction to the next pick me up. A pick me up is something, anything, that makes me feel happy, positive, uplifted, or optimistic about the current moment. It’s not that I’m depressed about my current moment, but there’s a lot of I’m running away from. A typical day starts with a large cup of coffee. I feel better after coffee, it’s delicious, warm, and makes me feel uplifted, positive, and optimistic about the day. A great way to start the day. Sometimes I eat if I don’t feel guilty about how much shit I ate the night before.

On weekday mornings when I’m ""working"", I have about half my cup of coffee with my wife and daughter(s), change, heat up my cup, and head to the basement where my office is. Then I typically watch YouTube and/or read reddit for at least an hour. I start off with sports highlights, maybe a video recommendation that’s interesting, and then start mindlessly scrolling/watching videos that are just there to fill time. If I’m not working on something specific that’s occupying my mind, I use reddit and YouTube to fill my time.

Keep in mind that I’m technically “on the clock” for whatever contract I’m assigned to when dicking around in the morning. Not necessarily working on, but I am a body who’s assigned to the contract. I typically turn on my laptop and check if there’s any emails or messages I should look at. I always get a little worried when turning on my work laptop in fear there is a message from someone calling me out about doing absolutely nothing other than existing. 

After reddit and youtube I will typically go check on the plants. I like gardening. I like how plants grow. I love the simplicity of them. Plants are like Italian food, quality ingredients matched with simplicity. Soil, water, and sun. That’s the recipe for plants to grow and follow their instincts. It’s simple, people make it more complicated than it needs to be. Anyways, I’m fooling myself here. I don’t always check my plants. I go through phases of intensity and focus. I’m all in, wanting to start a youtube channel obsessed at times, and when I’m in this mode (maybe my happiest mode) I check the garden for new activity. Did the squirrels fuck with my corn again? Are there new weeds? Did something grow over night? I also check my cannabis grow tent. I’m sort of obsessed with weed. Not the weed culture (Cheech and Chong) or the typical tropes of giggles and being silly, but the feeling it gives me. It transports my mind and body. I feel alone, free to swim around my own mind and body. Anyways, when my family and I moved, I decided I should grow my own weed because that’s how much I like it and enjoy gardening. And it's not legal where we live. 

So, it’s probably around 10 or 11am now and I’m starting to lose my pick me up and my mind begins to wander what to do next. So, I go back to the internet and quickly exhaust reddit/YouTube. If I’m obsessed with a game, I’ll play it now or maybe an hour earlier than now. While I’m doing this, I move my mouse or hit my keyboard on my work laptop, so I don’t appear away. I’ve always felt as a remote worker being “present” is the most important thing. Work output doesn’t matter if your boss messages you and you don’t respond for hours. That’s how perception works. Also, it’s a language anyone can understand. Being absent or late doesn’t require a technical or college degree to understand, but shitty work might. Then eventually in big enough corporations’ existence is all that matters because there are no real deadlines.

At this point I might have a meeting that I don’t listen to at all. Typically, I find something on Youtube to watch while the meeting is happening or play a game. After the meeting ends, I either go back to Youtube/reddit, go outside for a couple minutes, or start scrolling porn. There are times when I don’t watch any porn (probably weeks) and then times when I watch it every day. Porn is a pick me up. I feel good watching it and somewhat “relieved” after. I’ve watched porn for a long time. I remember when I was a kid, I found my dad’s porn tapes and loved them. One day my dad said to me in a negative tone “Don’t watch porn. It’s grown adults who are paid to have sex with each other”. He never addressed me watching porn and as swiftly as he brought it up it was even swifter that we didn’t talk about it anymore. But I remember that idea, being paid to have sex. What a concept! As an older man I understand what he was saying now, but I still enjoy porn. There are times where I read about porn stars or watch interviews. I guess I’m interested in who they are outside of porn.

When my wife (then girlfriend) and I moved in with each other it was the first time I lived with a girlfriend. So, it didn’t take long (maybe a couple months) for her to find out I watch porn. I remember the moment vividly. I was on my computer downloading the latest porn I wanted to watch. My girlfriend comes into the office to chat. She comes and sits on my lap, as we’re talking, we’re looking at my computer screen. Then, a pop up in the system tray appears with a download complete message for the latest Brazzers video “Danny D fucks three girls” or some title that was so obviously porn. She stood up and was shocked. Not disgusted get away from me but taken back. We don’t argue, but I do apologize. I tell her how I honestly felt. “I watch porn because I think of you”. There IS a lot of truth in that. My wife is super-hot and makes me very horny, but I don’t always want to initiate or be intimate. Sometimes I just want to jerk off and go about my day.

There have been a lot of porn stars that I’ve watched over the years. I remember more names that I care to admit, but I realized I have a type. Brunette, curvy, not short or tall, and athletic. My wife is exactly that! I never thought of her having a porn star body, but she does fit my type. The thing with my porn viewing is it has NEVER distracted me from real intimacy. Most of the time I think it helps me. I never have erection or finishing issues with my wife. I love her so much and she’s so hot. Then with a sprinkle of a porn memory, I become more obsessed with her during the act.  The thing is when my wife found out about my porn addiction, I told her I would stop watching. She didn’t hold a gun to my head and told me to stop OR ELSE. She didn’t say she was disappointed in me either. Integrity has been a big part of my identity, and I told her I would stop, but I never really did (maybe for a month or two). I stopped downloading porn though and went to only streaming.

As the halfway mark of my day comes I’ve had coffee, masturbated, played video games, watched youtube, read reddit, moved my work mouse around, and checked my plants. I’ve literally don’t anything but pleasure myself. For my next act I’ll go workout for 20-30 minutes before my next meeting I won’t be paying attention to. Then I’ll get some lunch as it’s around 2pm now.

During this entire time, I’m thinking about my business I’m not working on or any life goal. I write a lot of ideas down about it but do nothing. I’ve probably watched a video about some random business topic like “The 5 reasons business owners fail” or “How to start a business” or some other video that won’t move any dial because I’m not DOING ANYTHING. I’m so fucking lazy. Actually, I’m not lazy. I’m just obsessed with not doing anything proactively that involves other people. I can do a million things by myself. The moment I must put myself out there in front of other people I get scared. With a business having to be a salesman scares the shit out of me. What the fuck am I selling? MY experience? Who made me an expert at fucking anything? I don’t even like my career field, but it’s come so natural to me. Part of it is I might be decent with people and that’s why my career has gone through its trajectory. I used to know technology somewhat well, but now I don’t give a shit at all. However, people still interest me a lot.

I think about my dad with his business. He started a moving and storage company with a close family friend. Their friendship ended through the company (never got the story) and my dad struggled A LOT. He was a great worker, terrible owner. Just like me! I can do “the work” but can’t do “the business”. His greatest success came when a family friend took over “the business” so my dad could focus on the customers, employees (who always took advantage of him), and “the work”. Unfortunately, the friend died of cancer after a year helping my dad. The business never got back to that peak and eventually went under. Its lack of success led my dad back to his former life in the airline industry. An industry he never wanted to go back to, but he made the most out of it.

There are many things about my dad I loved. His friends LOVED HIM. His family LOVED HIM (he had a very rocky relationship with his kids), but there was still love. He cared so much about the people around him. He wore his emotions on his sleeve and let people around him feel them (positive or negative). He seemed to enjoy the simple things. He never needed stuff. He loved to party with friends and talk. When he was in the last stage of his battle with cancer, I asked everyone to make a quick little video for him saying how much they loved him, to wish him well, etc. At nearly 71 years old I must have gotten 20-30 videos from mostly couples, that’s 40+ individuals. That’s incredible. I’m not sure I have close relationships with more people I can count on my two hands. That’s how many people loved him.  There were tears and laughter. What a flawed, wonderful man.

The business I started just exists, like me. I don’t do anything about it. No proactive sales, marketing, or outreach. I’ve gotten work through a friend though. Hundreds of thousands of dollars given to me by him. I don’t know why though. We aren’t even great friends. Most of our relationship has been spent on phone calls for the last 6 years. He believes in me though or has some other motivation I don’t know or understand. Even with all of this I don’t do anything. I paid someone to make a new website, that’s it. I’m so scared of this. I’m so scared of looking like a fool. It’s a muscle that I want to randomly read about but never lift a weight to strengthen it. Perception though is funny. I’m perceived as a business owner, but I just own a business that has made some money. 

What I don’t understand is that I do believe in my abilities. I truly believe there’s nothing I couldn’t be great at if I wanted. I think I’m good at figuring things out. I like to believe I’m open minded, but maybe I’m not. I’ve done modeling, acting, tennis, soccer, basketball, ping pong, gardening, content creation, guitary, an admired mixologist, father, husband (10 year marriage), engineer, and analyst. Nothing of these really pushed me out of my comfort zone. Even acting felt like just a time to pretend I’m someone else. That’s kind of fun; weed can make me feel this way. I should have been a salesman when I was younger. I almost sold cutco knives, but it smelled so much like a Ponzi scheme I couldn’t go through with it. I guess that’s why I like computers. They do what I say, they have all the tools to pleasure me (video games, content, and porn), and I never have to interact with folks. I really do like hanging out with people though.

As much as I believe I don’t care what others think of me, I do care. I HATE upsetting someone. I hate “being the boss” even though I’m now doing this as a father. I upset my kids all the time and I don’t feel bad about it. Maybe part of my problem is I don’t want to do to others that I wouldn’t want done to me. SALES! PUSHY SALES! Are all sales pushy? At some point they must be. I don’t want anyone to do anything they don’t want to do. If I’m pushy I’m probably upsetting them, but am I? I project too much of my own feelings on to others. My wife is great about helping me empathize. She often explains that everyone has their own language. Sometimes they align with me, but most of the time they’re unique. So why don’t I listen to the person who’s brought me more joy, happiness, and success than anyone in my entire life?  She BELIEVES in me. She stops and tells me she sees my hard work around the house and that she recognizes my work. What a woman! I truly get pornographic when I think about much, I love her.

She has encouraged me to do my own business for 10+ years. She will do ANYTHING I ask of her, and she’s already done so many things I wish I could do. Things I need to be able to do for this business to be successful. She flew to a conference in another state, without knowing anyone, and met people, socialized, and networked. What a champ. Last time I went to Vegas for a conference I gambled (lost thousands), smoked a lot of weed, hardly attended the conference, and ate a lot. I left my family, and spent our own money, to do that. That’s not someone with integrity, that’s a deadbeat.

I do this behavior all the time though. Typically, during the 1-5pm window on “work days” while she is upstairs dealing with our children I’m downstairs being a fucking deadbeat. Smoking weed, watch porn, playing video games, not working, not doing anything truly meaningful, and not doing anything with anyone else. I used to play only multiplayer video games. I had a huge online, friend gaming group. Now I know no one. I have no gaming friends. My real-life friends don’t really play games anymore. Even in my digital world I try to be alone. Free from obstacles or challenges. I typically stop playing a game if I find it too difficult. Why am I trying to improve in video games? I should improve my business! Or my tennis game! Or my garden! Before doing all that though let’s smoke and then not do all that. So, my wife is taking no time for herself while I’m swimming in an ocean of isolation. When I finally come up stairs, I’m typically still a little high. I go outside, play a little bit with my daughters, and then look for the next pick me up. It’s probably time to have a drink before or with dinner.

This part of the day can go by quickly and slowly. When weed wears off time is funny. Also, I’m starting to think about the next time I’ll get high and play video games. So, I’m kind of frigidity and have to be doing something. Usually, I’ll start cleaning up things around the house, helping prepare dinner, or doing something where I’m not really spending super quality time with my kids. This is 4-730pm every weeknight. The most I’m going to see my kids all day and, instead, I continue my selfish tendencies. If I take the girls outside, I’ll go into the garden while they run around. If I’m not in the garden, I’ll throw the ball for our dog while the girls play. I should be more interactive.

After they go to bed it’s time to really finish the day strong. That means a drink and a smoke. Usually, some whiskey and a really strong smoking session. I want to feel numb. I typically hide the fact I’m drinking from my wife. It makes no sense, she doesn’t care. I feel embarrassed how much I consume. She’s the person I truly want to impress. I feel so cozy in my body after drinking and smoking. Typically, I’ll play video games for an hour. Video games make me feel so good. Like I’m transported into another world where none of my problems exist. There is no business to grow, sales calls to make, and hidden behind the anonymity of the internet in case I upset someone. Then I go upstairs where I eat a bunch of sweets (if I haven’t already), watch tv, and go to bed.

So, this is the man I am today. Isolated, medicated, numb, feeling regret for time lost, but with no passion to change the future. I’m defined by my inner thoughts and not by my actions. I’m not a loser though. I own a home, beautiful kids and wife, loving animals, we travel, a history of financial success and stability (top 1%), athletic, attractive (my wife thinks I’m sexy), and a desire to be better. Desire only goes so far though. Apparently, my fear greatly outweighs my desire. My fear is stronger than all my other emotions because none of them have gotten me past this hump. I wrote this letter because I realize I need to evolve and mature. One of the most pivotal moments in my life is when my sister caught me living a lie. I lied to myself, then to her. She caught me though and instead of punishing me, she helped me. She got me through it and I vowed I would never lie like that to myself or the people I love again. That was 20 years ago and I’m doing exactly what I vowed not to do.

I’ve lied to my wife, kids, employers, friends, and myself. I’m tired of lying. I want to be a renaissance man, but first I want to be a man of truth and action. I don’t need to be caught in a lie to stop telling it. I don’t need to lose everything to fight for it. I don’t need another pick me up.",1,1743091720.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

• Cherry pick the advice you see here, in books, and elsewhere. Hit upon the right mix of tools that work for you. Like trying a few combinations on a safe door before it clunks open.

• Fast forward the tape. How will having a drink now affect me tomorrow morning? What's happened before? A slide back into what? It’s a good way to remind yourself to be kinder to yourself, and that you have the power to remove yourself from the torture.

• Don't 'white knuckle it' this time. Use other ways to deal with the pangs and they will become thoughts you can bat away, quicker and quicker each time. 

Find techniques like 'fast forward the tape' that work for you. I found 'urge surfing' really useful in my first two weeks. Delay, Distract, Decide is gold, too. Worth googling.

A change of environment works wonders. Go out for a drive or a walk or a coffee. Call a friend and get into talking about something else.

• Know that it only take 10 days or so for alcohol to leave your body. Then it's not alcohol you're addicted to - it's the thought of it. It's the misconceptions you have about it. There is some de-brainwashing to do.

• Be patient with yourself. I used to say, 'I want to get sober quick, like in a movie montage'! Hang on in there - while you've got to stay vigilant, it does get easier too.

Recognise that you want fast results. As drinkers, we're used to quick fixes. (I used to joke, ‘I downloaded the app, why do I still get pangs?!’) You'll look at the time gone by and wish you could leap forward to six months or a year and be done with it. Know that you will get there, even if you can't make the clock hands spin faster.

• Lots of people who drink go from using-to-feel-happy to using-to-feel-nothing. I believe that long-term recovery is all about finding peace in other ways. Could be as simple as starting or re-starting a hobby, trying guided meditation. Or even changing jobs or addresses. The old cliche is true: it’s a change of lifestyle not a life sentence.

• Books! A lot of people recommend This Naked Mind. However, I found a lot of brilliant practical advice in The 10 Day Alcohol Detox. Also, for  entertainment and empathy, The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober made me laugh and stay on track.

• Keep your webcam and microphone off if you want to at first, but attend an online meeting. Doesn't have to be AA. There are lots of different types out there. Try a few. This will let you connect with others who 'get it'. Such a relief. And a reassurance knowing you can experience something and go back and tell them, and get understanding.

'The opposite of addiction is connection' didn't make sense to me at first. It does now.

• Celebrate the wins. One day at a time - or even one hour at a time if you have to, at first. Count the days, the money saved (and use it to buy yourself treats), the calories if you like. Use an app on your phone. iamdonedrinking.com is good. iamsober.com also has communities of people at the same stage of recovery as you. One day... one week.. etc etc.

• Don't be afraid to protect yourself; your recovery. Walk away if you need to. Go into another room or leave the building if a situation is not right for you. Your circle of friends may change a little. You will know that, 'You lie with dogs, you get fleas'! 

For the first year or so, I didn’t go out much, while I was finding my way. Now I turn up to some parties if there are new/good people there, get interested in them, join in fun conversations, etc ...but when things get too lairy I go - my time's too precious to be bored by pissed people :-)

• Enjoy waking up without a hangover. Drive somewhere late at night. Explore doing stuff you couldn't before. As you heal, your attractions change too. Toxicity stops looking like excitement, peace stops looking like boredom.

• Your sleep gets better. You’ll gain more time in the day. These days I naturally wake and get up an hour before my alarm and read or do something else I want to before my workday begins - no hungover rush any more.

• Complexion gets better. My face was puffy - it isn’t now. It’s easier to concentrate and communicate. Work’s easier. Relationships so, so much better.

• Make a list of all the crap you had to put up with when you were a drinker. The hangovers, the zombie hours, blackouts? Sneakiness? All of it. Doesn’t apply any more. Keep a healthy memory of it (in other words, don't focus on regret but remember not to go back)

• Use the extra time you gain. 'If only there were more hours in the day' - now there are! Get into something that you enjoy and absorbs you. Could be something you abandoned a while back, something you've always wanted to get round to doing, or something completely new. A hobby, a pastime ...and don't feel guilty for spending time on yourself.

• Enjoy! Not having to drink any more feels so much better than any drink tastes. Enjoy your new life, remembering to glance over your shoulder occasionally so you don’t want to go back.

It's all about de-programming ourselves, I believe, and finding happier ways to live. 

It really does get easier, as your mindfulness and vigilance just become second nature, urges decrease, and you reap more and more benefits.

1jl7hdl,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeerotation/comments/1jl7hdl/first_order_thoughts_on_the_coffee_as_a_relative/,"First order, thoughts on the coffee as a relative newcomer to the specialty coffee hobby!","Was lucky to get an order in when the store was open to the public briefly a couple weeks back. I ordered the mystery 5-bag sampler, as well as the Wilton Benitez decaf from B&W. u/dirtydials was kind enough to throw in an extra decaf bag, along with an extra anaerobic natural from Silvio Roberto (Manhattan)! It's been an incredible way to get an education in varietals, process, and to become familiar with some hard-to-access roasters. Some thoughts on the coffees I've tried so far:

  
B&W Wilton Benitez thermal shock decaf - this might be the best coffee I've made since I got into this world a few months ago, and yet it's a decaf. Floral, with notes of citrus and stone fruit. The black tea came through as acidity - the type that feels slightly tannic and keeps you coming back for more

  
Subtext decaf - more of traditional washed profile, but very well balanced and super crushable

  
DAK Coco Bongo - thought I would hate this one, but once I dialed it in I was surprised to enjoy it quite a bit. The coconut note is a gentle making for a smooth drinking experience. The funk was manageable. I do like coconut a lot though.

  
DAK Big Apple - this one wasn't for me, but that's what is great about this project. I got to try it and not waste the money and beans. I guess I just don't love this type of apple flavor in coffee -- tasted like oxidized apple to me. I do have 20g of this left, so will try going even coarser, shortening ratio too. Maybe it will change my mind!

  
Morgon Gathaithi - nice light body with a good sweetness. Slight fruit notes of berry. Great morning cup!

  
B&W New School - apparently this is 80% washed Ethiopian, and 20% rotating co-ferments. Blending co-ferment seems to be a great way to emphasize fruit notes without being overbearing, while still maintaining a traditional base. Loved this one!

My pa (m18) broke up with me 2 months ago. He hid his porn use throughout most of our relationship and when I found out (a year into dating) it destroyed our relationship. We used to be so perfect before. He was addicted, used Instagram at one point and lusted over girls he knew in real life. It destroyed me and my confidence, I always thought I was enough for him and even out of his league and he still didn’t stop. I did a lot for him sexually, even after he would lie to me and lust over other women I would still always be very sexually active with him. 

He did admit that he would go through phases in our relationship before I found out where he would stop/try to stop. Towards the end it got a lot worse and he would use more frequently. After multiple D-Days and lying to my face, in the last few months of our relationship he attended SA meetings. I was proud and he was the youngest there and it made me more hopeful. He said he’d been 6 months clean at the end of our relationship, I don’t know if this was true but I chose to believe it. He broke up with me a couple months ago because he wasn’t happy with how we were and the conflict he had caused us. I begged him back but he didn’t care anymore. 

A month after the breakup and I think he’s talking to a new girl already. It honestly makes me feel ill how he can move on so fast after I stuck beside him through literally everything. I know she will be naive like I was at the beginning. He can come across as so genuine and sweet to people and he did with me at first. I’m scared he’s going to change for her and I was just a lesson for him. Or he’ll get better at hiding it and she will never find out. Either way they’ll both be happy. I just feel so used now and discarded. 

Also, a week after we broke up we did meet for coffee and he told me he recently relapsed (we weren’t dating anymore so it’s acceptable I guess) but this also means he’s more likely to fall back into old habits. He even admitted to me after the breakup that he used me for sex at the beginning of our relationship. I imagine he’s not doing meetings anymore either as he’s too busy with his new life. I see photos or videos of him now and it makes me so angry seeing how happy he looks. He’s also very active on Instagram now and has redownloaded it and even started posting. 

I want to also add that right after we broke up he said he deleted all the nude photos and videos he had of me. I don’t know if this is a sign he’s improving or if he was just being good morally. I will admit that it hurt my feelings a bit and in a way I still do want to feel sexually validated by him because at many stages I didn’t. ",4,1743091290.0,loveafterporn,5,1.0,False

## Why a Car Wash with Vacuum is Essential

Beyond just aesthetics,keeping your car clean offers several benefits.

Many locations offer tiered packages, allowing you to choose options with additional services like tire shine or undercarriage wash.

### Touchless Car Wash with Vacuum

Ideal for Detailing Enthusiasts: A *touchless car wash with vacuum* uses high-pressure water and detergents to clean your car without any physical contact. This is an excellent choice for those concerned about scratches or swirl marks on their paint.

Detailing enthusiasts often appreciate the care taken to avoid paint damage, as this can be a good start to a home detailing project.

This is frequently enough the most expensive option, but the results are typically worth the investment for those who prioritize a flawless finish.

### Car Detailing with Interior Vacuuming

Maximizing Cleanliness and Value: When a basic clean isn't enough, consider *car detailing with interior vacuuming*. Detailing services go beyond a simple wash and vacuum, offering comprehensive cleaning and restoration for both the interior and exterior of your vehicle. This often includes services like paint correction, waxing, upholstery cleaning, and leather conditioning. The interior vacuuming involved focuses on deep cleaning often forgotten areas such as vents, and under seats.

### Mobile Car Wash with Vacuum

Ultimate convenience Brought to You: In today's fast-paced world, convenience is key. A *mobile car wash with vacuum* brings the car wash to you, whether you're at home or at work. These services are fully equipped to wash and detail your car on-site, saving you time and effort. While potentially pricier, the convenience factor is undeniable, especially for busy individuals or those with limited mobility.

1jl7c5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jl7c5a/my_sky_sings_a_maddening_hymn/,My sky sings a maddening hymn,"Again. I hear it. It comes often yet visits infrequently. Inconsistency that teases me from peace in my home. An unsubstantial tick with no meaning aside from overbearing accumulation. From my ceiling they pleasure themselves, splattering to the kitchen tile. At least, until I bested them with a bucket. Their cruel master taunts me still. No longer could he reach my floors. Now, in what I assume is annoyance, he stains my ceiling with his legionaries before dismissal. Drop after drop after drop, a pace that is unreadable, making it all unbearable. I refuse to check the source. My mission stretches me too thin, the importance too great. The means needed for resolution I do not possess, and why stress myself in greeting my torturer.



Why is all I can wonder. Why the games. Why the punishment. I am a flawed man but to deserve this? Injustice is what it is. I am a man of noble cause. Despite what they’ll tell you, my actions are no sin. I act to better the whole. I am a saint among men, my purpose, to cure waste. Eating rotted food is a virtue. I am a savior for precious energy and life that others condemn so easily. It is the divine plan God chose for me. Nourishment all can enjoy and they’ll call it sin.



But here I am in desperation. Why curse me for my virtue,God? My suffering can’t be the fault of me alone. Have you grown angry with my resolutions? My unwillingness to the calls you let fall above me. The bucket resisting the mess of your weeps. I sense the frustration in what I assume is your blushed cheeks, growing on my ceiling. Please stop your tears from falling harder. I cannot understand. I cannot handle this punishment you’re giving me. I am one of your servants. 



I've stopped using my upstairs—no more bedroom, no more space. I refuse to acknowledge the drips. Out of sight, out of mind is what I wish. But their untimeliness rings in my ears. When it began, I brought my essentials to the living room. Pit or pile, I can't tell, of clothing by the couch. Marg, my cat, loved to be cradled at the center. Her imprint still lies there, creating a volcano. Coffee table is littered with stuff, things and waste: deodorant, stained disposables, lotion, remotes, coasters. My home has been raptured, empty of Marg and Mom and replaced with disaster. The endless and improbable rain of the kitchen, volcanoes, and landslides. He leaves me to suffer this ruin.



What they’ll call my sin, started with fruits. Bananas to be specific. They all ripen at off times, cultivating those deep mahogany to black “bruises”. I never understood why we all considered bananas to waste at this point. Yes, the color is off-putting and the texture is slimy, but I’ve learned to love them. I’d close my eyes and eat them as fast as possible at the start. After the first few it became enjoyable. My rush slowed and I savored the experience. The rot that took root in their flesh was of an indescribable sweetness. A precious caramel that only nature could nurture. 



My experimentation grew from here. Apples were a similar story. I found myself awaiting their rot, until they would tremble and squirm to my touch. Only then were they ripe. Berries became a favorite, the rot consumes them fastest. In one bite I experienced their sweet flesh mush to a heavenly juice. Every berry delivers ecstasy. Fruit succumbs to time in a beautiful way. Their sweet flavor becomes indescribable. Flies know this. They swarm and feast the rot with no discrepancy. I envy their passions. 



My relocation to the living room keeps me closer to the kitchen. Like flies I have started orbiting the rot, eagerly awaiting ripenings. From counter to fridge to counter, constantly checking. Hoping. I am not alone in eagerness, that which is lying upstairs has amplified calls for my visitation. I hear it in its sweaty beats of vitality. I see it in concentration.



Incidentally, I explored beyond rotting fruit. A line I was wary to cross. Packaged chicken breast sat deep in the fridge while groceries whittled down. When found, it was stewing in a creamy white slime, for what looked to be weeks. It begged for consumption. I couldn’t let an animal die in vain, slaughtered with no rhyme or reasoning. It was here I realized waste is a curse among us.



I accepted its pleas and was met with a terse aroma. A scent I had not yet known I was chasing with fruit appeared. Sour and full bodied, unlike its wispy counterpart. The flavor, hearty as the smell. I reveled in that experience. After that night, I knew my calling. That God needed me as a saint to purge waste. 



I started shopping for rot, there to be the saviour. Conveniently, stores marked it down with disgust. Oh, they are all so ignorant. His holiness aided me, he helped me save money and reach further in my deeds. With the savings, I could cure more waste. The fancy fish and beef made it all the more exciting. Fish became my staple for how fast it readied. I gauged meat based on that cream-based nectar accumulating in the package and fish never disappointed.



My body grew familial with rot. I stopped getting sick, which panned out well for me. My mother, disgusted with my habits, could not understand. When I was sick, things escalated. She called my bliss disgusting, among worse words and threatened me out the house. But I couldn’t stop, I promised God. I believe, for that, he immunized me to carry out his divinity. No longer getting sick, I started to eat raw, experiencing rot in a purer essence.



With my mother gone, my ambitions grew. I no longer found use in the fridge. Leaving it all on the counter meant ripening would come sooner. Next, I knew I was not doing enough to end the plague. I drove to local shops and rooted through their trash to please God. Daily walks in my freetime along busy roads scouring for waste. My answer was found in roadkill. It lies there, and he illuminates it in sunlight for my attention. The smell and taste, ethereal. I knew he was pleased with my efforts. That he would reward me graciously. 



Yet, he didn’t. Instead he punishes me with that presence. Demons of invariance that toil with mind. Their calls grow deafening by the moment. Yesterday, it was whimpering. This morning whispers, now words. I hear them. My efforts to ignore them, futile. It's a beg, a familiar one. The dripping is synchronizing, harmonizing. It departs from my harsh torment. In my willingness to now hear, I recognize. It is the same plea I first heard of rotting meat. God wasn’t cursing me. I was just too ignorant to feel his benevolence. He marks my house of rot in approval. I know I must visit those above and accept the offering.



I crawl up the steps in anxious excitement. Met with the hallway, the upstairs that had grown hazy in my mind clarified. Teeming from my mothers room is that haunting substance tracked with footprints in and out. A rust red with deep ruby overtone seeps into the crevices of the hardwood. Hordes of flies swarm the door in infatuation, together they omit a musk so dense it stagnates in the hallway. It is beyond comprehension yet warmingly familiar. It reminds me of the cream of rot, it feels of the same slime.



Ready to forgive my tormenter, I open the door. The floor is littered with bones, large and small, atop of that rosy slime. Some cracked open and others draped with chewed flesh. I pull myself deeper into the room, eyeing the bones, excited to cure their waste. At the center lies a hammer and two rotting corpses, one of woman and of cat. They resemble stomped out campfires, broken inward, missing essentials, collapsed, and then dispersed. Now, I recognize. God finally indicts me as his saint. For my hardships he has rewarded me a feast. I stoop to my hands and knees to apologize for my ignorance. Then taste the rot.

1jl775r,https://i.redd.it/8iovma5289re1.jpeg,"My review of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo"" (SPOILER)","I had been wanting to watch The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo for a very long time ; first because I love Fincher (Se7en is one of my favorite movies), second because I already read (or rather devoured) the Millennium trilogy by the late Stieg Larsson (TGWTDT is, let’s not forget, an adaptation of the novel of the same name). 

Well… 

I’m disappointed.

Imagine over 1,000 pages of investigation, introspection, analysis, and scheming. Now imagine a film adaptation of those 1,000 pages that barely lasts two hours. See where I’m going with this? 

This movie feels like a summary. Steven Zaillian (the screenwriter) bulldozed through the original plot. Everything is shortened, to the point where it gets a bit confusing (if I hadn’t read the book, I think I would have struggled to understand what was going on).

For example, take the scene where Henrik Vanger meets Mikael for the first time and explains all the ins and outs of the Harriet Vanger mystery. In the book, this scene spans dozens of pages. In the movie, it lasts no more than five minutes.

I was also a bit disappointed by Lisbeth, even though Rooney Mara’s performance is remarkable. In the novel, she is arguably the most complex and unique female character I’ve ever encountered. In the film, she’s nothing but a reserved goth who knows how to hack computers. This is probably because the book places a huge emphasis on her thoughts, which is hard to replicate in a two-hour movie.

I’d also like to point out two performances that I found off the mark. First, Stellan Skarsgård (who plays Martin Vanger). You can tell he’s a psychopath from his very first appearance in the film (and no, this has nothing to do with me having read the book). His coldness, his gaze… you raise an eyebrow at him right away. In the book, Martin is infinitely more warm and charming. At no point do you suspect him of even killing a fly—until Mikael unmasks him, and then he reveals his true nature.

Second, Daniel Craig (who plays Mikael Blomkvist). I found him too cold, too robotic (too James Bond). The Mikael in the book is far more human—passionate about his work (or should I say obsessed), about women, about simple things like a cup of coffee… None of that is well represented in the film.

And Millennium?! One of the best aspects of the book is the slow rise of this small newspaper, held together by a handful of passionate people. In the film, this aspect is completely botched. Barely a few minutes are dedicated to it, and I would have preferred if they hadn’t bothered at all. The staff is large (which is odd, considering the paper is supposed to be on the verge of collapse), dull, cold (they celebrate their revenge on Wennerström with crossed arms and austere expressions)… In one word : depressing.

All that said, the film does have its strengths, particularly Cronenweth’s cinematography and Reznor’s score, which effectively highlight Hedestad’s cold and eerie atmosphere.

Is it a bad movie? No. Is it a masterpiece? Definitely not, especially after reading the excellent novel by the late Stieg Larsson.",0,1743090861.0,moviecritic,0,0.5,False

Like I said our path to getting to this point in our relationship has been rocky, I got her a gift a few months ago to which she asked for my number and asked if I’d want to meet up for coffee. I said yes, waited for her to make coffee plans but she never did so I reached out and asked if she was planning on it. She basically told me she was too busy but said she’d touch base the following week and never did.

We ran into each other after that and it was awkward and she texted me a few hours later explaining that she’s too busy to meet up with me outside of school and I just left her alone after that. Then we reconnected a few weeks later. Now fast forward to current times, she asked me like a week ago to work on a project outside of school with her and I agreed. We had a long conversation about a plethora of things, dating, her wishing she’s a lesbian, her asking for my help to run a sm page and offering me dinner in return because I refused to let her pay me. I agreed to dinner and then we saw each other on Monday and she asked if I was free this week for dinner and I said yes. She still hasn’t reached out about dinner plans.

For millions of years, plants have managed to resist and defend themselves from a continuous onslaught of life-threatening events. What Kevin Tarner and Rachel Hughes reveal here are the creative and constantly changing methods plants call on to survive in the face of a world that often doesn’t want them to. Despite the daunting pressures of being eaten by other species and competing among themselves for water, sunlight, and pollinators, plants manage to survive by calling on a deep well of ingenious strategies.  
  
Unsurprisingly, these tactics have not only affected the success of plants, but humans have also been impacted by them in our own passage through time. We have coexisted with and even co-opted plant defense, resulting in tremendous benefits for our species. Indeed, these adaptations are so intimately parallel to our daily lives that we often bump into them unwittingly.

I was wondering if anyone here drinks ZipFizz. It's this weird powdered energy drink that also has vitamins and electrolytes.

POTS would seemingly explain why this drink is far more effective than coffee or canned energy drinks.

I found it at Sam's as a teenager, they handed me a demo water bottle with the powder mixed in, and I've been drinking it religiously since. Whenever I'm out, I feel like a zombie (regardless of caffeine intake from other sources).

Wanted to bring it up because I am the only one I know who drinks it. Maybe get some other recommendations, and/or let someone else like me know of its existance?

Hope everyone has a wonderful ""Good Day"" :D",1,1743090430.0,POTS,1,1.0,False
1jl712f,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1jl712f/diagnosed_pots_and_vasovagal_syncope_through/,"Diagnosed POTS and Vasovagal Syncope through Kaiser, California","TLDR: finally diagnosed after 9 months and I wanted to give some details for those looking for diagnostic encouragement and/or dealing with Kaiser.  *I didn't think I would be diagnosed honestly because my symptoms are highly varied, and seem to be worse or better at random. 
  

I've only been in this process about 9 months.  Random coinciding events that were neurological are what started it. And after finding some neuro issues and ruling out ALS and MS (which is why they pushed me through fast), they finally sent me to the cardiologist.  
  
FWIW, I didn't like the cardiologist. He was hyper focused on gabapentin being a driver for my symptoms.  So I weaned off the gabapentin -which is something I wanted to do anyways for a while. I don't want to be on any medication if I don't have to. The side effects are such a drain to try to follow and decide if it helps more than hinders.  
  
So I went from 300mg at night down to nothing over the course of 2 months. No withdrawals. And somehow, my pots symptoms improved slightly.  But they didn't go away.  
  
So I bugged my cardiologist and he agreed to send me to a tilt table test. They apparently are booked out like 6 months.   I called every week to see if they had cancellations and got one. 7am in Los Angeles. 💀. I lived almost 3 hours away. 
  
My husband is THE BEST and took the day off work and we headed down. 
  
*IMPORTANT FOR DIAGNOSIS*: they went over my meds and told me I could keep taking fluoxetine, Acyclovir, and my allergy meds (this is all I take). I was asked to stop all vitamins and supplements. And I was already off the gabapentin for 2 weeks. Also, NPO (nothing by mouth) from 10pm the night before. 
  
Needless to say, my throat was a desert. And being dehydrated and low blood sugar (60) made me feel gross. I JUST WANTED WATER AND COFFEE!  
  
I had the procedure at Kaiser Sunset in LA. In the Cath Lab. Let me tell you-that was the ABSOLUTE NICEST staff I've ever ever met. They were so caring. And I've had so many doctors and procedures. They treated me the same as the elderly lady next to me getting a heart shunt.   
   
Took20 minutes to find a vein to support an IV,
Because i was so dehydrated (indicator number one, nobody should be that dehydrated after only 8 hours of not drinking water.)   
  
Every nurse and doctor explained how it would work to me, waited for my questions, allowed my husband to sit with me the whole time. Then the nurse practitioner and doctor in charge came to ask me questions about my history. Which they thoroughly knew, which told me they went through my chart carefully, and cared. 
  
This is the fun part: they agreed with my cardio that I had VVS based on symptoms. But my poor man's in-office orthostatic test said POTS. But they were confident the TTT would give me answers. And they promised that false negatives happen a lot, because the hospital is a stressful place to be, and the promised I would walk out with a diagnosis.  
  
TTT went for only 20 minutes. They said I had 41bpm increase right after rising. I don't know the numbers yet. Full results aren't released. They said I didn't need to sustain it because I was symptomatic. Also h because of the VVS. 
  
So, blood pressure is supposed to stay about the same. And mine did for a few seconds. At least for the first reading. After that my heart rate went to normal and my blood pressure increased, and then everything tanked all at once, and then my heart rate went back up on its own back to 40 beats plus. My hands turn blotchy and purple, and I was nauseous. But I still didn't feel like I was going to pass out. Which surprised me. They said that was the VVS kicking in, making my heart rate and blood pressure jump around instead of sustaining. And that's why it made pots difficult to diagnose. Because they work differently. 
  
I don't know if I'm explaining this well, and I don't have any numbers to back it up right now. I'll gladly share my results when I go over them with my cardiologist soon.  
  
I walked out of the office with a diagnosis of both POTS and VVS. The nurse practitioner said congratulations. Because she knows what it's like to go through this. She's actually surprised I got a diagnosis so quick, citing that most of her patients have to try for years, and are usually diagnosed with anxiety first. I told her that I know how the health care system works, and I've already gone through my treatment for anxiety. I've done the prescribed counseling, which actually really helped and I loved and I've stayed on my meds. I've also reduced my dose of fluoxetine (see above) to it's minimum amount, because CBT has helped and new healthy coping mechanisms that were only able to be taught to me through a counselor. And I've had no relapses or ever gone to ER or urgent care with panic attacks.  
  
I hope this helps somebody. I have a long road ahead of me. Because now it's the game of figuring out what helps. My husband is going crazy buying all the things that we were told to do. He's so anxious for me to feel well. To get the heartbeat of our home steady and back to normal. Me too husband, me too. ",0,1743090430.0,POTS,0,0.5,False

I was at my lw in August of 2022, and I fully remember it as something effortless, and not even as my lw, because I've normalized that that's just ""the size I'm supposed to be"". 

Every few years, my family goes on this trip to Florida. I know it's always triggering, but this year, I weigh more than I have in a very long time, and I'm trying to lose it all in time for the trip. In my mind, this is the first ever time I've done this. Only now, as I sit in guilt and obsession, worrying about whether or not I'll be able to enjoy and not obsess over food on the trip, do I remember every single trip needing to start with a pep talk, about how I know we've been working on overtime to be in control but we absolutely cannot be in control if we wanna have a good time. In my mind, the last trip in 2022 was the first time in a long time that my eating and weight were effortless. But I also suddenly remember an obsession with iced coffee (despite literally having a sensitivity to coffee. It makes me sick LMAO) and MANY of these little pep talks to get myself through the trip. 

What the FUCK man. Why do our brains do this to us??? They make us think it'll be so easy, as it always has been. That ""all we gotta do"" is XYZ and then it'll be ""EFFORTLESS""?? Fuck, i hate it here. And even with this memory, i still think it's the ideal way to live and that it truly can be effortless if I can just get myself back there. Is there no such thing as mindful eating without obsessive fuckery?? I hate my life when I'm obsessing over food in the ""it has to be perfect and mm so good I need to make sure I maximize my pleasure and get enough of it"", but apparently the only other state of being for me is obsessing in the opposite fucking direction.",1,1743090391.0,EDAnonymous,0,1.0,False

I'm starting to lose it with these updates y'all, so thank you to all the members of the sub sharing their news. It's literally just me managing this sub and writing these so I genuinely could not keep track of this without you guys. <3. 

With that in mind, I'm going to format this one just a bit differently to make these a bit more concise or else I'll be publishing a god dang novel. 

Alright let's get down to business. 

# 💥 DEI Rollbacks Continue

# Kirkland 

* **Pulled the plug on their Chicago diversity summit.** 
* Their diversity scholarship and conference pages appear to have been scrubbed from their site entirely.

# Latham 

* **Canceled its SF diversity summit** (rebranded “Student Pathways Academy”). 
* It’s reportedly moving to a virtual format, however, one student checked the firm’s website and didn’t see a diversity section listed anymore, though unclear if one was there before. 

# King and Spalding

* Quietly, ***every*** **diversity page on King & Spalding’s site now redirects to a 404 error.** 
* No public announcement. 
* Looks like their diversity programs have been shut down too.

# 📉 Rejection Waves

# Simpson 

* Confirmed **rejection wave from Simpson happened Tuesday** — one student said the email was only a few sentences and didn’t mention anything about 2L applications. 
* Firm reportedly told another applicant that final **1L offers are expected by mid-April.**

# 🧃 Movement on Screeners + Callbacks

* **Sidley** screener Tuesday → callback invite *Wednesday.* Lightning fast.
* **Foley Hoag** 2L callback confirmed for one student via prior pre-law connection.
* **Goodwin DC:** Screener 3/19 for one student → now scheduling callback (with option for Zoom).
* **Goodwin Boston:** Callbacks happening this week.
* **Proskauer Boston:** 2L callback invite *after* screener for 1L position.
* **McDermott NY:** 3/25 interview invite for one student sounds like more than just a standard screener — 1 hr with multiple interviewers.
* **McDermott** screeners going out.
* **K&L Gates Boston:** Screener invite for one student sent out on 3/25.
* **Seward & Kissel NY:** Screeners happening as of last week.
* **DLA:** Callbacks going out - confirmed wave as of last week.
* **Ropes & Gray:** “Office tour and coffee chat” invite with one associate from a 1L callback was actually labeled an “interview.” May be a kind of second-wave evaluation.
* **Clifford Chance:** student with a STEM background already received 2L offer.
   * Callback and offer came on the same day. 
   * One-week deadline to accept, extended once for one week.
   * No details yet on additional extensions.
* **Wilson Sonsini:** Opened early for 2Ls. 
   * Offers already going out. 
      * Reminder: they hire into *practice groups*, not just general groups. 

# 📋 Applications & Open Dates

* **Gibson Dunn:** 
   * Online applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis, beginning in April. 
   * Students should apply only to their first-choice Gibson Dunn office. The firm does not allow interviews with multiple offices. 
   * Students are welcome to apply before their second semester grades are released. But they plan to extend the majority of our offers after the full first-year grades are available. 
   * Students are encouraged to disclose whether they hold Summer 2026 offers from other firms. If a student has a deadline that will prevent them from interviewing, the firm suggests they request additional time to reasonably consider their employment options. 
      * That said, they also say ""If that request is denied, we recommend the student seek guidance from their school’s Career Services Office."" Not sure how helpful they will be, but that's their advice. 
   * Gibson Dunn offers will remain open for 14 days from the date the student’s offer is extended, unless otherwise noted.
   * Full FAQ from Gibson here: [link](https://www.gibsondunn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Summer-Program-FAQ-3.21.2025.pdf)
* **Latham:** Will *not* make offers without second semester grades. Confirmed via email. See screenshot.

* **Debevoise:** Rejections reportedly going out within *hours* of applying.
* **Dechert:** Applications open April 15.
* **Arnold & Porter:** Opening April 14.
* **White & Case:** Opening May 1 (per recruiter at a diversity event).
* **O'Melveny:** Resume collection kicking off end of month. 
   * Mock interviews underway, requiring pre-screen info, which makes me believe that these mock interviews are essentially a pre-screener filter.
* **Holland & Knight Fort Lauderdale:** Reportedly **already** full for their 2L summer class, based on an email to a student.

# 🧠 OCI Bonus Tip:

* OCI creep is real — Stanford, for instance, moved theirs up from June 18–24 → now May 5–9. 
* What does this mean? **Don’t wait on OCI alone** — pre-OCI direct apps matter more than ever. Your school OCI might be late even compared to other schools' OCIs, meaning waiting will put you  behind basically everyone else if they happen to have a late OCI, and that means many, if not most or all, jobs will be filled. 

# That’s all for now!

Thank you to everyone sharing updates—if you hear anything new about **deadlines, firm decisions, or interview waves**, DM me! I’ll keep compiling and posting as new info rolls in.

# Good luck!

P.S. If you want a **tracker** with **pre-OCI openings, deadlines, and application links** for the **V100 & AmLaw 200**, DM me—I’m happy to share so you don’t have to check 50 different firm websites every day. 🚀",2,1743090349.0,BigLawRecruiting,0,1.0,False

# Introduction

Self-publishing has transformed the literary landscape, with Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) leading the charge. But savvy authors know that relying solely on one platform can limit both reach and revenue potential. As the publishing world evolves, exploring alternatives to KDP has become essential for authors serious about building a sustainable career.

Why look beyond Amazon? Despite its massive marketplace, KDP comes with drawbacks: increasing competition makes visibility difficult, royalty structures can change without notice, marketing options remain limited, and depending entirely on one retailer creates unnecessary risk for your author business.

The strategic author understands that diversification is key. By distributing your books across multiple platforms, you can connect with different reader communities, optimize earnings through various royalty models, and maintain greater control over your publishing journey.

This comprehensive guide explores 11 powerful alternatives to KDP that deserve your consideration. Whether you're seeking broader distribution, higher royalties, or specialized services for your particular type of book, these platforms offer compelling options that might better serve your publishing goals.

# 1. IngramSpark: A Comprehensive Self-Publishing Platform

**What Makes IngramSpark Stand Out**

IngramSpark represents the gold standard for wide distribution in self-publishing. As part of Ingram Content Group—the world's largest book distributor—this platform connects authors to an extensive global network of retailers, libraries, and online stores.

When you publish through IngramSpark, your books become available to over 40,000 retailers and libraries worldwide. This includes major bookstore chains, independent shops, and online platforms beyond the Amazon ecosystem.

**Features for First-Time Authors**

# 8. Barnes & Noble Press: Access to Loyal Readers

**What Makes B&N Press Valuable**

Barnes & Noble Press (formerly NOOK Press) connects authors with B&N's established reader base. As America's largest bookstore chain, Barnes & Noble offers both digital distribution through its NOOK app and potential opportunities for physical placement in stores.

# How to Choose the Right Self-Publishing Platform

Selecting the right platform depends on your specific goals, budget, and book type. Consider these factors:

**1. Your Budget**

If you're publishing on a tight budget, start with no-cost platforms like Draft2Digital, Kobo Writing Life, or Google Play Books. These platforms take a percentage of sales rather than charging upfront fees.

For those with more resources, investing in IngramSpark or BookBaby can provide professional services and wider distribution.

**2. Your Target Audience**

Think about where your readers shop for books:

* If they're primarily Apple users, prioritize Apple Books
* For reaching bookstores and libraries, choose IngramSpark
* If your audience is international, consider Kobo Writing Life and PublishDrive

**3. Your Book Type**

Different platforms excel with different types of books:

* For image-heavy books, choose Blurb or Lulu
* For standard novels, any platform works, but Draft2Digital offers the easiest process
* For textbooks or professional books, IngramSpark provides the best printing options

**4. Your Long-Term Goals**

Consider what matters most to you:

* Maximum royalties? Look at PublishDrive's flat-fee model
* Widest distribution? Combine IngramSpark for print with Draft2Digital for e-books
* Building a direct relationship with readers? Lulu's direct sales options might be best

**5. Experimentation Strategy**

Many successful authors use multiple platforms strategically:

* Use IngramSpark for print distribution to bookstores
* Publish directly to major e-book retailers like Apple Books and Kobo
* Use Draft2Digital to reach smaller e-book markets
* Test exclusive periods on different platforms to compare results

# Conclusion

The self-publishing landscape offers more choices than ever before. While KDP remains a powerful option, these 11 alternatives provide compelling reasons to diversify your publishing strategy.

By spreading your books across multiple platforms, you can:

* Reach readers who never shop on Amazon
* Maximize your royalty earnings through strategic pricing
* Gain access to different promotional opportunities
* Reduce dependency on any single retailer's policies
* Find the perfect fit for your specific book type and goals

The most successful independent authors today rarely limit themselves to a single platform. Instead, they strategically choose the right combination of services to maximize their reach, income, and creative control.

Whether you're publishing your first book or your fiftieth, these alternatives to KDP offer valuable options for growing your author business and connecting with more readers worldwide. Take time to explore each platform, consider your specific needs, and develop a publishing strategy that works for your unique goals.

Meals: I focus my meals around meat, chicken or fish and low carb sides such as green beans, broccoli, cauliflower etc.

Fruits: We want to try to stick with fruits that are low carb such as most berries like blueberries, strawberries, blackberries etc.

Fasting: Fasting can be a huge help to the healing process. I myself prefer to work in 24 hour fasts periodically about once a week. This helps my body get a restart and get going again. I also feel like intermittent fasting could be beneficial to some. I usually eat in an 8 hour window and fast for the other 16 hours of the day.",1,1743090158.0,DiabeticSnackExchange,0,1.0,False

I am in absolutely ZERO regard political, and it is not the point of this post. I support neither side and have never participated in an election. This is a simple interaction I had on my transit to work this morning.
 
On my drive to work, I stopped by a Starbucks which I don't normally do but I left my homemade coffee on the counter. At the most inopportune time, I wasn't able to access the drive thru as the line had snake tailed into the street. I saw a number of parking spots available and figured I would be quick. I wasn't rationally thinking because even the inside was packed, but the caffeine addiction I guess prevailed in my mind.

I stood in line self conscious as usual. I hate being in public period. Got my coffee went on my way. I opened my car door and unfortunately the wind got it good. It flung open but I managed to thwart the brunt of the wind. The slightest tap hit the truck next to me. It was two white men inside, and I remember reading the name of a landscaping company on the side of the trucks door. They were both grimacing real hard afterwards and I was frozen.

The conversation started off 

""What the fucks wrong with you man?"" 

I inspected the trucks door, saw no visible damage or dent. Apologized gracefully, and suggested they investigate the door for damage. They were at least honest about it and said it looked fine, but began to berate me and telling me to stay there and not get in my vehicle. 

It was tons of words from both men at once but the two that stuck with me as they hold the most weight in my mind.

""Ozturk, ICE got her. It's starting bud. They'll be knocking on your door"" They even spelled her name and told me to look it up, kept repeating that I should be scared. This got to me as an ethnic myself. I hate racism towards anyone and this deep down infuriated me.

I had no idea what they meant at first but I read the story minutes before this post and saw that she was someone who was detained by ICE. She was a student from Turkey and got detained recently. 

Last thing I heard was something like ""Creepy Pakistani midget fuck in the US. Can't even tell the difference. Not much longer"" after that they left. Stuck with me because one ""midget"", and two ""Pakistani"" which I don't even have a shred of in my genome. 

I was traumatized and I am at the point now where I no longer want to live this way. I don't think I can go on living with these interactions. Even in LA where I wouldn't expect a MAGA supporter, I found these rude people. And it has happened too much. I have had too many horrible interactions like this. 

So instead of living in Los Angeles, I have made the decision to move somewhere else in the US that is desolate where I can work from home. Given my education, I can luckily do that. Even if people had some suggestions on what may be a good place. It would be greatly appreciated.

I was thinking Maine, New Mexico, Alaska, West Virginia... No idea. It's all spit balling right now until I find something concrete. I don't know really anything about the US and how it is in different parts. I only came to LA is this job is really good for me financially, but I'll take a pay cut at this point if it means living in peace and comfort.

Thank you for reading.

I'm not worried, really. The body seems to remember what to do as far as getting through the day. I even remembered that the others plans to cook dinner tonight. I can't get to any headmate-specific memories about what's going on back there, but I have the relevant things available. And if I didn't, our fronting crew is pretty meticulous about note-taking.

Yesterday I went to the DIVA interview and got my results. Soon I will also have a psychiatric appointment but I am so nervous about a diagnosis I thought it wouldn’t hurt to ask opinions of people here. 

In short, I got 9/9 on an inattentive section both in childhood and adulthood. On hyperactive/impulsivity section I got 4/9 in adulthood and 0/9 in childhood due to strict upbringing, a lot of shame and being a woman. I couldn’t afford to be hyperactive, so I was inattentive to compensate for it. The therapist I did the test with ticked the boxes for “evidence of impairment in more than 2 areas” both in childhood and adulthood. 
I also did a QB-test and posted my thoughts on it in a previous post of mine here but I was considered “average for woman in your age group”. Important to mention that the results of QB-test were probably rigged by me because of drinking too much coffee before the test :// 

What do you think the chances are I get diagnosed? I worry that I won’t fill the criteria and will get told that I have anxiety and/or depression, which is not the case. Or I will get just straight up told that everything is fine with me. 

I am afraid that if I’ll get dismissed I won’t find the motivation to seek a second opinion. Next year I’ll be moving countries and start university, I just don’t know how I’ll do it when I barely graduated. 

Did any of you get diagnosed only with sufficient inattentive symptoms that affected your life? Maybe some word of advice on a psychiatric appointment?

I’m a half introvert and am looking to meet like-minded people for fun, regular meetups. I’ve tried apps like Bumble for friends, but didn’t find many people who fit my vibe (in terms of age, language, and interests). 
So, I’m now taking applications to create a group of friends and do some activities together.


About me:
	•	38-year-old European

	•	Father of two (ages 3 and 4)

	•	Enjoy both outdoor and indoor activities, whether calm or busy

	•	Passionate about sports, food, cars, and watches


Who I’m looking for:
	•	Ideally, around my age (28-48)

	•	Similar lifestyle: making an good salary  (so weekly activities aren’t a strain on your budget)

	•	From European descent or the Middle East

	•	Speak a decent level of English

	•	Interested in regular socializing

	•	Bonus points if you have children aged 3-6, as we could potentially do some family activities together. And who knows, maybe our wives will get along too!


What we could do together:
	•	Board games at a coffee shop

	•	Indoor activities: climbing, paddle, shooting range, book club, food outings, bowling

	•	Outdoor activities: golf, dog walking, jet skiing, stand-up paddleboarding



Meetups:

I imagine us meeting once a week for some fun activity, building a close-knit group of friends with similar interests and backgrounds.


Important note:

While it doesn’t bother me if you drink privately, all activities we do together will be alcohol-free.

A quick note on my approach:

While I understand my message might seem like I’m closed-minded or not open to everyone, I would argue that since I’m looking for friends for myself, I’m entitled to choose the pool of people I want to befriend. Everyone has their preferences, and I believe it’s important to find the right fit for meaningful friendships.


If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, feel free to reach out! Let’s create a fun, consistent group to share good times together.

This⁣ complete guide delves into the world of in-line water filters, specifically tailored for commercial use. ⁢Whether⁣ you're a restaurant owner, ​facility manager, or industrial engineer, we’ll equip you with the knowledge to select the best commercial ​water filter for your needs in 2025. We'll explore various types, key considerations, and ⁣top ⁢recommendations, ensuring⁢ you ‌provide clean, ⁣safe, and great-tasting water for your⁢ business.

## Why Invest in a Commercial In-Line Water Filter?

Before diving into specific products, let's address the essential question: why invest in an in line water​ filter for commercial use?

   **Enhanced Water Quality:** This ⁣is the most obvious benefit. Commercial water sources, whether municipal or well‌ water,‌ can contain contaminants like sediment, chlorine, chloramine, lead, bacteria, and viruses. ‍An in line water filter system removes these impurities, improving the taste, odor, and overall quality of the water.

   **Protection of ⁢Equipment:** Impurities in water ​can wreak havoc on expensive commercial equipment. Sediment can clog pipes and damage appliances, while chlorine can corrode metal ⁢components. Installing a water filter​ for your office ice maker, coffee machines, and other water-using equipment extends their lifespan and reduces maintainance⁢ costs. ⁢This can prevent costly⁣ repairs and downtime.

   **Improved Product Quality:** For restaurants and food processing facilities, water quality ‍is critical. Clean, filtered water⁣ is⁢ essential⁢ for preparing high-quality food, beverages, and ice. A water filtration system for restaurant applications ensures consistent‌ taste and appearance, enhancing⁢ customer satisfaction.

   **Compliance with Regulations:** many industries are subject to stringent water quality regulations. Using an in line⁢ water filter helps businesses comply with these ‍regulations and avoid potential fines or legal issues. Water filter certifications like ⁤NSF ensure your filter meets industry standards.

   **Cost Savings:** While the initial investment in a commercial water filter system may seem significant,it⁤ can lead to⁣ long-term cost savings. By protecting equipment, reducing maintenance, and improving product quality, a water filter can ⁢pay for itself over time. Reduction in bottled ‍water purchases can also contribute to ROI.

## understanding Different Types of in-Line⁣ Water Filters

The world of in-line water filters is diverse, with various types ‍designed to ‌address specific water quality concerns.⁣ Understanding the different options is crucial for selecting⁤ the right filter for your business.

   **Sediment Filters:** These⁤ are typically the ​first line of defense, removing particulate matter like sand, silt, and rust. Sediment filters prevent these contaminants from ⁣clogging downstream filters and damaging equipment. They are measured in microns – the lower the micron rating,⁣ the finer the particles they can remove.

   **Activated Carbon Filters:** ⁣Activated carbon filters are highly effective at removing chlorine, chloramine, volatile organic compounds (VOCs),⁤ and other contaminants ⁣that affect taste and ⁣odor. They work through a⁢ process called adsorption, where contaminants adhere to the surface⁣ of⁤ the carbon. They are​ a crucial part of any commercial water filter system.

   **Membrane filters:** ​ This category includes reverse osmosis (RO)​ and⁤ ultrafiltration (UF) systems.
       **Reverse Osmosis (RO):** RO systems use pressure to force water through a semi-permeable membrane, removing virtually all contaminants, including dissolved salts, minerals, and heavy metals.⁤ A reverse osmosis ‍system commercial submission is common but ​creates waste⁢ water and lower flow.
       **Ultrafiltration (UF):** UF systems​ use ‍a similar process but with a less dense membrane, removing ‍larger molecules like bacteria⁢ and viruses. UF systems waste less ‍water but don't remove as many dissolved solids as RO systems.

   **Water softeners:** ⁤While technically not filters, water softeners remove minerals ​like calcium and magnesium, which ⁤cause hard water. Commercial water softener systems prevent scale buildup ‌in pipes and equipment, improving efficiency and extending lifespan.

## Key ⁤Considerations When choosing a Commercial In-Line Water Filter

Selecting the right in line water filter requires‍ careful consideration of several factors. Here's a breakdown of the most vital aspects to evaluate:

   **Water ⁤Quality Testing:** The⁣ first step is to⁤ conduct a comprehensive water quality ⁣testing. This will identify the specific contaminants present in your water and their concentration levels. Knowing what you need to remove is essential ⁣for choosing​ the appropriate filter type.⁤ If ​you are using well water, a filtration system for well water (commercial) is critical.

   **Flow Rate:** The flow rate refers to the amount of ⁢water ⁢that can pass through the filter per minute. ​It's ‌crucial to select a filter with a ⁢flow rate that meets the demands of your business. Insufficient flow can lead to pressure drops and reduced equipment performance.

   **Water Pressure:** Ensure the filter you choose is ⁣compatible with⁤ your water pressure.‌ Some filters require a minimum pressure to function effectively, while others can be damaged by excessive pressure.

   **Filter Capacity:** The filter capacity​ indicates the ⁣amount of water the filter can process before it​ needs to be replaced. Choose a ⁣filter with a capacity that aligns⁢ with ⁤your water usage. Higher capacity filters require less frequent replacement and reduce maintenance⁤ costs.

   **Micron Rating:** As mentioned earlier, the micron rating indicates the size⁢ of particles the filter can remove.Select a micron rating that ⁢targets the specific contaminants you need to address. A ‌finer⁢ micron rating ‌generally filters ⁣more contaminants, but can also reduce flow rate.

   **Certifications:** Look for filters that are certified by reputable organizations⁤ like NSF International.⁤ NSF certified water filter systems have been tested and verified to meet industry⁢ standards for safety and⁤ performance.

   **Installation and‌ Maintenance:** Consider the ease of installation‌ and maintenance. Some ​filters are easy to install yourself, while others may require professional installation. Also, factor in the ‌cost and frequency of water filter replacement‍ cartridges.Water filter installation can be a significant cost factor.

   **water Filter cost and ⁢Water Filter Price:** balancing cost and performance is essential.​ While the⁤ initial investment in a high-quality filter might potentially be higher, it can‍ pay off in the‌ long run through ⁢reduced maintenance, improved equipment ​lifespan, and better water quality. Exploring filtration system rental options can sometimes be a financially viable alternative.

## Top Picks for Commercial In-Line Water Filters ⁣in 2025

Based on⁤ industry trends, technological advancements, and user reviews, here are some of the top contenders for the best commercial water filter in 2025, categorized by ‍application:

**For Restaurants & Food Service:**

   **High-Capacity Activated ‍Carbon Filter:** Ideal for removing chlorine‍ and‍ other‍ taste and odor-causing contaminants from⁢ drinking water and ice machines. Look for models⁣ with high flow rates to⁢ meet ​peak ‌demand.

## Installation, Maintenance, and Troubleshooting

Proper installation and maintenance are crucial for ensuring the optimal performance and ​longevity of your in line water filter.

   **Installation:** While some filters can be installed by facility personnel, it's frequently enough best to ‌hire a​ qualified plumber for complex installations, especially for whole house systems or RO systems. Water⁤ filter⁣ installation by a professional can prevent leaks and ensure proper functioning.

   **filter Replacement:** Regularly ⁤replace ⁣filter cartridges according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Clogged or expired‌ filters can reduce water flow, ​decrease filtration efficiency, and ‌even contaminate the water. Keep a ​log for your water filter maintenance.

   **Troubleshooting:** Common issues include low water pressure, leaks, and unusual tastes or ‌odors. Consult the manufacturer's manual for troubleshooting tips. If​ you're unable to resolve the issue yourself, contact a qualified technician.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

   **How often should‌ I replace my water filter cartridge?** ‍The replacement ‍frequency depends on the ⁤filter type, water​ quality, and water usage. Refer to the ⁣manufacturer's recommendations for specific guidelines.

   **What is the difference between​ a sediment filter and a carbon filter?** ​Sediment filters⁣ remove particulate matter, while carbon filters remove chlorine and other taste and odor-causing contaminants.

*   **is‌ a reverse osmosis system necessary for⁢ my ​business?** ⁤ RO systems provide⁣ the⁣ highest level of ⁢filtration but ‍are not ‍always necessary. Consider a ​RO system if ​your water contains high levels of dissolved solids or specific contaminants that require removal.*   **Can I install a ​water filter myself?** Simple filters can often be ⁢installed by the owner, but complex systems should be installed by a professional.

## Conclusion

1jl6igo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BryanKohbergerMoscow/comments/1jl6igo/the_states_dismissal_of_autism/,The States Dismissal of Autism,"

I’ve been reading the back and forth between the State and the Defense on Bk regarding his Autism, and honestly, it pissed me off just like I expected it would. Two things in particular stood out: the legal strategy being used, and the outright dismissiveness from the State toward autism and what it actually means to live with it. It’s shocking how little progress has been made in understanding neurodiversity—not just in society, but especially in courtrooms, where that lack of understanding can literally cost someone their life. We’re in 2025. You’d think the legal system would have evolved by now. But here we are.

The State keeps throwing around words like “mild” and emphasizing that Kohberger was diagnosed with the least severe form of Autism Spectrum Disorder—as if that somehow discredits the legitimacy or seriousness of the condition. They claim that because he can drive, is intelligent, and has an education, his autism must not be impairing or relevant. But that logic is fundamentally flawed and medically uninformed. Even so-called “high-functioning” autism can involve profound impairments in emotional regulation, executive functioning, social awareness, and real-world adaptability. These struggles don’t vanish just because someone is articulate or has a degree. In fact, those with “milder” forms of autism are often more likely to be misunderstood precisely because their impairments are less visible. They develop masking behaviours that help them appear socially competent on the surface, while inside they’re overwhelmed by confusion, anxiety, or shutdown.

That’s where the State goes wrong. They use his intelligence to downplay his struggles—a common and harmful misunderstanding. As the DSM-5 makes clear, individuals with high IQs can still have severe adaptive impairments. Being smart doesn’t make someone less disabled. In *USA v. Huseth*, that the defence used the court acknowledged that a man with an IQ of 123 functioned like an 8-year-old in many key areas. Intelligence doesn’t erase the need for support. It just hides it better. The State also tries to undermine the diagnosis by saying “not all people with ASD are the same” or that it’s a “spectrum.” Of course it is. But Kohberger has a clinical diagnosis, confirmed through neuroimaging and extensive expert evaluations. He has measurable impairments in executive function, social interaction, adaptability, and planning and more. This isn’t a vague label. It’s a medically and neurologically supported fact.

Still, the State tries to frame his difficulties as being “in the past,” as if they no longer affect him. That’s not just wrong—it’s dishonest. Yes, some of his challenges began in childhood. But autism doesn’t go away. It evolves. What starts as motor clumsiness or developmental delay becomes rigidity, social confusion, and emotional disconnect in adulthood. The fact that he may have found ways to cope doesn’t mean the impairments are gone. If anything, under pressure ,especially in court they’re more likely to show.

Bryans struggles aren’t hypothetical. They’re not exaggerated. And they’re sure as hell not some convenient legal strategy to get him off. They’re real. They’re measurable. And they are rooted in the physical structure of his brain. He’s been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Level 1, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD)—three overlapping conditions that affect how he thinks, reacts, and lives every day. He has difficulty with basic tasks such as,  tying shoes, buttoning clothing, addressing envelopes. His executive functioning is impaired which means he struggles with planning, organizing, shifting attention, and understanding dynamic situations.

Socially, Bryan lives in a world that doesn’t speak his language. He has trouble reading facial expressions, interpreting tone, or knowing when to speak and how to respond. His affect is flat. His tone is monotone. His body language can appear stiff or strange. After being arrested in a violent SWAT raid—his home breached, his family zip-tied—he asked the officer if he wanted to get coffee at a later date. That’s not arrogance. That’s autism. That’s a complete breakdown in situational awareness, and it's a direct result of how his brain works.

And that’s what makes this so dangerous in a courtroom is that he doesn’t look like someone who’s struggling. He doesn’t look disabled. He’s quiet. Still. Direct. He speaks in full sentences. He has a degree. And  to jurors—unless they’re told otherwise—will interpret that blank stare and still posture as coldness. As guilt. As remorselessness. When in reality, what they’re seeing is autism, amplified by stress. His MRI scans show reduced volume in brain regions tied to emotion, empathy, and social behaviour—like the fusiform gyrus, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. These aren’t theories. These are objective findings, backed by respected neuroscience. This isn’t just about psychology. This is about how his brain is physically wired to function differently.

And yet, the State continues to call it “mild.” Because he can speak. Because he can read. Because he doesn’t look disabled. But let’s be clear: Level 1 ASD can still be profoundly disabling—especially when it’s invisible, misunderstood, and judged by people who expect “normal” behaviour. Add in OCD—compulsive behaviours, contamination fears, obsessive hand-washing—and DCD, which affects fine motor skills and coordination, and you start to see the whole picture. You see a man whose brain doesn’t process the world the way most people do and never has.

And now, his life is on trial. And the State wants to erase all of that. They want to block expert testimony that would help the jury understand him. They want him judged by his appearance. By his tone. By his stare. And they hope the jury assumes the worst.

Let me be clear: I’m not dismissing the seriousness of the charges he’s facing, nor the pain and gravity of what happened. But he may be innocent—and like anyone standing trial, he deserves the right to be understood, not misjudged. Autism matters. Neurodivergence matters. Especially when it directly shapes how someone expresses emotion, reacts to stress, and appears in court. You cannot claim to serve justice while deliberately ignoring the neurological reality of the person standing trial.

Autism isn’t a personality quirk. It’s not social awkwardness. It’s not something you “grow out of.” It’s a lifelong neurological condition that affects how someone processes the world, responds to pressure, interprets others, and expresses themselves. Bryan’s flat affect, his intense gaze, his rigid posture—those are not signs of guilt. They are autistic traits. And the State is hoping the jury doesn’t know that.

That’s not just dishonest, it’s dangerous. The state by blocking this is counting on the jury not understanding autism. They are weaponizing his disability and hoping no one says a word. They don’t want jurors to know what a flat affect means. They don’t want them to understand what masking is. They don’t care that he functions like a child in some areas. Because if the jury sees him as cold, awkward, weird, or unfeeling—they win.

They’re not arguing facts, they’re relying on ignorance. And they seem perfectly willing to let a man be sentenced to death, not because of proven guilt, but because of how his neurodivergence makes him appear in a courtroom.

This is not justice its exploitation.

Let that sink in.

1jl6dyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jl6dyr/the_collapse_zone/,The Collapse Zone,"Howard sat in front of the monitor, silently staring at the reports on the screen. His shift had ended long ago, and the laboratory was empty. He ran his eyes over the lines of text and numbers once again, then grabbed his head with both hands. His temples throbbed wildly, his mouth was dry. It was safe to say that his life had just been split into ""Before"" and ""After.""

This discovery, without exaggeration, would change the world.

At the quantum level, the familiar laws of physics did not apply - time and space were distorted - but this report changed the rules of the game entirely. Of course, it was not yet a final conclusion, but with 99% certainty, every elementary particle they collided in the CERN hadron collider could be an entire universe in itself…

Sitting still was now impossible. He had to walk, to calm himself. It was a monumental discovery, and Howard couldn’t believe that he was the first to decipher this information! Maybe one day his name would even be in physics textbooks. It was incredible! And a little unsettling… No, it was deeply unsettling.

More and more thoughts began to swarm in his head. As he passed the bookshelf, his eyes landed on a book by Oppenheimer - “The Open Mind”. Suddenly, a single thought stopped and hovered over all the others:

If every elementary particle is a separate universe, then during the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider, they were destroying billions of such universes at once.

Did they have the moral right to continue?

Each of those universes could potentially contain life, civilizations, cultures—perhaps even intelligent beings conducting their own scientific research, building societies, creating art - only to experience the tragedy of their own annihilation in the moment Howard and his colleagues smashed two particles together.

Were they not becoming gods - cruel experimenters who, in the name of curiosity, ruthlessly erased countless civilizations from existence? How could humanity criticize the concept of divine creation when they themselves acted as careless creators and destroyers of worlds?

A cold sweat broke out on Howard’s forehead. This was no longer as exciting as it had seemed at first.

Wandering aimlessly, he found himself in a small break room with a mirrored wall. His reflection now looked strange - worn out, almost unfamiliar, as if he were looking at someone else.

The observer’s paradox.

A ringing sound filled his ears - his blood pressure must have spiked.

If every particle was a universe, then… was their own universe just another particle in a collider of a much larger universe? If they could unknowingly destroy billions of realities, was it not just as likely that their own reality would soon be erased by a gigantic collider in some other dimension?

He needed a distraction, even just for a moment, or these thoughts would drive him insane.

Howard walked over to the coffee machine and started making himself a drink. As he reached for the sugar bowl, he noticed a few ants struggling to carry a sugar crystal - huge by their standards. Without thinking, he brushed them off the table.

And then he froze.

Were they blind savages, obliterating countless civilizations in their pursuit of knowledge? Or did they have the right to be indifferent to those so small they could never perceive them?

But what if they themselves were just as insignificant, just as invisible victims to something far greater?

On one hand, science required sacrifices - discoveries came through experiments, and if progress were halted by moral doubts, they might lose the chance for higher knowledge. But on the other hand, if the price of that knowledge was genocide on a cosmic scale, was such a sacrifice justifiable?

Oh, what kind of questions were these?

Howard paced back and forth across the room. Maybe he should just go home, rest, and reevaluate everything in the morning with a fresh mind. But no - he wouldn't sleep. He needed to slow down, to stop, to just breathe.

Ground himself. Focus on something familiar.

His eyes landed on a well-known poster on the wall - the classic depiction of evolution from ape to man. Orange background, black silhouettes. Inhale, exhale. Human evolution…

If they had discovered the existence of these micro-universes, did that not mean they had evolved to a point where they had to accept a new moral responsibility?

Perhaps progress should not be built upon the ashes of burned-out universes, but on a search for knowledge that did not harm others. Maybe their experiments were nothing more than a primitive means of understanding - akin to how ancient doctors once dissected live humans for medical discoveries.

Was there no way to explore without destruction?

He wandered the hallways again, trying to escape the strange, creeping, suffocating feeling of existential horror that was washing over him in waves. He hadn’t even realized where his feet had taken him - until he stood at the staircase leading down to the Large Hadron Collider itself.

The place where it all happened.

He stopped at the top step and froze.

What should they do? Stop and drown in moral dilemmas? Or continue the experiments, accepting their role as destroyers of worlds?

Perhaps those universes were so small that consciousness within them was impossible. Or perhaps the sacrifice of their reality for the sake of human knowledge was simply the natural order of things.

If so, then the very nature of knowledge - was destruction.

Howard stood there for several minutes, unmoving, barely blinking. Then, slowly, he stepped forward, placing one foot down onto the stairway leading below. A step toward the hum of the collider, which now sounded to him like billions of voices - unseen, unheard - screaming into the void, vanishing forever in the grandest act of cosmic genocide.",15,1743088780.0,HFY,4,0.94,False

I hope some more experienced members can help a beginner to make a decision or even change his perspective too.

I want to ditch my 7 year old Jura S8 mainly due to some errors (Please remove the finger from the touch panel, even though there is none, please contact jura support popping on sometimes etc.) and because I found out about the hygiene of such a machine and that the self cleaning is more a marketing thing than anything else. I don't even want to know how much I've spent on original cleaning material over the years...

So I began looking into alternatives as a household that mainly drinks Cafe Crema and every other week a cappuccino. Since we are not into filter coffee or pad / capsule machines, the only other option seems to be an espresso machine, regardless of espressos not being our top priority.

I was researching different manufacturers and machines and I've found a lot of negativity, especially with the longevity of the machines with Sage and Breville machines. So I wouldn't pay full price for them / get an alternative instead.

But I found a leftover stock at a local dealer Today that is selling the Sage Pro and the Pro Touch in Black for **360 € each**. Since I don't want to spend more than like 500 € for my first machine, this offer is getting myself into levels of machines that I would normally not be able to reach with this kind of budget, so of course it made me think twice again, if I shouldn't take the risk.

My understanding and thoughts of these 2 machines:  
\- Usually they have a price gap of like 200+ €  
\- The touch is technically the newer machine, but based on the express, so the base is older and not as high quality as the pro  
\- The touch only allows adjustments of the amount in 1 s steps where the pro allows 0,5 s steps  
\- For the grinder, the manual milk quality and other technical things the machines are basically the same  
\- The touch allows to see the temperature in celsius, the pro only has levels  
\- If and how I can see the pressure on both machines, I don't know yet  
\- They both seem to able to save some settings in order to make the process of creating a cafe crema a bit easier

In general they tick off many of the desired functions, a very quick heating for example, since I can't sell my wife a coffee machine that needs 40 minutes to heat up in the morning or when spontaneous guests want a coffee. They are manual enough to hopefully find some enjoyment in the new hobby of coffee making and good to maintain.

Summarized it seems like a viable option to choose one of these machines as a beginner for that price point. For full price there are definitely better alternatives, but except for something like a DeLonghi Dedica (plus separate grinder) I don't see much comparable at this price point. I find the Dedica too expensive to just try out if I like it and then having the fomo to upgrade to a proper entry level machine like in the sorts of Sage, DeLonghi, Profitec...

I lean towards the pro even though the touch might find more acceptance in our household, but in test videos the screen already looked pretty laggy, so I think the more classic approach of the pro might be better for the next couple of years to have. The difference in the usability seems not that big with only like cappuccino and cafe crema as desired drinks. It feels a bit stupid though, since I would get the ""newer"" and ""more expensive"" machine for the same price. So thats one of the main reasons, why I'm not sure what to pick. And I'm not 100 % confident in Sage / Breville for long term, not expecting it to last as long as the Jura. But that also might be a good thing, then I can upgrade haha xD.

The green sun was shining greenly through the fog and everything was very normal. Captain Jorgo sat on his captain's chair on the bridge of the spaceship *Galaxtron 7000*. He was drinking space coffee from the space coffee machine and thinking thoughts. “Hmm,” he thought, “I wonder if anything will happen today?” And then something happened.

An alarm started very loudly and red lights blinked redly. A crewmember named Blorf shouted, “Captain! The space robots are coming!” Jorgo choked on his coffee and coughed really hard. “Damn it!” he yelled. “Not again!”

The space robots were famous for being evil. They hated organic lifeforms, especially humans and humanish beings like Blorf. They came in giant spaceships that were very big. Extremely big. Metallic and kind of silver. Their weapons were deadly. Super deadly.

“Do something, Captain!” screamed Blorf. “What should I do?!” screamed Jorgo back. “Shoot them!” screamed Blorf again.

“All lasers to maximum!” the Captain commanded. The crew did things. Lasers shot everywhere. The space robots shot back. It was a hard battle with a lot of action. Everything exploded, even things that should not explode.

Then suddenly the ship’s computer said in a computery voice: “Energy level: 0.004%.” That was bad. Very bad. Almost no energy at all.

“I have an idea!” shouted Blorf. “We need to activate the Anti-Robot Mega Virus!”

“What?!” shouted the Captain. “The Anti-Robot Mega Virus! It’s in our backup backup system!” screamed Blorf.

“Do it!” screamed Jorgo. Blorf pushed buttons. Lots of buttons. The computer beeped. Then nothing happened. Then everything happened. The space robots began to dance. First slowly, then wildly and uncontrollably. Then they exploded. All of them.

“We won!” shouted Jorgo. “That was close!” said Blorf. Then they laughed, even though lots of things were broken and some people were probably dead. But it was still kind of a good day. Because they survived.

By KB HURST 

“There are several features I think you will appreciate. This is part of the new display of the phone. You can also enlarge the font if you need to.”

	My grandparents were confused as they looked at the young man selling them the new iPhone. The youngish clerk was a bit disheveled, looking like he had been doing this job way too long. My grandparents had taken me to the Apple store to get my first phone for my thirteenth birthday tomorrow.

	“I like that feature,” my grandma said.

	“You can also unlock additional privacy settings here, "" he said, pointing to the settings feature on my new phone.

	I smiled at him, unsure what he meant by most of what he told us.

	“You probably want to start texting your friends. Give me a number, and I will show you how to add it to your contacts.”

	“You can use mine.” My grandpa said to the salesman.

	“Okay then,” he said, putting in my grandpa's number.

	He showed me how to do a few more things, like where to add a credit card, how to download apps, which ones were free, and which were everyone my age’s favorite.

	My grandpa was getting impatient, so the clerk gave me my phone and had me create a login and password for my account. I finished in no time flat.

	“You can try this app too if you like. It is a “FIND ME NOW” app. It is in addition to the FIND MY PHONE option on your phone.”

	“What does that do?”

	“It creates a quick download of all your data in case it was compromised.”

	“Oh, I see.”

	I finished with the clerk, who was too eager to get a sale, and soon we were off.

	When we left the store, I texted my best friend, Tammy. We texted all night and made plans to hang out for my birthday the next day. I was so excited!

	Later that evening, I was excited for a different reason. My parents had decided I could now be responsible enough to be left home alone since I had my cell phone. They were going to a Wolf Moon party. They went once a year to their friend Selene, an unabashed hippy they had known for years. She had wild parties in the woods where her home was, so my parents would be gone for at least a few hours.

“Are you sure you will be okay?” my mom asked me.

	“Yes, Mom, I have stayed home alone before,” I said, my eyes rolling back in my head. I had stayed home alone, but it had only been for about ten or fifteen minutes at once—nothing longer than a few minutes while my mom dropped off stuff at the post office. 

	“We will only be at Selene’s for a few hours. You have her number. I wrote it on a Post-it and put it on the fridge door.”

	“I know, I know.”

	“I mean, I know you’re thirteen tomorrow, Sabrina. This is a big deal- staying alone for the first time.”

	“I will be fine.”

	“I remember the first time I stayed home alone. I called my mom and dad at dinner, breaking up the conversation and causing them to come home early because I could have sworn we had an intruder in our basement making all sorts of noise. Turns out it was just our cat,” said my dad, laughing.

	“Mom, Dad, please! I will be fine!”

	“I know, sweetheart. The party will be over at around twelve, and we should be home no later than about one. There is a wad of cash for a pizza. NO GUESTS!” my dad said as I watched them leave and pull out of the garage.

	My parents were good people, and I knew they were only worried about me, but they had not been out for a long time. They had grown so overprotective of me in the last year. I didn’t know why; I guessed they didn’t want to see me grow up so fast, but I was not allowed to attend their friend Selene’s party. I'm guessing it was a grown-up affair, with lots of booze and grown-up conversation. My mom kissed my cheek, and my dad as he pulled my mom out of the door.

	“Be good, kiddo; see you soon,” he said.

	I watched as they pulled out of the driveway. I stood in the doorway waving to them, then shut and locked the door.  I went into our kitchen and looked for the wad of cash my dad said he left behind.  Sixty bucks! Good, I could get chicken tenders and pizza. I picked up my new cellphone- a gift from my grandparents. They had taken me just the day before to get it as an early birthday gift. I was so excited. A young man helped us set it up and programmed all the numbers in my phone for me. I had only four digits on my phone. My best friend Tammy, Mom, Dad, and my grandparents' home phone.

I looked at the pizza ad that was left on the counter. I picked up my phone to call in my dinner order when I suddenly received a text.

	Hey there.

	I looked down at my phone, and it wasn’t a number I already had on my phone.

	I stupidly texted back. HEY YOURSELF.

	I looked at my phone and waited for a response.

	Something hit our big bay window in the front of the house. I looked out the window and didn’t see anything.  The curtains were open, and I shut them, feeling a strange chill go up my spine. I felt weird now like someone could be watching me. 

	I was fine, I told myself. It was just an animal or a branch. The wind must have blown something. Whatever it was, I went back to my pizza order. I didn’t feel as hungry as I did a few moments ago. I texted Tammy.

	She didn’t text me back, which was a bummer. Since I had no one to talk to, I picked up the phone and called my grandparents.

	My grandparents didn’t answer the phone. Their answering machine from the 1990s came on, so I left a message. I didn’t want to worry them, so I left a message.

	“Hey, Sabrina, I just wanted to use my new cell phone. It is super cool. Talk to you later!” I said in a sing-song voice.

	My phone buzzed. I looked at it, realizing it was an unknown number. I wasn’t sure who was calling me. What if it was my parents or something else? I answered it and soon regretted it.

	“Hello?”

	Silence.

	“Hello? Dad? Mom? Is that you?”

	Laughter. 

	“Who is this?”

	Breathing was followed by a click, and the phone went dead.

	I sat the phone down and looked around my kitchen. I looked at our back patio door near our kitchen table and went to see if the door was locked. It wasn’t. I quickly shut, locked it, and pulled the blinds closed. I took a deep breath and went to sit on the couch. I turned on the television and searched for something to watch. I looked at our clock on the cable box. My parents had only been gone for about twenty minutes. I had another three hours or more to be alone. Part of me hated admitting it, but I was a bit scared now. Who was calling me on the phone? It had to be Tammy pranking me. Especially since she didn’t want to answer my texts, she always responded to my texts. 

	I finally found a funny movie to watch, and about twenty minutes into it, I decided I was hungry. I paused the TV, downloaded the pizza restaurant’s app to my phone, and placed an order. I selected to pay cash, which meant I would have to pay for it when they dropped it off. Why didn’t my dad just give me his credit card? I could say no contact delivery. Now, I had actually to interact with a stranger at my door. It was awkward to think about. I guess I had to learn to do adult things. I was going to be thirteen tomorrow. I hoped that I would get a superb present from my parents. Tammy was going to come over tomorrow around noon. Then we’d see a new Vampire movie that just came out. I was looking forward to it. I was deep in thought when there was another buzz. It was my phone again. This time, it was from a different number. I thought it might be the pizza place calling to confirm something about my order, so I answered it without hesitation.

	“Hello?”

	Silence.

	“Hello? Tammy, is this you?”

	“My name isn’t Tammy.” said a deep man’s voice into the receiver. 

	“Who is this?” I asked.

	“Who is this?” the voice on the other end mocked me.

	I hung up. I stood up and looked around. This had to be Tammy playing a trick on me. 

	I texted Tammy again. WHY DO YOU KEEP CALLING ME? IT IS MAKING ME MAD. IT ISN’T FUNNY!

	I received a text from Tammy. I AM NOT SENDING YOU TEXTS. I AM AT A CHURCH MEETING WITH MY PARENTS. SEE? Her text was followed by a photo of her in St. Sebastian’s Cathedral. Her family was pretty strict and religious, and Tammy never lied. I started to feel sick to my stomach. The thought of some creeper calling and texting me was too much.

Chances were someone called the number, thinking it was someone else. Maybe my new phone number used to belong to someone else. Maybe this person didn’t know they weren’t calling someone they knew. Maybe they thought I was that person pranking them. Yes, that had to be it. No one prank calls in this day and age.

I stood up from the couch and walked around a bit. I walked over to our 40-gallon aquarium and looked at our betta fish, Bob. I put some food in his tank and waved to him, and he came right up to me and gobbled his food. 

I got another text. HEY, WHY DID YOU THINK I WAS TEXTING YOU?

It was from Tammy.

I KEEP GETTING CREEPY CALLS AND TEXTS AND THOUGHT IT WAS YOU BEING FUNNY.

Tammy sent me a worried emoji. I sent her a thumbs-up emoji and put my phone down.  I got another text just as I sat it on our kitchen counter. This time, it was from the local

pizza joint, letting me know my pizza was five minutes away.

I was getting hungry suddenly, and my belly began to growl. It dawned on me that I had not 

eaten anything since my grandparents had taken me to the Apple store for the phone. 

I opened our fridge, got out a bottle of coke, and sat it on the counter. There was a ding on my phone. Your delivery driver, Mark, has arrived.

There was a loud knock at the front door, which caused me to jump a bit. I slowly walked over to the door and looked out the peephole. It was a guy with a pizza, and he was wearing a ball cap that said TIM’S BEST ITALIAN.

I opened the door without hesitation. 

“Hi, delivery for Sabrina?”

“Yes, that is me. Oh I almost forgot your cash. I’ll be right back.”

I went into the kitchen and grabbed the wad of cash my dad left me.

“How much?”

“Twenty-two seventeen,”

I handed him thirty dollars, and he left.

I was so excited to eat my pizza. I felt so grown up. I owned my phone, ordered food, and paid for it myself. I turned the television up and sat down on the couch with my pizza, coke, and a giant roll of paper towels. 

I unpaused the movie from earlier and began laughing at the slapstick comedy. I was two pieces of the large pepperoni and sausage pizza when my phone buzzed again. Who was texting me now? I looked down, and it was another text from that weird number. I decided to block the number and move on. I looked down at my phone to do just that, and that is when I saw it. *How is the pizza?* I was immediately ill. 

I blocked the number and set my plate on the coffee table. I contemplated calling my parents, but I didn’t want them to think I couldn’t handle being alone.

Chances were, it was someone who knew I was home alone. Maybe Tammy mentioned it to her older brother. Maybe Tammy was lying after all. People ordered pizza on Friday nights. 

I sat there for a few moments, wondering what I should do. I heard the front door creaking. I turned to look at it and realized it was wide open, swaying in the wind and making a creaking sound. My heart fell into my stomach, and I stood up. I ran over to the door, and while I was too scared to look outside, I peeked around the corner of the porch and didn’t see anyone. Closing it fast and locking it, I took a deep breath. 

I probably didn’t shut it all the way, and I smiled to myself. I was so excited about pizza and a movie that I forgot to lock the door. I was stupid. That is all; the case is closed.

I refused to spend the rest of the evening creeped out by some weirdo who had nothing better to do on a Friday night than scare other people for fun. I sat back down and put my phone aside. I was now fully engrossed in the movie I had tried three times to finish.

I nibbled on another slice of pizza and soon forgot about all the weirdness from earlier. It had been nearly an hour since I had received any other texts or weird phone calls, so blocking the number was the obvious solution.

BOOM! Something had fallen from upstairs. It was such a loud sound that I thought maybe my parent’s dresser had tipped over. I paused the movie for yet a fourth time and headed upstairs. I was almost afraid of the disaster I was going to encounter. I got to the top of the landing, and that was when I saw it. The stairs to the attic that were held up by a latch had been unlatched, releasing the stairs, and not only were they unlatched, but they had completely detached from the ceiling and were in a mess on the hallway floor. 

I sighed. My dad would have to fix this mess. I pushed the stairs off to the side so they wouldn’t be in the middle of the hallway and returned to the couch. I had been sitting there for only a few moments when my phone buzzed again. I picked it up in case it was my mom and dad. It was another text, this time from a new random number.

You never said if you liked the pizza.

I looked, and it was a photo of me with my back turned away from the front door, sitting on the couch. I heard the front door creak again and turned to see it open again. I had just locked it! I heard footsteps from upstairs. Someone was in my house! I began to panic. I was watching the door, waiting for someone to come through it and waiting on the person who was now walking down the stairs to get to the bottom and get to me. I wouldn’t worry if someone was coming in the front door. I grabbed my phone and began to race towards the front door to leave when, all of a sudden, I felt hands around my neck. I freaked out and began to feel as if I could not breathe. Great, and an asthma attack- the worst possible time to have one is when someone is trying to kill you. I tried to let out a scream, but my lungs felt as if they were being crushed. I felt lightheaded, and then, as a last-ditch effort of strength, I pushed back with all of my strength and knocked the intruder into a small table my mother had by the front door. Above it was a mirror crashing down, causing the glass to go everywhere. A shard of glass must have cut him because he screamed and loosened his grip on me enough to let me run from him. I still had my phone in hand, and I ran to the only room I knew had a lock on it.

I ran into the downstairs bathroom, locking the door. I reached for my phone and dialed 9-1-1.  I waited for the operator to come on, but instead, the phone rang and rang. What the absolute hell? Wasn’t the 9-1-1 operator supposed to come on immediately to help? I was about to die if I didn’t get an inhaler or this intruder out of my house.  I looked down at the drawer under the sink. I kept an inhaler in there. I opened it, and there it was. My saving grace. I took a puff from it and then returned to my phone. My breaths were short and painful as I slowly calmed myself. It was happening so fast.

I kept expecting the intruder to come banging on my bathroom door, but I didn’t hear footsteps. I sat on the bathroom floor under our window and waited on the phone, but there was still nothing. Then I looked at my phone. It was now saying there was no signal. I looked up and realized the entire house was now quiet. Had the intruder gone? Maybe when I ran away, he left thinking I was calling the cops. I was still trying to breathe when I heard it. Footsteps, but not coming from the hallway- they were coming from outside. I looked up from the bathroom floor at the window above me. There was a man’s face looking back at me. He had his entire head in the window and was inching his way inside. The grin on his face was terrifying. 

“You can’t escape, little girl. Don’t worry; Mitch will show you a real good time.” He laughed. I looked at him and realized I knew him. He was the guy who helped my grandparents buy my new cell phone. 

I screamed at him.

“Get out! Leave me alone!” I didn’t know what that was supposed to do; I guess I was just in panic mode. 

I stood up and opened the bathroom door, but before I could leave, another man was outside. There were two of these monsters in my house now, and I couldn’t possibly fight them. A feeling of utter and complete despair hit me, and I began to cry.

“Oh, don’t cry, sweetheart; we will take good care of you tonight. Lock the front door when you come back in, Mitch.”

I didn’t know what human beings were capable of until that moment. I was about to be assaulted or worse- murdered. In my own house, no less.

When the other man came in, he locked the front door and dimmed the lights. They both began to talk about what they wanted to do to me. I can’t even repeat the things they wanted to do to me. Their eyes were dark now, hungry, and one of them began to unzip his pants. That is when I decided to make one last ditch effort to scream my lungs out.  As I did, they tried to muffle me, but I bit the one with his hand over my mouth. I tasted his blood now. 

He screamed and hit me in the face. I fell back into the other guy, and he held me as the other man began to hit me in the face, smacking me until my lip bled. But I still tasted his blood. I still felt rage, not so much fear anymore. Something inside of me began to enjoy this cat-and-mouse game. I felt my stomach start to turn. The man stopped hitting me and instead was standing there staring at me.  I felt my shoulders and neck like I had a thousand-pound hand twisting them- stretching them. I felt my teeth and lips swell now. I couldn’t close my hands, and I couldn’t stand any longer. With a force I did not know I possessed, I flung the man holding me back against the wall. He hit his head and slid to the floor.

I looked at the guy called Mitch. He was no longer smiling at me.

“What’s wrong with you girl?” 

“Why? Am I not pretty enough for you anymore?” I was saying the words, but I didn’t speak them. It was like someone was possessing me.

I still tasted his blood, and I admit this sounds repulsive, but I wanted more of it. Nothing was going to satisfy me now. I tried to bleed him dry the way he wanted to bleed me-only I wanted his flesh in my mouth- I wanted to take his beating heart in my teeth and devour every last bit of it.

I fell to the floor and felt my body as if it were ripping in half. I cried in pain, and my eyes - I was blind now. I couldn’t see or hear anything now. My skin stung and itched all at the same time. All I could do was smell. I smelled everything. The fish tank- the smell of the algae was pungent to me. The garlic from the pizza was strong, too, and the gross pink strawberry lubricant the guy had in his jacket pocket. I remembered suddenly. When I opened my eyes, he ran out the door, screaming at the sight of me. I didn’t understand what was happening, and I did not care.

I didn’t know why, but it made me smile inside. I chased after Mitch, and I kept going until I caught up with him. With a mighty push, I forced him onto the grass in my front yard and began to tear his shirt open with my - claws? Whatever, I’d worry about that later. I pulled at his chest, now clawing and clawing at it until his flesh was open and his ribcage exposed. I ripped open his ribcage, pulling apart the unit of bones until I could get to his beating heart. The man was screaming, but he had stopped once I opened up his ribcage. All I wanted was that juicy goodness.  Mitch's heart was still beating when I  bit into it and felt my body relax. I began to feel calm and gleeful. It was like eating a box of sweets - a forbidden delicacy. I devoured his heart quickly, and then I lapped up the blood across his chest and neck. His dead eyes were wide open as staring up at the stars and the full moon in the sky.

I was still hungry. I smelled the other man- I ran to my house and looked at him. He was slowly realizing where he was. I had knocked him out pretty good, but he was coming to. I couldn't let him get away! I approached him slowly, unsure if he would try to run, too. He didn’t see me at first, but I stood beside him. Was I invisible? I looked down and couldn’t even see my hands. Holy crapI was invisible! I must have been in full hunting mode. My entire body was cloaked. I could hear his heart beating. His lungs were slow to breathe. I remembered the dirty, malicious things he wanted to do to me- me, a little girl, and I ripped into his chest.  He screamed, and I lost all my hearing in the kill. It felt so good to be alive.  It felt so good to kill this monster. 

I couldn’t stop the blood lust. This was too delicious now.  I looked down at my damage and used my strength to stand as best I could. I felt high, even though I had never tried a drug in my life. Everything felt weird to me. My body was covered in hair; I touched my face with my claws and had a snout.  What was I? I think I knew.

I walked over to the broken mirror on the floor and picked up a large chunk of it to reveal my face.  My eyes blinked as if they struggled to see, and I realized it was from all the blood covering them. I stumbled backward and nearly fell onto the floor. I had yellow eyes covered in blondish-red hair.  I was - a friggin werewolf! My snout was covered in dark red blood. I touched my face and felt almost sick as I was beginning to feel like I was getting back to normal.

The front door opened suddenly, and I turned in fear, thinking it was another intruder.

My mom screamed and dropped what looked to be a to-go plate. There was a bloodied heart on it, and it was now lying next to the plate on the floor in a bloodied mess.

“It’s okay, Sabrina,” my father was saying.

“We have some dinner for you, but it looks like you already had some.” my mother said.

I felt my body relaxing now, and I felt myself changing again. I passed out.



\######



I awoke in bed a while later wearing pajamas and a cold washcloth on my head.

“I think I had the craziest dream.”

My father came in smelling of bleach. “Sorry, kiddo. It wasn’t a dream. We are just sorry we weren’t here for your first time.”

“You mean I really did all those things?”

“Yes, how does that make you feel?” my mother asked, her face worried.

“Honestly, kinda cool. But does that mean you are like me, too? And all those cool superpowers we have? Like invisibility or cloaking?”

My parents looked at each other, concerned. They almost looked shocked or confused by my comment about my ""cloaking” ability. “We were waiting for your birthday to give you the big talk, but it looks like your body had other things in mind.”

“Those men tried to hurt me.”

My father looked down at me, understandably. “I was afraid that was what happened. We are so sorry we weren’t here, but you weren’t supposed to change until after your 13th birthday. That is why we were preparing with Selene. Sometimes, when you are deathly afraid, it can kick in early. In these circumstances, I am glad it did.”

“Is that why you have been so overprotective lately?”

“Yes, don’t worry. We have been at this for a long time,” my father said.

“What were you preparing at Selene's?"" I asked,

“I think you know what we are,"" my father began. ""We are the things that go bump in the night. We were getting hearts from turkeys, which Selene raised. We need fresh hearts to maintain civility. We choose not to kill people, but please don't feel bad you did! Those men—I could smell what they were,” my father said.

I smiled at my parents. Realizing that one- werewolves were real, and two, I was one. 

“By the way, where did you take their bodies?”

“Somewhere they will never be found.”

“Happy birthday, Sabrina,” my mother said, and she and my father hugged me.

So this was thirteen.

Any idea why this might be?

My setup: Hario Switch 02, standard Hario (tabbed) filters; Kingrinder K6; and Greater goods temp-controlled kettle.

My methods: Lance Hedrick V60 (3x coffee weight bloom for 1 min, then single pour for rest of water), simple 4 minute steep in the switch, and sometimes a 5-pour equal-weight V60. Usually 195 - 206F.

The coffees: 

* S&W Columbia Santa Monica Lychee Co-Ferment: ""balanced... with flavors of lychee, cherry, and white grape, plus some rose tea like florality."" 
* SK Coffee Los Nogales Decaf: ""Bright fruit, Skittles, Banana bread, silky smooth""
* Rogue Wave El Salvador Santa Matilde Ariz-Herrera Family: ""Blueberry, Concord grape, molasses, orange, plum""

I would prefer to taste fruity, juicy, bold flavors, or really even just some of the listed notes. Instead, I get some of the fruitiness in the aroma, but usually there's a dominant black tea taste in the coffee itself. In a few brews, it tastes like black tea, but with some fruit steeped in there too. Am I underextracting? Do I need to clean my brewer with cafiza?

>

I’m a 23F who recently moved back to Manchester after studying in a different city for almost five years. While I made amazing friends at university, I now feel like I’m starting from scratch when it comes to friendships here. The two friends I do have are both engaged, one is completely consumed in the process (which is understandable), and the other has strict parents and isn’t allowed to do much.

I can’t help but feel that this Ramadan would have been so much better if I had friends to go to Taraweeh with and maybe grab an iced coffee after. :( I’ve had great friendships with non-Muslims in the past and still get along with them well, but right now, I’m really hoping to connect with some Muslim sisters.

I’d love to find like-minded girls who enjoy running errands together, shopping, trying new foods, and just chilling. More than that, I want friendships where we can have deep, intellectual conversations, grow in our deen together, and give each other space for both progress and grace.

Insha’Allah, if anyone in the Greater Manchester area is interested in becoming friends, please feel free to reach out! ",4,1743087958.0,MuslimLounge,2,0.83,False

I have DF83V2 since August 2024 , and I am going crazy with it. I make on average 3 19g espresso shots a day , and when friends are with us I  of course go beyond, and here is my problem:

I have found some solid grind levels for my first cold start shot ( for my usual beans it is around 12.5 and for decaff it is 9.5 ) . Now this works fine for the first shot where I get 26-30 seconds extraction with 19g coffee in a 17g basket, and it tastes awesome .

The problem is when I do the second shot with the same geind level it will come out in 20 seconds so I have to dial down by 2 points to compensate , and then for the third shot I have to dial like 1 or 1.5 point more and then it somehow stabilizes for the next shots . 

Is this normal? What is happening here ? Any tips ?

My wife and I are planning our 2nd trip to Japan, went for the first time in our honeymoon and absolutely loved it. That time we visited Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka as well as other places such as Hakone, Nara, Kurashiki and Takayama. This time we want to visit the Tohoku region and we are looking on reccomendations on what we have searched or any other places that are worthy (even if it means shifting our schedule a bit).  
We are going for 15 days, 20 if our budget allows it, over Christmas, so we'de be going early-mid December and returning at the end of December or early in January.  
We really like walking around, admiring the cities, finding cozy coffee shops, nice parks and generally enjoying the vibe. Also visiting temples, castles, etc, and doing some light trail hiking. We dont really like guided tours but any suggestions are welcome and we'll look into them.

What we have so far is:  
\- Tokyo: our first time around we didnt get to explore a lot of it, we spent 5-6 days but didnt really make the most out of the first 2 days due to jetlag (also, Tokyo is massive and there's lots to see). This time we'd stay another 6 maybe 7 days, exploring different neighbourhoods that we didnt get to see our first time over, such as Asakusa or Ueno, and some day trips a little further like Kamakura or Mt Takao.  
\- NIkko  
\- Fukushima  
\- Aizuwakamatsu  
\- Yamagata  
\- Sendai or Matsushima  
\- Sapporo

Our idea is to go from Tokyo to the rest of the places mentiones above, maybe arriving at one place, spend the day looking around, spend the night and move onto the next one the following day. Might stay somewhere 2 nights instead of one if necessary.

I just wanted to drop in and share something that might seem small, but it made a huge difference for me today. I’ve been struggling with a lot of stress and anxiety lately, and the smallest things have felt impossible.

This morning, I woke up and told myself, “I’m just going to get out of bed and make a cup of coffee.” Simple, right? But for some reason, that felt like a monumental task. But I did it. And then I sat down to drink it. And you know what? That tiny action felt like a massive win.

Sometimes, it’s easy to feel like we’re failing because we can’t accomplish everything all at once. But today, that small win was a reminder that even the little steps count.

I guess my point is, if you’re feeling overwhelmed or stuck, sometimes it’s okay to just focus on the smallest thing you can control. You don’t have to tackle everything in one go. If getting out of bed and making a cup of coffee is all you can do today, that’s enough.

\## That Time I Got Reincarnated as an Investment Banker for Draconic Business Firms

The last thing Kenji Tanaka remembered with any clarity was the distinct, soul-crushing beige of the Nakatomi Corporation's 34th-floor carpeting. It was the kind of beige that whispered of crushed dreams, lukewarm coffee, and endless spreadsheets detailing projected third-quarter earnings for synthetic yak butter substitutes. He’d been hunched over his keyboard, pupils dilated like black holes sucking in the harsh fluorescent light, trying to reconcile a discrepancy in the amortization schedule that stubbornly refused to yield to either logic or aggressive formula manipulation.

His temples throbbed in time with the flickering light overhead. Three days. Seventy-two hours fueled by stale protein bars, vending machine coffee that tasted suspiciously like burnt plastic, and the sheer, animal terror of facing Mr. Henderson with incomplete data. The numbers swam before his eyes, merging into meaningless hieroglyphs. 10.2% ROI... depreciation... goodwill impairment... synergistic leverage...

\*Leverage this,\* a tiny, rebellious voice squeaked in the back of his exhausted mind. He imagined hurling the ridiculously heavy ergonomic keyboard through the panoramic window, watching it arc gracefully towards the indifferent cityscape below. A fleeting fantasy, crushed instantly by the weight of responsibility and the crippling fear of unemployment.

He vaguely registered a distant rumble, not dissimilar to the sound the ancient office printer made when attempting complex collations. Odd. The printers were usually quiet after midnight, silenced by the same exhaustion that permeated the building’s very structure. The rumble grew, accompanied by a vibration that travelled up his worn office chair, rattling his teeth. An earthquake? Unlikely. Tokyo was prepared for such things, but this felt... different. More purposeful. Like the world itself was clearing its throat.

Then came the horn. Not a polite city beep, but a bellowing, apocalyptic blast that seemed to vibrate in his bones. He looked up, bleary-eyed, just in time to see the familiar beige carpet replaced by the rapidly expanding grille of a very, \*very\* large truck. It filled his entire field of vision, chrome gleaming with malevolent intensity under the office lights that were suddenly, inexplicably, shining from \*outside\* the 34th-floor window.

\*Ah,\* Kenji thought with a peculiar sense of calm detachment, the kind only achievable through terminal exhaustion or imminent demise. \*So this is how the audit finally ends.\*

His final, fleeting sensation was not pain, but surprise. The truck horn sounded suspiciously like a duck. A very large, very angry, interdimensional duck.

\*\*\*

Darkness. Silence. A profound lack of beige.

Kenji floated, or perhaps simply existed, in a void devoid of sensation. No throbbing headache, no aching back, no gnawing anxiety about Mr. Henderson. It was... peaceful. Too peaceful. His accountant's mind, even in this disembodied state, immediately flagged it as suspicious. Peace was usually a precursor to something expensive.

\*Am I dead?\* The thought formed without voice, without effort. \*Probably. Getting hit by a truck tends to do that. Especially one seemingly capable of phasing through thirty-four floors of reinforced concrete.\*

He tried to take stock. No body. No senses. Just awareness. It was like being pure thought, adrift in an ocean of nothing. Was this heaven? Hell? Purgatory? Some kind of cosmic waiting room with infinitely better decor than the Nakatomi lobby?

\*Right, assets and liabilities,\* his professional instincts kicked in, searching for familiar ground. \*Assets: One slightly used soul, extensive knowledge of Excel shortcuts, moderate proficiency in passive-aggressive email composition. Liabilities: Crippling student loan debt (presumably void now?), a lingering fondness for instant ramen, an unfinished amortization schedule.\*

The assessment wasn't promising.

Suddenly, a pinprick of light appeared in the vast darkness. It expanded rapidly, not like an explosion, but like an aperture opening. Colors bled into the void – golds, scarlets, deep emeralds, colours richer and more vibrant than anything he’d ever seen on a monitor screen. Accompanying the light was a sound, a low, resonant hum that felt ancient and powerful, like the breathing of a sleeping giant.

Words coalesced within the light, forming not from ink or pixels, but from the light itself, shimmering like heat haze on a summer road.

\*\*SUBJECT: Tanaka, Kenji.\*\* \*\*STATUS: Deceased (Primary Causality: Anomalous Kinetic Translocation Event - Designation: TRUCK-KUN Variant 7G).\*\* \*\*SOUL INTEGRITY: 87.4% (Acceptable parameters).\*\* \*\*APTITUDE ASSESSMENT (Latent): Financial Acumen (Superior), Risk Analysis (Proficient), Bureaucratic Navigation (Exceptional), Existential Dread Management (Adequate).\*\* \*\*RECOMMENDED PLACEMENT: Aethelgard, Realm 7. Role: Junior Portfolio Analyst, Ignis & Aurum Consolidated.\*\* \*\*ACCEPT? (Y/N)\*\*

Kenji stared, or rather, \*perceived\*, the glowing text. Anomalous Kinetic Translocation Event? TRUCK-KUN? Was that the official cosmic designation for getting isekai'd? It figured the universe had bureaucratic jargon.

Ignis & Aurum Consolidated. Sounded like a law firm, or maybe... \*Ignis\*. Latin for fire. \*Aurum\*. Gold. Fire and Gold? In Aethelgard, Realm 7? This wasn't sounding like standard afterlife procedure.

His mind raced. What were the alternatives? Eternal void? Reincarnation as a slime? Another lifetime wrestling with spreadsheets, just in a different dimension? This 'Junior Portfolio Analyst' role sounded suspiciously familiar, depressingly so. But... Ignis and Aurum. Fire and Gold. It tickled a part of his brain that hadn't been stimulated since his childhood obsession with fantasy novels.

What was the downside? He was already dead. Worst case scenario, it was another beige office, just with more… fire?

\*What the hell.\* He focused his non-existent will on the shimmering 'Y'.

\*\*PLACEMENT CONFIRMED. COMMENCING SOUL TRANSFERENCE AND BIOLOGICAL VESSEL INTEGRATION. PLEASE HOLD.\*\*

The light flared, washing over him like a warm wave. The resonant hum intensified, resolving into distinct notes, a complex harmony that felt both alien and deeply familiar. He felt a pulling sensation, a sense of being poured into something. Textures registered – coarse fabric against skin, cool air on his face, the solid weight of a body. \*His\* body. Or \*a\* body, at least.

He gasped, drawing in a lungful of air that smelled utterly unlike Tokyo. It was crisp and cool, carrying hints of woodsmoke, something vaguely metallic, and an underlying, almost electric tang, like the air before a thunderstorm.

Kenji blinked his eyes open.

\*\*\*

He wasn't on the 34th floor anymore. He wasn’t anywhere near Tokyo.

He lay on a cot, a surprisingly comfortable one, covered by a thick, woolen blanket dyed a deep sapphire blue. The room was small, constructed from rough-hewn timber beams and dark, polished stone. A single window, paned with thick, slightly warped glass, looked out onto… well, not a cityscape.

Treetops. Enormous, ancient-looking trees with bark like wrinkled leather and leaves the size of dinner plates, glowing faintly with an inner luminescence. Beyond them, jagged peaks clawed at a sky painted in hues of violet and rose, dotted with two, maybe three moons of varying sizes and colours. One was a brilliant silver crescent, another a smaller, angry-looking crimson orb.

Okay. Definitely not Kansas. Or Tokyo.

He sat up, swinging his legs over the side of the cot. The floor was cold stone beneath his bare feet. He looked down at himself. He wore simple, loose-fitting trousers made of a sturdy, burlap-like material and a tunic of the same sapphire blue as the blanket. His hands… they looked like his hands, perhaps a little less pale, calluses slightly different. He felt… younger? More rested than he had in years, despite the interdimensional truck incident. The existential dread was still there, naturally, but the physical exhaustion was gone.

A small, three-legged stool stood beside the cot, holding a ceramic pitcher, a simple cup, and a folded set of clothes. More tunics and trousers, sturdy boots that looked suspiciously like leather, and a thick, dark grey cloak. Practical. No sign of a briefcase or a laptop.

He stood, testing his legs. Everything seemed to work. He walked to the window, peering out. The air outside hummed with unseen energy. Strange, bird-like creatures with iridescent wings flitted between the giant trees. Far below, he could just make out movement – figures walking along a path, too distant to discern clearly.

A knock echoed through the small room, startling him. Not a polite rap, more like a series of sharp, impatient taps, like claws on wood.

Kenji hesitated. ""Uh... come in?""

The door, a solid plank of dark wood reinforced with black metal bands, swung inward with surprising speed. Standing in the doorway was... not human.

The creature was perhaps four feet tall, whip-thin, with skin the colour of aged parchment stretched taut over sharp, bird-like bones. Its head was overlarge, dominated by huge, luminous yellow eyes with slitted pupils that seemed to pierce right through Kenji’s carefully constructed facade of bewildered calm. Pointed ears twitched atop its head, and a long, reptilian tail swished impatiently behind it, thumping softly against the stone doorframe. It wore a functional, dark leather jerkin studded with what looked like polished obsidian, and carried a rolled-up scroll tucked under one spindly arm. Its expression was one of profound irritation, as if Kenji’s mere existence was an inconvenience.

The creature sniffed the air, its nostrils flaring. ""About time. Thought you'd sleep through the First Quarter Assessment."" Its voice was a dry, rasping hiss, like pebbles shaken in a tin can. ""Name's Grimgleam. Personnel Integration and Preliminary Orientation. You're the new meat. Tanaka, Kenji."" It wasn’t a question.

Kenji blinked. Personnel Integration? New meat? This felt disturbingly corporate. ""Uh, yes. That's me. Kenji Tanaka. Pleased to... meet you, Grimgleam."" He offered a hand, then quickly retracted it as Grimgleam just stared at it with undisguised contempt.

Grimgleam snorted, a puff of dry air. ""Save the pleasantries. Waste of billable hours. Get dressed. Boots, cloak. We move."" He gestured sharply with a three-clawed hand towards the clothes on the stool. ""Sun's barely cleared the Titan's Teeth, and Lord Valerius doesn't appreciate tardiness. Especially not from off-world recruits.""

""Off-world?"" Kenji repeated, pulling on the strange, comfortable tunic. It felt like soft wool mixed with something finer, almost silky. ""So, this isn't... Japan?""

Grimgleam let out a sound that might have been a laugh if it hadn't sounded so much like rocks grinding together. ""Japan? Realm designation unknown. High density of anomalous translocation events, low magical saturation, primary export: existential angst. Correct?""

""That... sounds disturbingly accurate, yes,"" Kenji admitted, fumbling with the laces on the surprisingly well-fitting boots. They felt sturdy, broken-in. Someone had clearly anticipated his arrival. Or his shoe size, at least.

""Good. Means the pre-briefing scroll wasn't complete fabrication,"" Grimgleam rasped. ""This is Aethelgard. Capital city of the Draconic Principalities, commercial heart of the Western Ranges, and headquarters of Ignis & Aurum Consolidated. Your new employer. Lucky you."" The sarcasm was thick enough to spread on toast. If they had toast here. Did they have toast?

""Ignis & Aurum,"" Kenji murmured, fastening the cloak. It was heavy, warm. ""Fire and Gold. So... I'm working for...""

""Dragons,"" Grimgleam finished flatly, his yellow eyes unblinking. ""Primarily. And associated entities. Giants, Dwarven Mining Consortiums, Elven Sylvanculture Guilds, Naga Trade Fleets... If it has assets worth managing, claws worth shaking, or a hoard worth diversifying, I&A has a portfolio for it. You're a Junior Analyst. Bottom rung. Expect long hours, minimal gratitude, and a non-zero chance of incineration if you miscalculate the yield on a particularly cherished pile of gemstones.""

Incineration. Right. Standard corporate hazard in this dimension, apparently. Kenji swallowed. ""So, investment banking... for dragons.""

""Simplification, but functional,"" Grimgleam conceded, tapping his claws impatiently on the scroll. ""Less 'banking' in your primitive sense, more... strategic asset allocation, risk mitigation across multi-century timelines, cross-planar arbitrage, hoard optimization. Basic stuff.""

Basic stuff. Right. Kenji felt a familiar headache beginning to throb behind his eyes, a ghostly echo of his Nakatomi days. Some things, it seemed, were universal.

""Let's move,"" Grimgleam snapped again, turning sharply. His tail nearly took out Kenji's knee. ""Orientation is mobile. Try to keep up. And don't stare at the Grand Wyrms. They find it gauche.""

Kenji scrambled after the small, reptilian creature, pulling the heavy cloak tighter around himself as he stepped out of the small room and into the corridor. It was wider than he expected, stone walls lit by glowing crystals set in ornate bronze sconces. The air here was cooler, carrying the scent of ozone and something sharp, like antiseptic. Other doors lined the hallway, some grander than others, carved with intricate symbols he didn't recognize. He caught glimpses of other figures – a hulking form covered in stony grey skin, a slender figure wrapped in shadows, a pair of dwarves arguing loudly in a guttural tongue – disappearing around corners or into rooms. This wasn't just an office building; it felt more like a barracks, or perhaps a university dorm for mythical creatures.

Grimgleam moved with surprising speed, his clawed feet clicking rhythmically on the stone floor. Kenji hurried to keep pace, his mind buzzing with a thousand questions. Dragons. Giants. Magic. Hoard optimization? What had he gotten himself into?

""This facility,"" Grimgleam hissed over his shoulder, not breaking stride, ""is the Annex. Primarily housing for junior staff, probationary hires, and... unique acquisitions like yourself. The main Spire is where the real work happens. Where \*you\* will be working. Assuming you survive the first week.""

""Survive?"" Kenji asked, perhaps a little too loudly.

Grimgleam stopped abruptly, whipping around. His yellow eyes narrowed. ""This isn't your 'Nakatomi Corporation,' human. Mistakes here don't just result in angry memos from middle management. They result in being vaporized, polymorphed into something unpleasant, or possibly used as a decorative paperweight for the next geological epoch. Understand? Lord Valerius values competence. He \*despises\* incompetence. And his methods for personnel review are... direct.""

Kenji nodded mutely, the image of Mr. Henderson's disappointed frown suddenly seeming rather quaint.

""Good. Now, currency."" Grimgleam reached into a pouch at his belt and produced a handful of coins. They weren't uniform discs like yen or dollars. There were heavy, octagonal pieces of dull gold stamped with the profile of a stern-looking dragon (Aurum, Kenji guessed), smaller, thinner silver triangles etched with stylized scales (Scales?), and tiny, rough nuggets of what looked like raw copper (Bits?). ""Gold Aurum, Silver Scales, Copper Bits. Standard denominations. One Aurum is fifty Scales, one Scale is a hundred Bits. Memorize it. Your starting stipend is loaded onto this."" He pressed a smooth, dark grey stone, about the size of a credit card but thicker and warm to the touch, into Kenji's hand. ""Slate ID. Don't lose it. Contains your credentials, basic access permissions, and your pathetic starting funds. Food hall in the Annex takes Slate or coin. Most places in the Spire require Slate verification.""

Kenji turned the warm stone over in his hand. It felt faintly alive. Slate ID. So, they had tech here, just... different. Magitech?

They reached a large archway at the end of the corridor. Beyond it lay open air – a wide, stone balcony overlooking a scene that stole Kenji’s breath.

They were high up. \*Impossibly\* high up. The Annex seemed to be built into the side of a colossal, obsidian-black tower – the Spire, presumably – that stretched so far into the violet sky Kenji couldn't see the top. Clouds, tinged pink by the dawn light, wreathed its upper reaches.

Below them sprawled the city of Aethelgard.

It wasn't a city of skyscrapers and asphalt like Tokyo. It was a breathtaking, impossible tapestry of architectural styles woven together. Towers carved from luminous white stone pierced the sky alongside squat, fortress-like structures of dark granite. Graceful, arching bridges spanned dizzying chasms between different levels of the city, some seemingly held aloft by magic alone, glowing runes pulsing along their lengths. Buildings clung to the steep slopes of the mountain the Spire was built upon, their rooftops a mix of red tile, green copper, and darker, scale-like materials. Rivers of molten gold – actual, literal molten gold – flowed in contained channels through certain districts, casting a warm, fiery glow upwards. Strange vehicles zipped through the air – skiffs propelled by crackling lightning, ornate palanquins carried by winged beasts, and stranger things Kenji couldn't even name. The air buzzed with noise – the clang of hammers, distant roars, cries of street vendors, the chiming of unseen bells. And everywhere, dominating the skyline, were motifs of dragons – statues, carvings, banners, the very shape of the buttresses and gargoyles.

""Impressive, isn't it?"" Grimgleam's dry rasp held a trace of something that might have been civic pride. ""Built over millennia. The Old City down there dates back before the Scouring. The Spire itself is anchored directly to the Heartstone. Old magic. Powerful.""

Kenji could only nod, speechless. This wasn't just another world; it was another scale of existence entirely.

""Right, enough sightseeing,"" Grimgleam snapped, pulling him back to reality. ""Transport's here.""

Kenji looked where the kobold indicated. Hovering silently beside the balcony was an open-topped platform, about ten feet square, made of the same dark metal as the Spire. It floated without any visible means of propulsion, a faint blue glow shimmering beneath it.

""Step lively,"" Grimgleam ordered, hopping onto the platform. It dipped slightly under his weight.

Kenji hesitated for a second, then stepped aboard. The platform felt solid beneath his boots. As soon as he was on, it began to move smoothly, silently pulling away from the balcony and accelerating downwards, angling towards the main Spire. The wind whipped at his cloak, carrying the complex scents of the city – roasting meat, exotic spices, sulphur, ozone, damp stone, and something else, something ancient and primal, like static electricity and old bones.

He gripped the low railing, knuckles white. He'd never been fond of heights, and plummeting towards a fantastical city on a magic floating platform wasn't helping.

Grimgleam watched him, a flicker of amusement in his yellow eyes. ""First time on a gravity lift? Try not to void your stomach lining. Paperwork's a nightmare.""

They descended rapidly, swooping past other lifts carrying a bizarre assortment of passengers – stern-looking dwarves laden with tools, elegant elves in flowing robes, bulky orcs in ill-fitting business attire, and creatures Kenji couldn't even begin to classify. The sheer scale of the Spire became even more apparent as they neared its base – it wasn't just a tower, it was a vertical city in itself, honeycombed with windows, balconies, and openings large enough for... well, dragons. Huge, arched entrances dotted its lower levels, figures moving in and out.

Their lift slowed, smoothly docking at a wide platform extending from the Spire about fifty stories above the city's main level. This platform bustled with activity. Creatures of all shapes and sizes hurried back and forth, clutching scrolls, slates, or satchels. The air hummed with purpose, a stark contrast to the relative quiet of the Annex.

""Welcome to the Locus,"" Grimgleam announced, hopping off the lift. ""Main entrance for most personnel. Security check.""

He led Kenji towards a pair of imposing guards flanking a massive archway. The guards weren't human. They were Golems, eight feet tall, crafted from obsidian and inlaid with glowing silver runes. Their faces were impassive masks, and they radiated an aura of immense, controlled power.

Grimgleam held up his Slate ID. One of the Golems lowered its head, its eyes glowing brighter as it scanned the stone. A soft chime echoed. Grimgleam gestured for Kenji to do the same.

Heart pounding slightly, Kenji held up his own warm slate. The Golem scanned it, its glowing eyes lingering on him for an extra second. Another chime, slightly different in tone. The Golem straightened, returning to its impassive stance.

""Probationary clearance granted,"" Grimgleam muttered. ""Means they won't atomize you on sight. Progress.""

They passed through the archway and into the Spire proper. The interior was even more staggering than the exterior. The entrance hall was a cavernous space, the ceiling lost in shadows hundreds of feet above. Pillars thick as ancient redwoods, carved with intricate draconic histories, supported the immense weight. The floor was polished obsidian, reflecting the light from massive, floating orbs of luminescence that drifted slowly through the upper reaches like captive suns.

The air thrummed with power, a low-level vibration that Kenji felt in his teeth. It smelled strongly of ozone, old stone, and something else... something rich and metallic, like a vast hoard of gold, mingled with the faint, unmistakable scent of brimstone.

Beings of incredible diversity moved through the hall. Kenji saw lizardfolk messengers scurrying with sealed tubes, groups of dwarves discussing structural integrity near a pillar base, lithe, cat-like figures conversing in hushed tones, and even, near the far end, a creature that looked remarkably like a walking, talking mushroom arguing with a goblin banker.

And then there were the dragons.

Not all were the colossal, winged beasts of legend, though Kenji glimpsed movement in the upper shadows that suggested truly immense forms resided higher up. Many here adopted smaller, bipedal forms, likely through magic. Some looked almost human, distinguished only by subtle scales around their eyes or temples, sharp canines, or eyes that glowed with inner fire. Others were more overtly draconic, with scaled skin, powerful tails, horns, and clawed hands, yet still walking upright, dressed in tailored robes or intricate armour that somehow managed to look like business attire. They moved with an innate authority, an ancient confidence that made everyone else subtly deferential.

Kenji felt incredibly small, incredibly human, incredibly out of his depth. This wasn't just a company; it was the nexus of power for an entire civilization built around beings of myth.

""Keep mouth shut, eyes open,"" Grimgleam hissed, tugging Kenji towards a smaller, less crowded corridor leading off the main hall. ""Your department is Sub-Basement Tetra. Portfolio Analysis, Emerging Markets Division. Sounds grander than it is. Mostly involves sifting through junk bonds issued by overly optimistic goblin tribes and assessing the long-term viability of magically enhanced turnip farming.""

""Magically enhanced turnips,"" Kenji repeated numbly. ""ROI potential?""

Grimgleam shot him a look. ""Surprisingly decent, if the Moon Weevils don't get them. But that's not your first assignment. First, you meet the boss.""

""The boss?"" Kenji asked, a knot of dread tightening in his stomach. ""You mean... Lord Valerius?""

""The very same,"" Grimgleam confirmed, his tone acquiring a new layer of dryness. ""Lord Valerius Ignis. Head of Western Range Acquisitions, Member of the Golden Conclave, Ancient Wyrm of the Emberslag Peaks, and your ultimate supervisor. Try not to spontaneously combust from terror. It reflects poorly on my orientation skills.""

They stopped before a set of truly enormous doors, crafted from some dark, reddish metal that seemed to absorb the light. They were easily thirty feet high, carved with a single, complex symbol – a dragon coiling around a mountain peak, breathing fire onto a pile of gold. Unlike the bustling corridors they'd left, this area was silent, deserted. The air here was noticeably warmer, carrying a distinct smell of sulphur and intense heat, like the inside of a forge.

Grimgleam took a deep breath, squaring his narrow shoulders. He rapped sharply on the colossal door with a clawed knuckle. The sound echoed unnervingly in the silence.

For a long moment, nothing happened. Kenji could feel sweat prickling on his forehead, despite the heat. Then, with a deep, grinding groan that vibrated through the stone floor, the massive doors began to swing inward, revealing not an office, but a cavern.

It was vast, far larger than seemed possible within the confines of the Spire. The ceiling was lost in swirling smoke and shadow, punctuated by the dull red glow of what looked like veins of magma running through the rock. The floor was uneven, natural stone, littered with... gold. Not just coins, but goblets, statues, jewellery, intricate artifacts, all piled in glittering drifts like golden snow. Gems the size of fists lay scattered amongst the treasure, catching the fiery light and throwing dazzling sparks. The heat radiating from the chamber was intense, making Kenji’s eyes water.

And in the center of the cavern, reclining comfortably on a mound of glittering wealth that would make Smaug look like a modest collector, was a dragon.

Not one of the bipedal, humanoid forms from the hall. This was the real deal. Colossal, ancient, terrifyingly magnificent. Scales the colour of cooling lava, edged with obsidian black, covered a body easily the size of Kenji’s old apartment building. Steam curled from its nostrils with each slow breath, and its eyes, vast, molten gold orbs with slitted pupils, fixed on them the moment the doors opened. They weren’t eyes that just saw; they assessed, weighed, and judged across millennia. A low rumble, like distant thunder or the shifting of tectonic plates, emanated from its chest.

Kenji froze, his brain short-circuiting somewhere between abject terror and sheer, dumbstruck awe. All thoughts of finance, spreadsheets, and amortization schedules evaporated.

Grimgleam nudged him hard in the ribs. ""Bow, you idiot! Deep bow!"" he hissed frantically under his breath.

Kenji stumbled into the lowest bow he could manage, pressing his forehead towards the stone floor, suddenly very aware of how fragile his human form felt. Grimgleam was similarly prostrated beside him.

The rumbling sound deepened, coalescing into speech. The voice wasn't just heard; it was felt, vibrating through Kenji's bones, echoing in the vast chamber. It was ancient, powerful, laced with the heat of the earth's core and the patience of mountains.

\*\*""Grimgleam. Report.""\*\*

Grimgleam kept his head bowed, his voice tight with deference. ""Lord Valerius. The new acquisition, Tanaka Kenji, as requested. Transferred from Realm designation... uh... 3B-7 Gamma, 'Earth'. Aptitudes verified. Preliminary integration complete.""

The vast golden eyes shifted, focusing entirely on Kenji. He felt the weight of that gaze like a physical pressure, pinning him to the floor. He could smell the sulphur intensifying, feel the heat prickle his skin even through the cloak.

\*\*""Tanaka Kenji. From the realm of... ephemeral corporations and fleeting digital wealth.""\*\* The voice was contemplative, each word resonating like a struck gong. \*\*""You traffic in concepts we measure in millennia. Tell me, human analyst... what is the Net Present Value of a mountain range held for ten thousand years, considering potential tectonic shifts, elemental resource depletion, and the fluctuating market value of terrified mortals?""\*\*

Kenji’s mind blanked. NPV? Of a mountain range? Over ten millennia? Discount rate? Risk assessment? What was the risk-free rate when dealing with actual gods and geological time scales? His carefully honed financial models seemed laughably inadequate, like trying to measure the ocean with a teaspoon.

He opened his mouth, then closed it again. What could he possibly say?

Lord Valerius chuckled, a sound like continents grinding together. Smoke plumed from his nostrils.

\*\*""Precisely. Your tools are... limited. Yet, you possess a certain... novelty. A different perspective on accumulation and worth. We shall see if it proves... profitable.""\*\*

The massive head lowered slightly, bringing one immense, molten eye closer. Kenji could see the intricate fractal patterns within the iris, feel the furnace heat radiating from the ancient being.

\*\*""Your predecessor attempted to apply 'Quarterly Growth Targets' to the egg-laying cycle of the Greater Moon Rocs,""\*\* the voice rumbled, a hint of dry amusement beneath the power. \*\*""He is now part of the decorative strata in the lower caverns. A cautionary footnote in the ledger. Do strive for a more... enduring tenure, Tanaka Kenji.""\*\*

Kenji swallowed hard, the sound loud in the sudden silence. His throat felt like sandpaper. ""I... I will endeavour to meet expectations, Lord Valerius."" The words came out as a shaky whisper.

\*\*""See that you do.""\*\* The great dragon shifted slightly on its hoard, sending cascades of gold and jewels slithering down the slopes. \*\*""Grimgleam. Take him to the Analysis Pits. Assign him the Kobold Creek Mining venture versus the Sunstone Elemental Weaving proposal. I wish to see his methodology. And perhaps... his capacity for survival.""\*\*

""At once, Lord Valerius,"" Grimgleam squeaked, already backing away, pulling Kenji with him. Kenji stumbled backwards, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground, not daring to look directly at the immense being again until the colossal doors groaned shut, sealing them back in the relative normalcy of the corridor.

Kenji leaned against the cool stone wall, his legs trembling. He could still feel the heat, smell the brimstone, hear the echo of that ancient voice in his bones.

Grimgleam straightened his jerkin, looking ruffled but relieved. ""Well,"" he rasped, wiping a bead of sweat from his parchment-like brow. ""You didn't spontaneously combust. Or get turned into a paperweight. Off to a flying start, human."" He offered a sharp-toothed grin that wasn't remotely comforting. ""Welcome to Ignis & Aurum Consolidated. Try not to get audited.""

1jl5r9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jl5r9m/ive_been_hired_to_assassinate_a_priest_only_after/,"I've Been Hired to Assassinate a Priest, Only after I Figure Out What He's Doing","I’d been watching John Ward since dawn.

He moved with the quiet ease of a man at peace, his black cassock flowing behind him as he walked the ancient streets of Vatican City. To anyone else, he was just another priest, one of many who lived within these sacred walls. But to me, he was a target.

I didn’t know who had hired me. That wasn’t unusual. What *was* unusual was the job itself.

The instructions had been simple—follow Ward, find out where he was going and why. Only then was I to end him. No details, no context. Just a name, a photograph, and a kill order with conditions.

It didn’t sit right.

Most of my marks had secrets, debts, blood on their hands. Politicians, criminals, men who had long since accepted the idea that death could come for them at any moment. But Ward? If the intel was right, he was clean. A priest without scandal, without enemies. So why the hit?

I kept my distance as I followed him through the city.

He started his day with a chapel service, kneeling at the altar like a man with nothing to hide. After that, he walked to a small café along Borgo Pio, ordered an espresso, and read his Bible in silence. No meetings. No whispers. No clandestine messages slipped into his hands.

Just a priest drinking coffee and reading scripture.

I stayed outside, blending into the ebb and flow of pedestrians. Watching. Waiting. Trying to find the thing that made him worth killing.

Nothing.

He finished his coffee, closed the Bible, and left a few coins on the table. Then he adjusted the strap on his leather bag and made his way toward the edge of Vatican City.

I followed.

Hours later, I watched him move through security at Fiumicino Airport, his one-way ticket to London in hand. I was already booked on the same flight.

Where was he going? Why?

And who wanted to make sure he never got there?

I exhaled, stepping forward to claim my own boarding pass. Whatever the answers were, I’d find them soon enough.

And then, John Ward would die.

I boarded the plane without issue, my ticket placing me just one row behind John Ward. The flight was full, the kind of suffocating crowd that made moving unnoticed both easier and more infuriating. As I settled into my seat, I realized my immediate surroundings were... less than ideal.

To my left, an obese man wheezed into existence, his body spilling over the armrest like rising dough. His shirt clung to him, dark patches of sweat spreading like continents on a map. The unmistakable stench of body odor hit me like a brick wall.

To my right, a baby, round-faced and already teetering on the edge of a meltdown, stared up at me with suspicious, watery eyes. Its mother was preoccupied, oblivious to the way her child sized me up like some kind of villain in a bedtime story.

I clenched my jaw and forced myself to ignore both.

Ward, however, sat in serene contemplation, his Bible open on the tray table before him. His lips moved slightly as he read, as though mouthing a prayer under his breath. His fingers absently traced the edges of the pages, lingering for a second longer than necessary before turning each one.

Hours passed.

The baby cried. The obese man sweat. I suffered.

But Ward barely moved. He was lost in that book, reading with such unwavering focus that I began to wonder if there was something more to it.

I caught a glimpse of the page he was on just before he turned it. The passage was familiar, though I couldn’t recall from where. Something about demons, a herd of swine, and drowning in a lake.

Then the page was gone, and I was left staring at the back of his head, my mind turning.

I knew the story. Jesus casting demons into pigs, sending them to their deaths. A strange choice for light reading on a flight to London.

What did it mean?

And why did I get the distinct feeling that whatever Ward was heading toward, it wasn’t just another church sermon?

I adjusted in my seat, sighing as the baby grabbed my sleeve with sticky fingers.

This job was getting weirder by the minute.

 

 

The flight was mercifully over.

I stretched my legs as I trailed John Ward through Heathrow, keeping a comfortable distance as we passed through customs. He moved with the same quiet confidence as before—no hesitation, no second-guessing. He wasn’t lost. He knew exactly where he was going.

And he wasn’t alone.

A man stood near the exit, holding a small placard with *J. Ward* scrawled across it in neat, precise letters. He was well-dressed—black suit, dark tie—but something about him seemed… off. Tension clung to his posture, his fingers tightening and releasing around the edges of the sign. The moment he spotted Ward, his entire body sagged with relief.

Whoever he was, he had been waiting.

Ward approached, and the man wasted no time in guiding him toward the exit. Outside, a sleek black car idled at the curb, the kind of vehicle that screamed *money* but not *too much money.*

I didn’t follow immediately. I didn’t need to.

A separate car had already been prepped for me, courtesy of my contacts in London. The moment Ward’s ride pulled away, I slid into my own vehicle—a nondescript grey sedan—and tailed them from a distance.

The drive took them into the heart of the city, weaving through traffic until they reached their destination. Westminster Cathedral.

Interesting choice.

I parked down the street, close enough to keep an eye on them without drawing attention to myself. Ward and his escort stepped out, lingering on the steps for a moment before disappearing inside.

I waited.

An hour passed. Then another.

Eventually, they re-emerged.

Even from a distance, I could see the difference in the man who had greeted Ward. His exhaustion hadn’t faded, but there was something else now—emotion thick in his expression. He wiped at his face, his shoulders trembling slightly. Not from fear.

From grief.

Ward said something to him. I couldn’t hear the words, but the meaning was clear enough. A reassuring hand on the man’s shoulder. A look of quiet understanding.

Then, without another word, Ward climbed back into the black car.

I exhaled, watching as the vehicle pulled away from the cathedral.

This wasn’t just a priest on a routine visit.

Something was happening here. Something big.

And I needed to find out what.

 

The drive was long. *Too* long.

Ward’s black car took winding road after winding road, weaving its way out of London, through the suburbs, then into the deep, rolling countryside. They weren’t rushing. There was no urgency in their pace—just a quiet, methodical journey to… wherever the hell we were going.

I had to refuel twice. The first time was uneventful. The second? Less so.

We both ended up at the same petrol station.

I kept my head down as I pumped fuel into the car, eyes flicking toward Ward as he stepped inside the station’s small shop. His driver stayed by the vehicle, leaning against the hood, looking just as tired as I felt.

I took my time, making sure not to draw attention as I watched him move through the aisles. He didn’t grab anything unusual—just a bottle of water and a packet of *Monster Munch*.

Of all things.

A priest, deeply invested in scripture, reading about demon-infested pigs drowning in a lake… and here he was, munching on crisps shaped like cartoonish monster claws.

It almost made me laugh. Almost.

I finished fueling up and got back in my car, waiting for them to leave first. A few minutes later, Ward and his driver pulled out, and I followed.

The roads became narrower, the streetlights fewer. The gentle glow of civilization faded behind us, replaced by the heavy black of the rural night. The deeper we went, the more I realized I had no idea where I was.

Wales, probably.

The twists and turns of the roads made it impossible to get a good read on the village’s name as we passed signs in the dark. Every time I tried to focus, I’d lose sight of the target for a second, forcing me to keep my attention on the car ahead instead.

Eventually, the vehicle slowed.

We had arrived.

A small village. A quiet one. No bright streetlights, no bustling nightlife. Just a few old houses, a church spire barely visible in the gloom, and the sound of the wind rolling over the hills.

I parked at a safe distance, turning off the engine.

Ward’s car came to a stop outside what looked like an old rectory. He stepped out, his silhouette framed by the dim glow of a single streetlamp.

For a moment, I just watched.

Eight hours of driving, and I was finally here.

Wherever *here* was.

I had to leave the car at the edge of the village.

It was too quiet here—too still. A new vehicle rolling in at this hour would be noticed, even by those who had nothing better to do than sit behind their curtains and watch the road. So I ditched it near an overgrown hedgerow and walked the rest of the way in.

The air smelled of damp earth and woodsmoke. The houses were old, clustered together in that haphazard way rural villages tended to be. A few dim porch lights flickered, but most of the windows were dark.

Then, in the distance, I spotted it—a pub. The only place still alive at this hour.

I adjusted my coat and ran a hand through my hair, ensuring I looked like any other traveler passing through. My civilian clothes were plain—jeans, a dark jumper, boots that had seen better days. Nothing flashy. Nothing that would stand out.

I stepped inside.

The warmth hit me first, followed by the murmur of conversation. The place was small, the kind of pub where everyone knew each other. A few heads turned as I entered, their eyes flicking over me in quiet evaluation before turning back to their drinks.

Good.

I moved to the bar, ordered a pint, and took a seat at the edge of the room, where I could watch without being obvious about it.

I sat in silence for a while, letting the low hum of voices wash over me.

Then, gradually, I struck up a conversation with an older man at the bar. Weathered face, heavy coat, eyes that had seen more than he’d probably admit. We talked about nothing at first—the road conditions, the unpredictability of Welsh weather, the usual.

Then, after a sip of his drink, he glanced at me and said, *“If you’re planning on sticking around, best avoid Tomson’s farm.”*

I raised a brow. “Why’s that?”

He hesitated, choosing his words carefully. *“Someone up there’s… not been well. Not for a long time.”*

I nodded, keeping my expression neutral.

He didn’t elaborate.

And I didn’t press.

But I had my lead.

The barmaid was wary, her eyes darting toward the older man when I asked about Tomson’s farm.

“A few miles out,” she muttered, drying a glass with slow, deliberate movements. “Down the main road, then left at the old chapel. Can’t miss it.”

I thanked her, finished my drink, and left the pub without another word.

The village behind me faded into silence as I walked. The only sound was the crunch of gravel underfoot and the occasional rustle of wind through the hedgerows. No streetlights, no passing cars—just the vast openness of the countryside stretching out in every direction.

It took nearly an hour to reach the farm.

I spotted the black car immediately.

It was parked just outside the main house, its silhouette barely visible in the faint moonlight. But something was wrong.

The doors were open. All of them. The driver’s side, the passenger’s side, even the rear. No lights, no movement. Just a hollow, empty vehicle sitting in the dark.

My instincts prickled.

I slowed my pace, scanning the area. The farmhouse loomed ahead, an old structure with thick stone walls and a sloping roof. No lights shone from the windows. No sound came from inside.

Where was Ward?

Where was his driver?

I crouched slightly, keeping to the shadows as I approached. My fingers brushed the grip of the knife hidden inside my coat.

Something wasn’t right.

Something had happened here.

And I was about to find out what.

 

I’d felt fear before—true, visceral fear. The kind that came when a job went sideways, when a gun jammed at the worst possible moment, when a man on the other end of the trigger wasn’t ready to die yet. But this?

This was different.

A deep, suffocating dread settled into my chest like a weight I couldn’t shake. Every instinct, every sharpened survival skill in my body screamed at me to turn around and leave. To get in my car, drive back to London, and forget any of this had ever happened.

But I wasn’t the kind of man who ran.

I took a slow breath and moved toward the black car first. If something had happened, I needed to know what.

The night was still—too still. No wind, no rustling trees, no distant hum of nocturnal life. Just silence.

I reached the vehicle, keeping low, my hand near the knife inside my coat. The open doors gaped like a carcass left to rot, and as I stepped closer, the smell hit me.

Not blood.

Not death.

Something *worse.*

I swallowed back the urge to recoil and peered inside.

The seats were empty, but the interior was in disarray. A Bible lay open on the backseat, pages creased like they had been gripped too hard. A half-eaten packet of Monster Munch had spilled onto the floor.

And then I saw it.

The driver’s seatbelt was still fastened.

But the driver was gone.

I took a step back, my pulse hammering in my ears.

Ward had come here willingly. But something else had met him.

And whatever it was… it hadn’t let them leave.

I exhaled slowly, forcing my nerves into submission. The dread still clung to me, a cold, unshakable thing that slithered down my spine. But fear was useless now.

I had a job to do.

Steeling myself, I moved toward the farmhouse. The heavy wooden door was slightly ajar, creaking softly as it swayed in the still night air. No light spilled from within, no welcoming warmth—only darkness and silence.

I pushed the door open with the back of my hand, my other gripping the knife inside my coat.

The moment I stepped inside, I knew something had gone *very* wrong.

The hallway was a mess. Furniture had been overturned, a wooden chair smashed into splinters near the entrance. An old side table lay on its side, its drawers pulled out and emptied onto the floor. Papers, books, and personal belongings were scattered in chaotic disarray.

There had been a struggle.

The air smelled of damp wood, old dust, and something faintly metallic. Not quite blood. Not quite decay. But something unnatural, something that made my instincts scream.

I stepped further in, moving carefully. The floorboards creaked under my weight, each sound too loud in the suffocating silence.

No bodies.

No signs of Ward.

But the deeper I went, the more I felt it—the same crushing, suffocating dread from before.

Something had happened here.

And I wasn’t alone.

The house was still, but not empty.

I could *feel* it.

The tension in the air was thick, pressing down on me like the weight of deep water. Every step I took up the narrow staircase felt like a mistake, but I kept going. My grip tightened around the knife hidden in my coat, knuckles whitening.

Then I heard it.

A noise—soft, distant, and completely *wrong.*

At first, I couldn’t place it. It was faint, barely cutting through the thick silence of the farmhouse. A low, wavering sound, almost like a breath… but not quite.

I froze. Listened.

And then it came again.

*Baaa.*

I blinked.

A sheep?

I stayed perfectly still, heart pounding, ears straining for another sound. The wind? The old house shifting? Some trick of my mind?

Then—again.

A slow, guttural, almost *wet* sounding *baa.*

The sound sent a wave of unease through me, my stomach knotting tight. It wasn’t coming from outside. It was coming from *upstairs.*

I swallowed, my throat dry, and forced myself to move forward.

Step by step, I climbed, each creak of the old wooden stairs a drumbeat against my nerves.

Whatever was waiting for me at the top…

It wasn’t going to be a sheep.

I should have left.

Every instinct, every finely honed survival skill I had told me that whatever was in this house wasn’t *right*. That the smart thing—the logical thing—was to turn around, get in my car, and drive as far from this godforsaken place as possible.

But I wasn’t hired to run.

I was hired to find out why John Ward had come here.

And that meant seeing this through.

I finished climbing the stairs, my ears still ringing with that sickly, drawn-out *baa*, but the second floor was… empty. Nothing waiting in the hallway. No shadow lurking in the dim light. Just more overturned furniture, more scattered belongings.

I exhaled slowly, pressing on.

I moved from room to room, checking for any sign of Ward or his driver, but found nothing—until I stepped back downstairs and into the living room.

Something was different here.

The space had the same chaos as the rest of the house—books thrown from shelves, cushions torn from the couch—but the coffee table in the center of the room was eerily… normal.

Two mugs sat there, still filled with dark liquid. Steam no longer rose from them, but they couldn’t have been more than an hour old. Someone had been here recently.

And they hadn’t left in a hurry.

Then I saw it.

A dossier.

It sat neatly beside one of the mugs, its dark cover stark against the old wooden table. It wasn’t thrown aside like everything else, wasn’t discarded in the panic of a struggle.

Someone had placed it here deliberately.

I hesitated for only a moment before stepping forward, scanning the room one last time. Nothing moved.

I crouched down, flipping open the folder with gloved fingers.

The first thing that caught my eye was a photograph.

John Ward.

Not a surprise—he was my target. But beneath it were documents, handwritten notes, some typed reports. I skimmed a page. Some of it was redacted, but words jumped out at me:

* *Exorcism attempt unsuccessful*
* *Subject unresponsive for 48 hours*
* *Secondary host?*
* *Containment compromised*

I frowned. This wasn’t normal church business.

I turned another page.

A map—hand-drawn, showing the farmhouse and the surrounding area. One location was marked in red ink. *Barn.*

A scrawl underneath it read: *DO NOT ENTER.*

I stared at the words for a long moment.

Then I heard the *baa* again.

This time, it was much closer.

A chill ran down my spine.

That sound—that wet, rattling *baa*—was closer now, but I forced myself to ignore it. My job was to gather information, and if Ward had come all this way for *this*, then it was worth knowing.

I turned another page.

The handwriting here was different—rougher, shakier. The ink bled in places, as if the writer’s hands had trembled while they wrote. The report was dated over a year ago, signed by the owner of the farm.

It started small.

*“At first, we thought nothing of it. Kids draw strange things all the time. But Alice—she wouldn’t stop. Every day, new pictures, always the same thing. A figure, tall and thin, standing among the sheep. She said it was her best friend. She said he lived in the sheep.”*

My grip on the folder tightened.

I skimmed further. The family had assumed it was just childhood imagination, a phase. But then she started *sleeping* in the barn.

*“We’d put her to bed, and every morning, we’d find her curled up in the hay. She wouldn’t say why. Just that he ‘liked it better when she stayed close.’”*

Her parents tried to stop her. Locked the barn. But she always found a way in.

Then, the livestock started acting strangely.

*“The flock wouldn’t go near the barn anymore. They stayed at the far end of the field, huddled together. Even the dog wouldn’t go near it.”*

The final entry was more frantic. The words scrawled as if written in a hurry, or panic.

*“The lambs were due in the spring. We waited, but when they came—none of them were alive. Not one. They were born twisted, wrong. We buried them, but Alice…”*

The writing trailed off, and I turned the page, heart hammering.

*“…Alice dug them back up.”*

The next part was smudged.

I could barely make out the words. Something about *whispering from the fields*. The girl talking to *things that weren’t there*.

And then—

I froze.

There was a final line, hastily underlined.

**“He says we can’t leave.”**

A sharp creak sounded from behind me.

I wasn’t alone anymore.

The weight of the dossier in my coat felt heavier than it should have.

I turned slowly, every muscle coiled, every instinct on high alert. And there, standing in the doorway, was **John Ward**.

He wore the same priestly attire, the same humble smile on his face. But something about him felt… *off*. His posture was too relaxed, too still. Like he was waiting for something.

We stared at each other in silence.

One second.

Two.

Thirty.

The air between us was thick, suffocating. My heartbeat hammered in my ears. I half expected him to lunge at me, to say something, to **do anything**—but he just stood there, smiling like we were two old friends sharing a quiet moment together.

Then, finally, he spoke.

*""Welcome to the abode.""*

His voice was calm. Warm, even. A voice meant to soothe, to reassure. It didn’t.

I swallowed my unease and nodded once. “Thanks.”

Then, keeping my tone light, I added, “But I was just leaving.”

Ward didn’t move.

The smile didn’t falter.

He just… stood there, blocking the only exit.

I let out a slow breath. “Would you mind stepping aside?”

Nothing. No reaction. Just the same calm, patient expression.

I sighed, already reaching for the pistol holstered inside my coat.

I didn’t want to kill a priest—not tonight, at least. But if he wasn’t going to move, I’d have to make him.

I drew the gun smoothly, raising it to his forehead in one fluid motion. “Last chance, Padre.”

I was already lining up a snarky comment, something about holy men and bad manners—when I made the mistake of looking him in the eyes.

And that’s when I realized.

**They weren’t human.**

My grip on the gun tightened.

The eyes staring back at me weren’t the soft, weathered eyes of a man who had seen too much of the world’s suffering. They weren’t even eyes at all.

They were *voids.*

**Endless, black voids.**

Deep, hungry, and shifting, like something was writhing just beneath the surface. Something *alive.*

And for the first time in my life—

I felt **true terror.**

I didn’t hesitate.

The moment I saw those *things* writhing in Ward’s eyes, I pulled the trigger.

The gunshot roared through the house, deafening in the silence.

The bullet hit dead center, snapping his head back. For a second, he just stood there, as if the shot hadn’t registered. Then, his body slumped to the floor like a puppet with its strings cut.

I exhaled sharply, heart pounding.

The darkness in his eyes… was gone.

Whatever had been inside him had left.

I didn’t stick around to find out where it had gone.

Tucking the gun away, I turned and strode toward the door. I was done here. I didn’t care about the mission anymore, didn’t care who had hired me or why. Whatever was happening in this place was **far** above my pay grade.

The black car sat waiting just outside.

I yanked the driver’s side door open, ready to get the hell out of this cursed village—only to find the ignition empty.

No keys.

Frowning, I checked the glove compartment. The cup holders. The floor. Nothing.

I swore under my breath and turned back toward the house. Ward didn’t have time to hide them—he must’ve had them on him.

I crouched beside his body, rifling through his pockets. Still warm. The smell of gunpowder lingered in the air. My fingers brushed over rosary beads, a folded note, a vial of something thick and dark… but no keys.

I sat back on my heels, exhaling sharply. “For fu—”

Movement.

From the corner of my eye, I saw something **shift**.

I snapped my head up just in time to see a shape slipping into the **barn**.

I froze.

It wasn’t Ward.

It wasn’t the driver.

It was **something else.**

I should have left.

I should have walked away, disappeared into the night, and never looked back.

But I didn’t.

Because some deep, gnawing part of me—some reckless, **curious** part—wanted to **know**.

Before I could stop myself, I was moving.

Gun drawn.

Steps slow and measured.

Following the shape into the dark.

The barn was dark.

The only light came from the car’s headlights, thin beams slipping through the gaps in the wooden boards. Dust swirled in the air, catching faintly in the glow, and the smell—**God, the smell**—was thick with copper and rot.

I stepped inside, gun raised, breath shallow.

The moment my eyes adjusted, my stomach twisted.

The **entire** family hung from the rafters.

The father. The mother. Two sons. And the driver.

Their bodies had been gutted, strung up in mock crucifixion. Arms outstretched, heads slumped forward, entrails dangling like grotesque ornaments. Blood had soaked into the straw below them, forming thick, black puddles in the dim light.

Flies buzzed in frantic circles, feasting.

The driver—who had picked up Ward from the airport—was hung the highest, his face twisted in an expression of frozen agony. His ribs were cracked open, his heart missing.

I swallowed hard, forcing down the bile rising in my throat.

Then I noticed the **absence**.

The girl. **Alice.**

She wasn’t here.

My grip on the gun tightened.

A noise—soft, shuffling—came from the back of the barn.

I turned sharply, gun aimed, breath hitching.

The shadows there were deeper. The car’s headlights didn’t reach that far, leaving only blackness between the wooden stalls.

Something **was there**.

I could feel it.

Watching me.

Waiting.

I forced my voice to stay steady. “Alice?”

Silence.

Then—

A wet, drawn-out **baa** echoed from the darkness.

Low. Rumbling. **Wrong.**

My blood ran cold.

At first, I thought it was just a sheep.

The soft padding of hooves. The shape stepping cautiously into the light. My heart slammed against my ribs, but when my eyes fully registered the creature in front of me, I felt the faintest sigh of relief.

Just a sheep.

Just a goddamn sheep.

I exhaled sharply, lowering the gun a fraction.

And then—it *moved*.

Not like an animal. Not like anything natural.

Its head **rose**.

Higher.

And higher.

My breath hitched as the thing’s neck stretched **impossibly** long, vertebrae popping like the cracking of knuckles. Its skull scraped the rafters, tendons creaking under its own weight. I watched in frozen horror as **more** stepped into the light—except they weren’t more.

They were **one**.

A single, writhing **mass** of sheep, their bodies twisted and fused together like something stitched from a nightmare. Their legs bent in the wrong places, fur matted with blood and filth, mouths twitching—some moving soundlessly, others *screaming*.

I took a step back, my boots sticking slightly to the blood-soaked straw.

And then I saw her.

**Alice.**

Her body was **part of it**.

Her small form tangled in the shifting horror, limbs distended, her face peeking through the mass of writhing wool and flesh. Her mouth stretched wide in a silent wail, her eyes blank—**but she was still alive**.

Somehow.

A high-pitched, warbling **baa** echoed from deep within the thing, rolling through the barn like a death rattle.

The thing **stepped forward**.

The barn **shook** with the weight of it, the wooden boards groaning beneath its shifting mass. The wet stink of blood and damp wool filled my nostrils, choking me.

I didn’t think. I just **fired**.

The first shot hit center mass—if this thing even **had** a center. The second tore through a tangle of fused limbs, splintering bone and spraying something thick and **black** against the straw.

It **screamed**.

The sound was a grotesque mix of guttural baaing and **a child’s voice, sobbing for help**.

*""Please!""*

I kept **shooting**.

Each bullet sent tremors through the thing’s mass, causing it to **recoil**, but it **didn’t stop moving**. The wounds **didn’t close**, but they didn’t slow it down either.

I emptied the clip.

Click.

Click.

**Click.**

Still, it loomed.

Still, **Alice cried out from within it**.

*""It hurts!""* she sobbed, her voice thin and warbling, merging with the tortured bleats of the flock. *""Make it stop!""*

My hands were shaking. My mind was screaming at me to **run**.

 

I ran.

I ran like hell.

Boots pounding against the blood-soaked straw, lungs burning, my mind screaming at my body to **move faster**. The thing behind me **laughed**—a horrible, garbled mix of sheep’s bleats and a child’s sobs, warping into a **low, wet chuckle** that slithered down my spine.

The moment I cleared the barn doors, I sprinted for the car.

But the **thing was fast**.

Too fast.

A skittering, **chittering** sound filled the air as it **burst from the barn**, its dozens of twisted, malformed legs hitting the ground like the cracking of snapping bones. The way it **moved**—shifting, lurching, but with horrifying **precision**—made my stomach lurch.

It was **playing with me**.

I had seconds to react.

The thing **cut me off**, its massive, heaving form sliding into place between me and the car. I barely had time to shift direction, throwing my body down and **sliding beneath the car**.

My coat snagged on the undercarriage, but I ripped free, scrambling out the other side. My heart pounded as I **sprinted for the house**, my boots slamming against the mud-slick ground.

*The keys. The bodies.*

I hadn’t checked them. **Maybe I still had a chance maybe I missed the keys on Wards body.**

I reached the doorway, my hands shaking as I tore at Ward’s body.

Nothing. **Nothing.**

Rosary beads. That same folded note. But then—

My fingers brushed metal.

I pulled free **a silver cross**.

Not a cheap one. Not some meaningless trinket. It was **heavy**. Ornate. This was something **old**, something **powerful**.

Behind me, the sound of **splintering wood** erupted as the **creature crashed into the house.**

I turned **just in time** to see it **charging**.

I had no plan. No time to think.

I just **lifted the cross**.

The thing **froze**.

Fifty **unblinking** eyes locked onto the silver.

For a second—just a second—I thought it worked.

Then… it **smiled**.

Every single face.

Grinning.

Teeth too human. Too wide.

And then—**all of them** turned their eyes toward me.

I stood there, frozen, as one of its many malformed limbs **reached forward**.

Slow. **Deliberate.**

It didn’t **snatch** the cross.

It didn’t **rip it from my hands**.

It **gently** took it.

Turned it.

**Flipped it upside down.**

And **placed it back into my palm.**

The room **spun**.

The thing chuckled—**low, knowing, amused**—before it **rose up**, towering over me.

The cross felt **heavier** now.

And I realized something far worse.

The priest had been a good man. **An innocent man.**

And **even he** couldn’t stop this.

The baas grew **louder**.

Louder than anything I had ever heard in my life.

It wasn’t just **sound**—it was force. It crashed over me like a tidal wave, reverberating in my skull, **drilling into my bones**. My knees buckled, my hands **slammed** against my ears, but it did nothing to stop the noise.

The walls of the house **shook**. The air felt **thick**, pressing in from all sides, suffocating, crushing.

Then—

It **spoke**.

A voice beneath the chorus of wailing sheep.

Deep. Ancient. *Wrong.*

*""Nid yw totemau truenus yn gweithio ar yr un sy’n cysgu o dan y derw.""*

I didn’t understand the words, but I **felt** them. They slithered through my mind like worms burrowing into the folds of my brain.

*""Am droseddau yn erbyn y wlad yr wyf wedi hawlio’r plâu hyn yn offrymau.""*

My vision **blurred**.

*""Gwelwch fod eich perthynas yn gwrando ar y rhybudd hwn.""*

The floor **tilted** beneath me.

And then—**it moved.**

The **mass** of it. The sheer **weight** of the thing **rushed forward**, enveloping me in a tangle of damp wool and **suffocating heat**.

The stench of rot and sweat filled my lungs.

Thick, gnarled limbs **coiled around me**, squeezing.

Tighter.

Tighter.

My ribs **groaned** under the pressure. My veins screamed as my blood struggled to move. My mind **fought** to stay conscious, but the weight—the impossible, unholy **weight**—dragged me under.

The last thing I heard before the darkness took me was **laughter**.

Low. Amused.

**Knowing.**

I woke up with a jolt, gasping for air.

Everything was **wrong**.

The sky outside the window was too bright, too clear. The hum of the plane beneath me was mechanical, but the sound felt distant—like I was underwater.

I rubbed my eyes, trying to clear the fog in my brain. My head was pounding like someone had taken a sledgehammer to it, and my mouth tasted like ashes. I was **disoriented**—too disoriented.

I looked around.

The seats were plush, **first class**. The lights above were dimmed. No one was talking. No one was **looking at me**.

It had to be a dream, right? It had to.

The barn. The creature. The **family**. The cross.

**It couldn’t have been real.**

But then I looked down at my hand.

The cross was still there.

It was **warm**.

And **heavy**.

I felt my chest tighten, my breathing turning ragged. **It was real**. It had all been real. The creature, the barn, the priest—**everything**. I was still alive. I didn’t know how, but I was **alive**.

A hand on my shoulder. A soft voice.

""Sir, are you alright?""

I turned to see a flight attendant standing beside me, concern on her face.

""Where... where are we headed?"" I forced the words out, my mouth dry, throat tight.

""Vatican City, sir.""

The words hit me like a slap.

I stood, my hands shaking. I had to clear my head. I had to get out of this seat.

I stumbled toward the restroom. The cool metal of the door felt grounding against my fingers as I pushed it open. The flickering fluorescent lights above made everything seem too surreal. I stepped in front of the sink, splashing cold water on my face, trying to fight the panic that was rising in my chest.

It didn’t work.

I stared at myself in the mirror, eyes wide, hands pressed against the cold metal.

And then—

I blinked.

Twice.

Just **briefly**—a second, maybe less.

But in the reflection, I saw something I wasn’t supposed to see.

**My eyes.**

For the briefest moment, I could swear that I saw them—those rectangular pupils—wide and **slit**, like something **not human**.

My heart **stopped**.

I stared at myself, unable to breathe, unable to process the **horror** clawing at my chest.

And then—

The reflection **smiled**.

I didn’t.

The bathroom door clicked open behind me, but I didn’t turn around. I couldn’t.

The story was over.

But something inside me **knew**—

It wasn’t over for me.

Not by a long shot.

And I wasn’t the **same** anymore.

1jl5q28,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturesTemper/comments/1jl5q28/the_priests_assassin/,The Priests Assassin,"I’d been watching John Ward since dawn.

He moved with the quiet ease of a man at peace, his black cassock flowing behind him as he walked the ancient streets of Vatican City. To anyone else, he was just another priest, one of many who lived within these sacred walls. But to me, he was a target.

I didn’t know who had hired me. That wasn’t unusual. What *was* unusual was the job itself.

The instructions had been simple—follow Ward, find out where he was going and why. Only then was I to end him. No details, no context. Just a name, a photograph, and a kill order with conditions.

It didn’t sit right.

Most of my marks had secrets, debts, blood on their hands. Politicians, criminals, men who had long since accepted the idea that death could come for them at any moment. But Ward? If the intel was right, he was clean. A priest without scandal, without enemies. So why the hit?

I kept my distance as I followed him through the city.

He started his day with a chapel service, kneeling at the altar like a man with nothing to hide. After that, he walked to a small café along Borgo Pio, ordered an espresso, and read his Bible in silence. No meetings. No whispers. No clandestine messages slipped into his hands.

Just a priest drinking coffee and reading scripture.

I stayed outside, blending into the ebb and flow of pedestrians. Watching. Waiting. Trying to find the thing that made him worth killing.

Nothing.

He finished his coffee, closed the Bible, and left a few coins on the table. Then he adjusted the strap on his leather bag and made his way toward the edge of Vatican City.

I followed.

Hours later, I watched him move through security at Fiumicino Airport, his one-way ticket to London in hand. I was already booked on the same flight.

Where was he going? Why?

And who wanted to make sure he never got there?

I exhaled, stepping forward to claim my own boarding pass. Whatever the answers were, I’d find them soon enough.

And then, John Ward would die.

I boarded the plane without issue, my ticket placing me just one row behind John Ward. The flight was full, the kind of suffocating crowd that made moving unnoticed both easier and more infuriating. As I settled into my seat, I realized my immediate surroundings were... less than ideal.

To my left, an obese man wheezed into existence, his body spilling over the armrest like rising dough. His shirt clung to him, dark patches of sweat spreading like continents on a map. The unmistakable stench of body odor hit me like a brick wall.

To my right, a baby, round-faced and already teetering on the edge of a meltdown, stared up at me with suspicious, watery eyes. Its mother was preoccupied, oblivious to the way her child sized me up like some kind of villain in a bedtime story.

I clenched my jaw and forced myself to ignore both.

Ward, however, sat in serene contemplation, his Bible open on the tray table before him. His lips moved slightly as he read, as though mouthing a prayer under his breath. His fingers absently traced the edges of the pages, lingering for a second longer than necessary before turning each one.

Hours passed.

The baby cried. The obese man sweat. I suffered.

But Ward barely moved. He was lost in that book, reading with such unwavering focus that I began to wonder if there was something more to it.

I caught a glimpse of the page he was on just before he turned it. The passage was familiar, though I couldn’t recall from where. Something about demons, a herd of swine, and drowning in a lake.

Then the page was gone, and I was left staring at the back of his head, my mind turning.

I knew the story. Jesus casting demons into pigs, sending them to their deaths. A strange choice for light reading on a flight to London.

What did it mean?

And why did I get the distinct feeling that whatever Ward was heading toward, it wasn’t just another church sermon?

I adjusted in my seat, sighing as the baby grabbed my sleeve with sticky fingers.

This job was getting weirder by the minute.

 

 

The flight was mercifully over.

I stretched my legs as I trailed John Ward through Heathrow, keeping a comfortable distance as we passed through customs. He moved with the same quiet confidence as before—no hesitation, no second-guessing. He wasn’t lost. He knew exactly where he was going.

And he wasn’t alone.

A man stood near the exit, holding a small placard with *J. Ward* scrawled across it in neat, precise letters. He was well-dressed—black suit, dark tie—but something about him seemed… off. Tension clung to his posture, his fingers tightening and releasing around the edges of the sign. The moment he spotted Ward, his entire body sagged with relief.

Whoever he was, he had been waiting.

Ward approached, and the man wasted no time in guiding him toward the exit. Outside, a sleek black car idled at the curb, the kind of vehicle that screamed *money* but not *too much money.*

I didn’t follow immediately. I didn’t need to.

A separate car had already been prepped for me, courtesy of my contacts in London. The moment Ward’s ride pulled away, I slid into my own vehicle—a nondescript grey sedan—and tailed them from a distance.

The drive took them into the heart of the city, weaving through traffic until they reached their destination. Westminster Cathedral.

Interesting choice.

I parked down the street, close enough to keep an eye on them without drawing attention to myself. Ward and his escort stepped out, lingering on the steps for a moment before disappearing inside.

I waited.

An hour passed. Then another.

Eventually, they re-emerged.

Even from a distance, I could see the difference in the man who had greeted Ward. His exhaustion hadn’t faded, but there was something else now—emotion thick in his expression. He wiped at his face, his shoulders trembling slightly. Not from fear.

From grief.

Ward said something to him. I couldn’t hear the words, but the meaning was clear enough. A reassuring hand on the man’s shoulder. A look of quiet understanding.

Then, without another word, Ward climbed back into the black car.

I exhaled, watching as the vehicle pulled away from the cathedral.

This wasn’t just a priest on a routine visit.

Something was happening here. Something big.

And I needed to find out what.

 

The drive was long. *Too* long.

Ward’s black car took winding road after winding road, weaving its way out of London, through the suburbs, then into the deep, rolling countryside. They weren’t rushing. There was no urgency in their pace—just a quiet, methodical journey to… wherever the hell we were going.

I had to refuel twice. The first time was uneventful. The second? Less so.

We both ended up at the same petrol station.

I kept my head down as I pumped fuel into the car, eyes flicking toward Ward as he stepped inside the station’s small shop. His driver stayed by the vehicle, leaning against the hood, looking just as tired as I felt.

I took my time, making sure not to draw attention as I watched him move through the aisles. He didn’t grab anything unusual—just a bottle of water and a packet of *Monster Munch*.

Of all things.

A priest, deeply invested in scripture, reading about demon-infested pigs drowning in a lake… and here he was, munching on crisps shaped like cartoonish monster claws.

It almost made me laugh. Almost.

I finished fueling up and got back in my car, waiting for them to leave first. A few minutes later, Ward and his driver pulled out, and I followed.

The roads became narrower, the streetlights fewer. The gentle glow of civilization faded behind us, replaced by the heavy black of the rural night. The deeper we went, the more I realized I had no idea where I was.

Wales, probably.

The twists and turns of the roads made it impossible to get a good read on the village’s name as we passed signs in the dark. Every time I tried to focus, I’d lose sight of the target for a second, forcing me to keep my attention on the car ahead instead.

Eventually, the vehicle slowed.

We had arrived.

A small village. A quiet one. No bright streetlights, no bustling nightlife. Just a few old houses, a church spire barely visible in the gloom, and the sound of the wind rolling over the hills.

I parked at a safe distance, turning off the engine.

Ward’s car came to a stop outside what looked like an old rectory. He stepped out, his silhouette framed by the dim glow of a single streetlamp.

For a moment, I just watched.

Eight hours of driving, and I was finally here.

Wherever *here* was.

I had to leave the car at the edge of the village.

It was too quiet here—too still. A new vehicle rolling in at this hour would be noticed, even by those who had nothing better to do than sit behind their curtains and watch the road. So I ditched it near an overgrown hedgerow and walked the rest of the way in.

The air smelled of damp earth and woodsmoke. The houses were old, clustered together in that haphazard way rural villages tended to be. A few dim porch lights flickered, but most of the windows were dark.

Then, in the distance, I spotted it—a pub. The only place still alive at this hour.

I adjusted my coat and ran a hand through my hair, ensuring I looked like any other traveler passing through. My civilian clothes were plain—jeans, a dark jumper, boots that had seen better days. Nothing flashy. Nothing that would stand out.

I stepped inside.

The warmth hit me first, followed by the murmur of conversation. The place was small, the kind of pub where everyone knew each other. A few heads turned as I entered, their eyes flicking over me in quiet evaluation before turning back to their drinks.

Good.

I moved to the bar, ordered a pint, and took a seat at the edge of the room, where I could watch without being obvious about it.

I sat in silence for a while, letting the low hum of voices wash over me.

Then, gradually, I struck up a conversation with an older man at the bar. Weathered face, heavy coat, eyes that had seen more than he’d probably admit. We talked about nothing at first—the road conditions, the unpredictability of Welsh weather, the usual.

Then, after a sip of his drink, he glanced at me and said, *“If you’re planning on sticking around, best avoid Tomson’s farm.”*

I raised a brow. “Why’s that?”

He hesitated, choosing his words carefully. *“Someone up there’s… not been well. Not for a long time.”*

I nodded, keeping my expression neutral.

He didn’t elaborate.

And I didn’t press.

But I had my lead.

The barmaid was wary, her eyes darting toward the older man when I asked about Tomson’s farm.

“A few miles out,” she muttered, drying a glass with slow, deliberate movements. “Down the main road, then left at the old chapel. Can’t miss it.”

I thanked her, finished my drink, and left the pub without another word.

The village behind me faded into silence as I walked. The only sound was the crunch of gravel underfoot and the occasional rustle of wind through the hedgerows. No streetlights, no passing cars—just the vast openness of the countryside stretching out in every direction.

It took nearly an hour to reach the farm.

I spotted the black car immediately.

It was parked just outside the main house, its silhouette barely visible in the faint moonlight. But something was wrong.

The doors were open. All of them. The driver’s side, the passenger’s side, even the rear. No lights, no movement. Just a hollow, empty vehicle sitting in the dark.

My instincts prickled.

I slowed my pace, scanning the area. The farmhouse loomed ahead, an old structure with thick stone walls and a sloping roof. No lights shone from the windows. No sound came from inside.

Where was Ward?

Where was his driver?

I crouched slightly, keeping to the shadows as I approached. My fingers brushed the grip of the knife hidden inside my coat.

Something wasn’t right.

Something had happened here.

And I was about to find out what.

 

I’d felt fear before—true, visceral fear. The kind that came when a job went sideways, when a gun jammed at the worst possible moment, when a man on the other end of the trigger wasn’t ready to die yet. But this?

This was different.

A deep, suffocating dread settled into my chest like a weight I couldn’t shake. Every instinct, every sharpened survival skill in my body screamed at me to turn around and leave. To get in my car, drive back to London, and forget any of this had ever happened.

But I wasn’t the kind of man who ran.

I took a slow breath and moved toward the black car first. If something had happened, I needed to know what.

The night was still—too still. No wind, no rustling trees, no distant hum of nocturnal life. Just silence.

I reached the vehicle, keeping low, my hand near the knife inside my coat. The open doors gaped like a carcass left to rot, and as I stepped closer, the smell hit me.

Not blood.

Not death.

Something *worse.*

I swallowed back the urge to recoil and peered inside.

The seats were empty, but the interior was in disarray. A Bible lay open on the backseat, pages creased like they had been gripped too hard. A half-eaten packet of Monster Munch had spilled onto the floor.

And then I saw it.

The driver’s seatbelt was still fastened.

But the driver was gone.

I took a step back, my pulse hammering in my ears.

Ward had come here willingly. But something else had met him.

And whatever it was… it hadn’t let them leave.

I exhaled slowly, forcing my nerves into submission. The dread still clung to me, a cold, unshakable thing that slithered down my spine. But fear was useless now.

I had a job to do.

Steeling myself, I moved toward the farmhouse. The heavy wooden door was slightly ajar, creaking softly as it swayed in the still night air. No light spilled from within, no welcoming warmth—only darkness and silence.

I pushed the door open with the back of my hand, my other gripping the knife inside my coat.

The moment I stepped inside, I knew something had gone *very* wrong.

The hallway was a mess. Furniture had been overturned, a wooden chair smashed into splinters near the entrance. An old side table lay on its side, its drawers pulled out and emptied onto the floor. Papers, books, and personal belongings were scattered in chaotic disarray.

There had been a struggle.

The air smelled of damp wood, old dust, and something faintly metallic. Not quite blood. Not quite decay. But something unnatural, something that made my instincts scream.

I stepped further in, moving carefully. The floorboards creaked under my weight, each sound too loud in the suffocating silence.

No bodies.

No signs of Ward.

But the deeper I went, the more I felt it—the same crushing, suffocating dread from before.

Something had happened here.

And I wasn’t alone.

The house was still, but not empty.

I could *feel* it.

The tension in the air was thick, pressing down on me like the weight of deep water. Every step I took up the narrow staircase felt like a mistake, but I kept going. My grip tightened around the knife hidden in my coat, knuckles whitening.

Then I heard it.

A noise—soft, distant, and completely *wrong.*

At first, I couldn’t place it. It was faint, barely cutting through the thick silence of the farmhouse. A low, wavering sound, almost like a breath… but not quite.

I froze. Listened.

And then it came again.

*Baaa.*

I blinked.

A sheep?

I stayed perfectly still, heart pounding, ears straining for another sound. The wind? The old house shifting? Some trick of my mind?

Then—again.

A slow, guttural, almost *wet* sounding *baa.*

The sound sent a wave of unease through me, my stomach knotting tight. It wasn’t coming from outside. It was coming from *upstairs.*

I swallowed, my throat dry, and forced myself to move forward.

Step by step, I climbed, each creak of the old wooden stairs a drumbeat against my nerves.

Whatever was waiting for me at the top…

It wasn’t going to be a sheep.

I should have left.

Every instinct, every finely honed survival skill I had told me that whatever was in this house wasn’t *right*. That the smart thing—the logical thing—was to turn around, get in my car, and drive as far from this godforsaken place as possible.

But I wasn’t hired to run.

I was hired to find out why John Ward had come here.

And that meant seeing this through.

I finished climbing the stairs, my ears still ringing with that sickly, drawn-out *baa*, but the second floor was… empty. Nothing waiting in the hallway. No shadow lurking in the dim light. Just more overturned furniture, more scattered belongings.

I exhaled slowly, pressing on.

I moved from room to room, checking for any sign of Ward or his driver, but found nothing—until I stepped back downstairs and into the living room.

Something was different here.

The space had the same chaos as the rest of the house—books thrown from shelves, cushions torn from the couch—but the coffee table in the center of the room was eerily… normal.

Two mugs sat there, still filled with dark liquid. Steam no longer rose from them, but they couldn’t have been more than an hour old. Someone had been here recently.

And they hadn’t left in a hurry.

Then I saw it.

A dossier.

It sat neatly beside one of the mugs, its dark cover stark against the old wooden table. It wasn’t thrown aside like everything else, wasn’t discarded in the panic of a struggle.

Someone had placed it here deliberately.

I hesitated for only a moment before stepping forward, scanning the room one last time. Nothing moved.

I crouched down, flipping open the folder with gloved fingers.

The first thing that caught my eye was a photograph.

John Ward.

Not a surprise—he was my target. But beneath it were documents, handwritten notes, some typed reports. I skimmed a page. Some of it was redacted, but words jumped out at me:

* *Exorcism attempt unsuccessful*
* *Subject unresponsive for 48 hours*
* *Secondary host?*
* *Containment compromised*

I frowned. This wasn’t normal church business.

I turned another page.

A map—hand-drawn, showing the farmhouse and the surrounding area. One location was marked in red ink. *Barn.*

A scrawl underneath it read: *DO NOT ENTER.*

I stared at the words for a long moment.

Then I heard the *baa* again.

This time, it was much closer.

A chill ran down my spine.

That sound—that wet, rattling *baa*—was closer now, but I forced myself to ignore it. My job was to gather information, and if Ward had come all this way for *this*, then it was worth knowing.

I turned another page.

The handwriting here was different—rougher, shakier. The ink bled in places, as if the writer’s hands had trembled while they wrote. The report was dated over a year ago, signed by the owner of the farm.

It started small.

*“At first, we thought nothing of it. Kids draw strange things all the time. But Alice—she wouldn’t stop. Every day, new pictures, always the same thing. A figure, tall and thin, standing among the sheep. She said it was her best friend. She said he lived in the sheep.”*

My grip on the folder tightened.

I skimmed further. The family had assumed it was just childhood imagination, a phase. But then she started *sleeping* in the barn.

*“We’d put her to bed, and every morning, we’d find her curled up in the hay. She wouldn’t say why. Just that he ‘liked it better when she stayed close.’”*

Her parents tried to stop her. Locked the barn. But she always found a way in.

Then, the livestock started acting strangely.

*“The flock wouldn’t go near the barn anymore. They stayed at the far end of the field, huddled together. Even the dog wouldn’t go near it.”*

The final entry was more frantic. The words scrawled as if written in a hurry, or panic.

*“The lambs were due in the spring. We waited, but when they came—none of them were alive. Not one. They were born twisted, wrong. We buried them, but Alice…”*

The writing trailed off, and I turned the page, heart hammering.

*“…Alice dug them back up.”*

The next part was smudged.

I could barely make out the words. Something about *whispering from the fields*. The girl talking to *things that weren’t there*.

And then—

I froze.

There was a final line, hastily underlined.

**“He says we can’t leave.”**

A sharp creak sounded from behind me.

I wasn’t alone anymore.

The weight of the dossier in my coat felt heavier than it should have.

I turned slowly, every muscle coiled, every instinct on high alert. And there, standing in the doorway, was **John Ward**.

He wore the same priestly attire, the same humble smile on his face. But something about him felt… *off*. His posture was too relaxed, too still. Like he was waiting for something.

We stared at each other in silence.

One second.

Two.

Thirty.

The air between us was thick, suffocating. My heartbeat hammered in my ears. I half expected him to lunge at me, to say something, to **do anything**—but he just stood there, smiling like we were two old friends sharing a quiet moment together.

Then, finally, he spoke.

*""Welcome to the abode.""*

His voice was calm. Warm, even. A voice meant to soothe, to reassure. It didn’t.

I swallowed my unease and nodded once. “Thanks.”

Then, keeping my tone light, I added, “But I was just leaving.”

Ward didn’t move.

The smile didn’t falter.

He just… stood there, blocking the only exit.

I let out a slow breath. “Would you mind stepping aside?”

Nothing. No reaction. Just the same calm, patient expression.

I sighed, already reaching for the pistol holstered inside my coat.

I didn’t want to kill a priest—not tonight, at least. But if he wasn’t going to move, I’d have to make him.

I drew the gun smoothly, raising it to his forehead in one fluid motion. “Last chance, Padre.”

I was already lining up a snarky comment, something about holy men and bad manners—when I made the mistake of looking him in the eyes.

And that’s when I realized.

**They weren’t human.**

My grip on the gun tightened.

The eyes staring back at me weren’t the soft, weathered eyes of a man who had seen too much of the world’s suffering. They weren’t even eyes at all.

They were *voids.*

**Endless, black voids.**

Deep, hungry, and shifting, like something was writhing just beneath the surface. Something *alive.*

And for the first time in my life—

I felt **true terror.**

I didn’t hesitate.

The moment I saw those *things* writhing in Ward’s eyes, I pulled the trigger.

The gunshot roared through the house, deafening in the silence.

The bullet hit dead center, snapping his head back. For a second, he just stood there, as if the shot hadn’t registered. Then, his body slumped to the floor like a puppet with its strings cut.

I exhaled sharply, heart pounding.

The darkness in his eyes… was gone.

Whatever had been inside him had left.

I didn’t stick around to find out where it had gone.

Tucking the gun away, I turned and strode toward the door. I was done here. I didn’t care about the mission anymore, didn’t care who had hired me or why. Whatever was happening in this place was **far** above my pay grade.

The black car sat waiting just outside.

I yanked the driver’s side door open, ready to get the hell out of this cursed village—only to find the ignition empty.

No keys.

Frowning, I checked the glove compartment. The cup holders. The floor. Nothing.

I swore under my breath and turned back toward the house. Ward didn’t have time to hide them—he must’ve had them on him.

I crouched beside his body, rifling through his pockets. Still warm. The smell of gunpowder lingered in the air. My fingers brushed over rosary beads, a folded note, a vial of something thick and dark… but no keys.

I sat back on my heels, exhaling sharply. “For fu—”

Movement.

From the corner of my eye, I saw something **shift**.

I snapped my head up just in time to see a shape slipping into the **barn**.

I froze.

It wasn’t Ward.

It wasn’t the driver.

It was **something else.**

I should have left.

I should have walked away, disappeared into the night, and never looked back.

But I didn’t.

Because some deep, gnawing part of me—some reckless, **curious** part—wanted to **know**.

Before I could stop myself, I was moving.

Gun drawn.

Steps slow and measured.

Following the shape into the dark.

The barn was dark.

The only light came from the car’s headlights, thin beams slipping through the gaps in the wooden boards. Dust swirled in the air, catching faintly in the glow, and the smell—**God, the smell**—was thick with copper and rot.

I stepped inside, gun raised, breath shallow.

The moment my eyes adjusted, my stomach twisted.

The **entire** family hung from the rafters.

The father. The mother. Two sons. And the driver.

Their bodies had been gutted, strung up in mock crucifixion. Arms outstretched, heads slumped forward, entrails dangling like grotesque ornaments. Blood had soaked into the straw below them, forming thick, black puddles in the dim light.

Flies buzzed in frantic circles, feasting.

The driver—who had picked up Ward from the airport—was hung the highest, his face twisted in an expression of frozen agony. His ribs were cracked open, his heart missing.

I swallowed hard, forcing down the bile rising in my throat.

Then I noticed the **absence**.

The girl. **Alice.**

She wasn’t here.

My grip on the gun tightened.

A noise—soft, shuffling—came from the back of the barn.

I turned sharply, gun aimed, breath hitching.

The shadows there were deeper. The car’s headlights didn’t reach that far, leaving only blackness between the wooden stalls.

Something **was there**.

I could feel it.

Watching me.

Waiting.

I forced my voice to stay steady. “Alice?”

Silence.

Then—

A wet, drawn-out **baa** echoed from the darkness.

Low. Rumbling. **Wrong.**

My blood ran cold.

At first, I thought it was just a sheep.

The soft padding of hooves. The shape stepping cautiously into the light. My heart slammed against my ribs, but when my eyes fully registered the creature in front of me, I felt the faintest sigh of relief.

Just a sheep.

Just a goddamn sheep.

I exhaled sharply, lowering the gun a fraction.

And then—it *moved*.

Not like an animal. Not like anything natural.

Its head **rose**.

Higher.

And higher.

My breath hitched as the thing’s neck stretched **impossibly** long, vertebrae popping like the cracking of knuckles. Its skull scraped the rafters, tendons creaking under its own weight. I watched in frozen horror as **more** stepped into the light—except they weren’t more.

They were **one**.

A single, writhing **mass** of sheep, their bodies twisted and fused together like something stitched from a nightmare. Their legs bent in the wrong places, fur matted with blood and filth, mouths twitching—some moving soundlessly, others *screaming*.

I took a step back, my boots sticking slightly to the blood-soaked straw.

And then I saw her.

**Alice.**

Her body was **part of it**.

Her small form tangled in the shifting horror, limbs distended, her face peeking through the mass of writhing wool and flesh. Her mouth stretched wide in a silent wail, her eyes blank—**but she was still alive**.

Somehow.

A high-pitched, warbling **baa** echoed from deep within the thing, rolling through the barn like a death rattle.

The thing **stepped forward**.

The barn **shook** with the weight of it, the wooden boards groaning beneath its shifting mass. The wet stink of blood and damp wool filled my nostrils, choking me.

I didn’t think. I just **fired**.

The first shot hit center mass—if this thing even **had** a center. The second tore through a tangle of fused limbs, splintering bone and spraying something thick and **black** against the straw.

It **screamed**.

The sound was a grotesque mix of guttural baaing and **a child’s voice, sobbing for help**.

*""Please!""*

I kept **shooting**.

Each bullet sent tremors through the thing’s mass, causing it to **recoil**, but it **didn’t stop moving**. The wounds **didn’t close**, but they didn’t slow it down either.

I emptied the clip.

Click.

Click.

**Click.**

Still, it loomed.

Still, **Alice cried out from within it**.

*""It hurts!""* she sobbed, her voice thin and warbling, merging with the tortured bleats of the flock. *""Make it stop!""*

My hands were shaking. My mind was screaming at me to **run**.

 

I ran.

I ran like hell.

Boots pounding against the blood-soaked straw, lungs burning, my mind screaming at my body to **move faster**. The thing behind me **laughed**—a horrible, garbled mix of sheep’s bleats and a child’s sobs, warping into a **low, wet chuckle** that slithered down my spine.

The moment I cleared the barn doors, I sprinted for the car.

But the **thing was fast**.

Too fast.

A skittering, **chittering** sound filled the air as it **burst from the barn**, its dozens of twisted, malformed legs hitting the ground like the cracking of snapping bones. The way it **moved**—shifting, lurching, but with horrifying **precision**—made my stomach lurch.

It was **playing with me**.

I had seconds to react.

The thing **cut me off**, its massive, heaving form sliding into place between me and the car. I barely had time to shift direction, throwing my body down and **sliding beneath the car**.

My coat snagged on the undercarriage, but I ripped free, scrambling out the other side. My heart pounded as I **sprinted for the house**, my boots slamming against the mud-slick ground.

*The keys. The bodies.*

I hadn’t checked them. **Maybe I still had a chance maybe I missed the keys on Wards body.**

I reached the doorway, my hands shaking as I tore at Ward’s body.

Nothing. **Nothing.**

Rosary beads. That same folded note. But then—

My fingers brushed metal.

I pulled free **a silver cross**.

Not a cheap one. Not some meaningless trinket. It was **heavy**. Ornate. This was something **old**, something **powerful**.

Behind me, the sound of **splintering wood** erupted as the **creature crashed into the house.**

I turned **just in time** to see it **charging**.

I had no plan. No time to think.

I just **lifted the cross**.

The thing **froze**.

Fifty **unblinking** eyes locked onto the silver.

For a second—just a second—I thought it worked.

Then… it **smiled**.

Every single face.

Grinning.

Teeth too human. Too wide.

And then—**all of them** turned their eyes toward me.

I stood there, frozen, as one of its many malformed limbs **reached forward**.

Slow. **Deliberate.**

It didn’t **snatch** the cross.

It didn’t **rip it from my hands**.

It **gently** took it.

Turned it.

**Flipped it upside down.**

And **placed it back into my palm.**

The room **spun**.

The thing chuckled—**low, knowing, amused**—before it **rose up**, towering over me.

The cross felt **heavier** now.

And I realized something far worse.

The priest had been a good man. **An innocent man.**

And **even he** couldn’t stop this.

The baas grew **louder**.

Louder than anything I had ever heard in my life.

It wasn’t just **sound**—it was force. It crashed over me like a tidal wave, reverberating in my skull, **drilling into my bones**. My knees buckled, my hands **slammed** against my ears, but it did nothing to stop the noise.

The walls of the house **shook**. The air felt **thick**, pressing in from all sides, suffocating, crushing.

Then—

It **spoke**.

A voice beneath the chorus of wailing sheep.

Deep. Ancient. *Wrong.*

*""Nid yw totemau truenus yn gweithio ar yr un sy’n cysgu o dan y derw.""*

I didn’t understand the words, but I **felt** them. They slithered through my mind like worms burrowing into the folds of my brain.

*""Am droseddau yn erbyn y wlad yr wyf wedi hawlio’r plâu hyn yn offrymau.""*

My vision **blurred**.

*""Gwelwch fod eich perthynas yn gwrando ar y rhybudd hwn.""*

The floor **tilted** beneath me.

And then—**it moved.**

The **mass** of it. The sheer **weight** of the thing **rushed forward**, enveloping me in a tangle of damp wool and **suffocating heat**.

The stench of rot and sweat filled my lungs.

Thick, gnarled limbs **coiled around me**, squeezing.

Tighter.

Tighter.

My ribs **groaned** under the pressure. My veins screamed as my blood struggled to move. My mind **fought** to stay conscious, but the weight—the impossible, unholy **weight**—dragged me under.

The last thing I heard before the darkness took me was **laughter**.

Low. Amused.

**Knowing.**

I woke up with a jolt, gasping for air.

Everything was **wrong**.

The sky outside the window was too bright, too clear. The hum of the plane beneath me was mechanical, but the sound felt distant—like I was underwater.

I rubbed my eyes, trying to clear the fog in my brain. My head was pounding like someone had taken a sledgehammer to it, and my mouth tasted like ashes. I was **disoriented**—too disoriented.

I looked around.

The seats were plush, **first class**. The lights above were dimmed. No one was talking. No one was **looking at me**.

It had to be a dream, right? It had to.

The barn. The creature. The **family**. The cross.

**It couldn’t have been real.**

But then I looked down at my hand.

The cross was still there.

It was **warm**.

And **heavy**.

I felt my chest tighten, my breathing turning ragged. **It was real**. It had all been real. The creature, the barn, the priest—**everything**. I was still alive. I didn’t know how, but I was **alive**.

A hand on my shoulder. A soft voice.

""Sir, are you alright?""

I turned to see a flight attendant standing beside me, concern on her face.

""Where... where are we headed?"" I forced the words out, my mouth dry, throat tight.

""Vatican City, sir.""

The words hit me like a slap.

I stood, my hands shaking. I had to clear my head. I had to get out of this seat.

I stumbled toward the restroom. The cool metal of the door felt grounding against my fingers as I pushed it open. The flickering fluorescent lights above made everything seem too surreal. I stepped in front of the sink, splashing cold water on my face, trying to fight the panic that was rising in my chest.

It didn’t work.

I stared at myself in the mirror, eyes wide, hands pressed against the cold metal.

And then—

I blinked.

Twice.

Just **briefly**—a second, maybe less.

But in the reflection, I saw something I wasn’t supposed to see.

**My eyes.**

For the briefest moment, I could swear that I saw them—those rectangular pupils—wide and **slit**, like something **not human**.

My heart **stopped**.

I stared at myself, unable to breathe, unable to process the **horror** clawing at my chest.

And then—

The reflection **smiled**.

I didn’t.

The bathroom door clicked open behind me, but I didn’t turn around. I couldn’t.

The story was over.

But something inside me **knew**—

It wasn’t over for me.

Not by a long shot.

And I wasn’t the **same** anymore.

My latte art went from decent to trash when I switched coffee shops. The new one has an LM machine (instead of Slayer) and bigger latte cups (16 oz instead of 12).

Every time I steam milk now it feels over aerated.

Has anyone else swapped from slayer to LM? 

Any tips/videos on how to keep improving?

Hope you’re off to a great start so far. 
I finally have the day off from work and glad not to be in the office another day this week lol. 

Meanwhile, I think I want to make some plan to take a trip some place and unplug, reset my mind, chill, and enjoy it before I get back to reality! Anyone else on board to connect and chat a while, maybe even text at some point… not asking anyone to come along on my trip! That would be either too good to be true or a crazy episode from the Bachelor! Jk! I promise that I’ve never seen that show lol…. 

Seriously, I’d love to connect, and keep us some good company… and if you happened to be somewhat hopelessly Romantic (like me), and (really) needy then I’m sure we gonna stick around and talk a while—- mission impossible on here 😆 

Either way, are you a coffee ☕️ or a tea person in the morning? The answer is going to determine the outcome of our possible friendship! Jk! Haha.

I can't stop, at all, I can't hold them and I have them every 10 minutes or even less, if I go to the bathroom they seem to frustratingly stop, as if the school chair was made to bother me.

I dont have the best of diets, I mainly eat pasta and rice, paired with meat or eggs. A few times a week, after school, I'll have chips or some type of unhealthy snack, I'll sometimes have a glass of a fizzy drink, I frequently drink some coffee or energy drink.

For breakfast, around 9:45, I'll have water and a type of sandwich the school offers (egg, ham or cheese)

When Im in an empty stomach, I still fart silently, I can't eat any breakfast or the smell gets worse, to the demise of my classmates.

I've noticed its gotten progressively worse this past few weeks, even though I've had this issue since I was a kid

Is it me eating like shit? Probably, but it bothers me that even if my stomach is growling my intestines persist in shaming me.

I wanted to share my little discovery of the day with you. Let me give you some context about the picture. I just got back from vacation, and as I was about to make myself a coffee, I realized I had completely forgotten to clean the last pot I brewed before leaving. The color is quite surprising, could it be because this mold developed on coffee grounds ? The color is very close to that of an orange highlighter, and I was away on vacation for two weeks.

Do you have any idea what this might be exactly ?

Thanks for reading, by the way ! This is my very first post on Reddit, and I thought it would be fun to break the ice with a post about mold in such a surprising color. Have a great day or evening !

PS: I know I need to clean my coffee maker, it’s really not in great shape.

1jl5j68,https://www.reddit.com/r/hsp/comments/1jl5j68/help_coping_with_smell_sensitivity/,Help coping with smell sensitivity,"To clarify because I know it’s common to post about smell sensitivity, I have a “sensitivity” or low tolerance for bad smells only. I love being sensitive to good smells, I collect fragrances and I love things like candles, plants, coffee shops etc and I (get ready) love it when I can smell someone elses’s perfume/cologne out in public. So I’m not worried about my sensitivity to smell in general, rather my ability to cope with the bad ones. It seems like a good smell to others is an incredible smell to me, and an unpleasant smell to others can be a day-ruining smell for me. 

Does anyone have any success overcoming being over sensitive and having a very low emotional tolerance for bad smells? I’m at my wits end with it and so are the people around me. I get embarrassed every time I open my mouth to say something smells bad because to some people it’s practically the only thing I talk about every day. I’ve also definitely hurt a few people’s feelings throughout my life when I got too frustrated by their stench and just couldn’t keep my mouth shut. It’s the most overwhelming sense for me and when there are bad incidents of it for days on end I get so exhausted by it and it starts to genuinely affect my mood. 


I know that there’s not much I can do to reduce my sensitivity to smells but what can I do to stop being such a wimp about it? 

When I smell a bad smell, this is what happens in my brain.

1. Big red flag, alert, my brain feels like it’s a phone getting a tornado warning, I immediately get distracted from whatever I was doing and a little bit of panic/anxiety/irritation creeps in

2. Must identify the smell. usually pick up my head and smell in all directions to try to see what it’s coming from. I do this compulsively because if I can maybe identify that the “bad” smell is coming from something that isn’t actually gross (for example if something smells really weird but it turns out to just be a kind of unpleasant smelling flower nearby) then I can relax and not be upset by it. But if I can’t identify it, or if I figure out that it’s coming from a person, or if I know already what the smell is (Like one of my roommates for example, he smells like glue, wet skin, and old pee, and I don’t even have to look up to know when he’s nearby) then I start getting upset.

3. Externalizing my response. My problem is that I have a really hard time controlling my reaction to bad smells especially if I know what it’s coming from. I will usually say something out loud or under my breath because I just want someone else to go “yeah, I think it smells bad too”. When I ask and no one else smells something, I feel even more anxious and upset and I always feel the need to point it out/get people to try to smell it too if it’s really bad and I can’t get away from it. I feel like I say “it smells so bad in here” at least once a day when I’m going out or to class or wherever. 


I also am not the kind of person who can “just breath through my mouth,” I’m not sure how that’s effective for others but it does not work for me— I can’t isolate breathing through my mouth without holding my nose in some way. I also can’t always get away from the smell or just hold my nose. I work with kids and some of them aren’t able to wash their school uniforms often at home (not their fault at all!!) but they REEK of sweat, spit, and food— I can’t just sit there holding my nose or walk away from them when I’m trying to do my job.

I feel like a bad smell just takes over everything in my brain and I feel like I am literally the only person sometimes who is bothered by it. I’ve started considering taking measures like wearing face masks with a little bit of essential oils or something.

 I wear perfume/cologne every day and sometimes when a bad smell happens I try to just breathe into my wrist/wherever I sprayed it for a while but I can’t do that forever and it doesn’t always help.

How can I get over this? I feel weakened and over sensitive like I can’t go about my day in the outside world the same way everyone else can. It’s started to give me anxiety and avoidance of certain situations, for example I’ve missed buses before because they looked too crowded and I knew I would be smelling someone’s stink for longer than I could handle. It’s been getting worse over the years and I fear it will honestly impact my ability to go about my life and future jobs in a way that doesn’t involve so much extra stress.

The thing is it never feels like venting it just kind of feels like them verbally harassing the guy.

Maybe that's a conversation to have when you're venting with your girlfriend one-on-one over some coffee.A classroom or a workspace probably isn't the best place to do that.

Like, I'm dating a man and he's really great. He's as masculine as he feels like being. I'm as feminine as I feel like being. I know it looks traditional but it's an opt-in thing for us and there's a lot of ways how it's not traditional. Maybe you just attract shitty people? Maybe there's a reason for that? It's always women in queer spaces who have never had a conversation with a straight guy, and had queer/gender theory explained to them on social media.

This happens a lot when lesbians are hitting on me. "" oh men are so terrible am I right?"" ""How is it that men are so confident, they don't deserve to be so confident"" I'm trans, I don't want to joke about how terrible someone's gender is. I don't mind having a conversation about it, but let's not just use it as an excuse to make someone a punching bag.

I lived most of my life as a man and I think it just makes social gatherings really awkward for a while. I find it really toxic and off-putting when women's main personality trait is hating straight guys. Being straight doesn't say anything about your personality. 

They're just creating a new rift in society between people who subvert gender roles and people who don't. Can't we just not be shitty to people and let people do what they want? 

It's the same women who will tell me that I'm reinforcing patriarchy by wanting to be the woman in a straight relationship.
I don't feel like it's too much to ask for a guy who will let me be the girl and will also respect my boundaries when I speak up. I meet these guys all the time when I'm dating but according to a lot of women they don't exist and all men are evil. 

I have plenty of gender fuck, queer and female freinds who aren't like this. Hating men is not a requirement for being a feminist.",0,1743086478.0,StraightTransGirls,18,0.47,False

1jl5ffj,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jl5ffj/married_to_a_sociopath/,married to a sociopath,"when i was 17, i met a guy. my mom and i had a very corroded relationship, and it was clear once i turned 18 i would be out of the house. this guy was sweet. usually when guys would make any effort to see me it was them just trying to sleep with me. meanwhile, he didn’t try. he was in the military and had to drive an hour and a half to see me multiple times a week and he did so with no complaint. we’d get food, hang out at the hotel i worked at. we’d go on little adventures and hikes through the woods and stop at little creeks to cool off. i call those the innocent times. he was quiet, didn’t have many facial expressions but i figured “why would be he be driving up here all the time if he didn’t want to be here?” after i turned 18, i left home and for a short while rented a room in the city. but since i didn’t have a car it made getting from work and home really difficult. so i decided to move down closer to him and closer to my dads side of the family. he was 21 at the time. i lived in a motel, and got hired at a Waffle House for the time being. but before long he plainly stated “well we can get married, and we’d have a place” so i agreed. and we went to walmart, i paid for $5 plastic rings, and went to the courthouse. i met his friends shortly after. they hated me. made fun of my body, called me a child (i was,
lol), called me names, told me to shut up. insisted that i go to the gym with them. it’s important to note, i wasn’t fat, ive always had a lot of curve and shape to me, but not overweight. it felt like as soon as we got married i knew i had made a serious mistake. one of the first nights we slept in the same bed i had been taking my sleeping medication for insomnia. he shook me awake at around 1am crying. i had never seen him cry. and he just started apologizing saying he “thinks” he had sex with me. i felt down and realized he had finished inside of me. i was in a lot of shock but a crying man was in front of me, a man that i loved. so i comforted him. 
a little while after that i realized this is something he did often. later i looked it up and realized theirs a name for it. he was a somnophile. he’d do this very frequently. some nights i’d wake up and push him off of me. i’d beg him to stop but he wouldn’t. i told him i was going to get pregnant, and everytime we had sex while i was awake i made him pull out or put a condom on. but i did get pregnant. from one early morning when i did wake up and just let him finish because i was tired of fighting it. once i found out i was pregnant i was broken. i sat in the bathroom sobbing while he was at work. i was 18 years old pregnant by a man id known for 8 months. soon the behavior shift in him started. he’d get home, get on his xbox and play for 6-8 hours every single day. he wouldn’t let me use his car to get a job, so i was completely out of options for getting a job. he told me he wanted me to be a stay at home mom. he gave me $50 every 2 weeks for groceries. and send money for gas as i did every single errand, every store run, going to get him coffee when he wanted. and i’d cook, id clean, id do laundry, id take care of all the animals he’d collect and neglect to take care of. he never smiled. he never said thank you. 
i met his family, they were okay but it was clear they had problems. his mother told me his stepdad had severely abused him and his siblings psychologically, physically, and emotionally for years. i felt a lot of pain for him. i made him start therapy and see a psychiatrist who told him he has some sort of personality disorder. 
as the baby was being born soon, i prepared the best i could. buying clothes second hand, my stepmom hosting a baby shower to get plenty of supplies as gifts, anything i could do. i even tried leaving once, he put a hole in the wall and called me a bad name, i ended up coming back after my dad convinced me i needed to give him a chance to be a dad. 
when it rolled around to my water breaking he silently watched as our daughter was born, occasionally making a grossed out face, and not much more. i requested a meal after and he denied and said he’d go home to make chicken and rice. (it’s important to note he had a savings account with well over 12k in it, and there was absolutely no way he wouldn’t have been able to afford the fast food meal i requested) silly note, but it really felt like he valued me and my happiness that little.
everything started to fall apart after she was born. i was absolutely done begging him to see me as a person, to show any type of affection, to stop doing things to me in my sleep. at one point he’d make me perform sex acts on him for spare change to get a snack. one night he told me he was going to the strip club with his friends, and i just let him. i checked his phone the next day and he’d sent a dancer $100. he lied about it, but it didn’t matter. i’d already planned on leaving. i left one afternoon while he was at work. i stayed with my friend for a few days, my dad informed me i could inform his command of all the things he had done. so i did, and i stayed at the house we shared with nothing but the little food he left in the house, and a 6 month old baby. i had to beg for every crumb i received from him and his command besides diapers and formula. it was hell, i lost 40lbs from malnutrition over a 3 month period. 
now it’s been almost a year since i left him, i moved across the country and live with my daughter and my amazing extended family. they treat me like a real person with opinions and dreams. im finally going to school, i have a job, and amazing people surrounding me and helping to raise my daughter. i’m greatful and sad that i had to mature as quickly as i did. but it all led me to where i am today, and i don’t think id be as confident in myself now if i hadn’t gone through what i did.

1jl5cx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jl5cx9/the_reflection_part_6/,The Reflection [Part 6],"Like anyone who just got weird, supernatural ""powers,"" I went straight to my best friend’s house.

Josh’s living room was cluttered in the way that only a lived-in space could be—half-empty snack bags, a few stray game controllers, and a coffee table covered in more condensation rings than actual coasters. The TV was on, playing some rerun of a show we’d both seen a hundred times, but I wasn’t paying attention to it.

I was too busy testing something.

“So, what are the odds,” I said, leaning back into his couch, “that the next commercial is for—let’s say—car insurance?”

Josh raised a skeptical eyebrow but grinned. “What, you psychic now?”

“Just humor me.”

He shrugged, grabbed a handful of chips, and turned his attention back to the screen. The current ad—a painfully boring infomercial about non-stick cookware—faded to black. Then, right on cue, a familiar jingle started playing.

“Save big on auto coverage with—”

Josh nearly choked on his chips. “Okay, that’s kinda freaky.”

I smirked. “Lucky guess.”

“Try another one.”

I did. And then another.

Every time, I got it right. Commercials, song shuffles, when his phone would buzz—like I had some invisible hand on the remote control of reality itself. Josh, at first, found it hilarious. He even started playing along, throwing out his own suggestions. But then it happened.

Josh had jokingly said, “Okay, if you’re some kind of wizard, make my doorbell ring right now.”

The second the words left his mouth—DING DONG.

We both stared at the door. The apartment intercom remained silent, no delivery notifications, no expected guests.

Josh slowly turned to me, the color draining from his face. “Tell me you set that up.”

I forced a laugh, even though my stomach had just dropped into my shoes. “Coincidence.”

Josh didn’t look convinced.

“Dude, come on,” I added, waving a dismissive hand. “We probably just—” I got up, opened the door. No one there. Just the empty hallway and a fading echo of something that shouldn’t have happened.

Josh was still staring when I sat back down. His expression wasn’t excitement anymore. It was something closer to fear. “Okay,” he said slowly, “explain. Now.”

I hesitated. Then, against my better judgment, I told him.

I expected him to laugh, to call me crazy. Instead, the more I explained, the more serious he got. When I told him about the entity’s “favors,” he practically grabbed me by the shoulders.

“Wait—so all it wants you to do is talk to them?”

I let out a short laugh, but there was no humor in it. “Yeah, sure. Not that simple.”

Josh scoffed. “Dude, are you hearing yourself? You’ve got some freaky mirror demon bending the universe in your favor, and all it wants is for you to make amends with your family?”

I clenched my jaw. It sounded easy when he said it like that. Just go home. Just knock on the damn door. Just say something.

But I couldn’t.

Even earlier today, when I stood on their porch, staring at the warm glow from inside, my fist hovered inches from the door. My breathing was shallow, my skin prickling with something that felt... wrong.

I could almost see it—my reflection in the porch window, watching me. Expectant.

I swallowed hard, took a step back. Then another.

And then I turned and walked away.

When I reached my car, I yanked open the door, but something made me pause. The windshield had fogged over, thick with condensation.

And there, carved into the misty glass with deep, jagged strokes, was a single phrase:

***""DO IT.""***

Taking a spur of the moment solo trip Saturday-Tuesday from LA to use up miles and reward myself for some hard work recently. I’ve booked flights and hostel but nothing else yet, and unfortunately I know only the most basic Spanish words.

I’m currently listening to podcasts at work to plan and practice a bit more Spanish, but the rough thought is Museo de Antropologia & exploring Bosque de Chapultepec on Sunday, then Zocalo and walking Centro on Monday. I have a few questions:

-Frida Kahlo museum tickets are sold out, and the Antropologia site gave me an error message—I’m afraid those tickets are gone as well. Any chance of in-person tickets for the latter if I get in line early?

-Seasonal dishes or delicacies to try right now? I’m planning on mostly eating street food, with some people-watching coffees at cafes along the way. 

-I would love to go to Universum, but I fear I won’t be able to make the distance. Any other suggested science attractions or sights close to city center?

-Any audio tours in English you recommend?

The next day we leave to go to another hotel , and things get more tense, I accidentally trip and fall and she calls it a  night and unfurls her pent up feelings of resentment to me over me being quiet or not handling myself well at certain events in our history. Worried about how I’d react. The next day on our commute I saw offhandedly out of my peripheral she’s texting her friend from the trip about how I acted , I panic and try to lie, but we go in this awkward cycle of laughing and chattting and bitterness- it prolongs into more. By the end we’re so burnt out, and take a week. I decide to get help and start working on myself after the trip but a week in she wants to break it off, I partly agreed . I didn’t feel like saying we were friends because it felt just a mix. I mention how I’d block her and just remove so much from us. But she got upset and still wanted me in her life.  I blocked her for 3 weeks before one friend says maybe just lower your guard. I did and made an ultimatum , as she was watching my stories on IG ,  I would send one last text - I did and she responded the next day and told me how shitty things got for her, and I give her a pep talk and we start goofing around like we used to. We text on and off sometimes I intimate sometimes she did ,  I mention after a screening for a project I dedicated to her that she should come out to the next one. She agrees and even when I tell her about the schedule change she agrees to come.  But then she didn’t come , I had to message her about it , and she said she forgot about it , and has been just grinding - she has major AdHD but even my friend who also has it just said that if she wanted to prioritize me she would have done so even with that . But I offered if she wanted to meet for coffee in the next few weeks but I hung in my towel at this point.

He can recite whole pages of different books (not necessarily rhyming, just normal text). So while I can't spend time with him, he usually just ""reads to himself"", he can't read yet, but he does remember text word for word. He is doing it while he plays by himself as well. 

It becomes ridiculous sometimes when he asks me to read him a story and then recites 20 pages of normal text out of his memory (approximately 1000 words), while I'm just sitting there, drinking coffee for 30 minutes, wondering what should I do (I'm usually ending up just occasionally correcting his pronunciation). Now I think he doesn't remember the whole thing after only hearing it once, it's more like on third time, or so... Although, it's hard to tell. Yesterday I told him difficult scientific name of one of the frog species and he remembered it after hearing it once. In the afternoon he aksed me to show him book where was a picture of said frog. 

My question is - did it happen to any of you? Did it pass, normalized? Or memory just continued to develop and became better? What that would even look like? Cause I honestly am a bit worried but also pretty amazed, I never seen anything like this. I also have no idea if I should just be re reading him his favorite books (that he remembers already), or constantly change/expand his library. He already has lots and lots of books btw, but he really likes maybe just 60% of them.

I know the myths. Major violations of Xenia seem to do it. Acts of extreme hubris, especially ones that challenge the Gods themselves, seem to do it. 

I feel like we maybe define ourselves in opposition to the Abrahamic faiths perhaps a bit *too* much- where the fact that the Gods aren't constantly scanning your brain for Sin(TM), or being understanding of a worshiper's devotion being limited by circumstance, has been misconstrued as them being virtually incapable of wrath. 

Are the gods more difficult to anger than the ancient myths would have us believe?

Is being rude to a guest really enough?

Or maybe, as so many of the ancient stories center on kings and heroes, we ought be focused on people of national or global importance, and their acts of violent hubris. 

Is a President or Prime Minister more likely to draw their ire than a coffee barista, if both made roughly the same transgression? 

Do we discourage seeing the Gods as capable of anger,  because viewing one's own misfortune as divine punishment comes across as delusional or self-important? 

What would it take to call upon Olympian wrath?

What would that look like?

1jl52yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1jl52yj/extra_smooth_recovery_timeline_and_tips/,Extra smooth recovery - timeline and TIPS,"(TL;DR LIST OF TIPS IN THE END)

It’s my 7th day post-op (incl. day of the surgery), and I’m already back to normal! I go out, I eat solid foods, I haven’t bled once, I don’t have scabs. I just had my follow-up with the doctor, and he said everything looks perfect — I don’t even need to come back again. I’m writing this because I probably did something right that allowed me to have such a smooth recovery, and maybe it can help some of you too.


About me: I’m 24F and definitely not someone you could call generally healthy. I don’t exercise, my diet is junk, I’m a bit overweight, I have chronic conditions and a lot of undiagnosed stuff as well. I’d also get tonsillitis every 1-2 months so my immune system was also compromised. I won’t get into any more details but just so you know, I’m not a strong healthy person. 


Main points about how it’s been going for me:

- I had my surgery on Friday (21.03), first 3 nights I spent in the hospital where they were giving me antibiotics, antihistamines and steroids (I’ll put the list in the comments). For pain relief they gave me Ketorolac (NSAID) in the morning and before bed. We don’t get any opioids in my country, so no Oxy for me.

- I didn’t look at my throat until day 6, I have no idea what it looked like in there in the beginning but now it’s just two white circles where I used to have my tonsils. I don’t have scabs coming off, my uvula looks normal. Not looking definitely helped my anxiety. I was blissfully ignorant. I’ve been treating it almost identically to a regular tonsillitis which I would have every 1-2 months, just with dietary restrictions and a lot more painkillers 

- My throat was completely undisturbed for the first 24 hours (no swallowing at all) and I started chewing since day 2. It was less painful while I was eating than while resting. 

- I was severely constipated since before the surgery,  I had a saline IV on day 3 which helped me do the no.2 instantly and brought me back to life

- I started brushing my teeth since day 2 (only front teeth at first) which I think helped a LOT with the healing process. It also had a soothing effect

- I wasn‘t allowed to gargle or rinse my throat with anything and I didn’t

- I haven’t washed my hair or wet my ears. Steaming is also not allowed so I didn’t, though it does have a soothing effect and I usually take long hot showers. But it can induce bleeding so you shouldn’t do it. 



Now here’s a more detailed timeline:  


Day 1: I didn’t eat or even drink for the first 26 hours after the surgery. I barely even swallowed. Wasn’t allowed to talk either. It was super uncomfortable and slightly painful. Felt like someone was choking me, literally like someone’s holding me above the ground by my neck. Sleeping on my back was the hardest part of the day 


Day 2: I had no pain at all, just felt strong pressure in my throat and ears. I ate blended soups and in the evening I had mashed potatoes with meatballs and bread and butter. And ofc I started drinking water. I couldn’t drink much tho, even though I was pretty much dehydrated. It just felt yucky, idk. But again, no pain, just discomfort.


Day 3: I was told that Day 3 would be the worst in terms of pain. Now it sure was painful but not unbearable. I ate mashed sweet potatoes and fruit purées. I was told to start actively chewing and talking to prevent muscle atrophy. I tried to eat a banana and it was so painful I went temporarily blind from pain lol. I asked people in this sub and everyone said to keep away from bananas for they are evil! 


Day 4: I was discharged in the morning and I went home. morning. Got a Ketorol shot before leaving, but once I got home the pain got intense — I figured it was because I spent some time outdoors without a scarf - it’s still pretty cold where I live. For pain relief I was prescribed Nimesulide (it’s banned in the US, I don’t know what the equivalent is there). I took one and fell asleep. Slept through most of the day. By this time I was already eating solids - Mac and cheese, avocados. Chewing was still uncomfortable and painful but manageable. I also ate chocolate ice cream - it worked wonders. Better than any drug:)


Day 5: Most painful day of all. Usually, one pill of Nimesulide in the morning lasted all day. This time, pain came back in the evening, and even the second pill didn’t help much. Couldn’t sleep until 4 a.m.


Day 6: still pain in the morning. Was completely fine with painkillers though. I looked at my throat for the first time only to see nothing scary. Now idk what scabs are supposed to look like but what I have is just two white spots, nothing coming off. It’s a consistent thin layer of whatever it is. I had my first iced latte, it had a wonderful soothing effect- I actually forgot there was something unusual about my throat- it felt completely normal, no pain, no pressure, no discomfort. 


Day 7: again, pain in the morning, but not as bad as before. Still took one pill of Nimesulide. Now it’s 5 PM and again, it feels like I’m completely healthy, there’s no discomfort. I’m out and I’m having a regular day:) 



So, there it is. I will add updates in the comments as time goes by and if I develop any issues but I’m pretty sure I’m in the clear. I’m going to continue my diet and not reintroduce rough textures and sour/spicy/salty foods just yet. Even though I’m craving something crunchy like no one’s business😭 


If I had to put this in a short list of tips:


- Don’t look at your throat. The less you know, the better 

- Start chewing as soon as possible 

- Keep away from bananas, they will betray you. Don’t trust their non-acidic nature

- Keep your bowels moving. Get an IV if you can’t drink enough water

- Ice cream and iced coffee do wonders. Not only do they have a soothing effect but help you feel normal

- Speaking of feeling normal - stick to as many of your regular routines as you can (as long as they’re not harmful!). It’s very important for morale. For example: I didn’t skip on my skincare routine though I was very tempted to. Don’t treat yourself like a sickly patient and you won’t feel like one

- Don’t be too hard on yourself. This isn’t the worst procedure out there, and we’re doing it on our terms, to improve our lives. Keep the end goal in mind — it’s worth it. 😇 



Really hope you have a fast and smooth recovery. You got this!❤️

This problem is just not... solvable, unhappiness is the only way. 

You want a relationship:   

* between equals, but then again, you expect yourself to be on a higher stand than the other person.
* with a person, whom you are on principle afraid of attacking you or abusing you with a representative of the Oppression class
* with a person who will be OK bashing his own Identity and peers with someone who will not be able to use your right to ""hold space"", ""draw boundaries"", ""get the ick"", because that would make him a misogynist, i.e. persona non grata
* with a person who when requests something (aka a coffee in bed, a blowjob, space for his hobbies etc.) will be just exercising his patriarchy rights, so he will be shut down

  
I cannot find a way that this person will ever be happy within a relationship. And many of these people really need one, nonetheless, they fail to find one. So sad for all parties involved.

This thing takes place in New York, right? Because everyone sounds like they're fresh out of Georgia. Why is every single character speaking in a Southern accent like they're two steps away from marryin' their cousin? We're in Manhattan here, best case is Weekawken. There are no southern accents to be found here.

People keep talking about Hilltop as if it's close by. Hilltop is in Virginia. You know, the state that is at best a 6-hour drive from NYC when the roads exist. In the post-apocalypse, you’re looking at what, two weeks minimum if you're lucky and don’t get eaten? But no, in this City it's apparently just over the river and through the woods. This is America for little kids.

And then there's Maggie just... stumbling across Negan near New York. Was he just loitering around Secaucus hoping she'd swing by? What is he doing there? Are we supposed to believe the guy just meandered his way up the Eastern Seaboard and decided to hang out in North Jersey like it’s no big deal?

Also, does anyone working on this show grasp how staggeringly large the New York metro region is? It’s not a cute little village with some suburbs slapped on. You don’t walk from Tribeca to Yonkers in a coffee break. Yet here we are with a bunch of characters treating New York like it’s Mayberry with skyscrapers.

And what in the actual hell is this “New Babylon” cowboy town? A full-on Western-themed post-apocalyptic society just chilling across the Hudson like it’s Deadwood on the Hudson River? People wearing dusters and riding horses through what, Fort Lee? That’s your gritty vision of dystopian NYC?

The obsession with the Empire State Building is laughable too. Every character keeps gazing at it like it’s Mount Doom and then pulling out a map of downtown like it’s some ancient treasure map. It’s the most photographed building in the world, not an ancient monolith. And news flash, this building is in midtown, even though all the dialogue and maps call for Downtown. Has anyone involved in this production even been to New York? Or is this just America's collective fantasy version of NYC, some weird “big town surrounded by small towns” concept that completely misses the actual scale of the region?

As the title suggests, my 2 year old got up onto the table after I stepped out of the room for a second and ended up dumping my coffee all over my ROG. I cleaned it the best I could, but at a first glance, the incident didn't seem too bad. It had gotten onto the side of it. I cleaned the d-pad and joy stick, and the buttons next to the screen. The Trigger and bumper were untouched. The spill didnt reach much passed that point (so I thought). It was on the provided charger, and was currently running a game. I can't remember if I had unplugged it or not, but I know I forgot to check and clean the charging port. 30 mins pass, my game is still running and seems like a close call and am feeling lucky it wasn't more serious. Then I hear the charger ding. I stepped away to the kitchen for a moment, so I figured I forgot to plug it back in. Came back, but huh, weird... it's plugged in. 10% battery left. And because it was running a game, it quickly jumped down to the last warning it gives to charge it. Now I'm frantically trying to get it to start charging, but provided charger no longer recognizes being plugged into anything and ROG won't recognize anything being plugged into it. Battery is dead.
I'm not super knowledgeable about the hardware aspect of the device so I ask, how screwed am I? I'm holding out hope that maybe I haven't cleaned it well enough and that's all there is too it (I dont really have small enough tools to get in there), but I suppose I need someone out here to take me from my delusions and make me face the reality that I am dreading is true, shes gone. It's the 3rd day since the incident and still nothing.

Lol on a less dramatic note, if it's dead, how easy would it be to change the port for a new one? Is it something I could easily figure out how to do, or should I take it in? Which one would I need (again I'm not super familiar with the hardware, more of a software person). It is the ROG Ally Z Extreme (Extreme Z)?

Dosent play many multiplayer games since he left Dota

Likes the occasional whiskey, gin and  press seltzers. 

Likes board game nights where I think they play things like Catan and Arkansas horror.

He likes movies, wants an “oled LG tv” I believe

I figure that even though I have this thing that keeps coming back I should not let it keep me from pursuing my goals. If I die trying, so be it. 

So I am looking for advice on any supplements, routines, nutrients I should be getting that could help supplement for the stress / some lack of sleep I will be getting. The good thing is I would have lots of money to throw around for absurd treatments and supplements.

For context I have been more or less 80% recovered for a few months, you can see what I did in my post history. Made the mistake of drinking coffee last week though and had a small flare up, but hopefully it won't be to crazy.

Today I had one too many coffees and needed a break about an hour in. The lady next to me, I was 3A and she was 3B, was sleeping and I gently tapped her shoulder and apologized for the bother. She groaned and made a half cocked effort to move her knees to the side wanting me to squeeze past her rather than standing. Now I’m a full sized adult male and both of the people in row two had their seats fully reclined. This gave me about 9 inches of space and would require me to pull myself against the seat in front of me. It was annoying for me, and the people in row 2. 

When I returned she again moved her knees aside, despite me struggling to sneak past the first time. I shook her off and motioned upwards as she had her headphones on. She moved her knees more and I shook her off again, I then started talking asking her to kindly stand allowing me to pass comfortably and she couldn’t hear me. After about 30 seconds I just went for it again and gave the people in row 2 plenty of space and I’m sure this wasn’t super pleasant for my seat mate as she got a face full of the back of my jeans. I didn’t feel bad for her. 

Please just stand up, it takes 10 seconds and is just basic decency for all around you. ",116,1743085035.0,unitedairlines,16,0.98,False

Maybe I’m unable to bring myself to do a proper socialization. I feel so clumsy during the get-to-know-each-other type of activities. 
Say, a coffee date. It really wears me out because I can’t stop thinking about if Im carrying the conversation just right.
I try my best not to bore them out but I know I’m not a fun person to chat is and I can see boredom in their eyes and I’m also tired of trying funny.

Then I’ll get frustrated. All the effort I put into this coffee date — from dressing up to being funny — just turned out to be another lame conversation. 
So I’ll grab a drink or two after leaving the cafe and hook up to make this meetup purposeful. 

I’ve done this so many times and even if some of them turned into a somewhat long term thing it’s the same. After all I don’t know them very well because it’s all about intimacy and that’s it.
Every time I end things with someone I hang around for a bit longer I feel really sad. Sad that we weren’t friends and we’ll be erased from each other’s life pretty soon. 

People say you can only have a meaningful connection with someone you take seriously not casually and fwb/flings aren’t exactly ideal. But it feels so difficult to really connect with someone and I can’t break the old habit.",1,1743085024.0,self,1,1.0,False

Who knows, maybe one little subreddit could spark a bigger idea or even real change. Thank you to u/Melchizedeck44 for starting this conversation.

Creating truly walkable neighborhoods in downtown Minneapolis and St. Paul would completely change how we feel about our cities. Right now, when you picture downtown, you probably think of loud traffic, smoggy air, concrete everywhere, and feeling unsafe. Nobody really enjoys that. But imagine stepping out your door into quiet streets lined with trees, cafés, and local shops. Imagine comfortably walking from your home to work or meeting friends without ever needing your car keys.

When people complain about cities, they usually have good reasons. Let’s start with noise and air pollution. But here's the thing you need to remember, and it should be said boldly: **Cities aren't noisy. Cars are noisy.** If you've ever visited a city designed mostly for walking, without cars driving everywhere, it's a surprisingly quiet and peaceful experience. The buildings are still there, people are everywhere, but it feels calm, almost like you're walking through a city park. And fewer cars means cleaner air, too.

Another big issue people worry about is crime. But here's something most people don't realize: walkable areas are naturally safer because they're busy. If you've ever been lucky enough to visit New York City, you might have been surprised by how safe it feels. The reason it's safe is because of how many people are around. It's much harder for crimes to occur with so many eyes watching. Remember this: **Eyes are the number one enemy of crime.** Streets filled with neighbors, shoppers, and restaurant-goers are far less attractive to criminals.

There's also policing. I get it, a lot of folks aren't thrilled with cops these days. But we're not talking about aggressive police presence. We're talking about real community policing, where officers get to know their neighborhoods and build genuine trust with residents. You would know their names, maybe something about their family, like whether they enjoy fishing or playing basketball. Knowing your local officers personally helps make neighborhoods feel safe and welcoming.

So, is this idea realistic? Can we really pull this off? Honestly, Americans have always been skeptical about walkable cities because we've never really tried one. Even New York City, probably our best example, isn't really that walkable compared to places you see in Europe or parts of Asia. We always go halfway and then give up. We put in a couple of bike lanes, widen a sidewalk, and that's about it. No wonder people don't think walkable cities work. We've never actually seen a real one here.

But imagine this: what if we took an entire city block downtown, completely cleared it out, and built a genuine market square? No halfway measures, no cars allowed, just open space for pedestrians surrounded by cafes, restaurants, local stores, and daily markets. A place that becomes the heartbeat of the city, filled with activity every single day of the week.

If you want proof, we can actually run the numbers. Right now, every city block generates tax revenue through businesses, restaurants, and property taxes. Let's compare that to proven market squares around the world that are busy year-round. It's easy to imagine a lively, welcoming market square generating far more revenue than what we have now, especially compared to our current downtown, which is mostly dead. More visitors means more spending, more business, and ultimately more taxes collected. This is exactly how we justified spending over a billion dollars building the U.S. Bank Stadium. The government argued it would draw visitors, boost local businesses, and increase taxes overall. But unlike stadiums, a busy market square wouldn't depend on occasional events. It would generate revenue every single day.

Right now, Minnesota has an interesting opportunity. We've never had a governor with as much political capital as Tim Walz. He's in a great position to push something big and transformative like this. But we can't do it unless we get conservatives on board, too. And there’s actually a strong conservative case for investing in downtown walkability. Conservatives believe deeply in the power of small businesses, entrepreneurship, and growing local economies. Walkable downtowns create exactly that kind of environment. They become small-business explosions where local restaurants, shops, and businesses thrive because customers actually want to be there. This isn't big government, it's smart, strategic investment that grows our economy from the ground up.

And hey, if we do this right, maybe all the liberals will flock downtown, and conservatives will have fewer rainbow t-shirts and face tattoos showing up at their suburban coffee shops. Just kidding, but maybe there’s a grain of truth there?

In other words, creating truly walkable neighborhoods isn't some luxury idea. It's practical, economically smart, and directly improves our everyday lives. It means less noise, cleaner air, safer streets, healthier people, and thriving local businesses. It's about making downtown a place we actually want to spend time in, instead of a place we're afraid to walk through. We can absolutely do this, and it makes sense for everyone, whether you're conservative, liberal, or somewhere in between.

Edit: While voting in new people would be ideal, I think that's just another version of kicking the can. Why not now? Right now. who knows how much longer we'll have a governor good at communicating messages.",112,1743084917.0,minnesota,113,0.79,False
