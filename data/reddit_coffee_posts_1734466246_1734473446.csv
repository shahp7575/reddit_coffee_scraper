1hgm9cq,https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/1hgm9cq/any_tips/,Any Tips?,"Any tips to stand my ground a tiny bit better. I always see cool comebacks and defenses when dealing with such clods!

I meanwhile, ""encourage"" it and now it's like wildfire. One or a few people do it then more and more where even my co workers do it. 

But when I try to defend myself it doesn't work and looks more goofy at times.  Like I'm letting it slide and then more and more use me as a Palooka (Punching Bag enemy from Mario).. I've just about had it. What are better ways to basically not take shit but not be rude, but a bit ""Assertive"" as in stern. 

So like if someone tries anything it won't work instead of me submitting to there whims.

If they give one word questions like ""Money"", ""Coffee"", ""Bread"", etc... What are some counters I can use?

Same thing when I get waved at, come hithered at, whistled at, finger Wiggled at, etc as in all the Inettiquette ways to call us. A new one is a retard swinging there item like a flail OR LIFTING IT UP END DOWN. THAT'S NOT WORDS YOU TROGOLODYTE... But it's a hazard. I almost lost my eye because someone waved an Aloe to my face and it was really close to poking me in the eye! So that's why I'm worked up. 

What's next? Those fucking mortals THROW THE ITEM AT ME? Which again... HAZARD! What If my back is turned helping someone and someone throws a can at me because I let them get away with it. 

Which as a SCO Host I am mixed. It's crowded but if that's the case I'll need both a visual and audible...

Not to mention a clod interrupting me when I'm obviously helping out someone

Or if my back is turned again and they wave more aggressively expecting me to see behind my back. And people overall being impatient jerks expecting me to go to them in 0.1 Seconds

Point is I'm tired of being a punching bag. It's like my weakness is smelled and I'm really tired of being weak and pushed around. 

What are some counters you use when someone acts like a clown? A common one I see for items is like if customer goes ""Tape"", an associate goes ""What about it?"" or something

I have been making my partner's coffee each morning before they go to work for years. They've recently discovered a tea they'd like to try instead (they're working on some health goals that I fully and enthusiastically support). 

Historically I've done brewed coffee in the mornings and then used almond milk and cream to flavor/cool it enough that they can drink it in the car on their very early morning commute with a second HydroFlask mug ready to go for later in the day. 

Today was my first day trying to figure out logistics of how to do this with tea. We have both loose leaf and bags that can be used.  

So here are my questions...

1. At what temperature should I set my electric kettle for the mug that they will drink in the car on the way to work? They are temperature sensitive and it can't be TOO hot.... but the tea still needs to steep. 

2. How long should I steep the tea for the ""commute cup?"" The one they will start drinking within an hour of steeping. This will be in an insulated cup. 

3. Should I steep the tea in the electric kettle and then pour into cups? Or pour hot water and steep in the mugs themselves? 

4. Are there ways that I can help their ""later"" cups be as nice as the fresh brewed? Should I send just tea bags and they can add to microwaved water while at work? 

5. Is there a metric for determining how much loose leaf tea to add to an infuser for a pretty strong tea that is black tea based?

Of which were No one is allowed to speak to teachers before 7 am. Each day a group of fifth year and above students would be sent to Hogsmeade's lone coffee shop for teacher orders. Some students are allowed to order their own provided they had the gold for it. Another is if you value your life DO NOT take Luna Lovegood's earbuds and/or headphones.

Delores was never involved in Hogwarts prior to her appointment so she never understood the Unspoken Rules. Each house had a sort of Monarchy and pecking order. For all her quirks, Luna ruled the Ravenclaw dorm. Harry Potter ruled Gryffindor, Susan Bones ruled Hufflepuff, and Draco Malfoy ruled Slytherin. As the Founder's lines died out, it was decided by the castle on the monarchy system until the Hat chose the heirs based on what the Founder's chose as guidelines.

One morning while teachers and students were having their morning coffee, Delores huffed and stalked over to the Ravenclaw table. She tanked Luna's earbuds out of her ears and said in her sickly sweet tone, ""Muggle devices are not allowed in school. You will not be getting these back."" The Ravenclaw students and most students backed up grabbing the firsties as Luna said in a dangerous low tone, ""Give me back my earbuds. Now!"" Umbridge smirked not even seeing the terrified looks on the teachers faces. ""Tut tut, speaking to your betters that way. Detention for a month every night Miss Lovegood and I will be revoking your Hogsmeade privileges for the remainder of the school year."" Draco said, ""Madam Umbridge if you value your life, give back the earbuds. There's a very good reason none of the other teachers tried this before now "" Unfortunately for Delores his warning fell on deaf ears as Luna let out a bolt of dark blue magic which stopped Delores' heart. She reclaimed her earbuds and Dumbledore proclaimed, ""Due to Delores' own ignorance all classes are cancelled today. Mandatory Hogsmeade day. Lower years must be accompanied by a student third year and up. Potter and Malfoy, use these to take Luna shopping.

but i get it can be hard to do this when you've spent literally your whole life obsessing over this team, even during the offseason. that's why i didn't just stop watching the games, i started treated myself and enjoying the day whenever the bears play to take my mind off it. and believe me, it works WONDERS. once you start doing it once, you can't stop. in the past two gamedays, i...

-drove out to crystal lake and got in touch with an old friend i hadn't spoken to since high school

-found out that that friend started up his own band and put it on my calendar to go see their next show. i eventually saw them live and they were great. i'm now messaging this friend regularly and we're keeping in touch again. 

-went back home and checked out a new restaurant with a couple of friends

-paid a visit to my boyfriend while he was working on and surprised him with his favorite coffee from starbucks

-paid a visit to my little cousin and helped him out with his homework. then, we fingerpainted together.

and not once during any of this did i stop and wonder ""how are the bears doing right now?"" i literally didn't even know the final score of last night's game until i heard it on the radio this morning. looking back at how much i've been doing on gamedays, i actually laugh at how much time i used to spend on this hopeless dog shit organization instead of spending time with old friends and loved ones and just enjoying my goddamn life.

The two of them go to Tim Hortons and order two coffees. Zetix‚Äôs visit had a clear purpose - the Minister of Fisheries wanted to talk face-to-face with his Shadow minister.*¬†

Marie: Hi, Zetix!

Zetix: Hi, Marie! It is great to be here with a fellow colleague of mine. We are respected through democracy all the time, even though we may disagree with each other.

Marie: Yes, indeed. Today, let's put our differences aside for a while as we work together towards a mutual goal: Bettering the fishing industry in Canada and the lives of everyone involved. How are you today?

Zetix: I am doing great. It is great to be visiting Alberta, which is a great example of Canada's fishing industry.

Marie: That's great to hear! I agree - Alberta, although it doesn't exactly compare with Vancouver, has a diverse fishing industry. Right off the bat, I have concerns about our trout population. I've talked to many fishermen in the area, and every one of them has told me how the amount of trout in the lakes is dwindling.

Zetix: Firstly, I do agree with your statement on Alberta being a diverse fishing industry. Alberta is a landlocked province, but it does show Canada's strength in fishing. Alberta is known as ""Native Trout Country."" It is an example of how the industry is. To respond to your point about the trout population, many fishermen in Alberta do have concerns about our trout population. I do not believe in decreasing the trout quota. Unlike other species, lowering the quota could put a harm on fisheries who rely on trout. However, many catches of trout are accidental. In order to prevent this, we will encourage the use of new and growing technology. For example, By-Catch Reduction Devices could be used to help accidental catches of trout, and we can use technology to catch larger trout, so smaller trout can grow and continue to reproduce for generations.

Marie: I'm sure that was a relief for many families here that rely on trout! Yet, I think accidental catches of trout aren't the reason trout are dying out. Of course, it does play a part and I somewhat support your idea of using By-Catch Reduction Devices, but what I think is the main problem here is climate change. Do you plan on doing anything to mitigate global warming's impact on the trout population?

Zetix: For sure. Climate change is one of the most important issues in the entire country. One common misconception is encouraging the use of electric cars through a carbon tax will help fight against climate change. Electric cars are not going to make the climate better, but rather worse due to the amount of lithium used in making the batteries. I also do not believe in cutting oil production, as Alberta and our workers rely on it. That includes the Trans Mountain Pipeline project. However, I believe that coal and fossil fuel funding should be cut and we should work to fund sources of renewable energy for everyone. Additionally, we believe that nuclear power plants should be more efficient in energy.

Marie: I think these are all great ideas. It is times like these when I respect you and am glad Canada has such a responsible MP! Can you expand on what exactly we are doing about the environment in regard to the fishing industry?

Zetix: As per working for the environment specifically for the fishing industry, we are mostly doing basic acts to fight against climate change. Climate change causes wildfires, which forces ashes and dust into the air, and released into the water. We will work with firefighters to deal with operations quicker. That includes wildfires.

Marie: Seems like wildfires are a bit far from the depleting fish population, eh? Could you please explain how exactly wildfires impact trout?

Zetix: When a wildfire occurs, the fire and air spreads to the city, which causes dust, ashes, and toxic air to be released into the water. This causes trout and other sea creatures to be intoxicated by those properties.

Marie: Is there anything you‚Äôre doing to specifically address climate change‚Äôs impact on fisheries? I mean, you have all these plans for nuclear energy, but do you have short term plans, for example, are you doing anything to combat plastic waste pollution in our lakes?

Zetix: Currently, no. However, we will definitely look forward to making short-term projects, like have been done in the past.

Marie: Alright. We will be looking forward to seeing some real and visible change. Moving on, you mentioned not cutting oil production. Why? Since oil is a huge and integral part of our lives, I understand why cutting it entirely would be a terrible idea. However, don‚Äôt you agree that there are at least some environmental impacts of the Trans Mountain Pipeline that must be addressed? What are you doing to mitigate the impacts of oil? After all, it isn‚Äôt the cleanest or the greenest, is it?

Zetix: Obviously, it isn't the cleanest or greenest. However, we do sometimes have to make small sacrifices in order to focus on the big picture. The Deputy Leader of your party has stated multiple times for more gas and oil to be produced rather than wasted. That's what the Trans Mountain Pipeline aims to do. Without the pipeline, the price of gas and oil will go up, which will cost more for the fishery.

Marie: I support this act, of course, but it seems a little counterintuitive after you talked about helping the environment.

Zetix: There are some things we are doing to save the environment and some things we are doing as a government which would damage the environment. However, we do have a vision to balance between damaging and saving the environment.

Marie: Hmm‚Ä¶ can you explain that vision?

Zetix: Simple. There are multiple projects we plan to do to help save the environment, such as limiting funding of fossil fuels and saving nuclear energy, but also projects that could affect the environment, such as the Trans Mountain Pipeline.

Marie: That's... lovely? Again, isn't that counterintuitive? We're supposed to be saving the environment, no?

Zetix: Like I said, it does balance out with other projects. We can‚Äôt sacrifice everything simply for climate change.

Marie: That's true. What are the Trans Mountain Pipeline's impacts on local fisheries?

Zetix: It has a negative impact due to climate change. However, it does have a positive impact, as a trucker needs to ship the fish, and helps for those who use gasoline powered fishing vessels.

Marie: Can you expand a little on that? Why is burning oil preferable to methods such as electricity when it comes to fishing vessels? I mean, I understand that oil is a lot cheaper, but can't we somewhat subsidize renewable electricity for fishing vessels? May you please explain why that wouldn't work as well as oil?

Zetix: It‚Äôs the same way as how electric cars work; the environmental costs of making parts for electric fishing vessels is more than non-renewable sources would use in the average lifespan of a fishing vessel.

Marie: Could you expand on those environmental costs of making parts?

Zetix: Electric batteries for vessels and vehicles are made using lithium, which requires a ton of mining to do so.

Marie: Oh! I'm sorry, I was thinking of something else. I see now, thank you. Let's go back to your By-Catch Reduction Devices. How do they work, how much do they cost, and how will we integrate them into the fishing industry?

Zetix: By-Catch Reduction Devices are modifications of trawl nets that would allow for certain species caught accidentally to escape the net. By-Catch Reduction Devices are traditionally inexpensive compared to often used fishing vessels. We will integrate them by working with provinces to provide financial subsidies to fisheries if they use them. Additionally, we will provide free training programs so fishers can learn how to use the technology.

Marie: Ooh. That sounds like a brilliant idea. But, what do you mean when you say that they are 'traditionally inexpensive compared to often used fishing vessels'? Will these devices not be used on a fishing vessel? A fishing vessel is expensive - do you know approximately how much 'inexpensive' is?

Zetix: Sorry, I meant to say inexpensive compared to commonly used fishing rods.

Marie: Okay! No worries. Thank you so much for coming! You've given all of us very useful insights about the fishing industry. I really appreciate you coming this far. Let me pay for the coffee!

Zetix: No problem. It was great discussing with you. And please, I will pay for it.

Marie: Hey! This is *my* home, therefore *I* will pay for it. Next time I visit Toronto, you can buy me a coffee then.

Zetix: Sure then

Planned to have a second one but she rejected me a couple days later because of the reason that she didn't feel the spark that she needs on a first date. She said that I‚Äòm a really nice person but that we shouldn't plan any further dating. 
I said for me it was more like a vibe check, not a date but I would have been willing to get to know her further because I really liked her but I definetly respect her decision and I don't take it personally.

She replied that it was important to her that I didn't take it personally and deleted my number.
I have also deleted hers. Things just go on‚Ä¶

But in a couple days is her birthday. I remembered it cause she told me on that date.

Is it weird if I send her a short text to wish her a happy birthday? I mean we are not friends or anything but she was very nice and honest even when she rejected me what I respect.

I don't want it to seem weird because we haven't had any contact since then for obvious reasons

Just a random question that came to my mind today tbh

1hglwlk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1hglwlk/is_the_relationship_over/,Is the relationship over?,"My wife is a career oriented woman who I have supported emotionally and financially over the past 10 years to get her where she is now. I have made career, family and relationship decisions based on supporting her goals.

She recently told me that she doesn't love me and never felt the way I have felt about her. Mainly points to trauma that she suffered by living with my parents so that I could afford her education and continues to compare and point to her cousins and friends that never had to do the same.
In my defense they were either working (both spouses) or the husband was either a doctor or high level IT/engineer.

And honestly the trauma she points to is a bit overreaching compared to a lot of the trauma that her cousins/friends went through where husbands were abusive, or having extramarital affairs. I might be being a bit insensitive here but I have shown her nothing but love and respect. And kept her away from any drama that I was able to so that she can focus on her career.

She finds ways to make sure time with me is extremely limited. Makes sure that someone is present whenever we try to do go somewhere or do something. Even if I do get her to grab a coffee with me where we can talk, she finds ways to get offended and be in a rush to leave. There's no more connection. There‚Äôs other things as well. Lately shes very protective of her phone and laptop. She takes her calls in her study which has a bathroom (exhaust on). 

It didn't use to be like this. She used to be all over me, I couldn't keep her hands off me. I used to know exactly what she was thinking. Now she claims she never did such things.

I have talked to her a number of times and asked for things to change otherwise I want out. But she refuses to end the relationship, she keeps asking for time to finish up her fellowship. Is she delaying till she can find someone else or does she want this to work? Ultimately, I want to know is the relationship over? I rather move on than continue being hurt and honestly ignored and emotional abused.

1hglv1s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hglv1s,Rob vs Chip Whistler (The Amazing World of Gumball vs Big City Greens) || ‚ÄúChipped Mistakes‚Äù || Revamped Connections and Potential in description,"Connections:

‚Ä¢ Antagonists from comedic 2010s animated series that start off as friends/neutral characters

‚Ä¢ An action caused by the young male rambunctious protagonist with a more reasonable sister, a well meaning but sometimes oblivious dad, and an aggressive motherly figure causes them to swear to become their greatest nemesis

‚Ä¢ They would lose part of themselves due to the protagonist, both physically and mentally (Rob loses his morals and parts of his body/Chip loses his sanity and chips his front teeth)

‚Ä¢ Both would appear in smaller roles after this, building up to their greatest role in an episode

‚Ä¢ Both would become obsessed with the protagonist, setting up Looney Tunes esq traps to kill them, only for them to fail

‚Ä¢ Both are given multiple opportunities to redeem themselves and turn from their hatred, but reject them (well, most of them in Rob‚Äôs case). One of the biggest instances of them rejecting redemption is when the protagonists help them out on a goal of theirs, only for them to continue to hate the protagonists.

‚Ä¢ Both are treated like non-threats by both the protagonist‚Äôs family and the people of the town they inhabit due to their schemes always failing and sometimes backfiring

‚Ä¢ However, this would all change when they gain something that truly makes them a threat to be reckoned with (The Universal Remote/The deeds to the buildings around the Green‚Äôs house). They‚Äôd then strike on a normal day for the family they despise.

‚Ä¢ This new boost in power also boosts their threateningness, finally breaking them out of their joke roles and being treated like the villain they are

‚Ä¢ Both isolate the protagonist from their loved ones using manipulation and lies

‚Ä¢ During these episodes, they‚Äôd decide that simply defeating the protagonist isn‚Äôt enough, and that they will destroy the protagonist and everyone they love

‚Ä¢ Both would be flung away seemingly out of the narrative by the protagonist, however, they would come back

‚Ä¢ When they come back, they have an epiphany and decide to stop hating the protagonist and live a normal life

‚Ä¢ However, their hatred would be reignited, and they‚Äôd return to their main villain role

Contrasts:

‚Ä¢ Rob eventually changed for the better, while Chip only doubled down on his hatred

‚Ä¢ Chip is a man with everything but wanted more, while Rob is a man with nothing, not even a family 

Bonus Connections:

‚Ä¢ They both tend to blame other people for their problems

‚Ä¢ They are both emotionally unstable

‚Ä¢ Both are very insecure and seek validation

‚Ä¢ Both have lost their memories and only regained them because of their pure and utter hatred for the protagonist

‚Ä¢ Both had a gag where the characters forgot their name

FIGHT POTENTIAL:
The fight could begin with Chip ripping off Rob at Wholesome Foods, making Rob want to get revenge. Then, you could have them trying and repeatedly failing to trap each other using wacky devices. It could escalate further with Chip sending all of his employees after Rob and Rob beating them (think army vs one-man-army).

If Rob Wins: Chip could lose his mind and enter his helicopter, charging at Rob. Unbeknownst to him, Rob opened a portal to the Void behind him, using the eject button on the Universal Remote to fling Chip into it. He‚Äôd die by his helicopter running into some debris at high speeds, exploding it, but not before the impact chips his tooth.

If Chip Wins: Chip lures Rob to a building wired to explode and gets the jump on him, taking the Universal Remote. Chip then pauses him and stands outside the building laughing like he does when exploding Big Coffee in Chipocalypse Now.

DEBATE POTENTIAL:
Rob should stomp, but Big City Greens is incredibly under researched and could be slightly less of a stomp.",3,1734472343.0,DeathBattleMatchups,0,1.0,False

My new 2-wire 1/2HP, 240V submersible well pump does not use that FP0050 box inside. It has an LRA rating of 32.2A which I measured with an inrush clamp on meter at 31.72A. My 7000W/8750W generator will not start the new well pump (engine dies when the well pump kicks on). I experimented with both 120V outlets directly on the generator and also two 120V outlets from inside my house to account for possible connection issues/losses. I connected resistive loads (Two 12A space heaters and One 8A coffee maker, so 32A total steady) and then I would add in pulsing from my angle grinder that is pulling just over 10A inrush and 1A steady. The inrush duration of the angle grinder was presumably short and the generator was fine handling 42A of inrush which is well over the rated starting surge capacity of the generator. I can only guess that the inrush duration of my well pump is longer than the angle grinder to the point where it's too long for my generator to handle it. So all of that is interesting, but it leaves me wondering how in the heck I could spec out a bigger/better replacement generator when by all measures, my current generator should be handling my well pump just fine. I've never seen an starting watt/inrush duration spec on generators. Any thoughts on how to approach solving this issue? Current thoughts are: Convert back to a 3 wire well pump with FP0050 capacitor box. Investigate purchasing a soft start well pump. Consider getting a 300 gal storage tank/UV light and indoor pump and putting that small pump on generator which has the added benefit of emergency water storage.

Ik wil een kattencaf√© openen in Enschede ‚Äì maar ik heb jullie hulp nodig!

Enschede heeft veel gezellige plekjes, maar wat ontbreekt, is een plek waar je kunt ontspannen met een kop koffie √©n een knuffelige kat op schoot. Daarom wil ik een kattencaf√© openen: een knusse plek voor mensen √©n katten.

Waarom een kattencaf√©?

Voor de mensen:
Veel studenten wonen op kamers waar huisdieren niet mogen. Een kattencaf√© biedt hen de kans om toch te genieten van het gezelschap van katten. Daarnaast willen we extra werkplekken cre√´ren, ook voor mensen met een afstand tot de arbeidsmarkt. Bijvoorbeeld voor mensen met autisme, die vaak geweldig omgaan met dieren en zo in een veilige omgeving kunnen groeien.

Voor de katten:
We willen vooral asielkatten een kans geven. Die ene kat die een oogje mist of dat onafscheidelijke duo dat niet uit elkaar kan ‚Äì bij ons krijgen ze een liefdevol thuis.


Wat kun je verwachten?
Een gezellige sfeer met heerlijke koffie, thee, huisgemaakte lekkernijen zoals (vegan) panini‚Äôs, een verse soep, smoothies, en meer. Ondertussen kun je knuffelen met onze katten en gewoon even tot rust komen.

Binnenkort start ik een crowdfunding om dit waar te maken. Het doel? Deze zomer openen we The Enchanted Cat (voorlopige naam) ‚Äì het eerste kattencaf√© van Enschede.

Wat vinden jullie van dit idee? Ik hoor het graag! üòä

- - - - - English version - - - - -

I want to open a cat caf√© in Enschede ‚Äì but I need your help!

Enschede has plenty of cozy spots, but it‚Äôs missing something: a place where you can relax with a cup of coffee and a cuddly cat on your lap. That‚Äôs why I want to open a cat caf√© ‚Äì a warm, welcoming space for both people and cats.

Why a cat caf√©?

For the people:
Many students live in housing where pets aren‚Äôt allowed. A cat caf√© gives them a chance to enjoy the comfort of feline companionship. We also aim to create jobs, especially for people with fewer opportunities in the job market. For example, individuals with autism, who often have a natural bond with animals, can gain confidence in a safe, supportive environment.

For the cats:
Our focus will be on shelter cats ‚Äì the ones often overlooked. The cat with a missing eye or the bonded pair that can‚Äôt be separated ‚Äì they‚Äôll find a loving home with us.


What to expect:
A cozy atmosphere with delicious coffee, tea, homemade treats like (vegan) paninis, a bowl of warm soup, smoothies, and more. While you enjoy your drink, you can cuddle with our cats and unwind.

I‚Äôll be launching a crowdfunding campaign soon to make this dream a reality. The goal? To open The Enchanted Cat (working title) this summer ‚Äì Enschede‚Äôs very first cat caf√©.

What do you think of this idea? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

1hgls49,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1hgls49/max_board_width_quarter_vs_flat_sawn/,Max board width quarter vs flat sawn,"I'm getting ready to purchase lumber for a dining table top that I'm building and will be edge gluing together (just for myself I'm not a professional).

I've built a couple table tops in the past (dining and coffee) and I always stuck to a maximum 6 inch board width for edge glueing.

However at both of the local lumber suppliers that I have available for purchasing 8/4 white oak for the table top, all of the quarter sawn white oak is 9+ inches wide where the flat sawn is more 7-8.

This leaves me in a situation where to keep costs down I'm considering either using flat sawn 8/4 white oak and keeping it to a maximum 6"" board width, or purchasing quarter sawn 8/4 white oak and stretching up to a 7/7.5"" board width to meet my target table width with one less board purchase (cost is similar for each option). Cutting the quarter sawn lumber down to 6"" would cost me probably $200+ extra and I would also just be wasting a lot of lumber.

I've been doing some research and while 6"" is usually a rule of thumb - I've seen the opinion that quarter sawn lumber in general is much more stable and less prone to warping/cupping/twisting and that 8/4 white oak would also be working for me towards more stability.

Curious if anyone has used something so wide or has any advice for me. Again the table top is just for myself so if I have any issues down the line It would just be me having to go through this process again as a failed experiment for trying to save a few bucks.",1,1734472130.0,woodworking,2,1.0,False

Now I feel like I'm being Watched.,"My name is Kaitlyn (22f), I live in a rural town in the deep woods of Montana. I moved here because the surrounding area was more appealing to me than the cities on the East Coast. It was my first winter here and it was hard to adjust. I got a job at a local gas station on the outskirts of the town. The locals have always seemed friendly but we all know how locals feel about big city people showing up in their small towns.

Starting at Marties (the gas station) was simple and easy. They stuck me on mid-shift so I would leave just before it got dark. There's not much to talk about the station. We had four pumps, they had a very vintage feel to them because there was no digital screen, the first time I'd seen ones like that. Inside we had three rows of random assortments as well as two walls of fridge/freezer doors. Then of course we had the soda machine which only served Pepsi products, not my favorite choice.

The area around the station was beautiful. There was a single-lane road that ran past with moderate traffic from tourists or other locals. When I got to work, the smell of fresh pine and morning dew always hit my nose. It was as if being there was such a mental pallet cleanser. Other than that there was a small storage/garage area out back next to the trash bin. The only stuff kept in there were tools to fix stuff if the mechanics couldn't come out, or in case someone's car broke down and needed a jump.

I had a few interesting co-workers, well three. There was Jim, he was your typical small-town stoner guy. He was always relaxed and went with the flow but always smelled like he just climbed out of a pile of dirt. Then there was Brenda, she was a mother of three and was a mother to everyone that worked there. Her only downside was smelling and puffing out smoke like an old train. Then there was Wayne, Wayne looked like a very mature typical country boy. He wore his button-up shirt with his blue jeans and boots. His hair was short and black that framed his face along with the light stubble around his chin. It's what every city girl dreams of and boy did I dream about him.

Now that I've told you a little bit of what is going on it's time we get to why I'm here writing this out for you. So I've been here for three weeks now, enough time to build up somewhat of a relationship with others in town. And as it turns out there's a fall/winter concert kind of party that goes down at the Harris farm every year. People from the surrounding towns would all gather here and have one big party. I was invited the first time I've ever been invited anywhere. So I planned and got the day off and cleared. And I couldn't wait to go to my first real party.

I had the location ready on my phone, I was texting in between stages telling my friends how excited I was about this. Just as I finished getting my hair done and my eyeliner perfect my phone rang. Glancing over I expected it to be the girls at the party, But it was Wayne who was calling me, I froze for a second, sure we have talked before but why was he calling me now? So I picked up the phone and answered.

Kaitlyn: ""Hey Wayne, what's up? Shouldn't you be at work now?""

Wayne: ""Howdy Kaitlyn, you are right but that's what I'm callin‚Äô bout. I've had a sudden issue with family and I need to leave for a few hours and wanted to know if you could cover for me?."" At this point my heart kind of dropped, I was so excited for this party but I was also torn because of how much I wanted him to like me.

Kaitlyn: ""What happened to Jim or Brenda? Or one of the others?""

Wayne: ""Well I tried calling them both but neither answered. I'm sure Jim‚Äôll be too high to figure out how his phone works or he's asleep. And you know Brenda is probably also asleep after dealin‚Äô with those kids she's got.""

Kaitlyn: ""I'm not sure honestly, I can probably come in for a few hours."" saying reluctantly. Wayne: ""Listen I know how much it means to you but I wouldn't be asking if I had any other choice I'll make it up to you I swear.""

Kaitlyn: ""Alright Alright but you owe me big. I'll see you in a few.""

We both said goodbye and hung up, I immediately gave out a drastic sigh and began finding, putting on my work clothes. I hurried because Wayne was waiting on me now. The faster I got there the faster he could get back. Finally getting ready I grabbed my keys and my jacket and headed out the door. My old car fought me in the cold. When it roared to life, I drove to Marties.

As I pulled into Marties, I could see Wayne prepping the shelves inside. Stepping out of my car and locking it I began to see snow fall from the sky. Enchanted by the sight of snow for the first time (right lame I know) I heard the doors slide open. Wayne was staring at me with a smile that said ""You having fun?"" and somehow ""Hurry up."" Wayne: ""Having fun watching snowfall?"" It was said with a tone issuing patience was faltering. Kaitlyn: "" Right sorry I've never seen snow before just kinda caught me off guard."" responding on my way inside.

Wayne: ""First time seeing snow? Well, you are gonna see a lot of it this year."" I heard behind me heading for the backroom to clock in.

Walking in the TV was talking about the current storm coming in. It seemed a lot of the area was going to get hit including mine. obviously I'd tell myself looking out the window. Snapping back to reality I quickly clocked in the familiar click of the old-school punch card machine ringing. Then out to talk to Wayne I went. I was stalling too much at this point.

Kaitlyn: ""Alright I know you are in a hurry but give me the rundown."" I noticed he was already putting his coat on but no gloves like a true country boy.

Wayne: ""Well, I haven't been busy. Maybe four or five customers make sense with the party going on. Maybe take out the trash in an hour or so? It will give you something to do. But I have to leave"" He said heading for the door but stopped to turn to look at me. ""Kaitlyn again thank you for this. I appreciate it.""

And with that, he was gone and off to his car. His words gave me a surge of warmth. I just hope he didn't see how red my cheeks got. I watched his car leave from the window and began to look around the empty store. It was my first time being alone this late at night here and it was kind of peaceful. Walking over to the windows of the front of the store I watched the snow fall ever so slowly outside completely entranced with the small movements.

Snapping out of the little hypnosis the snowfall brought on me I began to walk the store seeing if Wayne had left anything for me to face. There were a few that seemed like he tried but was in a hurry which made sense. Fixing the small issues I made my way back to the storage area. Grabbing the push cart I piled an assortment of products on top of the exact number that I needed for the spots I'd seen open. My memory has always been next level. My mother used to tell me I made an elephant's memory look like a goldfish's. With that i went out and started placing the stock in its own place.

Placing the last can of dog food on the shelf letting it slip in on top of the other can locking them in, I nodded to myself as I heard the familiar sound of the front door opening. Standing up I look over and notice it's Alice, a friend i was supposed to meet at the party and it smacks me as I realized I never told the group I was going to be late if I didn't miss the party all together. I wave to her shyly as her eyes get big with a smile then the look of confusion on her face.

Alice: ‚ÄúKate why are you here? I thought you got tonight off for the party, remember?!‚Äù said with worry and irritation.

Kaitlyn: ‚ÄúYes yes i know trust me i know. But Wayne said he had a family emergency and he called me.‚Äù Feeling defeated as I pushed my cart to the front while she headed towards the back where the fridges with beer and other adult drinks were located..

She shook her head as she pulled out a twenty four pack of her favorite and made her way to the front.

Alice: ‚ÄúOh yes Mr country boy now it makes sense. You have been drooling over him since you got here. No, I get you girl just make sure he pays you back.‚Äù She said with a smile and a wink causing me to blush a little.

Just then another friend popped into the store. Her name was Heather. She came up asking why I was still here and I explained it to her just shorter this time because Alice cut me off saying ‚ÄúWayne‚Äù. Heather knew right off the bat and gave a very over exaggerated face and display, Causing all three of us to laugh a bit.

They turned around to leave as they made their way to the door. It swung open and one of the older locals came in a bit tipsy already. As the two girls walked past he stopped and watched them with the creepy smile only an old man could do and said out loud for everyone to hear.

Creepy Old Man: ‚ÄúIf I was forty years younger that would be the kind of tail I'd be chasing.‚Äù

Alice: ‚ÄúWhen you were our age you were chasing tails for the village to eat.‚Äù Alice had said as she scoffed at him.

They quickly left, leaving me alone with the man. He made his way slowly through the store after giving a non caring shrug. He made his way up to the counter and set his choice of candy and a beer in front of me and began fumbling for the cash he would need. Not much was said between us, I gave him the total and he gave me the cash. The change was exchanged and he turned around and left. And honestly i felt kind of insulted, i know i may not be the most attractive girl but he acted if i wasn't even there. I watched him walk out of the store and over to the side where the cars usually parked.

Walking out to grab my cart I felt a very uneasy feeling the kind you get that you are being watched. Like eyes somewhere are fixed on you like prey in the sights of a predator. I shivered at the feeling thinking maybe the old man was watching me. Maybe now he wanted to say something, looking around I didn't see anyone. But what caught my attention was across the street in the treeline where the snow lay piling up. Was a deer, he had no antlers but by his build it looked male. I'm not sure I'm from the city, but it felt like the deer was watching me. That made my skin crawl a bit too much and I made my way over to the window to see if I could get a better look. As I got to the window a car passed by at a high speed. It was the old man leaving finally but as he passed the deer as soon as the car was out of the line of sight the deer was gone. I was confused. I looked around the area to see if I just lost sight. But the deer was gone and no sign he was ever there.

I shook my head before noticing the buildup of snow and decided I should take out the trash now. Because if not then I would have to do it later in the deep snow. Heading for the back I stopped to grab the trash in the main register area replacing the bags. Then into the back I placed all the small bags I placed on the cart in the big trash. Pushing the cart back to its spot I pull out the big trash bag and make my way out back. I stop to admire the sight of the heavy falling snow. It was peaceful so serene movies or pictures never do it justice. A small quick rush of air brought me back and I headed over to the gate blocked trash can. I walked in between the two separated gates and lifted the lid up and over throwing the trash into the main dumpster then closed the lid. I dusted my hands off and nodded telling myself I did a good job.

The cold was settling in so I made my way outside the gated area to the main building. Stepping out only a few steps I was greeted with the sound of a sharp crash. Metal bending and scraping, it came from the shed next to me. My mind thought that the only thing it could be was a car who lost control had crashed into the side. I quickly ran over to the opposite side to help, I could hear what sounded like groaning. Maybe the old man had hit the shed? Sliding to a slow stop I looked to the now exposed side of the shed. There was no sign of impact, no sign of a car, glancing up I spotted the source of it all. The metal roof had caved in due to the snow fall. I'm sure after years of being out here it finally gave in and the wind moving the broken areas recreated the sound of groaning. Letting out a slight sigh, then went back inside.

Walking back I noticed all the lights flickering. And said to myself ‚Äúit's as if this place never deals with snow.‚Äù Entering the building I was met with the sound of the store's phone ringing. I quickly made my way over to answer the phone. Picking it up and answering it, I was met with the worried voice of Wayne.

Kaitlyn: ‚ÄúHello Thank you for calling Marties this is Kaitlyn how can i help you?‚Äù

Wayne: ‚ÄúKaitlyn it's Wayne, I saw the power flicker and I forgot to tell you about the Backup generator.‚Äù

Kaitlyn: ‚ÄùThat's kind of a big thing to forget about you know?‚Äù

Wayne: ‚ÄùYeah i know i'm sorry, but there is a panel in the backroom labeled ‚ÄúGenerator‚Äù all you have to do is make sure it's on setting two. That way if the power goes out and stays out for a bit it will kick on and the store will be good.‚Äù

Kaitlyn: ‚ÄúOh ok so setting two? How long will it last? And when are you coming back?‚Äù

Wayne: ‚ÄúYeah, setting two should last a few hours. If it goes out again, switch it to setting three. That's the backup tank; it's run off propane. And yeah, sorry, it's taking longer than I figured. I'm trying to get stuff situated here, but I'll text you and let you know when I'm on my way.‚Äù

And with that we said our goodbyes and I made my way to the back room. I was guessing the big complex power box with labels is what he meant. Reading over I found the correct switch and turned it over to two and heard an uneasy buzzing as things did what they needed to. The backroom didn't have much. There were the files, the panel, and the manager's computer. Jim told me the password a week ago in case I was on my break and wanted to watch the cameras. I typed in the password and pulled up the cameras. Looking over the options on the monitor I thought I spotted something out by the shed. It looked like the deer from earlier. And before I could get a better look a ring of a bell sounded from upfront causing me to look away for a moment. Glancing back the deer was gone and nothing in the snow showed footprints.

I walked up front and the local Mechanic/Carpenter Rod was standing out the counter bundled up with a coffee and snacks on the counter.

Rod: ‚ÄúWait you are here? Where‚Äôs Wayne?‚Äù He said a bit curious and surprised to see me.

Kaitlyn: ‚ÄúWell he had a family thing go down I guess so I'm here till he gets back. When I was supposed to be at the big party."" I said sort of sarcastically and he nodded, grabbing his card to pay for his things.

Rod: ‚ÄúI'm actually on my way out there now for a call. I guess some girl either got her car stuck or broke it somehow. Who knows with these kids.‚Äù he chuckled a bit, grabbing his stuff and heading for the door. He stopped by the door, turned around and pointed out the door. ‚ÄúThere's gonna be a guy named Sam he's gonna be here probably after a bit he's going around lookin‚Äô for sights for a bear. I guess people have reported something big trying to get into their houses. So if a guy shows up with a hunting rifle it's ok.‚Äù I thanked him as he finally exited and I stood there thinking about the possibility of seeing my first bear before shaking off the sudden fear that followed shortly after.

I remembered I could have told him about the caved in roof but by the time I got to the door he was already driving off. I let out a sign and returned back to the register and grabbed a notebook labeled ‚Äúimportant Notes‚Äù. It was there so that everyone on shift could read it for important notices or issues. It seemed nothing was new from the last time I saw it and I wrote about the issue with the shed. As I'm writing down in the notebook I had that feeling again that I was being watched. Like a strong uncomfortable feeling and it felt like it was being centered on the back of my neck. I tried to swat at it, maybe to make the feeling go away. But I turned around and saw nothing, just the wall with a clock and cigarettes on it. At this point of searching the wall a small sound caught my attention above me so I looked up at the plain ceiling tiles.

It sounded like something shuffling above but I brushed it off as just the snow moving and piling around on top. I made my way back to the storage area to grab a cleaner to clean the desk and windows. As I pushed the cart off to the side to reach for the cleaner, that's when I noticed that the sounds of shuffling above me seemed to follow where I was. Noticing this my heart began to race thinking maybe it was some creep who found his way into the ceiling and now he was watching me somehow. As my mind began to race with all kinds of possibilities it was interrupted with a loud and unsettling crash. It came from outside and I felt that if a car was going to crash into a shed that's what it would sound like.

Opening the back door I expected to see a destroyed shed and a smoking car. But what I saw was so much worse, with the flicking lights of the shed and lights from the main building you could see a clear sign of impact. It was midway up the shed with a clear sheen of a crimson red liquid. It was blood, it had to be blood. Hearing a sort of dragging sound I saw what seemed to be a pair of deer hooves being dragged into the gated trash area. As the feet vanished from sight it was met with another sound I will never forget. The best way to describe it is a few leaves of ice cold lettuce or cabbage that was slowly being twisted and bent causing the very distinct snapping sounds but somehow kept the sound of a juiciness to it. I was frozen in fear with everything that just happened. I thought maybe it was hit by a vehicle but it was too far away from the road to be flung that far. But then the conversation about the bear came into my mind and I began to back up. That's when the second sound hit my ears, it was very distinct like a cartoonish sound of a balloon full of slime that popped or the sound you expect from stepping into a bucket of semi melted butter. With that i quickly ran inside and locked the door my breathing heavy and labored.

Swiftly I made my way upfront and picked up the store's phone and called the police. I told them the bear was outside and that it was here the one people were talking about. And that it killed a deer in the trash area. They told me they were going to send people out and remain inside, maybe lock the door. They said with the snow coming in it's hard to get people out to my area at the moment. I groaned in frustration and made my way upfront after hanging up and turned off the auto function of the doors and locked them. Then I had an idea, I headed back to the counter and using a piece of paper I made a sign telling people to knock if they want in and that a bear is nearby.

Satisfied with my current choice I made my way to the drink station and poured hot water into a cup and then made my way down the aisles. I grabbed a package of hot chocolate and mixed it with the water before returning to the backroom to watch the cameras for this bear. I took a short cautious sip of the hot reassuring drink and placed it down while sitting at the computer. I shake the mouse to wake it up and it's the home screen. I double-clicked on the camera app, seems it closes on its own kind of weird. As the screens came into view I began to scan them and I found the one pointed towards the trash. There was no sign of the deer, or the bear and it seemed the blood on the shed was slowly being whisked away by the snow. I began to scan every other one top to bottom to see any hint of the screen thinking that maybe the bear got the creepy deer from earlier. Returning back to the original one I noticed something different, something moving. It was coming from behind the wall. It looked like branches of a tree slowly growing out and wrapping around the corner. As I bent in to somehow get a better look the sound of a knock jolted me causing me to knock over my drink. I placed napkins on the spilled liquid in a hurry and stood up the cup heading back out.

Standing at the door was an older Asian man I've never seen before but I suspected it was Sam. What gave it away was the surprisingly sized gun in his hand. Heading over, I unlocked the door and told him that the bear was outback by the trash. He nodded looking around and he told me to lock the door again. He was going to look around and see if he could find the beast. I told him about the dent in the shed and I thanked him. Watching him disappear behind the store I locked the door again. I stood there expecting the sound of a gun or shouting something. My heart quickened its pace as I waited. The wait wasn't too long because I heard something. It was the sound of an engine. Maybe a lawn mower? But what it was, was Sam on his snowmobile leaving the parking lot and down the road. Guess there was no bear and I was safe, hopefully.

I returned to the register, sat down in the chair and tried to gather my thoughts. What really helped me was the music playing from the speakers of the store. It's funny, they always play the same songs and sometimes I feel like I can tell you what time it is by the song playing. I guess I was so used to them that I never hear the songs unless I focus. And with that I began to laugh a small chuckle at first then full on laughter. I felt stupid i felt that I was overthinking everything. This isn't some cheesy movie or some over hyped TV show. This was reality everything has and had a logical explanation so far so i just needed to breathe. After the small mental break I let out a sigh of relaxation finally feeling better.

I looked down and saw my phone and picking it up I went onto social media to see how the party was going. Scrolling through there were pictures and videos of my friends seeming to have a great time. There was even a video of Rod fixing a drunk girl's car as she tried to hit on him. I smiled a bit watching it before continuing to scroll. I went through a few videos before my thumb stopped its doom scroll. It was a simple video of some girls at the party drinking and making sounds with no actual words. But that wasn't what stopped me, in the background of the video i spotted a deer by the tree line. And I could have sworn it was the same deer I was seeing outside and the one the bear had gotten. I know, how could I know what a deer looks like, especially from that far away. But it was a gut feeling along with the deer‚Äôs face. It looked stretched like someone was pulling on it, and the eyes seemed soulless and deep, very unsettling. I placed my phone down and placed my hands on my face when I noticed the post was only five minutes old.

With that I got up looking back at the clock. It's only been two hours since I've been here. So I needed something to eat. Maybe that would calm me down. Walking to the back to the premade food section I picked up a Turkey and Provolone sandwich. The great thing is that they were made from a deli in town and guessing by the expiration date we got them today. I smiled at it and grabbed a water heading for the register. I placed my items down and paid for them, even the hot chocolate packet I kept in my pocket. Sitting down in the chair I opened up the sandwich dressing it, then lifted it up to my mouth. I gave it a generous bite, as my mouth closed down on it I was met with a familiar but now unwelcoming sound of lettuce crunching. It threw me back to the scene outside, my stomach twisted and I ended up kneeling on the floor emptying out my stomach into the trash can. I tossed the sandwich into the trash and sat there catching my breath that the sound stole from me.

Sitting on the floor for a moment I heard a sound. It was a sound that raised my senses, it was the sound of something dropping on the floor in the store. I didn't hear anyone come in no wind or anything how could they with the doors locked. Slowly standing up I spotted a can slowly spinning in the middle of an isle. Looking past it I thought I saw something slink off to the side. And quickly stepping to the side to catch it there was nothing there. I shook my head gathering my nerves because there was nothing in here there was no way for anyone to be in here. So I walked out to the center of the isle where the now still can of dog food lay. I bent down and looked at it out of confusion and placed it back on top of the other watching it slide into place.

I figured maybe one of the few that came in moved it or something. Before standing up I looked forward towards the fridge doors and I froze every hair on my body standing at attention. In the reflection I could see something in the aisle next to me. It was massive, its body was the height of the shelves but it was crouched. And its eyes were ghostly white but I could feel they were searching for me. Then I could hear its breathing. It was heavy but held back like it was trying to hide it was there. It started to come towards the end of the aisle. Each movement causes the sound of a comb being lightly plucked. Tik Tik Tik is what I hear with every movement.

I started moving backwards slowly watching the reflection. It seemed the closer it got to the end the more blurry it got, not allowing me to get an actual good look at it. I don't know if it could see me in the reflection or if it could see me. But I had the sense that I was being watched again but from behind me. Were there two of them? How could something this big be so quiet and so stealthy. As I continued to back up I made the mistake of not watching where I was going and bumped into a section of chips. With the sudden noise I heard the breathing getting louder and closer and I knew it heard me and it was on its way. So I ran towards the counter, I could hear behind me the sound of it bashing into shelves as it ran. As I came close to the end of the aisle the shelf at the end came crashing down in front of me and with a scream I turned around and ran the opposite direction. I could feel it behind me, the sense of its eyes were burning into the back of my skull. I swear I could feel its breath nipping at my neck.

Turning at the end of the isle my shoulder caught the rack and sliced my arm open. I made it a bit down the first section before I stopped. I could feel the warm sensation of my blood leaking from my arm. And from behind me was the sound of licking, it was the kind of noise an annoying younger sibling would make to annoy you with the greedy licking and slurping of an ice cream you wanted but they got. Each sloppy lick was met with the sound of the plucking of a comb. I wanted to turn around to see with my own eyes what was chasing me now that it was busy with a taste of me. But every part of my body told me not to turn around, not to look. The lights above my head began to flicker and go out. With it came the silence. There was no more licking and I felt the spine tingling feeling of the eyes behind me so I bolted. I didn't make it far before my feet were swept from under me causing me to tumble to the ground. I felt the sensation of blood leaving my body again now from my ankle. I tried getting up, tried getting away but I was swatted again, this time into the shelves.

Pain shot up through my body as I now lay in the next aisle, my spine feeling as if I fell from a rooftop, and my side feeling as if I got punched by a professional boxer. I knew it was almost on top of me. I could smell it now. It was as if the sewers of a city were condensed into a small spray bottle and a child got a hold of it spraying it all over your face. I tried to move as fast as I could to the end of the aisle but I was met with the weight of a shelf crashing down on top of me. And to my horror I felt its weight being applied on top of it. The plucking of the comb ever so loud now, I could sense its face next to mine. I knew I should have gone to the party, that I should have been selfish. I'm sure whatever Wayne is dealing with is not worth my life. But here I was because I wanted this boy to like me. Now I'm going to die alone in the dark by the means of this monster. I finally felt its breath on my neck and that's when I heard it. The sound of snapping lettuce, my only thought was that it was its jaw slowly opening to consume me. I couldn't look at it, I didnt wanna open my eyes, I didnt wanna see it coming.

But as soon as everything started it stopped, I was met with a blinding white light. I expected to be dead, that I made it to heaven. Then I heard knocking. It was quiet in the distance at first. It slowly grew in volume until it was loud and banging in my head as well. Slowly opening my eyes and looking towards the source I spotted Wayne and a police officer at the main door. Wayne Finally got the door open and when they opened the door I heard the officer calling for an ambulance. Reaching me, Wayne lifted off the shelf from my body. While the officer tried to clear more around me. Realizing the beast could still be around I tried to quickly get up and warn them but my body winced and didn't want to move. I looked over to the officer and told him it was still in here.

The Officer quickly pulled out his gun and began to search the area. Wayne had gently lifted my head up onto his lap while we waited, my arm still bleeding, I heard the officer come back saying there was no sign of anything. He traded places with Wayne upon request and heading towards the back office the power was soon restored. He came back saying the first tank was empty. With the lights coming on I was blinded again I wasn't sure how long I was out for. By the time the ambulance arrived, my arm and ankle was being wrapped up as I tried telling both of them everything that had happened, both looking at me unsure of my story. I groaned out of frustration watching the cop leave to get the paramedics. Then I remembered something I shot up with a wince and shouted ‚ÄúThe Cameras!‚Äù. And I made my way to the backroom Wayne trying to stop me. But this was my chance to prove this wasn't just some bear. I quickly sat down and shook the mouse to wake up the computer. But nothing happened, I remember the power went out so I reached down to turn on the switch and pressed it. But I was met with the feeling of wetness and no power. Looking down in confusion the hot chocolate wasn't fully stopped by the napkins and had leaked into the computer frying it.

I sat there defeated, shortly after the paramedics showed up with a stretcher guided by Wayne. As they wheeled me out I told them to wait and waved over the cop.

Kaitlyn: ‚ÄúHey did you check for the deer by the trash?‚Äù I said with some kind of hope in my voice.

Officer: ‚ÄúYeah I looked and there is a deer back there alright, in very bad shape. I'm guessing it got hit by a commercial truck in a hurry trying to get ahead of the snowfall. It seems it did not suffer long because the heart seems to have exploded. Least that's what I can guess from the mess.‚Äù

Laying back in the stretcher devoid of any more will, I waited for the Paramedics to load me up into the ambulance. That's when I noticed a trail of tracks leading from the store to the tree line. And it seemed every print was of a different animal and that's when I saw the backend of a deer vanish into the treeline.

I was treated at the hospital and the whole situation was written off as a bear attack. A few people have gone missing from the party and they still haven't found any traces of them. Wayne did make it up to me, He showed up almost everyday I was in the hospital with some kind of homemade dish. They weren't that good but he tried, and said he was sorry every time. He told me the situation was his drunken father causing issues at home. And he went home to protect his mother and sisters. He said his father is in rehab and doing better.

But now I'm sitting here in my room at my computer typing this all out for all of you so that my story can get out there. So that others can be warned that there is something out there, something watching. But as I'm almost finished writing this the sound of a comb being plucked has started in my closet and it's been getting louder. With the same uneasy feeling I'm being Watched.",1,1734471985.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

First of all, thanks for checking out my post.  
Now it's time for the part where I try to convince you to send me a message and start a conversation.

3 - I‚Äôm Scottish! I was born in a small town in Scotland. I've travelled a lot and was lucky enough to have a fun job when I was younger that let me see the world.

4 - I‚Äôm currently working as an engineering technician. I accidentally fell into this job and I really can‚Äôt complain too much. I spend most of the week working from home, drinking tea/coffee and lurking in the background of Zoom meetings while trying to figure out how to do something a little bit more exciting for work.

8 - I also like to sink some time into games. I have a backlog that I‚Äôm never ever going to get through. I've just started Stardew Valley again so that's me doomed.

Why am I posting on Reddit? I'm here for some fun casual conversation. I miss the social aspect of being at shows and meeting new people so making friends and having conversations on here scratches that itch.

# On Bamboo Ceilings

# Things I wish I‚Äôd known earlier in my career about being Asian in America

I‚Äôve had to teach myself a great deal about the culture of the United States since moving here over a decade and a half ago. Some of the culture shocks landed immediately, like the wearing of shoes indoors (!) while others took a few more awkward interactions to figure out, like the fact that when Americans ask you ‚ÄúHow‚Äôre you doing?‚Äù you‚Äôre not actually being invited to give them a run down of how your day went. But by far the most consequential cultural challenges I‚Äôve had to navigate have come from my professional life. At McKinsey, as at most professional services firms where reviews and promotions occur in rapid 6-month cycles, my odds of advancement rested on my ability to achieve an accelerated mastery of things you‚Äôre just supposed to know, i.e., corporate America‚Äôs hidden curriculum.

For those of us who didn‚Äôt grow up in corporate America‚Äôs dominant culture, the difficulties involved in achieving this mastery are manifold. Culture, to paraphrase Roland Barthes, consists of ‚Äúthings that go without saying.‚Äù Assuming you‚Äôve realized that your challenges have a cultural component (no mean feat in itself), the fact that dominant cultural norms are just accepted by the majority as common sense means that you not only don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt know, but also that those who do know can‚Äôt explain it to you. Moreover, we don‚Äôt arrive in America tabula rasa, but with our own cultures that we‚Äôve been steeped in from birth. Trying to unlearn or fight our own cultural conditioning head-on would take far too long, and often feels inauthentic. Instead, what‚Äôs required are ways of reframing our challenges in ways that enable us to work with, rather than against, our cultural scripts in a fashion that feels both productive and true. What I‚Äôve written below are a series of five reframes that have been most helpful to me and those I‚Äôve coached and mentored over the years.

Before I begin, an important caveat: Asians in America are not a monolith, and my use of the label ‚ÄúAsian‚Äù in these reflections isn‚Äôt intended to flatten an entire continent‚Äôs worth of linguistic and cultural diversity. At one extreme of specificity, my experience is one of being an ethnically East Asian (Chinese) recent immigrant to the United States from a Southeast Asian (Singaporean) country. But I offer up my story here on the wager that what I‚Äôve learned can be helpful not only to people of my specific circumstances, but also to those who‚Äôve grown up in cultures with similar features. I regret the limits of this necessary generalization ‚Äî but on the off chance that others will recognize themselves (or others they manage) in these words and find succor, it‚Äôs a risk I‚Äôm willing to take.

# 1: You‚Äôre not shy, you just hold yourself to a different bar

Six months into my first year at McKinsey, I was given the feedback that I needed to ‚Äúspeak up‚Äù more. When I asked how I could improve, the advice I got amounted to different versions of ‚Äújust do it,‚Äù which is helpful when you‚Äôre selling sportswear, but less so when ‚Äúdoing it‚Äù is precisely the difficulty. It‚Äôs true that I didn‚Äôt speak as much as my colleagues did in meetings, but I couldn‚Äôt figure out what was holding me back ‚Äî while I‚Äôm an introvert, I‚Äôm hardly shy, and most of my friends would probably prefer that I be less assertive, not more. As a first-year associate, the feedback sent me into a weeks-long tailspin where I kept searching myself for the personality defect that was preventing me from ""speaking up,‚Äù which of course did little to improve how I was showing up in the team room since I was in my head so much.

The unlock didn‚Äôt come until I met up with some of my colleagues of Asian descent. None of us are what I‚Äôd consider shy or unopinionated, but we‚Äôd somehow all gotten the same feedback to ‚Äúspeak up‚Äù more. Our mutual commiseration helped me realize that the problem wasn‚Äôt shyness, a lack of confidence, or an absence of opinions, but rather a cultural default we shared that imposes a high bar on speaking up. For those of us who share this default, who gets to ‚Äúspeak up‚Äù in a given situation is not determined by being in possession of an opinion, but by having the right position ‚Äî that is, a position of authority, seniority, and expertise. While my non-Asian colleagues simply had to traverse the straight line between having an opinion and voicing it, I was subjecting every opinion that popped into my head to a complex analysis of whether I was in a qualified position to offer it at all.

This reframing of ‚Äúspeaking up‚Äù as a question of position rather than personality was game-changing for me. In absolute terms, it may be a while before you stop being the youngest, most junior person on the team, and unless you actually are shy, trying to be less shy won‚Äôt work, since it was never the problem to begin with. What helped me and others I‚Äôve worked with unlock the ability to speak up in situations like these is leaning into the places of our relative expertise, authority, and seniority ‚Äî the Excel model that you spent the week building and that only you know the ins and outs of, the nuances of the client conversation that only you were part of, the detailed research on the industry that only you performed. The next time you find yourself feeling unqualified to speak up, remember what you do know better than everyone else in the room, and create your own permission to speak up. These positions of relative power are always available to you, no matter how inexperienced or junior you are, because you‚Äôre the only one who‚Äôs done your job.

# 2: Your actions will not speak for themselves

For those of us who grew up in families that didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù how did you know that you were loved? If your parents were anything like mine, love was never spoken but instead found in the sliced fruit that appeared in your room at regular intervals, the constant reminders to wear a jacket and keep warm, the money spent on your extracurriculars instead of things they needed ‚Ä¶ and so forth. Consciously or unconsciously, the cultural script we internalize from such an upbringing necessarily attunes us to the emotional force of the unsaid ‚Äî we learn how to recognize it in the actions of others, and how to communicate it with our own. In a culture where an action can speak volumes, it is not only unnecessary to verbalize its meaning, but often seen as a cheapening of its sincerity.

The problem is that most of us in America will never work in an organization where this is the cultural default. When I first became a manager, I supported my team in the only way I knew how: by spending time with them, teaching them what I knew, and advocating fiercely for them in their performance reviews. Imagine my surprise when my 360 feedback indicated that my main area of improvement was that I needed to offer more verbal praise and acknowledgement. This feedback left me feeling angry, frustrated and under-appreciated. Wasn‚Äôt it obvious from the care I showed my teams that I appreciated them, and why on earth did I have to spell it out? If you can imagine how your Asian dad would react if you dared to complain about his lack of emotional effusiveness, that‚Äôs exactly how I reacted initially. The reframe that ultimately helped me was the realization that I worked with colleagues who didn‚Äôt share my cultural scripts, and so didn‚Äôt share the same sensitivity to the unsaid that I did. It wasn‚Äôt that my teams didn‚Äôt appreciate what I did for them, it was simply that they hadn‚Äôt been steeped in a culture that would‚Äôve enabled them to register the unspoken care and regard I intended (this is analogous to Gary Chapman‚Äôs concept of the five love languages).

But it isn‚Äôt just our love for our teams that‚Äôs potentially getting lost in translation - it‚Äôs everything we keep doing for our employers that we imagine speaks volumes about how deserving we are of career advancement, even though it really doesn‚Äôt. The additional responsibilities we take on without complaint, the late nights and weekends we quietly work to help our teams get ahead, the second shift of ‚Äúextracurriculars‚Äù we take on to be a good team player ‚Äî all the ways we tell our jobs that we love them, while we wait for them to notice and love us back, and grow frustrated when they don‚Äôt. If this is the position you‚Äôre in, reframing the issue as one of cultural translation means that career advancement doesn‚Äôt require you to do any more than you already are (phew!), but it does require you to take the extra step of saying to your colleagues why and how it all matters ‚Äî because your workplace isn‚Äôt an Asian family, and your actions will not speak for themselves.

# 3: Being ‚Äúeasy to work with‚Äù is not the asset you think it is

Growing up Chinese in Singapore, it often seemed to me and my peers that one of the worst social transgressions any of us could commit was to ‚Äústand out‚Äù in any way. The specific reasons for which one might ‚Äústand out‚Äù didn‚Äôt particularly matter ‚Äî it was considered just as unseemly to publicize one‚Äôs virtues as it was to achieve notoriety for one‚Äôs faults. Indeed, the Chinese proverb ‚ÄúÊú®ÁßÄ‰∫éÊûó, È£éÂøÖÊëß‰πã‚Äù attributed to writer and politician Li Kang of the Three Kingdoms period literally reminds us that it is the tree that grow tallest that most risks being toppled by the wind. Of course, the prohibition against ‚Äústanding out‚Äù didn‚Äôt preclude us from being ambitious. But it did mean that we understood the path to power and influence as requiring the maintenance of an artful optical illusion in which one demonstrated competence while drawing as little attention to oneself as possible. Consider, for instance, the recently named successor to Singapore‚Äôs Prime Minister ‚Äî often described in the press as ‚Äúunassuming‚Äù and ‚Äúextremely easy to work with,‚Äù he had, until he was tapped for role, repeatedly denied having any designs on the prime ministership, and opened his first press conference as heir apparent by stating that he had ‚Äúnever hankered for post, position, or power.‚Äù

If you grew up in a culture similar to the one I describe, then it‚Äôs likely that you too have honed to perfection this disappearing act. By the time I arrived in the U.S. at the age of 21, it had become a point of pride for me to be ‚Äúeasy to work with‚Äù ‚Äî that is, to take up as little space as possible with my wants or ambitions because I truly believed that only a maximum of competence and a minimum of visibility would pave the way for my success. Imagine my surprise when the feedback I received from the powers-that-be was that while I was indeed ‚Äúeasy to work with,‚Äù no one really knew what to do with me, much less recommend me for advancement opportunities, because I had never made clear what I wanted for my career. It wasn‚Äôt only that I was mistaken in believing that being small would help me succeed, but also that it felt viscerally dangerous for me to call attention to myself by, say, advocating for my own professional development or asserting the value of my own strengths. I still recall vividly how having to write ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements in the paperwork for my performance reviews gave me a pit in my stomach as a first-year associate, as well as the awkward passive sentences I used as substitutes, which obviously did me no favors.

How do you overcome a lifetime of cultural conditioning that makes advocating for yourself at work feel like courting disaster ‚Äî like an overgrown tree asking to be cut down by the wind? The reframe that‚Äôs worked for me is realizing that whatever we may feel we risk by taking up space with our ambitions and wants, we risk all the more by making ourselves small. In a corporate culture where everything is on the surface and everyone‚Äôs strengths and designs on career advancement are on full technicolor display, an individual‚Äôs absence of visible ambition is more likely to be experienced by others as apathy (at best) or hypocrisy and dissembling (at worst) than as humility. In other words, when transposed to the context of corporate America, the cultural scripts that we‚Äôve internalized to keep us safe from social censure are precisely the ones that inspire in others the greatest misgivings about us. You don‚Äôt have to wait until it feels safe to advocate for yourself professionally or stake a claim to the advancement you want, because that moment is not going to come any time soon. You just have to remember that by remaining small, it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôve already provoked the professional extinction you were hoping to avoid in the first place. Put simply, your smallness will not save you ‚Äî so grow tall, my friends.

# 4: You can take control of how others tell your story

By now, it is common knowledge that even individuals with egalitarian beliefs are apt to use unconsciously gendered language in performance reviews to the detriment of their female colleagues. Indeed, one of the first training sessions I attended at McKinsey was a workshop on how to avoid exactly this genre of unconscious bias, where the same behaviors that earn men praise for ‚Äútaking charge‚Äù and ‚Äúhaving initiative‚Äù get labeled ‚Äúabrasiveness‚Äù and ‚Äúaggression‚Äù when exhibited by women. To my knowledge, there has not been any systematic research into a similar phenomenon that applies to Asian professionals. At the time, I didn‚Äôt remark on the absence of any training on unconscious racial bias when it came to colleagues of my ethnic and cultural origin. At any rate, I figured that the stereotypes associated with employees who looked like me tended to be positive (at least at the entry level ‚Äî but more on this shortly).

Roughly two years into my time as an associate, however, I began to observe a subtle pattern forming in the feedback that I was receiving. It took me a while to notice because it sounded very much like praise ‚Äî for my problem-solving skills, for my conscientiousness, for the high quality of my work, and so forth. It didn‚Äôt occur to me that I might be headed for a problem until I discerned the complete absence of any references to the skills that actually get associates promoted to manager, like leadership and relationship building. It wasn‚Äôt that I wasn‚Äôt taking every opportunity to demonstrate these skills, but that everyone‚Äôs attention was trained elsewhere (albeit on what they considered my strengths). This left me in a quandary: how was I supposed to respond to feedback that wasn‚Äôt serving me without upsetting those who thought they were praising me? There was also no small amount of doubt and self-minimization on my part, as surely ‚Äúreceiving the wrong kind of praise‚Äù can‚Äôt count as a real problem in a world where women and other minorities have to deal with actual negative bias?

After months of faffing about, the devastatingly simple solution came to me in a moment of uncharacteristic boldness. On the receiving end once again of feedback from a partner that I was a ‚Äúproblem-solving whiz‚Äù who could ‚Äúdo anything with numbers,‚Äù I thanked him and pointed out that (a) while he may believe he was paying me a compliment, he would in fact be doing me a disservice if he repeated those words to a review committee who would simply take those strengths as table stakes for someone of my background, and (b) I wondered if he had anything to say about my leadership and relationship building skills? I‚Äôm not sure what possessed me to be so bold, and I absolutely wished in that moment that the ground would open up and swallow me whole ‚Äî but I will also never forget the look on his face when I said that, or the way he responded after. To his credit, he took no offense but genuinely welcomed my feedback on how I experienced the feedback he was giving me ‚Äî which, I suspect, is how most people leaders who don‚Äôt have any intention of being biased would respond. He not only did have positive feedback to provide on my leadership and relationship-building skills, but also offered to work with me in the coming weeks to make sure that I would have enough opportunities to demonstrate them in ways he could relay to the review committee.

My promotion to manager came just 2 - 3 months later, but I took away from this moment a reframe to last a lifetime: Although workplace feedback may often feel like a judgment on your qualities handed down to you from ‚Äúon high,‚Äù it is really nothing more than the sum of the stories that people tell about you. It may take a little boldness and some gumption, but you don‚Äôt have to acquiesce to being the object of the feedback you receive, like a character in a story told by others in a foreign language ‚Äî you can take control of the narrative and teach others how you want your story to be told.

# 5: It‚Äôs not personal, but prove them wrong anyway

Midway through my tenure as a manager, which is right around the time where consultants start to get sized up for their propensity to succeed as future partners of the Firm, I began to receive a peculiar genre of feedback that went something like this (and I paraphrase): ‚ÄúYou are very credible with clients and are an excellent communicator, especially when it pertains to the work you‚Äôre doing. However, we would like to see evidence that you can build relationships with clients that extend beyond the day-to-day.‚Äù When I asked the powers-that-be for more specificity as to what sort of behaviors I was being asked to perform, the responses that I got amounted to something like ‚Äúmaybe take your clients out for coffee‚Äù and ‚Äútalk to them about something other than the work you‚Äôre doing.‚Äù

I sat on that feedback for over an entire year without doing much of anything about it, which is an eternity in McKinsey time. Part of my hesitation had to do with the sheer idiocy of the feedback I was receiving (I apologize, there really is no other way to say it). Were the powers-that-be really trying to tell me that I was a credible client counselor and communicator but they needed to know whether I knew how to relate to people outside of work? Do they not think that I have friends? Do they think that outside of work I‚Äôm a troll who lives under a bridge? I kept trying to find a way to work with the feedback productively, but couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I was being asked to prove that I could ‚Äúmake friends and not alienate people‚Äù (to paraphrase Dale Carnegie). It‚Äôs not that I disagreed that ‚Äúmaking friends‚Äù was an important part of the job or that I actually doubted my ability to do so ‚Äî but that I couldn‚Äôt get over the complete inanity of being asked to prove that I could. It was like being asked to retrace my steps and prove that I had the social developmental skills of a four year old before I would be considered worthy of the partnership.

After over a year of unhelpful fuming about this feedback, I finally decided it was time to do something about it. Towards the end of my time as a manager, I was staffed on an engagement where an urgent need came up that required consultants to travel to the client site. Since we were in the middle of a pandemic, no one wanted to make the trip ‚Äî sensing an opportunity, I volunteered as tribute. As part of this trip, I made sure to get coffee and dinners scheduled with senior clients, during which I (naturally) talked about topics other than work. Upon my return, I made sure to relay the effect of these conversations and what I had learned from them to multiple people I could be sure would attest to the fact. By my next review cycle, I was being celebrated for my ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù client influencing skills and well on my way to being promoted to associate partner, and we never spoke of that absurd piece of feedback again.

I will never be able to prove that the feedback was rooted in a racial stereotype, so I leave it to you to decide whether a white, male mid-career consultant from the American Midwest would‚Äôve been given the same feedback. What I will say is that for most of my 5 years at McKinsey, there was only one male partner who looked like me in the Bay Area office, a complex of 1,000+ consultants and 100+ partners in a region with the highest relative population of Asian / Asian-Americans in the continental U.S. At any rate, none of this has any bearing on the final reframe I offer you, which is that if you find yourself in a similar situation, the best thing you can do is to refuse to take it personally, and find the most efficient, timely way to prove them wrong anyway. It will mean that you will have to work twice as hard to prove half as much, and that this will sometimes feel personally offensive to you ‚Äî but there are scant alternatives (at least for the moment). It is not lost on me that this reframe, like all of the ones that come before, involve no small amount of effort on the part of Asian professionals to work within the constraints of the ‚Äúbamboo ceiling,‚Äù while for the most part leaving those barriers intact. If you find yourself in a situation similar to the one I describe, I am not saying that you shouldn‚Äôt get angry (you absolutely should!) or demand that your employers do better (ditto!), but I am saying that even as we continue the necessary labor of provoking wholesale, systemic change, that change is going to take time ‚Äî and your career cannot wait. Until that long-awaited change comes, I hope you will find in these words something to help you stay in the fight.",6,1734471856.0,aznidentity,1,0.88,False

I was on my way to work a few weeks ago- I‚Äôve since found a new job since the manager scheduled me one week at this place (coffee shop) and then never scheduled me again and told me I‚Äôd be ‚Äúon call‚Äù. That‚Äôs not what I signed up for, so I found another full time job and quit. 

But at this time this job was all I had, so I was on my way to work, and was on a single lane road (so no passing), and I was behind this car going 15-20 under the limit. I move up a little and give a tiny wake up honk, but they don‚Äôt budge, so I figure I just have to wait until I can pass. 

Then a semi behind me gets way too close, acting like they‚Äôre going to hit me, and they do NOT slow down. They can obviously see I‚Äôm not the one going slow on purpose. I freak out as they move closer and closer, not stopping, and thinking quickly I pull to the side of the road, so I‚Äôm practically in the grass, and of course I hear the horrible crunch of metal when the semi rams the slowpoke. 

I wasn‚Äôt hit, nor did I hit anyone else. I was perfectly fine thanks to thinking quickly enough. I still have to get to work though so I text the group chat that there was an accident in front of me but I‚Äôm still coming.

1hglgxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hglgxj/ms_a_prisoner_a_spy/,[MS] A Prisoner & A Spy,"Abigail Clarke stood up abruptly and paced around the table towards the spy. Bound to the table with stainless steel handcuffs and legcuffs, he wore the neon yellow jumpsuit of a first-week inmate.

Just the sight of him, Abigail could scarcely contain her temper.

What could possibly be so funny about this situation?

This man had been caught with class J party secrets on his way to Old Ohio, The Unclaimed Zone. Abigail was meant to find where he stashed them, although she herself only had B clearance.

As she approached, a glob of sweat was ejected from her forehead and landed directly on the spy‚Äôs eyebrow. His eye displayed some sort of involuntary reflexive reaction, but then he just continued smirking.

Despite his situation, the prisoner‚Äôs demeanor was cool and casual. He wore a look of contained amusement that seemed almost like pity. Abigail despised him with the essence of her being. She got within inches of his relaxed, almost lethargic, eyes and shouted ‚ÄùTell us where the disk is!‚Äù

His reaction barely registered on the Moser-dennet brain monitor. It wasn‚Äôt so much a shrug as it was a readjustment in how he sat. Abigail stayed in close, keeping eye contact.

Usually, in a more nervous prisoner, Abigail expected a long pause like this to lead to confession, or at least further noticeable psychological breakdown.

This man was a brick wall. And how was he keeping cool?

Abigail remembered changing the thermostat during the break. She even had her party member exclusive climate-aware fabric pantsuit.

Usually, in just about any prisoner Abigail had remembered interrogating, this technique led to the prisoner sweating bullets, as Abigail came off as cool and comfortable.

She held her close-in, rage-fueled stare for almost 20 seconds, in silence. The prisoner may have let out a yawn, but little else.

Abigail needed a break. She turned to the guard bot, and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna take a tight five. See if you can loosen him up with a few shock beams. Level 8 this time.‚Äù

As she left the room, she heard 3 shocks, each followed by a distinct scream.

After a short silence, she heard whimpering coming from the interrogation room as she made her way to the break room.

She saw Martin Simmons at the coffee machine. It seemed to be broken again, and he was already on his way to a true and healthy rage.

Martin had male pattern baldness and the sort of beer belly rarely seen in this day and age. Abigail knew he was eighty-two years old, but saw that despite his scalp and gut, he looked like a man in his mid forties.

This was in thanks, no doubt, to the party‚Äôs known anti-aging techniques, and the dispelling of aging cells via regular furious outburst, as recommended by the health authority.

As Martin hit the machine, which was already broken, Abigail went to the storage closet and grabbed a new one from a shelf which contained 12 coffee machines for the break room. Those were just for the rest of the week.

After getting the replacement and setting it down on the counter, Abigail approached Martin and offered to join in.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt fucking get it do you?‚Äù Martin said, the anger from his frenzy falling to a cold resentment as he spoke, exasperated.

‚ÄúOf course I do!‚Äù Abigail said with a smirk. ‚ÄúThe Coffee machine broke down, as it is designed to, yet that is always a rage signal. I destroyed one just last week! It was quite glorious.‚Äù

Martin almost smiled. ‚ÄúWhy is it that we need to break a dozen coffee machines per week in the first place, Abby?‚Äù

Abigail‚Äôs eyebrows curled down in an exaggerated and hateful glare. ‚ÄúWell Marty, as I‚Äôm sure you know,‚Äù her eyes softened, her expression was that of a true believer, ‚Äúthe rage is good. We want the rage. We need the rage. But we are not to hurt our fellow party members.‚Äù

She took the nearly-destroyed coffee machine and threw it on the ground. It shattered satisfyingly into quite small pieces of plasti glass.

In one smooth motion, Abigail plugged in the replacement and flipped a switch on the wall, which activated the floor vacuum, eliminating the mess. ‚ÄúNow be a dear and fix us a pot. I have to get back to my meeting. You know, it‚Äôs the strangest thing. No matter how high I turn the thermo, I simply cannot get this prisoner to sweat. Has that ever happened to you, Martin?‚Äù

Martin looked back to her as he fussed with the coffee machine. He turned quickly from alarm, to puzzlement, to recognition.

‚ÄúOh right that‚Äôs today. Look, Abby, I don‚Äôt know how much of this you‚Äôll remember, but just know that the others and I, we‚Äôll still be here with you, no matter how it goes. Everyone breaks. ‚Äù He handed her a cup of coffee.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean Martin?‚Äù

Abigail then took a sip of coffee and was immediately struck by a sudden wave of both deja vu and vertigo. She steadied herself on the counter, waves of emotion and memory flooding her brain. She felt she had to rage.

The 5 minute timer bell rang. Martin looked up, and then to Abigail. ‚ÄúLooks like your break is up. Good luck, Abby.‚Äù She looked at him with a sudden recognition. Martin Simmons, her father‚Äôs best friend. His partner on the Capital Force for years. And now here she was working side by side with him.

Or was he Martin Simmons, the former terrorist, rehabilitated via rage mapper in this very building?

No, she was quite sure he was Martin Simmons from accounting, who had helped her get her anger insurance deductible lowered, and guided her through a fury 401k application. He held excellent dinner parties at his chic apartment, and invited the whole office. Even Cindy. His wife Ellen made delicious margaritas, and their home had a very high end irate-tainment center.

It occurred to her that she felt a warm regard for the man, and didn‚Äôt much care for how she originally had met him.

She smiled and headed back towards the interrogation room.

Abigail returned to the bound man and the guard bot. The room felt even hotter than when she left. Had she adjusted the thermostat again? She couldn‚Äôt recall.

She turned to the far wall, over 80% of which was made up of an advanced one way mirror. She looked towards it and took a sip of coffee. ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt *he* sweating yet?‚Äù she said to the anonymous crowd in the viewing room.

Abigail staggered as more memories came flooding into her. There were more than made sense. Contradicting memories, alternate lives.

She remembered a life where she had always lived in this building.

She remembered a life where she had moved to this facility only weeks ago as an intern.

She remembered a tank where she slept, and was trained via unconscious signals and hypnopedic recordings, preparing her for a special job, ostensibly to serve the party.

But the most powerful recollection she experienced was her, driving a dilapidated old gas-burning vehicle, on the decayed highway, which still had years-disused signage indicating it as ‚Äú79‚Äù on the border of the unclaimed lands.

She could feel the vehicle rattling as she pushed the acceleration to the floor. She could hear the sounds of sirens and helicopters behind her. She re-lived the anxiety, and the push of urgency, just to get to the border.

She remembered the smoke. At first a slow trickle, then a column that made it impossible to see the road ahead. The vehicle broke down, but had enough momentum so that she could pull it over on the side of the road.

She remembered seeing the disk and grabbing it before running from the vehicle. She remembered running for hours before seeing anything recognizable. She snapped out of it. Took a sip of her coffee, and placed it calmly on the table.

‚ÄúWhere is Pinchfield farm?‚Äù she said to the prisoner.

For the first time she could recall, the man did look a bit excited, or even nervous. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Abigail, where is it?‚Äù

Abigail stared at him for a moment, grabbed her coffee and sipped. How did he know her name?

She remembered the training in telepathy, mind reading, and empathic mapping. She looked deeply into the man‚Äôs apathetic eyes and felt the memories rush back.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs right off of the old route seventy nine!‚Äù She exclaimed.

‚ÄúYou hid the disk there!‚Äù She pointed to him.

The man continued to smirk in his relaxed, aloof way, as Abigail began sweating even more. He turned his head. ‚ÄúOk I‚Äôll bite. Where on the farm did I hide it?‚Äù

Abigail had the entire memory now. She took another sip of her coffee, noticing a drop of sweat land in the cup as she drank. She looked to the false mirror.

‚ÄúHe hid the disk in the farm house. Next to the larger, more dilapidated barn, the house has an outdoor entrance to a basement. This man hid the disk in a decades-old collection of very similar looking music disks. He removed a copy of something called ‚ÄòAbbey Road‚Äô, which is what he had on him when we apprehended him. He took the memory wipe pill right after that.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid I?‚Äù he asked, ‚Äúand why do you suppose I chose that specific album?‚Äù

Abigail dropped her coffee on the floor. The porcelain and coffee exploded out, staining Abigail‚Äôs shoes. In that same moment, the prisoner stood up and unlocked his own handcuffs.

The guard bot approached Abby as she stared at the puddle of coffee on the ground, realizing the true nature of her relationship with this facility.

More memories came flooding, so many obviously false idyllic fantasies, that finally her actual life as a thought smuggler became more apparently true, for it was the only one where she had her own name, Abby. Not Abigail. Abby. Martin knew.

The prisoner, the spy, her interrogator, her savior, walked over as the guard bot cuffed Abigail. He turned to the false mirror and said ‚ÄúAlright and that‚Äôs lunch‚Äù as he left the room.",1,1734471306.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Many corners.
Corners are everything and nothing 
Never the same size or width
Time or space. Like you and me

Corners are the successful and unfortunate 
Banished to my corner small but large in size
I starve. Starve I do.
Many weeks a day goes bye
The time is slow yet fast. 

The coffee I chug helps, Or does it?
I chug chug away in my flabby corner
The lard depletes as regret fills the space.
I chug chug more coffee to forget my issues

Just like my mother with the red fermented juices
My and her corner are the same, seemingly
But mine is filled with the scars of my story
Whilst hers are only the scars of stretch marks
One of almost the same.

My corner shakes of many of times
Like and earthquake as people invade
Sitting in my corner and space.
The corner had been destroyed from the start

From the hands that ripped the innocence away
The blame is me and you and everyone else
Taking away like the screen takes my corner
The light strains me. Ironic still as now.
As I express through the very thing that causes me pain.

The fact others corners are worse
Grateful grateful grateful 
Bull does and destroyed other corners lay
But true words don't always save the day.

Theses days may be my last
Anger fills my heart
A still shiver down my spine
As I count the days wishing for this to be my last ryhme.",1,1734471142.0,Vent,1,1.0,False
1hgleaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1hgleaz/aita_for_deciding_not_to_buy_a_gift_this_year/,AITA for deciding not to buy a gift this year?,"I‚Äôm a 30-year-old man, and I‚Äôve decided not to buy my sister (27F) a Christmas gift this year. Our relationship has always been complicated. Since childhood, we‚Äôve had a rivalry that, while common between siblings, left lasting scars. She was always the favorite, taking part in classes and competitions she wanted, while I, despite having the same opportunities, didn‚Äôt pursue them because I‚Äôm more introverted. Over time, this created a distance between us.

Last year, however, I tried to mend things. I was dealing with depression and thought it would be a good idea to open up to her. I invited her for coffee and explained that I wanted our relationship to improve, that I didn‚Äôt want to lose my sister. It was an emotional moment‚Äîshe accepted in tears, and for a while, things seemed to get better. I even moved back home for work reasons, and our relationship seemed calmer.

That Christmas, I decided to do something meaningful: I restored and digitized old childhood videos of us as kids. It was a gift that took a lot of time, effort, and money, but I wanted to show that I was willing to make an effort to strengthen our bond.

This year (2024), she opened a new business and asked me to work on the branding for her brand. I saw it as an opportunity to support her and rebuild our relationship further. From the start, I made it clear that I‚Äôd charge her less because she‚Äôs family. However, when the business launched and it came time to bill her‚Äîaround $1,000‚Äîshe got offended. Instead of paying me, she accused me of only caring about money.

Things escalated quickly: she yelled at me, insulted me, and has ignored me ever since. To make matters worse, her actions damaged my professional reputation. Friends of hers, with whom I had pending projects, decided to stop working with me after hearing her side of the story.

What hurt the most was that, during the business‚Äôs grand opening, she publicly thanked me in her speech for the branding and said she hoped it would be the first of many successful projects for me. But in the end, this entire ordeal left me in debt.

The money I expected to earn from her project was used to finance the publication of my book‚Äîa dream I‚Äôve had for years. On top of that, I landed a great job in another city, but because of the financial strain, I had to borrow money to move into a small room behind someone‚Äôs house.

Now, with Christmas approaching, I‚Äôve decided not to get her a gift. In fact, I didn‚Äôt even text her anything beyond a cold ‚ÄúHB‚Äù (happy birthday) on her birthday, and only because my mom asked me to. While I feel like my decision might ruin Christmas, I don‚Äôt see the point in continuing to make an effort when it feels like a one-way street.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for deciding not to buy her a gift this year?",2,1734471109.0,amiwrong,2,0.75,False

My partner and I previously lived in SF and moved down to Southern CA while I did my graduate training. We are now hoping to move back to the Bay Area and are interested in the South Bay since we're a bit older and live a calmer life than we did in our early 20s, but we're not very familiar with the South Bay. His new job is in Sunnyvale and I'm going to be working in San Francisco or Palo Alto. We're looking for a safe area where we can walk to coffee shops, restaurants, farmer's market-type events, etc., and would love to be near nature or a park. Would love to be able to find a decent 2 bed for $3,600-$3,800 or under.

What areas would ya'll recommend? Additionally, do you have specific neighborhood recommendations or areas within South Bay cities? Any direction at all is very helpful! 

Also, in the South Bay, do people primarily find apartments via Zillow, Trulia, etc.? Or, is the best way to find apartments via word of mouth or searching for ""For Rent"" signs? That's how it is in some southern CA areas, so just curious how it looks in the South Bay. Thank you!!",0,1734471097.0,bayarea,4,0.5,False

I worked up the courage to engage eye contact with her recently and smile, and great, she smiled back!

I‚Äôve done this with her most mornings when we see eachother and there is some genuine attraction there between us both, but we‚Äôre both walking in opposite directions and have our headphones in so I‚Äôve felt like I don‚Äôt want to stop her to talk to her you know? I respect her space.

Anyway today I was at work and I thought, fuck it. 

I wrote on a sticky note. 

Coffee?
Lunch?
Nah, find a different route to work.

Then I put my number n name at the bottom.

I saw her walking home and she smiled and I held out my hand walking past and she took it, i smiled and gave a casual wink and walked on.

I felt great for doing it. But now reality sinks in I‚Äôm thinking, god is that creepy? I was just trying to put myself out there, out my comfort zone. 

What is there to lose I guess? Just thought as a woman, how would you react? If you saw a guy walking to work everyday you think is alright, that he casually gave you a sticky note and smiled and carried on.

Likely I‚Äôll see her tomorrow morning haha.

1hglcz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marik0Galsun/comments/1hglcz0/mandingo_bingo_a_jessica_swallow_and_tiny_timmy/,Mandingo Bingo - A Jessica Swallow and Tiny Timmy Wong Story,"""Alright, Mark,"" Jessica Swallowed called out, her voice dripping with confidence as she stepped onto the set as she stepped out of makeup. This was not her first black rodeo. ""Where do you want me?

Mark Richter, her husband and the director of **Mandingo Bingo**, looked at her with a mixture of pride and concern. ""On the desk, in front of the bingo caller. You got this Mary.""

Jessica nodded, her lips curling into a smirk as she sauntered over to the desk in bingo hall *Earthquake Productions* had rented from the Volunteer Fire Department. Just a few stage props made it the perfect bingo hall for The Church of Black Cock.

The hall was warmly lit, the only light coming from the soft glow of camera lights positioned strategically around the room. The atmosphere was charged with anticipation, the kind that made her skin tingle and her heart race. She loved this feeling on the set, the rush of sexual energy.

""Alright gentlemen,"" Mark said, his voice steady but filled with excitement. ""You know the drill from rehearsal. Take your positions.""

One by one, the men filed onto their marks, each of them eyeing Jessica with a mix of awe and lust. They were all tall, muscular, dark skinned black men eager for their breakthrough in porn. Ever the astute businessman man, Mark had billed the casting call as a screen test, with head shots and a makeover. For $2000, the men had been through makeup themselves and had head shots taken. Mark himself had run them through the shot plan. Each had been given a Cialis, in case they had any on camera jitters.



A hundred men, one woman, one hundred cream pies. It was a dream come true for many of them. For Jessica, it was just another day at the office. But this was no ordinary office. This was art.

""This is going to be legendary,"" she thought to herself as she sat down on the edge of the bed, her legs spread slightly, inviting them in.

---

The idea had been Mark's from the start. He had always been interested in pushing boundaries, both in their personal life and in his work as a director. When he first proposed the concept of a 100-man cream pie gangbang, Jessica had been intrigued but hesitant. It wasn't just the physical challenge; it was the emotional toll it would take. But Mark had been persuasive, convincing her that this wasn't just pornography‚Äîit was a statement, an art form. And who better to make that statement than his wife?

Over the past few months, they had meticulously planned every detail. From the casting to the logistics, nothing was left to chance. Jessica had undergone rigorous training to prepare her body for the task ahead. Countless hours doing cross fit in the local gym. She had never been more cut, her 30 C tits never more perky. Mark had spent countless hours refining the script, and shot plan, and setting up the perfect shoot location. This wasn't just a film; it was a masterpiece in the making.

Through the magic of film making and editing the shot plan first called for all the men to be called up when they hit bingo. The most monotonous part of the shoot. The men, all naked, stood around the Bingo Hall, drinking coffee and eating donuts, as if at a church event. Then the Bingo Caller, the incomparable Wayne Witold, announced the start of the game, and called the men to their seats. As each man's number was called, he would, as best as his acting skills could muster, excitedly shouted ""**BINGO**"", and make his way to Jessica and stand between her spread legs. One by one the scripted numbers we called, the men took their place, and returned to their seat.

After that, the magic happened. The men were lined up in groups of 25, and the fluffers began their work. Each Fellaxatrix part of *Earthquake Productions'* university outreach program for young women interested in a career in porn, selected from Mark's sorority, Alpha Beta Lamda. Under Mark's close watch, each man was knob gobbled until he was on the edge, and coached to announce when they were ready.

When the talent indicated he was ready he stepped in between Jessica's legs for a front shot to edit into the back shot from the bingo cuts.

As the first man stepped forward, Jessica reached out and pulled him closer, guiding his thick, black cock between her legs. His eyes were wide with excitement, and she could feel his heartbeat quicken as she held his cock in her hand.

""What's your name, baby?"" she purred, her voice low and sultry.

""J-James,"" he stammered, his voice cracking slightly.

Jessica chuckled softly. ""Relax, James. You're not here to impress me. Just let go and enjoy the ride. No need to think about baseball. You can just let got when you want to.""

With that, she leaned in and kissed him deeply, her tongue exploring his mouth as her hands roamed down his muscular back, pulling him closer. James moaned into her mouth, his body trembling with anticipation.

Monitoring the 5 camera shots, Mark watched intently, his fingers hovering over the buttons on the control panel. This was the moment he had been waiting for‚Äîthe moment when his vision came to life. He adjusted the lights slightly, ensuring that every detail was captured perfectly.

""This is going to be incredible,"" he thought, a smile spreading across his face.

Jessica broke the kiss, giving James a playful wink before leaning back on the bingo caller's desk, her legs spread wider now, inviting him in. James hesitated for a moment, his eyes darting to Mark for confirmation.

""Go ahead, James,"" Mark said, his voice calm but firm. ""You're doing great.""

James nodded, positioning himself deeper between Jessica's legs. She reached down and guided him inside her, letting out a soft moan as he entered. James was rough, his thrusts deep and unrelenting, but Jessica took it all in stride, her body moving in sync with his.

""Ahh...that's it, James,"" she whispered, her voice growing sultry as the big black cock fueled her lust. ""Don't hold back.""

James grunted in response, his pace quickening as he lost himself in the moment. Jessica closed her eyes, focusing on the sensations coursing through her body. This was just the beginning, and she knew it was only going to get more intense from here.

Mark watched from behind the cameras, his mind racing with ideas for the next shot. He wanted to capture every angle, every detail, to ensure that this film would be remembered for years to come. As James reached his peak, Jessica tensed, her body arching as she felt him begin to release inside her.

James tensed suddenly. ""I'm cumming. I'm cumming.""

""Ohhh..."" she gasped, her voice filled with ecstasy. ""That's it, baby...fill me up.""

Jessica looked up at him, her eyes filled with satisfaction.

""Well done, James,"" she said, giving him a gentle pat on the shoulder. ""You're officially a porn star now.""

James backed out on wobbly legs, and disappeared out of camera view.

Jessica glanced over at Mark and nodded.

""Ready?"" she asked, her voice filled with anticipation.

Mark smiled, a glint of excitement in his eyes. ""Next up is David. Let's see how he does.""

Jessica nodded, legs dangling off the desk and lifted and spread her legs once again. David stepped forward, his eyes locked on hers as he approached. Unlike James, David was calm and collected, his movements slow and deliberate. Jessica could tell he was experienced, and she couldn't wait to see what he had to offer.

David moved between her legs, his hands gently caressing her thighs as he leaned in to kiss her. His touch was soft, his lips pressing against hers with a tenderness that sent shivers down her spine. Jessica moaned softly, her body responding to his every move.

""Mmm...you're good, David,"" she murmured, her voice thick with desire. ""Real good.""

David grinned, his hand sliding up to cup her breast as he deepened the kiss. Jessica's nipples hardened under his touch, and she arched her back, rising to his touch. He pulled away, his eyes dark with lust as he positioned himself between her legs.

""Ready?"" he asked, his voice low and gravelly.

Jessica nodded, her breath hitching as he entered her cum soaked pussy. David was smooth, his movements calculated and precise. He didn't rush, taking his time to explore every inch of her body. Jessica let out a soft moan, her hands gripping the edge of the desk as she surrendered to the sensation.

""Yes...yes, David,"" she whispered, her words punctuated by sharp intakes of breath. ""Don't stop. Give me your cum.""

David obeyed, his thrusts growing stronger and more confident with each passing second. Jessica felt herself building towards something powerful, something she hadn't experienced with James. This wasn't just sex; it was connection to a thick, black cock.

""Ohhh...David,"" she cried out, her voice breaking as she reached her climax. ""I'm...I'm coming!""

David held her tightly, his own release quickly approaching as he felt her walls tighten around him. With a final thrust, he buried himself deep inside her, his body shuddering as he spilled his seed.

Jessica lay there for a moment, surprised she had cum so quickly, her chest heaving as she tried to catch her breath. David pulled out slowly, giving her a tender kiss on the forehead before stepping back.

Mark's voice cut through the air, snapping Jessica back to reality.

""Great job, David! Alright, everyone, take five. We'll resume in ten minutes.""

Jessica glanced over at Mark, a sly smile playing on her lips.

""Take five?"" she teased. ""Honey, I don't think I have time for breaks. Not with ninety-eight more men waiting.""

Mark laughed, shaking his head in disbelief. ""Ninety-eight? Hah. One thousand,"" he muttered under his breath, but did not want to distract his wife from the task at hand. He couldn‚Äôt believe they were already two down.

Jessica dangled her legs and stretching her arms as she scanned the crowd of men. They were all watching her, some with nervous energy, others with quiet intensity.

Her practiced eye told her that one of the men being fluffed was *very* close. ""Let‚Äôs see how well you fit,"" she thought, her eyes landing on a tall, broad-shouldered man with a beard and chiseled jaw. She crooked her finger at him, beckoning him forward.

‚ÄúYou,‚Äù she said, her voice dripping with command. ‚ÄúCome here.‚Äù

The man stepped forward, his face stoic but his eyes betraying his eagerness. Jessica tilted her head, studying him for a moment before between her legs.

‚ÄúFuck me.‚Äù she ordered, her tone leaving no room for argument.

The man obeyed instantly, guiding his impressive cock into her twice fucked and cummy cunt. Jessica wrapped her legs around him, and ran her hands over his back as she surveyed the rest of the room while he unleashed his load after just a few strokes.

‚ÄúOh, that's it,‚Äù she announced, her voice carrying across the set, ‚Äúso fucking good. Fill me up. Fill me up with that hot cum.‚Äù

Mark nodded in approval, adjusting the fixed cameras to capture facial expressions, quivering muscles, and dripping cum. Jessica leaned back, being sure to spread her legs for another shot of her gaping, dripping cream pie.

‚ÄúNext,‚Äù Mark called out, as another man made his way between his wife's legs, and another took the place in front of his sorority sister fluffer.

Jessica lay back, her body slick with sweat and cum, as the 82nd man stepped forward. Her legs trembled slightly, her thighs sticky with residue from the relentless onslaught of cocks that had been thrust inside her. The weight of the past hours bore down on her, each man leaving his mark, both physically and emotionally. She glanced at Mark, standing off to the side, his director‚Äôs eye never wavering. His intense focus made her chest tighten, a mix of pride and apprehension swirling within her.

‚ÄúMark‚Ä¶‚Äù she whispered, her voice barely audible over the hum of the cameras and the murmur of anticipation in the room. Her breath hitched as she shifted uncomfortably, the ache between her legs growing more pronounced with every movement. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I can‚Ä¶‚Äù

Mark‚Äôs eyes softened for just a moment before he nodded, understanding flickering in his gaze. He stepped closer, his presence commanding yet reassuring. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve come this far, Jessica. You‚Äôre doing something groundbreaking. A plot driven. black cock gang bang. Think about how you‚Äôll feel when it‚Äôs done. When people see what you‚Äôve created. This isn't Annabelle Chong getting fucked by unsightly men and poorly lit, random sex act for piss poor pay. Look at this!‚Äù

Mark's right arm swept over the bingo hall, the other holding the director's megaphone to his mouth. ""You are in the bingo hall of The Church of Black Cock in the Black New World Order. Look at this talent! Tall, muscular black men in their prime. They are handsome. They are hung. They are magnificent.""

""And look at you. THE Jessica Swallows. YOUR pussy is the bingo prize. The tightest, the hottest, the most coveted white pussy in the Black New World Order. Pale white skin in contrast to **ebony Gods**. Naturally platinum hair. The rarest on the entire planet. A sexual athlete with the perfect body, toned to perfection. The perkiest of perfect tits. Areolae rising above them like Olympus above the Serengeti. Nipples that could cut glass like a finely cut diamond mined by these black Gods fucking you. Lips that could suck a diamond from a Tiffany setting. A body made for fucking cock. A pussy that could launch a thousand ships. Your raison d'√™tre is to milk cum from ball sacks. You are the ultimate semen receptacle. Get in the zone. Become the mindless fuck toy you can be!""

Jessica swallowed hard, her mind racing. The thought of finishing, of pushing through the pain and exhaustion, was both terrifying and exhilarating. She wanted to prove herself, not just to the world, but to Mark, to herself. She nodded slowly, determination rekindling in her tired eyes.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù she said, her voice stronger now. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do this.‚Äù

The 82nd man‚Äîa tall, broad-shouldered figure with an air of quiet confidence‚Äîapproached, his cock hard and ready, fluffed to the edge. Jessica reached for him, guiding him into place. He slipped inside her stretched, soaked cunt with ease, his thick length pressing against the swollen walls of her aching pussy. She gasped, the sensation sharp and overwhelming, but she refused to give in to the discomfort as his cock disappeared inside of her, lining up perfectly with her platinum blond landing strip.

Push through, she told herself. Feel it. Embrace it. Service the cock. Be all the slut you can be. Be the fuck toy. Be the fuck toy.

The man began to move, his strokes steady and deliberate. Jessica clung to him, her fingers digging into his shoulders as she matched his rhythm. The cameras whirred around them, capturing every detail‚Äîher flushed cheeks, the glisten of sweat on her skin, the way their muscles clenched as they moved in rhythm to the strokes of cock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it‚Ä¶‚Äù she murmured, her voice breaking slightly. ‚ÄúKeep going. Don‚Äôt stop.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt. His pace quickened, his hips snapping forward with increasing urgency. Jessica closed her eyes, focusing on the sensations flooding her body. Each thrust brought her closer to her limit, but also closer to completion. She could feel the tension building inside her, coiling tighter and tighter until‚Äî

‚ÄúFuck!‚Äù she cried out, her body shuddering as she came, her pussy clenching fiercely around his cock. The man kept thrusting, fucking through the waves of pleasure that took hold of her body before finally releasing inside her. Warm cum flooded her depths, spilling out of her to join the puddle of cum in the floor beneath her.

Jessica sighed, her body limp and exhausted, but there was a flicker of satisfaction in her eyes. She had done it again. One more down, seventeen to go.

Mark smiled, his expression calm but intense, speaking again through the director's megaphone. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre incredible,‚Äù he said softly, brushing a strand of hair from her face. ‚ÄúJust a few more. You can do it.‚Äù

She looked up at him, her heart swelling with affection and admiration. ‚ÄúFor you,‚Äù she said simply, ‚ÄúI can do anything.‚Äù

Mark smiled, warmth and love lighting up his features. He blew her a kiss before stepping back, signaling for the next man to step forward. Jessica took a deep breath, steeling herself for what was to come.

The 83rd man was younger, his lean frame trembling with excitement. His washboard stomach rippling. His cock enormous. He moved between her legs, his cock twitching as he positioned himself. Jessica watched him carefully, sensing his nerves despite his eagerness.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù she said gently, reaching for his hand. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. Fuck me. Take your pleasure and give me your nut.‚Äù

He nodded gratefully, his cheeks flushing as he pushed into her. Jessica bit her lip, the sensation intense but manageable. She kept her eyes on him, her touch soothing as he found his rhythm.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good,‚Äù she encouraged, her voice soft but firm. ‚ÄúYou feel good.‚Äù

Encouraged by her words, he quickened his pace, his movements becoming more confident. Jessica focused on the connection, drawing strength from the shared experience. She could feel his excitement building, well fluffed, the tension in his body growing palpable.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna‚Ä¶‚Äù he started, his voice cracking.

‚ÄúYes! Yes!‚Äù she said, nodding. ‚ÄúCum for me. Fill me up.‚Äù

With a loud groan, he did just that, filling her with his hot seed. Jessica wrapped her arms around him, holding him close as he collapsed against her. For a brief moment, they were just two people sharing an intimate, albeit unconventional, bond.

As he pulled away, Jessica caught Mark‚Äôs eye. He gave her a small, approving nod before calling out for the next participant. And so it continued, one after another, each encounter unique in its own way. Some men were nervous, others confident; some gentle, others rough even knowing Jessica was sore. Through it all, Jessica remained determined, professional, her resilience shining through even as her body grew increasingly sore.

By the time the 95th man finished inside her, Jessica felt like she was hanging on by a thread. Her legs shook uncontrollably, her breath coming in short, shallow gasps. Between cocks she would look up, staring up at the ceiling, trying to gather the strength to keep going.

Mark coached her through the director's megaphone, his voice low and steady. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre almost there, Jess. Just a few more.‚Äù

She blinked slowly, her vision blurring as she turned to look at him. ‚ÄúPromise me something,‚Äù she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

‚ÄúAnything,‚Äù he replied without hesitation.

‚ÄúWhen this is over‚Ä¶‚Äù she trailed off, her eyelids drooping. ‚ÄúFuck me.‚Äù

Mark‚Äôs heart ached at her vulnerability, but he forced himself to remain composed. ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù he said with smile. ‚ÄúThere is nothing I want more.‚Äù

With renewed determination, Jessica pushed herself up, propping herself on shaky elbows. ‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù she said, her voice steadier than she felt. ‚ÄúI need another cock.‚Äù

Mark adjusted the camera, his fingers deftly navigating the controls as he cycled through the various angles. His eyes remained fixated on the monitor, a faint smile tugging at the corners of his lips as he found the perfect shot. ‚ÄúAlright, Jess,‚Äù he said, his voice calm but laced with excitement. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got something special for you.‚Äù

Jessica, propped up against a stack of pillows to rest to rest on the bingo caller's desk, her body glistening with sweat and traces of cum, turned her head to look at him. Her piercing blue eyes locked onto his, and she gave him a tired but appreciative smile. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù she asked, her voice soft but steady.

‚ÄúLook up,‚Äù Mark replied, his tone almost reverent. ‚ÄúAn overhead shot. Something no one has ever seen before. Something that will capture every inch of you‚Äîyour strength, your beauty, your endurance.‚Äù

Jessica let out a small laugh, the sound tinged with exhaustion but brimming with pride. ‚ÄúYou never mentioned a six camera set up.‚Äù

Mark nodded, ""I wanted it to be a surprise for this series"".

The lens was angled perfectly to capture Jessica from above, offering a view that highlighted the way her body stretched and trembled with each thrust. It was intimate, raw, and utterly captivating. ‚ÄúYou are going to love it.‚Äù he told her, stepping forward to let her see the footage on a mini screen while she rested and hydrated.

Jessica watched the playback, her breath catching as she saw herself in a way she never had before. The angle made her feel exposed, yes, but also powerful. ‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù she whispered, her voice thick with emotion. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ incredible.‚Äù

Mark grinned, clearly pleased with her reaction. ‚ÄúI have already planned duplicating cuts and split screens, alternating between this angle and the others. It‚Äôll make the final cut even more groundbreaking and add length to the Lustomentory.‚Äù

Jessica shuddered at the thought, her body still recovering from the onslaught of men who had already taken her, and the countless orgasms that had ravaged her body. She felt like she was being molded into something larger than life, something iconic. ‚ÄúGet me another one,‚Äù she said, her voice firm despite the fatigue weighing heavily on her limbs.

With that, Mark signaled for the next man to step forward. The 95th man, a tall figure with broad shoulders and an air of quiet confidence, approached the bed. His piercing eyes locked onto Jessica‚Äôs, and she could feel the intensity emanating from him. ‚ÄúReady?‚Äù he asked, his voice low and steady.

Jessica nodded, forcing herself to meet his gaze. ‚ÄúDo your worst. Really. Fuck me hard. Don't hold back. Fuck me with that big cock.‚Äù

The man smirked, his expression darkening slightly as he positioned himself between her legs. Without preamble, he pushed inside her, his movements swift and purposeful. Jessica gasped, the sensation hitting her like a bolt of lightning. He didn‚Äôt tease, didn‚Äôt linger‚Äîhe simply took what he wanted, his rhythm unyielding.

Jessica‚Äôs nails dug into the man's back, bleeding him with scratches as he took her, with her breaths coming in short, shallow gasps from each deep thrust. She could feel her body straining, her muscles tightening around him as he pounded into her. And then, just as suddenly as it began, it was over. With one final thrust, he came inside her, his release flooding her in a warm, wet rush.

As he pulled out, Jessica let out a shaky breath, her body trembling with the aftermath. Mark was there in an instant, his hands gentle as he helped her settle back against the pillows. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing amazing,‚Äù he murmured, brushing a stray strand of hair from her face.

Jessica managed a weak smile, her eyes flickering shut for a moment before snapping open again. ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Mark nodded, his expression filled with pride. ‚ÄúJust a few more,‚Äù he said, his tone encouraging. ‚ÄúYou can do this.‚Äù

Jessica swallowed hard, her resolve hardening as she prepared for the next man. The 96th man, a younger guy with a lean frame and wide, eager eyes, stepped forward. He looked nervous, almost starstruck, and Jessica couldn‚Äôt help but chuckle softly. ‚ÄúRelax,‚Äù she said, her voice soothing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just us. Just your cock and my pussy. Nothing else matters.‚Äù

The man visibly relaxed, a shy smile breaking across his face. ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù he muttered, his cheeks reddening slightly.

Jessica reached out, cupping his cheek in her hand. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt thank me yet,‚Äù she said, her tone playful. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see if you can keep up.‚Äù

With that, she leaned in, pressing her lips to his in a passionate kiss. His eyes widened in surprise, but he quickly melted into the embrace, his hands finding their way to her hips. Jessica groaned into the kiss, her body responding to his touch even as her mind screamed at her to slow down. But she couldn‚Äôt. She wouldn‚Äôt. This was who she was, what she did. And she wasn‚Äôt about to stop now.

When they finally broke apart, the man was breathless, his chest heaving as he stared down at her. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre incredible,‚Äù he whispered, his voice filled with awe.

Jessica smirked, her confidence returning in full force. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hope you can say the same after you have had me,‚Äù she teased, her voice dripping with seduction.

Without waiting for a response, she guided him inside her, her body welcoming him with a warmth that left him speechless. As he began to move, Jessica closed her eyes, letting the sensations wash over her. Each thrust brought her closer to the edge, her body humming with both pleasure and exhaustion.

But she didn‚Äôt falter. She wouldn‚Äôt falter. Not now, not when she was so close to the finish line.

Mark watched from behind the camera, his heart pounding in his chest as he captured every moment. This was art, pure and raw, and he was determined to immortalize it for the world to see.

Jessica leaned back, her breath catching as the 96th man finished inside her. She felt the familiar warmth pooling deep within as her pussy clenched involuntarily, milking him of his seed. Her body was slick with sweat, her skin glowing from exertion. She looked over at Mark, who stood behind the camera, his eyes intense as he captured every detail.

‚ÄúNext,‚Äù she called out, her voice steady despite the fatigue that threatened to overwhelm her.

Mark nodded, signaling to the crew. The 97th man stepped forward, his presence commanding yet somehow nervous. He was tall, with broad shoulders and a chiseled jaw, his eyes dark and probing. He seemed both excited and unsure, a mix of emotions that Jessica found intriguing.

‚ÄúHi,‚Äù he said, his voice low and slightly trembling.

Jessica smiled, a slow, seductive curve that didn‚Äôt quite reach her tired eyes. ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù she replied, her tone light but laced with challenge. ‚ÄúI hear you‚Äôre up next.‚Äù

The man swallowed hard, his Adam‚Äôs apple bobbing visibly. ‚ÄúYeah. I mean, yes. I am.‚Äù

Jessica tilted her head, studying him. ‚ÄúYou seem... nervous.‚Äù

He ran a hand through his hair, trying to compose himself. ‚ÄúI just want to make sure I do this right. It‚Äôs not every day you get to be part of something like this.‚Äù

She chuckled softly, the sound almost musical despite her exhaustion. ‚ÄúRelax,‚Äù she said, stepping closer. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have fun. But first, let‚Äôs play a little game.‚Äù

His eyebrows shot up, curiosity and apprehension mingling in his expression. ‚ÄúA game?‚Äù

Jessica nodded, her lips curving into a mischievous smile. ‚ÄúYes. A game of endurance. I want you to last as long as you can. No rushing, no premature finishes. Can you do that?‚Äù

He hesitated for a moment, then straightened his posture, determination flickering in his eyes. ‚ÄúI don't know. She...that girl....I mean, she was sucking me really good.‚Äù

He gestured to Sarah, a pretty, curvy redhead no longer showing signs of her Abrahamic nose.

Jessica reached out, her fingers brushing lightly against his chest. ‚ÄúYeah, Mark speaks highly of her skills,‚Äù she purred. ‚ÄúBut if you can last, I might just reward you.‚Äù

His breath hitched at her touch, his heart rate quickening. ‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs the reward?‚Äù

Jessica leaned in closer, her mouth inches from his ear. ‚ÄúThat depends on how much you can take,‚Äù she whispered, her voice dripping with seduction.

Before he could respond, she pulled away, turning to face the camera. ‚ÄúMark, are we ready?‚Äù

Mark adjusted the overhead camera, zooming in to capture every intimate detail. ‚ÄúReady when you are.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck me,‚Äù she commanded, her eyes locking onto his. ""Fuck me with your big, black cock.""

He obeyed, stepping forward as she reached for him, guiding his cock inside of her.

He took hold of her exhausted legs, lifting them as his fingers trembled and his biceps bulged. She watched him closely, noting the way his breathing deepened, the way his muscles tensed from the pleasure of her pussy.

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù she murmured, encouraging him. ‚ÄúNow, kiss me.‚Äù

He hesitated for a split second, then complied, pressing his lips to hers. The kiss was tentative at first, but quickly deepened as Jessica took control, her tongue exploring his mouth with languid strokes.

She moaned softly, her body responding instinctively to the contact. Despite her exhaustion, there was an undeniable thrill in pushing her limits, in seeing how far she could go.

When they finally broke apart, she opened her eyes, meeting his gaze. ‚ÄúNow fuck me. And make it last.‚Äù she told him, her tone teasing.

He swallowed hard, his cheeks flushing. ‚ÄúYeah. Yeah.‚Äù

With deep breaths, he filled her with his length, moving slowly at first. Jessica bit her lip, suppressing a moan as the fullness enveloped her. She arched her back, welcoming him deeper.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it,‚Äù she encouraged, her voice husky. ‚ÄúTake me. Feel every inch of me. Use every inch of me.‚Äù

He nodded, his movements growing more confident as he found his rhythm. Jessica wrapped her legs around his waist, urging him on. She closed her eyes, losing herself in the sensations, the heat, the pressure building within her.

Mark watched from behind the camera, his heart pounding in his chest. This was it, the climax of their masterpiece. He zoomed in, capturing every detail‚ÄîJessica‚Äôs flushed cheeks, the intensity in the man‚Äôs eyes, the way their bodies merged seamlessly.

Time seemed to stretch, each moment drawn out and amplified. Jessica‚Äôs breaths grew shallow, her moans increasing in volume as the tension within her coiled tighter and tighter.

Finally, unable to hold back any longer, she cried out, her orgasm crashing over her like a tidal wave. She clung to the man, her nails digging into his back as she rode out the waves of pleasure.

For a moment, everything else faded away, leaving only the two of them, locked in a passionate embrace as the man spilled his cum inside of her.

""Was that enough?"" He asked.

""That was perfect,"" she told him as he pulled out, and his seed joined the puddle on the floor.",1,1734471015.0,Marik0Galsun,0,1.0,False

If you get banned on one, you're banned on all of them‚Äî**Tinder, Hinge, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish**, you name it. It‚Äôs a monopoly, and it‚Äôs honestly ridiculous.

I recently got banned on **Tinder** for something I didn‚Äôt even do. I tried to appeal the ban through every possible channel‚Äîeven the **Better Business Bureau (BBB)**‚Äîand they flat-out told me **under no circumstances** would they lift the ban. I don‚Äôt understand! I‚Äôve never engaged in any weird or inappropriate behavior, and I certainly don‚Äôt send creepy messages or anything like that. If anything, the only thing I can think of is that I made a couple of references to **Trailer Park Boys** in my profile... but seriously, who gets banned for that?

What blows my mind is that **Match Group** has the power to control all of these platforms and effectively shut down your ability to meet people. Dating apps are how most people meet now‚Äî**no one** meets in person anymore! You can‚Äôt just walk up to someone in a bar or coffee shop and start talking to them. People would think you‚Äôre weird and creepy, myself included (as a female, this is especially true).

It just feels wrong that a company like Match Group can have such a monopoly and ban people for **no reason at all**. It‚Äôs like they control your entire ability to even have a chance at dating. I get that there need to be rules and regulations, but banning someone with no explanation is just beyond frustrating. It feels like they have too much power to dictate what we do on the internet.

1hglahy,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hglahy/hr_unfiltered_pt_1/,[HR] Unfiltered pt. 1,"\- ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always believed that the human brain is the most complicated map in existence. Every thought, every emotion, everything is woven in such an intricate, delicate way. And yet, it‚Äôs all controlled by something that, for some reason, we think we understand, but we don‚Äôt. What happens when the brain starts to fail? Or worse, what happens when someone, of their own free will, starts to ignore the signals? The red lights that the brain should turn on, but never does. Those are the minds that interest me. And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here. Because what I discovered, what I‚Äôm about to reveal, will change everything we know about human behavior.‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúAt first, I thought there was a simple explanation for what I was looking for. A few miswired neurons, a bit of faulty genetics‚Ä¶ But the truth is much darker than that. When the mind cracks, when psychopathy and crime emerge from the shadows, the answers are more complicated than one might imagine. But still, I can‚Äôt stop looking. Because when it comes to the human mind, there‚Äôs something very seductive about unraveling what‚Äôs beyond the visible.‚Äù

Martina‚Äôs voice is clear, but there‚Äôs something in her tone that can‚Äôt be easily identified. A subtle shudder in her words, as if she were talking about something that has her trapped, even though she can‚Äôt help it. There‚Äôs an obsession, not just scientific, but personal.

\- ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself. My name is Martina. I‚Äôm a neuroscientist, although I don‚Äôt usually call myself that too much. My coworkers call me ‚Äòthe weird one‚Äô because of my approach. Nobody understands why, sometimes, I spend entire days researching human behavior and its darkest disorders. I‚Äôm the one who always looks for patterns in broken minds, those that fall between the margins of normality. People sometimes look at me as if I‚Äôm dangerous. And no, I‚Äôm not talking about those crazy people in horror movies. I'm talking about those cases that psychiatrists dismiss as 'anomalies', as 'complex minds'. These are the people who really intrigue me. Those, the ones who never fit in, the ones everyone avoids. The ones who, in the end, make the difference.‚Äù

Martina reflects in silence while the soft sound of a coffee machine in the background resonates in the room. The noises are constant, but the feeling that the scene generates is one of isolation. Martina is alone in her thoughts, immersed in something much bigger than herself. This is where her story begins.

\- ‚ÄúOver the years, I have worked with many experts, but I can't say that they have all understood the 'why' of this research. Although, of course, I don't care too much what they think. Dr. Avery, for example... I would never understand him. He's a brilliant guy, sure, but sometimes his methods... his ways so... cold... almost calculating, make my hair stand on end. He's British, which probably explains his distance. She always has a distant look, as if she were looking at something through a fog that no one else can see. But what bothers me is her silence.‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúThen there is Sofia. She is completely different, her mindset... she is more open, warmer. She will never admit it, but she has become fond of the team, of the people. Even though she feels like a fish out of water, she always has something to say, something to add to the analysis, something to question what we think we know about human beings and their relationships with nature. People like Sofia, who observe ecosystems, the connections between animals and human behavior, are disconcerting to me. But not in a bad way. It gives me hope in a way. Even though she never tells me, I know that she is as caught up in this mystery as I am. She, like me, is looking for answers.‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúBut, of course, not all the team shares my enthusiasm. Some are only here because they are interested in the money or the prestige that comes with the project.‚Äù

\- ‚ÄúI can't tell you everything now. It's not the time. But when this investigation comes to an end, when everything falls apart... you will understand what we discovered. And what we did, what I did to stop him.‚Äù",1,1734470840.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Grand Central Terminal is a testament to the opulence of a gilded era.¬† It remains in a golden state.¬† The beautiful ceiling and marble speak to a different time, however the odor and pedestrians tell a different story.¬† Perhaps a more truthful story of New York.¬† The dread though does not originate in these bitter thoughts of New York, but rather bitter thoughts of my job.¬† It is an accounting job in the financial district of New York.¬† The southern point of the greatest city in the world is my hell, or maybe even worse.¬† Sometimes I would prefer to be placed in the frozen lake with the betrayers to the boring number crunching that I am tasked with.

Many thoughts invade my mind, doubts of my sympathetic nervous system‚Äôs flight response and thoughts of what this could mean for my future employment.¬† Fears creep in, but are swiftly shut out by something speaking much louder.¬† Maybe self-preservation; maybe a higher power.¬† Before I know it I am on the 1 train heading for Port Authority.¬†¬†

My gaze falls upon a wanderer, a transient, a vagrant as I exit the 1 train stop at Port Authority.¬† The smell of urine radiates from him, and his dirty visage is proof enough of this.¬† He murmurs to himself, his breath becoming visible in the cold December air; his cracked lips separate and he speaks, yet nothing he says is discernible.¬† Pity consumes me for a moment before my gaze falls upon his hand.

Within his grasp is a white and blue coffee cup.¬† Columns decorate the exterior of the cup.¬† He shakes the cup at tourists who just recently got off of their buses at Port Authority or trains at Penn Station.¬† They walk north-bound, maybe to Macy‚Äôs or Time Square.¬† They carry bags that are worth more than what this man could dream of possessing.¬† The sound of the change clattering together pulls me away from these thoughts and brings my attention back to him.

I feel within my pocket for something to give him, any spare change.¬† Within my pocket I find a quarter and then the quarter finds his cup.¬† I continue on towards the bus and ponder if it is even my place to feel pity.¬† Is this man really that different from myself?¬† Are the words he utters to himself any different than the thoughts I utter to myself.¬† Is his dirt covered skin that different from the impurity that we all carry with ourselves?¬† The odor of urine reminds me of the odorous nature of putrid greed.

As I board my bus these thoughts do not leave me.¬† I must question if that man was a victim of circumstance, and what truly separates me from him.¬† My father used to tell me when I was young that most are only one tragedy away from being displaced from their homes.¬† These thoughts go unresolved as sleep claims me and my thoughts slip from my grasp and one prevails.¬† I am now a wanderer, transient, vagrant.¬†¬†¬†¬†

*keep in mind that English isn‚Äôt my native language 
*this happened in my teen years (therefore everything is more dramatic that it should be, but oh well)

So when I was maybe 15 years old, I magically woke up looking more like a girl than like a child and so my love journey began. 

In the summer I started hanging out with a big group of boys and girls (we were literally 20-30 people when we were going out, it was ridiculous). There was always someone new to the group, someone dating and braking up every day and it was crazy dynamic. I was ‚Äúdating‚Äù one of the guys (meaning we kissed a couple of times and broke up after a week) and after that I decided that the drama is too much for me to handle üòÅ
That was until I went to a birthday party where I met (we‚Äôll call him) Jeremy. Jeremy and I had an immediate attraction, we were making out the whole night and I was already head over heels for him. He then told me that he‚Äôs going out of the country for 2 weeks but can‚Äôt wait to meet me after. We agreed that we‚Äôre going to wait for each other like it was some sort of going to war situation üòÅ. That was the time before the social media and that fact that he was out of the country ment we weren‚Äôt able to text or talk to each other during that time. He was supposed to be back on the day of a big concert everyone was waiting through the whole summer.
So two miserable week passed by and during the time my guy friends were telling me what a player he is and that I‚Äôm probably not going to hear from him again. The whole gang went to the concert and in the middle of it (when I almost lost hope) Jeremy showed up with a gift from his trip for me. We kissed and so our romance began. 
We were happily dating for probably a month (the equivalent of a year in teen yearsüòÅ). We were often going out alone then joining the big crew after or vice-versa. Everything was perfect, until‚Ä¶
So there was this girl (we‚Äôll call Hanna). She didn‚Äôt hang up with us often at all, I probably only met her twice and she was giving me bad vibes. Once me and Jeremy went out with the group and she was there. As the experienced woman I was üôÑ I noticed that he found her attractive and so does she, but I tried not dwell on it. Since then she was going out with us every time. Worst part was most of the group were living in the same neighbourhood (including Jeremy and Hanna) while I was living in the city centre. So when we were going home, everyone was dropping me off and then went their way. I felt jealous but didn‚Äôt say a thing since I didn‚Äôt want to act insecure. 
A few weeks later I got sick. Like sick-sick, I couldn‚Äôt lift my head of the bed for a couple of days  kind of sick and the loving boyfriend I had was nowhere to be seen. He only asked me how I am a couple of times and I was furious. After a couple of days when I felt better so told he‚Äôll come to see me. I met him In front of my building still looking and feeling like shrimp ü¶ê when he told me he wants to brake up because the love isn‚Äôt there anymore. Remember this is teen drama so our feelings are completely valid in our heads. For every other human being with more than one brain cell except me , that was a huge surprise! I was shocked and heartbroken that he left me at my lowest and wasn‚Äôt there for me in sickness and healthüòÅ. 
After a week I got the shocking news that Jeremy and Hanna are dating. This day Petty Peterson was born, but I didn‚Äôt know how to get my revenge. The opportunity came only a week later when Jeremy texted me how sorry he is, how he missed me and that he thought he likes Hanna but she simply isn‚Äôt me. I may be only 15 but I knew I had to move in the shadows. I never answered his daily calls but I documented every conversation about how much he loves me, how boring Hanna is, how he‚Äôll dump her etc.  After a couple of weeks I messaged Hanna, I send her everything and we exchanged numbers. We talked all night. I didn‚Äôt appreciate the way the started their relationship (they were seeing each other behind my back) but as we exchanged information we were able to confirm what a tool he really is. She felt very betrayed mostly because she already slept with him, while I was never. So we came with the plan. The next day, I ignored Jeremy‚Äô call again and when he messaged me with the daily - ‚ÄúI love you, I want us to meet, please forgive me‚Äù. I finally said ‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs meet and I‚Äôll hear you out‚Äù. We scheduled a meeting in the coffee shop we and our friends were always hanging out. He came only to find out me and Hanna sitting next to each. His face was priceless. I asked him why he wanted to meet and after a couple of seconds of pure shock, he confessed that he loves me and wants to be with me and not with Hanna. I could tell she was really hurt but honestly wasn‚Äôt my problem at all. I told him I would never in a million years waste my time with a person like him and how he doesn‚Äôt deserve us both. After I nice ‚Äúfudge you‚Äù , I took Hanna‚Äôa hand and we left. I couldn‚Äôt erase my smirk but Hanna was almost crying. She said she wanted to be alone and went home. I was happy and satisfied with my self. I got my petty revenge. 

‚Ä¶ or so I thought. Only few weeks later I found out Hanna and Jeremy were back together. And surprise- surprise- he was texting me again, telling me how he‚Äôs with her only because I did him dirty ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. This time I just ignored. I did my part. I didn‚Äôt care anymore.

il note that weight loss is not my primary motivation for this role. My father has end stage CKD and I failed the donor test due to high levels of creatinine and sodium in my diet.

I have been chatting to a guy (33M, ENTJ) for two months.. but things tanked a few weeks ago and I don't know where we stand now. Can someone help me translate this? I can't tell if I'm the problem 

We live in different cities but met through bumble during one of his work trips. We met the next day after matching and had a good breakfast date together. He seemed really excited to be with me, looked me up and down a lot (in a good way) and had really good chemistry and conversation flow. We chatted for a few weeks until he was back in my city, meeting up for dinner and holding hands across the table. We even had a conversation over ice cream, discussing kinks and similar things. 
I feel very inspired by his work ethic and demeanor, as I am a hard worker myself. And really attracted to the person he is, and his looks as well despite him not being conventionally attractive. We have talked a lot about how we are very different, in career and background but would be a really good match. 

While chatting before our second date, he messages maybe twice a day since he's super busy.. sends lots of pictures so I feel part of his day. He made a few comments here and there that he ""appreciates that i am on the other side of his phone"" and that I must not expect him to be a good texter, even if he had time he isn't sure he wants that. I had never pressured him to reply quickly, he did mention this was an issue in his previous relationship. He is a director of an international company so I understand that he is busy. However, I am also a director of a smaller company and feel there's always time in a day to connect. 

Our texts that follow are not lovey dovey but have flirting and compliments here and there.. including saying we would look good together. 

Fast forward... he is back in my city for a 3rd time for a full week. Since I feel excited to see him, I ask once or twice if he's free for coffee or something in one of the evenings. He is busy with client dinners and seeing his brother most nights so we decide to keep Sunday open to see one another and when the day rolls around, he does not follow up on plans. I felt less inclined to follow up since I had already asked a few times through the week. Long story short, he intentionally does not make plans, does not tell me he is busy doing something else and only responds the next day saying he's sorry if I'm angry that he kinda ghosted me but he wanted to spend time with his brother before his birthday week. 

Of course I understand if plans change, and wasn't angry about him disappearing that day. I just felt like my time wasn't respected and wondered if he does want to see me in the first place. I replied saying it's ok, I just wish he respected my time more. He then didn't reply for two weeks and now sends me an apology saying he's been really busy and went into autopilot. He says an apology is the least I deserve and he hopes I'm ok, and Have a good festive season. 

*Thanks for reading this far ... 

IN SUMMARY 
I feel as though him not replying was the most convenient way of him ending things with me. While I appreciate his apology, it seems like he closes the book by saying have a good holiday season, instead of ""let's see each other again"". 

I wonder if I was too available by replying to his texts every day. As a high power (high ego) guy, maybe he wants to chase me more. He was really into me with lovey texts until he kinda ghosted me that Sunday

To me.. he seems emotionally avoidant and kinda wants to reject me before I reject him. I genuinely like him, and am still curious to keep things going. He is on my Mind so much and I want to not seem like I'm chasing 

What should I do next? Not reply until he texts me again? If he ever does? 
Am I not respecting my self worth? ",1,1734469455.0,dating_advice,10,1.0,False

1hgkr6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/RiseHealingCenter/comments/1hgkr6r/how_to_recover_from_burnout_as_a_parent/,"How to Recover from Burnout as a Parent
","https://preview.redd.it/iwzdvgf24h7e1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8f3ffb1aa910c7af60daee75427e92daee66822

Parenting‚Äîa journey of love, chaos, and unrelenting effort‚Äîoften stretches us to our limits. The unending loop of sleepless nights, ever-growing to-do lists, and the emotional toll of caregiving can leave even the strongest parent feeling drained. If you‚Äôre weary, irritable, or detached, remember this: you‚Äôre not alone, and there‚Äôs a way back to balance.

**1. Recognize the Signs of Burnout**

Burnout sneaks up on you, quietly weaving itself into your days. Do these resonate?

* **Exhaustion that no amount of sleep seems to fix:** This isn‚Äôt your run-of-the-mill tiredness. It‚Äôs the kind of fatigue that settles deep in your bones and makes even the idea of getting out of bed feel insurmountable.
* **Emotional flatness or feeling disconnected from your children:** You may feel as though you‚Äôre going through the motions without truly engaging, like watching your life unfold from behind a foggy glass.
* **Increased irritability or snapping at the smallest provocations:** The tiniest mishap‚Äîspilled milk, a misplaced toy‚Äîsends your temper flaring beyond what feels reasonable.
* **Simple tasks that feel overwhelming:** Folding laundry, making a grocery list, or packing lunches‚Äîthings you once handled with ease‚Äîmay now feel like climbing a mountain.
* **A fading sense of joy in activities you once loved:** Hobbies, outings, or even time with loved ones might no longer bring the spark they used to.

Recognizing these signs is the first step toward reclaiming your energy.

**2. Prioritize Self-Care**

It‚Äôs a simple truth: you can‚Äôt pour from an empty cup. Yet parents often overlook their own needs. Change that narrative:

* **Carve out quiet moments:** Even ten minutes to breathe, meditate, or sit in silence can act as a reset button for your day. Close your eyes, listen to your breathing, and let your mind settle.
* **Focus on nourishing yourself:** Don‚Äôt just scrape leftovers of dino nuggets and fries from your child's plate; prepare something that sustains and nourishes you. A colorful plate of fruits, vegetables, and protein can revive your energy and mind.
* **Rediscover small joys:** Dust off that old book you loved, take a brisk walk in your neighborhood, or revisit a playlist that always lifts your mood. These tiny pockets of happiness can have a ripple effect on your day.

**3. Ask for Help**

The idea of the ‚Äúsuperparent‚Äù is a myth. Lean on others:

* **Share with your partner:** Divide tasks, communicate openly about your struggles, and create a shared game plan for handling stressful moments.
* **Accept help from friends and family:** Whether it‚Äôs asking someone to babysit for an hour or having a friend listen as you vent, reaching out can provide relief.
* **Seek professional support:** [**Therapists**](https://risehealingcenter.com/emdrconsultation) and counselors can provide tools to address stress, help you reframe your mindset, and offer perspective on managing burnout.

**4. Set Realistic Expectations**

Perfection is a trap. Free yourself:

* **Forget the picture-perfect ideals:** No one‚Äôs home is always spotless, and no child is always perfectly behaved. Focus on what truly matters to you and your family.
* **Acknowledge and celebrate small wins:** Got your child to school on time? That‚Äôs a victory. Managed to get them to eat a vegetable? Another win. Celebrate the little things.
* **Be kind to yourself:** Even on your hardest days, remind yourself that parenting is a marathon, not a sprint, and it‚Äôs okay to stumble along the way.

**5. Build a Support Network**

Parenting isn‚Äôt meant to be done alone. Connect with others:

* **Join local or online groups:** Find communities where you can share experiences, tips, and support. Knowing others share your struggles can be deeply comforting.
* **Strengthen friendships:** Reach out to old friends or make new ones who understand the challenges of parenting. A simple coffee chat can do wonders.
* **Let loved ones step in:** Whether it‚Äôs a grandparent offering to babysit or a neighbor helping with carpooling, let others be part of your support system.

**6. Practice** [**Mindfulness**](https://risehealingcenter.com/mindfulnesstherapyonline) **and Stress-Reduction Techniques**

The relentless pace of parenting can feel suffocating. Ground yourself:

* **Deep breathing:** Take slow, deliberate breaths. Inhale for a count of four, hold for four, and exhale for six. This simple exercise can help you reset in moments of high [**stress**](https://risehealingcenter.com/blog/harness-the-power-of-the-4-7-8-breathing-technique-to-ease-anxiety-and-stress)**.**
* **Notice the present:** Focus on the little things‚Äîthe warmth of a mug in your hands, the sound of birds outside, or the texture of your favorite sweater. These details can anchor you in the moment.
* **Journal your thoughts:** Write down your worries, achievements, or anything weighing on your mind. The act of putting pen to paper can be incredibly cathartic.

**7. Reevaluate Your Priorities**

Burnout often signals it‚Äôs time for change. Ask yourself:

* **What‚Äôs most important?** Focus your energy on what truly matters to you and your family, whether it‚Äôs spending more time together or simplifying your routines.
* **What can you let go of?** Say ‚Äúno‚Äù to commitments that drain your energy without adding value to your life. It‚Äôs okay to prioritize your well-being.
* **Who can help lighten the load?** Delegate tasks, whether it‚Äôs your partner taking on more chores or hiring help when possible.

**8. Invest in Quality Time**

Connection is the heart of parenting. Relish the small, meaningful moment:

* **Play a silly game:** Whether it‚Äôs hide-and-seek or a board game, let laughter dissolve stress and create happy memories.
* **Share a meal together:** Turn off the devices, set the table, and savor the moment‚Äîeven if dinner is something simple like sandwiches.
* **End the day with a story or quiet time:** Create bedtime rituals that foster connection, whether it‚Äôs reading a book, sharing highlights of the day, or just sitting together in silence.

**9. Be Patient with Yourself**

Recovery takes time. Celebrate small steps:

* **A day that feels less overwhelming:** Notice when you feel even slightly lighter, and acknowledge the progress you‚Äôre making.
* **A task accomplished with ease:** Whether it‚Äôs folding laundry or making dinner, recognize the wins‚Äîbig and small.
* **A moment of genuine joy or calm:** Hold onto these moments and let them remind you of what‚Äôs possible.

**10. Seek Professional Guidance if Needed**

Sometimes burnout digs deep. If it feels insurmountable, [**reach out**](https://risehealingcenter.com/contact). Therapy can provide the tools and space to heal and rebuild.

Parenting challenges you, but it also reveals your resilience. Embrace your imperfections, treasure the triumphs, and remember: prioritizing yourself is an act of love for your family.",1,1734469424.0,RiseHealingCenter,0,1.0,False

I often feel like I agree more with things that are considered for babyboomers. I feel like I'm more conservative, more frugal and make different life choices. Even my humor seems to be more fitting for the older generations. 

Some examples; 

\- I purposely chose a boring job as an accountant to be able to buy a house and afford a comfortable lifestyle. I feel like most people our generation seem to have something against a boring office job where you have to make long hours. Even the concept of working 40 hours a week (a normal workweek where I live) is up for debate here in my country with young people complaining it takes too much out of their free time. Also, as a result of this I own a house and the whole issue of housing being too expensive or out of reach is completely alien to me. 

\- I live in a suburb and I prefer this or a small village over living in the city center. I feel like the majority of people our generation wants to live in the city center and even though I do like to visit the city center I prefer some peace and quiet around the place where I actually live. 

\- I'm a big car enthousiast. Car mobility is really important to me, where the average millenial who lives in the center of a major city seems to be very much against cars, often don't even have a drivers licence. Also the dream of owning a sportscar for the weekend seems to be pretty much death with our generation where this is still something I aspire to. 

\- I don't particularly care about traveling far away. I have made some major trips in the past, but I feel like it's a waste of money and I definitely think the ""enrichment"" you experience is exaggerated. I think at our age it's better not to spend the majority of our savings, or god forbid, take on debt to go backpacking in India. 

\- And speaking about a waste of money; I have seen statistics that the average Millenial has like 500 dollars in their bank account. I hope that amount has risen in recent years, but I am definitely focused on living frugal and saving money. No I don't think your savings on avocado toast or starbucks coffee will be enough to afford a house, but the mentality switch that makes you understand what is wrong with paying 9 dollars for a cup of coffee might actually do the trick. 

Often when I have a discussion with people about the topics mentioned above, I'm met with an ""Ok B."" (this subreddit blocks the word for some reason) whenever I voice my opinion.

I need help choosing an espresso machine that I won't outgrow. I really don't know much about the different manufacturers or models so any advice there would be useful. I will include some more information below:

* I'm located in the US
* I really only drink espresso and americanos, though I occasionally make milk drinks for friends and family so I do want it to be able to steam milk. 
   * I know a lot of high end machines have dual boilers; being able to steam milk and pull shots at the same time is not important for me. 
* I typically make 2-3 shots throughout the day, not really at regular times. 
   * A machine that can heat up quickly is important to me as I don't want to wait 20-30 minutes before making coffee. 
* I don't like the noise of a vibration pump so I am willing to spend more money if I can get a rotary pump machine
* I really like the classic look of E61 style machines and dislike the look of more modern-looking machines
   * Spending this much money I want to like the look in addition to making good coffee :)
* I would like to be able to adjust temperature, pressure, etc. but being able to program complex PID profiles isn't really something I am into. I'm not that fussy about it and I'd like to be able to dial in temp and pressure in a few shots and leave it.
* I have a Niche Zero grinder which I don't intend to replace.

TLDR: Rotary pump, E61 machine, heats up quickly, dual boiler not required

Located in the Los Angeles County of California, Norwalk is a beautiful and well-planned city. Incorporated in the 1900s, the city has a population of around 1 lakh residents and it is one of the fastest-growing cities in California. Norwalk is located just a few miles away from Los Angeles, making it one of California's best suburbs. The city offers the residents all the modern-day amenities and a suburban vibe; they can also explore restaurants, coffee shops, etc. Norwalk is also known for its great agricultural varieties and the city was once famous for being a point for logging, dairying and ranching. However, living in Norwalk also has some disadvantages as there is a strong presence of criminals in and around the area. Residents are a bit conservative and they fear leaving their homes behind due to the presence of criminals. To protect residents and make the environment peaceful, it is important to hire a [**patrol security guard service in Norwalk, California.**](https://apsfirewatchsecurity.com/services/)

It starts sad but that‚Äôs okü•∞

Until recently I fully hated myself. I looked in the mirror and felt sick angry and sad at the same time. I saw myself and my body as separate things. Wishing I could be a woman and resenting myself because I couldn‚Äôt. 

Under 10 Crying wishing I was in a girls body instead and telling myself half of people must also hate their sex because it‚Äôs random. It has to be random for this to make sense‚Ä¶To child me at least.  

From like 13 to 25 I watched this man in the mirror becoming someone everyone else loved. Someone I hated more than anyone could love. 

I learned about trans people when I was 16. Skipping class on a WCC library computer. 

I was fascinated and JEALOUS. 

By then I only knew the bad stories. I was convinced I would lose everything and everyone‚Ä¶ I wished I could be like them but they were more brave than me. They believed in themselves enough to be who they wanted. 

I spent my life trying to be who I‚Äôm supposed to be. Do what I‚Äôm supposed to do. Be ‚Äúgood‚Äù. 

I built a life I never wanted and I broke. I was living ONLY for my family. I love them, and I couldn‚Äôt hurt them like that. Honestly the only thing to kept me alive to that point. 

About 5 years ago I finally moved home and was walking downtown. I saw a trans woman smiling. 

Smiling, laughing, buying food with her friend.   And I cried. I always cry when I think about her. They‚Äôre happy tears now. At the time they were the tears that would bring me to an internal conflict. 

Was the way I had been treating myself really any better than how other people would treat me?  How much longer do I last if I don‚Äôt try to do this?

‚Ä¶now? 

This is the first time in my life I‚Äôve felt ‚Äúright‚Äù. The first time I feel like ‚Äúme‚Äù. 

I love me, I want my life, I enjoy it, and I want you to know that it‚Äôs THIS community that did that for me. 

Not Reddit or a Facebook group‚Ä¶

Not some queer friend, not rumors, not an advocate, not a rainbow on a coffee cup.

1hgkg3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/1hgkg3p/ive_been_stuck_at_the_youth_with_psychic/,"I've been stuck at the Youth With Psychic Abilities Institute since I was twelve. Today is Christmas eve, and I'm getting out.","I was playing cards with Ethan, a pyrokinetic and a sore loser.

That asshole kept burning the cards to ashes every time I won. 

Ethan, designated as category red, was the closest thing I had to a friend. 

He was a big dude with a surprisingly bigger heart; an ex-high school jock who had become my roomie two years prior. 

I could tell he‚Äôd been popular‚Äîprobably from an affluent family‚Äîso he likely wasn‚Äôt staying long. 

They brought him in one night, kicking and screaming, and strapped him to the bed opposite mine.

For the first few weeks, Ethan wasn‚Äôt allowed to use his hands. 

He sat cross-legged on his bed and told me how he‚Äôd set his entire town alight. 

Sitting in the cremated remnants of his letterman jacket, with his thick brown hair and freckles, he looked like the textbook boy-next-door. I thought he‚Äôd be harder to talk to, but he was oddly talkative. 

At first, I thought it was the drugs they force-fed him, but then he became obsessed with telling me his life story.

And with telling me how he‚Äôd accidentally burnt his girlfriend‚Äôs eyes out, which somehow led to him attempting to torch his entire town? I know, I told him it was extra. 

Ethan insisted it wasn‚Äôt his fault, that there was a ‚Äúvoice‚Äù inside his head telling him to do it, but I already knew I was talking to a category red‚Äîand that was before they even brought in his collar, which mediated his emotions, and was as dehumanising as you would think. 

I admit, I was initially pretty fucking scared of the guy. 

‚Äî

It‚Äôs not exactly brainwashing, but the moment we‚Äôre brought into the institute and categorized as lower levels (blue, indigo, and violet), we‚Äôre taught to steer clear of kids categorized at higher levels. 

Those are the ones who need to be muzzled and collared: pyros like Ethan and kids like Carlisle, the girl in the room next to mine. 

Carlisle was a Speaker, capable of bringing her own words to life, and super powerful for all of her 17 years on earth. 

She told her guard he was suffering from a brain hemorrhage, and seconds later, he was. Carlisle wasn‚Äôt just being held at the YWPA because of her ability. She was being protected from world leaders and other ne'er-do-wells who could easily use her for their own personal gain. 

Kids like Carlisle and Ethan were the lost causes. Here one minute, gone the next. 

I half-expected Ethan to disappear one day while I was being tested on, or forcing down mystery meat that passed as cafeteria food.

But it had been almost two years, and pyro boy was still my roommate.

I was category blue, a high-level telekinetic, so it‚Äôs not like we could relate to each other. 

Ethan was more likely to be executed at eighteen due to the severity of his case.

But weirdly enough, I enjoyed his company.

Just like school, the YWPA had a social hierarchy. Blues, who were most likely to be recruited for some shady government program, were at the top. JJ Walker and Alex Simons, lower-level blues, had already invited me to join their little gang, but I wasn‚Äôt interested in their weird obsession with becoming soldiers. 

I‚Äôd been brought in at twelve: those kids had been at the YWPA since birth, never seeing sunlight and being subtly conditioned to enjoy the idea of becoming mindless drones for some higher power.

Those types of kids were noticeably more feral and animal-like, baring their teeth when guards grabbed them for daily testing. JJ was already giving me cult-leader vibes. Instead of being scared of his ability, he embraced it. 

Meanwhile, I had a feeling the mandatory Friday classes for low-level blues were screwing with their brains‚Äîmaybe even prepping them for recruitment. Luckily, I was able to avoid it.

It wasn't easy at first. But the second I was dragged into a classroom-like setting, with an ancient analogue television at the front, I knew my fate. It was part of being recruited, after all. 

People in the real world weren‚Äôt interested in noncompliant telekinetics. 

They wanted brainless shells. 

There was only one way of getting out of mandatory classes, which were either life lessons for the rare occasion that you would be released, or plain fucking brainwashing. I had no choice but to play the unhinged card‚Äîwhich was risky and could either end with me getting executed or sent to therapy.

So in the cafeteria, I staged a breakdown, pinning several kids to the ceiling. I was taken down almost immediately, of course, and thankfully, instead of ‚Äúmilitary training‚Äù in my schedule, I had ‚ÄúPsychokinetic Therapy.‚Äù 

So, instead of being subjected to what I could only guess was some seriously messed up shit (judging by the rapid decline in the blue‚Äôs humanity), I sat in a room with my personal therapist, who taught me how to manage my power and not abuse it.

Speaking of the other blues, they started being more annoying than usual, sitting at their usual table embedded in a game of silent chess. Which was chess, but nobody talked, and each member used their ability instead of their hands. 

This kind of information has been nailed into my brain since my imprisonment inside the YWPA, so I know the nitty gritty of the category blue. 

When you're categorised as blue, you can either be a low level or a high level. 

Low levels can do simple telekinesis, which is moving or controlling an object or organic matter with their mind. 

High levels, however, can extend their ability to the brain. 

That's one of the reasons why blues are so popular in recruitment. 

Whereas low levels are wanted for their simple ability to move objects, high levels are in demand for their ability to control minds, like influencing or erasing memories, and in some cases, managing a complete take-over of the original organic personality. As a high level, I knew my day was coming sooner or later. 

I couldn't fully master what we called 
Influence yet, but I did successfully manage to push my instructor to punch me in the face, and then erase his memory of performing that action. 

Which meant I was extremely close to being recategorized at a higher level. 

It was Saturday night, which was a free day. Nepo babies were allowed monitored time with their parents, while the rest of us had to keep up appearances in front of the elites, pretending we were having the best time ever and definitely weren‚Äôt being abused and tested on. 

I mean, if these people were as perceptive as they thought, they‚Äôd notice the blood stains. Right?

The Velcro straps on every bed. The execution room, which was just one big industrial furnace.

Every time a kid was burned alive, the YWPA played Taylor Swift at full volume.

When I was thirteen, I was being dragged back to my room in cuffs after standardized testing. I remember the right side of my body was numb and my nose was bleeding, beads of warm red dripping down my chin. It itched as it dried, but I couldn't do much about it. 

The drugs were already destabilizing my limbs, making it impossible to run, my vision swimming in and out of focus. All I could see were clinical white walls crashing into me like ocean waves.

I wasn‚Äôt expecting to hear Taylor Swift. I can‚Äôt remember what song it was, just the same lyrics repeating as I was dragged down the hallway toward a bright orange blur.

You found me, 

You found me,

You found me-e-e-e.

‚ÄúMove,‚Äù my guard ordered, shoving me forward. 

That song followed me all the way back to my room. 

When I was freed from my cuffs and shoved inside, I layed down and pretended I couldn't hear the agonizing screams from adjacent cells slicing through those lyrics. 

I had pretty much accepted my fate as either ending up in there, being fucking barbecued to an upbeat pop song, or joining my fellow blues as a military drone. 

I didn't even fucking dream of walking out of the YWPA on my own two feet. 

With my mind intact, at least.

Christmas in the YWPA was about as fun as you would expect. There was a single Christmas tree themed sticker on the wall for a ‚Äúdecoration.‚Äù 

But I wasn't even sure if some kids even knew what Christmas was. Jessa Harley, who was executed three days after her arrival, asked JJ if he wanted to do a secret Santa, and the boy looked at her like she'd grown a second head. Jessa was another scary one, a category white. 

Her ability was similar to a Speaker, but on a mass scale. So, you can imagine how fucking terrifying she was. 

But she didn't look scary, she looked harmless! Jessa was tiny with orange pigtails and a gentle smile.

As cute and innocent as she looked though, Jessa could obliterate our universe if she wanted to. 

She could also prevent war if she wanted to. The rumor mill churned, and I heard from an Indigo, that Jessa had snapped her own family out of existence. 

But Jessa used her power for small things. She wanted a puppy, and bam, there was one in her lap. 

She wanted a swimming pool, and suddenly, a whole new indoor pool hall just appeared at the end of the first floor. 

She was both a miracle and a curse, and I don't think the YWPA trusted her‚Äì and others were out there hunting her down. 

Jessa was only there for three days, but had left an impression. 

The swimming pool, for example. It's not like we could use it, but it was still there. 

The white plastic seat where she'd sat cross-legged, eagerly asking people's names, sat sadly empty. 

‚Äî

I was losing patience with Ethan, who thought burning my cards would make him a winner. 

The worst part is, he was actually making me laugh, shooting me a grin every time my Queen burst into flames. 

It was funny the first few times, but was getting progressively less entertaining. 

I found myself smiling through gritted teeth just as the large metal door flew open, making me jump. Ethan flinched, his gaze glued to his deck of cards. 

He was about to turn the big one eight, which meant his evaluation was soon.

Execution, or, if they were feeling merciful, maybe a re-sentencing until he was twenty five.

I kicked him under the table when he didn't lay down his cards. 

Ethan kicked me back, his eyes growing frenzied. 

‚ÄúFuck.‚Äù He whispered, his gaze dropping to the table. ‚ÄúI bet they've come for me.‚Äù

I kicked him again, this time reassuringly. ‚ÄúYou're still seventeen, dumbass.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but not for long.‚Äù

I raised a brow. ‚ÄúWhy would they kill you at seventeen?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause they're fucking assholes.‚Äù

Leaning across the shitty fold out table, I fixed him with a smile. ‚ÄúWhat if you're fire-proof?‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right, listen up!‚Äù

The voice snapped me out of it. Twisting around, Warden Carrington stood in the doorway, twirling a pair of metal cuffs. 

She was a stiff, narrow bodied woman with a blonde top-knot and a permanent grin. She took pleasure in escorting kids to be executed. Bile crept up my throat. 

Is that what this was? No, executions were usually private. 

Tests, maybe? 

I was used to mandatory ones every Friday. That's what the cuffs were usually for. We were taken from the rec room individually, cuffed, and dragged to the testing rooms. But it wasn‚Äôt Friday. 

The floors were too clean. I was used to blood seeping across tiles on a testing day. 

I wasn't allowed to look the warden in the eye as a Blue, but I managed a risqu√© glance. She was smiling suggestively, so it had to be an execution. Realization crept in then, that the slight curl on her lip suggested exactly the opposite. 

Recruitment.

I scanned the room.  Fifteen fearful faces staring at her.  

A willowy blonde who had previously been reading a dog eared paperback, was now sitting up straight, her half-lidded eyes wide, almost awake. She caught my gaze, lips pricking into a smile. 

Slowly, the girl inclined her head, a single blonde curl falling into her eyes. She ran her index finger across her throat, mouthing, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre fucked.‚Äù

Could it be Matthews? 

My gaze flicked to the brunette curled up in the corner of the room. Carlisle? I used to talk to her. We were from the same town, so we had that mutual connection. 

But something happened to her after a testing session, and since then, Carlisle shut everyone else out and isolated herself. 

Matthews was immortal, and Carlisle had the power to end the world. 

I doubted either of them were being recruited.

Unless world leaders needed Carlisle, which wasn't entirely out of the realm of possibility. 

‚ÄúThe holidays came early, kids!‚Äù Warden Carrington mocked, and I sensed the group of us all holding a collective breath. 

‚ÄúJohnson!‚Äù she boomed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre getting out of here!‚Äù

There was an awkward silence before Ethan kicked me. 

‚ÄúBro, that's you!‚Äù

He was right. Slowly, I got to my feet, my heart pounding in my chest. 

I was Johnson. 

Which was crazy, because the only kids who made it out of the YWPA alive were either nepo babies or‚Ä¶ 

My excitement started to wither once I'd hugged Ethan a quick goodbye, and offered Carlisle a sympathetic smile. 

I thought, just for a moment, that maybe my Mom had come to get me‚Äì finally, after five years. But my mother was dead. 

I watched a man who called himself Mr. Yellow blow her brains out with a smile, before kneeling in front of me. 

I was standing in my mother‚Äôs blood, watching slow-spreading crimson seeping across her favorite rug.  

‚ÄúHey, there, little boy,‚Äù he said, his eyes maniacal, grin widening. ‚ÄúDo you want to come to a super special place?‚Äù

The ‚Äòsuper special‚Äô place was obviously the YWPA.

I didn't even get to fucking mourn my mother. 

And to everyone in the outside world, twelve year old Johnson had murdered his Mom. 

There were only three ways to get out of YWPA: in a body bag, or the other way‚Äîthe one I dreaded.

Warden Carrington was smiling with way too many teeth when I slowly made my way over to her. She grabbed my arms, linking them behind my back and cuffing me. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been‚Ä¶ recruited!‚Äù

I was dragged out the door and down the hallway. 

At the end, surprisingly, stood a guy my age. He was tall, a pair of raybans pinning back dark blonde hair, wearing a long trench coat that hung off his slim frame.

In his hand was a small paper bag he was swinging excitedly. 

The closer I was getting, being unceremoniously pushed forward by the warden, the guy‚Äôs swinging became more and more eager. I was convinced he was going to accidentally fling the bag in my face. I wasn't expecting to be recruited by a teenager resembling a teen Sherlock Holmes.

‚ÄúHi!‚Äù He greeted me, genuinely excited to see me. The boy motioned for the warden to uncuff me, and she did, making sure to keep hold of my arms, her bony fingers pricking into my flesh. ‚ÄúIt's great to finally see you in person! I‚Äôve been trying to get you out of here for weeks! But there's so much paperwork, and blah, blah, blah, it was a whole mess,‚Äù he rolled his eyes. 

‚ÄúBut here you are!‚Äù His southern accent was already irritating. He grabbed my shoulders with teary eyes like I was a stray fucking cat he had just adopted. 

‚ÄúYou're Johnson, right? I'm Nathanial!‚Äù he held out the bag, and I caught the unmistakable smell of fried food. ‚ÄúDo you want Five Guys?‚Äù

Warden Carrington cleared her throat. ‚ÄúNot in here,‚Äù she drawled, ‚ÄúThe smell will wake up Will.‚Äù

Will was a higher level category yellow (a shifter). But I fully understood why. 

Werewolf. 

Apparently, he'd been sacrificed to the moon during his frat‚Äôs hazing ritual, gaining the ability to shift his flesh to a dog-like beast. As well as adapting a liking for human flesh. There were two incidents with Will, and both of them ended in him cannibalizing at least three inmates. 

Nathaniel looked intrigued, but he kept his mouth shut. I was handed a fresh set of clothes to change into, before being shoved through the main doors. 

I couldn't believe I was actually breathing in real, ice-cold air.

I could feel it tickling my cheeks, blowing my hair out of my eyes.

In the real world, I stuck out like an anomaly in my clinical white shorts and tee.

I was standing on concrete, uneven and gritty beneath my shitty Converse. 

Twisting around, I stared up at the YWPA‚Äîa looming glass building. 

We were in the middle of nowhere. 

I hadn‚Äôt noticed on my way into YWPA because I was blindfolded. Nathanial pointed across the parking lot. There was only one car, and it was his: an expensive, sleek-looking Range Rover. 

I tried to jump into the back, but he patted the passenger seat. 

Nathanial slid into the driver's side. ‚ÄúSo, there are, like, actual werewolves in that place?‚Äù

I shot him a look, resisting the urge to roll my eyes. I didn‚Äôt know why he was fascinated with werewolves when there were kids in there who could snap us out of existence if they were slightly annoyed. 

Slipping onto the warm leather seats, my muscles started to relax. I was so used to the harsh, shitty plastic chairs in the YWPA rec room.

And then there were the blood-stained metal gurneys I had to sit on during testing.

But this‚Äîthis was an actual *seat.* I had missed cars. I‚Äôd missed being able to sink into cushions.

To relax.

Nathanial started the car, cranking up the radio.

Taylor Swift.

Not just Taylor Swift, but that exact same fucking song.

He shot me a grin, reaching into the back and grabbing the bag of Five Guys.

‚ÄúHungry?‚Äù

I was.

I ate the burger in two bites and almost choked on the soda.

‚ÄúDude,‚Äù Nathanial chuckled, side-eyeing me. ‚ÄúThe food isn‚Äôt going to run away.‚Äù

Asshole.

I started inhaling the fries, ignoring his little jab.

‚ÄúI can understand, though. Of course you‚Äôre fucking hungry,‚Äù Nathanial said, his gaze flicking to the road ahead. 

I couldn‚Äôt resist pressing my head against the window, slurping my Coke. 

The vivid red and orange blur of traffic flying past was making me carsick. 

‚ÄúI know what goes on inside that place, and the inhumane shit they do to kids like you makes me enraged.‚Äù

‚ÄúKids like me.‚Äù I stopped chugging, a sour bite to my tone.

He sighed. ‚ÄúYou know that's not what I meant.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounded like it.‚Äù

I caught his expression darken significantly, his fingers tightening around the wheel.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Johnson,‚Äù he said, his tone cracking slightly. ‚ÄúFor what those fucks did to you. I fought to get you out of that place.‚Äù he scoffed. ‚ÄúThey kept trying to shove another kid in my face, but I told them it was either you, or I was out.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù I didn't turn around to look at him, my gaze stuck to blurry holiday lights flying past us. 

They were too bright in contrast to the darkening sky. 

Nathanial didn't respond, cranking up the radio. 

I wasn't buying this guy‚Äôs friendly act. I had a hard time believing his ‚Äòsave the children‚Äô bullshit.  ‚ÄúSo, what do you need me for?‚Äù I asked, making myself comfy. ‚ÄúConstruction? Did your cat get stuck up a tree?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope.‚Äù His lips curled into a smirk. ‚ÄúDo you know what day it is?‚Äù

I gestured to an illuminated snowman outside. 

‚ÄúEaster.‚Äù I deadpanned, and he let out a hyena laugh. 

‚ÄúI'm sorry, how old are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSeventeen.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're funny, Johnson,‚Äù he chuckled, like we were best friends. 

This guy was making it hard for me to not like him. 

I admit, I was taken off guard when he drove me to the airport. 

Nathanial threw his jacket over my shoulders, looking me up and down. ‚ÄúAll right, you're good,‚Äù he ruffled my hair. ‚ÄúLuckily for you, kids our age literally wear anything. So, yes, you may look like you've been institutionalised, but my coat gives you a hipster vibe, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù

I had no idea what he was talking about. He sounded like an Animal Crossing character. 

‚ÄúI don't have an ID,‚Äù I managed to hiss out when he pulled me into the airport. It was surprisingly quiet for Christmas Eve. 

I expected to be questioned about my lack of passport and identity,  but Nathaniel, despite his age and lack of maturity, could easily pull me right through security with a flash of his badge. 

He gestured to a nearby coffee store, handing over way too many bills for a drink. 

‚ÄúFlat white, and a bottle of water,‚Äù he said hurriedly, swiping through his phone. ‚ÄúFeel free to go crazy. Get as much as you want.‚Äù

I had almost 500 dollars pressed into my palm. 

So, yes, I went crazy. 

I almost turned and ran, taking the cash with me. 

But my Mom was dead. There was no home to go back to. 

I bought a double chocolate brownie hot cocoa to go, and turkey and stuffing sub, devouring both of them before I even left the store. Nathanial was waiting for me. 

He sipped his flag-white, leading me straight past the gate. When a guard stepped in front of us, he shot them a smile. ‚ÄúIt's cool, we‚Äôre exceptions,‚Äù he said. 

The guard paused before nodding and stepping aside. 

‚ÄúHave a good flight,  boys,‚Äù his lips broke out into a grin, ‚ÄúOh, and happy holidays!‚Äù

Nathaniel winked at the man, smirking. ‚ÄúYou too, Bobby!‚Äù

I was expecting first class seats, but instead, I was ushered onto a private jet. 

So, Nathanial was riiiiiich, rich. I had a bed as a seat. 

I slept for most of the flight, dreaming I was back in the YWPA, back on my blood stained mattress counting ceiling tiles. 

‚ÄúSo, how is it?‚Äù

Ethan loomed over me with his arms folded. The startling white of his shorts and tee made my eyes hurt. 

I didn't blink, stretching out my stiff legs. His voice was kind of muffled. 

‚ÄúIt's okay, I guess,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI had Five Guys.‚Äù

Ethan pulled a face, tipping his head back. 

‚ÄúUgh. Don't. I‚Äôm pretty sure they gave us recycled slop for dinner.‚Äù

I rolled onto my side. ‚ÄúWas it the chef's special macaroni and cheese?‚Äù

‚ÄúYep.‚Äù Ethan curled his lip. ‚ÄúThey're trying to fucking kill us with the food.‚Äù

I nodded, enjoying my ex roommate‚Äôs company. Though I wasn't sure why he was pacing up and down. ‚ÄúThe second I‚Äôve built up this guy‚Äôs trust, I‚Äôll get you guys out of there.‚Äù

I felt my heart squeeze, and I swallowed sour tasting puke. ‚ÄúBefore you turn eighteen. I'll get you the fuck out of there.‚Äù

Ethan frowned, leaning closer, his brows furrowed like bugs. 

I blinked rapidly. 

Like tiny wiggling little furry bugs. 

‚ÄúDude.‚Äù I was pretty sure there weren't supposed to be two Ethan‚Äôs. The two Ethans leaned forward. ‚ÄúCan't you smell that?‚Äù

I could. 

It was potent, like bleach, suffocating my throat. 

Ethan jerked back, his eyes were wide. ‚ÄúThat smells like‚Äì‚Äù

Reality slammed into me, but my eyes were glued shut. 

I knew exactly what it smelled like. 

I didn't even remember getting off of the plane. 

I  woke up, groggy, in the back of an SUV, my mouth full of metallic ick. 

I tried to move, and I couldn't, my arms reduced to sausages. 

I thought back to the water I sipped on the plane. How it tasted a little too bitter. 

‚ÄúDid you fucking drug me?‚Äù I managed to get out in a hiss. 

I couldn't even panic, my body was paralyzed, my chest heaving, my heavy pants into thick leather seats were suffocating me. 

Nathanial‚Äôs laugh sounded like waves crashing into my skull. 

The car took a sharp turn, and I almost tumbled off of the seat. 

‚ÄúIt's just a small job, Johnson,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre counting on you.‚Äù

It took all my strength to drag myself to the window. 

I could see my breath coming out in clouds of white, tiny white flurries dancing across the pane. 

Snow. 

The drugs were fucking with my head. I slipped in and out of consciousness, dancing between the living and the dead. Ethan was sitting next to me, his head pressed against the window. ‚ÄúHow do you even get out of shit like this?‚Äù he tried the door, slamming his fists against the door. 

‚ÄúLocked,‚Äù he said. 

I managed a spluttered laugh. ‚ÄúNo shit.‚Äù I caught myself. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck do I do?‚Äù

Ethan shrugged, his gaze glued to the snowstorm. ‚ÄúMaybe try diving out of the car?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen it's locked?!‚Äù

Before I could lecture Ethan on basic common sense, the real world slammed into me in waves of ice water‚Äì literally. 

Someone had opened my door, and I could feel the wind chill grazing the back of my neck. 

I opened my eyes when two muscled arms wrapped around me and yanked me out of the car. I couldn't stand, immediately falling limp in his grasp. 

‚ÄúCome on, Johnson,‚Äù Nathanial‚Äôs voice tickled my ear. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre nearly there.‚Äù

I wasn't sure were ‚Äòthere‚Äô was. I was up to my knees in snow, blurred white closing in on me from every angle. With my body immobile, Nathanial dragging me felt fucking dehumanising. He forced my head up, but it kept hanging, my thoughts dancing, my eyes flickering. 

‚ÄúIt's a simple job,‚Äù he said when I was more awake. 

In front of me was‚Ä¶ something. 

It reminded me of a warehouse, a towering structure that almost looked like it was part of the storm. Nathanial pulled me further, chuckling. When I parted my lips to cry out, he promptly slammed his hand over my mouth. 

‚ÄúDo the job well, Johnson, and we‚Äôll think about taking you on full time.‚Äù

We reached a garage-like door, and with the click of a button, it was slowly gliding upwards. 

To my surprise, this place reminded me of a reception area inside a dentist. The floor was carpeted, a cosy lounging area filled with expensive looking sofas, and a TV playing what looked like an old cartoon. 

There was a desk, a short blonde wearing a Christmas hat sitting behind a laptop. 

‚ÄúNate.‚Äù she deadpanned, her gaze stuck to the laptop screen. ‚ÄúDid you get him?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Stella,‚Äù Nathanial‚Äôs tone pricked with sarcasm. ‚ÄúAs you can see, I definitely don't have him.‚Äù

The girl nodded slowly. ‚ÄúCooooooool.‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúGood talk.‚Äù

Ignoring Stella, Nathanial pulled me into an elevator. 

When the doors slid shut, I found my voice, pulling from his grasp, but my body was stiff and wrong. I dropped to my knees, shuffling back. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is this place?‚Äù

The boy didn't answer, leaning against the door, his lips curled into a smirk. 

‚ÄúIt's a super special place.‚Äù

Something sickly crept up my throat. He was mimicking Mr Yellow‚Äôs words. 

My mother‚Äôs murderer. 

When the elevator slid open with a loud groan, the first thing I saw was intense clinical white light. 

The room reminded me of a surgical theatre that had long since been abandoned, flickering lights swinging overhead. I saw the first splatter of blood on the floor right in front of my feet. 

I've grown desensitised to blood over the years, but this was more than a splatter,  a dark crimson streak trailing all the way to the center of the room. There were four plastic chairs positioned in a circle. 

When I glimpsed velcro restraints hanging off of the arm rests, I felt my body start to twist and contort in a desperate attempt to escape. 

Two chairs were occupied by kids my age, metal helmets strapped to their heads; a strawberry blonde girl with her head bowed, her lips and chin stained scarlet. She was limp in the restraints, her body hanging forward. Opposite her was a guy, slumped over, hiding behind thick brown curls. 

There was a growing pool of red stemming around him. 

When he lifted his head, I had to fight back a cry. 

The guy‚Äôs eyes were pearly white, half lidded, all of the color drained from his iris. I recognized it. I had only ever heard of a kid‚Äôs power burning out through word of mouth. I had been taught that our abilities were like a muscle, and like a muscle, you could strain it. The first symptom of burnout was losing all the color in your eyes, but this guy was in the later stages. 

Judging by seeping red oozing from every orifice, he had already suffered multiple haemorrhages. 

My gaze found the helmet on his head. 

They kept bringing him back, forcing his body to revive again and again, purging his power for all it had. His lips were cracked, slick scarlet. I couldn't tell what his ability he possessed, or his level. Just that he was suffering. ‚ÄúYou've gotta be‚Ä¶ fucking‚Ä¶ kidding me,‚Äù he sobbed. 

‚ÄúLucas, it's Christmas.‚Äù Nathanial mockingly scolded. ‚ÄúI told you about profanity.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo fuck yourself.‚Äù

Nathanial forced me to stand. ‚ÄúAll right, introductions!‚Äù he said cheerfully. ‚ÄúGuys, this is Johnson.‚Äù The strawberry blonde jolted in her chair, but she couldn't lift her head. ‚ÄúHe's going to be helping us today.‚Äù

I cringed away when he patted me on the back. ‚ÄúJohnson! This is Luke and Tory! High level blues, and my favorite little helpers.‚Äù

Nathaniel shoved me into a chair, a metal helmet forced onto my head. Nathanial knelt in front of me, his eyes sparkling. 

Insanity, I thought dizzily. But there was something beyond that, a darkness shrouded in his eyes that he didn't want me to see. He pinned my wrists to the armrests, offering me a smile. ‚ÄúYour job,‚Äù he murmured in my ear. ‚ÄúIs *my* old job.‚Äù

He straightened up. ‚ÄúYou see, we kept failing,‚Äù his expression twisted. ‚ÄúEvery fucking year we failed, and more of us died. We couldn't do it. No matter how hard we tried, none of us were strong enough.‚Äù

I fought back, and with a simple twist of his wrist, my body was paralyzed. 

He was strong. 

‚ÄúI was the best we had,‚Äù Nathanial sighed. ‚ÄúThey took me from the YWPA in Vancouver. I was just a kid. Eight, maybe? I was dragged inside this room, forced into one of these fucking chairs, and my brain was fried over and over again, until I was numb,‚Äù he choked out a hysterical giggle. 

‚ÄúI stopped feeling pain around the tenth or twelvth time those fuckers brought me back. But it was okay, because I could do it. I was the only one who COULD fucking do it, so why not use me for all I have?‚Äù

Was he‚Ä¶ crying? 

Nathaniel swiped at his eyes with his sleeve, forcing a smile. ‚ÄúAnyway, then the demand grew, and it was suddenly so much fucking harder to control, or even lift off the ground. I was tortured in an attempt to strengthen my power, but I couldn't do it.‚Äù

His smile widened. ‚ÄúBut you guys are,‚Äù he started to clap. ‚ÄúSo much stronger than me! I mean, you're fucking amazing. Sooo much better than little old me. Luke, who turned his entire town into his personal minions, and Tory! Who went one step further, and expanded her power across an entire country! Making herself Queen!‚Äù

The blonde let out a whimper, her bound hands jerking. 

Nathanial laughed. ‚ÄúIt's charmed rope, you fucking idiot,‚Äù he rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúDeveloped by the CIA in the early 2010‚Äôs when they realized a certain generation were gaining abilities they didn't understand and couldn't control.‚Äù

His eyes found mine. 

‚ÄúJohnson.‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúWhat you did to get yourself in the YWPA was quite remarkable! Honestly, I bow down to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù Luke  whispered, spitting blood on the floor. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I *can't* do‚Ä¶it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, guess what? It's your lucky day, Lucas, because you have help now!‚Äù Nathaniel danced over to him, patting his helmet. When the boy lunged at him, he spluttered. ‚ÄúOoh, bad dog! What did I fucking say about using your teeth?‚Äù

Lucas didn't respond, and I noticed the glint in Nathanial‚Äôs eyes. He wasn't just crazy. This asshole revelled in being in  control. ‚ÄúSoo, over the last few years, we‚Äôve always focused on movement,‚Äù he twisted around, winking at me. ‚ÄúNow that, my fellow freakish children, was a mistake.‚Äù

A large wooden contraption was dragged in.

‚ÄúBecause why focus on movement?‚Äù Nathanial continued. ‚ÄúWhen we have something even better?‚Äù

I recognized what it was. 

The holiday lights strung across the back seat.  

The back, filled with sacks overflowing with wrapped gifts and toys. 

‚ÄúOkay!‚Äù Nathanial shouted to someone above us. ‚ÄúLet's do a test run, all right? Everyone in position?‚Äù

‚ÄúNate.‚Äù Tory‚Äôs strangled cry sliced through the silence. She whipped her head back, her eyes rolling back to pearly whites. ‚ÄúYou're going to kill us!‚Äù

Ignoring her, he turned to me. ‚ÄúHow many people have you taken over, Johnson?‚Äù Nathaniel came closer, his eyes narrowing, lips curving into a spiteful smile. ‚ÄúHow many minds can you force yourself inside?‚Äù

His question sent prickles of ice slipping down my spine. 

I hadn't answered that question in a long time. I was too scared to. 

‚ÄúI don't know,‚Äù I managed to get out. 

‚ÄúAww, come on!‚Äù Nathanial cocked his head. ‚ÄúMaybe‚Ä¶ a million?‚Äù he wagged his brows. ‚ÄúTwo million?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn't mean to,‚Äù the words were choking my throat before I could stop them. I didn't realize how right the chair felt, the restraints, until I was reminded that I really was a fucking monster. ‚ÄúI was just a kid.‚Äù

Nathaniel‚Äôs expression softened, his lip twisting. ‚ÄúI know you were,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo was I when I told my pops to off himself.‚Äù he frowned. ‚ÄúWhich begs the question,‚Äù he hummed. ‚ÄúYou're a category blue at one of the highest levels, and yet the fuck faces back at YWPA decided not to toast you.‚Äù

It looked like he might continue, before a yell cut him off. 

‚ÄúNate, we‚Äôre all ready!‚Äù It sounded like Stella, from upstairs. ‚ÄúI just need your go ahead!‚Äù

Nathanial didn't respond for a moment. He slowly made his way over to me, fixing my helmet on my head, and checking my restraints. I thought he was sympathetic, or maybe he was, in his own fucked up way. But then he was running his hands through my hair, grabbing a fistful, and forcing me to look at him. 

His eyes terrified me. Not because of his ability, or his descent into madness. 

But because somewhere, deep, deep down, twisted in traumatised eyes filled with agony, I think part of him didn't even want to do this. 

‚ÄúWhat you did, Johnson,‚Äù he whispered, ‚ÄúFifteen years ago. I want you to do it again.‚Äù 

Turning to the others, the boy grinned. 

‚ÄúHow many children are on the planet, hmm? How many of those little fuckers believe in the big guy?‚Äù

I didn't notice it at first. 

The pain. It was numb first, dull, like a phantom nothing dancing across my skull. 

It was like being hit by lightning an infinite number of times. 

Each one hit the back of my head, burning a hole inside it. 

I didn't realize I was screaming, crying, choking on my blood  begging for mercy. 

When I was a kid, it almost felt like drowning. I didn't feel pain, instead, a stark numbness taking hold of me, and the crushing weight of names, wishes, memories, thoughts, bleeding inside me. 

Back then, I barely grazed their minds. I just gave them an order, and they did it. 

Then I let go, plunging down, down, down, and awakening in my mother‚Äôs arms. 

This time, I found each and every one. Ones that had grown up with me, and ones that were much younger, entangling myself with them. I could feel my brain coming apart, bleeding, running down my temples, and seeping down the back of my neck. ‚Äú2.4 billion,‚Äù Nathanial said. ‚ÄúThat's 2.4 billion minds to give one simple order.‚Äù

Fly. 

The word twisted on my lips, but that was more prominent inside my mind. 

Whatever was on my head, the helmet strapped to my skull, I could feel it moulding itself to my spinal chord, a screech ripping from my lips. 

I was burning, suddenly, my brain igniting, my body jerking left and right. 

I could already feel wet warmth running from my nose, my lips, my ears, every vessel inside me coming apart, a neutron star collision dancing across the backs of my eyes. The command was already inside my head. 

Our heads. 

I could sense and feel, almost touch Luke‚Äôs mind. 

Tory was harder, fading in and out, her body was already failing, already rejecting it. 

In front of me, the wooden contraption moved slightly, and Lucas‚Äôs head dropped. When it started to hover, Tory‚Äôs scream grew feral, animalistic, her cries growing into pleads, begging for death. 

The sleigh had taken flight, hovering above us. 

But I couldn't sense Luke anymore. That entangled string binding us together, had been cut. Through half lidded eyes, I think he was moving, his fingers still twitching under velcro straps. 

There was a gaping cavern of glistening gore where Tory‚Äôs brain was supposed to be, slimy pinkish grey splattering the ground around her chair. 

But the sleigh was flying, and despite the agony ripping through me, my body slowly shutting down, my mouth became a smile. 

I was aware of my head going limp, all of me slumping, my head tipping back. 

‚ÄúThat's right!‚Äù Nathanial‚Äôs voice was fading. ‚ÄúMake Santa flyyyyyyyyyy.‚Äù

Yeah, I thought, unable to resist a spluttered giggle. 

I was making Santa fly.

After three test runs, and then the real thing, spluttering on my last gasps of air. 

But, with the children's help, we really had saved Christmas. 

I was partially aware of Nathanial lifting me from the chair and dumping my body somewhere cold, somewhere where the ice cold chill was merciful on my soul. 

Dying felt weirdly comfortable, kind of like falling asleep. 

I always thought I would die on a surgical table, my body used for research. 

Or burned to ashes in the incinerator. 

Almost death was‚Ä¶ cozy. 

‚ÄúI'm, like, really fucking warm.‚Äù

Ethan‚Äôs voice pricked into my mind, and I found myself side by side with him. He was lying on something ice cold, his wrists strapped down. I didn't know what to say, so I rolled onto my back, ‚ÄúWell, I'm pretty sure I'm dying.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBut you're dying in a cool way.‚Äù Ethan chuckled. ‚ÄúDriving freakin‚Äô Santa's sleigh. That's one hell of a way to go out, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúMmm.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAlso, of hypothermia.‚Äù

I noticed where we were, sitting up, my head hitting the ceiling. 

Wherever we were was too narrow and claustrophobic. 

‚ÄúFuck.‚Äù I hissed, kicking the ceiling. ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd‚Ä¶ rather not answer that,‚Äù Ethan said, shooting me a sickly smile. ‚ÄúCan we just‚Ä¶ talk?‚Äù

I pretended not to see the ignition of oranges getting brighter and brighter. 

Closer and closer. 

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù I said, swallowing a cry. ‚ÄúWe can‚Ä¶ talk.‚Äù 

‚ÄòCarlisle escaped today,‚Äù he murmured, after a moment. ‚ÄúSo, expect the world to get a whole lot fucking crazier with her free.‚Äù

Those were words I really did not want to hear. 

Still, though. With Carlisle free, maybe anything was possible. 

The orange blur was growing bigger, and I squeezed my eyes shut. 

I had to wake up, to get out the snow. To live. Because I was going to freeze to death. 

But I didn't want to leave him. 

‚ÄúMerry Christmas, Johnson,‚Äù Ethan murmured, his wide smile erupting into raging fire melting the flesh from his bones. ‚ÄúAnd happy fucking birthday to me.""",13,1734468526.0,ByfelsDisciple,0,1.0,False

I initially had a crush on this person when I first started at my job, but he was in a relationship. Over the past year they had broken up, but me and my coworker, let‚Äôs call him James, have become close. The crush faded, and we have had a great dynamic and routine. We bring our dogs to the park together, go out for coffee, cook and stay over each others apartments, watch movies together, go out with each others friends etc. it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre in a relationship but not romantic. We joke that we are like an old married couple. 

We are both single and on dating apps, but he goes out on dates way more than me. I get a lot of anxiety around dating. 

He is very physically comfortable with me. Will lay on me when we watch movies etc.  Our dogs are very cuddly to so we usually just do a cuddle puddle. He used to ask for back massages all the time, and I obliged for a while but then drew a boundary. 

Last night was weird. He came over my place for dinner, we watched tv on the couch, super cuddle as usual and he planned to stay over. He stays on the couch at my place as I do at his. He asks for a back rub and I say no and go to my room. We‚Äôre still talking between the rooms and trying to get the dogs to stay with us. He gets up gets water, I get up etc. He invites me to come snuggle on the couch and we wind up spooning and talking. Joking about it not being a coworker dynamic. We reminisce on our friendship over the last year. His arms are around me and he rubs my back. Feels super intimate. He says I should go to bed so I get up and do. It‚Äôs definitely tense though.  I stay up torn because I feel old crush feelings resurfacing. 

Then this morning first thing he does is announce he has a date tonight. Not unusual since we talk about our bumble matches, just weird first thing in the morning. I‚Äôm trying not to be weird even though my mind is all confused about the night before. Later during the day he says he found a date for me. I joked with him previously saying he should set me up with one of his friends, but hadn‚Äôt in the entire time we‚Äôve known each other. One time I expressed interest in his friend and he got very jealous because the friend flirted with me back. 

Now I‚Äôm torn because I don‚Äôt want to get all caught up in these feelings I thought I was over, and u don‚Äôt want work to become weird. I crave the intimacy of our relationship, but also feel like I‚Äôm being breadcrumbed with affection. Has anyone navigated anything like this before? ",0,1734468477.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False

I hate seeing people feel stuck or like they should give up. Believe me, I feel like that often. This is more geared toward people starting out freelancing.¬†  
  
With the exception of a few years full time in a small corporate focused production¬†company, I've been freelancing for nine years in a midsized market. In that time I've gone from making 20-30k a year to well into six figures.¬†  
  
The important¬†part of that information is¬†**I do not have any exceptional skills.**¬†I see much better editors, better mograh artists, better art directors All. The. Time. You can make a very nice living by being¬†**reliable, friendly, calm, and fast.**¬†  
  
People post about applying to dozens of jobs on linkedin and never hearing anything back. That does not surprise me at all. I see these jobs for mediocre salaries with 1,500 applicants and I get scared just imagining it. The truth is, that producer is probably just going to end up hiring someone their friend recommended to them anyway. Feel free to apply, but in my opinion that is a complete dead end. If you want to break out of the 40-50k salary zone,¬†**stop applying to small production companies**. You need to be talking to the¬†**advertising agencies**. They are the ones with the clients with¬†**money**. Sometimes production companies do the editing, but many agencies do their post in-house.¬†  
  
Great, you say. Just get in with big advertising agencies, easier said than done. True. You need to be tracking down and emailing the¬†**post supervisors and post producers**. They are the ones deciding who to hire for jobs. FInd them on the company website, find them on linkedin,¬†**find projects this ad agency has just produced and find them in the credits**. Many of the post¬†producers are also freelancers. Email them to introduce yourself, say you love X thing they just did, and tell them you would love to work together sometime. Be persistent, but not annoying. Check in every couple months, see if they have any upcoming projects they might need a hand with. Do this every couple months with a couple dozen places.  
  
There is no way around it, this is a long grind of meeting people, getting¬†a million coffees to ""chat"" and getting ghosted. All of these producers already have a stable of people they call on regularly.¬†**The objective is getting on that list**. It's only going to happen when they have tried A, B, C, D, E and in a panic they remember some guy had emailed them about editing work. That is your shot. Nail that job and you are in. Now just make it happen with a dozen other places and you have a career on your hands. But the first one is the hardest.  
  
The first thing they will ask you when that job does appear is, ""What's your rate?"" Have an answer ready. Talk to colleagues, check glass door, or check the handy post production survey that will shortly¬†get posted here for this year ([https://www.postproductiondata.com](https://www.postproductiondata.com/)). Starting out, you need to¬†**take the amount you are afraid to ask for and add at least 30%**. Don't start out low balling yourself. The ad agencies almost don't care what your rate is, they are going to take it¬†**x3 and charge it to the client**. Any decent sized place is going to be looking for a day rate, not hourly, not by project.¬†

1hgkdaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hgkdaw/should_i_be_worried_tw_vomit/,Should I be worried? TW: Vomit,"Hey y‚Äôall 24NB AFAB. 

I have been vomiting every month for over a year now. I‚Äôm on sertraline which I know can cause nausea but I‚Äôve been on it for 3.5 years and haven‚Äôt had problems before. I also take zopiclone, parazosin, b-complex and magnesium bi-gylcinate for sleep and the birth control patch. About half of the vomiting this year has been about a week prior to menstruating but not consistently.

 I feel it worth to note prior to the past year and a bit I‚Äôve not had a history of vomiting unless I was really sick. Not during menstruation rarely when i was nauseous. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs stress related because I have been in therapy for years and can identify when I‚Äôm stressed. I have used anti-acids, gravol and herbal solutions to help nausea. It sometimes works but sometimes does jack.

Generally the vomit doesn‚Äôt have food in it, it‚Äôs mostly bile either clear or yellowy. No coffee grounds, no blood. I drink at least 20 oz of water a day on average.

Please help me. I am trying to figure out what bag I should use for work. I have tried to many things and different combinations of bags and find myself very frustrated with the situation. Let me set the stage, I work at a hospital in psych SW and have to walk like 10-15 mins from my car to my unit so it takes a while to carry stuff in and usually I am carrying a coffee tbh lol. I hate having multiple bags so I would prefer to just have one but I have stared to have more and more items I bring with me to work.

I tried a convertible bag that had a lunch spot on the bottom but my lunch was sometimes too big to fit it or it got gross after a while. I bought a lunchbox that it is washable and is pretty small from Target and like that but I don't want to carry it separately. I now have to bring a laptop around due to limited working area/I work on schedules for other SWs and may need to use it so now have that and a charger. I also have a file binder with time off requests in it that I carry around with the schedule as well as my planner, my water bottle, my kindle, my headphones, my journal, my pencil case, some amount of toiletries and then either a wallet/my keys or like a small purse at times.

I have been looking into White Elm as they have a bag that is a tote/converts into a backpack which seems most promising but I am afraid to pull the trigger. Also Poppy Peonies has one that seems good but afraid it'll be too small also. I was using my BEIS like travel tote and it fits mostly everything but not my lunch and I can't even use the water bottle spot with everything else in there. Any thoughts/ideas or should I just say it's my destiny to bring two bags forever?",1,1734468171.0,socialwork,3,1.0,False

1hgk8s4,https://i.redd.it/26cd97wszg7e1.jpeg,New Series: YOU ARE THE VOICE OF THE WORLD - Challenge 5,"WELCOME TO MY NEW CHALLENGE SERIES!!!

Here in this series I shall be posting about various people that I either know (through DMs) or have made up and their personality traits as well as their desires will be given in the post and you guys will be tasked with interpreting their will, nature and desires to give them a new body, a new race, a new beginning, their own Unique Skills and their Ultimate versions. Simple enough right?

Well then let's see if you shall be generous to the contenders like the World was to Rimuru, Hinata, Masayuki etc. or will you be cruel and capricious giving them weak powers and leading them down a path of hardship and suffering.

The main reason for this challenge series is to help people who love all sorts of Anime, Mangas, Manhwa, Shows, Movies and other fictional works and have always wondered what it would be like to be Isekai'd to those worlds and how they would interact with it and of course the Most important part of it all the Power Systems of these worlds, more precisely worlds whose power systems are personality based or rely heavily upon the nature, experiences and behaviors of an
Individual as well as
individual as well as their personality traits and cognitive abilities to give them unique and special powers and abilities. In that regard Tensura is one of the best as it allows for people to think about their own Unique and Ultimate Skills born from their personality, will, and desires to create a power that is truly their own and perfect for them and is a literal impression of their Mind upon reality. More often than not this desire to understand one's own nature and the fascination with such things results in creative pursuits such as writing, drawing, fanfics, and creating OCs, as such I wish to help everyone find a way to not only see what they think of themselves and what skills they think they will have but what others after analyzing their personality think they will have.


Which is why for today‚Äôs challenge we have a redditor who is a fellow Tensura enjoyer that has DM‚Äôd me rather personal stuff and done his bet to gather information about his personality and nature so that he may get this Tensura build. Please be respectful and not make any comments on the challenger today as this is very deep and personal stuff that most of wouldn‚Äôt ever share and so please keep this mind for the new challenger as well who have DM‚Äôd me and will be featured later in other challenges. 



Challenge 5 - Woman in her 20‚Äôs who is currently preparing for an exam to apply for her dream job. She seems to somewhat struggle with her goals, desires and dreams and is often insecure about them because she isn‚Äôt certain if what she believes to be her dream is truly her calling. She is relatively hard working in hopes of achieving her dream, but she has heard other people talk about their dreams, hopes and desires, and they all seem so passionate and overwhelmingly engrossed with them that they are willing to do anything, but she herself has never felt that way about anything regardless of what it may be and she has felt something similar for her current supposed dream but it‚Äôs not quite the same. She has tried to find her true calling by various personality tests, introspection, going through various jobs, hobbies and other things but nothing has ever truly felt like it.

Despite the seeming insecurities about her dreams, she is quite confident in herself and because of her confidence it is easier to connect with others, though sometimes the people she is friends with bring about feelings of inadequacy in her due to their accomplishments and their skills, but regardless she is happy for them whenever they achieve something. Despite her social nature, she is actually quite introverted preferring her own company and is constantly watching or reading something in her free time.

She is exceptionally clever having a superior IQ level and has always been considered wise for her age, usually calm, cool and collected but also somewhat clumsy. She loves animals and believes them to be precious but not all animals and despite her love and kind nature towards animals she herself is quite fearful of them if they are around her and not separated from her via a door or something that keeps them at a distance, a sort of love from afar. She often finds Villains to be more fascinating and relatable than Heroes. Her interests revolve around topics like nature vs nurture, life, death and the secrets of the cosmos, and finds certain conspiracy theories interesting.

She can be rather Judgmental due to her impressive intellect and often finds flaws in things. She has a great deal of skill in creative pursuits such as writing, poetry, painting etc. she can play the piano to a degree and the violin.

She is very kind and caring for her friends and family and for animals but for most others she is indifferent. She doesn‚Äôt like to go out too often but is often dragged around by her friends she is also quite a drama queen and loves to exaggerate things believing it to be romantic and poetic. She hates arrogant, cocky, entitled and annoying people who are extremely prideful being really stupid and being always saved by their luck.

She is often fascinated by various topics and usually learns everything there is to know about them purely because she is intrigued but after a while ends forgetting whatever she acquired. She has a vivid imagination, which she uses as fuel for her art and creative pursuit, she enjoys the more dark, and eldritch types of stories and art as well as beautiful pictures of nature. Despite her intrigue with darker aspects of her psyche she isn‚Äôt beholden to it and enjoys the simple and elegant beauty of nature, often finding solace and comfort underneath the branches of a tree and the protection it provides from the scorching heat of the Sun, the smell of grass after heavy rainfall and the trickling noises made by the water, the smell of roasted coffee beans etc.

She adores the comfort of her own home as well if not more so than nature, her preference for comfort is paramount. She prefers cozy movies, shows and environments. To her a perfect day is when she has nothing to do, no obligations of any kind, and heavy rainfall with some thunder outside as it stays in the periphery of her view while she watches a cozy movie or show with her favorite snacks, food and drinks. She has a great big collection of old books that she often flips through in her free time. She enjoys cooking as a hobby and makes some drinks like hot cocoa to enjoy with books or movies. She has a strong opinion on the ways stories are written and portrayed via different mediums.

She believes that every moment of life must be appreciated and tries to live in the present as much as she can. Her brain is constantly thinking of a multitude of things, about all her problems and troubles and her many ideas for art and stories.

She‚Äôs still figuring out who she is, and hopes to gain insights from this community through this Tensura build.


Scenario 1 - Reincarnation Rimuru style to Cardinal World, however no events of death or such will be mentioned as this is a real person and so you may creatively think in that regard.

Scenario 2 - Summoning into Cardinal World by a dying adventurer to kill a monster that wiped out their party.

1hgk6zb,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1hgk6zb/why_do_i_still_think_about_her/,Why do I still think about her?,"There is something deeply wrong in my brain. A few years ago I worked at a coffee shop. I had previously had what I thought was my heart broken and had money saved up so I spent 10 months being higher than hell and hardly ate. About 6 months in I watched the punisher and my hero academia and it actually inspired me to work on my own body. (I know, lame)

I got myself a job at a coffee shop and it was really fun actually. I got to focus on easy tasks, I worked really early in the morning, my coworkers were (mostly) all cool and friendly, and many of them were very attractive women, which is just nice to be around. 

One girl in particular I hit it off with immediately. She was incredibly kind, with a sense of humor that meshed with mine impeccably. We were instant work friends. I worked there for about 7 months and decided I needed to make more money and ended up finding out the phone provider store just a couple spots down in the same strip mall was looking for an employee and I was really good at customer service and wanted to get into sales, so it seemed like a no brainer.

I got the job, and you might think that we drifted apart at this time, but the opposite happened. Not at first, we would only text on Snapchat very occasionally but I went on vacation to visit my grandfather and it was really boring so we started texting all the time. Here‚Äôs the problem, the entire time I‚Äôd known her, she had been in a 4 year long relationship with a guy who I went to highschool with. I respected them both and our messaging was strictly friendly, at first.

The more I got to know her the more I liked her, and she was really into me as well. Where I worked there were only 3 of us to run the whole store and our company got bought out, changing everything like the apps we used, pay structure, etc and my boss and coworker couldn‚Äôt handle it. I was all alone to run a store and it was stressful. 

She would listen to me complain about rude customers and I would listen to her. She would bring me free coffee and write me cute little encouraging notes on them. She would hang out with me in an empty store or just listen to me help customers and I was on the moon. This girl was kind, funny wonderful to be around and genuinely loved spending time with me no matter how mundane. 

I started to respect her current relationship less and less, as did she. She would tell me all of the problems in the relationship and I asked her why she didn‚Äôt just break up with them,  it they lived together and had cats and stuff so it was harder than I gave it credit. Eventually it reached a point where I told her that I was catching feelings and it wasn‚Äôt right when she refused to leave this other guy so maybe this thing had run its course. She admitted to catching feelings too and didn‚Äôt know where that left us, and I said specifically ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm that guy you think about years later and wonder what could have been.‚Äù

I deleted her snap and her phone number and went on with my days. Got a couple employees hired and was overall decently happy with my life. For 9 days. I was driving home from work and swear I saw something under my window wiper, and when I got home I unfolded an honest to god handwritten note. In the note she expressed how much I meant to her and specifically said the line I wrote to her scared her and she didn‚Äôt want things to end this way. Part of me wishes I threw that note in the trash and went on with my life.

But I didn‚Äôt. I had never had someone express that kind of care for me and I was hooked right back in. We started spending more time together, and I worked up the courage to ask her to come over to hang out. She did and we watched a show we both loved. It was so awkward at first, we were two people who were so comfortable with each other but in this new ‚Äúromantic‚Äù setting we were like statues. After the first episode ended I decided to grow some balls and put my arm around her shoulder.

When I say I will never forget the feeling of her leaning in to me, I mean it. It felt like a fucking supernova went off in my chest and I never wanted to stop holding her. After a few hours she said she had to get back home or her boyfriend would get worried. That shit was always looking in the back of my head and I hated I was falling for someone who was I in a relationship. As she was about to leave walked her to the front door, and she stared at me. 

To jump back a bit, that other relationship I was in ended because she lost feelings for me because time and time again, I had the opportunity to kiss her and I wussed out each time until she finally lost patience. All of that is running through my head and I‚Äôm thinking about how much I don‚Äôt want to lose her too and I just lean in for the kiss and oh my fucking god. If her leaning in was a supernova this shit was the Big Bang.

I walked her out to her car and could not stop smiling for the rest of the night. She came over pretty frequently after that. We got more intimate but it was very incremental, we were just enjoying each other‚Äôs company. Eventually she invited me to her friend‚Äôs wedding as her plus 1. It was out of town and we would have to get a hotel room. Of course I said yes, I didn‚Äôt care about her boyfriend anymore and she assured me they were basically over and she was looking for a different place to live.

After a couple months and with the wedding fast approaching things got a little weird. She started cancelling our hangouts. She was being more short with her messages and she just seemed withdrawn in general. I assumed it was the stress at work and with her planning her move so I stayed supportive while giving her a little space.

Then came the text that ruined my life. It was on the Fourth of July and she messaged me asking if it was ok if she brought her friend instead of me to the wedding. It was a punch to the gut. No it was more like a roundhouse kick covered in razorblades. I tried to get to the reason why she suddenly wanted to remove me from the plan and instead of explaining she just got angry and shut down. I was devastated. I remember lying on my side crying the deepest soul wrenching tears I have ever felt.

All of that effort, the ups and downs over the course of over a year and a half, was gone in an instant. What I thought was heartbreak before wasn‚Äôt a drop in the ocean compared to this. I hated myself for letting this happen. I was just going through the motions. Work was no longer engaging and the worst part was that I had to see her car, the car of the person I loved more than anyone in the world, fifty feet away from where I work. She may as well been in a different galaxy.

After a month or so I couldn‚Äôt handle it so I did what I always do. I ran. I moved to a different state, got a new job, started drinking heavily and spent copious amounts of money. I went from over 800 credit score with zero debt and 10k sitting in my bank account to no money, 10k in debt and a rapidly decreasing credit score over the course of a year.

It didn‚Äôt matter what I did, she was always creeping into my mind. What was she up to? Was she happy with how things turned out? Did she regret ever getting involved with me to begin with? Questions I will never know the answer to. It‚Äôs now been over 2 years since the whole ordeal and she still appears in my dreams. She is exactly how I remember, sweet and lovely to be around and when I wake up I get this horrible pain in my heart. It‚Äôs like losing her all over again.

Even today if she were to reach out and say she wants me back, I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to get back with her even after everything I‚Äôve endured. Before you ask, yes, I‚Äôve been with women since and multiple have expressed their love for me and all I feel is hollow. I feel nothing for these people because nobody will ever hold a candle to the one I truly loved.

I don‚Äôt know who this is for, and I don‚Äôt know what I want. What I do know is this isn‚Äôt healthy and no matter what I do I can‚Äôt shake her from my mind. Even now there is a little part of me hoping she somehow sees this and recognizes the story and reaches out to me. What the fuck is wrong with me? Am I just broken? I just don‚Äôt want to live with this vice grips on my heart anymore but nothing I do seems to work. Anything you can think of, I‚Äôve tried, trust me. At this point I‚Äôm starting to think I will never be fully happy again and I‚Äôm wondering why I‚Äôm even here.",0,1734467842.0,self,1,0.5,False

Setting: A small, snowy hometown during Christmas. Twinkling lights line the streets, festive decorations are everywhere, and the air is filled with the smell of hot cocoa and pine.

Plot:
Years ago, two high school sweethearts broke up (we can brainstorm why‚Äîdistance, a misunderstanding, or even a family issue). He left town for good, chasing dreams or escaping the memories, while she stayed behind, quietly rebuilding her life. What he didn‚Äôt know was that she was pregnant. Now, a few years later, he returns home for Christmas‚Äîmaybe for family, maybe because something in him just needed to be there.

When they run into each other‚Äîat the town‚Äôs Christmas festival, a cozy coffee shop, or maybe in line buying a Christmas tree‚Äîhe discovers the truth. She has a little one now, their little one, and suddenly all the years apart feel so much heavier.

From there, it‚Äôs a mix of sweet nostalgia, slow reconnection, and cozy Christmas moments‚Äîsledding, decorating a tree together, Christmas movie nights, and maybe a chance at rebuilding what they lost.

Roles:
	‚Ä¢	My character: The mom, independent and strong, who‚Äôs worked hard to give her child the best life. She may be a little guarded but still has that spark from their youth.
	‚Ä¢	Your character: The ex, now older, more mature, and back in town with his own regrets and realizations. He didn‚Äôt expect to see her again‚Äîlet alone find out he‚Äôs a father.

Themes: Wholesome, second chances, family, and the magic of Christmas.

Coffee is used to get by but I have a professional cert to do Thursday and feel with all the prep over these last few months it may be 665 down the drain. I couldn't get my energy to get up and push. I barely got through the first section of the full practice test. The mini ones not bad but this is a beast. Getting this cert could be the thing to help me break this 2 yr job search drought as the company I'm w is small and abusive in the most passive aggressive way. I feel like a failure for not having been able to be further along in life so when this peri thing hits I would have more margin. I thought w my cycle starting yesterday I would be on good sleep for a few days. I want to cry from just sheer exhaustion but to me for me tears don't really do much and  for me a sign of weakness. I know from others view it's not but I shouldn't be having emotional reactions it's a neurodiverse and spiritual trait. 

I just needed to get that out of my head before trying to resume practice testing.",1,1734467585.0,Menopause,2,0.67,False

1hgk2je,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1hgk2je/aita_for_blaming_my_bully_work_colleague_for/,AITA for blaming my bully work colleague for putting poop in the bin!  ,"So this isn‚Äôt actually my story it‚Äôs actually my friends but it‚Äôs too funny in my eyes not to share and get your opinions. 
My friend (34) we‚Äôll call her Emily and her work colleague from hell (52) we‚Äôll call her Janet have had a horrible relationship since my friend started working there 3 years ago. Janet had worked there a long time before Emily started in the company and Janet took a disliking to her straight away. Janet would make snide remarks, spread rumours, such as she only got into the company by sleeping with the manager and would blame everything that went wrong on Emily. She would accuse her of stealing if something went missing in the office and would even make comments such as I hate when people eat so loud when Emily was eating. She was just all round making her every working day miserable and an uncomfortable environment for Emily to be in. These things become more and more obvious after Emily got the promotion that Janet wanted, she even went around the other work colleagues suggesting to them that Emily only got the promotion because she was having an affair with the manager. 
Anyway, here‚Äôs the judgement part that I just found absolutely hysterical.
Emily suffers with really bad IBS. She has done for many years and when she has to go she HAS to go. This one day Emily rang me saying she was really struggling but had no time to go home for a poop and was worried she wouldn‚Äôt make it through the day. Side note, Emily is not one for pooping in public she has poop anxiety!!! I didn‚Äôt hear much off her until a bit later on when she text me panicking. Emily had ended up going to the toilet for a poop but because she held it in for so long it must have become bunged up and it blocked the toilet !!!! I have NO idea why Emily thought this next part was even an option but I‚Äôve not stopped laughing about it since she told me. Emily decided instead of people knowing she had pooped (there is only 1 toilet in the office so people can see who‚Äôs last been in) her poop anxiety must have gotten the better of her and she ended up scooping her poop out of the toilet in a plastic bag that she found in the tissue bin and put the POOP in the SANITARY BIN !!! Emily then  left and sat back at her desk, obviously in complete shock at what she‚Äôd just done and even more anxiety than before. However this is where Emily got her revenge. JANET, decided to go to the toilet on her break not long after Emily had scooped her poop into the bin. By this point the office staff started to smell a funny smell and were all talking about it. Emily laughed and said ‚ÄòJanet must be taking a massive dump‚Äô and everyone laughed with her commenting more and more on the smell. After Janet had finished on the toilet she went to the cafeteria for a coffee. Emily then told her colleagues she was going to check in the toilet to see if she had blocked it because the smell was horrible. Emily then came out of the toilet and announced to the whole office that Janet had put a poop in the bin! The whole office was stunned and could not their tears from laughing so hard and the look of disgust at the same time she said was just comical. This was the talk of the town for the next day or so and then the weekend passed. After the weekend, management must have caught wind of the situation (excuse the pun) and held an office meeting saying how unhygienic and that it was a health hazard to put faeces anywhere other than the toilet itself. Everyone in the office obviously thought it was Janet so was silently sniggering at her but Janet just looked in utter shock and had no idea who it could have been. 
Emily has since been feeling quite guilty about this but I just thought it was the best ‚Äòwork bully revenge‚Äô that I‚Äôd ever heard of. Anyway, is Emily the A hole and did she take it too far for blaming her work bully for putting poop in the bin. ",5,1734467507.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,3,0.73,False

Setting: A small, snowy hometown during Christmas. Twinkling lights line the streets, festive decorations are everywhere, and the air is filled with the smell of hot cocoa and pine.

Plot:
Years ago, two high school sweethearts broke up (we can brainstorm why‚Äîdistance, a misunderstanding, or even a family issue). He left town for good, chasing dreams or escaping the memories, while she stayed behind, quietly rebuilding her life. What he didn‚Äôt know was that she was pregnant. Now, a few years later, he returns home for Christmas‚Äîmaybe for family, maybe because something in him just needed to be there.

When they run into each other‚Äîat the town‚Äôs Christmas festival, a cozy coffee shop, or maybe in line buying a Christmas tree‚Äîhe discovers the truth. She has a little one now, their little one, and suddenly all the years apart feel so much heavier.

From there, it‚Äôs a mix of sweet nostalgia, slow reconnection, and cozy Christmas moments‚Äîsledding, decorating a tree together, Christmas movie nights, and maybe a chance at rebuilding what they lost.

Roles:
	‚Ä¢	My character: The mom, independent and strong, who‚Äôs worked hard to give her child the best life. She may be a little guarded but still has that spark from their youth.
	‚Ä¢	Your character: The ex, now older, more mature, and back in town with his own regrets and realizations. He didn‚Äôt expect to see her again‚Äîlet alone find out he‚Äôs a father.

1hgk2fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hilton/comments/1hgk2fe/beware_hilton_phoenix_airport/,Beware Hilton Phoenix Airport,"Arrived at the airport after midnight. Called for shuttle. Took forever. Arrived and no-one at front desk. Waited 5 minutes or so. Breakfast, F&B didn't cover pancakes and waffles. Coffee $10 for 2. Definitely wouldn't have covered the buffet. Morning shuttle to airport, another 30 minute+ wait for a 5 minute ride on a Sunday.

The kicker, a $500 room smoking cleaning fee when absolutely no one smoked in the room. Thought the room smelled funny when we got there, but whatever, we were there for less than 8 hours. Think they sent me an updated folio? No. Think the manager called me back? No!

The shuttle drivers, waitress and front desk were friendly enough.

1hgk1vp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hgk1vp/is_she_interested/,Is she interested? ,"So, I got a girl's number a little over a week ago after the gym. I stopped her on her way out, and we chatted for a solid 30 minutes. During our conversation, I asked if she wanted to grab coffee, and she said yes enthusiastically. We kept talking for another 15 minutes before I had to leave. Right before we left, she mentioned that she was glad I stopped her.

After I got her number that day, I sent her a text saying, ""Hey it's me"" and she responded saying ""Hi I'm glad you didn't take a week to respond lol"" We exchanged a few texts throughout the week, and she even said she wants to hear all about my job at our coffee date. The week before our coffee date was her last week of grad school, so I know she was swamped with work. On top of that, she had just started a new job a few days before I got her number, and she's a single mom.

That week, I ran into her at the gym a few times, and we had a couple of brief chats. She told me about her parents and her new job. Later that night I responded to a text she sent before the gym and I sent her a text, but didn't get a reply for about two and a half days. The day before the coffee date, she texted me saying her schedule had been packed due to her birthday and the holidays. She asked if we could reschedule for after the holidays. I replied that it was fine, gave her my availability, and told her to let me know what works for her. She responded saying ""I will!"" and followed up by asking how my weekend was. I figured the follow up question was a good sign because it shows she's still interested. 

My question is, do you think she changed her mind about going out with me and gave an ambiguous time frame in the hopes that the topic of setting up a date would just fade away (since she said ""after the holidays"" without specifying a date)? Or do you think she'll actually want to go on the coffee date once things settle down? I'll be seeing her at the gym this week and continuing to chat with her, and maybe she'll apologize in person for canceling last minute. Not that I'm expecting an apology.",0,1734467458.0,dating_advice,2,0.5,False

1hgjz4y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hgjz4y,[Selling][USA] Nakagawa blue 1 Damascus 170mm Bunka and Masashi W2 135mm petty both new,"I come to sell these 2 knives and to say good bye. My wife almost killed me when I sold my Yoshikane after cooking only one meal. If she finds out I sold these 2 without having cooked anything she will definitely have my head on a platter ü§£

The Nakagawa has cut 3 grapes lol that's it. The petty has seen no food whatsoever. 

Disclaimer, I did a coffee patina on both which I hope doesn't deter you from picking them up. I did remove the patina on the Bunka since it was only a light patina it came off easily. If I didn't tell you you'd probably not notice I did it. 
I left the patina on the petty but I can see how it turns out if I remove it as well if you'd like. But in it's current state it looks bad ass to me. 

Reason for selling is that I'm gonna make the jump to a 210mm and I hope I like it. I have generally used smaller knives but I don't see why I   wouldn't enjoy a longer blade. 

Both came from cleancut.eu 

I paid $352 for the Nakagawa from Europe including $26 shipping. 
 I'd like $350. I know it's the same but I can offer fast shipping in the US and it's literally brand new. Also, I know it's you doing me a favor with the price but I can't lose money on it being a knife I haven't even cooked with. 

I paid $147 for the petty with shipping since I ordered on separate days. 
But for this I'd take $125 shipped 

I have both original boxes for both. 
Thanks for looking!

1hgjyz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hgjyz5/criteria_for_selecting_single_boiler_or_dual/,Criteria for selecting single boiler or dual boiler? [$2500] ,"I am currently looking at purchasing my first espresso machine. I currently have a Nespresso and want to ditch the pod platform. My typical coffee day looks like some combination of 1-2 drinks ‚Äî milk-based, long pull espresso, AeroPress.

Standing in my own reality, I am looking at a Profitec Go, Rancilio Silvia Pro X and Profitec Move ‚Äî I‚Äôd love a La Marzocco Micra, but that‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs reality.

A dual boiler machine seems much more convenient and efficient. Am I over-thinking that point? Watching videos, it seems like more steps in operating a single boiler machine when using the steam wand for milk based drinks or drawing hot water. Is this accurate? Also, the single boiler machine seems to take an extra couple of minutes in making, for example, a milk based drink. Is this accurate?

Are there other considerations when thinking through single boiler vs dual boiler machines? (I‚Äòve already pulled out the tape measure and blue tape!) 

Other notes: I‚Äôm the only one in the household. When I entertain, playing barista will be an exception (maybe affogatos for dessert). I may want to make Americanos vs using the AeroPress. I want something to grow into without it feeling too basic over time. I don‚Äôt see myself becoming an over the top barista fanatic. Total budget, machine + grinder, is $2500. 

Lastly, the number of times I‚Äôve flip flopped on single boiler to dual boiler to single boiler to dual boiler is insane. ",1,1734467234.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1hgjymk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bigredtoyrobot/comments/1hgjymk/the_tear_factory/,The Tear Factory,"Inside the intricate labyrinth of Claire‚Äôs tear ducts, a factory buzzed with relentless activity. The Tear Factory‚Äîas its workers called it‚Äîwasn‚Äôt usually a high-stress operation. On a normal day, the team would process a modest amount of tears: a few during a heartfelt movie, a couple more when Claire chopped onions, and maybe a single shift‚Äôs worth on a particularly frustrating day.

But not this month. Not since December 1.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you, lads, we can‚Äôt keep up like this!‚Äù bellowed Gus, the grizzled foreman of the Tear Factory, as he wiped his brow with a cloth already soaked in saline. Gus had been on the job for decades, ever since Claire was a baby and cried nightly over lost pacifiers. He‚Äôd seen his share of heavy workloads, but this? This was a rare event.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs crying again!‚Äù shouted Mabel from her station near the lachrymal gland controls. A klaxon sounded, signaling yet another incoming wave of tears. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre running out of saline reserves, Gus! If this keeps up, we‚Äôre gonna have to dilute with eye drops!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt use eye drops here,‚Äù Gus growled. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got standards, Mabel. Just keep that gland pumping!‚Äù

The factory‚Äôs machinery groaned and sputtered as Claire‚Äôs tear ducts worked overtime. Conveyor belts carried freshly manufactured tears down toward the ducts, where they spilled out in perfect salty droplets. Each tear sparkled under the factory‚Äôs harsh fluorescent lights before being jettisoned into the world.

‚ÄúDoes she ever sleep?‚Äù muttered Frank, a junior technician tasked with monitoring tear viscosity. ‚ÄúI swear, it‚Äôs been twelve straight days. She‚Äôs got to be dehydrated by now.‚Äù

‚ÄúSleep?‚Äù Gus snorted. ‚ÄúSleep doesn‚Äôt stop heartbreak. Trust me, I‚Äôve seen it before. This one‚Äôs a doozy.‚Äù He gestured toward a massive control panel that displayed the source of the factory‚Äôs relentless workload: a glowing red alert labeled¬†**ELLIOT: DECEMBER 1 INCIDENT**.

Next to it, slightly dimmer but still ominously present, was a faded yellow alert labeled¬†**MICHAEL: 2008 COLLAPSE**. Gus tapped the panel with a sigh, his voice tinged with weary nostalgia. ‚ÄúAh, Michael. That was a real doozy too. Her college sweetheart. The one who got away‚Äîor rather, the one she left behind to chase bigger dreams.‚Äù

Mabel glanced over, her brows knitting together. ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt he supposed to be ‚Äòthe great love of her life‚Äô or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well, he was,‚Äù Gus said, leaning heavily against the console. ‚ÄúBack in ‚Äô08, we thought we‚Äôd never see the end of those tears. Double shifts, emergency saline imports, even Myrtle came out of semi-retirement to help keep things running.‚Äù

Myrtle adjusted her glasses and chimed in from the lubrication department. ‚ÄúThat breakup nearly shut us down. We had to implement a rationing system. Remember the Monday Night Sobfest? I still have nightmares about that.‚Äù

Frank‚Äôs eyes widened. ‚ÄúWait, wasn‚Äôt that the one where she cried so much during a Patty Griffin song that the ducts hit critical capacity?‚Äù

‚ÄúBingo,‚Äù Gus grumbled. ‚ÄúWe were seconds away from a full-system shutdown. If it weren‚Äôt for that emergency drainage we rigged, we‚Äôd all be out of a job.‚Äù

‚ÄúMichael,‚Äù Mabel muttered, shaking her head. ‚ÄúHe was a real piece of work, wasn‚Äôt he?‚Äù

‚ÄúEh,‚Äù Gus said, shrugging. ‚ÄúHe was fine. Smart, charismatic, good with her family‚Ä¶ but you know how it goes. She left, and we still ended up handling the fallout. Different kind of heartbreak, but heartbreak all the same.‚Äù He jabbed a finger back at the glowing red alert. ‚ÄúBut this one‚Äîthis Elliot guy‚Äîhe‚Äôs giving Michael a run for his money. We haven‚Äôt seen numbers like this since the Great Heartbreak of ‚Äô08.‚Äù

Mabel crossed her arms. ‚ÄúThink we‚Äôre looking at another decade long recovery?‚Äù

Gus groaned. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even joke about that.‚Äù

The team shuddered at the mention of his name. Elliot‚Äîthe man who‚Äôd shattered Claire‚Äôs heart and, by extension, their standard eight-hour shifts.

Over in the lubrication department, Myrtle, the oldest worker in the factory, adjusted her glasses and sighed. ‚ÄúShe used to cry for good reasons, you know. Watching those sad dog commercials. Saying goodbye to her kids on their first day of school. Now it‚Äôs all him, him, him.‚Äù

‚ÄúCut her some slack,‚Äù Mabel said, her voice softer now. ‚ÄúYou know how she is. When she feels something, she feels it deep. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

The others nodded solemnly. Despite the grumbling, they all knew the truth: their work mattered. Every tear carried something important‚Äîgrief, love, regret, hope. It was their job to make sure Claire could let it all out, even if it meant double shifts and empty coffee pots.

‚ÄúCoffee pots?‚Äù Frank grumbled under his breath. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been downing those hydration packets. If I have to squeeze one more electrolyte gel into my mug, I‚Äôm quitting.‚Äù

‚ÄúQuitting?‚Äù Gus barked, glaring at him. ‚ÄúYou think heartbreak takes PTO? We‚Äôve got a job to do!‚Äù

As the day stretched on, the machinery continued to hum, and the workers pushed through their exhaustion. Gus barked orders, Mabel tinkered with the saline injectors, and Myrtle polished the tear ducts to ensure maximum efficiency. They were a team, united by Claire‚Äôs endless sorrow and their dedication to helping her through it.

Just after lunch‚Äîwhich consisted of a communal bag of pretzels and some dubious-looking protein bars‚ÄîMabel leaned over to Gus. ‚ÄúDo you think she‚Äôs crying over something specific?‚Äù

‚ÄúSpecific?‚Äù Gus huffed. ‚ÄúHer crying has subplots, Mabel. Subplots!‚Äù He gestured toward a chart on the wall, labeled¬†**REASONS FOR TEARS (CURRENT SHIFT):**

* 47%: Elliot-related heartbreak
* 22%: Existential dread
* 18%: That sad Taylor Swift song she keeps playing
* 13%: General overthinking

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got breakdowns for the breakdowns,‚Äù Gus muttered.

Then, just as the clock ticked past midnight, the klaxon went silent. The factory stilled. Gus looked up from his clipboard, his weathered face etched with confusion.

‚ÄúIs it‚Ä¶ is it over?‚Äù Frank whispered.

The team held their breath, listening. Outside, Claire sniffled once, twice, and then‚Ä¶ nothing. The silence was deafening. Slowly, the workers began to relax, their shoulders sagging with relief.

‚ÄúAbout time,‚Äù Gus muttered. ‚ÄúGet some rest, everyone. We‚Äôve earned it.‚Äù

But just as they began powering down the machines, the klaxon blared to life again, louder than ever. Mabel‚Äôs eyes widened as a new alert flashed on the control panel:

**CLAIRE: VOICE MESSAGE REPLAYING (ELLIOT, DECEMBER 7)**

The team groaned in unison as the factory sprang back into action.

‚ÄúAlright, back to work!‚Äù Gus shouted. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got tears to make!‚Äù

Myrtle sighed, adjusting her glasses once more. ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve retired in 2009.‚Äù

And so the Tear Factory churned on, its workers tired but determined, knowing that Claire‚Äôs heart wasn‚Äôt done breaking‚Äîand their job wasn‚Äôt done either.",1,1734467211.0,u_bigredtoyrobot,0,1.0,False

I love the taboo feeling of going out in public wearing cute panties. I have only worked up the courage to go out in public while wearing panties a couple times, but every time, the risk of someone noticing is intoxicating. 

I am very much your average white guy in his early 30s. Tall, moderately athletic build (although I had quite a few beers in my 20s), and well dressed. I work a corporate job and you can generally find me at the bar watching sports on the weekends. Not the type of guy you would expect to wear women's underwear. 

I think it is the risk/thrill of embarrassment that gets me so excited. I always fantasize about some hot girl I'm flirting with noticing my panties sticking out of my jeans and laughing at me. I want to be laughed at; I want a group of hot girls to tease me about wearing women's underwear. 

I recently went to a local coffee shop to get some work done. For a little fun, I decided to wear a really embarrassing pair of panties. Pink and purple polka dot granny panties. While I was there, I had to lean over a couple times to grab something from my backpack. I knew that as I leaned over, my panties would show to anyone looking. It was so thrilling knowing I had potentially exposed my secret to strangers-- many of whom were attractive females. I managed to make eye contact with a couple of the girls nearby and swear I saw a knowing smirk on their faces.

1hgjxjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTheTraveler/comments/1hgjxjf/is_1_day_enough_in_grand_canyon/,Is 1 day enough in Grand Canyon?,"Hey fellow travelers! Just got back from an incredible Grand Canyon South Rim bus tour from Las Vegas, and I absolutely need to share this experience with you all. If you're thinking about visiting the Grand Canyon but feeling overwhelmed with all the options out there, this might be exactly what you're looking for.

I spent weeks researching different tours and finally decided on this one - honestly, it was one of the best decisions I've made. For $80, it's practically a steal considering everything that's included. The whole experience takes about 14 hours, but trust me, it flies by.

What really made this tour stand out was how hassle-free everything was. They picked me up right from my hotel in Vegas (no need to figure out transportation), and the bus was super comfortable with AC and a bathroom - crucial for that long ride! Our driver/guide was this awesome guy who kept us entertained with fascinating facts about the area's history and geology.

The South Rim views? Absolutely mindblowing. We stopped at several viewpoints, including Mather Point and Bright Angel Point. Each spot offers a completely different perspective of the canyon, and the photo opportunities are insane. The colors change throughout the day as the sun moves, creating these incredible shadows and highlights across the canyon walls.

They even included a meal voucher, which was perfect since I completely forgot to pack snacks (typical me). We also had a break in Kingman, Arizona, which was a nice chance to stretch our legs and grab some coffee.

Here's what really impressed me - they offer some pretty cool upgrades if you want to take things to the next level. You can add an IMAX movie screening (great if you want to learn more about the canyon's history), a Hummer tour along the rim (so fun!), or even a 25-minute helicopter flight over the canyon (definitely on my bucket list for next time).

For anyone interested in booking this tour (which I highly recommend), I found the best deals here: https://athometouch.com/SouthRim. The booking process was super smooth, and they're really good about confirming everything quickly.

Quick pro tips from my experience:
- Wear comfortable shoes (you'll want to explore)
- Bring a light jacket (it can get chilly at the rim)
- Don't forget your camera!
- Book in advance, especially during peak season
- Consider the helicopter upgrade if your budget allows - I heard amazing things about it

I've done quite a few tours in my life, but this Grand Canyon South Rim tour really stands out as one of the best values for money. It's perfect if you want to escape the Vegas chaos for a day and experience one of the world's most spectacular natural wonders.

1hgjwwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1hgjwwa/one_mike_to_read_them_all_the_little_coffee_shop/,One Mike to Read Them All: ‚ÄúThe Little Coffee Shop of Terrors‚Äù by Hazel Graves,"This is not a serious book. It makes very little sense. The plot is full of holes. It is entirely unrealistic.

In other words, it has a lot in common with musical theatre. And like musical theatre, it‚Äôs *tons* of fun.

Our protagonist is Adele, who is nearly resigned to giving up her dreams of ~~Broadway~~ ~~Off-Broadway~~ Off-Off-Broadway stardom when, out of nowhere, a distant relative she‚Äôs never heard of dies and leaves Adele her Brooklyn coffee shop, Riffraff. This inheritance comes with both a blazing hot Aussie barista named Ben and a terrible secret. Adele is warned by Ben never to go down to the basement, which (he tells Adele) contains the coffee roaster that is the source of the massive amounts of smoke that periodically come bellowing up. Oh, that rumbling and shaking? That‚Äôs totally the subway, don‚Äôt worry about it. Yes the 7 deadbolt locks on the basement door are necessary, it‚Äôs an OSHA thing.

So Adele is trying to learn the ropes of the coffee business from Ben and the ag√©d hippies who are the shop‚Äôs most loyal customers/friends of her late great-aunt. Meanwhile her finance bro boyfriend is trying to get her to turn Riffraff into the most Starbucksy Starbucks that ever Starbucksed - gotta get that ROI.

This book is filled to bursting with musical theatre references (my favorite being the plant growing in Riffraff named Audrey III), terrible coffee puns, and crackling sexual tension. As I said at the beginning, it‚Äôs absolutely full of plot holes, but I do not care any more than I care about where and how, exactly, all these late-19th-century New York newsboys received their classical dance training.

Settle into a comfy chair with a long black (far superior to an americano, according to Ben), turn your brain off, and enjoy this book. It‚Äôs a delight.

1hgjrhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/redflagsTA/comments/1hgjrhl/am_i_wrong_for_falling_out_of_love_with_my_husband/,am i wrong for falling out of love with my husband?,"(Throwaway acc)
People around me says that its normal for men to watch porn. The first year of our marriage, i (20) caught him(27), and tears bursted out uncontrollably. It hurts. My mom said its normal, and i should just accept it. Plus he said sorry.

The second time he got caught was in our 2nd year, our child was just born for months. I cried again, uncontrollably. 

The 3rd year, for i dont know how many times i found out, and unable to control my tears every single time.

4th year of our marriage, first few times, i cried, not as bad as before, more silently, more calmly, type of cries.

Recently, (now F23 M30), 2 times, still in 4th year, almost 5th now actually, i was calm. No feelings. Numb.

Was i wrong? Am i wrong for being too emotional?

Honestly, that was only one of the reason.

He kept saying all these years, that he hates when i cry, that woman are weak bcz of the emotions. Emotional are wrong, the correct one should be more rational.

Im a crybaby, i realized that overtime. 

But the first 3 years, i cried silently without sound, even though it was very much uncontrollably looking back now, bcz he gets this crazy bad tempered (uncontrollably too if i may add) if i ever cry.

At first, i was a naive and immature person. Believing that being scolded, criticised daily was the way he showed his 'love' to me. For me to grow up, use more brain, etc.

I listened to all the criticism. Changed myself. Hated myself for never being good enough. Idolise my husband for being such a mature person. Continue listen. Never fights. Only until later in the recent years that i starts to fight. Why?

A-Z, my whole existence is wrong.
Eating like that is wrong,
Thinking like that is stupid,
Mindset like that is worse than a child.

Even when i do the thing, that he already scolded me for, in his correct way, he gets angry forgetting the fact that im doing the way he want me to do (which when i correct him, he'll laugh at his own self for being silly)

Then when i was 21, i had enough. I questioned everything.
""Im only 21, why am i being forced to become mature like a 28 yo???""
- bcz it was for my own good, he says.

Then at 22, i became a person with full of regret.
""Why did i (mentally) had to grow so fast??!! Now i see faults and flaws everywhere!"" 
- I couldnt even look at my own husband with ""innocent/pure love"" like i used to before.

Now 23,
I dont feel anything for him.
I used to have the energy to feel hate, angry, the motivation to make the relationship recover again.

Now, i dont.
Im realizing theres nothing wrong with me being a woman CRYING. its normal.
Im realizing theres nothing wrong with my mindset. In fact, im too old already (mentally) that i cant even feel the joy like woman my age does.
Im realizing him calling me immature doesnt trigger me anymore bcz hes too man-child that i cant even take his words seriously anymore.

Now, im just..
Im too tired to fight.
Im too tired to see his face.
Im too tired to let him know anything.

He said recently,
If got anything to say. Just say. He'll listen.
He never did though. All these years.

When i tried to discuss seriously, he treated me like a child, looking at me smirking almost laughing out loud,
Saying ""ang gugugu"".

When i tried to make him listen seriously,
He'll listen 30% and get bad tempered again.

Bad temper led to:
1. My only treasure : 4-5 storage box of makeup being thrown from up to down stairs.
2. Doors being kicked down.
3. Me chased away from my own house.
4. Violently fought.
5. Threatened to swing(beat) using heavy metal high chair.
Etc. Dont feel like continuing the list.

Not limited to me.
Even my child get that no 3.
he wants full custody, but he cant take care more than 30 min otherwise bad temper come again.

Just early this year, i demand for a ""sit and discuss "" bcz after years of ZERO social interactions, i found out that adults do have something they called sit and dicuss, 

where if people listen open mindedly to each other and find a common ground, try to compromise and all, especially MARRIAGE adults. 

He dont want. He rejects despite my attempts in trying to convince him for it.

Why is ""having a discussion "" so hard?
Previous years i ask him also dont want, 2 months ago i tried asking again also get rejected.

I even tried marriage counselling.
I went for more than 10 times.

Only 2 times he came with. He said no point going bcz it makes him feel attacked while im being justified.

At one point, i stopped going bcz he accused me of having an affair with a nonexistent person (his imaginary guy) and he changed house lock so i drive 5hours distance to my parents house at night time. 

Look, all my passwords are 1111 or our anniversary date. 
Open. Check. Go on. Why not? Its cuz i dont have any.
Im not that OBSSESSED with sexual stuff also, how to have affair? In fact im even more tired bcz i need to cook need to care for a man-child and a child etc.

And i have NEVER had a ME time. All these years.
I need me time more than i need an affair. 

I have tried changing myself. Never enough. Theres always something.

I even impulsively cut myself. Impulsively. We were quarrelling. I was already too depressed and kept having suicidal thought nonstop.

His first reaction was, more angry, more cursing, more judgement, like:
""Stupid"" ""crazy"" etc.

I was waiting for a single word of care.
I was starting to feel dizzy.
I actually ended up lying down bcz i was too tired from the blood loss.
He got more bad tempered.

I tried.

Every time.

My ""mistakes"" exists in his eyes every minutes,
Every word that i say, to every thoughts that he assume i have, to every micro action that i do.

""U dont respect me"" i did.
""Ur like a child"" ive changed.
""U dont use enough brain""
""U have brain problem""
""U always think about yourself""
""U should forgive me cuz human makes mistakes""

- ive put myself to the side for years,
Thinking only about my husband and child.

Now.
I want a divorce so bad.
Why doesnt he?

Ive fallen out of love.
But he wants me to give him one more chance.

I gave him chances, all these years.
Now that ive fallen out of love, what chances can i give when i already have none in my heart?

Am i really too emotional?
Am i selfish?

""But you have a child""
I know,

And i also know this is a very short and biased summary of my marriage life, but i still want to know so im asking.

Am i wrong?

******Additional edit (coppied from comment) bcz i thought might need to add for more understanding.


‚¨áÔ∏è


Im in dilemma actually. Like everyone around me discourage my decision to divorce.

""Your child needs a father figure.""
""You need to be more forgiving.""
""Hes ur husband so u need to be understanding""
""He promises u hes changing""

Then bad luck kept coming.
Car accident. Full mug of coffee spilled in car. Delayed work.

Honestly, the masturbation doesnt really bother me. What bothers me is the fact that he would download / watch hundreds of naked woman doing his imaginary stuff, (gets violent or defensive or argumentative if i ever gave even a bad face(emotion) for it)

But he would be jealous and forbid me from even be in contact with anyone assuming they might be a guy.

Heck, 1st year he thought i have smtg with my father. My OWN father.
2nd year he has issues with my little brother. Blood related brother.

4th year i finally brave myself to socialize with people other than my husband and my child, so i contact my sister in law.

He got severely jealous thinking i have smtg with my big brother. 

(Cousin but his mom who is my mom's elder sister died when he was 11, no father, so he was adopted by my mom at a very young age, that i look at him no different than i look at my own father and younger brother)

They have 2 child already btw, first one same age as ours. But still though, my brother and my sister in law both 29. One year younger than my husband but were married probably since they were 22 or smtg, im guessing, but even they never had our kind of marriage problems before.

But, like EVERYONE ard me said,

Hes CHANGING.

And im a divorcee. Who would want a divorcee with a child?
Even if someone who does, will i EVER even have the energy and time? when i have a child who i need to solely focus on and really dont want them to be affected by adults matters

In 5 years, where will we be? Will my child grow up well?
10 years, if i ever found a partner, how will my child feels?
Abandoned? Lonely? Unable to express bcz afraid to not let mom happy? But also feeling left behind bcz everyone seems to have a new family?

Idk. I really. Dont. Know.
I love my child. Never regretted having them.
But im literally. Unable to make a decision that will not affect them.",3,1734466686.0,redflagsTA,5,1.0,False

Last night was a shit show at work that coincided with insane family drama and news. It was rough. I don't have a girlfriend or close family or anyone outside of work to show comfort or just get a damn hug from. Shit was real rough last night. 

When I left work, I could feel my mind and body making excuses and giving in. I went to the gas station for some caffeine but knew what I really wanted there. I've been making great progress in my life with my productivity, mental and physical health, and plans and motivation to improve my life since I quit. I was ready to throw it away it felt like. I stood right in front of the beer wall, with my face a foot away from my favorite beer. I literally stood there for 30 seconds, I could feel my body start to give a rush like I had already taken the first sip I felt lightweight with excitement in a way from the adrenaline. 

After a while of standing there I mumbled to myself, ""not today Satan"" and grabbed a Pepsi. I played the tape forward and knew that's a part of my life I never wanna return to. 

Went home, played some games online with some coworkers, passed out still kinda stressed. Woke up this morning ony day off, took a shower, made some coffee, rolled up a joint, did my errands and made steady progress all morning and afternoon on things I'm excited to improve in my life, listening to my favorite music all the while and feeling generally really proud of myself and good about where I'm headed in life. 

Just wanna share this with y'all but honestly mostly for me so I can come back and remember this feeling next time my day hits a terrible low. Love you guys üíú IWNDWYT",7,1734466250.0,stopdrinking,2,0.9,False
