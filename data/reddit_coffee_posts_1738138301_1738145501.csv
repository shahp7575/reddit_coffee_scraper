Cal sighed in annoyance as the chorus of mockery from behind them grew ever louder. ""Okay... So... Get in. Find a spot. Or something."" Cal said, moving aside and gesturing for the four terrified women to get on board.



""B-but we-""



""I SAID GET IN."" Caliban commanded with far more authority than he needed. His outburst even silenced the dragons.



The women suddenly made a mad scramble to get in the back, nearly climbing over each other to secure a seat among the dragons. Each girl sat in the best open seat, unfortunately sandwiched between the juvenile beasts. Each girl feeling more and more uncomfortable as the beasts regarded them closely. The roar of the machines heart echoed through the valley, the machine moving in earnest with an angered rumble.



""Could've been in an eternal war in heaven but no, I'm here. Could've been reincarnated as a pastry chef, but no, I'm here. Could've just stayed the HELL home and LEARNED HOW TO PAY TAXES. BUT NO. IM HERE. What did I do to deserve this?!"" Caliban said, his voice mildly muffled but still audible from inside the machines body.



The mechanical beast trundled along for a few minutes before entering a clearing near a sheer cliff. ""ALRIGHT YOU CRAZY TURKEYS! HERES YOUR DROPOFF, NOW SCRAM!"" Caliban yelled.



The dragons all dismounted and stood at the edge of the cliff, each one attempting to coax each other off the sheer drop into the treeline below. They ranted and raved at each other for a time before Caliban hit something inside the cabin, a loud, obnoxious noise that reverberated through the valley suddenly burst from the machines front end, sending all six dragons suddenly scrambling off the cliffs edge. All of them made it, flapping their wings furiously to stop themselves from slamming into the rock below to a chorus of Caliban's mocking laughter.



The girls all were amazed at the sight but quickly huddled up together in the seats closest to the front as Caliban took them back towards the mountain pass. The girls looked terrified, but were unable to escape owing to how fast the machine was moving and cowered together in the back. The machine quickly made its way through the huge gates, down a mountain pass and towards the massive structures at the craters centre. Caliban parked in a specific place and got out of the machine.



""GET OUT!"" He commanded.



All four girls scrambled out of the back onto the floor and marvelled in fear and awe at the size of the buildings around them.



""Right. THAT..."" Caliban pointed at the cathedral like structure. ""Is my house. Go in, I'll make us some tea. Or coffee. Or something."" Caliban then pointed to the massive structure nearby. ""THAT, is my War Factory. Don't go in there, without me. That place has machines that WILL remove limbs and turn you into soupy goo if you aren't careful. Got that?""



The four of them nodded nervously and wandered in the smaller building. They were taken aback by its interior as much as its exterior. Complete opposites. On the outside, a precision carved, carefully managed edifice of stone and mortar made to fit precisely in a beautiful pattern of fervour and faith. On the inside, a dishevelled mess of machine parts, loose components, scrap metal, and the perfect match for what can be described as 'before wife'. It was neat enough they could move about and find a comfy spot, clean enough their feet did not squelch underfoot. But still, the four could clearly see, this was a quintessential Man Cave.



""Huh... It seems even across worlds... Men are all pretty much alike. This looks like my older brothers study."" Jenassi said idly.



""Across worlds? Pray tell fair friend, what mean thou by this?"" Marie asked as she sat on a chair. A strangely comfortable chair that made her coo like a dove as she sank into it.



""Oh come on Marie! The... machines with wheels the, huge steel building that makes machines! There's no way he's from around here! He even said so himself he had no idea what Elves or Demi-Men were! He must have been Summoned... But by whom?"" Serenia said with a sigh.



""The Gods often create heroes from thin air in response to a major cataclysm. Is he a Summoned One? He must be..."" Amari said.



""Impossible. Besides the Smog Dragons, who have ALWAYS been a threat, even to the Red Dragons, have always been under control. Reasonably speaking. Gnobbins, Gargoyles, that type haven't been that much of a challenge for the local Guardsmen or even the Adventurers Guild. Why even is he here? And more importantly... Why summon his entire house?"" Serenia replied with a sigh.



""I heard naught on the vine pertaining to aught of concern I fear. Perhaps the Gods have erred or acted in jest?"" Marie said, her voice strangely calm as she sank into her comfy chair.



""Or maybe this guy is here because there's something in the future were going to need him for. And because of the complexity of his machinery, he needs time to prepare."" Jenassi said.



""Uh oh..."" The other three replied in turn.



The door opened and in walked the subject of their conversation, shirtless, carrying a collection of brightly coloured cylinders in some strange packet. ""Ugh... Cant be bothered to boil the kettle. So here. Have some sodas."" He said and casually handed each girl one of the objects.



They were cylindrical with strange markings, tops with odd openings and a red coloration. ""What... is this?"" Jenassi asked.



""Observe."" Caliban said.



He flipped the odd cap on the top of it, a strange whoosh sound coming from the object. Caliban then chugged it down and emptied it, crushing the cylinder flat on his forehead, then tossing it in a nearby basket. ""OOHHH god that tatses good... GOD I'm SO glad I spent money on those licenses!""



Cal then sat there expectantly and waited for them. The four girls carefully considered each other. ""Uhm... why do you have no shirt?"" Marie asked.



""Invited guests get the courtesy of a dressed host and a clean home, you are uninvited and unexpected. Therefore you get the sweaty muscle of a man after a hard day of work, and a can of soda."" He glared at them with an angry spark n his eyes.



The girls all swapped glances, popped the strange tops and swallowed nervously at the odd liquid bubbling around inside it. They all tentatively took a sip of it. Marie broke her usual stoic resolve and squealed in delight before chugging the contents of the can down before belching loudly and shamelessly, much to her friends shock. The other three tentatively sipped their own drinks. Jenassi didn't like it much, the bubbling too much but she drank it due to the sugary taste. Amari licked at it like a curious puppy and then slurped it down, trying to shove her tongue in the can to try slurp up every last drop. Serenia gently tasted it, shrugged and drank it like a lady sipping tea. She did not expect the loud belch at the end, and blushed as she held her hands over her mouth.



""Mixed response. Figured as much, not every one likes Coca Cola. But I do have other flavours and other drinks, including milkshakes and fruit juice. But that's for guests. Maybe next time. So... You have questions. Ask them."" Cal said with a smirk.



""So... Are you a human?"" Amari asked gently.



""Last I checked yeah. Have a few mods but nothing serious. To answer your question, MODS means these."" Cal said, and a long blade suddenly appeared out of his right forearm. It was razor sharp, shining a blue/green and looked as vicious as can be appearing more like a fang of a snake. Caliban quickly retracted it, then sat with a smile. ""Cybernetics. Mechanical augmentation. in short - I chop off arm, put machine in place. Now I have machine arm.""



The four girls looked terrified, shocked and genuinely distressed at the sight. He simply sat there and waited for more questions. Eventually Serenia gingerly raised a hand. ""Uhm... Wh-what are those... machines?""



""Hm... How to explain... Do your people have steam engines, or devices that use heat from boiling water to move machinery?"" Cal asked.



""Uhh… y-yes actually."" Jenassi replied.



""That makes my job easier. That thing is called a 'Truck'. It uses basically the same principle as a steam engine does. Converting the heat energy of burning coal or wood to heat water, then using the steam to turn a mechanism, to convert that energy into motion. That machine uses much the same principle, only a LOT more efficient and a LOT faster. Your fuel is steam and wood. My system just cuts out a few steps of middle-man and makes it a LOT more powerful, as you saw."" Cal replied.



The girls sat in silence for a few seconds and considered his words. Jenassi said ""OOoohhhh…"" As she understood what he was talking about. Her less mechanically inclined friends didn't quite get it and just sat there with scrunched expressions trying to understand.



""I'll give you a good explanation later. Maybe. If you behave nicely. Now, my turn. Catgirls, Wolfgirls, Elf, human. What else is there? Is this the four races or is there more?"" Cal asked.



""Uhm... Catkin, Wolfkin, Foxkin, Dragonkin, Human, Elven, there's also Dryads, Faekin, Satyrs, Deerkin, Demonkind and Divinekind. You already know the Dragonkin. They were the... What did you call them... 'fratboys'? Serenia replied.



""Well that's a full roster right there. God... Half the people I know would've sold their souls to the lowest bidder to be where I am today. Guess it aint all bad. Alright, your turn."" Cal replied.



""I've never seen a man like you... Ever. You know... especially not with the whole... Machine arm thing. What are... you?"" Marie asked.



""Mixed. As mixed as it gets. Caucasian, Native American, Latina, and African American. Specifically... Texas, Sioux, Mexico, Ghana. I'm a mix of all four. In my old world, that combination is as rare as a politician who speaks the truth. And that's saying a lot right there. Short answer - I'm just a human, I just have an interesting lineage. But anyway. My turn. Magic. Is it a thing here?"" Cal asked.



""Yes."" All four girls replied, then each raised a hand to conjure a simple spell. Marie made a ball of snow, Jenassi a ball of fire, Serenia a ball of electricity and Amari a ball of swirling leaves.



""Cool. Didn't have magic in my world. Only machinery. Which in its own right considering what we did was its own magic."" Cal said and stood up to the nearby closet.



""What did you do with your machines exactly?"" Amari asked.



""Communicated with millions of people all at once as if face to face across any distance via the Internet, instantly. Used machinery to haul millions of tons of cargo - per day - across tens of thousands of miles via trains, trucks, ship and planes. Defied gravity by flying with aircraft such as helicopters, fixed wing aircraft, gliders. Perfected the art of chemistry to make cures for thousands of horrible diseases. Used machines to put human footprints on the moon. Then on another planet. then eventually breaking the bods of the Cradle and establishing new roots around new worlds far from home. That kind of stuff."" Cal explained as he redressed himself, putting on some kind of odd uniform.



The four sat open mouthed at the explanation and Caliban simply carried on as normal. He stepped away from his closet, wearing a full uniform of some kind, and carrying a very nasty looking piece of equipment on his shoulder. ""What... the hell are you wearing?"" Jenassi asked.



""Combat Armor, standard issue. Battle Dress uniform or BDU unders, with a plate carrier, cargo pants, carryall backpack, mag pouches, packs, all coloured a nice gentle blue and my baby Jessica... My gun. Love this gun. Made it myself. By hand!"" Cal said, proudly brandishing the oddly blue coloured metal machine.



""What... pray tell is that menacing machine? It... scares me."" Marie said as she looked at it.



""This? The AK-DMR Platform custom made rifle, Four-Oh-Eight Calibre, sixty rounds, Midnight blue with a stub grip, bipod and stock. My Jessica. Pretty aint she? Yeah she is! But to answer your question a 'gun' is an 'Advanced Freedom Delivery Mechanism'. In your terms id say its a... Like a very powerful fireball spell. Only smaller, lethal-er and... significantly harder to dodge. And sexier."" Cal said with a chuckle. ""That grey/blue dragon dude I shot earlier sure as hell figured that part out! hehehe!""



The girls faces all went white with horror as they suddenly knew who took the Smog Dragon down. One of the deadliest and hardest to fight beasts in the whole world was killed by that machine, and this random guy who seemed a bit too casual about it.



""Of course, that was just .408 Cheytac. I... genuinely wonder what damage I could've done with a bigger shell. Probably would've blown it in half. Meh. Anyway. Come on ladies, you have outstayed your welcome. Lets get you home before dark."" Cal said and gestured for them all to leave.



Each girl was scared out of her mind but eventually left their seats. The full blown silent panic hit them however when their ride - a full grown Crimson Elder Dragon stood in front of them. He was twice the size of Caliban's small house. Covered in nearly blood red mithril touch scales with his massive wings gently floating with the wind. His huge head and horns appeared polished and freshy cleaned as if he had just had a bath. The beast visibly smirked at them and lay on the ground, putting a leg to the side and offering it as a ramp to get on his back.



Caliban didn't give them a chance to do much else as he impatiently hurried them aboard and made sure they wore seatbelts. Each girl shared glances of shock, awe and terror at the sight of them being strapped into a saddle, atop an Elder Red Dragon. Caliban didn't go with them, he climbed down.



""You sure you're okay to fly them home Aterius? I can understand if you change your mind!"" Cal said.



""I am happy to be of help... In exchange for an extra serving of that tasty cake thing you make. We do not work for free after all!"" The dragons voice grumbled in response.



""That's the spirit! I'm going to try bear hunting today. Little gamey but hey, I know how to prepare a good bear stew. See you for dinner!"" Caliban said with a smile and grabbed a smaller 'truck' from the parked machinery nearby. A smaller dragon, a youngling presumably hopped in the machine with him and the two drove off into the forest.



The girls al squealed in terror as the enormous leathery wings flapped up, forcing them off the ground in one fluid motion. For the first time in history each girl saw her home world from the skies.

1icqfg3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1icqfg3,Nicole 'working' at Starbucks,"I know someone posted about this already but this is so hilariously sad to see wealthy people literally cosplay people who rely on their actual jobs making minimum wage. 

Also the last slide is actually depressing when you realize Nicole absolutely does not advocate for causes in general if ever lately.. Like why is she pretending to care what causes Starbucks supports when she herself barely supports any causes nor does she talk about them. Maybe it's nitpicky but it's just sad to not see influencers use their platforms for good.

This is one of the most out of touch things Nicole has done to be honest. It's crazy cause she could've spun this in the way that made her realize how working an actual job feels like etc. but of course they didn't think of it. 

Someone commented on the previous post how they wish some influencers wouldn't make so much money online so they'd have to take actual jobs and I totally agree. Nicole will never need to take a part time job during college to make some extra money on the side etc. And while I know YouTube is her job, it's making her grow increasingly out of touch and honestly it feels like Nicole is losing empathy by the day. She's not even a normal teenage girl anymore, she's truly a wealthy person who's not on the same side as her viewers. She's becoming like those rich people who have no empathy for non-rich folks.

My main symptoms were non stop burping (empty stomach, full stomach, any day any time). Was feeling like gas was stuck in the back and in the throat.
Several sharp chest pain that would occur on a daily basis, and would constantly move, sometimes from the left side to the right side, sometimes the other way, sometimes in the centre of my chest where the sternum is.
And most importantly HEART PALPITATIONS. This thing scared the **** out of me when it started happening first. Tried to change my daily habits, eat healthier, drink healthier, still nothing changed about this one (mind you I never smoked or drank coffee or alcohol). I did all of the possible heart examinations and the result would always be a perfectly healthy heart.

There was also sometimes sudden pain in my arms, ribs, feet, neck, shoulder, headaches…

7 days ago GERD was finally confirmed and i was put on a pantoprazole.
I have noticed that chest pain became less frequent and painful since then.
But heart palpitations still remained the same, happening at random moments, approximately 5-6 times a day.
Same goes with burping, still the same.

Does anyone have any advice on how I can finally manage palpitations and burping?

Doctor told me to take 20mg pantoprazole , 2 times a day, for 15 days, so maybe I still haven’t gotten to the full effect of it, could that be an issue?

1icq9wv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1icq9wv/i_23f_trust_my_partner_24nb_and_love_my_found/,I (23F) trust my partner (24NB) and love my found sister (21F) but feel sidelined by her when my partner is around.,"Me (23F) and my partner (24NB) have been in a relationship for nearly 2 years now. This is by far the best relationship I've been in and the growth I experienced is exponential since meeting them. I am also polyamorous, meaning that for me love isn't defined by them ONLY being attracted to me and I completely understand and appreciate that people find them attractive and flirt with them. (Ofcourse they do, I do too so I get it.) However we are in a monogamous relationship until any feelings occur for third parties. 

This whole time in our relationship I have always felt very loved and appreciated and they still look at me like it is their first time seeing the night sky. (a never-ending honeymoon phase if you will)

Well, recently I have felt a feeling I cannot describe but the closest I could relate it to was jealousy and I feel it towards someone I consider to be my found sister (21F). 

For context, I am very secure in my relationship and while I am poly, my partner is mono and this dynamic works great because they communicate very very well and no bad emotions have ever escalated to a point that we couldn't talk and communicate about it calmly and gently. They love and adore me and I am lucky to have such a mutual growth relationship.

So this feeling completely caught me by surprise. Initially I felt a little left out and dusted it off as me being slightly fearful of not being included in fun things and group settings but I noticed that the only person who really triggered that feeling was my found sister and my intuition keeps telling me that something is up but that she isn't telling me about it even though she knows about my feelings towards love and how I see it (I won't ever get upset or mad if someone were to tell me that they find my partner attractive but my only thing is that it must be communicated openly to both of us.) I started to feel uncomfortable a couple months back when I was out of the country for a month and my bestfriend invited our group (which has my sister, partner and others) over to watch movies and play games. 

This feeling was initially because of the high occurence at which she started showing up to group settings upon being invited by my bestie AFTER knowing that my partner would be there. She once out of the blue (also in a group setting where I was in) told them that their eyes were ""very intense"" and felt like they ""stared into your soul"" and immediately glanced at me after and did an almost jokingly awkward laugh while going pink. 

Other instances include: 
her always getting ready to come over to mine when I just invite her over for a coffee or to body double so I can clean (makeup & clothes that are more suited for actually stepping out of the house than inside) and delaying it till my partner is almost home from work; always being extra friendly and putting on a baby voice and because she's shorter than most of us, really driving that part in and being all ""cutesy"" (not a judgement on the behaviour itself but moreso the change in behaviour). Also asking them excitedly every time if they're joining the party that might be occuring or when I say I am the only one going there; getting a bit sad (less excited??)  to know that I am the only one coming (knowing that even if invited, they actually have a preference 99% of the time to stay home and away from all the loud noises and large groups of people). Engaging in conversation with them when I leave the room and the room going quiet again when I enter and sit down. 

I have already communicated that I feel a bit used or as a stepping stone to my partner who didn't actually realize that this may be flirting and hadn't noticed/ done anything from their side but be platonic and friendly. I can confirm this because when I told them I was poly the first time, they said that they would absolutely communicate if feelings for others came up (I would treat it as a lil gossip sesh and ask them over a glass of wine about it cuz heck yeah, go get em!!) but they're unlikely to because they reassured me (with no prompt) that they love only me and for them love and comfort only build over time when they get to know me more. 

I feel very torn because I love my sister. She's one of the most beautifully creative and dynamic souls I've ever met. Our enthusiasm together has no bounds and we are often very random and ""weird"" but funny in public around each other. It feels like a yawn; it's so contagious and I am so happy that she is in my life because while she is younger, she keeps making me think of new things and expand my horizon. I deliberated that feeling for a very long time and the only conclusion I could come to was that she wants to spend more time with them and her way of doing so is through me. I am secure in how I am and how I look as well so it cannot be that but my intuition keeps going off and a lot of things align in a way where I feel sidelined in a relation where I really value her and our bond.

I spoke to her about it and mentioned how I really dislike being left out and feel fearful that my friends and my partner end up creating a social space where all the attention goes to my partner (They do not want it and withdraw a bit if given too much but they're cursed with being extremely attractive and really smart so absolutely no one leaves them alone, INCLUDING men and women of all ages. The oldest I saw was a 65 year old lady but she was very cute about it). 

I am a little lost because I do not want this feeling to simmer if there is actually no basis to it but my pattern recognition (intuition) is almost always very on the dot. 

Again the only thing I hate is being left out WITHOUT communication when I feel like I've clocked something that isn't being said clearly to me out loud and making me feel a bit guilty and insane but communicating that did not make the feeling go away nor did it offer an explanation. The most I got was her thinking I want to have alone time with ""MY"" friends (partner joined my existing group but is very much a part of it now) and that she will make an effort to have individual friendships with both of us by saying ""okay so I should be friends with both of you but keep those relations individual to each of you.""

I really value having both of them in my life and they enrich it greatly so there is not any specific conversation with her that I can coin to that weird feeling either. 

I am lost on what that weird alarm bell feeling is and how I can communicate it in a way where I can get across that I just like being told things instead of having to guess them from pattern recognition and past experiences because I can do it but it hinders my ability to build stronger more trusting relationships.

How do I make sure I am communicating without misunderstanding?

I can clarify further in the comments on any specific questions!

TL;DR : I (23F/poly) feel left out by my found sister (20F) concerning her behaviour towards my very attractive partner (24NB)  and wondering there is misunderstanding because of a lack of communication because liking someone I like occurs to me as normal because they're likeable and I would just like open communication.",1,1738143989.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

Pete the Puggle bounded into the living room, his short white fur gleaming in the sunlight. His big, underlined

eyes sparkled with mischief as he held a crumpled piece of paper in his mouth, wagging his tail excitedly.



""Dad! Mom! Roman! Look what I found!"" Pete dropped the paper on the coffee table, flipping it over to reveal a map

with X marks and a drawing of a golden bone.



Lenny, Mariya, and Roman gathered around, curious. ""What's this?"" Lenny asked, picking up the map. ""A treasure

map? And... a bone?""



Pete tilted his head, looking innocent. ""I think it's for us to find something super cool! We can go on an

adventure!""



Mariya laughed, smoothing Pete's fur. ""You always have such big ideas, buddy. But this time, we'll need to figure

out where it leads.""



Roman, older but still playful, grinned. ""Let's explore together!""



And so they set off on a journey. As they ventured into the woods, they faced various challenges—a muddy path, a

bridge that needed fixing, and riddles from the map that only Pete could solve with his clever mind.



When they finally reached their destination, they discovered a hidden garden where the golden bone waited. But it

wasn't just a bone; it was a magicalBone that glowed softly, symbolizing their strong bond.



The family celebrated their victory, laughing and snuggling together under the starry sky. They realized that the

greatest treasure they had found was not just the Bone, but the time spent together, exploring and learning.



As they returned home, Pete looked up at his family with pride. ""We did it! We found the treasure!"" he barked

joyfully.



Lenny ruffled Pete's fur affectionately. ""The best treasure is the one we've had together—our adventures and

love.""



Pete wagged his tail, grinning from ear to ear. Together, they knew that every new day was an opportunity for

another exciting tale.



And so, their story continued, filled with laughter, snuggles, and endless possibilities.

I also have an issue with swollen and painful legs that gets worse throughout the day. Acne type cysts and other typical symptoms. Low energy is also a huge factor and exhaustion for days after a workout. 

I just don't see the point anymore but have ED and body image issues and find it hard to leave the house because I feel so ugly and gross. I also can't stand cothes touching my stomach as I have a large overhang of skin from c-secs and it is tender and swells up during ovulation. 

Stats as follows:

Age 42

Weight gain: 10kg (22lbs) over 2 years. Seema to be accelerating. 

Excercise: Weights, yoga, walking (high resistance & weighted). 2 x weights, 1x yoga, 1 x cardio - 1 hour each day.

For context two years he went to china for work reasons and I later discovered that he had a happy ending massage. We almost divorced, however we have two children who are 4 and 5 years old. And it was the first time he had ever done something like that to me before. He had never been a womaniser, we have been together for 12 years and I never ever had an issue with him previously. So I forgave him.
Moving on, my husbands cousins wife (35f) who is also my husbands accountant are quite close friends. At the end of the last year I noticed they had a 20 day snap chat streak and my husband opened the most recent and it was just a pic of her coffee so I let it go. He said it was just pics of their day. My husband decided to delete snap chat and limited communication with her but I always found their relationship a little bit too close for my liking. 
Fast forward to two weeks ago, we went on a family trip to Bali with said cousin and his wife and everything was fine, however when we came back I went through his phone and found messages between them.
They met up 4 days at the hotel gym in the morning, privately at 5am without telling me or her husband that they were purposefully meeting up their and without getting in to details the messages were very flirtatious. He complimented her body, confided in her about work problems and just had lots of intimate conversations that allude to something more than friendship.
I don't know what to do. Should I leave? Is that enough to break up our family? He is the most amazing father and helps so much with the kids and is otherwise a great husband but I am just so disgusted by the lies and deceit.

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl (cue the song ) . I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am . Some one to text and share stupid stuff with on the daily .So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you’re able to hold a conversation let’s be friends ;) 

First abit about me : I’m writing this while drinking tea and having a smoke I’m watching a Dutch streamer play phasmophobia .sometimes I’m funny but don’t ask me to tell a joke ( that’s not how it works bro ) fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream( no I don’t have reasons why I just don’t , it’s not that deep ). I have adhd and because of that I have a new hobby or interest each week . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and adding them to my iPod for optimal vibes  and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special . 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

- Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning )
- a lot of random playlist I’ve made 
- complaints about nonsensical things
- someone that you can annoy at any time of  the day 
- someone to have coffee dates with virtually 
- just someone willing to listen to your rambles /ideas/thoughts/feelings 

**disclaimer**

**DONT JUST SEND ME HI /HELLO/HEY/HOW ARE YOU ? If you do this I probably won’t answer so please send me a none boring intro (not just listing your hobbies pretty please )**

I've been upping the Erythritol usage, from starting out with around 5 grams per pint, to around 25 grams now. I still think the ice is lacking of some sweetness. Maybe it's just the Erythritol itself.

# Part 1: [What are you?](https://tenor.com/view/idiot-sandwich-gordon-ramsay-what-are-you-gif-5280412) An Autoregressive Language Model

ChatGPT, as well as all of the other modern chatbots out there, are all **Autoregressive Language Models**. Understanding those words means knowing what these AIs do. 

First, what is a **Language Model**? Basically, it's a computer program that can solve the following task: Given text as input, predict what text comes next. An easy example of a language modeling task is autocomplete! Every time you start typing ""Brandon has glizzy ..."" and your phone automatically finishes the sentence with the word ""hands"", a language model has done its job. 

The language model described above takes text (a part of a sentence) as input and outputs a single word (that finishes / continues the sentence). What if I want a language model that can output full sentences, what would that look like? Well, it turns out that the model we described is perfectly capable of creating full sentences. All you would need to do is, once the model has generated a word, put that word in the input and run the model again! For example, if the input is ""I can't put"" and the model outputs ""down"", we can *put ""down""* into the input and run the model on that. Now the new input is  ""I can't put down"" and the model outputs ""the"". You can see where this is [going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ssj5ZBuhwIo).

A language model that can only output one word at a time, but generates whole sequences of words by iteratively adding its output into its input is **Autoregressive**. ""Auto"" as in ""automatic"" and ""regressive"" as in ""regression"". So just like the Coffee Cow *regresses* back to the start of Get to Work over and over again in a loop because he is **bad at the game**, a language model that is autoregressive loops over and over to turn itself from a word generator to a ""any length of text"" generator.  

And that's it! That's how all modern chatbots work, they generate text by running the same program over and over again, outputting one word at a time. This information may seem too bare bones to be relevant but this baseline knowledge will become very relevant later. That being said, this by itself already sheds a lot of light into the behavior of these chatbots imo, especially when it comes to reasoning. Imagine how hard it would be to do a logic puzzle or write any text that requires planning if you could **only think one word at a time** and were not allowed to edit what you already wrote. That's what these chatbots do!

#### Recipient's Preferences

Think about the person you're buying for. Are they a fan of a particular store? Do they prefer experiences over physical items? Knowing their likes can guide you in choosing the right type and amount of gift card. A thoughtful approach can lead to selecting a more personalized amount, whether that's $25 for a coffee shop or $100 for a larger retail store.

#### Occasion

Red flag?,"I'm supposed to meet a guy on Bumble this weekend. His profile didn't say what kind of relationship he is looking for, and when I asked him, he said this:

**I mean I think it would be great to meet someone I’d want to start a relationship with. I’ve just met some people through the app that I’ve become friends with and people who are here like semi short term for like a year or whatever and they’ve wanted something different: like more than casual, less than serious. So I just kind of meet people I think might be interesting and see how it goes. 🤷🏼‍♂️**

For me, I am only looking for a committed relationship and am afraid of getting hurt by someone who would be careless with my feelings. I am a little afraid of dating someone with this kind of attitude because I feel like if you aren't seeking commitment, it will never happen. It's like you're just waiting for the right person to come along and convince you, so I'd feel like I have to earn his commitment in a way.

Should I still go on the date? Or should I avoid guys like this?

EDIT: He added more:

**So yeah, while finding a long term relationship is the ideal outcome, I’m sure you understand that socializing in [country] for expats not always easy and so I guess I didn’t pick anything to keep the door cracked open to allow for friendships and so on that might otherwise not be possible when you’re explicit or too set on your expectations. Does that make sense?**

EDIT 2: I responded with this:

**Okay, that makes sense. Just to be clear, I am dating with the intention of finding a long-term partner. Obviously, it has to evolve naturally, and I wouldn’t rush into anything, but if there’s anything more than friendship, I’d be hoping it leads to a serious relationship.**

And he said:

**Noted. I appreciate you sharing your expectations clearly. I wasn’t going into this looking for or expecting something casual either. Let’s just have some hipster coffee and see how it goes!**",2,1738141962.0,aspergirls,2,1.0,False

Around 17/18 I got another partner whom I depended on and throughout our relationship, she continuously cheated for about 70% of it, I kept taking her back because yanno, depression.

I broke up with her when she slept with someone and surprisingly I genuinely improved my life in health (both physical and mental) and began to enjoy life.

I started routinely exercising and went from being overweight to in great shape, I lost all of my IRL friends due to some pretty disgusting shit (I pretty much had to threaten them all with the police due to vile shit they were doing), yet I remained in great shape and happy overall.

As time passed I ended up meeting my next partner online in 2019, an American. Long story short I ended up dating her for 3 years and flew over to meet her, the time I was there are some of the happiest memories I have. A few months after I'd been back we were discussing engagement and originally she planned to move here. She met a guy at work who liked her, she hated work and had no friends there. I decided to trust her to just be friends with the guy as I do believe in trusting your partner, a few weeks later she was essentially lying about where she was going and I found out she was out with him one night when texting her sister to ask if she was okay.

Since then I've remained single and gradually begun to find most women to just not be anything I want to deal with. Nearly every single girl I've met in the last few years has been physically unattractive to me, shared none of my hobbies, or had specific major no's (e.g. smoker) for me. All except my closest friend (online).



What this leads to is essentially I've been giving my friend (who doesn't know I'm unemployed) what money I'm able to help with her bills as she scrapes by. 

I've contemplated working but every time I do I'm just met with my perception that none of it is ""worth my time"", I currently get around £14-18k per year if I calculate correctly, for me to start working I'd only meet the standards of entry-level work, from that I'm basically earning £18-22k per year, now add on I'd likely need to learn to drive and get a car which takes some of my income off of my pay. 

I really do not enjoy talking to the people of the UK overall, I get bored easily. I'm able to talk to people, but I kinda ""facade it up"" and treat the people here as NPC's and it works... They feel engaged and I genuinely listen to what they have to say, yet I feel so bored and uninterested because it's the same old shit I've never been into - ""FOOTBALL, THE WEATHER, TEA/COFFEE, (OTHER SPORTS), PUB"". 

My main interests are games and anime, this is where I genuinely feel I'd enjoy life in America far more. Over there I had spoken with dozens of strangers, yet in my 26 years of life in the UK I've only had strangers approach me to ask ""You got a lighter?""...

Even online any Brits I meet who like games or anime are at the most basic level and they say they're happy staying at that level, it's not their interest. (E.g. they play 1 game every now and then and maybe they saw a Ghibli movie or 2) 

Yet with Americans, it's the opposite, over 50% of the people I meet have watched over a dozen anime, can talk enthusiastically about them, play at least 5 games semi-regularly and enjoy each other's company.

I haven't been attracted to a British woman for about 7 years... 

All of this leads back to work, I have no way to get into the US (specifically Texas, I've generally enjoyed talking to people there the most and have been there, it's much better than the UK) other than marriage, which with my ex was feasible but as I age dating long distance online until the other would be willing to get married becomes rarer... 

To get a work VISA I'd realistically have to go back to school until I'm in my THIRTIES (30s), by which I just won't care anymore.

All of my good friends are American, for me to work or study here I'd have to switch to a UK sleep schedule and could never really spend time with my friends, I'm at a dead end... At least if a job would pay £30k I could consider sacrificing the time with friends for now and save as much as I could, then vacation to the US often to try and find a partner, but working an entry-level menial job would drain me.

I feel like I'm not going to make it past 30 at this rate, I get bored so fast now online, I'd work from home but I tried to code and can't learn it, so I'm again just stuck here on government income waiting until I die",3,1738141602.0,depression,0,1.0,False

Happy all of a sudden,"Today marks 53 days since my husband & I lost our friend group suddenly. I want to know if this is normal or if I’m having a manic episode or something. I’m not bipolar (I actually have OCD diagnosed) and up til all this my moods were never this erratic.

About 2-3 weeks after we lost our friends, we started going back to church (they attend as well) and I went from being in denial and confused to severe depression that caused me to stop eating, barely drinking liquids, only able to sleep for about 2-4 hours at a time. Slowly I began to realize it was truly over but things have been complicated with them acting like they were sad or checking our social media or just acting weird. Hubby still works with the husband but sporadically since the guy barely shows up to work half the time.

Then my moods became erratic as I tried to heal but I couldn’t stop checking which socials I wasn’t unfriended from. I constantly ruminated, almost all my thoughts were about them and wanting to contact them though they wanted no contact with us. Even simply looking at WhatsApp to see when they were last online. Fighting with my husband, lashing out, blaming myself, him, even being mad at God (I feel horrible about all that especially that last one).

I had one good day where I woke up hopeful and even dare I say happy but the feeling didn’t last. I got my hopes up after one of them approached me to hug me and we texted for a few days then she suddenly stopped and I lost all hope again.

2 weeks later I began coming to terms and was trying to be more social with other people but having bad moments &  still checking their social media obsessively. But this past Sunday they weren’t at church and I began to feel happier. One of them was at church and smiled at my husband because he approached someone else to greet them and accidentally greeted her (he thought she was someone else) and even though she hated him up til last Sunday, she surprised him by smiling and saying hi back. Also last Sunday the other 3 had quietly greeted us as they were leaving church as though to say they weren’t as mad as before at us. 

Well Monday I suddenly decided I was not going to lay around feeling sorry for myself and waiting to see if they would contact us. I decided to leave it all in Gods hands and just focus on healing regardless if they ever speak to us again or not. It was finally 7 weeks since it happened. Well I decided suddenly to deep clean my living room, complete with moving heavy furniture by myself and scrubbing baseboards and everything. Not really like me to do stuff like that but I couldn’t take one more day laying in bed feeling like I was going to off myself over a bunch of people who are acting dumb.

Later that night I had a bad moment where I saw one of them had made a playlist about backstabbers and toxic people and I lashed out really bad at my husband. But later I decided again to just leave it in Gods hands and just go to bed.

Yesterday I woke up in an okay mood, but someone posted something in my women’s group that the wife of the friend group is still in, there are about 40ish women there and many often post although she almost never posts for the past year or so. Monday she posted “Amen!” To something a mutual friend posted. I got upset because she never posts anything and she doesn’t act like a Christian with how her and her family have been acting all this time.

Well this other lady I don’t know posted something and I shared an encouraging message but I alluded to the stuff I’ve been going through, where only she and maybe 2 other people would think maybe I was talking about that family although technically I worded it in a way that she may not know I was if she doesn’t really care. Which I have no clue about. But I felt like a weight was lifted off of me and I’ve been mostly happy ever since. I wrote it nicely, just saying we all have trials we’re going through but we should lift each other up and not let the devil win, that kind of thing. I didn’t even hint at blame or write it in a way she could feel bad, and like I said technically it wasn’t really about her. I can post in a comment my actual message if someone wants to see it (it’s religious so I’m not sure the rules in this subreddit).

Anyway it’s almost 3 am and I am finally going to bed (my sleep schedule has been messed up since I’m not working currently). I don’t feel wired or anything, just peaceful like it doesn’t matter anymore whether they reach out or they don’t. I feel sad the way everything went down, sad that one of them is still taking it very badly (the one with the playlists) but honestly they became very toxic people the whole last year of our friendship and I couldn’t see it because I was that naive. Like I don’t need people in my life if they’re going to be like that. I went out for coffee with an old friend and had a really healing conversation and went home pretty happy but assumed it was the coffee buzz. But I’m still happy now? Will I wake up all depressed again or is this acceptance?

TDLR; So is it weird to suddenly become really happy like this? And stay happy all day? Is this acceptance or is this some kind of mental illness, like is this normal?? I never thought I’d feel this free.",1,1738141356.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

Almost everywhere the answer is 10 grams x cup. But how much is a cup exactly. Quick google said its about 180ml of water. So I downloaded the manual found here:

https://products-salsify.geappliances.com/image/upload/s--7AYSkUUx--/j9ps7cfsqfoecc02numn.pdf?_ga=2.246173312.528199366.1704470171-700621882.1695050991

And ask ChatGPT to go through it and find out how my machine defines a cup of coffee in oz or ml. ChatGPT went through it and gave me an answer that seemed off, after checking myself I noticed page 10 said the answer. 4.5 oz.  I pointed out the page number to ChatGPT and said to double check carefully. Again… saying it says 5 oz. Frustrated I tried Claude Pro and couldn’t answer it on Sonnet 3.5. Kept saying error. Opus got it correcly first try. Deepseek had an amazing logic and got the answer right away. Gemini… lol cant upload or search the pdf through urls. 

So… can anyone try on pro different models? Or give me your opinion? I was thinking on switching from Claude to ChatGPT Plus again (i mostly do creative brainstorming and copywriting) but this simple mistake and the “certainty” in which it gave a wrong answer out of thin air has me thinking twice.",1,1738141271.0,ChatGPTPro,0,1.0,False

Usually by setting the grinder just slightly coarser I never had problems, but yesterday I had the same problem also with the ""usual"" coffee I've been making in the past months.

1icpkdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1icpkdn/how_to_select_the_perfect_rug_size_for_your/,"How to Select the Perfect Rug Size for Your Living Room, Bedroom, and Beyond","Choosing the right rug size is essential for creating a well-balanced, stylish, and cozy space. Whether you're decorating your living room, bedroom, or dining area, selecting the perfect dimensions ensures your [carpets and rugs](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) complement the furniture, define the space, and add warmth to your home. A rug that’s too small can make a room feel disconnected, while an oversized rug may overwhelm the layout. This guide will help you pick the ideal size for every room, ensuring a polished and inviting look.

# 1. Living Room: Define the Space with the Right Rug Size

The living room is often the heart of the home, making it important to choose a [carpet for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) that fits seamlessly into the space. The ideal rug size depends on your room’s layout and furniture arrangement.

# Best Rug Sizes for a Living Room:

* **Large Rooms:** A **9’x12’** or **10’x14’** rug works best if you have a spacious living room. It should accommodate all furniture pieces, with at least 8-12 inches of space from the walls.
* **Medium-Sized Rooms:** A **8’x10’** rug allows the front legs of sofas and chairs to sit on the rug while defining the seating area.
* **Small Spaces:** A **5’x7’** or **6’x9’** rug is ideal for compact living rooms where you want to highlight a coffee table or add texture beneath a floating seating arrangement.

# Pro Tip: If you want a bright and airy aesthetic, consider a [white carpet](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) for a clean, minimalist look. Just ensure it’s made from a durable, easy-to-clean material like wool or synthetic fiber.

# 2. Bedroom: Comfort Underfoot for a Cozy Retreat

Your bedroom rug should add warmth and comfort, making every morning step feel luxurious. The size you choose depends on your bed’s dimensions and placement.

# Best Rug Sizes for a Bedroom:

* **King-Sized Bed:** A **9’x12’** rug should extend at least 2-3 feet around the bed for a plush feel.
* **Queen-Sized Bed:** An **8’x10’** rug will provide enough coverage on either side of the bed.
* **Full or Twin Bed:** A **6’x9’** rug works well for a single bed, adding softness without overwhelming the space.

# Alternative Option: If you don’t want a large rug, use two [cotton rug](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/esmeralda-rug) or runners on either side of the bed for a softer landing when you wake up. Cotton rugs are easy to clean, lightweight, and perfect for a casual, relaxed bedroom style.

# 3. Dining Room: Frame Your Dining Area with Elegance

A dining room rug should be large enough to accommodate both the table and chairs, even when they’re pulled out. The general rule is to extend the rug at least 24 inches beyond the table’s edges to avoid chairs catching on the rug.

# Best Rug Sizes for a Dining Room:

* **For a Table with 4-6 Chairs:** A **6’x9’** or **8’x10’** rug works well.
* **For a Table with 8+ Chairs:** A **9’x12’** or larger rug is ideal.

# Style Tip: A white carpet can create a sophisticated, high-end look for the dining room, but opt for stain-resistant materials like wool or synthetic blends to make maintenance easier.

# 4. Hallways and Entryways: Make a Statement with the Right Rug Size

Hallways and entryways deserve stylish runners that add warmth and character to high-traffic areas.

# Best Rug Sizes for Hallways & Entryways:

* **Standard Hallway:** A **2’x8’** or **2’x10’** runner is ideal.
* **Small Entryway:** A **3’x5’** or **4’x6’** rug can help define the space and create a welcoming feel.

**Material Tip:** Cotton rugs work well in entryways as they are easy to shake out and wash, making them practical for areas prone to dirt and dust.

# 5. Outdoor Spaces: Extend Your Style Beyond the Indoors

Adding a rug to your outdoor space can make patios, balconies, and garden areas feel like a natural extension of your home.

# Best Rug Sizes for Outdoor Areas:

* **Small Balcony:** A **5’x7’** rug adds warmth without overwhelming the space.
* **Large Patio:** An **8’x10’** or **9’x12’** rug can define a seating area beautifully.

# Choosing the Right Material:

For outdoor rugs, look for materials like polypropylene that are weather-resistant and easy to clean.

# Final Tips for Choosing the Right Rug Size

1. **Measure Before You Buy:** Always use painter’s tape to outline the rug’s dimensions on the floor to visualize how it will fit.
2. **Leave Space Around the Rug:** Rugs should have at least 8-12 inches of breathing space from the walls.
3. **Think About Material & Maintenance:** A white carpet may look chic, but it requires more upkeep than darker tones. If easy cleaning is a priority, consider cotton rugs for a low-maintenance option.
4. **Layering Rugs:** If you have a smaller rug you love but need more coverage, layer it over a larger neutral base rug for added depth and style.

# Find the Perfect Carpets and Rugs for Your Home

Selecting the right carpets and rugs can transform your home’s aesthetic while adding comfort and warmth. Whether you’re looking for a cotton rug for a cozy bedroom retreat or a statement carpet for the living room, choosing the right size ensures your decor feels intentional and well-proportioned.

If I am not tossing him around, tickling him, and carrying him around he cries and fusses. We have a play mat, and a bunch of toys and teethers that he loves, then gets bored and fusses again. He enjoys his bouncer for 5 - 10 mins and cries more. Its been at the point having Sesame Street or Dancing Fruit play in the background has entertained him but even then its not enough. Having him watch TV makes me feel so guilty but cooking dinner, using bathroom, etc just would not get done. Taking him outside is hard because it never stops raining here and its usually 30 degrees and in our backyard my neighbor is nosey and a p\*do. I take him to swim lessons and shopping but he cries and fusses some more.

Today he got up at 8pm from his nap wanting to play with his toys and finally has went down at 12:30 am. Im up till 2am usually recharging because its likely he will wake up again, if I wake up from finally going to sleep my patience goes straight to 0 unless I stay up.

Its been like this for two weeks. He usually wakes up at 9-10am and takes a mid morning nap for 1-2 hours. And a evening nap that lasts 2 hours. This all gives me time to cook, clean, take care of two dogs, a cat, and take a shower.

I realize waking up at 10am is too late for him, but I wake up an hour before hand after staying up till 12am-2am to take care of myself, coffee, clean up house. I want to wake him up much earlier but I will be too exhausted if I do.

My husband has a huge success getting him down right away by rocking him. All my baby wants is to be held by him and he calms down a ton. If I try rocking my son to sleep he will flail around in my arms and cry which I cant have because my husband is sleeping and has work in the morning. My husband keeps telling me im rocking him wrong yet I feel like im doing exactly what hes been doing + my back hurts from doing that 30 minutes straight with a 99 percentile baby.

He gets home in the evening after work at 4pm (from a job he hates) is irritable and doesn't really talk to me much and doesn't really acknowledge our baby much, he goes straight to his computer till 8:30pm and gets frustrated every day when Im never in the mood for sex. He says I stay at home and dont do much besides play with the baby and clean. He wants me to cook every day, jog, go out, go to mom meet ups etc.

I am so mentally exhausted from my son and now my husband to the point I shut down and play on my computer or phone to recharge when the baby is napping and now he thinks thats me being lazy and just struggling and cannot adjust to being a SAHM.

If when hes home and I ask him to watch our child for a little bit so I can cook or vacuum, he sighs and goes fine. And just holds him while he plays on his PC and puts him back out in the living room. He is quick to give him back to me and will accuse me that the second he gets home I dump the baby on him.

Hes been a good father and took care of my son 90% of the time when I was bedridden and healing post partum for 3 months, hes a hard worker.. but I only get 2-4 hours of free time from the baby every day and he tells me thats enough of a break and I sleep in every morning and he doesn't get to, that I should have known what I signed up for and that we get no breaks.

On weekends I can sleep in while he watches the baby and thinks thats enough time with being with the baby. I just feel like I have no idea how to get it through to him about my exhaustion. He will either blame my diet (I eat very healthy twice a day), not going out jogging with the baby, etc.

I look for help here but when someone looks for suggestions about their baby being up late at night and not stimulated enough the answer is taking them out and less nap time. Im exhausted and the only places to take him are into stores. I have ADHD and have always been a night person. How can I reset my sleep schedule to get up at 7am and not 10am and how can I recharge if I give my son less naps?",2,1738140594.0,NewParents,1,1.0,False

I recently got a used Philips Incanto HD8911 and have been troubleshooting an issue with the steam function. Steam or hot water is not coming out of the wand but is escaping inside the machine. I do hear clicks when I press steam and I also see steam andd hot water filling up my drip tray so it's seems like it's working but it's just not pumping to the wand.

2. Removed and Cleaned the Brew Group – No change.


3. Opened the Machine & Found a Valve – Steam was escaping from what looks like a distribution valve inside. (Like in the video)


4. Removed & Cleaned the Valve – Soaked it in descaling solution, checked for blockages, and reinstalled it. Still no steam from the wand.

I do hear clicks when I press steam and I also see steam andd hot water filling up my drip tray so it's seems like it's working but it's just not pumping to the wand.

Here’s what I’ve done so far:

1. Checked the Steam Function – When I press steam, I hear the boiler working, but steam escapes inside instead of coming out of the wand.


2. Removed and Cleaned the Brew Group – No change.


3. Opened the Machine & Found a Valve – Steam was escaping from what looks like a distribution valve inside. (Like in the video)


4. Removed & Cleaned the Valve – Soaked it in descaling solution, checked for blockages, and reinstalled it. Still no steam from the wand.

What could be the issue here? I've never fixed a coffee machine before but so far I'm loving working on this and I hope it won't be a big issue. Any advice would be much appreciated. ",1,1738140373.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

1icpgj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1icpgj3/minimalist_decor_achieving_more_with_less_in_home/,Minimalist Decor: Achieving More with Less in Home Styling,"In a world full of visual clutter and ever-changing design trends, minimalist decor offers a breath of fresh air. The philosophy of “less is more” in [home decor](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) is not just about reducing excess but about curating a space that feels calm, intentional, and stylish. Whether you love sleek, modern interiors or want to blend minimalism with a touch of [boho decor](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/decorations), this guide will help you create a home that feels effortlessly elegant.

# 1. The Essence of Minimalist Decor

Minimalist home styling is all about clean lines, a neutral palette, and a focus on functionality. The goal is to remove unnecessary items while keeping only what truly adds value—both aesthetically and practically. However, this doesn’t mean a home should feel empty or lifeless. The key is in the details: thoughtful textures, high-quality materials, and a balanced layout.

# 2. Choosing a Neutral Yet Warm Palette

A minimalist home thrives on soft, neutral hues. Shades of white, beige, gray, and earthy tones create an open, airy feel. If you want to add depth, consider using boho decor elements like natural wood, rattan, or woven fabrics. These textures bring warmth to a minimalist space while keeping it visually interesting.

**Pro Tip:** Pair white walls with [boho wall decor](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/decorations), such as macramé hangings, handcrafted wooden art, or woven baskets. This subtle contrast adds personality without overpowering the space.

# 3. Decluttering with Intention

One of the key principles of minimalist decor is intentional decluttering. Every piece in your home should serve a purpose—whether functional or aesthetic.

* **Invest in Multi-Functional Furniture:** A sleek storage ottoman or a minimalist coffee table with hidden compartments can help maintain an uncluttered look.
* **Curate Decorative Accents:** Instead of overwhelming shelves with random decor pieces, display a few well-chosen items, such as ceramic vases, sculptural candle holders, or a single statement artwork.
* **Optimize Open Space:** Avoid overcrowding furniture; let your space breathe to create a sense of tranquility.

# 4. The Beauty of Minimalist Boho Decor

If you love **boho decor** but want to maintain a minimalist aesthetic, blending the two styles is easier than you think. Boho minimalism combines the simplicity of modern design with the warmth and personality of bohemian accents.

* **Natural Elements:** Add woven textures, linen curtains, or a jute rug to bring an organic feel to your space.
* **Statement Pieces:** A neutral-toned boho wall decor piece, such as an abstract painting or handwoven tapestry, can become the focal point of a room.
* **Subtle Patterns:** Instead of bold prints, opt for muted tribal or geometric patterns in throw pillows, rugs, or bedding.

# 5. Minimalist Decor for Every Room

# Living Room: Keep It Light & Airy

* Stick to a neutral color palette with natural textures.
* Opt for a low-profile sofa with simple, clean lines.
* Incorporate indoor plants for a refreshing touch.

# Bedroom: Create a Tranquil Retreat

* Use minimal bedding in soft, organic fabrics.
* Add floating shelves instead of bulky furniture.
* Place a woven boho wall decor piece above the bed for understated elegance.

# Dining Area: Simple Yet Inviting

* Choose a wooden dining table with sleek chairs.
* Keep table settings minimal—ceramic dinnerware and linen placemats work beautifully.
* Hang a statement light fixture to maintain a modern-boho balance.

# 6. Minimalist Home Decor in Dubai

Abstract
Morgellons Disease is a condition where micro-filaments are found coming from, embedded in or under the skin of patients and is complicated by accompanying infections throughout the body. Evidence is provided here for the source of Morgellons Disease and suggests that Morgellons Disease is caused by physical contaminants.

Keywords
Morgellons Disease • Dermatitis • Multi-colored filaments • Industrial micro-plastics • Physical Contaminants

Introduction
Morgellons Disease is identified and described by physicians as a condition that is painful and irritating, where multi-colored filaments are found embedded in, found under and or protruding from the dermis layers (skin) of patients. It is complicated by multiple infections found throughout the body. With very little literature on the subject of Morgellons Disease it is still very poorly understood. It is still not clear if the symptoms that are identified with Morgellons Disease have been isolated as solely responsible for this pathology. And, it has not been clearly documented whether the symptoms described to Morgellons Disease are associated with this one dermopathy and not in combination with other diseases or illnesses. Most importantly, in the past, the source of this condition has not been discovered by previous researchers. This seems to be where much of the confusion lies in describing Morgellons Disease. A proposal is made here to identify the physical source and etiology of Morgellons Disease as one of physical contaminants that are accompanied by additional acute infections.

Background
Over 14,000 families are reported to have the symptoms and suffering caused by Morgellons Disease. Symptoms that have been reported by patients with Morgellons Disease are described but not limited to: skin rashes, sores, irritation under the skin that causes itching, crawling sensations under the skin, filaments and threads imbedded in the skin layers or protruding from the top layer of dermis, extreme fatigue and tiredness, difficulty in concentrating, the loss of short term memory and depression. Morgellons Disease severely impairs an individual’s health and their quality of life. This contemporary disease was named after a disease in the 1600s, in France, where symptoms of dark hairs were found growing out of the skin of children. These symptoms may have been caused by the heavy fabrics worn and damp conditions of that era and can possibly be compared with the dark hairs that grow while wearing a plaster cast. The recent description of Morgellons Disease does not have the same description and its symptoms began to appear after 2002. As Morgellons Disease surfaced it was thought to be a behavioural and Central Nervous System (CNS) disorder by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and patients with its symptoms were diagnosed with psychopathologies. The physical symptoms of Morgellons Disease were thought to be delusions that caused physical manifestations appearing as parasites in the dermal layers of patients. At the same time it was also thought to be an immune deficiency state, a chronic inflammatory process and a possible chronic infectious process. Only recently has a clearer description of Morgellons Disease come from researchers.

Borrelia infections began to be associated with the appearance of filaments under the skin in 2005. And, in 2009 researchers concluded that Morgellons was a multisystemic illness that appears to cause various skin phenomena [1]. In the United States and Australia Morgellons Disease specimens taken from patients have included a number of Borrelia spirochete species. In 2016 Middelveen and Stricker reported that Morgellons Disease is a filamentous Borrelial dermatitis and classified it as a dermopathy. But a previous study done by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2012, concluded that the Disease was not caused by a pathogen [2].

Borrelia infections are caused by tick borne bacterial infections that produce spirochetes. Lyme Disease (LD) is one of these infections. Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes have been found in most but not all Morgellons patients and Borrelia garinii, B. miyamotoi and B. hermsii species have also been found in Morgellons patients [3].

After numerous physical tests, these researchers discovered that many of the filaments found in patients are composed of keratin and collagen. Some consider the number of tick borne diseases equal to the number of Morgellons Disease cases that have been diagnosed throughout the World. And, Morgellons Disease is thought to be a spirochetal infection by some researchers because its symptoms often resemble those of Lyme Disease.

Recent World maps of Morgellons Disease cases, on the World Wide Web, seem to show that the cases of Morgellons Disease are centered in the industrialized Western World culture: The United States and Canada, Western Europe, Australia and South Africa. Japan, parts of Indonesia, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea, which seem to be isolated territories, are shown to have a large number of cases but can possibly be linked to the Western territories through the industrialization and distribution of food products.

Materials and Methods
In January of 2019 I found micro-filament contaminants in the sugar supply. These filaments are almost impossible to see looking at the sugar crystals with the naked eye but can be seen at low resolutions under a stereo microscope. Later, observations of processed foods led to the discovery of micro-filaments in products like: cereals, tortilla chips, bread, frozen pizza and in coffee pods for coffee machines as well as sea salt and processed salts. Because sugar is used to sweeten most food products, and salts are used to flavor most foods, it has been concluded here that this is how much of the contaminant has spread to other food products. It was the observation of some processed foods that gave clues to the contamination of the salts. Filaments that make up the inner layers of the coffee pods along with separate micro-filaments were found to be contributing to the contamination of coffees.

Microscopy and Observations
After the collection of the specimens, observations were made and micrographs were taken in August of 2019. Strainers were used to sift the sugar crystals and allowed for the collection of filaments. Regardless of the use of strainers, any sample taken of the foods examined revealed the presence of these filaments throughout the products (Figure 1 and Figure 2).

A Southern Precision, Shimadzu Kalnew 1840-3 (Tokyo, Japan) Microscope was used to observe and take micrographs of micro-filaments and the food sources in which they were found. Measurements were taken using a printed micrograph slide where 1 division = 0.1mm, with additional divisions between. The filaments were found to be 3.3 ± 0.05um (microns) thick and 400um (microns) long. Capillaries in the human body are 5 to 10 micrometers wide (0.001mm= 1um (micrometer): 1 micron). Many of these filaments are pointed at one or both ends and are small enough to travel through all of the arteries and veins of the human body once entering the circulatory system. The smallest capillaries could potentially allow these filaments to reach the dermis (skin) layer (Figure 3-5).

The filaments seem to have an electro-static characteristic that allows them to stick to metals, plastics and other materials like glass; they also seem to have a static attraction to foods like coffee. It is possible that this characteristic allows the fiber to travel easily once in the blood stream. These filaments are well hidden in crystals of sugar and salt and some of them seem to have a hooking characteristic that resemble a filo virus shape. The filaments do not seem to be biological but may cause bacterial infection once introduced into the human body. In two investigations of sugar, insect abdomens were discovered. Some filaments taken from food specimens seemed to have bacteria attached (Figure 6). There were filaments found that were filled with liquid (Figure 7, 8) and therefore; bodily fluids could fill the filaments and make passage more difficult and lodging in the micro capillaries more possible.

Result
Morgellons Disease creates terrible suffering in humans. It is proposed here that Morgellons Disease is caused by multi-colored filaments that are industrial or bio-industrial products that contaminate numerous food sources in the United States and abroad, with sugar and salt being the main sources of contamination. All of the filaments found in examined food sources exactly resemble the colored filaments associated with, and found in, Morgellons Disease patients. Several insect abdomens were found in sugars, so the parasites and the filaments may be linked in the foods consumed in the Western and industrialized parts of the World.

The abnormal skin sensations associated in patients with Morgellons Disease prior to the appearance of lesions and the protruding of filaments have been documented at the CDC [2]. This reaction is the sensation of the filaments coursing through the body after food intake. These filaments are reaching the dermis layer after the system is over- run with the foreign bodies; the build-up in the system causes the filaments to leave the blood stream through the smallest capillaries and enter the skin, protrude and also become intertwined in the dermal layers during skin regeneration. The filaments probably interrupt skin healing which is propagated by patient scratching. But the lesions in true Morgellons Disease cases are not being contaminated with filaments from outside of the skin after scratching. In true Morgellons Disease cases; the micro-plastic filaments are coming from under the skin and are being ingested by the patients during food intake along with the insect body parts that cause Lyme Disease. This results in a buildup of these substances and the onset of other internal and external bacterial infections

While there have probably been patients with psychosomatic disorders examined along with patients who have classic symptoms that characterize Morgellons Disease, people with Morgellons Disease are not hallucinating this illness. These filaments are physical entities that are embedded in the skin, cause extreme pain, disfiguring discomfort and complicated infections. Some studies still suggest Morgellons Disease is a psychopathology [4]. But, the prescribing of antipsychotics for patients with true Morgellons Disease could be dangerous.

Making a number of diagnosis and observations in 2012 on the manifestations of Morgellons Disease, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said there is a malfunctioning of follicular keratinocytes (hair follicle keratin cells) but this may be due to the interference of the micro-plastic filaments with the hair and skin in the dermis. The CDC also noted that there were plastic filaments found in the skin of Morgellons Disease patients that were floral in color and some of these were florescent. The filaments I observed fit this description and were thin long micro-plastic filaments that were either bright in color or clear, with the exception of a few black filaments (Figure 6). On observation it is clear that these filaments were manufactured in an industrial setting. Some researchers have described the filaments as having root-like growths, but this could be due to the passing of the filaments through the capillaries and exiting through the skin. Although I have not directly examined any specimens from the Morgellons Disease patients, images on the Morgellons Research Foundation website of imbedded filaments resemble exactly the filaments that were found in all of the products examined which includes the sugars and salts.

While some researchers claim that some of the filaments are made of keratin and collagen it is likely that these filaments have not been made in the human body. Through genetic engineering Escherichia coli, bacteria, yeasts, plants, silkworms and other animals have been used to produce spider silk proteins having different, simpler, characteristics from a spider [5]. So too, could it be possible to bioengineer and produce hair-like filaments of a biological nature as well as chemically produce plastic filaments with similar characteristics. More recently new methods have allowed tougher filaments to be produced, than those that are made in nature (i.e. spider silk), during biomimetic processing.

The contamination of the industrialized food supply with micro-plastics, such as the ones I have observed, may be a global problem that has only begun to be recognized by the science community. In a study commissioned by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) researchers at the University of New Castle in Australia focused on the contamination of the Earth with micro-plastics that measured less than 1mm [6]. After examining fifty research papers the group found micro-plastic pollution in the sea; its surfaces and ice, the water column and deep sea floor, its arctic beaches; terrestrial and freshwater environments and in remote uninhabited islands throughout the World.

More importantly, they found that humans are ingesting almost 5 grams of these micro-plastics each week. Researchers at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany and the Swiss Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research found that micro-plastics were in ice cores taken from the Arctic [7]. This is a clear indication that micro-plastics have been polluting the Earth for a considerable length of time.

Discussion
The filaments I have found in food sources are suspected to either have been placed in the food as industrial bio-terrorism (industrial material used to contaminate the human body; to disrupt biological processes, cause illness or death) or, they originate at the industrial level of food production and can be found throughout the industrialized World in food manufacturing environments. The difference in the micro-plastics I have found, and what is quite troubling, is that these filaments are thin, long and fit well in the veins and arteries. They are small enough to travel into and exit the capillaries; which means they are capable of penetrating most other tissues and organs in the human body, including the brain. And this may be contributing to the loss of short-term memory found in some Morgellons Disease patients [1]. My observations of these micro-filaments revealed that these are indeed plastics (which have not eroded or changed over time). If the biomimetic filaments, that are tougher than those found in nature, have found their way into the food supply, like the plastics, these contaminants would not be easily broken down by the human body. Morgellons does not seem to be a natural Borrelia spirochete infection. But, it may be complicated by the accompaniment of Borrelia bacteria also present in contaminated foods. The CDC has said it is an unexplained skin disorder and that most of the filaments are cotton fibers. But the research of Middelveen and Stricker (2016) found that these filaments were not cellulose found in cotton, linen, plant based fibers or chitin . Neither plant nor fungal based, it was found that they contained keratin, which makes up bone, horn and other hard tissues and it is possible that some of these have been biomimetically produced or are byproducts of the industrialized livestock industry. Millions of people may have these filaments in their systems. And it may not become noticeable, or a problem that is addressed, until they are examined for other health conditions.

The insect abdomens I found in the sugar could have been those of the Deer tick (Ixodes scapularis) which causes Lyme Disease and could be the reason for the discovery of Lyme disease in many Morgellons Disease patients. Only tests that can identify the insect abdomens can determine their species and if the Borrelia bacteria spirochetes are present. But, it has led to the conclusion that Lyme disease in Morgellons Disease patients could come from the food products.

These insect body parts could be placed in a food sourse as bio- terrorism or simply, are in the food source because of the natural agricultural settings in which the food is gathered to be processed. Morgellons patients who have Lyme disease have two diseases, a cross infection that is only noticed after being examined for symptoms of one or the other. This reveals Morgellons Disease to be a syndrome made up of complicated physical and biological contaminants as well as bacterial infections. Truly, Morgellons Disease is an environmental problem which originates where we process our foods.

Conclusions
The Morgellons Research Foundation has found that antibiotics have been among the most successful treatments for the bacterial infections or protozoa found in patients with Morgellons Disease. Many of these infections, in patients that do not have Lyme Disease, are probably secondary infections caused by the filaments. Babesiosis found in conjunction with a Borrelia bacterial infection can be caused by the same tick that carries Lyme Disease. Patients who contract pneumonia, Borrelia or Babesia species infections are given antibiotics to resolve those symptoms. Filamentous contaminants that are ingested by Morgellons Disease patients may cause infections to arise in the lungs as well as throughout the body’s organs. In particular, the electro-static characteristic of these foreign bodies may increase the potential for bacteria to gather and infection to occur. Other possible treatments for physicians to consider might be surgical procedures to remove the filaments found in and under the skin with the hope that the skin will heal after surgery. Any parasite or bacterial infection can be met with antibiotics for known infectious symptoms as well as identified diseases that are secondary disorders caused by the filaments interruption and in-growth in the body's system. Exercise may help with blood circulation causing the foreign bodies to be removed during the body’s waste process. Finding the source in an individual’s diet, having a solid diagnosis and relieving any pain or infection will help control depression in these patients. Changes in diet can eliminate the intake of these filaments. This can help the Morgellons patient on to a course of recovery

1icpc2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/DolceGustoCoffee/comments/1icpc2a/would_you_recommend_the_system/,Would you recommend the system?,"Hi there, I'm looking for some opinions on Dolce Gusto pods, since I'm planning to buy a machine for my bf.

Basically I'm focused on the Dolce Gusto system, because it makes MILK coffee with the dual pods, so that's why I decided not to go with Nespresso. And since my bf is kind of strangely obsessed with everything Starbucks related - Dolce Gusto seems like a better option than Tossimo.

The thing is - I'm not sure if the coffee would taste good. Neither of us can try it beforehand, so I'm trying to find some opinions on the taste. Are the milk options like capuccino or late macchiato satisfactory? He's not a connoisseur, doesn't drink espresso, so I'm just looking for something that can make nice milk coffee with minimal effort.

What do you think? Are Dolce Gusto pods ok for that? Would you recommend them in terms of the taste?",1,1738139588.0,DolceGustoCoffee,0,1.0,False

We have a lot of people from my country where they're from and I go there once a week and they would like to know a bit to communicate with the tourists.

I agreed and they said they will pay for gas on top of the money for lessons. I am not a professional teacher, but I can teach my native language. So we met once and they were distracted and ended the lesson after 10 minutes. Ok, they paid me for gas so no harm done. The next day the lesson went ok, still they kept getting distracted, but we managed to go through the whole hour. 

Two days ago I came for the lesson and they were not there. I called and called and no answer. I was angry, but called a friend who lives nearby and we went for a coffee. I've seen the person who I was supposed to teach (let's call them Caddy)  and they said they're sorry, but their friend was in town so they wanted to meet up with that friend. I told Caddy that it's not acceptable because I wasted my day for them. Caddy apologized and said that the next day 100% we will have a lesson. 

I decided to not waste my time and gas and called Caddy before I started driving to our meeting point. Caddy didn't answer. I tried after 10 minutes. No answer. So I texted them to call me if they want a lesson or not. Caddy called me back 8 hours later. I didn't pick up because I was taking a shower. I called Caddy back after 20 minutes and there was no answer. I texted then and they read my message, but no answer. So today I have decided to ignore Caddy as they ignored me. 

My friend told me that I am the asshole and petty because i should not ignore Caddy. I said that I am not going to waste my time and why should I chase Caddy if they were the ones insisting on the lessons. They were so desperate because nobody else wanted to teach them so that's why they agreed to pay for gas so i could get there.

So me (23 F) and my boyfriend (31 M) have been together for 2 years but officially started dating a year ago. We recently went into what I read as the “argument phase” where we would argue about everything and anything to a point it may have caused a little strain in our relationship. At first it felt like he was distancing a bit from me even though he indicated that he may need a little bit of space cause he was going through something at the time. Which had created more arguments because I didn’t understand how to be there for him, we would continuously talk about how unhealthy the fights are and he has indicated that if they continue to be as intense he may just choose himself because he doesn’t need the stress. Which is highly understandable. We recently had a fight 3 days ago because he felt like I disrespected him and I didn’t apologise right away (which I later did) but after I apologised he woke up the next morning being very sweet like he had a deeper realisation that he loves me, he gave me a long hug and kiss from the back when I was making him coffee and kept kissing me and hugging me, he used to dismiss me asking him to call me everytime he comes back from work. After that morning his tone of texting me has changed, he texts more and seems happier, he even calls me on his own when he comes back from work. The things I would ask him to do before he is slowly starting to do it on his own. Is this something good or a form of realisation ?",3,1738139437.0,geminis,4,1.0,False
1icpae7,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1icpae7/it_hurts_that_you_feel_this_way/,It hurts that you feel this way,"I saw your Reddit post. Maybe you know that I know your TA account or maybe you don’t. Either way, I know it and I saw what you wrote. I’m glad you’re at least doing well. 

I am sad to hear that you feel like I never took this relationship seriously. While I agree with that sentiment to an extent, I also very much disagree with the sentiment that I NEVER took it seriously. But that’s to be expected when all you’re recalling is the bad experiences and are stuck in the past rather than seeing the growth that came as the relationship continued to develop. Either way, you’re allowed to feel as you do. I acknowledge that I could’ve done better and hurt you in the process as I know I didn’t grow/learn from my mistakes fast enough. 

That being said, you don’t seem to want to mention the genuine love we had for each other or all the good that came down the line. I took you out wine tasting for Valentine’s Day and took you on a fancy dinner to an Italian restaurant that day. When I traveled internationally for the first time ever, I bought many gifts for you because  they made me think of you AND I wanted to—and not even did I buy gifts just for you but for everyone in your family. I know I didn’t have to and you even said so yourself, but I truly wanted to because you and your family genuinely meant so much to me. I wanted to show you that I took you and your family seriously, in hopes of one day forming a small family of our own—because I truly loved you with all my heart and soul. 

Every visit, I would almost always cook your favorite meal for you. And would do so happily each time you visited because you loved it so much and there was nothing more I wanted to see than your bright smile and enjoyment. I understand that you’re annoyed and will continue to be annoyed/hurt. I don’t fault you for that and acknowledge that I fucked up throughout the relationship, but I do hope that someday you see that the relationship wasn’t all bad. Maybe it was even kind of special. But if being annoyed and staying stuck on my lack of action in the past is what will help you move on, then okay. I understand. 

Yes, I acknowledge that it took me far too long to take certain things seriously. And yes, I agree that I was much more proactive in the beginning. I truly feel like it would’ve continued to stay that way had we continued to be in the same space as long distance truly hasn’t done our relationship justice. But I guess we’ll never really know as that’s not where things are. I wanted to reach a middle ground about somehow closing the distance but it didn’t feel like it would be possible with where we were at. That’s on me for assuming things rather than asking the right questions. But I honestly wondered if it even would’ve changed things had I asked the right questions. 

Through the long distance, I learned though that even if I wasn’t able to show you love the way I wanted to, there were still other ways I could continue to do so and implemented—like buying you coffee when I knew you didn’t sleep well or had a long day ahead of you, offering to buy you a meal when you didn’t feel like cooking, or even paying for an Uber so that you could get back home quicker after a long day of travel so that you could be cozy at home and relax a bit sooner. Buying you your own set of skincare products so that you took better care of your skin and, when I was there with you, taking the time to gently apply it to your face and massaging it in.

I regret my actions (or lack thereof). I wish I knew then what I know now so that I could slap some sense into my past self that I really needed to step up my game and QUICK. I’ve always been a bit slow to learn because I’ve had to figure so much on my own by picking up the puzzle pieces (rather than being told outright) because I didn’t have that foundation every child needs/deserves in order to teach me what it meant to have and love a partner the way they deserve. A lot of what I’ve known is to learn how to protect myself because for so much of life, I was a burden to people and needed to do as little as possible to not rock the boat too much. Only in my late 20’s have I started to realize what it takes to love myself and be good partner. And even then, it’s been a long, pain-staking process. 
That’s not an excuse, but it is a reason. It’s one of the many things I’ve admired and been envious of about you—how well adjusted you are and the loving family you’ve had to teach you things and do things together like normal families do. 

It’s taken me far too long and many years of therapy to realize that I am a good person who is worthy of a love so deep and profound as the one that was right in front of me. 

I hope one day you can forgive me for being a dingus. I wish we could start over and have a fresh start together. But I know that that’s just a pipe dream that may never happen. 

No matter what, I will always love and miss you. 

p.s. it sucks that you think I have it in me to date right now or have the desire to be with another couple. That’s the last thing I want to do. I would rather be with you working through things, quite honestly. ",0,1738139364.0,heartbreak,0,0.5,False

It’s happened less often since i moved couches, but it still happens. And sometimes they just fully change their shirt in the lounge or walk into the kitchen pants-less to fully naked.

1icp2hp,https://apps.apple.com/de/app/bruu/id6661024887,bruu - new specialty coffee app,"Hey fellow coffee nerds,

I am Max and I fell down the coffee rabbit hole about 5 years ago and two years ago decided to build an app for it. 
Today I want to introduce you to bruu, my idea for an app to improve your and everyone’s specialty coffee game. It’s now available on the AppStore to download (and soon in the Play Store as well). 

With bruu you can 
- Search for roasters and their beans
- Check the taste profile and origin information of beans
- Find similar tasting beans to your favourite ones
- Rate beans and reviewing them including the taste notes you got from them
- Create and share recipes for how you brew your coffee
- Get updates for newly released beans from roasters
- Check what the best reviewed beans and roasters are 
- Follow other users to stay up to date with what they are brewing
- Share what grind setting you used 
- Translate other people’s grind settings to the grinder you are using
- And more in the future

As I am a solo developer and not a developer for mobile applications by training (nor is it my daytime job) I would really appreciate if you could download my app and give me feedback about it. That would really help me further improve it further and catch bugs. 

Also as of know the list of roasters that I have in the app is maintained by me. So if you have suggestions for specialty coffee roasters that aren’t in the app yet but should be, I would really appreciate your input and I will see if I can add them to the app.

My intention for this app is to put the taste and origin of coffee more at the center. In a similar direction in the future I want to make the producers of coffee also more visible to us the consumers to value the work that they are doing. I already have some ideas like for every bean showing other beans that come from an origin that is geographically close, but more to come in the soon. That being said I think most of you will understand that I do not plan to add “commercial”/non-specialty coffee roasters to the app. 

So please try out my app and let me know what you think of it ✌️

PS: To make it available in the Play Store I need some people willing to test it on Android phones. So if you do please reach out to me via DM and send me your Playstore account email address to get access.",15,1738138332.0,pourover,4,0.95,False
