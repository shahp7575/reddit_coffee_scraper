They agreed no problems and said it happens usually when they come here for lunch. They just seemed bummed because it was pouring rain out and they were clearly waiting out the rain and on lunch from high school. Super disappointing  this is how Fortino’s treats teenagers who will be future employees or shop here with their families oneday.

1p7ez4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p7ez4g/the_mug_order_that_caused_a_break_up/,The mug order that caused a break up,"I (31F) and my Boyfriend (35M) broke up last night.
We’ve dated a little over a year and both felt the other was the person we wanted to marry and have a family. We come from vastly different cultural backgrounds. I am American and he is Arab. We worked together in the same department which is how we got close and realized that we liked each other. Coworkers quickly picked up on the attraction and made it their mission to get us fired. When he would apply for promotion they would falsify claims that then got him turned down.
	At the beginning of the relationship, he learned that majority of my friends are male and when they would visit, they’d stay with me instead of a hotel. Thus the rule of no being alone with the opposite sex was born. I adhered strictly to it. He did not (later found out it was intentional so I’d ‘know how he felt’). 
	Then came the no being friends with ex’s rule when he found out I was still friends with one. After discussion, I agreed. That rule expanded, not verbally but through reacting to me getting messages, to not being allowed to have male friends because when they message it makes him love me less. That rule expanded again to I can’t even glance at a guy walking past to be aware of my surroundings. He literally acted like i kicked a dog when I did.
	We ended up having a heated discussion a month ago about our relationship, expectations and standards. He brought up being overly friendly with men (apparently chatting about video games is overly friendly) and I brought up double standards and that I’m not comfortable with multiple wives and threesome jokes. He recently started renting a room from a lady who has a history of being manipulative about our relationship. When I was napping and not answering my phone she accused me of cheating, criticizing my cooking while I was cooking easy heat up food for her when she broke her knee. During our heated conversation, we never raised our voices above a whisper yell and we were outside. We got a lot of issues sorted and felt good with continuing the relationship. Turns out she opened the window and listened to the whole conversation and then told him the next day that I’m emotionally manipulative and no longer welcome at her house.
Now the conversation that caused the break up. There is a guy at work, I’ll refer to him as dude. He is the biggest customer of my small business and has in the past placed a lot of orders with me. Dude has always made sexual jokes or comments towards me and my reaction was always to laugh it off and walk away. My abuser used to hit me or force sex when I rejected his advances so when this guy was coming on strong, I would just leave the situation. Bf asked me to cut dude out but since the department I work in is very small and we are cooped up, I was hesitant citing workplace communication. Dude also had a weird knack of bringing up topics that bf and I spoke about the night before causing bf to think I was talking about our relationship to dude. I wasn’t. 
After bf’s and my whisper yell conversation, I did completely cut dude off as well as one other guy and until yesterday hadn’t spoken a word to him and hadn’t even looked in his direction. Dude cornered me at the coffee machine and asked to place another order with me. I told him I’m busy this week and got away as fast as I could. I immediately let bf know and told him I can accept the order and he sit in on the meeting or if he’s not comfortable with it I can tell dude that I’m unable to accommodate the order. 
Bf called me last night when he was on his way to my place. He seemed tired. He went to have a conversation with land lady that he was going to move out and said that land lady was being manipulative again and we’d talk about it when he gets here. He then followed up on my message from the morning about dude. I said again if he’s not comfortable I won’t take the order. He asked how I think he feels about it and I said probably not comfortable. And he said and you still asked anyway? (During our whisper yell conversation we agreed when situations like came up to just say ‘ask partner’ but I was so flustered that I forgot and put dude off and spoke to bf instead) I said ok I won’t take the order. He then asked if it would negatively impact me. I was honest and said yes. I’d lose out on his order and the 6 or 7 other orders after he showed everyone my work.  But before I could say that it’s fine, I have other ways to advertise, bf started screaming and swearing at me saying to accept the order because he’s worth more than $40. And that he is done. 
My intention with the message in the first place was transparency and that I’d only take the order if he was ok with it because he is what’s important in my life. He then sent a message “My fucking peace is way more expensive than a fucking 40 bucks, this relationship isn't the way I deserve l am done”

1p7exa6,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1p7exa6/how_to_actually_glow_up/,how to ACTUALLY glow up,"Hello everyone, I hope you are all doing well. I want to get straight to the point and talk about how to actually be hot. You see so many posts and videos saying that confidence and self love are everything. Yes, I agree, they matter a lot. Confidence genuinely transforms how you carry yourself. But let’s be honest, sometimes you just want to know what practical things actually make you look hot.

*CURL YOUR LASHES. CLEAR YOUR PIMPLES. HAVE GOOD HAIR. HAVE HEALTHY EYES*

In my opinion, there are four main things that completely change the way you look.

First, your hair. Hair is everything. If your hair is unhealthy, thin, frizzy, breaking, or you feel like it just isn’t good, you need to work on it. I recommend Indian hair care. I started using it when I had thin hair and a lot of fall. I was literally balding. Within two weeks I saw a huge difference. In one month my hair started growing visibly, and in two months it was perfect. Shiny, healthy, thick, everything. And honestly, all I did was oiling. No chemical products.

Before this, I considered myself pretty average. Now people call me a four hundred and ten out of ten. I am not even exaggerating. I get complimented daily by classmates, people at tuition, strangers, everyone. Fixing my hair changed everything. Even if you have perfect facial features, clear skin and symmetry, it won’t matter if your hair is bad. And if you wear hijab, you still need to take care of your hair. Your hair is a part of you, even if it is covered.

Second, your skin. You need clear skin. Not glass skin, not glossy skin, not perfect skin, just clear skin. You may have acne, hyperpigmentation, or texture. That is normal. But if you have active pimples, acne issues or fungal acne, you need a basic routine and consistency. Go to a dermatologist if you can. Use the right products. Stick to them for two to three months and you will see real results. For me, I only had fungal acne, but once I treated it, my skin changed fast. You do not need glowing skin. You just need clean skin free from breakouts.

Third, your EYES
Eyes change your whole face. And no, having small eyes does not make you ugly. Every eye shape is beautiful. But you need to maintain them. Your eyebrows matter a lot. Keep them neat, shaped and clean, whether they are thick or thin. It completely transforms your expression.

Next are dark circles. Mild dark circles are fine, they even make your eyes look more appealing. But those extremely heavy, deep, very obvious dark circles can drag down your whole face. You need to work on them. Use coffee, ice rollers, or whatever suits you. They are not the biggest thing, but if yours are severe, they will affect your appearance.

Now the biggest part of this category: EYASHESSS. Eyelashes change your face more than you think. Here is the important part. Do not rely on mascara. It weakens them and makes them worse in the long run. Use a curler. Curl them daily. I curled mine every day for two to three months and now they stay naturally curled without effort. They look amazing, and people compliment them all the time. You can use a bit of Vaseline sometimes to hold the curl longer, but avoid mascara unless you want your eyelashes to thin and fall.

Lastly, deodorant. You will fall in love with it. You need a good deodorant. Poor hygiene instantly brings even a ten out of ten down to a two. Smell matters, and keeping yourself fresh is non negotiable.

That is pretty much it. I hope you all have the best glow ups ever. :)",2,1764180602.0,teenagers,2,1.0,False

I’m curious if most people in Singapore actually bother with this level of detail, or if you just set a monthly budget and let small spending slide. For example, do you log every coffee, hawker meal, or MRT ride, or just keep an eye on bigger bills like rent, utilities, and groceries?

I’m also wondering what actually works long-term. Do people use apps, spreadsheets, or just mental tracking?

But I think I totally misread it. She would always come over to me, start conversations, be really friendly. Then when I tried to take a small step closer to her - as in trying to see her outside work (we’re both women), it felt like she suddenly pulled back. Now we basically don’t talk at all. Like, literally nothing. In the coffee break room it’s just “hi, you alright?” and that’s the whole conversation.

1p7eubh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CookingwithDebs/comments/1p7eubh/sugar_isnt_just_sweet_heres_what_it_actually_does/,Sugar Isn’t Just Sweet — Here’s What It Actually Does in Your Recipes,"**Essential Skills Series: Sugars**

**About This Series**  
Each section is designed to help you *Spread Your Wings* in a culinary sense, giving you clear, reliable skills you can use every day.

**About This Section**  
This section explains the fundamentals of working with sugar — why measuring it correctly matters, how different types behave in baking, when packing or sifting changes the outcome, and what each sugar actually does in a recipe. Sugar controls far more than sweetness, and understanding how it works creates predictable, consistent results.

These basics help your cookies, cakes, and breads turn out the way you expect instead of spreading too far, drying out, or browning too quickly.

**About Sugar**  
Sugar changes the structure and outcome of baked goods because it:  
• retains moisture  
• encourages spreading  
• increases browning  
• influences whether baked goods turn out crisp or soft and chewy

**These are the basic ways sugar affects everyday baking; it also plays additional roles in advanced techniques like meringues, candy making, and syrups.**

Too much sugar can lead to:  
• excessive spreading  
• burnt edges  
• collapsed centers  
• brittle texture  
• a sticky or tacky surface once cooled  
• a wet or gummy texture even when fully baked  
• browning too quickly before the inside cooks through

Too little sugar can cause:  
• pale color  
• dry or tough results  
• reduced spread  
• bland flavor  
• a tighter or denser texture  
• baked goods that dry out or stale more quickly

Precise measuring keeps your baking consistent every time.  
For the most precise results, measuring sugar by weight ensures consistent outcomes.

#  

**What Granulated Sugar Is**  
Granulated sugar is made from sugarcane or sugar beets. The juice is extracted, crystallized, and dried to create the familiar white crystals used in everyday baking. When a recipe simply says “sugar,” this is the type it means.

**There are a few common forms:**  
• **regular granulated sugar** — everyday baking sugar with medium-sized crystals  
• **extra-fine or superfine (Caster) sugar**— dissolves more quickly and can create finer textures in cakes and meringues  
• **coarse sugar** — larger crystals used mostly for decorating, not for measuring into batters or dough.

Regular granulated sugar is ideal for most recipes because it dissolves predictably and provides consistent results. If granulated sugar is lumpy, break it up or sift it before using—undissolved lumps won’t melt during baking.

**The Correct Way to Measure Granulated Sugar**  
• Spoon or pour sugar into a dry measuring cup  
• Level it off with a straight edge  
• Sugar should sit lightly, level with the rim

This keeps the amount consistent from batch to batch.

**Tip:**  
To avoid spills and wasting sugar, measure over a bowl so any excess can go right back into the container.

**Where Measurements Go Wrong**  
• shaking the measuring cup  
• packing sugar down  
• tapping the cup to settle it  
• measuring in a liquid cup  
• compressing it to “fit”

This can lead to the unintended results mentioned above.  
Remember, small measuring changes make big baking changes.

**Brown Sugar**  
Brown sugar is white granulated sugar coated with molasses. Molasses is the thick, dark syrup left over after sugarcane or sugar beets are refined into white sugar. It adds moisture, flavor, and chew to baked goods, and has a deep, bittersweet flavor with warm, slightly smoky notes. Dark brown sugar contains more molasses, which creates a stronger and more intense taste.

Over time, the molasses can dry out, causing brown sugar to harden.

**How to Measure Brown Sugar**  
• Pack it firmly into a dry measuring cup  
• Level it so it sits flush with the rim  
• It should hold its shape when turned out

**Why Packing Matters**  
Brown sugar holds air between the granules, so packing removes that space. If it isn’t packed, your measurement will be less than the recipe intends, and that can lead to the unintended results mentioned above.

**Light vs. Dark Brown Sugar**  
• Light brown — mild molasses flavor  
• Dark brown — deeper molasses and more moisture  
Both can be usually be used interchangeably unless a recipe specifies.

**Fixing Hardened Brown Sugar**  
Brown sugar naturally dries over time.

To soften it:  
• microwave 10–15 seconds with a damp paper towel  
• place a slice of bread or apple in the container for several hours  
• use a brown sugar saver (small terra cotta disk)

# Once softened, measure as usual.

**Powdered Sugar (Confectioners’ / 10X Sugar)**  
Powdered sugar is white granulated sugar that has been ground into a very fine powder. A small amount of cornstarch is added to prevent clumping, which also helps thicken icings and frostings. “10X” refers to its fine texture—this is the standard type sold in most grocery stores. Powdered sugar can’t replace granulated sugar in most recipes—the two dissolve and measure differently. Use powdered sugar for icings, glazes, frostings, no-bake fillings, or dusting, not for creaming with butter. In cooking—not baking—powdered sugar can be used in small amounts if granulated sugar isn’t available, such as sweetening coffee or adding a little sugar to sauces or dressings, because it dissolves quickly.

**How to Measure**  
• Spoon into a dry measuring cup  
• Level it off  
• Sift only if the recipe instructs it or if the sugar is visibly clumpy

If a recipe says “1 cup powdered sugar, sifted,” measure first and then sift. If it simply lists powdered sugar with no instruction, measure it unsifted.

#  

**Additional Sugars (and When to Use Them)**

**Caster / Superfine Sugar**  
Finer than granulated and dissolves quickly — ideal for meringues, custards, whipped cream, and fine-crumb cakes.

**Sanding Sugar**  
Large, sparkly crystals used for decoration, crunch, and shine. Holds shape without melting in the oven.

**Turbinado (Raw) Sugar**  
Coarse crystals with a light molasses flavor — best sprinkled on muffins, scones, and cookies for caramelized crunch.

**Demerara Sugar**  
Similar to turbinado but slightly stickier with deeper caramel notes. Great for topping baked goods or stirring into hot drinks.

**Pearl Sugar**  
Hard, round pieces that do not melt — traditionally used in Liège waffles and Scandinavian pastries for pockets of crunch.

**Liquid Sugars**

Includes honey, maple syrup, molasses, agave, corn syrup, and golden syrup.  
Measure these in a liquid measuring cup, not a dry one.

Liquid sugars add:  
• moisture  
• chewiness  
• shine  
• color

Liquid sugars contain water which will change the structure of a recipe. Depending on the recipe, they can make baked goods softer, chewier, or slightly denser. which is why they cannot be swapped 1:1 for granulated sugar. Substituting a liquid sugar usually requires reducing other liquids in the recipe.

**Tip:** Lightly oil the measuring cup before adding sticky liquids — they release easily.

**Storage**

• Keep granulated, brown, and powdered sugar **sealed tightly** to prevent moisture, clumping, and hardening.  
• Store away from heat, steam, and humidity (avoid cabinets above the stove or dishwasher).  
• Sugar absorbs odors — keep it away from strong-smelling foods and spices.

**Brown Sugar**  
• Brown sugar dries out faster because of molasses.  
• If you don’t have airtight storage, seal the opened bag tightly, secure it with a twist tie, then place the whole bag inside a larger zip-top bag and press out the air.  
• If it does harden, soften it by adding a slice of bread or a damp paper towel to the bag for several hours.

**Powdered (Confectioners’) Sugar**  
• Clumps easily from moisture.  
• Keep the bag sealed and place it inside a zip-top bag with the air pressed out if you don’t have airtight storage — this helps keep it dry and free-flowing.

Properly stored sugar stays dry, easy to measure, and ready to use.

**Quick Fixes for Sugar-Related Problems**

**Too Much Sugar**  
**Cookies spreading too much:**  
Too much sugar or butter.  
**Fix:** Chill dough and measure sugar accurately.

**Too Little Sugar**  
**Dry or crumbly baked goods:**  
Too little sugar.  
**Fix:** Measure correctly; avoid under-filling cups.

**Sugar Causing Excess Browning**  
**Cakes browning too quickly:**  
Sugar caramelizes faster than batter sets.  
**Fix:** Tent loosely with foil; bake at correct temperature.

**Sugar Not Dissolving**  
**Glazes turning gritty:**  
Undissolved sugar.  
**Fix:** Sift powdered sugar before mixing or strain the glaze through a fine-mesh sieve.

**Glaze looks dull or chalky:**  
Too much powdered sugar or not enough liquid.  
**Fix:** Add liquid a few drops at a time and whisk until smooth and glossy.

**Sugar Crystallizing**  
**Simple syrup or caramel turning grainy:**  
Sugar crystals are forming in the pan.  
**Fix:** Do not stir once the sugar dissolves; brush down the sides of the pan with warm water to prevent crystals.

 

**Incorrect Balance in Frosting**  
**Frosting too thin:**  
Too much liquid or not enough powdered sugar.  
**Fix:** Add powdered sugar 1–2 tablespoons at a time.

**Frosting too thick:**  
Too much powdered sugar or not enough liquid.  
**Fix:** Add milk a few drops at a time until smooth; non-dairy options also work but may slightly change the flavor.

# Sweet Little Upgrade: Flavoring Sugar

These sugars are great for sprinkling on baked goods, stirring into drinks, topping popcorn, making cinnamon-sugar toast, rolling cookies for extra flavor, or adding a boost to hot cocoa, oatmeal, or French toast.

**Vanilla Sugar:**  
Place split vanilla beans in a jar with sugar and let infuse for 1–2 weeks.

**Citrus Sugar:**  
Mix sugar with finely grated zest, spread it out to dry for several hours, then store.

**Cinnamon Sugar:**  
Combine sugar with 1–2 teaspoons ground cinnamon and mix evenly.

**Flavored Powdered Sugar:**  
Pulse powdered sugar with cocoa, freeze-dried fruit powder, espresso powder, or peppermint.

Store flavored sugars in a cool, dry, odor-free place and shake occasionally to prevent clumping. They keep for months and become more aromatic over time.",1,1764180414.0,u_CookingwithDebs,0,1.0,False

The hole Nightfang blasted in the lab wall still smoked.

Glass crunched under CJ’s boots as he slowly turned away from the gaping opening where the Rocket balloon had disappeared. Caleigh stood beside him, shaken. Professor Willow leaned against a lab bench, his breaths shallow and unsteady.

Mew hovered above them, its blue glow faint… almost ashamed.

CJ looked up at it.

CJ:
“Mew… you knew this was coming, didn’t you?”

Mew turned away, tail drooping.

Caleigh:
“You looked scared back there.
Like you weren’t surprised at all.”

Mew’s voice slid into their minds—gentle, but heavy.

Mew:
“I was afraid…
Because I know more about Matt’s past… than I told you.”

Willow straightened, eyes wide.

Willow:
“You… you know what happened that night?”

Mew nodded slowly.

Mew:
“I saw his memories when we fought.
But memories can be twisted.
To see the truth… we must go back.
To your memories, Professor.
And to mine.”

CJ glanced at Caleigh, then at Willow.

CJ:
“Then let’s see it.
All of it.”

Mew floated to the center of the ruined lab, eyes glowing bright blue.

Mew:
“Hold onto each other.
You’re about to relive the night the lab burned.”

A psychic pulse washed over them.

For a moment, the broken lab dissolved.

Darkness swallowed everything.

🔥 Years Ago — The Original Lab, Coney Island

They stood now in a memory.

A younger Professor Willow moved through a clean, bright laboratory—notes scattered, machines humming. Outside the window, Coney Island lights twinkled faintly in the distance.

On a nearby table, a boy with messy hair and bright eyes fed berries to a Squirtle.

CJ stared.

CJ:
“That’s… Matt.”

Caleigh watched silently as the scene played.

Willow (younger, in the memory):
“Matt, once you’re done with Squirtle, I need you to double-check the incubators, okay?”

Matt:
“Got it, Dad! I want everything perfect before your big presentation.”

Willow smiled, full of pride.

Mew’s voice echoed quietly in the present CJ’s mind.

Mew:
“He admired his father.
He wanted to help.
He loved Pokémon… just like you.”

The memory flickered.

Night.

Alarms blared.
Red lights flashed.
Smoke began seeping under the doors.

An explosion tore through the far wall—machines blew apart, glass flew like knives, fire climbed the ceiling.

Younger Willow was thrown to the ground.

Willow (present) flinched, watching his younger self.

Willow (whispering):
“I remember this…”

The younger Willow scrambled to his feet.

Willow (younger):
“MATT! MATT!”

Squirtle’s panicked cry echoed from the other side of the lab.

Matt appeared through the smoke, coughing, holding Squirtle in his arms.

Matt:
“Dad! The tanks—something exploded!”

Another blast ripped through metal beams.

Part of the ceiling collapsed.

A heavy section crashed down between them.

Willow (younger):
“MATT!”

Matt:
“DAD!”

The beam hit the floor, sending shockwaves through the lab.

The scene slowed—Mew’s power stretching each second out like a long breath.

Mew:
“From here…
we see everything from three sides.”

The image shifted.

The scene split into three overlapping visions—
one tinted blue, one warm, one dim.

👁️ Perspective 1 — Professor Willow

Smoke burned Willow’s lungs as he clawed at the fallen beam, hands bleeding.

Willow (younger):
“Hang on, Matt! I’m coming!”

He pulled chunk after chunk of rubble away.
His fingers were shaking.
His lab coat was torn and bloodstained.

He found Matt’s arm.

Then Matt’s face.

Matt lay pinned, dazed but alive, Squirtle trembling beside him.

Matt (weak):
“Dad…?”

Willow:
“I’ve got you. Just stay with me—just stay awake—”

He heaved the last piece of debris, muscles screaming.

Willow:
“One more…
Come on… please—”

He managed to free Matt’s torso.

In the present, Willow’s voice broke.

Willow (present):
“I had him.
I had him, right there…”

Mew’s psychic voice was quiet.

Mew:
“You did.”

The younger Willow leaned in, about to lift Matt—

When a second explosion detonated at the back of the lab.

The blast hurled Willow backwards into a metal cabinet with a sickening crash.
He crumpled to the floor, unconscious.

The memory slowed.

His glasses lay snapped a few feet away.

Fire spread.

Smoke thickened.

Matt lay alone under the cracking ceiling.

The scene blurred.

👁️ Perspective 2 — Matt Willow

The memory rewound and replayed, this time tinted from Matt’s point of view.

Heat.
Screaming metal.
The ground shaking.

Matt:
“Squirtle—stay behind me!”

He shielded his Pokémon as fire shot past them.

The ceiling groaned.
A beam snapped.

Matt saw his father on the other side of the lab.

Willow (younger, distant):
“MATT!”

Matt:
“DAD!”

The beam came down.

Dust and stone slammed into him.
Darkness swallowed his vision.

He dimly heard his dad’s voice…
felt hands digging…
some pressure lifting off his chest…

But then—

A sharp, new explosion.

Pain at the edge of awareness.

The sound of his father’s voice vanished.

And then…

A new sensation:

Cool.

Soft.

Like being wrapped in water.

👁️ Perspective 3 — Mew

The world rewound once more.

This time everything glowed blue.

Mew hovered invisible above the burning lab, watching the destruction with horror. It had come to investigate an unusual energy reading—that’s all.

Mew:
“I was drawn by fear.
By desperation.”

It saw Willow digging.
It saw Matt trapped.

Mew darted closer, feeling both of their terror like needles.

Willow pulled Matt free up to his torso.
Explosion two hit.

Willow flew back like a ragdoll.

Mew flinched, eyes wide.

Mew:
“I thought… they would both die.”

The fire intensified.

The unstable equipment around Matt began to hum.

A third blast was coming.

Mew’s aura spiked instinctively.

Without thinking—
without a plan—

Mew wrapped Matt in psychic light.

Mew:
“TELEPORT.”

The boy vanished in a flash of blue.

The lab wall that had been behind him exploded a heartbeat later, obliterating the spot where he had been.

The scene jumped.

Mew hovered in a collapsed side corridor, Matt now lying beside it in the rubble. His burns faded under a soft psychic glow.

Mew lowered its head.

Mew:
“I tried to heal him.
To soothe his mind.
To ease the pain.”

Blue light washed over Matt’s face.
The burns receded.
Scars melted away.

But psychic energy and trauma twisted together, like crossed wires.

Fragments of Matt’s memory—
his father’s voice, the sight of the rubble, the scream of metal—
shattered like glass and re-formed in the wrong shapes.

Mew:
“I saved his body…
but I damaged his memories.”

Footsteps thundered down the corridor.

Men in dark.
Red “R”s on their uniforms.

Team Rocket agents.

Rocket Grunt 1:
“We’ve got a survivor!”

Rocket Grunt 2:
“Move, move! Get the kid out of here!”

Mew shrank back into the shadows, drained and terrified.

Mew:
“I was injured.
Weak.
Unsure if I had already done too much.”

A Rocket medic crouched, checking Matt’s pulse.

Rocket Medic:
“Still alive.
But look at the scanner—his neural patterns are scrambled.
Easy to… rewrite.”

They smirked.

Rocket Grunt 1:
“Let the boss decide what he remembers.”

They lifted Matt onto a stretcher.

Squirtle, separated in the chaos, was nowhere in sight.

Mew watched helplessly as Matt was carried away into the darkness.

The memory faded.

⸻

🕯️ The Aftermath — Willow’s Side

The vision shifted one last time.

Willow’s eyes fluttered open.
Firefighters were dragging him out of the collapsing structure.

Firefighter:
“We’ve got a live one! Get him out!”

Willow (weak):
“M… Matt… my son… my boy…”

Paramedic:
“We didn’t find any child survivors, sir.
I’m sorry.”

Willow tried to fight them, reaching back toward the burning lab.

Willow (younger):
“NO! He was there! He was RIGHT THERE!”

The flames roared louder.

Rescuers held him back.

Firefighter:
“If he was still inside, sir…
the last explosion…”

Willow collapsed, sobbing into his hands.

The scene dissolved into years of searching:
	•	Willow posting flyers with Matt’s picture
	•	Willow arguing with League officials
	•	Willow begging for more search funding
	•	Willow staring at stacks of unsolved reports
	•	A candle lit under Matt’s photo every night

Mew’s voice trembled.

Mew:
“I watched from a distance.
I thought… if he believed his son was gone… he might heal.
I was wrong.”

The memories dissolved.

⸻

🌫️ Back in the Present — Willow’s New Lab

They snapped back into the half-ruined laboratory.

The smell of smoke.
The hole Nightfang had blasted.
The quiet hum of damaged equipment.

Professor Willow was on his knees, tears streaming down his face.

Willow:
“I… had him.
I almost pulled him out.
I failed him… twice.”

Mew floated lower, barely able to look at him.

Mew:
“You tried.
I saw it.
They saw it.”

CJ swallowed, throat tight.

CJ:
“So Matt… survived because of you…”

He looked at Willow.

CJ:
“…and because of you.”

Mew’s glow dimmed.

Mew:
“And he suffers…
because of me.”

Caleigh wiped her eyes with her sleeve.

Caleigh:
“Team Rocket grabbed him while the Professor was unconscious…
and twisted his mind to fill in the blanks.”

CJ nodded slowly.

CJ:
“Which means…
under all that anger…
there’s still the real Matt.
Somewhere.”

Willow stared at the floor.

Willow:
“How do I face him…
after the life he’s lived?”

CJ looked determined.

CJ:
“We don’t run.”
“We don’t hide.”
“We find him.
We show him the truth again—this time without anyone twisting it.”

Mew hovered between them.

Mew:
“I will not run again.
I owe him the truth.
All of it.”

The lab fell into a heavy silence.

Then the scene shifted—

⸻

🌉 Deep Below Coney Island — Nightfang’s Return

Far beneath Coney Island, the secret Rocket train screeched to a halt in the underwater tunnel station.

Nightfang stepped off alone.

No grunts.
No Trish.

Just him.

His half-shattered mask hung at his side.
His face—no scars, no burns—was twisted with something new:

Doubt.

He walked through a hidden exit, emerging into the underground remains of the old lab site. The place had been sealed, fenced off, and buried under decades of concrete—
but Rocket had carved a path through the rubble long ago.

Nightfang stepped into what was left of the ruin.

Peeling paint.
Half-melted equipment.
Charred walls frozen in time.

He walked toward a section of wall half-rebuilt with concrete and plaster.

A faint mark showed where a memorial plaque had once hung.

Nightfang ran his fingers over it.

His breath shook.

Nightfang (quietly):
“This is where Matt Willow died…”

He moved deeper.

Through a side tunnel, he reached a small, hidden storage room—untouched, sealed behind a warped metal door. Rocket scanners had opened it weeks earlier, but he’d never bothered to come.

Now he did.

Inside were boxes, stacked neatly.

Labels written in Willow’s handwriting.

“MATT – SCHOOL REPORTS”
“MATT – BIRTHDAY GIFTS (UNDELIVERED)”
“MISSING CASE FILE – MATT W.”

Nightfang froze.

His hands shook as he opened the last box.

Inside:
	•	Copies of missing posters with his face on them.
	•	Letters Willow wrote to League officials begging for renewed searches.
	•	A private logbook titled: “Search for Matt – Day 1… Day 734…”

He flipped through it.

Willow (written):
“Day 149: Authorities insist my son perished. I refuse.”
“Day 367: Lab ruins searched twice. I will search again myself.”
“Day 512: A witness reports seeing a boy matching Matt’s description near a port… Could it be?”
“Day 734: I’m moving labs… but I will never stop looking. Not until I find my son… or the truth.”

Nightfang’s vision blurred.

Something fell from his hand—
a small, unopened box.

He picked it up slowly.

The tag read:

“For Matt — 13th Birthday.”

His breathing cracked.

Nightfang:
“…No.”

He opened the box.

Inside was a small Poké Ball charm on a chain, with an engraving on the back:

“To my partner in research.
Love, Dad.”

Nightfang’s knees hit the floor.

Nightfang (whispering):
“All this time…
You were looking for me…”

Tears hit the dusty concrete.

He slammed his fist into the floor, torn between rage and guilt.

Nightfang:
“Then why…
WHY did they tell me you didn’t care…?”

He saw flickers now—
memories stirred by Mew’s vision and the room around him:

A hand digging him out.
A voice screaming his name.
Blue light.
A Rocket mask.
A lie whispered in his ear:

“They left you.
We’re your family now.”

Nightfang clutched the charm so hard his knuckles turned white.

Nightfang:
“What have I done…?”

He thought of the coffee shops he’d burned.
The homes.
The threats he’d made to CJ and Caleigh.
The vow to kill Willow.

His face hardened.

Not with hatred.

With grim resolve.

Nightfang:
“If he really searched for me…
If he really never stopped…”

He stood slowly.

Nightfang:
“Then I need answers.
From him.
From Team Rocket.
From EVERYONE.”

He slid the cracked half-mask back onto his face.

Nightfang:
“I need to know who I really am.”

The charm chain dangled from his hand as he walked back toward the tunnel.

⸻

🌌 Back at Willow’s Lab

CJ stared at the hole in the wall, thinking of Matt somewhere out there in the dark—
hurt
angry
but no longer entirely blind.

Caleigh broke the silence.

Caleigh:
“If he sees what we saw…
if he finds proof…”

CJ nodded.

CJ:
“He’s going back to where it all started.”

Willow looked up.

Willow:
“The old lab…”

Mew’s eyes glowed softly.

Mew:
“He is walking the path between who he was…
and who he became.”

CJ clenched his fist.

CJ:
“Then we follow him.
To Coney Island.
To the truth.
To fix what Team Rocket broke.”

Caleigh smiled faintly.

Caleigh:
“Skwovets and I are in.
All the way.”

Willow straightened, wiping the last of the tears from his face.

Willow:
“So am I.
I won’t fail my son again.”

Mew hovered over them, brighter than before.

Mew:
“Then our journeys are no longer separate.
We walk this one together.”

Outside, the sky darkened—

a storm gathering over both New Jersey and Coney Island.

The past had finally been revealed.

Now came the harder part:

Facing it.

And trying to rewrite a future that wasn’t built on lies.

hey! so i'm 19F been struggling with disordered eating since like middle school but last year it got the worst it has ever been and i got to my lowest weight ever and at the end of the year ended up involuntarily hospitalized for about 3 months & diagnosed w anorexia.

so it was in march i believe when i got discharged from the ward and i did okay for a while and about maintained my weight but then during summer i gained some additional weight ""on my own"" (to a number i swore last year i would ""never ever let myself get to again...) and then made the mistake of weighing myself and... yeah i think you'll be able to just guess the rest 🥲

so during the past few months i feel like i've been slowly slipping into a relapse. i've lost a bit but not a rapid amount... yet. occasionally also binging/overeating and then afterwards often punishing myself in some way like hurting myself or going for a run quite literally in the middle of the night.

i held up somehow until just these past few weeks or maybe like this past month (november) idk. BUT then the universe just gave me a big ""fuck you"" i guess because my nurse from the outpatient clinic who i usually meet weekly for support has now been gone for weeks (the clinic has called/texted me many times giving me a date when she'll be back at work but so far every time she's not actually been back and then i've been given a new date of when she should be back so i'm guessing she got sick/injured or something like that). and on top of that i think it was like last week when i also ran out of my anxiety meds because my psychiatrist had forgot to renew the prescription and now i've been fighting with the clinic to get the prescription renewed because apparently by psychiatrist didn't even reckon me asking for a renew (i 100% did i remember we talked about it) and i still don't have the meds.

so anyways everything that has happened these past months (this time of the year is also kind of a traumatic season for me i just realized since for some reason almost all the shit that has ever happened to me has happened during the later half of the year) and then not really having anyone to talk to i guess just kind of has slowly kept pushing me more and more into a relapse. and idk last week i guess something in my brain just snapped and now i think i've gone the longest time i ever have without any food (so basically ""fasting"" as i've only drank zero/close to zero calorie liquids like water, coffee, diet soda, energy drinks) and now i'm starting to be a bit scared to even eat again...

***(NOW WE GET TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION lol sorry)*** rationally i know i need to get some calories in me sooner or later but i'm scared i'll end up overeating/binging or get refeeding syndrome when eating again after not eating for many days OR (this one is probably more or less just an ed thought but still) gain weight even if i still ate on a deficit... but i've now also been weighing myself every morning during this ""fast"" and the number dropping has already become lowkey addicting and i don't want it to stop 🥲

SOOO i was thinking would a nutritional supplement drink like nutridrink for example (the ones they give you inpatient and can also get from pharmacies) be a good solution in this situation? with them i wouldn't at least be scared of overeating/binging, they're liquid and i know the exact calories.

and when it comes to refeeding syndrome i know it's rare yes and i didn't even get it when i was inpatient but back then i never fasted for long periods of time at once like when i was admitted i had maybe fasted for around 48h when i first ate/drank something in the hospital. so is there any risks now that i've fasted for longer?

phew okay i'm so sorry for all the rambling but THANK YOU so much if you read it all or even if you read the main questions and can give some answers ❤️",1,1764180360.0,AnorexiaNervosa,1,1.0,False

The last night Arabelle Greyle spent with Benjamin Chantler, he lost control more than ever.

Her fingers brushed against the ring on his hand—and in that instant, memories came flooding back.

Just a few days ago, she'd seen the gossip online: Benjamin was about to marry the daughter of the Shelton Group's CEO.

Noticing she was distracted, he leaned down and gave her a long, intense kiss.

With her mind all foggy from passion, he slipped a bank card into her bra.

""Just be good for me. I'm getting married next month. Let's end this.""

Arabelle nodded obediently. ""Okay.""

Seeing that she didn't cry or make a scene, Benjamin frowned instead. ""You okay?""

Arabelle gave him a light and comforting laugh. ""I'm good.""

She had long moved past the point where his actions could hurt her.

Everyone who knew them could see that Arabelle was crazy about Benjamin, almost to the point of obsession.

She'd been chasing him since she was 18.

Right after graduation, she joined the Chantler Group and became his secretary.

During the day, she helped him out at work without a hitch. At night, she was right there in bed with him.

Whenever trouble came up, she'd jump in front of him like a shield. When it came to parties and drinks, she'd step up to take shots for him.

She always carried three notebooks in her bag filled with all his likes and dislikes. The moment he gave her a look, she knew exactly what he needed.

For seven years, she followed him—without a title, without a promise. Only recently had people begun to change their tone.

Instead of calling her foolish, they'd smile and ask when the wedding news would come.

No one could believe she'd just sit back and watch him marry someone else. Not even Benjamin.

What they didn't know, though, was that a week earlier, Arabelle had already said yes to her parents' request to head back to her hometown for a blind date.

\*\*\*

She first met Benjamin when she was 18.

One day, she got a call from her mother.

""Belle! Your dad was in a car crash. He's in the ER— it's bad. You need to come home right now... before it's too late.""

Arabelle's mind went completely blank.

In a panic, she rushed out and accidentally crashed into Benjamin's car.

Luckily, he hit the brakes just in time. She wasn't hurt too badly. After getting up, she limped toward the hospital as fast as she could.

Benjamin stopped her. After asking what happened, he made a quick phone call and then drove her there himself.

When they got there, the hospital director quickly led in the best team for surgery—and somehow managed to bring her dad back from the brink of death.

Arabelle and her mother held each other tight, their faces wet with tears of joy.

Through her blurry eyes, she spotted Benjamin standing a little way off, quietly thanking the hospital director.

That was when she realized he was the one who'd asked the director to come.

At that moment, the young man in the light, calm and serious, felt like a god who'd appeared in her life.

At first, all Arabelle wanted to do was thank him.

That was why she'd been by his side, trying to find small ways to show her appreciation for what he'd done.

After graduation, she joined the Chantler Group and somehow ended up sleeping with him one night. Then she became his personal secretary.

Over time, her feelings changed.

During those rare moments when he showed her kindness, she found herself having desires that felt a bit too greedy for comfort.

It was only a month ago that Benjamin suddenly started acting really cold toward her.

Feeling uneasy, she hesitated for quite a while.

After one close moment together, she finally gathered the courage to ask carefully, ""Mr. Chantler, did I do something wrong?""

Benjamin's icy, serious eyes narrowed at her.

After what felt like forever in silence, he replied, ""I'm just kind of tired of this.""

Arabelle's face went pale. Under his indifferent stare, she hurried away in embarrassment.

That same day, Benjamin left for a business trip overseas. For the first time, he didn't take her—his personal secretary—along with him.

The next day, she stumbled upon the news that he was engaged to Adelina Shelton.

When he returned a week later, there was an extra wedding ring on his finger.

That was when it hit her.

All good things have to come to an end, and it was time for her to say goodbye to Benjamin.

Benjamin had already moved out, leaving her the apartment where she'd lived for seven years.

Arabelle quickly reached out to a real estate agent to put it up for sale.

The apartment was in a great location, and she priced it way lower than what others were asking. The agent marketed it as a top listing, and that very night, someone came by to check it out and put down a deposit.

After signing the contract, the agent beamed at her. ""Ms. Greyle, the buyer is paying in full! We should wrap everything up in about a week.""

Arabelle paused for a second, then smiled and nodded.

""Alright, thanks!""

After the agent left, she started packing up the apartment.

The little lucky cat figurine on the shoe cabinet had been there since her first day moving in.

Benjamin used to joke about that cat figurine. But as soon as she turned around, he pushed her against the shoe cabinet and kissed her like he couldn't get enough.

He playfully nibbled on her earlobe while his deep voice rumbled with laughter.

""You believe this little thing can bring you luck? I can do a better job than it.""

The living room carpet was something he'd spotted at a mall during one of their overseas trips together.

He just whipped out his card and bought it right then and there. It took over half a month to arrive from across the ocean.

Once she unpacked it, he started unbuttoning her clothes with a mischievous glint in his eyes.

""When I first saw this carpet, I thought it looked very comfy to lie on.""

On the single-seat couch in the corner, he had a rare moment of softness. Once, he held her in his arms when she was sick and comforted her gently.

The razor in the bathroom was the first gift she ever gave him, and he used it for years.

On the title page of ""Business Warfare Strategies,"" the book on the far left of the shelf, there was a quick sketch of her that he drew on a whim. It was not perfect but really captures her essence.

Seven years felt like such a long time.

Long enough that even someone as proud and distant as Benjamin made unforgettable memories with her all over this place.

Arabelle went through her things, keeping some and discarding others.

But eventually, she just collapsed into the mess of scattered items, crying uncontrollably.

Chapter 2

She cried all night.

The next morning, she put some ice on her eyes for half an hour and then slathered on a thick layer of foundation. It was only then did her eyelids finally stop looking so puffy and red.

She pulled out the resignation letter she had written ages ago and headed straight to the office.

As soon as she sat down at her desk, she noticed all her coworkers in the department giving her those subtle, sympathetic looks.

Before Arabelle could ask what was up, Benjamin's office door swung open.

Adelina stepped out.

She was rocking a fancy custom dress with flawless makeup. She carried herself with that effortless elegance of someone from a wealthy family, moving around the office like she owned the place.

Arabelle finally figured out why her coworkers were giving her those sideways looks.

Everyone thought she was going to be the future wife of their boss.

But just like that, Benjamin got engaged, and her situation became awkward.

When Adelina spotted her, though, she didn't seem upset at all.

With a sweet smile on her face, she handed over an invitation to Arabelle and warmly invited her.

""Good morning, Ms. Greyle! Benjamin and I are having our engagement party in a week. I came here just to hand out invitations.

""You've worked with Benjamin the longest. We'd love for you to join us!""

Arabelle quickly put on a polite smile and took the invitation from Adelina with both hands.

""Congratulations to you, Ms. Shelton, and Mr. Chantler.""

Adelina kept her smile as she leaned in a bit closer, lowering her voice to a whisper just for the two of them.

""I heard you thought you could marry into the Chantler family? How ridiculous.

""Benjamin was just using you to practice. Otherwise, how would he keep me happy after we're married?

""Open your eyes and see how big the gap is between us. Just give up on this silly dream already.""

She maintained that smile throughout, acting all friendly. Anyone who didn't catch their chat would have thought they were just sharing some light gossip.

Arabelle stayed calm on the outside, but her fingers tightened around the invitation until her knuckles turned white.

She understood why Adelina was acting like this—who would want their husband's ex hanging around? Still, there was an uncomfortable knot tightening in her chest.

Arabelle pressed her lips together and decided to lower herself even more.

""Don't worry, Ms. Shelton. I know my place.""

There was a cold edge behind Adelina's smile.

""I hope so. But honestly, I've never been one to bet on whether people know how to behave.""

In the next moment, she grabbed Arabelle's hand and suddenly stumbled backward. Before Arabelle could react, Adelina fell straight to the floor.

After letting out a sharp cry of pain, she looked up at Arabelle with wide eyes.

""Ms. Greyle, I invited you to our engagement party. Why did you just push me down?""

The office door swung open, and Benjamin stepped out with long strides.

When he saw Adelina lying on the ground, he rushed over to help her up.

""Adelina, what happened?""

Adelina looked up at him, her eyes red and puffy. ""I was just giving Ms. Greyle the invitation for our engagement party and asking if she could come. But out of nowhere, she got upset, pushed me away, and told me to leave.""

Benjamin shot a glance at Arabelle, his eyes cold.

Arabelle frowned and quickly tried to explain, ""I didn't...""

But Benjamin cut her off sharply.

Turning back to Adelina, he asked, ""What kind of status does she even have? Is it really worth you coming all this way just to invite her?""

The room went silent. His harsh words hit Arabelle like a punch in the gut for a moment.

Adelina paused for a second but then quickly put on a smile and playfully whined at Benjamin.

""But she's your chief secretary! I just thought I'd help you keep talented people around.""

Benjamin scooped her up into his arms and headed toward the office.

As he walked, he said with a bit of authority, ""You're the future wife of this company's boss. No one's more important than you.

""Where did you twist your ankle? Let me take a look.""

Arabelle stood there, frozen with a blank look on her face, watching them walk away.

Adelina was really rushing. She couldn't even wait for Arabelle to hand in her resignation letter. But honestly, with such clumsy acting, how could Benjamin not see through it?

Still, he chose to have her back.

They were all adults here. Fairness couldn't be obtained just by throwing fits or crying about it.

A heavy feeling settled in Arabelle's chest as she calmly pulled out her resignation letter.

Just when she was about to go in and ask Benjamin to sign it, he suddenly walked out.

He stood tall and straight, his clothes fluttering a bit as he moved. His long fingers tapped lightly on her desk, and he said bluntly, ""Adelina doesn't want to see you. So just resign.

Benjamin's cold, hard gaze showed no emotion at all.

Arabelle's heart raced for a moment, and she tightened her grip on the resignation letter she'd prepared that morning.

After seven years of working hard at the Chantler Group, she never thought she'd be leaving like this in such a humiliating way.

A bitter smile crept onto her face as she nodded slowly.

""Alright.""

Her calm acceptance with no tears and no shouting, sparked a surprising bit of annoyance in Benjamin's chest.

He frowned. ""Just leave today. I'll have the finance team give you double what you're owed.""

Arabelle smiled faintly. ""Got it. Thanks, Mr. Chantler.""

Benjamin turned and walked away without looking back.

Chapter 3

Arabelle sat back down at her desk, ripped up the resignation letter she no longer needed, and submitted her resignation through the company system.

Maybe Benjamin had already given HR a heads-up. Her resignation got approved almost right away, and it was quickly sent over to Benjamin for his final confirmation.

Not long after that, a notification popped up on Arabelle's screen. ""Your resignation application has been approved.""

At the same time, a large sum of severance pay landed in her bank account.

She hurriedly packed up her stuff. As she walked out with her things in hand, she passed by Benjamin's office.

The door wasn't fully shut. There was just a little crack.

Through that gap, she spotted Benjamin inside, head down as he looked over some papers. Adelina was sitting next to him, enjoying a dessert.

She took a bite herself and then scooped another spoonful of dessert and offered it to Benjamin. ""You've gotta try this. It's so good!""

Benjamin took a bite of the cake with the spoon that Adelina had used without hesitation. ""It's pretty good.""

Arabelle glanced at his face and gave a wry smile.

On her first day at work, she found out that Benjamin had two hard-and-fast rules.

First off, he was a germaphobe and never shared utensils with anyone.

At first, he wouldn't even kiss her in bed.

Their first kiss only happened because she was running a high fever. Her mind was all foggy from it, and when she talked to him, their lips accidentally brushed against each other. She went pale with shock, but he just leaned down casually and kissed her.

Back then, Arabelle thought she was special to him.

Secondly, he really didn't like sweet stuff.

After being with him for seven years, she had never seen him touch anything sugary. Even when she treated herself to some cakes now and then, he wouldn't even look at them.

She had memorized all his likes and dislikes. She filled up three thick notebooks with notes because she was scared that even the tiniest mistake would annoy him.

But it turned out her ""secret rulebook"" was just a big joke.

When he met the right person, he was willing to tolerate everything.

So, pulling out that heavy notebook, Arabelle let out a laugh at herself before tossing it in the trash without thinking twice and walked away.

Benjamin looked up from his papers. Through the crack in the door, he caught a quick glimpse of someone familiar rushing by, and for a moment, it threw him off.

When Arabelle got home, she told a few friends that she had decided to quit her job and head back to her hometown. They made plans to grab dinner the next day.

She thought she'd never see Benjamin again in her life. But surprisingly, as she followed the waiter toward their private room, she spotted someone familiar on the second floor out of the corner of her eye.

It was Benjamin and his friend leaning against the railing, smoking away.

With his back turned to her and a faint red glow from the cigarette between his fingers, there was an unexpected touch of loneliness about him.

Arabelle only stole a glance at him before looking down quickly, pretending not to notice him.

But then she heard Benjamin talking to someone else carried over by the wind.

She could make out his friend's voice asking, ""Are you really thinking about marrying Adelina? Ms. Greyle has been around for so long. We all figured you'd end up with her.""

Benjamin's tone was flat. ""I never thought about it.""

His friend chuckled and teased, ""Well, aside from her family not being the best, Ms. Greyle is gorgeous, knows how to handle things, and has been totally devoted to you. After all this time, you've never felt anything for her?""

Benjamin went quiet for a couple of seconds. Then his cold, indifferent voice floated over to her on the breeze.

""How could I ever let myself catch feelings for a plaything?""

Arabelle froze. The blood drained from her face.

When she caught the waiter's curious gaze on her, she dug her nails into her palm and slowly followed along.

She ate without tasting a thing. Her friends were all college roommates who knew about her feelings for Benjamin over the years.

When they found out she was heading back home, they felt both happy for her and sorry for what she'd gone through. The group hugged each other tightly and cried together.

After the lively crowd thinned out, Arabelle watched as her friends got picked up one by one by their husbands or boyfriends. Once again, she was left all alone.

She tightened her grip on her bag strap and was about to head out when her phone suddenly rang.

Glancing at the screen, she saw it was Benjamin calling. She reached to hang up, but accidentally hit ""answer"" instead.

Frowning and ready to end the call right away, she heard a voice on the other end that she didn't recognize.

""Hi there, is this Ms. Arabelle Greyle?""

Arabelle paused for a second. ""Yes, this is her.""

The caller replied politely, ""Ms. Greyle, Mr. Chantler has had too much to drink. Could you come pick him up? We're at...""

Benjamin was never the type to go overboard with drinking. Given his status, not many would even think about pushing him to drink more.

""So how did he end up drunk?""

Arabelle didn't really question why the waiter called her. She just replied in a distant voice, ""Sorry, but I can't come right now. Please get in touch with his fiancée to pick him up.""

As soon as she hung up, she heard the waiter on the other end gasp in shock.

""Mr. Chantler! Mr. Chantler, what's wrong? Mr. Chantler!""

The call ended abruptly.

Arabelle's expression changed instantly, and panic washed over her like a wave. Before she could fully wrap her head around what was going on, her body had already taken off toward the second floor.

She burst into the private room and shouted anxiously, ""Benjamin!""

When the door to the private room swung open, Benjamin was slouched in his chair, looking all dark and moody. His right hand was covered in blood, bright red and shiny.

Broken glass was scattered all over the table and around his feet.

The waiter stood nearby, fidgeting with worry on his face.

But Benjamin seemed completely unfazed, like he wasn't even the one hurt.

When he heard her voice, he turned to look at her, his eyes deep and shadowy.

His voice came out rough, with a hint of something almost like grievance.

""Didn't you say you weren't coming?""

Chapter 4

Arabelle let out a quiet sigh. ""Let me take care of your wound first.""

Benjamin didn't say yes or no.

He was acting a bit strange. As Arabelle got closer, she caught a strong smell of alcohol on him and figured he must have been pretty drunk.

He probably forgot that she wasn't his secretary anymore.

The waiter, looking relieved, quickly went to fetch the restaurant's first-aid kit.

Having been by Benjamin's side for years, Arabelle had made it a point to learn quite a bit about first aid for all sorts of unexpected situations, so she knew what she was doing.

She leaned in closer and when she saw his palm—a messy mix of blood and flesh—her brows knitted together instinctively.

""It might sting a little, just hang in there.""

""Okay.""

Arabelle carefully pulled out the pieces of glass stuck in his palm, put some medicine on the cut, and then, almost like she was calming a child, instinctively leaned down and blew gently on it.

The man sitting at the head of the table watched her gentle profile with focus, his throat gulped.

When she finished wrapping his hand neatly, she tied a small, careful bow to hold it all together.

She looked up at him with a smile. ""Mr. Chantler, all done with the bandaging...""

But before she could finish her sentence, Benjamin suddenly reached out with his good hand, grabbed her jaw, and leaned down to kiss her.

His kiss was hot and intense, full of emotions that were hard to explain.

Arabelle's eyes went wide, and she stared at him in shock.

In the next second, she didn't think twice before shoving at his chest with both hands.

But it was her who ended up losing her balance and falling to the floor. Her gaze stayed locked on him, filled with panic.

""Benjamin...""

He looked down at her, his voice rough. ""Arabelle, you know... you don't have to go.""

A sudden sharp pain shot through her chest.

He had pushed her away just yesterday, and now he was saying she could stay?

Just a moment ago, he even told someone else that she was just a toy for him to play with.

She could see the desire in his eyes clearly, which only made this whole situation feel totally absurd and ridiculous.

""Benjamin, we're done. You said so yourself.

""If you keep hanging onto me like this... I might start thinking you've actually fallen for me.""

Benjamin's pupils shrank suddenly, and the emotions in his eyes vanished right away, turning icy cold.

Out of nowhere, a phone rang.

Arabelle glanced over and saw Adelina's name pop up on the screen.

She raised her voice a bit. ""Mr. Chantler, your fiancée is trying to reach you.""

Benjamin looked down at the phone screen, his face going completely stone-cold.

""Get out.""

Arabelle quickly got up from the floor and rushed out of the private room.

As soon as she stepped through the door, she heard what sounded like a phone being smashed behind her. She hesitated for just a moment but didn't look back and just kept walking straight ahead.

Outside the restaurant, she quickly flagged down a taxi and hopped in.

As the car pulled away, she caught sight of the driver's unsure glance in the rearview mirror.

Arabelle blankly pulled out a mirror and took a look at herself—only then did she notice that Benjamin's kiss had smudged her lipstick, leaving marks on the corners of her mouth. She looked completely disheveled.

In a daze, she remembered that one time when Benjamin hardly ever stayed over at her place.

The next morning, they got up together to head to work. Arabelle was huddled by the vanity, rushing through her makeup to save some time. It wasn't until she was almost done that she realized Benjamin had been standing right behind her without her even noticing.

Feeling playful, he picked out a tube of lipstick for her and gestured like he wanted to put it on for her.

Worried about being late, Arabelle didn't think twice. She pouted her lips and went along with him as he traced the shape of them.

With two fingers from one hand, he lifted her chin to get her to look up at him. With his other hand, he held the lipstick and carefully applied it to her lips.

Even after he was done putting on the lipstick, he didn't let go of her jaw.

A bit of confusion flickered in her eyes as she met his gaze. She noticed that his expression was serious and intense, and he was looking right at her.

""What's up? Is it not finished yet?""

As soon as she said that, he kissed her, cutting off any further words.

When Benjamin finally pulled back, the lipstick he'd just put on had smudged all over—messy but somehow still sweet and tempting.

Arabelle let out a quick gasp and rushed to fix her swollen lips.

In the same mirror, the guy who caused it all was grinning like he found it hilarious.

As he casually wiped away the red lipstick smudge from the corner of his mouth, he chuckled in a deep voice.

""Weren't you the one who made that pouty face first, asking for a kiss?""

When she finally snapped back to reality, Arabelle looked at her reflection in the mirror—tears were already streaming down her cheeks.

Chapter 5

The next day, as soon as Arabelle woke up, she got a message from an old coworker.

""Arabelle, I found a necklace at your old desk. Do you still want it?""

Her colleague even sent a photo with the message.

Arabelle clicked on the picture and realized it was the birthday gift her mother had given her two years ago—a piece she had always loved.

She figured she must have left it behind in her rush to leave when she quit. So, she quickly made plans to meet her former coworker for lunch.

Arabelle got there early. She just arrived at the restaurant she used to go to during workdays and ordered some food when suddenly, out of nowhere, she spotted Adelina walking over from not too far away.

Gone was the sweet smile that Adelina usually wore. Instead, her face looked cold as she headed straight for Arabelle.

Arabelle couldn't help but frown. ""You...""

Before she could finish her sentence, Adelina suddenly raised her hand and slapped Arabelle hard across the face.

Along with the slap, Adelina shouted at the top of her lungs, ""You bitch! You've already been kicked out of the company. How dare you still try to steal my fiancé!""

The restaurant went completely silent in an instant, and everyone turned to stare at them in shock.

Arabelle was knocked sideways by the force of the slap. When she finally came back to reality, she realized that Adelina was just taking out her anger on her because of what had happened last night.

A sharp, stinging pain shot across her cheek. Around them, whispers quickly spread among the crowd.

""Is this a showdown with a home-wrecker? So dramatic!""

""Good for her! She's so pretty. Why would she want to be someone's mistress?""

""Aren't those Ms. Shelton from the Shelton family and Ms. Greyle, the ex-secretary? I heard Ms. Greyle was Mr. Chantler's girlfriend for years. Now that she's out of favor, the real girlfriend is coming after her. How sad!""

""Sad? What does she even have compared to Adelina? Does she really think she can compete with a Shelton heiress for a guy?""

Arabelle felt her whole body tremble as she locked eyes with Adelina, who looked ready to pounce. She bit down on her lip hard, bent down to grab her bag, and turned to walk away.

But Adelina wasn't having any of it. She looked super smug as she shot back with a cold warning.

""Arabelle, girls like you are everywhere. I could easily grab a bunch of you!

""Don't fool yourself into thinking you're special just because you've been with Benjamin for seven years! Back in the day, you'd just be another servant warming his feet!

""Let me give you a heads-up. Stay out of my way and Benjamin's. If not, I can make sure you're out of the Chantler Group in no time, and I'll also see to it that you can't stick around New York for even one more day!""

Arabelle's face went completely icy. She turned to look straight at Adelina.

""Ms. Shelton, don't worry about me. Benjamin and I haven't been tied together for ages now. I've already agreed to go back home for a blind date since my parents asked me to.

""Instead of coming here to throw threats at me, maybe focus on keeping your man in check and tell him to stop bothering me!""

She casually brought up her plan to leave, but when Adelina heard it, she totally misinterpreted it as Arabelle bragging about how Benjamin had reached out to her first.

Adelina's expression got even worse, a nasty look flashing across her face.

""Going back home for a blind date? Sounds more like you're heading back to pick up some tricks from your mom on how to snag guys!

""I heard your dad got into a car accident and now he can't use one of his legs. What a shame.

""How did your single mom manage to raise you? I bet she had to sell herself just to make ends meet.

""You grew up around that kind of stuff, which is why you think it's okay to go after someone else's fiancé. Like mother, like daughter!""

Adelina's voice was sharp and grating. Arabelle couldn't take it anymore.

""Shut up!""

She grabbed the coffee cup in front of her and splashed it right onto Adelina's face.

Coffee stains were all over Adelina, from her head to her toes. She looked at Arabelle in shock, yelled out loud, and shook with anger.

""Arabelle, how could you splash me like that? You're such a jerk. I won't let you get away with this!""

Arabelle's expression was icy and serious. ""If you keep talking trash, I won't just splash you. I'll hit you too!""

Just as she finished saying that, Benjamin walked in through the restaurant door.

He took one look at what was happening inside and headed straight for them.

Adelina immediately started crying and complained to him. ""Benjamin, I was just having a little chat with her when she threw coffee all over me.""

Arabelle's face turned bright red with rage. ""You were the one who insulted my family first—

Before she could finish her sentence, Benjamin grabbed a glass of iced water from a passing waiter.

With one quick motion, he poured the iced water right over Arabelle's head.

That cut off whatever else Arabelle wanted to say and completely snuffed out any last bit of affection she had for him in that moment.

Chapter 6

The cold water dripped down from her hair and soaked into her clothes, making her shiver.

Her hair stuck to her face, and the wet fabric of her outfit showed the outline of her underwear. She looked like a total mess.

Benjamin stared into Arabelle's eyes, which were filled with tears but she was holding back how she really felt.

""Just apologize to Adelina.""

That was always Benjamin's way.

He didn't care about what was right or wrong. He just wanted to protect whoever he chose.

After a moment of surprise, Adelina next to them quickly put on a smug look. She shot a challenging glare at Arabelle, waiting for an apology.

Arabelle spoke in a daze. ""What if... I don't?""

Benjamin's face was cold and hard. ""If you mess with my fiancée, I'll make sure you can never stay in New York again. And good luck trying to use that card of yours.""

Arabelle let out a bitter laugh.

They all thought she was with him for the money. They figured she couldn't bear to leave behind the glitz of this big city and would hang on no matter how tough it got. But they had no clue that she stuck around here just because of him.

And about that money...

Her hands shook as she dug into her bag. She pulled out the card Benjamin had given her once and set it down on the table.

""Here's your money back.

""I'm not sticking around in New York anymore.

""Anyway, I'm heading back to my hometown soon for a blind date.""

When Benjamin heard the words ""blind date,"" his eyes widened in shock.

Arabelle turned around and started to walk away. But just a couple of steps in, everything went dark for her, and she stumbled forward, nearly falling over.

In her ears, she could faintly hear Benjamin's worried voice.

""Arabelle!""

When Arabelle came to again, she found herself in a hospital room.

Benjamin was sitting by her bedside, his gaze as deep and cold as an icy lake, filled with mixed emotions as he stared at her.

As soon as he noticed she was awake, he tossed a medical report right at her.

Arabelle picked up the report, feeling totally confused, but her face went pale as soon as she saw ""6 weeks pregnant"" printed on it.

Lately, she hadn't been hungry at all, and her period was late.

She thought it was just some hormonal stuff from stress and didn't really think much of it. Never in a million years did she imagine... that it would turn out to be a pregnancy.

Next to her, Benjamin's voice was icy and sarcastic, filled with anger like he felt tricked.

""Arabelle, I thought you were at least somewhat decent. I never expected you to be bolder than anyone else, keeping something this huge from me behind my back.""

He leaned in closer to look at her, his sharp gaze putting a lot of pressure on her, and there was a smirk on his lips that dripped with sarcasm.

""Are you really going back for a blind date... or are you secretly planning to have my baby?""

Arabelle clutched the medical report in her hand, feeling completely helpless no matter what she said, ""I just found out too...""

She went quiet as soon as those words slipped out.

The cold sarcasm in Benjamin's eyes made it clear. He didn't buy it.

He stood tall and looked down at her pale face, his presence looming over her.

""Arabelle, my child can only come from my wife.

""Any kid carried by another woman is just an unwanted mistake that shouldn't even be here.

""I've set up the abortion for tomorrow.""

With that, he turned and walked out of the room without looking back.

She had never really had a choice.

Arabelle stared blankly at his disappearing figure, tears blurring her vision.

She curled up tight around herself and buried under the quilt, sobbing hard.

After Benjamin left, probably worried that she might try to escape, he had two bodyguards posted at the door.

When Arabelle followed the nurse for her pre-op checks, those bodyguards were right there with her every step of the way.

Arabelle stayed up all night.

The next day, while waiting for the abortion, she got a bunch of videos from Adelina on her phone.

Arabelle took a quick look and realized they were clips from Adelina and Benjamin's engagement ceremony.

Benjamin was in a black suit, looking tall and sharp, giving off a gentle and classy vibe.

A slight smile was on his face as he wrapped his arm around Adelina, accepting congratulations from guests one after another.

Adelina's face lit up with a big smile as she snuggled in his arms, stealing affectionate glances at him every now and then.

Just then, a young nurse knocked on the door to remind her.

""Ms. Greyle, it's almost time for your surgery.""

Arabelle put down her phone and nodded slowly.

""Okay.""

Not too far away in a fancy banquet hall, he was grinning like it was springtime while getting engaged to someone else. Meanwhile, she found herself in the cold, quiet hospital being led into the operating room.

With a heavy heart, she spread her legs and let the cold scalpel cut through the last connection they had left.

An hour later, Arabelle was rolled out of the operating room, her face as pale as a ghost.

She lightly touched her flat stomach. There was nothing there to feel, but it felt like something really painful, something that had sunk deep into her bones, was being ripped away from her.

Every breath she took sent a jolt of pain through her body.

Back in her ward, she changed into her own clothes and headed straight for the hospital exit.

The bodyguards raised their hands to stop her.

Arabelle said calmly, ""Benjamin told you to keep an eye on me because he thought I might try to run away before the surgery. Now that your job is done, you can go back and report.""

The two bodyguards exchanged glances and then called Benjamin. But it was Adelina who picked up the phone.

Her voice dripped with annoyance, ""Why are you talking about her right now? This is so irritating, just let her go.""

After leaving the hospital, Arabelle headed straight home.

She handed over the apartment to the buyer, grabbed her packed luggage from earlier that morning, and made a beeline for the airport.

Her old colleague, who had tricked her into going to that restaurant, sent an apologetic text.

""I'm really sorry. Adelina forced me into it.""

Arabelle didn't hold it against her but chose not to reply. She just tapped to block and delete the contact.

She did the same for Adelina, who kept sending videos of the engagement ceremony just to get under her skin.

Finally, she blocked Benjamin too. Ever since she added him as a contact, she just couldn't bring herself to delete any of his messages, no matter how many times she switched phones.

As soon as the plane took off, Arabelle let a faint smile creep onto her face.

""Benjamin, you saved my dad's life, and now I've given one back to you. From here on out, I don't owe you anything.

""Goodbye... and hopefully, never again.""

How many grams of coffee should I put in the portafilter for a single espresso shot? Also when should I turn the knob to stop the shot? I want to stop it once the espresso has fully extracted and before it turns watery. I prefer a darker shot so I can add frothed milk for a cup of cappuccino.

It's going great. My bosses seem to like me.

I work fully remote from Canada for an American firm. I am technically a contractor and I am paid a fixed amount monthly plus a monthly bonus based on conversion performance (I am a marketer). 

They have been very cagey to discuss ""working hours"" with me (there's nothing about it in my contract). Since I am basically responsible for all marketing/PR/community stuff, I understand that I will sometimes need to work weird hours or respond to a crisis at 11pm; all that they've made clear to me is that ""there are no working hours"" and that ""this isn't a 9 to 5"".

Yes, I know how that sounds. I am aware of what I am getting into, particularly as a contractor— I read the contract very carefully and decided to take it. I need the work and the experience. And the job and compensation is great for someone at my experience level.

Anyways! For the last few days I've been logging on around 9 and logging off around 5. No one has seemed to take an issue with this so far. My guess is that they just didn't want to write any hours in black and white so that I can't point to the contract and refuse if they ask me to get on a call with Japan at 10 at night or push out some social media posts on Saturday. It doesn't seem like they actually want me to work a 9-9-6 week. They seem much more interested in my availability, my deliverables, and (eventually) my impressions/conversion rates.

All that being said: how should I time my lunch and coffee breaks? It feels like I'm sort of taking them for a ride of I were to take a leisurely 75 minute European-style lunch, but at the same time I am not being paid by the hours anymore so I don't have to run out the clock to exactly 1:00 PM every single time in order to keep my quarter-hour of work.

The fact that I am remote and international (and not on the same time zone as 2/3 of my bosses) adds another layer of complexity. I don't *need* supervision to be productive per se, but at the same time I worry that if I start a bad habit of excessive coffee breaks or whatever the issue will compound and my productivity may decrease.

I have 3 big pieces of furniture: a sofa (96"" x 36""), a a 72” x 40” dining room table (with a 24” extension leaf which we need to leave room for in case I need to extend the table...but usually the table is not extended), and a swivel chair. My living room measures 21'9"" x 13'8"" with a 36"" archway entry along one of the 21'9"" wall (this wall also has built-ins above which is our mounted 55"" TV). The window along the 13'8"" wall is 96"".

A couple things I don't like about the current layout: (1) the couch is off-center from the painters molding and the artwork (but is centered with the tv). If I center the couch with the painters molding it is too close to the dining room table. (2) when the table is fully extended, it leaves little room for the entry way. (3) the room seems visually crowded when looking into the Livingroom from the entry way.

Chat-GPT says to put the dining room table in front of the window, but it seems weird to have to walk across the living room to get to the dining room table.

hey! so i'm 19F been struggling with disordered eating since like middle school but last year it got the worst it has ever been and i got to my lowest weight ever and at the end of the year ended up involuntarily hospitalized for about 3 months & diagnosed w anorexia.

so it was in march i believe when i got discharged from the ward and i did okay for a while and about maintained my weight but then during summer i gained some additional weight ""on my own"" (to a number i swore last year i would ""never ever let myself get to again...) and then made the mistake of weighing myself and... yeah i think you'll be able to just guess the rest 🥲

so during the past few months i feel like i've been slowly slipping into a relapse. i've lost a bit but not a rapid amount... yet. occasionally also binging/overeating and then afterwards often punishing myself in some way like hurting myself or going for a run quite literally in the middle of the night.

i held up somehow until just these past few weeks or maybe like this past month (november) idk. BUT then the universe just gave me a big ""fuck you"" i guess because my nurse from the outpatient clinic who i usually meet weekly for support has now been gone for weeks (the clinic has called/texted me many times giving me a date when she'll be back at work but so far every time she's not actually been back and then i've been given a new date of when she should be back so i'm guessing she got sick/injured or something like that). and on top of that i think it was like last week when i also ran out of my anxiety meds because my psychiatrist had forgot to renew the prescription and now i've been fighting with the clinic to get the prescription renewed because apparently by psychiatrist didn't even reckon me asking for a renew (i 100% did i remember we talked about it) and i still don't have the meds.

so anyways everything that has happened these past months (this time of the year is also kind of a traumatic season for me i just realized since for some reason almost all the shit that has ever happened to me has happened during the later half of the year) and then not really having anyone to talk to i guess just kind of has slowly kept pushing me more and more into a relapse. and idk last week i guess something in my brain just snapped and now i think i've gone the longest time i ever have without any food (so basically ""fasting"" as i've only drank zero/close to zero calorie liquids like water, coffee, diet soda, energy drinks) and now i'm starting to be a bit scared to even eat again...

***(NOW WE GET TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION lol sorry)*** rationally i know i need to get some calories in me sooner or later but i'm scared i'll end up overeating/binging or get refeeding syndrome when eating again after not eating for many days OR (this one is probably more or less just an ed thought but still) gain weight even if i still ate on a deficit... but i've now also been weighing myself every morning during this ""fast"" and the number dropping has already become lowkey addicting and i don't want it to stop 🥲

SOOO i was thinking would a nutritional supplement drink like nutridrink for example (the ones they give you inpatient and can also get from pharmacies) be a good solution in this situation? with them i wouldn't at least be scared of overeating/binging, they're liquid and i know the exact calories.

and when it comes to refeeding syndrome i know it's rare yes and i didn't even get it when i was inpatient but back then i never fasted for long periods of time at once like when i was admitted i had maybe fasted for around 48h when i first ate/drank something in the hospital. so is there any risks now that i've fasted for longer?

phew okay i'm so sorry for all the rambling but THANK YOU so much if you read it all or even if you read the main questions and can give some answers ❤️",2,1764180056.0,EatingDisorders,1,1.0,False
1p7eo50,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1p7eo50/green_tea_advice/,Green Tea advice,"Hello,
I'm a longtime French press coffee drinker who's recently discovered how easy it is to make a good cup of tea. When I learned about gongfu brewing, I was fascinated by the idea of rebrewing the same leaves multiple times—something I can't do with coffee.
Up until now, I've mostly made gunpowder green tea western-style using a basket in a coffee mug, and I've also enjoyed oolong tea bags.
I recently ordered the green tea loose-leaf sampler from Yunnan Sourcing (US) and have been experimenting with a gaiwan. While I can see the potential, the green teas are coming out just OK—most seem to lack flavor. None have captured that smoky quality with a touch of bitterness that I loved in the cheaper gunpowder green tea.
There are many variables at play here. It could be that I simply don't prefer loose-leaf green tea, or I might be making a brewing mistake. Any insight or tips would be greatly appreciated.
Could it be that I just prefer the cheaper stuff?
I'm pretty sure I have hard water, though even with filtered water, the tea still tastes somewhat weak. I've tried longer steeping times—around 30 seconds for the first infusion. I've noticed I generally prefer the second and third infusions, but none have quite hit the mark yet.
I'm using 6-7 grams of tea for 100-150 ml of water.
As a coffee drinker, I've read that puer might suit my taste better. I plan to explore that eventually, as it seems like finding the right one will be a longer personal journey. For now, I'm focusing on green and oolong teas as a starting point. Thanks!",2,1764180039.0,tea,1,1.0,False

But I'd certainly have done it differently, and do things to really appeal to superfans as well as the casual listeners.

This actually goes hand in hand as part of an alternate history project I and some others have been doing for a while, set in a time/universe where Kurt Cobain doesn't commit suicide, doesn't even try heroin, and all the massive effects it has on pop culture as a whole:

[https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/cobain-continues-redone-a-kurt-cobain-survives-timeline.424961/](https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/cobain-continues-redone-a-kurt-cobain-survives-timeline.424961/)

The only part that matters so much for you all is that it has some wonderful effects on The Beatles, namely a world where the Friar Park incident doesn't unfold, so George is never stabbed and thus never has another round of cancer, so he's still Living in the Material World with us. Also, Linda decides not to risk breast cancer, and pulls an Angelina Jolie decades before Angelina herself (and with no evidence, only vibes), so she's still living as well, and she and Paul are still happy together. 

In this particular world, things definitely unfold for the better for the fans in the 21st century, with how Apple handles releasing archival material, so that each album has a 50th anniversary super deluxe edition, the individual Beatles' solo albums are all subject to that treatment (even Ringo's, yes), lots of live material, especially from their solo careers, is unearthed, Get Back's 17-hour director's cut gets released on Blu-ray, and, yes, George is part of completing ""Now And Then"" when the time is finally right.

This all leads into how Anthology 2025 is handled, and as you can imagine, it's an even bigger experience. It goes as follows:

\-A reprint of the 2000 coffee table book still occurs, given a lot of people don't have the original.

\-The version being released on streaming now is actually a new TV broadcast cut, for a new version to air on ABC, 30 years after the original six-hour version. It's also permanently available on the library of video content on ABC's website.

\-The streaming and Blu-ray release is not just longer than that version, but exponentially so. Peter Jackson is involved in thus helping craft and edit a 12-episode version for streaming and Blu-ray, with each episode somewhere between 70 minutes and two hours in length, and making the '90s ""Threetles"" bits a lengthy documentary in and of itself. Even though it contains all the material from the VHS/DVD release, bits from the workprint cut, and additional material not in either version, it does have some degree of ""improved flow."" The idea of having songs alternate between playing in the foreground and in the background to commentary is a worthy one that has been made, and thus to get more interview in. But still, a lot of songs will end up there, more than before, and clearances granted for a lot more non-Beatles stuff.

\-The unauthorized Anthology Revisited podcast that a lot of you have heard of is the basis for a companion podcast officially sanction by Apple. This podcast would be for the hardest of the hardcore fans, 20 episodes long, up to 40-42 hours of audio content, and including not just interview material from the seven original interview subjects (and taken from a variety of different media sources over the decades), but also friends, family, exes, spouses, and musical peers. In short, literally everyone gets to have their say about The Beatles, to make a definitive audio history.

\-A massively expanded Anthology collection, expanded not just to 4 double albums, but 6. Like our reality, the original 3 albums are the same, the same tracklist and all, but the additional 3 albums would be a revelation in their own right. Yes, some of the material would overlap with the 50th anniversary box sets, but there would be still a lot of unreleased stuff. Such as all the stuff from the ""Free As A Bird"" and ""Real Love"" maxi-singles, some of the material from the Anthology documentary, ""Helter Skelter (Take 3)"" in its entirety, a lot of the Twickenham material for Get Back/Let It Be, more of the rock and roll jams from the Apple Studios, material that doesn't end up in the super deluxe sets. (Regarding ""Carnival of Light,"" I don't think that would make it in at all. Only shot for it, and it's a definite longshot, would be to revive Zapple as an imprint for decidedly uncommercial, un-Beatles-y stuff, and probably also have a one-day free download link.)

\-Like our reality, the set ends with the remixes of ""Free As A Bird"" and ""Real Love,"" and ""Now And Then."" The Anthology 6 set would also include John's original demos for each song.

\-A maxi-single EP of the three reunion songs is also made, which includes the original mixes of the first two, the 2015 mixes, and the new mixes. (Regarding ""Real Love"" and the complaints people have, that mix would be a rough version or ""2025 Mix A"", and it would be on the EP, along with a more polished and finished ""2025 Mix B,"" which is more to people's liking and how they imagine they wanted the mix to sound like, especially regarding George's guitar fills.)",0,1764179922.0,beatles,0,0.33,False

1p7eeap,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1p7eeap/why_stillness_feels_unbearable_the_dopamine/,Why stillness feels unbearable: the dopamine rebound effect and how to train your brain to chill,"Ever notice how just *doing nothing* feels almost painful? Like silence is too loud, and boredom burns a hole in your brain? You’re not broken. Your brain is just overstimulated. We live in a world wired for constant hits of dopamine(scrolling, swiping, refreshing) and stillness feels like withdrawal.  

Here’s the wild part: most people blame themselves for being “lazy” or “unfocused” when they can’t sit still or meditate. But it’s not a discipline problem. It’s a nervous system problem. This post pulls together the best insights from neuroscience books, Stanford researchers, behavioral psychologists, and digital wellness experts. No fluff, no TikTok pseudo-science.  

It’s not your fault your baseline feels restless. But it *is* your responsibility to understand the mechanics and retrain your brain. Here’s what actually works, backed by science.

**1. Understand the dopamine cycle (and why silence feels painful)**  
Dr. Anna Lembke at Stanford explains this in her book *Dopamine Nation*: every time you scroll, snack, or binge Netflix, you're creating a dopamine spike. Your brain *compensates* by tilting toward a dopamine deficit afterward. That’s the “pain” you feel when you stop. It’s real. It’s measurable. The more highs you chase, the harder the comedown. Stillness feels unbearable because your brain thinks it’s being punished.

**2. Use ""dopamine fasting"" to reset your baseline**  
This was popularized (and misused) by Silicon Valley folks, but the research is legit. Dr. Cameron Sepah coined the term and suggests intentionally taking breaks from behaviors that overstimulate dopamine: social media, video games, processed sugar. The goal isn’t to suffer, it’s to let your brain recalibrate. Even one tech-free afternoon a week can help your nervous system chill.

**3. Train stillness like a muscle, not a mood**  
Calm isn’t something you wait to “feel.” It’s something you build. Neuroscientist Dr. Judson Brewer (author of *Unwinding Anxiety*) shows consistent mindfulness, especially through body-based practices like breathwork or walking meditation that shrinks the part of your brain that fuels overthinking. Daily micro-practices work better than occasional long meditations.

**4. Rewire your reward system by noticing small pleasures**  
The Harvard-affiliated Greater Good Science Center found that people who *intentionally savor* small joys (like light through the window or warm coffee) activate dopamine in gentle, sustainable ways. You don’t need a new iPhone or a Europe trip to feel “alive.” You just need to give your brain new cues for what counts as rewarding.

**5. Move first, rest second**  
Sitting still after being overstimulated feels like slamming on the brakes at 80 mph. Instead, use what Dr. Andrew Huberman calls “physiological sighs” and exercise-induced dopamine (walk, stretch, cold shower) *before* you drop into stillness. Physical movement reduces agitation and gives your brain a new state to settle into.

**6. Make boredom your training ground**  
Boredom isn’t a bug. It’s a feature. According to a 2022 study in *Nature Communications*,boredom signals opportunity for creativity and deeper thinking. But most people avoid it like it’s death. Try replacing scrolling with 15 minutes of staring out the window or journaling. You'll hate it at first. Then you'll crave it.

**7. Set “anchor rituals” to cue calm**  
James Clear, author of *Atomic Habits*, suggests pairing calming habits with existing routines. Light a candle when you journal. Stretch before brushing teeth. Over time, your brain begins to anticipate calm instead of chaos. Rituals anchor nervous systems. They also create tiny pockets of peace that stack up over time.

**8. Stop chasing calm like a goal**  
This is hard to hear: Calm isn’t a place you arrive. It’s not another dopamine hit. If you try to “achieve” peace, your brain will treat calm like a task. Instead, treat it like a practice. Zen teacher Jon Kabat-Zinn puts it best, “You can’t stop the waves, but you can learn to surf.”

This isn’t about becoming a monk. It’s about learning to sit with discomfort without reaching for a screen, a snack, or a hit. Stillness isn’t absence. It’s presence without the noise.

I'm a 31-year old woman looking to make some authentic, easygoing friendships - the kind where hanging out feels natural and conversation can literally be about everything or nothing at all and it still feels comfortable.

I recently got out of a long-term relationship and while I have a small, solid group of girlfriends, many of them are moving away, having kids, or in serious relationships. I miss having a gal pal to hang with on weekends, whether it's bopping around new neighbourhoods, having movie nights, going out for dinner and drinks or even running errands with (becoming an errand friend is truly the goal here!)

A little about me: I am literally exactly like every other girl and personally, I think that's a great thing because why wouldn't I want to be? I'm definitely an extroverted introvert - I enjoy a good night out, but it's capped at once a week (or two) for me. The rest of the time, I'm way more into low-key hangs: movie nights with takeout, a workout class and grabbing brunch/coffee, a casual dinner, checking out the Christmas markets, games nights, going for a walk with my dog etc. I also love taking weekend trips away to cute airbnbs so bonus points if that’s something you’d be into as well!

I love getting to know people on a deeper level - that doesn't mean I expect to have deep conversations every time we hang out, I actually love talking about nothing sometimes but I really appreciate people who don't feel the need to put up a front and don’t think certain topics are off-limits. Tell me that you're so sad and you've been crying all day instead of saying you’re okay or tell me about the time you got food poisoning and were in the bathroom for 24 hours straight - it won’t phase me I promise!

I'm located in Downtown so hoping to find some people that are not super far away so it doesn't become a mission every time we do try to hang out.

I'm not specifically looking for single girlfriends, but it would be nice to meet people that are typically free on weekends.

THE SKY THAT LEARNED HIS NAME


¤¤¤¤¤



Lorne Park waited under a sky that had forgotten how to be ordinary.

It hung low over the neighborhood like a great turning page, winter-heavy, inked with the last breath of a dying year.

The kind of sky that remembers more than it reveals, the kind that leans in close when a teenager with a quiet destiny steps beneath it.

It was New Year’s Eve, the threshold night, when clouds carry old stories in their bellies, when air tastes like iron and evergreen, when time itself gathers its loose ends like a scribe preparing the next chapter.

Kai walked the familiar streets with his hands in his pockets, hood half up, breath rising in small, deliberate puffs.

The streetlights hummed their low amber hymn, warming themselves against the cold, their glow bending almost imperceptibly toward him as he passed, as if recognizing something ancient in the shape of his shadow.

Above him, the sky opened into its strange evening theatre.

Clouds unfurled like children painting without supervision, wide, luminous, unruly, streaked with gold, bruised blue in December’s private violet. 

They moved in soft choreography, the kind that follows instinct rather than instruction.

They shifted when he shifted.

Parted when he lifted his gaze.

Thickened when his thoughts grew heavier.

He did not see.

He had never learned to see his own gravity.

His power had been with him since before breath, since the moment his mother’s first cry opened a chamber inside her ribs and the Archive pulsed awake, laying its signature across the lineage that would one day become him.

Kai thought winter skies simply acted this way. 

He thought brilliance was just atmosphere. 

He thought light was just light.

He walked toward the house where Mike, Sequoia, and Aspen waited, laughter and music already rising like faint, warm smoke from its windows.

The neighborhood roads curved beneath him like something pleased he'd remember them.

Each streetlamp he passed warmed a shade deeper, touched with gold that wasn’t there a moment before.

He didn’t notice.

No boy does at seventeen.

He only felt the year settling into his bones, dense, reflective, expectant. 

The air around him vibrated with the hush before midnight, the hush before becoming.

And deeper still, beneath breath and pulse, he felt the old rhythm stirring:

Thirty days.

The ritual approaches.

Not fear. 

Not anticipation. 

Just rightness.

A cycle older than memory, older than name, older than the idea of teenagers keeping time with anything but themselves.

He couldn’t remember when he began holding back. 

Couldn’t remember the first month he obeyed the pull.

Couldn’t remember the decision.

Because it had never been a decision.

It had simply come. 

And stayed.

A quiet intuition. 

A pull at the base of the spine. 

A truth that felt pre-written.

Each month his body asked him to gather, to sharpen, to wait, not abstinence, not denial, but preparation. 

Refinement. 

Rendering.

Something in him honed itself when he held his own fire.

Something brightened. 

His emotions steadied. 

His instincts clarified. 

His dreams came through like lanterns rising from a lake.

When he held back, something else stepped forward.

But it wasn’t just preparation.

It was training.

Subtle, precise. 

Designed not for denial but for mastery.

What Kai carried could rewrite DNA, crack reality like thin ice, bleed timelines like spilt ink.

People stumbling through time by accident every day. 

He could erase it, erase men, or whole decades, if he wasn’t careful.

So he learned control.

Elegance. 

Restraint. 

Poise.

The ritual wasn’t just about holding fire. 

It was about knowing where to aim it, and when.

He kept walking, breath syncing unconsciously with the distant hum of Lake Ontario. 

His thoughts lifted and drifted like mist, the entire year rising inside him in soft, forgiving vapors.

They always offered to pick him up. 

Always tried to drag him into car rides, transit plans, shortcuts through cold.

But Kai preferred the walk.

 In every season.

 Especially now.

There was something about winter that let the world exhale.

Let it admit its age. 

The bare trees, the sharp air, the way snow made even the ugliest lawn look like a shrine.

The walk talked to him. 

Not with words, but with silence that had learned how to speak.

And today it was saying: endings.

The ending of the year. 

The ending of who he had been twelve months ago. 

The ending of certain illusions he had carried like shields.

He thought of Sade, her laughter like sunlight through amber, her touch like someone trying to remember something through skin.

He had cared for her.

But when he realized it was the pleasure he craved, not the person, something in him stepped back.

He couldn’t pretend after that.

Desire without soul felt like stealing from himself.

So he let it go.

People called that healing. 

But healing never felt like healing.

People who think healing is beautiful have never broken a leg. 

You don’t dance through recovery. 

You sit. 
You wait. 
You ache. 

You become limited. 
You become still.

And in that stillness, you change.

The bone takes six to twelve weeks. 

Sometimes longer. 

And if you rush it, it doesn’t heal, it warps.

Kai thought hearts were the same.

They needed time without weight. 

Time without pressure. 

Time to reshape.

He wondered if that’s why so many people end up in the same hurt twice.

Because they didn’t trust their hearts enough to let them be still.

He glanced down at the sidewalk. 

Frost had traced faint silver hieroglyphs along the edges.

He didn’t know what they said.

But they felt honest.

And that was enough for now.



¤¤¤¤¤


The Year That Folded Itself


¤¤¤¤¤


It surprised him how much had changed.

Not loudly. 

Not theatrically.

But in the deep chambers of his being, subtle shifts, quiet turnings, the opening of inner hinges.

His friendships had sharpened as well.

Mike moved like someone who could hear danger before it chose a direction. 

Sequoia listened with the poise of someone reading sound the way monks read scripture.

Aspen carried a new gravity beneath his swagger, shadow braided with fire in ways he could not yet name.

Kai didn’t claim credit for any of it.

But the world had been rearranging itself around him for years, quiet adjustments, gentle corrections, like someone tidying a room while the inhabitant slept.

He hadn't brought these friends together without meaning to.

He didn’t remember the small invitations, the seat exchanges, the nudges that turned strangers into anchors. 

He didn’t recall the tiny moments where timelines brushed, sparked, fused.

But they had.

Because he had.

A part of him far beneath thought was rearranging molecules and momentum.

Not could, not might, was.

Kai was living code.

A vessel of braided ancestry:

The Archive whispering through his mother.

The northern bloodline sleeping in his marrow.

The Indigenous root holding the oldest earth-note in this land.

And something deeper than depth, waiting.

Each time he breathed near them, the world obliged.

Timelines softened. 

Old hurts loosened. 

Memory corrected itself without ceremony.

His friends felt chosen.

They were.

Chosen by him. 

Chosen by the part of him that was older than language.

He didn’t see that. 

He only felt the strange sweetness of the winter breeze, the way the clouds gathered as if waiting for a show, the way the light shifted to meet him like a familiar.

He turned onto Birchwood Drive.

Someone’s Christmas lights flickered uncertainly, bowing slightly in his direction.

A dog barked once, then quieted, ears lowered in recognition of a king who had not yet learned the word for himself.

Kai didn’t notice.

He was thinking of the year folding itself closed, about the ache of change, about how something inside him felt braced for a door he couldn’t yet see.

And in that ache, something else stirred, a presence he could sense only in flashes, like warmth through a coffee cup or light remembered by the skin before the eyes.

Someone out there, unseen, unnamed, already lived in the softest part of him.

He felt ridiculous for it.

Embarrassed, even. 

Cherishing a feeling he couldn’t hold, loving an echo he had never touched.

But the truth rose anyway: 

He adored what he did not yet know.

And the wanting...

God, the wanting was beautiful.

He opened that feeling only in tiny intervals, just long enough to taste its fire, just long enough to let it fill him without breaking him. 

Then he’d close it again, careful, reverent, because even that brief warmth could feed him for months.

Somewhere behind that ache lived knowing.

Not the kind that announces itself. 

Not prophecy. 

But the quiet certainty that this ache mattered. 

That the ritual, and what it was bringing, had not arrived randomly. 

That he had said yes to something a long time ago.

Not in contract. 

But in cadence.

And this time, this season, he had come to the edge of it deliberately. 

His restraint was not to overwrite what was rising. 

It was to complement it. 

To call it forward without trying to own it. 

To meet what could not be domesticated with equal elegance, not control.

He knew, on a level deeper than language, that what waited was vast. 

A force he could only meet if he stood whole. 

And he would.

The year had folded itself. 

So that he could open.




¤¤¤¤¤



The Body That Remembers Before Memory


¤¤¤¤¤


His chest warmed.

Not with heat, but with ignition. 

A slow burn beneath the ribs, ancient and exact.

Sometimes it came after showering. 

Sometimes after waking from dreams that vanished on contact with morning light. 

And sometimes, like now, in the quiet of a winter walk where the world pulled close and held its breath.

He pressed his thumb to his sternum, feeling the faint thrum beneath. 

A signal older than bone, older than land.

He didn’t know its source. 

He didn’t know it belonged to something submerged, hunted, exalted. 

Something that had lived in ocean trenches and palace shadows. 

Something that had survived the collapse of empires beneath the sea.

He didn’t know his father had walked the earth 1500 years before touching his mother’s wrist in a grocery store aisle. 

He didn’t know his father had been born of the inconceivable union of two Mern Houses:

Blade and Pillar. 

Royalty and Power. 

Elegance and Strength.

A union believed impossible. 

A union that opened a door no one had seen in a thousand tides. 

A union that created something beyond the Mern, beyond the deep rule:

A Lantis.

Kai didn’t know his father carried a legacy capable of moving oceans. 

Didn’t know he had been hunted.

Didn’t know he had been revered.

Didn’t know he had stayed hidden until the Archive called his name.

Kai didn’t know any of this.

But the ember beneath his ribs did. 

It hummed. 

Steady. 

Ancient. 

Loyal.

He turned onto Cloverbrook Court, where frost coated lawns like careful blessings. 

Above him, clouds slid aside, revealing a strip of raw winter sky, the kind that looks straight through you. 

He kept walking.

Kai’s mother had been the first vessel to hold three bloodlines that had never touched before.

The Archive had arranged it like a celestial banquet, a feast that took epochs to prepare. 

Time had cured the ingredients.

History had decanted the memory.

And when the moment was right, when breath, body, blood, and world aligned, the Archive poured it forward. 

Not into war. 

Not into empire. 

But into a woman with a quiet heart and a son who would carry more than anyone before him.

The Mern titled TRISTAN, that was the spark. 

The catalyst. 

He arrived like a whisper through stone, a shadow from the ocean’s dreaming edge, a being who belonged to myth but had wandered into love.

He had the kind of build people turned their heads for, and then kept turning, not out of lust, but reverence. 

Tall, cut from the same geometry as old gods and Olympic dreams, his body looked like it could swim from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and he could.

He had. 

More than once.

His shoulders held storms. 

His thighs carried migrations.
 
His back was made for battle and shelter alike.

Eyes like polished emeralds, green not of grass but of deep seaweed catching light. 

Hair cropped short at the sides, sun-touched blond, but the top, a reckless shock of red like flame and copper had made a pact.

He was dazzling. 

Dashing. 

Older than he looked. 

Much older.

He had lived lifetimes in silence and swim, in diplomacy and war, in the halls of coral cities and the wreckage of drowned empires.

And when she met him, Kai’s mother, he was at the end of his walk with legs. 

The sea had begun to call again.

Not gently.

For the Mern, the Ocean does not ask. 

It demands. 

It summons back what it lent to land. 

And if it is not obeyed, it takes.

She knew it. 

Felt it in the way his breath caught during sunsets, in the way he stared too long at the lake, in the silence that came when the tide rose high.

But he loved her. 

And for a time, they tried to trick the tides. 

They made dinner. 

Made love. 

Made a child.

A brief rebellion against water and lineage. 

Their mornings were soft. 

Their laughter real.

He would hum songs older than rivers while she brewed coffee, and she would rest her head on his chest as if that moment could last forever.

But oceans have long memories.

And his summons came. 

Not in a letter. 

Not in a sound. 

But in his bones. 

A pressure. 

A pull. 

A promise not made to her, but to everything he was.

She held his face the night before he left. 

Didn’t cry. 

Didn’t beg.

“I know what you are,” she whispered. 

“And I love what you gave me.”

He kissed her once, long, sure, like someone memorizing land before letting go. 

And then he walked toward the water and did not return.

But something stayed. 

In her. 

Growing. 

Listening. 

Waiting to bloom.

A boy. 

A legacy. 

A myth reassembled into flesh.

Kai.

She never told Tristan, not even herself, that loving a man who had already spent five centuries on land carved a grief so precise, so exquisite in its truth, that it left a shadow inside her.

Not illness as humans name it.

Not punishment. 

Not fate.

Something older. 

A mythic wound. 

The kind that appears only when love reaches beyond its mortal span.

Her heart had known, the ocean would not give Tristan back again until long after she herself had returned to ash.

And that knowing, that impossible ache, left a quiet mark inside her, a seed the Archive did not choose and could not prevent.

For the Archive governs memory.

Not longing. 

Not heartbreak. 

Not the places where love tears through a mortal body because it recognizes something immortal and reaches anyway.

It was the cost. 

The price of loving a man the sea would reclaim.

And one day, the shadow that love left in her would take her from Kai long before the world was ready.

Together, they created what no one, not even the gods, had predicted: 

An unknown. 

A convergence of memory and mutation. 

A lattice so impossibly rare it could only exist once.

A being not of brute force, but of intricate infinite, power so refined, so deeply balanced, it could fracture reality if not mastered.

He was the answer to a question no one knew they were asking.

The kind of power the world thinks of as large, but in truth, it was subtle.

Delicate, like the tiny intrinsic muscles of the hand, the ones never named in myth, but without which no sword could be held, no poem could be written, no lover’s skin gently touched.

That was the secret. 

The power to shatter lay not in the fire, but in the grip.

And Kai was learning, moment by moment, how to hold what needed to be mastered.

With every generation, the blessing grew.

So did the price.

As sure as day follows night, as surely as yin curls itself around yang, power never arrived alone.

It drew eyes.

Then words.

Then swords.

Each blessing laid like gold into the blood did not only brighten the soul, it cast longer shadows.

With every layering, the gift amplified.

And so did the curse.

Not punishment.

Not wrath.

But law, ancient, elemental.

For what burns too brightly in this world begins to bend the laws around it, distorting the small minds who’d rather snuff flame than be warmed by its truth.

Each generation fought not only the limitations of their time, but the unseen toll of power misunderstood.

Fear is fertile ground.

And fear, when left unchallenged, becomes doctrine.

Becomes war.

Kai’s inheritance was not only rare.

It was unsheltered.

And the Archive knew:

if the world was ever to end by fire not of volcano, not of war, but of spirit, it would be him.

He was the match.

The spark.

The floodgate.

The miracle and the myth of it, braided into one being.

And the curse that followed?

It was not that he would destroy the world.

But that when the time came,
he might be the only one who could decide not to.






¤¤¤¤¤


The Quiet Rearranging of Souls


¤¤¤¤¤



The nearer he drew to the house, the more the air sharpened.

As if it recognized what awaited.

As if the world were preparing its stage for the four of them to gather again.

He didn’t know Mike’s ancestry traced back to assassins and river-wisdom keepers. 

He didn’t know Sequoia descended from women who could command tempests with their voice.

He didn’t know Aspen’s blood carried the echoes of a deadly incubus. 

He didn’t know the Archive had their names long before their births.

He didn’t know he had been nudging their spirits awake.

He didn’t know his presence had been unspooling their ancestral muscle.

He didn’t know he had been turning their stories right-side-up.

To him, they were just his people.

But he had become the hinge of their timelines.

Quietly.

Gently.

Without permission.

Without awareness.

He didn’t know that what was about to happen wasn’t spontaneous, it had been curated with sacred care across lifetimes. 

The Archive had waited for alignment, for the night when breath, blood, readiness, and memory would braid.

He didn’t know that his soul had already said yes, not out loud, but in the marrow, in the ancient language of consent given through breath and time.

And he didn’t know that everything he’d held back, every moment of restraint, every second of ritual, had tuned his being to meet what could not be tamed. 

Not to conquer it. 

Not to suppress it. 

But to match it. 

To answer it without fear.

And he didn’t know.



¤¤¤¤¤


The House With Its Own Pulse


¤¤¤¤¤

He reached the house as the sky thinned into long silver veils.

Warm lights trembled along the porch railing like small, obedient stars.

Shadows moved behind curtains.

Music thumped inside the walls, alive and young and already mythic.

Kai paused at the bottom of the steps.

Not to think.

To listen.

That pause came before moments that mattered.

Before alignment.

Before recognition.

Before threads pulled tight.

The night felt dense.

Alive.

Expectant.

He breathed once more:

Deep.

Slow.

Aligned.

Whatever waited inside, he would meet it with a full heart, a full breath, a body tuned by a month of holding and sharpening.

His ritual was at its edge.

There was a pressure tonight.

Low.

Thick.

Undeniable.

Not arousal, not yet.

But presence.

Mass.

His cock hung proud with a kind of quiet ache, the weight of it straining against fabric, alive.

As if his body knew it was time.

He wasn’t hard.

But there was fullness, ancient, ceremonial.

The kind of drag between the thighs that reminded him his bloodline wasn’t built for moderation.

His balls throbbed faintly, like stones heated in a firepit, pulsing their readiness.

Not to conquer.

To be poured.

It was always like this, on the  night of the ritual, but this time, it carried a new gravity.

Like whatever he held was not just for him.

Like the ache itself was a summoning.

He could feel it then, not just want, but lineage.

The perfect fusion of Blade and Pillar rising in him, neither side louder, both present.

Precision braided with power.

Legacy brushing off its sleep.

Every ancestor he carried dusting themselves off in the chambers of his blood, as if they too had been waiting for this hour, to stand behind him, within him.

He adjusted himself discreetly in the dark.

Perhaps walking had been a mistake.

Perhaps being alone with the sky on a night like this was never safe.

He could feel it pooling low in his pelvis, dense, magnetic, alive.

And like muscle memory, like breath learned in another life, he was already circulating it.

Not just energy.

Not just chi.

But blood.

Endorphins.

The quiet chemistry of ache and promise.

It moved up from his root like a slow flame, threading through marrow and breath, until tiny celestial bursts lit his skin, ecstasy flickering like static stars.

He buzzed beneath his flesh.

Not restless.

Ready.

Like a caged tiger pacing the perimeter of something it had always been meant to enter.

His friends were inside.

The sky was still watching.

Somewhere beneath thought, beneath breath, beneath even the Archive’s most ancient vellum, Kai understood.

This wasn’t random.

What was coming had always been part of the design, threaded through time like gold stitched into mourning cloth.

Essential.

Precise.

Irrevocable.

And already agreed to.

Not in contract.

But in cadence.

His ritual had brought him to the edge deliberately, not to conquer, not to overwrite, but to temper something vast, beautiful, and impossible to domesticate.

What he held back wasn’t meant to cage it.

It was meant to meet it.

Equal force.

Equal fire.

He wasn’t there to subdue the wild.

He was there to have it bow to him without breaking.

And somewhere inside that vow, there was no doubt, he wanted this.

He had always wanted this.

Even if the want had no name yet, his body had been preparing for it since before he knew what he was preparing for.

The season had stripped him clean.

The ritual had made him ready.

And what came next would not be survived, it would be answered.

Kai climbed the steps, touched the cold metal handle, and opened the door.

And the night, obedient, ancient, and aware, changed its shape to let him in.

I was looking deeply and rather contemplatively at the trees that lined the park opposite my house. They were just your basic, everyday trees, laden with clusters of yellow flowers. But the more I stared at them, the more beautiful they appeared to me. The intricate veiny patterns of the leaves, the many bird nests punctuating the branches, and the birds themselves chirping and feeding their chicks were a sight to adore.

I was mesmerized. What seemed to be ordinary trees were full of life and beauty. And then it hit me - true beauty lies in the ordinary, simple things life has to offer us. Life isn't a movie; it's not extraordinary. It's rather boring, but that's where the essence of life truly lies - if only we are brave enough to look up from our screens in this fast-paced world and start noticing what's around us.",1,1764179252.0,WriteStreakEN,1,1.0,False

My name is Lars and me and my team created the worlds first electric Titanium Cup.

The key benefit is simple. It is completely odorless.
And yes it even mixes your drinks. Coffee protein shakes matcha whatever you throw in there. Nothing sticks and nothing smells.

Why
Because Titanium doesn’t absorb molecules the way plastic and steel do. It doesn’t trap flavor or bacteria inside tiny pores. So you can use it for coffee in the morning and a protein shake in the afternoon and it still smells like nothing at all. Every time.

So instead of having a different cup for coffee, a different shaker for protein and a different mug for matcha you can just get one cup that does everything and lasts a lifetime.

1p7e8oe,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1p7e8oe/25m_introvert_looking_for_dating_advice/,25M introvert looking for dating advice,"So I will start from the beginning, I have been liking this girl from my work i have been seeing her for sometime One day i gathered the courage and went to her and gave myself an intro and just asked the general stuff and she was asking the same (cuz i had asked and she did it out of courtesy) After that i was having general chats with her everyday atleast once ,

nothing much just the usual “Hi , Bye , had lunch ? , busy day ? “ and all those

This was going on for 2 weeks

And after that i gathered the courage and asked her on a coffee date not too far just in the food court below our office She said she was okay and we can go in the evening !

I was genuinely excited and surprised that she accepted so easily I was eagerly waiting for that time to come all day And when fateful time came

First i will tell from my POV what happened

I went out and looked in her place she was not there waited for some time and asked her friend if she had left for the day and she said yeah ,

After that my mind went into overdrive mode and i started thinking that if she had planned it like this from the beginning or something

So with little hope of what i had , i thought maybe she was waiting for me in the food court and went there searched but of no use

But after that i know shouldnt have done this but i took her number from our office whatsapp group and gave a call hoping she was waiting somehwere

She picked up the call and  i was like “I am so and so , i have been waiting here , did you leave for the day or something ? “

Her reply was “yes yes bro it got late and i had left for the day “

I was shattered after this And thought alot of negative things

But after an hour or so i a got a call from her

This is where i got to know what happened from her POV

She seemed to have looking for me in which “she thought was my place” which was not ( i was sitting there helping a friend ) and thought i had left for the day

And she left as well and when i called her , she thought i was someone else hence she said “bro”

After getting to know this i first apologised for getting her number from the office group and all

And we had the call for like 10-15 mins where i got to know she is someone  who is getting famous on Instagram she currently has 2.5k followers and she is currently doing some acting gigs

I paid no mind to these details

after this we started having convo in whatsapp it was mostly kind of late off reply convo where i was asking something and she will reply after 4 or 6 hours and i will ask something again and the cycle continues

But lately i didnt share about her Instagram status to anyone but lately a lot of people have been talking with her ,

Maybe this is my insecurities kicking in but i have started to think “maybe i am not so special to her and if anyone had done what i have done till now she would reacted the same way, i am just one among many for her”

whatsapp convo have been monotonous i ask skmething abiut her and she replies for that, thats it

So what can i do to make her notice me , i genuinely don’t know what to do anymore, what can i do to make her feel i am special in her eyes ? Can anyone help me here

I’m 65. I’ve survived a stroke, a hate crime, a pandemic, and more battles than anything I faced behind that café counter. But nothing prepared me for the moment when I realized this simple truth:

Starbucks doesn’t have a safety policy — they have a sales policy disguised as one.

And I was fired for violating it.

When an older person gets hired at a café—

ON THE SURFACE
It looks like a good thing—connection, purpose, routine, survival… hope.

IN REALITY

This isn’t an entry-level job. It’s an exit-level job — the last rites of dignity.

For young workers, these jobs are stepping stones, a training ground, a few dollars to spend on impulses.

For an older worker, it’s a gauntlet—a competition with youth—and the dollars aren’t extras; they’re the difference between housing and homelessness.

Being old in an entry-level job is like emigrating to a new country with a rucksack full of experience, only to discover that none of it counts. Younger workers sometimes ask, silently or aloud: Why are the olds taking our jobs?

But everybody can’t drive a cab or deliver food when their credentials say “Lawyer” and “Doctor.”

And if management turns the older hire into a punchline — “Guess how old the new guy is?” — the job becomes not work, but endurance.

Young workers complain about the learning curve.

There is no curve.

There is much to remember, sure, but the curve is a flat line.

And if toxicity leads to termination, a better word is execution.

Harsh? Maybe.

But a corporation usually only grants one “exception.”

If that exception doesn’t survive, none will.

That’s why protecting older workers is vital — because failing to do so isn’t just firing someone. It’s sentencing them.

Let’s be clear about what happened.

On October 10, a repeat offender walked into our café, escalating toward harm. It was me, three young women, and a handful of customers. I read the situation, acted instinctively, and did what every valuable worker does: I kept people safe. A customer thanked me.

Twelve days later, I was interrogated for twenty minutes by a district manager who seemed more interested in proving I’d done something wrong than understanding what actually happened. Eight days later, I was fired.

For a non-incident.

For safety.

For doing what their “connection” marketing campaigns pretend to care about.

This is not about coffee.

This is about humanity.

This is about a corporation whose policies are a quiet war on poverty, addiction, and mental health — a war carried out through denial of washrooms, denial of water, and scripts designed not to protect workers, but to protect liability.

Starbucks trains workers to handle “angry customers,” not people in crisis. Because “angry customers” can be redirected toward a purchase. People in crisis can’t.

So, the policy becomes:

If someone can’t buy something, they become a problem.

And anyone who treats them like a human being becomes a liability.

I see it clearly because I lived it.

I wasn’t fired for what happened on October 10.

I was fired for everything that happened before it.

• For being older.
• For having lived experience.
• For not participating in infantilizing small talk.
• For connecting with 500 customers a day with ease.
• For being respected by young workers who confided in me more than they ever would in management.
• For seeing the cultural rot beneath the surface.
• For refusing to accept disrespect disguised as “coaching.”
• For surviving in a system that expected me to break.
• For documenting the truth.

I was a threat — not to customers, but to the corporate storyline.

Because if Starbucks admits I handled the incident correctly, then they must confess their policy doesn’t work.

And if the policy doesn’t work, then the company is responsible.

And if the company is responsible, they lose control of the narrative.

So, they did what corporations do:

They erased the anomaly instead of the problem.

Why does this matter?

Because what happened to me is happening everywhere — quietly, endlessly, to workers with fewer words, fewer witnesses, fewer ways to fight back.

Corporate America has replaced community with branding, leadership with compliance, and compassion with liability management. Workers aren’t protected. They’re positioned.

I acted like a human being.

And the corporation punished me for it.

This story isn’t about one incident.

It’s about the cost of telling the truth in a place where truth threatens the structure.

I’m sharing my experience because no one should lose their job for keeping people safe—no 20-year-old, no 65-year-old, no one in between.

We must be the voice.

Because if we stay silent, the corporations win.

And humanity loses.

Every day, I walked in smiling, connecting, and doing the work that actually keeps a café alive. And yet, when it mattered, the company put on blinders, ignored reality, and fired me.

How are you finding romantic relationships in the workplace in the UK?

I had an experience recently that’s left me feeling really embarrassed. I started a new job and I honestly thought one of my coworkers was into me. I got so excited about it.

But I think I totally misread it. She would always come over to me, start conversations, be really friendly. Then when I tried to take a small step closer to her - as in trying to see her outside work (we’re both women), it felt like she suddenly pulled back. Now we basically don’t talk at all. Like, literally nothing. In the coffee break room it’s just “hi, you alright?” and that’s the whole conversation.

I feel embarrassed and like I just can’t read her at all.

British women are so hard to read, especially in a queer situation.

nothing much just the usual “Hi , Bye , had lunch ? , busy day ? “ and all those

This was going on for 2 weeks

And after that i gathered the courage and asked her on a coffee date not too far just in the food court below our office She said she was okay and we can go in the evening !

I was genuinely excited and surprised that she accepted so easily I was eagerly waiting for that time to come all day And when fateful time came

First i will tell from my POV what happened

I went out and looked in her place she was not there waited for some time and asked her friend if she had left for the day and she said yeah ,

After that my mind went into overdrive mode and i started thinking that if she had planned it like this from the beginning or something

So with little hope of what i had , i thought maybe she was waiting for me in the food court and went there searched but of no use

But after that i know shouldnt have done this but i took her number from our office whatsapp group and gave a call hoping she was waiting somehwere

She picked up the call and  i was like “I am so and so , i have been waiting here , did you leave for the day or something ? “

Her reply was “yes yes bro it got late and i had left for the day “

I was shattered after this And thought alot of negative things

But after an hour or so i a got a call from her

This is where i got to know what happened from her POV

She seemed to have looking for me in which “she thought was my place” which was not ( i was sitting there helping a friend ) and thought i had left for the day

And she left as well and when i called her , she thought i was someone else hence she said “bro”

After getting to know this i first apologised for getting her number from the office group and all

And we had the call for like 10-15 mins where i got to know she is someone  who is getting famous on Instagram she currently has 2.5k followers and she is currently doing some acting gigs

I paid no mind to these details

after this we started having convo in whatsapp it was mostly kind of late off reply convo where i was asking something and she will reply after 4 or 6 hours and i will ask something again and the cycle continues

But lately i didnt share about her Instagram status to anyone but lately a lot of people have been talking with her ,

Maybe this is my insecurities kicking in but i have started to think “maybe i am not so special to her and if anyone had done what i have done till now she would reacted the same way, i am just one among many for her”

whatsapp convo have been monotonous i ask skmething abiut her and she replies for that, thats it

So what can i do to make her notice me , i genuinely don’t know what to do anymore, what can i do to make her feel i am special in her eyes ? Can anyone help me here

I currently use a TNF Surge but I have grown to kind of hate it because the straps are very uncomfortable on my shoulders when fully loaded and the bag refuses to sit upright on its own.

My usual carry should include a 15"" MBA, steam deck, charging cables/brick, power bank, pens, wallet, one 32+oz water bottle, one coffee mug, stethoscope, clothes etc. I would also like this backpack to double as a personal item type situation for short trips on planes and have good space to dump clothes in if need be.

Requirements:

1) Must have 2 places to put bottles, I almost always carry my own coffee with me to work and always have a water bottle

2) Must be able to stand up on its own without support, though I don't necessarily want it to have a rigid frame, just a structure that lets it sit without tipping, my TNF has a sharp edge on the bottom of the laptop compartment which precludes it from standing upright

3) Needs to have a good amount of organization pockets/places to put things since I dont use a ""tech organizer pouch"". Admin panel type situation would be nice.

4) Clamshell opening main compartment

5) super well padded traps, TNF has basically no padding on the surge. 

6) Some kind of ""outside pocket"" where I can dump and grab snacks easily

7) ""professional styling""

8) not a dealbreaker but it would be nice if there was also some storage available on the straps themselves 

I've been comparing the Aer City Pack Pro 2 to the Able Carry Max EDC, however the latter I think does not have 2 spots for bottle storage and I think Able Carry doesn't really run black Friday deals.

I've also looked at the limitless by Graphene-X but that one is a bit overkill for my tastes.

Meanwhile, November 24th is World Evolution Day, celebrated because a paper was published that changed scientific thinking completely. On November 24, 1859, Charles Darwin published his work: _On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection_; an account of the greatest story ever told — that of evolution by natural selection. Here is the story.

_During the Darwin family’s 1868 holiday in her Isle of Wight cottage, Julia Margaret Cameron took portraits showing the bushy beard Darwin grew between 1862 and 1866._

Charles Darwin was a naturalist, geologist and biologist, who was born on February 12, 1809, in Shropshire, England. He belonged to a freethinking, intellectual family; his father Robert was a doctor and his grandfather [Erasmus Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_Darwin) in addition to being a doctor, was also a key thinker of the British enlightenment. His maternal grandfather was Josiah Wedgewood, founder of the famous [Wedgwood ceramic company](https://www.wedgwood.com/en-gb/welcometowedgwood/the-wedgwood-story?srsltid=AfmBOopkWL0o9Npuw_e3nGMjwhaJJI5Vy4pbGm2kPpFLsnmtCrwyT4oD). Darwin’s mother died when he was only eight years old.

In 1825, he became an apprentice doctor for his father and then went on to medical school at the University of Edinburgh. However, Darwin found the lectures boring and he neglected his studies. Instead, in his second year, he joined the Plinian Society, a natural history group of students from the University. His father was not pleased with him neglecting his studies and packed him off to Christ’s College, Cambridge for a BA, so that he could become a country parson. At Cambridge too he was unconcerned with his courses, and became interested in the popular craze of beetle collecting, which he did zealously and even published his findings. Charles Darwin did manage to complete his education; in fact he did quite well in the final examinations. During his remaining time in Cambridge he read voraciously, including books by astronomer John Herschel and those by another brilliant scientist, Alexander von Humboldt. Darwin wanted to contribute to what at that time was known as natural philosophy and made plans to travel to the tropics to study natural history.

![Painting of Charles Darwin](https://360onhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/charles-darwin.jpg)
_Charles Darwin_

Then, his botany professor, Johns Stevens Henslow, of whom he had become a close friend and follower, changed everything when he proposed him as a self funded naturalist aboard the HMS Beagle. The ship was to spend two years charting the coastline of South America. His father objected to this at first but then agreed to fund his trip.

The voyage began in December 1831 and Darwin spent five years on the Beagle, from 1831 to 1836, studying animals in the Galapagos, discovering fossils and observing tribes around Southern America. He kept copious notes of his observations and amassed a collection of specimens, which he often sent off to Cambridge for cataloguing and analysing. He observed seashells in high volcanic rock cliffs in Cape Verde and discovered fossilised bones of huge extinct mammals buried next to seashells in Patagonia.

![Voyage of the Beagle 1831 to 1836](https://360onhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Voyage_of_the_Beagle-1831-to-1836.png)
_Voyage of the Beagle 1831 to 1836_

&nbsp;

On board the Beagle were three natives of Terra del Fuego, which lies between Chile and Argentina. These three people had been captured during the first Beagle voyage and had been educated in England as missionaries. They were now being sent back to convert and “civilise” their tribe. Darwin found them friendly enough but when they reached Terra del Fuego he found the Fuegians there living as what he called “degraded savages”, completely different from those on the Beagle. Then one of the Fuegians on board the ship, who had been given the name Jeremy Button, went back to his old way of life, found a wife and had no desire to return to England. “Civilisation” means different things to different people.

The observations of fossils, geology and local tribes was making him more and more convinced that humans were interlinked with a shared origin and could all become civilised — that contrary to accepted opinion one group was not better than others. In fact, he went further and now saw that there was no unbridgeable gap between humans and animals. In 1835, he experienced an earthquake in Chile, noting that the land had been raised — adding to his knowledge of geological events that shaped the Earth.

Darwin is most popular for his observations on the Galapagos islands, where he spent only five weeks. This is where he observed the differences in finches and tortoises, which he used as part of the basis for his theory. However, he failed to collect tortoise shells as evidence of the differences in islands from where they came, although he did eat tortoise as food.

With his ideas developing, Darwin returned home in October 1836. He was already a celebrity among scientific circles because his former tutor Henslow had given some naturalists his geology paper. With his father’s funding he was able to become what at that time was known as a gentleman scientist and attempted to find experts to catalogue and describe his collections.

![darwin's tree of life evolution](https://360onhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Darwins-tree-of-life.png)
_Darwin’s Tree of Life_

He was then influenced by Malthus’ Essay on Population and just six months after his return to England, was already writing about species changing into others. This is when he sketched his famous branching evolutionary tree over which he wrote “I think”.

He saw similarities between farmers picking the best stock in selective breeding and nature doing the same. All of this led him to develop his theory of evolution via natural selection, but he spent years researching and writing various other scientific papers especially on the Beagle collections. He also spent eight years [studying barnacles](https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/commentary/life-sciences/darwin-and-barnacles/darwin-s-study-cirripedia). So, for almost 15 years his evolution by natural selection stayed in the background, as what he called his “prime hobby”. However, his work helped him to refine his theory, as he became more and more convinced of its scientific merit.

Darwin was an extremely cautious man and had a fear of ridicule and rejection, which led him to keep his ideas hidden because he wanted to gather as much evidence as he could and refine them as much as possible. He only shared them with botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1844, saying that it was “like confessing to a murder”. However, by July of 1844, he had elaborated his ideas into an essay and had frequently shared them with his other friend, geologist Charles Lyell.

Charles Darwin had begun to develop his theory in 1837 and it would take him over 20 years before he would eventually publish it, after Lyell told him of another naturalist, [Alfred Russell Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Russel_Wallace), who had drawn similar conclusions. A little bit of digression here. Alfred Russell Wallace is not as famous as Darwin but it must be emphasised that he reached the same conclusions through his work as a specimen collector in Indonesia and Borneo. In my opinion he deserves equal credit.

Russel had written a letter and once his idea reached Darwin and Lyell, they concluded that it was almost exactly the same. [According to the Darwin Project](https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letters/darwins-life-letters/darwin-letters-1858-1859-origin#:~:text=This%20letter%20led%20to%20the,by%20means%20of%20natural%20selection.): “This letter led to the first announcement of Darwin’s and Wallace’s respective theories of organic change at the Linnean Society of London in July 1858 and prompted the composition and publication, in November 1859, of Darwin’s major treatise&nbsp;_On the origin of species by means of natural selection_.”

That is, initially, the theory of evolution by natural selection was introduced in a letter read at a meeting of the Linnean Society, as a joint publication with Alfred Russell Wallace, in 1858. Remarkably, not much interest was generated. Then on November 24, 1859, Darwin published a detailed explanation of his theory in his best-known work, **[_On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection_](https://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/pdf/1861_OriginNY_F382.pdf)**. Unexpectedly, this time it was extremely popular and the entire stock was oversubscribed when it went to booksellers on November 22, 1859.

![First Page of Darwin's Origin of Species showing title of the book. By Fernando Venzano on Unsplash](https://360onhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Origin-of-Species-Fernando-Venzano-Unsplash.jpg)
_First Page of Darwin’s Origin of Species showing title of the book. By Fernando Venzano on Unsplash_

It did not arouse as much controversy as was expected however. In fact there was a lot of international interest for it, because the concept of evolution had been around for quite a while and had been debated and discussed from the time of the classical Greeks. The age of enlightenment and Britain’s maritime successes had led to new biological discoveries and various evolutionary ideas were constantly being proposed. Therefore, there was a gradual, growing acceptance for it among the public and scientists.

However, this was still a time when the scientific community was closely tied to the Church and there were debates on Darwin’s theory, because even though he had refrained from discussing human origins (only hinting at it), there was much discussion on what this could mean for human creation. The idea of human origins and their shared ancestry with other primates Darwin put forth in Descent of Man published in 1871.

In 1860, Bishop Samuel Wilberforce (known as Soapy Sam) and Thomas Henry Huxley (known as Darwin’s Bulldog for his vociferous defense and promotion of the theory of evolution), took part in a famous debate. Soapy Sam implied that Darwin’s idea promoted humans being descended from monkeys, by inquiring of Huxley whether he considered himself to be descended from monkeys from his grandfather’s or his grandmother’s side. To which Huxley retorted that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his gifts.

Which brings us to the idea of evolution itself as it was expounded in&nbsp;_On the Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection_. The book introduced the scientific theory that living populations evolve over generations through natural selection. It proposed that the diversity of life that we see on the planet arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. What this means is that evolution occurs when natural selection (which includes sexual selection), results in certain characteristics becoming either more common or rare in a given population. The way Darwin explained this simple but powerful concept is that individuals best adapted to their environments, are more likely to survive and reproduce. If there is variation between them and that variation is heritable, this will result in a selection of individuals with the most advantageous variations. The heritability of variations and the reproductive success of individuals will result in a particular population progressively evolving. And here is the kicker: populations that evolve to be sufficiently different, eventually become different species. All the evidence that Darwin collected on his voyage on the Beagle and subsequent research, experimentation and correspondence with other scientists was included in the book.

Although he understood heritability, he did not know about the science of genetics (something that Austrian biologist [Gregor Mendel [1822 to 1884]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel) had been working on, initially with pea plants), so could not say how the given characteristics were passed on. When genetics became more and more understood and the structure of the DNA was revealed in the mid-20th century, evolution was confirmed as the only scientific explanation for the diversity of life on Earth. As our knowledge of genes gets better and better, more information is added on but the basics remain the same. We now understand that variability within and among species can be due to mutations (change in the DNA sequence of a cell), gene flow (the movement of genes into or out of a population**)** and genetic recombination (exchange of&nbsp;genetic material&nbsp;between different&nbsp;organisms which leads to production of offspring with combinations of traits that differ from those found in either parent). Mechanisms such as natural selection (the process through which populations of living organisms adapt and change), gene migrations (any movement of individuals, and/or the genetic material they carry, from one population to another) and genetic drift (random fluctuations in the frequency of a particular version of a gene (allele) in a population) act on this variability, so that characteristics are either passed on, or they disappear.

Darwin’s idea has withstood the test of time, experimentation and evidence for over a century and a half. There is no doubt now that evolution is the unifying theory of life sciences and is the only one that explains the diversity of life on this planet.

Let’s be clear on one thing. Darwin did NOT say that we are descended from monkeys, as Soapy Sam had implied. This idea has persisted over the years and is frequently bandied about by those who do not understand evolution. What he had established is that all species have descended from common ancestors; that the branching patterns of evolution were a result of natural selection, where species struggle for existence and pass on characteristics, similar to the effect of artificial selection in domestic breeding.

He also did not initially use the phrase “survival of the fittest”; it was coined by the philosopher Herbert Spencer, who extended evolution into the realms of society and ethics. Darwin did use the phrase in the republication of On the Origin of Species in 1869, to mean that nature favours the best adapted individuals, not necessarily the strongest.

Charles Darwin spent the last decade or so of his life finalising his book on worms, which he had been studying on-and-off for 40 years. In his personal life he had married his cousin Emma and had ten children, two of whom died in infancy. Another child Annie died at the age of ten. He was very devoted to his children and this can be seen from the doodles and cartoons they left on the draft of On the Origin of Species manuscript.

Darwin died on April 19, 1882, at his family home, Down House, in Kent and is buried at Westminster Abbey. He has left behind a body of work so immensely beautiful, it still continues to inspire to this day. More than 120 species and nine genera of animals and plants have been named after him.

Here is how he ended&nbsp;_On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection_: “There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on, according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning, endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.”

What a story!

1p7e3ny,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1p7e3ny/aio_because_im_feeling_worried_about_moving/,AIO because I’m feeling worried about moving closer to my in-laws,"I recently got married and my partner and I are currently buying a house. It’s not in my most favorite area but the house is beautiful and it’s truly good bang for buck in this economy. Younger me would have never dreamed about having a detached home as my first home. 

I am used to living in the city so this will be a bit of a shift for me - moving the suburbs. But there are nice gyms, coffee shops and libraries around, I mainly wfh and it’s still not the quietest neighbourhood thankfully. I like a bit of hustle and bustle personally. Most importantly, I think the house is a great investment. 

The only thing that is scaring me is that we will be moving 12-15 mins from my in-laws. Thus far, I’ve kept a rather formal relationship with them. I’m somewhat comfortable with my partner’s sisters-  they’re around the same age. His parent’s do ask us to come around and be around often, so we try to do family dinners once a week. But that’s totally normal given that they want to see us and mainly, their son. 

But deep down, some part of me feels worried. Even though I’m happy and this is a big new step in life and I’m not being subjected to live with them, I do want boundaries. Tbh, I don’t even know what it exactly is that I’m afraid of moving closer to his family. Sometimes I feel a little unfair because my parents don’t live close to us and maybe that’s what makes swallowing this a little more difficult. I guess any advice on what to expect and how things might change would help me brace myself. I am someone who prefers to have personal time, or time to do my own thing. I also love having weekends with my partner where we both do nothing and just chill at home. Maybe some part of me feels like that is going to go away now. I just don’t know what to expect. But I also do think I might be overthinking it as everyone is busy with their own lives. I wouldn’t appreciate anyone coming over unannounced but I feel like that is just common sense, but it’s these hypotheticals I’m worried about. ",2,1764178765.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False
1p7e38k,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingAfterTwenty/comments/1p7e38k/25m_looking_for_dating_advice/,25M looking for dating advice,"So I will start from the beginning, I have been liking this girl from my work i have been seeing her for sometime One day i gathered the courage and went to her and gave myself an intro and just asked the general stuff and she was asking the same (cuz i had asked and she did it out of courtesy) After that i was having general chats with her everyday atleast once ,

nothing much just the usual “Hi , Bye , had lunch ? , busy day ? “ and all those

This was going on for 2 weeks

And after that i gathered the courage and asked her on a coffee date not too far just in the food court below our office She said she was okay and we can go in the evening !

I was genuinely excited and surprised that she accepted so easily I was eagerly waiting for that time to come all day And when fateful time came

First i will tell from my POV what happened

I went out and looked in her place she was not there waited for some time and asked her friend if she had left for the day and she said yeah ,

After that my mind went into overdrive mode and i started thinking that if she had planned it like this from the beginning or something

So with little hope of what i had , i thought maybe she was waiting for me in the food court and went there searched but of no use

But after that i know shouldnt have done this but i took her number from our office whatsapp group and gave a call hoping she was waiting somehwere

She picked up the call and  i was like “I am so and so , i have been waiting here , did you leave for the day or something ? “

Her reply was “yes yes bro it got late and i had left for the day “

I was shattered after this And thought alot of negative things

But after an hour or so i a got a call from her

This is where i got to know what happened from her POV

She seemed to have looking for me in which “she thought was my place” which was not ( i was sitting there helping a friend ) and thought i had left for the day

And she left as well and when i called her , she thought i was someone else hence she said “bro”

After getting to know this i first apologised for getting her number from the office group and all

And we had the call for like 10-15 mins where i got to know she is someone  who is getting famous on Instagram she currently has 2.5k followers and she is currently doing some acting gigs

I paid no mind to these details

after this we started having convo in whatsapp it was mostly kind of late off reply convo where i was asking something and she will reply after 4 or 6 hours and i will ask something again and the cycle continues

But lately i didnt share about her Instagram status to anyone but lately a lot of people have been talking with her ,

Maybe this is my insecurities kicking in but i have started to think “maybe i am not so special to her and if anyone had done what i have done till now she would reacted the same way, i am just one among many for her”

whatsapp convo have been monotonous i ask skmething abiut her and she replies for that, thats it

So what can i do to make her notice me , i genuinely don’t know what to do anymore, what can i do to make her feel i am special in her eyes ? Can anyone help me here

1p7e0hr,https://i.redd.it/pj6r0nej0n3g1.png,Lakefront home - 1700sqft feedback,"Hello, got some really good direction from the last time I posted here, so giving this another try. I actually stole inspiration from another redditor on this one and gave it my own spin. The goal is a 1700-1750sqft plan to keep it budget oriented, so this floorplan needs to be pretty efficient with space. Overall it has everything I want so far but I had some pain points that I am not super sure on right now. 

1. I am pretty uneasy about having to walk through the master bath to get to the closet. I see this as a pretty common design trend on floorplan websites, but have not experienced a layout like this myself. I don't know that there is anything I can do about this without creating a bunch of inside and outside corners, creating a lot of complication to the foundation and roofline; trying to avoid this.

2. The stairway, I don't know, I always struggle with figuring out where to put stairs and it always seems like an afterthought when I'm done. I love the idea of having that little coat closet at the entrance, but it seems like it would be better to flip the steps so I'm not ramming the landing up against the foundation wall. 

3. For the mudroom/garage entry area, I am pretty pleased with how this came out so far, but I feel like I could do something a little extra here, like incorporate a coffee bar on the other side of the closet there. Is this too ambitious? Reducing space in the mudroom to maybe gain a 15"" shelving area for coffee bar/liquor shelf? 

4. Kitchen... Is 3'6"" going to be enough space between the chairs and the wall? Planning on having floor to ceiling windows right there to look out to the water.

Thoughts anyone?

I work 9 to 7, and I sleep 830-330. I cant figure out how to adjust my eating schedule to the night shift. 

When, and what, do you eat? 

My go-to's have been: 

□Meat + veg + light sauce over rice (the meat and veggies change each meal)

□Oikos yogurt 15g protein cups for breakfast with a cup of coffee

□And my dinner consists of egg whites, side of tomatoes, and more coffee and soda. 

Ive also been trying desperately to drink water and lemon water every few hours. 

My coworkers also sometimes makes shift meals, if we're not busy. It varies every day. 

Thank you for your time.

*(Contains scenes of explicit and disturbing imagery.)*



Emma tightened her grip around mine. “We’re not actually going out there, right?”

Mason ran his hands through his hair and took us in, one by one, like he expected somebody else to take charge. 

“Well… I mean, we asked her what happened. She answered. So what do we do now, bail?”

“Yes,” Jodie said. Her words landed without hesitation. “Absolutely, yes. We leave.”

“Wait. What?” I said, “You want us to show up to class on Monday like none of this happened?”

Emma drove her nails into the back of my palm. “Tell me you’re joking, Ty.”

“I’m not.”

I pushed myself upright. Mason rose too, bracing on one knee while he reached for his phone. He tapped the screen, and the glow washed over him. He raised it toward the board, holding it high enough to light the space.

“If Tyler wants to go, I’ll be right behind him.”

“Fine,” Jodie eased back until her heels pressed against a desk leg. “Just leave that thing here.”

“Not a chance,” Mason said. “We can't leave a ouija board sitting on the floor, I don't want the teachers starting a witch hunt on Monday.”

He crouched, slid the planchette into the cardboard box, tucked the whole thing under his arm and paused. “Actually, tell you what.” He moved to the trashcan, lifted the lid, and let the board fall inside. “There. Everyone’s happy. Ready, Ty?”

Mason led us toward the exit in a knot and we held by the door. Jodie checked each of us once, then set her thumb to the latch and pushed.

The door opened with a faint creak that carried into the hall. Tile and shadow stretched out ahead in a long strip. We crossed the threshold together.

“I think she went right,” Jodie said. “Mason, you want to lead the way again?”

“No, but I will.”

The hall split into a clean T shape ahead of us. Both sides sank toward darkness. As we reached the divide, something slid across the edge of my sight, a faint shift where nothing should have been.

“Hold up,” I said. I leaned around the corner, only far enough to see down the cross-hall.

Lena waited at the far end.

No.

Not waited.

Suspended, caught between tile and ceiling, as if the world had forgotten what to do with her. Her feet touched the floor, though they dragged behind her with no real aim. Her head listed toward us. The motion had a hitch in it, as if someone had plucked a string tied to her skull.

She turned from us and drifted away. We followed.

When we reached the corner behind Lena, she had already moved some distance ahead. Her frame found itself outlined in the moonlight and I caught more details in that brief moment than I ever wanted to see. 

The skin on her wrists puffed outward with a dead white stillness. Her nails held a deep blue stain, drained of warmth. Along her neck, faint dark half-circles pressed into the skin, not cuts, not bruises, but small marks that looked like someone had pinched her skin over and over again.

Emma saw them too. “Tyler…”

“I know.”

The trinkets thickened above us as we stepped into the staff hall. Mason lifted one between the edge of his thumb and the corner of his finger and pulled it towards his light. “Can you guys see this? What the hell is written on this thing?” He turned it so the back faced us. 

A year had been pressed into the wood in tiny dark numbers.

2007.

He brushed the next one aside.

2002.

Emma moved closer to the wall. Her attention traced the long run of twine that stretched nearly the length of the corridor. I kept pace beside her. We read each marking as we walked.

1993. 1981. 1968.

The dates grew older as we advanced. Near a stained ceiling tile, one bundle sagged under its own weight. The number etched into it had nearly vanished.

1948.

“Wasn’t that when the school was built?” Jodie asked. 

“I think so,” Emma said

I focused on the old bundle. It held something bloodless caught in the twigs. Not like bone. It carried a softer look, almost like dried skin twisted into a small rose. 

Further down the hall, the linoleum changed under our shoes, the pattern flipping from speckled gray to a sickly tan. The lockers gave way to plain walls with framed awards hung in neat rows. 

Staff photos watched us as we passed. Their eyes caught my light in strange ways. Some frames held harsh black and white, others held dull colors that had sunk toward brown. 

The images marched back through the decades. Faces I recognized. Faces from before my time. Faces belonging to teachers who taught long before any of us were born.

In one print, the old school well stood behind a row of faculty members.

Every face wore a dead grin, the kind you get when the photographer tells you to hold your smile for a second too long. At first nothing struck me as wrong. Another staged staff picture.

Then the wrong part rose into view.

Two swollen hands were clutched onto the outer stones of the well. The skin had the soaked look of something that had been left in the wash, the nails pointed and cracked, shaped like long, chipped picks. Whatever owned them was hiding beneath the rim.

“Mason,” I said. “Come here. Tell me I’m not seeing things.”

Mason raised his light and moved in beside me. “What the hell…” 

His beam slid off the first frame and settled on another photo just below it, farther along the school’s timeline. 

The same well stood in the center, though fewer teachers gathered before it. Each one wore twig charms pinned in neat rows across their jackets. Their expressions caught in a strained place between a welcome and a warning.

At the far edge of the group stood a figure that broke the pattern entirely. At a distance it passed for a tall, lanky student, though the shape refused to settle on anything familiar.

Sacks had been tied around its limbs and torso to suggest clothing, and a burlap bag covered its head, cinched tight where a neck should have rested. The limbs ran too long, the torso drawn too narrow. The sackcloth clung to the form beneath, heavy and wet.

Emma nudged into my side. “What are you looking at?” When her gaze reached the figure in the sackcloth, her eyes froze in place. “Ty… what is that supposed to be?”

“No idea,” I said.

“Down here,” Jodie called. “I think Lena went this way.”

I dragged my focus from the photographs and turned toward the hall ahead. At the far end a single staff door hung open by a lean gap. Warm light pushed through that slim opening and traced a bright stripe across the floor.

“We should really think this through before we go in there,” Emma said. “If a light’s on, someone might be inside and I don’t want to get in trouble.”

My own words escaped before I could pull them back. “Lena brought us here. There has to be a reason for it.”

Jodie stepped forward and sighed. “Tyler’s right. I say we take a look.”

“Guys, I think I made a mistake bringing us here.” Mason shot Emma a look. “I'm sorry, Em.”

“Oh, stop it. You don't get to say that now, Mason.” Jodie said. ""Besides, it's my fault too."" She paused and angled her ear toward the door. “Do you hear that?”

I listened. Beneath the steady hum of the lights, another sound threaded through the dark, a mix of human tones rising and falling together. Something in me gave way, and I moved forward before the others could stop me.

Heat pressed out of that room and slid along the hall. A smell walked with it. Sweet. Bitter. The taste on your tongue when you bite through your own lip. 

With each stride, the crack in the door widened. Bright light crawled out and sank into the floor. The blended voices from inside sharpened. Words pulled free from the hum. Familiar tongues tangled with others I didn’t know.

I reached the threshold and pressed the side of my palm against the doorframe. I drew air in, held it still, and leaned forward just enough to peer inside.

—-------------------- 

For a second my brain refused to sort what I was seeing. It was just color and motion, light on skin, the shine of metal.

Then it snapped into place.

It was the staff workroom. Brown cabinets with peeling laminate. A scorched coffee machine that carried the scent of burnt grounds. A candy bowl. A copier in the corner. Fluorescent lights buzzing overhead.

And in the middle, pushed out like an altar, was a long table. 

They had dragged one of the big desks into the center of the room and cleared it. The surface was covered with plastic tablecloths, the kind I had seen at bake sales. Someone had taped trash bags along the edges so nothing spilled to the floor.

Their backs stayed turned partway toward me, frames pitched forward, heads lowered. Each movement small and careful. A steady stream of talk slipped beneath their work.

I recognized every single one of them. But three faces hurt more than they should have. 

Mrs. Hart stood closest. Her cardigan sleeves were rolled past her wrists. Next to her was Mr. Kline. His loosened tie swung as he worked. Principal Dwyer held the center, standing in place with the same posture he used when he pushed students through a pep rally.

For a foolish beat I thought they were working on pumpkins. Their motions had that sort of rhythm to them. Reach, cut, scoop, sort.

Then Mrs. Hart turned toward a metal cart beside her and reached for something on its surface. As she moved, the shape they worked over slid into view.

The thing on the table, the thing they leaned across, came into full view.

It was Lena.

Not the Lena from the door glass. Not the floating ghost thing that had led us here. This was her body. Her actual body, laid out on the plastic like meat on a butchers block.

Her school shirt had been cut straight down the center and folded aside. Her torso had the waxy tone of old candle wax. The skin sagged over the bones beneath it, and the muscles below hung swollen.

They had already started at her hands.

Her fingers lay splayed on a small cutting board by her side. The nails still had chipped black polish on them. At the base of each finger, someone had made clean cuts, skin folded back like the edges of peeled citrus. 

The first two fingers on her left hand were missing from the knuckle up. Their stumps showed pale bone in a ring of torn flesh. Those two digits sat in a bowl nearby. Tiny pale things, rigid and curled like shrimp that had been boiled and cooled.

“Take care with those,” Mrs. Hart said. “I don’t care about the rest of her body but I need the hair and the bones.”

Mr. Kline reached toward the bowl and studied what lay inside. “Feels strange doing this without her eyes open. She always liked to watch my hands.” 

“She trusted you. Always such a quiet child. I used to wish the whole class was made up of little copies of her. It’s almost a shame she was the one we picked.” 

Dwyer spoke from the center. “It’s not like she gave us much of a choice. She’s been talking with the boy for years now. Did you see that ribbon she left for him? It’s been how long and it's still hanging there? She asked for this.”

“That’s true. I guess she did.” Kline said. “The boy is getting more restless. You remember a few winters ago? The whole grate shook for two days. Nearly cracked the bolts.”

Someone near the table began to section Lena’s hair with scissors. Thick strands slipped over the plastic and gathered in a metal bowl. Clumps clung to the surface with the weight of wet rope. 

One of the assistants gave a small snort. “I bet you love it when he acts up. This is your favorite part of the job, isn't it, Matt?”

Mr. Kline laughed. “I prefer the build up.”

Lena’s right arm had been opened. A clean incision ran from wrist to elbow, drawn back and fixed with clips. A man with bone shears snipped the radius. Small flakes fell into a metal dish and pinged against steel.

On the far side of the table, near Lena’s bare feet, Mrs. Hart worked on something else.

She held a cluster of twigs, a twist of dried bramble, and a lock of Lena’s hair. She wound them together with darkened string. Her fingers moved quick and neat. She tied the bundle off, then picked up a tiny pair of pliers and crimped a shaved piece of bone into the center, like a bead.

She raised the finished charm toward the overhead light, studying it with the same focus she gives student work. Then she set it in a tray beside six others that matched those hung all across the school.

“There we are. Simple enough,” she said. “We’ll be safe for another few seasons. And you know what, Lena? It's all thanks to you. You always tried your best. Even when you were nervous. That’s what I liked about you.”

My legs weakened beneath me. I leaned closer to the doorframe without meaning to.

A dark wet rot slid from the table’s edge. It gathered for a breathless beat, then fell and struck the trash bag with a dull smack. More followed, each drop slower than the last. The air carried the bite of pennies, raw poultry, and floor cleaner.

I jerked when I felt one of Emma's hands rest between my shoulder blades. Her expression found mine long enough for me to read the confusion and rising horror spreading across her face. 

Her mouth shaped a question without a voice.

*What are they doing?*

I didn’t have an answer. I shifted to the side so Jodie and Mason could see.

Mason moved in at my right, his neck arched forward, his mouth slack. *What the fuck?*

Jodie pushed into the narrow gap beneath Emma’s arm. Her sleeve lifted toward her face as she took in the table.

Inside, Mr. Kline lifted up Lena’s foot. It sagged in his grip. Something sickening lived in the way his digits sank into her heel. I remembered that same hand clapping kids on the back in the hallways.

He took a small saw from the cart, the kind my uncle once used on deer legs, and set it against her left calf. The teeth touched, slid, then caught.

He frowned, shifted his hold, and started to cut again.

“You would not believe how much pressure this takes.”

The sound of it was small and rough and somehow louder than anything I had heard in my life. A gritty rasp, bone dust catching in the light above the table. Her ankle shook with each stroke.

Emma’s mouth shaped words again. 

*Stop. Please.*

Terror never arrives the way films promise. There is no violin hit. It comes in stages. First is disbelief. Then nausea. Then something animalistic that just wants out.

“Move back,” I whispered. “We need to leave. Now.”

I pushed away from the frame. My heel struck Emma’s shoe. She wavered, found her balance, and stepped backward with me.

Mason stayed fixed in place.

“Mason,” I said in a low breath. “We’re leaving.”

“We need proof,” he said. His tone carried nothing like dread. It held raw anger.

“What?” I hissed.

He had his phone out, half raised. His hand shook.

“If we leave with nothing they’ll say we made it up,” he said. “This will blow them up. They’ll go to prison. The news will show this on repeat and it'll destroy them. They won’t get to hide this. They won’t get to bury this. We can at least do that much for Lena.”

His gaze burned with the same dark spark he showed when he ranted about rigged games or school gossip. Now that spark flared in the light of Lena’s blood and the sight of her half-dissected body.

“Put it down,” Emma said. “Please, Mason. Please.”

“Just one second,” he said. The phone lifted inch by inch. The small camera lens edged above the frame.

Jodie shifted to give him room.

Her boot caught on a raised wrinkle in the old floor mat. The stumble was small but enough. Her balance slipped. She reached toward the frame, missed it, and struck the tile on her hip with a dull crack. An ugly, sharp thud bounced off the cabinets.

The sound knifed through the room. Through chatter. Through bone and metal. Through everything we had just witnessed.

Inside, the saw stopped mid-stroke.

Every adult turned toward us. Five teachers. People I had known since I was in grade school. Faces I had seen bored, irritated, entertained. Guests in my own home. 

Principal Dwyer met our eyes first. The light caught his face in a way that drained all warmth from it. His lips pulled back from his teeth as he tried to smile. It showed far too much gum.

“Children,” he said. “It's alright.”

Mrs. Hart’s grip clamped around the trinket she had been shaping. A bead of blood pushed out of the twig bundle and dropped onto the tablecloth. “This isn’t what you think it is.”

Kline set his scalpel down with care. He looked at us the way a butcher might look at a side of beef that had walked in on its own. “Just take a breath and let's talk.”

All five stepped away from the table.

“Run,” I said.

I latched onto Emma’s arm and pulled her back from the doorway. Her feet slid across the waxed tile before she caught traction. Jodie scrambled up from the floor. Mason helped her rise and twisted toward the hall.

We burst away from the staff room together, then hit the first intersection and split without talking. Instinct. Panic. Whatever you want to call it.

Jodie and Mason cut left toward the main stairwell. I led Emma to the right.

“Tyler,” she said between breaths.

“We’ll be okay.”

The hallway stretched ahead like a tunnel. Rows of lockers rushed past on both sides. My chest burned and my legs drove forward without thought.

Behind us, the building came alive. Doors burst open. Shoes struck the tile in fast pursuit. More than one pair. More than two.

“Dwyer, take the east side,” someone called. “I’ll cut off the lobby.”

We rounded a corner and nearly collided with a janitor’s cart. The mop bucket sat half full, frothy water clinging to the rim. A stiff rag hung off the metal bar. The sharp sting of bleach punched the air.

A classroom door sat cracked, the room behind it dark. I pushed my side against it and edged it open just wide enough for us to slip through, then drew it back until the latch caught. 

We flattened ourselves against the wall between the door and the coat hooks. I could feel Emma’s heart thunder through her jacket into my arm.

Footsteps came closer. A shadow passed the strip of light at the bottom of the door. Another followed. Keys jangled. Someone drew air with a hard pull, charged more with excitement than exhaustion.

“Check the labs,” a voice said. Kline. “They know the layout. It's Emma, Tyler, Mason and Jodie.”

“They won't get that far,” another voice said. I knew that one too. Hart.

Their footsteps drifted down the hall and weakened into the distance.

I pushed out the air trapped in my chest, a release that felt like surrender. Emma leaned into me, pressing her face into my upper arm.

“We need to get to an exit. When we get outside, somebody will see us. A driver. A neighbor. Anyone.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Yeah, they will.”

I peered through the narrow gap.

The hall looked empty. The glow from the exit sign shone on the bare floor.

“I’ll be with you the whole time. We’ll find a way out,” I said.

We leaned into the hall, took in both directions, then moved toward the stairwell at the end of the wing. That path led straight to the front lobby and the double doors.

Halfway there, running feet struck the tile from the opposite side. Not our echo. Closer.

We dove through the next open doorway by instinct. This one yawned wider, the dark inside deeper. I recognized the posters on the wall. Photos of planets, atoms, and formulas. The science room.

I eased the door nearly shut, left it cracked, and dropped with Emma behind the first row of tables. We crouched there with our backs pressed to the cabinets, our knees drawn in tight.

Footsteps followed. Fast. Lighter than the teachers’. Charged with panic. A small sob cut through them.

“Please,” someone pleaded. “Please stop.”

Jodie.

Emma’s nails pressed into my wrist. “Don’t,” she whispered. I patted her hand and pulled away. I crawled forward until I reached the door window. Through the wired glass I caught a fractured view of the hallway. 

Jodie tore past at an angle, hair sweeping behind her, fleece snapping with her stride. She reached the T-intersection and skidded, turning her head right, then left, searching for a path.

The teachers charged after her.

Hart led the group, sweater sleeves still rolled above her wrists. Kline followed close, drawing air hard through his nose. Two others came after them in a tight cluster.

“Stop, sweetheart,” Hart called. “Jodie, honey, stop. You’ll hurt yourself.” She spoke in the same tone she used in her classroom. Pure and sweet.

Jodie forced out a broken howl and struck the nearest door with both fists. The metal shuddered but held firm. She struck again with more force.

“Help me,” she cried. “Somebody help me.”

They reached her in three long strides. Kline caught her from behind, his hands locking Jodie’s arms against her sides. Hart seized her ankles as she kicked, pulling her legs out straight. The other two closed in without thought.

Together they lowered her to the floor with the care of parents tucking a child into bed.

Emma crouched beside me. Her whole body shuddered. I covered her mouth with my hand. “Don’t look,” I said into her hair. “Please, Em. Don’t watch this.”

She pushed my arm away, tears running across her cheeks. “I need to,” she said. “I have to see what they’re doing to her.”

Hart sat straddling Jodie’s chest, her knees braced against the girl’s upper arms. She smiled down at the child pinned beneath her.

“It’s alright,” Hart murmured. “It’s alright, sweetheart. You’re going to help us. It’ll be okay.”

Kline drew a folding knife from his pocket. A small blade. Nothing dramatic. The sort a man might use to peel an apple. He opened it and brushed the edge with the side of his hand to test its bite.

“Please,” Jodie cried. The plea broke apart as it left her. “I didn’t see anything. I won’t tell anyone. I’ll go home. I swear. I’ll pretend it never happened. Please, Mrs. Hart.”

Mr. Kline knelt beside her and wrapped his hand around her wrist. “I believe you, Jodie.”

Jodie arched her spine, fought with everything she had, but Hart leaned forward and put her weight across the girl’s ribs. Something in Jodie’s shoulder cracked. 

Kline smoothed the back of her hand with the flat of his thumb like he was calming a skittish animal. “Shh. It’s going to be okay. You’re going to be a part of something so special, Jodie.”

Then he cut.

He started at the first knuckle, pulling the skin back with neat, hard tugs. The blade flashed in the hallway light. Blood slicked his fingers. It ran over Jodie’s palm and onto the tile, dark and thick.

Her scream no longer sounded human. It rose, shattered, then climbed again as he worked. Hart murmured nonsense. Little soothing sounds. Small reassuring syllables with no meaning behind them.

The other teachers stood nearby. One held a plastic bowl ready. When Kline freed the first small piece, he dropped it in with a dull clack. Then they did the second. Then the third. He was careful. He did not want to harm anything he meant to take from her. 

Each time the knife bit, Jodie’s legs jerked. All Kline did was slip into a soft tune out while he worked. 

Emma gagged beside me and pressed her face into my chest. I pulled my arm across her back and steadied her while tremors ran through her. Warm tracks spread across my shirt.

“Please stop this,” she said in a faint strain of sound. “Please just stop.”

They took a lock of Jodie’s hair next. Hart seized a full fistful and sawed through it. Loose pieces clung to the blood on her hands. She wound the cut hair around a bundle and cinched it with stained thread.

When they finally went for Jodie’s throat, it was almost an afterthought. Kline pulled the blade across her neck in one practiced sweep. No flourish. No pause.

Jodie’s sobs ended mid-sound. Blood poured out in fast, hot waves and slipped down her chest. Hart leaned back enough to avoid most of the spray, though streaks still marked her cheek and chin. She made no move to wipe them away.

When it was done, they eased her head to the floor. Her eyes stayed open, glassy, pointing at the ceiling tiles. “Let’s get her back to Lena. We can see what dumping a little extra down the well does... It’ll be a good reminder for the boy.”

I turned Emma away from the door. She didn't struggle, instead she folded inward, arms clamped around her stomach, shaking in small jerks.

“We have to move,” I whispered. “They’ll keep looking for us, Em. We can’t be here.”

We stayed hidden until they lifted Jodie’s body. They carried her out, her limp limbs swinging in weak arcs. They took her back toward the staff room. When their steps faded down the hall, we slipped out and moved the opposite way. 

Parts of that run vanished from my memory. Some pieces cut through with force. Others disappeared. I know we hit the main hall harder than we meant to. The door struck the wall and bounced.

Somewhere behind us, someone shouted, “They’re headed for the front.”

We tore toward the end of the hall. The front doors waited there. Big, double, and locked.

“Push bar,” Emma said. “The side exit. It should still let us out.”

We veered straight for it. My lungs felt like they were lined with steel wool. I drove my shoulder into the crash bar. It rattled once and gave way. The door burst open and the night swallowed us whole.

Cold hit like a slap. The yard lay under a fine skin of frost and fresh snow. The football field stretched beyond it, dark and empty beneath a washed-out moon. For an instant the wind filled everything.

Emma clutched my sleeve and pulled. “Ty, over there.”

A shape moved across the open yard. Bent. Jerky. Running at an angle between the frozen picnic tables and benches. A glow flared in one raised arm.

Mason.

He spotted us and raised his arm high. His face lit in fear and relief.

“Ty!” he yelled. “Ty, thank God. I was waiting. I’ve got my car in the lot!”

We sprinted toward him. The three of us cut across the yard from opposite sides, closing in with the frantic pull of creatures trying to form a pack.

Behind Mason, a steel door flung open. More shapes poured into the frost. Teachers. All of them. Their coats swept behind them over clothing streaked with dried blood.

“Faster,” I said. “Come on, Mason, faster.”

He was nearly done. Anyone could see it. His legs dragged, ankle twisting, arms pumping out of rhythm. He had never been fast. He had always been the kid tossing jokes from the bench, not the one sprinting down the field.

We were twenty feet away when they reached him.

Dwyer got to him first. He surged in from the side, a dark blur across the snow, and drove into Mason’s back with the full weight of his shoulder. The impact lifted my friend off his feet. They hit the ground together and frost burst around them in a white cloud.

Mason tried to crawl forward. Dwyer drove a knee into the small of his back and seized his hair, smashing his face into the frozen grass. Snow crystals scattered under the blow.

The others closed in. Hart. Kline. The rest. They formed a ring with clean, confident steps.

Emma skidded to a halt, then lunged forward. I caught her around the waist before she could throw herself into their circle.

“Let go,” she screamed. Her words cracked as she kicked at the ground, trying to tear free. “We can’t leave him.”

“They’ll kill you too,” I said. “They’ll kill both of us.”

“They’re hurting him,” she sobbed and clawed at me with both arms.

I dragged her toward the shadow of the well. Every part of me screamed to go back. To grab a brick, a bottle, anything, and crack skulls until Mason got free. My brain knew better. 

We crouched behind the stone rim, drawing in the stink of old milk and wet earth. Emma leaned against the rock trembling while I watched.

They did not drag Mason back to the halls. They did it there, under the open sky.

Hart knelt beside him. Her palm slid across his hair in a strange comforting motion. Mason twisted and spat. She let the spit run down her cheek and mix with the blood. She smiled at him with all her teeth.

“Brave boy,” she said. “You wanted to be the hero, right? You still can. You get to remind the boy to stay in his hole.”

Kline had the knife again. He didn’t ask anyone to hold the bowl this time. He set it in the frost beside him.

“Fuck you,” Mason yelled. “Fuck you, don’t touch me. Don’t fucking touch me. Don’t you-”

Hart drove his face into the dirt. “Hush.”

They worked at a slower pace with him. Like they wanted every part of him to feel it. Segments from his hand. A clump of hair. A strip from his arm. They cut the tendons behind his ankles. He twitched and then went still from the waist down.

Emma pressed her forehead to her knees. This time she didn’t watch.

In time he begged. Of course he did. Even tough kids beg when they are being taken apart. 

“Please,” he sobbed. “Please, just stop, please, I don’t want to die.”

“Mason, just stop.” Dwyer tilted his head like he didn’t understand the problem. The tone felt almost offended. “Don’t make this harder than this has to be.”

Then he opened Mason’s throat with a single clean slice.

The blood steamed across the frost. They pinned him just like they did with Jodie, keeping control of his body until the shaking ended.

“Once we get what we need, let's just toss the rest of him down the hole. We’re close enough to the well anyway.”

Something inside me broke loose and the edges of my vision blurred.

One teacher stepped from the ring and started toward us. Hart. We pressed ourselves against the well, trying to sink into the stone. The rim dug into my back and locked me in place.

Behind us, the grate shifted.

At first it rattled like an old lid settling into place. Then it heaved upward. A crack sounded from the bars, then another. The ribbon slipped through the bars and fluttered to the ground near my foot.

A swollen hand rose through the hole and forced the metal cap aside. Pale. Swollen. Wrong.

A length of sackcloth followed. Burlap dragged across the grate as the creature lifted its head beneath the sagging bag. The cloth hid every trace of a face. Water trailed in thick lines from the seams and darkened the stone.

Hart froze mid-step.

The creature pushed its upper body higher until its blank shape faced towards her. It leaned forward, close enough that it carried the threat of climbing free.

Hart backed away. Then again. Her chest hitched once before she turned and bolted toward the rest of the staff, her stride unraveling behind her.

The figure waited until the teachers fled. Then it reached toward the ground near my shoe. My entire frame locked. It gathered the fallen ribbon in its grip and sank back into the dark of the well. 

The grate sank into place once more, and the metal shuddered against the rim before settling.

Emma seized my arm. “Run.”

We broke into a sprint. Across the service road. Past the bus barn. Into the dark between the fields. The cold air knifed my lungs raw. I didn’t look back until the school was a small shape on the horizon, a dark block with a few yellow squares. 

Emma fell forward over the ditch by the stop sign and threw up. It came up harsh, mostly bile and the cheap chicken from lunch. I swept her hair back and kept my sight from the mess she made on the dead grass.

“Home,” she said when she could breathe again. “We have to go home.”

“My place,” I said. “It’s closer.”

She lowered her head and nodded. Her teeth clicked.

The porch light was still on. 

The door sprang against the wall. My mother stepped out of the kitchen with a dish towel in her hands.

“Tyler? What on earth, it’s past midnight, where have you been? Why is Emma with you? And is that vomit?”

Emma found her words before I did. The dam broke.

“They killed them,” she said. “They killed them in the yard. They cut them up. The teachers. They cut them up. Mason, Jodie, Lena. All of them.”

My mom stared. The towel twisted in her hands so hard it squeaked.

“Sit,” she said. “Sit down. You’re in shock.”

She guided us to the couch. She brought blankets. She brought water. Then she knelt in front of us and listened.

We spilled everything. Not in order. Not clean. The story broke into pieces. The board. Lena in the doorway. The charms. The staff room. Jodie on the floor. Mason in the frost. She stayed with every word until we emptied ourselves. Then she eased back. Her face drained around the mouth.

She said nothing for a stretch. Her gaze fixed on the wall, on the framed school staff portrait hanging there. When she spoke, it sounded like she had to pull each word through her lips.

“You’re sure,” she said. “You’re sure you saw them? You saw their faces?”

“Yes,” I said.

“You were never supposed to…” She halted. Her gaze widened. “Okay,” she said. “Okay. I’ll handle this. I’ll call this in.”

She crossed to the phone on the counter. I heard the tone, the numbers.

“Sheriff’s office,” a muffled voice said.

She used her teacher's voice, the one she uses every day at John Henry. “This is Renee Keller,” she said. “My son and his friend were at the high school tonight. They witnessed a teachers meeting. We need someone here now.”

A pause followed. I heard a deputy's reply rise on the other end.

“Just get someone out here,” she said. “They’d feel better talking to someone.”

She gave them our address. Another call followed, shorter, to a number she knew by heart. Her tone changed for that one. Lower. Heated.

“It happened again,” she said. “No, listen to me. They saw it. You can try to bury this one, but it'll be on you. I'm not doing it.”

Silence answered her.

“Yes,” she said. “I know what this means.” She hung up the receiver. 

“Who was that?” I asked.

“An old mistake,” she said. “Go put some clean clothes on. Emma, you can use one of Tyler's shirts. When the deputies come, you tell them the same thing you told me. Every detail.”

The squad arrived first. Then an ambulance. Then a third cruiser with the sheriff himself.

Emma’s parents came in while we were giving our statements. Her mother rushed in, eyes wide, robe half tied, and wrapped Emma in her arms without a word.

Two deputies questioned us while scribbling on yellow pads. The sheriff wrote nothing. He sat across from me with his hat in his lap and studied my face.

“You’re telling me you saw the principal and several staff members cutting apart two students,” he said. “At the high school.”

“Three students.”

“And you are certain it was them.”

“I know who I saw.”

He crossed one leg over the other and weighed his next line.

“We’ll check the grounds,” he said. “These accusations are pretty serious. It could ruin a lot of lives if you made a mistake. After all, it’s dark outside, your imaginations might have-.”

My mom cut him off.

“Don’t patronize these kids, Sheriff. It’s too late for that. They saw what they saw.”

The sheriff did not answer her. He offered a small polite smile that never touched his eyes.

“We’ll take a look, Ms. Keller.” he repeated. “But if these accusations were made against you, I think you’d like us to try to look through every avenue possible for a peaceful resolution.”

—-------------------- 

The sheriff returned near dawn. Ice clung to the hem of his coat. His boots left crescents of grit across the entryway rug.

“Well,” he said, like he was announcing the weather. “We walked the grounds. Checked the field. Checked every classroom you listed.”

“And?”

“Nothing. No bodies. No blood. No signs of a crime. Not even footprints in the frost except your son’s group around the gym doors.”

He paused before continuing, and his attention locked on me with a steady pressure.

“No sign of a fight. No sign of distress. Nothing to support what you are alleging.”

Emma’s voice shattered his words.

“You’re lying. You have to be lying. We saw them.”

“Ma’am,” he said to her mother instead, “kids that age get excited. They scare themselves. Urban legends. Group hysteria. You remember when they said there was a man with a hook at the quarry?”

He turned back toward my mom. “And Ms. Keller, I know you’re upset. You work at the school with these kids.” He let those words hang, like he was reminding her of something. “But we have to work with the facts.”

“The fact,” she said, “is that my son came home terrified and now I have to worry about what the school is going to do to him.”

The sheriff’s eyes cooled. “And the fact is, he and the girl admit they broke into public property after hours. There are words for that. Trespass. Vandalism. False reporting is another one.” He let the list drift between us. “You have a good position in the district. Be a shame to tangle all that up over a child's story.”

My mom froze. Something sealed across her features, firm and set.

“You are not going to threaten my family,” she said. “Not in my house.”

“Nobody is threatening anyone. I am asking you as a colleague to be careful. For your sake. For his.” He set a card on the table. The deputies moved with him toward the door.

Through the curtain at the front window I watched the cruiser idle under the streetlamp. The sheriff sat unmoving for several seconds, both arms resting on the wheel. The headlights washed over the frost and set the yard in broken stripes.

When he moved in his seat, the shift brought a small object into view beneath the mirror. Something dangled on a loop of twine. Twigs. A scrap of husk. A thin white sliver threaded through the center.

The cruiser rolled away from the curb.

By morning, the news was already warping. The phone rang. The school. They asked if I knew where Mason and Jodie had gone, since we were “close friends” and they had not come home.

“You know exactly where they are.”

Mom took the receiver. “He has nothing else to say to you,” she told them, then ended the call.

Emma’s mom arrived that afternoon. She and my mom shut themselves in the bedroom with the phone. I caught fragments through the wall.

“It’s not going to stop.”

“They expect us to live with this?”

“I can’t send him back there.”

At some point Emma’s mom began to cry. Not loud. Just this tired, worn out sound.

They emerged with puffy faces and a plan.

“We’re leaving,” Mom said. “You and me. Emma and her parents. We’ll be gone by the end of the week.”

“What about school?” I asked. It felt stupid the instant it left my mouth.

“There are other schools, Tyler.”

The next few days slid together in a blur of boxes and suitcases. Neighbors drifted out onto their porches and tracked our move. No one asked why. They knew. Or they guessed. I wasn’t sure which was worse.

The official story claimed Lena had slipped into a stream on her way home. Mason and Jodie were labeled “troubled” and were said to have run off together. 

Their faces showed up on posters at the gas station beside warnings and tip lines: *Missing… Last seen wearing… Call if you have information…*

We moved two counties over. New mascot. Same sky. Emma and I ended up at the same school. We sat together at lunch and steered our conversations toward anything except that night. We never spoke of it. Not in person. Not online. Not drunk at some party years later. 

Life widened. College came and went. Emma moved states away for a time.

Last night she sent me a message for the first time in years.

It opened with a picture of a hiring email on her computer screen. The district’s logo sat at the top. John Henry High. Beneath it ran a short line.

*I got the position. I’ll be teaching English at the school. I know what you’re thinking. Please don’t try to talk me out of it. Maybe I can fix it from the inside. Someone has to try. I just can't keep running away anymore.* 

There was a second message after that.

*If anything changes I’ll let you know, Ty. I promise.*

*Love, Em.*",7,1764178488.0,creepcast,2,0.83,False

I bought the original Experience Plus back in 2022 for a concert and have gotten great use out of them since. I use them for going out clubbing, at the bar, at theme parks, sometimes grocery shopping, and most recently at my first EDC. I sometimes like to keep them in my ears when I need to focus on work in coffee shops, not necessarily for blocking a lot of sound, but because the feeling itself in my ears helps with locking in. I honestly don’t go anywhere without them. Only issue I’ve ever felt with them is the occlusion makes it a little difficult to have conversations in semi-loud places like the bar. 

I’ve been thinking about getting the Engage 2 for a while now, since I’ve mainly used my Experiences in social gatherings and it’s just not light enough. They’ve been great for the club, concerts and festivals, but I think the Engage would be better for daily use.

Id just like to point out a few things- My Grandma is a hoarder, (my uncle and two of my aunts live with her). She's mainly a hoarder of toys amongst all other things and of perishables and canned goods. They live in an 70's trailer house set on a basement with another old trailer ""attached"" to it, with plywood. They have a bad mouse and moth infestation. There house is filthy, they live in swamp land and have/have had black mold and water in their basement for a long time and TONSSSSS OF garbage bags (probably hundreds) full of old toys, and various other stuff, as well as totes full.  they bathe only with baby wipes because they completely filled up their bathrooms with stuff. In the trailer they aren't currently living in, they use it as a storage room and you have to CRAWL over mountains of stuff almost piled to the ceiling. Her house consists of very narrow pathways and safety hazards everywhere, so Im always hesitant about the thought of bringing my kids inside. My Grandma has a history of shunning certain relatives (the ones that don't live with her), whenever they don't do what she wants or says something she doesn't happen to like.  She's cut my mom out of pictures when my mom was a teen to ""teach her a lesson"", Called my Aunt that doesn't live with her ""a devil"" when that aunt is the sweetest lady ever. Convinced my Uncle that HIS daughter wasn't his when she was 2 months old, so my Uncle would instead stay at home and not leave her. My Grandma also is a huge conspiracy theorist (alien and robots are going to hack into our brains, etc). Everyone in that house has some sort of mental problem and they all struggle with mental health issues. 

I use to be really close to them when I was younger especially my ""Aunt R"". My Grandma also is the type of person to talk nice to your face and then talk poorly behind your back. I've witnessed her do it to my mom, one aunt, and others and i can guarentee she does it to me. My mom and I got shunned a week before I was due with my daughter because she wanted my mom to go to her house and my mom has told her that she was going to help me finish fixing up my house so it was ready for the baby and for me to move into. She tried to call my grandma back and never heard anything back from her and called a bunch more before giving up and I also attempted to call and also go over there with my daughter hoping theyd come outside and they had the door locked so after awhile we gave up. July 23rd of this year, my Aunt B (the one that doesn't live with them) showed up to their house and they happened to be outside and she managed to talk my Grandma into coming over and visiting me, Grandma apparently grumbled to herself a little bit before agreeing to go. When they showed up I welcomed her and treated her kindly, despite me feeling a little awkward in her presence. I made her coffee and just sat down with her and talked to her about a bunch of random stuff and told her it was great to see her again.  They started coming over to my house and I even went to there's twice to help them with a few things and everything was great. Then September 12th, Aunt B called my Aunt S (S lives with Grandma) after apparently hearing some rumors they had told to other relatives about Aunt B's husband that weren't true and Aunt B wanted S to explain to her how/why/where they heard all that about B's husband and were telling people that. Aunt B was ranting and my Aunt S was mostly quiet on speaker phone before my Aunt B said ""Do you even have anything to say or tell me?"" and Aunt S was like ""A lot"" then Aunt B said ""Well just tell me"" and Aunt S said ""Id rather not"" and then just hung up. Later I randomly got a message from Aunt S saying ""Mom (Grandma) is Crying. We are coming to get the toys. Leave them on the porch."" Referring to the Toys they had given my 2 year old daughter. Including 2 large fisher price doll houses, two fisher price out door play houses, little people, etc that my daughter loved to play with. The worst part is, I don't even know what i ever did to be shunned AGAIN!! and for them to punish my toddler by taking toys away from her is crazy, not to mention they also took toys that were outside in the yard away from the porch that weren't given to her by them. I have tried to ask my aunt S what was wrong and why they wanted the toys back, etc but she never said anything to me after that so I gave up.  The last thing she ever said was to my aunt Becky and she said ""WE ARE DONE. red tape don't call."" My Aunt is assuming that because they were mad at her they took it out on me and my 2 year old also paid the price getting toys taken from her. 

I'm really not that open about any of this in person. If there's some kind of drama between family I keep it to my self and don't spread it but it's getting crazy!! I will say part of me mourns that side of my family being the way they are, especially because everyone except my grandma and uncle never really leave their house. Life was more peaceful during the time they wouldn't speak to us but like always I tried to give them another chance because I've always wanted them to be included in my kids lives in some way but all the unnecessary drama and trying to cause division amongst other family members makes it seem almost impossible. Also my Mom is getting re-married and my mom is a very beautiful lady but my grandma had the audacity at my house before I was shunned this last time to say to me that my mom looked ""old"", ""fake"", ""skin looks dry"" and etc. And my mom even invited them to the wedding while being shunned and my grandma got the invitation and said ""It says cocktail attire. Well we ain't going because us redneck/hillbillies aren't going to be wanted at a goodie two shoes wedding"". 

Some distant relatives that my grandma talks to (like her sister) say that we are being ""unfair"" and ""rude"" and keeping her from seeing her great grandchildren but that's not the case at all!!!! I have messaged those guys telling them they are still welcome to come over, talk and see the kids, visit, have lunch here and etc but they never willingly show up on their own. Now that I'm shunned I know i won't be seeing them for along time, possibly never again. I just don't understand it. 

 Is any of this actually unfair or rude of me??? Is it best just to not pay attention to them and just go our separate ways for now/ever. Also why in the heck do you think they're like this?? I just don't understand it. I have such a good relationship with my aunt B but not them. They're only ever happy if people do stuff for them or give them things it seems. I just don't know what to do. I try but to no avail. Also, before people ask, yes there have been numerous attempts to get them mental help and they had the health inspector called to their house by neighbors and the inspectors didn't ever do much.  They refuse any kind of help.",0,1764177896.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False

I sit down to work and the day feels slow, like syrup slow, but then I blink and somehow two weeks passed and I dont remember a single standout moment except maybe that one Teams call where my coworker forgot to unmute herself for five straight minutes . Some days I swear my apartment feels like a loop. I wake up, open the laptop, type in the same corner of the same room with the same cup of coffee that goes cold by mistake every time . I get my tasks done, I reply to messages and then at 6pm I close the laptop and the silence hits like a wall. It feels like being underwater, not in a sad way but in a where did the day go way . I used to have markers before, like walking to the office, seeing the same bakery lady every morning. Random moments that told my brain time was moving. Now its just me and Google Calendar. Whats weird is I love working remote. Like really love it. I dont want to trad e it for commuting or awkward office chats. But I keep thinking maybe humans needed those tiny daily changes just to feel the day actually happened.

Let's keep the stress conversation going. We've already covered [what happens to your body when you're stressed](https://www.reddit.com/r/welltory/comments/1p1exhh/welltory_stress_series_part_1_what_stress/) and [how to deal with it](https://www.reddit.com/r/welltory/comments/1p5qup3/welltory_stress_series_part_2_stress_relief_that/). Now here's Part 3, where I'll walk you through our new stress-relief feature ([check it out on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/welltory/launches/welltory-2)).

Quick recap:

* Acute psychological stress makes your blood vessels narrow (vasoconstriction)
* Chronic stress without physical activity damages your blood vessel lining (endothelial dysfunction)
* Repeated narrowing creates tiny damage to your vascular walls
* This micro-damage is one way atherosclerosis develops

Translation: Every time you sit through a stressful meeting, your blood vessels take micro-hits. Over time, that damage adds up and increases your risk of cardiovascular problems.

Here's the thing most people don't realize: you're usually stressed way before you actually feel stressed. Your body goes into stress mode hours before you consciously register it. And that's where the damage happens.

https://preview.redd.it/91oy2ipbrm3g1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6189480179c6336ca215fc4ffc339ac85331888

Welltory catches it early. We've built this on 8 years of data from 16 million people and fundamental[ scientific research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763416301658?via%3Dihub). It doesn't just count heartbeats — it understands your whole picture. How you slept, how active you've been, what your body's dealing with right now. Your Stress score isn't some vague ""hey, you seem stressed"" alert. It's a precise measurement of the actual strain currently accumulating in your system.

Plus, you see exactly what's causing it. That third coffee at 2pm. Sitting through 4 hours of back-to-back meetings. Last night's terrible sleep that left you starting the day already in the red. The pattern that's been quietly draining you for weeks becomes completely visible.

Most stress trackers stop at telling you there's a problem. Welltory shows you how to fix it. Move now — and here's how intensely. Rest now — and here's why it matters. Sleep better tonight — and here's your optimal bedtime based on your data. You're not guessing or hoping anymore. You're actively protecting your health before stress damages it.

# Know What's Happening Right Now

Your stress level updates in real time throughout the day on your Today Screen. The moment you wake up, you see whether your body recovered overnight or if you're already starting in the red. As the hours pass, the number moves with you, climbing when stress builds, dropping when you recover.

https://preview.redd.it/xkm6vy5wrm3g1.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=b76c16724b5f3d1cf4f6d0ca791c1516628ca889

You don't wait until you're exhausted to realize something's wrong. You see it happening and intervene while you still have the energy to do something about it.

# Stress Impact: Your Daily Patterns

Check in with your Stress Impact anytime to get an instant read on how things are going right now compared to previous days. If you notice your stress score skyrocketing every Tuesday, you can start investigating the cause. Maybe it's that standing meeting that always runs long, or the traffic jam that only happens on Tuesdays, or the fact that you skipped lunch that day to catch up on work.

https://preview.redd.it/x0s8dq9dsm3g1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e01856708758474eaf834a33795aab2e781f5cd

By the end of the day, this becomes your damage report, showing exactly how much today cost you. Instead of managing stress after it's already destroyed you, you're managing it while it's still happening. That's the difference between surviving demanding days and collapsing after them.

# Daily Timeline: See What's Harming You (And What Saves You)

This chart reveals which activities stress you out and which ones help you recover.

https://preview.redd.it/epottc8rsm3g1.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=e02aeb37f679e8a14b9ccece6ac8935eac1be7c4

* Purple shows your sleep time at night.
* Blue marks when your body is resting or relaxing.
* Pink means your heart rate is slightly elevated, but you're not under physical strain (usually focused mental work, which is productive tension where your mind is engaged but your body isn't taking damage).
* Orange indicates harmful stress: an elevated heart rate without movement, with your body staying tense and energy draining away.
* Green represents any kind of movement, from walking to intense workouts.

Once you start tracking this, the patterns become obvious. That 2-hour afternoon meeting that shows up in orange has clearly been doing more harm than good. That 15-minute walk after lunch that turns your orange zone blue is one of the best things you do all day. The evening you spent reading that kept you in blue the whole time genuinely helped you recover.

Based on these insights, you naturally stop doing more of what drains you and start doing more of what restores you. It becomes automatic once you can actually see the effect of your choices.

# Stress Minutes: Your Daily Damage Counter

This shows how many minutes your body spent in the danger zone today: heart rate elevated, no movement happening, stress hormones circulating with nowhere to go.

https://preview.redd.it/yecyhuj7tm3g1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e8550bf47a032f10cb607e9eb898b1f2e428d98

Compare it to your average for this day of the week. More than usual means you need to act now: take a walk, do some stretches, cook dinner instead of ordering in, play with your dog, whatever helps you move and reset. Less than usual means you're handling today better than you typically do.

# Stress-Coping Curve: Catch Your Recovery Window

This chart shows how effectively you're managing stress throughout the day.

https://preview.redd.it/l46lvumotm3g1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=55009616385e8a912aa6a6eba34b13a850077b96

The thicker the line gets, the more damage you're accumulating. But (!) you have a brief window after stress hits where something as simple as a 10-minute walk can completely erase it. Wait too long, and that tension gets locked in: your body stays on high alert, and the fatigue becomes sticky and persistent.

This chart shows you exactly when that recovery window is open. Miss it, and you'll pay the price for hours. Catch it, and you bounce back fast. Recovery is all about timing and taking action when your body actually needs it.

Track this daily, and it becomes instinctive. You start feeling tension building, and you know exactly when to intervene before it costs you hours of recovery time later.

# Stress-Impacting Events: Connect Cause and Effect

This screen links every physiological event to what you were doing at the time.

https://preview.redd.it/qba71lb4um3g1.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6f3ad656cd1b0e9228757fd3f7efeb5baa94116

You'll see the connections clearly: ""3pm stress spike = three back-to-back calls with no break between them."" ""6pm recovery drop = that 20-minute run you did after work."" ""11am stress climb = skipped breakfast and drank coffee on an empty stomach.""

Your body has been trying to tell you what works and what doesn't this whole time. You now can finally understand what it's saying and make choices that support your wellbeing instead of undermining it.

# Trends Over Days, Weeks, and Months: Zoom Out

This view lets you zoom out and examine your stress patterns over weeks and months.

https://preview.redd.it/1kl92qzxwm3g1.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=aed8eed567fbb485581c84e935a49cac2a40712c

When you look at the bigger picture, you'll notice things you've been completely missing.

Maybe your stress spikes predictably every month during the last week when deadlines hit. Or that workout routine you started 4 weeks ago is really working: your baseline stress has dropped 20% and your recovery is noticeably faster. Or perhaps you thought you were managing fine, but the data shows stress has been quietly climbing for 6 weeks straight, which explains why you've been feeling so drained lately.

You can't fix patterns you can't see. These trends make the invisible completely visible, which means you can finally address the root causes before they break you. This is how you stop reacting to burnout after it happens and start preventing it before it takes hold.

1p7dl92,https://i.redd.it/ljeonwyrxm3g1.jpeg,Would love some help on exterior colors & redesign!,"Hi, I’m in a bit of a crunch bc we are redoing the roof in 2 weeks & I owe the roofing contractor color confirmation like yesterday.

But I am planning to fully redo the exterior colors / siding in early spring.  So I’m trying to figure it all out now.

I’m leaning towards 2 -3 different options.  Chat gpt & Gemini have me pulling out my hair trying to realize these.

Option 1: classic direction - creamy, off-white.  Maybe Swiss coffee or maybe something a bit more gray (like SW Greek villa).  I would also look to add some stonework along the bottom.  Door in either charcoal or a sage-y green.

Option 2: more “mountain house”.  Green siding & green trim (TBD classic or vertical B&B).  I was trying to figure out how to add real wood outside of a small far-off center porch?  I would still like to add some stone work.

Option 3: above green option, but maybe more classic w/a creamy off-white trim.  No natural wood.


Other: the door you see in this pic is not functional.  It will removed in the spring once I figure out what to do.  The door we use is on the side hidden by a giant shrub in this pic.  There will also be a large skylight facing our pretty much above where that door is.

Roof shingles will be from GAF timberline HDZ.

Honestly, EVERYTHING went wrong with this house shortly after buying it (2 sets of burst pipes!  A flooded basement unrelated to burst pipes!  Finding out bathroom plumbing needed to be ripped out!  Black mold (unrelated to the above)!  Learning 1/2 the house had no heat!).  Many years were shed!  So the exterior including landscaping etc is in sad shape!  I’ve hardly even thought about it.

Also more info- house is in the NE (upstate NY).  We are sorta between country & mountains.  Definitely not in the burbs.  We aren’t in the south, but the summers can get very hot so probably not going to do an extremely dark roof.  It is on a busy street so we would never use a nice front porch.

Window frames are white.  I love the look of black windows, but we are not redoing all windows.  I’ve seen the white windows repainted black & don’t love them.

La Marzocco GS3 AV

* Pros
   * Great built and reliability
   * programable buttons for ease of use
* Cons
   * won´t be available until 6 months from now (is fine for the opening of the cafe but I would prefer to have it earlier to get familiar with the machine and make some test)

Sanremo YOU

* Pros
   * great control for different shots and different coffees
   * Is the cheapest by far
* Cons
   * A very complex machine on the inside, so I don't know how reliable it would be in the long term
   * very small water tanks only 0.5L for brew water and 1L for steam, so I'm not sure if it would be capable to make up to 10 shots back to back

So I wrote a 38-page guide to help them ""Free Their Mind."" It's ₹99, but here is a summary of the best lessons.","https://preview.redd.it/rtcdcztdxm3g1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=861fe903e289e8a3bf9e74ad6a924873fcad9d67

Hi everyone, I’m Ajay Sati, Founder of AJ Smart Education Institute (AJSEI).

In my line of work, I meet hundreds of brilliant students and professionals every year. Their resumes are stacked with achievements, but their minds are often full of anxiety, doubt, and ""what will people say?"" fears.

I realized that while we are taught how to solve math problems, we are rarely taught how to solve overthinking.

So, I wrote a short, practical book called **""Free Your Mind""**. It’s not a heavy philosophy book; it’s a mental first-aid kit.

If you don't want to buy it, that's okay! Here are the **3 most important lessons** from the book for free:

**1. The Invisible Backpack** 🎒 Imagine walking with a heavy backpack you forgot you were wearing. That is what ""grudges"" and ""past mistakes"" are. You carry them into every room. The first step to peace isn't meditation; it's simply *dropping the rock*. Write down your worry, crumple the paper, and physically throw it away.

**2. The 10% Rule** 📈 You don't need to quit your job or run a marathon to leave your Comfort Zone. You just need to push the walls back by 10%. Shy? Say hello to one stranger. Lazy? Walk for 5 minutes. Growth happens in inches, not miles.

**3. Focus is a Superpower** 🎯 Multitasking is a lie. It’s actually ""Switch-Tasking,"" and it drains your brain battery. Treat your focus like a laser beam, not a light bulb. Do one thing at a time, and you'll finish in half the time.

If you found this helpful, the full book (with 10 lessons and exercises) is available on Amazon. It's priced at ₹99 (less than a coffee) because I want it to reach as many people as possible.

Thanks for reading! I’d love to hear your thoughts on how you deal with stress.

So yes I love nature and where I am there's plenty of nice places to explore so I love it here (and also I feel like there's an invisible thread weaved by precious cultural heritage that's keeping me tethered to this country) but I would definitely relocate to be with the right person.

And yes introductions are hard because of the dreaded ""what do you do for a living?"" I'm unemployed due to chronic illness (I'm open to speaking about it in DMs). I do pick up freelance projects every once in a while but for the most part I'm a good old unemployed person with more or less stable symptoms now but unable to work still. Hopefully one day as I'm recovering.

Some of my hobbies include: Reading, painting, hiking and talking walks in nature (again, trees), scrapbooking and photography. I also like swimming, and going to bookstores and coffeeshops. 

More on trees: I didn't realize this until recently, which  is strange for my big age. I have to be around trees. I feel a bit blue when I'm somewhere I can't look around or out of the window and see a tree or a mountain in the distance.

Things that make me happy:

• A good cup of coffee and/or some yummy food

• Sleep

• When a conversation is going well and all participants are feeling warm and content

• Books obviously (I'm incredibly blessed to be able to read in three languages so it feels like I'll never not find a book I want to read) 

• Walks

• The sea. A cup of tea or swimming or laying down reading a book in the beach. And snow. Just playing with snow

• Thrift stores 

• Museums and historical sites

I'm heteroromantic asexual. Neutral leaning repulsed. I'm politically left leaning. I'm Muslim, and would prefer my partner to be Muslim as well. I'm looking for a companion, someone to make me laugh, someone to inspire and be inspired by. I appreciate curiosity, initiative and kindness.

1p7dehd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkLikeAnAdult/comments/1p7dehd/how_a_room_responds_when_you_have_status_vs_when/,"How a room responds when you have status vs when you don’t, and why it’s not just in your head","Ever walk into a room and feel invisible? Then some other person walks in, barely says a word, and suddenly everyone’s tuned to their frequency like they’re the main character in real life? Yeah. Same room. Same people. Wildly different outcomes.  

I’ve watched this play out countless times. At parties. On Zoom calls. Even in coffee shops. The difference isn’t always in what people *do*, it’s in the *status* they hold. And here’s the part no one says out loud: status isn’t just about money or power. It’s about cues people pick up subconsciously, posture, tone, perceived competence, who’s listening to you, and even how you enter a space. High-status people move differently. Talk differently. Take up space differently.  

This post breaks down why this happens, how it’s rooted in our psychology, and most importantly, how to shift the way rooms respond *to you*. All pulled from books, research, podcasts, and real-world observation, not TikTok bro-science or those “alpha energy” clips that set us back 10 years.  

Let’s go.

---

1. **People don’t just see you, they *sense* you**  
Human brains are wired to assess threat and opportunity in microseconds. According to Dr. Amy Cuddy, who literally wrote the book on body language, people evaluate two things first: *warmth* and *competence*. That’s status shorthand. Are you someone to trust? Are you someone to follow? You can project both without saying a word. Her book *Presence* digs into this. She found that even tiny shifts in posture and breathing affected not only how others see us but also how *we* feel, increasing testosterone and lowering cortisol.  

2. **The room mirrors your internal narrative**  
In *The Social Animal* by David Brooks, he explains how we live “from the inside out”, people tend to respond to the emotional tone we carry with us. If you feel invisible, hesitant, unsure, that’s what people will subtly reflect back. It’s not about faking confidence, it’s about changing the story you’re running in your head. One clinical psychology study published in *Personality and Individual Differences* (2022) showed that individuals who ranked high on self-perceived social competence were rated more attractive, charismatic, and trustworthy by others, even with identical scripts and clothing.  

3. **Status can be built. One signal at a time.**  
You don’t need money or celebrity. You need to master micro-signals. Here’s what I’ve seen work: speak 20% slower than you think you should, pause before responding, make strong eye contact, take up physical space (not in a fake way, but don’t shrink), and hold your frame. Matthew Hussey talks about this in his dating advice but it applies way beyond romance. People *feel* when you’re unshakeable. That’s status.

4. **Make learning part of your life**  
The fastest way to gain status is to become someone with *real insight and clarity*. People respect people who think well. Not just tweet well. You don’t need to go back to school, but you do need to become dangerous with knowledge. Curious people are magnetic. This is a long game, but it’s a tactical one. Build your own information diet like a training regimen.  

5. **Podcasts that quietly upgrade how you think**  
Try *The Knowledge Project* by Shane Parrish. Every guest is a master in their field, from investors to psychologists to military strategists. His interviews are slow, deep, and ridiculously useful. The way he breaks down mental models will give you language that signals competence *without trying hard*.  
Another banger: *Modern Wisdom* by Chris Williamson. He blends science, pop culture, and deep thinkers in a digestible way. His episode with Robert Greene (the *48 Laws of Power* guy) might change how you approach every interaction for the next decade.

6. **Read THIS book if you want to understand power dynamics**  
*The 48 Laws of Power* by Robert Greene. It’s a cult classic for a reason. Still banned in many prisons. Loved by CEOs and hip-hop artists alike. Greene doesn’t sugarcoat. He tells you how power actually works, not how we wish it worked. This book will make you question everything you think you know about trust, reputation, and influence. It’s dark, manipulative at times, but insanely instructive. You won’t read people the same way again. This is the best “how society really works” book I’ve ever read.

7. **Practice conversations like a skill**  
One app that actually helped me here: *All Ears English*. It’s designed more for language learners, but the daily spoken situations and tone practice are gold. It teaches how to speak with clarity and presence, and you can listen passively during morning walks. Their breakdowns on tone and word choice are actually useful even if you’re a native speaker.  

8. **Improve 1% every day**  
There’s this newer app I’ve been using called *BeFreed*. You tell it what you’re trying to work on, for me, it’s social presence and emotional intelligence, and it creates podcast-style audio episodes based on legit sources like psychology books, research papers, and expert interviews. What I like is that it’s not generic. If an episode explains something that hits home, I can pause and ask, “What’s a real-life example of that?” or “How do I apply that in a workplace setting?” and it’ll go deeper right away. It’s like having an insanely patient coach in your AirPods.  

9. **This book will reset how you see yourself**  
*The Mountain Is You* by Brianna Wiest. Bestseller. Award-winning. One of the most highlighted books on Kindle for a reason. It’s all about self-sabotage and emotional intelligence. But not in a preachy way. Wiest has a scary ability to write things you *feel* but never knew how to say. After reading it, I started to catch my own low-status behaviors in real time, apologizing too much, making myself small, overexplaining. This book is a mirror. It hurts. But it’s the best self-awareness manual I’ve ever touched.  

10. **Watch master status players in action**  
This YouTube channel *Charisma on Command* breaks down real-life clips, like how Barack Obama uses silence, or how Zendaya charms everyone in the room, and reverse engineers what’s happening. There’s a video on how high-status people deal with disrespect that I’ve rewatched 4 times. Not because it’s just “cool” but because I’m learning how to stay calm under pressure like they do. This kind of modeling is underrated.  

Status isn’t about being better than others. It’s about knowing what kind of energy you carry into every room. Learn it. Practice it. Build it. The room will follow.",1,1764177213.0,TalkLikeAnAdult,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **New York Islanders vs. Boston Bruins: A Rivalry Reckoning with Puck, Pain, and Puns**

The New York Islanders and Boston Bruins collide on Wednesday, November 26, 2025, in a clash that’s part hockey, part chess, and part “why did we book this game on a Tuesday?” The odds favor the Isles (-164), while the Bruins (+136) enter as underdogs, but let’s not let the numbers fool us—this is a game where even a puck might question its alignment.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The Islanders’ implied probability of winning sits at \~62.5% (decimal odds \~1.6), while the Bruins hover around 41.7% (\~2.4 decimal). That leaves a 15.8% “vigorish” for bookmakers—a tidy profit margin, but not so wide that it dismisses Boston’s chances. The total goals line is set at **6.0**, with the over priced at \~1.91 and the under at \~1.95. Given the teams’ combined average of **6.1 goals per game** this season, and their penchant for scoring (13 of 23 games hit over 5.5), the **Over 6.0** is a no-brainer unless you enjoy watching players practice penalty kicks in the third period.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Momentum, and Penalty Plagues

**New York Islanders**:

* **Injuries**: Alexander Romanov (out 5–6 months) and Jean-Gabriel Pageau (week-to-week) are MIA, while Casey Cizikas might as well be on a desert island. Their power play? A glacial 13.3% (10/75), slower than a Zamboni on a coffee break.
* **Momentum**: They just tied a franchise record with six wins on a seven-game road trip, including a dramatic shootout victory. Coach Patrick Roy claims they’ve “finally practiced,” which is code for “we haven’t had time to go extinct.”

**Boston Bruins**:

* **Absentees**: Brad Marchand and Patrice Bergeron are out, which is like asking a band to play without its lead guitarist and drummer. David Pastrnak is fuming about their penalty-killing reliance: “It’s every game,” he groaned, which sounds less like strategy and more like a cry for help.
* **Penalty Problems**: Boston leads the league in power-play goal

I was able to get some “okay” sleep last night, but as soon as I woke up, all of the emotions came rushing back. I cried instantly when I woke up. Cried when I was making my morning coffee. Cried while I was watching tv while drinking my morning coffee, which is usually my favorite time of the day. Cried when I was at the gym, on the treadmill and while lifting weights. And now, I am supposed to help prepare things for Thanksgiving, while trying to keep a poker face and act like nothing is wrong. 

Like I said, I hate crying, but I just don’t know how to make it stop. Sometimes it’s me just being misty eyed, and sometimes it turns in to a full on ugly sob. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to deal with this pain that I feel. My heart physically feels broken, I’ve lost my appetite due to the rock in my stomach, and the crying has just physically tired me out. 

I am no stranger to pain, and in fact, these last few years have been quite difficult for me, but what I’m feeling right now is very reminiscent of what I used to call the “worst time of my life” in the past, which is very scary, because I fought so hard to get out that era of my life. And now it feels like it’s slowly creeping up on me again. 

My friends, please keep me in your hearts and your minds. I am hoping things get better soon. ",6,1764177171.0,GuyCry,3,1.0,False

The man in front of me accidentally spilled his drink and apologized to me. After exchanging a few polite phrases, we decided to sit down at a table. It turned out that he was a former employee of this coffee shop, so I asked him why he no longer worked there. He replied that he had found a great way to make money on Reddit from this guy u/amber_85. When I got home, I tried it without much expectation, but the result surprised me, so I'm sharing it with you u/amber_85.",9,1764177106.0,RobinhoodTrade,0,1.0,False

But I'm also aware that I'm missing out on some great coffee experiences that are not as ""in your face"" but still awesome.  I can still enjoy a cup that isn't hopped up on blackberry juice or whatever.    

Those of you who are fans of the elegant, floral, delicate side of coffee (Geshas or otherwise) -- can you recommend me something I can grab a bag of for the holidays?

They cut hours then just let me go. Unemployment was $280/week which barely covered anything. Rent is $1100.

Tried applying to other retail jobs but everything was part time or minimum wage. Decided to figure out how to make money online instead.

Started an Instagram page about budget meal prep in May. Thought it would be easy. Posted random recipes and tips. Got maybe 30 likes per post. Grew to 800 followers in 2 months and made $0.

Tried to monetize too early. Put affiliate links everywhere. Nobody clicked. Page looked desperate.

Stopped posting for 3 weeks in July because I thought it was pointless. Then randomly posted a video about making meals for under $3. It got 35k views. Went from 800 followers to 4200 in a week.

Started posting more consistently after that. Had a few more videos hit 10k to 20k views over the next couple months. Growth slowed down but kept going.

Brands started reaching out in August. First deal was $150 for 3 posts about meal planning containers. Thought it was a scam but they paid.

Made $340 in September from brand deals and Amazon affiliate links. Made $680 in October. Made $900 in November.

Also started doing social media management for local businesses in September. Found my first client by DMing a coffee shop that had 400 followers and hadn't posted in 2 months. Offered to run their Instagram for $200/month.

Got a second client in October, a nail salon for $250/month. Then a third one in November, a small gym for $200/month. That's $650/month from freelance work.

Total in November was $1550. First time I've covered rent and groceries without panicking.

Instagram page is at 9k followers now. I try to post daily but realistically it's more like 4-5 times a week. Mostly short videos about cheap meals and grocery shopping tips.

Social media work takes about 6 hours a week total. Create posts for all 3 clients, schedule them, reply to comments. Pretty easy once you have a system.

Still not stable though. Instagram income varies a lot. Some months brands reach out, some months nothing. Freelance clients could drop me anytime.

But it's better than retail. At least I control my time.

Time investment is maybe 15-20 hours a week across everything. Costs are around $35/month for scheduling tools and some other stuff.

Biggest thing I learned is you can't force it. That one video that blew up wasn't better than my other content. Just got lucky with timing. Now I post consistently and hope something hits.

Keep in mind I’m a FT employee in a state government department…

A few things he did: 

(Generally he would do that intense unblinking glare at me when speaking with me, keep that in mind re all the below, I was new to being FT, and his site, but had been working at a different site as a casual in the same role with no issues ever raised). 

Also, he’d say this in front of other workers at the workshop…

Repeatedly tell me I was taking ‘too much leave’ - the first time he raised this, I explained why I had taken the leave: 

Childcare, I was actually sick, an uncle died. His immediate reply ‘You’re taking too much leave’. 

Deny my ability to even soft book holidays on a holiday planner in the staff room, whilst other staff could. 

Tell me that I couldn’t drink coffee during work hours at work - that I couldn’t only drink coffee on my breaks. 

Tell me that I couldn’t drink water at the ‘staff hub’ which was mid site during work hours at work - that I couldn’t only drink water during my work hours at the workshop (which was located at the far end of the site). 

On the above, he later clarified by email that I *could* drink water during my work hours at the staff hub, copying in three people from HR, CCing in his boss. 

Yes, he put that in writing. 

Tell me that I could not get leave in advance or buy leave. I checked the EBA. I said mate I can it’s in the EBA, his reply - well you *can*, but it’s a ‘big’ process. 

Tell me that I could not undertake a course I wanted to do (involving two work days off a month) due to ‘operational reasons’. (I was one of 5 guys in the same role at the site). 

There’s more, but you get the jist. 

During my time there I had no negative comments raised about my work even from him, I received no written warnings. 

I’ve been at the new site now for a few months - they immediately oked the course time off. 

So - what ya recon, shall I put in a formal bullying complaint in re this guy? 

It is coming up to Christmas, I don’t want to ruin his Christmas and New Years…

Quantum systems will not just crunch data faster. They will let models explore possibilities that classical machines can barely represent. We might finally watch algorithms learn in a way that feels less like static math and more like fluid intuition.



The real shift will happen once quantum processors become stable enough to run continuously without massive cooling requirements. When that happens, we get machine learning models that can reason over enormous probability spaces in real time. Instead of training a model for days on a network of traditional servers, a future researcher might hit run, grab a cup of coffee, and come back to something that has already refactored its own understanding of an entire scientific field. I also think we will see a change in what we even call intelligence. If models gain the ability to test multiple realities at once through quantum states, their predictions might look less like a single answer and more like a spectrum of insight. People will probably talk to their personal AI assistants the way they talk to advisors or creative partners instead of treating them as tools. The line between computing and thinking will feel increasingly blurry.



Of course, the cultural side might be the biggest surprise. The first time someone uses a quantum enabled learning system to solve a decades long medical puzzle or reveal new physics, it will hit us that we crossed into a new era. Not a science fiction one filled with glowing circuits but a quieter and stranger world where possibility itself expands. And it will be normal. That is the part that feels the most incredible.

No doubt, high school can be a high-pressure time in life. And high school students, as a result, get stressed out.  

In fact, according to the American Psychological Association’s Stress in America 2020 survey, teens who are already under stress due to the normal pressures of high school have felt even more stress in recent years, thanks to the pandemic. About 43 percent of teens surveyed in 2020 said their stress levels had gone up, and 45 percent said they had a hard time concentrating on schoolwork. Many reported feeling less motivated.

Although life has mostly returned back to normal, that doesn’t mean the stress that high school students feel has disappeared. 

The typical challenges that anyone faces in high school continue as they always have, and, in some cases, have grown more complicated. Consequently, surveys suggest, many teens continue to experience a decline in mental and physical health. 

If you’re in high school and stressed, we get it. In this blog, we’ll talk about what stress is, what triggers it, and how you can manage it. 

# What is Stress?

“Stress” is a term we use constantly in conversation, but what does it really mean? 

Stress can be defined as our physical and mental responses to some external event. The event might be considered “good” like preparing to go to the prom, or bad, like feeling tense after an illness, an argument with a friend, or while preparing for an upcoming test. 

The good thing about most stress is that it usually goes away once the external event causing the stress is over. 

Alternatively, there is a type of stress that results more from an internal dialogue than an external event. We call this “anxiety.” It involves persistent feelings of dread or apprehension that interfere with your daily life, even after the test, the argument, or prom, are just a distant memory. 

# Why Are Teens So Stressed? 

Simply being a teenager can be hard. Your body is changing. You may be grappling with your sexuality or gender identity. Add to that the academic demands of high school and throw in the pressures of social media, and the tension mounts. 

“Some of the common triggers of stress in teens might be anxiety to perform well in academics such as getting into a good college, peer pressure, interpersonal relationships, or body image issues,” says Sakshi Khurana, Research Fellow at Harvard’s Weisz Lab for Youth Mental Health. “Other larger issues that the world is going through — for example, climate change or war— might also act as stressors for teens as they are learning about the world.”

The most common source of stress for high school students, according to the 2017 APA Stress survey, is school itself, with about 83 percent of teens identifying school as a major stressor. The second biggest source of student stress, (according to 69 percent of students), was getting into a good college or deciding what to do after high school. The third biggest teen stress was financial concerns for the family (65 percent of students). 

Here’s a quick breakdown of broad categories of factors that may stress you out:

* **Academics.** In high school, not only are you worried about next week’s English, History or Calculus exam, but you’re also worried about applying to college and taking the SAT tests, too. It can all feel overwhelming, and you may feel pressure to please your parents and teachers.
* **Social Stress.** Even without the pressures of academics, life in high school can be demanding. Dealing with friends and classmates, starting new romantic relationships, handling bullies and peer pressure both online and off, can be a lot to handle.
* **Family Issues.** If your parents are divorcing, if your family is experiencing financial problems, or even if you just have trouble getting along with siblings, your stress levels can go up.
* **Trauma**. Dramatic life events ranging from a death in the family, to an accident, to emotional and physical abuse, can cause stress. Also in this category, you can include the collective trauma of such global events such as school shootings, terrorism, and natural disasters. 
* **Big Life Changes**. Changes like moving and starting a new school can be a major stress for teens. 

# What are Signs of Stress in High School Students?

If you’re a high school student feeling stressed, you may not even recognize the symptoms. 

In fact, many symptoms of stress might be considered normal for teens who are also dealing with natural hormonal and physical changes. For that reason, it’s important to consider whether behavioral changes can be linked in time to an external event. 

Signs of stress include:

* Feeling more agitated, anxious, short-tempered, or depressed  
* Getting sick more often
* Having more headaches, stomachaches, or other aches and pains
* Feeling more tired than usual
* Not being able to sleep, or sleeping too much
* Skipping meals or overeating 
* Neglecting chores or hobbies 
* Trouble concentrating and forgetfulness
* High blood pressure

According to the APA 2017 survey, the most common symptoms of stress among teens were insomnia, overeating or eating unhealthy foods, skipping meals, feeling angry, nervous, or anxious, feeling fatigued, and snapping at friends and classmates.

# Why is Stress so Problematic for Teens?

Let’s be clear, a little bit of stress is a normal part of life, and sometimes even desirable. 

Stress can act as a motivator, getting us to do things we might not otherwise. Good stress is called “eustress” and can help get you excited and energized about that first date or taking the stage in your first musical.

But too much unrelieved stress can lead to mental and physical health issues.  

Your body reacts to stress by releasing a hormone called cortisol which regulates blood pressure and immune function. If you’re stressed all the time and your body produces too much cortisol, it can lower your immunity, raise your blood pressure, and impair your cognitive performance.

In teens, the part of the brain regulating the stress response is less developed than in adults, meaning that if you’re a stressed-out teen, you may experience stress longer than an adult. 

“In the teen years, due to hormonal changes, stress tends to influence the emotional functioning of the brain, which in turn impacts the cognitive and executive functioning,” says Khurana.

You might not be able to sleep, you may overeat, or develop digestive, cardiovascular, or immune problems. Stress can even put you at a higher risk for developing mental illnesses like anxiety or depression. 

# What are the Best Techniques to Help Students Manage Stress?

Since too much stress is not a good thing for your mind or body, you should think about incorporating a few stress management techniques into your daily life. 

“A few techniques that might help teens manage stress are relaxation through deep breathing, meditation, or mindfulness, channeling energy into sports or creative pursuits such as music, art, theater, and forming meaningful relationships or friendships,” says Khurana. “Additionally, every culture has its own way of enabling young people to manage stress, so drawing from those traditions might be helpful as well.”

Here are few ideas of how high school students can learn how to deal with stress at school: 

* Keeping a journal
* Getting plenty of exercise
* Eating healthy, regular meals
* Making sure you get enough sleep 
* Meditating
* Downloading an app that provides relaxation exercises (such as deep breathing or visualization) or tips for practicing mindfulness
* Limiting excess caffeine in soft drinks or coffee
* Reaching out to friends or family members who help you cope in a positive way
* Making time to do fun things
* Learning to recognize and prepare for stressful periods by doing all of the above

With so many big life decisions ahead, getting through high school happy and whole can definitely feel challenging at times. It’s easy to see why so many high school students feel stressed. The good news is that there are solutions. Adopt the strategies above, take a deep breath, and remember, it’s not forever! ",1,1764176597.0,StudentStorm,0,1.0,False

It’s just like when you’ve got some coffee that’s too black, which means it’s too strong. What do you do? You integrate it with cream, you make it weak. But if you pour too much cream in it, you won’t even know you ever had coffee. It used to be hot, it becomes cool. It used to be strong, it becomes weak. It used to wake you up, now it puts you to sleep.

“This is the place,” Etta said. “Look, there’s a parking spot two houses up.”

 

Unfortunately, the space was fire hydrant adjacent, and they ended up parking a block over. After double-checking his SUV’s locks, Douglas trailed the girls to the party. 

 

They crossed a dead lawn, to rattle a steel security screen. It swung open before them, and there stood Mike Munson, the festivity’s host. His eyes were bloodshot and his posture was slumped, but he brightened in the females’ presence. 

 

“Etta and Karen,” he slurred. “Great to see you. And who’s that you brought with you? Is that…*Douglas Stanton*? Ghost Boy? You actually brought Ghost Boy! That’s classic!”

 

“Good to be here,” Douglas muttered sarcastically, but Mike had already turned away. 

 

“Follow me, you guys. We’ve got a keg of Newcastle in the backyard.”

 

As they navigated through the townhouse, Douglas saw his fellow students clustered in the dining area, kitchen and living room. Some pointed him out to other revelers, mocking him in subdued voices. He’d have to devise an escape plan, he decided, before their mockery segued into drunken bullying.

 

Half-remembered faces, thinned from shed baby fat, turned to regard him. Douglas saw Marty McGuire and Kevin Jones, who’d both transferred to Vista High School rather than East Pacific. He saw Justine Brubaker and Esmeralda Carrera, the latter of whom stood surrounded by potential suitors. Trampling over cigarette butts and spilled-beer puddles, in a fetid atmosphere redolent with vomit, he absorbed every detail. 

 

On an afghan-covered sofa, two chubby girls tongue-wrestled, cheered on by an audience of drooling jocks. Two shirtless Samoans wrestled on the floor below them, unnoticed by most. Douglas even saw a few men in their mid-thirties, clinging to youth delusions as they propositioned underage teenagers.  

 

In the backyard, Mike pulled three plastic cups from a keg-proximate bag. “Ladies drink free,” he announced. “That’ll be five bucks, Douglas.”

 

“I’m the designated driver,” Douglas muttered, waving the cup away.

 

“Designated bitch is more like it,” Mike sneered. 

 

The keg nestled in an ice-filled trashcan, surrounded by dazed celebrants. Etta and Karen found their cups quickly filled, and began to sip politely. Douglas knew that soon they’d begin circulating the party, abandoning him to his own devices. Before they could leave, he lightly touched Etta’s elbow and asked her when Missy was coming. 

 

“Yeah, I called her earlier. It turns out she’s staying in tonight.”

 

“What?”

 

“I’m only kidding, man. You should’ve seen your face just now; it was like I kicked your scrotum. Missy will be here any minute, don’t worry. Meanwhile, why don’t you relax a little? Want me to ask around, see if anyone thinks you’re cute?”

 

“No, thanks.”

 

“Are you sure? Some girls are actually attracted to quiet loners. It’s not like you’re hideously deformed or anything.”

 

“I’m alright.”

 

“If you say so.” Etta took a long gulp of Newcastle, and then said, “Anyway, it’s been fun talkin’ with you—fun like a case of chickenpox—but it’s time for Karen and me to mingle. You wanna make the rounds with us?”

 

“No…that’s okay. I’ll catch up with you gals later, I guess.”

 

Etta dragged Karen into the house. Beer sloshed over their cup rims to splatter the back patio. Douglas shuffled his feet, stared into the sky, and shrugged his shoulders, wishing to be anywhere else. Then Kevin rushed into the backyard, his face flushed under vibrant red hair, shouting, “Dude, Starla’s in the bathroom puking right now!” 

 

“Please tell me that bitch is at least making it into the toilet,” Mike responded, slumped over the keg. 

 

“Mostly, but there’s definitely some side spray. She’ll be passed out on the floor any minute.”

 

“Then we’ll have our way with her!” Mike shouted, eliciting cheers from most of the assembled males. “I don’t care if she’s got puke running down her ass crack, that chick is fine as fuck!”

 

Since his arrival, Douglas had been uncannily aware of the vox populi judging and belittling him. Now he heard the voice of the people change its target, shifting its crosshairs toward Starla. Male, female, and less identifiable vocalizations converged, making sport of the nauseous beauty: 

 

“She’s such a whore.”

 

“I heard that her cousin molested her.”

 

“I fucked her last year, and she didn’t even remember me two days later.”

 

“And she has the nerve to be so stuck up. Get over yourself, girl.”

 

“Dude, I’d drink her bathwater.”

 

Douglas wondered if he should be glad they’d forgotten him—if only momentarily. Starla had always been a bitch, and it seemed that karma had finally circled around to bite her on the ass. But all that he could muster was resigned melancholy. 

 

As he stepped back into the house, a new odor met his nostrils: a sweet, skunky fragrance. He saw a cloud-like haze drifting beneath the ceiling, heard harsh coughing emanating from the living room. Intrigued, he followed the cannabis aroma.  

 

The possible lesbians had left the sofa, as had their audience. Wilting upon it now were Corey Pfeiffer, Marty McGuire, Etta, Karen, and some guy Douglas didn’t recognize. On the coffee table, a freezer bag two-thirds filled with marijuana yawned. Drawing closer, Douglas saw orange and purple hairs interspersed throughout each weed nugget.  

 

Karen sat frigid, arms crossed, shoulders drawn up to her earlobes. It was obvious that the weed made her uncomfortable, and only Etta’s presence kept her rooted in place. The other couch-dwellers displayed none of this averseness, however, with easy grins and lidded eyes being their predominant facial features. Among them, a tall glass bong circulated, pausing only for intermittent bowl refills. 

 

Corey blew out a lungful, registered Douglas’ presence, and peppered his cough attack with laughter. “Holy shit,” he managed to choke out, elbowing Etta playfully. “You said he was here, but I thought you were fuckin’ with me. Get the fuck over here, Douglas, and shake my hand.”

 

Warily, Douglas approached. He found his hand engulfed in Corey’s massive paw, pumping vigorously up and down.

 

“Do you smoke, man?” Corey asked. “My cousin just brought this shit down from Humboldt. Dude, you won’t find anything better in all of SoCal. If you’re already seein’ ghosts, who knows what it’ll make you see?”

 

The couch-dwellers burst into laughter paroxysms, knocking against each other like glass bottles in a backpack. When they finally subsided, Douglas told Corey, “I don’t usually smoke, but I could give it a try.”

 

“What?” Etta cried out. “Really? You?”

 

“Sure. It’s only weed. Don’t act like you four are living on the edge.”

 

“Big words,” Marty chimed in. “Load him up, Corey.”

 

A fresh nugget went into the bowl. Douglas found himself staring into a resinous glass tube, at fragrant black water churning malignantly. Karen disappeared toward the bathroom, so he claimed her vacant sofa space.     

 

“Here’s to the ganja deities,” the stranger declared, lifting his index toward the ceiling. Douglas wrote him off as just another blowhard playing at profundity—the latest in a long succession stretching back to time’s dawning—but the others cheered. 

 

Shrugging, Douglas placed his mouth to the glass, flicked the Bic, and inhaled. The herb became a miniature inferno, a lovely little fire blossom. He drew deeply, held it for half a minute, and exhaled without coughing. 

 

“I never thought I’d see this,” Marty commented, reaching for the bong. In a giggly drawl, Etta seconded the statement.  

 

But Douglas had *some* familiarity with drugs. He’d treaded in the memory forms of many users, deep in the Phantom Cabinet’s dream wisps. Therein, he’d experienced the whole gamut of intoxicants: weed, amphetamines, smack, Ecstasy, cacti, LSD, and the fever visions of government lab rats, whose mad, later abandoned drug strains left them drooling vegetables, or sometimes killed them outright. Though his own lungs were unscarred, Douglas wasn’t as sheltered as his peers liked to imagine.

 

The bong circulated for a while, with Douglas lingering in the rotation. Despite his earlier reservations, he *was*beginning to enjoy himself, sinking into a loose camaraderie that he hadn’t felt since those bygone days with Emmett and Benjy. He no longer cared who made fun of him, or if Missy ever actually showed up. Instead, he became absorbed in the stereo-blasted hip-hop, head bobbing to its bass-heavy beat. 

 

Time blinked, and he realized that the others were gone, along with their glassware and weed. In their place was a beautiful girl, whom he slowly identified as Esmeralda Carrere. Sporting an unreadable expression, she sat mere inches away.   

 

Douglas had never spoken to Esmeralda, had been content to admire her from afar, stolen glances across campus hallways and classrooms. With her smoky green eyes turned upon him, he found himself drowning in desire, confusion and outright terror, grasping for words to say. 

 

At last, he managed to choke out, “Nice party, isn’t it?”

 

“You could say that,” she replied, somewhat sarcastically. 

 

“My name’s Douglas, in case you didn’t know.”

 

“Of course I remember you. You’re practically a celebrity around these parts. Just tonight, I’ve heard *all kinds* of stories about you.”

 

“So they were talking about me. I knew it.”

 

“Boring people love to denigrate others. Why do you think I broke away to come visit you?”

 

“*Denigrate*? That’s a big word for a pretty girl.” 

 

“I’m in Advanced Placement; there’s no need to stereotype me.” 

 

“Sorry.”

 

“You seem a little twitchy, Douglas. Do I make you nervous?”

 

“A little bit,” he admitted sheepishly. 

 

“Good. That means you won’t bullshit me when I ask you this question—not if you know what’s good for you.” 

 

“What’s the question?” he asked, responding to her brazenness. 

 

“I was wondering if it’s true what they say about you. Do you really see ghosts?”

 

After a protracted pause, Douglas answered, “If I did, why would I tell ya? You’ll just laugh about it with your friends later.”

 

Her face contracted in mock annoyance. “No, I won’t do that. My grandma used to talk about ghosts all the time, how she’d been visited by loved ones weeks after they died. Whatever you tell me will be our little secret, I promise.”

 

Douglas exhaled deeply. His thoughts were in disarray: half of them wanting to trust Esmeralda, the other half marking her as an enemy. Against his better judgment, he said, “Yeah, it’s true. I’ve been seeing ghosts all my life. They appear in mirrors, puddles, and sometimes in three-dimensional space. Sometimes I can’t even see ’em, just objects moving by themselves. Occasionally, they talk to me.”

 

“Wow. What do they say?”

 

“It depends on the ghost. Most of them just want to bitch about the coldness of the grave, or whine about their deaths. You know, *Ghost Whisperer*\-type shit. I’ve only known one who could hold a decent conversation. He was an astronaut, if you can believe that.”

 

“An astronaut. Now you’re just messing with me.”

 

Douglas held up an open palm. “Hand to God, I’m telling you the complete, unvarnished truth. His name was Commander Frank Gordon, and he died on a freakin’ space shuttle. I thought he was my best friend, until we had a falling out.”

 

“See, I knew you’d be interesting to talk to. Tell me, how does someone have a falling out with a ghost?”

 

“You can ask, but I won’t tell ya. Let’s just say that Gordon wants me to act against my own best interests, and leave it at that.”

 

Esmeralda’s forehead creased. Leaning forward, she practically whispered, “Hey, Douglas, what was the scariest ghost you ever met?”

 

He opened his mouth, preparing to describe the porcelain-masked entity and all of her multifaceted agonies, when Mike burst into the room. 

 

“We’ve got margaritas in the kitchen!” he shouted. “Come grab a glass!” Mike could barely clutch his own drink, tilting it to spill yellow sludge upon the carpet, which trailed him into the backyard.

 

“Those will be going fast,” Esmeralda remarked. “We’ll finish our convo in a second.” 

 

Douglas followed her into the kitchen, watching her tight ass swish back and forth in a practically painted-on miniskirt. It was an enjoyable sight, provoking a sudden shift in his nether region.   

 

He didn’t know what was happening. Did Esmeralda’s sudden interest denote sexual attraction, or just pity? Should he try to kiss her, or at least put his arm around her? Fear and exhilaration battled within his psyche, like Godzilla fighting Megalon. 

 

In the kitchen, a leaking blender perched upon cracked marble countertop. Shouldering her way through intoxicated teenagers, Esmeralda grabbed a margarita glass. She salted its rim and poured out a generous helping of yellow cocktail. 

 

“Want one?” she asked Douglas.

 

“I’m driving.” 

 

Sipping, she replied, “That’s too bad, it’s really yummy. Anyhow, let’s go back to the couch and you can tell me more ghost stories.”

 

Eye-roving from her heart-shaped face to her breast-swollen halter top, Douglas said, “I can’t think of a single thing I’d rather do.”

 

“Enthusiasm, I like it.”

 

This time, Douglas led the way to the living room. He spotted someone on the sofa and his heart sank. Realizing the interloper’s identity, he damn near cried. Missy Peterson had finally arrived.

 

“I’m sorry, but I promised that I’d talk to Missy tonight,” he whispered confidentially. “She’s been seeing ghosts, too, and needs some advice. Can we finish this later?”

 

Esmeralda pouted. “You’d rather talk to that skank than me?”

 

“Fuck no. But I’d rather not break my promise, if I don’t have to. It won’t take long.”

 

“*Okay*, Douglas, come find me when you’re finished. Hey, before I go, can I ask one last thing?”

 

“Go for it.”

 

She asked, “Have you ever seen any ectoplasm?”

 

“Ectoplasm?”

 

“Yeah, you know, it’s like ghost jism. In movies, they’re always talking about it. Wherever there’s a ghost, it leaves slimy white goop behind.”

 

“Sorry, but I don’t think that’s a real thing. At least, I’ve never seen any. There’s been plenty of green fog, though.”

 

“Oh,” she said, disappointed. “Well, I guess that’s *something*.” After kissing him lightly on the cheek, she flitted away, taking Douglas’ good cheer as a keepsake.  

 

Annoyed, he turned to Missy, noting her shabby appearance. Her face was puffy, her nose red and crusted. Her hair looked as if it had gone weeks without water and brush, and she hadn’t even applied makeup. In a baggy sweatshirt and ugly mustard-yellow capris, she exuded misery from every pore.

 

Stepping into her wretched miasma, Douglas collapsed onto the sofa, carefully keeping a cushion between them. “You wanted to talk to me?” he asked.

 

Sniffing back errant snot, she wailed, “Please, you have to help me. They killed my sister, and now they’re coming to get me. I don’t know what to do.”

 

“Who killed your sister?” Douglas asked, fearing that he already knew the answer. 

 

“The spirits did. I think it was the shadow man. He’s the one who showed me her corpse.”

 

“Shadow man? I heard your sister killed herself, that she slashed her wrists open and bled to death.”

 

“Then…then why was her hair all white? You, of all people, know ghosts are real. What, you think you’re the only one they visit?”

 

Douglas let the question hang for a minute. In the face of her wretchedness, his weed influence abated. Uncomfortably sober, he wished that Missy would just go away, before his entire night was ruined. 

 

“Okay, Missy, let’s pretend I believe you. *You’re seeing ghosts.* Terrifying stuff, to be certain, but what the hell do you expect me to do about it? Do I look like a fuckin’ Ghostbuster? Am I wearing a proton pack?”

 

“I just…I just thought…” Her sentence devolved into sobbing.

 

Some small segment of Douglas rejoiced in her misery, reasoning that she’d never been particularly kind to him. But he wasn’t truly malicious, and thus moved to comfort. Placing an arm around Missy—wincing at her pungent clamminess—he said, “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have put it like that. But the sad fact is, while I am familiar with ghosts, I have no idea how to get rid of the bastards. The best advice I can give you is to stand up to them, to let them know you’re not afraid. Maybe they’ll go away afterward.”

 

“I was afraid you’d say that,” Missy moaned, leaping from the couch to sprint away, sobbing. 

 

Douglas felt guilty, knowing of his own deception. He knew that courage wouldn’t diffuse a haunting; the very thought was ludicrous. Only one thing would ensure the girl’s peace of mind—his own death—and he had no plans to clue Missy in to that little tidbit. In her mind state, she was liable to come after him with a firearm. 

 

He set off to find Esmeralda. Unable to locate her in the backyard, kitchen or garage, he was considering checking the bedrooms when Etta strutted up determinately. 

 

“What the hell did you say to her, Douglas? She’s in the goddamn bathtub right now, next to a passed-out Starla, crying uncontrollably. Missy was better off before she came here.”

 

“Yeah…about that. Listen, Etta, I tried to help her, but what was I supposed to say? Was I supposed to tell her that everything is fine and dandy, when it obviously isn’t? If she’s really being haunted, then there’s nothing I can do about it…nothing *she* can do about it.”

 

“I guess there was no reason to invite you, after all,” she hissed. “Anyway, Karen and I will be riding home with Missy, so I’ll see you around. Thanks for nothin’.” 

 

Douglas watched her stride away, and then resumed his search for Esmeralda. In the scattered face assortment, hers remained elusive. Finally, he pulled Kevin Jones aside and asked if he’d seen her.

 

“Yeah, dude, she took off with one of those older guys. You didn’t really think you had a chance with her, did you?”

 

With no reason to remain, Douglas left the cacophony behind, driving home with Esmeralda never far from his thoughts. 

 

As for the girl in question, she emerged from Mike’s parents’ bathroom—which, unlike the other, had yet to be splashed with regurgitant—a few minutes later. Throughout his search, she’d been checking her hair and makeup, gargling with a bottle of purse Scope. Learning of Douglas’ departure, she could scarcely hide her disappointment.   

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Upon solar winds, a green wisp traveled, emanating from no known point of origin. Against a star-speckled backdrop, it twisted and twirled, sporting features almost recognizable as human. 

 

The specter glided amidst space junk, floating in a graveyard orbit, a lonely supersynchronous course just beyond operational range. Bypassing spent rocket stages and collision fragments, it passed within a defunct communications satellite, breaching the aluminum shell, spreading its consciousness throughout the structure. 

 

Solar panels long dormant sprang back to life, converting sun energy into electricity. The on-board processors endured similar revivification, followed by the propulsion, communications, thermal control and altitude control systems. Now only the telemetry and command system remained offline, preventing the earthbound living from monitoring and guiding the device. 

 

Unbeknownst to NORAD, the first satellite haunting had proven successful. The dead had new tools with which to spread terror, knocking the existential status quo off its axis. Soon, a green fog was rolling across the cosmos, leaving dozens of similarly resurrected satellites in its wake.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **South Carolina Gamecocks vs. Duke Blue Devils: A Lopsided Shootout or a Miracle in the Desert?**

Let’s parse the numbers first, shall we? The odds here are about as subtle as a 7-foot-tall basketball-shaped neon sign. **South Carolina (-16.5, -1100 implied probability) is the undisputed favorite**, with bookmakers giving the Gamecocks a 96%+ chance to win. Duke (+1300, 7% implied probability) is the sportsbook’s version of a “filler option”—the guy you add to the bracket just to make the math work. The total is set at 132.5 points, which, given South Carolina’s recent **121-49 annihilation of Queens** (yes, *121 points*), feels like asking if rain is likely during a hurricane.

### Parsing the Odds: Why This Feels Like a Foregone Conclusion

South Carolina’s dominance isn’t just statistical—it’s historic. Under Dawn Staley, the Gamecocks just set a program-era scoring record, shooting 66.2% from the field while sending 10 players to the scoreboard. Their offense operates like a Swiss watch: precise, relentless, and utterly unbothered by the concept of “defense.” The spread of -16.5 is generous, considering they outscored Queens by 72 points and have yet to lose this season.

Duke, meanwhile, is the sports equivalent of a group project that forgot half its members. The Blue Devils (3-3) have lost to Baylor, West Virginia, and South Florida—teams that, combined, would make a solid reality TV show about underdog struggles. Their defense? Well, if you want to bet on which team will allow 121 points, Duke’s your girl.

### Digesting the News: Queens of the Court vs. The Blue Devils’ Midlife Crisis

South Carolina enters this game with the swagger of a team that just realized it’s *still* undefeated. Their 24-0 first-quarter run against Queens was so dominant, it made Michael Jordan’s “flu game” look like a Netflix documentary on a coffee break. Stars like Joyce Edwards (25 points in 25 minutes) and Ta’Niya Latson (24 points on 7-of-7 shooting) aren’t just players—they’re offensive artil

An ugly two-tone cracker box, it appeared ready to collapse at the first strong breeze. Loud hip-hop bass thumps rattled its walls. A handful of celebrants stood in the driveway, clutching beer cans. 

 

“This is the place,” Etta said. “Look, there’s a parking spot two houses up.”

 

Unfortunately, the space was fire hydrant adjacent, and they ended up parking a block over. After double-checking his SUV’s locks, Douglas trailed the girls to the party. 

 

They crossed a dead lawn, to rattle a steel security screen. It swung open before them, and there stood Mike Munson, the festivity’s host. His eyes were bloodshot and his posture was slumped, but he brightened in the females’ presence. 

 

“Etta and Karen,” he slurred. “Great to see you. And who’s that you brought with you? Is that…*Douglas Stanton*? Ghost Boy? You actually brought Ghost Boy! That’s classic!”

 

“Good to be here,” Douglas muttered sarcastically, but Mike had already turned away. 

 

“Follow me, you guys. We’ve got a keg of Newcastle in the backyard.”

 

As they navigated through the townhouse, Douglas saw his fellow students clustered in the dining area, kitchen and living room. Some pointed him out to other revelers, mocking him in subdued voices. He’d have to devise an escape plan, he decided, before their mockery segued into drunken bullying.

 

Half-remembered faces, thinned from shed baby fat, turned to regard him. Douglas saw Marty McGuire and Kevin Jones, who’d both transferred to Vista High School rather than East Pacific. He saw Justine Brubaker and Esmeralda Carrera, the latter of whom stood surrounded by potential suitors. Trampling over cigarette butts and spilled-beer puddles, in a fetid atmosphere redolent with vomit, he absorbed every detail. 

 

On an afghan-covered sofa, two chubby girls tongue-wrestled, cheered on by an audience of drooling jocks. Two shirtless Samoans wrestled on the floor below them, unnoticed by most. Douglas even saw a few men in their mid-thirties, clinging to youth delusions as they propositioned underage teenagers.  

 

In the backyard, Mike pulled three plastic cups from a keg-proximate bag. “Ladies drink free,” he announced. “That’ll be five bucks, Douglas.”

 

“I’m the designated driver,” Douglas muttered, waving the cup away.

 

“Designated bitch is more like it,” Mike sneered. 

 

The keg nestled in an ice-filled trashcan, surrounded by dazed celebrants. Etta and Karen found their cups quickly filled, and began to sip politely. Douglas knew that soon they’d begin circulating the party, abandoning him to his own devices. Before they could leave, he lightly touched Etta’s elbow and asked her when Missy was coming. 

 

“Yeah, I called her earlier. It turns out she’s staying in tonight.”

 

“What?”

 

“I’m only kidding, man. You should’ve seen your face just now; it was like I kicked your scrotum. Missy will be here any minute, don’t worry. Meanwhile, why don’t you relax a little? Want me to ask around, see if anyone thinks you’re cute?”

 

“No, thanks.”

 

“Are you sure? Some girls are actually attracted to quiet loners. It’s not like you’re hideously deformed or anything.”

 

“I’m alright.”

 

“If you say so.” Etta took a long gulp of Newcastle, and then said, “Anyway, it’s been fun talkin’ with you—fun like a case of chickenpox—but it’s time for Karen and me to mingle. You wanna make the rounds with us?”

 

“No…that’s okay. I’ll catch up with you gals later, I guess.”

 

Etta dragged Karen into the house. Beer sloshed over their cup rims to splatter the back patio. Douglas shuffled his feet, stared into the sky, and shrugged his shoulders, wishing to be anywhere else. Then Kevin rushed into the backyard, his face flushed under vibrant red hair, shouting, “Dude, Starla’s in the bathroom puking right now!” 

 

“Please tell me that bitch is at least making it into the toilet,” Mike responded, slumped over the keg. 

 

“Mostly, but there’s definitely some side spray. She’ll be passed out on the floor any minute.”

 

“Then we’ll have our way with her!” Mike shouted, eliciting cheers from most of the assembled males. “I don’t care if she’s got puke running down her ass crack, that chick is fine as fuck!”

 

Since his arrival, Douglas had been uncannily aware of the vox populi judging and belittling him. Now he heard the voice of the people change its target, shifting its crosshairs toward Starla. Male, female, and less identifiable vocalizations converged, making sport of the nauseous beauty: 

 

“She’s such a whore.”

 

“I heard that her cousin molested her.”

 

“I fucked her last year, and she didn’t even remember me two days later.”

 

“And she has the nerve to be so stuck up. Get over yourself, girl.”

 

“Dude, I’d drink her bathwater.”

 

Douglas wondered if he should be glad they’d forgotten him—if only momentarily. Starla had always been a bitch, and it seemed that karma had finally circled around to bite her on the ass. But all that he could muster was resigned melancholy. 

 

As he stepped back into the house, a new odor met his nostrils: a sweet, skunky fragrance. He saw a cloud-like haze drifting beneath the ceiling, heard harsh coughing emanating from the living room. Intrigued, he followed the cannabis aroma.  

 

The possible lesbians had left the sofa, as had their audience. Wilting upon it now were Corey Pfeiffer, Marty McGuire, Etta, Karen, and some guy Douglas didn’t recognize. On the coffee table, a freezer bag two-thirds filled with marijuana yawned. Drawing closer, Douglas saw orange and purple hairs interspersed throughout each weed nugget.  

 

Karen sat frigid, arms crossed, shoulders drawn up to her earlobes. It was obvious that the weed made her uncomfortable, and only Etta’s presence kept her rooted in place. The other couch-dwellers displayed none of this averseness, however, with easy grins and lidded eyes being their predominant facial features. Among them, a tall glass bong circulated, pausing only for intermittent bowl refills. 

 

Corey blew out a lungful, registered Douglas’ presence, and peppered his cough attack with laughter. “Holy shit,” he managed to choke out, elbowing Etta playfully. “You said he was here, but I thought you were fuckin’ with me. Get the fuck over here, Douglas, and shake my hand.”

 

Warily, Douglas approached. He found his hand engulfed in Corey’s massive paw, pumping vigorously up and down.

 

“Do you smoke, man?” Corey asked. “My cousin just brought this shit down from Humboldt. Dude, you won’t find anything better in all of SoCal. If you’re already seein’ ghosts, who knows what it’ll make you see?”

 

The couch-dwellers burst into laughter paroxysms, knocking against each other like glass bottles in a backpack. When they finally subsided, Douglas told Corey, “I don’t usually smoke, but I could give it a try.”

 

“What?” Etta cried out. “Really? You?”

 

“Sure. It’s only weed. Don’t act like you four are living on the edge.”

 

“Big words,” Marty chimed in. “Load him up, Corey.”

 

A fresh nugget went into the bowl. Douglas found himself staring into a resinous glass tube, at fragrant black water churning malignantly. Karen disappeared toward the bathroom, so he claimed her vacant sofa space.     

 

“Here’s to the ganja deities,” the stranger declared, lifting his index toward the ceiling. Douglas wrote him off as just another blowhard playing at profundity—the latest in a long succession stretching back to time’s dawning—but the others cheered. 

 

Shrugging, Douglas placed his mouth to the glass, flicked the Bic, and inhaled. The herb became a miniature inferno, a lovely little fire blossom. He drew deeply, held it for half a minute, and exhaled without coughing. 

 

“I never thought I’d see this,” Marty commented, reaching for the bong. In a giggly drawl, Etta seconded the statement.  

 

But Douglas had *some* familiarity with drugs. He’d treaded in the memory forms of many users, deep in the Phantom Cabinet’s dream wisps. Therein, he’d experienced the whole gamut of intoxicants: weed, amphetamines, smack, Ecstasy, cacti, LSD, and the fever visions of government lab rats, whose mad, later abandoned drug strains left them drooling vegetables, or sometimes killed them outright. Though his own lungs were unscarred, Douglas wasn’t as sheltered as his peers liked to imagine.

 

The bong circulated for a while, with Douglas lingering in the rotation. Despite his earlier reservations, he *was*beginning to enjoy himself, sinking into a loose camaraderie that he hadn’t felt since those bygone days with Emmett and Benjy. He no longer cared who made fun of him, or if Missy ever actually showed up. Instead, he became absorbed in the stereo-blasted hip-hop, head bobbing to its bass-heavy beat. 

 

Time blinked, and he realized that the others were gone, along with their glassware and weed. In their place was a beautiful girl, whom he slowly identified as Esmeralda Carrere. Sporting an unreadable expression, she sat mere inches away.   

 

Douglas had never spoken to Esmeralda, had been content to admire her from afar, stolen glances across campus hallways and classrooms. With her smoky green eyes turned upon him, he found himself drowning in desire, confusion and outright terror, grasping for words to say. 

 

At last, he managed to choke out, “Nice party, isn’t it?”

 

“You could say that,” she replied, somewhat sarcastically. 

 

“My name’s Douglas, in case you didn’t know.”

 

“Of course I remember you. You’re practically a celebrity around these parts. Just tonight, I’ve heard *all kinds* of stories about you.”

 

“So they were talking about me. I knew it.”

 

“Boring people love to denigrate others. Why do you think I broke away to come visit you?”

 

“*Denigrate*? That’s a big word for a pretty girl.” 

 

“I’m in Advanced Placement; there’s no need to stereotype me.” 

 

“Sorry.”

 

“You seem a little twitchy, Douglas. Do I make you nervous?”

 

“A little bit,” he admitted sheepishly. 

 

“Good. That means you won’t bullshit me when I ask you this question—not if you know what’s good for you.” 

 

“What’s the question?” he asked, responding to her brazenness. 

 

“I was wondering if it’s true what they say about you. Do you really see ghosts?”

 

After a protracted pause, Douglas answered, “If I did, why would I tell ya? You’ll just laugh about it with your friends later.”

 

Her face contracted in mock annoyance. “No, I won’t do that. My grandma used to talk about ghosts all the time, how she’d been visited by loved ones weeks after they died. Whatever you tell me will be our little secret, I promise.”

 

Douglas exhaled deeply. His thoughts were in disarray: half of them wanting to trust Esmeralda, the other half marking her as an enemy. Against his better judgment, he said, “Yeah, it’s true. I’ve been seeing ghosts all my life. They appear in mirrors, puddles, and sometimes in three-dimensional space. Sometimes I can’t even see ’em, just objects moving by themselves. Occasionally, they talk to me.”

 

“Wow. What do they say?”

 

“It depends on the ghost. Most of them just want to bitch about the coldness of the grave, or whine about their deaths. You know, *Ghost Whisperer*\-type shit. I’ve only known one who could hold a decent conversation. He was an astronaut, if you can believe that.”

 

“An astronaut. Now you’re just messing with me.”

 

Douglas held up an open palm. “Hand to God, I’m telling you the complete, unvarnished truth. His name was Commander Frank Gordon, and he died on a freakin’ space shuttle. I thought he was my best friend, until we had a falling out.”

 

“See, I knew you’d be interesting to talk to. Tell me, how does someone have a falling out with a ghost?”

 

“You can ask, but I won’t tell ya. Let’s just say that Gordon wants me to act against my own best interests, and leave it at that.”

 

Esmeralda’s forehead creased. Leaning forward, she practically whispered, “Hey, Douglas, what was the scariest ghost you ever met?”

 

He opened his mouth, preparing to describe the porcelain-masked entity and all of her multifaceted agonies, when Mike burst into the room. 

 

“We’ve got margaritas in the kitchen!” he shouted. “Come grab a glass!” Mike could barely clutch his own drink, tilting it to spill yellow sludge upon the carpet, which trailed him into the backyard.

 

“Those will be going fast,” Esmeralda remarked. “We’ll finish our convo in a second.” 

 

Douglas followed her into the kitchen, watching her tight ass swish back and forth in a practically painted-on miniskirt. It was an enjoyable sight, provoking a sudden shift in his nether region.   

 

He didn’t know what was happening. Did Esmeralda’s sudden interest denote sexual attraction, or just pity? Should he try to kiss her, or at least put his arm around her? Fear and exhilaration battled within his psyche, like Godzilla fighting Megalon. 

 

In the kitchen, a leaking blender perched upon cracked marble countertop. Shouldering her way through intoxicated teenagers, Esmeralda grabbed a margarita glass. She salted its rim and poured out a generous helping of yellow cocktail. 

 

“Want one?” she asked Douglas.

 

“I’m driving.” 

 

Sipping, she replied, “That’s too bad, it’s really yummy. Anyhow, let’s go back to the couch and you can tell me more ghost stories.”

 

Eye-roving from her heart-shaped face to her breast-swollen halter top, Douglas said, “I can’t think of a single thing I’d rather do.”

 

“Enthusiasm, I like it.”

 

This time, Douglas led the way to the living room. He spotted someone on the sofa and his heart sank. Realizing the interloper’s identity, he damn near cried. Missy Peterson had finally arrived.

 

“I’m sorry, but I promised that I’d talk to Missy tonight,” he whispered confidentially. “She’s been seeing ghosts, too, and needs some advice. Can we finish this later?”

 

Esmeralda pouted. “You’d rather talk to that skank than me?”

 

“Fuck no. But I’d rather not break my promise, if I don’t have to. It won’t take long.”

 

“*Okay*, Douglas, come find me when you’re finished. Hey, before I go, can I ask one last thing?”

 

“Go for it.”

 

She asked, “Have you ever seen any ectoplasm?”

 

“Ectoplasm?”

 

“Yeah, you know, it’s like ghost jism. In movies, they’re always talking about it. Wherever there’s a ghost, it leaves slimy white goop behind.”

 

“Sorry, but I don’t think that’s a real thing. At least, I’ve never seen any. There’s been plenty of green fog, though.”

 

“Oh,” she said, disappointed. “Well, I guess that’s *something*.” After kissing him lightly on the cheek, she flitted away, taking Douglas’ good cheer as a keepsake.  

 

Annoyed, he turned to Missy, noting her shabby appearance. Her face was puffy, her nose red and crusted. Her hair looked as if it had gone weeks without water and brush, and she hadn’t even applied makeup. In a baggy sweatshirt and ugly mustard-yellow capris, she exuded misery from every pore.

 

Stepping into her wretched miasma, Douglas collapsed onto the sofa, carefully keeping a cushion between them. “You wanted to talk to me?” he asked.

 

Sniffing back errant snot, she wailed, “Please, you have to help me. They killed my sister, and now they’re coming to get me. I don’t know what to do.”

 

“Who killed your sister?” Douglas asked, fearing that he already knew the answer. 

 

“The spirits did. I think it was the shadow man. He’s the one who showed me her corpse.”

 

“Shadow man? I heard your sister killed herself, that she slashed her wrists open and bled to death.”

 

“Then…then why was her hair all white? You, of all people, know ghosts are real. What, you think you’re the only one they visit?”

 

Douglas let the question hang for a minute. In the face of her wretchedness, his weed influence abated. Uncomfortably sober, he wished that Missy would just go away, before his entire night was ruined. 

 

“Okay, Missy, let’s pretend I believe you. *You’re seeing ghosts.* Terrifying stuff, to be certain, but what the hell do you expect me to do about it? Do I look like a fuckin’ Ghostbuster? Am I wearing a proton pack?”

 

“I just…I just thought…” Her sentence devolved into sobbing.

 

Some small segment of Douglas rejoiced in her misery, reasoning that she’d never been particularly kind to him. But he wasn’t truly malicious, and thus moved to comfort. Placing an arm around Missy—wincing at her pungent clamminess—he said, “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have put it like that. But the sad fact is, while I am familiar with ghosts, I have no idea how to get rid of the bastards. The best advice I can give you is to stand up to them, to let them know you’re not afraid. Maybe they’ll go away afterward.”

 

“I was afraid you’d say that,” Missy moaned, leaping from the couch to sprint away, sobbing. 

 

Douglas felt guilty, knowing of his own deception. He knew that courage wouldn’t diffuse a haunting; the very thought was ludicrous. Only one thing would ensure the girl’s peace of mind—his own death—and he had no plans to clue Missy in to that little tidbit. In her mind state, she was liable to come after him with a firearm. 

 

He set off to find Esmeralda. Unable to locate her in the backyard, kitchen or garage, he was considering checking the bedrooms when Etta strutted up determinately. 

 

“What the hell did you say to her, Douglas? She’s in the goddamn bathtub right now, next to a passed-out Starla, crying uncontrollably. Missy was better off before she came here.”

 

“Yeah…about that. Listen, Etta, I tried to help her, but what was I supposed to say? Was I supposed to tell her that everything is fine and dandy, when it obviously isn’t? If she’s really being haunted, then there’s nothing I can do about it…nothing *she* can do about it.”

 

“I guess there was no reason to invite you, after all,” she hissed. “Anyway, Karen and I will be riding home with Missy, so I’ll see you around. Thanks for nothin’.” 

 

Douglas watched her stride away, and then resumed his search for Esmeralda. In the scattered face assortment, hers remained elusive. Finally, he pulled Kevin Jones aside and asked if he’d seen her.

 

“Yeah, dude, she took off with one of those older guys. You didn’t really think you had a chance with her, did you?”

 

With no reason to remain, Douglas left the cacophony behind, driving home with Esmeralda never far from his thoughts. 

 

As for the girl in question, she emerged from Mike’s parents’ bathroom—which, unlike the other, had yet to be splashed with regurgitant—a few minutes later. Throughout his search, she’d been checking her hair and makeup, gargling with a bottle of purse Scope. Learning of Douglas’ departure, she could scarcely hide her disappointment.

Upon solar winds, a green wisp traveled, emanating from no known point of origin. Against a star-speckled backdrop, it twisted and twirled, sporting features almost recognizable as human. 

 

The specter glided amidst space junk, floating in a graveyard orbit, a lonely supersynchronous course just beyond operational range. Bypassing spent rocket stages and collision fragments, it passed within a defunct communications satellite, breaching the aluminum shell, spreading its consciousness throughout the structure. 

 

Solar panels long dormant sprang back to life, converting sun energy into electricity. The on-board processors endured similar revivification, followed by the propulsion, communications, thermal control and altitude control systems. Now only the telemetry and command system remained offline, preventing the earthbound living from monitoring and guiding the device. 

 

Unbeknownst to NORAD, the first satellite haunting had proven successful. The dead had new tools with which to spread terror, knocking the existential status quo off its axis. Soon, a green fog was rolling across the cosmos, leaving dozens of similarly resurrected satellites in its wake.

I’d wake up, scroll my phone, wander around, make coffee, think about starting, talk myself out of starting, then feel guilty for not doing a thing.  
It wasn’t laziness. It was drift.

Drift feels harmless at first.  
You don’t notice it until the day slips away.

The real issue was I kept telling myself I’d “figure it out” once I felt ready.  
But that moment never came.  
Stress did. Every day.

What I didn’t see was how much energy I wasted thinking about the work instead of doing the work.  
Dragging the same unfinished tasks forward made every morning feel heavier.

Then a friend hit me with a question I couldn’t dodge:  
“If you already know what you need to do, why do you keep negotiating with yourself every morning?”

That one line cracked something open.  
My problem wasn’t motivation.  
It was permission.  
I kept giving myself options I didn’t need.

I ended up writing about this in [NoFluffWisdom](https://NoFluffWisdom.com/subscribe) because so many people were stuck in the same loop, hoping today would magically go better than yesterday.

So I built one rule that changed everything:

When I wake up, I don’t check anything until my first task is done.  
I never sit down without knowing the exact next action.  
If I pause, I restart with a 5 minute timer, not a debate.  
If I plan the day, I follow the plan. No edits after 9 am.  
And if I slip, I reset fast instead of spiraling.

The first week felt strange.  
The second week felt lighter.  
By the third, my mornings felt quiet for the first time in years, like the noise finally stepped aside.

What changed wasn’t who I am.  
It was removing the part of my day where I used to stall and pretend it didn’t matter.

Here is what I did:

-Tracked all of my macros, fiber, and saturated fat intake on MyFitnessPal. I’ve been tracking for years but never paid attention to fiber/sat fat. 

I kept saturated fat <10 most days and fiber 40+ most days. Before this I was eating lots of cheese and some butter in which I pretty much cut out and swapped with olive oil or fat free cheese. 

Ive been eating overnight oats every day (60g bobs protein oats, 120g of Fairlife fat free milk, 15g of chia seeds, and a cup of blueberries. Great way to get fiber in.

I’ve been limiting sugar and using a tablespoon of Trader Joe’s sweet cream in my coffee it only has 0.5g of sat fat per serving. Yasso Greek yogurt bars have been a great dessert. 

Lastly I’ve been incorporating more veggies into every meal and swapping white flour for whole grains in things such as bread, pasta. Chickpea pasta has been good for protein and fiber. 

I’m super happy with these results!! If you guys have any more questions I’d be happy to answer. *I am not a dietician or nutritionist* but I am an RN!

I’m 25, somewhere between figuring out life and falling in love with everything it keeps teaching me. My days usually start with coffee that’s way too strong, a playlist that’s way too soft, and a quiet hope that something interesting might happen. Most days are normal. Some days feel magical for no reason at all. And recently, I realized that the simple magic of life feels even better when you have someone to share it with.

I’m not looking for perfection or a fairy-tale princess just someone warm, cute, and genuine. Someone who laughs at weird jokes, someone who doesn’t mind spontaneous plans or slow walks, someone who wants connection that feels easy, honest and fun.

Maybe we meet for a cute coffee date where we both pretend to be coffee experts even though we’re not. Maybe we talk about the most random things until it feels like we’ve known each other longer than we actually have. Maybe we plan a small adventure sunset, street food a bookstore date or just sitting somewhere quiet while the city moves around us.

I’m a listener, a sometimes-overthinker, a good-vibes person, and the type who appreciates the little things more than expensive ones. I want to meet someone who’s kind, sweet, and open to seeing where things go not rushing, not forcing… just two people meeting and letting something natural grow.

If you’re someone who believes that the best dates are simple but full of good energy, then maybe this was meant to reach you.

1p7ctm9,https://foundationsfamchiro.com/,Prioritizing Body Awareness: Gentle Care During Busy Seasons,"The calendar pages fly by, filled with events, deadlines, and the non-stop energy of busy seasons. Whether you are navigating the end-of-year rush, a flurry of family activities, or a particularly demanding project at work, the extra demands can significantly impact your daily comfort and overall sense of wellness. It's during these times, when our schedules feel most packed and our attention is pulled in a dozen different directions, that it becomes easy to let self-care slide. We often push past fatigue, ignore early signs of tension, and postpone essential wellness habits. Yet, the irony is that this is precisely when consistent support for your body and **nervous system support** is most needed.

This post will explore how maintaining **posture and alignment** and keeping up with **wellness habits** can serve as an anchoring presence when life speeds up. It is not about adding another stressful item to your to-do list; it is about recognizing that supporting your physical function is a key element of navigating busy seasons with greater ease and resilience.

# Why Prioritizing Body Awareness Matters When Life Gets Hectic

During busy times, our bodies are often put under greater physical and mental stress. Think about the increase in sitting time as you work to meet deadlines, the changes in your sleep schedule, or the sheer volume of tasks that require you to be ""on"" all the time. This constant state of activity can lead to changes in your **mobility and movement**. We might adopt hurried postures, tense our shoulders without realizing it, or rush through tasks, all of which contribute to an overall sense of physical burden.

The cumulative effect of these daily demands is significant. When your body is continuously compensating for poor **workplace ergonomics** or a lack of mindful movement, it uses up valuable energy. By making a conscious choice to prioritize **everyday body support**, you are not just reacting to discomfort; you are actively creating a foundation of physical resilience. A proactive, **holistic lifestyle** approach helps you stay aware of your body’s signals and respond to them gently, rather than waiting until a minor issue becomes a major hurdle. This proactive approach is central to supporting the functional capacity of your body and your overall **nervous system support**.

# Actionable Strategies for Stress and Body Support

You do not need an overhaul of your routine to make a positive impact during busy seasons. Small, intentional adjustments can make a big difference in maintaining your **posture and alignment** and supporting your body's function.

* **The 2-Minute Movement Break:** Set a timer to stand up and move every 30 to 45 minutes, even on your busiest days. Do not just walk to the kitchen; perform a gentle movement like arm circles, a few slow neck rotations, or a simple standing hip swing. This is a powerful antidote to prolonged sitting and a simple form of **self-care for busy families**.
* **Mindful Posture Reset:** Periodically check in with your posture, especially when you are concentrating on a screen. Notice if your head is pushed forward, your back is rounded, or your jaw is clenched. Gently correct your posture by imagining a string pulling the crown of your head upward. A quick, subtle reset of your physical alignment can also serve as a mental break, supporting the **stress + nervous system** connection.
* **Hydration Check:** Busy seasons often come with an increase in dehydrating beverages (like extra coffee). Keep a large water bottle visible at your workspace as a continuous visual reminder. Proper hydration is a fundamental component of tissue flexibility and overall **wellness habits**.
* **The Gentle Evening Unwind:** Before bed, dedicate 5 to 10 minutes to slow, purposeful deep breathing and gentle stretching. This is not a workout; it is a time to release the physical and mental tension accumulated throughout the day. This ritual signals to your body that it is time to transition from high-gear to rest, promoting better sleep quality and continued **nervous system support**.
* **Optimize Your Sleep Environment:** Consistent sleep is often the first thing to suffer when schedules are full. Even if you cannot get more hours, focus on the quality. Ensure your sleeping surface and pillow support your neck and back alignment, and commit to a consistent lights-out time, even on weekends.

# Understanding Gentle Chiropractic Techniques

Chiropractic care focuses on supporting the body's functional capacity. The goal is to enhance the communication within your body, supporting its natural ability to adapt to the many stressors of daily life.

The approach we use at Foundations Family Chiropractic is neurologically-focused and centers on gentle, specific contact points. This is not about forceful movement but about providing input to the nervous system. Our focus is on supporting a state of ease and awareness in the body, which is especially beneficial when you are under increased pressure during busy seasons.

The **Torque Release Technique (overview only)** is an example of a specific, **gentle chiropractic technique** that falls under this philosophy. It uses light contacts to encourage the body to release tension and improve overall function. This non-invasive method aims to help your body manage the demands of the environment by supporting the natural communication pathways within. Many people who seek a **chiropractor in Surrey** or a **chiropractor in Langley** find that this gentle approach integrates well into their existing routine for **family wellness** and **holistic lifestyle** goals.

1p7ct5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1p7ct5o/hr_the_ash_plague/,[HR] The Ash Plague,"(I wrote this for a contest on Writing Battle, so if anyone is on there too, yes, I am Daphne Hardwood there and I do have the original file to prove it.)

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

It all started with a dare, a silly childish bet. Run through the graveyard, find the columbarium, find THE urn, and steal it. The urn of the supposed town psychic, Mathilda. 

Mathilda was well known for her visions, they had brought prosperity to the town. She had correctly led the little community through economic collapse, through outbreaks of disease and through harvests that would have led to famine. All until the day she misinterpreted a vision. 

She had foretold the beloved mayor and his wife would successfully have twins within a year. The mayor's young wife had gotten pregnant quickly, with a double fertilized ectopic pregnancy. The mayor and wife refused to consider Mathilda could have been wrong and so she never sought treatment. Her fallopian tube ruptured, she and the embryos died. And the mayor, in his grief, set a mob on Mathilda. 

Mathilda had been an old woman by then, unable to run. And when the mob tore her apart, she cursed them. If anyone dared disturb her rest, a plague the likes of which no one had ever seen would descend on the town. The mob didn't care much at first, literally tearing this poor old woman to shreds. Her students were the only townsfolk who didn't join in. And when the crowd was finished, those students gathered her remains, cremated them and set her ashes in a beautiful urn. 

The urn, decorated by a cascading pattern of blue glass adhered to the surface, sat in a place high above the ground, where it was hard to reach, but sunlight hit the glass and made it shine. There had been a brief scare after the urn was bumped and the lid came slightly loose once, and a flu had knocked out the entire town for a week. So the urn has been moved to a safer space, where Mathilda would not be disturbed. 

And the story was told to all the children, Do Not Disturb Mathilda’s Rest. The flu had been particularly brutal to those who had been involved in Mathilda's death, with the person responsible for the final blow actually dying from it, suffocating on his own aspirated vomit as he slept. 

But…. Children will be children and they made up their own legends, and their own dares. 

Go touch the urn.

Call out for Mathilda.

Go STEAL the urn. 

And finally, one little idiot did it. He snuck to the columbarium and grabbed the urn just after midnight on Halloween, because what possible better time could there be to steal a cursed urn, right? And he immediately sprinted back to show his prize to his little idiot friends. 

They had all laughed at the thrill, the triumph and had strolled into the town’s 24 hour diner with it to celebrate their success. Somehow, while they ate their celebratory burgers and fries and slurped milkshakes in various flavors, Mathilda's ashes spilled. All over the food. The thing is the little idiots didn't realize it until they looked over and saw the tipped over urn and the dust on their plates. All reacted predictably, gagging and making a scene. But it was too late. 

One by one over the next week, each boy got sick. The kind of sick you don't come back from. They would have burning fevers that slowly fried their brains as hospital staff tried desperately to lower the fevers. Bouts of vomiting that all looked like coffee grounds. And finally, after days of fevers and vomiting, they would pass into a coma. And die within 24 hours. The town was devastated by the loss but had no understanding, yet, of what could have happened to these boys. 

Until someone noticed the lack of brilliantly shining blue in the columbarium. Until the cracked pieces of the urn were found out behind the diner from where the boys had tried to hide the evidence. Until one of the boys stumbled out of the morgue, skin grey and eyes milky and he'd pounded on the first person he saw, tearing into flesh. And the other boys had followed. Attacking. Biting. Feasting. Infecting. 

Mathilda's curse had taken hold. And the Ash Plague will leave no survivors.",1,1764175908.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

He had been sprinting from person to person in the terminal, and dollar bills were falling out of his pockets. They all seemed visibly disturbed by him, so I had hoped he wasn’t coming for me. But he ran up to me and asked, “Are you traveling alone? I am very lonely.”

As a rule of thumb, I try not to engage with weirdos, especially at the airport, so I just nodded politely and looked out the window. But then he asked me if I wanted to “hit up the club,” like we’re in Miami. Well, free food is free food, so I did what I always do: pretended I didn’t speak English and followed him to the B East lounge.

He asks me more personal questions on the way over, like my place of birth and my mother’s full name, so I tell him I’m “Paul” and just act confused the whole time. At this point I’m pretty convinced this guy is a scammer: it’s either that or a white savior, and I have no intention of being a victim to either. The moment we get into the club, I get away and grab some eggs and an Irish coffee. But then I see him peeking at me through a fake bush, apparently making notes on my behavior.

At this point I’m getting more freaked out. What does he want from me? So I stage an emergency with the Club staff: I’m lost, I don’t speak English, I’m just looking for a friend who’s landing soon. I think he doesn’t want to draw too much attention to himself, so he leaves. I saw him again in the terminal on my way back to my gate, but thankfully, he didn’t spot me.

1p7crwo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p7crwo,Will This Be Decent? [Budget $300],"Preface ... I'm not a coffee sno or major enthusiast. I've never really enjoyed coffee until the last year or so, and even now am mainly drinking lattes and cappuccino.

I can taste enough to know I prefer good local coffee shop over a big national chain.

Looking to getting into making espresso (again, mainly for cappuccino/latte) at home and getting a set up that will allow me to make good enough espresso without killing the Dutch spending mentality.

Would be making a few drinks a week. Once a day at most.

Looking at Dehlongi Classic and KinGrinder K6. Combined about $250 on Amazon for Black Friday right now. Would likely add some accessories (bottomless portafilter, wdt, tamper, etc) as Christmas gifts.

So two main questions:
* Will this pull decent espresso? I understand it's not too of the line and won't be the world's best, but good enough for a quality cappuccino?
* What would you recommend for ""must have"" accessories?

Since the summer I’ve been struggling with a very strange illness, and so far the doctors haven’t been able to give me any concrete answers. The **papillae** on my tongue swell up, my throat swells, I feel tightness behind my uvula, a foreign-body or “**bone-like**” sensation, pressure. Sometimes it’s better, sometimes worse, it fluctuates completely, and my tongue looks like a map. Since September I’ve been on a reflux- and histamine-free diet, but my symptoms are not improving.  
I’ll describe what has happened to me.  
*The throat pain and tightness are making my everyday life very difficult, and I’m living in constant fear.*

**Background**

I hadn’t really been ill for about two years. But this May I had an upper respiratory infection, followed a few weeks later by severe lower abdominal pain. One doctor thought it was a cyst, another suspected a bowel issue, and another a urinary tract infection. It resolved within a week and a half. Before that I saw a gynecologist, who found everything normal. They wanted to treat me for a UTI, but my mother suspected that the thick mucus produced during my sinusitis had drained down my throat into my stomach. I was given Azi Sandoz.  
After that I began developing eczematous symptoms, mostly around the outer lower lip area and the armpits. Also, two years ago I had nasal surgery to correct a deviated septum.

**Onset of symptoms**

My symptoms began on **08 June**. That day I was visiting a friend, we talked, had coffee, and a few hours later I drank Coke and developed very strong neck spasms. I felt a “bone floating” sensation in my throat, tightness, pressure on the laryngeal cartilage, and needle-like pains around my tonsils, as if I had swallowed a needle. The lymph nodes under my jaw swelled, the thyroid area hurt, and I had pain at the base of my throat near the collarbone. It lasted for hours. At the ER they found nothing; they examined me with an **endoscope** and looked into my throat.  
A few days later I got better and could eat everything, but on the day of the symptoms I only had some onion cream soup and Alpro soy yogurt. I also noticed a small red spot inside my cheek that disappeared the next day, as if a vessel had burst.

About two weeks later I went to the ER again. At work I had coffee (I usually drink it with almond milk), the AC was blowing strongly, and a colleague next to me was cleaning with a spray called Pronto. Immediately I felt throat tightness and pressure, my voice became hoarse, I couldn’t swallow, as if even water would get stuck. At the hospital they suspected reflux but didn’t call it an allergic reaction. I was given Suprastin through IV.  
At home I tried eating a reflux-friendly diet, but the symptoms kept coming back (even when I wasn’t eating—for example I felt the same tightness sitting in the air-conditioned train).  
**I noticed reactions to certain foods**: Jogobella lactose-free peach yogurt, chocolate, ice cream, and coffee caused immediate symptoms. I cut them out.  
One day I took Suprastin and then felt strong throat burning for three hours, couldn’t eat, and became very sleepy. A nurse we know advised me to stop taking it; instead I tried Calcimusc, but it didn’t help.  
I went back to work...  
I had a water bottle I used at university. Inside its rubber straw I noticed tiny black marker-like dots—someone said it was **mold**, so I threw it out immediately.  
One day I ate a Döner kebab with no issues. Later that week I ate grapes during the day and bought gyros and grape juice from the same kebab place for dinner. By evening my tongue itched, the **lymph nodes in my throat swelled**, the tightness and painful swallowing came back, and my **neck hurt.**  
Not long after, on a Thursday, I tried making pastelli at home with flower honey and sesame seeds. My tongue became blistered and itchy, so my parents took me to the ER in an other city. The doctor said my tongue looked completely normal.  
I continued the **reflux diet a**nd took medications (Noacid, Gaviscon, Salvus water therapy).  
Coffee still tightened my throat, so I cut it out entirely. I tried mate tea and matcha instead. Matcha was fine for a few days, then it also caused throat tightness, though milder. Banana caused slight itching on my tongue.  
I can feel myself getting very weak, I’ve unfortunately lost weight, and eating is becoming increasingly difficult.

**Around July 30**, on a Thursday, I ate a tortilla wrap with organic yogurt, cucumber, plain chicken, and lactose-free cheese. I started itching, so I ate a yogurt (Alpro blueberry soy yogurt). I had eaten it before with no issue, but this time my tongue swelled completely, went numb, and developed a **rock-hard lump that was palpable**. I took probiotics, fermented carrot, Fenistil drops, and lemon balm tea. It took hours for the swelling to go down; the lump disappeared after an hour. But I had chills all evening.  
On Friday and Saturday I kept feeling cold, was sleepy, and could barely eat. By Sunday I was better, but the throat tightness and laryngeal pressure returned.  
After that I felt sharp, follicle-like pain in my **tonsils**. I took Flector, but the pain continued. It radiated toward the corners of my mouth where the **eczema** had previously appeared, as if the pain traveled from my tongue. I felt intense itching. On the left side, near the lymph nodes, my throat felt like something was poking my tonsil and ear.  
On Tuesday I went to my GP, who said I had mouth **ulcers** and gave me Anaftin spray. A week later I improved.  
In the summer I noticed that heat made my throat tighten more. After meals it was sensitive, but sometimes it happened without food.  
I also noticed that when reactions occurred—or as they were fading—my skin on my throat and chin often itched. Red, itchy patches appeared.

**Later events**

On 29 August I took an iron + folic acid tablet.  
Immediately after swallowing it my tongue began to swell (like in the yogurt incident), rock-hard lumps appeared, it reddened, and the tongue glands elongated like **stringy coral** when touched. I took Fenistil drops and went to the ER, where—since I reacted badly to both Suprastin and Revicet—they gave me a magnesium solution intravenously. The itching stopped, but my throat remained sensitive, with stabbing sensations at times around the thyroid area.  
My tongue stayed sensitive and blistered, so the next day I could only eat porridge.  
Two days later, around 5 p.m., I developed strong neck spasms again. I couldn’t swallow, even water wouldn’t go down, and I felt dizzy. My parents took me to a big city, where ENT examinations were normal.  
The doctor suspected histamine intolerance and reflux. I was given pantoprazole via infusion; halfway through I could drink again.  
The next day I could again only eat porridge. I felt better, but at 4 a.m. (on 01 September) I woke up with chest pain. I ate a little. My head felt foggy, my chest felt empty and pressured, and I couldn’t fall back asleep for a long time. I was belching (presumably from reflux). I couldn’t lie down. When I woke up again later, I felt blisters behind my uvula and on my palate, plus stinging in my throat.  
On 01 September afternoon I had diarrhea. Lower stomach and bowel pain began, easing after meals.  
My thyroid area felt swollen and tender, like having follicles.  
After this, with the help of a dietitian, I started a strict histamine-free diet, which I still follow.  
My symptoms improved while taking Zyrtec, but pressure and stabbing around the laryngeal cartilage/thyroid area persist, as if the bone itself hurts. Sometimes my tonsils feel follicular. Sometimes my throat stiffens and slightly enlarges, then suddenly returns to normal—this happens with temperature changes. Because of the cold weather we had to turn on the AC for heating, and when it blew strongly, my throat tightened and I had to go outside into the cold air to feel better.  
This period also brought strong headaches, especially since mid-September. Constant fatigue, as if my body cannot rest.  
Sometimes I react to certain foods, other times not. This happened with grated apple mixed with cane sugar and cinnamon (Ceylon), shredded coconut, and blueberries. Chicken breast causes no symptoms, but slightly tougher chicken thigh made my **tongue sensitive.**  
2025.10.23 — In the evening, after eating oatmeal (which previously caused no symptoms), the back of my tongue near the tonsils became painful, sharp, scratchy, and the lymph nodes on both sides were sore.

Additionally, water started to drip from my nose inexplicably when I bent down — twice. It wasn’t blood or mucus, **just clear water.**

**Other information**

Thyroid ultrasound was normal. Tryptase and cortisol tests were done.  
I had stool and microbiome tests, which showed **Leaky Gut syndrome** — I am currently receiving treatment for this.  
In October I had no foreign-body sensation, but around 06 November it returned.  
**MCAS** is suspected as a complication; I’m taking quercetin for it.  
A hematologist suspected Crohn’s disease, but my stools and appetite are normal. Weight loss happened due to throat pain and mouth ulcers.  
Since June I sometimes have thick mucus draining backward from my throat that doesn’t exit through my nose. It drips backward, making me clear my throat and cough. Yesterday in the heat I had very strong drainage and had to cough repeatedly.  
Nasal and oral swab tests were negative.  
My ENT says my nasal mucosa is swollen, but suspects a dental rather than ENT origin. I got my wisdom teeth removed afterwards.

**Childhood history**

As a child (10 years ago) I had very similar symptoms. They investigated for a long time; initially they said it was psychological, but eventually they discovered an egg allergy and reflux. I improved once I removed egg from my diet and received reflux treatment.  
I was symptom-free for 10 years, though on two occasions, when I accidentally ingested a tiny amount of egg, I was unwell for days.  
I also have known lactose intolerance.  
In childhood I took many antibiotics and often had sinus infections. Later I had mild bronchitis, which resolved after treatment.

ll try to keep this as short as possible.  Boyfriend of two years- we have had a wonderful, fun, caring and kind relationship.  He has a son and I have two children; they have all met and are all friends.  We had been talking of moving in together (as in buying a house together as we would need a place that has enough room for everyone).

 

 

Yesterday morning, I can't find my phone (which happens frequently).  I ask him to call my cell which he does and it keeps ringing until it goes to voicemail.  He gets distracted with the kids; I find my phone and I go back to retrieve his phone..... which is still unlocked.  Let me note here I have never looked at his phone.  I have never suspected the need to.  Welllllllll......

 

 

It's open and a message comes through of ""x"" from someone named ""Paula"" as I am picking the phone up to return it.  I don't know a Paula and his friends/family (of which I have met all of them; in fact my children and I spend all of Christmas with his family and extended family which was amazing and fun).  So, of course, my stomach flips.

 

 

I open it.  And I'm smacked with nude pics, graphic detail, dick pics from him this Paula..... I have to stop and go hide in the washroom so I can take screen photos of this with my phone.  I scroll through as fast as I can because maybe I'm wrong?  This is old stuff maybe?  I'll read it later.

 

 

I turn his phone off after taking about 7 photos without reading the dates or comments and give it back to him.  He has to leave for hockey practice so he takes off.  I finally sit down and read this stuff.  It's awful.  Clearly this is someone he is fooling around with.  Dates/times match up with when I'm not with him when he is suppose to be out with his friends from the team and/or when he's doing mundane life stuff as in groceries or laundry.

 

 

He's been meeting this woman during the times he is not with me.  Let me make that clear.  As I read through I discover she is also a mother and lives somewhat near me (thank god I don't know her) and they slept together on Valentine's Day (about 2 hours before I went over to his to a home cooked meal, candlelight, music, dancing and of course a lot of sleeping with each other). 

 

 

I am shaking at this point so I thought well, if this was me I would want to know, so I calmly call the number at the top of the screen.  I'm already under the impression she doesn't know about me as her texts to him seem as though they are in a full-on relationship- one of the texts is thanking him for being such a good influence on one of her sons who adores him....but I digress.... I call her, I ask if she knows him (yes of course) and then I gently break it to her I'm his gf and we have been together for 2 years.

 

 

She bursts out crying of course; didn't know about me; she's sorry (I'm sorry too).  We agree to meet while ""sir"" is at hockey.  Once we do we compare timelines.  She started dating him the same week I did.  SO, yes, he's been cheating on me for two years.  It comes to light he had been pulling away from her for about the last year (which is kind of logical- that's when I became part of the family, kids met each other, we started travelling together, etc. etc) but he never ended things- it turned into more of a FWB relationship but might I add, they only used the pill as birth control and since we've been together so long and I can't get pregnant anymore we have been bareback so yes, my loving boyfriend also was putting my health at risk.  Yes I'm going to the doctor tomorrow to get tested.

 

 

So we decided to confront him.  His son would not be home for rest of afternoon (bless you, birthday parties!) so I went over first and left the front door unlocked.  Started making tea and waited for the gf to show up and BOY DID SHE.  She burst through the door, punched him right in the face and laid into him something fierce.  I was shaking violently I was so upset- listening to her give him hell for leading him on, for using her, for lying to her for two years.

 

 

And what did Mr. Wonderful say?  Nothing.  He apologized but had no excuses.  It was a gong show.  Anyway she left (once I picked her up off the floor as she was sobbing uncontrollably).  And I sat with him and waited for him to explain it.  Still nothing- he can't explain it; he doesn't know why he didn't stop it; he can't understand why he would hurt me/us so badly.

 

 

Since I wasn't getting anywhere with him I figured the best thing to do would be to tell him to fess up to his family.  When his son came home he told him what he had done and of course his son was gutted.  I had to console the poor little guy.  His parents live close by so I went with him and his son and watched him admit everything to both his parents who were floored and both cried.

 

 

Now that I am over the shock, here is my question:  I do love this man.  We have had an amazing time together and I've never felt more honest with a person.  I completely trusted him and he ruined us.  He has suggested over and over we go to counselling together.  I don't really see how counselling will help him not lie to me/chase after someone if he gets bored with me since obviously I wasn't enough for him or he would have stayed faithful.  I also don't see how counselling will help me give him another chance.  I'm looking for suggestions people- in your experience with cheating partners, has counselling helped?



  **tl;dr**: Bf of 2 years cheated on me for the entire length of relationship.  I met the other woman and she didn't know and was devastated.  Bf now asking/begging for counselling- does it work when you are dealing with cheating?

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**Buckaroo2**

>Your entire relationship has been a lie. What could you even possibly save? What would counseling do? There was literally never a time your SO *wasn’t* cheating on you. Honestly I don’t see how you could even move on from this, or why you would want to. Drop this guy and find someone who wants to be with you and only you.

**OOP**

>>Totally agree but I’m just so floored this happened maybe I can’t see the whole picture (although I really think yes I can) and thought I would ask all the nice sensible people on here to just double check ;).

**ImSoRude**

>>>You go to counseling for small lapses or bad judgement calls. When the entire relationship is essentially one giant bad call, then it's not even worth saving. There wasn't ever a moment where he wasn't cheating on you; how can you rebuild trust when it literally never existed to begin with?

**~**

**Scrapple666**

>No. He was lying the whole time, you can never trust him again. He needs to take his son to counseling. So messed up that he had to get involved in this.

**OOP**

>>Well exactly. It comes out that the son had met the other woman AND her children several times the first year. So this wonderful amazing little guy has had to keep his mouth shut and lie to me as well for two years.... I’m beyond upset


[Update - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/81zrkj/update_my_36f_cheating_boyfriend_m45_of_two_years/)  **March 4, 2018 (12 days later)**

So after my post, several of you lovely people explained not to get back together with him. I completely agree, however there was some unfinished business

Over the course of two weeks I’ve been talking to his ex who of course was in pieces. I told her she needed closure so I suggested to my ex he meet up with her. Even offered to watch his son so they could meet. He said he would be an hour tops.

It was two hours. I found out after that they did met up and sat in her car and talked. He claims nothing happened but I don’t care at this point. I’ve spoken to her since and she’s thankful I set that up so she could say goodbye to him. Unfinished business number one done.

I’ve talked to his son a fair bit over the last two weeks. He understandably has a lot of trust issues. Talking with my ex he has set up therapy to also include his son and I’ve encouraged his son at length to speak his mind during these sessions. I’ve talked with him and with my ex’s mother present who also agreed to this so I feel comfortable now that he will somehow be able to advocate for himself going forward. Unfinished business number two done.

But now I have unfinished business number three to deal with. The ex texts me every day. He’s shown up on my doorstep and we have talked at length about the betrayal and how inconsiderate he is to me. Promises alllllll over the place about how he will NEVER cheat on me again and how he will put me first and will be considerate to my feelings blah blah blah

Flash forward to today. His son asked me to go to his hockey practice. I’m feeling good and think I can handle being around the ex (who is a coach so he will be on the ice so I don’t have to talk to him) so I agree. I drove the twenty mins and sat there enjoying myself. They get off the ice and go get changed.....

The ex and the son are together and we meet up in the atrium. Son asks his dad for a hot chocolate. Sure, why not. The ex then proceeds to buy himself a coffee and his son a hot chocolate.

I’m standing there like an idiot. No offer for me. No thought of if I want something from the canteen.

And it hit me. This is what my life would be like if I stay with him. I’ll never be thought of; I would be an after-thought. No I didn’t need anything from the canteen, that’s not the issue. I stepped up to be there for his son and he can’t even think of me or my needs.

I hugged his son goodbye. I told him if he needs anything to send me a text. I said goodbye to the ex and walked away. For all I know he’s still standing there wondering what just happened.

I’ve deleted him from my phone. I can’t have contact with him. I don’t have the heart for it yet but I’ll cut ties with his family on social media as I don’t want the reminders of the life I could have had but was in fact all a lie.

This is all just to say THANK YOU for the advice on here. I’ve never been in this situation and I hope I never am again.

The project began with salvaged parts from the modder’s first PC build. Using a Dremel tool, he cut out the LGA 775 socket area, then designed and 3D-printed a trim piece to cover rough edges. Both were hot-glued together before being set into a silicon mold.

To finish, he poured epoxy resin over the piece, then sanded and polished it repeatedly to achieve a clear, glass-like surface. The result is a unique coaster showcasing the Intel chip at its center.

While it can’t power up to heat coffee, the coaster serves as a nostalgic conversation piece. The mod highlights how old hardware can be repurposed into stylish, low-cost keepsakes rather than discarded.

1p7cgtb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p7cgtb,Is a specialty coffee brand worth ~$35M? Cartel Coffee Lab’s StartEngine round by the numbers,"Cartel Coffee Lab, Inc. is a specialty coffee roaster out of Tempe, AZ that’s currently raising capital from retail investors on StartEngine (Reg CF).

We pulled their latest Form C + campaign stats into Owntric to see how the numbers line up. Here’s the snapshot 👇


Deal snapshot (from latest filing & campaign page)

Company: Cartel Coffee Lab, Inc.

Industry: Specialty coffee roasting / retail

Regulation: Reg CF via StartEngine Primary, LLC

Implied valuation / cap: ~$35.0M

Latest revenue: $8.29M

Latest net income: -$94.59K

Approx. net margin: ~-1.1%

Security type: Common stock

Price per share: $5.00

Campaign progress (per screenshots): roughly $380K raised from ~295 investors

Minimum investment: $300

Employees (reported): 5


So this is a specialty coffee brand doing a little over $8M in annual revenue, running very close to breakeven, and asking the crowd to back a ~$35M valuation via Reg CF.


Bullish angles ☕📈

Some positives that jump out from the data:

Real top-line scale
With $8.29M in revenue, Cartel looks more like an operating business than a concept-stage cafe. There’s demonstrable demand and an existing footprint.

Near-breakeven economics
A net loss of ~$94.6K on $8.29M in sales implies the business is close to breaking even. A modest improvement in efficiency or scale could push them into profitability.

Brand + distribution upside
Specialty positioning plus growth in wholesale / retail locations creates room for higher-margin extensions (beans, subscriptions, merch, etc.) if the brand continues to resonate.

Access to crowd capital
Raising via StartEngine gives the company a way to tap a broad base of retail investors instead of relying solely on banks, PE, or VC.


Bearish angles ⚠️📉

And some reasons for caution:

Thin margin of safety
Operating near breakeven means limited cushion. Shifts in input costs (coffee, labor, rents) or softer demand could widen losses quickly.

Scaling is capital- and ops-intensive
Moving from a strong regional brand to larger scale usually requires heavy investment in marketing, logistics, and operations—areas where consumer brands often hit friction.

Crowdfunding signaling
Some investors view a heavy reliance on Reg CF as a question mark about access to more traditional institutional capital, even if that view isn’t always fair.

Competitive landscape
Specialty coffee is crowded. Sustaining pricing power and differentiation over time requires continuous brand and experience investment.


Why it’s interesting for Owntric

From Owntric’s perspective, Cartel Coffee Lab is a clean case study in modern equity crowdfunding:

Retail investors participate in a consumer brand that already has meaningful revenue.

Key metrics—valuation, revenue, net income, share price, outstanding shares, and raise progress—are all visible in one place via Form C data.

Instead of just reading campaign marketing copy, investors can compare valuation vs fundamentals using standardized dashboards.


We’re not making a call on whether Cartel should be worth $35M. The goal is to surface the numbers so the community can debate it with a full picture.

How do you view a ~$35M valuation on ~$8.3M revenue and ~-1.1% net margin for a specialty coffee brand?

Needed three sessions monthly just to keep my feed alive. Do the math. That's $1500 before editing software, props, location fees.

Worst part wasn't the money. It was the time. Six hours per session when you factor in setup, shooting, tearing down. Then another four hours editing because I shot everything in one afternoon and half the photos had identical energy.

Started checking my bank account three times a day. Avoided friends because I couldn't afford to go out. My girlfriend asked if I was okay because I kept talking about content costs during dinner.

My feed looked boring. Same background, same lighting, same vibe. Followers started commenting that my content felt repetitive even though I was burning through savings trying to create variety.

Tried everything. Batch shooting on weekends. Renting cheaper studios. Shooting with my phone instead of hiring photographers.

Nothing solved the core problem. I physically couldn't create enough content to feed the algorithm. Even if I shot 100 photos in one day they all had the same energy because they were from the same session.

Spent two months trying to make it work. My savings went from $8k to $2900. Was seriously considering quitting. Started resenting every photoshoot. Would stand there under the lights thinking this better get 5k likes or I just wasted $500.

Then I did something that felt like cheating.

Was scrolling Reddit at 2am, couldn't sleep because I was stressed about money. Saw some comment about AI portraits. Thought it was stupid. AI can't replace real photoshoots.

But I was desperate.

Found this tool called APOB in the thread. Figured I'd waste $30 testing it just to prove it doesn't work.

Uploaded 15 photos from my last session. First batch looked terrible. Eyes were slightly off, skin tone didn't match my real photos. Lighting was too perfect, made it obvious it was AI.

Spent three days adjusting settings. Uploaded different photos. Tried different prompts. Most results still looked fake.

Finally got a few that looked natural. Posted one as a test.

Checked comments every ten minutes that first week. Waited for someone to comment ""is this AI"" and watch my whole credibility collapse.

Nobody said anything.

Posted another one. Still nothing.

Started generating more. Beach background, coffee shop, white minimalist room, urban street. Took maybe two hours to create 50 variations. Most looked off. Picked 15 that actually looked like me.

One person asked ""where is this"" under a beach photo. I said ""stock location"" and they didn't follow up.

Another person commented ""your content looks different lately, in a good way."" I just liked the comment and moved on.

My close friend DM'd asking if I was using AI. I admitted it. She said honestly can't tell, looks good.

So some people suspect. But nobody seems to care enough to call me out publicly.

Some of the AI posts performed better than my real shoots. A beach photo got 3200 likes. My real photoshoot from last month, same pose, only got 2100.

Started realizing my audience didn't care about authenticity. They cared about consistency and frequency.

Not everything works though. AI can't do action shots. Can't do photos with other people. Can't do anything that requires specific real-world context.

So I still need real shoots for certain content. Just way less frequently.

Now my workflow is one professional session monthly for partnerships and hero content. Everything else gets created the same way. Posting 38 to 45 times monthly instead of 12 to 17. Spending maybe seven to nine hours weekly on content instead of 25.

Last month I spent $440 total. Month before was $510. Used to be $1700 to $1900 every single month.

Real difference is I finally have time to focus on strategy. Testing hooks, analyzing what resonates, engaging with community. The stuff that grows accounts instead of just keeping them alive.

Still check every comment looking for ""is this AI."" Still feel guilty when someone compliments a photo I didn't actually shoot. Still wonder if I'm building my brand on a foundation that could collapse if my audience finds out.

But my engagement is up 27% to 34% depending on the week and I'm not broke anymore.

Not sure if this is the future of content creation or if I'm just early to something that'll get backlash later.

For now it's working.",1,1764175126.0,contentcreation,1,1.0,False
1p7cgbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/hubproducts/comments/1p7cgbh/which_microfiber_cleaning_cloth_set_suits_small/,Which microfiber cleaning cloth set suits small apartment living?,"Living in a small apartment means every item needs to pull its weight. You don't have room for bulky cleaning supplies or dozens of different products cluttering your cabinets. That's where a good microfiber cleaning cloth set becomes your best friend.

**Why Microfiber Cloths Work Great for Small Spaces**

Microfiber cloths are perfect for apartment living because they replace tons of other cleaning tools. You can use them on windows, countertops, electronics, bathroom fixtures, and pretty much any surface. They trap dirt and dust instead of just pushing it around, and they work with just water most of the time – no need for a cabinet full of different sprays and cleaners.

These cloths are also washable and reusable, so you're not constantly buying paper towels or disposable wipes. For someone in a tight space, that means less waste and more room under your sink.

**What to Look for in a Microfiber Cloth Set**

When you're picking out a microfiber cleaning cloth set for your apartment, think about these things:

**Size variety** – You want different sizes for different jobs. Smaller cloths work great for dusting shelves or wiping down your coffee table, while bigger ones handle kitchen counters and bathroom cleaning.

**Color coding** – Sets with different colors help you avoid cross-contamination. Use one color in the kitchen, another in the bathroom, and you'll never mix them up.

**Enough quantity** – A good set should have at least 12-20 cloths. That gives you enough to rotate between cleanings without doing laundry constantly.

**Proper thickness** – Look for cloths with a decent GSM (grams per square meter) rating. Around 300-400 GSM works well for most cleaning tasks. Too thin and they won't absorb much; too thick and they take forever to dry.

**Best Options for Apartment Dwellers**

For small apartment living, you want a compact set that handles multiple tasks. [Check out these microfiber cleaning cloth sets](https://athomewave.com/microfiber-cleaning-cloth-set) that come with everything you need without taking up half your storage space.

The ideal set includes different textures – some smooth ones for glass and screens, and slightly rougher ones for scrubbing stuck-on messes. Edge stitching is also important because it prevents the cloths from falling apart after a few washes.

**How to Use Them Effectively**

You can tackle most apartment cleaning with just water and microfiber cloths. For tougher jobs, a little dish soap or vinegar does the trick. The cloths pick up bacteria and dirt better than regular rags, making them perfect for quick daily cleanups.

After using them, rinse them out and let them air dry. Wash them separately from regular laundry without fabric softener, which clogs up the fibers and ruins their cleaning power.

**Storage Tips**

Keep your microfiber cloths folded in a drawer or small bin under your sink. Since they're thin and lightweight, even a large set doesn't take up much room. Some people hang a small basket on the inside of a cabinet door to keep them handy.

**Making Your Decision**

The right microfiber cleaning cloth set saves you money, space, and time. Instead of stocking multiple cleaning products for different surfaces, you can handle everything with one versatile set. 

If you're ready to simplify your cleaning routine, [grab a quality microfiber cloth set](https://athomewave.com/microfiber-cleaning-cloth-set) and see how much easier apartment maintenance becomes. Your small space will stay cleaner with way less hassle.",1,1764175108.0,hubproducts,0,1.0,False
1p7cfok,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1p7cfok/emotional_cheating/,Emotional cheating,"I'm Brad 30 (M), partner is Kim 33 (F).  My girlfriend and I have been in a relationship for 2.5 years.  We have our differences and have had our share of challenges, but have always addressed them promptly, and been able to work through them.  She went on vacation for 3 weeks to a place she once lived.  She goes every fall, and will typically see her ex (lets call him Jack) there once for a coffee or a walk.  Since we started dating she's told me she has no desire to get back together with Jack.  She has always said they had a strong connection, but she was not attracted to him and the sex was bad.  Prior to her leaving on the trip, things were really good between us.  We chatted briefly every night while she was gone, but she was quite busy through the day, going climbing and visiting old friends so I'd let her do her thing.  It's' really hard for me to connect over the phone.  At the very end of the trip she told me she had tea with her Jack, but downplayed it, said they simply caught up over an hour and that was that.

Side note:  Kim was Jacks love of his life, has never been able to get over her, and they broke up over 4 years ago.

When she returned, I was really missing her but sensed there was a bit of distance between us.  I prompted her, asking if something was up, and she explained how she desires a stronger intellectual connection between us, which she says she's been asking for throughout our relationship but I'm just not quite meeting the mark.  She has an emotional connection to me, finds me very attractive, the sex is great, similar sense of humor, and we have many similar interests.  But I'm not the best at sharing ideas, podcasts, and things I learn.  She said that I'm great in so many ways but ""that is her biggest complaint.""  She said that when she met up with her ex, she was reminded of that connection and that is something she really misses and wants.  I expressed that I really want the same and would like to work on those things with her, but for the first time in our relationship it seemed like she was giving up and she said she just needs to see time to see how things go.  I accepted this feedback completely but I find it really hard to receive when it's in comparison to someone else she once loved, and this is something that has happened before.

  
A day later, she told me that on her return home, her ride to the airport slept through her alarm at 5am so she had to call everyone in town.  The only person that picked up was Jack, so he drove her an hour to the airport.  This made me really insecure and feel weird, as she withheld this from me for a few days.  She said nothing happened, but I felt like there was emotional cheating.  I didn't trust her, and did something I'm ashamed of, but I searched through her phone and read her texts.  She texted Jack saying ""I cried the entire flight home.""  ""I don't know what this means but our connection is something to be both cherished and grieved.""  And they also exchanged several podcasts and cutesy comments about them.  Her text to her friend said ""If Jack looked like Brad, I never would have left him.""  She told her friend ""I think Jacks' so cool, and I do find him attractive, but the sex was just bad.""  I felt so hurt, and I admitted to her that I read them.  She had denied any emotional cheating, but idk what you call that.  In the past day we have both grieved a lot and she really does love me, but I just think I need to have self respect and work on myself.  It feels like even if she loves a lot about me, I can't be with someone who's always comparing me and looking for the imperfections in me.  But simultaneously I want to make it work and it feels so hard to leave her, because I really do love her as well.",1,1764175072.0,dating_advice,9,1.0,False

Hi,

I’m a 32 year old woman, and my husband is 33. We’ve been married for six years, and ever since we made our relationship official with our families, things have been difficult. It began with jealousy issues and his family not welcoming me in the way I expected. We had major arguments, and I became so stressed that I lost a lot of weight. I didn’t feel able to tell my parents what was happening because I was scared, and I stayed in the relationship partly out of fear that leaving would bring shame to my family or make me unwanted.

Those issues never fully went away, and since getting married, living together, and especially after having children, I am completely exhausted. I’ve always worked full-time, and now we have two boys (4 and 1). I handle about 85% of everything.

**What I manage:**

* **Household:** cleaning, cooking, shopping, replacing things, paying bills.
* **Car:** insurance, MOT, cleaning, bookings.
* **Nursery/school:** packing bags, paying fees, uniforms.
* **Children:** appointments, clothing, shoes, toys, bathing, bedtime, playing with them.
  Meanwhile, he spends most of his free time on his phone or watching TV, and he does the same with the kids.

I hardly get any time to myself — not even to shower without interruptions. I rarely see my friends, and when I do, it’s usually at home with our kids. My friends often come to our house, and instead of giving us space, he sits with us, which doesn’t make sense to me. I would never sit with his friends if they were here without their wives.

**His personal hygiene is also an issue.** I have to tell him to shower or change because he smells. He wears the same clothes day and night, doesn’t brush his teeth, and often sits with his hands down his pants — even when working from home. I used to buy all his clothes, underwear, socks, etc., but I stopped three months ago.

I also take care of birthdays — even for his family — because he makes no effort.

Whenever his friends invite him out for shisha, he goes, sometimes three times a week. He will leave at 9pm and return around midnight. Meanwhile, I’ve only been out on my own maybe four times in the last four years. If I go anywhere, it’s with or for the kids, never for myself.

I feel like I’m doing everything, and instead of feeling like his partner, I feel like a mother who doesn’t even get the respect he gives his own.

**When we argue, things escalate.**
He has repeatedly said he’ll take me back to my parents or divorce me. Over the last year, he has started **threatening to hit me**. He gets in my face, shouting, trying to intimidate me. Whenever I try to say I need help or I’m struggling, he says he already does more than my dad and brother and that all of this is just part of being a mother. He tells me I should be grateful for having a house, husband, and kids — what more could I want?

He twists my words constantly. For example, during maternity leave I once said that when I return to work, at least I’ll get to have a quiet cup of coffee. To me he agreed. But to my dad he said that I didn’t want to look after my kids and couldn’t wait to go back to work.

**Other things he has said:**

* That I’m “trying to make him my bitch” because I’m asking for help.
* That I have a “shitty job,” even though I’m a financial analyst and earn only slightly less than him.
* To his manager, in front of me, he said he could “make more money than her in my sleep.”
* He tells me to get a divorce, and then two days later wants to have sex.

He thinks because he contributes more financially to the family that’s it for him. Even though we work the same hours. 

I know I’m not perfect — I get moody — but it’s because I feel invisible. I’m doing so much, and to him it’s just expected. I receive no acknowledgment or appreciation. Now with his threats, I’m scared to even talk to him. I feel like he’s pushed me into silence. Right now, I only speak to him about the boys when necessary.

Lately I’ve been crying on my own and having thoughts about not existing anymore. I don’t want to die, but the thought of escape keeps coming up. The only thing that stops me is knowing my boys need me and wondering who would take care of them if I wasn’t here.

Surely, I am not asking for a lot. I don’t really know what I want from this post. And these are all small snippets and I could sit here and give 100s of examples of things that he’s said or that have happened. We have both lived in the UK pretty much our entire lives, I thought he would think a bit more equal on how we are as a family. 

I guess I don’t know how much I can live like this. But I don’t want to ruin my children’s lives by having a divorce. And all the shame that will bring to my family, I will be the talk of the town in our community. My mum endured a lot in her marriage, and I never understood why she stayed but I get it now “for the kids”. 

Is it selfish to want to be thought about, to want someone to care when they’ve eaten two plates of food and I haven’t been able to eat trying to feed the boys that he thinks one minute let me take them of her for a minute. I want him to make an effort for me, to show me that he wants me as a wife and not as someone that works, raises his children and does everything.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Appalachian State Mountaineers vs. Mercer Bears: A Statistical Bear Hug with a Side of Humor**

The Appalachian State Mountaineers (4-3) and Mercer Bears (3-2) clash in Macon, Georgia, with the Bears favored by 6.5 points. Let’s unpack this matchup with the precision of a stat nerd and the wit of a late-night host who’s had one too many coffee-infused energy drinks.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Mercer is the Statistical “Bear” Hug

Mercer isn’t just a favorite—they’re a *mathematical inevitability*, according to the numbers. The Bears’ 45.4% field goal percentage outpaces Appalachian State’s 43.3%, and their opponents have shot a pedestrian 41.5% against the Mountaineers. It’s like comparing a well-tuned espresso machine (Mercer) to a coffee mug that’s seen better days (App State).

The spread of -6.5 reflects Mercer’s home dominance: they’ve won both home games this season, while Appalachian State is a shaky 1-2 on the road. Imagine trying to navigate the Appalachian Trail with a GPS that only works in Georgia—disaster awaits.

Mercer’s offense is a well-choreographed dance, led by Baraka Okojie (15.8 PPG, 5.0 APG) and Quinton Perkins II (15.2 PPG, 45.2% from three). Their 14.8 assists per game (fifth in the SoCon) make them a team that *passes like they’re sharing a secret*—everyone’s in on it. Conversely, Appalachian State’s strength is its offensive rebounding (10.1 RPG, led by Andrin Njock’s 2.3 RPG), but even a trash can can’t out-rebound a team that’s *this* good at cleaning up.

---

### News Digest: Injuries, Highlights, and Why Mercer’s Last Win Feels Like a Movie Reboot

Mercer’s recent 95-83 drubbing of Eastern Kentucky was a masterclass in efficiency. Perkins dropped 20 points, proving that when you’re hot, even a bear can shoot fireworks. The Bears’ home crowd is as reliable as a microwave—consistent, if a bit unexciting.

Appalachian State’s news is… sparse. They’ve won four games but struggle on the road, where they’re 1-2. Their offense is a slow-burn novel—predictable, occasionally engaging, but unlikely to set the league on fire.

I scrolled up a little. There was a message from her that said ""ugh I miss you it's boring here without you"" from when Jordan took a sick day.

And one that said ""lol your gf is so demanding, she really takes up all your time huh""

YOUR GF. I'm his FIANCÉE. And she's complaining about me to him and he didn't correct her.

I brought it up to Jordan. Showed him the messages. Asked why she's calling him babe and complaining about me.

He said it's ""just office culture"" and ""everyone talks like that"" and I'm ""being insecure."" Said Melody is ""like a sister"" and I'm ""reading into things.""

okay sure. my sisters don't call me babe but whatever.

Here's the thing that's really bothering me now. Their company Christmas party is next week. It's an office-only event. No partners.

Jordan told me Melody said she ""can't wait to be his date"" since I won't be there.

His date. To a party I'm specifically not invited to.

I told Jordan that comment was weird and he said ""she's joking, that's just how she is""

WIBTA if I told him this isn't okay and something needs to change? I don't want to be the controlling jealous fiancée but I also don't want my future husband having a ""work wife"" who calls him babe and talks shit about me and acts like she's his date to events",106,1764174915.0,dustythunder,116,0.98,False

# General Background

I was an NCAA DIII runner in college in the Philly area, and continued to train seriously for a couple years afterwards in pursuit of a sub-4:00 mile.  I achieved that goal in the summer of 2018, and then basically had to retire from taking things super seriously the following spring from a combination of a nagging foot injury and other life changes (in short, moved across the country). Of course this doesn't mean I stopped doing the thing I love.  

Once I got healthy again I still trained kind of seriously, basically coaching myself, sometimes bouncing ideas off of friends, and got back to running 70-something mile weeks with some good workouts, with the occasional race here and there, but nothing close to my college/""semi-pro"" days.  In 2023 I moved back to the Philly area and was excited to give the half a shot after running a stupidly-paced 68:20 in humid conditions a year prior.  But I got a bad case of covid in September and that threw my whole fall off.  I was getting excited to give the full marathon a try in 2024, but an IT band injury once again derailed my fall.  It took a lot of trial and error and research outside of the PT I was paying way too much money to see, but in the early months of 2025 I finally found the underlying cause, developed a routine to address the issue, and it has really not been a problem since.  

So was I finally in the clear to give the Philadelphia Marathon a real shot in 2025? Well, my partner and I decided that now was a good time for us to start a family, so in the spring we welcomed our first child into the world.  I love being a father, but this also meant that I would have to take a different approach to training for a race than I ever have before.  I know, I know, I’m not the first person to ever train for a marathon while having a baby at home, or even the first guy to post to this subreddit about running the 2025 Philly Marathon while being a dad, but bear with me.

# Training

Previously, I had a great training routine that I absolutely loved.  I would wake up at 5:00, spend a little time waking up, get out the door around 5:45, and finish up by 7:00-7:15.  Plenty of time to run 70-something mile weeks and still get to work on time.  My go to workouts were 4-6 mile tempos, cruise intervals, 200s or 30 second sprints for speed.  But my partner works a job with crazy hours, and my job affords me a bit of ""as long as the work gets done, I don't care if you arrive a little late or leave a little early"" flexibility, so I was in charge of pickup and drop off from daycare.  On top of my commute, this made mornings a bit more challenging, cutting my weekday ""run time"" that I had between daycare dropoff and leaving for work from 75-90 minutes pre-child to usually about 45-65ish minutes.  This, along with occasional days where I simply would not have any time to run, meant my mileage was going to usually be in the low 50s.  Not the end of the world, but coming from years of mileage in the 70’s, it was weird to be doing LESS mileage when preparing for my first longer race. The major thing I wanted to focus on was the long run, since I would still have my standard time each weekend to do one, so I wanted to make each one count.

I would need to be smart about how I trained.  I reached out to a friend who knew a thing or two about getting the most bang for his buck out of a small volume of running (for injury reasons, not time crunch reasons) and he taught me a lot.  I ended up doing a sort of norwegian singles approach kind of thing: 2 sessions of 20-40 minutes (whatever I had time for depending on how hectic life got) of lactate threshold running as determined by HR during the week, usually broken into 4-6 minute segments with 1 minute rest, with the shorter of those 2 sessions having some 30” strides or hills tacked on, and then alternating traditional marathon training long run workouts with “normal” 2-ish hour long runs. This isn’t what NSA disciples will say you should do, but I don’t really care, they’re not the running police.

I started doing this in the beginning of the summer, when the humidity was starting to get pretty crazy, so I was admittedly a little skeptical that doing like 60-80 minutes a week of what ended up being 6:00-6:10 pace intervals would work, but as I stacked more bricks, I could feel myself getting fitter. As conditions and fitness improved, I could push a little bit faster to 5:50, maybe 5:45ish.  These never felt hard; usually the last rep or 2 were just slightly uncomfortable.  One time, I did the middle 3 of 6xMile @ about 6:00 breathing entirely through my nose.  I do not recommend doing this, I think it gave me a minor sinus infection.  

When I hit 20 weeks until race day, I sat down and drew up a plan, placing traditional marathon workouts like 10 Easy+10 @ MP and fast 20-24 milers and 13-14 @ MP in basically every other weekend long run, while keeping the threshold sessions as the usual mid-week workouts, only replacing a few later ones with other traditional non-long-run marathon workouts like faster tempos or mile repeats, where I wouldn’t pay attention to HR, only pace. I figured by that point, the threshold stuff had done its job building my base fitness, and I was ready to sharpen up.

For the most part, these workouts all went really well. I didn’t end up following my plan to a T, there were a couple curveballs thrown at me (some personal sickness, baby sickness, and one IT band flare up) that caused me to miss a few days here and there, but there was only one workout where I think I underperformed a bit, compared to 4 or 5 workouts that I pleasantly surprised myself in.  Highlights include:

* 22 miles with middle 18 avg 5:49
* 20 miles with first 17 avg 5:55 (this was my one “underperforming” workout, I wanted to avg sub-6:00 pace for a full 20, but bonked at 17 and jogged it in)
* 10EZ + 10 @ MP, where I felt like I could have gone another 3 or 4 @ MP without it being a big ask
* 6xMile (2’ jog) avg 5:01.5
* 24 miles with the middle 21 avg 5:43
* 6 mile tempo avg 5:10.5
* 14 miles @ MP, including some hills to simulate the course.

My mileage started to get pretty consistent by the end of June, and it went like this: 47, 50, 48, 55, 53, 52, 56, 24 (IT band flare up), 57, 52, 45, 53, 54, 62, 43, 71, 52, 46, 55, 54, 52, 56 (including race).  That’s an average of 51.7 mpw.

One last paragraph on nutrition: I’ve always had a bit of an iron stomach so nutrition was never a problem for me.  This allowed me to adopt a “fuel early and fuel often” approach.  For most of my long runs I ran with a handheld 16oz bottle of Nuun + half to a full LMNT (usually would refill it and add another half of an LMNT in the middle), and I would take Carbs Fuel gels (50g carbs) every 35 minutes or so. I think that maths out to about 90-100g carbs/hour.  I never got a chance to practice cups though, so my plan for race day was to run with my 16oz water bottle with 1 scoop of nuun and 1 LMNT in it for about 6 to 9 miles, and take cups wherever I could as well.  I also planned to use 2 Caffeinated Carbs Fuels (100mg Caff, 150mg Na) and 2 Salted Carbs Fuels (450mg Na) at miles 3, 9, 15, 21, plus one regular one right before the start.

# Pre-Race

I live about 1.5 miles away from the start line, so this made race morning super easy.  Had my usual oatmeal and coffee breakfast and used my own toilet right before I left. I took an ebike over to a little less than half a mile away, and got there super early, which allowed me to use the portapotty again without waiting in a super crazy line, get through gear check, and fill up the water bottle I was going to carry with me.  Met a friend who was also going out at a similar pace and hung out with him in the corral until the race started.

My race plan was 1) Get out for the first mile conservatively in 5:35-40 2) Be as relaxed as possible through the first 16 miles, try to not do too much leading if I find myself in a pack 3) Try not to run faster than 5:30 for non-downhill miles until the turnaround in Manayunk 4) stay focused over the final 6 miles home and 5) Have fun!!

# Race 

# Start to 6 Miles

I started a couple rows back from the start line to avoid getting out too fast.  My main goal was anything in the 2:25s, (5:32 to 5:35 pace), so I wanted to get out a little conservatively, 5:40-5:35, and try not to run anything faster than 5:30 on non-downhill miles until hitting the turnaround in Manayunk with 6 to go. Hit 5:35 on the dot for the first mile and felt good.  By the time we got down to Columbus Dr, we had a nice little pack of about 6 of us.  I felt smooth and comfortable, so I did not mind that we were clicking off 5:28ish miles.  Between GPS margin of error and not running perfect tangents, I felt like I was still sticking to my 5:30 speed limit. 

# 6 Miles - 16 Miles

This part was pretty uneventful, as I hoped it would be.  Did some leading but everyone was doing their fair share as well.  The pace stayed right around what I was hoping for.  Yes, many of the splits were faster than 5:30 but I still figured I was close enough to my speed limit, and as long as I felt relaxed and in control, I was executing my plan.  I also held on to my bottle throughout this point since I was drinking less from it than what I was expecting, maybe a big mouthful every mile or two.  It was pretty salty with the LMNT added, so I felt confident my electrolyte supply was solid, and I was still taking nuuns and waters from the water stations whenever I could so I felt like my fluids levels were also good.  I am glad I brought the bottle in the first place though, because the nuun at the water stations seemed watered down.

# 16 Miles - 20 Miles

I got excited once we got down to Kelly Drive and took charge of our pack.  There were a couple guys in front of us who were coming back to us, so I was able to focus on running the tangents and reeling them in.  Going through East Falls, I finished what was left in my bottle in anticipation of seeing some of my friends, and ditched it with them as I ran by.  The excitement got me fired up and I found myself alone coming out of there.  I figured the best thing to do was stay focused and relaxed until the turnaround.  Through one of the lonelier stretches heading into Manayunk I saw a friend who I was not expecting to see, which gave me a really big boost.

# 20 Miles to Finish

Was super happy to make it to the turnaround because it meant I had executed the first 3 steps of my plan as I had hoped.  Nothing had gone wrong, I was perfectly teed up to see what I had left for the straight shot down Kelly Drive to the finish line - the real challenge.  A combination of the downhill coming out of Manayunk and seeing my friend again did cause me to get a little overly excited and drop a 5:20 21st mile. I knew that was probably a little too fast and a little too far out, so I tried to just shrug it off and find my rhythm again.  Seeing my other friends in East Falls again got me fired up, but as soon as I passed that water station with roughly 3.5 miles to go, things started to get hard.  I just kept repeating “Focused, relaxed, smooth, confident” in my head, and trying to go from tangent point to tangent point.  The pace started to creep from the high 5:20s to the low 5:30s, but that was still within my range, so it did not faze me.  I knew I didn’t need to do anything heroic, just maintain till the finish.

At 40K, I felt a very small cramp in my L hamstring that quickly went away.  That kind of scared me, so that really instilled in me that I don’t need to do anything special at this point, just maintain. I was hoping to be able to pick up the pace one more time as I came over the top of the hill, but my legs were just barely hanging on.  With the finish line in sight, I saw 2:24:40 on the clock, and was finally able to pick it up a little bit.  Crossed the line, stopped my watch, let out a yell, and looked down to see 2:25:00.

# Post-Race

I tried to keep walking, grabbed my medal and space blanket, and then a volunteer came up to me and said I had placed in the open division, so I needed to stick around for the awards ceremony, and he would escort me to gear check and back if I wanted to get my stuff. Hobbled over there, got my stuff and put it on, and called/found my wife and kid.  The volunteer escorted us back over to the athletes area and we had to hang around for I think 30-40 more minutes before the awards ceremony started.  Smiled for the camera, signed some paper for prize money purposes (!) and then began the long walk home.  Stopped for Paulie Gee’s pizza, which I highly recommend, if you’re in the area.

# Reflections

It’s hard to overstate how happy I am with this race.  I ran exactly my goal time, in my debut marathon, and just about everything went right.   I’m thankful to all the people I ran with during the race, all the people who cheered me on, all the people who I bounced training ideas off of in the buildup, and of course most importantly my wife who put up with me wanting to balance being a dad with training “seriously” again.

Actually, I think balancing the demands of being a first time dad really helped me both mentally and physically for this buildup. When you’re busy all the time with everything that’s needed to run a household with a baby, running must take a backseat, which then prevents me from dwelling or worrying about things.  My mental approach to running throughout this whole block was “Family first, so just try to run what you can when you can, and be happy with whatever you can get.”  I also noticed that my screentime went down a lot and I overall just felt happier, more at peace with things.  Baby was up every hour on the hour between 12:00 and 5:00? It is what it is!  Simply don’t have time to run for 2 days in a row? (this happened multiple times) Oh well! It’s not like I’m trying to min/max everything or squeeze each and every second of performance out of my body, I just want to be prepared to challenge myself to have a good race. Running is supposed to be fun, so you just gotta have as much fun as you can with it.

# What’s Next?

Not to get too ahead of myself, but my initial thoughts are that my next big race will be Philly again next year, probably with a goal of 2:23, but we will see how things shake out.  I’d like to continue doing basically the same thing, with 2 main changes: 1) incorporate more continuous running into my LT sessions, like 10-15 minute bits, and 2) now that I am in shape, and not getting back into shape after 2 years of kind of on/off training, I’d like to continue with the quality long runs throughout the year, which I think will really help me with the marathon as I remain time-constrained during the week.  Once I get back into the swing of things, each month I’d like to do one 20-22 mile long run where I just try to run more or less 6:00 pace as long as possible, and then one with specific MP work, like 8 to 15 miles of MP, broken up in 3-5 mile segments.  And the other 2-3 long runs per month will just be easy mileage.  Closer to race day, I’ll work in the marathon-specific ones I stated earlier.  I’ll probably do either Broad Street for fun, or maybe a 10K on the track if I think I might have a shot at a sub-30:00 10K - just a box that would be nice to check off.

1p7c3i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndustrialDesign/comments/1p7c3i0/your_design_i_prototype/,Your design i prototype!,"I run a wooden Furniture manufacturing unit. We make furniture, décor, wooden toys, basically anything that involves cutting, carving, or assembling wood into shapes people want.

Here's the thing: I keep meeting people—design students, self-taught creators, interior design interns, architects who sketch furniture on weekends—who have sick ideas but zero way to actually make them.

They'll show me stuff on their phone or in a sketchbook and go ""yeah but it's just a concept, I can't actually build it""

Why not though?

Here's the deal:

You design something. A chair, a shelf, a coffee table, a lamp, a weird sculpture, whatever's been sitting in your files doing nothing.

I'll build it. If it sells, you get a royalty on every piece. We'll work out the percentage based on what makes sense.

Also open to collaborating with startups in architecture, interior design, proptech, or anything adjacent. If you need a manufacturing partner who can actually execute designs at scale, let's talk.

What I'm NOT looking for:
- Knockoffs of existing stuff (""make this West Elm table but cheaper"")
- Designs that need some exotic wood I've never heard of
- People who ghost after two messages

What I AM looking for:
- Furniture or wooden products that are actually functional (or just cool enough that people want them)
- Designs that can realistically be built with wood
- Someone who's down to collaborate and tweak stuff as we go

You don't need:
- A fancy design degree
- Manufacturing experience
- Money to build prototypes

You just need:
- A decent idea
- Willingness to figure this out together
- Some taste (I've seen college kids on Instagram with better ideas than most ""professionals"")

Honestly I'm just tired of making the same boring stuff. I want to work with people who have weird, fresh ideas and aren't scared to try something different.

If your designs are collecting digital dust, hit me up. Comment or DM. Let's make some cool shit",11,1764174292.0,IndustrialDesign,7,0.87,False
1p7c3c5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p7c3c5,I’m scared I’m gonna be dismissed,"My first ANA direct was positive with elevated RNP antibodies. The second ANA IFA test was negative, which is honestly upsetting to me because it makes me feel like they are going to say nothing is wrong. I have had other tests showing that inflammation is present. My appointment to see a rheumatologist is set for 12/18. Everything I’m reading from other people is that they get immediately told that nothing is wrong. When something is clearly wrong!!! 


These are my symptoms: 
Joint pain
-Right hand- thumb knuckle and wrist: happens randomly, makes it hard to use the bathroom (wipe), typing, holding a coffee cup, holding a cooking pan etc. More like an ache/burning pain. 
-Jaw: when eating it will get fatigued and burning pain, have to stop eating. 
-Shoulders and neck: stiff, all day, every day. Experience pain in my neck down to my shoulder and arm, very tense. 
-Hips: when walking a longer distance, my hips feel rickety?? Painful and make me walk with a limp

Muscle weakness
If I push myself, I will get a burning sensation in my muscle and will be sore for days afterwards
-Cannot carry a full laundry basket, groceries into the house etc. 
-Cannot hold my hands above my head to wash my hair or blow dry my hair. Fiance helps me wash my hair most days. 
-Cannot do more than 1 flight of stairs 
-Cannot stand for longer than 10-15 minutes without needing to sit down. Train station/concerts/Shower etc. 
-Cannot do squats, was only able to do 8 before the burning sensation. 
-some days feels like there’s cinderblocks attached to my feet, everything feels so heavy 

Fatigue
-My worst symptom
-Debilitating tired on a daily basis
-falling asleep at work/ had a verbal warning over it
-falling asleep on commute and missing my stop
-when I used to drive to work I would have to pull over cause I felt like I was gonna fall asleep while driving (that happened often)
-was fired for being late too often because I just couldn’t get out of bed in the morning
-would take my adderal and still fall asleep
-never feel rested even with extra sleep
-eyelids very heavy 
-sometimes I can’t take it and go to the break room and fall asleep (risking getting in trouble at work)
-on my days off I sleep for over 18 hours, never feel rested. 
-brain fog and trouble concentrating when I’m tired like that

Skin related
-irritation on my eyelids
-irritation around my lips
-swollen eyelids where the irritation is
-this mostly occurs in the winter time 
-HS: chest and groin 

Fingers swelling 
-when I walk my hands swell and get stiff
-swollen in the morning time 
-ring is normally alittle big, but when fingers swell can’t get it off. 

Raynauds

Heart rate 
-consistently tachycardia, heart rate is always high. 

Circulation/ temperature issues

Lung related
-diagnosed with asthma when I was 7
-almost every winter I am hospitalized for my asthma. It flares up and I can’t breathe right (deep wheezing/asthma attack) usually accompanied by a cold that exasperates the asthma. My boss recommended I go on FMLA from being hospitalized for asthma multiple times last winter. 
-they give me duoneb and steroids and keep me over night to monitor me
-I take symbicort (2 puffs in morning and 2 puffs at night) to manage my asthma
-I do vape and have tried quitting numerous times, even tried chantix.

I have figured out that the smell of peanut butter is a major migraine trigger. It’s stupid, but there it is. I also get migraines from the smell of smoke and other stuff, but that’s not what this is about.

I work in a big office with groups of cubicles separated into different rooms. I’m in one small section with my group. There’s little ventilation and the air filter broke years ago. I’ve asked repeatedly for people not have peanut butter out and not eat peanut butter candy near me while we’re at our desks. But it seems like no one cares. I’ve had so many migraines and have had to go home early. So. Many. Times. It always gets worse between Halloween and New Year’s until the candy disappears.

All of my previous jobs were ok with accommodating me and were able to respect not eating peanut butter around me. Most stop bringing in anything with peanuts in it. Even coffee shop jobs where they would take peanut butter items off the menu while I’m at work so I’m ok. I haven’t had this kind of push back before so I’m confused. 

I’ve had multiple people at my current job that have questioned and ‘tested’ my allergies. People have said it’s ridiculous and ‘all in my head’ which is hilarious because yes that’s where I keep my migraines. Also there is a difference in the strength of the smell of peanut butter compared to regular peanuts. Test it yourself if you don’t believe me.  One time a coworker decided to ‘gift’ me and my cubicle buddy cookies, then gave me a bag with peanut butter cookies in it. That was fun throwing up that day. This makes my office seem like a hellscape, but I usually like my job and most of the people I work with.

I’m about to ask my supervisor again if it’s ok to ask everyone to just chill with the reeses and butterfingers and move them in the breakroom so I stop feeling sick every day. I just don’t want to deal with the guilt that happens every time I bring it up. 

I don’t want to go to HR unless absolutely necessary. I do have an allergist I could get a note from though. Or maybe just stab myself dramatically with my epipen next time someone comes over to talk to me with a Reese’s in hand. It wouldn’t help with the migraine but it might get my point across.

So here is the problem especially with women. Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes', I wanted to see real people experiences . Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question. Yes I can ask chat gpt, but for safety real people experience matter more I suppose. People post these experience but they are lost in communities.

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

You can search for 'Delhi' or 'Mumbai' for example

• Casual conversations
• Coffee meetups
• Exploring the city
• Building a real friendship, and maybe more if it vibes naturally

My manager Russell is like. fine? He's not a bad boss but he's very serious about quarterly meetings. Like he puts on a jacket. Uses a laser pointer. The whole thing. It's a lot for a Tuesday morning.

so we're in the conference room. maybe 8 of us. Russell is doing his thing with the slides and he's been standing for a while and decides to sit down in this new chair the office just got. one of those expensive ergonomic ones with wheels

I don't know if the floor is slightly uneven or what but he goes to sit and the chair just. leaves. like it rolls backward and he's already committed to sitting so he grabs the table

the table has a tablecloth on it. why does our conference room have a tablecloth. I don't know. corporate aesthetic I guess

anyway he grabs it and pulls and his laptop goes flying. his coffee goes flying. there's a plant?? that also goes flying. soil everywhere

and he still falls. lands on his back. covered in dirt. coffee on his shirt. just laying there

and he goes ""as I was saying""

FROM THE FLOOR

I lost it. I tried so hard not to but my coworker Becca did this little snort and that was it. I was gone. we were all gone. Russell started laughing too and he couldnt get up because he was wheezing and every time someone would calm down someone else would start again

honestly might have been the best meeting we ever had after that because everyone was actually relaxed for once. people were talking like normal humans instead of corporate speak

anyway the chair is gone now. Russell still brings it up. someone put a photo of the plant in the break room as a memorial and he hasn't taken it down

Are there any recommendations on where to find this type of soft, almost silky fabric in a shirt? She doesn't like the cool feeling of silk itself.
