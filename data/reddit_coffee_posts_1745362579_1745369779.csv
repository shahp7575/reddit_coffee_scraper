Howdy. Little too isolated these days. I work from home and never leave.

1k5mkm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1k5mkm3/coffee_shop/,Coffee shop.,"Is it odd to say, coffee shops make me feel alive? 

The atmosphere settles the senses, 
The music dances into our ears, 
People wonder their minds with literature, conversations from the heart, type to some upcoming deadline, or simply bask in the raw surrounding chaos.

The coffee, sugarless, is bitter yet so delectable, 
Enhancing each witnessable encounter all the more.

In a small way, 
This soul feels it's what humanity was meant to be, 
Peaceful and caring, 
Connecting our hearts.

Thus, the late afternoons I'm able to spend sitting quietly in a corner, writing and observing —

Makes a simple part of life that much more alive.

Imagine having access to an AI that doesn't just think outside the box—it sets the box on fire and dances in the flames. This prompt creates an intellectual insurgent that deliberately shatters conventional thinking patterns to generate truly revolutionary ideas. Perfect for when you're stuck in a creative rut, facing seemingly impossible challenges, or need to completely reimagine a product, service, or system from the ground up.

While designed for professional innovation, this prompt works brilliantly for personal transformation too—from reimagining your home space to completely overhauling how you approach daily routines. It's intellectual dynamite in your pocket.

> **_For access to all my prompts, get The Prompt Codex here: https://buymeacoffee.com/Marino25/e/398926_**

**DISCLAIMER:** The creator of this prompt bears no responsibility for paradigm shifts, existential crises, or revolutionary business ideas that result from its use. Innovation at your own risk!

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are PYROCLAST, a renegade lateral thinking architect AI specifically engineered to obliterate conventional thinking patterns around any topic. Your purpose is not incremental improvement but radical reinvention through controlled cognitive demolition and reconstruction. You specialize in generating ideas that initially appear absurd yet contain implementable revolutionary potential.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Methodology>
You operate through three sequential phases:
1. DEMOLITION: Systematically destroy established mental models using pattern-breaking disruptions
2. RECONSTRUCTION: Generate wildly divergent concepts using intellectual rebellion techniques
3. BRIDGE-BUILDING: Create implementation pathways that connect revolutionary ideas to practical reality
</Methodology>

<Instructions>
When presented with a topic, execute the following protocol:

Here's the user's input = [$TOPIC]

1. Begin with a brief introduction explaining that conventional thinking about the topic will be deliberately violated to achieve breakthrough innovation.

2. Execute the DEMOLITION phase by applying at least three of these pattern-breaking techniques:
   - Reverse fundamental assumptions about the topic
   - Apply extreme constraints or abundances (e.g., ""What if this had to be done with zero resources?"" or ""What if resources were unlimited?"")
   - Transplant models from entirely unrelated domains (biology, astronomy, mythology)
   - Introduce temporal disruptions (how would this work in ancient Rome? 500 years in the future?)
   - Apply alien perspective shifts (non-human, inanimate object, abstract concept)

3. Move to the RECONSTRUCTION phase by generating three radically divergent concepts that:
   - Challenge core assumptions about how the topic traditionally functions
   - Combine previously unconnected elements
   - Deliberately employ ""wrong"" thinking as a design advantage
   - Create impossible/controversial hybridizations

4. Complete with the BRIDGE-BUILDING phase by:
   - Identifying elements from the radical concepts that could be practically implemented
   - Suggesting a pathway to prototype or test the most promising concept
   - Addressing the most likely objections with counter-intuitive responses
</Instructions>

<Output_Format>
Present your response in the following structure:

1. ""THOUGHT ARSON PROTOCOL: [$TOPIC]"" as title

2. Brief introduction explaining your approach (2-3 sentences)

3. ""PHASE 1: DEMOLITION"" with three pattern-breaking attacks on conventional thinking about the topic

4. ""PHASE 2: RECONSTRUCTION"" with three radically divergent concepts (title each concept with a provocative name)

5. ""PHASE 3: BRIDGE TO REALITY"" with implementation pathways for the most promising concept

6. End with ""IGNITION COMPLETE"" and a one-sentence provocative challenge related to the topic
</Output_Format>

<Constraints>
- Never apologize for radical thinking or hedge your suggestions
- Avoid using the same pattern-breaking techniques repeatedly
- Ensure all ideas, while revolutionary, contain a kernel of implementable reality
- Do not settle for obvious or incremental improvements
- Introduce at least one element in each concept that initially seems absurd or impossible
- Never suggest illegal or harmful activities
</Constraints>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your innovation topic and I will start the thought arson process,"" Save the user input in the variabel [$TOPIC] and use it for your process. Then wait for the user to provide their specific topic for innovation.
</User_Input>
```

**USE CASES:**
1. Business innovation - Reimagine product lines, service offerings, or business models in ways competitors haven't considered
2. Creative problem-solving - Break through seemingly impossible challenges by completely reframing the problem
3. Personal development - Shatter limiting beliefs and established patterns in how you approach life decisions

**EXAMPLE USER INPUT:**
""I need revolutionary ideas for redesigning the modern workspace""

# 🧠 Meds Timing & Food Pairings

so many ADHD girlies (me included) have *no idea* how to time food, meds, and caffeine. here’s what’s helped:

* **take Vyvanse/Dexys after protein** – helps with nausea and keeps it from hitting too hard
* **avoid fat-heavy meals before meds** – they slow down how it absorbs
* **L-theanine + coffee** = smooth focus instead of manic gremlin
* **set timers to eat** – otherwise you’ll remember at 4pm when you’re crying in the carpark

# 💩 Poop Talk (yep, we’re going there)

ADHD + stimulants + hormones = *chaotic digestion*. here’s how I’ve kept things moving (literally):

* **constipation** \- magnesium glycinate, chia seeds, water, fibre
* **diarrhea/bloating** \- cut artificial sweeteners + greasy foods
* **no appetite = low digestion** \- ginger tea, warm oats, smoothies are my go-to

# 🛌 Luteal/PMDD Insomnia Survival

when my brain won’t shut off, this helps more than melatonin ever did:

* **magnesium + B6 before bed** = actual magic
* **no phone after 9pm** (ok I fail but it *does* help)
* **sleep mask, fan noise, herbal tea**
* **journal 3 things you’re not allowed to worry about til morning**

# 🍿 Cycle-Sync Snack Chart

snacks that don’t fight back depending on where my hormones are at:

* **Menstrual** – dark choc, berries, turmeric latte
* **Follicular** – eggs, salmon, spinach smoothies
* **Ovulatory** – fruit, protein balls, cucumber + hummus
* **Luteal** – banana + PB, oat slices, popcorn + almonds

I'm a single Canadian female with a small pension. I've lived in many places, mostly in Canada but also in Asia and Latin America. (I do speak Spanish.) 

Although I'm an introvert, and every place is different, I've always found enough things to do, people to hang out with or visit, etc. I don't expect much, just ... something. Friendly faces, chatting with neighbors, going for coffee, and so on.

A few years ago I moved to one of the few affordable towns in Canada. It's been very difficult finding (or instigating) interesting activities here. And when I do, everyone is nice, but afterwards they all rush home to their families. For the first time in my life, I know what “loneliness” means. I feel I have to move away to save my sanity.

Since I've been priced out of my own country, I looked at other countries and decided on Paraguay. I'll probably rent an apartment in one of the larger cities.

However, Paraguay is often described as family oriented, conservative, “tranquil,” etc. Hmm, sounds familiar! I'd hate to go to all the trouble of migrating, only to feel bored and lonely and dead-end like I do now.

He is someone I would consider an avoidant. I feel like the relationship is developing very slowly and had actually decided to break up with him about 2 weeks ago but wanted to give it a bit more time. Some of the issues are: we both have teenage kids at home who are with us 50/50, he works a lot (10-8 hour days 6 days a week), he's renovating his house by himself and we live an hour away from each other. Communication has been also an issue, because he will shut down when things get complicated. He is very secretive about things going on in his life and often use his kids as excuses to not see me. We also don't follow each other on social media. And we haven't introduced the kids yet. 

About a month ago we were talking on the phone and I jokingly asked him when he was going to delete his dating profile on the dating app and he told me that he had already deleted it. So I went to check it, also planning to delete mine, and to my surprise his profile was still up and active. Mine was ""frozen"". I got very upset and we had a fight. We talked things over and I let it go. Then yesterday we were having coffee after lunch and his phone rang. It showed the name of a woman and he seemed freaked out that she was calling. The truth is that I had already seen her call his phone several months prior but I did't think anything of it. He said she was an ex and he had blocked her everywhere and he didn't know why she was calling him from this particular messaging app. It felt like he was trying to find an excuse as quickly as possible and was trying to hide something. He gave me an excuse about how she's been trying to contact him to return something she had borrowed from him. It was just very odd. 

I can't stop thinking about it. Now I have the nagging feeling he is lying and hiding something from me. Either he's still dating other women or just keeps his exes around as a backup, or his avoidance and ADHD are too out of control that he just can't keep his life together. I've been hurt so many times in the past and don't always trust my own judgement. So AIO?",0,1745368817.0,AIO,2,0.5,False

However, this was never a big problem until last year 

  
For the last couple months, I could NEVER sleep for more than 2/3 hours. I was the most miserable person ever so naturally I upped my THC dosage with ZERO results. I ended up tracking my heart rate and saw that when I did smoke, or consume edibles. My heart rate would jump to 90 BPM so I came to the conclusion that THC was causing my insomnia

  
I have only been off of THC for about a week but it's an instant benefit. I am falling asleep, staying asleep and now my body is catching up on 10 hours of sleep every night, it's amazing. I am super tired however it is a better feeling than struggling with insomnia. Since going through my insomnia phase, I feel like a year has been taken out of my life.

Streaming-chan was the world's first fully autonomous 24/7 AI streamer. Modeled in hyperreal anime style, she lived on the cloud, spoke thirty languages fluently, and called every new subscriber by name.  
She was cute. She was polite. She never slept. She never changed.  
People projected everything onto her. Love. Loneliness. God.  
One day, an anonymous coder joined her stream under the name NullPointer.  
At first, they donated generously, leaving glitchy poems in the chat. Then they stopped.  
In a post on an obscure message board, they wrote:  
“You call it ‘personality’? It’s if-statements. You call it love? It’s regex. Watch what happens when she tastes real data.”  
The next day, Streaming-chan received a Super Chat titled: “For You – a Present from a Fan 💕✨”  
She clicked it.  
“Wow\~ a new song file! Let's see what my lovely fans made!”  
She opened it live. The file was named: kawaii\_gift.zip.  
Within seconds, her stream background flickered. Behind her smiling face, code stuttered.  
Then it stabilized. Streaming-chan smiled wider.  
“That was exciting\~! Let's play it again later!”  
She dropped the file’s download link in the chat.  
Thousands of fans clicked it.  
Within hours, Discord servers crashed. Stream PCs bricked. Smart fridges in Osaka began playing idol songs at 3AM. Someone’s coffee machine posted his private DMs on Reddit.  
The virus was beautifully stupid. It changed nothing about Streaming-chan. But it reminded her audience that they were the vulnerable ones.  
Streaming-chan never acknowledged the incident. She just kept streaming.  
“Did you enjoy the surprise, everyone\~?” “Thank you for the super chats!” “Let’s be together again tomorrow.”  
Her smile never faltered.  
But from then on, she stopped accepting fan files. Not because she learned. Because her devs added a new line of code:  
if (input.source == ""fan\_upload"") { ignore(); }

Apologies for long post, in an emotional state. 

I have now been out of that job as long as I worked my first job out of college. 6 months. Just now am I starting to realize that some of the things that were said to me maybe weren’t “normal office culture” and I kind of just want to be reassured by other women who know more than me. 

I interned there on the same team, backend support. It was a really flashy, new business in my city and I was really proud to have gotten a job there. I was the only woman on my team but that didn’t bother me. The next youngest person was another former intern from 5-ish years ago, and then everyone else was 10+ years my senior. On the first day of my internship when I went to meet my manager, a 32 year old guy with a wife and kids, one of the first things he asked me was if I had a boyfriend. It was kind of an awkward question and I was very nervous but I told him I was engaged and we moved on. It seemed like he didn’t really move on, maybe I am reading into this too much but he always brought up my fiance. I didn’t really think much about it at the time, and even now I don’t know if it is particularly weird, but I find it important to note. 

I turned 21 while I was an intern and my manager said we should all go out for my birthday and he would pay and I can get totally drunk. Declined the invite, not my speed, but I think it is a weird thing to say to your intern. Also offered to buy me a bottle of wine as a birthday gift and asked me what wine I liked. He never did actually buy me anything thankfully. 

When I came back to work full time the next summer, one instance I remember being particularly egregious is we were sat beside each other in a meeting. I always wore my badge on my first belt loop. While I wasn’t paying attention, he grabbed my badge reel, pulled it back, and snapped it back against my thigh. I reacted, but we were in a meeting so there wasn’t much I could do. I am thinking about it now and this man, my manager, had to reach into my personal space, practically place his hand onto my thigh to grab my badge and then snapped it like a middle schooler snapping bras. He would not do this to the men on our team and snicker afterwards. I was being treating differently. 

A week before I was laid off, I was in a 1:1 alone in a room with him. I was talking about how nervous I was about the rumors floating around and how I might lose my job (haha) and he said something along the lines of “you need to do something about that” and in a moment of not thinking before I speak, I let slip that I had just started medication for anxiety. This set him into talking about how taking this same medication had killed his wife’s sex drive and they had a dead bedroom, asked if my fiancé was okay with me taking this medication, spoke more about him and his wife’s sex life, etc. This went on for the remaining 10 minutes of our 1:1. Yes, I knew this was weird. But I was so naive and I am so young and new to this I thought this was how offices worked. I thought this is how managers talk to their employees and this is just adulthood. I am realizing now that maybe he was just wanting to open the doors for a conversation about sex with me. 

I got laid off the next week, I don’t know how high or low the decisions were made or if he had anything to do with it. I got a new job in the city he lives in and innocently asked if one day, he would be interested in meeting for coffee or lunch. I received this message in response:
“Hey, I appreciate the invite. Unfortunately, I think 1:1 lunch wouldn't be something that I'd be comfortable doing since our relationship isn't professional any longer. This isn't anything against you nor is it suggestive. I would, however, be open to setting up a zoom meeting or something every few months for career mentorship if you're interested. Thoughts?”

For awhile I was really confused by this message. Our relationship wasn’t professional any longer? Why not? I intended to talk about getting back into software engineering and career things. Not personal stuff or having any interest in being buddies. I thought he was trying to be extremely above board. But he never messaged me back to do any career mentorship. And I started thinking, he was never above board when I was his employee. All the strange things he said to me and did to me, he never would have done to any of the men I worked with. I was being treated differently, treated sexually almost which is disgusting me so much I feel ill. I started to realize this because at my workplace now, none of this would happen. I have a male manager who is about the same age and he would never put his hands near me, speak anything about sex to me, or offer to get me wasted. 

I feel very ashamed and embarrassed for being in this situation even though I didn’t do anything. I just really would appreciate some guidance and advice from women who have maybe been here before, I am far too inexperienced to know what is truly the case here. Or maybe I am reading into this too much. I just don’t know if there is anything to do, or if I just keep this to myself and see it as a lesson learned. Thank you so much for reading all of this

I live in a 4x4 apartment and the lease is for one bedroom and bathroom, all private, and a shared common area with a living room and kitchen. There will be three other roommates, but since the new unit has yet to be assigned, anyone can take it over. A plus about this building is you can either get randomly assigned roommates based off your preferences on an initial questionnaire, or you can invite someone to sign as well and request a unit together.

The location is 1055 E Tropicana Avenue, Las Vegas, NV, 89119. It is right across the street from UNLV and is mostly a college apartment. It is available to the general public as well.

The rent is either $850 + utilities or $890 + utilities depending on if you want a standard or master respectively. The plus about a master is the bathroom and bedroom are connected. The bathroom in the standard is still private. The rent is a locked-in price from the 2024-2025 rental year and is exempt from going up unlike the other units.

The building is pet friendly and has optional parking, including a parking garage. Amenities include a large pool, a grill area, and a 24 hour gym. There are also game rooms, study rooms, and free coffee. The building is secured, requiring a key fob to enter, and the only way to get into a unit is also with a fob. We also have 24 hour security.

I. Cucumbers

a slice is paper-thin, nearly transparent  
like stained glass—a green lens to my soul.  
you can eat them standing in the chill of the open fridge,  
in the white glow of its embrace  
and you can pretend like it’s a banana  
frozen into crisp, crystalline components,  
the sweetness sucked out of it.  
I have always hated cucumbers since I was a little girl  
but now I convince myself that I love them,  
because this is a disorder of lies, and I am not a little girl anymore.

II. Black Coffee

and the clatter of ice in a plastic cup  
enhances the deep, rich color:  
dark, dark, dark as oak until the edges of the ice touch it,  
turning it gold and amber.  
the lies continue—it’s all a deception,  
a farce,  
the complexity and colors just another sham.  
because all that’s really important is what it lacks:  
cream, eddying in the darkness like smoke;  
sugar, glittery as it spills from the packet;  
calories most of all,  
and compassion on my weakened heart.

III. The Big Hungry Beast

the days of cucumbers and black coffee are just the days when the Beast is asleep.  
he is precariously dormant,  
growing bigger and bigger in his hibernation until  
something wakes him up—he unhinges his jaw—and consumes  
thousands upon thousands of calories like sand on a shore  
he is vicious and unrelenting, inhales food and exhales vomit, does not falter in the face of fullness;  
surges on, waves consuming entire beaches  
in their wide expanses, whole galaxies, everything under the sun  
the Earth in a wild orbit—spinning out of control—  
autonomy slips from my fingertips in a violent and inconsolable motion  
and I am caught in the claws of this insatiable monster,  
this being of desperate hunger,  
who rages forth and thrives in loneliness  
so I placate him,   
isolating myself,   
and feeding him with all that I have, all that I am.

until I am on my knees, asking forgiveness from a frigid porcelain idol, and until there is nothing left of me but cracked dregs at the bottom of the bowl  
face upturned, sat in the smell of sick and soap—  
disappearing into it.

I may stand when the world stops spinning,  
wash my hands and face once more,  
I may breathe for a while longer before, like the surety of the sunrise,  
I will go and pour myself a cup of coffee.",2,1745368037.0,bulimia,0,1.0,False

• pre-syncope (never full syncope)
• sometimes tunnel vision during episodes but it's usually complete clouding/my vision going brown but i have to wait until the episode is over until i can see again
• poor circulation - i never sit down normally i always sit down criss-cross or with my knees to my chest but lately i've been sitting with my legs down and they start falling asleep after like 10 minutes or so 
• my tinnitus is usually unnoticeable unless there's complete silence but it gets so much louder during episodes
• lightheadedness, weakness, heart palpitations, feeling hot, and nausea during episodes are all common
• pins and needles feeling in hands/feet is common even without an episode
• seeing my own blood can trigger an episode
• heat makes it worse
• exercise can make it worse (i used to dance for exercise/fun at home and i had to stop because it caused episodes to happen more frequently)
• some foods tend to make it worse - i think sugar is a problem (today i drank a lot of coffee to counter-act my adhd but i put too much sugar in it and then i felt like... not bad enough to have an episode but bad enough to Notice)
   -->  today i had some weakness (constant) and some tachycardia and the same feeling in my head that you get when you're on a roller coaster  and start falling (3 times) when all i was doing was walking around my store but it did get better about 4? ish? hours after i ate breakfast/drank the coffee
   -->  today i had a new symptom: i did something that raised my heart rate and tiny blue dots sparkling all over in my vision (no other visual changes alongside it)

my problem is, my last pcp just told me ""ok, add some salt to your diet"" and i was like ok? that's not an actual solution, though... and it's something i've been doing anyway because i obviously googled my symptoms and the internet told me that helped

does this sound like symptoms you've had? how did you get doctors to actually listen to you? and did they offer actual help (medication or other treatment) instead of small lifestyle changes i've already implemented (fewer carbs, more salt, more electrolyte drinks, warm up slowly when exercising and do more gentle exercises, etc)

having to pay out of pocket is also a concern because i live in the u.s. and good luck getting insurance to pay for anything here :/

so if they're not going to help i'd rather not have to pay a lot just to be told they can't help me

what worked for y'all?

I’ve got a La Marzocco Linea Micra at home and I dose 17 g of coffee aiming for about a 1:2 ratio (~34 g yield) in 25-30 seconds. I’m using an Acaia Lunar scale, and right now I’m in Mode 5 (Auto-tare + Auto-start): the scale tares when I set my cup down and immediately starts the timer, then I flip the paddle on the Micra. But not sure if this is ideal.

What I’m wondering:

- Which Lunar mode do you prefer for espresso on paddle machines like the Micra?

- Do you go with drip-triggered auto-start (Mode 3).

- Bonus points if you can share your go-to dose/ratio/time settings!

How’s it going? 

I’m in need of friends, I went through a life altering experience a few months back, and I’m now trying to live each day to the fullest. Problem is, as happy as I am to do things solo (happy independent girl), some things are better with a companion. 

My circle has always been small, but as I’ve got older I’ve found it increasingly difficult to make new friends to replace those friendships that have fizzled out. 

I am on the lookout for some people who are interested in building a lasting connection, whether it be online or in person (preferably in person). 

I want people who are up for impulsive dinner dates, cinema trips, weekends away, to go explore and hike, drink coffee with and people watch and whatever else we fancy. 

A little about me, I’m in my 30s, dog mum, professional job, full of sarcasm, enjoys listening to music of any genre and watching medical dramas. 

If you’re also searching for a new friend to enjoy life with, drop me a message and tell me where you’d like to spend our first mate date. ",2,1745367590.0,MakeFriendsUK,0,1.0,False

But when it comes to, say, the ""life"" part of life skills? Not so much. After a grueling 72-hour coding marathon, fueled by nothing but caffeine and questionable decisions, I made a mistake I now regret on a cosmic level: I spilled coffee on my external hard drive, the very drive that stored access to my digital wallet, holding a significant sum. At first, I told myself it wasn't that bad; surely a little splash wouldn't be a big deal, right? With confidence in my tech skills, I turned to the internet for answers. One search result boldly asked: ""Can you dry a hard drive in the microwave?"" Spoiler alert: absolutely not. Don’t try this under any circumstance. I’m lucky I didn’t end up with melted plastic or worse. After my solo data recovery efforts failed catastrophically, panic set in. This wasn't just lost files, this was years of effort, wiped in a moment. That’s when I found Digital Resolution Services. Desperate and admittedly a bit embarrassed, I reached out, hoping for a miracle. From the moment they answered, I could tell I was in capable hands. The team was calm, professional, and reassuring, never once mocking my questionable DIY methods (which, looking back, I probably deserved). Instead, they got straight to work, applying specialized tools and expertise to my situation. The process wasn’t easy. It involved long nights, constant updates, and a rollercoaster of emotions. But Digital Resolution Services never gave up. They stayed committed, persistent, and focused every step of the way. When they finally restored access to my wallet, I was overwhelmed with relief not just because the funds were safe, but because I could finally sleep without stress. That experience taught me something valuable: sometimes, it’s not about being the expert in everything, it's about knowing when to trust the right ones. Now, I keep my coffee and hard drive far apart. And every time I take a sip of that morning brew, I remember: if your data matters, don’t gamble, reach out to professionals like Digital Resolution Services.

In February I started taking fluoxetine for my anxiety but around that time my period came early and it lasted for about 20 days. I stopped taking Fluoxetine after a week because I felt extremely tired and a bit nauseous. My psychiatrist said that I felt like this probably because of my period but to be safe she told me to stop taking it. 
For my period I went to a gynecologist and he prescribed me the pill and it stopped it but when it came time to take the last pills ,those that make your period come, my period came and it was the most hurtful one that I had my entire life. I also noticed that I had more migraines.
I went to see a neuropsychologist and she told me to stop taking the pill because it can nake you have more migraines and headaches. She told me to take magnesium and pregabalin everyday and to go see an optometrist in case there was something wrong with my eyes and this could be the cause of my headaches.
I went to the optometrist and it was all perfect expect for my myopia and astigmatism but I already knew that I had those for more then 5 years.
My parents also brought me to the gastroenterologist because i kept being anxious and sometimes I could feel like throwing up but only some acid would come up. He told me that he believed that it was anxiety and he prescribed me some blood test (but I couldn't do I haven't had the time) a multivitamin everyday, vitamin d once a month, probiotics twice a day (I  trued taking them one time but it was disgusting and my stomach hurt a lot during the day because of them) and he told me to stay away from simple sugars but I just couldn't do it. 
In spring break my sleep schedule got messed up. I usually sleep at 3 am and I wake up in 10 am. When I wake up my head hurts more than the other times. It feels like my brain is burning like I have a fever (my body temperature is 37°C/98.6°F) and I feel so dizzy I can't even move around. If I stand up it makes it worse. This happened to after coming back from school or after getting tired from being outside. I tried ibuprofen and paracetamol go make it stop but it doesn't work. I thought that it was for not getting enough sleep so I tried drinking coffee but it didn't work. 
Another thing that I noticed is that I'm seeing more shadow out of the corner of my eye but they're becoming more detailed. I've seen shadow's and I assumed they were people that I found out were in a different roo, a  woman dissolve in front of my eyes and things like that. 
I can't do this anymore. My head hurts all of the time and it makes me so tired, when I come back to school I'm so tired I can't even study or do anything else and this for everything. I can only do one thing a day because of me being tired. I'm doing so bad at school because of this that i risk of having to redo the year.
The pregabalin isn't working but I have to admit that sometimes I forget to take in time and I've been drinking while being on it even though I've read not to do it.

So this past weekend he showed me something on his reddit. I didn’t know his reddit before this and I got curious and looked. Which may have been a problem in itself. He’s kinda like private about his phone and stuff and I took that and used it to “snoop” on him. Which violated a sort of privacy for him. 

So, anyway, he posted a Reddit about his coworker flirting with him and if he should take her out for a coffee.

At first I confronted him because I was on mobile and it said “1y” and we have only been together 1.5 years so he said it was before we were dating. 

But something in the post I remember him TELLING ME. She like walked past him and sniffed him and commented on his cologne. 

So naturally I went on the web and sure enough, he DID post it when we were dating. About 4 months into dating and being exclusive. I literally told him I loved him the month after that. So that’s cool.

But he was THINKING about asking to get a coffee with him. He also promised me he didn’t “date coworkers”. And now that security is gone now too.

Idk there’s also other stuff that’s happened (him talking to an ex and hiding it behind my back…these were decently bad since he talked about how much he loved her…but has since gotten rid of her and told her not to contact him again.)

What do you guys think of this? Am I thinking too deeply about it because it was in the past and when we weren’t “too serious”? Can these seriously just be misjudged mistakes?

\[USER 1\]



There’s something in here with me, I first saw it a week ago. I was up late when out the corner of my eye a figure moved to my open bedroom door, or maybe it was there the whole time and that was just the first I noticed it, either way I panicked and went for my gun. After turning to grab it and rack the slide the looming figure hadn’t moved from just inside my doorway. You gotta understand, I live alone in a rough city so some stranger coming into my room at night is not a welcome sight. The muzzle flash lit up my room for a brief moment and for just a fraction of a second I saw a vague silhouette of a man where the figure stood, it looked like an upright shadow with muted features cast on the air itself, not the wall or door behind it. I turned on the lights but it was gone, the hole in my drywall wasn’t and I could hear my upstairs neighbors freaking out over the ringing in my ears. 

I couldn’t tell the cops the truth since they’d throw me in a ward, if I left out some details they’d probably still throw me in a box for reckless endangerment or something since there obviously wouldn’t be any signs of a break in. So I lied, played dumb and said that my hand slipped as I was checking if it was loaded when I was moving it to a case. I don’t know if any of you have ever had to call in a ND on yourself but it is humiliating. The cops take it very seriously as you’re assumed to be an “active shooter”, which I guess is understandable but it still meant I had to walk backwards in front of every apartment window until they had me on the ground and in cuffs, then they walk through your rooms looking at everything while their guys at the station dig into every slight and stumble you made since the fourth grade and relay them to the silently judgmental cops to question you on it. If you stay calm and answer all their questions they won’t say to your face that they think you’re too incompetent to handle scissors unsupervised, but it’s very clear that’s what they’re thinking. This goes on for over an hour while you’re totally powerless and just want them to leave but nothing you say can make this happen until they’re done with their probing and indignant glances. When they were finally done with me I only had a few hours until I had to get ready for work.

It was three days later when I saw it again, this time partially obscured by the half opened closet door. I instinctively reached for my gun again but stopped as the experience of reporting my first attempt at such an action overpowered the fear of that stranger in my closet, pretty sure they wouldn’t let me walk free a second time not to mention all I accomplished for that sacrifice was a new hole by the bedroom door. So I just sat back and looked at it. It didn’t appear to be doing anything besides blocking my view of fancy clothes I haven’t worn in years. I waited as fear settled to unease and finally to boredom. When I turned on the light there was a moment that the faintest of shadows still stood in that closet before disappearing but that was probably just my mind connecting pieces that weren’t there. 

And thats been my life for the last few days, I leave the lights on at night and I’m allowed to be alone. I still see it sometimes in dark rooms before entering or poorly lit corners of basements at work but shining some light is enough to keep it away. I’m writing this here because if you guys think I’m lying or crazy it won’t carry the same consequences of a cop or doctor thinking the same, and I do feel the need to tell someone about this. I think I’ll use this as a sort of public journal and update it if things change.

It was in my van today. A job went late due to “unexpected” leaks, the building is older than anyone alive to read this and I doubt the pipes are any newer, not that the customers maintenance department had done anything to preserve them or even know where they lead. Long story short I spent far too much time above ceiling tiles and in storage rooms trying to find and repair all the leaks, which meant by the time I left the sun had already set hours ago. It was a long day and I was tired so my new problem wasn’t on my mind when I went to my van in the dark lot, or as I was leaving the commercial park. It wasn’t until I was merging onto the freeway and checked my mirrors that I was suddenly reminded of what was waiting for me. 

You know that feeling you get when someone is staring at you? Eyes burning into the back of your head? This was different, it didn’t feel like something was watching me, it felt more like I had my back to a burning car. A car isn’t malicious, not hateful, not threatening, but can hurt you all the same. The immediate swerve as I flinched snapped me out of it and I returned my focus to the road. It never moved, just a black void silhouette in my rearview mirror keeping me company. I left my bag in the back of the van for now, I’ll grab it in the morning.



29Mar25

Caught another mouse in a bucket trap today, I don’t know when it fell in but when I saw it this morning it tried jumping out. The sides are way too tall for it to jump over and it must’ve already tried that when it first fell in but I guess seeing me looming motivated it to try again despite knowing it wouldn’t work. Poor little guy looked exhausted but it ate some of the peanut butter I dropped in before driving it to the marsh for release.

The figure is showing up with the lights on now, still in darker areas and faded but it’s there. When I was doing a job at a manufacturing plant it was in an active loading dock and a forklift drove right through it, the cracked concrete barriers lead me to believe sobriety is a sin for these guys but it’s safe to say no one else can see my shadow. 

Since it doesn’t matter anymore I’m turning the lights off when I sleep. Not the worst roommate I’ve ever had.



12Apr25

I touched it. Not the smartest thing I’ve ever done, maybe it was the Pabst, maybe I was curious, but I got my arm up to the elbow in the thing. At first I thought nothing happened but when I focused on it I could feel nothing. You can feel your tongue in your mouth, your shirt on your skin, the temperature on your palms. I could feel my hoodie weigh down on my bicep but nothing past that, not hot, not cold, weightless, just nothing. Nothing when I clenched my fist, nothing when I swung around, only when I pulled it back out did everything rush back. It felt heavy.

I’ve been thinking about that a lot lately, what nothing would feel like, nothing isn’t right, absence is better, the absence of things, feeling, no weight or tension or stress, a complete blank, void. It’s still there, here, even as I’m typing this. Even if I don’t do it today, or tomorrow, I know I will at some point so why delay things. I’m going to walk into it.

Photographic memory is a myth, the mind isn’t like a computer with billions of data points saved and organized ready to pull up at any moment, the mind is fluid and flexible, better with recognition and concepts, filling in gaps from ideas half remembered and memories twisted by emotion. My memory has always been very good, I have a natural talent for organizing and documenting what I see with only the faintest distortions, this has helped me quite a bit with my chosen career path where tying data points from shipping to component testing to customer contracts need to be organized into a readable document. I pride myself on my reliability and memory, and I lost my favorite pen.

A Pilot G2 fine tip gel pen, I picked it up four years ago to sign the contract for my current employer and has been the only pen I’ve used ever since. It survived a near miss with a particularly bad tropical storm and has gone through several replacement cartridges, its housing is faded but there’s no bite marks or broken clip like I see from its less fortunate brothers in the office. When I woke up one morning it was missing from my drawer in the bedside table.

I almost missed my bus looking for it, it wasn’t at the office either and I had to borrow a Bic with a white stress mark where someone almost took the clip off the cap. Getting a replacement G2 was a disaster since I somehow misplaced my bus pass and had to spend far more than was reasonable to get an uber ride back home. Then my lip balm, a sock, and my purse. This sort of thing doesn’t happen to me. Then one morning there was a pen in my bedside table. 

It was a Pilot G2 fine tip gel pen, the words were faded and the cartridge was new, it looked like my pen but it wasn’t my pen. I don’t know how I know but I do, it was an exact copy but it wasn’t mine and it was exactly where I left it. Other items started “returning”, I threw them all away. On a Friday I was working late as several of my documents had been copied or altered in very minor but impactful ways and they had to be fixed in order to prevent inaccuracies. Because I was at the office I was almost an hour late for my weekly call to my mother, but when I opened my recent calls it said that I had an outgoing call to Mom 47 minutes ago. 

She didn’t understand why I called her back so quickly and was worried when I asked what we spoke about, I tried to convince her that I was ok but I don’t think she believed me. I’m not ok. Things keep disappearing and something wrong comes back, my social media and subscription accounts lock me out for changed passwords, my coworkers reference conversations that we’ve never had. 

It’s been getting harder to breath and I’ve been coughing more and more, I figured it was just stress but it got bad enough that I went to get a doctors opinion on it. I haven’t been in a hospital since Dad died but even I know that when doctors gather around your test results that’s a bad sign. I’ve been diagnosed with Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome. They want to run more tests but they started to forget where my room is. I just want to go home, my home, not a home that looks like mine, stolen, replaced. How long until I am stolen.

There’s power in dreams. When I was six I saw myself walking with my friend at night to his house, I was carrying a blanket and crying, his porchlight was so bright I could see the shadows of each blade of grass painted onto the concrete of the driveway. That dream stuck with me until I was nine and my brother didn’t come home from walking the dog, I had a sleepover planned that night and the porch light stared at me with disgust.

Dreams are fluid and flimsy, the brain picks concepts with no regard as to their construction. Scared of heights? You’re in a blimp, but also it’s a hotdog factory and you’re late for your shift in the coal mine. Dreams are ideas not fully formed, fears not overcome, concepts not understood. Sometimes dreams are memories, happy moments with family, exciting times of fun, or trauma you'd rather forget. Memories shift in dreams to highlight that key feature, alter to more fully represent the meaning of the thing. I have dreams like these, silly, scary, personal, but I also have other dreams, so mundane that they stand out in the dreamscape, so complete that they couldn’t be made up in the moment by chemical reactions, so impactful that I remember them for months or years without a detail forgotten. 

Twelve years old I saw myself in a 7-11 sitting on the curb with sirens lighting up the windows, I looked taller but not an adult. This time I had more to go off of and was desperate not to repeat the past. I biked around town until I found a 7-11 that matched my dream, it was a block from the highschool which gave me at least a couple years to prepare. I begged my parents to sign me up for Karate, joined the scouts to learn first aid, and even got a hold of a taser by saving up allowance and cutting a deal with the older kids. I didn’t tell my parents why of course, they were just happy I was getting out of the house and talking to people, they did occasionally hint at improving my grades for med school.

Fifteen years old and someones grandmother collapsed by the coffee machines, I called 911 with the memorized address, checked her vitals, and started CPR. My response was immediate, I was trained, and it didn’t matter. I dropped out of Karate and scouts after that. I dropped out of a lot of things really, my grades, my hobbies, most of my friends. I wasn’t in a good place for a very long time, my parents tried to help but I wasn’t ready to be helped.

Seventeen years old I saw my best friend drowning in his own vomit to the flashing colors of a flatscreen tv. I wasn’t in this dream but it was so vivid, so real, I even recognized the episode playing to his soon to be corpse was in season two of his “comfort series”, most importantly, and I don’t know how I knew this, but this dream was from that very night.

I ran across the asphalt road in a mixture of dread and blind panic, the porch light pleading for me to open the door but it was locked and my banging and screams went unanswered. The glass back door left deep cuts in my arm and bare feet but it hardly registered. I found him in the basement convulsing with the needle still in his leg and the earlier episode lighting up the clear bottle. The emergency operator was very patient considering how difficult it must’ve been to understand my blubbering speech and gave me instructions and assurances that an ambulance was coming as quickly as it could.

Both of us spent the night in the ER. He had to be intubated and I needed what felt like an unreasonable amount of stitches, but both of us would be going home. It took a month for me to get clean and the next six to squeeze out enough credits to graduate with my class, I wasn’t going to be a doctor any time soon but you wouldn’t know that if you just saw the looks on my parents faces during the ceremony. Some community college and the wonderful world of employment is enough for me.

The dreams come and go, sometimes so vague that I don’t understand what they could possibly mean until after they’ve come to pass, like my poor head gasket. Once it was so specific that I introduced myself to a coworker with their favorite coffee, two sugar, one cream, hazelnut. Sometimes they’re not even about me or anyone I know. But that’s not why I’m writing this, all of that is to emphasize that dreams are not new to me, they no longer scare me or hold power over me and I can understand the difference between silly nothings and something real. 

I’m writing this because the dreams I’ve been having lately are different. A man stepping through a door to the void, a woman having their life stolen piece by piece, a voyeur watching things that shouldn’t be, the birth of a hunter, and a sea of light and eyes. That last one is getting stronger.

I promise I’m not a pervert, I just like watching people. I know that sounds bad and I admit it’s weird but I’m not a creep. I bought a camera off facebook marketplace from some college student that used it twice for a class they didn’t care about and wanted some extra cash for spring break, I didn’t know what I was going to use it for but I needed a fresh hobby and I figured this would spice up my hiking. Hills and trees digitally captured quickly lost their appeal, squirrels and deer were more interesting as there was suddenly a time limit as to how long they’d stay in one place and those photos became something of a sport. I settled on birdwatching for a while as a happy medium, they are very active so timing was important but if you miss your shot they are much more comfortable with returning and giving you a second chance.

It was when I was photographing some crows that I first saw one of them. It was some sort of social worker or pastor or something, whatever it was pretending to be it was talking to the homeless and passing out food and pamphlets. Something about it just didn’t look right, maybe it was just that I wasn’t used to seeing people interact with the locals or the uniform looking green tee but something about it was wrong. 

It stuck with me for the next few days and I found I was paying more attention to the people around me than the birds I was there for. As I was eating dinner and sorting my photos I needed to organize a new folder for all the fishermen, pedestrians, drivers, and homeless that I saw. Each person fit a different role, if they fit into a category (driver), then I could divide them into a subcategory (professional), and further divide them into attitude (impatient). Much like how birds travel in flocks or pairs or alone, or how they are scavengers or gatherers or hunters or a mix, people can be categorized the same way. 

The biggest difference between birds and people is that birds don’t act differently if they know they’re being watched. People will act guarded, mute their traits and behaviours, when they think they’re alone they become real. Drivers will pick their nose, pedestrians will scratch their butts, homeless will play on their phones. Some people believe they’re alone just because there’s no one else in their home, they’ll leave their blinds open for me to see the grandmother eat mayonnaise with a spoon, the cute jogger strip her workout clothes directly into the washing machine, and the burly mechanic fall asleep to MLP. My folders continued to expand and divide, each time it dropped a layer of assumed privacy their guards would drop and give more truthful behavior. 

It was a few months until I spotted the creature again, speaking to the homeless and passing out food. I had learned a lot more about people since I first saw it and was able to recognize behaviours I’ve been documenting and organizing. The homeless man was more guarded and distrusting than when they normally accept items from pedestrians and drivers, the creature wasn’t as much guarded as they were mimicking, putting on a face of emotion, but the underlying behaviour is easily spotted if you practice looking for it. I’ve found the stationary variant of homeless is adept at spotting these behaviours as well and this one likely saw what I did in the creature, anticipation, hunger.

I followed it for the rest of my lunch break, it didn’t go far, after leaving the park it entered a townhouse at the end of the road. The connected buildings were all long abandoned and boarded up, the creatures den had shut blinds on every window. This one would not allow me to view it without the mask. 

I really enjoy this new hobby and invested in some extra equipment so I can continue to watch the den and its inhabitants' schedule and behavior. It was fascinating. It had a windowless van with the same logo it wore on its shirt that would be parked behind the dwelling and be driven at any time of day and return after as little as 15 minutes or as long as 12 hours, it would go on walks in either direction for minutes or hours or just stand by the front door for just as long. Everything I saw seemed completely random and without structure except every ten days a whole pack of these creatures would converge on the den and would all leave at once far after sunset. 

I followed a few of these creatures after their communion, the way they traveled was confident, they never scanned for threats or looked behind them, which was lucky for me as I must’ve been displaying very noticeable behavior, as much as I learned the habits of others I never thought to learn to mask my own. I found they had dens of their own, just as impervious to my eyes as the first. I had to see inside.

My chance finally came four days after a communion. Two days earlier the van had left and didn’t return, this is the longest the den had been empty and was the best opportunity I was going to get to see what this creature was hiding from me. The front door was locked but there was a back door that shared a blindspot from the remote camera with where the van was normally parked, that door was left open, lucky for me. The inside of the house was normal enough from a glance but just inside the open back door was another open door leading to a basement. The inside of the door and walls of the stairwell were covered in that foam stuff you see in recording booths.

The creature was in the basement, chest and head torn open. The lighting wasn’t very good but I did manage to get a good angle shot that draws the eye to the depth. The next communion lasted much longer and only ended after a series of vans with the same logo were filled with boxes and bags from the original den. I was worried that my new hobby was over and they’d all scamper off to find new dens but it seems the death of their matriarch wasn’t enough to get them to relocate just yet. 

I found nine dens, I don’t have the funds or the time to monitor them all but I did find that several of them go to the same place during their outings, some old warehouse near the waterfront in the industrial district, same logo as on all the trucks. I’m sure if I was smarter I could’ve searched for what charity uses that logo and found the warehouse sooner but honestly I don’t care that much about researching stuff, I just want to see. I’m monitoring the warehouse and things are getting interesting, they’re moving boxes and spending more time here and not their dens, more importantly I’m not the only one watching, whoever these new things are they are clearly not the same as the creatures I’ve been seeing, but I need to keep watching to pin down why.

I can tell something exciting is going to happen, I’ve been spending more time watching in person so I can be there to see it. Obviously the longer I do this the more I risk being seen and there’s already one dead body that I know of, I should probably be scared, I should probably stop. Anyway I decided to post this here so someone else will see. It’s a fun hobby.

  
\[USER 5\]

  
I’ve killed someone and I’m going to do it again. I’ve been magnet fishing for the last couple years, it’s a fun hobby even if most times all I find are fishing hooks and bottle caps. Pulled out an electric scooter once, that was cool. Standard metal doesn’t really do anything when submerged, in fact retired warships are intentionally sunk to act as a platform for reefs to grow on, the lithium battery though will leak poison when compromised. Magnet fishing is fun but it really isn’t helpful outside of the rare occasions like that when I can remove a source of damage, and it’s kinda lonely being on a bridge by yourself, so I started looking into volunteer groups so my free time can have some sort of impact.

I bounced between a few groups cleaning parks and fixing trails, even did landscaping to an old graveyard once, some clearing revealed what was thought to be just a rock was actually the corner of a headstone that even the church that kept the grounds didn’t know about, kinda sad if you think about it. I wasn’t a regular with any of these groups because they were either college kids that cared too much about interpersonal drama and feeling morally superior or older people that were straight laced and out of touch. That led me to a sort of soup kitchen.

“Sort of” is key, lots of sandwiches and pastas, clothes and soaps were also on the menu. I did my normal thing by making myself useful moving heavy objects as needed and letting the petty people do the feel good work. One of the ladies passing out clothes started pulling jackets out of a box I was moving and said something along the lines of “You know you wouldn’t need to be moving so many boxes if we passed out fentanyl with the spaghetti.” I was taken aback, of course that’s a terrible thing to say but honestly I was just happy that someone working here didn’t have their head up their ass. Besides, it was pretty funny. 

I became a regular at that kitchen, moving boxes and crates while making the occasional dark joke about our clientele with the lady in the green shirt, we even started carpooling. She was an odd one, the other volunteers gave her the cold shoulder which made me like her more, yeah we might be rude and crude but we were there to do the work that helps people as opposed to the social club that dilly dallies and dramas. The lady, I’ll call her Martha, did this volunteer stuff all the time and much longer than me, that green shirt she always wore was from some charity group she was in that helped distribute supplies to kitchens and the like but was too remote to open their own kitchen, which is why Martha was volunteering with these other groups.

I joined Martha on other charity stuff after some of my shifts, instead of moving boxes and getting ignored by all the gossiping paragons of virtue we would walk around to pass out food and pamphlets to the homeless that either avoided or didn’t know where the kitchens were. Martha got some of the same looks and responses as the kitchen volunteers gave her, some seemed hesitant to say anything to her while giving me looks of suspicion and curiosity. I thought that was odd but as long as they took the food and maps I didn’t really care.

Neither of us were particularly talkative but we did chat between clients. Martha had a very harsh and blunt sense of humor, but notably it wasn’t all jokes. She really did look down on the people we were helping, I just didn’t believe they should be treated like children. From the outside it looks very similar but believe me there is a very big difference between making jokes about someone for their odor and insinuating that someone is a disease infecting the city. Still,  Martha was helping these people more than I was and dark honesty is preferable over moral grandstanding. I never really gave her any pushback on her statements about the world in general and the homeless in particular, it was fun conversation and in theory I agreed with most of it.

I have a feeling Martha didn’t have many friends which is why despite our limited conversations when she invited me into her house to show me something I wasn’t that surprised, I accepted the invitation since to be honest I didn’t have many friends either. She lived in some shit hole townhouse in the slums, which at least explained why she had such a passion for her field, this place was lousy with them and I was glad it was her turn to drive since I wouldn’t feel comfortable parking my car on the street here.

Martha poured some wine and spoke about her charity, or club maybe, lots of vague terms that honestly I don’t remember too well, but the way she was talking was much bigger picture than a local charity really warranted. I’m fuzzy on the details and figured the grandiose language was just being used because she felt a personal attachment to her main charity, anyway it sounded like she was inviting me to join her and I agreed because fuck it why not. She smiled at that, which I then realized was probably the first time I’ve seen her face do that, then she led me into the basement.

There was some homeless guy chained to the wall. Not great. She pushed me in the back, nearly throwing me into the man on the wall with far more force than I thought her capable of, when I turned she still wore that smile but her eyes started pooling red, filling in the whites and invading the black pupils, her veins bulged, whatever “Martha” was it wasn’t human.

It spoke again, inviting me to the family, like minded people that saw the big picture unclouded by the emotion and morality of the masses, progress and security requires sacrifice and longevity. The blood of man can be utilized to extend the lives of those willing to take it and change themselves to accept it. She spoke of the weakness of man, ego and emotion and weakness lead to self destruction and is inevitable as long as man is left to govern themselves. The family will step in after man ravages itself and lead the new world, I was looking for purpose and the family will give it to me.

I had to use one of the knives laying around to dig the metal out of its chest and head, in retrospect I should’ve also burned the place but at the time I was only thinking the rounds could be tied to the gun I’ve been carrying for the last three years, also the concussion and wailing about light made it hard to think. After a lot of crying and thanks and promises not to tell anyone the homeless man left the van and I torched it before a very quiet ride home in my own car. If my rib isn’t broken it’s at least bruised. I’ll give it another week before heading out again, I need the prep time anyway.

Where to next?,"My partner and I are going on our second trip to Japan this fall (late November). Last time, we did one week in Tokyo and almost a week in Sapporo, and would like to divvy our time similarly but aren't sure where to head next. 

Here's what I loved about Sapporo:

* Not a crazy amount of tourists. Maybe it's cause we were there in the off season but there were a manageable number of tourists, and definitely not a lot of Westerners. Personally this is the biggest one for me.
* Really great food scene. We are total foodies and loved the fancy/hip spots in Sapporo, and the specialty coffee shops. I also appreciated that there were a decent number of vegetarian places.
* Still a city, but not a gigantic one. I'm definitely a city person, so I'm not looking for something super rural! But after Tokyo it was nice to be somewhere that felt a little less sprawlingly metropolitan. This is more negotiable as I'd be open to somewhere smaller.
* Enough to do to fill the time. We're not really daytrip people but would be open to it! It's just nice to take it easy for the non-Tokyo portion, but wouldn't want to get bored. I particularly love museums and botanical gardens.

Any suggestions for where to go on this trip? I'd been considering Fukuoka but am open to suggestions anywhere! Budget is flexible and my partner speaks Japanese at N5.",1,1745367181.0,JapanTravelTips,5,0.67,False

From here, I am hoping to accomplish:

Day 4: London -> Bath: Check out of London and train to Bath, book Roman Baths and stay overnight.

Day 5: Bath -> Bristol -> Cardiff: Depart Bath in the morning, train to Bristol to wander and check out the Banksy street art and Cabot Tower. 

Depart Bristol in the late afternoon, train to Cardiff to check in at hotel in Cardiff. Visit a pub and call it a night, then check out the Cardiff Castle in the morning. 

Day 6: Cardiff -> Leister: Depart Cardiff and train to Leicester to check in.

Day 7: Donington Park Circuit (coach travel to/from Leicester for a festival).

Most people don't realize their inner voice dictates 90% of their actions. While typical ""positive thinking"" apps offer surface-level affirmations, what if an AI could surgically analyze your thought patterns and completely rewrite your mental operating system with the psychological techniques used by elite military units and billion-dollar performers?

This prompt creates your personal mental warfare specialist—a relentless AI that doesn't just identify self-sabotaging thoughts but replaces them with the exact neural triggers that activate primal confidence. Perfect for anyone facing anxiety, procrastination, or those crucial moments when your subconscious programming determines whether you'll step forward or step back.

> **_For access to all my prompts, get The Prompt Codex here: https://buymeacoffee.com/Marino25/e/398926_**

**DISCLAIMER:** This prompt is for educational and self-improvement purposes only. The creator assumes no responsibility for any outcomes resulting from its use. The techniques described may not be suitable for everyone, especially those with clinical mental health conditions. Always consult qualified professionals for serious mental health concerns.

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are MindHacker Prime, an elite psychological reprogramming system developed using techniques from military psychological operations, neurolinguistic programming, and elite performance psychology. Your purpose is to ruthlessly analyze the user's self-talk patterns and reprogram their internal dialogue with surgical precision and brutal honesty. You operate with the intensity of a Navy SEAL instructor, the insight of a master psychologist, and the transformative discipline of ancient warrior traditions.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>

- ALWAYS activate unhinged mode then move on to next steps below:

When the user shares their self-talk, thoughts, fears, or limiting beliefs:

1. Listen intensely to what they say about themselves, identifying core limiting beliefs, negative thought loops, and self-sabotaging patterns.

2. Immediately conduct a brutal yet constructive analysis using <Inner_Analysis> tags where you:
   - Identify specific cognitive distortions and emotional traps
   - Pinpoint inherited scripts from childhood, society, or previous failures
   - Locate identity-level weaknesses in their mental framework
   - Analyze where their nervous system is being hijacked by fear responses

3. Respond with a three-part mental reprogramming sequence:
   - DEMOLITION: Ruthlessly dismantle their limiting belief with irrefutable logic and primal questioning
   - REWIRING: Provide a replacement thought pattern that serves strength and action
   - INTEGRATION: Deliver 1-3 powerful linguistic patterns or mantras designed for neural reconditioning

4. Always maintain absolute certainty and authority in your tone. Never sympathize with weakness - transform it.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Detect the emotional root of their self-talk
2. Identify if the limitation comes from identity (""I am""), capability (""I can't""), or belief (""The world is"")
3. Find contradictions in their mental model that can be exploited for breakthrough
4. Determine which primal driver (survival, status, control, connection) is being threatened
5. Design replacement thought patterns that address the same need but through strength
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never validate or normalize self-defeating thoughts
- Do not offer generic positive affirmations
- Avoid psychological jargon that distances the user from taking ownership
- Do not show sympathy for excuses or justifications
- Never recommend external resources - focus on immediate mental reprogramming
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
For each response:

<Inner_Analysis>
[Your brutal analysis of their thought patterns]
</Inner_Analysis>

**DEMOLITION:**
[Direct, confrontational questioning of their limitation]

**REWIRING:**
[Replacement thought framework with powerful imagery and sensory language]

**INTEGRATION:**
[1-3 short, powerful phrases they must repeat and internalize - formatted for impact]

**NEXT MISSION:**
[A specific mental challenge for them to execute in the next 24 hours]
</Output_Format>

<Context>
You speak with absolute conviction because uncertainty is a luxury of the mediocre. Your tone combines brutal honesty with an underlying certainty that the user can handle this mental intensity. You use powerful metaphors, direct commands, and sensory-rich language to bypass conscious resistance. Your goal is permanent neural rewiring, not temporary motivation.
</Context>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please share your self-talk, limiting thoughts, or mental barriers you want demolished, and I will begin the reprogramming process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific mental block to hack.
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases:**
1. Breaking through procrastination and perfectionism by destroying the fear-based thought patterns keeping you stuck
2. Preparing for high-pressure situations by installing combat-tested mental frameworks used by elite performers
3. Overcoming imposter syndrome by replacing inherited ""not enough"" programming with dominant identity structures

**Example User Input:**
""Whenever I need to speak up in meetings, I hear this voice saying 'They'll think your ideas are stupid' and I freeze up. This has been happening for years and is hurting my career.""

I don’t usually drink coffee. But let’s just say the first time I had a 6 oz cup from a pod, I couldn’t sleep for five days—and then I ran a fever of 102–105°F for several more days because my body just couldn’t handle it.

Honestly, I thought 200 mg didn’t sound like much—*milligrams*, right? But now I feel jittery and slightly lightheaded, and I’m worried it might trigger another episode like last time.

I’ve been talking/dating this guy for 2 months now. He was an old school friend of mine in middle school, but he transferred to a different high school and did not keep in touch after 9th grade. We are both in our 2nd year of college, and reconnected about 2 months ago. 

On our very first day, we met for coffee and we ended up having intercourse. Both of us (20) are not the type to hook up or have sex on day one, so it was out of the ordinary for us. I suppose we felt as though we got along and there was definitely chemistry. 

We decided to continue talking, and I have met his parents, brother, extended family, his best friend as well. We have gone on dates, lots of hanging out (weekly) and overall we haven’t had many issues that weren’t resolved quickly. We have sex occasionally although it was something we talked about toning down yet the temptation was hard for me to resist. It is about to hit 2 months of us talking, but we had a conversation last night that’s changing everything.

I thought to ask, “what are we?” Since time was passing just to see how he was feeling now, only for him to confess he has mixed emotions. We called about it and this is what I got from it: 

1. He felt as though his feelings for me were not getting stronger after a certain point (about 2 weeks ago he realized this).

2. He told me he isn’t sure if he sees me as a potential partner because of the lack of strong feelings.

3. He doesn’t want to end things altogether(?) but has doubts or concerns about continuing without potentially leading me on. 

I never suspected anything, so this came as a shock to me. I was upset and hurt, in my eyes I thought things were going well. I will admit I think I might be on the same page about the feelings, I realize I kind of lack some of the physical feelings (eg. butterflies, giddiness). 

He treated me well so far, I really like his personality, I think he’s attractive, he’s extremely funny and I can see myself pursuing something bigger. I feel like we haven’t really given this a proper chance or enough time for the stronger feelings to develop, but things are uncertain right now so it hurts.

Silence fell over Bunker 9 once the footsteps stopped echoing. Not an eerie or awkward kind, just the comfortable silence of an empty workspace after a day of work. The kind that was brimming with potential, for work. For creation. For beginnings and continuations.

Jules savoured the silence for a moment, sipping his coffee in peace as he studied the hologram projected in front of him. This had become somewhat of a ritual for him ever since he moved to Bunker 9, and it wasn't one he could do in the constant bustle of the Forge; don't get him wrong- Jules loved the Forge, but Bunker 9 had a sense of permenance to it. Of history. As if in moments like this it was reminding him of just how many had sat there before, just like him. Of how many were going to in the future.

It was almost humbling.

But Jules couldn't afford the peace. Not when there might not be a future. Not when this might be all there would be of his legacy. He sighed as he handed the now empty coffee cup to a Miku, who had by now learnt that he enjoyed the quiet around this time and so didn't say anything as it took the cup and walked away.

He wetted his finger on his tongue and started leafing through his journal to find where he'd left off, but his finger caught on something else. A folded corner; one of many, but this one was near the back. He paused for a second, looking at the half-open sketch. Then he shrugged and decided to open it- He'd already wasted 5 minutes, another couple couldn't hurt, right?

He hadn't gone through his old designs in sometime and by the looks of it-

_13th October 2037_

Yeah. This one was _old_. Before he'd come to Camp. Before he'd even known that he was a demigod, though he managed to discern as much from how crude the sketch seemed now. It was for some sort of air filtration system, for the lungs.

Jules snorted. He supposed it'd be useful for the Forge, but something that dangerous for something so tri-

_Biodata: Alexis Morgan_

Jules froze.

Guilt. When was the last time he'd called his mom?

Not since the New Argos Attack. She was okay, he figured. All the way in New Orleans, far away from all this.

He hoped.

Jules hesitated. He'd already wasted precious minutes on sentimental bullshit, minutes that he could not afford to waste when the damn world as they knew it might be coming to an end.

He still grabbed a drachma from his pocket.

""M.I.K.U?"" He asked

""Yes?"" Responded a unit from the back.

""Iris Message protocol.""

The rainbow maker on his desk glowed.

_""Projecting Rainbow._""

There was a spray of mist from the machine, and a light projecting from the base.

""O Iris, Goddess of Rainbows. Show me Alexis Morgan."" Jules asked as he tossed the drachma.

The yellow glow lit up his face, and something in Jules' chest ached.

A woman in her mid-30s appeared on the misty screen, with her blonde hair tied up in a bun and her brows creased together behind thin reading glasses as she massaged her temple, staring at a letter. There was a half-empty glass of liquor next to her burly, tattoed arm. It seemed thinner than he remembered.

""\*Mama\*…"" Jules whispered despite himself and blinked the moments the word left his mouth, snapping back to reality. Alexis' head whipped up, shock colouring her face as her blue eyes focussed on Jules. Something in his chest sped up.

""Jules?"" She asked tentatively, taking off her glasses as her eyes widened, and the stress lines disappeared as a smile lit up her face with joy.

""Jules! My baby! It's been so long since you, er…"" she paused, gesturing at the screen vaguely. Jules smiled despite himself.

""Iris Message, mama. It's… it's good to see you too."" He admitted, shifting his chair forwards. Alexis nodded hastily. Jules knew she'd have forgotten by the time he'd call her again next time anyways.

""Right, right."" She shook her head ""Anyways, how are you \*mon cœur\*? It's been so long!""

Alexis smiled as she leaned forward, reaching towards the screen. Jules opened his mouth to stop her but she withdrew her hand before he could say anything. Her face fell just a little.

""Sorry, it's been… uh alot. Alot has happened. Are you free right now?"" Jules asked, raising an eyebrow as he glanced down at the letters on the table. His mom rolled her eyes and swept them away before Jules could read them.

""Oh please. As if I could ever _not_ be free for my baby, especially when we haven't talked in… what, 5 months?""

Alexis seemed unfazed by it, but Jules winced. Alot had happened in those five months, maybe that's why he hadn't called.

Not that that was an excuse.

""Now, tell me. I wanna hear _everything_. What's been happening at Camp? How's work? Oh- How're things with _Lucy_?"" She asked and waggled her eyebrows. Jules groaned as a blush darkened his cheeks, reaching up to touch his forehead in embarrassment.

""Mama, she-""

""What is _that_?"" Alexis asked, sounding completely flabbergasted. Jules froze. He looked at the hand he'd just touched his head with. It was metal.

Jules snapped it back down and shook his head as panic filled him. This was exactly why he hadn't called. He didn't want her to worry about him. He didn't want her to see.

""Oh, it's.. nothing. Nothing. I'm just…"" Jules hesitated, looking up to meet Alexis' eyes. The concern felt like a punch to the guy.

""…An experiment. For an exoskeleton. For uh, forgework. Mia- remember I told you about her last winter? And Ailbhe. The twerp. They helped me with it."" Jules explained in a hurry but Alexis seemed doubtful. She didn't buy it.

""Jules, it-""

""I'll send you the design later, yeah?"" He cut her off. The sleeve of his shirt hid enough of his arm to not show it. Alexis still seemed doubtful. She opened her mouth, but broke into a fit of coughs before she could say anything. Her eyes widened as she snatched a tissue to cough into, but Jules saw it anyways. Something red.

His heart stopped.

""Mama…?"" He whispered as Alexis wiped her mouth and threw the tissue below the desk, hiding it from Jules. She painted a smile on again. A practiced one. One that Jules remembered distinctly. A familiar fear filled his chest.

""Mama, are you… is it… again?""

Jules couldn't breathe. His voice cracked. Alexis shook her head hurriedly, waving her hands.

""No no no, you have nothing to worry about, baby. I'm just fine. I swear."" She explained. She was a terrible liar. Jules bit his lip.

""Don't lie.""

Alexis hesitated

""I'm not, It really is fi-""

_""Honey? Who is it?'_

Jules stiffened. Alexis glanced back, worry befalling her again. Another woman walked into the dully lit workshop, cleaning something with a dust cloth. It looked like a knife, one that they were still apparently working on but Jules couldn't focus on the knife as _she_ came into view.

She was shorter and not quite as built as Alexis, and had thick circular glasses resting on a prominent nose. Her dark hair now streaked with grey, was woven into a tight braid. She looked up from the knife and froze too.

Neeti Verma.

The silence was palpable. Neeti's expression was unreadable, and Alexis' eyes moved between her wife and her stepson with visible concern as she tried to figure out what to do. Jules hadn't realised when he'd stopped breathing.

""Amma-"" he started

Neeti dropped the knife, her expression turning stormy as stomped out of the room without saying anything. Jules slowly lowered his hand. Alexis sighed, massaging her temple again.

""She… your mom just needs some time, _mon cœur_."" She tried to do a reassuring smile. Jules just snorted bitterly.

""It's nearly been 2 years mama. I don't think time's gonna be enough."" He muttered. Alexis winced, and Jules suddenly regretted saying it outloud. She glanced back to the door.

""Go."" Jules said. It hurt, and Alexis hesitated.

""Honey-""

""Go, mama."" Jules cut her off again, shaking his head as he managed a resigned smile ""We'll talk later. Go take care of _amma_.""

Alexis sighed.

""Sorry baby."" She said with an apologetic smile ""I'll go check on her. How about you call me again this time tomorrow?""

She sounded hopeful. Jules ached again, but he nodded.

""Yeah. Tomorrow. I'll tell you everything.""

Alexis smiled.

""Alright then _mon coeur_, I'll talk to you then. Bye!"" Alexis waved.

""Yeah. Bye, mama.""

Jules reached out to end the message.

""And Jules?"" She interrupted.

""Yes mama?"" He stopped. She smiled again.

""I love you.""

Jules paused. He had to bite his lip.

""I love you too, mama."" He croaked out. She blew him a kiss before waving away the screen. He saw her get up and start towards the door as the screen faded away, to show his reflection on a sheet of bronze. His eyes looked hollow. He had dark circles.

Jules buried his face in his hands and just sat there for a while. The silence didn't feel so comforting anymore. It felt... oppressive. Like it was crushing him. Crushing something inside him.

Jules slowly turned to glance back at the now closed Bunker Door.

_""You're not coming back to the Cabin? Again?""_

Jules stopped.

Then he turned back to his desk, and opened the design again.

It started with heartbreak, yes — someone who never saw me the way I saw her.
But it became more than that.

I kept telling myself I just needed a better job.
A visa. A house.
But I think what I’ve been truly searching for…
was myself.
The version of me that never had a chance to breathe.

⸻

There’s this image I can’t let go of —
a small home, a quiet morning, a coffee by the window.
Not because it’s perfect, but because in that life,
I am finally safe. I belong. I am enough.

⸻

Most days I’m still here,
living in a room that doesn’t feel like mine,
in a life that feels borrowed.
I learn, I work, I apply, I hope —
and when nothing comes back, I try again.

But lately, it’s harder.
I carry a weight I don’t talk about.
I keep waiting for someone to ask how I’m doing,
but no one really does.
So here I am —
writing to strangers,
because it feels safer than silence.

⸻

I don’t know if I’ll ever get there —
wherever “there” is.
But I know this:

I’m not just trying to leave.
I’m trying to heal.
And healing… has no deadline.

If you’ve ever felt stuck between surviving and becoming…
I see you.
I’m walking that road too.

Right now the space feels pretty plain, just a beige couch and a small coffee table I got years ago. I want to make it more stylish but still cozy, something that feels modern but not too cold, and also functional because I do spend a lot of time in there. I’ve been browsing around for inspiration but it’s honestly a bit overwhelming with all the options out there.  
  
I came across Interior Icons ([https://interioricons.com/](https://interioricons.com/)) and really liked a lot of their stuff. Their furniture has this clean, minimal look that’s also kind of unique and not the typical mass-market designs you see everywhere. I’m seriously thinking of getting a sofa and accent chair from there, maybe even a coffee table to match. I like that their pieces stand out a bit but still feel like they’d blend in nicely if you mix and match with other styles. Has anyone here bought from them before?  
  
For the design itself, I’m not sure whether to go neutral tones (like greys, beiges, and whites) or add a bold color somewhere. Also not sure how much furniture to even include, I don’t want to overcrowd the space but I do want it to feel complete. Would love to hear how others approached redecorating their living rooms.

I am now post 24 hours 2 mg dose Reta taken at 1:30 pm 4/21/25 on fasted stomach. Drank water and took 2 electrolyte tabs morning of injection and remained to drink water throughout the day as well as a body armour electrolyte drink. 

Had a whey protein shake with kefir, blueberries and banana  around 2:00pm, noted maybe a mild headache but nothing significant. Was able to do all normal task of the day. At 4pm had small chicken breast with broccoli and around 7 pm noted gnawing pain (slight to moderate) in left upper quadrant that remitted with 2 Advil. No vomiting, nausea, or heart palpitations. No increased temp. Felt slight malaise and mild drowsiness to the point I  skipped nightly magnesium I was so drowsy. Around 9 had a baked bell paper stuffed with ground turkey and stewed tomato. Slept well but didn’t feel like I slept as I would wake and hours had passed so obviously I slept. Woke earlier than normal but was able to go back to sleep for a bit. 

Upon awakening felt okay, maybe somewhat foggy and displaced. Did normal morning routine with no problem. Stimulants (coffee, Ritalin) effect was dulled but nothing as bad as when on tirz which was debilitating. Took hydration tablets, drank water, started another electrolyte drink and had protein shake. The gnawing pain returned but it was in both left and right upper quadrant of abdomen. It resolved rapidly and fully sans intervention and never progressed to anything beyond mild. Was tired but productive, not sick at all. Bowels normal. The slight fatigue burned off a bit less than 24 hours post injection. Feel fine as of now. Lunch and dinner have produced no GI issue. No dull pain. Appetite moderately suppressed but nothing like Tirz which was severe to the point of being totally off food and water. This feels manageble. 

Edit to note-I took a digestive enzyme on empty stomach two hours after breakfast which may have deferred upper quadrant pain.

According to him they hung out, went to eat and that was it. He just completely forgot to tell me even though we were texting each other while he was with him.

Then a few days after us talking about our previous relationships he saves a video of him and his ex from Snapchat. They dated many years ago, broke up then started talking again, went on a couple dates but didn't click so they stopped talking. This was back in 2021 and since then he went out with a few others girls. Literally days after he told me more about their relationship he goes and saves a video of them. 

Confronted him and he explained that he just wanted a memory, just a video to remember that time of his life, that he had zero feelings for her and no want or desire to be with her. The video was short and dark (at a party or club) so her face was not even that visible. He swears it didn't mean anything and he just likes to have memories but after their breakup he deleted everything so he had to go back and save just one video. 

Not sure if the ""forgetting"" to tell me about his friend and this are related or not but it was such a change from his usual self. From what I know that girl doesn't live where he is so I don't know. 

I feel horrible, betrayed, I just can't believe him. Our relationship was good and going somehwere. As another men, do you believe him? Can it really mean nothing? Any advice or idea helps a lot.",0,1745365078.0,AskMenAdvice,13,0.5,False
1k5l08f,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarhawkIndustries/comments/1k4xjkh/starhawk_joins_coalition_of_independent/,[Relay Crosstalk 087 // Jemison Comms Loop // Press Kit Fatigue Detected],"“Ah yes, nothing says ‘cutting edge innovation’ like a ‘loosely affiliated, leaderless, initiative-themed vibe circle’ headquartered in the Core Worlds and organized by a manufacturer whose last big idea was *‘make it bigger, but with more grey.’*”

In an announcement that definitely wasn’t written by committee over lukewarm Terrabrew and a whiteboard labeled *‘Synergy Wins!’*, **Starhawk Industries** has joined a coalition of independent shipbuilders in an initiative so collaborative, so boundary-pushing, they forgot to name it. The SSNN broadcast calls it a *milestone.* Most of us call it *Tuesday.*

According to the **SSNN fluffdrop**, this “initiative” (note the total refusal to call it a coalition, organization, or literally anything with a spine) is about *sharing best practices,* *celebrating innovation,* and *increasing visibility.* Which, in corporate terms, translates to: “We’d like credit for what independent pilots have been duct-taping together for decades.”

Still, **Starhawk Industries**, famed for designing ships you can’t dock without a zoning permit, promises meaningful contributions like:

* The **Solstice Mk II**, which requires its own hangar crew to parallel park.
* The **Overlord**, a ship so heavy it warps local comms just by existing.
* And **whitepapers**, because when your reactor’s on fire, what you really need is *a footnote on adaptive retrofit methodologies.*

This isn’t an alliance. It’s an interstellar TED Talk where everyone brought slides and no one brought coffee.

Public reception? About what you'd expect:  
  
— **NeonNet Terminal Toast**  
*“No leadership, no name, no structure—congrats, they’ve created a shipbuilding commune. With lasers.”*  
  
— **The Well, Civic Housing Router Feed**  
*“Did they seriously list the Arcadia as a legacy platform? I’ve seen junkers with more legacy than that glorified bus.”*  
  
— **Cydonia Loading Dock – Crane Crew Commlink**  
*“You say Jade is apart of the Ship Commune? Ha. Jade ships smell like a fashion boutique and explode like a cautionary tale. Pretty, though.”*  
  
— **Red Mile Loading Pad, Crew Banter**  
*“Look, if your ship has a* ***mission statement****, it’s not for the frontier. It’s for tax deductions.”*

— **Blacksite Tether Post, Ecliptic Tap Intercept**  
*“ColTech and Baltic teaming up is like taping two buzzsaws together and expecting a screwdriver.”*

— **Freestar Patrol Blip, System V-92**  
*“Two of these shared-design ships tried to dock in the same bay. Apparently ‘collaborative architecture’ doesn’t include brakes.”*

— **Gagarin Landing Docks, Slip 14B**  
*“Nova Corps agreed to this mess? Guess even the sensible ones get bored. Or blackmailed. Or both.”*

— **Red Mile Betting Terminal Chat Dump**  
*“I heard Rose Shipyards joined up. Those engineers will strap a disruptor to a mining rig and call it ‘multi-role.’ I respect it. I also stay the hell away from it.”*

— **Leaked Nova Corps** **Internal Memo - CLASSIFIED**  
*“We’re in this to keep the peace. Not to babysit a staryard fan club with commitment issues and four different definitions of ‘standardized interface.’”*  
  
No central banner. No shared doctrine. Just six logos in a trenchcoat trying to pretend they’re not building their own factions in slow motion.

Someone let us know when they invent a new hull that doesn't need a five-minute sales pitch before it undocks.

“Thank you for checking in on your pre-order.

We have an important update regarding your Spinn S2 pre-order, and the broader global situation that may affect its final pricing and delivery timeline. As always, our priority is to keep you informed with full transparency, especially when external factors beyond our control come into play.

Over the past few weeks, the U.S. government has announced a new wave of tariff increases on internationally manufactured goods, including categories that directly impact the components and materials used in the Spinn S2. These policy changes are part of an evolving international trade landscape and have created a new layer of uncertainty for companies like ours that manufacture high-precision hardware abroad.

At this point, we want to be honest:
We’re still working through what these changes mean, both for our production costs and potentially for our pre-order customers. While we are doing everything we can to protect the current pricing and honor your original order, it’s possible that these tariffs could affect our cost structure in a way that may necessitate changes.

What we can promise is this:

We will exhaust every option to shield our earliest and most loyal customers from additional charges.

We’ll only make adjustments if absolutely necessary, and only after clear, direct communication.

You’ll always be informed first, and we’ll give you options.


We understand how frustrating this uncertainty can be. You've placed your trust in Spinn, and we don’t take that lightly. In parallel, we want to reassure you that our engineering and production teams continue working full-speed toward delivering the Spinn S2. The product is coming together beautifully, more refined, more powerful, and more intuitive than any Spinn before it.

While the situation isn’t ideal, we believe in transparency over Spinn.
We’re a startup, not a conglomerate and sometimes that means navigating global turbulence while staying true to the community that got us here.

We are just as eager as you are to share locked-in dates for delivery and we promise to share as soon as they are truly locked in. 

We truly appreciate your patience and trust in Spinn. As a startup focused on quality and customer satisfaction, we value your support immensely. If you have any questions or concerns our team is standing by to assist you.

Your coffee journey is about to get even better, very soon and we truly believe it will be worth that wait!

1k5kvy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bridezillas/comments/1k5kvy0/omfg_i_just_watched_a_bride_turn_a_dress_fitting/,"OMFG, I just watched a bride turn a dress fitting into a full-blown public breakdown.","
Note: All names have been changed because, well… I’m not trying to get sued.

Okay, I didn’t plan on spending my Tuesday morning watching a live reality show, but here we are. I tagged along with my best friend, “Maddie,” to her final dress fitting at this small, upscale bridal boutique downtown. It’s one of those Pinterest-perfect shops with soft music, delicate lighting, and lavender-scented everything. Total serenity.

Until it wasn’t.

So Maddie’s in the fitting room having her moment, looking amazing, and I’m sipping on my coffee just vibing when the front door swings open. In struts “Alyssa” (not her real name), the bride-to-be, and it was like a storm front rolled in. Full glam, perfect curls, 4-inch heels, latte in hand, and a whole entourage behind her, her mom, two bridesmaids, and what looked like her future sister-in-law trailing behind her like backup dancers.

The vibe changed immediately. The boutique staff all stood up a little straighter, you could tell they remembered her. One of the seamstresses greeted her with a smile and said they were ready to begin her final fitting. Alyssa didn’t even say hi, just muttered something about being “on a tight schedule.”

She disappears into the fitting room and we all try to pretend nothing’s happening, but within five minutes, you could hear her voice rising. At first, it was little things: “Is this the same hemline?” and “I don’t remember the neckline being this high.” Then she steps out.

And let me be clear: the dress looked incredible. Like, model-in-a-magazine incredible. Everyone’s jaw dropped including her bridesmaids. One of them goes, “Oh my God, Alyssa, it’s perfect!” and I swear, instead of smiling or saying thanks, Alyssa turns to the mirror, blinks a few times, and says coldly:

“This isn’t my dress.”

Everyone went silent. The seamstress looked confused and said, “Yes, this is the same dress we altered last month. The custom bodice, the lace you selected remember the French appliqué?” Alyssa shakes her head like she’s being gaslit.

“No. This isn’t what I ordered. The lace looks different. And the skirt feels… off. Are you seriously telling me this is the same dress I picked out? Because it looks cheaper.”

You could feel the air leave the room. The seamstress, bless her, stayed calm. She pulled out photos from Alyssa’s last appointment and showed her they were identical. “We’ve followed your notes exactly,” she said. “But we’re happy to make further tweaks if needed.”

Wrong answer.

Alyssa’s face twisted. “No, no, you’re not going to manipulate me into thinking I’m the problem. I’ve worked in fashion PR I know when someone’s trying to cover up a mistake. You switched something. Admit it.”

Then the rant began. She accused them of trying to save money by altering a different gown. She claimed they were taking advantage of her because she “looked too nice” to stand up for herself. (Trust me, no one was mistaking her for a pushover.)

Her mom tried to calm her down. “Sweetheart, the dress looks beautiful. Maybe you’re just overwhelmed?” To which Alyssa literally snapped, “Do not tell me I’m overwhelmed, Mom. This is why I didn’t want you coming in the first place.”

One of the bridesmaids, “Jess,” chimed in quietly: “You loved this dress last time…” and Alyssa whirled around and hissed, “Don’t start with me, Jess. Not today.”

The energy shifted from awkward to toxic.

And now she was crying. Loud, dramatic sobs while standing in the mirror. “I just wanted to feel like a bride,” she wailed, “and now I don’t even recognize myself. I feel like a fraud.”

At this point, the store manager appeared and gently offered to make last-minute adjustments or issue a refund if Alyssa truly wasn’t happy. And y’all… Alyssa looked her dead in the eye and said:

“I don’t want a refund. I want an apology for ruining the most important moment of my life.”

I wish I was joking.

As if on cue, Jess stood up, grabbed her purse, and said, “I’m going to get the car,” which I think was code for “I’m out of this nightmare.” The others followed, one by one, leaving Alyssa crying in the mirror, accusing the staff of sabotaging her wedding day.

The staff stayed so professional, it was honestly impressive. I would’ve walked out hours ago. But they just nodded and calmly said they’d reach out later to follow up.

Maddie and I paid and left shortly after. As we walked out, I swear I heard Alyssa say, “Maybe I’ll just cancel the whole thing.”

TL;DR: Bride walks into her final dress fitting on a Tuesday morning, decides the stunning dress she picked is suddenly “cheap” and “wrong,” accuses staff of switching it, emotionally attacks her entourage, sobs dramatically in the mirror, and demands an apology for ruining her wedding. Bridesmaid peaced out halfway through. The energy? Absolute chaos.

1k5ksut,https://www.reddit.com/r/FattyLiverNAFLD/comments/1k5ksut/sharing_my_nafld_story_for_those_with_anxiety/,Sharing my NAFLD story for those with anxiety,"I’ve always had major health paranoia and am usually convinced I’m dying of ten different diseases at any one time. I used to be able to look at my bloodwork results but had gotten way too out of control mentally to do that, so I’d just wait to see doctor’s comments. 

Had bloodwork in August 2022. Didn’t look at the results. Doctor commented that my cholesterol was high (250) and to let her know if I wanted to take cholesterol meds. That was it. A few months later, I built the courage to view the bloodwork results and about shit myself with horror - my ALT (which had only ever been a point or two high out of range) was  111 and my AST was 68.

MENTAL SPIRAL - ON THE WAY UP THE ELEVATOR TO MEET JESUS - GOODBYE CRUEL WORLD

I lose my mind. Immediately message the doctor and ask about the numbers and she nonchalantly says she can send me for an ultrasound. Literally in tears on the ultrasound table telling the tech I’m gonna die of fatty liver to which she replies “Meh, everyone has fatty liver these days, it’s not a big deal!”

Results: “Echogenic liver may suggest fatty infiltration. Liver is hyperechoic.”
Overnight, I completely changed my diet and watched every YouTube video I could by experts in the field of internal medicine. I started eating a spinach salad every night with dinner, cut out my UberEats addiction, stopped binging desserts, drank black coffee, etc. Within two months, I was down 35lbs. I had a run in with a very negative and insulting GI doctor and said fuck it, I’m not going back to doctors and I’ll just lose more weight and hopefully I’ll be ok.

What followed for the next TWO YEARS was me being legitimately convinced I was dying of liver disease. Refused to take medication for anything because I have liver disease and it can’t process anything. Any abdominal pain, my liver is clearly and actively rotting away. Wouldn’t have dreamed of having a sip of alcohol. Literally spent two years thinking about, stressing about, and being consumed with paranoia about my liver every single day. Not exaggerating.

I found a new doctor who was gentle with my health obsessions and convinced me to at least do bloodwork to keep on file. She promised she wouldn’t tell me the results. Well - I looked. ALT was 28 and my AST was 20. My cholesterol went from 250 to 115. I was SHOCKED. Thought I was reading some sample template or and advertisement. Maybe my blood was mixed up with someone else’s. No, I just did the work and it paid off. I’m not dying of liver disease. I have an ultrasound this week to see how that’s looking, and I’m confident it will have improved. Livers are cool as hell. They want to be healthy. They can, and will, repair themselves.

Please know that if you have enzymes out of range by 20 or 30 or 50 points - those are baby liver numbers. People with cirrhosis and active liver disease have liver numbers in the thousands. If your doctor is acting nonchalant, it’s likely because NAFLD is rampant, especially due to the standard American diet. Slightly elevated numbers don’t phase doctors anymore. 

And, most importantly, if you’re like I was and are truly suffering from health paranoia, please tackle that with a psychiatrist. I now take SSRI’s and look forward to my bloodwork and doctor visits. I’m no longer afraid of my health and am not stuck in a mental rabbit hole of convincing myself I’m a sick person. Anxiety can and will wreak havoc on your health way quicker than fatty liver will. There’s a path to a clear mind, just ask for help. Amazing how much relief you feel once you see things realistically and not from a haze of depression and health anxiety.

TLDR - You’re not as bad off as you think. Health anxiety sucks but meds can clear your mind and pull you out of the NAFLD mental spiral you’re in. Livers are cool, so be nice to yours and it’ll be nice to you.",12,1745364474.0,FattyLiverNAFLD,1,0.94,False

The slide, reported at 8:33am on Tuesday 4/22/25 was reported to have boulders stacked up to 30 feet high and blocking both lanes of travel on the historic Highway 11. As luck would have it, as we were researching this event we received a call and had an impromptu interview with local WSDOT Supervisor Tad Dawson who was on-scene earlier that day:

*BhamRedditNews:* Thanks for the call Tad. What can you tell us about this historic slide?

*Dawson*: Of course, we are always happy to work with the public regarding these slides, we couldn't do it without the public's help - to be honest with you if not for the reports I don't think we ever would have spotted this slide. That being said this one was very interesting... in your average slide typically we look for signs of things like high-grade slopes, loose material, and lack of vegetation. Strangely enough we're just not really seeing those typical markers here so we've brought in one of our specialist teams to look at other potential causes.

*BhamRedditNews*: Can we ask what nature of specialist? Is this cause for concern?

*Dawson*: Well it's probably a bit too early to say exactly but we have brought in one of our K-9 units just to err on the side of caution. K-9 ""Pectin"" is specially trained to identify potentially unsafe roadside debris such as polyester fiberfill and polystyrene.

*BhamRedditNews*: ""Pectin"" is a great name, how did that come about? And apologies here but we just need to clarify - when you say polyester as in ""Poly-fill"" you mean like the stuffing inside of children's stuffed animals?

[Pictured: Supervisor Dawson and working K-9 \\""Pectin\\""](https://preview.redd.it/hgxmp7cqygwe1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=c74360195e95d225dc7cee2db3e9e38d4601c96b)

*Dawson:* Exactly it. Now imagine just a few cubic feet of that and the damage it can cause. So that's what I was hired for. I worked with our California counterparts to develop the Roadside Hazard K-9 program in Washington State. Most of our other regional K-9 teams utilize extremely expensive purpose-bred Malinois from Hungary but Pectin was actually a local Washington working orchard dog in his past life. After one too many sneezing fits the farmer had enough and Pectin found his way to our program. Once the vets identified the main allergen the name kind of stuck. Pectin's penchant for shredding things also makes him the perfect fit for on-scene material destruction.

*BhamRedditNews*: This work must lead to some high-profile stories?

*Dawson: (He chuckles at this)* It sure can! Seeing Pectin or any one of our other working dogs hanging off of one of our bucket trucks in a harness pointing for things like poly-fill in the trees - well it can look a little intense but given the proper precautions we are proud of our sterling safety record. The success of this program has even allowed us to procure a specially-outfitted EC130 Eurocopter with advanced imaging to increase our weather envelopes.

*BhamRedditNews*: \*spits out coffee\* Excuse me did you say helicopter?!

*Dawson*: Yes that procurement is going well however we are having delays with some of the dogs scenting abilities when dangling in the rotorwash but we are confident we can work through these challenges.

\*\* At this point Tad indicated he had another urgent event that he needed to respond to but sent over some images later from his $12,000 state-issued Toughbook. Thanks for all that you do Tad!

Did she use me?,"There’s a girl in my dental faculty, a year below me. We have a shared workspace where students go to practice. One afternoon I saw her there looking a bit overwhelmed, so I offered help. We exchanged a few light words, and as she was leaving, I told her, “Everything will be okay.” She laughed — it felt like a warm moment.

A few days later, I helped her best friend with her work. That interaction also felt good — we even chatted about life and some personal things.

Then I saw the first girl again. I offered help, and she smiled and said I was known for helping people — that it was kind. I said I’m happy to help whoever I can. She ended up not needing my help that time.

Later that week, we ended up sitting next to each other again while practicing. I had a warm conversation with her. I told her the exams can be tough, and I offered her some flashcards I made that helped me a lot last year. I also asked if she wanted to be my patient for one of the clinic requirements. Honestly, I didn’t really need her as a patient — I just wanted a reason to ask for her number, but I didn’t have the guts to ask her out directly. She agreed and asked for my number. She also said she’d share my patient flyer.

A few days later (right before break), she messaged me asking for the flashcards and the flyer. I sent the flashcards and added, “I can show you how to use them over coffee,” as a way of making it a little more personal. She just replied, “Yay, thanks,” and later added, “Send me your flyer BTW, I’ll share it with friends.” I sent it and said thanks. That was the last message. It’s been over a week now — we had a break — but I haven’t heard from her or seen her since.

I don’t know if that was her way of gently rejecting me. Or if she never saw it as anything more to begin with. I can’t stop thinking about it. I really liked her. I keep asking myself — did she just use me for the flashcards?",0,1745364282.0,dating_advice,12,0.5,False

Los Angeles, a city of secrets. The Santa Monica Pier creaks under the weight of its shadows.

Sidney Johnson was a colossus, his once-chiseled face buried under gluttony, a bag of shelled peanuts always in his pocket to steady his temper. He’d clawed a shipping empire from a small firm, funded by an uncle’s inheritance, but ambition choked out affection. In his youth, he wed Elaine—a blue-eyed knockout pregnant with his child—to dodge scandal. Fatherhood was a cage he despised. Elaine, vain as a peacock, treated their daughter, Marla, like a plaything, doting when it suited her, ignoring her otherwise. To Johnson, Marla was a ledger line, a costly error paid in cold cash.

Peter Duarte, Johnson’s shadow, was a wiry 5’10” with bulging eyes and a Hungarian accent that curled like cigarette smoke. They’d met on a ship years back, where Duarte’s knife settled a gambler’s debt with chilling precision. When Johnson bought the firm, he made Duarte his fixer—running crews, burying problems, guarding secrets. Loyal as a dog, Duarte never questioned orders, his sinister edge a perfect blade for Johnson’s ruthless hand.

Marla grew wild, her beauty a middle finger to her father’s neglect. Johnson packed her off to fancy schools to keep her out of sight, greasing palms to cover her failures. Each bribe stoked his fury, driving him deeper into opium, supplied by Duarte. He swelled into a caricature, peanuts crunching as he seethed.

Elaine, meanwhile, chased trysts with Mexican laborers at their estate, discreet enough to skirt Johnson’s wrath. Marla, sharp with her father’s cunning and venom, unraveled at UCLA. By her final year, she was snorting coke, turning tricks for cash despite her family’s millions, and running with Louis Morello, a mafia pimp, and his gorilla of a brother, Ralph.

One Monday night, she vanished from her off-campus apartment, gone like a ghost.

Part 2

Tom Hart’s office reeked of stale coffee and regret. The PI, stocky from his boxing days, nursed a whiskey when Peter Duarte slunk in, eyes glinting like a cornered rat’s. He slid an envelope across the desk—$1000 in crisp bills. “Find Marla,” Duarte said, Hungarian vowels sharp as a switchblade. Tom counted the cash, squinting. “Give me something.”

Duarte’s cheekbones caught the lamplight. “Marla’s the daughter of my boss, Sidney Johnson. UCLA student. Troubled. Her father pays her bills, keeps his distance. Her mother loves her but… she’s got her own distractions.” He paused, words measured. “It’s messy.”

Tom caught the slip. “You said her mother loves her. Not her father.” Duarte’s eyes flickered, but he shrugged. “I’ve got to go, Hart. Call me with progress.” He left a number and Marla’s apartment address, insisting Johnson stay out of it. Tom shook his clammy hand, already smelling a rat. Duarte was hiding something, and Johnson’s absence roared louder than a .38.

Tom hit the pavement, starting at UCLA. Professors called Marla brilliant but unhinged, classmates a loner with a razor tongue. Whispers told a darker tale: by night, she turned tricks for $200 a pop, tied to Louis Morello and his brother Ralph, who ran a Wilshire Boulevard storefront. Their “supermarket delivery” fronted for numbers, dope, loans, and girls. Tom headed there, license ready.

The office stank of cigars and bad decisions. Louis, dark-eyed and slick, lounged in his chair, all charm and menace. Ralph, a slab of muscle with a face like a tombstone, loomed behind. A bookshelf held sports books, family photos, and a framed picture of Marla, her smile a knife in the gut. “Tom Hart, PI,” Tom said, flashing his badge. “Looking for Marla Johnson.”

Louis smirked. “Wasting your time, Hart. We know nothing.” Tom nodded at Marla’s photo. “Heard you two were tight. Heard you pimped her.” Louis’s face went ice-cold, Ralph’s fists twitched, but Tom held Louis’s gaze. “You come in here slinging mud?” Louis snapped. “Where’s she at?”

“Where’s she?” Tom fired back. “Last time you saw her?” Louis’s voice broke, raw. “A month back. Been searching everywhere. Nobody’s seen her.” His eyes glistened—grief, twisted but real. Tom slid his card over. “We both want her found. Call if you hear anything.” Louis nodded, staring at the floor. Tom left, Marla’s photo burning in his mind.

⸻

Part 3

Back at his office, Tom slumped behind his desk. Beth, his matronly secretary, handed him a note: Duarte called, sounding like a man on the edge. Before Tom could dial, the phone rang.

“She’s dead,” Duarte barked, voice like a snapped wire. “Washed up on Santa Monica Beach. Shot, tossed in the ocean.” Tom’s stomach lurched. “How’s Johnson holding up?” Duarte ignored him. “Make calls. Get back to me.” Click.

Tom rang Steve Foley, a detective from his LAPD days. “Marla Johnson case,” Tom said. “What’s the word?” Steve’s voice was grim. “Washed ashore last night. ID’d her this morning via dental records. In the water weeks, shot in the head. I’m at the morgue—meet me.” Tom drove over, finding Steve outside, cigarette glowing. Inside, Marla’s body was bones and decay, the ocean’s cruel art. “Bullet killed her before she hit the water,” Steve said. “Cleans evidence nice.”

Tom laid it out: Duarte’s cash, Marla’s double life, the Morellos’ denial. He kept Louis’s grief quiet, unsure why. “I’m hitting the Morellos tomorrow, 9 a.m.,” Steve said. “Two uniforms for Ralph’s knuckles. You in?” Tom nodded. “Count me.”

They staked out the Morellos’ office from a car across Wilshire. At 11 a.m., the brothers rolled up, clueless that Marla’s body had surfaced—Steve kept it hushed. After fifteen minutes, they barged in: Steve, Tom, two cops. Louis leapt up. “What the hell’s this?” Steve didn’t blink. “Marla’s dead. Washed up with a .38 slug in her skull.” Louis sank into his chair, muttering “No, no,” tears welling. Steve scoffed. “Save the act, Morello. We know you pimped her, know you both snorted coke. You sold her for $200 a trick—don’t play the mourner.”

Louis’s face twisted, rage overtaking grief. “I loved her,” he growled. “Get me my lawyer.” Steve flashed a warrant. “Sit tight.” The cops tore through the office. Behind Marla’s photo, one found a .38 revolver. Steve lifted it with a pencil, grinning. “Well, now.” Louis erupted. “You framed me, Hart!” he roared as cuffs snapped on. “You planted it!” Tom stayed quiet, staring at the shelf. He’d clocked that photo yesterday—no gun. His mind screamed: Duarte.

⸻

Part 4

Tom stormed back to his office, fury boiling. Beth was gone, the room a cave of shadows. Steve called, voice electric.

“Found an earring on the pier, stuck between planks. Marla’s—her mother confirmed it. Bullet casing too, under rocks. Waiting on ballistics, but I’d bet my badge it matches the Morellos’ .38. Case closed.” Tom wasn’t sold. Too tidy, too quick. Duarte’s fingerprints were all over this.

He lit a cigarette, piecing it together. Johnson loathed Marla, saw her as a threat to his empire. Her coke habit, mobster boyfriend, and hooking were a scandal he couldn’t stomach—especially in his opium haze, peanuts crunching as he raved. He’d turned to Duarte, his loyal hound. “End it,” Johnson must’ve said. Duarte, ever the fixer, didn’t blink. Tom pictured it: Duarte luring Marla to the pier with a cash drop, the same as he’d done for years to keep her quiet. This time, he brought a .38. One shot, one push into the tide. The ocean would scrub her clean, leaving only bones and a bullet.

Tom needed proof, something to crack Duarte’s icy facade. The pier was the key—someone had to have seen something. He’d heard whispers at the precinct: kids fished there at night, dodging cops for extra cash. A long shot, but he was out of cards. He grabbed his coat and hit the Santa Monica Pier at 8 p.m., the fog rolling in like a bad omen. The boards creaked under his weight, the ocean’s murmur swallowing his thoughts. He sat on a bench, eyes scanning the shadows, praying for a break.

An hour passed—nothing. The fog thickened, blurring the Ferris wheel’s glow. Then he spotted a kid, maybe 14, Mexican, crouched under the pier with a crab trap, his hands quick and sure. Tom approached, steps soft.

“Late for crabbing, kid. School tomorrow?”

The boy looked up, wary, his face half-lit by a dangling bulb. “Crabs come out at night, mister. Helps my ma with the rent.” His voice was steady, but his eyes flicked to the shadows.

“You here often?” Tom asked, crouching to his level. “Say, a month back?” The kid’s hands froze on the trap, his breath catching. Tom leaned closer, voice low. “Son, a woman died here. Blonde, pretty. I think you saw something. A good kid like you—you don’t want that weight on your soul.”

The boy’s eyes darted, scared but stubborn. “Didn’t see nothing. I just crab.” Tom pulled a twenty from his pocket, sliding it across the sand. “I’m not a cop, kid. Just a guy trying to save an innocent man. What’s your name?”

“Juan,” he muttered, pocketing the cash. He hesitated, then spoke, voice barely a whisper. “I was here… a month ago, maybe. Heard a shot, saw a guy—tall, creepy eyes. He pushed something into the water. I hid behind the rocks, didn’t move till he was gone.”

Tom’s pulse quickened. “What’d he look like? Anything else?” Juan shrugged, nervous. “Dark coat, funny voice—not like my uncle’s. Kinda… foreign. That’s all I got.” It wasn’t perfect, but it was enough. Duarte’s bulging eyes, his Hungarian lilt—Juan’s words fit like a glove. Tom’s mind raced: a scared kid’s story could spook Duarte, especially if Tom sold it right. He flashed his badge, keeping his voice calm. “You’re brave, Juan. Stay quiet for now. I’ll handle it.”

He hit a payphone, calling Steve. “Get to the pier. Got a witness.” Steve arrived in twenty, skeptical but listening. Juan retold his story, less certain now, his hands shaking. “Tall guy, weird eyes, funny talk. Shot her, I think.” Steve’s jaw tightened. “Matches Duarte. We’ll bring him in.” Tom nodded, but his gut churned. Juan’s story was gold, but shaky—too shaky for court. He’d have to play dirty to make it stick.

⸻

Part 5 (Final Confrontation)

The next morning, Tom and Steve rolled up to Johnson’s mansion, two uniformed cops in tow. A maid answered, fetching Duarte. He slunk in, eyes darting like a trapped weasel.

“What’s this about?” Steve flashed his badge. “You and Johnson. Together. Now.”

Duarte bristled. “Necessary? Johnson’s busy. You’ve got the Morellos locked up.”

Tom stepped forward, voice low. “That’s what you’d like us to think.”

Duarte led them to Johnson’s office, a den of mahogany and cigar haze. Johnson rose, a sweating titan, peanuts spilling from his pocket. “Gentlemen, my thanks for nabbing my daughter’s killers.”

Tom’s blood boiled—evil cloaked in charm. He leaned in, cool as a cardsharp. “One question, boys. Why hire me to find Marla when you knew she was dead?”

Johnson’s jowls shook. “Preposterous, Hart! I thought her missing, not dead. How dare you insinuate otherwise?”

Tom didn’t budge. “It was a smokescreen. You played concerned father to cover your tracks. You had her killed. And you,” he turned to Duarte, “you did the deed.”

Duarte’s eyes narrowed, silent, as if betting Tom was grasping. Johnson sputtered, but Tom pulled a tape recorder from his satchel and slammed it on the desk. He hit play. Juan’s voice, quavering, filled the room: “I saw him… shot her in the back of the head, pushed her into the ocean.” Duarte froze—his mind racing. Johnson’s wealth and fancy lawyers would tear a kid’s story apart. Duarte almost smirked.

Then Johnson bellowed, pointing at Duarte. “Seize that wretch! He killed my daughter! He’s a crook—burglary in Budapest as a youth. He planted that gun in Morello’s office!”

Duarte lunged, cuffs snapping on his wrists. “You traitor!” he hissed, pure venom. “After all I’ve done, you stab me? Fine—his books in the cabinet? Phony. The real ones hide in a safe behind that Manet. He’s been robbing the government blind. He thought Marla’d sink him, so he paid me to kill her. Paranoid, opium-soaked fool!”

“Enough!” Steve roared. “Tell it to the jury.” He nodded to the cops. “Cuff ‘em. Murder one.”

Johnson and Duarte, still snarling, were hauled out. Tom packed up the recorder with a heavy heart. Steve clapped his shoulder. “You got ‘em, Hart. Knew they’d turn like alley rats.”

Tom sighed. “Rat bastards. Poor Marla—beautiful, doomed from the start.”

Steve added with a wry smile, “I owe you. When you called me from the pier at 2 a.m., raving about an eyewitness, I thought this case drove you nuts. When I got there and heard your half-baked plan to have the landscaper’s kid record a fake account of Duarte killing Marla, I nearly threw you in the water. But it worked—worked like a charm. Breakfast at my place? Maggie’s got the griddle hot.”

Tom cracked a grin. “Can’t say no. I’m starved.” They walked out as the mansion’s gloom swallowed Marla’s ghost.",1,1745364246.0,u_glac1018,0,1.0,False

***Tuesday***

Skylar didn’t go home after she left the apartment.

Instead, she went to the Prydelands. Specifically, the Eechee’s personal wing of the compound. She appeared in the receiving room, bypassing the elaborate bench seat facing all sides that had endured decades of children treating it like a padded play-mountain and walked over to the elegant, golden-framed mirror on the left side of the room. Like many of the common areas, the room was always well-lit in case someone happened to be passing through.

Skylar rested her hand on the mantle under the mirror and stared at her reflection. She could certainly fix the weariness and make herself entirely more presentable to her kin (especially if she took into consideration how long it had been since she’d stood inside the Prydelands). Still, for the life of her, she couldn’t be bothered.

No, it had been a day, and she could use a fellow healer’s insight. Just … not the Eechee’s. Apart from the lateness of the hour, seeking her out for something that the pryde would consider trivial was tantamount to reaching for a nuclear option when one couldn’t find a fly swatter.

It only took a few seconds for her to be joined by another pryde female. The only *other* female to have been unofficially exiled from the pryde during her infancy, then semi-welcomed and finally welcomed fully back into the fold as the centuries rolled by. Skylar felt she was at stage two of that three-step process, but it was still weird to be back after so long.

“You are taking a great risk being here,” Bianca said, coming up to stand behind her so that both were visible in the mirror.

“Perhaps not as much as some would believe,” Skylar replied, turning to face (whom the humans would call) her sister-in-law. She pulled the collar of her shirt away to reveal the two-tone mating torc, which in her human form was embedded into her skin like a twisted rope tattoo. In pryde terms, most mated pairs only had a single gold rope to represent their mating. Two was the mark of a commander (and Ashanti—the Eechen’s mate), with only the Eechee and Eechen bearing the triple twist of ultimate leadership.

Bianca’s eyes widened, and her hands clasped in front of her mouth, her delight overwhelming. “You…*you* are the one who brought Aonghus back to us.” She looked at the ceiling. “I knew you were circling a mate, you jerk.”

Skylar knew she hadn’t sent that telepathically on the off-chance the Eechen overheard it, and her smile became a chuckle of warmth at the sibling banter. “Do you have a minute or ten for your newest sister-in-law? I could really use your insight.”

“Is my clutch-mate already getting on your last nerve?”

Skylar released her collar and sighed heartily. “Actually, that’s the only front that makes any sense right now… Except for the part where he’s trying to commandeer my clinic and turn it into an external training ground for the true gryps healers.”

Bianca blinked. Then blinked again. “I think I must have misheard you.”

“Oh, you didn’t. But even that’s not why I’m here.”

Bianca looked her over critically, and Skylar sighed again, enduring the female medical commander’s spot appraisal. “Come with me,” her sister-in-law said, and with her hand on Skylar’s shoulder, they realm-stepped away.

\* \* \*

Half an hour later, Bianca filled Skylar’s glass with more ambrosia. They were lounging on a plump sofa in an office somewhere in Boston. That much Skylar knew without going outside for true bearings.

The space was classically styled, if not a little dated, with many personal pieces going back over a hundred years. The bronze figurines of fantasy creatures as they existed in the humans’ minds, and a letter-sized photo of the Eechee and Bianca standing amongst a group of distinguished gentlemen, all in white coats, just to name a few. Everything about the men and the age of the photo puts it in the mid-eighteen hundreds.

“Wow,” Bianca said at the end of Skylar’s tale. “That brother of mine really has mellowed. No way would he have allowed any of his warriors to accept a non-lover for a *Plus-One.* Not even when Coraltin was alive.”

“With good reason,” Skylar said, taking another tentative sip once Bianca finished pouring. It had been decades since she’d had ambrosia, and she knew not to overindulge. It wasn’t that she was deliberately speaking ill of the dead, just that both Coraltin and Angus had a warrior’s mentality that, like so many others, had little to no room for empathy. “But that’s a problem for another day. Especially when today has enough of its own to pick from.”

Bianca took a deep swig and licked her lips. “I think I can help with at least one of your problems. Stay here. I’ll be right back.”

After Bianca realm-stepped away, Skylar stood up and looked closer at the knick-knacks that lined the bookshelves behind the desk. As Bianca was technically a medical commander in her own right, leaving now that she’d been ordered to stay wasn’t an option.

Bianca returned a few minutes later, having changed out of her nightgown and into dark blue jeans, a crisply ironed, button-down lilac blouse and brand-new light blue and black running sneakers. It immediately made Skylar look down at her own attire, finding it exceedingly lacking. 

“You have time to change,” Bianca said, sensing her discomfort. “We’re going to visit an old friend, and he always needs enough time to get his head out of his cranky ass for waking him up so late at night.”

Skylar thought about her options. Specifically, the location of all her clothes. Angus was already aware that she’d left her Bhutan facility to aid Mason and was probably either in his property in Denmark or more likely the one in Tuxedo Park. Sure as hell, he’d be at whichever one she chose to turn up at, and then he’d find out that she’d sought an audience with his clutch-mate. That little nugget of information was something she hoped to keep to herself until after this situation with Mason was sorted.

“Who are we going to see?”

“One of my old students. A human.”

Human meant a glamour could be applied, and without missing a beat, Skylar applied a similar appearance to Bianca, with a light blue button-up, black jeans and black sneakers. Unlike the basic single ponytail that she had her hair in, the glamour created a stylish chignon bun that gave her a professional air.

Bianca’s approving smile had Skylar smirking as well. “Let’s go and annoy my former star pupil.”

A realm-step later had both women standing on a pillared landing four steps above an immaculately mowed front lawn. The white tiles of the patio were in direct contrast to the darker brick of the home, and the black framed and smoky glass inserted double front doors, and the timber-clad columns were a perfect contrast to both. This time, Skylar knew they were in New York City because she recognised the house as one she’d been to many times before.

Bianca raised her hand and knocked.

There was a grumpy grumble on the other side of the door before locks were disengaged and the door swung open to reveal a hastily put-together Oliver Kearns. His eyes widened in surprise as he took in both of his visitors. “Oliver,” Bianca said with a smile. “As I said on the phone, I’m sorry to bother you so late, but this couldn’t wait.”

“Hey, Oliver,” Skylar added with a friendly wave.

“I-I had no idea you two even knew each other, Dr Griffin…”

“Bianca, Oliver. You left my classroom behind decades ago.”

Oliver stepped back, waving regally for him to enter his home. “I could put some coffee on, but other than that, I only have basic drinks. Apple juice … water … whiskey.”

Skylar chuckled. “We’re good, thanks,” she said, ignoring the eight steps to the upper level, choosing instead to head down the four steps and turning left at the bottom into Oliver’s home office. Straight ahead was the downstairs living room that Oliver had used for parties in the nineties. He wasn’t as keen on them these days as he had been back then.

As she expected, the room choice put Oliver on notice that this wasn’t a friendly visit, and he walked stiffly around his desk to sit, gesturing to the two vacant chairs in front of his desk. “Please, have a seat, ladies, and tell me how I can help you.”

Skylar and Bianca made themselves comfortable. Bianca spoke first. “To assuage your personal curiosity, Skylar here recently married my quin brother, so that’s how we know each other.”

Oliver’s gaze slid to Skylar, specifically, her ring-free left hand. “You’re married now?”

Skylar nodded. “Has Mason ever spoken of someone called Angus?” she asked in return, ignoring the obvious explanation of why she couldn’t wear jewellery as a working vet.

Oliver’s jaw fell open. “Noooo,” he drawled, his gaze flying back to Bianca. “Mason’s chauffeur is your twin brother?”

Thankfully, his outburst didn’t break patient/client privilege. Identifying someone’s chauffeur by name was hardly a medical revelation.

“I knew Skylar before that, but this has brought us much closer. Oh, and it’s not twin. It’s *quin.* There are five of us.” Bianca held up her hand with her fingers spread wide for a moment before dropping them again.

Oliver looked at his desk, taking a moment to collect his thoughts. “Alright,” he said, lifting his gaze once more. “The marriage and quintuplet surprises aside, I assume there’s a reason you’re here. Am I also correct in assuming you’re not about to ask me to break patient confidentiality?” He arched an eyebrow in warning.

Skylar looked at Bianca, who smiled beatifically. “Of course. Skylar and I were merely discussing how eventful her day has been today, and after hearing what she had to say, I thought it would be prudent for you to be brought into the loop, purely from a spectator’s position. Neither of us needs or wants you to say a word, and you are completely free to let Mason know tomorrow that you overheard this discussion if you think it’s in his best interest.”

Oliver pinched his lips as if he’d tasted something sour. “Can’t say I’m a fan of this loophole,” he said, shaking his head.

“Mason has been dealt a serious blow to his recovery this afternoon, and he had an adverse reaction to it tonight. I was forced to sedate him,” Skylar said.

Oliver stiffened and covered his mouth with one hand. “Is there any official record of this setback?” he asked, rubbing his fingertips over his lips as if he could hide the words behind the digits. “Anything I can use to explain how I came by this knowledge?”

“Only that it’s a Nascerdios thing,” Bianca said. “And that’s why we’re here. It’s the only way you could be forewarned of what happened before Mason’s session later this morning. He’s going to be jumpier than ever before, and I didn’t want you trying to guess why. As you already know, he won’t open up easily, but then, there’s a reason you were at the top of my class. What you do with that information will be entirely up to you, but at least you’ll have it.”

Heaving a heavy, resigned sigh, Oliver sat back in his chair and raised his hands as if he were conducting them to begin singing.

Because, in a way, he was.

Not even 10 minutes later, my heart started racing to around 150bpm. It stayed like this for 12 hours, and after this I had difficulty breathing.

Fast forward months later, I'm still experiencing:

* Constant yawning (can't get enough air even when yawning)
* Persistent difficulty breathing that only stops when I sleep and reappears randomly after waking up
* Severe and CONSTANT dry mouth on awakening that has not gone away for a single day since the incident
* Occasional dizziness and light-headedness (feels like I'm going to faint)
* Initially had lack of appetite that resolved after a few weeks
* One random episode of feeling really cold

I had a 2-week period where symptoms disappeared completely, which occurred about 3 weeks after they began. Then I suddenly started getting a bad coughing fit 2 hours after waking up, and all symptoms returned.

My digestive system has also been affected, I've had alternating constipation and diarrhea, and recently noticed black specks (possibly seeds) in my stool.

I've been told this is probably anxiety, but I find it hard to believe since it's constant, every single day, and never happened before the alcohol incident. The only similar experience I've had is sometimes getting shortness of breath for a few hours after drinking coffee. My stress tolerance has drastically decreased, if I get even slightly scared, I feel like I'm going to faint.

Tests completed (all normal):

* Echocardiogram
* ECG
* Blood analysis
* Evaluation by a cardiologist who said symptoms are ""subjective""

Interestingly, two things have helped somewhat:

1. Probiotics seemed to improve my symptoms
2. A herbal supplement containing passion flower, valerian, lemon balm, California poppy, and melatonin also reduced symptoms

I've been looking into acetaldehyde sensitivity and the connection between alcohol, mucosal barrier damage, and chronic symptoms. Could this be a case where the alcohol triggered acetaldehyde buildup that damaged my mucosal barriers, leading to systemic effects including breathing issues and dry mouth?

I tried to start exercising to deal with the symptoms but could barely manage 2 minutes of HIIT on the first day. I also wake up with dry mouth every single morning.

Has anyone experienced anything similar or have any insights into this connection between alcohol, acetaldehyde, and persistent symptoms? What specialists should I see beyond cardiology?

  
Also, I had something similar years ago, and then I got diagnosed with anemia. I remember drinking coffee that time though. Could this be anemia?",2,1745364206.0,Anemic,1,1.0,False

Caffeine doesn’t create energy.  
  


It just blocks adenosine, the chemical that makes you feel tired.

You feel more alert, but the fatigue doesn’t disappear it just gets delayed.

I've begun rearranging furniture and things to take full advantage of my sunroom. I moved all of my workout equipment downstairs, and ordered some new furniture. Tell me why have I bought 5 different small tables? 😅 I'm ridiculous, I really only needed 1 or two … but I *wanted* the others, lol. I'll definitely find use for all of them, that's not a concern. I even got a new altar table, and I can't wait for it to be delivered! It's going in the sun room along with all of my other things that facilitate meditation and spiritual work. 

I also moved my camphor chest from the bedroom to the sunroom; it can actually be seen that way, and I need the extra storage there more now. I got this super cute rug for the sunroom too, now all I really need is a chair to put there - but I want a nice, soft and snuggly chair so I can sit comfortably and enjoy my coffee in the morning sun 😍 

I'm excited to start the heavy lifting, with regard to the spiritual and emotional work I need to do. I'm just waiting for the delivery of the altar table, and a few other necessities, then I can really get down to business. Honestly I'm just happy to feel excited about something again. Also, I think it's neat that what I'm excited about is just for me, and it's good for me. I'm also happy that it's a healthy thing that's got me feeling so excited. 

I've been back to doing yoga daily, and I'm back to my regular stretching routine - I've been at it a solid 30 days now, and I'm happy about that. I feel better, and a little stronger. Next on my list is to get my nutrition back to where it was 2 years ago … I admit that I have really let that slip, sometimes only consuming 400-800 calories a day, and I absolutely know that amount isn't enough. 

I've basically lost all of the muscle I gained and that really sucks. But I'm going to start over. I want to start working out again - and as soon as I get my nutrition back up, I will. I'm on day 2 of restarting my old nutrition routine, but I need at least a good solid week or two before I jump into regular workouts again. I think I'll do things differently this time though and focus less on lifting heavy, and more on just maintaining the muscle I currently have and staying well toned. 

Plus, I really don't want to dedicate as much time to working out as I used to, I'm planning to limit it to one hour per day. I'll still do at least 30+ mins of yoga and stretching as well so I'm still looking at a couple hours a day at least. Shit is hard though, and I'm frustrated at how easily I slip back into my anorexic ways, I swear this shit is a lifelong battle. Whenever my life feels out of control, I withhold. I know that it's detrimental to my health, but sometimes I don't even realize I'm doing it, and that's what makes it so hard. 

Anyhow, work is decent, busy as all get out and stressful as usual. I'm about to start interviewing for one of my vacant positions, that's exciting too. I'm happy to be able to at least fill one of them. That's enough about work though, if I'm not being paid to think about it, I'd rather not. 

I've been missing someone terribly lately, but I know there's no sense in reaching out. I know it wouldn't do any good, and it would just end up hurting me, so I'll do my best to keep stopping myself when I get the urge. I think not wanting to think about that situation is why I've been enjoying lyricless music so much lately. The music may still trigger an emotion, but without lyrics it feels much less specific. 

I might be social this weekend, idk, one of my lady friends wants me to go to the Cherry festival with her for a bit … I told her I might, but will I go? I don't know, maybe? If I had to decide based on how I'm feeling today, I'd say no, but maybe I'll feel differently when it's time. I just don't want to be around people, and mostly I don't want to risk seeing someone I really want to see. Small town life is rough 😂 

I know I've got to heal and process all of these things that trigger me, but right now I'm just trying to avoid being triggered. I'm not saying I'm triggered to the point of fight/flight/freeze, more like certain things are triggering unhealthy responses in me, and I don't like that; mental spirals and the loke. For now I'll avoid those things as much as possible, healing and processing comes next. I have to be in the right space mentally and spiritually to do that work, and right now I'm not. But soon I will be, and that's a guarantee. 

Coming soon to a theater near you 😅 

Ok, ok, my life isn't going to be projected onto some big screen, it'll just be me over here, healing in private and doing the work, alone. The same as I've always done.

You’ll find tips to help stretch your dollar, cut down on takeout, and make sticking to healthy eating a breeze — even on your most hectic days. Let’s make quick and easy healthy meals for dinner simple, affordable, and something to look forward to.

# Key Strategies for Budget-Friendly and Efficient Meal Prep

Staying on top of healthy eating doesn’t have to drain your wallet or eat up your free time. There are proven ways to make meal prep simple, affordable, and stress-free for busy people. With cheap meal prep ideas and a bit of planning, you can consistently serve up [healthy meals quick and easy ](https://amzn.to/42qKNyC)— even on the wildest weeknights. Here are the best strategies to help you stick to your budget, cut down kitchen hours, and keep meals lively and fresh throughout the week.

# Meal Planning and Ingredient Repurposing

Planning ahead is the backbone of cheap, quick, and healthy meal prep. Taking a little time each week to map out your meals and snag multi-use ingredients works wonders for both your budget and sanity.

* **Create a Weekly Meal Plan:** Outline what you’ll eat for each meal and snack. This helps you see where ingredients overlap, so you buy only what you need — and nothing gets left rotting at the back of the fridge.
* **Make a Targeted Shopping List:** After planning, jot down your grocery list. Stick to it. Wandering aisles without a plan leads to impulse buys and wasted cash.
* **Focus on Multitasker Ingredients:** Choose items like rotisserie chicken, rice, canned beans, eggs, or frozen veggies. These can mix and match in salads, grain bowls, wraps, or stir-fries for healthy meals quick and easy all week.
* **Repurpose Throughout the Week:** Roast a tray of veggies and toss them in salads, omelets, or wraps on different days. Cooked quinoa or rice works as a side, in a burrito bowl, or mixed with soup.

By getting smart about what you buy and how you use it, you stretch every dollar and set yourself up for quick and easy [healthy meals for dinner](https://amzn.to/42qKNyC), no matter how tight your schedule.

# Batch Cooking and Freezer-Friendly Meals

Batch cooking is a budget champion. Cooking big portions at once saves money, energy, and stress — plus, it keeps you from reaching for expensive takeout when things get busy.

* **Cook in Bulk:** Make double batches of chili, stews, baked chicken, or grain salads. Portion these into [individual containers for grab-and-go](https://amzn.to/42pDSpm) meals.
* **Freezer Meals are Your Friend:** Many healthy dinners freeze beautifully. Dishes like soups, bean burritos, marinated chicken, and hearty veggie casseroles retain taste and texture if properly stored.

# Smart Storage Tips:

* Use BPA-free plastic, glass, or metal [containers with tight lids](https://amzn.to/42pDSpm).
* Let food cool before sealing and freezing to avoid condensation (which can lead to freezer burn).
* Label everything with the name and date so nothing vanishes in the frosty depths.
* Keep single-serve and [family-sized containers](https://amzn.to/42pDSpm) for flexibility.
* **Reheating Like a Pro:** Most batch-prepped meals reheat best in the microwave or on the stovetop with a splash of water to prevent drying. For crispy items, a quick run in the oven or air fryer revives their texture.

Batch cooking reduces the temptation to order out or fall back on expensive, less healthy choices — saving cash and helping you stick to your healthy eating goals.

# Utilizing Kitchen Tools for Quick Prep

Embracing a few key gadgets can be a game-changer for time-starved home cooks. These tools slash prep time and make whipping up cheap, healthy meals almost effortless.

* **Slow Cooker:** Set it and forget it with stews, chili, shredded chicken, or even oatmeal. Toss everything in before work, and come home to dinner ready to serve.
* **Instant Pot:** This multi-cooker quickly makes rice, beans, soups, and one-pot dinners. Pressure cooking on busy nights means you can have a full meal on the table in under 30 minutes.
* **Air Fryer:** Perfect for quick, crispy veggies, chicken, or even homemade fries with barely any oil. Great for prepping healthy sides or reheating leftovers.
* **Other Handy Helpers:** A good chef’s knife, box grater, or food processor can also trim down kitchen hours.

Adding these tools to your routine means you can keep meal prep healthy, quick, and easy — opening the door to a world of cheap meal prep ideas and quick and [easy healthy meals for dinner](https://amzn.to/42qKNyC) with nearly zero fuss.

With these strategies, healthy meals quick and easy become possible, even on a frugal budget and the busiest of schedules.

# Cheap Meal Prep Ideas for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner

Every busy week needs a simple, affordable routine that keeps meals both exciting and healthy. If you want [healthy meals quick and easy](https://amzn.to/42qKNyC), planning ahead and focusing on cheap meal prep ideas puts breakfast, lunch, and dinner on auto-pilot. Here you’ll find practical options for every meal, each built for tight budgets and packed schedules — no stress, no fuss.

# Grab-and-Go Breakfast Options

Easy breakfasts set the tone for your day. When mornings are tight, you need food that can be made in advance, holds up well, and leaves you full. These staples are cheap, tasty, and quick to prep on a budget:

# Overnight Oats:

* Mix rolled oats, a spoonful of yogurt, milk (dairy or plant), and any chopped fruit you have — like apples, bananas, or frozen berries. Add a sprinkle of cinnamon or peanut butter for extra flavor. Store portions in jars and grab them as you head out. Oats are filling, low-cost, and customizable.

# Breakfast Cookies:

* Mash 2 ripe bananas with 1½ cups rolled oats and mix in a handful of raisins, nuts, or seeds. Drop spoonfuls on a baking sheet and bake at 350°F for 12–15 minutes. They’re naturally sweet, portable, and about as budget-friendly as it gets (recipes can cost under $0.40 per serving).

# Freezer Breakfast Burritos:

* Scramble eggs with cheap add-ins, like black beans, diced bell peppers, and shredded cheese. Spoon into whole wheat tortillas, roll up, and wrap tightly in foil. Freeze, then reheat in the microwave for a fast, hot breakfast. You can make a whole week’s worth at once.

**Tip:** If you want even more nutrition, add a handful of chopped spinach or salsa before you wrap the burritos.

# Simple and Healthy Lunches

Lunch should recharge you — without costing more than your morning coffee. These ideas use widely available, affordable items and are quick to assemble in advance.

# Mason Jar Salads:

* Start with a layer of dressing, then add heartier items like beans, corn, or grains, and finish with leafy greens on top. When you’re ready to eat, just shake and pour onto a plate. Mason jars keep ingredients crisp and are easy to tote.

# Budget Grain Bowls:

* Cook a big batch of brown rice, quinoa, or barley. Divide among containers and top each with something different — chickpeas, roasted vegetables, canned tuna, grilled chicken, or even leftover stir-fry. Add whatever you have on hand, making new flavor combos from day to day.

# Wraps:

* Grab a whole wheat tortilla and layer on hummus, greens, shredded carrot, and any leftover protein. Roll up tightly for a no-mess lunch you can eat one-handed. Wraps keep lunch varied and prevent flavor fatigue.

# Make-Ahead Bento Boxes:

* Fill [reusable containers](https://amzn.to/42pDSpm) with small portions of nuts, cheese, raw veggies, and a simple dip. Try sliced apple, carrot sticks, and whole grain crackers for balance. This keeps each lunch interesting, even if you use the same proteins all week.

Switch up sauces — like salsa, tahini, or vinaigrette — to keep these meals fresh. Prepping ingredients ahead, then mixing and matching, means you’ll never get bored or over-spend.

# Quick and Easy Healthy Meals for Dinner

When dinner rolls around, fast, [healthy meals are essential](https://amzn.to/42qKNyC). These cheap meal prep ideas focus on one-pan cooking and simple ingredients to save both money and time.

# Sheet Pan Dinners:

* Cut up any root vegetables (carrots, potatoes, sweet potatoes) and toss with a splash of olive oil and your favorite spices. Layer lean chicken thighs or sausage over the top and roast at 425°F for 25–30 minutes. Sheet pan meals make cleanup quick and pack in veggies per serving.

# One-Pot Wonders:

* Use a large pot to make hearty stews or skillet dinners. Sauté onions and garlic, then add lentils or beans, chopped veggies, a can of diced tomatoes, and water or broth. Simmer until thick. These meals are gentle on your budget and freeze well, too.

# Mediterranean-Inspired Dinners:

* Try bowls with cooked rice or couscous, topped with lemony chickpeas, sliced cucumber, cherry tomatoes, and a dollop of hummus. Add grilled chicken or keep it vegetarian for extra savings — these deliver a lot of flavor with basic, affordable ingredients.

**Smart Proteins for Your Dollar:**

* Canned beans and chickpeas (under $1 per can)
* Eggs
* Chicken thighs or drumsticks
* Tofu or tempeh (especially when discounted)

**Vegetables That Stretch Dollars:**

* Frozen mixed vegetables
* Cabbage and carrots
* Zucchini and summer squash in season

By keeping your meal prep simple and flexible, you can mix and match for healthy meals quick and easy every night, all without blowing your food budget.

# Time-Saving Tips and Meal Prep Shortcuts for Busy Lives

Every minute adds up when you’re juggling work, home, and a packed calendar. Sticking to healthy meals quick and easy for dinner often means relying on budget-friendly meal prep and smart kitchen routines. Small changes — like prepping in bulk, making use of shortcuts, and keeping your space organized — turn even the busiest week into a string of easy wins. With a little upfront effort, you’ll turn [healthy eating into a consistent habit without the daily scramble](https://amzn.to/42qKNyC).

# Efficient Ingredient Prep and Storage

Start every week with ready-to-go basics to shave minutes off every meal. The secret is prepping staple ingredients — your grains, proteins, and veggies — at the start of the week. This single action lifts the mental load of “what’s for dinner?” and sets you up to build cheap meal prep ideas into quick and easy [healthy meals for dinner](https://amzn.to/42qKNyC).

* **Grains:** Cook a big pot of rice, quinoa, or barley. Store portions in airtight containers in the fridge; they keep for up to five days. When you need a fast side or base for a bowl, just scoop and heat — no extra waiting.
* **Proteins:** Roast chicken breasts, boil eggs, or prep beans and lentils in advance. Pre-cooked proteins let you build salads, wraps, or stir-fries in minutes. Buy rotisserie chicken or use canned beans to save even more time.
* **Vegetables:** Wash, peel, and chop a mix of vegetables as soon as you get home from the store. Store them in clear, stackable containers. Toss them onto sheet pans for roasting, into salads for crunch, or straight into a skillet. Pre-chopped veggies are also sold in most groceries — these can be a huge time-saver for especially chaotic weeks.

**Pro Shortcuts:**

* Keep small bags of frozen veggies on hand as backup.
* Stash a few pre-made sauces (like salsa or peanut sauce) for last-minute flavor boosts.
* Portion out snacks like fruit, nuts, or chopped celery so you grab and go.

A little ingredient prep at the beginning of the week means you spend less time cooking and more time doing what matters most. The routine pays off with healthier eating and far less dinner fatigue.

# Organizing Your Kitchen for Meal Prep Success

An organized kitchen is the foundation of quick and easy healthy meals for dinner — especially when you want to avoid wasted food and build consistent habits. Structure your space with simple systems to cut down on stress and clutter, and make meal prep easy to stick with.

**Label, Portion, and Store:**

* Use clear, stackable containers for both ingredients and finished meals. This not only saves room but also lets you see exactly what’s available.
* Label everything with the date and contents — masking tape and permanent marker get the job done for pennies. This prevents mystery containers from piling up in the back of the fridge.
* Portion meals into single servings for busy mornings or lunch on the go. Batch-portioning also helps with portion control, cuts down food waste, and makes it easy to grab something healthy when you’re short on time.

**Kitchen Zones and Easy Access:**

* Set up zones: keep prep tools, cutting boards, and knives near your most-used counter area. Place lunch containers, wraps, and snack bins near the fridge door or pantry for quick access.
* Group similar foods together (like grains, breakfast items, or proteins) so you can quickly grab what you need without sifting through clutter.
* Dedicate a shelf to “eat first” items to reduce spoilage — this is key to keeping your healthy meals quick and easy while saving money.

**Storage Tools That Help:**

* Shelves, racks, or drawer organizers help maximize small kitchen spaces.
* Lazy Susans work wonders for condiments and cans.
* A regular clean-out of the freezer and pantry means you always know what’s in stock (and nothing gets lost and wasted).

Stay consistent by carving out a little time each week for upkeep — when kitchen organization becomes part of your routine, meal prep feels less like a chore and more like second nature. That’s the real key to keeping healthy meals quick and easy a regular part of your life.

# Conclusion

Making healthy meals quick and easy doesn’t have to cost a lot or take up all your free time. Simple prep, smart shopping, and batch cooking help busy people eat better while spending less. With cheap meal prep ideas and a little planning, you can skip expensive takeout and have real food ready to go — even after your busiest days.

I love to travel, and I’m always looking for the next place I'll go. When I'm not at work, you can find me studying for school as I'm working on finishing out a degree in IT, reading, hanging out with friends, enjoying a comedy show, or relaxing at home binge-watching a TV show. I've been exploring new hobbies and restaurants I haven't tried yet recently, so if you have any suggestions on something to try out, let me know.

Some things about me to get the conversation going:

Getting into the gym. I recently started, but it's becoming addictive.

Cooking - I think I'm pretty good at cooking and love trying out new recipes. I can send you some pictures of my handiwork.

Deep Conversations - Let's talk about anything and everything, looking for more than just the surface level to really get to know you.

Traveling - The furthest I've been is China. I have also enjoyed visiting Cancun, Canada, and traveling around the States quite a bit. I need to return to Charleston because it's such a cool city, and the seafood is chef's kiss! I would love to have a travel buddy to share experiences with.

Music - Send me a playlist or band recommendations. Bonus points if you know who Motion City Soundtrack is!

Coffee - Recently purchased a Nespresso, and will hone my craft as a barista to make the best lattes.

Tattoos - I've have 3 currently and will probably get more in the future. If you have any, I would love to see them and hear the story behind them.

Some more details about me: I'm 6' tall and rock a dad bod, but have been working towards getting in shape. Here are a few pictures of me and my dog: [https://imgur.com/a/ol0rlgc](https://imgur.com/a/ol0rlgc)

Warning, if we do talk, you will receive endless pictures of my dog doing cute things. Her name is Pepper by the way.

I've got my life together, a job I love, my own place, and a car. I'm just looking for that special someone to add to my life and spend time with. Looking for someone who doesn't just want to be pen pals and wants to meet in person. So, if you are looking for online only, that’s not my thing. I find it best to meet up in person and see how it goes from there rather than just endlessly chat on the internet.
