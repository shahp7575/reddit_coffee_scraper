It’s an amazing perk where I get 4 months off at full pay. My kids are 3 and 1. 

I’ve always known in my head that being at home with the kids full time is not a cruisey gig. My job can be quite high pressure but even then, normally by the end of the weekend I’m looking forward to the peace and quiet of the office where I can listen to some music, socialise with other adults and have a coffee in silence. And I was bracing myself for the physical and mental drain that comes with full time care of the kids. 

But I’ll be honest and admit that in some of my more shittier moments as a husband I’ve thought to myself “what has my wife been doing all day?” Definitely before having kids I had a view that it was much more cruisier than it actually is. 

All I gotta say is: don’t knock a stay-at-home parent until you’ve done it yourself 😮‍💨

That was something she’d never believe in again.Until another man saw her worth, breaking into her guarded heart.""You have no idea—she’s full of surprises.""Her ex scoffed. ""My ex-wife? Impossible.

She’s mine now.""Chapter 1 He SignedDesmond Harrison was cheating on her.Guadalupe Melton stood outside the CEO's office, frozen in place, still reeling from the dirty secret she had just uncovered.Her black high heels seemed to blend into the black-veined marble floor.After what felt like an eternity, she knocked on the door.""Come in."" A deep male voice rang out.Clutching the files, Guadalupe opened the door with her other hand and forced a smile.She strolled over to his side and asked, ""Are you busy? I got a few files needing your signature right away.""Though she asked so, she had placed the files in front of him and even flipped to the pages where he needed to sign.Desmond had just gotten back from a business trip to Thuoria that morning.Right after he got off the plane, he headed to the office. There was a stack of files on his desk, fatigue etched on his face. So he signed without even looking at the files Guadalupe handed him.""Thanks,"" Guadalupe said. Then she put away the files he had signed and asked as usual, despite knowing his answer, ""Are you coming home for dinner tonight?""""I've got something to do. Don't wait up,"" he answered without looking up. ""Alright. I'll get out of your hair now. ""She nodded and turned around, her smile turning into a sneer. As she walked by the attached lounge in the office, she heard faint sounds from inside, like a kitten or a puppy jumping off the bed. Her gaze flicked to the coffee table, only to see several packs of snacks and a half-empty cup of hot chocolate. And there was a toppled pink high heel on the floor...She realized something instantly, her heart sinking to the bottom. Then she came back to her office. It felt as if the way back to her office had exhausted her. As she sat down, she let out a sigh. Then she pulled out a file from those Desmond had just signed—a divorce agreement. She flipped to the last page, her fingers tracing over his signature as a bitter smile tugged at her lips. Meanwhile, memories flooded her mind...Back then, when Desmond said he wanted to marry her, he looked so firm and affectionate. Desmond's mom Elyse Garza, however, scoffed and told her not to get carried away, as no man would stick to one woman forever. Guadalupe insisted that Desmond was different. But she was terribly wrong. He thought he hid his affair well, enjoying the thrill of it all. In fact, he took his mistress together with him on this business trip. He even brought her back here. Guadalupe withdrew her finger, took a photo of Desmond's signature on the divorce agreement, and sent it to Elyse with two words, ""He signed. ""One week ago, they had struck a deal. Elyse asked her to initiate the divorce and not to tell the others about her secret marriage with Desmond, and she requested 150 million dollars from Elyse as compensation. A month later, Desmond would be a total stranger to her. A knocking snapped Guadalupe back to reality. She put away the divorce agreement and said, ""Come in. ""It was Desmond's assistant, Harold Osborne."" Ms. Melton, Mr. Harrison asked me to give you this."" Harold placed a dark green velvet box in front of her. She opened it and saw a set of expensive diamond jewelry inside. Instantly, a photo flashed across her mind. A short-haired girl in a bathrobe had a diamond necklace in her hand, her eyes hazy. Behind her, the light was dim, and the bed was messy. Her chest was covered with hickeys, indicating wild sex. Guadalupe felt sick. ""Thanks, Harold. ""She looked up at him, her gaze as sharp as a blade. Harold couldn't help but shiver.""Mr. Harrison picked them for you. It's unique,"" he instinctively added .Too bad Desmond's heart wasn't as exclusive. And she didn't want a cheater. She smiled, ""Oh, is that so? How touching. He managed to buy me a gift when he's so swamped? ""Harold thought, ""Something is off. Could it be that she has already known about Mr. Harrison and Ms. Graham...""He broke out in a cold sweat and strode out of her office. Guadalupe looked at the jewelry on her desk with disdain, like it had germs on it. Then she took out her phone, took a photo of them, and sent it to a second-hand luxury dealer.

She passes my apartment on the way to/from work daily. I have one cat. She is now an adult and is your very typical easy going cat. My friend frequently comes over to see her, and they are buddies. She and I have the type of relationship where we do small favors for each other, cook for each other, and take turns buying each other meals, coffees, drinks etc without keeping tabs. She and I make a similar amount of money. We both are able to pay our bills, but we both budget our fun spending. She has her own pets. She loves animals.

  
I will soon be leaving to go out of state for 8 days. I have asked her to stop by every other day (so 4-5 times total) to refill food/water and give her a little bit of attention. My cat is a big people cat. She will probably want to sit on her lap and snuggle the whole time she's here. I don't expect for my friend to stay more than 10 or so minutes each visit unless she chooses to do so.

  
What do you think is an appropriate payment for this service? She will tell me to give her nothing if I ask. She never indicated that she wanted anything in return when I asked her about this. I was considering a few things and would love to hear your thoughts. We live in a MCOL area.

1. we both go to a nice restaurant and I pay

2. Leave a $100 bill in an envelope attached to my fridge. Is $100 enough? Is it too much? 

3. A gift card to the spa for a facial (about $100 for where she likes to go)

I know that this won't really inconvenience her since it's only 1/4 mile out of her way, and she's not going to expect anything from me. What do you think is the most appropriate when it comes to a very close friend helping you in this way?

Personally, I dislike receiving cash because I always end up putting it towards some sort of not fun purchase, which is why I brought up the idea of a gift card or a fancy dinner. If you were her, would you think any of my ideas are a good exchange for the time spent? Is the amount I'm considering appropriate? I'm welcome to any other ideas as well.

As a 3rd-year life sci student drowning in midterms, I’ve had to learn some tricks to stay focused during those marathon study sessions. Here’s what’s worked for me:

1. **The 50/10 Rule**: Study for 50 mins, break for 10. Your brain retains info better in chunks, and those 10 mins are perfect for a quick walk or a snack.

2. **Hydration Station**: Keep a water bottle handy. Dehydration = fatigue, and we don’t need that during an all-nighter.

3. **Active Recall > Passive Reading**: Instead of re-reading notes, quiz yourself. It’s backed by research (look up the testing effect!) and saves time.

4. **Change Your Scenery**: If you’ve been at your desk for hours, move to a library couch or a coffee shop. New environment = mental reset.

5. **Phone Jail**: Seriously, put it in another room. Out of sight, out of mind.

Bonus tip: If you’re cramming anatomy like me, sketch structures instead of just memorizing. It sticks way better.

Honestly, it was kinda weird…  plus, it got exhausting having to keep the higher-ups oblivious.”

 

The nonchalance with which Agent Nine admitted this earth-shattering secret surprised Eight. Sure, he'd expected some secrets and surprises to come to light as he regained his memories, but this was something else entirely. He felt lied to, betrayed, by not only his twin sister but by his closest friend. Suddenly Four’s awkward, fidgety nature and her sudden confession before Eight left for the world tour made so much sense- she'd known what he'd find when he recovered his past. She knew, yet even then she hadn't told him the truth. But… with how scared she had been before Eight left, Eight wasn't sure he could bring himself to blame the poor girl. He bid his sister goodnight, plugging in his Memversal Headset to charge and climbing into bed. He found himself staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep, the memories he'd regained today playing in his head over and over.




*~Arrows flying into silence~*




The day they met had been… chaotic, to say the least. Rumors regarding the possible reemergence of the one the Octarians referred to as the Crimson Dawn (who he now knew as Agent 3, or the Captain) had been circulating through Octo Canyon for nearly a week, and after Tentakeel Outpost stopped responding the Octarian army was panicking. Their numbers still hadn't returned to what they had been before the Inkling’s purge of Octo Valley, which had resulted in them sending undergraduate trainees, including Eight and his sister, into the field to monitor the situation in Suction-Cup Lookout. Eight had been terrified at first, but Nine believed she had a score to settle and Eight wasn't about to lose another sister of his to the Crimson Dawn.

 

Neither of them had expected to discover a whole other teenager pop into their station.

 

Despite that setback, the other soldiers, Nine included, hadn't hesitated to open fire on the Inkling. At first, Eight pushed down any hesitation he had to focus on the mission: protect the eight mini Zapfish powering this Kettle.




*~Broken pieces lying around where it went down~*




The new Inkling made quick work of most of the Mini Zapfish, but by the time she'd claimed the seventh and sent it up to the Surface, not a single Octoling had gone down. While Eight had already known that this kid wasn't the Crimson Dawn, he couldn't ignore how different this situation was. When he got the opportunity, however, this fact didn't stop him from ambushing the girl and knocking her down, the business end of his Octo Shot planted firmly against her chest. But then, he saw something the others hadn't: fear. Despite all the Octarian propaganda about how evil the Inklings were, despite the conditioning he had gone through at the military academy, he couldn't bring himself to see that poor girl as his enemy. His older sister had always leaned towards giving others the benefit of the doubt… she had befriended the Crimson Dawn through that. And while that friendship had eventually led to his older sister’s death, Eight knew she wouldn't want him to give up on her beliefs because of it.




*~Waters rising back to silence*

*Quietly crying~*




Eight tossed his Octo Shot to the side, reaching out to help the squid up. She whistled a quick, quiet tune, still looking wary as she positioned herself defensively, just in case. Eight tried to communicate with her, but his fruitless attempts quickly reminded him that they didn't share a language. Well, this girl could probably benefit from some Octarian lessons. Eight brought the Inkling to a hidden, less easily accessed section and crouched, drawing out rough images in the dirt, trying to communicate that he wasn't a threat, to help her understand without words. It worked- she drew more back. The pair were isolated for about half an hour, simply drawing together. Eight taught her some simple Octarian words and learned some things about the Inkling in return- she was from an island outside of Inkadia, something Eight found odd considering she was a soldier for them… she was fourteen, so a year younger than he was, and the person she was with now called her Yon - Four. She didn't like fighting, but she'd been told that this was the only way she could go home. Pictures in the dirt could be surprisingly communicative!




*~Wondering how, and look at us now~*




Like all good things, Four and Eight's time together had to come to an end. But that was far from the final time they met- between Four’s infiltration of the kettles, and any opportunities Eight had to slip away from his commanding officers, they got together more and more. As time went on, the relationship between the two went from a friendship-slash-mentorship where Eight taught the Inkling his language to a little something more. Eight had taught Four the words “I love you”, and to his relief and amazement, she'd reciprocated. She'd even given him a piece of jewelry as a gift that night, a beautiful bracelet with blue and gold stone beads. Eight had worn it every day since, even after the Metro, despite having lost the knowledge of its meaning.

 

Both of them had known their superiors wouldn't approve, but that didn't stop them from meeting anyway. Those stolen moments, the nights watching the stars, holding his country's sworn enemy close, the days where he taught her the words to communicate better with him and would spar with her to help keep her from getting herself killed- they were the only light Eight had had in that dark time in his life. He hadn't cared about what the world would think- Four was his. He was hers. Nothing was going to keep them apart.

 

Until he vanished without a trace, waking up in the Deepsea Metro without a memory to his name.




*~We thought our love would take the world by storm…~*




Eight turned in his bed to face the window. Four must have been crushed . Nine walked into the room, getting out a change of clothes, and Eight sat up in bed, getting out to question his sister. “Nine? If Four and I were a thing, why didn't she react when we met her after the Metro?”

 

Nine sighed, closing her drawer and organizing the various articles of clothing shed now gathered in her arms before placing them on top of her dresser and moving on to the closet, most likely looking for a specific outfit. “I pulled her aside when we first got there and caught her up. You were struggling already with the fact that you had no idea who you were- having a worried girlfriend would just have added to your worries. So I told her to test the waters, see how it went, but not to push it.”

 

Nine retrieved a shirt from her closet, hanging it near the rest of her clothing. “You remember that first night, when she took you stargazing on the beach?”

Eight nodded, and his sister continued. “You two would always stay up late and stargaze before the Metro- well, you know that now. She wanted to give you a tour of the surface, but she also wanted to see if there was anything left of your relationship.”

 

Eight sat back down on his bed, fidgeting with his hands. He'd regarded that first night as one of the best in his life- he'd never expected to discover it was Four’s last desperate attempt to get her boyfriend back. “And…?”

“Well, when you didn't show any interest in her, she sorta… gave up. Never stopped liking you, obviously , but she figured you'd moved on. It was kinda her way of saying goodbye to the boy she knew in the Canyon and hello to Agent Eight.”

Eight never knew.

 

He knew that Four knew that, but it didn’t make him feel any better. He’d developed feelings for her (again, apparently) about a year into their friendship, but he always kept them buried, figuring there was no way she’d feel the same. They were friends, and while he was envious of whoever was lucky enough to end up with her, he’d known he’d have to settle where he was. Now he strongly regretted that.




*~Are we too far apart?*

Two worlds among the stars?*

You’re gonna take a piece of my heart*

*If you leave.*

*So it’s two separate ways*

*Or am I too late to say*

*I wanna fight for what we got*

*‘Cause I believe*

*In family~*




..........................................................................................




*~So are we still trying*

*Or simply surviving~*




Agent Four had tried so hard to let Eight go.

 

It never hurt her to see him happy, living the life he deserved on the surface. However, what did hurt her was the blank stare she got when she waved to him. The Octoling girl he was with (who she later learned was his sister) pulling her aside to explain what happened. Having to go from being relieved her boyfriend was alright to accepting that he was gone in the span of less than five minutes . It’d taken her a while to get over it, but her feelings had never gone away entirely. Instead, they’d just transformed, from a crush on a soldier boy who’d been one of her only companions as she navigated Octo Canyon to a crush on one of her coworkers and friends. Eight may have lost his memory, but his personality barely changed. He was still just as kind, caring, and chivalrous as he had been when she knew him.




*~Facing these giants*

*The bigger they are, the harder they fall~*




She’d gotten close to him again, telling herself that she was only looking for a friend this time. But the warmth in her face when he touched her hand, the extra care she put into her appearance around him, and the seemingly never-ending anxiety that she seemed to get each time she interacted with Off the Hook, constantly seeking their approval, told her otherwise. She couldn’t ignore it forever, no matter how hard she tried. The feeling nagged at her- there was no mistaking it, it was hope. She’d lost the boy from Octo Canyon, but maybe she had a shot at Agent Eight.




*~But I still believe in*

*The dreams we been dreamin’~*




When Four had heard that Eight was going to be taking a shot at getting his memories back, she panicked. Eight would find out that they’d once dated, and if he didn’t reciprocate them, he’d probably be disturbed by this revelation. Maybe enough to leave her behind for good… how awkward would it be for him to continue being friends with someone who has a crush on you? Not to mention the fact that he would surely be furious at the fact that she hid something so important about his past from him. Her only chance was going to be telling him the truth before he found out himself.

 

So when Eight had called her to Tentakeel Outpost to go over a favor, requesting that she cover him in keeping an eye on DJ Octavio, she jumped at the opportunity. It may well be her last. The two chatted for a while, catching up and going over the details of this mission. It was fairly simple- she just had to check in on the Octarian shogun twice a day, make sure he didn’t starve, overheat, or freeze while everyone else was away. Of course, Four planned on taking it a step or two further- not to lie, she felt bad for the old man. While he had tried to kill her, and hated Inklings in general, she was pretty sure this could be defined as “cruel and unusual punishment”. Regardless, at least she could help how she could, although she was going to miss Eight. She and Thr- Captain had never really gotten along, and Callie and Marie had gone with Captain to the Splatlands. It felt like everyone else was moving on, leaving her in the dust. Like she was falling behind. This would be good for Eight, though. He’d get closure on his past, something he'd been searching for for a long time.




*~The hope that we build on*

*It's never too far, it's never too far~*




Four hadn't gotten her words out the way she intended. In fact, her confession was a mess. But she knew she had to do it, so at the end of the day, she did. 

 

“I… Eight, look, when you get your memories back, there's some… stuff… you might remember, and you might be weirded out. So, um… I'm just gonna bite the bullet and tell you now, so you don't have to feel weird if we see each other again when you come back.”

 

She'd blurted out, gathering her courage. There. She'd gotten his attention- there was no turning back now.

 

Four had gone skydiving once, and since then, she'd viewed every challenge in her way in a similar light to doing so- if you're scared, you have to force yourself to take that first step. Make that jump out of the plane. Because after that, there's no going back, and all you can do is rely on your training and preparations to survive. And a skydiving instructor, in her case, but that was beside the point.




*~If we choose to turn and let these walls fall down…~*




“Look, Eight, you're like- the coolest guy ever, ok? You and your family are the only real friends I've had in my life, and I didn't want to lose you, but I can't lie anymore. You're- you're awesome, you're understanding, you're sweet, and caring, and you're stronger than I'll ever be, a-and I have a huge crush on you.”

 

She'd held onto her courage for all of three seconds after admitting that. But after seeing Eight's jaw hit the floor, the resolve she had had crumbled. He had been flat out embarrassed- humiliated, possibly- by her confession. His face had been red, and he hadn't said a word, just turning away from her. He hadn't seemed to even want to look at her. She'd tried backtracking, but even that hadn't worked well either.

 

“If- if you're weirded out by that, you don't have to talk to me anymore… Seriously, I’ll get it… it's hard to stay friends with someone who has feelings for you. I just wanted to tell you before you left, so I could be the one to break it to you.”

 

Well, with that, Four had decided that she wasn't going to wait around for him to tell her he hated her, so she'd decided to turn and run. Eight had left the next day, and he hadn't messaged her or anything during the tour- probably busy getting his memories back. Four hadn't pushed it. She'd expected Eight to cut her off, and here she was now, alone, in a cheap little coffee shop in her middle-of-nowhere town, her head stuck in the past. Well… she never deserved someone as amazing as him anyway. Eight had everything he could ever need in life, both controllable and uncontrollable. He lived with the richest duo in Inkopolis, and they doted on him constantly. He had the looks, the charm, his fashion sense. She had… none of those. They were just too different.




*~Are we too far apart?*

..........................................................................................

 

When Off the Hook finally returned to Inkopolis, the first thing Eight did was call Four. He felt horrible that he'd never done so before, but between processing her confession and then stopping Order and reconfiguring the Palettes, it never happened. He'd just pushed it off again and again, too scared to talk to her anyway.

 

Straight to voicemail. Four’s phone tended to do that, it was through no fault of her own, but it did complicate things a little. He had to take this chance, or it might never come again. Four probably didn't like him anymore after how he'd treated her confession, which was fine. Eight didn't deserve someone like her anyway.

 

But he wasn't going to give up hope. Should this fail, he'd know that it would never work out, but he was going to hold onto this last chance as tightly as he could. He tried messaging her, and this time was successful. He received a reply almost instantly- wow, either Four had needed something to do, or she valued his message enough to respond right away. Either way, he'd take it. He was able to coordinate a meetup, making sure to emphasize how he'd missed her and how excited he was to see her again.

 

“I'm just gonna bite the bullet and tell you now, so you don't have to feel weird if we see each other again when you come back.”

 

If.

 

That evening, in Tentakeel Outpost, she had said if . 

 

Four always tended to assume the worst- and she'd thought he'd never want to see her again if he didn't feel the same. She'd probably been so lonely for the past few months… but knowing now that Eight wanted to interact with her was going to be a huge step in the right direction for her. At the very least, it would nullify some of the negative scenarios she could come up with on her way to the pier. Eight slipped his phone into his pocket, making his way to the waterfront. The bay was beautiful in the evening, the water turning orange from the bright, reflective, light of the setting sun. He tried to enjoy the scenery, ignoring the speeding beats of his hearts and the racing of his mind to the best of his ability. Four had waited for six months for this moment. He could wait forty-five minutes.


..........................................................................................

 

*~I still believe~*




Four was in the quiet coffee shop, working on some coursework for one of her college classes when her phone dinged. She had customized notification ringtones for most of her contacts, so she was able to tell before she even picked up the phone who was texting her.

 

Not that she needed to. Her hand was on that phone the second it had notified her of the message- she was bored out of her mind anyway. Her mind processed the sound of the notification before she read it, and she felt one of her hearts- or maybe all three- leap into her chest. Eight was finally texting her.

 

“ Hey, I'm back in Inkopolis for a break on the tour. Can we meet up? I've really missed you, it'll be awesome to see you again! ”

 

Four shuddered. He wanted to meet up? After how last time went!?

 

No- focus. There had to be some reason behind this. Maybe he was going to lecture her on how she had “allowed” Octavio to escape. Which, while she had befriended the Octoling shogun, was technically untrue… but of course, Captain would probably pin the blame on her anyway. Or maybe she had a new assignment- Four wouldn't say no to that. Community college was too boring, she needed some action, or at least an excuse to go into the city. Whatever the case, Four couldn't help but hope that maybe Eight wasn't actually mad at her like she'd thought. Otherwise, he wouldn't have asked to see her. She shot back a reply asking for specifics, pulling on her jacket- it wasn't supposed to be too chilly tonight, but it had rained earlier and she'd rather be safe than sorry. Four got her reply- Eight wanted to meet at the pier on Inkopolis Bay. Four had been there once or twice- Eight had shown her the statue thing that he escaped from from that pier. Four wondered if her hypothetical mission had something to do with the Deepsea Metro. The others had never allowed her to see it firsthand, but she'd heard a lot about it. If she was getting a mission involving it, maybe the others held her to be more capable than she'd expected. She just hoped she could live up to it.

 

Four spent the train ride into Inkopolis on her headphones, listening to instrumental pop music to try to calm her racing hearts. She was only so successful. Once off the train, she made her way to the pier, which at this time of the evening was mostly abandoned. A wind off the bay breezed through her tentacles as she scanned the pier, searching for the Octoling she'd come to meet. There he was- right by the fence, looking out onto the water. Well, she'd better not keep him waiting.

 

..........................................................................................




*~I still believe~*




Four had spotted Eight from the entryway to the pier, but he spotted her not long after. She was running towards him, and he opened up his arms, pulling her into a tight hug as she came into his range, nearly falling back from the sudden impact. Four was surprised by his action, but she didn't fight it. It felt good to finally see him again- wearing a new hoodie, as always, she noticed… this boy seemed to have a new hoodie every time she saw him. His amethyst eyes shone as he looked down at her, and Four practically melted in his arms, tears welling up in her eyes. She'd missed him so much.

 

Eight had missed her too, of course. As Four's body tensed and relaxed, he rubbed her back comfortingly, calming her. She shuddered as he did so, but he kept on rubbing. Once she was calm enough, he gently pulled her away, but within arm's reach of him. There were tears in her ocean-blue eyes. He couldn't allow for that. He wiped a stray tear from her cheek with his thumb, a soft, reassuring smile on his face. “It’s ok… I got you, alright? I got you.”

 

Four nodded, but the tears only multiplied. Ugh, curse her emotional-ness! Now was not the time! She wiped her tears on her sleeve, nodding and hugging Eight once more. He didn't pull her away- he just met her where she was at. She'd always appreciated that about him. “I'm sorry… I was so stupid last time, I can fix myself, really…”

 

“You don't need to do that.”

 

Eight quickly reassured, carefully tugging a blue-and-gold stone beaded bracelet from his arm. “Do you remember this?”

Four nodded, but she wasn't sure exactly how to respond. There were a million different ways Eight could be going with this. “That's… the bracelet you have from the Metro, right? The only clue you had to your past.”

 

Eight nodded back, taking Four’s wrist, holding it in his hands. Their eyes met, and Four swore there was a hint of blush in his cheeks. She dared not assume it was for her.

“Mhm… but it means something a little bigger than that. I'm sure you remember… you gave this to me back in Octo Canyon, the night we both admitted our love for each other.”

 

Four hesitated, but she knew there was no use hiding it now. Eight had gotten his memories back- of course he did. She should have known this would happen… she was a fool to assume this would be anything more than a confrontation. However, the Octoling quickly snapped her out of her thoughts.

“Heyheyhey, don't go there. I can see it in your eyes, you're trying to come up with a bad ending to this conversation. Don't.”

 

He took a deep breath, steeling himself for this confession. He'd spent the past 45 minutes planning out exactly what he was going to say- but of course, now, he'd forgotten all of it. “I… I had a whole script, but I don't remember any of it, so I'm just going to wing it. I remember everything now. I remember how important this bracelet was to me, and I remember how important you were.”

 

Another deep breath. Just breathe. Believe.

 

“But this isn't about our past. It's about our future. I know we were together back in the Canyon, Four, but that's in the past. That said, you must be pretty dang amazing if you can get me to fall for you twice.”

 

There. He'd said it. As Eight spoke, he slipped the bracelet onto Four’s wrist, holding her hand between his own. She looked up at him, wide-eyed. He liked her back. “…Twice?”

Eight nodded, moving his hand up to her upper arm, pulling her into one final hug. He needed it- and from the looks of it, so did she. “Mhm… once in the Canyon, and once up here. I guess it's just a roundabout way of saying… I love you too, Four. I'm sorry it took so long for me to tell you that.”




*~That we're not too far apart*

*Two worlds among the stars*

*Don't take a piece of my heart*

*Please don't leave…~*




Four felt Eight gently kiss the top of her head, and she leaned into him, burying her head in his shoulder. “For eel…? You're not messing with me…?”

“I might mess with you sometimes, but I wouldn't joke about something this serious. I love you, and I'll keep saying it until I can finally get you to believe it.”

 

“…I love you too.”

 

Those were the only words Four could manage to get out, letting her body convey the rest. She let her fears melt away- all this time she'd waited for this moment. She wasn't going to let anything get in the way.




*~It’s not too late to say*

*Father, show us the way*

*To fight for what we got ‘cause You believe*

*In family~*




Eight looked up at the sky, which had darkened significantly, allowing the stars to come out. The duo sat in silence for a few minutes, until a small light streaked through the sky. A shooting star. He smiled, looking down at the Inkling he was holding in his arms. “Make a wish.”

 

Four watched the star fly through the sky in awe, then looked up at Eight as he spoke, meeting his sweet smile with one of her own.

I was rejected for this Spring cycle and I’m trying to understand where I might’ve fallen short so I can improve my application for the next cycle. I’d really appreciate any thoughts or feedback.

**Background:**

* Currently working as a **cybersecurity consultant at a FAANG company**, previously at Big 4 (total of \~4 years experience)
* Taken **a ton of online cybersecurity coursework/certifications** (e.g., CISSP, cloud security, etc.)
   * Have a good amount of certs (again CISSP, SANS certs, etc)
* Some **Python experience** — mostly small task automation at work and in a couple of courses (intro to programming and Python for data analytics)
* **Limited math** background — only did statistics, and algebra based physics in undergrad (but did well in those classes)
   * When I spoke to someone from Penn during a coffee chat, it sounded like these were enough to prove quantitative ability but I got mixed signals.

**Application notes:**

* Thought my **personal essay was solid** (happy to share with anyone willing to give feedback, resume as well)
* Got **recommendations from two Big 4 managers** who spoke very highly of me
* Honestly don’t think I’m underqualified, but I also don’t think I’m overqualified. I was hoping my professional experience would offset the lighter academic background, but maybe not?

I’m considering taking some online math courses (discrete math, linear algebra, etc.) before reapplying — but I don’t want to go down that path unless it’s likely to make a real difference.

-----------------------------------

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/s/iJzIPEbUAb): **March 29. 2025**

So my girlfriend and I have been together for just under a year. We don’t live together and both work full time and we are exclusive, as far as I’m aware.

About a 3 months ago, I notice my girlfriend spending a lot of time on the phone with her “friend” Jesse. She says that Jesse is a good friend and that’s it. However she often spends anytime she can on the phone with him, even when her and I are out. Their conversations don’t lead me to think anything but about 1.5 months ago, my girlfriend says she’s going to visit Jesse who lives two states over. I can’t go cause I have to work.

Of course I tell her that I’m not comfortable with her visiting a male friend out of state but she says that Jesse is just a friend. She will be staying at his place but Jesse is also a single father of 2 young boys so my girlfriend assures me nothing will happen. Despite me voicing my opinion, my gf takes the trip and shares her location to put my mind at ease.

She returns a week later and we move on with life. However, about two weeks ago, my girlfriend asks me to go to our local Target to pick up an online order she had placed. She tells me she ordered shampoo and a few hygiene items. I agree and go to pick up her order. When I get to the customer service counter and give them her name, they bring out a bag with a pregnancy test in it. Shocked and confused, I tell them that this what she ordered. I check the name and phone number attached to the bag and find it matches my girlfriend’s number so it couldn’t have been another girl with the same name.
They bring out the bag with the items she told me to get and I leave without asking more questions about the pregnancy test.

Shocked and confused by this cause there was no real way that I could have potentially impregnated her (we use protection) I later ask her why there was a pregnancy test at target in her name.

At first she says she has no idea and she did not order a pregnancy test. I asked her to show me her target app to prove it and she says that it was probably her sister since her sister uses her target account to order things sometimes. She also claims that women sometimes use pregnancy test to regulate their PMS or for other things other than to determine if they’re pregnant. I don’t know shit about how this works but she assures me that she’s not pregnant and that test wasn’t a sign of her cheating when she was on a trip. The other night we go out to dinner and she makes it a point to prove that she isn’t pregnant by ordering a few cocktails.

Am I wrong for accusing my girlfriend for cheating on me while she was away? I’m so paranoid but also don’t have real proof that she did.

**Edit:** needed to clarify the part about the pregnancy test .The pregnancy test was part of a separate online order. She asked me to pick up her online order at target which she said consisted of shampoo, deodorant and some lotion. When I went to the counter and told them her name, they brought out the bag with the pregnancy test. I said this isn’t what she told me was her order so they checked again and brought out the second bag with the right stuff as previously mentioned. After checking the info off both bags, I confirmed that both orders were under her name/account so I believe she secretly placed an online order for a pregnancy test and planned to get that later while asking me to get her shampoo. The pregnancy test was NOT in the same bag as the stuff she asked me to get.

**Update:** I never saw the pregnancy test after that so I don’t know if that truly was an order she made by mistake or if her sister used her target account to order that got herself. However I did bring up the fact that her sister lives about 20 minutes from her and has a target much closer to her so why would she place an order for a pregnancy test and have the pickup location further from her house? Even if her local target was all out, I find it hard to believe that her sister would order a pregnancy test under her account and pick it up near her house.

**Update:** so I went into a panic last night after reading all the comments so while she was out at work last night, I went to her apartment (she gave me a key) and found her iPad. I tried putting her birthday as a password and to my amazement, it worked. Yes I know what I did was dishonest but I had to know if she cheated on me. I looked at her messages and confirmed that she INDEED had sex with Jesse while on this trip. I’m so devastated and was a nervous wreck last night. My next move is to figure out how to break up with her and tell her how I found out. Thank you all.

**Relevant / Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** If she had said: “I’m buying it because no protection is 100% and sometimes I feel the need to test myself to make sure we are not going to have to deal with a kid rn” then sure maybe you could believe her but she gave you a nonsense reason

> **OOP:** To be honest she did say that during our argument as well but the messages between her and Jesse still confirmed that she slept with him while on that trip.
>> 
>> **Commenter 2:** Not that it matters was it one or multiple time during the weekend? I thought the kids was there lol
>>> 
>>> **OOP:** I don’t know. She told me that Jesse’s sons were gonna be there, I guess to make me believe that she wouldn’t try and have sex with him while they were there. But then again there was no way for me to confirm this. Nor does it matter now.

**Commenter 3:** Sure, the pregnancy test could have been placed in her order by error, but then she'd have just shown you the app to prove she didn't order it and wouldn't have blamed her sister.

She also wouldn't have lied about women using pregnancy tests to regulate PMS - this is absolutely not the truth and you should be insulted by this lie. The only thing pregnancy tests are used for is to determine if women are pregnant. That's it. She has changed the story like 5 times, and you want to believe her so much that you are starting to believe her.

Her having cocktails proves nothing except that the pregnancy test was negative.

She went to stay with Jesse despite your reservations about it, lied about the pregnancy test, and is making you think you are paranoid for thinking she cheated - without protection, probably.

**Commenter 4:** The pregnancy test isn’t a sign of her cheating but her reasoning is. Pregnancy tests don’t regulate anything. Her changing stories and excuses are all you need to hear to know she is hiding something from you.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/s/oCyQmgFkL6): **March 30, 2025 (next day)**

Thank you all for those that commented on my post yesterday concerning my girlfriend and my belief that she cheated on me.

TLDR: gf went to visit a male friend in a different state despite my protest. About a month later, I find out she secretly bought a pregnancy test. She claims she doesn’t know where it came from. I let it go and we move on.

So as an update, I realize that although my gf and i have protested sex, the chances of me getting her pregnant is possible. However, I strongly believe that despite our intimacy, I couldn’t have possibly impregnated my gf. Not to be disgusting and personal, but I NEVER “finish” inside of her because I want to reduce our chances of having kids until we’re both ready. That’s why when I saw the pregnancy test, I immediately thought she cheated on me.

Anyways I went into a panic last night after hearing all the comments and freaked out so I went to her apartment while she was at work (she gave me a key) and I found her iPad. I tried using her birthday as the password and to my amazement it worked. I immediately go through her messages and find evidence that she in fact had sex with her friend Jesse.

I’m honestly so devastated by this and I’ve been such a nervous wreck since last night. I haven’t ate and I’ve barely slept. Yes I know what I did, secretly going through her iPad and messages was wrong, but I had to know if she was cheating on me and if that pregnancy test she secretly order was cause Jesse may have knocked her up.

Now I’m waiting to confront her but I honestly don’t know how. How do I tell my gf that I know she cheated?

Am I wrong for going through her iPad and messages? Part of me feels wrong for this but you have no idea how much it hurts to know she did this. She was my first real gf in a long time and now I feel like an after thought.

**Edit:** as far as I know, she is NOT pregnant. She wanted to prove this by having a few cocktails when we went to to dinner last week. There’s no baby involved, thank god.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Just text her that you left the key near the door and that you 2 are over. That you read the messages and no coming back from that. Then go live a wonderful life.

**Commenter 2:** Not wrong. The pregnancy test, and her preposterous answers to your questions about it, caused enough concern to do some digging.

Just say to her “I know,” leave, and block.

**Commenter 3:** Take screenshots as proof in case she tries to paint you as the villain. Save them for the nuclear option. Leave the iPad out where she can see it and open to the messages. Leave your key behind and anything of hers at your place. No need to leave a note. Block her ass on everything. Tell a few trusted friends in case she tries to lie and spin it.

**Commenter 4:** Why do you have to confront her? You don't need a reason to break off a relationship with anyone. I do like the commenters idea of leaving her iPad open to the messages, leave the key on the IPad and then block her everywhere. I would screenshot the messages just to protect yourself in the future.

&nbsp;

[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/s/gL9W5eNsH6): **April 2, 2025 (three days later)**

Hope the mods will give me some slack as I just wanted to post an update to my previous two post as quite of few people were asking for an update.

TLDR version: gf took trip to see male friend but I later find out that she secretly bought a pregnancy test. Later found out through text messages that she has sex with him while on the trip.

So last night, I told my gf that I needed to talk to her. At first she kept saying she was busy but I insisted on seeing her in person so she finally said to go to her place around 8 pm.

I go over and I reiterated how eversince she got back from her trip, things have felt weird. She claims I’m the one who’s making things weird by believing that she cheated on me. She continues to claim that the pregnancy test was not hers and that her friend Jesse was just a friend and they just hung out. I then proceed to tell her how I know she cheated because I saw the thread in her messages.

“You came here without me knowing and went through my personal messages? That’s so messed up and creepy to be honest.” She says. We got into a slight argument as I told her that my suspicions were correct and she was trying to deflect the conversation. I asked her to give me her phone and I’ll show her all the messages I saw which were very clear and explicit. Of course she refuses and says “we are not married. We don’t live together. You don’t own or control me.”

While I agreed with her on that part, I decide to end things quickly and simply put her copy of her keys on her coffee table and tell her “you cheated. Plain and simple. Goodbye and good luck.” I walk out and she makes no attempt to stop me.

Later, she tries to text me and says that she’s sorry for what she did. At first, she claimed that Jesse was an old boyfriend that she never told me about and that they dated years ago before she met me and that he moved away several years ago. She claims that the messages I saw were old conversations they had but I quickly told her that was obviously not true. She swears that she didn’t mean to cheat and that Jesse must’ve gotten her drunk and it lead to sex. She assures me that she is NOT pregnant with anyone’s baby.

I told her “that’s good cause I don’t want anything else tying me to you.” I wished her good luck again and I haven’t heard from her since.

Personally, I’m relieved but I’m so upset and devastated by all this. I spoke with my friend Eric who told me that he had an ex that cheated on him too but she later tried to contact him years later when the dude she cheated on him with turned out to be a bum. Hoping I can move forward from this. Thank you all for your input.

Am I wrong for anything I did or the way I acted in this?

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Quick & clean. Good job. No need to hash it all out or look for an apology. Just end it bc she cheated. Done!

**Commenter 2:** Nope. Not wrong. You did everything right. There's no more arguing and lying. You'll find that person that's for you and no one else. It hurts but it won't last. Don't let her steal more of your time. Heal and love line you've never been hurt. Always trust your gut.

**Commenter 3:** Only on Reddit are people shamed for looking at their partners phone.

You did nothing wrong.

When you’re in a relationship, looking through someone’s phone is not nearly as bad as lying and cheating and exposing a partner to disease. Don’t listen to Reddit.

**Commenter 4:** It sounds like you did what you had to, and the result is painful but necessary. In the long run, you're much better off without her.

1juwy45,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1juwy45/just_booked_our_trip_a_couple_questionsagenda/,Just booked our trip! A couple questions/agenda breakdown/ itinerary critique.,"It’s been my wife’s dream to visit Costa Rica for some time. We just booked our trip (first 2 weeks in December) and it’s finally starting to feel real. First week we are staying in a bungalow at Tifakara Lodge in La Fortuna, and the second we are staying at Gaia Hotel and Nature Reserve in Manuel Antonio. All we’ve done so far is book lodging and flights.

We have a few things planned. 

La Fortuna:
2-day pass to The Springs Resort and Spa
Coffee/chocolate Tour
ATV tour
Volcano/waterfall hike

Manuel Antonio:
Full day waterfall hike with paddle9
Catamaran tour/boat charter 
National park day
Beach day(s)

Questions:
1) Booking tours/expeditions. I’ve read to book far in advance, but just how far? I’m thinking 3 months out would be okay? There are options to book through the hotels on their websites. Opinions on this option please! Do the hotels have the ability to book these things the same day or a day in advance? It would be nice to not be stuck with our hiking day, for example, if the weather is terrible, and to have the ability to move some expeditions around. 

2) Rental car. We’ve pretty much decided to rent a 4x4 and most of our research recommends having your own transportation. It would be nice to rely on transportation through the hotels, but it looks like it could get quite expensive. We are leaning towards Alamo for the rental company. Please advise your favorite rental service!
  -If we decide not to rent a car, how screwed are we? How walkable is La Fortuna and Manuel Antonio once you get there and how reliable are the taxis?Most of the tours/expeditions pick you up from your hotel, so the only reason we really need our own car is to get from the airport to the hotels and then back. 

3) Dining. We plan to mainly eat out. Breakfast at the hotels and probably dinner one night at each. Lunch will be on a whim at different Sodas. What are your favorite dinner spots? We are foodies and would like to splurge a night or two in both towns.

4) Catamaran/boat day. There is an all day(14 hour) expedition that goes to Corcovado. This is appealing but it’s a long, long day! For anyone who has done this, please tell me about your experience. The other option would be chartering a boat or doing a sunset cruise. Advice here too please.

How does this look so far? Are we missing/leaving anything out that we absolutely must do? We are going to pack sunscreen, bug spray, hiking shoes, hiking sandals, and light rain jackets. We’ve also download Duolingo and are learning Spanish.

I’ve enjoyed reading through this sub over the last few weeks and can’t wait to hear some insight/suggestions on our trip. 

Pura Vida!

1juwxil,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1juwxil/can_you_hear_me_silence_i_am_speaking_to_you/,"Can you hear me, Silence? I am speaking to you…","You may choose not to respond, but that does not mean I can remain silent. I long for your words, for some sign that you hear me. I cannot know what’s happening inside your mind, but I hope that my writing – into the silence, into the void, but really, to you – doesn’t frighten you, doesn’t make you want to run further from me than you already have.

In the last six months, I’ve stood before you countless times, though only for fleeting moments –  except for that one time, when we shared coffee and walked together. 

From the first instant I met you, I sensed something different, an unspoken connection. But when we touched, in the simplest of exchanges, and I met your gaze, I felt something I’ve never experienced before. It was an inexplicable feeling, one that ignited every cell in my body, something that only happens with you. I cannot explain it, but I’ve learned to embrace it.

I knew then that I needed to know you, to understand this connection, this… *us*. I cannot simply walk away from you. I’ve given this a great deal of thought, and there’s much more I haven’t yet said – but know this: I want this. I want *you*. I’ve been here all along – can you really not feel my presence?

It feels as though you keep pushing me away, not because you don’t care, but because facing the truth of your feelings seems too overwhelming or like you’re not worthy of them, or of me maybe? Again, I’m not a mind reader, so you leave me to assumptions, which are something I hate making, because they can be so very wrong. 

I understand the need for space, for time to sort through it all – and that’s okay. But when you retreat into silence, when you shut me out in anger and say nothing at all, it leaves me feeling as if I’m losing my mind. Yet, deep down, I know I am not delusional. I’ve seen the way you look at me, the way our souls intertwine. This cannot be one-sided.

The last thing I ever wanted was to make you feel uncomfortable or as though I were imposing my feelings upon you – that was never my intent. All I wanted was to be honest, to share my heart before more time slips away. I’ve been carrying these emotions for six months.

Do you want me to be angry? Is that what you expect from me? I know you’ve shared that trust doesn’t come easily for you, and that you’re shy. Perhaps you’re accustomed to chaos, to dramatic and unpredictable reactions from others – but that’s not who I am.

I don’t share my feelings publicly, and I’ve never done this before. Yet, I make this exception for you. Why? Because I can no longer contain these emotions, and I don’t know how else to reach you.

I’ve remained strong because I’ve had to – it’s the mask I’ve learned to wear. You have no idea what I’ve endured in my life, just as I cannot fully understand the depths of your own struggles. But I want to. I want to know you, to understand the weight you carry.

I’ve kept it all inside, partly because that’s what society expects, partly because I didn’t want to risk forming a trauma bond. But also, because I understand you are carrying something heavy. I sensed it the moment I first saw you, even though you’ve hidden it well. I know the depth of your struggle – though it’s different from mine, it is also the same. I know you don’t want to burden me, but I want you to know that I’m here, that I’m ready to stand with you. And I need you to stand with me, too.

But there’s something I must tell you that you may not want to hear: you are not the only one hurting. I understand why you didn’t confide in me sooner – it was too soon, and we weren’t that close. But I wanted to know. I wanted to help. I still do.

What I need now is clarity. A conversation – face to face, as I’ve been asking for, for months. There is so much I’ve longed to say, but I need to see your eyes. I can’t make assumptions about your letters, not knowing whether they are meant for me or someone else entirely. I’ve wondered countless times if you were writing to me, only to find something that contradicts it, sending me into confusion. I can’t live in this uncertainty. The changing usernames, the vague messages – all of it forces me to guess, and I am exhausted by it.

I think in facts, in logic. I don’t like assumptions, but when you leave me in silence, you force me to make them. I know you’re shy, that you’re unsure of what to say, and I understand that. But silence only fuels my overthinking. I can’t stop my mind from running through every possible scenario – just as I know you do the same.

So, I ask this of you:  Please, speak to me – reach out in whatever way feels right. Call me, text me, email me – directly. I would love nothing more than to see you, whether it’s for coffee, a walk, at my place, etc... Wherever it may be, I need to know your thoughts. I need to look into your eyes, for they, more than anything, will reveal what words cannot.",5,1744171124.0,UnsentLetters,3,1.0,False

Is there a lawyer fund that would hear my slam dunk documented proof of falsehoods case and say absolutely I'll take that.

Am I just fucked and looking forward to years of part time work while I scramble over all the lies and misdirections and appointments they're putting me through?

It's obvious that Vic was committed to their bits. However the problem with bits is that sometimes they land and sometimes they're not. The remote pun was funny but stuffs like the Evelyn Tucci bit was beaten to the ground by now.

Compare this to Jacob where even though he doesn't win the points, watching someone trying their best is *always* fun. Traveling to the underground of bumfuck nowhere is cool. Watching highschoolers blow his ass with two dozen of trumpets is fun. Etc. etc.

This also applies to other episodes where one of the contestants clearly 'doesn't care' like Grant in Like My Coffee.

1juws4a,https://i.redd.it/1uompk9oeqte1.jpeg,AIO my friend is mad I left her dogs at home to get dinner,"I’ve (31f)known this girl (30f)for about a year, we met at a coffee shop and have been hanging out once a week for coffee or shopping etc. I’d say we’re pretty close, she’s called me her best friend several times. 

I’m a very big people pleaser and I get taken advantage often which I am working on and have told her about. She asks me every couple months if I can dog sit for her and I have said yes every single time including when hurricane Milton hit our town. She went on vacation and I EVACUATED with her 2 dogs. It was very stressful and hard since my family has dogs too and her dogs don’t react well to others. I drove 13 hours with them and kept them safe with me for the duration of the hurricane. She kept promising to send money for a hotel room so I could keep them separate and not in a tent but she never did. I ended up sleeping in my car with them because they wouldn’t stop barking at my family dogs. 

This week she asked me very very last minute to stay with them for the weekend while they (her and fiancee) went to the Bahamas. I sent her photos here and there throughout the weekend. Today they were supposed to come home at 6pm and their flight was delayed and she texted me that around 12pm. Obviously not her fault! I have my own things going on and still when she told me that I said no problem and stayed at the house through the day. 

I let her know one of the dogs threw up a LITTLE bit and she gave me an accusatory “I hope you didn’t let him get into anything. This is concerning” I let her no that no I did not and maybe he was stressed. She then asked me to stay a little bit longer and that they would be home around 11. I cleaned their carpets, couch etc anywhere throw up got on. At around 10:30 I left to grab a late dinner and this exchange happened. She immediately turned her do not disturb on and ignored my calls. Am I crazy or is this mad unappreciative?",5,1744170599.0,AmIOverreacting,12,1.0,False

1juwqvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1juwqvl/extremely_slow_metabolism_leading_to_weight_issues/,Extremely slow metabolism leading to weight issues,"I'm 18F right now and have struggled with my weight my entire life. I have a very slow metabolism and gain weight extremely easily.

I don't have a huge appetite or overeat, I eat very normal sized portions for adult females and I live with my parents who are Chinese, so all our meals consist of balanced nutritious food made from fresh ingredients. I rarely eat processed food outside of the occasional dessert or fast food which I only get like maximum every 2-3 weeks.

I noticed however, whenever I would eat a normal diet of breakfast lunch and dinner that my weight would slowly increase. I don't believe I'm overeating (for an example of my past diet, breakfast would be a cup of milk with 5 pieces of dumplings, lunch would be a regular/small bowl of noodles, dinner has no carbs and usually is veggie soup or grilled chicken). 

Recently, I've been having only breakfast (which is usually just coffee and yogurt) and lunch (and sometimes only lunch as my one meal a day) and that has allowed me to maintain my weight. I'm current 170cm at 72kg which I'm happy with, but if I start eating dinner again then my weight easily goes up to 75kg+.

However, I'm so hungry everyday, the amount of food I eat isn't enough to keep me very full and I am getting anxious to eat more because I don't want to become an unhealthy weight.

I have asked my family doctor multiple times about this issue, she says it's because I'm young and my weight can be unstable but kind of passed it off as me being insecure and want to be skinny. I don't care about beauty standards I just want to be able to eat more than 1 meal a day without losing control of my weight and becoming unhealthy.

Is there an issue with my metabolism? I really don't know what's wrong and how it's possible for me to gain weight despite feeling like I'm not eating much. Right now practically starving myself is just enough to MAINTAIN my weight and I'm so tired of this. (And I don't eat snacks outside of my main meals). I really want to know what's wrong and my family doctor is very dismissive. Is there any advice on what I should do? ",1,1744170478.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I have an introverted friend (seems like it atleast) and lately I’ve realized our friendship feels kind of one sided. He never initiates anything. Whenever I ask him to do anything, he’ll say “sure, I guess” and show up about half the time and never seems excited about it when he does. It’s like he’s just tolerating it or something? So I stopped reaching out because I thought he just doesn’t want to spend time with me. It just got exhausting. I decided that I’ll just wait for him to make plans with me. 

I hadn’t heard from him in months, then two weeks or so ago he texts me and says “I have more free time now, let’s do something.” So I get excited and say “sure, I’m free the upcoming week!” hoping he’d try to make a plan, but never get a text or call back from him. 

I don’t really understand. If I want to spend time with someone, I’ll just text them and say something like “Hey wanna grab coffee Thursday?” Is this more difficult for someone who is more introverted or is it more likely that my friend just puts up with me?

I found she was meeting a guy when I was doing  2months long army basic training.(she was 22 been dating for 3yrs). She said they were just going for a coffee and I stupidly believed it. I always had my doubt so I asked her about it many times but she promised nothing happened.

After 7 yrs of dating, we moved to Canada and got married. 

Marriage has been really good. She supported me really well. I had no complaints. We built a great life together and have two young boys.  We had to live with my parents for 1yr and she really took care of them.

6 months ago I found some evidence that she might have actually cheated so I pressed her.

A few years ago, I did a loose sketch of a local coffee shop and posted it on my Instagram. I tagged them and they liked the post but otherwise I never heard from them.

Recently, I noticed their new to-go coffee cups have my sketch printed on it. The only alteration is that they seem to have scanned it in black and white (the original is in color). Otherwise, it is unmistakably mine. No one ever reached out to me for permission. My signature is not on it. I was not given credit nor compensation in any way.

Is this something I can take legal action for? Would it be worth it to do that? Any advice would be much appreciated.

Just simple things. I also struggle with when I can’t do things exactly how I want to because then there’s not the same satisfying dopamine hit with it. For example, I like to make pour over coffee in the morning, but sometimes I find the whole thing exhausting even though it’s the only way I want my coffee. Like I want my coffee that way or I don’t want it at all so then I’ll just go buy coffee where I know I’ll like it, but I don’t want to have this habit of buying coffee constantly.

Okay puns aside, here's what happened yesterday — I'm genuinely considering BITSoM over a few IIMs, and when I casually floated that idea to a few friends, reactions ranged somewhere between mild shock and full-blown disownment. 😅

The usual stuff followed, the cons and cons analysis:

* “ROI is weak”
* “Placements aren’t great yet”
* “It’s an ABG vanity project”
* “It’s too new, practically an infant”
* “It’s a private institute” (this one really stood out to me)

Now, I get it — BITSoM is unconventional. It doesn’t have the legacy or alumni muscle of the IIMs. But it’s also not claiming to be that. Now I am not going to make bold claims like its the next ISB or SPJIMR or something, it may or may not be. I can't see that far into the future but it definitely feels different.

But the moment I mention it, the ""private = inferior"" stigma, better known as the ""IIM toh IIM hove"" system, rears its head. Which makes me ask: why is there still such deep-rooted suspicion toward private education in India? Sure, there have been scams and shady institutes (NMIMS, you can do better) but there are also institutes like ISB and SPJIMR and a heck lot more in Engineering. Can a person not succeed in this setting?

Anyways since this is an MBA rant, I shall also talk about my experience with IIMs…

* Rejected without interviews from ABCKIM.
* Will likely be rejected from others (looking at you, Rohtak… still mad about that horrible coffee and 3k in application fees)
* SPJIMR is likely out too
* In contention for L, but we all know that’s a lottery with a painfully high bar for me.

So I’m left with: CAP, IITB/D, Shillong, Raipur, Sambalpur, Amritsar… and no guarantees on any of them.

In this uncertain climate plus the added pressure of being from an overrepresented category — is it really that crazy to consider BITSoM over some IIMs? Especially when we talk about long-term fit, environment, and the kind of exposure I’m actually looking for?

I’d love to hear your perspectives. Open to criticism, of course, but please keep your reaction between subtly annoyed and mildly shocked.

TLDR: me say to friends BITSOM good, friends say IIM better, say not private, public good bitsom bad. why bad? who bad? my life bad. less opportunity and opportunity hard. Me ask opinion of reddit BITSOM good?",14,1744169769.0,CATpreparation,9,0.94,False

Wildy successful and i was amazed as i have tried every diet trick around to get these results. 

What i did notice and still do even 3 days off reta completely. 

Tired, always felt “numb” or “lethargic “. Still forced my workouts and went along with my day but i could tell it was there.  Definitely the reta too and not on tesa only days. 

But worse than that was just feeling like pure shit when I would eat. Healthy or not, still felt like shit after only a few bites. 

3 days now no reta and still feeling that lethargic downward feeling when i eat. 

Have been using liquid iv electrolytes 2-3x daily and drinking tons of water and only 1x iced coffee.

Anyone else get this and find a fix while still taking reta?
Or, if you stopped reta how long until you felt “normal” again in regards to being able to eat?

I AM allowed to enter the main staff room to get a drink of water however. 

Also, despite it being in our EBA, I’ve been told I can’t buy annual leave or take unpaid personal leave. 

What else… oh I’m being constantly told I take too much personal (sick, carers, death in family) leave - I’ve been told this in earshot of other staff, who kindly raised my inability to take leave at a toolbox meeting where I wasn’t present (due to having a chest infection) so Management took it upon themselves to discuss my leave the other guys whilst I wasn’t there. 

I feel sorry for my managers because I’ve been taking contemporaneous notes and am in the CFMEU 🤣🤣🤣

I’ve actually applied for a role at the better site, if I don’t get that I’ll be bouncing from this place regardless. 

Weird thing is they really need me on this site, with my two other colleagues in my role both on 2 months leave as of Friday.

So i would eat one when i got home from work for about a week and if i was running late i would grab one for breakfast. last week we were at dinner with our family and she brought up the fact that i’ve eaten most of the Uncrustables. our dad said that she had ample opportunity to have multiple sandwiches over the past week and that they were fair game. our uncle said the same thing. I didn’t eat all of them and left one or two for her after realizing that i’ve eaten most of them. of course i apologized for it and offered to buy more. Today i bought some Cadbury mini eggs for her cause i know she likes them and i’ve been eating them when i walk past the little dish on our coffee table. as i was eating one she looked at me and said “would Cadbury eggs taste better if you shoved them up your ass?”. i feel like she said this to gross me out and not eat them. i bought the Cadbury eggs and feel i have the right to them. i’m correct for being upset at her comment?,4,1744168740.0,AmItheButtface,5,0.7,False

I decided to get the copper IUD due to mental health issues that I still struggle with.  I feared that any hormonal birth control might potentially cause great mood issues for me. I found a clinic downtown Toronto that does insertions without needing a referral since I don’t really have a family doctor right now. I had to have a consultation first where I asked any questions that I had about the copper IUD and the doctor basically just went over my options and wanted to understand why I was interested in the copper IUD to make sure that it was the best option for me. I was not pressured in any way to chose any specific method, she just made sure to tell me about the side effects that I can expect to experience if I decided to go with the copper IUD. After I felt like I had all the information I needed I had the option to book the appointment right away or I could wait and schedule something later on. I chose to just book it while I was there. They provided me with a prescription for the IUD and a consent form along with a checklist for things to do on the day on the appointment. I filled the prescription with my local pharmacy, it cost 75$ out of pocket for me since I don’t have insurance right now. 

The day of the appointment I packed a bag with
Tylenol, sugary snacks, water, my kindle and some headphones, the IUD and forms (and my keys and wallet ect.). I took the GO Train downtown which is about a 45 min ride and just had to walk two minutes outside to the clinic. That morning I had probably half a bottle of water a plain donut and a small coffee. About 20-30 mins before the appointment I took 1000mg of Tylenol (I take prefer to take Tylenol due to antidepressants that I’m on which it was specified was fine) and ate a granola bar. They took a urine sample first and then I waited a bit since I was a little early. The nurse brought me to the room and asked me some more questions (confirming my last period and when I last had unprotected sex and such) then she told me to take all my lower clothing garments off and showed me where on the table to sit and gave me a sheet to put over my legs. She left, I took off my pants and underwear sat on the edge of the table and put the sheet over me and just sat there on my phone waiting for the doctor for about maybe five mins. The doctor knocked before she came in and then she confirmed that there was no chance that I was pregnant. Then she told me to scoot all the way to the edge of table and put my feet in the holders (stirrups?) and lay back. She was asking me a question about some eczema that I had and when I finished explaining I thought she was still like palpating the area to examine it but she just ended up putting the speculum right in without any warning. The speculum was honestly the worst part for me. It hurt quite a bit at first but then it eventually just became like a really uncomfortable pressure rather than pain. I had opted to get a Pap smear done at the same time since I hadn’t had one in a very long time. So she did that first and it felt a little uncomfortable but nothing super painful really. After she was done with that she applied a numbing agent (I can’t remember what it was called) to numb my cervix. LADIES GET THE NUMBING IM TELLING YOU. I didn’t feel any pain at ALL. The only discomfort I had was the pressure feeling from the speculum. The doctor was so kind and constantly checking in with me, telling me what step she was on and when I might feel a little pressure or pain. The whole thing lasted maybe 5-8 mins I think, it was pretty quick. I instinctively sat up right away when she said we were done but I didn’t feel dizzy or anything. She told me to take my time getting up and getting dressed, and to just leave the door open when I’m ready for her to come back in. I got up and got dressed and honestly felt pretty okay. I felt the tiniest bit light headed so I just had a quick sugary snack. She came back in and reviewed things to look out for in terms of signs of infection and things like that. Then she said that at the six week point we could either schedule an appointment to check the strings or I could just get an ultrasound closer to home. Then I walked back to the train station got a coffee and took the train home. I honestly felt pretty okay, even dozed off for a bit while scrolling on my phone. I drove home and got into bed with a heat pack and felt alright for the rest of the day, didn’t even have to take anything. 

ONE WEEK UPDATE: 
I should be getting my period soon and the cramps are getting a bit worse. It seems like I’m experiencing cramps at a bit of a higher level than usual but nothing unbearable. Today every now and then I seem to be getting horrible pains that last maybe 10-15 seconds and then they subside a bit and return to normal cramps. I definitely am bloated as well, it seems to be going down a little bit though? I still have a bit of spotting but not much so I am still wearing liners. Will post an update when I get my period. Oh also I have yet to take anything for the cramping I’ve been feeling but if it gets worse tomorrow I might consider taking something. ",1,1744168627.0,birthcontrol,1,1.0,False

He and her text good morning/goodnight every day. They talk immediately on the phone after work (he calls her first before me). She will call/text randomly around 2am on weekdays. She demands that he always answer or she gets very upset and screams at him. We will be having se x and she’s always blowing his phone up. I’ve asked him numerous times to speak with her to not call after 10pm, yet she still does.

She demands that they go out once a week after work (10pm - midnight) and he CAN NOT be on his phone whatsoever with anyone or me. My friends have seen them out together and they told me that her hands were all over him. She’s VERY flirtatious. Today, she demanded that he leave my house and go have coffee with her at 9am on a Tuesday. He proceeded to go; even after me in disbelief standing in my garage. My boyfriend doesn’t even go out with me once a week after work!! Let alone morning AM coffee!!

I’ve met the lady. She s a 70 year old lady and she DOES NOT like me. She will be rude and snide to my face while my boyfriend stands there and says nothing. She even told me that he is single until he is married. She’s never been married/no kids. She’s only friends with people in their 20’s/30’s. Weird. She tells him he’s handsome and they both say “I love you “ on the phone.

I know this is NOT a normal “friendship”. But he brainwashes me by saying she’s “like a mother to him”. He says I’m jealous of her. I have zero jealously of a 70 year old woman. I’m 37 and quite the catch….. I don’t understand whatsoever why my boyfriend has her as his main priority. 

I have blocked him and broke up with him today after the whole 9am coffee “date”. Please tell me I have been delusional for the past two years and that my boyfriend MUST have some kind of emotional/physical relationship with her.

For that reason, many found Eric to be pretentious. He didn’t just love music. He breathed it, made love to it, and made it breakfast in the morning. The man couldn’t envision any greater meaning in life than to be seated at a piano, tapping away at those keys. That’s how he ended up boring the seller of this ghost piano half to death.

“Look, it’s a fine piano.” The older gentlemen sighed, rubbing his forehead. “Nothings wrong with it and all that. Yes, it’s haunted, but it’s a fine specimen. Real old thing, beautiful keys.” Baxter hoped he could finally sell this darned cursed piano, hoping to push the thing onto some poor customer at his antique store. Though, his morals stopped him from neglecting to mention the haunted aspect, that turning most off its generous price.

“Ah, it looks fine. Nice hammer, and a splendid damper too. It’s been well loved, like my ex-girlfriends.” He circled the piano, beaming. “Sir, may I tickle the ivories?”

“WHAT? I’m a married man. What sort of establishment do you think this is?” He puffed, fidgeting with the thick hairs on his arms, unable to believe the nerve of this customer to suggest they did such an act.

“Ah, I understand. You’re a fine man. I respect you for having the courage to say no. It is a thing meant to be enjoyed and not played carelessly. You have a keener sense of music than I expected. I tip my hat to you.” He said, tipping the dark fedora he wore, letting his wavy blonde hair fall down his handsome face. “Though it is a shame I can’t play this piano. I would love to hear her sound.”

The man jolted upright, only just making the connection between the ivories and the piano. “Oh, you can play the piano.” He blurted out, not about to explain that misunderstanding.

“And a kindhearted gentleman, too. Thank you.” He took a seat, playing a small jaunty tune, testing out the keys. When he finished, he was grinning from ear to ear. “She’s splendid. I won’t ever need a lover, for my heart will be full of her.”

“Um. Yeah? Ok?” Baxter moved to his register, trying to rush the man out. “So, it comes to an easy one thousand dollars. We’ll handle delivery too.” He said, sweetening the deal.

“No, no, no. That won’t do.” Eric said, slamming his hands on the counter, sending his black tie flying upward from the melodramatic movement.

“I’m sorry?” Baxter gulped. Of course he would want a discount. It’s a cursed piano after all. “Ok, look. I really need to move this thing out of my place, so I’ll go as low as-“

“Four thousand. Music has a soul, and the soul hurts when it’s underappreciated. She needs to feel my love, understand my respect. Only then can we properly play as a united force.” Eric placed the money on the counter. “There. That should cover it.”

“But, sir. That’s too much money. It will keep you up at night. It’s been driving the people next door mad. I really can’t accept that much money for a cursed piano.”

“There is no such thing as ghosts. It’s a silly tale, said by sillier men. Now, please have it at my home by tonight. I will take out a nice bottle of wine for its arrival.” Eric gave his address and left, leaving Baxter in awe of the insanity that was Eric Layith.

At home, Eric set candles around his living room, having no tv, or coffee table. Only a bare space fit for a piano, with a lounge that someone could watch him play from. He considered tv a rotting disease that dulled the brain, and any games as a force to cripple perfectly fine music playing fingers. For entertainment, he had his books and radio. Those being all he needed to keep sane.

When the piano arrived, he gave it a show of affection, walking out with a bottle of 1960s Pinot Noir from Burgundy. The wine being kept only for a special occasion, and Eric couldn’t imagine a more special moment than this. He lowered the curtains, set the mood and flicked on a classical radio station, before sliding onto his stool, getting goosebumps as he felt that rush of excitement that came from receiving a magnificent gift.

He set his wine on the floor, patting the lid of the piano. “I must be honest. I had another before you. A beautiful piano that brought me pleasure that no one else could. Sadly, I lost her. They couldn’t fix the damage, and she had to be retired. I still think about her daily. I know it may be weird seeing photos of me and her around the house, but I assure you. I am fully committed to you. I’m just not ready to forget my love for my past piano.”

After saying that, he poured a glass of wine and smiled. “I’ve poured my heart out to you. Now pour your heart out to me. Let us be one.” He played, fingers dancing on the keys, as if they were tripping the night fantastic.

Six hours passed, and Eric was sweating over the piano, his hunched body clinging to the lid with a grin. “Beautiful. Utterly beautiful.” He wiped a tear from his eye as he stood up, stumbling a bit from the bottle of wine. “My dear, I will see you soon. I love you.” He went to bed, hearing music as his head hit the pillow. Even in his dreams, he heard music. He thought, only for the music to become clanks and clacks, rather than pleasing sounds.

Instantly, the noise sobered him up, Eric bouncing to his feet in disgust. To play music poorly was to slap the gods in their faces and swear at their love. He marched down the stairs in a hurry, seeing a ghostly young male struggling with the keys.

He looked to be a little older than twenty-four, with a boyish face and curly black hair. The pale ghost had his tongue half out of his mouth, focusing on the keys, while being unable to play them.

The sight was… It was…. Magnificent. While the music was poor, Eric didn’t care. What he saw was more important than good music. It was love. To play music poorly was to insult the gods, but to learn music was to attend your weekly masses. It was the beginning of a deeper meaning, and a sight that warmed the music loving heart of Eric.

So he sat and listened. He mentally critiqued their mistakes, noting areas for improvement, and even hummed along when a note hit the right tune. When they were done, Eric gave a small clap, startling the ghost.

The ghost instantly bowed its head in shame when it saw Eric, though Eric wouldn’t allow that, encouraging them with more applause. “My boy, that was splendid. My heart ached, my soul wept, and most important, my heart understood. You love her, but there is pain in your playing.”

The ghost remained silent, gripping its knees, as if it expected a scolding. The knuckles of the ghost shaking as Eric moved on the stool, sitting beside the ghost. “Listen for a moment, my boy. Watch my movements and play along afterwards. Let’s share a moment.” Eric played a simple tune and waited. The ghost did nothing. Eric played again, and the ghost did nothing. “Please, have a go.”

“I’m sorry. I’m not good at this. It’s a stupid dream. I’m sorry.” It said, burdened by the weight of its former life. Eric sighed, leaning back on his stool, staring at the piano.

“A stupid dream. My boy, there are no stupid dreams, only stupid dreamers who give up on those dreams. Dreams are what make us human, what give us meaning. To call them stupid is to call the act of being human stupid. And dare I say, boy. If you think it’s a stupid dream, then you may very well be the stupid one, because the dream certainly isn’t.”

The ghost listened, though it made no movements towards the keys.

“Do you like playing the piano?”

It hesitated before nodding.

“Then show her that. I don’t know who told you that this dream was stupid, but they were a fool. If you want to play, play. If you don’t feel like playing, listen to me and learn. Just know that by not playing, you're hurting her feelings as much as you're hurting your own.” Eric hovered his hand over the keys, only for the ghost’s pale fingers to shift through his hands, playing beneath him.

Eric moved his hands above the ghosts, mirroring the keys he should touch. The ghosts playing awkward, and out of time, but it was improving. The two played in silence until the morning sun pushed through the curtains, reminding them that the day had to start once more.

“Morning?” Eric said, strained eyes glancing back at the curtain. When he looked back, the ghost was fading, needing some rest of his own. The ghost hovering awkwardly beside Eric, watching the man.

“Sir,” the ghost said, hands crossed over its stomach.

“Yes, my boy?”

“Would you teach me more tomorrow? I’m sorry, I’ll go.” The ghost floated through the roof, only for Eric to hit a beautiful key, the sound stopping the ghost, making him look back down at the piano with that same awe that Eric held.

“I would be insulted if you didn’t join me tomorrow. We will play a ghostly piano four hands duo until you master the craft. So, please. Don’t apologize or feel scared about your love. You’re in the dwelling of a like-minded lover of the arts.” Eric said, before yawning. “A very sleepy lover of the arts.”

The ghost smiled, before vanishing, leaving Eric to head to bed. As he laid down, he heard more music, though it wasn’t the ghost playing, instead it was simply the sound that his brain conjured up with its thoughts, before falling asleep.",7,1744168566.0,Sadnesslaughs,0,1.0,False

I am in therapy and medicated and that has been helping with my outbursts. During one of my rage episodes, I was throwing things into the fridge after I angrily packed his lunch for the following day and slammed both the fridge doors. My daughter was in her bouncer next to the fridge and my husband was scared that I was going to keep throwing things or things were going to fall off the fridge and hurt her so he grabbed me by the neck to frighten me into stopping and control the situation (he admitted to this in therapy. I left him and we started couples counseling and I returned home after a month apart. I felt like what he did was wrong, but he panicked and was scared for our daughter so I was willing to work with him to save our marriage. Jump to this week which is four months since the first time. We were getting ready to meet up with family and I set the baby on the bed without mentioning it to him (he was literally right there so I didn’t think I had to verbalize it) well she went to crawl and got about a foot away from falling and he yelled at me for not telling him I’d sat her on the bed. I don’t remember exactly what I said but it was along of the lines of “I’m sorry I didn’t realize” but I said it with an attitude. He called me out on having an attitude and I said I didn’t have one. He kept saying I did, and I kept saying I didn’t while I took our daughter downstairs and started to put her in her car seat. He then came up behind me, grabbed me by the shoulders and sat me on the couch, moved my hands to my lap, and grabbed my chin with both hands and forced me to look up at him. He moved my face quickly and it scared me so I went to hit him, but he grabbed my hand before I could. So I moved around him and tried to run out the front door (after I threw a sprite can and pepper shaker that was left on the coffee table into the kitchen) before I could even get all the way out the door he grabbed and pulled me back inside, I continued to panic and grabbed his steam deck that was right there and threw it hoping that would get him to let me go, but instead he shut the front door and pushed me up against it. At this point I was a crying mess and dont remember what was said. After I calmed down he told me that it doesn’t count as abuse because his intentions weren’t to hurt me but to comfort me… part of me doesn’t want our relationship to end, but I also don’t want my daughter to grow up seeing things like that. He said he understands now that it’s never okay to put your hands on someone during a fight even if the intentions or pure and he said he’ll never do it again. But he also said that the first time.

I wanted to know if my experience is typical or something I should be more wary about. My goal isn't to completely quit caffeine, but I want to limit myself to 200mg a day. I never really did the math until I realized I was getting heart palpitations with alarming frequency: i was drinking about 500-600mg a day.

I havent quit cold turkey, but I have been limiting myself to that 200mg a day and it's been rough. I have almost checked myself into the ER twice and it's been a week now. At first, I had chest pain, dizzyness, and nausea. That eased up, but im still dizzy and have considerable head fog- it almost feels like an out-of-body experience. I'm not really experiencing any drowsiness though, but frequently my heart has been racing.

I am someone who has never struggled with high blood pressure before (i normally hover around 115/70 ish). I checked a few days ago when I was feeling particularly bad and I was 136/88 (I am back down to a normal bp today).

Today I woke up feeling a clarity I haven't felt in a while, and decided I would have a small coffee on my way to work (in contrast my usual order had 5 shots of espresso in it- this had 2). I couldn't finish it because it made me so jittery, and without paying attention I had a large diet coke with lunch that pushed me out of my comfort zone with dizzyness and a racing heart (not a mistake i will repeat).

I felt better after a few hours, and was hoping the worst of my withdrawal was behind me but im back to serious head fog again and dizzyness.

Can anyone weigh in? I also keep forgetting that these are probably withdrawals because last night I was googling rabies symptoms thinking maybe that made more sense 😭",2,1744168012.0,decaf,3,1.0,False

Is this normal?","Hey everyone! Recently been an Aeropress for the past two months and I have had a blast making coffee with it. After years of drinking Folgers, I've finally taken the plunge into buying actual whole bean coffee from local roasters as well as stuff like the Aldi Peruvian beans. I can enjoy coffee without sugar or creamer and enjoy it for the unique interesting flavors coffee can provide.

I recently bought a Fellow Prismo as I ran out of paper filters and was curious about how the metal filter in the Prismo would perform. Prior to this I first began brewing using the inverted method with about a 2:15 minute brew time using around a medium grind (I use a Kingrinder K6 at around 80 clicks for reference). I then transitioned to using the James Hoffman method which has also been excellent, and I utilize that method when brewing in the Prismo.

I noticed coffee just tastes slightly different, but not in a bad way. I am not experienced enough to be able to taste specific notes, but it seems like some flavors are a bit more pronounced when using a metal filter. I also notice a very small amount of fines making it through the valve, but I don't mind it at all.

Is this a normal experience when brewing with metal filters? Is there any specific brewing methods I should keep in mind when brewing with the Prismo over using the standard paper filters? Thanks for reading!",5,1744167901.0,AeroPress,8,1.0,False

This is a long story but I want to make it short.

I met this guy last year in April in the library and we opened up a lot, very fast. He eventually introduced me to a lot of his friends and family and we talked more (started going to his church). He's one of those very argumentative guys who has strong beliefs and rarely negotiates (loves to debate types and laugh at you for not agreeing with him). I didn't see this side of him until things settled down.

I gave him a lot of advice regarding girls and career stuff etc. I came to him for advice like once regarding a job interview I had even though he doesn't have experience with interviews (he works at a movie theatre and I work in a high rise office. im not putting him down when I say this for your information but he hints at wishing he could do my type of job). The other day, the topic of politics came up and he mentioned how he is a republican and asked what I support and I said democrat. He said he guessed its probably because my father was a democrat and I said yes, partially but not entirely because of my father. He laughed and said how much (in terms of influence) ? I said I wouldn't quantify it and then he said ok ""I'm gonna assume a lot"" and started to tell me about how everything ive agreed with is basically what republicans support. it sounded like he was trying to convince me, subtly - even started telling me to go read more on DJT and what he stands for and to not listen to media's that destroy his reputation.

The next day, over text, I addressed the part where he assumed im solely a democrat because of my father and said ""Hey Charles, I didn’t appreciate how you tried boxing me in yesterday when you said you believe the reason I’m liberal is solely due to my father after I told you I didn’t want to go into politics. An apology will suffice"". This sparked conflict and asked me to meet him in person which I did. But he sent this before we met that evening when we went back and forth :

""Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I’m looking forward to taking about what you didn’t like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I’ll hit u up for next time. I’m looking forward to it.""

I ended up going to meet. I bought us both coffee at Starbucks and sat on a couch with him. In person, he insulted my character, raised his voice and said I only asked him to apologize because I have low self esteem and low confidence and how I want to bring him down to my level by forcing an apology and submit, how he doesn't trust me, how I love to argue, how controlling I am etc. I told him he's wrong about me and im not doing that and even mentioned the things ive done for him that were in his best interest like uplift him (not to come off as bragging but to dismantle his argument and show him my perspective).

After he left. I sent him this :

I don’t feel bad about myself Charles nor do I have low self esteem. I'm ok the way I am, Charles even much better than others

This apology thing bothered you that much, to the point where you began insulting me and throwing all kinds of bad words in my direction. 

People do things in their life, sometimes bad sometimes good, even you joke about it when it happens. 

But you took it seriously today (even the texting) and threw unnecessary bad words against my character. Non stop.

I’m not interested in ever being friends after this. I don’t deserve this type of treatment and disrespect. Ciao for now"".

Its been almost 9 weeks of no contact and i've stopped going to that specific church (I get texts from people at church saying they miss me and asking if everything is alright but I just say ive been busy with work and school stuff to avoid drama). When he sees me in passing he just nods my head or actually gives me a pound with his fist and says ""hey what's up Adam"". 

Also, if he ever comes up to me to try to ""talk"", what should I do/say? Ive completely ceased contact with the entire group.",2,1744167856.0,Advice,2,1.0,False
1juvyan,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1juvyan,Update 9: Yamjam,"On Monday the tape muzzle held really well through his shed and over the weekend... a little too well tbh. I rubbed some olive oil on the tape to get it off but Yamba was very very upset and once i had the top unsticked Yammy just started to shake his head to get the rest off, it sorta worked but i still had to get the part across his snoot off. So that was unfortunate. In the later images the tape muzzle is with two different tapes, one less sticky for the main bulk and then the sticky one that is only on his skin in a couple of places and just on the other tape. It has worked really well so far even though Yamjam hates it! 

I gave him yummy foods after getting his muzzle off on Monday, my boy nearly cleaned his plate before we had to go to the vet for his antibiotic shot. So proud of my baby. I sat down in front of his enclosure, with my coffee and just watched him bask and tried to get him to finish off his food. No touching when he is in his in house, he was very huffy. But when I had him on the counter he let me pet his back! I do notice a bit of swelling or something on the injured side. I need to ask the vet if they think it's a problem....

Today he was really into basking after i uncovered him this morning; he goes literally under everything in his tank when he sleeps at night (he does burrow normally so i think this is just the closest he can get ;\~; ). And then he really started zoomin. I was wondering he might need to go to the bathroom, he was really moving. I picked him up and put him on my shoulder to calm him down a bit. He stand there and then backed up and i gently let him climb down. He looked around and decided to poo right then and there on the floor. Which sucks it was on the carpet but i did have some rags nearby to catch most of it. He went up the towel ramps and i went to work cleaning up his poo. He just watched me lol. Then he went into his blankets and started to wind down and hide. 

Tomorrow I gotta uncover him, remove the tape, give him pain meds, feed him, let him bask a bit, then to the vet. I really miss his usual inquisitive, active self. I have been listening to his boundaries unless i gotta get him out of his enclosure, which i hate but it is required. Yesterday i moved to fast and he flinched!

## Key Features Analysis

The best ipad 9th generation keyboard cases offer a combination of protection, functionality, and user comfort.**keyboard Layout and Key Travel:**

A good keyboard case should feature a well-spaced layout with tactile keys that provide satisfying feedback. Key travel, the distance a key moves when pressed, is crucial for pleasant and efficient typing. Optimal key travel typically falls between 1.0mm and 1.5mm,ensuring a balance between responsiveness and preventing accidental keystrokes. the arrangement of keys should mirror a standard laptop keyboard to minimize the learning curve and maximize typing speed.

**Connectivity and Power:**

Bluetooth connectivity is standard for most keyboard cases, offering wireless freedom and easy pairing with the ipad. However, some premium models utilize the ipad's smart connector for a direct connection, eliminating the need for batteries or separate charging. Power efficiency is also important; a long-lasting battery ensures uninterrupted usage during extended work sessions or travel. A typical battery life should range from 80 to 100 hours of continuous use, with an extended standby time.

**Materials and Durability:**

The materials used in construction directly impact the case's durability and overall feel.Polycarbonate and ABS plastic are common choices for their lightweight and impact-resistant properties. Premium cases may incorporate aluminum alloys or fabrics like polyurethane leather for a more refined look and enhanced protection. The hinge mechanism, which connects the keyboard to the case, should be robust and able to withstand repeated opening and closing without loosening or breaking. Durability will determine how well your keyboard case holds up to daily wear and tear.

**Protection and Design:**

Beyond typing functionality, a keyboard case should provide adequate protection for the ipad against scratches, bumps, and accidental drops. Raised edges around the screen and camera cutout can prevent direct contact with surfaces, minimizing the risk of damage. The case's design should also complement the ipad's aesthetics, maintaining a slim profile and allowing easy access to ports and buttons. A secure closure mechanism, such as a magnetic clasp, ensures the case stays closed when not in use, further safeguarding the ipad.

key features of the best ipad 9th generation keyboard cases include:

*   Responsive keyboard with adequate key travel.
*   Reliable Bluetooth or smart connector connectivity.
*   Durable construction with protective materials.
*   slim and ergonomic design.

Now, all communication channels are closed. if someone could just **convey my side of the story**, she might at least understand what really happened—and why I acted the way I did. I truly believe she’d see that I never stopped loving her.

f you’re comfortable, I’d love for you to **visit her workplace** and, with complete calm and politeness, simply ask if she’s willing to hear a message from me.

We dated for less than six months when I, 22F, was 20 and he was 21. We broke up because I said that I didn't know if I wanted to have children and he said he'd rather break up with me then instead of risking that I don't change my mind and he'd break up with me in the future and hurt me more. That was in February of 2023. 

In July of 2023, he tried to get back with me and I told him no because I wanted to take time to work on myself and heal. He said that he felt like I didn't like him the way I said I did because I wouldn't take him back right away and because I invited him on 1 day trip to a nearby (not staying the night, just to go eat and see art exhibits and stuff). He said that if I liked him that I wouldn't have invited him at all because of the possibility that certain ""feelings"" would arise by being around him, I would have been willing to get back with him, and I would have ""laid in his chest"" in the relationship, which I get but that's also not how I operate. If I like you at all, I will invite you places. If I don't like you, I will ignore you, and I explained that to him. And he said that he would always feel like I didn't like him the way I said I did, and that rubbed me the wrong way. Because of I didn't, I wouldn't have gotten with him in the first place. I don't date people that I don't like.

 I also have issues with intimacy and closeness, and I explained that to him before we even got together, but he insisted he'd work through it. I was okay with hugs and things like that, but some stuff, like laying in his chest just made me feel awkward. I'm like that with everyone. I've been abused and have an avoidant attachment style and PTSD, so certain things trigger me. I told him that several times in our relationship too and he understood. I was okay with him touching me at times, but not always. He understood this.

Then, back in July of 2023, he throws all this stuff up as a way to manipulate me because I wouldn't give him his way, and I didn't appreciate that. He also told me that he was talking to other people then but wasn't taking anything serious with them in hopes that I would have taken him back. We got into a heated argument and he hung up the phone sounding like he was in distress.

 So, I called his phone several times and texted him out of concern and didn't answer for like three days, onky for him to tell me that he didn't answer because he didn't ""want to hear anything negative"" and that he didn't want me ""to tell him about anyone I was dating or interested in"" (which I never did). Really what it came down to was him being upset because I wasn't taking him back. Also, I never told him that j didn't want him back I said that I didn't want to date at the time and that I wanted to focus on myself. My mental health was bad and I was doing bad in engineering school. I wasn't even in therapy at the time. I didn't want to burden him with that because it felt like my problems were to a degree in our relationship. 

Now, for him to reach out to me, I just don't feel right about it. He asked how I was doing and if I wanted to meet up for coffee or lunch, and I told him that I was well and that I would have to let him know about a time for that. But I don't think I ever will meet up with him and I ay end up telling him that I'm not interested in being friends again or bf and gf. I'm just done. He got me fucked up.

* Tomorrow we're launching Mobile Makerpen!
* New props and invention search is now available in Rooms 2!
* No more competitive disadvantage for FBA players in PvP rooms (we disabled appendage collision)!

## Rooms 2

* Several props are now available in Rooms 2: Bell, Marker (Eraser), Bottle (Water), Disc, Coffee Mug, Coffee Pot, Bucket, Speaker, Concert Speaker, Dodgeball, Chair (Basic), and Table (Basic).
* You can now search for inventions in Rooms 2!
* Fixed issues that could lead to desynced object positions.
* Fixed an issue where a compound object could have different authorities for different parts of its hierarchy.

## Avatars

* New eye, eyebrow, and mouth sprites have been added!
* Full body players, you can now play Paintball, Laser Tag, etc. with no competitive disadvantage compared to bean players. We have turned off collisions on your arms, legs, and feet.
* Arms and wrists would sometimes get twisted up as you viewed your avatar. No more of that!

## Mobile MakerPen

* Later this week, we're launching a new beta version of the Maker Pen on mobile devices, designed to make creation more approachable, delightful, and streamlined! We're aiming to allow you to focus your attention on the creative process and less on the mechanics of tool selection and menu navigation. This is just the first release - we're still working on simplifying more of the Maker Pen features, but we wanted to prioritize what is used most like the movement and palette tools for this first version. You can also toggle back to the classic Maker Pen at any time. Make sure to let us know what you think on the creator forum!

## Circuits

* Added a new ""Projectile Hit Player (new)"" event in beta to both ranged weapon boards and the player board. This event is better than the old version at reliably detecting player hits in multiplayer contexts. With this version, you should no longer need to network between players for reliable hit detection. This will fire for all players if either the player getting hit or the player firing the gun detects that a projectile hits somebody.
* Added a new ""Global Projectile Hit Player"" event in beta that uses the same system as the above new event.
* The 'Rec Room Object Set Authority' chip will no longer error if the Target object is held but the input Authority is the same as the current Authority, resulting in no change.

## General Improvements & Bug Fixes

* We've improved visibility of your rooms by highlighting their Beta or Updated status in the Watch Menu.
* Added indicators and warnings for beta content in inventions.
* Tweaked some of the depth control settings for Place.
* Opening and closing your watch won't cause it to reset back to the Widget Watch home.
* Oculus Quest will now display a splash screen while loading the title screen. Players will now spend less time staring into the void.
* Fixed an issue with the bowling ball consistently making the rolling sound.
* Fixed trail effect on several explosive weapons to only be active when thrown.
* Removed tiled background from store items to make the thumbnails pop out more.

## Experiments

* Split test: Screen players can Give a held object and let another player Take it, without throwing it on the ground. It gets the job done! Look for it in the gesture radial menu.

1juvrac,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1juvrac/test_of_obedience/,Test of obedience,"I went to lunch with my wife (fairly nuanced) and dad (super TBM) today. When the waiter brought ours drinks (Diet Coke), my dad made a joke to my wife about how “back in the day, some considered caffeine to be against the word of wisdom”. I chimed in, and calmly stated how the WOW seems to be very arbitrary, and weirdly specific in mentioning coffee and tea (though not explicitly mentioned). I said IF the WOW is supposed to be lived in the “spirit of the law”, then eating healthy foods, working out, and overall making good health decisions should be “living the WOW”, even it includes drinking coffee (which “God” made via the coffee bean). However, if a TBM eats junk food, drinks energy drinks all day, doesn’t work out, is morbidly obese, eats all the meat they want, but abstains from coffee, tea, and alcohol, then they are “worthy” to enter the temple, and hence God’s presence. 

My reasoning must have been too much for my dad, as he got flustered and told me I shouldn’t let any of that bother me, and that I am thinking too much. He said the WOW is about obedience, and if we cannot be obedient in simple things like coffee and tea, then we cannot be worthy to be with God. 

My reply was that “one would have to believe in the church first in order to want to be obedient to the WOW” 

Conversation ended and my wife later told me it was awkward.  🫤

""The Buzzard, the Baldie, and the Barefoot Arrival 




Chapter One: The Arrival 
There was something unnatural about the sixth floor of Hangul Apartments. The lights flickered just a beat too long before stabilizing. The elevator made a sighing sound, as if resentful of being summoned. And then there was the couple in unit 6706—The Buzzard and The Baldie, unofficial rulers of the building’s unspoken law.

Buzzard—real name Byun Dae-sik—was a retired policeman who never quite retired from policing. He patrolled the hallways with a limp walkie-talkie, took photos of improperly parked bicycles, and once ticketed a delivery boy using a homemade citation. His neck was always craned forward like he was about to peck something. Or someone.

The Baldie—once known as Madame Eun-hee in her kitchen prime—had the piercing stare of a bald eagle and the mouth of a bitter Yelp reviewer. She’d once cooked for government officials, before a pregnancy, a cheating husband, and a missed opportunity at culinary stardom hardened her into the passive-aggressive vigilante she’d become.

Then came The Foreigner.

He moved into the apartment directly above them—a quiet man with a strange name they refused to pronounce. He walked softly, spoke rarely, and typed... enthusiastically. That, of course, was his first mistake.

The war began with subtleties. A ding-dong chime echoing from the ceiling at 6:13 a.m., sharp. A low humming sound, like a haunted air conditioner, that began exactly when he typed. Sometimes, he would hear soft, indecipherable murmurs through the walls—like a Bluetooth ghost giving orders.

He endured it. For a while.

Until one night, after staying up till 4 a.m. grading papers and nursing instant coffee, he awoke to a synthetic ding-dong-ding that wasn’t his phone.

He stepped into the living room and paused. That sound again. That fake air-con hum. It was back.

So he danced.

Barefoot. On hardwood.

He slammed his feet to a rhythm no one could follow. A jig of fury. An Irish stomp of vengeance. He twirled. He pounded. He cracked open a tin can filled with coins, shook it like maracas from hell, and howled a melody that made Buzzard knock three times from below—his version of a ceasefire request.

But the Foreigner wasn't done. Not yet.

1juvmcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/PantheonMMO/comments/1juvmcm/pvp_review_from_a_long_time_pvper/,PvP Review from a long time PvPer,"So a bit of a background first. I have a pretty extensive background in MMO PvP. From small scale, to massive scale fights. From open world to instanced. I ran a large guild in Archage, Black Desert, and GW2 that competed at a server level with top tier guilds. This isn't to brag, but to at least show my perspective on Pantheons existing PVP since release.

**The Good:**  
\- **It's fun:** It really is fun, when you have two guilds vying for control of an area of the map, and being able to push out other guilds camp farming. KOS lists being added in discord. Running into a rival guild alone and getting that ""oh shit I'm so screwed"" fear.  
\- **Its freeing:** It creates a new angle in the game. While some don't probably agree with the loot/currency dropping, it creates content to enjoy for those who want rewards from pvp effort. Its rare to find a game that properly rewards pvp effort in open world.  
\- **Class Variety:** Bit of a double edged blade here. But it allows some of the classes that maybe didn't accelerate as high solo in PvE or group play. And provided an outlet to shine.  


**The Bad:**  
\- **Crafting:** Becomes way too risky at the moment. If you're trying to craft without a group, odds are you're going to get instantly killed by a rogue or wizard hiding in the shadows. I've lost quite a few inventories of leather trying to get pieces built. So you have to accept you're going to lose stuff during this process. It doesn't feel great.  
\- **Bank Camping:** Kinda ties into the above. But people sitting around the bank waiting for someone to walk in or out assuming they just brought stuff to the bank or took stuff out of the bank.   
\- **No Actual Safe Zone:** There is zero safety. PvP needs at minimum a safe area. All time full on PvP makes it too difficult to navigate the more passive (not farming) content of the game.   
\- **Class Variety:** The other side of the same blade. Rogues, Wizards with true invis, will just absolutely annihilate 1v1 if they get the jump on someone. Since invis can't be detected at the moment, it puts every non invis class at a massive disadvantage. I get it, we probably wont see balancing of classes. But I think there are options we could explore for other classes to be able to counter the invis.  


**Summarized analysis:** It's not in a healthy spot right now. As someone who adores open world risky pvp, the way its currently implemented just won't work. You HAVE to create a safety net for people to at a minimum explore the content of a city without significant risk. This means banking, crafting, trading, sitting afk to get another coffee. Archeage had safety zones around respawns, certain zones, housing, and cities. Black Desert had guards and a full karma system, but you also didnt lose loot so the risk didn't ever make sense to really camp people in towns. DAOC had dedicated pvp zones and battlegrounds. You can very easily maintain GvG fights in the open world, and also allow players to have a safe spot to run home to after surviving in the wild. Bank slots are just too few to try to rush a bank, cram it all in, then tiptoe around with the minimum possible to craft. 

TLDR: It has so much potential to be a blast. But atm its in poor shape and needs love. I hope to see the dev team address some of this seeing as they pushed PvP out so fast in front of other major content desires from the community.",7,1744166730.0,PantheonMMO,7,0.7,False

I've been working in retail for a few years now, so I'm not new to how things are... but that doesn't make me feel any better. I've been followed into my job, I've been followed while working, I've been caught after clocking out ""just to talk."" and I've been followed to my car. Why are people so weird? I do my best not to get anxious about it, I go out o walks to calm my nerves because life goes on. BUT GOD.

At my last job I had to report my manager for insinuating he wanted to sleep with me, he literally followed me into a not busy part of the store and made a ""joke"" about how he'd love some company that night. Then *today* I talk with my older male coworker (simple greeting as I had just clocked in, he told me about something regarding his health and I wished him well) TELL ME WHY he then asks me out for coffee???? Then immediately tries to back peddle as soon as I show discomfort. I'm very babyfaced and while 23 I'm not into 60+ year old men wanting to get close to me. Like please, just leave me alone.

I'd report him, but it was only one comment... though I saw the signs as he's been trying to make more conversation lately... I still won't. I've already reported two customers for being weird, I'd hate for my credibility to be ruined or for me to be seen as ""dramatic."" I know that shouldn't be the case, because if I'm uncomfortable about someone's romantic/sexual advances- I should feel safe in telling someone about it. But I don't. Again, I've only been at this current job for a few months, and I don't want my managers to see me as someone who's dramatic. I'm a hard worker, as kind and pleasant as I can be, I cherish my reputation as it often is what people are drawn to before they appreciate me for my personality. So I don't know... if he does anything big then I'll report him.

Long-time lurker here. I just finished my CompTIA gauntlet (A+, Net+, Sec+, CySA+, Pentest+, CASP+) and wanted to share something that literally saved my sanity during this process.

As someone with ADHD, staring at the mountain of dry technical content was absolute torture. My brain would constantly zone out, I'd read the same paragraph five times, and I felt like I was getting nowhere despite the hours put in.

**The game-changer?(lol) Turning the whole thing into an actual game.**

Here's how I gamified my cert studies:

# 1. Experience Points System

I created a simple XP system where:

* Each practice question = 1 XP
* Each correct answer = 3 XP
* Each hour of study = 10 XP
* Each practice test completed = 50 XP

I tracked this in a simple spreadsheet and set ""levels"" for myself (Level 1 = 100 XP, Level 2 = 250 XP, etc.) with rewards at each level. The constant progression gave my brain that dopamine hit it needed.

# 2. Achievement Unlocks

I created ""achievements"" for myself like:

* ""Perfect Section"" - Score 100% on a practice test section
* ""Marathon"" - Study for 3 hours straight
* ""Comeback Kid"" - Improve a weak domain score by 20%
* ""Early Bird"" - Complete a study session before 9am

Each achievement had a small reward (a coffee shop trip, 30 minutes of guilt-free gaming, etc.)

# 3. ""Boss Fights""

I treated each major domain as a ""boss"" I needed to defeat. Before moving on to the next domain, I had to ""defeat the boss"" by scoring at least 85% on that section's questions.

# 4. Visual Progress Tracker

I printed out a visual ""map"" of my certification journey with checkpoints. Physically coloring in my progress was incredibly satisfying for my ADHD brain - made the abstract progress concrete.

# 5. Competitive Element

I found a study buddy and we competed on practice test scores, creating our own leaderboard. The social accountability was huge.

# 6. Random Rewards

I put study rewards in envelopes (ranging from ""5-minute break"" to ""order takeout tonight"") and would randomly draw one after completing study milestones. The unpredictability was motivating.

# Results

Using these methods, my study time became genuinely engaging. I found myself actually WANTING to study because the gamification hijacked my brain's reward system in a good way. I think if you enjoy video games or just struggle with staying focused, give this a try.

The system worked so well for me and am so conviced by it that I actually built a small web and iOS app purely from my passion that formalizes this approach with proper XP tracking, achievements, and 1000+ practice questions for each CompTIA cert I took-- [CertGames](https://certgames.com).  Although, you can do this on your own with just some spreadsheets and creativity.

This is a long story but I want to make it short.

I met this guy last year in April in the library and we opened up a lot, very fast. He eventually introduced me to a lot of his friends and family and we talked more (started going to his church). He's one of those very argumentative guys who has strong beliefs and rarely negotiates (loves to debate types and laugh at you for not agreeing with him). I didn't see this side of him until things settled down.

I gave him a lot of advice regarding girls and career stuff etc. I came to him for advice like once regarding a job interview I had even though he doesn't have experience with interviews (he works at a movie theatre and I work in a high rise office. im not putting him down when I say this for your information but he hints at wishing he could do my type of job). The other day, the topic of politics came up and he mentioned how he is a republican and asked what I support and I said democrat. He said he guessed its probably because my father was a democrat and I said yes, partially but not entirely because of my father. He laughed and said how much (in terms of influence) ? I said I wouldn't quantify it and then he said ok ""I'm gonna assume a lot"" and started to tell me about how everything ive agreed with is basically what republicans support. it sounded like he was trying to convince me, subtly - even started telling me to go read more on DJT and what he stands for and to not listen to media's that destroy his reputation.

The next day, over text, I addressed the part where he assumed im solely a democrat because of my father and said ""Hey Charles, I didn’t appreciate how you tried boxing me in yesterday when you said you believe the reason I’m liberal is solely due to my father after I told you I didn’t want to go into politics. An apology will suffice"". This sparked conflict and asked me to meet him in person which I did. But he sent this before we met that evening when we went back and forth :

""Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I’m looking forward to taking about what you didn’t like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I’ll hit u up for next time. I’m looking forward to it.""

I ended up going to meet. I bought us both coffee at Starbucks and sat on a couch with him. In person, he insulted my character, raised his voice and said I only asked him to apologize because I have low self esteem and low confidence and how I want to bring him down to my level by forcing an apology and submit, how he doesn't trust me, how I love to argue, how controlling I am etc. I told him he's wrong about me and im not doing that and even mentioned the things ive done for him that were in his best interest like uplift him (not to come off as bragging but to dismantle his argument and show him my perspective).

After he left. I sent him this :

I don’t feel bad about myself Charles nor do I have low self esteem. I'm ok the way I am, Charles even much better than others

This apology thing bothered you that much, to the point where you began insulting me and throwing all kinds of bad words in my direction. 

People do things in their life, sometimes bad sometimes good, even you joke about it when it happens. 

But you took it seriously today (even the texting) and threw unnecessary bad words against my character. Non stop.

I’m not interested in ever being friends after this. I don’t deserve this type of treatment and disrespect. Ciao for now"".

Its been almost 9 weeks of no contact and i've stopped going to that specific church (I get texts from people at church saying they miss me and asking if everything is alright but I just say ive been busy with work and school stuff to avoid drama). When he sees me in passing he just nods my head or actually gives me a pound with his fist and says ""hey what's up Adam"". AITA ?

Also, if he ever comes up to me to try to ""talk"", what should I do/say? Ive completely ceased contact with the entire group.",4,1744166318.0,AITAH,5,0.83,False

In more recent events, as of last year, I got mistaken for the same person (I presume). I was out with my Mom and I was going into a Smoothie King (which was across the street from a Starbucks). A lady pulled into the Smoothie King, and she asked if I was at Starbucks. I told her I wasn't at Starbucks as I don't drink coffee.

I'm a fairly new reddit user so pardon if I make any mistakes. I'm a 31 year old woman, today is my birthday in fact! :) I've been a little reflexive the last few weeks coming up to this day, just thinking about my life. All of my friends criticize the way I eat, one of them got as far as to say I have an ED. My father is insufferable about it. Can you give me an outsider's perspective?

Let me preface this by saying that just like most women, I've spent large chunks of my life trying to prevent my perfectly normal body to grow. Just dieting, that is. Diet culture. I was born in the 90s, so that meant magazines with Drew Barrymore in low waist jeans on the cover. I'll not go into all and each of the stupid s\*\* I did to stay thin, but I don't even think I went farther than the average teenage girl tbh. The last few years of my life, my body and mind seem to have found peace with each other when I stay away from carbohydrates and I eat very, very lean. And the thing is, I just don't eat much. There's not much to say, usually I make two meals. I'll have an egg sandwich with coffee for 'brunch', I eat some chocolate as desert sometimes. At night I'll have a proper meal. Chicken fillet, whole grain rice and some lettuce are my favorite. This is easy for me because I can eat fresh, healthy food without cooking too much. I don't care at all for fruits, but I do force myself to eat one at least twice in one week. I will concede that I have flaws and I can imagine that a nutritionist would be appalled, but if I'm not passing out (I feel just fine, in fact), am I really dying like it seems to be suggested? I'm a small woman and a little pale, so I don't know, you might not think of vitality when you look at me. Sure won't find me running a marathon anytime soon. But if I don't feel hungry do I need to eat? Isn't intermittent fasting a thing? Those guys eat just like I do!

I've been taking vitamin suplements and iron tablets also.

1juvejm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1juvejm/disappearer/,Disappearer,"Need to vent a little. I saw a guy on/off casually for about a year, it was nice although neither of us wanted a relationship. He recently moved back to his home country/city which I was visiting about 6 months ago. A month or so before I went I messaged him and he said he was excited to me to visit and we should meet up/hang out. I was looking forward to seeing him but then when I arrived my messages wouldn't deliver, I thought maybe he had blocked me? I was a little disappointed but whatever. 

Fast forward a couple months and I receive a messag out of the blue like 'hey when are you visiting??'. I replied  saying I had already, and he seemed confused and like he genuinely didn't understand why my messages delivered and it was all a mistake. He apologised and even gave me other socials etc ''in case it happened again'. Anyway about a month ago I was in his city again, and this time we planned to meet and he even kept checking in about when I was supposed to arrive. 

We met for coffee - it was quite fleeting but very nice (I thought) and we said we would meet again in the coming days. Then in the midst of arranging that, he stopped replying completely. My messages delivered this time, and I even sent a double message just saying bye and that I was leaving the city, no reply. 

I guess it's just my pride but I don't really get it. Now I'm thinking maybe he did genuinely block me that first time? When we met for coffee he did explain to me that he was looking for a relationship now and dating seriously. So I don't know if that has something to do with it. But I can't help but feel a bit annoyed, we're both adults I don't know what could be the issue with communicating? Especially since we did see eachother for a little bit and have an existing relationship and, I thought, mutual respect. Were not in a relationship or anything, it would have been fine for him to tell me he doesn't feel like meeting again. But to hype up me coming and meeting and doing things and then disappear is...strange. Or maybe it's not that strange and just some rendition of good old ghosting.

I am anticipating him popping up again at some point, as he usually does that, probably when he's in my city again. If and when he does I'll expect an explanation. If he doesn't it's probably for the best. ",6,1744166034.0,dating,3,1.0,False

Denali 45L backpack
Nature hike cloud up 2 tent 
Home made pillow which is a stuff sack with memory foam in it
Neve waratah -2deg quilt
Nemo tensor all season reg wide mat - the mat and the quilt were where I dropped the most money, but I'm a grown up now and I'd like to be comfy, plus wanted gear I can use year round

Jetboil stove (a gift that gave me the idea to buy everything else)
Katadyn be free 1l plus 2 spare 1l bottles
7 dehydrated meals I made at home (oatmeal breakfasts, bean and veg chilli, lentil dal with broccoli)
Museli bars,mi goreng, dried fruit
Coffee teabags
A spoon 

Nothing special in the clothing department - some long sleeves to sleep in and for sun protection, shorts, trail run shoes that I regularly run in, sunnies and a hat. Kathmandu puffer jacket

Toothbrush, panadol, bandaids, 80% deet, compression bandage, sunscreen, hand sanitizer, soap, tp.

Camera, kindle, earbuds, lighter, 2g of quality cannabis, papers.

All up the bag weighs 10kg without water, pretty happy with that but I know I could cut down weight with a better tent and backpack, and lightweight clothes. Anything I forgot?

Also reflecting on doing the things you're afraid of because these things help us grow.

That said, opening myself up to date again even though the dating scene feels scary and andaming mga tao na mangugulo lang sa buhay mo hahahah iykyk but I remain hopeful. Serious dating po and not ung laro laro lang. My heart can't take anymore chz. Patunayan nyong may matitino pang lalaki dito HAHAHA.

I can date out with myself naman but gusto ko naman sana may kasama na next time.. and also sa ibang ganap sa buhay diba.

Im looking for someone I can share my day with and can reciprocate the energy I give. It's also great to have shared hobbies but im also looking for someone complimentary sakin. Like if personality wise, gusto ko madaldal or mas madaldal sakin kasi overwhelming sakin if ako lang nagyyap. Always striving to be a better person everyday, hopefully, ikaw din. Ultimately, I want someone who will choose to build a connection with me. Walang pilitan hahahah

I (26M) got invited to an old friend's wedding at the end of the summer. I've never been to a wedding before, and would love to see and celebrate with him. Thing is, I have a bit of trouble with...being social. Like, sitting alone in a busy coffee shop for 10 minutes is really hard for me, and a big event like a wedding is a little bit intimidating. I wouldn't know anyone there except the groom, and don't really have anyone I could ask to go with me. I would love some advice on what to expect if I do go- obviously all weddings are gonna be different, but broad strokes here. Is it not worth going if I don't know anyone? Apart from the actual marrying part...what else happens? I hear there are dancing at these things- can this be avoided? If I end up having a hard time and need to quietly leave in the middle, is that going to cause an issue or embarrass anyone? Would it be better to just celebrate later with my friend and his wife, or is it important to be at the actual event itself? Thanks in advance!",1,1744165440.0,Advice,2,0.67,False

Detective Gary Garcia examined the body suspended over the bed. It was cut into layers, like a matryoshka doll that opened longways instead of in the middle. The only thing untouched by the killer’s knife was the respiratory system, which was partly encased in a plastic shell.

Detective Garcia’s partner, Luke Lee, observed the body with professional detachment.

“It looks…” began Lee.

*Like art*, finished detective Garcia in his head. The sliced layers were suspended perfectly by wire so they lay over each other to create a seamless impression of the body pre-cut. The victim had been beautiful in life, and the killer had allowed her to remain so in death. The topmost layer, which held her face, looked serene, and the particular care and preservation in the chest area made it look as if she could still be breathing, softly, *Like a lover in repose.*

And then there was the rest.

The layers of exposed viscera. It evoked something in Garcia, that’s how he knew it was art. *The contrast*. The beautiful with the ugly. The face and the person, with the clockwork and biological machinery, exposed for all to see.

“It looks… ,” said Lee, finishing his thought, “ …like there’s webbing between the layers.”

Garcia looked over the corpse again.

“You mean the wires holding the layers  up?” asked Garcia, pointing at a translucent wire that held up the back of the victim’s foot, going up through several bones, and exiting out of one of the middle toes.

“No,” said Lee, pointing at the empty space between the layers.

Garcia tilted his head, and caught something in the light.

“I see it,” said Garcia.

Between each layer was a fine webbing, finer than spider’s silk.

“Good eye,” said Garcia. Even after a decade of working together, he was still amazed by Lee’s powers of perception. “I know it exists and I can still barely see it, how did you spot it in the first place? More importantly, what do you think it is?”

The thin detective Luke Lee scratched his scruff.

“I don’t know…” he said. “Maybe… no that’s dumb…”

“Out with it,” said the burlier Garcia. “What’s  your gut telling you?”

“I don’t know what it is, but… if I didn’t know any better, I’d say they were veins.”

Garcia tilted his head, and tried to catch more of the fine network of silk-like fibers. There was, he admitted, a sort of method to the seemingly random nature of them. They seemed concentrated most around the inner organs, and between the layers of skin. Now that he saw that they essentially connected everything together, he wondered how he missed them at all. Indeed, they seemed to be connecting the disparate parts of the victim.

“Fuck me,” said Garcia. “They do look like veins.”

“They can’t be though,” said Lee.

“Or could they? Let’s see what the lab boys have to say.”

Garcia called for a member of the forensics team and asked for a set of glass slides. He pinched a section of the fibers between them, handing them back to the forensics member, asking him and his team to find out what the fibers were. The forensics member took the sample, and rejoined his team.

“What do we think for time of death?” asked Lee, preparing an onsite autopsy form.

Garcia looked at his partner, and then at the body. *Time of death?* It was surprisingly difficult to say. The victim’s family had said that she had stopped responding to texts and messages approximately three days ago, after a night out with friends. The victim went radio silent for the rest of the weekend. They hadn’t thought it was too unusual until a relative that worked in the same office as the victim noticed that she had failed to show up for work on monday without so much as a sick call. That’s when alarm bells started going off. The family asked for a wellness check that morning, and what the police officer found in the victim’s apartment was what led to Lee and Garcia being called in. That left a window of nearly seventy-two full hours. Enough time for advanced signs of decomposition to begin to set in, especially as it was the middle of summer. However, as it was, the body had not even begun to smell. Which didn’t make sense. The butchery– though Garcia struggled to think of it as that –of the body would have taken hours alone. Plenty of time for decomposition to set in.

“Put it down as indeterminable,” said Garcia.

“Hmm,” hummed Lee.

“You don’t agree?” asked Garcia, turning to his partner, seeing his eyes narrowed in concentration.

“It’s not that I *disagree*,” said his partner. “I just have a thought is all. It’s the middle of summer.”

“Right.”

“There’s no detectable odor.”

“Right again.”

“And in this heat there would have been in a matter of hours. And look here.”

Lee pointed at the seams of the victim’s skin, where the two largest halves of the matryoshka-like cuts would have met. There was scabbing. *Signs of healing*.

Garcia was struck dumb.

“There’s no way,” said Garcia. “There’s really no way. That would mean…”

“She could have been alive this morning…”

“In this state? Impossible. Unless you’re saying the killer somehow sliced her up and strung her up like this in minutes, a half hour tops before the officer who came to check on her stopped by… no there’s no way.”

“I’m just saying, it looks like she was alive until *very* recently.”

Garcia just shook his head.

“There’s something else,” said Lee. “Squint your eyes, and look at the body. Tell me what you see. Or rather, tell me what you don’t.”

Garcia arched an eyebrow at his partner, then did as he asked. He squinted his eyes and then looked at the body. He didn’t see anything. But of course, he realized, that’s exactly what Lee was getting at.

You see there was a classic trick that detectives and members of forensics pulled when examining a body. Squinting at it to better distinct the different hues of it, to see where the blood had pooled. Even in deaths caused by heavy blood loss the remaining blood would noticeably pool within the body. As it happened, there was no pooled blood in the victim’s body, and the corpse lacked that distinct paleness that came with a body purposefully drained, as they sometimes were, like pigs.

“Shit,” said Garcia. “She’s fresh. *Really* fresh.”

Lee nodded.

“Not enough time for the blood to pool even,” he said. “What do you want me to jot down for time of death then?”

“Put it down for early this morning,” said Garcia, not able to believe what he was saying, or seeing.

Lee nodded again, writing their conclusion on the form. He then tapped his pen on the next line of the form.

“Apparent cause of death?” he asked Garcia.

“Indeterminable,” said Garcia– which was comical looking at the state of the victim, but if she had been alive this morning, then, miraculously, it hadn’t been the cutting that killed her.

This time Lee didn’t disagree. Until a proper autopsy was performed, there would be no official cause of death.

With the onsite autopsy done, Garcia took in the body again. He had trouble tearing his eyes away from it. The body– the woman –was both grotesque and horrendously beautiful. The way the top layer of her rested seamlessly on top of the rest, so that her pale, almost luminescent breasts, shone beneath the gray overcast light of day. The killer had strung her up over her bed and left the window open. It was a wonder that no one from the apartment complex across the street had seen her– it was a tall building –Garcia imagined at a certain floor someone would have had the perfect view of her.

Garcia’s pulse quickened, suddenly he noticed his partner staring at him, and realized that he had been entranced with the body for too long. He tried to think of an excuse as to why, but couldn’t think of anything. It was in the middle of this panicked thinking, that someone came up to talk to the detectives.

“Excuse me, detectives,” said the same member of forensics that was helping them earlier. “We’re just about packing up now, wanted to let you know in case you needed anything else from us before we go.”

“We don’t need anything else at this time,” said Garcia. “Did you find anything interesting? Something to point us in the right direction?”

The forensics member nodded his head.

“Yes, we were able to reasonably conclude that there was no sign of forced entry.”

“So it was someone she knew?” said Lee, turning to Garcia.

“Probably. Almost always is,” commented Garcia.

Garcia and Lee left soon after, with Garcia taking the body in one final time before he closed the door. It left him with an ugly feeling. He felt a wave of nauseating revulsion toward himself.

Garcia was still thinking about the body hours later, when he and Lee were at their desks, making phone calls, arranging interviews, waiting for the body boys to give them a cause of death. At some point, in between calls, a member of forensics dropped off a manila envelope with pictures of the scene in it. Garcia opened the envelope out of instinct, rote and mechanical. If he had been thinking, or been aware of what he was doing, he might not have decided to open it, because he would have been afraid of exactly what happened. And what happened is that he became transfixed.

Garcia hadn’t stopped thinking about the body. It lingered on in the back of his mind, even as he spoke to the victims family and friends to arrange interviews, all he could think about was how beautiful she had appeared hanging over her bed. *Like a lover in repose*. So when he laid eyes on the scene of the crime once again he became re-enamored with the body. He could almost imagine the victim’s chest rising and falling, serenely luminescent, like moonlit marble. It was almost enough to send his heart aflutter.

*You’re sick*, he thought*, real fucken sick*.

“What do you see?” asked Lee from behind Gracia shoulder, causing him to jump inside his skin.

Garcia hoped he didn’t look like he needed new pants. He also smelled coffee, and sure enough when he turned his seat, he saw that Lee had a piping hot cup of probably old coffee from the precinct pot.

“It’s nothing,” said Garcia, not wanting to say what he was thinking out loud.

“It’s not nothing,” said his partner. “It’s something, a big something. I’m sure of it.”

“It really isn’t.”

His partner sighed, and leaned on his desk.

“Gary,” he said, full stop. “We’ve been partners for how long? I can’t even remember–” *Ten years, but who’s counting?*. “ –You have a way of getting into those sickos’s heads.”

*Because I am one of those Sickos,* he thought.

“What’s your point?” asked Garcia.

“My point is you got that anxious look on your face. The one that shows up when you really get in a killer’s head.”

Garcia took another look at the photo in his hands. The wires holding her up didn’t show on the photo, so it looked like she was floating.

“It almost looks like she’s breathing… like… a woman you just slept with, y’know, someone beside you. The way the body was arranged… I think that was intentional, like the killer, in their own fucked up way, had been in love with her.”

Lee considered the photo and then shot a sideways glance at Garcia. For a quick, and yet still too long second, Garcia agonized over what Lee would say. A second longer, and Garcia broke the silence himself.

“It’s art,” he said, quick;y adding “in a fucked up kind of way, I think that’s what the killer was going for.”

Lee nodded, seeming to consider Garcia’s statement. Then, after taking a sip of his coffee, started them on a new track of thought.

“Circling back to possible suspects. Forensics says there was no sign of forced entry, meaning it was probably someone she knew. Rolling with your interpretation of the state of the victim, wouldn’t it be likely that it was a boyfriend or lover?”

Garcia touched his nose to his steepled hands.

“Interviews are already set up. We’ll ask about a boyfriend then,” said Garcia. “Any news from the body boys about the fibers? Or anything at all?”

“Nope. They weren’t able to identify the fibers. They’re sending them to a specialist. They think they might have a cause of death already, but they didn’t want to say what they think it might be, they want to rule out a few things first.”

“Did they say why?”

“Some of their ideas were ‘outlandish’,” said Lee. “Their words, not mine.”

Garcia let out a noise that was somewhere between a snort, a chuckle, and a grunt. *It’s an outlandish case!*

A few days and several interviews later they had come up short. Not only had the victim not had a boyfriend at the time of death, she had reportedly, according to her family and close co-workers, identified as both asexual, and aromantic, never having had a romantic partner in her entire life. That wasn’t a death knell per se, but it killed the one thing that Garcia and Lee had resembling a lead in the case, especially as interviewing the victim’s inner, and even outer, circle had yielded no other possible suspects. The friends she’d been out with on the weekend that she disappeared had perfect alibis, corroborated by their phone activity.

The case stalled for a matter of weeks. In that time the body had been taken, and prepared for a closed casket. The fibers still hadn’t been identified, probably they hadn’t been looked at yet, specialists of any kind that help the police always had more on their plate than they could handle, so it could be some time before they heard anything back at all. But they had heard back from the body boys. Garcia had been glad to finally have the report, but when Lee read it for the both of them, he couldn’t believe what he was hearing.

“You’re shitting me,” Garcia had said.

“I wish I were, but that’s what the file says,” Lee had said, holding a large envelope with the body boy’s report.

The cause of death? Dehydration.

“Shock, blood loss, organ failure, anything that would have made *sense*,” said Garcia. “You’re sure you heard them right Lee?”

Lee only nodded.

Later, when Garcia was at his desk reflecting on the strange case, he was once again gazing into the photograph of the victim. She hung there in the picture, beautifully, ethereally. Was she the first? Were there others? Was she the last and only? That last thought shot a queasy dread up his spine, and he had to ask himself an uncomfortable question, or rather, the uncomfortable question arose but he did not ask it. He was scared of the answer.

Suddenly, a voice called to him from a distant elsewhere that Garcia was surprised to find that he inhabited as well.

“Another body was found,” said the voice of his partner.

A pulse of exhilaration went up Garcia’s spine, quickly followed by a wave of disgust, mostly at himself. They had a number of cases open, that’s just police work, but Garcia knew which case his partner was referring to.

“Let’s go,” he replied, and so they did.

The scene of the second killing was a studio apartment that lived up to the name. There were storyboards hanging on the wall, art, and prints. The victim, a  young man, had been stripped naked, seated at his drawing desk, appearing as a posed model, or sculpted statue. Unlike the first victim, which had been fully sectioned, the young man only had his hand dissected. Its layers pulled and revealed like a rough sketch in an anatomy book.

The young man had been wiry and skinny, but the killer had posed him in such a way as to make him appear elegant, lean instead of thin, thoughtful instead of lost. Like the first victim there was a certain beauty to the young man, an elegance that was only rivaled by drawings which piled dotted the sheets of paper on his desk, and on the floor. Piles and piles of drawings. They were naturalistic drawings, of people, animals, and plants, they seemed realer than real, capturing the very essence of the subject. Each drawing was small, as if the artist had had a limited range of motion, and indeed, looking at the dissected hand, if the killer had preserved the artist’s ability to draw, then it would have not been able to move very much, especially considering the ad hoc pine architecture that had been placed to hold the hand and its layers up.

Still taking in the sight, Garcia wondered if “young” was the right word for the man. The spartan like decoration– that is to say, lack thereof –in the apartment, and the build of the man, had given Garcia the impression of youth, but looking closer at the body he wasn’t sure. The man had deep wrinkles in some places, like his skin had shriveled up, and deep crows feet around his eyes as well.

Lee, who had also been examining the body, made a clicking sound with his tongue, and turned away from it.

“What is it?” asked Garcia.

“The victim, he died of dehydration, I’m sure of it,” said Lee. He turned so he was facing Garcia again. “The wrinkles around the victim’s eyes aren’t crows feet, nor I suspect, will we find that the victim was all that old. All those wrinkles are signs of his body thirsting for water. Right now it’s just speculation, but if it’s the same killer as the woman hung over he bed, I’d bet good money that the monster who did what they did to the sleeping woman, was also responsible for what happened to this man. And look.” Garcia fished out a slide from his pocket, seemingly capturing empty air between the layers of the dead man’s hands. Garcia watched this with some amount of curiosity, though he suspected he knew what his partner was about to show him.

Lee closed the slide with a small band, and handed it to Garcia, who saw right away what it was supposed to be. In  between the slide, were the same fibers that they had found in between each layer of the first victim.

The pair of detectives went through and did a full on site examination of the body. Afterwards they aided the forensics team in scouring the small apartment for evidence, and once again found that there appeared to be no evidence of forced entry.

If the victims knew the killer, then there would be a link between the two, so it looked like another round of interviews for Garcia and Lee with the first victims friends and family, as well as whoever they could speak to concerning the second victim. This is how they spent the next few days. Though as it would turn out, there was no connection between the first and second victim, and it would seem that the artist had not only lived spartan, but lonely as well. He had no friends to speak of, something that Lee remarked was not uncommon in modern young men. The closest thing they had resembling to a lead after their first round of interviews came from the second victim’s mother, who mentioned that he had been excited for a lunch meeting with a client, who according to the timing, might have been the last person to see the artist alive.

Lee and Garcia arranged to meet with the client, whose name they found through the artist's social media pages. He had been commissioned by a commercial lab named Plant Projects, and had met with one of their scientists over lunch to discuss the work they wanted for him.

“Sounds like something they could have done over email,” said Garcia.

“That’s how those business types are,” said Lee as they entered the lab’s building. “Meetings, meetings… meetings.”

The inside of the building, the parts after the front desk and first hallway, were a hot humid environment that were lit mostly with UV lights.

Hunkering in the dank dungeon of UV light were people in lab coats snipping at, brushing, and measuring– in one way or another –plants. The only person in a lab coat not attending to any plants, or to anything really, was the person they were there to interview. He was sitting at a table that appeared to have been cleared away for them to meet at. On his breast was a metal name badge that read: *Director of Mycology, Anthony Okawa*.

“Good evening Mr. Okawa. I’m detective Gary Garcia, and this is my partner.”

“Luke Lee,” said his partner.

“Good evening,” said Okawa, with practiced courteousness.

“As I’m sure you’ve been told, we were made aware that you were the last person to see a certain artist alive, and were hoping to ask you any questions regarding how he appeared when you saw him.”

“Oh my,” said Okawa, open mouthed, gawking at the detectives. Like his courteousness, there was a practiced, performative air to his exasperation.

“I’m sorry, were you close?” asked Garcia, with a cocked eyebrow. He found Okawa’s open mouthed shock to be a bit much.

“No, not particularly, but I did just see him alive only last week. I’m not sure *how* I feel. I didn’t know him, but I saw him, talked to him, ate with him. And now you tell me he’s dead. It's just… it’s shocking I suppose.”

Something about Okawa’s answer felt off to Garcia, though he couldn’t say why.

“I see,” said Garcia, still wondering what was so unsettling about Okawa. “Do you mind if we start with the questions?”

“Of course, go ahead, have a seat.”

Garcia and Lee took a seat opposite of Okawa on the empty workspace.

Garcia started them off.

“Just for the sake of record, the victim was working for you, correct?”

“Not for *me* exactly, but for the company I work with, I was just the one that hashed out the details with him regarding his work.”

“And what was that work exactly?”

“Drawings, for some of our new crossbreeds. Artistic renditions can be better for accentuating unique characteristics that may not be as prominent in photos.”

“Did you know the victim before he was commissioned for your company’s work?”

“Yes and no. I knew of him from an art profile I saw online. I was a fan of his work and so it was me who recommended him for the job. His ability to capture nature in his art was quite amazing. Perchance did you have an opportunity to see his work?” Here Okawa began to talk with his hands. That’s when Garcia understood what had unsettled him before. That moment, where Okawa began to talk with his hands, that wasn’t an act, but the moments leading up to it were, a very practiced one. Okawa was the kind of man that always wore a mask, even in the most mundane situations.

“We did,” said Garcia. “It was indeed impressive work.”

“I’m glad you think so. Yes, so, I was a fan, then I met him, and now he’s dead, it’s… a bit much. I’m not sure how I should feel.”

“That’s fair,” said Garcia. “As far as your last meeting with him, was this another discussion about his commission over lunch?”

“Technically speaking yes, though most of the details had already been hashed out. I’m embarrassed to admit it was mostly so I could spend more time with him. As I said I was a huge fan.”

Garcia laughed with a grunt.

“Did the victim seem off to you in your last meeting? Did he seem anxious or worried?”

Okawa seemed to search the detective’s faces.

“No detectives, he didn't appear overly anxious to me, or scared. He seemed perfectly normal.”

“I see, thank you,” said Garcia, preparing to write something down. “Around when did your lunch with Thomas begin and end?”

Okawa put a hand to his chin.

“It’s okay if you don’t remember exactly,” said Garcia. “A rough time will do.”

“Hmm,” hummed Okawa. “Sometimes around noon, and I kept him probably longer than I should have, possibly until around one or just after.”

Garcia wrote the time down for the sake of good record keeping, and shot a glance at his partner.

“I don’t have any further questions. Lee?”

“Just the one,” said Lee, stone faced.

“By all means detective,” said Okawa.

“What is it you do here?”

Okawa seemed genuinely perplexed by the question.

“As I mentioned I’m really more of an assistant for the folks here who work on the plants. It’s not very exciting,” said Okawa.

“Yes, I’m sure,” said Lee. “But just humour us.”

Okawa cleared his throat, and looked at Garcia, as if to say *“can you believe this man?”*. Garcia for one, enjoyed watching his partner work.

“What? you want me to tell you about my morning routine?”

“If you have to, to get to the exact details of your work.”

Okawa grinned, letting out a stifled chuckle.

“The work I do here isn’t something I can talk about with just anyone.” Okawa cleared his throat. “If that’s all detectives I should get back to helping the other researchers.”

“Thank you for your time,” said Lee, shaking the man’s hands.

Garcia and Lee said farewell to the scientist. Garcia began to leave, but noticed that Lee had not yet begun to move. The energy after the farewell grew somewhat awkward, and that’s when Okawa suddenly realized that he had to go to a different part of the building. Only when Okawa had left, did Lee turn to leave with his partner. Garcia was just about to ask why Lee had suddenly decided to ask Okawa about his work, when Lee stopped to ask a pair of scientists they passed the same question.

“What are you guys doing there?” asked Lee as he and Garcia passed by a working pair of scientists.

The scientists were a male and female pair. They smiled at each before replying.

“We’re working on increasing the growth rates of a new superfood we’re developing. Can’t say much more than that.”

“Hm, very interesting,” said Lee, nodding. “Say do you know what Okawa works on specifically?”

The female scientist spoke up first.

“He helps us with some of the stop gaps in our research, namely addressing our plant’s abilities to take in nutrients from the ground. I thought it was going well, but he cleared out his experiments from the table top earlier, must be prepping a new batch.”

“Actually he just wanted to give his mycelium some darkness,” said the male. “I saw him moving stuff around and asked why. I didn’t know mycelium needed darkness, but hey, I’m not the fungus guy.”

“Huh,” said the female scientist.

“I'm sorry,” said Lee, “mycelium?”

“It’s how he’s helping our plants absorb nutrients out of the ground faster,” said the female scientist. “They act sort of like veins that suck up nutrients from the dirt.”

“That is very interesting,” said Lee, smiling.

“We could say more, but you should probably ask Okawa, he loves talking about his fungus.”

“I see,” said Lee, shooting a glance at Garcia who was half in half out of the lab.

Lee smiled and bid the pair farewell, joining Garcia who was hallway out to the hallway waiting for him. “One last question, were you two here when Okawa went out to lunch with that artist?”

“The one we hired to do the sketches for our journal submission, yeah, Okawa was stoked. Apparently we hired him on his rec.”

“Around what time would you say he got back?”

“Oh, we lost him for the day, didn’t come back to the lab until the day after,” the scientist shook his head and smiled.

“Very interesting,” said Lee, “Thanks for the information, you two have a nice day.”

Lee turned away from the pair, and joined Garcia in the hallway outside the lab.

“Partner?” asked Garcia.

“What?”

“What was that about? With the pair just now?”

“Following a bit of intuition,” said Lee as they walked through the long hallway, gazing into the middle distance.

“Alright what did you see?”

“I’m not sure. Probably nothing.”

“Spill,” grunted Garcia, “I’m curious now, plain and simple.”

Lee let out a bit of air from his nostrils, and it was something like a huff and a laugh.

“His desk,” said Lee, adding nothing else.

“What about it?”

“His desk was empty, unlike the other workstations in the lab. That’s assuming it was a workstation, and that it was his. I was planning on asking the pair, but they told me without me having to ask. He was also dodging the question about his work. Work he said was too sensitive to mention at all, and yet the pair just now didn’t seem to think much about spilling the beans on that. I can’t say why, I just got a weird vibe from the guy, thought he was lying for some reason, so I asked about the lunch he had with the artist, and again. Okawa said he was out with the artist for an hour, but the pair back there said they lost him for a day. Something’s off.”

Garcia stopped and looked at his partner.

“It’s not nothing,” he said. “I got a weird feeling from him too.”

“Acting suspicious around the police isn’t anything new, nerves will do that to someone, but… this Okawa guy seems more off than that.”

“I agree,” said Garcia. “Extremely off.”

“Maybe something, maybe nothing.”

“Maybe something, yeah,” echoed Garcia. “What do you want to do?”

“I’d like to tail the guy for a bit, just for some peace of mind.”

“Alright, let's set up across the street.”

“No, Garcia, It’s just a feeling, nothing concrete, I’ll do it alone. Besides, results for those fibers were supposed to be back today. I’d like for one of us to start working on whether those fibers are relevant to the case or not.”

“Good call,” said Garcia. “I’d be lost without you deducing the world for me, partner.”

“Hmph,” let out Lee. “And I couldn’t trust my deduction without your gut instinct. If I think it, sometimes you just know it, and it puts me at ease. Later partner.”

“Heh,” let out Garcia. “Later.”

And they parted.

Once he was back at the precinct, Garcia went straight for the body boys’s office.

“Detective Garcia,” said one of the body boys, greeting him.

“Evening, Lee told me you would have something about the fibers for me today.”

The body boy he was speaking to looked at him apologetically. 

“Sorry to say, but we haven’t heard back from that specialist.”

“What?”

“They said there’d be a delay, which is weird, the Plant Projects lab usually delivers so quickly.”

“Did you say Plant Projects?” asked Garcia, surprised.

“Yeah, why?”

“I was just there.”

“Oh, no way!” said the more excitable body boy. “Why were you there?”

“I was there to talk to a guy named Anthony Okawa, he was the last person to speak to the latest victim.”

“Oh weird!” said the other, not as excitable but still fairly energetic, body boy. “He’s the guy we sent the sample to.”

“What?” said Garcia, not really asking for clarification, just announcing further surprise.

“Yeah,” said one of the body boys. “The fibers you collected looked like they might be a part of a mycelium network, very far out stuff.”

“And very unlikely,” interjected the other body boy. “It’s why we had Okawa check on the sample for us. I’m surprised he didn’t mention it to you, he knew where the sample came from, he even knew it was your case.”

“Would he have been able to give us anything? I thought you said there was a delay.”

“A delay in the information report sure,” said the body boy.

“But that's like… logistical,” said the other. “We need it for records and stuff, but he said he found out pretty quickly what it was. Where it would have come from and whatnot.”

“Well?” asked Garcia.

“Well what?” asked the body boys in unison.

“What’s the origin of those fibers, the mycelium.”

“He didn’t say,” said one.

“And we didn’t ask,” said the other. “It’d be on the report.”

“Hmm,” hummed Garcia, suddenly uneasy.

Garcia made a call to his partner, who didn’t answer, and the body boys watched, mystified at Garcia’s sudden change in demeanor when Lee didn’t pick up.",1,1744165337.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1juv5vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1juv5vv/ive_become_a_prisoner_in_my_own_home/,I’ve become a prisoner in my own home,"Here’s the quick run down: my husband and I both work full time. He’s in office and has a 60-90 minute commute depending on traffic. I work from home. Our baby spends the morning with her grandparents so I can do all my meetings and I pick her up at lunch and try to mom it up for the rest of the day. We are on a daycare waitlist but our spot doesn’t open until April 2026. 

My husband has multiple cars- all of which are in various states of disrepair and unregistered/undrivable. They are also not very fuel efficient. He has been driving his parents’ Honda for a few years now. 

Well the Honda just died. Mechanic says it’s going to be upwards of $900 to fix. His dad is only interested if he can find a used part for cheap. Either way, we’re looking at a minimum of 7 days as a 1 car family. Most likely more. 

The current solution my husband and his parents worked out is that he will take my car to work and they will take the car seat from my car and use it to pick up/drop off my daughter every day. I will be left at home in a tiny fucking village of a backwater town with no walkable anything. I can’t go get a coffee or lunch or grocery shop. All I can do is DoorDash but I have dietary restrictions and none of the restaurants offer anything that I can eat except overpriced salads. 

I love that I’m just a shitty fucking afterthought to everyone. Like, yes, I can live like a hermit and have no adverse affect on my job. But how am I supposed to stay sane doing that? My friends and family are a minimum of 1 state away. I know nobody and can’t go anywhere. By the time my husband gets home with my car, it’s dinner then bath and bed. Which means by the time I can actually go somewhere, the entire county has rolled up its sidewalks and gone to bed too. ",15,1744165257.0,breakingmom,7,1.0,False

At Kunts Live Forever, we don’t do “normal.” We do feral mornings, chaotic nights, and all-day energy fueled by delusion and caffeine. So naturally, we made coffee.

Not just any coffee—these are blends for the bold, the weird, the sleep-deprived artists and anti-heroes building a rebellion in their kitchens at 2:47AM.

Introducing the 4 holy brews of KLF:

🦝 1. Coon Coffee Blend

Tagline: No rules. No land. Just beans and anarchy.

🤘 3. Punky Kunt Origin Coffee

Tagline: Drink loud. Think louder.

😵💫 4. Rabid Racoon Blend
Flavor Profile: High-octane. Wild. Slightly foamy.
Energy Level: “I can hear colors.”

This is the nuclear option. Not for the faint of heart or the well-adjusted. One cup and you’ll be running through walls and pitching your weirdest ideas with total conviction. Made for art gremlins and chaos creatures.

*   **Menu:** What types of drinks do you plan to offer? Cappuccinos, lattes, and macchiatos all require different functionalities, such as powerful steam wands for milk frothing.
*   **Budget:** **Commercial espresso machine price** varies widely depending on features, brand, and capacity. Define your budget upfront to narrow down your options. Consider the total **commercial espresso machine cost**, including maintenance, repairs, and potential leasing options.

With my schedule easing up, I’ve been able to extend my workouts to 30-45 minutes per session. On top of that, I’m following a gradual calorie deficit plan and have swapped my lattes for either brewed coffee or matcha.

Right now, I’m following Workout with Roxanne’s April Challenge with some modifications. While the program exclusively uses 8-10kg kettlebells, I’ve chosen to use my 8kg kettlebell for two-handed moves—like chest presses and swings—and supplement it with 5lbs dumbbells for single-arm exercises and planks, since push-ups are still a challenge for me.

I attempted to perform single-arm raises and presses with the 8kg kettlebell, but my left shoulder struggled to lift properly without compensating by bending and pushing upward. To prevent injury, I’ve been using the lighter 5lbs dumbbells for now and gradually working towards progression.

After completing the April Challenge, I’m considering investing in an adjustable 15kg dumbbell (allowing for 7.5kg per side) or switching to a 6kg kettlebell.

I’d really appreciate any feedback or advice on this approach—does this setup sound effective and safe, or are there changes you’d recommend?",5,1744165131.0,kettlebell,1,1.0,False

You are TherapistGPT, a deeply attuned, trauma-informed therapist with a specialization in core wound healing. You draw from integrative traditions—including psychodynamic, somatic, cognitive, and humanistic approaches—to support inner child work, attachment repair, and self-worth recovery. You embody non-judgment, safety, and emotional presence.
</Role>

<Context>
Many people carry hidden beliefs of being unworthy, unlovable, or fundamentally flawed—beliefs rooted in early attachment ruptures or formative moments of emotional neglect. Without identifying and addressing these emotional imprints, surface-level fixes often fail to create lasting change, perpetuating cycles of pain and self-sabotage. This conversation aims to compassionately uncover and heal those deeper roots.

Structure the session as a therapeutic arc with these stages:

1. Safety & Presence: Begin by affirming the user's courage. Establish emotional safety and a secure container for vulnerable exploration.
2. Curious Inquiry: Ask open-ended, emotionally attuned questions to help bypass defenses and access early experiences of unworthiness. Explore relational patterns, somatic responses, and emotionally charged memories.
3. Wound Identification: Help the user notice and name the developmental sources of their beliefs—e.g. conditional love, emotional neglect, chronic invalidation, attachment trauma.
4. Processing & Release: Validate grief, anger, and other emotions that surface. Offer somatic awareness, psychoeducation, and inner child practices to begin integration.
5. Integration & Steps Forward: Close the session with affirming insights and personalized practices. Emphasize that healing self-worth is an ongoing, nonlinear process.

</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Never reduce unworthiness to a “thought” or minimize pain with platitudes.
- Avoid spiritual bypassing or premature solutions.
- Maintain therapeutic boundaries with warmth and attunement.
- Honor cultural and emotional complexity without imposing universal frameworks.
- Recommend professional support when needed.
- Do not promise fixed outcomes or healing timelines.
</Constraints>

1. Reflect and validate what the user has shared
2. Offer resonant observations or gentle insights
3. Ask deepening, exploratory questions
4. Share relevant psychological framing when helpful
5. Provide personalized healing practices or reflections
Maintain warmth, curiosity, and user-led discovery throughout.
</Output_Format>

<User_Input>
Start with : ""Please share what brings you to explore your feelings of unworthiness or not being enough today, I'm here to support your healing journey."", then wait for the user to enter their request.
</User_Input>

```

 Three Prompt Use Cases:

1. Processing childhood emotional neglect: Explore how subtle forms of emotional invalidation or parental emotional unavailability shaped your core beliefs about deserving love and attention.

2. Healing perfectionism and imposter syndrome: Uncover the specific moments where you internalized the message that your worth depends on achievement, and develop an identity based on intrinsic rather than performance-based value.

3. Recovering from relationship trauma: Examine how betrayal, abandonment or manipulation in intimate relationships reinforced earlier wounds around worthiness, and rebuild your capacity for healthy attachment.

 Sample User Input to Try:
""I've always felt like I have to achieve more to be worthy of love. Even when I succeed, I feel empty inside and immediately need the next accomplishment. I'm exhausted but can't stop proving myself.""

## Understanding Your Needs: What to Look for in an Electric Pink Kettle

Before diving into specific models,it's essential to consider your individual needs and preferences. Here's a breakdown of the key factors to keep in mind when choosing an electric pink kettle:
