","I'm a developer in a large metro city and am inquiring about the study habits and preferences of students. This will inform the investment of a large communal building directed for students as an alternative to small coffee shops and public university libraries. We aim to provide the best atmosphere bar none for studying as we feel a place like this does not yet exist. 

It would be a great help if you could fill this out, your feedback will be used to bring a place like this to life.

1gfypoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/finedining/comments/1gfypoc/what_to_expect_from_noma_taste_buds/,What to expect from Noma Taste Buds,"Posting this to try and save you some frustration.

My wife and brothers got me the Noma tastebuds thing for 2024, which was an incredibly thoughtful gift. I'm definitely in ""the target audience"" (disposable income, not in culinary industry, cooking as hobby, gets a little too into hobbies). I felt way too exposed watching The Menu. Anyway.

I live in Copenhagen, so their idea was that they would be getting me access to some in experiences that would be inspiring and similar. Unfortunately, what they didn't realize is that the experiences weren't the product, and those experiences are behind a raffle anyway. Only two took place afaik — foraging in NYC and in CPH. Wasn't selected in the raffle, and no wait list either for no-shows. They ended up posting some videos on the discord on how to cook with these things, and they did one live discord event in June.

You get 4 boxes over the course of the year, each one with 3-4 items in bottles b/w 50 and 250ml.

Box 1: Barley Koji Oil, Beef Garum, Pumpkin Seed Praline

Box 2: Pepper Tamari, Kyoto Secret Peaso, Rose Kombucha (2x), Noma Dashi

Box 3: BBQ Sauce, Spice Mix, Noma Coffee

Box 4: TBD

In the first box, they sent some merch: an embossed moleskine and a canvas bag.

In Danish kroner, each box is essentially 1000kr, so $150ish USD. Most recently, the coffee was a 100g bag, so hat was a $50 bag of coffee, so 50c per gram.

The discord itself is pretty dead. It started off relatively active as I think folk were excited, and around the summer things have thinned out.

And that's it.

Maybe they will learn and evolve the experience for 2025. But I feel like I am likely replaying a lot of the same feedback I saw from 2023.

If you want the noma experience, go to Noma and have the entire staff jump you when you open the door, or to one of the countless experiences that their alumni have created. Buy their individual products, because theose products are solid and you're getting what you want. 

But don't waste your money on Taste Buds.",1,1730325996.0,finedining,0,1.0,False
1gfypfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gfypfx/aitah_for_refusing_my_parents_help/,AITAH for refusing my parent’s help ,"Here’s a little more context :

I’m 19, living in Switzerland and leaving in 3 days for Freiburg (Germany, 4 hours drive from where I live) to learn German.

I’m staying at a student residence (mix ages, some are in their 30s, some in their 20s). 


 My parents are very protective (In an unhealthy way, I can assure you. It got me years of therapy. For example, my mom trying to ruin my sucess just so I don’t leave the house to study abroad. It’s an insane amount of unhealthy attachment) 

At the beginning, I told my parent that I was going by train. My father and my mother got angry because « I didn’t love them, and I was trying to run away from them. ». My father insisted they will drive me there instead. I accepted reluctantly knowing I will never be able to « get rid of them » if they come with me but anyways. 

So I obviously thanked them, because I’m still grateful for their help. But today, 3 days before leaving I addressed the subject by telling them I’d be glad we take a coffee together, explore a bit the city when we arrive but that they drop me off at the bottom of the building I will be staying at. By « dropping me off » I’m saying like big hugs, kisses, we can obviously talk etc. 

But my parents didn’t take it well and they got so angry. They told me they were doing so much for me, and that I didn’t care about them at all. That I was being mean. All because they wanted to say goodbye in my room. As a 19 year old girl trying to get independance, is it understandable that I was uncomfortable with them going all the way up to the room, and having to unpack my stuff with them ? 

Also, I told then I coult go by train that it wasn’t a problem, the answer was the same : you don’t care about us, you’re so mean etc. 

I really tried telling them in the nicest way possible that it wasn’t about them but that I’d like to have some discretion at my arrival, and also that I’d like to try to go and handle myself without them always insisting to help me.

It is problematic to the point that I don’t know how to do some basic daily tasks, which I’m really ashamed of. They’ve always done it for me. 

So, AITAH ? 

EDIT : there is also some other familial context I didn’t mention like my mom’s narcissic BPD, my father cheated on my mom with MY primary school teacher 10 years ago but there are still tensions. I won’t go deep about that but yeah, there’s some stuff.",1,1730325978.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

However, when I finally moved out, my landlord decided to withhold over $800 from my security deposit for the following reasons:

$190 to replace a coffee table that had a tiny glue spot, roughly around 6 mm in size
2) $154 dollars to replace a plastic chair because it was missing a single screw 
3) $278 dollars to replace a white plastic table that was chipped. The size of the chip mark was roughly less than 1 cm. 
4) 150 to fix a loose beam underneath a sofa and  clean residue from tape placed on the door. 


To make all of this worse he did not return the remainder of my deposit until when it was past due. I feel like these deductions were excessive and unreasonable and according to my state law once he returns the deposit late he looses  every right to withhold anything at all. Is it little of me to take him to small claims for this? ",1,1730325858.0,Renters,0,1.0,False

1gfynjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gfynjg/im_trapped_inside_the_paris_catacombs/,I'm Trapped Inside The Paris Catacombs...,"This all started because my childhood friend Abigail wanted to go to Paris. We had just graduated and knew that we wouldn’t be young forever. She didn’t want to travel alone. I didn’t blame her. It's dangerous for a pretty girl to go anywhere on their own these days. I joined her mostly because I wanted to try all the rich foods I wouldn’t otherwise be able to eat.   

I didn’t know much French. Only the important words like asking where the bathroom is. Abby could communicate better so I relied on her for the trip. She used that to her advantage and bullied me into doing a Catacombs tour. It’s not as if I could do anything else besides hang out in our overpriced hotel alone. I figured the tour would be packed being the spooky season and all. Abby hated crowds and I expected her to bail. Turns out, it wasn’t as busy as I thought. About twenty people were in our small group when we arrived. There were a few different tours available. I suppose that split the numbers a little. Or we just arrived too early. It was ten in the morning after all.  

Our tour guide stopped at the entrance to tell us the long list of rules. Her accent was so thick I didn’t understand most of it. From what I gathered, she said not to touch anything. Stay with the group and for the love of God, don’t try to bring anything home. Gross. I knew people took rocks from National Parks but who would want a dusty old bone?  

Abby and I were at the end of the group. The tunnels were dark and dusty. Not damp like I assumed. The tour guide spoke explaining the history and gesturing towards signs for us to stop and read if we would like. I had thought that seeing piles and piles of human remains might break me out a little. I was just bored. Because I didn’t understand our guide, I was missing out on all the neat facts. And once you saw one pile of bones, the next wasn’t too interesting. The wall of skulls looked a little neat though.  

Abby had moved near the front of the group to read a sign. I didn’t know if phones were allowed, but I glanced down at mine, shocked to see a signal. For the next few minutes, I kept my head down, trying to connect to a local coffee shop's Wi-Fi that was above us while walking behind the group.  

Our guide's voice echoed down the stone hallway. The orange lights and countless candles weren’t good enough to keep me from tipping over the uneven stone floor a few times. I don’t know how long I walked until I realized I no longer could hear voices or footsteps.  

When I looked up, I found myself in an empty tunnel lined with candles. No bones. No tour guide. No Abby. No one. That couldn’t be right. Didn’t they say if I got lost I should stay put? I waited for a while listening trying to hear any signs of life. I called out, my echoing voice giving me the chills.  

Finally, I heard someone call back in French. Relieved, I started walking towards the voice praying I would be out of here soon. Abby would give me an earful when I saw her next.   

I turned the corner expecting to see the group again. I heard the sounds of a large crowd talking and moving about. When I looked around the corner I didn’t see a soul. Just another long hallway lined with more bones. There weren’t any candles in the new hallway. I shone my phone flashlight down the narrow passage. The light couldn’t reach the end. I found myself rubbing my arms feeling suddenly cold. And scared as hell. I’m normally not the one to get scared at haunted places but this was getting to me.  

Had my ears been playing tricks on me? No. I knew I heard voices.   

I didn’t want to go further into the tunnels so I turned to come back the way I came. I should have done that to start with.  

Soon I found myself doubting my memory. The candles that had lined the hallway had been white, not black. At least a thousand were on the floor, half melted with piles of wax forming on top of each other. At the end of the hallway was something I knew I hadn’t seen before.   

A wooden door. I stopped in front of it, freaked out. For some odd reason, I knocked first as if expecting an answer. I heard people illegally set up raves and even movie theaters down here. But this door looked to be ancient as if it had been down here since the tunnels were made.   

Carefully I placed a hand on the worn brass handle to push open the door a crack. A burst of cold wind came, howling down the hallway and snuffing out some candles. Cold sweat started at the back of my neck. When I opened the door, I only saw darkness. Simply nothing. The floor ended when the door opened up. A deep dark almost endless pit was just beyond my toes.   

This couldn’t be right. I’ve never heard of a pit like this. I stared down into the darkness almost expecting this to all be a hoax. As I stared, the inky blackness started to slightly lighten. A red light appeared at the bottom with a sudden blast of hot air. I swore I heard something like drums rhythmically beating down below.  

Nope.  

I slammed the door refusing to deal with whatever all that was. I needed to get the hell out of here.  

I turned to walk back down the hallway. Instead of being greeted by the other tunnel lined with bones, I saw an empty tunnel covered with graffiti. My heart leaped into my throat. The was a line of electric lights above. If I followed that I would make my way to the exit, right?  

I started to jog, my feet slipping on the dusty floor. My lungs burned from effort and fear. I didn’t know what any of the spray-painted words meant. But I was glad to see them.  

My job started into a run when I noticed another steel door at the end of the tunnel. I crashed into it, spilling through expecting to be greeted by fresh air. Instead, I started falling into a pitch-black pit.  

I woke up, my entire body throbbing in pain with so many hard rocks digging into my back. When I moved in the dark to pull out my phone for light, my arm moved aside what I was laying on and an odd crunching sound echoed through the room. My throat grew dry and I almost didn’t turn on my phone from the dread of what I would see.  

The light came on but didn’t cover the entire room. I was sitting on so many human skeletons, all dry and cracked from age. Unable to help myself, I screamed. Scrambling, I struggled to move over the pile, my skin crawling every time my exposed skin touched the dry remains. The room appeared endless. I slipped and rolled down a slope of the bones, scraping my arms along the way. My fresh wounds stung however I just wanted to get the hell out of there.  

I found a stone wall with a small opening just large enough to fit through. I entered into another tunnel, this one a bit smaller than the others. I sat, dry heaving while shaking the dust off my clothing.  

Footsteps came from the darkness. I only had my phone for light. I should have been overjoyed to hear another person, and yet my body went into flight mode. I moved as fast as I could away from the sound, my heart pounding as the person behind me got closer and closer. A small hole was in the wall. I knew I couldn’t run forever so I risked it.  

I crammed myself inside, no longer caring about bruises and cuts. Shoving my phone in my pocket, I clamped my hands over my mouth trying to quiet my breathing. My knees pressed hard against my chest as I huddled in a space far too small for my body.  

The footsteps grew louder. I thought my heart would stop as I tried to think of what may come out of the darkness for me. Not knowing what was out there was far more terrifying than seeing any kind of monster mankind could think of. I was almost tempted to peek my head out to get an answer to avoid the fear of not having one.  

The steps passed but were soon joined by more. I needed to place my hands over my ears and shut my eyes tight against the booming sounds of a crowd stomping just outside my hiding spot. Voices came, unlike anything a human could make. Cruel laughter and something almost like music mixed into the deafening chorus. I might have been there for a few minutes but it felt like an eternity of being crammed inside that crack in the wall, scared and alone.  

Even when tie sounds died down, I didn’t dare leave my hiding spot. Hot silent tears ran down my face. I just wanted to go home. But deep down I knew no matter how much I explored these tunnels; I would never find the way out.  

A hand fell on my shoulder causing me to scream. I flinched away unable to move in the small space. The hand withdrew and I saw a pale face peeking at me in the dark.  They looked human enough. So thin they might as well be a skull with long black hair. Their dark eyes sunken into their face. As yet, the smile was almost kind.  

Despite my fear, I found myself reaching out to this person. I took their bony frail hand and let them guide us down the pitch-black tunnels. They may be leading me to a horrible fate. But their hand was warm like the living and I was glad for that.  

We arrived at a small room lit by blood-red candles. Square holes had been carved out of the walls deep enough for people to lay down inside. And there were people. Bodies filled each hole aside from two. They weren’t all skeletons. Some wore modern shoes, while others had their bare feet sticking out half rotten.    

The odd stranger smiled again and walked over the wall gesturing at a space. I shook my head feeling sick. I didn’t want to be in that cold dark space alone for the rest of my life. No, maybe longer than that.  

Somehow, they understood my thoughts. They wrapped their arms around me and rested a head on my shoulder. I wanted to hold this small body back to feel some sort of warmth. They would share a spot with me whenever I was ready. I wouldn’t be alone.  

Gently I pushed them aside. It took all my willpower to do so. Their smile didn’t fade. They just nodded and let me turn around back into the endless hallways.  

I hurt leaving that room behind. I do dearly want to just stop and rest. I can’t. Once I stop there is no going back.  

I did take a break to type this all out. My phone has service one bar and yet I can’t call for help. I don’t know if this will reach anyone. I pray it does.  

If you ever go on a tour in the Catacombs remember to listen carefully. Don’t leave the group. If you get lost, stay where you are. And respect the dead. Because no matter how much we struggle against it, in the end, we all end up dead and buried. ",1,1730325839.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

(Has a surprisingly deep voice)

(Crawls back to the forest, gentle, funny xylophone sounds for his crawl)

Massive ant: I don’t even have a nose, but even I have some dignity left…

Skinny guy: No worries bruh I got a spare.

(Hands him a uniform with the name tag reading ‘Michael Phillips’) 

(Bugs puts it on, alongside the cap)

Bugs Bunny: Say thanks uh…Tommy Rufus?

Skinny guy: (Offended) It’s pronounced To-mei actually.

Bugs Bunny: Oh right To-mei…

(‘To-mei’ walks off to operate the camera, as they’re still shooting the film)

Bugs Bunny: (Mutters angrily) ‘Tomei’ what kind of a name is that?

Bugs Bunny: (Puts on his accurate, fake surfer dude accent again) Yeah makes sense man…

(Not paying attention, wipes the stage whilst the actors are still filming)

Elmer Fudd: Miss Grimsby why have you forsaken me so-whoah!

(Slips from the wet floor)

(The actress also trips too, during the romantic scene where they hold hands)

Elmer Fudd: Ow my head…why did no one put up a ‘caution wet floor’ sign there?

(Regardless, the titular stars manage to continue the scene with not too many troubles)

(It turns break time, and Bugs Bunny scoffs down the last slice of the carrot cake)

(Elmer doesn’t see this and approaches the cake, his eyes closed lips salivating)

(Opens his eyes to see that all of the cake is gone, only a trace of crumbs left behind)

(He follows it to find Bugs Bunny or ‘Michael Phillips’ leaned against a wall)

Elmer Fudd: So you were the one scoffing down the carrot cake…Michael.

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.",2,1730325661.0,Experiencers,0,1.0,False

To give a little background that's since 2019. It's not a very long time I know, but I'm the kind of person who connects with people deeply. So as we've been very good friends, I was with her when she was going through a rough time (her grandfather passing away), I told Ava everything and she did the same until our last year of high school when she suddenly wouldn't talk to me as much and I felt her drawing away from me. She even changed seats to be in the front of the classroom and not back where we originally sat.



As she wanted to study law I understood that she would want to study more diligently, but I was also a straight-A student so I didn't get why she would need to move up front without even telling me. With that, it all started, Ava and I stopped going to get coffee before school and going out together and even when we did it was usually me who initiated it, except when it came to going out as we only mostly went where she wanted to go. At that time she also started smoking, not saying that it's bad everyone can do what they want it's their life, their body. However, this was very out of character for Ava and didn't say anything. She reconnected with an old friend (let's call her Cece) who we both had a falling out with, they started hanging out and partying together. I said nothing because Ava said she felt guilty about the falling out.



In my country, there is a tradition of all high school graduates partying in the park together (during the day) and every graduating class had to think of a collective costume they'd all wear. It was 5 days of parties and last classes that were emotional for everyone. I would expect to spend this amazing time with my best friend but she was nowhere to be found and even when we were together it wasn't in the park but rather me helping her or going with her to the bathroom. On the last day (Friday) there was a big parade around the city and a party that lasted all night. I left the party early because I had no one to hang out with since she left me all alone. But never mind that, a few weeks after our school had a prom night for all of us graduates. We didn't speak or see each other until then. At prom, she again didn't want to hang out with me. Plot twist she was hanging out with Cece the whole time.



I had a good time regardless of her. Two days later, the important few weeks came since it was time for our national exams. I didn't contact anyone and nobody contacted me for we were all studying. Before the last exam, I asked her if she wanted to go and get some coffee to catch up. She declined and said it was exhausting and that she had to catch up on sleep. Later, when we got our results she sent me a text to ask how I did on them. So AITA for telling her of when she didn't care about me at all for the whole year?",1,1730325469.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False

I woke up the morning after I started with this supplement and my mouth and nose was itching so bad (first sign of a sore coming on) and I could tell it was going to be a bad breakout. I took my dose of valtrex (I am never without it) and went about my day and by last night I had 4 sores! One just below my nose and three on different points of my lips. I have not been under any stress and could not think of any other reason this would come on so hard and strong. The only thing I could think of was the addition of my new supplement so I looked at the ingredients and saw aspartame listed. I started googling the link between the two a found a ton of articles and threads talking about the connection of aspartame and cold sore outbreaks. I am curious if anyone has had any experience with this and I am wondering if it is all artificial sweeteners?

Minutes take hours and hours take years. There are only so many times a person can fill the sour cream and guacamole guns in one go without wanting to put them to your temple and pull the trigger. Would it kill you? No. Would it make a mess? Absolutely, and what a godsend that would be. 

It would give you something to do.

Más Tacos was in the “Bentwater Corners,” a small suburban strip mall with little to no foot traffic. Every store here was the generic version of something more successful. Like a copy, it never looked as good as the original. I told friends Bentwater Corners was the island of misfit toys. It surprised me we stayed in business at all.

We were located between Burgers Ahoy, another also-ran chain restaurant, and the confusing Bank of Chester. I don’t know if someone named the bank after a founder or a city named Chester and it was never explained to me. In the five months I worked at the taco shack, I’d never seen a person enter or exit the bank. Hell, I’d never even seen anyone use the ATM. 

Not even to pull out drug money.

My school schedule forces me to work late nights. I’m there from six in the evening until around midnight or a little after, depending on how much cleaning we have to do. Often, I’m in my car by 12:01. Like I said, we’re never busy.

After our “dinner rush” of about six to fifteen people, we have nothing but time to kill. We clean and prep and, once that’s done, we double and triple check our work. If we still have time, the entire shift takes turns fucking around on their phone while keeping an eye out for Mary, our manager.

I didn’t mind Mary. After years of being a stay-at-home mom, her divorce suddenly threw her back into the workforce. Sometimes she acted a bit harried and cracked the whip, but she was also understanding. Mary wasn’t the ogre some of my fellow co-workers made her out to be. She was the boss and had to do boss things occasionally. Those actions often flew in the face of people trying to do as little as possible and still stay gainfully employed.

Most nights, I worked with the same crew of miscreants. They were an eclectic bunch, but we all got along. It’s like soldiers in the army. You’re thrown into a foxhole with whoever and end up bonding over your shared trauma. Most nights, it was me, an aspiring rapper named Doug (aka Tha Dougfather), Jenna, a social media influencer in training, and a rotating cast of new hires. This night, the new guy was a pale, goth guy named Reggie. If you ask me, Reggie isn’t exactly a goth sounding name, but who am I to judge? 

Tonight, while we were going about our normal “dodge Mary” routine, I heard Mary let loose a string of curse words from her little office that’d make a sailor blush. I took this as a cue to put my phone away and pick up a mop. As I was wringing out, a frazzled Mary came rushing up to me. Her face was panic-stricken and slightly pale. Something was wrong.

“Jill, my asshole ex just called. He was letting Jeremy play ‘Superman’ at home…”

“Superman?”

She sighed. I could tell this had been a point of contention before. “The asshole ex lets him jump off the top bunk into a pile of pillows. Anyway, Jeremy landed on his arm funny, and the asshole ex thinks he may have broken it. They’re off to urgent care right now. I have to meet them there.”

“Of course,” I said. “Should we close up or….”

“I can’t close early. Mr. Adamyan would kill me if he found out we did.” She sighed. “Can I trust you to close up the shop tonight? I can give you the alarm codes and keys.”

Her face was pleading as intensely as her words. I saw the worried mom look in her eyes and my heart softened. “Of course. Go be with your kid.”

“Oh my God, thank you! I owe you, big!”

“It’s family stuff, no worries.”

She gave me a quick hug and whispered, “I can’t trust anyone else. You’re the only one here going places, present company included.”

“Not true,” I said, smiling. “You’re going to be with your baby.”

She gave me a friendly smile. “Thank you. You’re a hero.”

She ran back to her office to gather her things. As soon as she was out of sight, Doug sidled up to me. He nodded toward Mary’s office. “What did ‘Live, Laugh, Love’ want with you?”

I grinned. “She put me in charge for the night.”

Doug laughed. “Fuck, dog. This whole place is going to go up in flames then.”

“Shut up,” I said, punching his arm.

“How come she picked you? She should’ve picked me,” he said, frowning.

I laughed. I couldn’t help it. Doug feigned offense. “Shit, if I ran this place, I’d have us going toe-to-toe with Taco Bell in two weeks. People be beating down the doors to get our Sopa de Awesomes and Sombrero taco boxes.”

“Uh huh.”

“And once I launched our new mascot, Mr. Taco, shiiiiit. We’re rolling in dough.”

“Or tortillas, as it were,” before adding, “and Mr. Taco? That’s the best name you got?”

“Gotta keep the names simple for Americans. We’re simple people. Check this, though. Mr. Taco would have a huge sombero and those bullet things across his chest. But instead of bullets…they’d be little tacos. Pretty slick, right?”

“The Taco guy would have smaller tacos as decorations? In a world of living, breathing tacos, wouldn’t those little tacos be baby tacos? Kinda fucked up, Doug.”

“Jill’s right, the name needs work,” Jenna said, joining us by the nacho station. “I know branding and Mr. Taco doesn’t cut it. When I started my GRWM videos, I started calling them ‘Watch a bitch glow up’ to stand out. I gained two hundred followers overnight.”

“’Cause you were showing off the curves, Jenna. You got it easy.”

Jenna laughed, “Easy? You try coming up with compelling daily content to satisfy thousands of parasocial stans. Boobs and ass can only take you so far.”

“To that end, maybe Mr. Taco needs a lady friend? Senorita Carnitas?”

“Ooh, I like that,” Jenna said. “Name is better, too.”

Doug waved us off. “Maaan, y’all overthink things. Mr. Taco don’t need a lady. He’s too wild to be tamed. He’s got that iconic Ronald McDonald energy, for real. Kids would be taking photos and shit with him. Drawing pictures. I’d probably win awards for creating him.”

“Let’s get a normies view on this,” Jenna said. “Hey Reggie, what do you think of Mr. Taco?”

The quiet guy just shrugged his shoulders. Doug nodded, “See! He knows it’s fire. Good shit, Reg! And y’all ain’t even heard about Taco Land yet. It’s full of kick-ass characters!”

Before I could further explore the origins of Taco Land (is that where Chester is located?), Mary came back into the kitchen with her purse on her shoulder and keys clutched in her hands. She called everyone over and sighed. “Look, my kid hurt himself and I have to go. Jill is in charge while I’m gone. What she says, goes. If she tells me you guys made her life hell, so help me god, I will have you cleaning the grease traps for a week. Am I clear?”

Everyone nodded. Mary turned to me and placed her hand on my shoulder. “If you need anything - anything - don’t hesitate to call or text, okay?”

“Got ya.”

“Thanks again.”

“No worries, go see Jeremy. I know he needs his mom.”

Mary gave me a kind nod before blowing out of the shop. Seconds later, we saw her taillights speed down the road. I turned back to my staff and saw that all of them had pulled out their phones already. 

I wasn’t upset. We were ahead in our cleaning, and the real boss was gone. At this point in the evening, we were just running down the clock, anyway. I just prayed no fires broke out in the last few hours we were open. Seemed simple enough.

About twenty minutes after Mary left, the restaurant’s phone started ringing. It gave us all a shock - we’d never heard the phone ring in here before. Hell, Jenna admitted she’d actually never seen a landline in person before tonight. The phone was in Mary’s office. Jenna, Doug and I made our way over there. Reggie was in his own world and we didn’t bother him. 

“Should I answer?” I asked.

“You’re the boss,” Doug said.

“What if it’s a supplier with questions about, I dunno, stock or something?”

“No supplier is going to call a store at close to ten o’clock at night,” Jenna said. 

“It could be Mr. Adamyan,” I said. “What we he think if he called and Mary didn’t answer?”

“Just tell him she’s taking a huge shit and she’ll call him back,” Doug said. “Guarantee he won’t ask any follow-up questions.”

“Vile, Doug,” Jenna said, her face twisting in disgust.

“I solve problems Jenna. Sometimes that means going a vile route. Oh shit…vile route. That’s a banger,” Doug said, jotting the note into his lyric book.

“I’m gonna answer,” I said. I walked into Mary’s office and plucked the receiver up from the cradle. “Hello?”

“Hey, this is Paul over at Burger’s Ahoy.”

“Uh, hi? If you want something, just come over and order. We’re super slow.”

“No thanks. I was calling to ask if you knew that you have a dude who’s been standing at your drive through speaker for, like, ten minutes?”

“What?” I asked, confused. When someone pulls up to the drive through speaker, a whole host of things happen. A timer starts, bells ring, and the staff jumps into action. But nothing ever sounded. The shop had been quiet. I told Paul as much.

“Well, we’ve been watching him for a while. He’s just…standing there. It’s unsettling.”

“What’s going on? Who is it?” Jenna asked.

“Paul from Burgers Ahoy. He says someone’s been standing at the drive through speaker for ten minutes.”

“Why the fuck would he do that?” Doug asked.

“You want me to send you a video? Gimmie your number and I’ll text it over. It’s so weird,” Paul said.

“Hold up. Let me have someone check our monitors,” I said. I turned to Doug, but was already heading that way. A few seconds later, I heard him yell back that there wasn’t anything on the screen. I told Paul.

“I don’t know what to tell you. Everyone here sees it. He’s wearing a long black trench-coat and, I dunno, those old hats from, like, the 1930s. A derby I think?”

I gave Paul my number and told him to send me the video. I got the number to Burgers Ahoy and told him I’d call him back as soon as we watched it. He told us to be safe and hung up. A few seconds later, my phone dinged. I had a new text message.

“Hold up,” Jenna said, pulling out her phone, “I am 100% taking video of all of this. Ghost things go NUTS on TikTok.”

“Doug, call Reggie in here,” I said.

“I dunno, man. That dude gives me the squirmy squiggles and shit. Maybe he’s the haunted one?”

“Come on, he’s new and shy. You remember what it was like being the new guy here?”

He relented and went to grab Reggie. Once we were all back in the room, I pressed play on the video. The first image was the bright, pirate themed interior of Burgers Ahoy. Doug snorted. “They need a mascot, too.”

“Lemme guess, Mr. Burger?” Reggie said, to our surprise. We all laughed.

“Score one for the new guy,” Jenna said, elbowing his arm. Reggie blushed.

“Okay, so, like I was saying,” Paul said on the video, “this dude has just been standing by the speaker for ten minutes. Not moving, not ordering. Just…standing and, like, looking all old and shit.” Another employee at Burgers Ahoy yelled, “Aww man, the taco place done have a ghost!” 

The video was shaky and got worse as Paul zoomed in. Jenna let out an annoyed sigh, “Get some basic camera control, will you, burger boy?” Once the image of our drive through came into focus, we all gasped. Sure enough, there was a man standing right next to our drive through speaker. He looked just like Paul said. Wearing a long black trench-coat and a derby hat. 

We all jumped when the office phone started ringing again. After the initial scare, we all started laughing. Even Reggie smiled. I picked up. “Well, was I lying?” Paul asked.

“No, that’s pretty weird.”

“One of you should go check it out,” he said.

“Absolutely not,” I said. “Not in a million years, dude.”

“What’s he saying?” Doug asked.

“He said someone should go check it out.”

“Oh my God,” Jenna said.

“My thoughts exactly.”

“If you go, you need to record it for my page!” Jenna added.

“Yo, tag me in the description! I’m  u thadougfather2.”

“There were two ‘thadougfathers?’” I asked.

“Yeah, and the fake dougfather got zero bars.”

“Do you want me to go out with you?” Paul asked. “I’m curious.”

“When did we decide I was going out?” I said into the speaker

“You’re the boss lady,” Doug said.

“And you’re the nicest and the least threatening,” Jenna added.

“I’d skip it,” Reggie said. “Not worth the trouble.”

“Whatever, new guy. Votes two to one. You gotta go.”

“I don’t get a vote?” I asked.

“Come on, Jill. Can’t make the Más Tacos crew seem like a bunch of bitches,” Doug said. “I’ll keep an eye on Jenna. Reggie will keep an eye on Reggie. You keep an eye and, more importantly, the camera on the ghost,” Doug said. “It’s win/win, girl.”

I looked up at them and sighed. Paul heard and sighed back. “If it helps, I drew the short straw, too,” he said. “Managers gotta manage all situations, right?”

“I’m just temping as manager and nowhere does it say I have to go confront creepy weirdos standing motionless in the drive through line.”

“I know, but I keep circling back to what happens at the end of our shifts if this guy is still there. My guess is we both work with some people who aren’t dealing from a full deck,” Paul confided to me. “That said, I don’t want to see any of them get hurt.”

Fuck. He had me there. I didn’t want to see that either. “Is the guy still there? He’s not showing up on our screens.”

“Julie! Is the guy still…oh..okay. Yeah, he’s still there.”

“Meet me in between the restaurants and we’ll walk over together. If you try anything, I have mace and I’m not above kicking a guy in the dick.”

Paul laughed, “Save that energy for the ghost guy.”

We hung up. My crew looked at me and there was genuine excitement in their eyes. I couldn’t blame him. This was easily the most engaging thing that’s happened to Más Tacos since we introduced the Churro Shake.

“Okay,” I started, “I’m meeting Paul from Burgers Ahoy and we’re going to go check on this guy. If anything happens, please call the police and then Mary.”

Jenna held out her phone. “I’m entrusting Sasha to you. Please get good footage - no shaky shit like your burger boy.”

I took her phone. “He’s not my burger boy.”

“Maybe you should stay away?” Reggie said.

“Where was this energy earlier?” I asked, throwing up my hands.

“You ever dealt with anything like this before?” Reggie asked. “Have any of you?”

“Oh shit, are you the little boy from the Sixth Sense?” Jenna said. We all laughed, but it was more from nerves than the zinger.

“I’ve had some weird shit happen to me before. It could attach itself to you.”

“Don’t listen to the new guy,” Doug said. “This could blow up online. A haunted taco shop? Shiiiit, Mr. Taco and Taco Land might become a reality if this hits!”

“Just keep an eye on the monitor,” I said. 

“I’ll record that so we can combine videos later,” Doug said . He put his two hands together and formed a circle. “Symbolic shit,” he said with a cocksure grin.

“I think you mean ‘symbiotic’,” I said, standing near the side door.

“Whatever English textbook. Go meet a ghost.”

I walked out into the crisp fall night and felt a chill wrap around my body. I rubbed my arms with my hands and thought about anything warm. As I took a few steps away from the restaurant, the smell of burnt hair stung my nostrils. I gave my outfit a quick sniff, but it wasn’t me. Before I could explore further, I caught my first glimpse of Paul heading over.

He was a lanky boy with swept over brown hair. He had on an old, faded hoodie that clung to his body. Paul had a baby face, but I didn’t hate it. From this distance, I enjoyed the view. 

Paul clocked me and gave me a small, friendly wave. I waved back and walked over to him. He was cute in an “aww shucks” kinda way. I dug him. Maybe there was a silver lining to all this nonsense after all.

“Sorry if this ruins your night,” he said. “But it was really freaking us out.”

“No, no, it’s okay. How often do you get to see a ghost up close?”

“It may not be a ghost,” Paul offered.

“We can’t see him on our cameras.”

“Well, we don’t have to get that close. Let’s just confirm he’s there and head back.”

“Then what?”

He shrugged. “Call the Ghostbusters?”

I laughed. “I have a proton pack in my car, if things get crazy.”

“Just don’t cross the streams, huh?”

That cemented my little growing crush. I might have to stop by Burgers Ahoy more often. In fact, I might be the only customer they have that entire day.

We made our way over to the side of our building and started inching along the wall. We passed the second drive-through window, and I peaked inside. Jenna, Doug, and Reggie  were watching me on the security cameras. I remembered to pull up Jenna’s camera and pressed record. I aimed it at Paul.

“Paul, do you have anything to say before we encounter the dead?”

“Yes, Jill. Please buy me a Churro Shake after this. For my troubles.”

I laughed. “If we survive, I’ll give you one, free of charge.”

“I don’t think Mr. Adamyan will appreciate you giving stuff away. I gave a homeless guy an unpicked up DoorDash order once, and he threatened to fire me.”

I stopped walking. “Wait, Mr. Adamyan owns Burgers Ahoy and Más Tacos? That man sure knows how to pick’em.”

“We all have faults. Me? I like bad horror movies. Mr. Adamyan? The man loves failing off brand fast-food franchises.”

“Maybe the Bank of Chester is funding his addiction?”

“Where is Chester, anyway?”

“I thought it was a person!” I said, excitedly.

Before we could continue our back and forth, an electric popping sound filled our ears and the entire strip lost power, plunging us into darkness. Out of instinct, I leaned against the building, trying to hide. Paul joined me in hugging the wall.

“What the hell?” he whispered.

“I…I don’t know.”

BANG! BANG! BANG! Someone beat on the glass of the drive-through window. I let out a scared yelp before I reached my hands up and snatched it back into my throat. Someone pulled open the window. It was Doug.

“Doug, what the hell?”

“Jill, the power went out.”

“I know! You scared the hell out of me.”

“We saw the ghost! It looked just like your burger boy said it did!” Jenna yelled from behind him.

“Burger boy?” Paul said.

I ignored him. “Where did you see it?”

“On the drive-through screen. He…he looked at us before the power went out.”

“What?”

“He looked pissed off,” Doug unhelpfully added.

“Fantastic,” I whispered. “Is everyone okay?”

“I’m chilling. Jenna was freaking out, but she’s okay.”

“And Reggie?”

“Huh…Yo! Reg the sledge, you feeling okay?”

Reggie didn’t respond. Doug yelled again, but the result was the same. My team had lost a team member in the ten minutes I was away from them. Mary’s job is so much harder than it seems.

I sighed. “Where did he go?”

“Maybe we should head back…” Paul started, but the KACHING of the drive through menu lights returning to life cut him off. They were the only lights that came back on.

We cheated off the wall and craned our necks toward the light like moths looking for a fix. Our jaws dropped. Reggie was standing there.

“Reggie! What are you doing?”

“They’re…they’re back,” he said, his voice trembling. “I…I can’t move.”

The lights went out again. Everything around us went still. The smell of burnt hair filled the surrounding air. I twisted around to see if there was something behind us, but only saw Doug and Jenna fighting for window space. I turned back to a very confused Paul. 

“Do you smell…”

BRAAA-AMMMP! BRAAA-AMMMP! BRAAA-AMMMP! 

A booming bass rained down on us. Time stood still. I felt the push from the sound wave ripple across my body. The force caused me to stumble to one knee. I clamped my hands on my ears to block out the bellowing, but it was in vain. I felt my eardrums vibrate and begin squealing. This was unlike anything I’d ever heard before. 

The drive through menu lights exploded, shooting glass shards at a terrified and exposed Reggie. He raised his hands to block the glass. In the last flashes of light, I saw jagged red cuts open up on his pale white skin. With that, we were in the dark again.

Through my hand muffed ears, I heard a high-pitched jolt of sound blow out and shatter every piece of glass in a twenty-foot radius. The Más Tacos drive-through window cracked into three large pieces and fell to the ground. It shattered into glass rubble. With the barrier to the restaurant gone, I clearly heard Jenna’s horrified screams. Doug was yelling something, but the sky’s soundtrack made it impossible to hear.

I shut my eyes. Mary had never warned me about this. The rumbling from the sky was so intense, I felt my bones rattle and my innards quake. I let out a scream my ancestors could hear. It, too, became lost to the soundscape. Seconds later, the booming call from the gods came to a rapid crescendo before dropping out completely. There wasn’t even an echo. The only noise I heard was the last gasps of my throat cracking scream. 

My voice finally died out, and I collapsed onto the ground. I couldn’t find my breath and panic quickly set in. In a flash, I sat up and gasped for air like a dying goldfish. When I finally captured my foe and took several huge gulps. Once I avoided death, I threw up my dinner. I remember seeing an ant near the pile and thinking, Well, dude, that should set you up for the year.

When I finally got my wits about me, I pushed up and got to my unsteady feet. I noticed Paul had also collapsed to the ground. He slowly stood up and shook away the cobwebs. It didn’t work. His eyes looked wild and shock froze his face. His mind had cracked like a tree zapped with lightning. He was trapped under the trunk. Panic was setting in.

I reached out and grabbed his hand. It was clammy and cold in my grip. We locked eyes, and I started speaking, but nothing came out. My voice was shot. I coughed to clear my throat. Nothing happened at first, but when my body remembered to make saliva, it cleared up the alphabet jam in my mouth. 

“We’re alive,” I croaked out as I grabbed his shoulders. “I’m here and we’re alive.”

His eyelids lowered, and you could see his body purge the fear from his system. Beads of sweat covered his face, and he wiped his brow with the back of his free hand. Both hands were shaking. I remembered I was still holding him, but instead of letting go, I gave him a slight squeeze. Reminding him he wasn’t alone. I found it calming as well. A human connection in an alien world.

Doug’s screaming finally broke through. I turned back to see him frantically pointing at the sky. I looked up and saw a kaleidoscope of bright, colorful lights shifting and swirling above us. It was mesmerizing. It reminded me of paint meeting water. Darkening and swirling - no pattern to follow. Jenna was screaming as well. Without hearing her words, I knew what she wanted. I reached around me and found her phone. I hit record and aimed it up at the sky. 

Her screen captured the electric northern lights as they danced above us. There wasn’t a single sound emanating from this craft - it just hovered in the sky and showed us the most incredible Christmas light display any of us have ever seen. “This must be what you see before you die,” I said out loud, but not meaning to.

“One can hope,” Paul answered, mesmerized.

I realized we were still holding hands.

I glanced over at Paul and noticed blotches of red on his face. It wasn’t bloody cuts like Reggie had sustained, but more like a sunburn. Oh shit…Reggie. Where was he?

“Reggie!?” I screamed.

No response. I ran over to where he’d been standing, once again catching a whiff of something burning. Hair or some chemical. A horrid thought filled my brain. Is that Paul’s skin burning or my own?

From behind me, I heard Paul walk over. When I got to the drive through speaker, there was no sight of Reggie, but the smell of burnt hair hung heavy in the air. I waved it away from my face and called out to him again. 

“REGGIE!”

He wasn’t there.

“Where did he go?” Paul asked, joining me.

“They…they must’ve taken him.”

“Who’s they? What the hell is going on?”

“Yo! Behind you!” Doug yelled from the window.

In the shadows of the drive-through landscaping, we saw three figures crouched in the darkness of the nearby bushes. The burnt hair smell wafted heavily from their direction. They didn’t move an inch, even after Doug outed them.

Paul took a nervous step back. “This shit ain’t worth twelve and hour.”

I reached back and grabbed his arm, cementing him in place. “You can’t leave me here.”

A crinkling sound emerged from the bushes. A rhythmic clicking answered the crinkles. Two of the figures in the bushes moved slightly. The crinkling and clicking became more rapid, almost as if they these two things were arguing. 

They went quiet again. The bushes shook and the silent third figure walked out. My eyes caught the growing intensity of the busted drive-through light bulbs re-illuminating. They were back from the dead. The shattered filament emitters provided enough light to expose what this thing really looked like.

It was the derby man.

Up close, what we assumed had been a ghost was, in truth, an actual creature. It appeared to be a man from the 1930s, but it was impossible to distinguish any specific facial features. It was an unfinished drawing. From afar, it was a person. Up close, though, that melted away. It hit the right notes, sure, but the song was off.

At that moment, the idea of the uncanny valley came crashing into my frontal cortex. We fear things that look like us but aren’t us. This thing wasn’t us. Not at all.

Paul reached for my hand and found it. We didn’t move. Hell, we hardly breathed. The derby man took another step toward us. The closer he got, the more abnormal he looked. His face shared the same swirling watercolor paint that was saw in the sky. 

I remember thinking, why was he dressed like Philip Marlowe? In a flash, I wondered if the last time these things were here was during that era. His clothing would’ve blended in then, but now made him stand out. He came back, assuming he could mimic us and discovered we’d changed.

“The fuck is this?” Paul asked, his voice wavering. He tightened his grip. 

The thing before us chittered and crinkled as if it was responding in a tongue neither of us knew. It took a step toward Paul and I felt his body brace to run. I squeezed his hand. A subtle reminder we were attached. 

“Don’t make any sudden movements,” I cautioned. “We don’t know what they want.”

The derby man stood in front of Paul. It looked him up and down. It reached into the pocket of the trench-coat and pulled out a small, hand-held device. At first blush, we both thought it was a weapon. Then a puff of smoke burst out and settled around us. It smelled like burnt hair and freshly cooked donuts. 

At any other time, these two concurrent smells would repulse anyone. But, at this moment, they smelled amazing. My body relaxed. The tips of my fingers and toes went numb. I had to remember to squeeze Jenna’s phone tight or else I would’ve dropped it.

Oh my God…I still had her phone. 

It…it was still recording. I swallowed hard and tried to not let on that I was doing anything clandestine. I wasn’t sure what I had captured up to this point, but I knew that Jenna’s follower count was about to swell like a tick on a sleeping dog.

The creature twisted its hand, and a glass lens appeared. The derby man punched a few buttons and a red, horizontal laser shot out the front. Paul flinched, but stayed put. The laser scanned him from head to toe and then winked out. 

The derby man crinkled, chittered, and clicked at us. Maybe it said something profound, but I’ll never know. It sounded like birds in the woods to me.

Seconds later, the derby man shook as if seizures gripped his body. It ripped off the clothes it had been wearing. Its body wasn’t human. He was a Ken doll. Paul and I both took a few steps back, wondering if this thing was going to explode. Would it attack? Kidnap us like it had Reggie?

Instead, the tearing of flesh filled the air. Rips opened up across the watery painted face and down his human looking skin. Blood spurt from burst open veins. That’s when it hit me. It was shedding. 

The husk landed on the cement with a wet slap. Seconds later, the lump of blobby skin dissolved into nothing. We turned our attention back to the creature. The bloody pulp moved around and a new form emerged from the ether. 

 It looked exactly like Paul.

The thing chittered again. His voice had deepened. They pressed another button and the musky donut smell dissipated. My mind cleared and the terror I’d been feeling rushed into the void.

The two beings that had been hiding in the bushes emerged. One looked strikingly like Reggie. The other, like me. My body went liquid, and I started to faint. I stumbled, but Paul caught me before I split my head open on the road. The two human puppets joined their pal in front of us. The smell of burnt hair was overwhelming. They clicked and chittered for a minute before another ear splitting boom erupted above our heads.

A flash of white light above us was so intense, it made our little section of the strip mall look like noon. I shut my eyes and covered my ears again. The ringing boom ended as quickly as it had begun. I opened my eyes and beheld a new world. It looked like ours but felt changed. Uncanny valley, I thought. I’d laid eyes on something I wasn’t supposed to see and I felt like I was waking from a long, detailed dream. 

The figures were gone. A naked and befuddled Reggie was in their place. He didn’t look injured, save for several minor cuts on his arms and face. I noticed an intricate pattern of seven triangles across his thigh. At a glance, I thought it was a tribal tattoo, but then I clocked they were scars. Six were old, and the seventh was oozing blood. 

It clicked in that moment that Reggie had seen these guys before. He’d tried to tell me earlier, but I wasn’t hearing what he had been saying. I ran to him and shook him. His eyes fluttered open, and he looked at me in a haze.

“Are you okay?” I asked.

“It happened again, didn’t it?”

Though Paul was struggling with what had happened, he had enough sense to peel off his hoodie and hand it to Reggie. “You look cold.”

Reggie thanked him and put it on. “I’m sorry I brought this onto you all.”

“What happened?”

“They always come back.”

Jenna and Doug burst out of the door and rushed over to us. They were both jabbering, but it came at us as another wave of noise. Over it, I heard Doug rambling through all the things we just experienced and Jenna begging for her phone. I felt it in my hand. Without thinking, I handed it to her.

“What the hell?” she said.

“What?” I finally asked.

“Nothing recorded. It shows a file but says it’s corrupted.”

“They do that,” Reggie said. “I’ve never been able to capture them.”

“Well that sucks,” Jenna said. I gave her a look, and she softened. “Sorry, Reggie, here. I grabbed you a towel.”

We only had hand towels. It didn’t cover everything but the important bits. We helped him up off the ground and formed a little wall around him to give him some privacy. 

“Oh shit,” Doug said. “The fuck happened there?”

He was staring at the Bank of Chester. A thick layer of raised black soot decorated the bricks. The soot formed the same pattern that was marked on Reggie’s thigh. The spaces between the pattern appeared washed out, as if the sun had faded the stone.

“Mr. Adamyan is going to be pissed,” Doug said.

The fury at what Mr. Adamyan might think was the last thing on my mind. Doug approached the wall to touch the soot, but a stern yelp from Jenna stopped him in his tracks. “What if it’s poisonous, idiot?”

“True,” he said, sheepishly. They helped escort Reggie back into the restaurant.

Paul and I stared at each other. There was so much to say, but the words couldn’t find the way out. Eventually, I found my voice. “So, it wasn’t a ghost.”

He laughed. “Don’t have to worry about making that call to Egon, now.”

“Just the Men in Black, I suppose.”

“Are you okay?” he asked.

“Not really. You?”

“No. I…I think I’m going to close the store early.”

“Same,” I said. “Do you want to talk about this over coffee?”

“I was thinking a stiff drink or ten.”

I laughed. “Know a place?”

“Yeah. I’ll text you the address,” he said. “I should get back and see how my people are doing.”

“Burgers ahoy,” I said, instantly regretting it.

“Burgers ahoy,” he repeated with a small smile. He gave me a little wave as he left.

I walked back towards Más Tacos and started laughing. Not because anything was funny - far from it - but because my mind and body didn’t know how to respond to so much simultaneous stimuli. I was a mess, sure, and dreaded the future conversations with Mary about what had gone down tonight, but I was moving forward and that’s all I could ask of myself at the moment. There’d be a realization, tears and nightmares later, but I wasn’t letting that get to me. I was in survival mode. Keep marching.

Work now, cry later.

The smell of burnt hair filled my nostrils again. I turned back and scanned the shadows, but nothing stood out. I listened for either chittering or clicking and heard neither. In my gut, I knew they were still here. Watching. Waiting. Taking stock of us. How had we responded? Would we fight them?

1gfy7pc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskOldPeopleAdvice/comments/1gfy7pc/that_one_friend/,That one friend ,"I recently got back from a girls’ reunion weekend with 5 other women I went to college with. We do this every couple years and it’s one of the great blessings of my life. 

One of us has always been sort of brash and obnoxious and focus- stealing. Not on purpose. She is very good-hearted and would give you the shirt off her back. But she has had some trauma that I think just undid her in her 20s and she never got re-did, for want of a better phrase. 

She is exhausting to be with. Every time we get together, the rest of us have to meet separately to come up with various plans to deal with her. But we are getting along in years now and notice that she no longer mentions friends other than us. She seems lonely. She has no family, related to her trauma. We are worried bc she is just going to get worse. 

Just as an example. A number of years ago, one of us was caring for her dying mother and we flew to her city to treat her to a weekend off. We took her to a spa, we planned fabulous dinners, we made time to just sit and talk or be silent. Except X could never let it be. Some playoff thing was going on that weekend so wherever we went, and especially when we came back to the airb&b, she would put on the tv blaringly loud. If we were in a bar, she would sit where she could see it and comment on it. We didn’t care about it. But it invaded every aspect of the weekend. 

This time, she was really upset about something and spent about two hours loudly trauma-dumping on us. We were asking questions and were letting her vent, but she was so … angry. She seemed to tower over us. At one point, one of us closed her eyes for a moment bc it was just so much. And X leaned forward, banged on the coffee table, clapped her hands, and shouted “you’re falling asleep.” It was startling.

So, I feel like I need to gently say something. I can predict that if I say she needs therapy she will scoff. But she needs something. She is so lonely. She wants us to all get together more often. We want to too, but - you know?

I never cheated on my wife before that and I still say I didn’t. What we had was true love.

Disclaimer my wife is a kind soul but we don’t have that spark that we used to. I miss the spark , intensity, and the passion that we had in the beginning of our relationship . I filed for divorce to be with Diamond like we agreed, but for reasons unknown Diamond got cold feet. My relationship with Diamond lasted 11 months.

Afterwards my wife and I got back together because the divorce wasn’t official yet. Now Erin is a great woman but she’s not Diamond. After getting back together with Erin every little thing she does bother me. The way she gets dressed to go to work , the way she makes my coffee, everything….Unfortunately I began taking it out on her by starting arguments and being snappy. Erin is a great person and doesn’t deserve that.

Fallout: I realized I needed to take a step back after what happened last night. My wife put the baby to sleep and said she was going to shower and head to bed early , she asked if I wanted a snack or something before I go to bed. I said no…she said she loves me and kissed me on the cheek…I didn’t say anything and she said “why don’t you love me ? She said I’m doing everything I can but you…I don’t know”. I just told her point blank “you’re not her”. That hurt her a lot she just went upstairs and when I joined her an hour later she was still crying. She cried all night in the master bathroom that I couldn’t get sleep. She stopped and went to bed finally at 3:30. I feel so fucking terrible and I want to do my part to rebuild our passion.

We hung out a lot in middle school, he did ask me out, but I made it clear I wasn't interested and nothing happened. We stayed friends for awhile after that, and I know he's had some relationships since then, so that seems in the past. But then again, he did have a crush on me for a long time in primary school, which is why I'm a bit weary probably, he was also the one to reach out.

Onto the possible red flag.

After we met up for a late coffee, he blurted out over text that he's into cross-dressing. He's always been kinda high energy and not really socially aware, you could say we were the 'weird kids' tbh. I think he was just anxious to know my reaction, which is why he brought it up out of nowhere. But I can't decide if it's strange he brought up what is probably a fetish so soon, my gut says yes I'll be honest.

I know cross-dressing can be done for other reasons, but he's definitely not transgender or non-binary, and from the way he described it he likes the thrill of going out wearing mini skirts and things. That was one outfit he described, again very soon after our first meet up in years.

I guess I'm just worried he'll get weird at some point, and telling me these things is him kind of testing the waters. It would be a shame since I don't have many friends around here, but I think I'd just let him go if that happened.",2,1730324549.0,RedPillWomen,2,1.0,False
1gfy5m7,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1gfy5m7/battling_fatigue_with_serotonin_syndrome/,Battling fatigue with serotonin syndrome,"24M
Tldr: Major fatigue from serotonin syndrome. Can't even drink coffee to help as it messes with my serotonin and makes me more tired and foggy. Ready to go to the doctor and seek medical help. Any advice or similar stories are welcome. Peace and love. 


A few years ago, I experienced major serotonin syndrome from too much MDMA. 

It turned into years of psychosis and tons of physical symptoms like extreme fatigue, uncontrollable thoughts, paranoia, mania, heavy brain fog etc etc. I had seen a few doctors but was too paranoid to go to any of them as my delusions told me they were against me. I have always been hyperindependent and against medication so I never willingly took any. I was prescribed antipsychotics which made it impossible for me to live/think/breathe even So I stopped them promptly. 

Going on 4 years since this happened and I've been able to ""ignore"" the psychosis and trudge through my day like a zombie due to the fatigue. Sometimes my mania will engulf me but it's not as chronic as it used to be and is no not harmful as I'm aware when this happens. 

I've tried all the holistic things like supplements, meditation, change of scenery, and even got sober. I am still left with debilitating fatigue. I say I'm tired and people say yeah it's normal to be tired all the time. But they don't understand that I'm barely hanging on (in terms of remaining awake and cognizant) and have just come to get used to the heavy symptoms. Including psychosis.  It's just there, I recognize it and live with it. 

*(Caffeine just exasterbates my symptoms probably due to serotonin depletion.)

Recently I got a new job that I love so much, but I can't remain clear and awake for more than an hour after waking no matter how much i sleep. When im this tired, my psychosis comes out. My psychosis is starting to get annoying, as it's getting in the way of genuinely beautiful interactions that I get to have on the daily. No it's not dangerous, it just sucks and morphs reality into a deep dark place. 

I have concluded that I need to seek help if I want  a shot at an even somewhat normal life. I'm tired of ignoring the hellish headscape I walk In every day. Just because im used to it doesnt mean i can't/shouldn't try and fix it. I can not keep thinking this will just go away on its own, I've obviously tried everything I can alone and I want to give myself this chance. 

My worries are:

• A doctor is going to try and put me on something like an antipsychotic or benzo again if I mention psychosis. They seem to think that anyone with psychosis doesn't know their ass from a hole in the ground. And the psychosis is obviously just a symptom of the issues with my serotonin depletion. I've dealt with it for almost 4 years, I can recognize psychosis when it's happening. 

• A doctor will think I'm drug seeking the minute I tell them this happened from misuse of street drugs. (This has happened before)

• A doctor will give me something that makes my serotonin syndrome worse. (This has not happened. Just a concern from hearing horror stories.)

My question to you dear friends is if there are any of you with similar stories that have found success with certain prescriptions especially regarding these symptoms and this ailment *Specifically major fatigue* being the main focus. And I'll take all the support I can get. I am at a loss my friends. Thank you, love you

God is obviously real. All great civilizations point to something divine. Parthenons, pyramids, temples—monuments built in God’s name still stand today, symbols of devotion so strong that it shaped entire societies. As someone who once lived under God's powerful influence, I know He exists not just in ruins but within us, a potent, felt presence.

 I know because I experienced it. I felt God’s power fill me countless times. It was undeniable, a force that shaped my life. But one day, God left me—suddenly, violently, and it happened in a matter of minutes. This sudden departure left me with a rare gift: a punctuated ""before"" and an ""after"" of belief.

Looking back, my life as a believer feels surreal, as though someone else lived it. I’ve wondered how God controlled me so thoroughly. It has taken some time, almost a decade, but now I have an answer. I have drawn a conclusion—a theory of God, informed by this before and after perspective. This conclusion feels both radical and, in hindsight, almost obvious.

A queen bee manages her hive through pheromones, chemicals that regulate her workers’ behavior and keeps them working toward a shared goal. When she needs her worker bees to go out and forage for nectar, she modulates the dopamine in her worker bees’ brains. A queen bee is a dopamine wielder. And so, I believe, is God. If that sounds like a logical leap, I’m going to scaffold together a bit of scientific evidence to help cross this chasm.

Dopamine is the neurotransmitter that drives motivation toward rewards. Without it, we lose the drive for effort—even for things we know are better or more rewarding in the long term. Consider the rat studies, where rats are given a choice between regular water and water laced with cocaine, which spikes dopamine. The rats, unable to resist the pull. The ignore regular water and eventually die, unwilling to do anything except drink the cocaine-laced water (they won’t even eat). The addictive pull of dopamine is so strong that rats and even people will sacrifice everything for their next hit. Dopamine doled out by the queen bee keeps the hive buzzing, it keeps rats eating, and it has immense influence on our lives.

In humans, dopamine’s influence has been widely studied through Parkinson’s Disease (PD), which damages parts of the brain that generate dopaminergic responses. Studies of PD patients reveal that without dopamine, we become less likely to choose effortful tasks, even those with greater rewards. For instance, imagine choosing between eating a homemade, delicious cookie or an easier but far less tasty store-bought cookie. A person with low dopamine, like a PD patient, will often choose the store-bought option, lacking the motivation to pursue something better. But when PD patients receive supplemental dopamine (dopamine replacement therapy), they’re more likely to choose the homemade cookie and the extra effort that comes with it. Dopamine, in a very real sense, keeps us striving forward.

One of the most fascinating revelations about dopamine is its link to religious experience. When dopamine declines in PD patients, many report losing interest in God. This isn’t cognitive; asked if they believe, they’ll say yes. But without dopamine, the conviction fades, and they find it hard to follow through with the demands of faith. It suggests that God and dopamine might be more closely entwined than we’ve previously thought.

In one study particularly close to home, devout Mormons were asked to perform religious practices and, when they felt the Spirit of God, to press a button. An MRI showed a clear dopaminergic response when these Mormons felt the Spirit, closely mirroring the brain activity of someone experiencing a high from cocaine.

I know this euphoric power of God, too—I felt it hundreds of times. The first time was when I was lying on the bottom bunk bed in a room shared with five other Mormon missionaries. We were at the Missionary Training Center in Provo, Utah, preparing for our missions to Bolivia. That day, our teachers had instructed us that God could enter our hearts if we prayed sincerely. So, that night, I lay quietly in bed and prayed, pouring out my heart to God. My teachers were right. God began as a warm feeling in my solar plexus and then spread out through my body. It was an undeniable, comforting sensation of love, so intense I felt like I was floating up toward Elder Grant on the bunk above me. Had there been an MRI of my brain, you’d surely have seen my dopaminergic system lit up with activity.

If you’ve been following the logic, you might see why I’m convinced that the Spirit of God is a dopaminergic response, similar to the effects of a drug. Karl Marx famously said, “Religion \[…\] is the opium of the masses,” but it’s only recently that we’ve had scientific evidence to support this.

Religions like Mormonism are dopamine machines because they give even mundane activities, like eating bread, a deep sense of meaning. When I ate sacramental bread as a Mormon, I wasn’t just eating bread – I was consuming the body of Jesus, taking God into myself, transforming into a child of God. No wonder I felt the Spirit – a surge of dopamine.

The peculiar commandments in Mormonism make sense through this dopamine lens. Coffee—a known dopamine trigger—is prohibited. So are premarital sex, gambling, and cocaine, all dopamine inducers. For Mormons, God should be the sole source of dopamine. Scriptures and sacraments, which represent God, act like a queen bee, channeling dopamine to the faithful.

Theologian Paul Tillich, professor at Harvard and then Chicago, described the religious experience as a state of “ultimate concern.” In other words, God manifests when we are wholly committed to some ultimate purpose, linking present actions to an eternal meaning. When I took the sacrament bread, focused and believing, I felt that euphoric presence. But if my mind wandered, that euphoric feeling of God faded.

Which brings me to my definition: God is the feeling generated by belief, a euphoric sense that comes from fusing ourselves to an ultimate concern. In this sense, God is not an all-powerful being; God is the belief in an all-powerful being. God is the story, the belief, and the feeling that the belief generates.

This theory proposes that God is a kind of cultural software, a code that taps the human brain and spreads to others. And like any potent code, it has ambitions. If you were God, what would you ask of your followers in return for the dopamine you gave them? The Mormon God, unsurprisingly, commands them to “multiply and replenish the earth” and “preach the gospel to every nation.” Mormons have the highest fertility rate in the country, averaging 3.4 children per household compared to the national average of 2.1. And last year, 70,000 devout Mormon missionaries traveled the world, fervently trying to convert others.

The Spirit of God—the dopamine surging in Mormon missionaries—is central to these conversions. Missionaries are trained to feel the Spirit and then spread that feeling to others, almost like a contact high. I know this because, as a devout Mormon missionary, I used dopamine to convert people.

Here’s how it worked: I would start praying, asking God to fill me up with His Spirit. Once I was filled, I’d pray that God would fill the heart of the person I was teaching. Often, I could see their response—light in their eyes, a flush of feeling. I’d ask, “How are you feeling?” If they described peace or love, I’d tell them that this was God speaking to them.

Then I’d show them how to summon God on their own, teaching them to pray and believe. And I’d explain that to keep this feeling alive, they must follow Mormon commandments, including giving 10% of their income to the church and abstaining from drinking coffee.

This dopamine-centric process is powerful; I converted 73 people, many of whom later became missionaries themselves. Many of them gave up relationships, left their families, and started having children at an alarming rate, in order to keep the Spirit of God burning in their hearts. Or, in courser terms, they did anything thing their drug dealer asked, because they wanted the next hit. Like a gambler who can't stay away, the most devout Mormons return to God, morning, noon, and night, looking for the euphoric rush of the Spirit.  

So, I’m not an atheist. I believe in God, but not as Mormons or other devout believe. God is a queen bee. God, and the dopamine he modulates in our brains, is central to being human. All of us want to serve a queen bee, something that gives us purpose and drives us forward.

But maybe it’s time we evaluate what our gods are asking of us. If God’s ambition is expansion and global domination, we might be enabling a narcissistic force. Perhaps, if we understand the power of God, we could redirect it toward outcomes that serve the planet? Imagine a “software update” to God’s code that prioritizes environmental stewardship over domination.

God, like a queen bee, controls us through dopamine. For the devout, the reward is here and now, in the euphoric feelings that belief generates. But we can judge a god by its works, and if growth alone is the aim, maybe we, as beings with free will, should revolt. By taking control of this code, we could turn divine power toward something vital, like saving the Earth.",0,1730324518.0,exmormon,0,0.33,False

I've been playing through the reaper rewards event with a new save and new sim. I originally had them living in a tiny home, but wanted to build a massive greenhouse to graft every plant. The original build looked off next to the greenhouse, so I built this to match the vampire world. 

I struggle with larger builds because they take more than one session to complete and I end up losing interest and never finishing them.

The second my eyes opened, I’d grab my phone, barely even awake, and launch TradingView to see what the hell the markets had done overnight. It wasn’t even a conscious choice anymore; it was like my body was on autopilot, like breathing. If the indices went my way, I felt this rush, like I was on top of the world, that everything was finally under control. But if they didn’t? Fuck. That bliss turned to rage in a heartbeat. I’d curse at anything in my path—people, things, even God. Please, forgive me for that. My temper was a live wire, and no one was safe from it.

On regular weekdays, I’d drag myself to work, putting on this act of being a “normal” guy. But fuck, my mind was nowhere near that place. I had two screens in front of me: one for my job—the thing that paid the bills—and one glued to TradingView, showing me those damn numbers. The smallest dip, the slightest red candle, and my stomach would twist. But I couldn’t look away. Hell no. It was like I was on a leash, watching those price ticks with this sick, relentless obsession. Even leaving my desk was a struggle. My phone became my lifeline. Going to the bathroom? Had to take the phone. Grabbing a coffee? Phone’s right there. I was terrified that if I looked away for even a second, the market would flip against me.

Getting in my car to drive home was no better. I’d check my phone at every red light, even glancing at it while I fucking drove. Dangerous as hell, and I knew it, but it didn’t matter. I needed to see those numbers. It was like my whole life depended on it.

When I got home, I’d sit down to eat with my family, and even then, my damn phone was right beside me. Food didn’t even matter anymore. I barely tasted it, just shoveling it down while my eyes stayed glued to the screen. And if I made it to the gym? Same shit. I’d do a set, then immediately pick up my phone to check the market. Who cared if I looked like an idiot? I didn’t give a fuck. I had to see those numbers, and if it meant obsessively checking every five minutes, then so be it.

In the evenings, I’d sit down with my wife to watch Netflix, like we were a normal couple. But even then, I wasn’t really there. I’d have my phone hidden in my lap, my eyes darting between stock prices and Twitter feeds, pretending to be interested in whatever the hell was on the screen. It was a joke, a miserable fucking act. I was never truly with her. My mind was tangled in the market, just praying for something to shift in my favor.

And before bed? Forget it. I’d lie in the dark, scrolling through Twitter, staring at the numbers until my eyes felt like they were on fire. My mind couldn’t let go, like a parasite that kept gnawing at me, demanding my attention. Every weekend, when the markets closed, I’d switch to Bitcoin, desperate for any hint about Monday’s stock movements. I was in a constant panic, trapped in this relentless anxiety. I couldn’t escape.

And all this? I kept it hidden from everyone around me. I went to insane lengths to keep it secret. Hiding my phone from my parents, my siblings, my wife—making sure no one saw just how deep I’d sunk. I didn’t want anyone to know how fucked up my life had become. I was living a goddamn double life, putting on a mask while, inside, I was drowning in this addiction.

What a sick, twisted, miserable way to live. Fuck. Every day, stressed, afraid, barely alive. My entire life, swallowed up by this obsession, this desperate gamble. This was no life—it was a nightmare. Fuck gambling. Fuck it all.",2,1730324086.0,problemgambling,1,1.0,False

We stayed friends for awhile after that, and I know he's had some relationships since then, so that seems in the past.

Onto the possible red flag. 

After we met up for a late coffee, he blurted out over text that he's into cross-dressing. He's always been kinda high energy and not really socially aware, you could say we were the 'weird kids' tbh. I think he was just anxious to know my reaction, which is why he brought it up out of nowhere. But I can't decide if it's strange he brought up what is probably a fetish so soon, my gut says yes I'll be honest. 

I know cross-dressing can be done for other reasons, but he's definitely not transgender or non-binary, and from the way he described it he likes the thrill of going out wearing mini skirts and things. That was one outfit he described, again very soon after our first meet up in years. 

I guess I'm just worried he'll get weird at some point, and telling me these things is him kind of testing the waters. It would be a shame since I don't have many friends around here, but I think I'd just let him go if that happened. ",1,1730324064.0,TwoXChromosomes,2,0.66,False

i know i sound bratty but i just feel like everything is so unfair. i kept trying to get him to communicate and it was like he just didnt know how to. i know i got a lot better mentally just a few months after meeting him, everyone told me that and i feel this to be true too, but if thats the case why couldnt he be honest? i literally bent over backwards to make him feel more comfortable with me and so he didnt feel like he had to ""take care"" of me, i thought i did everything right. and i know i was genuinely insufferable in the beginning, i cried a lot, i was scared a lot, i was very depressed but i tried my best to make myself better while he just kept telling me that he couldnt deal with my emotions and got visibly annoyed every time i cried. 

ive always known that im hard to love and i gave my everything to let myself believe him when he told me that he loves me, that im not too much, that he sees a future with me. i supressed every bad feeling, every bad thought, i communicated to the best of my abilities, to the point that my friends and family told me all the time how good im doing. now that we broke up, i cant sleep again, and everytime i do i have nightmares of him being with someone else. i can barely eat. i feel horrible thinking about him feeling like he ""had to be with me"", and i feel even more horrible thinking about the what ifs of the situation. i feel horrible knowing i would have (and have done) everything i could for this relationship just for him to never want to see me again. he couldnt even break up in person. i still dont completely understand why everything happened the way it did because he refused to talk afterwards, which i get but which is also what i thought is the ""adult"" thing to do.

i think my biggest problem is is that i cant really talk to anyone. my friends are happy that we broke up because of certain things that happened in our relationship which i forgave him for (mainly me having a panic attack and him scrolling through tiktok ignoring me for half an hour cause he thought my reason to be upset was stupid), my family keeps telling me that i should never sulk over a man, but idk. everything feels horrible. we talked about moving in together a few weeks before we broke up. he took me on dates, i took care of him while he was sick, cleaned for him, massaged him, all in the leadup to this. i genuinely dont get where we went wrong, and i dont get why he couldnt break up with me to my face. i dont think im that horrible, i wouldnt have cried infront of him, but i maybe im wrong?

whenever im not actively distracting myself i break down crying. and because i dont wanna be this person again, and i dont want my people to be worried im just alone in my room drinking, but i feel fucking horrible. i wish i wouldve done more, i wish i wouldnt have been as fucked up when he met me. whenever someone tells me i deserve better i wanna die because if i did, why did this happen? hes the greatest guy i knew, i genuinely saw my life with him, and now hes gone without a trace. 

when i go to work or uni, my makeup is done, my outfit is well prepared, im all smiles, i get everyone coffee. so many people have congradulated me on how well im dealing with this, but im really, really not.

1gfxu0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1gfxu0f/here_are_18_ways_to_manage_your_misery/,Here are 18 ways to manage your misery.,"Sometimes stuff just piles up on us. Work, friends, family, financial issues, bad habits and addictions.. The list goes on.

You may feel like you were doing so fine, but now, suddenly you're going in the wrong direction, slipping back into old habits. You start coping with the stress in your life in ways you know aren't healthy. You start losing focus (or focusing on the wrong stuff), you may feel downright depressed, and it's like you're stuck in a loop of despair.

Here are 18 things you can do to get back on track.

1. This one should be obvious. Cut down on stimulants. And I'm not just talking about coffee and adderall, I'm also talking about loud EDM music, sugar, jerking off, fast food and other pleasurable stuff. Does this mean you can't do your regular evening fap or blast music at the gym? No, but you do need to cut back on it as much as possible. Give your little brain a break.

2. Write a list. There are probably 1000 things running through your mind lately. But I'm willing to bet you'll only be able to write down 10-ish things. The stress we feel can amplify our brains to-do list. If you have 5 big problems, your brain may subconsciously think of them as 50 medium sized problems, which is even worse. So, write them down and sort them in a hierarchy of priorities. Focus on one thing at a time.  

3. Nutrition. Make sure you eat enough food, with emphasis on enough. It doesn't need to be the cringey clean eating super ultra mega healthy stuff you see on IG reels. Pasta, bread and cereal are not all that bad. Relax. 

4. Sleep. This is probably the most important one. You'll be a wreck with too much sleep deprivation. I recommend getting a strong, full spectrum lamp that you plug into a timer that matches your desired sleep schedule. Set your alarm clock a little bit after the light switches back on. My lamp is so strong that I almost get blinded and I'm basically forced to get out of bed. In my case, it also functions as a grow light for my plants :)

5. Exercise. I think so many of you overestimate this one quite honestly. You do not need to hit the gym 5x a week unless you're looking to build muscle. The only thing you really need is to get that body moving. Get up from the couch, go for daily walks, hit the gym maybe twice a week or whatever works for you. Or do home workouts, those are really effective aswell. Making this a habit will improve your life so much. Tust me. Just trust me bro.

6. Reset days. Depending on your schedule, plan one day each week to meal prep, do laundry, clean and organize the physical space around you. Again, make a list of what's most important here. In my opinion, meal prepping and doing the laundry is by far most important, screw cleaning. (but no, you should still clean).

7. Vent to someone. This could be to a friend, family member, therapist or here on reddit. Getting stuff out of your system is extremely important. The thing is, if you're a loner like me, your thoughts rarely get spoken, so they end up stuck inside your head. The true benefit of ventilating is that spoken words mean more action. Thoughts will only become true if they're either written or spoken. The only way for stress to truly dissapear is through your mouth (and I really believe that one). 

8. Hobbies. Don't rush it though. If you really have a million things to do, then fine, I get it. You may actually not have time for this. But it doesn't have to be that much of a project either. Just pick a pen and paper and start doodling something. Maybe plant a seed and wait for it to sprout? Just do something calming, something easy. Whatever and whenever you want.

9. Meditate. I don't really do this, and I don't know much about it. But I know it's very effective, because I tried it a couple years back but just couldn't stick to it. Basically it feels like purifying your entire soul. Like cleaning out the garbage you're carrying around all day. It feels fucking amazing if you manage to get the hang of it. But it's difficult.

10. Think simpler. I believe this one touches on stoicism but I'm not sure. Basically, recognize what you can and cannot control. If there's something bad that's going to happen and you know you can't avoid it, you just need to surrender. But for the stuff you CAN control, go do something about it. The point here is to simplify your thinking into kind of a computer (If that, then that) and also to find comfort in your decisionmaking.

11. Cry. Think about something that triggers your true feelings. Whether it be positive or negative, doesn't matter. It may feel counter productive, like ""isn't the point here to make myself feel good not sad?"" but allowing yourself to cry about your fucked up life can seriously relieve stress. Try listening to the saddest, yet most calming song you can imagine, and flip through your childhood photos. You'll cry.

12. Stop partying completely. For a while. Because it's just not good for you during stressful times, and you know it. Focus on yourself instead.

13. Stay disciplined. Look back at your past, things have almost always turned out OK right? I mean for some people life will always be miserable due to bad luck, there's no getting around that. But for most of you, I bet you have some sort of track record of success. You need to trust that success will happen again. You got the evidence right there, what makes things so impossible right now if you've gone through similar (or worse) stuff before?

14. Allow yourself to be a mess. You can't mask all the time, you can't hide forever. People will notice you're not as happy as you used to be. Let them notice. Stay true to yourself always. 

15. Drink water. Some of us go around dehydrated every day wondering what makes us feel so weird. It could be a lack of water, so just try drinking some more. But not too much!

16. Write a story. Are you feeling lonely and sexually frustrated? Try writing romantic erotica. Feeling angry and aggressive? Write horror, thriller or fighting stories. Feeling anxious? Write calm joyful stories. But the important part is that they have to end in a good way. Don't just write miserable stuff and stop halfway through. Develop your characters and give them an objective, then make sure they get that W.

17. Looksmaxx. It's so fucking simple. Get frequent haircuts, groom your beard (if you have one), take care of your skin and body, brush teeth, and get some nice clothes. Not only will this make you more attractive, it'll also make people treat you better, and you'll feel more confident. Bonus points if you manage to make this an actual routine.

18. Cut out the negativity. You may think you have a thick skin, or you're too tough to be offended. But that's never true. You're human, you're more vulnerable than you think you are. So cut out anyone who's purely toxic. It's going to be extremely difficult but such a relief if you manage to get them out of your life.


Anyways, that's all I could think of right now. This took like one hour to write to I really hope I'll be able to help someone. Remember, these things can be used short term and long term. You don't necessarily have to stick to things forever, sometimes it's all about coping right here and right now.

I wish you all a great day! You're amazing.",17,1730323689.0,selfimprovement,3,1.0,False

1gfxr9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1gfxr9k/i_cant_feel_beautiful_anymore/,I can’t feel beautiful anymore,"My bf and I were together for around 3 years. On his birthday his roommate/best friend of mine let me into the apartment at 8 am so that I could wake him up with breakfast. I got bacon, eggs, sausage, orange juice, etc and I started cooking it all up in his kitchen. My bf eventually comes out shutting the door behind him. I hugged him good morning, wished him happy birthday, and asked him if he wanted breakfast. he said no and asked to step out for coffee instead. I thought it was odd since he was straight faced and ignored the entire spread, but we got starbucks. when we got back to the apartment I noticed a pair of white shoes at the door and asked who they belonged to. he told me that our mutual friend (girl) was sleeping in his room after a night of drinking and my heart sinks. 

He tells me soon after that nothing happened and that he slept on the couch while she took the room. He said his roommate could confirm this too, since he saw that she was over. He affirmed that he would never sleep with my of my friends, especially since i’ve been cheated on before. I had no reason to not believe him since i slept over the night before, his roommate was one of my best friends, and I had all my stuff still there. He’s also been cheated on 4 times, empathized with me, and was the one who encouraged me to trust again. i also thought my girl friend wouldn’t do something like that to me. So i chose to believe him.

Turns out i was wrong, he lied to me and only confessed after the girl squealed to our mutual friend that they were sleeping together. They were having sex when i was in the kitchen making him birthday breakfast. His roommmate/my friend knew the entire time and didn’t tell me about any of it. He told me they were having an affair for a couple of months and he had absolutely no remorse about it. I asked him why he did this to me and he said he fell out of love with me a long time ago. He didn’t apologize or say much else. I was screaming and crying, and when he told me they’d been seeing each other multiple times, i threw up all over his carpet. 

I haven’t been the same since and I go to sleep thinking about them being together. shes the most beautiful girl ive ever seen in my life. one of the things he criticized most was my ass. I knew i didn’t have curves, but he suggested me working out more to make sex better for him. and obviously she was very curvy, had a perfect ass, and a gorgeous face. Ive never felt so ugly in my life. Now i can barely look at myself in the mirror. I don’t feel good in any of my clothes, and i think about the fact that despite him telling me “i love you” 10 times a day, my body was never enough. I don’t trust anyone anymore and im barely surviving infidelity. not only did the person i loved the most cheat on me, one of my best friends knew and betrayed me in honor of “bro code.” Im more ashamed that i’ve been cheated on again and i was so sure he would never do this to me. i don’t know how my judgement could have been so wrong. I’m not sure what else to do. i can’t afford therapy and i’ve talked about the situation to death with my friends. thoughts are welcome.

Looking for Lessons Learned / Regrets...","Did some homework on the forums, as best as I can, here, homebarista, blog posts, and looking for some user experience or lessons learned and/or regrets.

**BACKGROUND**:  
Looking to get into ""roasting"". I was originally thinking of gas roaster as I have an unfinished basement with window I can work on exhaust, but not sure I want to go that route for safety/setfup - hence electric for now.

Roasted very briefly on heatgun now looking for an electric roaster for home use. I go through about 20-30 grams coffee a day, mainly pourover, but if we pull trigger on espresso machine could bump that number up a little. I enjoy Light-Medium roasts. That said I'm looking for a roaster that has some programmed profiles to get me started and can tweak as necessary vs. having to babysit or learn Artisan. Maybe down the line I move into that but for now would like something on the simpler side and then upgrade down road.  I understand with any roaster I'll need to keep an eye on it...

Budget $1500 ideally.

**Ikawa Home Roasting System** ($1270) - As much as I can find reading, many (that have both) lean toward the Kaffelogic - Ikawa better build than Kaffelogic, but the subscription part is big negative, even though I read you can download many profiles without subscription. Also read it has less customization than the Kaffelogic but better user support and profile sharing.

**Kaffelogic Nano 7 w/ Boost kit** ($1450) - Reviews says feels sub-par as to build finishes compared to Ikawa, but setup/roasting and support is better and continues to update firmware and options. N

**Kaleido M1 Kaleido & Artisan** ($799) - Many solid reviews, price looks discounted nicely at the moment - but can't find much on support and ease of use concerns. From what I've read, you need to program/profile more than the other too and doesn't have ""installed"" profiles (meaning more tinkering, hands on, learning curve - which isn't necessarily bad, just not sure if I'm ready for that) Also not sure looking to get into Artisan setup just yet to get started. BUT this will start getting me on the road to truly learning about Roasting vs the others.

**Sandbox** \- little over my price range and the App only is a turn off.

Jovia gradually opened her eyes, finding herself in her familiar room—the same one she woke up in every day. The birds were chirping at their usual time, and the sky was always a bright, sunny morning. Yep, she was still stuck in that time loop. Suddenly, she shot up from her bed, trying to recall what had happened the day before. What went down? Was she unconscious? Did he do something to her while she was out? Would she even remember?

""Oh, you're awake.""

A familiar voice came from the front door. It was Vice, dressed in a crisp white shirt and brown trousers, with a red tie that almost completed his detective look. He just needed a coat and a fedora to really nail it. Jovia felt her cheeks heat up, realizing she was still in her pajamas.

""Why are you here?"" she asked, a bit flustered.

""You said you *needed* me,"" he replied in a teasing tone.

""What!? I didn’t say it like that!""

""Oh yes, you did, Miss Sanderson. You were all like, 'Oh Vice, my Vice! I didn’t mean to, but I *really* need you,!'""

Jovia buried her face in her pillow, mortified. Vice chuckled, a warm and hearty sound that made her feel a bit better. She took a moment to absorb the ridiculousness of the situation and ended up laughing too. ""Hey, where's the warden?""

""Why do you ask?""

""Well, aren’t you still a high-profile criminal?""

""I prefer 'sinister devil,' but 'criminal' works too.""

""Are puns all you know?""

""Who can say? I surprise myself sometimes."" Another chuckle echoed in the room. ""Temporarily parole. I'll explain later. Get dressed.""

Jovia walked into the dining room, now dressed in her usual office attire—the same outfit she wore in her previous loop. Thankfully, she didn’t have to wash her clothes since they were always clean each morning. But what wasn’t so tidy was the sight of the warden sipping hot cocoa from her mug.

""Miss Sanderson, you really need to step up your coffee game. Try Jacob's—less fluff, more punch,"" the warden sprouts. She looked away from him and noticed Vice coming over with two cups in hand. She almost reached out to grab one, remembering how she had paralyzed his arms in the last loop. But funny enough, they healed, as expected and even if he dropped them, they’d be perfectly fine the next time around too. She stopped herself just in time, only to catch Vice rolling his eyes. ""Is my coffee that bad that you’re judging it before you even try it?""

""Absolutely,"" the warden replied, taking another sip. ""But it does energize the soul, and I can respect that."" Jovia frowned when she took a sip of her drink, ""I’m not really into the whole spiritual thing, so there’s no saving grace for this abomination in my books.""

""Ouch, you wound me."" Vice teased.

""It’ll heal in the next loop.""

""Not if I have anything to say about it.""

""Wow, you’re already eager to join my team.""

""No, no, don’t you mean *my* team?""

""Child. Jovia and Vice Inc. Full stop.""

""Vice and his... Sanderson? Question mark?""

The warden slammed the table with his cup. ""Ah, *youth*.""

""Watch the table."" Jovia hissed.

""Why? It’ll be as good as new tomorrow."" the warden replied.

""Don’t start with me, Mr. Brown.""

Mr. Brown listened, surprisingly. After Jovia brewed some delicious coffee, they all settled in the lounge area, sitting around a smooth oak table that formed a triangle with three chairs. It was the best pawn shop deal of her life.

Jovia collected the papers and slid them over to the two of them. The warden flipped through the documents, then shrugged, ""What are these?""

""Autobiographies,"" Vice replied.

""But not just any autobiographies,"" Jovia said, lifting another sheet of paper to reveal a picture of a little girl. She had her shoulders bare and wore a pigtail that curled at the end. Her face was lit up with the biggest smile, showcasing her baby teeth. Her bright green eyes sparkled with a unique charm. ""Is this you as a toddler?""

""You'll never see those! But that's not the main point. The child died.""

""Bummer,"" Vice commented.

""Can you stop?"" Jovia snapped. ""Before she died, a psychic predicted her death and the cause with striking accuracy.""

The warden frowned. ""So we need to bring your psychic in?""

""No, no. She didn't do anything wrong. But one thing's for sure: this psychic knows more than she's letting on.""

The warden was skeptical, but Vice was all in. ""So, you want me to start with our friendly neighborhood fortune teller?""

Jovia beamed, finally feeling heard. ""Yes, but not just because she gives accurate death predictions; she also foresaw this time loop.""

""Sounds like a plan,"" Vice said as he headed toward the front door. Jovia followed, but the warden interrupted, ""Wait a second."" He picked up a fedora from his side of the table. ""Too much?"" he asked.

""Nah, that's more like it,"" Vice replied, catching it.

""Just need a coat, and the look is complete."" Jovia added.

""Oh, shopping?"" Vice asked.

""On second thought..."" Jovia teased.

They both chuckled as they climbed into Jovia's car. The warden watched them with a hopeful gaze, praying not just for their safe travels but for their safe return.",2,1730322901.0,ImpromptuWriting,0,1.0,False
1gfxgw1,https://i.redd.it/ny3gr6iylyxd1.jpeg,A note of gratitude to the baristas who go the extra mile without being asked,"I mobile ordered a bagel and a coffee, my usual, but was having an exceptionally bad day. I just got word that some medical results were less than stellar and I was still mentally processing this on my way to the office, while trying to hold it together. 

I went in to my local Starbucks and saw at my mobile order spot that the bagel bag had this message so I saw the barista. I told her it was no biggie they were out of everything bagels - I was good with my coffee. She still insisted on replacing it, and offered me any other breakfast item but I just went with a plain bagel. They were quick and I waited patiently, reflecting on the shit day ahead. When she came over with my bagel, she gave me a gift card with a balance of today’s order to “make it right”.

I was totally surprised as I’ve never gotten one of these before. Honestly I felt weird that she gave me it because it really wasn’t a big deal.

But the sheer act of kindness was a big deal to me.  So thank you to the barista for your act of kindness. I’ve been going to Starbucks since my teens, and I’m a mom in my 30’s now, and this is the first time a barista go out of their way to be so nice, especially considering they had a line of cars and a line in the lobby. 

Maybe it’s the mindset I’m in, but it meant the world to me. Ya’ll are doing a great job making our favorite drinks and this truly made my day. Thank you good baristas for adding a little kindness to rough days. 💖",19,1730322767.0,starbucks,1,0.95,False

Vice caught faint whispers about a time loop from his little spot in the prison. Sure, he was one of the most dangerous criminals, but after years of keeping him in one place, the guards had stopped taking him seriously. So whenever any remotely interesting news reached their ears, they started chattering away, which drove him nuts.

But this time, their usual chatter was a bit more intriguing. A time loop? The last couple of days had felt even more monotonous than usual, if that was possible. Vice quietly moved closer to the door that separated him from the outside world and listened intently, his mind racing with the possibilities.

What happens to money? Does it lose its value? And what about science—could that become strangely plausible now? His brain, which had been switched off since that dreadful day when the river ran scarlet and the air stank of decay, finally started to work again. It began to tinker and explore. In his little corner of the world, he was experimenting. It was a bit sad, really, but it was his only escape from the loneliness of being on death row.

# Loop 3

Just a few hours before he finally woke up, he could hear some chanting coming from outside his door. He let out a low grunt, too exhausted to get up. Suddenly, the door swung open, and in walked a girl sporting bright yellow hair. Her uniform wasn’t anything special—a plain top and a knee-length light skirt. She had decorated leggings hugging her legs, and shiny business shoes that gave her a solid stance. But her expression didn’t exactly scream confidence. She started yelling, begging someone to open the door. Couldn’t she just be quiet?

But instead of yelling, she laughed. Why did he find that so funny? It had to be some kind of insanity. He stumbled toward her, barely able to walk, and ended up collapsing on the floor.

“I have a knife,” the little lady said, holding up her car keys. Oh, the absurdity. Vice managed to regain his balance and sized her up. The laughter faded away. She was joking around, nothing too wild, but then she said those two words. Words he never thought he’d hear again. Like daggers, they cut through the air, and memories flooded back.

“Scarlet Nile.”

In a fit of rage, he grabbed her, shaking her. How did she know that? It didn’t matter. Even though time felt like it was standing still, he was determined to make sure this woman wouldn’t see another day. Maybe then those visions would finally stop haunting him.

Jovia was breathing heavily. What had she done? She had just provoked a monster. Vice closed the distance between them again. Why was he so fast? He threw a punch at her stomach, knocking the air out of her lungs. Before she could catch her breath, a flurry of blows came her way. He hit her arm, her leg, her shoulder, and then with his knees, he slammed Jovia’s head into the ground.

A bone cracked, and the floor turned red. “Should’ve kept your mouth shut,” Vice said, lifting Jovia by her hair. She was barely conscious, but there was a fierce determination on her face as she snapped his other arm. Vice stepped back, trying to soothe his aching limbs. They felt numb, almost like they weren’t even there. He attempted to lift them, but they barely moved his sides.

""What are you doing to me?"" he shouted.

A haunting laugh escaped her cracked lips. ""I didn’t mean to, but I *really* need you,"" she replied weakly.

""Forget it. I’m done with fighting crime. I-I’ve failed. I should be dead by now,"" he blurted out.

Vice was just a blur to her at this point. She had to act fast before she lost consciousness. Jovia gritted her teeth and sprinted toward Vice, tackling him with surprising speed. With his arms pinned, Vice was at her mercy. She landed on top of him, blood dripping from her lips and staining his cheeks. No, it wasn’t just blood; it was tears.

She started to sniffle. ""Listen, you don’t deserve this. You’re not guilty; you didn’t kill them.""

""But how can you know? You weren’t there. You were there when—""

She placed a finger on his lips. ""Look at this.""

""...your finger.""

""No,"" she turned her hand to show the back of it. ""According to the records, you’re an experienced fighter. You could have easily broken my hand, but you just redirected it. Not only that, but you avoided all my joints, just restraining me.""

""What are you getting at?""

""You’re not a killer.""

Those words hung in the air. Did he really deserve them? But he was a killer, wasn’t he? If not, why was he in this mess, hiding away? *Why*?

Jovia’s tears streamed down his cheeks. No, it was his tears. When was the last time he cried?

He turned his head away from her, a faint smile creeping onto his face. ""Is it true my record will be cleared?""

""Yo ha ma wad.""

Vice raised an eyebrow. ""What was that? Oh, your jaw. I guess you said, 'You have my word.'""

She nodded before collapsing against his chest, completely unconscious

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

# Loop 4

Jovia gradually opened her eyes, finding herself in her familiar room—the same one she woke up in every day. The birds were chirping at their usual time, and the sky was always a bright, sunny morning. Yep, she was still stuck in that time loop. Suddenly, she shot up from her bed, trying to recall what had happened the day before. What went down? Was she unconscious? Did he do something to her while she was out? Would she even remember?

""Oh, you're awake.""

A familiar voice came from the front door. It was Vice, dressed in a crisp white shirt and brown trousers, with a red tie that almost completed his detective look. He just needed a coat and a fedora to really nail it. Jovia felt her cheeks heat up, realizing she was still in her pajamas. 

""Why are you here?"" she asked, a bit flustered.

""You said you *needed* me,"" he replied in a teasing tone.

""What!? I didn’t say it like that!""

""Oh yes, you did, Miss Sanderson. You were all like, 'Oh Vice, my Vice! I didn’t mean to, but I *really* need you,!'""

Jovia buried her face in her pillow, mortified. Vice chuckled, a warm and hearty sound that made her feel a bit better. She took a moment to absorb the ridiculousness of the situation and ended up laughing too. ""Hey, where's the warden?""

""Why do you ask?""

""Well, aren’t you still a high-profile criminal?""

""I prefer 'sinister devil,' but 'criminal' works too.""

""Are puns all you know?""

""Who can say? I surprise myself sometimes."" Another chuckle echoed in the room. ""Temporarily parole. I'll explain later. Get dressed.""

Jovia walked into the dining room, now dressed in her usual office attire—the same outfit she wore in her previous loop. Thankfully, she didn’t have to wash her clothes since they were always clean each morning. But what wasn’t so tidy was the sight of the warden sipping hot cocoa from her mug.



""Miss Sanderson, you really need to step up your coffee game. Try Jacob's—less fluff, more punch,"" the warden sprouts. She looked away from him and noticed Vice coming over with two cups in hand. She almost reached out to grab one, remembering how she had paralyzed his arms in the last loop. But funny enough, they healed, as expected and even if he dropped them, they’d be perfectly fine the next time around too. She stopped herself just in time, only to catch Vice rolling his eyes. ""Is my coffee that bad that you’re judging it before you even try it?"" 

""Absolutely,"" the warden replied, taking another sip. ""But it does energize the soul, and I can respect that."" Jovia frowned when she took a sip of her drink, ""I’m not really into the whole spiritual thing, so there’s no saving grace for this abomination in my books.""

""Ouch, you wound me."" Vice teased.

""It’ll heal in the next loop.""

""Not if I have anything to say about it.""

""Wow, you’re already eager to join my team.""

""No, no, don’t you mean *my* team?""

""Child. Jovia and Vice Inc. Full stop.""

""Vice and his... Sanderson? Question mark?"" 

The warden slammed the table with his cup. ""Ah, *youth*.""

""Watch the table."" Jovia hissed.

""Why? It’ll be as good as new tomorrow."" the warden replied.

""Don’t start with me, Mr. Brown.""

Mr. Brown listened, surprisingly. After Jovia brewed some delicious coffee, they all settled in the lounge area, sitting around a smooth oak table that formed a triangle with three chairs. It was the best pawn shop deal of her life.

Jovia collected the papers and slid them over to the two of them. The warden flipped through the documents, then shrugged, ""What are these?""

""Autobiographies,"" Vice replied.

""But not just any autobiographies,"" Jovia said, lifting another sheet of paper to reveal a picture of a little girl. She had her shoulders bare and wore a pigtail that curled at the end. Her face was lit up with the biggest smile, showcasing her baby teeth. Her bright green eyes sparkled with a unique charm. ""Is this you as a toddler?""

""You'll never see those! But that's not the main point. The child died.""

""Bummer,"" Vice commented.

""Can you stop?"" Jovia snapped. ""Before she died, a psychic predicted her death and the cause with striking accuracy.""

The warden frowned. ""So we need to bring your psychic in?""

""No, no. She didn't do anything wrong. But one thing's for sure: this psychic knows more than she's letting on.""

The warden was skeptical, but Vice was all in. ""So, you want me to start with our friendly neighborhood fortune teller?""

Jovia beamed, finally feeling heard. ""Yes, but not just because she gives accurate death predictions; she also foresaw this time loop.""

""Sounds like a plan,"" Vice said as he headed toward the front door. Jovia followed, but the warden interrupted, ""Wait a second."" He picked up a fedora from his side of the table. ""Too much?"" he asked.

""Nah, that's more like it,"" Vice replied, catching it. 

""Just need a coat, and the look is complete."" Jovia added.

""Oh, shopping?"" Vice asked.

""On second thought..."" Jovia teased.

They both chuckled as they climbed into Jovia's car. The warden watched them with a hopeful gaze, praying not just for their safe travels but for their safe return.",2,1730322634.0,ImpromptuWriting,0,1.0,False

Any Suggestions?","My girlfriend and I moved in together at the beginning of this year. She recently started her first full-time job as a radiation therapist, while I’ve been working as a designer for 7 years. We both have regular hours, although her schedule varies with shifts (7-3, 8-4, or 10-6), and I work 8:30-5. Besides my main job, I have a freelance design gig and coach athletes online, which adds another 6-8 hours per week.

Here's a bit about us:

* We spend 2-3 hours at the gym together, four times a week; we’re both competitive weightlifters.
* We meal prep most lunches for the week to stay on track with health and budget.
* We co-own a 20-month-old Labrador who’s with us 3-4 days a week, and the other days he’s with her family.
* We see both individual and mutual friends weekly.
* We make decent money, but with Vancouver’s high cost of living, we have to be mindful financially.
* We both have strong relationships with our families.
* We love going out raving every 1-2 months with friends, occasionally using recreational substances but only on those nights.
* We take a lot of pride in our home and put effort into its design and upkeep, which I especially enjoy as an interior designer.

In general, we’re happy together, and our friends often tell us they admire our life and relationship. But lately, she’s been feeling pretty overwhelmed by the pressures of adult life, and that stress is bleeding into our relationship in ways I’m struggling to handle. This is her first time living away from her family, and with a demanding new job, she’s constantly stressed and unhappy after work, which makes it hard for me to be around her sometimes because I don’t know how to comfort her.

She cares a lot about her health—though I know the raving and drugs seem ironic—and is very focused on maintaining good sleep and diet. She tries to be in bed by 10:15 to wind down and sleep by 10:45, which means she’s constantly managing her time down to the minute: walking the dog, finishing dinner, and completing her skincare routine all follow a strict schedule. The same routine carries over to weekends, leaving her little room to relax, and it’s affecting our quality time too. It’s come to the point where even sex feels scheduled, and when she gives me a set time to “finish,” it totally kills the mood for me.

I'm much more flexible and am okay with less sleep to work on hobbies or enjoy a spontaneous night. I’ve even offered to spend money to make life easier—eating out to save time or hiring a cleaner—but she feels like it’s wasteful. Whenever we try to watch a movie, she can’t sit still for more than 30 minutes, so we end up watching in segments, which takes all the fun out of it. Even on nights out, where we used to stay until the last DJ, she now insists we leave early, worried about Sunday’s gym session or meal prep 2 days prior. When we do have downtime, she often fills it with practical tasks instead of just relaxing.

I've tried telling her that this is part of adult life and suggested ways to manage her stress—like trying coffee for an energy boost (she doesn’t drink caffeine), or maybe seeing a therapist. She was diagnosed with ADHD but has never tried medication and dismisses therapy as something she “doesn’t have time for.” She’s a perfectionist, so any suggestion to “relax a little” tends to shut down the conversation.

I love her and am genuinely proud of the life we’ve built together, and I do plan to propose in a few years. I want to come up with a constructive way to support her without dismissing her feelings or putting pressure on her. Right now, though, I’m at a loss. Any advice would be appreciated.

Then constantly comment on everything.
Always have an opinion they tell you without you asking.

To explain why I don’t like them would take way too long.

But just one example that makes me dislike them badly. You can skip this if you like. They visited us. I was in the middle of my second pregnancy (around  22-25) and I was tired like never before. Shortly before pregnancy I also had Covid for the first time and it was really bad. Then a cold in the beginning of my pregnancy (like the first weeks). So that probably made my pregnancy symptoms even worse than the first time. I am not joking when I say that on some days I was maximum 6 hours awake. My immune system was ruined.

I knew that they would visit. I knew how they always criticise everything so I tortured myself to have our place perfectly clean. I was exhausted and yet started cleaning for days and fighting against my pregnancy sleep mode.

They come, we surprise them and tell them that we are pregnant. “Congratulations.” That’s it. Every person in my life even my hairdresser or the cashier at the supermarket show more emotions than my inlaws. 

Then the comments start. I barely listen. My husband makes coffee and waffles. I don’t eat them because of gestational diabetes and eat food from the previous day.

The whole time they know everything better about my husband’s job situation. What I say has no importance cause I obviously don’t know shit. 

I sit there and give up. At one point my FIL comments how my husband does all the household chores. When I try to reply he doesn’t want to talk about it and wants to talk about something else. My SO was doing something else. SO was in the room he says he only heard it with one ear. Meaning he wasn’t focused on the conversation.
I do the majority. My husband does stuff too, but I do the majority. Before we had children I sometimes took a day off to do deep cleaning. They know that. But yeah, suddenly he does everything because he made coffee and waffles…

They did way more than that. But this is just one example of many times they made me dislike them.

They are very critical of everything and especially my husband. I was about to divorce him because of his lack of spine. He avoids conflicts.
Now he discovered his spine (a little) and tried to explain to them why their behaviour is wrong. He came back more than once exhausted telling me that they can’t understand it. They aren’t able to. He was annoyed. They think they are right and normal. Luckily we don’t live near them and are LC. Mostly because my husband doesn’t like calling them. 

Now they are visiting again.
They are not bad people. But I am sick of their behaviour.
I am thinking about changing my approach. Why not let it escalate? 

Why not say “thanks for your opinion, but I didn’t ask.”
“This is our home, if you don’t like it, there is the door.”
“These are my children, I raise them how I like it. You had your chance.“
“Why are you constantly criticising him/us?”
“So you are better informed than our doctor?”
“Why can’t you just be happy?”

I am sick of trying to talk to them like they are normal people. It doesn’t work. I want it to escalate. I want them to feel how we and also others perceive their behaviour. Cause it’s not just us. Other family members roll their eyes when MIL starts talking.
I am annoyed that they are visiting us. I am also annoyed that they don’t show much interest in their grandchildren and when they always have something to comment on. I am annoyed that they are so ice cold people.

And I am annoyed that they show no empathy to us, at all. 
I have been through enough over the last year. And I am not willing to waste more of my life time on people being shitty and condescending.

It was my first full time position out of university in the Los Angeles area and I was working in a small startup for about 9 months working closely alongside with just the owner. Things seemed to be going well as we also recently just hired another full time employee 3 months prior. 

But this morning my boss asked me to the office today and he told me unfortunately he had to let me go, reasons being he had to drop some projects and wouldn’t be receiving enough revenue to keep me on board.

I asked about my performance or if there was any behavioral issues and he said it had nothing to do with that and that I was a nice to work with and he’d be happy to be a reference for other opportunities. 

I was his first full time employee and mainly worked measuring houses and creating as-built / schematic design sets and although it was a lot of work I felt I was learning a lot and enjoyed the work I was doing. He was also a very kind and patient boss so I have nothing personal against him.

But yeah it was quite a shock and now here I am at a coffee shop figuring out what’s next for me. I’m sure this is normal but yeah I think I should’ve realized how higher the stakes are working for a someone’s personal practice. It seems he will be keeping the other newer employee on board but obviously he favored the new hire more than me. 

I did ask what lessons or things I can take away from this and he mentioned that he wished he saw me take more initiative, ownership over the projects and treating them as my own rather than someone else’s. But he also says I’d probably be better suited within a larger firm. It just has me thinking what I could have done differently. 

It’s unfortunate, it sucks, I’m sure I’ll be fine but it is what it is. But I think I’ll go cry in my car for a bit.",15,1730322229.0,Architects,8,0.86,False

1gfx6jw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dustythunder/comments/1gfx6jw/aita_for_not_wanting_my_dad_and_his_wife_at/,AITA For not wanting my dad and his wife at family functions anymore,"OP 47f and my dad is 79.. Let's start off with I love my father. Even after all of this I love him, but don't want to speak to him. I do have daddy issues from things I've been through in my life with him and his mentality, but I do love him very much and invite him to everything we do and even just dinner out for no reason.  His wife on the other hand... is a challenge!!!  

My mom and dad got divorced when I was 11 and they both moved on, so this isn't I hate the new wife because of a divorce.  Years later (20) my mom was murdered and my dad's second wife died from complications from dementia.  While his 2nd wife was sick his now 3rd wife came around ALOT to help him out with her. (My dad went to church with this lady and has since I was born).  At family functions with the new (3rd) wife we noticed she was a little different.  My first time at their house I realized very quickly that she is a hoarder.  So at kids birthday parties she would take the extra plastic silverware and plates and napkins and stick them in her purse. (AT EVERY FUNCTION)  After my dad and her would leave we would discuss it among ourselves that I wonder if she has a mental issue? The last party there were no plastic silverware left and she dug them out of the trash.  

My daughter got engaged last year and when we started planning the very elaborate wedding, I spoke to my dad several times in a very nice way, to talk to ""Sally"" and let her know that she isn't to take any of the silverware or table decorations.  At one point we had a sample table set up and my dad saw it.  I said daddy make sure you talk to ""Sally and make sure she understands she can't take any items from the wedding except the guest thank you gift.  My dad made a joke about how much ""Sally"" would love the table decorations and blew me off.  For months before the wedding I was stressed that ""Sally"" would take items at the wedding and I again reiterated to my dad to talk to her or leave her at home.  

Rehearsal dinner night.... Rehearsal dinner was at the venue and everything was set up for the wedding the next day.  I was eating and looked up to see ""Sally"" grab a huge stack of napkins and putting them in her purse.  Napkins that were for both day and were special ordered for the wedding not just plain store bought napkins.  I was so upset that I just got up and walked outside so I wouldn't cause a scene.  For the wedding they weren't having alcohol so they set up a hot cocoa and coffee bar which was for the wedding but already set up the night before.  While I was outside trying to calm down one of our family members came out and told me ""Sally"" was taking items from the hot cocoa bar, cups, coffee stirrers and the cocoa sticks died in peppermint.  My oldest daughter walked over and politely ( I have witnesses) told her those items were for the wedding.  Sally threw the items down on the counter, threw her hands up and huffed and walked back to her table.  When I came back in to address the issue with my dad, he was on his way out.  He has had enough of my ""kids"" (24 and  22) behavior and how his wife was just treated.  I very quietly told my dad that we had discussed this and that she wasn't to leave with anything.  His response to me was that my daughter (not the one getting married) had no business speaking to his wife the way she did and that if we didn't want items taken, we should've had a sign stating that.  I told my dad I wasn't wrong they were and they continued to leave as I went to fix the drink station.  5-10 mins went by and I noticed my daughter (the bride) was missing along with my husband and the other daughter. The bride followed my dad out and said he shouldn't leave in that manner and that's when things went south!  My dad grabbed the bride by her arm, stuck his finger in her face and said you are nothing but a spoiled rotten brat and you are ruined with no fixing you!!! Bride grabbed his finger out of her face and told him the only reason he's still standing was out of respect.  An out of town family member that didn't know it was the brides grandfather stepped in between them.  My dad turned around to walk off and said he wouldn't be there tomorrow for the wedding.  My husband found out what was going on and told him we will address the issue of you putting hands on my daughter later, but if you don't show for the wedding your shaky relationship with your daughter will be done.  Next day was great, my dad showed up and was even seated at our table with his wife.  He was included in all photos with the bride and groom and family photos.  My dad didn't speak to me the entire day.  I found out later that he had someone introduce him to the family member that stepped in the night before and apologized to her and an uncle that didn't have a clue anything had happened.  Never apologized to me, my husband, the bride or my other daughter.  Has even called since then and asked for a favor.  I was busy and couldn't help.  Sally texted and asked how the honeymoon was going and I didn't respond.  

My brother says I'm overreacting.. he's old and to just let it go. I don't think I can, as this is part of a very long list of male chauvinist acts and comments he has made.  Just 1 example Thanksgiving 2 years ago my dad told my daughter (bride) that the way you dress gives men the wrong idea and if something were to happen to you it would be your fault (rape).  She had on a dress for the first time in years (except church) and it was to her knees!! She did tell him how he was wrong and his wife Sally defended my dads statement.   I could go on for days, but I won't.

AITA if I don't invite him to anything else?

1gfx121,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gfx121/gym_situation_advice_needed/,Gym Situation Advice Needed,"A woman at the gym that I am attracted to had been giving subtle signals to me. There had been small signs for a year but recently things picked up.She was always near me and I had seen her smiling at me, I played it cool and didn't approach her. Tension had been building and one day we both locked eyes and held it for around 20 seconds from across the room. Time stood still and it was an unbelievable experience where everything disappeared and all I could see was the pupils of her eyes.   

However after this moment I was unsure how she had taken the situation as it was so intense and I was worried that I had creeped her out as we both continued our workout after it.

I didnt see her for 3 weeks until she arrived and  went straight next to me to work out.  So I approached her and we had a great chat. I asked if we where going to go for a coffee, she said yes and asked for my number. I however asked her to put her number in my phone.

I said I would message her once home . When I got back I couldnt find her number in my phone. In fact I had picked her name up wrongly and was searching for the wrong one and never did find it to text her.

I never seen her in the gym for 3 weeks . When she returned she walked in seen me and walked back out to the changing rooms.

While leaving 15 minutes later I bumped into her at the exit. I explained the situation and asked for her number again . She was very cold with me but she put it in my phone and while doing so seen it was already saved there. I told her I must have picked her name up incorrectly. We left it at that and said our goodbyes. 

I text that evening saying that I would like to take her out and that if she wanted to go then let me know when she would be free. No reply back from her. That was friday.

On Tuesday she was back to the gym which was shockingly busy. She was looking up and down for a space  somewhat near to where I was working (squat racks) . We both made brief but discreet eye contact from a distance.

However she could not locate a space and she then turned around and left the gym.

I have heard that she did have a boyfriend  but not sure if so now. I dont know if she felt hurt I didnt text her weeks ago, I dont know if she has lost interest or is just taking a step back. she is not in the gym to often. How should I play things when I see her next? Im worried that time may pass and with that she losses interest.

What are your thoughts on the situation and my best course of action?

When she was last in the gym Iam sure that she was in to see me and possibly get me to approach her but the space was to busy. I think this because she had new clothes on, her hair done and was acting in a way that would obviously get my attention, added to that she then went out of her way to give me a noticeable subtle look.

1gfws46,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKParenting/comments/1gfws46/do_days_out_ever_get_easier/,Do days out ever get easier?,"I returned back to work a few weeks ago and have gone down to 4 days a week with Wednesdays off. My daughter has just turned 1 and I’m 15W pregnant with baby #2.

Most Wednesdays we will try our best to do something fun and just get out of the house. The issue is I’m fucking exhausted every time. No matter if we go to the park, swimming, pop into town, go for a coffee, go for a walk or whatever we both come back shattered and her routine just goes out the window and then the rest of the day is a mess because we’re both so tired.

For example today we went into town and I tried to time it so that we would go and get an early lunch together and then she can have her normal midday nap (which is anywhere from an hour to two hours) whilst I’m shopping. 

Big fat fail. Her nap lasted 20 minutes and I’ve dealt with screaming for the rest of the day that we just ended up coming home after feeling like I choked on my food. I feel like no matter how we time anything or how much we plan ahead or go out first thing in the morning or later in the afternoon it doesn’t matter because everything just goes out the window. I want to enjoy our Wednesdays together but right now I am so tired that I’ll probably go to sleep in the next 20 minutes. 

I don’t know if it’s my fault or if I’m subconsciously putting so much pressure on having a good time on my day off or if I’m just flat out doing something wrong. I have no problem staying in but I do want us to get out and have some fresh air. When I was on maternity leave I don’t remember finding going out so hard, it hardly took much planning and we’d just head off last minute. 

Does it ever get easier or am I meant to get better at handling it?",1,1730321006.0,UKParenting,3,1.0,False
1gfwrx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1gfwrx2/new_job_at_coffee_shop_and_not_going_good_seems/,new job at coffee shop and not going good (seems like no one likes me),"I want to start off by saying that obviously, I will not be able to give all nor the proper context in this situation for you guys to properly know what's truly going on, but I will try my best without making this post too long.

**Context**

I'm a college student in the United States (I live from home). Throughout this whole year, I've been getting more and more into coffee. I started by visiting a new shop every week or so, and really enjoyed it each time. After a while, I also started watching tons of videos and reading articles on coffee and all that goes into it. I really started to love the atmosphere of coffee shops and getting to try new coffee. I also have been struggling to make friends for many years and have been pretty lonely, so getting to go to third spaces like coffee shops has helped me feel better at least. At a few of them, I became a regular I would say. In some of the shops that I really liked, I also would try and chat up the barista asking some questions about their coffee. I even did a written interview with a very great specialty one. Now, through all these visits I never became close with any of the baristas or any customers, but it helped me get out of the house.  

At the time, I was working at a restaurant and did a poor job being a server for my first time, and got let go (making too many mistakes). So after that, naturally, I wanted to work in a coffee shop not too far away from me. 

I used to work at a large chain coffee place years ago for one of my first jobs, but they never got deep into coffee at all and I didn't really learn anything. I really had fun there at first, but as the good co workers left it became bad. And with my new interest in coffee, I figured I had a lot going for me to apply. In other words, I've had years of customer service job experience.

So I emailed and walked in to the only four shops within a reasonable distance from me (30 min or less) with the hopes that I would get in one. One said they weren't hiring, the other just opened but said they stopped hiring but would keep me in mind if they started again, one the owner said they would call me back in a few weeks (after I handed in the physical application AND walked in a couple weeks later to remind them, but they still haven't to this day), and the last one (the most quality) I had to email two times before a manager finally got back to me to set up an interview. Keep in mind, this was one of my favorite places and I've sat there a few times myself before applying. This specialty coffee shop has a few locations, is super high quality in many ways, and the atmosphere is great.

So I took that interview and it went really well like most of the interviews I've had (even with that restaurant). They said that I was easy to talk to and did really good (also have been told that at other interviews). 

The next day I was offered the job and I took it. It took me two emails to remind them to remind their higher up to add me to the paper work and get me set up and stuff, but I started my soon after that.   

 My first few days went very well I think. I made a few minor mistakes but overall they said I did very good, especially after going on their register for the first time. The co workers were friendly too, not too friendly, but normally friendly. 

All of these people have been there for at least a year, with a few being there 4+ years. They're all pretty much my age, super nice people, and very close. They're also super close and chatty with a lot of the customers.

They start people on register, stocking, and teas/drip before letting them work the espresso machine or preparing drinks. I’ve only prepared drinks once so far and have never actually MADE an espresso drink or used the machine yet. Which is fine because they want to uphold their quality.

Now, something important to realize is that for almost every food or retail job I've had before this, I often made mistakes. Mistakes as in little brain slip ups that you can't really prepare for. But I've always made them a lot and it has eaten away at my confidence.

**The Situation**

Their training period is about two weeks (about 70 hours) and now that I’m out of it I’m making a lot of mistakes. I've been out of training for a few days now. Not major as in huge spills or damage, but ones that would leave the customer unsatisfied if their order was rung up wrong or something was forgotten. I also noticed that after the first few days there, none of my co-workers, especially my manager, seemed to want to get to know me better. I would have to ask most of the questions and often they didn't ask about me. A lot of them seemed like they wanted noting to do with me. And it has only been getting worse I feel. I'll often ask or say something and they won't say much or nothing at all. Or get distracted by (anything else but me) easily. I have horrible luck and will often start talking to them and then some regular pops in right as I'm talking and it will all just stop. It really sucks.

Now, if I had to criticize the way I talk, I guess I may ask too many bland, interview-type questions and sometimes my humor may come off as bland or just not be recognized as humor at all.

What's even worse is that these people are genuinely nice and very friendly as far as I can tell. So is the management and owners. And even the literal coffee experts we have on staff. I personally love it there and wish to be a part of it. But for some reason I'm the one who doesn't get any attention. I feel like my presence is not as welcomed as everyone else.

This really bothered me because this is exactly what has happened at most of the other jobs I've had. My co-workers showed little interest in me despite me trying to show interest in them. But, also like other jobs, a lot of the workers were referred by their friends or family. They didn't just apply out of no where like me. Because I don't really have friends or family who can refer me, I can't do that. At this job for example, some of them live together, some are married, some knew each other from school, etc.

You may be thinking, “What kind of mistakes do you make?” Well I can give you just SOME examples. Pretty much ones that the brain just doesn’t pick up on without me realizing it. By the way, I used to make these mistakes in most of my other jobs as well. Never gotten fired for them besides that one time.

Examples of mistakes:

\- Customer says they want a latte half sweet, but either they didn’t say which flavor or I didn’t hear them, and I rang it in as a latte without flavor, but half sweet, so barista got confused.

\- Customer said they wanted a sandwich with their order. I read the whole order back to them before putting it in, but neither of us remembered the sandwich. A while later they came asking for it. I apologized for not putting it in and then said that, “I did read it all back to you just so you know.” Manager said I shouldn’t say stuff like “I did read it all back to you just so you know.”

\- Cleaned the wrong bathroom after being told to only clean one certain one.

\- Forget to make iced coffee orders

\- Forget to grab people’s pastries

\- Forget to make iced tea orders

\- Forget to ask for here or to go

\- Not knowing where some cups are and what they’re for

\- Forget to ask cold or hot

\- Leaving the mop way too wet before mopping (I was told this in past jobs but still haven’t learned my lesson for some reason)

\- Forgetting where things/tools are

\- Straight up forgetting someone ordered something even if I read it back

\- Asking stupid questions in general (just in my opinion)

\- Forgetting to let people know we pull two shots normally and not one

\- Forgetting to set the pour over timer right as I start pouring the water over the filter

\- Accidentally making a half batch when being told a full

Now, the mistakes eventually caught up to me. For some reason, I could sense that something was increasingly off with my manager around me. Then one day I saw the manager and another co worker talking about a ""him"" in the distance and I figured it was me. One pulled me over to talk to me (I saw it coming minutes before by gut instinct). 

They said that I was making a lot of mistakes and that every time they went to tell me I was doing something wrong, I would come off as defensive and unable to take constructive criticism. The said I felt un-coachable and came off as condescending. Now, I knew exactly what they were talking about. I was not trying to defend myself, but instead was responding in a bad way that made me sound like I was. You see, when I make a mistake I like to let the person know WHY I made it so that they better know how to help me. So whenever that happened I would say something like, ""I know. But the reason I did this was because of xyz."" Now I can see why that's a poor response. 

I had a long talk with them about this and really wanted things to be sorted out because I didn't want to lose my part in this place. I apologized and I made sure they knew I definitely wan't trying to come off that way and won't do it anymore. I also told them that these mistakes aren't something I can prepare for much, because I know the drinks and how everything works, I've just always been like that with little slip ups, but will try my best to notice and make remembering sheets for myself. They said for me to let them know if there’s any other ways they can help me.

So pretty much their conclusion was that it's all good and for me to move on, but to improve on not making these mistakes or else it won't work out. My manager also put me NOT on register for the next few weeks and instead has me on other positions like making sandwiches. Along with cutting my hours. They did not tell me about this beforehand.

I get that making the mistakes will hurt the business, but how else will I learn if I'm not actually doing the job? I straight up told them I learn best by doing.

**The question**

This all leaves a super bad and unfortunate taste because I really like this place and don't want to worry about being let go. Being that they don’t even have me on register that much for a couple weeks, I don’t know how I will improve. I also just sense a very bad feeling in the air. I feel like my manager doesn’t like me. I was very sick and had to message in sick the other day (right after having that talk, my luck) and all their response was, “I’ll try to find someone to cover you.”

The normal response would be sorry to hear that get better soon etc.

My manager did make a register cheat sheet for me and sent us our whole menu, but overall I feel like they train you all over the place. With all the little things, I feel like they need to let you know how everything connect.s They don’t explain all the context behind something and then just want you to remember specific part. Like, I had a hard time remembering how some of our drinks are different from traditional definitions, because I never actually was shown the drink or how it’s made. Just expected to know it in wording for taking orders.

For example, if we pull double shots normally and someone gets a 12oz latte with a double shot (NOT a 16oz latte, but a 12oz with a QUAD SHOT because we pull doubles normally) that means double the espresso. But I was confused as to how that’s possible for the longest time because no one told me where that extra volume is going. Do we use a bigger cup? Do we fill a 16 oz cup below the top? Do we use less milk? They never showed me how the drink was made. Stuff like that.

On one hand, I can see why my responses and mistakes could make me seem hard to teach and deal with. It may take time for them to warm up to me, I am the new kid after all. But on the other hand, I've only been there two weeks and mistakes are gonna happen more often. Also, I feel like I should have seen SOME kind of increase in the amount they talk and be around me by now, but no. There is a TON of stuff to remember in a job like this especially when they have all their recipes nailed down to the exact.

I ask a lot of questions and make sure I'm doing things right. I even had a long chat with a coffee expert of ours on how to dial in espresso and how it works. My manager knows this and acts like I do the opposite? At least from my perspective.

The way they treat each other and the customers - I CANNOT see them making as big of a deal for them if they made the same mistakes that I do. In other words, it seems like they don't like me. 

This is even more of a gut punch when I've been trying to make friends and feel included for so many years through college, work, events, etc. and the opposite is happening wherever I go.

If it's because they don't like me and not just because of the things they directly said, I don't know what it could be. I'm on time every day. I have normal hygiene and dress normally. I try talking to them. I have coffee knowledge and love coffee. I have experience in jobs like this (although, I haven't learned from some of my past mistakes as you have read).

My gf and I are getting ready to move in together and sign a new lease in the city. For context, I’ve lived here for a year solo in mission bay and she’s brand new to the city. I originally moved to mission bay sight unseen and my move in date was my first time ever stepping foot in sf. I’m from the east coast and she’s from the Midwest so we likely won’t be here long term/“settle down” in sf. 

We’ve looked at apartments in multiple neighborhoods from Richmond, marina, mission, north beach, and dogpatch. We’ve narrowed it down to a place in divisadero/lower haight/buena vista area or dogpatch.

While mission bay is a decent play to live, the whole year I’ve yearned for a more quintessential San Francisco experience.

With that in mind, we’re leaning toward lower haight for a more central, walkable location. In the mix with tons of bars, restaurants, coffee shops, etc. We would be an easy walk to haight st and diviersadero, and multiple parks.

The benefits of dogpatch are we’d get a more modern apartment with amenities like reserved parking (I need a car for my job), large private balcony, and gym. Also a slower, quieter pace. Can’t decide if that’s a pro or con. Maybe a pro during the week but a con in the weekends. 

Rent is about the same for both. Both apartments have 2b2b and in unit W/d. Dogpatch is slight larger and more amenities. Lower haight/divi is a better, more central location with more going on.

Anyone have any thoughts or experience living in both?

1gfwn22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ninja300/comments/1gfwn22/abs_brake_line_replacement_adventure/,ABS Brake Line replacement adventure.,"I bought a used Ninja 300 SE ABS for my son to learn on. Bike was safety certified by a licensed mechanic in Ontario. The point here is to teach a new rider how to maintain a bike, as relying on shops and “professionals” is a bad idea (read on).

On first test ride after delivery, the brakes were clearly bad. Dangerously bad. Visual inspection revealed new EBC HH sintered pads as the previous owner stated, but clearly the brakes were not functioning and should not have been safety certified. You could push the bike forward while grabbing the front. Brake fluid looked like coffee.

This led down a rabbit hole. We could feel line swelling on brake application, and the bike was 10 years old and had original lines. So, we ordered replacement braided lines, advertised as “OEM fit”.

The lines they sent us had DIN bubble flare ends (German standard), this bike, like most Japanese bikes, use inverted double flare lines (arguably better). Back and forth to customer service and both front and rear line kits had the same problem. They got the lengths right, but clearly they never fitted the kit to an actual bike. The solution was to fabricate custom steel adapter lines with DIN and double flare ends. In the end, we got a very firm lever. Supplier actually stated they “never had a problem with other customers”, which has to be a lie, or, they never sold a kit yet. Also, the grommets on the new lines were the wrong size, so I had to CAD and 3D print proper grommets out of flexible TPU.

Brakes were better, but still wrong.  ABS could not be activated.  We ended up changing the new EBC HH pads because they were clearly contaminated with organic pad material. The previous owner did not clean the calipers or the brake rotor (must have followed a YouTube Video). We had to dress the rotor with 120 grit emory cloth and an incredible amount of black organic brake particulates came out, then brake cleaner. Now with clean rotors and new pads, the bike stops like it should, able to threshold brake with ABS at one third the distance. 

There are hundreds of YouTube videos showing brake pad changes. Few of them clean the rotors, and none of them suggest checking the brake lines for breakdown. Kawasaki recommends a brake line change at 5 years, but the cheap rubber OEM lines are very overpriced at over $300. 

Conclusions:

1.	Mechanic safety certification is not to be trusted. This was CAD$140. Clearly, there was no road test.
2.	Performance brake line manufacturers cannot be trusted. Some newbie is going to bolt a DIN flare into the wrong double flare fitting (can be done) and the brakes WILL fail. 
3.	YouTube is not a good source of technical information.
4.	Replace your brake lines if they are not braided.
5.	Braided lines should be law. Brake lines should not just last to a warranty period. European bikes use braided lines, even at entry level bikes. 
6.	Sintered pads should be law. 
7.	ABS is pointless with cheap organic pads and old lines. 
8.	Clean your rotors periodically, use both brake cleaner and an abrasive. Difference is significant.",3,1730320639.0,Ninja300,1,1.0,False

","Long story short,-- I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective-Bipolar Type II, and I had un-medicated delusional psychosis.



In this psychosis, I found a Free Mason Family Heirloom Bible sitting on our bookcase in my living room my whole life from my Dad back in 2000, who attended a meeting once for an insurance client to get a customer.



I told my Father priest about this on the day of The Feast of Guardian Angels, and while my parents were out of town on vacation when I went into madness.



My priest gave me a holy water bottle blessed to smite Satan. With the book wrapped in a towel after touching it, reading 5 pages then, slamming it shut. An Angel appeared and took the book in the image. because I vacated my house thinking it was cursed terrified. He told me to douse the house with holy water to sleep & shower plus eat.



I got detained by my local police for disturbing the peace when getting into an argument with my parents, my Dad called the cops on me. At my house after they got home.



I was taken to the local hospital, by a police officer that heard out my story & gave me $100.



I took an Uber with the money he gave me after I got dropped off at the ER. Waiting for Secure Holding. The wait was 6 hours.

I went to my therapist's office in crisis and instead decided to go to the ER up there for me to try and get sleep medication because I hadn't rested in a week.



The medical staff at the hospital said they couldn't help me, or prescribe me any medicine. They instead diagnosed with me Anxiety Disorder and then discharged me from the ER at [4 am](x-apple-data-detectors://embedded-result/1933) in 25 minutes. When it was [20 degrees](x-apple-data-detectors://embedded-result/1965) outside, telling them I had nowhere to go; homeless. Other people were sleeping on the chairs in covers. (probably homeless too)



The Resource Security Officer started to threaten me. I started to argue with him, and I walked out.



For some reason -- My delusions, and hallucinations took hold of me spiritually. I was enraged by my self-evident situational outcome.



I filled up the Holy Water vial with water and marched up into the ER. Threw the water on the officer's face that kicked me out, and ran out. Getting away. Dropping my phone in the process,



I walked about a mile on the premises, into a building where I thought I was secure to catch my breath from running.



The police stormed in, and arrested me saying ""Hand's on Officer, Officer down"". Portraying that I assaulted the man physically with my body.



When I saw the Officer again he had red all over his face, I don't know what caused that. Maybe analgesic reaction

They took me to the County Jail, where I was put into Cell Block C, with accused charges to be arraigned of Felony Battery



I was met quickly with inmates checking me. I was punked being my size, and weight. Being in jail before, I knew this wouldn't be an easy trip.



Entering at exactly [7:07 am](x-apple-data-detectors://embedded-result/3200) the Officer checked when held for 20 minutes at the gates, with my confirmation Saint Maximillion statue in my possession in my book bag that they detained me with.

I was getting out alive determined.



Not understanding that the complex only allowed one five minute call per inmate each week without pay. Having no money in my account, calling my parents to let them know, before being cut off unknowingly mid-conversation. 



A despot inmate, after me sneezing once from likely dust being in the facility; Accused me of having Covid, and started a fight that began with him charging at me to pull me off the [6ft](x-apple-data-detectors://embedded-result/3815) top double bunk I was lying in.



I jumped off, scared from the drop. Him all in my personal space and area. Tried to chase him out of my bunk, to then be knocked out. I sprung back up, after hitting the back of my head on a metal bench seat.

An inmate behind me picked me up and led me back to my bed. Where I passed out for hours. 



Awoke in the middle of chaos, to have to defend myself from the guards never noticing on the camera.

The place was wild, with people smoking weed & spice in the showers. Passing lines of Coke through the neighboring cell block doors.



People coming in, and multiple jumping's were being witnessed. Where these killers left other inmates bathed in blood and tears from head to toe.



I hid amongst the Fear of God with the other prayer group of inmates reading Bible study in the block. With rife Hell Raising gang members telling me now ""Don't press charges against him"", thinking this was the only way out of the block.



Being told ""I was lucky because they stomped someone to death in this cell block here two weeks ago""



Now knowing from other inmates if I went into the medical or the suicide room. I could save myself.



Talking to one of the guards about in the morning to check back on the cameras, honestly trying to get out alive with my life.

Going to medical to be evaluated for my wounds after being forced by a gang leader to leave the block or else, after realizing staying in the block wasn't my best bet.

They transferred me and put me into cold isolation, given food with no utensils. No toilet paper, for half the day.



Officers came to my cell, after my claims in medical. Stated that I charged after him, and the person trying to hurt me wasn't trying to hurt me ""On their million-dollar camera system"", now me being the assailant when I never touched anyone. Knocked unconscious, apparently ""I was never knocked out"", since I got up so quickly.



Then they tried to mitigate the situation by trying to force me to sign papers saying that I wasn't going to press charges on him when I was now being arraigned on more different charges, going to trial now for two cases. In jail.



In the meantime, while waiting, arraigned by the magistrate. I got my other charges lowered to A & B misdemeanors with a $500 bond.



Being moved into another block after medical & isolation, waiting until further notice. Realizing I was now transferred to the Sex Offender's block, behind two locked steel doors.



I was unable to call my parents, and now also I do not know my account login & password. The inmates in the other cellblock stole my paperwork, hacked my account, and took the other $40 in my possession that the first officer gave me out of my wallet into their commissary for coffee.

I was unable to manage to get an officer to help me for days, obviously ignored intentionally. Buzzing on the intercom for hours throughout the day to help me log into my account to make one final call.

Being only told over the intercom, that I was being moved back into the same cell block that I started in.



I lucked out, and they had to sanitize the whole block head to toe because somebody complained about lice being found in their bunk. Shaving our heads off, and making us shower naked in front of them to make sure no spread.



I managed to convince an inmate into giving me a free 5-minute call, off his account. After two days. Telling me ""Never give up,"" after ringing me up a call.



My parents picked up, and I tried to calmly explain my situation. It ended in them telling me ""We'll be there to pick you up in the morning, we're going to bed."" Hung up on.

I hadn't slept [in 4 days](x-apple-data-detectors://embedded-result/7432) straight, on top of the week in psychosis before. I wasn't eating food, only water fasting with Kool-Aide sugar packet water because the food was inedible.



In the morning, before breakfast is served. I got my call to be arraigned on my second-coming charges, and then I was supposed to be moved back.

Walking in the hallway, and into the elevators.



Passing another Officer, that had my RO (Release Out) paperwork. Noticed my face, and said ""Is this ""....., ....... ?"". The officer handling me was surprised feet away from the courtroom.



Walked me in, and asked the Judge if I was ""Free to go?"", and the Judge nodded.

""He's free to go.""

The company previously released a preliminary report of its quarterly results on Oct. 22 and announced it was suspending its fiscal 2025 outlook. 

This report marks the first under CEO Brian Niccol, who joined the company on Sept. 9 to revive the floundering business. 

“It is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers,” CEO Brian Niccol said in a statement. “We have a clear plan and are moving quickly to return Starbucks to growth.”

Investors are expecting that Niccol will share more details about his turnaround strategy during the company’s conference call, scheduled for 5 p.m. ET.

Shares of the company fell 1% in extended trading on Wednesday.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 80 cents vs. $1.03 expected

Revenue: $9.07 billion vs. $9.36 billion expected

Starbucks reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income attributable to the company of $909.3 million, or 80 cents per share, down from $1.22 billion, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier.

Net sales dropped 3% to $9.07 billion. 

The company’s global same-store sales fell 7%, fueled by weak demand in the U.S. and China. Traffic to its stores worldwide fell 8% during the quarter.

The company’s U.S. restaurants reported same-store sales declines of 6%, fueled by a 10% tumble in traffic.

In China, the company’s same-store sales plummeted 14% as both traffic and average ticket fell. Starbucks has been facing greater competition from local rivals, like Luckin Coffee, which can undercut the company’s prices.

How do I end it? ,"My 35m gf 35f has a relationship with a married 48m year old she met at workout class, how do I end the relationship 
Hes in her phone as Amanda, and I’ve been building evidence based on the lies she gives me and their text messages (which she deletes, but she’s getting sloppy) I originally saw her deleting text messages before we were leaving the club one night and that was the first time I went snooping. 

I have:
- lying for months in little ways about this guy 
- gaslighting me if I ever ask (calling I’m jealous and insecure in a mean angry way)
- deleting texting and deleting recently deleted
- flirty texting daily, sending him the same photos she sends me. Texting him activities her and I are doing together never mentioning me. He calls her sexy, smoking hot and sends pictures of his hotel rooms (they both travel for work)
- sending him bikini pictures and vaca pictures I took of her
- deleted 1am WhatsApp messages and calls from three months ago (they started in WhatsApp and then changed his name in her phone)

Her recent lie was them getting coffee last week after workout class.. she thought I was on a plane and I couldn’t see her location. I can’t bring this up to her because she will gaslight me, get angry aggressive saying I’m insecure and jealous and will prob be the end of our relationship right there. Not the best for me. 
They both have work in the city next week and are meeting up for dinner and drinks at a hotel bar (Atlanta). She will lie and say she’s doing happy hour with work people after work..
I almost have enough evidence to prove to family and friends that she’s cheating. If I don’t her narassicitc ass will tell everyone I’m a jealous insecure maniac and control a nasty narrative. 

When I finally have enough evidence, how do I break it off? 

We live together in the apartment I own and most all the furniture is hers as mine was old and shitty.  
I was thinking the next time she travels
For work I move everything into storage in a nice manner.. boxes, bubble wrap etc, change the locks and hang a small note with a photo of this guy on the door for her. Block her and go no contact

Might not sound like it, but this hurts so much and is incredibly heart breaking. I loved her so much and thought we’d get married, kids, etc. my family and friends love her so much also. The house will be empty. I will be empty. It’s beyond embarrassing. But I have to give myself more respect than to be lied to like this and allowing this dbag to disrespect me and us like this. 

I also have his wife’s number from investigating online. She’ll be informed when the time is right. 

How do you break off a relationship when you live together in your place but everything is hers (beds, couch, tables, kitchenware). It took us 3 days to move in


Is this enough to call it cheating ?

1gfw0jc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideBereavement/comments/1gfw0jc/tragic_loss_of_a_friend/,Tragic loss of a friend ,"I’m not really sure what my purpose is in doing this. I suppose it’s just share my friend’s tragic lot anonymously. I think it deserves to be heard, so forgive the length. 

My friend, who will remain nameless, was a 28 year old male from East Texas who was studying postgraduate politics at one of the prestigious English universities in London. We learned last week that he committed suicide in his apartment and I’ve been in London helping his family sort out arrangements for the return of his body along with his apartment/school situation. It’s indescribably difficult to do so since things are so raw, but I have to try convey just how immensely tragic and unbearable his death is for his friends and family. He was easily the most complex and polyhedral person I think I will ever meet and his loss is tearing me apart. 

I wanted to share some background of things we’ve found to give some of his mindset of hopelessness and despair, to at least, as I’ve said, share anonymously what a unique person he was and share the weight of sadness laying on myself and his family. 

This is a diary entry I found on his notes app on his iPad—which he was *never* without: 

	“Nearly a month has passed. So far, there has been some excitement at the prospect of what might come my way but this has steadily abated, eroded to almost nothing by the reality that has set: I have travelled some 6000 miles and am more alone than ever. All the attempts I have made hoping to find a connection here have been met with kind but distant frigidity, if they’ve been met at all. I have not found the engagement I hoped I would. I believe I have jumped from one cliff side to the other, and fallen short. Here, now, I am faced with what I have always feared but known to very depths of my being, that I was only ever to amount to a potential for something that might have resembled significance. Mine is a story that was only ever an exercise in the pains of hoping for more where less could be the only end. Being here has set things on a faster course, and the more I think on that, the less breath I have. I’m stuck in a hotel room, each day set upon by anxiety and desperation to find accommodation. Each time some new issue arises and I feel that I am fighting against an irresistible curse determined to hinder everything I do.  

	In reaching for some opportunities here, I wanted to show just how much passion gripped me, how fiery and intense a furnace I have inside me. I thought that, finally after so long, the opportunities would show themselves and I could present my innermost writhing political, intellectual, and musical passions to someone who could understand them. This has not happened and the wind points away from it happening. I am of no more consequence here than I’ve ever been, trusting beyond reason that someday, somehow someone would truly hear me, and take some interest in the sounds I’ve known for so long that I have contained inside. Trust not in Hope, it is remorseless Time’s wicked jester.

	In this “hoping” I also wished to find, finally, someone to love fully—someone who truly knew me. Every face I see, every couple I see embrace each other, every pair of eyes I meet is a cutting reflection back at me that I am not much more than a ghost whose life’s sojourn has been one long narrative of demise from start to his now approaching end. Time has added certainty and the days here have steadily confirmed that the world would always be unforgiving if I should hope or reach for what others seemed to enjoy so effortlessly. They would doubtless say it wasn’t so easy, but, for my part, any jewel is rare to he who can never find them or worse lacerates himself looking. 
	I knew the insidiousness of the curse was that the seeking was so wickedly instinctual, so natural in others, but for me would only ever bring pain and despair. Gradually, I’ve realized that I was not for being loved, yet… I positively burned with verve and volcanic passion. This was sinister paradox. I cannot win love on my own merits as others can. No, I can’t have that. I can only pay for some simulation and pretend for a few moments that I might have a small chance at the normal warm fulfillment others expect so implicitly. 

	There is no more lacerating malady than loneliness and the years are have scarred me. I am ready to be finished. I expect this to be my last year and I don’t desire to fully live it out. I should continue here for a while longer at least, for some honor’s sake, to make my efforts worthwhile—but only so far, since I am not worthwhile. At this writing, my melancholy is deepened know that I have few means to do so at present. Perhaps some courage will seize me when I return home in a month or so, and I can hang myself then. Or is there more dignity in a gunshot to the head? Can it really matter? On the other side of either are the people I’ve known in my life who will find it utterly inexplicable… yet none of them knew me, so what explanation could any of them really proffer. 
	
	Some liked me, some didn’t; some laughed, some listened, some ignored, some tried, but I was never truly known to anyone. I am sure now that I was only ever a Stranger who is now preparing to exit. If had one person to truly love, who I knew to the deepest core of my being loved me because they actually knew me, I would devote to them such passion and intensity and affection that no other could match. Yet, here is the fatal irony: I, who could do so wholly and all-consumingly, have no one to love. I will seek the impossible no longer. My comfort is that each day is one closer to the final respite, the solace of non-being.”

While I read this, tearfully, a reminder popped up on his iPad. It read: YOU CANNOT BE LOVED. I discovered that he had set a reminder which read this message to pop up every hour, quarter of an hour, and half hour. This discovery after reading the above entry, and several others besides, was almost unbearable. And subsequent  discoveries were to pile on. 

Later that day, he received a text from a person I didn’t recognize—whose name will of course remain anonymous—asking in rather broken English if he was going to answer. I explained the gist of the situation as to this person as delicately as I could and I found out that she was an escort he had a sexual liaison with recently. I arranged to meet her for coffee the next day. Believe me when I say that it was one of the most difficult things I’ve ever done. Before we met, I couldn’t help but go through his messages to her. I could barely read them for the tears in my eyes. 

First I have to jump to the coffee with this girl (she’s definitely in her twenties and is quite beautiful) to properly contextualize his final message to her that, added to everything else, nearly broke me. Please note what follows is written with sober and discretion, and hopefully tact:

We met the next day for coffee, as arranged, and she discreetly described their encounter together. It was a two hour liaison and she apparently wanted to keep in touch with him afterwards, so they exchanged personal phone numbers. She told me she even had him enter his number into her phone. I think mistook this for a desire to become closer, since apparently they had shared an intimate and tender sexual encounter. She said he was very warm and charming, courteous and delightful, that he seemed to only be interested in the intimacy of caressing her and the intensity of kissing and close contact. 

She said, “he really just wanted to hold me.” I think it was the only sexual encounter he had ever experienced. She said that he texted to asked to meet again one night to which she said she was on her period, implying that this would prevent a pleasurable sexual encounter. He replied: “The thing that matters to me is looking into your eyes, kissing you, and holding you. Everything else doesn’t matter nearly as much to me” and “However, I don’t want you to do anything you’re uncomfortable with, so it’s fine to hold off. What matters is your willingness. My offer was really just a way of saying that I think about you, and have really every night since we met.” 

Apparently he sent her the following text when they were discussing meeting a second time the next night: 

	“I would like to be crystal clear: Are you coming as a friend who wants to spend time with me? If it is the former, I would be positively exuberant to meet tonight. If the latter, I’d rather not meet and I will compensate you for your time I’ve wasted with my texting. 

	I actually want to get to know you, and I want to spend time with you that doesn’t have a price tag. I’m so far below your league it’s laughable, even immeasurable, and I gather from your instagram that we are distinctly different—I’m an academic and I live for what I do, ie politics and intellectual pursuits, with unremarkable and unattractive physician looks. Meanwhile, you have the radiant face that could launch a thousand ships and, it seems, the enviable lifestyle of a star… with a personal manner so warm and comforting it rivals the angels. But, that’s what intrigued me. The more I’ve thought of it, the more I’ve wanted to lose myself in that “difference” and looking into your eyes. 

	The chemistry it felt like we were building towards the end of our first, and now only meeting has been something that has closely occupied my mind and confounded me, but it was a question I wanted answer holding you, to expand it, and revel in it. The thought of truly getting to know each other, of you sharing more of you, and being able to share so much more about myself with a demigoddess was invigorating. However, as a client, I realize that hoping for this was entirely my mistake. No one could be more painfully aware than I of the fact that there are more suitable men with which, I’m sure, you’d much rather spend your time. Nevertheless, I remain grateful that you did share some of it.

	Going forward, I will always answer your texts. However, I do understand if this is the end of our connection. I hope you will think it gracious if I put a £5 premium on every message I’ve sent to you in recompense for your wasted time. By my count, this currently comes to £195. Below you should find a link from my Cashapp with the requisite compensation. Should you wish to text me in future, I will gladly compensate you for any of my replies. Please accept this small offering as a token of my deep contrition for having foolishly hoped for something above my station and inflicting myself on your time.

	With affection, always.”


It’s the scrupulous courtesy coupled with the overtly lacerating desire for intimacy and to be loved, that’s practically leaping from the words with unbridled emotion, that really, *really* grieves me. He could be ice cold and repressed, and alternatively grippingly witty and absolutely hilarious—a positive delight. But… I think no one, NO ONE realized much less understood just how vast, how turbulent was the ocean of passion and intensity that he had inside him… that he so desperately wanted to share. I’m sure that he died bereft, heartbroken and lacerated by many, many years of loneliness and mental isolation.

To describe him fully is simply impossible—only being around him was enough to do anything resembling justice to his personality on that score. Perhaps people overuse the word *tragedy*, after all every death is a tragedy to someone. Concious of my own bias, I truly, *truly* feel that his death is a tragedy that no one will ever fully realize. I wasn’t in the same field as him, but we shared professors and academic mentors, and I remember having a conversation with two of them once just before leaving as a undergrad. 

They agreed that the thought he was actually a genius, one said he was probably a polymath: He spoke three languages—and understood Latin. He was a multi-awarded classical pianist, having been awarded best in the state three years in a row in UIL during high school and he composed dozens and dozens of his own works; I’m not a music aficionado but I’m not illiterate and they sound like very convincing derivatives of Brahms, Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev and Bartok. His field was politics and history, and he had *immense* political charisma and a highly driven, shrewd political mind to match it. He could seem like he was an expert on anything. I can remember times when he held faculty members around him in a debate circle—these are prideful professors, mind you—most of them silent in the face of his argument, which used some historical fact-bite no one knew about or some insight from an unrelated subject that cut to the heart of the discussion. 

He could quote Machiavelli word for word and, for instance, how the *Discourses on Livy* applied point by point to some country’s historical trajectory, then describe how some English legal mechanism from the 12th century no one knew about undergirded all of Anglo-American democracy (that was one of his special subjects), then muse about the latest developments in theoretical physics and how they applied to some age-old philosophical conundrum, then talk for hours about how leitmotifs interact in a Wagner opera, *then*, if there was a piano around, play something that, unless he told you he was just improvising, you might easily mistake for something by Brahms. All the while, when he looked at you, there was fire and verve and magnetism in his eyes. Coupled with his razor-sharp wit and sense of comedic timing, he was a formidable person. 

He was some you just knew was going to end up ‘great’, someone for whom the oft used *brilliant* truly applied. And yet… even with all this… his family and friends, and, I think, the world has lost him. He was going to go work in the United States senate after finishing his postgrad study in London and I think he would have at least have been a congressman in a few years, and likely a senator soon after. He certainly was a sort that we haven’t seen in generations. I think he was a Renaissance man who, in another life, might have been Lorenzo the Magnificent in Florence or in another age, a cultured enlightened despot. That’s grandiose, I concede, but it’s the sort of impression he left on all of us which, as the family, myself, and his friends and those who knew him grapple with the aftermath of his loss, is driving me crazy with grief. 

At any rate, as I led with, I just wanted to share this as a small anonymous elegy for him and help myself along to cope. I’d welcome any thoughts on what I’ve shared. I don’t plan to leave this post up for too long. ",10,1730319026.0,SuicideBereavement,3,0.92,False
