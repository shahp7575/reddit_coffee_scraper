1gmjcsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gmjcsc/worried_about_wifes_weed_use/,Worried about wife’s weed use,"Hey all. I (40M) and my wife (38F) have been together for 14 years (married for 9 of them). We have two children 7 and 8 years old.

About 2 years ago she had a partial hysterectomy and was given some pretty heavy pain killers after. She didn’t want to stay on them very long since addiction runs in her family and they were giving her an upset stomach. So she switched to smoking weed and taking regular over the counter Advil. She has some pretty intense trauma in her past. She had been on a fairly high dosage of Sertraline (SSRI) for the past 12 years or so to manage depression, rage and anxiety issues.

After her surgery when she was smoking a lot, she decided to quit the sertraline cold turkey. A combination of that and the large amounts of weed she was smoking caused her to have a manic episode where she was sleeping less and less and talking really fast about all these grand ambitions and then it got really bad one night where she thought I had poisoned the air in our house and drones from China were spying on her, she ended up in inpatient care for like a week.

Afterwards she was crazy depressed for months, it was hard for her to get out of bed and she wanted to die most days. She was working with a therapist and they were trying to get her balanced out for around a year (they originally gave her a soft bipolar 1 diagnosis, but never officially since she hasn’t had any other manic episodes and thought her first one was likely substance induced). They tried a variety of mood stabilizers and antidepressants. She’s now back on sertraline and is doing much better.

Over the past few months she has started smoking weed again and it’s now to the point where she is smoking all day every day (smokes in the AM with her coffee and then periodically throughout the day, not a ton, but usually noticeably high). Her therapist that she had been meeting with weekly recently quit or was fired from the clinic she worked at and so my wife hasn’t seen anyone for a few weeks now.

I’ve expressed to her all the reasons I don’t think it’s particularly wise for her to be smoking so much: impact on her mental health. I don’t feel like I can count on her to help with things like picking up the kids from school, so it all falls on me. She isn’t open about it and sneaks around to smoke, which feels icky to me. She doesn’t feel present, I don’t feel connected to her. I’m not particularly attracted to her when she’s high, so our sex life has basically ended. She manages several rental properties that we own, and sometimes has to make fairly important and impactful decisions about them, and it’s hard for me to trust her with that when she’s high. She tends to isolate herself and spends a lot of time in her office avoiding me and our kids when she’s high. Along with several other lesser reasons for why I wish she would cut back.

When I talk to her about it, she tells me that she totally understands how I’m feeling, and then nothing changes. This isn’t sustainable to me and  I’m not sure how much longer I can stay in this relationship if something doesn’t change. We have a couples counselor we see occasionally, we spent our entire last session talking about this and the therapist general vibe I got from her was “some people smoke a lot and it isn’t a problem, you guys have to decide how much is ok”. I feel very lost and alone. I’d love any guidance, resources or advice anyone can give me.

TL;DR my wife has started smoking weed all day everyday and I worry she is addicted. It’s having a negative impact on our family and our relationship. How do I proceed?",1,1731074930.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

I was furious at him for leaving such dangerous setups around his wife and baby. He defended himself by saying I am an adult and not the baby, and therefore He felt safe in leaving it there. He has often placed coffee there when I am not on the bed and I have often fought the urge to tell him not to. But he is such grandiloquent smart ass that I feel scared in starting any debates, and so never criticized his negligence. But today i was on the bed and he placed the coffee as usual and it burned my hand. 

He thinks I am overacting. I am in so much pain right now and this makes me so mad. Not even once has he apologized for holding even the slightest flavor of responsibility in this case. I am the clumsy wife who falls over things.

1gmjbvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1gmjbvg/entj_infj_relationship_long_distance_language/,ENTJ & INFJ Relationship + Long Distance + Language Barrier = Disaster?,"I'm (40 m ENTJ) involved with a woman (40 f INFJ) in a long distance relationship. We met about 8 years ago in my home country and had a couple of nice dates before she returned home to Japan – but kept in touch since then because we shared many similar interests and had the same taste.

Fast forward to this year in March when I travelled to Japan for a visit and had planned to catch up for a coffee and a chat. Of course, we ended up becoming attached and decided to try a proper relationship. Everything was amazing.. I travelled back there for another week in May (staying at her house) and came back recently to stay with her for 3 weeks.

\*\*I'm trying to make this as short as possible as I tend to write way too much – so hopefully this all makes sense and is engaging to read (I feel like I'm sounding more like an INFJ lol). 

In July (after the second trip) my gf out of nowhere asked me if we could stop chatting so much (throughout the day – both matching each others energy) which caught me off guard and kind of made me freakout a little. She kind of backed off and cut off communication for about a week or two until I could finally talk on the phone and explain how it made me feel. She seemed shocked that it was causing me any anxiety (i've heard that sometimes during an episode of withdrawing, some INFJ's can lose their sense of empathy?)

Anyway we got through it and at this stage she told me about INFJ and that I should read about it (a warning I guess?) and asked me to do an MBTI test which was no problem for me. The next couple of months were a bit of a rollercoaster with her being her happy self and withdrawing to recharge batteries. One peculiar thing was that I really wanted to understand her – but increasingly when I would ask about her feelings, or her life in general she would become more and more irritated. To the point of where I would be afraid to ask “how was your day?” by the time September came along.

In general – at around the 6 month mark anybody regardless of personality type will show their true self in a relationship. So I'm really struggling with holding onto the girl that I knew for 8 years – or accepting the possibly true version that came out once she was comfortable in a relationship? She seems to be extremely avoidant (I asked her to take an attachment test during a rough time and she got pretty angry). I've tried my best to stay positive no matter what.. which got me thinking that maybe accepting the bad behaviour means that it's acceptable? Maybe I should have been harsher – to show consequences? But that would be manipulative and my true feelings are that I love her and don't want to play games like that, I'm trying to be accepting and understanding.

The worst part about it was after the September trip (in which she expressed plans to find an apartment for us, and took me to meet her mother.. which is a big deal in japan) – about a week later I felt comfortable enough to ask on a Saturday night “are you getting upto anything cool tomorrow?”. Big mistake. Her texts changed from english to rapid-fire japanese sentences.. after translating they were “I hate this question” “why do you always ask this question” etc. And nothing has been the same since. I should have givn her space to cool off after this – but I was so shocked I tried my best to talk things through for the next 30 days.. only to be left on seen and disregarded.

I have a pretty severe situation with abandonment from childhood so the giving space thing is difficult. Anyway – I somehow managed to give her 5 days of space this past week and she finally agreed to have a chat last night. It started out well – and I had planned to take it easy. Her replies were all cold one worded replies with periods “ok.” “thanks.” so that would indicate a pretty dark mood. Of course after a month of not being able to communicate in a dialogue, I kinda slipped up and sent maybe 6 paragraphs worth of feelings... to which I got a reply of “you know I hate too much texting” and the famous “i'm tired”. It took me a while to realise that “i'm tired” from her doesn't mean sleepy.. I always was confused because it would be 5pm or something sometimes when she would say tired lol.

Anyways I've probably missed a lot of context or important points but my main point is: is it possible to save this relationship? I've tried things that would normally appeal to INFJs (trying to initiate deep conversations, being supportive and kind.. but they all seem to be rejected as if I've betrayed her trust, cheated or murdered a family member). I'm really stuck on how to get things back on track...

She has bounced back from dark periods like this before and it's been great... but I'm not sure if I can survive this happening over and over again if it becomes a habit. It's heart-breaking. I plan on giving her a week's silence from today. From what I can gather from the very limited information she's given me – is that she has been in training for a new job this past month. So I'm hoping once training is over she will come back to being normal? But if this is how she reacts to stress in life... I love her dearly, but I'm not sure if I'd even be 'allowed' to try and support her as a partner. Towards the 'end' of our relationship (I'm probably in denial but I feel like being broken up with over asking ""how was your day"" isn't fair) she expressed a couple of things repeatedly like “I'm bad for you” “I'm a selfish person” but I just took them as throwaway messages.

If you have any advice I'd love to hear it. Primarily I'll try to give more space.. not send any huge text messages. Maybe just send some photos as nice memories? I've tried being super nice – which doesn't seem to register. Early on I tried gifts and flowers which were all rejected.. I was even scolded for ordering flowers for her birthday. I'm assuming the rejections of gifts and things are more a result of the cause of the avoidant attachment so that's a whole other issue. But I imagine if an INFJ was damaged in a bad earlier relationship, then the last thing they would want is tokens from future relationships.

Just writing this it sounds like I'm delusional.. like this girl really must hate me. But then again, she took me to meet her mother.. was looking at apartments for us.. let me stay at her place for weeks even though INFJs need alone time. So there was some effort and love there. Perhaps 3 weeks living with a partner was just way too overwhelming and it caught up with her?

If you need clarification on anything, please feel free to ask away in the comments. I'd love to hear some INFJs opinions :) you help with this would be extremely valuable.. I feel like my mental health has taken quite a bashing through this.",1,1731074855.0,infj,0,1.0,False

1gmja1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1gmja1o/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

**Prologue: A Stitch in Time**

Mouse Capone never liked mornings. Especially not the ones that start with gunfire and a missing cup of coffee. The sun was still yawning over the Charles River, Boston's golden vein of history, when the trouble showed up. A letter slipped under the door of his cabin—not the kind delivered by hand, but the sort that travels across decades and dimensions, defying the usual rules of paper and time.

Minx, still half-asleep, snatched the letter before it could finish materializing. ""Another job?"" she asked, bleary-eyed but already scanning the parchment.

“Looks like it,” Mouse muttered, nursing his lingering headache. “Unless this is another invitation to a historical reenactment. I don’t trust them anymore after what happened in Milan.”

Minx didn’t respond right away. Her eyes narrowed as she reached the last few lines of the letter.

Mouse noticed her silence. “What is it? Pirates? Cursed artifacts?”

“Worse,” she said. “Time travelers.”

Mouse sighed. “Time travelers. Of course. Why not?”

### Time Travel is the Worst Kind of Trouble

There’s a unique kind of dread that comes with a job involving time travel. It isn’t the immediate threat of getting shot, blown up, or eaten by something prehistoric. It’s the insidious knowledge that every step you take could break something important. Maybe the wrong person lives when they shouldn’t. Maybe a great city falls because someone thought the pyramids would look better with a few more pointy bits. Or maybe it’s something smaller—a butterfly flaps its wings in ancient Rome and, three thousand years later, your favorite jazz club serves kombucha instead of whiskey.

Time travel screws with your peace of mind. And that’s why Mouse hated it.

The letter had come from a benefactor Mouse had dealt with before. A cryptic figure, always at arm’s length, offering the kind of paydays that made most jobs feel like errands. This one was no exception. The mission was laid out with chilling simplicity: **Stop Disgraced Former French Inspector Elephant and a team of thieves from stealing key historical artifacts.**

**The catch?** They were doing it across several centuries. Mouse and Minx would have to chase them through time, righting wrongs and fixing history as they went.

---

### Minx Always Had Good Instincts

Minx was already preparing their gear, setting down a sleek, polished device Mouse hadn’t seen before. “What’s that?”

“The Timekeeper,” she replied. “Got it from Lian. She owed me a favor.”

“Great. Now we’ve got a ticking clock in the form of an actual clock. And I bet it's not just counting down the seconds to our inevitable doom.”

“It’s a bit more sophisticated than that,” she said, giving him a look. “Keeps track of timelines, shifts, and—”

“—and the bad decisions we make,” Mouse cut in. “I get it.”

She smiled. “You’re in a good mood for a man who hates time travel.”

“I don’t hate time travel,” Mouse said, grabbing his favorite hat from the hook. “I just hate the time lag. That, and no one can resist meddling.”

---

### The Letter that Said Too Much

The letter’s last few lines lingered in Mouse’s mind as they left for the portal station.

**“Stop Inspector Elephant before he reshapes history in his image. And beware—he upgraded his eyepatch.”**

Mouse hadn’t seen Inspector Elephant in years. Not since that heist in the Alps. The memory of it flickered like a bad dream—Elephant losing an eye in the aftermath, a curse born from greed and poor timing. Now, the Inspector was out to rewrite history itself.

As Mouse and Minx stepped through the portal into 1775 Boston, the air shifted with the smell of gunpowder and revolution. They weren’t just chasing criminals anymore—they were chasing shadows across centuries. Shadows that could change the world.

The Timekeeper hummed in Minx’s hand, glowing faintly.

“Let’s go steal some history back,” Mouse said, cracking his knuckles.

“Before it steals us,” Minx added with a smirk.",1,1731074471.0,hdfidelity,0,1.0,False

Episode 12: Aftermath: Revenge of the Telethon

A riff from an electric guitar opened the episode, the scene fading into a close-up of a spinning blue globe. As the camera moved up across Africa and Europe, the words 'TOTAL' and 'DRAMA' appeared in white block letters with a flash, moving up at an angle to make room for 'WORLD TOUR' in two additional rows of larger letters. One final word, 'AFTERMATH', appeared below it in a shower of stars, and as the theme music reached a tentative low the gleam from the words took over the whole screen.

Clip 1

""I understand, and I really am sorry about how I've been acting as of late,"" Eva told them. ""I promise you all that I'll be-""

""We're outta time!"" Chris interrupted with a smile, shoving a parachute pack into Eva's arms then pushing her over to the open doorway. ""So long and good night!"" He left her there balanced precariously, and walked away with a smile on his face.

""Don't let those other teams break you guys apart!"" Eva demanded her former teammates, and then the wind caught her from behind and pulled her away and out into the open air.

The new Aftermath logo appeared again, its gleam taking over the screen again to transition to the next clip.

Clip 2

""Chill out, I'm going,"" Chase replied with a glare, slipping the pack on and walking towards the open door on the side of the plane. He waved to his former teammates with a happy grin. ""I’ll catch you all later!""

With a whoop of excitement, he backflipped into the open air, his final shout of ""SKYDIVING RULES!"" heard by all four standing in the elimination chamber with their eyes locked on the door.

The new Aftermath logo appeared again, its gleam taking over the screen again to transition to the next clip.

Clip 3

""Drop of Shame's that-a-way. You can let yourself out,"" Chris informed the tanned girl.

Anne Maria glared at him and grabbed the parachute from Chef's hands. ""Caleb, I want you and Topher to win for me, you hear?"" Caleb nodded while waving goodbye to Anne Maria before she jumped off the plane.

The shot immediately cut outside to Anne Maria landing on the beach a couple feet below the doorway. ""It's not the same without the scream,"" Chris said as he and Chef looked out from the elimination room.

""Oh shut up,"" Anne Maria denied and walked away from the jet.

""You're welcome,"" Chris called out.

(Theme Song)

The Aftermath's short introductory animation repeated itself once again, this time eliciting a roar of applause from the in-house audience as the scene cut to the studio. Several changes had been made to the stage since it was last seen, the least of which was the removal of the second guest couch. The central big screen TV displayed the show's title, and was now joined stage left by another hanging monitor displaying a few dollar signs against a reddish starburst design on a pale pink background. At the bottom of the second display was a row of empty boxes, seven of them the same size with two smaller ones raised up at the right end.

Below the second display was the Peanut Gallery, who now sat at two raised tables. Ripper, Geoff, Justin, and Trent were in the top row; Millie, Sadie, and Katie in the bottom. There appeared to be an old rotary telephone sitting in front of each former contestant.

Standing at center stage were Damien and Priya, and they were dressed much more formally than usual; the nervous wreck was in a golden yellow tuxedo, while the reality TV fan was wearing a light blue dress that fell to her knees.

""Good evening!"" Damien greeted with a happy smile. ""I'm Damien, and this is my amazing cohost, Priya!"" Priya waved at the camera.

""We're coming to you live,"" Priya said, her smile fading into a more serious look, ""because we need your help to raise some money for a really worthy cause.""

""You're probably wondering what we're raising money for,"" Damien continued. ""Well think back to the last episode when the Total Drama jet tragically crash landed in Jamaica.""

""A tragedy that could've been avoided if they'd just had more gas!"" Priya told the audience. ""But, Chris decided to blow the season's budget on himself instead.""

""And a gold-lined hot tub is not worth it,"" Damien added with a disgusted look. ""Unless we raise money for a refueling, our friends could all be stuck in Jamaica forever!"" The camera zoomed in on him dramatically as the audience gasped.

""All of Total Drama could be canceled,"" Priya added with a concerned look. ""And that means us, too! Which is why tonight, we're bringing you...""

""Total Drama the Telethon!"" Damien finished as the screen cut to a logo reading ""TDWT TELETHON"" in two lines of big block letters, the top green and bottom white. It was set against a pink-and-purple flowery background adorned with stars and music notes, and the screen quickly star-wiped back to the studio as the crowd applauded.

""The phone lines are open,"" Priya said as she and Damien were on the central couch and the telephone number '1-800-555-5555' displayed on the bottom of the screen. ""So please,"" she pleaded, ""for the show we all love, call now and donate."" Another round of applause went up, and the hosts stood up.

""Please welcome our first special guests,"" Damien said with a glance at stage right. ""The Drama Brothers!"" he announced the band as the shot cut to the three boys and sasquatch. Ripper was on the left holding a keytar, Justin had a tambourine, Trent was center-right with his guitar, and Sasquatchanakwa was furthest right with a keyboard. The four smiled and waved at the camera and audience, who cheered them on.

The shot cut to the three girls in the bottom row of the Peanut Gallery, Sadie and Katie standing up and squealing while Millie simply smiled.

The song opened with a close-up of the keytar as Ripper began to play, his bandmates joining in with claps punctuating the beats. The camera quickly pulled back as Priya walked by in front of the band and began to sing.

“This show, you need to save! This show, you gotta tell! This show! That you caa~aare!” Priya sang in a low and mournful voice; as she repeated 'this show' a second time, she gestured to the big screen as, one by one, portraits of the remaining contestants appeared over the Telethon logo – Topher, Jasmine, Gwen, Rodney, and Heather in the top row; Sky, Caleb, Sam, and Scott in the bottom.

“Jamaica, they're trapped down in! Jamaica, they can't even, Ja-party! It's so unfair!” Damien joined in, the image of the cast fading into a map of the island they were on. On the second 'Jamaica', it cut to Damien standing in front of a green screen playing a montage of clips from the season: the turbulence in both classes that had preceded the plane crash; Chase, Gwen, and Millie running through the pyramid in Egypt; the cast falling into New York harbor; Team Warrior screaming as scarab beetles swarmed around them; Team Explosive standing on an ice bridge and having it crumble beneath them.

“You gotta help now, we're on the brink!” Priya added, appearing next to her boyfriend as the montage continued: the bear brandishing its chainsaw in the Louvre; the giant sewer alligator coughing up Team Warrior's boat.

“The crew gets fired, if this ship sinks!” Damien's line was accompanied by clips of Scott getting electrocuted by eels; then the jumbo jet's disastrous landing in front of the Eiffel Tower.

“So make a difference, in their lives!” As Priya sang, Brick was shown falling to the unnamed beach; Izzy was shown falling after singing her line; Chase was shown evading the animals while trying to drive his golf cart through the Louvre; and Ripper was shown getting his tongue frozen to the flagpole.

“Give us cash or this show dies!” The two hosts sang the line together as they and the montage were temporarily replaced by an angled shot of a wheeled filing cabinet overflowing with cash.

“Saaaave this show, Total Drama!” Priya sang, the montage resuming but the telethon number replacing the hosts on-screen. Gwen was shown translating the Newfoundland language; Team Explosive was shown dangling from the icy cliff in the Yukon again; then Team Super were shown tumbling forward end-over-end after their sausage sled exploded in their ride down the Alps. Priya appeared on-screen towards the end of her line.

“Saaaave this show, you know you wanna!” Damien sang as his girlfriend bobbed her head and the montage continued: Eva beating Heather in the slap dance challenge; Team Warrior looking at their props for the commercial. Damien appeared on-screen.

“Save the show that you loo~oove~!” The hosts sang together as behind them the plane landed in the Amazon; then Chase getting attacked by piranhas after dropping off the zipline into the Amazon River.

“Saaaave this show, Total Drama!” Priya repeated after she and Damien faded away, the montage showing the cast fleeing for their lives as Machu Picchu crumbled around them; the slap-dancers getting shocked all at once as their practice ended; Team Warrior getting cornered by the fake Zing-Zings; and the crashed plane on the Jamaican beach at sunset.

“Saaaave this show, so call the number!” Damien continued as the next few clips were shown: the cast being unceremoniously dropped out of the cargo bay door they'd gathered on; Chris's fishing boat approaching the cast treading water in the North Atlantic; and the final jazz hand-filled shot from the very first musical number of the season.

“Save the show with loo~oove, and five hundred thousand dollars!” Priya and Damien sang together as they faded back on-screen; the montage ended with a rising shot of the plane used in the first musical number before it faded into a beating red heart set against orange, yellow, and green rays. The heart faded away as well, getting replaced by a dollar sign.

""Save the show, guys. Just give us some dough. Give us some love and some dough,"" Damien finished as his sorrowful head took the place of the dollar sign, the host fading away again. The scene star-wiped to the TDWT Telethon logo and telephone number as the music wrapped up and the crowd went wild.

The scene cut to the Peanut Gallery as Blaineley walked onto stage. ""That's right,"" she told the camera. ""You need to give us five-hundred-thousand dollars in the next half-hour."" The shot moved in for a close-up, then she smiled. ""Hi, I'm Blaineley Stacey Andrews O'Halloran,"" she introduced herself. ""And I'm your co-host!""

""I thought you were the roving reporter,"" Priya said, earning a gasp from the audience as Blaineley scowled.

She quickly resumed smiling, however. ""I'm thrilled to be here tonight, co-hosting with Priya and Damien,"" she told the camera.

""I thought she was going back to Celebrity Manhunt,"" Priya whispered aside to her boyfriend.

""She tried,"" Damien whispered back, ""but they wouldn't let her.""

The camera cut back to Blaineley. ""I'll keep you posted on the total as your calls and your cash,"" she winked and the telephone number appeared again, ""pour in. This is the number,"" she looked down at the on-screen text. ""Call now, we have gifts!""

""For a donation of only twenty-five dollars,"" Priya said as the screen was taken over by a rotating reddish-orange sunburst pattern as a certain packet of disgusting snack foods spun into view, ""you'll get a commemorative box of delicious and nutritious Yummy Happy Go-Time Fishtails!"" The crowd applauded, and the short girl quickly and quietly added ""Strictly decorative, do not eat, may not be legal in all provinces, keep out of reach of children.""

""And for fifty dollars,"" Damien added as the screen flipped around to a close-up of a scrawny white person wearing a dull blue t-shirt emblazoned with Chris's face, ""you'll get a special commemorative Total Drama T-shirt! Sure, it looks like a plain tee,"" he added as the audience cheered, ""but when you get it wet,"" he paused to chuckle as the shirt was splashed with water, causing it to shrink and the Chris head's colors to run, ""it becomes a wet t-shirt...yeah."" His last word was considerably less impressed.

""If you get a busy signal,"" Blaineley said as the scene cut back to her, ""keep trying! You'll get through eventually!""

The shot cut to the fully-stocked Peanut Gallery where not a single telephone was ringing. The seven teens manning them looked around with a mixture of boredom and awkwardness.

""If awesome viewers like you don't start donating,"" Damien told the camera dramatically, ""ASAP, then every one of us will be fired! And for our friends in Jamaica, the nightmare will really begin.""

""Our goal tonight is five-hundred-thousand dollars,"" Blaineley repeated, now holding a clipboard. ""And thanks to your donations, so far we've raised a grand total of..."" The shot cut to the donation counter hanging above the Peanut Gallery; it's numbers started rolling up, and stopped with a ding on...0s across the board.

""Nothing?!"" Blaineley announced in shock, the audience gasping in shock as well.

""You've got to be kidding!"" Damien exclaimed in shock and annoyance of his own.

He palmed his face, and the camera panned slightly to focus on Priya. ""Let's welcome our first guest,"" she told her boyfriend, ""and encourage her fans to call in!""

""Good idea!"" Damien said, happy again. ""She spent most of her time being upset about her team placing second most of the time,"" he told the camera as it focused on him, ""and ended up being eliminated early again, it's Eva!""

Both hosts stood up and clapped along with the audience as the muscle woman walked out on stage with a wave.

""So great to see you, Eva!"" Priya said, giving her former teammate a handshake after she walked over between the hosts. ""Why don't you tell us about the gifts you've brought for people who donate in your name!""

""Of course,"" Eva said. ""Every donation you make tonight earns you a raffle ticket towards weightlifting lessons from me!""

""I bet there's a lot of people out there who'd love to win that!"" Damien said with a wink at the camera.

The shot cut to the Peanut Gallery where all seven telephones were now ringing and being answered. ""Wow, I guess Eva has a lot of fans,"" Priya said.

“After the first season, I’m not surprised,” Eva said.

""Yeah,"" Blaineley corrected, ""Katie and Sadie are talking to each other, and Ripper's talking to his mother.""

The camera cut to Ripper as he said ""Make sure to barricade the house so that none of my fans break through and try to steal my cash.""

""Which means our new fundraising total is,"" Blaineley said in annoyance with a look towards the donation tracker. It rolled up again, and stopped with a ding on 703 dollars exactly. ""Seven-hundred and three dollars!"" Blaineley announced. ""And two-hundred of that came from Ripper's dad in exchange for the two of them going fishing together,"" she added with a roll of her eyes.

""It's worth it to keep the show alive,"" Ripper said to the camera.

""Thanks for that,"" Damien said. ""But we've still got a long way to go,"" he turned and told the camera. ""Seriously, this show puts me on the map. I can't let it go now!""

""Maybe Ripper had the right idea,"" Priya said with a thoughtful smile. ""How would you guys like to see an episode of Total Drama Fugitives?"" she asked the audience. She looked up at the big screen, which now displayed wanted posters of Izzy and MK. ""If you're interested, then call in! We won't show you any more until we hit ten thousand dollars!""

The phones were shown ringing again, and the hosts grinned. ""Awesome!"" Damien said in anticipation. ""All you Izzy and MK fans, keep calling in!""

""They're still MIA,"" Priya said. ""Or are they,"" she added dramatically.

The sound of the donation tracker rolling up moved the camera's attention to Blaineley. ""Ten thousand! Look, we just hit ten thousand!"" she exclaimed as the audience cheered, and the shot changed to the tracker to show it reading $10,000.00 exactly.

""First, the latest sighting of Izzy,"" Priya said, ""Allegedly, still on the plane.""

The clip opened to a close-up of a rat eating a hunk of cheese. The camera panned out and to the right to show a Izzy-shaped shadow curled up on a stack of crates, sound asleep.

The plane shook, and the wild child was thrown to the floor with a grunt.

The audience gasped as the shot returned to the studio. ""How about everyone's favorite tech genius?"" Damien said. ""Loyal fans have sent in hundreds of MK sightings. Tonight, we're gonna show you our two best leads.""

""If you're a MK fan and think these are real sightings, let us know with a donation,"" Priya added. ""Our first clip comes from Scotland, so let's take a look."" She looked up at the big screen as it cut to static once more.

The clip opened to blurry footage of a vaguely MK-shaped figure walking through a golf course... only to be hit in the head and knocked out by a golf ball.

""That had to be MK,"" Priya said.

""MK on a golf course and not making a snide comment?"" Damien asked disbelievingly. ""I'm not buying it. My clip on the other hand is real. Check it out!""

The next clip started with a shot of a familiar looking castle on the British Isles, before panning down to a large number of people wearing robes and scarves from a certain movie series about wizards.

The camera zoomed in on one Asian figure with black hair as she wrapped a purple scarf around her neck.

Another gasp issued from the audience as the shot cut back to the studio. ""Now that was MK,"" Damien said. ""What do the viewers think?""

""We've gotten hundreds of calls during the fugitive segments,"" Blaineley said as the camera moved to her. ""And their donations have added a whopping..."" The donation tracker was shown rolling up again, and stopped at a less-than-dramatic $10,500.00. ""Five hundred bucks to our grand total,"" Blaineley said in a disappointed tone.

""Our next guest,"" Priya said as the camera cut back to her, ""is Total Drama's most daring player and reality TV show menace. It's Chase!""

The daredevil walked on stage to the sounds of the cheering audience and took a seat on the guest spot.

""Chase is here to auction off a special prize,"" Damien claimed. ""Every donation tonight earns you a raffle ticket toward…""

""Free classes with me about how to perform legendary stunts and massive wipeouts,"" Chase proudly said. The phones from the Peanut Gallery rang, but only Geoff and Ripper picked up their phones while the rest looked bored.

""Maybe we should spice up the deal,"" Damien told his girlfriend.

""I have an addition,"" Priya perked up. ""Chase can give those who attend the class free pizza and soda for after they finish."" Like before, only Geoff and Ripper were interested. ""But it's Chase. Everyone loves Chase.""

“That's not entirely true,"" Chase explained. ""I admit I do have friends back home, but some people tend to hate me because of how much of an egomaniac I used to be.""

""You do have a point there,"" Priya nodded to him. “If I went to your school, I probably would've hated you.”

""There is something people like about Chase,"" Damien said to the viewers. ""His epic blunders.""

""Wait, what?"" Chase wondered.

""We've got clips of you slipping up, and we have to show them just to save the show,"" Priya explained.

""Play them,"" Chase said. ""Everyone here already watched the episodes anyways."" The camera zoomed in on the static TV screen.

The first clip had Chase admiring the panda moments before the panda landed on the boy's head and started to bite and punch him, causing him to yell in pain.

The second clip was of Chase's ball rolling around, only bouncing off a single bumper as it headed into the drain. The camera cut to it coming to a stop against the back wall, after which one half popped open and Chase slumped out onto the floor in scratches.

The third clip had Chase getting hit by the camel's tail.

The fourth clip was of Chase ziplining while using his pants as a t-bar without noticing the smoke coming from his clothing. His pants caught fire and were burnt to a crisp and he fell into the water, only to leap out seconds later and run to the other shore in order to avoid the snapping piranhas.

The fifth and final clip had Chase moving through the otherwise empty halls on the golf cart. With the sasquatch behind him, he was looking rather pleased until a monkey in front of him lunged at his head, leading to him being blinded and driving over the bear's feet.

The scene returned to Priya. ""I never knew you were such a butt monkey on the show,"" she said.

""I don’t mind a little pain and humiliation every once in a while,"" Chase said. ""As long as nobody takes a picture or video to blackmail me, I’ll take it all in stride.""

""I'd expect you to complain about being embarrassed, but you didn't,"" Damien smiled. ""You’re not the same person we met on the island.""

""You can thank character development for that,"" Chase said before facing the camera. ""If you join my daredevil class, I'll be giving out bikes from the motocross challenge two seasons ago! How about that?""

The seven former contestants grabbed their phones to call, and the donation tracker was raised to 50,000.00 ""We're up to fifty-thousand. It's not a hundred-thousand, but we're getting to our goal!"" Blaineley announced while the audience cheered.

""Priya, would it be okay if I use the bike you built for that challenge?"" Chase whispered to Priya. ""I can build my own bikes, but yours can be used as an example.""

""I got a new bike, so you can use that one,"" Priya agreed. ""You will have to consider that one a hand-me-down from me to you.""

""Let's just call it me borrowing from you. Hand-me-down makes us sound like we're related,"" Chase said, causing the audience to laugh.

""Keep on sending us your donations,"" Priya told the camera. ""We will see you after the break.""

(Commercial Break)

The episode resumed on the Aftermath's title screen, its theme playing as the words gleamed and the feed cut to the studio. The Peanut Gallery were busy answering calls, the phone number was on the screen, and the hosts were in the middle of a hushed conversation as the camera panned to them.

""I know you don't like it,"" Damien told his girlfriend, ""but I really think we're gonna have to break it out to get the money we need.""

""I know,"" Priya sighed. ""I was just hoping we wouldn't have to-what?"" she asked in a louder voice to someone off-screen. ""We're on?!""

The eyes of the two hosts went wide as they quickly turned their full attention to the cameras. ""And we're back, live!"" Damien said.

""Welcome back to the mother of all telethons!"" Priya greeted. ""Let's check in with Blaineley for our new total.""

The shot cut to the older woman who had her arms crossed and a haughty look on her face. ""I was wondering when you two would get to that. Drumroll please!"" She looked up at the donation tracker, which rolled up to $200,298.00.

""I can't believe it!"" Priya grinned as the audience began to cheer. ""We broke two hundred thousand!""

""Yeah,"" Blaineley said bluntly, ""too bad that's not even half of our goal.""

""So we have to raise three hundred grand?"" Damien asked incredulously. ""In ten minutes?!""

""Luckily, our next guest is bound to get the viewers ready to call in,"" Priya said confidently. ""I know I'm ready to bring her out. Please welcome the spray tanned queen, Anne Maria!""

""Hi! What’s good, everybody?!"" Anne Maria greeted as she walked out on-stage to the roar of the audience.

""Let's see Anne Maria's best moments from this season,"" Damien said, looking up to the big screen.

The screen cut to a montage of some of Anne Maria's moments, beginning with her biting on the core of the apple and dragging it back, only for a small turtle to jumped on her, her landing on an ice block, only for the floe to crack, leaving her in peril, and her and Caleb riding through the wooden ramp in their path and soaring through the sun.

The scene cut back to the studio as the audience applauded. ""You ranked lower this season than the last, but I can tell you made your time worth it,"" Damien said.

""Don't make my head swell up,"" Anne Maria responded.

""How did your elimination feel?"" Damien wondered.

""It felt meh. I was bound to be going home once I got myself injured. I just wish that I could’ve smacked Heather after realizing that she was the one who set up my injury and purposely tried to mess with me and Topher,"" Anne Maria admitted.

""Trust me,"" Priya said. ""I know. She is a monster.""

""Moving on,"" Damien said. ""Since this season's Total Drama is a musical, I thought it might be cool to have Anne Maria sing for us.""

""Makes sense,"" Priya said. ""The gifts clearly aren't working.""

""So if you want to hear Anne Maria sing, call now,"" Damien told the viewers.

""I sang enough on the show,"" Anne Maria said. ""Can't I perform some cheerleading moves so the viewers can be impressed?""

""Sorry, but no dice. They want you to sing,"" Damien reminded the Jersey girl.

""I'll sing a song, but you have to let me do the type of genre I want to sing instead of what you and the show want,"" Anne Maria gave in.

""Sure thing,"" Priya agreed.

""I know the fans are gonna be impressed by this,"" Blaineley smirked.

The song opened up to a dance pop tune, and Anne Maria walked over to the same part of the stage where Ripper sang his song at the last aftermath. Ripper was standing behind a DJ's turntable and bobbing his head to the beat.

“You think you got me good, okay maybe you did; I know you think you rule the game!” Anne Maria sang.

“But inside of you, I know there is a girl, whose style is gritty and lame!” She leaned directly into the camera as she sang, then the camera quickly cut to Ripper as he let out a 'Yeah!' after the line.

“You took advantage of my relationships, and trust me, it wasn't fun!” A painting depicting a grinning Heather descended next to her on the left as she added “Not one bit!”

“So you better enjoy being the queen while you can; 'Cause pretty soon you will be done!” She took out a pair of scissors and cut the strings holding the painting up, leading it to fall and be destroyed. The camera briefly cut to Ripper bobbing his head to the beat with a smirk on his face and saying “Yes!”

“Girlfriend, you know you goin' down, I'm tellin' you!; Girlfriend, you know you goin' down, get a clue!” The camera cut back to Anne Maria, who started shaking her hips and snapping her fingers.

“Girlfriend, you know you goin' down 'cause the rest will know what you're all about!”

“Girlfriend, you know you goin' down, that's what's up!” Anne Maria sang and adopted a sassy posture with a head shake.

“Girlfriend, you know you goin down, no trophy cup!” She spun 360° degrees, then pumped her fist into the air.

“Girlfriend, you know you goin' down, the rest will know what you're all about!” Anne Maria finished the song with a kick and performed an off pitch high note.

The camera cut to Katie's phone ringing in front of her, the music from the song still playing. Before she could answer it, Blaineley picked it up.

""Total Drama-"" Blaineley started to say before her eyes widened in surprise. ""You'll donate if she stops?""

""Well, Anne Maria's gonna keep holding that high note until we raise another hundred thousand dollars!"" Priya told the audience.

""Are you sure about this?"" Damien asked uncertainly.

""Totally,"" Priya said back confidently.

The camera cut back to the Peanut Gallery, where they literally could not answer the phones fast enough; then cut to the spinning total board.

""I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up!"" Anne Maria said in a panic and continued her high note.

""Anne Maria fans,"" Blaineley said as the shot cut back to the hosts, ""call in with your donation so she can stop singing! The bigger your donation, the sooner this will end!"" The camera panned to Damien starting to cover his ears and Priya smiling.

""Aaaaaand,"" Priya said with a hand raised, ""cut the music!"" she swiftly brought the hand down, and the music stopped.

The camera cut to Anne Maria, who had stopped singing. ""It's about time!"" Anne Maria said.

""I should totally call you in case I need some windows shattered,"" Ripper noted.

""What's the new total, Blaineley?"" Damien asked.

The shot cut over to the older woman who was smiling generously. ""Anne Maria's singing worked wonders, Damien,"" Blaineley said. ""We're up to three hundred and thirty-five thousand big ones!"" She looked up to the donation tracker, which rolled up to $335,000.00 total. ""And I know how we can get more.""

""If it will raise money, I'm fine with it,"" Damien promised.

""Okay. This guy has become popular with the female demographic ever since he joined the show…Caleb!"" Blaineley smiled at the big screen as Caleb was shown flexing his muscles with his eyes closed and his shirt removed. A distinctly feminine chorus was heard from the crowd.

""Wait a minute,"" Damien said to the screen. ""Caleb's popular with the ladies?""

""Uh huh,"" Blaineley replied. ""Audience research tells us that people loved seeing Caleb stray away from the handsome jerk stereotype and look pretty doing so.""

""That is true, but my eyes belong to Damien,"" Priya firmly turned away from the screen and closed her eyes. ""Not going to look.""

""Keep those donations coming, and I'll keep the entertainment coming,"" Blaineley promised. ""Priya, you have got to see this.""

The footage was shown again, showing Caleb surfing on the beach waters and giving the camera a charming smile that made the women in the audience go wild.

""Not paying attention,"" Priya denied the request, but turned her head around. ""Is the water,"" her left eye opened, ""making his body,"" her right eye opened, ""glow brightly?"" She couldn't hide her emotions anymore and she sighed at the scene.

The phones rang, and the seven Peanut Gallery teens answered; the current total stopped at 400,000.00.

""We're up to four hundred thousand dollars already! I hope you ladies enjoyed the fan service,"" Blaineley winked to the girls in the audience.

""So sorry about that, Damien,"" Priya apologized to her boyfriend.

Damien smiled back. ""No need. Caleb is an eye catcher, and you did try and look away.""

The two leaned in closer and kissed each other on the lips, making the audience feel touched.

""No! No kissing! Ugh, you ruined all the drama!"" Blaineley griped.

""There's something I have to do,"" Damien informed Priya. ""Introduce our last guest, and I'll be right back!""

Priya watched Damien run off. ""Our final guest is the only competitor in the history of Total Drama to get sidelined by injury.""

The TV showed Brick's many injuries; him being attacked by scarabs, him hitting his head on the plane and falling back down on his seat, and him getting crushed by the jet. Regardless, the audience members laughed in amusement.

""Fresh from intensive care, please welcome everybody's favorite cadet, Brick!"" Priya introduced.

The cadet walked out on the stage as the audience cheered, though he was now wearing glasses and he had his shorts and boots replaced with black pants and brown dress shoes.

""Greetings, carbon-based life form commonly referred to as ""Priya"","" Brick greeted Priya in his new advanced vocabulary before sitting down.

""How are you?"" Priya checked up.

""My health falls in acceptable parameters, thank you,"" Brick said. ""I am making satisfactory progress on my new time machine.""

""Well, that's great, and really cool,"" Priya supported the boy.

""I am also close to developing a coffee maker that will fit into the pockets of those older than 18,"" Brick added.

""Damien, are you done?"" Priya called out.

""Everything's good to go,"" Damien told her before seeing Brick. ""Hey Brick. Sorry about that plane crash.""

""Greetings, carbon-based life form commonly referred to as ""Damien"","" Brick greeted back. ""Your concern for well-being is not deplorable.""

""I don't understand most of what you said, and I'm good at my English classes, so I'll take that as a compliment,"" Damien smiled.

""Damien, where did the Peanut Gallery go?"" Priya asked when she saw no sight of them and Blaineley was sitting on the top half of the seats shrugging.

""You'll soon find out,"" Damien assured her. ""But first, it's time for a brand new Aftermath segment, Brain Blast!""

The scene transitioned to a spinning wheel; Eight slots were presented with yellow question marks, a big brain was in the center while six sticks of dynamite had its fuse go off. Eventually, the dynamite exploded and moved to the next scene of Damien locking Brick's arms and legs to the wheel with orange cuffs.

""Here's how Brain Blast works,"" Damien said before the camera zoomed out to show him, Priya, and Brick on top of a wooden ledge that was above the studio. ""You call in with donations, and we test Brick with skill-testing questions. The bigger the donation, the harder the questions. And just a heads-up, you're gonna want these questions to be extremely hard!""

The shot panned down to a tank filled with sewage water. ""I accept the skill testing challenge,"" Brick gave in. ""There's no question I haven't miscalculated or failed with.""

""As long as Brick or us aren't being threatened with sharks, I'll allow what's about to happen,"" Priya said.

""A fan from New York donated this disgusting liquid to us,"" Damien continued. ""One wrong answer from Brick, and his straps will unlock, dunking him in sewage water.""

""This seems to be a trivial waste of my very own mind, but I believe in challenging my enormous gray cells,"" Brick sniffed snootily.

""If you're a fan of water or skill-testing questions, you're a fan of mine. So call now!"" Damien announced while the phone number appeared again on screen, making Blaineley have to answer all of the ringing phones.

""Cool. Give him a spin, Priya!"" Damien told Priya.

Priya spun the wheel, making Brick spin around as well. ""Seventy-eight rotations per minute is marvelous!"" Brick commented.

""First question, geography,"" Priya read out when the wheel landed on a globe. ""Level of difficulty?""

""Major!"" Blaineley said. She was answering two phones and two other ones were wrapped over her arms.

""What's the capital of Uzbekistan?"" Damien asked the first question after pulling out a card and reading from it.

""Tashkent,"" Brick answered.

""Correct!"" Priya spun the wheel. ""Next question!"" The wheel stopped on currency symbols. ""Currency exchange. Difficulty?""

""Brutal!"" Blaineley said while answering the phones.

Damien took out another car. ""What's the equivalent of 2,789 in yen?""

""21,981,55.82,"" Brick correctly calculated.

""You're right,"" Priya complimented before spinning the wheel again. ""Next!"" It stopped on some complex equations. ""Math. Difficulty?""

""Impossible!"" Blaineley yelled as she held on all the phones.

""What's the square root of sixty-seven?"" Damien read.

""That would be 8.18535277187245,"" Brick quickly said the numbers.

""Correct,"" Priya clapped. ""Let's go to the next round.""

She spun the wheel again, but she may have done it with too much force, because the wheel and Brick rolled off the ledge and Damien and Priya gasped as Brick and the wheel crashed off-screen. Fortunately, Brick came out okay, but his glasses were gone.

Priya and Damien raced over to Brick. ""Are you okay, Brick?"" Damien wondered in concern.

“Why am I not wearing my boots?"" Brick mumbled as he looked at his feet. “Is this a formal occasion I wasn't informed about?”

""It seems like Brick has reverted back to his original personality from that crash,"" Priya noted.

""That's going to be a problem for the Peanut Gallery!"" Damien pointed to the seven members tied above the sewage water in a tank.

Brick was soon presented with a bomb shaped like an airplane. ""Is that a bomb?"" Brick questioned before an intern put a blindfold over his eyes. ""Hey, who blindfolded me?""

""The rules are simple. Brick has to defuse the bomb blindfolded as the Peanut Gallery are slowly lowered into the water,"" Damien stated.

""Brick, you have to defuse the bomb now!"" Priya begged desperately.

Brick knelt down and felt the bomb. ""I don't know how to defuse a bomb. I’ve never been taught how to by my drill sergeants.”

Damien and Priya, seeing that time was running out, ran away to take cover. When the time hit, the bomb exploded and unleashed a gray cloud that covered the screen. When the cloud dispersed, it unraveled the destruction around the studio. The TV was destroyed and had a Brick-shaped hole in the front, the seats were torn apart, the spotlight hangers were scattered, and sewage water was everywhere.

As for the people, they weren't looking good. Katie and one of the sharks were lying on the floor, Sadie and Justin were on the ledge, Millie, the other shark, Ripper, Damien, and Priya were scattered on the spotlight hangers, Trent was slumped over the TV, and Geoff hung on to the donation tracker.

""I have to say…that was awesome!"" Damien cheered as the camera focused on him and Priya.

""For the show, yes. But for us, no,"" Priya said.

""Did we reach our goal, Blaineley?"" Damien asked the older female.

The camera cut to Blaineley standing up from her seat. Her eyes were spinning and she was feeling delicious. ""Gimme... gimme the drum roll, ple-"" She didn't finish before slamming her head down.

A dramatic tune played as the tracker rolled up. With a musical flourish, it stopped at 500,000.01.

""Five hundred thousand dollars and one cent!"" Damien celebrated. ""We reached our goal, and it's all thanks to me knowing what the fans want, but not going all sadistic!""

""I congratulate you on your ideas,"" Priya said to him.

""Thanks to your support,"" Damien said, ""we all still have jobs, even Blaineley!""

""The show will go on!"" Priya told the camera. ""So be sure to tune in next time for the continuation of the world's greatest reality competition ever. Total! Drama! Woooorrrrlllddd~ Tooouuurrrr~!"" The usual blaring tune played as the camera zoomed out to show the entire stage again, the TV being detached and falling to the ground. The audience cheered wildly.

(Roll the Credits)

(Bonus Clip)

The clip opened up to Blaineley still in the destroyed studio as an intern swept up the mess. ""I'm a journalist, not a stuntman,"" Blaineley talked to someone on her phone. ""I didn't win a Pulitzer Prize mug just to be treated like some pathetic loser reality show competitor!” A female intern was shown passing by in the foreground and pushing Justin on a stretcher. “I've got standards! Get me out of this contract now!""

Blaineley ended the call and put her phone away. ""Unbelievable! Surrounded by amateurs.” She took out a handcloth and wiped her face with it, but it rubbed away her make-up, exposing her pale and pimply skin while the camera zoomed in on her, causing her to realize. “What are you doing? Show's over,” she said before looking both ways in horror. “We're, we're still on the air? Nooooooooo!""

1gmj54g,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1gmj54g/my_boyfriend_is_just_a_best_friend_to_me/,My boyfriend is just a best friend to me.,"I, 23F, have been dating my boyfriend, 22M, for almost 6 years. We were college sweethearts, meeting in the coffee shop outside our college. We have almost the exact same interests and hobbies, as well as the same level of empathy and intellect, so we clicked immediately. He came across as quietly confident and mysterious, which drew me to him but not in a romantic way. I had recently come out of a very abusive relationship as had no intentions of dating again. When he told he he loved me by the river after 2 months, I thought he was dominant (in a good way) and romantic... So I decided to take a risk and date him, though I didn't think we would last long because of my own mental health issues. I am his first girlfriend, first kiss, first for anything.

I worked hard at managing my bipolar and CPTSD from a rough childhood so that it wouldn't hurt or affect him negatively, and I ended up managing my illnesses incredibly well and still do - I have a naturally bubbly character so you'd never know if I was having an episode. While I was putting all my effort into bettering myself for him, I realised that his romantic, dominant confidence was a facade. On top of that, I realised how he seemed completely incapable of taking care of himself: his parents didn't bother instilling the idea of independence, or hygiene or responsibility.

I'm the eldest of 5 children and I had a hand in helping to raise and protect all of them, so I'm used to looking after others patiently. However, things took a turn when 4 years ago, I developed chronic illnesses. I have fibromyalgia and/or Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome which causes severe 24-7 pain, exhaustion, joint dislocations and so many more symptoms. I use a walking stick and a wheelchair, am mostly housebound and seriously struggle in day to day life. In addition, I have functional neurological disorder, which caused tics, tremors and major seizures. I had to learn to manage all these new issues, as well as still managing my mental health flare ups AND sill look after my boyfriend as though he was a child.

My boyfriend takes me out the house, pushing me in the wheelchair (I'm not heavy) twice a month and wipes my spit away when I'm having a seizure. For that, he's called an angel, a saint for 'putting up' with me.
I do 90% of the chores. I taught him how to cook, I taught him how to brush his teeth. I push for him to wear deodorant, brush his hair and not go out in dirty clothes. I manage our money because he's irresponsible with his, spending it all on snacks at the shop, but still push the importance of saving. I do everything I can think of to raise his self-esteem. I taught him self-soothing techniques and have never lost my temper with him. I gave him back scratches every night and smothered him with kisses and love, which he loves. I've never told anyone anything bad about him, no matter how upset I am. Yet, everyone, even my dad says they would 'run for the hills' away from me because of my conditions. I stayed in this relationship because of that fact, thinking no one else would ever bother with me because of my illnesses.

About 6 months ago, I lost feelings completely. I'm just tired of always looking after someone with no one to look after me. I told my boyfriend that I was loosing feelings and wanted a break or to break up, but he had a bit of a breakdown and straight-up refused, promising to do better. I can see he's finally trying to do more chores and getting therapy, but it's too late for me and he's now become quite smothering. Though, my parents like him more than they like me and I have no friends at all, so I have no one to help me here. My boyfriend lives with me, my dad and my brother. I don't have the energy left in me to fight him out.

So here I am - it's a bit pathetic, I know. I have no physical or intimate attraction to him and I often prefer to be alone than in his company, but I can't deny that we do laugh together, playing video games like best friends. I have no malice towards him, but I'm not interested in being his girlfriend anymore. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do now...",1,1731074337.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

Clips get clipped and get shortened and cropped, then you’re left with something said but out of context entirely. Like the title says, I’m glad Ethan is responding to Hasan and other accounts. 

Seeing clips in your own algorithmic bubble just fuels blind, mind numbing fervency. Tying that to politics and wars, of course both sides are going to be heated. Ethan taking the time to flesh out one sentence he or someone on the crew said removes the ignorant excuse. 

The internet, at least as it is right now, is powered by knee jerk reactions. The more reactive and over the top, the bigger the views and interaction. See LolCowLive being a thing at all as an example. So when this subreddit, and others that shall not be named, start raging at something E&K said Ethan takes the time and edits together a video explaining the context and showing a double standard. This is what a discussion looks like and it sucks that the discussion is taking place across YouTube videos and not on a zoom call or in person. 

This anonymous endless library that is the internet has entertained me for hours and taught me more than my ancestors could’ve learned in multiple lifetimes. It has even been a place where I’ve seen different peoples perspectives (Zach, hit the sound bite) and changed my way of thinking on topics I was wildly uneducated on. What the internet also affords us is the ability to hear a convo we don’t agree with, run up to the conversing couple, punch them in the face, and run away. Anonymity and moral grandstanding being the badges we quietly pin on our chest while peeking between the alphabetized books, hiding from the recipients of our cowardly knuckle sandwich. 

Own your shit. Apologize. Learn. Grow. Do better. Give people time to grow as well. What you already know might take someone awhile to grasp but that doesn’t mean they get to spew backwards ass takes in the meantime. 

I don’t know. I hope Ethan and the crew see this and know that there’s a lot of us who really enjoy the creativity, intention and chaos of H3. There are very few things that can measure up to the podcast/show. With the amount of content they consistently put out and how quickly they pivot to trying completely new ideas, you never know what you’re going to get. But what we got right now are comments and posts getting aroused by the opportunity to pin another badge on their vest in the name of whatever cause/group they need to. I’m glad Ethan and Hila posted a response and corrected that statement. There’s now no doubt what they were saying. 

Now everybody, let’s go touch grass together. Read a book and finish your coffee. Take the Mood gummy that AB did and apparently fuck like a superhero. Peace and love, take care of yourself and those around you. And give yourself space to be wrong and not feel shamed about learning to be better.",1,1731074216.0,h3h3productions,0,0.52,False

1gmj1in,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1gmj1in/opinions_on_lifestyle_change/,Opinions on lifestyle change,"Good morning everyone. This might be a longer read, so I apologize if it's too cumbersome a message. 

To start off, I'm almost 41 and was previously in the Army for nearly 20 years. I am a small person (5'3) and for most of my life I had a good metabolism. For most of my life, I ate how I wanted. I put straight garbage in me, and because of the daily activity in the military and the metabolism, I never got bigger than 145 lbs.

Flash forward to post-military days/covid/and 5 years of college, I was in my late 30s and still eating a trash diet. I ballooned up to 180 lbs. I know that doesn't seem like a lot, but for someone of my height, it is considered obese. My face looked round and chubby and I developed a bloated, beer gut looking midsection. That being said, I have never been much a drinker, so it wasn't due to copious amounts of alcohol.

About 3 months ago, after some alarming blood work from the VA, I decided to fix myself. My cholesterol and triglycerides were both high. 

For the first month, I started experimenting with a viable workout routine that my body could handle, and over the last month and half, I've settled to what I know is working. 

I wanted to gain some muscle mass and lose fat, so I do interval cardio on M-W-F and hypertrophic weight training on Tuesdays and Thursdays. After some reading, I discovered that the reason why people in the Mediterranean have such low occurrences of heart disease is because they walk an average of 9 miles a day, so on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, I do a combination of power walking and running for 10 miles (I did my first half marathon to the tune of 13.4 miles on Monday). On Tuesdays I do hypertrophic lower body lifting (25% of a one rep max with around 75 repetitions per area with a focus on correct form and muscle activation). Thursdays I do the same for upper body. In example, I do 5 by 5s. 5 repetitions of standard bench press, I get up, do 5 bicep curls with supination, and then repeat the process until I have 25 reps. I'll then do incline bench presses in the same 5 by 5 manner, followed by decline bench press and a sitting shoulder press. This equals to 100 repetitions on the triceps, chest, and shoulders, and 100 repetitions on the biceps.

As far as my new dietary lifestyle, this is where you're probably going to scold me, as I'm only ingesting about 1500 calories a day.

I drink one cup of black coffee in the morning. Around 10 am I eat two packs of high fiber oatmeal. At 1 pm I eat an egg white omelette (about 1/2 cup of egg whites) with peppers and onion and two pieces of whole wheat toast with a tsp of jam on them. At 6pm I eat dinner, which consists of a garden or sometimes Mediterranean salad with a raspberry vinaigrette and one pouch of the teriyaki tuna. The only liquid that I drink (besides the cup of coffee) is water, and I'm taking in about 6 bottles of water a day.

So far I'm down to 167 lbs. from 180 lbs. and the ideal weight for me is between 135 lbs. and 140 lbs.

I haven’t allowed myself to get to this point in a long time, especially not over something so trivial. 

A year ago I would have carried this with me all day and allowed it to take hold of the next 10+ hours of my life. I’d feel the same frustrations along with added shame for allowing myself to release my emotions so explosively again, all because of my own inability to avoid the snooze button.

I kissed my wife after throwing my short emotional tantrum and got in my car. As soon as I merged on the highway I, what felt like involuntarily, stuck my middle finger up the sky (with full respect of course) and said out loud, “today is not going to f*cking stay like this.”

I could breathe again.

I have a big issue with my politics teacher (let's call her Mrs Brown). There was a politics exam more than two weeks ago, but I couldn't attend class because I was ill.

The day after the exam, I spotted Mrs Brown in front of the school and asked her when and where I could take the exam. (Just for information: If you miss an exam, you have to retake it.)

Mrs Brown said she wasn't sure (which was okay, considering I asked her the day afterwards). Then, she gave me a date, a time and the room. I asked her if she could just tell me if she's sure about the room and the date and time. She agreed. 

After I waited for some days, I decided to go up to her in the hallway, asking politely for the date and time for my retake exam. She quickly brushed me off, saying she was busy, and walked away. I think it was an excuse.

After that, I went multiple times to the staff room to search for Mrs Brown, but she was never there (which was strange because I went there five times and the teachers mostly spend all their breaks there). I tried talking to the secretary too, but she said it was my problem, and brushed me off.

You should probably know that I want to take school seriously this year. I really want the burden of the exam to be gone as soon as possible, and knowing the date/time/room of my retake exam are important needs.

Today should be the date of my retake exam. I arrived extra early at the room she assigned me, but the teacher in charge (let's call him Mr Wood) there said he hadn't received my exam papers. There's always a list of everyone that has retake exam in this room today - I wasn't on the list, and Mrs Brown had the time of more than two weeks to put me on it. I was very disappointed.

Mr Wood told me to go to the staff room and search for her, which I did. Through the window, I saw Mrs Brown and other teachers, coffee cups in their hands, looking casual and comfortable. I thought they had a break, and knocked. Turned out they had a very important conference, even if it really didn't look like it from outside. The teacher who opened the door for me was annoyed and told me to not disturb again. She shut the door before I had the chance to explain.

I went down to Mrs Wood, who was very casual about the situation, while I was freaking out internally (maybe because all the other students were already retaking their tests, and I had less time left for my exam). 

Mr Wood told me to just wait till the conference was over. I waited for around fifteen minutes until Mrs Brown finally came out. I asked her for the exam papers. Her exact answer was **""I don't have them. I don't have time for this. I have too much to do. I have to go now""**. She didn't even apologize, and looked very annoyed and harsh. I watched her go, calling after her if she could text my parents the new date of my retake exam. She said yes and repeated that she didn't have time for this, and that she had to go home now.

When I got out of the school, I saw Mrs Brown chatting lightly with a colleague. I approached them and waited till the talk was over. Then, Mrs Brown saw me and gave me a very dirty look. She said harshly ""I'm sorry, but I can't change that now. Stop annoying me. You've been following me the whole time. Can you stop harassing me? My daughter is waiting for me."" The other teacher kept looking at me with a dirty look too. I did my best not to cry.

The exam is important for me but I can't bring myself to talk to Mrs Brown again. I feel like she never liked me in general (she always treated me harshly and ignores me raising my hand on purpose the whole time). I feel like she's racist, too (she's white and I'm a minority at our school).

But no longer! I recently took the west-bound Zephyr, and depending on timing it sits at Denver for 1-1.5 hrs in the morning. There is a great cafe near the station called Amante Coffee that was open early and served ESPRESSO MARTINIS. So I got to peak at Denver downtown, have a couple very well made espresso martinis to start the day, buy some coffee beans, and generally had a great experience. Even had time to see some murals! Of course definitely be careful, the train will NOT wait for you, but if you keep it walkable and plan to be back with a good amount of time you'll be fine.

Side note, maybe they can add a coffee machine to the dining car downstairs and start slinging some upscale espresso drinks 😈",6,1731073623.0,Amtrak,3,1.0,False
1gmiwa8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeMoneyOnlinefree/comments/1gmiwa8/earning_on_prime_opinion_tips_tricks_and_what_to/,"Earning on Prime Opinion: Tips, Tricks, and What to Expect","So, I’ve been using Prime Opinion for a bit now, and it’s actually a pretty fun way to make some extra cash on the side. Basically, you do surveys to earn points, and you can cash out once you have enough. Plus, they have a few bonus features to boost your earnings, which makes it a bit more interesting! I am now at 3500 points. I aim to reach 5000 to have a 50 dollars credit card.

**Earn Money by Taking Surveys**  
The main thing here is the surveys. They’re usually pretty quick and straightforward, and you earn points for each one you complete. I’ve been doing them during coffee breaks—it’s a nice way to feel productive and earn a little something on the side! ☕💸

**Earn by Playing Games: A Mix of Fun and Frustration 🤨**  
Prime Opinion actually lets you earn by playing games too, which is cool, but fair warning: some of these games can be a bit unpredictable with rewards. Some are worth it, while others make you work a little harder than I’d like. But hey, if you like gaming, it’s another way to earn while having fun. 🎮🕹️

**Weekly Raffles: Win Up to 1,000 Points! 🎁**  
If you’re consistent and do at least one survey every day for seven days, you get entered into a raffle. Last time, I won 500 points (roughly $5), which covered my coffee costs for the week! ☕ Not a bad deal, so I try to keep up with the streak.

**Leveling Up: Unlock Extra Perks 📈**  
There’s a level system too, which makes it feel a bit like a game. Each time you level up, you unlock features and earn extra points. Maybe one day I’ll hit level 99 and be the ""Survey King""! 👑😂

**Quick Bonus: Use My Link for an Extra +10% on Surveys 🎉**  
If you use my link, you’ll get a 10% bonus on surveys for your first 24 hours, which means you can boost your points right from the start! It’s a win-win for both of us. 🎉

**Leaderboard System: Serious Effort Needed 😅**  
There’s also a leaderboard, but I’ll be honest—it’s a bit intense. I haven’t made it up there yet because you need to fill out a ton of surveys to stay on top. Maybe one day I’ll reach ""survey warrior"" status!

**Create Virtual Credit Cards with Your Points 💳**  
One of the coolest features: you can actually create virtual credit cards with your points. I made one for Amazon, and it worked perfectly. It’s a fun way to treat yourself with what you’ve earned!

If you’re looking to make a little extra in your free time, Prime Opinion is worth a shot. I’ve been using it while commuting or waiting around, and those points start adding up.

We are going to go new (I know, burning the cash, sigh) and have narrowed it down to 2 models, but here's the quandry:

The E8 is now a [new generation](https://www.jura.com/en/about-jura/News/2023/20231011_news_e8_ec_sc) (NAC line, I think) as of late 2023 into early 2024. The S8 is getting a bit old, with only a [""sweet foam"" change](https://www.jura.com/en/about-jura/News/2023/20231122_news_s8_eb) over the last few years, so probably getting a revamp sooner rather than later.

Yes, the touchscreen looks cooler, and yes, the S is ""higher end"" then the E... But the S8 is $2400 USD at Costco, and the E8 retail is $2500 USD.

Is the newer functionality on the E8 worth it?  Even the [Jura site comparison](https://us.jura.com/en/pages/shop/product-comparison?catalog=53789DE59A6A45F9AADABD3586957229&product=A2D6E4175551434CB6B0F33B3FDD96A8&product=C1C82081F7914A8BA4C6770493DBB03E) seems a win for the E8... 

So, what am I missing?  What should I be paying more attention to?  What's the magic on the S8 that I should go for, even with an older(ish) model?

Would love to hear your thoughts on the flow, imagery, or overall vibe","Wings Between Dream and Routine
Woke up to the sun shining in my eyes,Wondering how many eyes in the gates.I stepped out into the world, feeling the weight,Chasing shadows of the dreams I thought I’d shake.
The streets are alive, but I’m lost in the haze,Footsteps echo like whispers of yesterday’s phase.The city's pulse beats loud, but my heart's out of place,Searching for something I can't quite embrace.
Whispers of secrets where the shadows lie,Taking selfies, watching movies, feeling like a zombie.The city hums around me, but I’m lost in the screen,Chasing moments that slip through the cracks in between.
The world keeps spinning, but I'm stuck in a frame,Scrolling through memories, but they all feel the same.The faces I see, they’re like ghosts in the crowd,I'm talking to millions, but never out loud.
Lost in the moment, but it feels so free,Gazing at the tree, searching for a bee.Time slows down, as the leaves start to dance,Wondering if this is fate or just a chance.
The breeze whispers secrets that I can’t quite hear,But something in the air makes the path seem clear.The buzz of the world fades into the sound,As I stand still, feeling gravity unbound.
Chasing the breeze, feeling wild and free,Carefree coffee full.Sipping on dreams, watching life unfold,In the quiet chaos, stories untold.
The sky paints a picture in hues of gold,While the world spins faster, yet I feel so bold.Treading through moments, with no map in hand,In a sea of faces, but I’m making my stand.
Time moves slow, but we’re running, can’t you see?Free my knees, I won’t run, I just wee.Laughter echoes, as we stumble through the night,Lost in the rhythm, everything feels right.
Under the stars, we’re just floating in the sea,Count the stars, drinking our tea.The moon whispers secrets, soft and serene,As we drift along, caught between dream and routine.
The water’s a mirror, reflecting our souls,We’re chasing the tide, but it never unfolds.With every wave, we’re pulled further in,Between the depths of silence and the world we’re in.
Dancing with the moon, just you and me,Our stories should be anime, trapped in a cage.Fighting through the battles, yet we turn the page,In this twisted tale, we’re both the heroes and the stage.
The stars are our backdrop, the sky is our script,Every step we take, a new plot twist to grip.Through storms and trials, we find our way,In this cosmic drama, we’re destined to stay.
Okay, I think we should stop now, let the youth become a bee.Let them buzz and fly, chasing all they see,For in their wings, lies the future we set free.
Let them soar high, above the noise and the fray,In their flight, they’ll carve a brighter day.As the world spins on, they’ll be the dreamers, you see,The youth with the wings, setting all minds free.",1,1731073021.0,PoetryWritingClub,1,1.0,False

Last couple pics are inspo for colour palette--navy blue, white, light wood and bronze accents. There are 2 patio doors. All current furniture will be removed and TV will be slightly larger (65 in). I don't love the tile but will need to wait a few years to remove it and replace with light neutral-warm wood.

1. Floor-length navy blue curtains with white sheer inner curtains. Does going up to just below the crown moulding work, or is that too high? I also considered roll down blinds and roman blinds, but rather like the drama of curtains. Really don't like vertical shades and the way they swing around. Curtains will need to be drawn away from the gas fireplace when it is lit.

2. Navy blue accent wall behind the TV, in the recessed wall and maybe also the trim around it? I had considered also doing the wall behind the couch, but worry that it wouldn't work right behind the navy blue curtains. Or I would have to do lighter (cream?) contrasting curtains but am unsure about having 2 different colours of curtains.

3. Alternative to 2, a mountain wall mural with greyish blue tones? (See last pic.) Not sure if it'll be worth it with the tv in front of it. And/or a similar mural on wall behind couch.

4. Leather sectional (similar to current one) vs 2 leather couches (3 + 2 seater), in a warm light-med brown. I also considered cream and navy blue, but I prefer brown to add more contrast and match the wood accents (coffee table, side etc.) Am fine with not using the patio door behind the couch much, though if I want a bit of distance I could maybe place a narrow table against the wall beside it?

5. A rug--don't love the idea because I have cats and worry about them clawing it, but am considering it for warmth (bleh, tile) and aesthetics. Beige? A lighter shade of blue?

I am 21F and am currently at the beginning of my path to self acceptance and trying to learn ways to deal with my ADHD and trauma

WARNING: THIS IS A HUGE TEXT, I explain a situation that I have obsessed over for a year. I'm looking for some empathy and for maybe similar situations you guys might have gone through.
I'm looking for people who might relate to this issue, so please share in the comments your story.

QUICK CONTEXT, read if you want:
I was diagnosed in february of this year after having reached my breaking point, suffering for months with derealization, depression with suicidal ideation and severe anxiety due to my lifelong traumas while having undiagnosed ADHD (and maybe autism since it runs in the family). This made me flunk the year and I almost got kicked out. I'm an international student living completely alone while in an extremely harsh art school.
I was able to get my diagnosis and present it as proof (depression wasn't enough for them so the school couldn't kick me out.
Now I am repeating the year. The main topic I bring isn't about this though, it's about the struggles I have ALWAYS had when it comes to unresolved conflict.

MAIN TOPIC:
 I can't seem to let go of a situation when the conflict isn't resolved, or when there is no way for me to resolve it since it depends on someone else and they haven't given me any clarification, leaving me in the dark.
Throughout my life, even as I was a child, I have always been the ""bigger person"" I'm very objective and rarely take things personally. For me, solving conflicts rationally is easy, and talking about it might be hard at first, but I'm always the one to take the first step and ask a friend if I sense something isn't ok. This is sort of how I learned to survive with extremely unstable parents who suck at communication, I had to learn how to be the communicator so it became second nature.

My issue is, I tend to get hyperfixated on things, and even worse, on people.

Because of this problem solving mind of mine, I tend to befriend people who I subconsciously see as a puzzle that needs to be solved.

For male friends I tend to lean towards the avoidant types (like my dad) but I'm aware enough of what they are as to not date them
(I go for the opposite). And for girls, I usually became close to the more insecure women (like most women in my family) that can't take the first step, and I've wanted to give them more confidence in themselves by also trying to serve as a good example (like an older sister). But in many occasions it happens that because of that insecurity they see me as competition or are envious of me.
My mom's family's women all hate each other, so I'm hyper aware of this sort of female competitiveness and try to run away from it like the plague. This made me have huge trust issues, especially with women

STORY TIME:

Anyways, exactly one year ago, when my mental health was in shambles, I grew closer to this guy friend (lets call him B) who I've known for a year before.
I had a crush on him because he's handsome, but he's extremely socially anxious and NEVER took initiative, so I decided to not make a move on B romantically and started dating my now ex who is a great, kind person and one of my best friends.
Still I really liked B because I empathized with him, he was really witty and playful around me and I felt he was comfortable, it makes me happy when people are comfortable around me.
I wanted to understand him more as a person and so I wanted to grow closer to him. My ex was also friends with him, we were all in a friend group. (ALSO all in the same class before I repeated the year)

Later though, this girl appeared in the picture and I could see she was very interested in B, but she was super inseçure and would
talk but never really say much. Personally I didn't have a great first impression of her because she was showing the patterns of women I was trying to avoid, but since she (secretly) was into B, I saw her as a potential new friend.
Me being me, I invited her to join our group so we started hanging out.
Me and my boyfriend started feeling award around B and the girl after a while, their dynamic was iust kinda middle schooly and we stopped hanging out in a group so much after, also cause I wasn't well mentally.

JUMP FORWARD, they start dating. 

That was fine, but after a while of hanging out with the girl I realized I ignored many red flags about her because I just wanted my friend (B) to be happy.
Me and B kinda distance, we don't talk alone to each other ever but I'm fine with that, I still reached out from time to time.
During break, me and my boyfriend go visit him in his home and met his family, it was great but he was never really present there with us, it felt weird.
I realize that as time goes by the girl starts acting weirder towards me, the more I try to keep an established connection with B, the more she tries to insert herself into everything, even though she never made an effort to befriend me as a person. BY THE WAY, I WAS the one including her in most things from the beginning. I always try to be kind to others.
I was also in a relationship and wasn't romantically interested in B whatsoever. I just act the same with my friends regardless of gender especially as a bisexual neurodivergent woman, I'm very blunt in the way I speak but always respect people's boundaries.

JUMP FORWARD A FEW MONTHS

We travelled again to B's place in the next holidays, this time with his girlfriend as well. I was severely depressed then.
During it, she displayed MANY coveted and condescending behaviors towards me that the men wouldn't notice (my ex also has ADHD and is the densest man on earth), I ignored everything because she made it so that it would be weird of me to call her out on it because it wasn't explicit enough. When alone with me, she talked about how much she hated women. A SIREN came up on my head and all I could think of was ""I felt it but I'm starting to think she's actually a femcel"".

It was so nuanced when it was public though, just looks, random thrown words, body gestures, it's exactly what I struggle to understand. It's like when a girl dislikes you but doesn't want the others to know that she does.

I had a gut feeling though, it's the pattern recognition in my brain telling me that that girl wasn't being genuine and that I shouldn't ignore how uncomfortable that situation was making me, but I was depressed and had so much self doubt. I told my boyfriend I wasn't comfortable around them but he said it was probably just my brain playing tricks on me. He was wrong.

This girl would literally get drunk and scream to my face the HATED ME, literally "" HATE YOU"" and then play it off as if it was a joke. At one point I stared at B in disbelief when she did that and he just stared back at me with a similar confused expression, but said nothing. The fact that she's his girlfriend and that he would never stand up for me just made her more comfortable in acting like that, I feel like.

I felt so alone, when walking with them, they would leave me and my bf behind and walk in front of us as if we were nonexistent. At some point I lost it and started crying, asked my bf for us to leave and go back to our place without them (we were all staying in the same place), he called them and said we were going to walk. B and her looked and me crying and said NOTHING, just ""ok"" and left.
After that I decided I would call B out on his bullshit behavior. 
With everyone in the room, I explained to him that he was acting as if I was nonexistent even though he INVITED ME AND MY BF OVER, he knew I was struggling mentally and needed some support from friends, I was feeling left out and invisible, I genuinely asked why would he invite the two of us if he wanted to go on a couple's trip with his girlfriend. 
If that's what he wanted, he should've said it so that I wouldn't have wasted my time. I was expecting a trip with a FRIEND GROUP and my bf was too.

While I said that, the girl just stared at me in silence with a plain face, she would just make comments on behalf of B, not really lettina him sneak even thou I was directing mv words towards HIM. since HE invited US and we were friends for more than a 
a year then. Unexpectedly, B started crying and apologising saying he never intended to do that, that he really did care about us and he never intended on making me feel like that. After an hour we got to a conclusion as to what the trip was supposed to be. That was a resolved conflict to me, so it should work now, right? Wrong. It got worse.

We had one night where I was actually back to talking to B, everyone was fine, except her. The moment I went back to speaking, she became SILENT. I ignored it, I dont even know what I could've said to her since I had no personal issues with her, she just made me feel insanely uncomfortable but at least I could go back to talking to my friend as usual, and I was always including her in the convos, of course. If not, she would talk to my bf when I was talking to B, and other times we'd interchange. That's why I prefer groups of 4 more than trios lol.

As me and B kinda got back to being friends like we were, she got worse and worse to the point where she had a mental breakdown out of nowhere after me and B came back from a library we wanted to check out, while her and my ex came from a shop THEY wanted to see. We had agreed on splitting and meeting up after.
I couldn't believe my eves man. I can't explain the degree of the situation, her shutting off completelv as me and B return from the library to the restaurant we were all meeting at, then her having a panic attack, then B being completely paralized not knowing what to do and ME being the one to escort her out so she could get some air and taking care of her.

He did nothing, said nothing, I told him to go after her. It was sort of unbelievable. MINUTES AFTER that situation, she started frantically laughing saying it was nothing and that we should pretend nothing happened. She didn't say anything else.
We had a musical I was so excited about right after that. It was the single thing I was happy about and it basically became a shitfest of me trying to ignore the extremely uncomfortable situation that had happened before, while sitting NEXT TO THE GIRL and B 

I'm getting tickets to watch it again by myself next time btw lol.

After that episode pretty much it all became worse than before. B gave me some socks that didn't fit him anymore cause I asked for it, she saw it on my feet, looked at me in disdain, turned to him and asked HIM if she could have the socks he just gave to me He said ""ask her"" so she looked at me and asked ME for the socks my friend just gave me as a souvenir like WHAT? You're his
GIRLFRIEND, JUST WEAR ANY SOCKS HE MIGHT HAVE IF YOU WANT IT LMAO.

I to THIS DAY, AFTER ONE YEAR, CANNOT BELIEVE I didn't call her out on her bullshit.
It's her problem she's jealous, but she had no right to make me feel like that, even if it wasn't on purpose. That's what I say about them being middle schoolers. Couldn't she have talked to him and him them talked to me?
We're in university already for fucks sake.
She wanted to be my friend apparently, but her insecurity blocked her from telling me how she felt about me and B.
If anyone had just said words instead of putting me through that TORTURE WHILE I WAS ALREADY DEPRESSED, I would've simply gone back home.

I understood her insecurities because she had opened up to me about them, and rationally tried not to get affected by her jealousy or whatever that was, but I have delayed processing of emotions and it all hit me like a TRUCK afterwards.
My boyfriend being a fucking log didn't help with affirming my emotions either. I needed some reassurance but instead I felt like I many times have felt, CRAZY.

We got back to school. B isn't talking to me anymore, barely. I realized after a week how much that had impacted me mentally and I decided to slowly distance myself. I did try to get B by himself to get a coffee with me so I could ask for any clarification, but he would tell his girlfriend and she would literally invite herself even though I needed to fucking talk to him alone over a coffee on a weekday. I did go with the both of them, and in one of the conversations, she said she didn't believe in male/female friendships (of course she's straight), I then asked ""then what am I and B?"" And also ""so if im bisexual I can't have any friends right? From that logic."" and I realized I needed to stop trying.

I distanced myself completely the more I became aware of all the lack of empathy, of how lonely B made me feel, him opening up to me about his feelings then completely retracting was, to me, the classic avoidant type punishment I DID NOT DESERVE. I felt gaslit and used for my empathy and patience, I felt betrayed, I felt invisible, I lost my sense of self. How I feel is also important.
Last year was the worst years of my life and those 2 trips with them were one of my breaking points. I became actually suicidal after that. After ONE YEAR I have realized that I was treated in the worst way possible by people who KNEW my struggles. And I lost someone I considered a dear friend in the process, too.
I thought he also did, with me, but just did not know how to navigate the situation and instead kept being the jellyfish that he is, following whatever's the easier current.

So, basically, it was FUCKING BONKERS ALL, I've told this situation to my friends asking for clarification because those trips with them pretty much traumatized me, like, seriously. It affected me to a degree many things haven't before.

I became OBSESSED over that whole situation, my boyfriend couldn't bear hearing me talk about it anymore, I felt like I was insane and needed to find the TRUTH. It triggered many of my traumas and how I felt as I child, the loneliness and invisibility, the silence, it really brought the misunderstood little girl in me back to light. In a way, I'm thankful for it, it made me question how I see myself as well.

And, anyway, after all, even though I blocked the girl (I was never her close friend so never bore many strong feelings towards her) and unfollowed B, I still checked on his stories from time to time to see how he was doing, because as I said, I couldn't hate him.
After a while I realized that THIS YEAR, after literally a year of that situation, he hid his stories from my acc but didn't block me, that's kinda... weird? It's almost as if I had done something to him, so it's kinda silly. He also barely ever posts ever so.. go off ig

The problem is that, this friend, B, I never stopped liking him. I honestly think my understanding nature can bite me in the ass sometimes. Because I knew and related to his struggles and really liked him as a person, and because as someone super closed off he CHOSE to open up to ME in particular and accepted the comfort I gave him, I ignored how his lack of action in standing up for me, or literally just COMMUNICATING with me, when I have many times done it for him actually made me feel.
I didn't put myself first at all, it's a habit, I go into ""savior"" mode for others, never for myself.

CONCLUSION:

I'm better with the whole obsession now that I'm progressing in my mental health and am given a new start in school. 
I think it is very common in ND women to feel like they are crazy even though they're literally the sanest person in the room most of the time. ESPECIALLY if you've been gaslit by a parent of family member your whole life.
Insecure people and narcissists who know about your self doubt will just act in ways that will feed into it.
It sucks, it's torture, but I'm learning to stand up for myself and to trust myself first. 

It's better to be alone and to exist than with people that make me feel like I shouldn't.

The Macroeconomics gurus tell me the Fed meeting yesterday was 'right down the middle.' I'm not sure what that means besides 'things are chill.' We got our 25 BP rate cut, but mortgage rates remain unchanged at around 7% and commercial property delinquency is approaching all-time highs. So ""buy more GME and continue to hold?"" Got it. Let's take a look at our data!

**Price Movement Recap**

[11\/7 Trading Day 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/r7jrhyx24ozd1.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=c05bfcb8d4dc6a9fc964e35a923772ca4a2eb117)

After an early test of $23 off the open, traders modestly walked the stock price up to $23.66 on some early bullish flow before orders balanced out throughout the remainder of the day and the stock-price undulated mildly within the context of the upper VWAP channel. Intraday RSI overbought and oversold signals guided decision-making on some of the larger intraday reversals, but in total, trading was flat in comparison to our trading earlier in the week and last week, despite decently elevated volume and options premium flows. This is likely the result our dense, heavy call-gamma skewed environment which makes trading slow and lacking volatility as a result of antipathetic dealer hedging. Nonetheless, the continued bullish flows still obligate MM share accumulation and push the stock price slowly higher without major intraday retracement. Consolidation at $23 for the second day in a row was a good sign.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

Max Pain strikes are unmoved into November OPEX, remaining at $21 and $20 for this week and next respectively. 11/8 expiry has seen net OI contraction with traders taking profits or cutting losses ahead of JPOW's announcement yesterday (which proceeded exactly as expected with a 25 BP rate cut). 

[11\/8 OI Changes 11\/7-11\/8](https://preview.redd.it/wh7j7qzf2ozd1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfa3f8a46a933d2f88a46783f182f40084b5c2db)

Some Puts were added to the board likely as hedges for potential reaction to yesterday's announcement, but not very many traders appear to have been altogether concerned. 

[11\/15 OPEX OI Changes 11\/7-11\/8](https://preview.redd.it/hbrq81mj2ozd1.png?width=1057&format=png&auto=webp&s=8925dc0a3952c3798b5b5a96454ebd7196ad24d4)

As we look to November OPEX, however, we see some very substantial Call OI expansions took place yesterday. 5000 new contracts at $20 alone were added, split about evenly between BID and ASK. $23 thickened up with over 2000 new Calls and almost 1500 more contracts were added to $25. Put OI, on the other hand, net contracted across all strikes. This action continues to project stable trading conditions pointing toward consolidation above $23 and possible slow, but determined upward pressure approaching $25.

Farther out we did have a few instances of Put OI expansion: over 1100 new Puts at $20 for 11/22 - every single one sold short - and 500 for 12/20 also sold entirely short. Indeed, as Puts come on the board, they are largely popping up short. Bearish sentiment on GME is currently only being expressed through theta-advantaged short call trades. 

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/dlbkqgqu1ozd1.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b19fd2bb07f38d3ea0d3725be78249a4e883b0d

We can see this continued bullish sentiment expressed in the P/C GEX ratio trends. Despite yesterday's neutral premium skew, we are trending even more bullish toward 1:5. This reflects very high call demand and low put demand in the options market - unsurprising given our recent momentum and elevated IV conditions. 

[Look at this pure thicccness](https://preview.redd.it/mqfuyzio8ozd1.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=08f8c920f5efdc224112f8eeb97370f01d17303a)

As we look at our daily table across all expiries, we can see our key proximal trading strikes  - $23, $23.5, $24 - have all accrued more Call gamma with our largest Put Gamma strike at $23 as well. This suggests MM hedging will continue to offer support at $23 into our close today - barring some crazy, unexpected bearish event that causes options flows to swing bearish by the tens of millions. Continued bullish flow, however, will continue to grind us up toward $24 as we seek to claim that level as a consolidated floor into next week:

https://preview.redd.it/4irv9syh9ozd1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddd0c2f3da07dbc32449f7b8cb2254cd05d6626a

If options flow stays tilted toward calls and inserts itself at $24 and $24.5, we could claim $24-$25 as a new intraday trading bracket, though based on our technical layout and a lack of any specific news to anticipate, I would lean in my forecast toward an upward test of $24 that returns us back to the $23-$24 area with some tests of $24 into November OPEX. At the moment, there is not enough OI built out for the second half of November to get a sense of how traders and institutions intend to play the final two expiries of November leading up to our pre-Q3 earnings report. 

**Technicals**

[7\/16-10\/29 1-Day Aggregation w\/ Doodle Projection](https://preview.redd.it/clhyin7rbozd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=deb194fb2c748c89a81b49f8b94c62a623f92a1d)

[10\/21-11\/6 4-hr Aggregation Actual with Technical Inquiry Marks](https://preview.redd.it/vgffijyubozd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=32438f8147d829faa616cf19edcfc472d301b9cf)

So yesterday we got what I sketched on the 4hr chart above. If this periodization structure continues as I have demarcated it, I could see an early test of $24 that reverses to the middle of our $23-$24 bracket - probably below $23.50. If so, I could see a $23 test off the open on Monday, followed by an intraday reversal to test $24 again.

[7\/16-11\/7 1-Day Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/n0fkh8cscozd1.png?width=1491&format=png&auto=webp&s=2833c5c260e293a46fe5bb177c450c01077856af)

On our daily chart, we are approaching our highest RSI value since our May-June price action (marked). While there's nothing binding here that says we \*must\* reverse if we cross or touch this line, there is some probability that the options market and swing traders will bet on a small reverse. If we test $24 intraday, we would essentially cross this RSI level. This would prompt a small, probably tighter trend-consistent correction into and out of 11/15 OPEX to potentially set up a bigger breakout as we head into December. 

I won't speculate too much here, but hopefully you can grasp within these thought structures what sorts of price oscillations our current developing paradigm projects. Remember, however, that these symbols and signals are \*navigational\* and not mechanically \*causal\*. It will depend on the will (capital commitments) of the market participates to actually drive our price action here. 

**IV Trends**

[10-Day Mean Implied Volatility](https://preview.redd.it/xa0undy7bozd1.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=583fa8eded7b45e066a84635031b0196c56d6ba0)

[4hr-Aggregation Schwab IV ](https://preview.redd.it/lbssr2ffbozd1.png?width=1261&format=png&auto=webp&s=74599483f6c194006b2aa7a7152252fd6a3dacac)

As we can see, IV is still elevated. However, our slow upward grind keeps much day-to-day appreciation at a minimum. If the 'estimated' date of 12/4 reporting is correct (unconfirmed by the company), then we can expect perhaps a consolidating/flatter or down week following OPEX, with recovery and potential breakout as IV begins to creep upward beginning the week of 11/29. If earnings are announced for 12/11 (what I think will happen), we won't see that IV appreciation start to set in until later.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

I am expecting a decent likelihood of a $24 test intraday today, but ultimately a close in the middle of our $23-$24 range - barring any unanticipated externalities, news, major player buys, CATalysts, etc. Next week will likely host another $24 test early with some consolidation atop $23 as a continued support. A GME earnings announcement - that is, the date - will give institutions a clearer sense of how to structure the next few weeks in anticipation of the IV Thumper effect. This is, of course, based on the assumption that our current technical and options trends remain constant without external disruption of the system. Something \*can\* come in and accelerate our price appreciation, though anything of the sort is a black box to me at the moment.

Cheers and good luck out there, everyone!

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I rarely hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.

I'm a manager in a large private practice medical office scheduling call center. I have a team on only 8. Recently I went through the dreaded interview process to hire an additional team member. I interviewed a young Filipino lady who was very cordial, very kind, her appearance was clean and professional. She did oddly at times read from a note she brought with (like a script), but I chalked it up to nerves. She had a slight accent, but I could clearly hear her, and it seemed as though her English was very good. She didn't have a lot of call center experience, but her kind nature and eagerness to work sold me, so I hired her. Week one of training begins, and I can barely understand a word she says. Patient's have to constantly be transferred to other agents, and she is being hung up on numerous times a day because the patient is frustrated with the conversation. We're in week 4 as of today, and even with  more training than any other person I've ever trained she isn't comprehending the basics. I think she knows she isn't doing well because she keeps bringing coffee, and bagels to the team. I feel so confused by our initial interview because I didn't detect a deep English language barrier at all. Has this ever happened to anyone? Week 4 of training I expect them to know all the basics, but of course there is more training to be done. My concern is her English. I don't even know how to approach this? I don't think in all my years I have been conned by someone who doesn't really speak English (well enough to be speaking on the phone all day).

I think I dun goofed. 

I recently moved into a house I bought with my partner, and one of the first things I got started was my compost franken-pile. I started it off with a bunch of torn up moving boxes, toilet roll cores, various dried plant matter I found around the place, food scraps, coffee grounds and other weird and wonderful things like pet hair etc. I've kept it somewhat wet to help the cardboard break down and encourage wormies to come have a snack etc. 

Today I went to Bunnings and was like how can I get this bad boy cooking. I didn't want to pay for a compost starter because I think that's a bit of a rip off so I walked to the compost section and saw mushroom compost... it said it was a by-product of commercial mushroom production so I was like awesome, a super cheap alternative! 

I went home, enthusiastically ripped it open and poured it all over my franken-pile (all 12kg of it) and called it a night... only to later go online and see that it's apparently really high in sodium and super strong and high alkalinity! 

Have I really stuffed it? Can I save it? How much coffee do I need to sacrifice?! We're going to be planting blueberries and a bit of an orchard and it seems like everything I want to grow needs low pH. ",1,1731071574.0,composting,2,1.0,False

The last time I didn’t eat was 30 days a year ago. I drank water, cola, green tea, and random drinks.

Usually, I don't eat for 2 to 4 days, which is generally called fasting. But I just don't eat. My body naturally gets hot. Now in winter, I always wear short sleeves when I go out.

.

Some people don’t eat for more than a year but only drink coffee or meditate and practice. There is no real evidence.

But I am just an ordinary person. I can bask in the sun or stay indoors. It is very ordinary. I believe this can be studied.

But no one in Taiwan has done anything. If only the United States might have a forward-looking vision for the future.

.

If humans don’t eat, this is the next stage of evolution, but 80% of the current economy will collapse.

I have a special constitution and I don’t want to waste this time. I may leave a record that will be used thousands or thousands of years later.

I am now asking anyone who has a non-eating experimental laboratory in the United States or is interested in doing so to contact me.

.

Babies absorb liquid food to grow, and the soft flesh of the adult esophagus absorbs solid food.

No matter how much damage is caused to both sides, the teeth can still be maintained by chewing gum, but the damage to the body is difficult.

.

I have tried dyeing my fingers, and the color gradually disappears after entering the pores. The plants will feel that the radio waves are different when people enter the room. It needs machine verification to let everyone know.

It shows that the human body still has great unknown potential. It is possible not to eat, but to contact food with thoughts to transform kinetic energy.

.

It is difficult to change habits after billions of years, but someone will always do experiments and research to find a better way to evolve.

As the body absorbs it, it will gradually fade away like stained paint. Whether we can avoid eating it remains to be seen through experiments. But how many people can avoid eating it?

.

Think about the Olympic Games, Formula One racing... these great achievements are made by the best human resources, using extremely high resources to push forward the ultimate progress.

Even if you don’t eat, there is still a long way to go in human progress. I am just passing through a relay station.

.

The economy is turning towards a general direction of development, and people are no longer just obsessed with eating, hoping that someone will recommend a fasting experiment.

Knowing that applying for a budget can take up to a year, the solicitation period is extended to two years.

.

Hopefully, there will be two companies or foundations, and they will be on opposing sides, like the Democratic and Republican parties,

To ensure the authenticity of the experiment, it is best to have three or more companies conduct the experiment together, and the entire process will be broadcast live on YouTube.

### **Mouse Capone's Expeditions & Misadventures presents:
The Secret Tree in the Garden of Amun**

S.3, Episode 6: ""The Secret Tree in the Garden of Amun"" 
     
### **Epilogue, Part II: The First Meeting**

It was a quiet evening in Alexandria, the kind of evening where the air felt thick with the weight of unsaid words. Mouse Capone sat across from Professor Featherstone in a small café near the library district, the ancient streets humming with the low murmur of life. They had just met, an unlikely pairing brought together by the intricate web of the underground world they both navigated so well.

“So,” Featherstone began, adjusting his wire-rimmed glasses, “you’re interested in the economics of heists.”

Mouse leaned back in his chair, his eyes half-lidded but sharp. “I’m interested in value. Where it comes from, how it shifts. The things people hold dear.”

Featherstone sipped his coffee, his expression thoughtful. “Value is subjective, of course. It’s tied to perception, to belief. A gold coin is worth nothing to a man who has no use for it. But to a kingdom, it can mean everything.”

Mouse nodded slowly. “That’s why the game isn’t about the gold itself. It’s about understanding the system around it—the forces that drive people to risk their lives for something as arbitrary as money.”

Featherstone’s lips curled into a small, knowing smile. “Precisely. Money, in itself, is a tool. It facilitates exchange, enables control, but its power comes from the belief people place in it. That’s why some of the greatest heists in history weren’t about stealing money—they were about undermining trust. Trust is the system, trust is the institution.”

“Or,” Mouse added, “the trust in people is.”

There was a beat of silence as they both considered the weight of those words. For Mouse, every job he’d pulled, every heist, had been less about the loot and more about the dynamics at play—the psychology of greed, the fragility of power.

Featherstone set his cup down, folding his hands on the table. “But you’re not just a thief, are you, Mr. Capone? You’re after something deeper. A legacy.”

Mouse’s gaze narrowed, though not in hostility. Featherstone was right, after all. The thrill of the job, the chase—it wasn’t enough. There was something about unraveling the world’s hidden structures, understanding the way value was manipulated, that drove him.

“I’d say I’m after understanding,” Mouse replied. “The rest—gold, jewels, fame—that’s just noise.”

Featherstone nodded in approval. “And that’s where the real power lies. Once you understand how value is created, manipulated, and distributed, you control the narrative. Money comes and goes, but the ability to shape the world’s perception—that’s a treasure beyond measure.”

Mouse smirked. “So that’s why you’re interested in working with me, huh? You think I’ve got what it takes to shape the world?”

“I need someone that's good at deflecting heat, Capone, and, in some ways, I think you already are,” Featherstone replied, his tone even. “And together, we could take it even further.”

The conversation paused as they both leaned back in their chairs, the city’s ancient energy seeping into the quiet between them. For Mouse, this was more than a meeting. It was the start of something bigger—a partnership that could reshape the way he approached his craft, the way he viewed his place in the world.

And for Featherstone? Well, he had plans of his own.

“I have a feeling,” Mouse said, his voice low but confident, “you and I will be friends for a long time.”

Featherstone smiled, raising his cup as if in toast. “Indeed, Mr. Capone. To the future.”

And so, in the dim light of Alexandria, surrounded by the weight of centuries-old knowledge and the whispers of lost empires, Mouse Capone and Professor Featherstone made a quiet pact. A pact that would not only define their partnership but would echo through every heist, every treasure hunt, and every scheme they would undertake together.

In the end, it wasn’t about the gold or the riches.

It was about understanding the world—and bending it to their will.",1,1731070957.0,hdfidelity,0,1.0,False

**Safe Driving Tips for Daylight Savings Time**

Daylight savings time (DST) is an adjustment we make twice a year to better align our daylight hours with our active hours. While gaining or losing an hour might seem like a minor shift, it can actually have significant effects on drivers, their alertness, and overall road safety. At *Get Drivers Ed*, we believe that being informed and prepared is essential for staying safe behind the wheel, especially during transitional periods like daylight savings. In this post, we’ll explore some essential safe driving tips to help you navigate this time change without compromising safety.

# How Daylight Savings Time Affects Drivers

Many drivers underestimate how much daylight savings time can affect their driving. Losing an hour of sleep in the spring or adjusting to darker evenings in the fall can disrupt your sleep cycle, impair reaction times, and increase the risk of drowsy driving. According to research, the shift in time can lead to an increase in car accidents due to reduced alertness and a shift in the light conditions drivers are accustomed to.

At *Get Drivers Ed*, we emphasize that understanding these risks and taking proactive steps can make all the difference in ensuring you drive safely during daylight savings time.

# 1. Prioritize Rest and Adapt to the Change

One of the most important steps you can take is to ensure you’re well-rested before and during the transition. Here’s how you can adapt:

# Get Enough Sleep

https://preview.redd.it/e7yyypj5dozd1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5546d38a45c2c2d4279df270eca76eff7d98370d

A change in the clock can impact your circadian rhythm, making you feel groggy and less alert. To minimize this, try going to bed 15-30 minutes earlier for a few days before the shift. This helps your body gradually adjust to the new schedule.

# Take Short Naps If Needed

https://preview.redd.it/rkut0s26dozd1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5226bbd15efba990da3ae1c8ca231836e6a33978

If you find yourself drowsy during the day, a 20-30 minute nap can help boost alertness without making you feel more tired. However, always ensure that your nap is not too close to bedtime to avoid interfering with your nighttime sleep.

# 2. Be Mindful of Changing Light Conditions

Daylight savings time can significantly alter the lighting conditions during your regular commute. Whether you’re dealing with sudden darkness in the evening or brighter mornings, your driving experience may change.

# Adjust Your Schedule

https://preview.redd.it/pz1eymf6dozd1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16e7cbeaa32212bf2792958e9cd971d124bb82ec

If possible, adjust your schedule to avoid driving during the times that may be affected the most, such as early morning or early evening, when light transitions can be sudden.

# Use Your Headlights Wisely

https://preview.redd.it/4840nlt6dozd1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a650a24cf19f901ac7347e0d287155179b9ebc56

During the fall shift, it may get darker earlier than expected. Make sure to use your headlights properly, not just to see but also to be seen by other drivers. Proper use of headlights can improve visibility and reduce accidents during dawn and dusk.

# 3. Watch Out for Drowsy Driving

Drowsy driving is particularly dangerous, as it can impair your judgment and slow down reaction times. Studies have shown that losing even an hour of sleep due to daylight savings time can make you more susceptible to fatigue.

# Recognize the Signs of Drowsiness

https://preview.redd.it/5v6oq967dozd1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b77b9b22fe71b4105210f8ab8a505069e53fd6c7

Signs of drowsy driving include frequent yawning, heavy eyelids, and difficulty focusing on the road. If you experience any of these symptoms, pull over and rest before continuing your journey.

# Avoid Relying Solely on Caffeine

https://preview.redd.it/lyfhgzj7dozd1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32851cade718f50daba02f293c238c237e81934c

While coffee or energy drinks can temporarily make you feel more alert, they don’t replace the benefits of proper rest. If you’re too tired, it’s better to stop driving than to depend on quick fixes.

# 4. Plan for Extra Travel Time

During the initial days after daylight savings time takes effect, give yourself extra time to get to your destination. Roads may be busier than usual as drivers adjust to new schedules and changing light conditions.

# Leave Early and Avoid Rushing

https://preview.redd.it/bbh7rd08dozd1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54407cbcdcb76b1ee91cdd5402fb63ce92e85914

By giving yourself a few extra minutes, you’ll avoid feeling rushed and can make more thoughtful driving decisions. This is especially crucial in the week following the time change, as more drivers may be tired or distracted.

# 5. Keep an Eye on Pedestrians and Cyclists

Daylight savings can also affect pedestrians and cyclists, as they may not be used to the change in light conditions. Reduced visibility during dawn and dusk can increase the chances of accidents involving non-motorized road users.

# Stay Alert in Residential Areas

https://preview.redd.it/qzh9ugg8dozd1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=725faa602f9c2c944c080e9e41258069df55b4d0

Watch for children walking to school in the morning or playing outside in the evening, especially during the first few days after the time change. *Get Drivers Ed* stresses the importance of scanning your surroundings and being prepared for sudden movements from pedestrians.

# Use Your Mirrors Frequently

https://preview.redd.it/dxbhjzt8dozd1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=390d1e192eecdb13f484fac1e06d38c07f6d1fa9

Make a habit of checking your mirrors regularly to stay aware of cyclists who may be sharing the road. This can help you anticipate their movements and respond accordingly.

# 6. Maintain Your Vehicle for Safe Driving

During daylight savings, ensuring your car is well-maintained can make all the difference in your safety on the road.

# Check Your Headlights and Taillights

https://preview.redd.it/nq9nqh99dozd1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c53474cd9b2983d65727910fe1a6a8bea5702f65

Since visibility may be reduced during different times of the day, it’s essential to check that your headlights and taillights are functioning properly. Clean any debris and make sure your lights are bright enough to illuminate your path and alert others to your presence.

# Inspect Your Windshield Wipers

https://preview.redd.it/0wgj7dl9dozd1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc28a5486ff2ee6541a0a7f754326cf55b150476

During the fall shift, you might encounter more rain or dew, which can impair visibility. Make sure your windshield wipers are in good condition and replace them if necessary.

# 7. Utilize Defensive Driving Techniques

Defensive driving is always crucial, but it becomes even more important during the adjustment period following daylight savings time.

# Keep a Safe Following Distance

https://preview.redd.it/ncuh2bw9dozd1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b63015d90e1a0e49a84fc306b157a075f599a722

Maintain a greater following distance than usual to allow for ample reaction time if the driver in front of you brakes suddenly. This can help prevent rear-end collisions, which are more likely when drivers are drowsy or adjusting to new light conditions.

# Stay Focused and Limit Distractions

https://preview.redd.it/09221m8adozd1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de8bf766e600b61840aec53323d910c2faafd451

Keep your focus on the road and avoid activities that divert your attention, such as using your phone, adjusting the radio, or eating while driving. At *Get Drivers Ed*, we encourage drivers to always practice focused, distraction-free driving.

# Conclusion

Daylight savings time can introduce a variety of challenges for drivers, from changes in light conditions to increased fatigue. By prioritizing rest, adjusting your schedule, and following these safe driving tips, you can navigate daylight savings time with confidence.

**Q&A: How Will Online San Antonio Drivers Education Affect You?**

Driving is a key skill that offers freedom and convenience, but before getting behind the wheel, proper training is essential. If you’re in San Antonio, you might be considering online drivers education as a flexible, modern option for learning. At *Get Drivers Ed*, we understand the questions students and parents may have when deciding if online education is the right path. This blog post will answer your most pressing questions and provide clarity on how *Get Drivers Ed* can support your journey toward earning your license.

# What Is Online Drivers Education?

https://preview.redd.it/s1b8ltfycozd1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d548e24eaa0a301595b7423de8b8821e91f2260b

Online drivers education refers to the process of taking a driver training course over the internet, allowing you to learn at your own pace, from the comfort of your home. These courses are designed to meet state requirements and cover all essential driving laws, safe driving practices, and fundamental rules of the road.

In Texas, online drivers education has become increasingly popular, especially for busy teens, adults, and parents looking for a convenient way to manage their time effectively. *Get Drivers Ed* offers comprehensive courses that align with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) standards, ensuring that you receive high-quality education that’s accepted throughout the state.

# How Does Online Drivers Education Work?

https://preview.redd.it/p6948grycozd1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa6dd632c8b24d1b6be1579015d9b720e3a5d12d

Online drivers education, like the courses offered by *Get Drivers Ed*, works similarly to traditional classroom-based courses, but with added flexibility. Here’s a brief breakdown of how it functions:

1. **Registration**: You start by signing up for a course that meets your needs, whether it’s for teenagers or adult learners.
2. **Course Modules**: The course is divided into modules covering topics such as road signs, traffic laws, defensive driving techniques, and other important skills.
3. **Quizzes and Assessments**: Throughout the course, quizzes ensure you're retaining the material. At the end, a final exam tests your overall knowledge.
4. **Completion Certificate**: Upon passing, you receive a certificate of completion, which is necessary for taking the driving test at your local Department of Public Safety (DPS).

# Benefits of Choosing an Online Drivers Education Program

Online drivers education provides several advantages that make it an attractive option for new drivers in San Antonio:

With *Get Drivers Ed*, you can set your own study hours. Whether you’re balancing school, a job, or extracurricular activities, our online course allows you to learn when it’s convenient for you. This flexibility is particularly valuable for parents who might be coordinating schedules for multiple children or for adults returning to education after time away.

# 2. Self-Paced Progress

Every learner is different, and not everyone can keep up with the fast-paced environment of a classroom.

At *Get Drivers Ed*, we encourage students to study at a pace that suits them best, which improves retention and understanding.

# 3. Affordable and Cost-Effective

I live in Edinburgh and I always need to look down so I won't step on dog shit, even in nice supposedly clean areas.

Except for the Botanic Gardens where dogs  aren't allowed, forget about having a picnic at the park or enjoying a stroll in a leafy path. People take their dogs to pee and poop there, they let them run around unleashed even with children nearby, sometimes big dog breeds too. Because you totally need a siberian husky in the cobblestoned alleys of Edinburgh to pull your sledge. Also big ass unmuzzled dogs in tiny coffee shops with babies in prams next to them. You have a dog phobia or allergy? Well, that's a you problem. Now look at my dog licking its butthole as you eat your yam yam.

I sometimes go to this pretty graveyard nearby which also has some war memorials with multiple explicit signs that dogs aren't allowed and yet the place is a dog walking hub with people letting their dogs shit on peoples' graves.

Outside our flat building there's a sign that dog fouling isn't allowed and yet people let their dogs shit on our grass. Once an old man was passing by, who wasn't even living in our building and complained to a dog owner about this and they were so cheeky about it. Wtf kind of selfish and self-entitled behaviour is this? And ofc they take their dogs away from their own properties to do their business. I've seen so many dogs just peeing outside people's doors.

1gmhs4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1gmhs4t/how_long_should_i_fast/,How long should I fast,"Trigger warning this post is a little messy because I have multiple questions and dont know how to organize my thoughts well. If that makes you respond rudely or insult me, just don't read it in the first place.

Hi, I'm new to fasting and I'm very confused as to how long you should fast for what benefits. Every source says something else, some say autophagy starts after 12 hours and others say it starts after 24 hours. I don't understand what the benefits of fasting for multiple days are and how that is safe.

I'm female, 21, 165cm/5'5ft and something between 48-52kg. I tried 16/8 fasting for weight loss 2 years ago, which I know would've resulted in an unhealthy weight (didn't lose any from that). Now I want to fast for the health benefits (yes really, yes I'm sure it's not disguised disordered eating). I tried intermittent a few times again but doing that every day makes me feel too restricted and too focused on the food and dieting aspect of it again. But every source on fasting says it has major health benefits so instead I would like to try longer fasts every few weeks or months.

The thing is I don't get how long you should do it to actually get health benefits apart from just burning fat. I don't get what exactly those benefits are e.g. autophagy starts but our cells always do that so why would I have to increase it? Like what does that do specifically? And like I already asked, how is it safe to just not eat for multiple days? That just doesn't get into my head.

  
I started a fast yesterday and am now at 24 hours. I felt fine but at 22 hours a little tired and weak so I tried drinking black coffee. I now feel like less tired of course but a little shiver-y, nervous and still kinda weak but I don't know if thats just because of the coffee, which I usually dont drink like that but with cocoa powder (but also without milk).

22M. I’m studying abroad and, for example, a girl that would help me practice French back home was also studying abroad and I said “hey we should meet when I’m there”. She said for sure that sounds great. But now that I’m here, she said let’s meet Friday but didn’t respond when I asked what time. Today (Friday) she gave me an excuse, but I don’t know to believe her or not because her Instagram does say active. She could’ve replied to me within 24 hours but she didn’t. Today (Friday), she responds with a time which definitely didn’t work for me. After today, she said that she’s gone for the weekend but said we’ll see each other at Uni. It’s whatever, I wasn’t dying to meet her (Paris is so amazing I have a lot of things planned). But, I didn’t even send her a lot of messages. Just a “Hey, I’m in Paris, would be great to get a coffee if you’re down.”

Same thing back in the country I’m studying abroad in. When I invited two girls to a house party, both of them said sure, but canceled last minute.

I don’t want to play the race card, but I feel like it’s because I’m a Sikh man with a turban. I don’t know if it’s that, or if they find me annoying, or what it is. But I feel like this has been affecting my confidence lately.

I thought that I’d be more outgoing and less introverted. But I feel like I just shouldn’t talk with anyone. It definitely seems like I’m not desirable or at the very least slightly important to anyone that I meet. Not sure what how to proceed.

My parents led the RV Park Forum on Wednesday night and talked about “post-election syndrome” and “political anxiety disorder.” Did you ever hear of those terms before? I didn't. They had us laughing so hard that we were falling off of our seats! They put up a PowerPoint about an [article](https://thehoya.com/uncategorized/toward-a-healthy-post-political-season/) from the 2004 election (!) in which Republicans were gloating (the authors called it “Smugmania”) and the Democrats were suffering from bitter “Melancholia Democratium.” 

The session went on and on. My parents no longer like to drive at night except on very familiar roads so we had planned for them to spend the night with us. They had promised our clients to continue the dialogue at Coffee Hour–but it lasted until past lunch time. Clients pretty much agreed to lock away their militia armaments back into their gun cabinets and build friendship bridges back to Sanity Land.

In the real world, the left has to acknowledge and respond to a new [political realignment](https://www.city-journal.org/article/a-political-realignment). “Melancholia Democratium”, indeed! “All the king's horsemen and all the King's men couldn't put Humpty Dumpty together again.” Not only that, their best and their brightest didn't even see that Mr. Dumpty was broken. Were these people really the right group to lead the country? And on another front, at the same time, barely noticed, was Wednesdsy's [news](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68110310) that for the first time, global warming has exceeded 1.5°C across an entire year–a trigger that geometrically increases cataclysmic climate events.

Any mention of these occurrences at Sgiwhistleblowers? Not that I have seen! There are more important issues for them: the 1963 “Seattle Incident.” YKW felt absolutely compelled to write not *one*, not *two*, but *three* posts on this most essential topic.

So what drives this type of thinking? A couple of days ago I [repeated](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGIWhistleblowersMITA/s/88VI7a018P) True's hypothesis that we may be dealing with [rare psychological conditions](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGIWhistleblowersMITA/s/69t1U4RWy1) that she and her colleagues observed within the prison population: [hyperthymesia](https://greymattersjournal.org/in-living-memory--understanding-hyperthymesia/), [Katagelasticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katagelasticism?wprov=sfla1), and [histrionic personality disorder](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/histrionic-personality-disorder). I proposed then another alternative explanation, that here we see a [provocateur](https://rwhershey.wordpress.com/2017/08/10/the-provocateur-method-motivation-and-mentality/) at their work. 

I was diagnosed with OCPD when I was still a girl. Many people don't understand that this condition is completely [different](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/what-is-obsessive-compulsive-disorder#:~:text=Obsessive%2DCompulsive%20Disorder%20(OCD),-Obsessive%2Dcompulsive%20disorder&text=To%20get%20rid%20of%20the,like%20counting%20%2D%2D%20are%20problematic.) from OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). Check out the [list](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20signs%20and,symmetrical%20or%20in%20perfect%20order) of OCD obsessions and compulsive responses. Hmmm. Obsessed with events that took place in 1963 and to view them with such alarm as if they were monsters lying right now under their bed? Check! Compulsive responses: “I got to feed stale red meat and crumbs to my followers right now, right now! But before that, I have to–the very first thing in the morning–police and downvote the silly posts of the four teenagers at LoHeidiLita!” It's not compulsive hand washing, but it's so similar!

There's an interesting discussion at [Quora](https://ginaponzosspace.quora.com/Why-do-people-pretend-to-know-much-more-than-they-actually-know?ch=10&oid=157879934&share=6da90bcc&srid=hHZwHG&target_type=question) about people who claim to know much more than they really do. There are several thoughtful responses there that remind me much about YKW’s posts.

To the people who follow YKW's posts, you should note that sociopaths as well are very good at the [art of persuasion](http://www.sociopathworld.com/2011/02/sociopathic-art-of-persuasion.html?m=1). (BTW, the 1963 was [litigated](https://www.sokaissues.info/home/allegations-disproved/nikken_timeline.html) long ago. 

Sorry, I am not going to step into this 1963 sinkhole any longer. *My parents* were only 2-3 years old when the incident occurred so it is not heavily relevant to me. And you're not going to evoke much sympathy from me over your allegations that this deceased Japanese Women’s Division member was a prostitute after the war. Why should that matter, YKW? Have you ever had to survive through anything like the trauma of a destroyed and defeated post-war Japan? And did you know that people have the capacity to change their lives? I spent five years working as a porn video actress– and I am sure living a different life now than I did then! As to your self-claimed moral superiority that empowers you to throw thunderbolts from Mount Olympus at erring mortals on the ground, how many morality points do you score for mocking an 82-year-old Dean Carter who is still working, writing, and traveling around the world to convey what he feels is his peace-building

Good segue, right? I am still totally immersed in reading the interview with Dean Carter in the [November Living Buddhism](https://www.worldtribune.org/2024/living-beyond-belief-beyond-faith/). Let me continue where I left off ([Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGIWhistleblowersMITA/s/h5sf0k7gaN), [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGIWhistleblowersMITA/s/nK9HYEQiGQ), [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGIWhistleblowersMITA/s/lne0ZwodTZ), and [Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGIWhistleblowersMITA/s/DLrWK2oVFZ)) in this mini-series. 

Let's compare the dark YKW World described above to Dean Carter World. He states in the article:

>I practice Nichiren Buddhism as a Baptist Christian. I didn’t have to give up being Christian or Baptist to borrow from the wisdom and the tradition of Nichiren Buddhism. So that’s why the subtitle of my book is: *How My Interfaith Journey With Daisaku Ikeda Made Me a Better Christian*. The subtitle of my book is a cosmopolitan head turner. It gets the attention of the Christian world. It opens mental doors to more value creation.

I find leaps from world to world to be so fascinating. He is trying to bridge Nichiren Buddhism and Christian Baptism. We sure need some of that world leaping in light of the [anti-semitic riots](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2y33ee1klo) earlier in Amsterdam. We need  “cosmopolitan head turners” who can “open mental doors.” Actually, this is exactly what we saw my parents do on Wednesday night when they brought two divided groups of clients back into a single community.

The Living Buddhism editor then took the interview into a different direction. They asked how this process of “embodying the teachings” looked like for Dean Carter in his relationship with Martin Luther King Jr. after he was no longer here. Dean Carter responded: 

>Well, I took him seriously, and I chose him to be my mentor for life, which meant I tried to love everybody. Everything I did in my interpersonal and social relations, my environmental, local and global encounters, I tried to come from a place of unconditional love—all conditional love. And I tried to practice nonviolence, not just toward my friends and family but toward people with whom I disagreed. 

>I had to be open to a common denominator in all people, and that is that everyone, regardless of the mistakes they’ve made, everybody has some measure of humanity and should be respected. This is where I am coming from even with people whom I strongly disagree. I do not let their conduct make me abandon my moral values.

This is very good advice for any of us suffering from “post-election syndrome” or “political anxiety disorder.” Please, please, please consider getting professional help if you find yourselves getting stuck in those ruts.

But now that I’m here, she said let’s meet Friday but didn’t respond when I asked what time. Today (Friday) she gave me an excuse, but I don’t know to believe her or not because her Instagram does say active. She could’ve replied to me within 24 hours but she didn’t. Today (Friday), she responds with a time which definitely didn’t work for me. After today, she said that she’s gone for the weekend but said we’ll see each other at Uni. It’s whatever, I wasn’t dying to meet her (Paris is so amazing I have a lot of things planned). But, I didn’t even send her a lot of messages. Just a “Hey, I’m in Paris, would be great to get a coffee if you’re down.”

Same thing back in the country I’m studying abroad in. When I invited two girls to a house party, both of them said sure, but canceled last minute.

I don’t want to play the race card, but I feel like it’s because I’m a Sikh man with a turban. I don’t know if it’s that, or if they find me annoying, or what it is. But I feel like this has been affecting my confidence lately.

I thought that I’d be more outgoing and less introverted. But I feel like I just shouldn’t talk with anyone. It definitely seems like I’m not desirable or at the very least slightly important to anyone that I meet. Not sure what how to proceed.

My husband was eating Whole Foods with lots of cheats of mostly sweets and very refined carbs. I’ve been doing AB since April and my husband for about a month. We’ve both only lost a few pounds, nothing remarkable. I haven’t seen much improvement in my bloating/gas/constipation. My husband is always tired. Seeing heart and soil content and other influencers boasting energy and improvements is making me feel like what am I doing wrong. 

What are your typical meals? Do you do steak like 2-3 times a day with sweet fruit? Any broth? 

Breakfast I do 3 eggs, 1 cup milk kefir smoothie with some honey and strawberries, and a 3-4oz ground lamb patty. I have been adding onions and onion powder to the sausage for flavor. 

My husband has beef strips and eggs for breakfast and sometimes he eats some fruits or goes without fruit that meal. 

For lunch I typically have chicken soup with carrots and butternut squash and maybe some cooked plantains on the side. My husband has leftovers from
Previous dinner.  

Our dinner is typically something lamb or chicken with cooked squash, plantains or potatoes/sweet potatoes. Sometimes I make my husband a steak while
I have chicken or lamb. Eating meat and sweet fruit is hard for us. But is that really the secret? And why? 

I’m sensitive to beef so I feel like I’m missing out 😅 I’ve been trying to give my husband more beef so he eats it once or twice a day, but he has almost no dairy (he used to be sensitive now he’s not, but has food ptsd lol). He drinks a cup of broth most days. 

He has had some thinning in his face and hes needed to adjust his belt to be a bit tighter but the scale only lost four pounds. And I’ve lost no weight even though I’ve been doing this since April. 

I snack on raw milk with maple syrup and on milk kefir with honey and blueberries. And I have another cup of raw milk before bed because it helps me fall asleep. Neither of us is tracking, just eating until we are full. No coffee just water and my husband sometimes drinks orange juice.

[US and South Korea Take Steps to Reduce China's Grip on Critical Minerals - Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/america-south-korea-step-reduce-china-news-grip-critical-minerals-1974152)

The Phalanx CIWS is among the many platforms that fire tungsten-cored ammunition.

A South Korean mine has reopened after two decades of disuse, with the potential to be a reliable source of a rare metal critical for modern militaries that China has a near-stranglehold over.

Packing a high energy density and nearly as hard as a diamond, tungsten penetrates targets more effectively than other metals, making it essential for weapons like armor-piercing rounds.

Thanks to its durability, corrosion resistance and high conductivity, tungsten also has a wide range of civilian applications, from industrial cutting tools and light bulbs to electric vehicle batteries and microchips produced by businesses like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Nvidia.

This has major implications for Washington's push to diversify critical supply chains away from countries it considers adversarial.

Most of the U.S.'s imports of critical materials, such as tungsten, tantalum and [rare earth elements](https://www.newsweek.com/chart-shows-world-dependence-china-rare-earth-minerals-1914704) (REEs), are either unavailable or produced in insufficient quantities domestically to ensure self-sufficiency, creating a ""high potential for harm to national security in the event of a supply chain disruption,"" the non-partisan Government Accountability Office wrote in a September report.

Sourcing them from South Korea, a longtime [U.S. security ally](https://www.newsweek.com/us-news-b-1b-bomber-sent-north-korea-doorstep-warning-kim-1979480), is ""vital for national security,"" Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told *Newsweek*.

Concerns over China's near-monopoly on REEs and other critical minerals have grown since former President [Donald Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump) launched a trade war with the world's second-largest economy.

These concerns were compounded by supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic and China's demonstrated willingness to use its dominance over these resources as leverage, such as its temporary REE embargo against Japan in 2010 after a Chinese fishing boat collided with Japanese coast guard vessels, sparking a diplomatic incident.

Under President [Joe Biden](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden), the U.S. administration has continued addressing these vulnerabilities. In September, the Biden administration imposed a 25 percent tariff on tungsten and other critical minerals as part of a broader strategy to protect U.S. industries and reduce reliance on Chinese-controlled supply chains.

""Economic analyses... generally find that the Section 301 tariffs have contributed to reducing U.S. imports of goods from China and increasing imports from alternate sources, including U.S. allies and partners, thereby potentially supporting U.S. supply chain diversification and resilience,"" the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said in a press release.

Enter Sangdong, a sleepy town 115 miles southeast of Seoul in [South Korea](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/south-korea)'s Gangwon Province. Once a major source of South Korea's income, Sangdong's mine shuttered in 1994 as China ramped up tungsten production at a lower cost.

Believed to be one of the largest tungsten sources globally, with 8.7 million tons of proven and probable reserves, Sangdong could reestablish South Korean tungsten on the world stage and serve as a prime example of U.S. ""friend-shoring"" of essential resources.

Canadian firm Almonty Industries acquired the rights to the mine in 2015. Its subsidiary, Almonty Korea Tungsten Corp., reopened operations last month in Gangwon Province.

""Almonty has a rare and unique opportunity at Sangdong, because of the formation of the deposit, to roughly double production capacity from approximately 640 kilotons to 1.2 million tons within two to three years after we start production,"" Almonty Industries CEO Lewis Black told *Newsweek.*

With the inclusion of Sangdong's output, Almonty aims to supply 43 percent of tungsten produced outside China and 12 percent of global supply by 2027. Ultimately, the Sangdong mine could be capable of supplying half of the world's non-Chinese tungsten, Black said.

""Probably the best indication of demand is when customers willingly pay extra,"" Black said regarding trends in sourcing tungsten from non-Chinese suppliers. Almonty's tungsten from its Panasqueira mine in Portugal alone is selling at a 15 percent premium, he noted, citing the tightening supply from ""transparent sources.""

As for Sangdong, the company has secured an ""unprecedented"" floor price of $235 per metric ton unit.

Black said the U.S. government is ""very aware"" of Almonty's operations, particularly at Sangdong, with a United States Geological Survey delegation visiting the site earlier this year. ""We're told USGS will make a 'significant update' on its assessment of the mine in its 2025 report. Sangdong will be a big change in the global tungsten supply chain,"" he said.

""Sangdong provides an alternate source of tungsten supply, which can help reduce the American reliance on Chinese and Russian tungsten,"" Baskaran said.

She predicted the U.S. would commit more funding to develop domestic tungsten mining and processing capabilities through the Defense Production Act, a 1950 law that empowers the government to prioritize and fund essential materials for national defense.

*Newsweek* reached out to the U.S. Department of Defense with a written request for comment.

# OCT. 7th, 2024 ~Mining, critical minerals buoyed by Trump win

[Mining, critical minerals buoyed by Trump win - Mining.com.au](https://mining.com.au/mining-critical-minerals-buoyed-by-trump-win/)

https://preview.redd.it/jzg1mmi57ozd1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d05f9193ac16bf15ffad56720b199380bacc529

A Trump administration is good news for miners, with support expected for sectors including nuclear and critical minerals.

Donald Trump took victory in this week’s US presidential election in a landslide win with nearly 300 votes so far to Kamala Harris’ 226 votes. 

The New York Times forecasts Trump, who will become the country’s 47th President and is the oldest at 78, will take 312 votes in total.

The Republican Party has also taken control of the US Senate, while the House remains undecided. 

Trump labelled the unprecedented win *“the greatest political movement of all time”*. 

*“There’s never been anything like this in this country, and now it’s going to reach a new level of importance because we’re going to help our country heal,”* he said in his victory speech. 

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese congratulated Trump on the victory, saying the election of the President of the United States is always an important moment for the world, for the Indo-Pacific region and for Australia.

*“Our government will work closely with the new Trump administration to realise the benefits of our strong economic partnership,”* he said. 

*“The United States has long played a leadership role in the stability and security of the Indo-Pacific. Australia will strive to strengthen the co-operation between our two nations in the region.”*

In terms of impact on equity markets, Saxo chief macro strategist John Hardy says it is critical to continue to track the US treasury market, and whether bond yields continue to ratchet higher. 

*“At some point, higher yields could begin to act as a headwind on equity prices, especially if they threaten to rise back to the highest levels seen last year (above 5% in the 10-year treasury yield),”* he says.

*“Further, how will the US Federal Reserve behave now that the US election outcome is known?”*

Hardy says any inflationary resurgence will remove further policy easing expectations. 

*“The Fed meets tomorrow and is expected to cut the policy rate by 0.25%, but could soften up its commitment to further easing, even without directly referring to Trump and his administration’s likely agenda,”* he says. 

US markets rallied following the early call on the election, however, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was down 32.20 points, or 0.39%, at 8,167.30 points at 12.44pm AEDT on Thursday (7 November). 

Eight of the 11 sectors, including materials, were in the red. However, energy and industrials advanced 1.11% and 0.32%, respectively.  

On the mining front, Paul Harbidge, CEO of copper explorer Faraday Copper (TSX:FDY), says a Trump-led US government is good news for the mining sector. 

*“I think it’s going to be very interesting, as we’ve seen on the back of the US elections over the last 24 hours that the Trump administration is going to come in,”* he tells *Mining.com.au*. 

*“I know some of his comments have been ‘drill, baby, drill’. So that should be good for the extractive industry. He’s talking about reducing the bureaucracy.”*

Faraday is advancing the 73km^(2) Copper Creek Project in Arizona, which has combined open pit and underground measured and indicated resources totalling 421.9 million tonnes @ 0.45% for 4.2 billion pounds of contained copper.

One beneficiary of a Trump win will be copper, which is not currently on the US Critical Minerals List. 

*“There’s a bill due to go through Congress that would look to bring copper onto the critical metals list,”* Harbidge explains. 

*“Because as far as the US Geological Survey (USGS), copper wasn’t on there, because the US still supplies an adequate percentage of copper in country. That’s based on today’s needs. It’s not forward-looking.* 

*“So there’s a bill to bring copper in, and that could unlock significant funding as well as bringing in permitting reform.* 

*“I think more recently, Biden was very much about environmental and not wanting mining, but due to all the geopolitical risk we’ve seen around the world I think you’ve seen both parties coming together on critical metals and supply chains.* 

*“But I think with the Trump administration, there should be improved catalysts and energy into that.”*

In 2020 during his previous term as President, Trump issued an executive order declaring a national emergency in the mining industry aimed at cutting the country’s dependence on China and strengthening the US supply chain.

According to a review in the USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries 2024, the US was 100% net import reliant for 12 of the 50 critical minerals on the 2022 Critical Minerals List and more than 50% net import reliant for an additional 29.

Meanwhile, on the nuclear front there has been support from both sides for growing the industry.

S&P Global says there has been support during two administrations now for federal funding for advanced nuclear reactor demonstration projects, a more independent nuclear fuel cycle free from Russian dominance, and regulatory streamlining.

*“The Inflation Reduction Act included significant credits for existing and new nuclear units, and congressional support for them remains relatively strong,”* S&P says.  

*“Republicans in Congress are among the biggest supporters of a ban on Russian-enriched uranium passed this year that takes effect fully in 2028.”*

I know a year might seem like a long period, but I needed that time to strengthen my foundational knowledge. On average, I studied for 8 hours a day until the dedicated period, which lasted 40 days and was full-time study.

1. Trust Yourself

I am not a top student and have always been an average person, trying to balance my studies and hobbies to avoid burnout. It is essential to rest and get enough sleep; taking breaks will help you maintain your stamina throughout the journey. Never lose hope—you can achieve your dreams if you stay consistent and give it your all.

2. Resources

 • First Aid (FA): I studied each system and then reinforced my knowledge by doing UWorld questions for the same system. I reviewed FA during my dedicated study period, but don’t overwhelm yourself with it; UWorld is more important.

 • Boards and Beyond (BNB): Only use it when you don’t understand a topic from FA; otherwise, it could be a time-waster.

 • UWorld: The most important resource—start it as early as possible. I regret completing only 50% of it; try to finish the entire QBank and review your marked questions.

 • Sketchy: I used it for microbiology and pharmacology. It’s a game-changer and essential for mastering these topics.

 • Pixorize: A fantastic resource for biochemistry, neurology, and hematology, especially for topics that are easy to forget. Highly recommended.
 • Dirty Medicine: Great for psychiatry, ethics, and challenging topics. The mnemonics are very helpful and memorable.

 • Mehlman: I focused on specific topics like arrows, risk factors, neuroanatomy, and dermatology. These are crucial—don’t skip them before the exam.

 • NBME: I reviewed my mistakes after each practice exam and focused on understanding the concepts. The high-yield image file is essential; I saw 4-5 images from it on my real exam.

My Scores:

 • NBME 24: 46% (50 days out)
 • NBME 25: 50% (40 days out)
 • NBME 26: 54% (30 days out)
 • NBME 27: 60% (25 days out)
 • NBME 28: 60% (20 days out)
 • NBME 29: 62% (17 days out)
 • NBME 30: 65% (12 days out)
 • NBME 31: 75% (7 days out)
 • Free 120: 62% (3 days out) – This really worried me, but I reminded myself to trust my preparation and my NBME scores.

Exam Day:

I didn’t study the day before the exam. Instead, I relaxed, listened to music, walked around, and got about 8 hours of sleep. I don't want to scare you but I have to tell the truth and what I saw on the  exam day. I found  the real test harder than the NBMEs and Free 120. I marked around 20 questions per block, with many experimental and lengthy questions and ethics ethics ethics around 7 in each block, don’t ignore the ethics. However, I approached each block as a new challenge, forgetting about the previous one and focusing on the present. I took breaks after each block, ate nuts, and drank coffee and peanut butter sandwiches for energy. After the exam, I felt certain I had failed and even told my family I didn’t do well—but thankfully, it turned out alright in the end.

Final Thoughts:

When reading someone’s exam experience, take away everything except the timeline—it varies for everyone. I was advised that six months would be enough, but I needed more time. Trust yourself, trust your preparation, and know that you can do it.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask me, I’ll do my best to help. Good luck to everyone!",14,1731069181.0,step1,7,1.0,False

I want to buy a new grinder roughly around 270 euros. I make only espressos (americanos), around 4 a day. I have a DELONGHI EC 260.BK STILOSA

Here is the list of grinders I am considering:

1. Eureka mignon manualle - dont care about the hopper or the fact that switching between drink types is hard
2. MiCoffee DF54 Single Dose - hopefully in stock soon on [amazon.de](http://amazon.de)
3. 1Zpresso J-Ultra - I heard that the grinding quality is a lot better than budget automatic grinders
4. Kingrinder K6 - only if the quality above isnt much better than this manual grinder

1gmh8r5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1gmh8r5/the_weirdest_most_illogical_elevator_ride_ive/,"The weirdest, most illogical elevator ride I've ever experienced.","Hello everyone!

I've been reading stories on this subreddit for some time and never thought that I would ever experience something even remotely similar. But, lo and behold, something pretty odd happened to me in an elevator (of all places), and I'd like to ask your opinion on it? Anyway. As a disclaimer, I'm the type of person who'd rather ignore anything that seems out of the ordinary and go on about their life, and I try to be as rational as possible. However, I keep thinking about this situation. Maybe I interpreted the whole situation wrong, I don't know, I'll let you guys form your own opinion.

Yesterday, I had to pick up a paper for an exam from the university where it's also hosted. I'm not a student there, so I'm not very familiar with the place, and the last time I went there was last year, for a similar exam. Anyway, this is just to give you a little more context. The story goes like this:

The university is extremely crowded, since it's noon. I take the elevator to the 3rd floor, go pick up the paper from one of their offices, then go back to the elevators. I get into the elevator with these two girls.

I stand right next to the buttons. This is my fault too, cause I hesitated to press my floor, but I wasn't sure if the '1' button was the one for the ground floor or for the first floor. Anyway. 

The two girls talk for a bit before pressing the '1' button, first floor (not ground floor, as I figured later, which was the 'P' button) and going silent. Everything is normal so far. 

We get to the first floor. I step out a bit to check if it's the floor I came from - obviously it's not. I get back in. The girls, weirdly, don't get off at the floor and don't say anything either about it. Okay? Maybe they changed their minds but didn't mention it to each other? Whatever.

Three or two people (I can't remember the exact number, but it was more than one person) get in with us from the 1st floor. We'll call them the second group for clarity, cause it's about to get even more complicated. The second group pressed the buttons for the 3rd floor and the 5th floor. Still, normal. 

Now it gets even weirder and I honestly really don't understand why I had no reaction or made no move to say anything. By the way, everyone was quiet. Nobody communicated anything to each other, which I really don't get, since everyone who got in the elevator, was accompanied by at least one other person. 

Anyway. We go back to the damn 3rd floor. On that floor, the two girls get off. The floor that they were previously on, with me. Again, maybe they both realized that they needed to get back to the 3rd floor (but somehow didn't mention it to each other and neither made an attempt to press the 3rd floor button). ANYWAY. The second group, the one who pressed the button for the 3rd floor, doesn't get off at the 3rd floor? Instead, another group of three people with coffee cups steps in. 

And. I'm not fucking with you. One of the people with the coffee cups calmly presses the button for the 3rd. floor. 

Uhm?

Finally, another person in the elevator pressed the button for the ground floor and honestly I was worried that the elevator will just stay stuck on the third floor. But then I felt it going down and I was extremely relieved as we reached the ground floor and I stepped out.

Funnily enough, I look back to see if anyone else got off at the ground floor. Nope. No one. Even if there was one person who pressed the button?!

I leave the university and focus on finding the bus station, forgetting about the whole thing. I get back home and start thinking about it more in depth. What the fuck? Also, *why* the fuck? It's not like anything supernatural or scary happened (besides the weirdly subdued frustration I was feeling because I was unable to leave this damn building already), it just... Made no sense?

It wasn't as if there was one odd person who was acting weird. It wasn't even as if anyone signaled that they'd pressed the wrong button. Everyone involved in the situation (which, need I remind you, were like 7-8 people) behaved illogically. And I don't understand why. It was as if they were mimicking having a destination, when everyone was actually circling back to the 3rd floor. It didn't help that it was silent, no one was communicating anything to anyone like ""Oh I forgot my bag on the 3rd floor..."" or anything of the sort. And I also felt this strange sense of calm mixed with some uneasiness and a sensation I cant describe, as if didn't belong in this situation/space.

I honestly think I was 1) being pranked or just people were playing some kind of game? 2) I'm crazy and understood the whole situation in a profoundly wrong way 3) the students at this university are extremely indecesive and also don't know how an elevator works?

Anyway, thanks for reading and I'd like to hear your thoughts. If you have any questions or there is a part which didn't make sense, let me know. I know that I'm probably making a bigger deal out of it than I should. It was just an interesting situation. My life is very mundane in general lmao.",41,1731068507.0,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,14,1.0,False
