My group and I (four people) are visiting Italy from 19 May to 2 June 2025, and we‚Äôre so excited to immerse ourselves in the country‚Äôs history, culture, food, and natural beauty. We‚Äôve planned a mix of city and countryside experiences but would love input on local gems, unique experiences, and lesser-known spots. I speak a little Italian and would love to get some practice engaging with locals too. Here‚Äôs our itinerary:



**19‚Äì22 May: Rome (Trastevere base)**

We‚Äôre staying in Trastevere to soak up its authentic vibe. We‚Äôre interested in quiet neighborhoods, hidden historic sites, and ‚Äúlive like a local‚Äù experiences. Any ideas for great morning walks, artisan markets, or places locals love for coffee and aperitivo? Also, would appreciate restaurant recommendations here for excellent authentic Italian dishes.



**22‚Äì27 May: Greve in Chianti (Tuscany base at an Agritourismo near Greve)**

We‚Äôll have a car and are keen to explore small, charming villages, scenic drives, and food and wine experiences. We‚Äôre considering a day trip to Val d‚ÄôOrcia, but are there other quaint villages or off-the-beaten-path spots within 1‚Äì1.5 hours of Greve that you‚Äôd recommend? We've got a bunch shortlisted like San Gimignano and the usual suspects, as it were, but are there any vineyards or experiences that are truly noteworthy?



**27‚Äì30 May: Portovenere**

We chose Portovenere for its coastal beauty. Beyond exploring Cinque Terre, we‚Äôd love suggestions for local hikes, hidden beaches, and authentic Ligurian specialties (besides pesto, which we‚Äôre already dying to try). Boat trips, tours etc would be interesting.



**30 May‚Äì2 June: Florence**

We‚Äôre staying near Santa Croce and are looking for authentic neighborhoods to explore, local artisan shops, and perhaps a good spot for an evening aperitivo with fewer tourists. Again, recommendations especially here for exceptional spots to eat (think trattorias with really good local food) would be great. 



**What We‚Äôre Looking For:**

‚Ä¢ Hidden gems: Places off the typical tourist trail.

‚Ä¢ Authentic experiences: Things Italians enjoy that tourists might miss.

‚Ä¢ Food and drink: Regional specialties or unique culinary experiences. Excellent trattorias frequented by locals.

‚Ä¢ Morning runs or peaceful walks - especially in Tuscany and Porto Venere, trail runs.

‚Ä¢ Day trips: Ideas that add variety to our trip, especially in Tuscany.



**More About Us:**

We love quaint towns, natural beauty, architecture, and authentic cuisine. We want to avoid overly crowded places where possible and focus on a mix of structure and flexibility in our trip. We enjoy relaxing strolls, local history, and immersive experiences, so tips from locals or seasoned travelers would be amazing! Budget can stretch for the right experiences, but we're hoping that going for experiences that are less touristic means we can get away with more value here.



If you‚Äôve been to any of these areas or are from Italy, I‚Äôd love your advice on must-see spots, unique experiences, or even small details (like where to grab the best gelato in a quiet piazza or a charming morning market). Your tips would make our trip even more special.



Grazie mille in advance for your help, and I‚Äôll be sure to share highlights from our adventure once we return!",1,1738577211.0,ItalyTravel,1,1.0,False

I've only had the machine for a few days, this is my third batch of ice cream with it, I didn't experience this with the first two.

Recipe: Greek yoghurt, ripe banana, sugar, coconut milk

Last night I just made the top part in lite ice cream mode then re-spin then mix-in some dark chocolate chips and had no problems.

Today it melted on the counter for a few minutes (while I made a coffee) because it felt too hard.

Today I started the bottom part in lite ice cream mode, then re-spin, then mix-in in some nuts, oats and dried fruit.

The weird thing is that only the top part is scratchy where there was no ice cream.

Maybe I scratched it with a spoon earlier and just didn't notice?  
Could the mix-in have caused it or is the machine faulty?

Thank you for your help.

I made up some intricate (admittedly silly) way of getting her number and started talking. Got initially annoyed with the 2 day time period between texts but when I learned about the INFJ text thing I was okay with it. At one point though I did just send a long text and asked her out. She replied pretty quickly saying she was interested in getting to know me too. We set up a time. Month goes by (holidays and family), I had to reschedule our first date that I planned out (walking around and food) and she downgraded me to a coffee date the second time (I joke about the downgrade, maybe that was just better for her). 

I was tired on the date and felt like I wasn‚Äôt the most upbeat. She asked me some serious questions about my previous marriage and stuff, I did my best to Not be nervous but I was \*shrug\* At the end of the date she showed me pictures of her best friends new baby, we saw a cool rainbow outside, I asked if she would be down to play tennis and she reluctantly said yes. We hugged and left with a decent smile. I felt like the date was not super great mostly because of how tired I was. I fumbled through some questions and said some things I shouldn‚Äôt have (No red flags, just not portraying myself the best). Coffee date was about 1 hour and 15 minutes before she said she should probably go because she had some things to get done at home. 

I text her that night and said I had a good time and wanted to try and set something up again if she was free. No reply as per usual, then I gave her a call 2 days later. She quickly replied with ‚ÄúHey, sorry Im out with some friends right now. I really enjoyed our time too! It was cool to get to know you as well. :) I‚Äôve thought about it after our time together and I think it might be best if we just hang as friends. It‚Äôs nothing about you at all. It‚Äôs just preferences and vibes on my part. But I think you‚Äôre v cool and I hope you find what you are looking for v v soon.‚Äú I replied with a ‚Äúif that‚Äôs how you feel that‚Äôs okay. I atleast wanted to say that I didn‚Äôt think the date went all that well. I was really tired and was hoping to do something more active together. But if you want to remain acquaintances then I‚Äôll respect that.‚Äù She comes back with ‚ÄúNo no you were fine! I think I‚Äôm just practicing trusting my gut on these things. But again I think your v cool and would love to remain as friends.‚Äù I was kinda snarky back and said ‚ÄúI hope your gut is really really smart! I‚Äôm mostly joking but I legit get it. Ive had that happen where I didn‚Äôt feel it anymore and it was hard to continue. So no stress.‚Äù She ‚Äòhearted‚Äô the ‚Äôso no stress‚Äô text. \~fin

So clearly a rejection. That was about 5 days ago. I‚Äôm just kind of upset that it was only 1 hour to get to talk to me, and that it was a setting I don‚Äôt thrive in. Coffee dates for an ENFJ are brutal initially. I like to be in experiences and share them with people. That‚Äôs way more my style, something to break up the conversation. That being said, the conversation kept going, there wasn‚Äôt too crazy of awkward silences or anything. 

Question to you all is: is it for sure over over? If we were to hang out as friends and she were to actually enjoy being around me (like an INTJ and ESFP would typically do) as opposed to being on a first date, could something romantic be revisited? Of course assuming that there wasn‚Äôt some other deal breaker that is not an INJF thing. Thoughts? Appreciate y‚Äôall!",1,1738577019.0,infj,0,1.0,False
1igls8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/smarthome/comments/1igls8p/new_invention_idea_inbuilt_hidden_elevating/,New Invention Idea - Inbuilt Hidden Elevating Refrigeration Compartment,"Hello,

I am a 26 year old refrigeration technician with 8 years experience and have previously run my own small company in refrigeration but this isn't something i want to do for my whole life..

As i have a very entrepreneurial spirit and mindset about life i've been thinking of many ways over the years i can get out of the day to day of dealing with shit clients and their shit work and make something more of myself.

So i bring you my idea i would love some feedback on:

Since refrigeration is my passion i would like to design and create something no one has ever seen before, i would like to build and manufacture small self contained units that can be installed under any surface such as, coffee tables, kitchen benches, dining tables, computer desks, poker tables etc the list goes on.

This unit will be about 500mm squared, how it will work is you will need to cut a 400mm circle with a plunge router onto the surface you would like it and keep the cut out section, then the unit will be installed lining up with the hole cut-out and the piece will be reinstalled back into place with a nice stainless circular trim to cover any visible gap. From this point all that will need to happen is a button installation and to be plugged into the powerpoint.

Then you will have a rising refrigerated compartment that will lift up from the table were drinks or food can be placed and for it to drop back down seamlessly back into the surface it had been installed in.

Please feel free to give me feedback if this is something you would want to buy???

What would you realistically pay for something like this??

My ideal clients would be home improvement enthusiasts, builders, tradies, hotels etc.",1,1738576998.0,smarthome,1,1.0,False

1iglqyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/1iglqyw/front_desk_night_audit_expected_to_do_deep_clean/,"Front Desk Night Audit expected to do ""deep clean"" the breakfast area","I haven't had to work a Sunday up until well tonight and the previous shift left me a print-out (per the manager) to follow and do. I have never been trained on ""deep cleaning the breakfast area"" and though I saw it in the files next to our daily checklist I always assumed it was for housekeeping. Nope, it's for Front Desk to do. 

I really want to like Night Audit or Front Desk work. Am I naive to think this isn't within my job description? I'm paid better than some jobs when comparing work load but at the same time I'm not housekeeping. I would understand if this deep cleaning stuff was for the front desk. If I could add an image I would. Here it is typed out word for word:

""Breakfast Deep Cleaning Schedule
Date_________
‚óè  clean juice machine with dishwasher soap (if full put juice in juice pitcher)
‚óè  clean both refrigerators
‚óè clean coffee area (that means empty the trays and wipe dust and stickiness with yellow liquid spray)
‚óè clean inside sugar/tea cabinet
‚óè clean all cabinets and drawers
‚óè clean inside the cereal cabinet
‚óè clean breakfast trays with dishwasher soap (use laundry sink) 
‚óè wash storage containers with dishwashing soap
‚óè if floors are really dirty or spotted clean with clorox and get the spots out with a brush

Note:must be done every Sunday during Audit. Please initial and attach it with your report"" 

Half of this doesn't make sense to me, I have no clue where to get half of it or what it's talking about. I'm tempted to not do it and let my manager know in the morning that i wasn't trained on this. I can clean the refrigerators and coffee areas but beyond that I'm stumped. Thought I was 100% Front desk not 75% front desk 25% housekeeping....",2,1738576861.0,hotels,0,1.0,False

It started off with my smell being completely gone for months (that was my only symptom of covid i never got sick) and soon enough my taste and smell both altered.

My taste never went away completely instead everything just tasted bad. With smells it was like that too. I could partially smell things but they did not smell like how they were supposed to. Everything with garlic in it tastes so awful.. I can't even describe the taste well enough. Coffee and peanut butter were never awful but they still tasted burnt. 

My altered taste/smell went on for a good 2 years. I remember I invested in a pair of swimmer noseplugs. It worked wonders, the food didn't taste awful with them on and I did get used to eating with noseplugs fast. Soon enough everything started smelling/tasting normal again. I was lucky with it. It just kept progressively improving until I no longer needed noseplugs to eat.

Now heres the thing.. Although id say my parosmia has gone away, coffee and peaunt butter still taste altered after 5 years. I remember both these food items tasting so different especially coffee. I used to love coffee but the taste is totally different since having parosmia. It is extremely bitter and very burnt tasting and I miss how it used to taste.

1igllrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1igllrk/struggling_with_getting_husband_to_help_in_the/,Struggling with getting husband to help in the morning,"Outside of nightime/ morning husband and I parent 50/50.

Household chores are probably 80/20 to me but I work 3 days a week and he works full time.

My struggle is in the mornings particularly on my working days.

I get up at 5am 2 hrs before husband and baby to study as I have professional exams in a month.

Husband then expects to wake up at 7. Have coffee brought to him, lounge drinking coffee for 45 mins , run into the shower and leave for work + nursery run.

I find this frustrating as I end up finishing my revision early at 6.30/6.45 to go downstairs , do the dishwasher, feed our cats, make lunch for us , make a milk for the baby , often make breakfast for us too and carry this up on a tray. I usually then have to change the baby‚Äôs nappy and get him ready for nursery and then get ready myself. 

I have raised this numerous times over the past year or so saying I feel like I take on more jobs than I should in the morning, especially as I am the one waking up with the baby at night as husband sleeps through his crying.

Husband says that he just can‚Äôt wake up in the morning and that it‚Äôs too much for a struggle for him. He said he would wake up in the night if I wanted him too but I have explained that‚Äôs pointless as he takes so long to wake up , it‚Äôs honestly just easier for me to grab the baby and run down and take a milk that to wait for him to muster up the energy to get out of bed for 15 mins when I would have woken up from the crying in that time anyway. 

He says he just needs 45 in the morning to just blob and drinking coffee and we have done that for 9 years of marriage so why does it have to change ?

I get that it‚Äôs inconvenient for him but life has changed and I‚Äôm actively going to him saying I‚Äôm struggling with this set up and I need help . I‚Äôm also 31 weeks pregnant btw so mobility and carrying heavy trays of breakfast and drinks isn‚Äôt up there in my strengths right now .

I have suggested he gets up earlier to give himself more time to wake up and therefore more time to help me - he says no , work is stressful and he needs all the sleep he can get

I have suggested bringing the baby downstairs in the morning so he can play in the playroom whilst I crack on with jobs and he can supervise him instead of sticking the tv on for him every morning in bed - he says no , he wants to drink coffee in bed and not have to get up .

I have said I want some days a week where I get brought a cup of tea - he says that‚Äôs sounds fair but in reality I maybe get him doing this once a week and I do the other 6 days 

He is having a very stressful time at work and I get that but I‚Äôm just finding this frustrating . We all have to grow up and adapt to changes in our life . He seems to think I don‚Äôt mind getting up at 5am to work and then do jobs but I do? I‚Äôm knackered , heavily pregnant and studying for medical exams . If anything I think I should be the one getting some extra sleep whilst he runs around for me .

The bit about him struggling to wake up is true and I find it bizarre . I‚Äôm a morning lark so when I‚Äôm up I‚Äôm up but he is literally in a daze for at least an hour.

This message is a bit peculiar. I currently live in Spain, I am dedicated to episode design, expert in persuasion and sales. I have a marketing agency that is working very well, but I have been thinking about creating an online store dedicated to coffee for some time.

I have several options on the table:

1. Dropshipping. It is the one I like the least, since you do not control the sales process. And also, creating a brand is very unstable.

2. Partner. Find someone who already has an online coffee store and wants to improve it. If this service also has a physical location, even better.

Has anyone experienced any of these situations?

1iglekk,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1iglekk/michaels_world/,Michael‚Äôs World,"The lights flicker, unwilling to die out even if it's been like that for months. Three, then two, then three again. It is almost like Morse code. Wonder if anyone else notices it. Life here is monotonous and soul-sucking, yet I still return.

It's been like this ever since, so much so that I've despised myself as to why I am here. At least the routine helps. Keeps me grounded, or else I won't know what to do with myself.

At times, I thought about quitting, but recently, I was given no choice due to problems appearing out of nowhere.¬†

Problems that spiraled out of my control.

I have seemingly involved myself in a mess involving my wife, Sarah, and her lover, Thomas‚Ä¶

Even now, I sometimes catch whispers, even at work. I used to be bitter at those comments but let them be over time. Though I keep little notes every now and then.

Now, I'm just going with the flow, continuing to work. The money helps maintain some semblance of normalcy or at least as normal as things can get.

I have bills to pay and an adopted pet to feed. Funny how this has become my life now. I never saw myself as a pet owner, never even wanted one. But somehow, it all worked out.

The clock ticks down to its final moments, and my work for the day is done; it's time to head home.

I checked my watch - 5:30 PM, right on time. Exiting the old office building, I walked down the cracked sidewalks of the main road.¬†

Cars passed by, noisy as ever. A few minutes later, I reached the street, entering a small community neighborhood, a brief escape from the city's noise. My house is just a tiny distance down.

As the noise faded, I breathed a sigh of relief, my mind wandering as usual. Lately, my life has revolved around just two things: work and Tom. I named him after my favorite cartoon as a kid.¬†

He's been on my mind more than usual. My notepad fills with notes during meetings - feeding schedules, exercise routines, and strategies to make his transition easier.

This reminds me that Tom gets anxious if dinner's late, and I hate seeing him distressed. The sounds he made when that happened startled me the first time. He used to be a bit loud, but with a few quick adjustments here and there, he's much calmer now, better than ever.¬†

These days, I can't help but wonder what my life would be like without Tom. Probably far away from all this. But now, I have someone to care for, which changes everything.

I pause, taking in the familiar scene as more residential buildings become visible. The walk is short but revealing. Neighbors wave from their afternoon routines, their smiles never quite reaching their eyes.

Mrs. Johnson's wave seems shakier these days. Mr. Peterson barely looks my way anymore. They must know something's changed, but they don't understand. They can't.

Passing by, a flash of familiar features caught my eye - A face smiling from a poster. Fresh ink and all. A bitter sound came out of me, a slight chuckle.

Someone's been busy putting up new ones. Probably Thomas's wife. I don't know why she desperately looks for the man who left her. That smile in the photo - the same one Thomas wore that day. Even now, even after everything.

I suppress a smile, crumpling the paper and throwing it to the side before continuing. I vividly remember the day I found Sarah and Thomas together.

The sounds they made were... less than human. Fitting, really, considering how things turned out.

Neighbors watched as I did that, but none told me off. Rumors of what happened probably fueled their reactions. In a small community like this, information tends to spread faster.

They sometimes look at me with pity as I walk by, but the disappointment in their eyes says everything about my choices.

Upon arriving, the key turns in the lock, and I hear the familiar shuffle inside, then silence. 'I'm home,' I call out softly. As usual, there's no response. I've grown used to that.¬†

My footsteps echo against the bare walls as I step inside. In the corner sits one of Tom's makeshift sleeping areas, spaces I modified for his‚Ä¶ unique circumstances.

He's still adjusting, I tell myself.

He was a gift from Bob, barely a week after all the drama. A good companion, he says.

At first, I resisted, but he was persistent. He said I deserved it after everything I'd been through, his words carrying a hint of expectation, almost as if I should feel grateful. It took time to accept what he was saying, but something shifted inside me when I looked into its eyes. Eventually, I brought him home.

""Hey, bud,"" I whisper, gently patting his head. He trembles slightly, his wide eyes reflecting what some might mistake for fear.

Bob assured me it was normal, that it would pass with time. Tom was a rescue, after all, and this was just part of the rehabilitation process.

It was my first time owning a pet, and the whole thing felt strange. But I know, with time, I can learn to be a better owner for him too.

Besides, Bob gave me some kind of guidebook for this. Though most information written is useless at this stage.

Bob was strange. He collected people's stories like others collected stamps, with an enthusiasm that bordered on obsession. We met not long after Sarah left, though the circumstances were anything but ordinary.

The first contact came through Sarah's phone. A text, then a call. He claimed he'd bought it from her, said she sold it as partial payment for his ""services."" The way he lingered on that last word made my skin crawl. Then he dropped the real bombshell: Sarah owed him, and since my number was the only one still saved on her phone, he figured I might cover the rest.

Her debts. Her lies. My responsibility. I felt sick.

At first, he was aggressive, his tone sharp and demanding. But something shifted when I didn't respond. His voice softened, almost... patient. ""Look,"" he said, ""I'm not here to cause trouble. I just want what's owed."" Against my better judgment, or maybe because I had nothing left to lose, I agreed to meet him.

We met in a small caf√© downtown, the kind of place where no one asks questions. I sat with cash in my pocket and a coffee that had long since gone cold. When he arrived, I was struck by how unremarkable he looked. He wasn't what I'd imagined. No sinister aura, no flashy bravado. Just a man with a forgettable face, and eyes that felt too sharp, too knowing.

""Well, I'll be damned,"" he said, smiling like an old friend. ""You actually showed up.""

I shouldn't have stayed, but I did. We talked or rather, he spoke, and I listened. Hours seemed to pass, the cash in my pocket forgotten. Bob had this way of pulling information from me without realizing it. Every detail I shared seemed to excite him, his gaze growing brighter, more intense. It wasn't until he leaned forward, his voice low and conspiratorial, that I felt the full weight of his presence.

""You know,"" he said, almost casually, ""I could help you get back at her.""

I laughed, sharp, bitter, hollow. ""And why would you want to help me?""

His grin widened, but there was no warmth in it. ""Let's just say I have a vested interest in people like Sarah getting what they deserve. You, though... you're interesting. I'd hate to see you waste an opportunity.""

I wanted to leave. My gut told me to walk away and never look back. But I stayed. Maybe it was his words or how his gaze seemed to hold me in place. Or perhaps I just didn't care anymore.

That first meeting set the tone for what came next. He reached out again, and I answered. I can't explain why. Curiosity? Desperation? Whatever it was, I got drawn deeper into his orbit. He always had a way of making it seem like I was the one seeking him out.

Over time, he pried more out of me, my anger, regrets, and connection to Sarah. Each piece of information seemed to light a spark in him like he was piecing together some grand puzzle. I should have been alarmed by how much he seemed to enjoy it, but I was too numb to care.

""You're wasted on her, you know,"" he told me once. ""All that anger, all that hurt, just sitting there, eating you alive. What if you could do something about it?""

I never answered him, not directly. But I kept showing up. I don't know what I was hoping for, closure, maybe, or just someone to tell me what to do. Bob never gave me answers, though. He gave me tools. Options.

And then, one day, he was gone.

The last message I got from him was cryptic, just like everything else about him. ""Laying low for a while. Take care of yourself, and Tom.""

Looking back, I'm unsure what scares me more: how much of myself I gave away to Bob or how much of him still lingers in me.

The clock ticking breaks me from my musing, and my evening unfolds like a well-rehearsed play. Shoes by the door. Briefcase on the counter. Dinner preparations begin at 6:15. As the food cooks, I guide Tom to his spot in the living room.

""Hungry?"" I ask, not expecting an answer. He twitches slightly and scurries around. Seeing him okay, I finally decided to go to the kitchen.

I prepare two bowls with practiced precision. Mine is a microwaved lasagna, while Tom's is a carefully measured mixture of food and some medicine I searched online based on the guidebook. It was working, so I continued to feed it to him.

A scratching sound comes from the corner. ""Patience,"" I whisper. ""It's almost done. Just relax, bud"". I said just as the scratching stopped.

Dinner is ready, and I move to the living room. I turn on the TV. The news drones about missing cases. The numbers keep rising in our town three this month alone. I changed the channel, it was too depressing.

Tom gets agitated when they show photographs. I feed him carefully, watching with quiet satisfaction as he accepts each spoonful.

Night falls, bringing a different silence to the house, and I stare at the ceiling. Not like before. My mind keeps memories that refuse to fade. Perhaps I missed her more than I thought, but her betrayal left me hollow.

It's just Tom and me now. Tucked in the sleeping area I made for him, he whimpers softly as I head to bed, his eyes following my every move.

""Good night, Tom,"" I whisper as I drift off, feeling his gaze from the darkness. Sometimes, I hear him trying to speak, but that's impossible. Pets don't talk. At least, mine doesn't anymore.

As I felt myself slipping off, I knew I was in for another rough night.

I woke violently, jerked from another nightmare. A sigh escapes my lips as consciousness creeps back, leaving me groggy and disoriented. It's been like this since last month, the nightmares, the cold sweats. Then I feel my heart grow heavier, I don't know why, but it gets like this.

Sarah used to say I talked in my sleep. Now Tom listens instead, his eyes darting to mine the moment I wake. Sometimes, I think I see Sarah's face in those reflections.

The day everything changed is burned into my mind with perfect clarity. The wooden floors in our home still creak in that particular way, the third board from the kitchen entrance.

Sarah always avoided it when slipping out for her ""afternoon walks."" Something bitter and dark coiled in my stomach as I counted those walks. Twice a week became three times, then four.

Thomas from next door would wave to me every morning. ""Beautiful day, isn't it?"" he'd say, standing by his mailbox in that expensive running gear he'd started wearing. He was on Such a health kick, Sarah had mentioned it over dinner once, twice, and many more times. ""The neighbors say he's really transformed himself,"" she'd say, not meeting my eyes. I wonder if she noticed that she was repeating herself more and more, day by day.

Then came the excuses. Even when I saw them together, they were getting too confident. Several times, I threw hints at Thomas' wife; she knew but denied it harder than I did.

I found the truth in pieces, each discovery like a knife twisting deeper. I had a phone here. A misplaced note there. Text messages that painted pictures I couldn't unsee.

Fifteen years of marriage reduced to evidence of betrayal, cataloged in my mind like specimen slides under a microscope. Each revelation changed something in me and broke down another barrier between what I was and what I could become.

The funny thing about betrayal is that it awakens parts of you that you never knew existed. Some people just take their losses and move on, but others... Others find ways to make things right. I think I just needed the right person to push me.

However, by the end, it led me to Tom. At least I got something out of it.

Dragging myself from bed with a renewed sense of purpose. My morning routine unfolds with practiced precision. Fix the bed, check the blackout curtains, and collect my pet from his sleeping area.

Tom's quite heavy now, healthier than before. ""Almost there,"" I whisper, my voice catching as we pass Sarah's photo in the hallway. That helpless smile she wore still mocks me, but I shake it off and continue to the living room.

I placed him in his spot in the living room and prepared breakfast for the two of us; the usual‚Ä¶

The doorbell's sharp ring fractures the silence. Must be the neighbors again.

Tom grows restless at the sound, he always does when we have visitors. ""Now, let's go to your special place again, okay, bud.""

The storage space on the stairs has become Tom's sanctuary in cases like this. ""Just for a little while,"" I whisper soothingly, stroking his still-injured flesh. ""We don't want to make our guests uncomfortable, do we?"".

A whimper answers me, so quiet now, barely audible. Such improvement from those early days of screeching. Back when Tom still thought Sarah would save him.

¬†The stitches are healing nicely. Can't risk making visitors uncomfortable with his... condition.¬†

I straighten my tie and check my reflection. The smile in the mirror looks almost natural now, though something wild dances behind my eyes. Practice makes perfect, after all.

Sarah never appreciated my dedication to self-improvement. Neither did Thomas, in the end. But Tom... Tom understands. He has no choice but to understand.

Another performance, I say.

But before I can reach for the handle, the silence shatters as the door explodes inward, cold metal snapping around my wrists before I can even react, as I was slammed into the floor.

Several moments later, police are flocking into my house. Well‚Ä¶ the fun's over. It was my mistake thinking I could go on like this for much longer. But there are more pets to discover, especially where I think I'm going.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

The click of the handcuffs feels like the final period at the end of one story, and the beginning of another. In the background, I can hear Tom whimpering from his room. Poor boy. He never did learn to stay quiet when it mattered most.

Bob warned me this might happen when I accepted his deal. 'Some people just won't understand my work,' he'd said. And that's fine. It's too bad, though, Tom should've had a friend. But there was a hiccup with that one. Things happen.' Bob's catchphrase, as always, echoes in my mind.

Bob said he found her along with Tom but got careless and freed her to that extent.¬†

Bob had pictures, and when I saw their faces staring back at me, I guess that's when I lost whatever humanity I had left.

Seeing them stripped bare like that reminded me too much of the day I found them together. The memory clouded my thoughts more than I ever expected. Maybe that‚Äôs when I stopped thinking altogether.

It makes me happy, though, that even in the short time we spent together, I had you, Tom. I will miss you, and I hope one day you‚Äôll come back to me, where you belong.

For now, I‚Äôm just biding my time. I know I won‚Äôt be let out indefinitely, but whispers of Bob‚Äôs name keep reaching my ears, even here. Strange, isn‚Äôt it? He‚Äôs still out there. His name moves through the mouths of other inmates like smoke, wisps of his influence everywhere.

I can hear¬†[Detective Cortez](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuietCornerTales/comments/1i7yno9/michaels_world_a_cops_duty/)¬†pacing outside the interrogation room. He‚Äôs never been good at hiding his footsteps. If he‚Äôs listening, maybe he‚Äôs wondering why I‚Äôm so calm.

[Bob‚Äôs](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuietCornerTales/comments/1i7yopa/michaels_world_bobs_toy/)¬†words echo in my head, as clear as the day he said them:¬†*‚ÄúSome people just can‚Äôt understand our work, Donovan.‚Äù*¬†I‚Äôm starting to see his point now.

It‚Äôs in a few days. Before this, I was about to may the online payment and would cancel it at the last second. Then I had a short mental exercise after which I booked my flight with ease. 

First. Am I trying to avoid death? That is stupid. Death is inevitable. Also, I could literally die of anything.

Second. Does this fear mean anything? Not at all. I‚Äôve had stronger fears over the most stupid of things. So just because I have anxiety over flight, it doesn‚Äôt mean anything.

Third (and most important). Why not look positively? I am going to land at one of the best airports in the region and enjoy some great coffee. I love that airport. Also, I‚Äôve had tens of flights and I have experienced moderate turbulence only on one of them. This idea actually cleared the mental fog. Flying can be such a positive experience. I decided to cancel all the negative scenarios and said ‚Äòit‚Äôs gonna be fine‚Äô. That sentence did all the magic. It‚Äôs gonna be fine!

It‚Äôs gonna be fine. What if it didn‚Äôt? Well, who cares? People die of all sorts of things. Yesterday a neighbor‚Äòs young child died swallowing food! Am I going to avoid eating forever? 

Fourth: The alternative was going to be a 36 hour bus drive which would involve being with some dodgy people on the border and possible humiliation by the border police. While the flight will be with people of a certain background and character (most of the time).

Fifth. The budget difference between the bus trip and the flight was huge. But then asked myself, if I don‚Äôt spend this money on myself, whom I going to spend it on? F*** it and book it. 

Sixth. As I was about to book the flight, I saw that the weather won‚Äôt be perfect on the day I fly. There is going to be snow etc but I was already convinced and a possible weather forecast wasn‚Äôt strong enough to change my mind. 

I convinced myself that booking the flight was the best decision. I don‚Äôt feel anxious at all. I actually feel excited to see my favorite airport again.

Here‚Äôs how you can use AI effectively to level up your content:  

Let AI handle repetitive tasks like grammar checks, keyword optimization, and formatting.

[Tools like Simplified .Ai](https://simplified.com/?fpr=sevensky) , Grammarly or Jasper can save you time, so you can focus on the creative side of writing.  

To make AI-generated content feel natural, use conversational prompts. For example, ‚ÄúExplain the benefits of meditation as if you‚Äôre chatting with a friend over coffee.‚Äù 

Add personal anecdotes or humor to make it relatable. Avoid robotic repetition by asking the AI to vary sentence length and structure.  

Feed the AI your brand‚Äôs style guide tone, vocabulary, and sentence structure. 

For instance, ‚ÄúWrite in a friendly, approachable tone, using simple language to explain complex tech concepts.‚Äù This ensures consistency across your content.  

AI-generated content is a starting point, not the final product. Refine it by adding your unique insights, opinions, or storytelling. Use AI detection tools to ensure it feels natural and human-like.  
  
Encourage the AI to use analogies, metaphors, and varied sentence complexity for a more organic flow. For example, ‚ÄúExplain blockchain technology using a pizza analogy.‚Äù  

Save effective prompts for future use. For example:  

- ‚ÄúWrite a blog post about sustainable gardening in a conversational tone, including personal anecdotes.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúCreate a Twitter thread explaining cryptocurrency basics to beginners, using simple analogies and humor.‚Äù  

Use AI to generate questions, polls, or thought-provoking conclusions that encourage interaction. 

For example, ‚ÄúEnd the blog post with a question that invites readers to share their experiences.‚Äù

I am a 26 year old refrigeration technician with 8 years experience and have previously run my own small company in refrigeration but this isn't something i want to do for my whole life..

As i have a very entrepreneurial spirit and mindset about life i've been thinking of many ways over the years i can out of the day to day of dealing with shit clients and their shit work and make something more of myself.

So i bring you my idea i would love some feedback on:

Since refrigeration is my passion i would like to design and create something no one has ever seen before, i would like to build and manufacture small self contained units that can be installed under any surface such as, coffee tables, kitchen benches, dining tables, computer desks, poker tables etc the list goes on.

This unit will be about 500mm squared, how it will work is you will need to cut a 400mm circle with a plunge router onto the surface you would like it and keep the cut out section, then the unit will be installed lining up with the hole cut-out and the piece will be reinstalled back into place with a nice stainless circular trim to cover any visible gap. From this point all that will need to happen is a button installation and to be plugged into the powerpoint.

Then you will have a rising refrigerated compartment that will lift up from the table were drinks or food can be placed and for it to drop back down seamlessly back into the surface it had been installed in. one step further i was thinking of creating a new business that will build and construct these into epoxy coffee tables, desks and other furniture items.

My first integration of this unit will be in a beautiful epoxy resin top coffee table, thinking of also adding in JBL hidden speakers, fingerprint lockable draw, wireless charging pad etc, but these are just ideas for the coffee table the main show will be the lifting refrigerated compartment

Please feel free to give me feedback if this is something you would want to buy???

What would you realistically pay for something like this??

Epoxy resin tables go from 2k -5k plus this design no one's seen before, i was thinking the baseline model starting from 3.5k roughly, what do you guys think?

If just a standard table top can be much much cheaper, or should i sell the unit for the client to install themself?",3,1738574232.0,smallbusiness,3,1.0,False

I‚Äôve tried going for him, but when I‚Äôm there, I feel physically uncomfortable, almost sick. It‚Äôs hard because I once put so much into the church, and now it feels like a painful reminder of something I no longer connect with.

My spouse often comes home frustrated or in a terrible mood because I didn‚Äôt go. It feels like a weekly cycle of tension, and I don‚Äôt know how to break it. Another thing that makes me uncomfortable is when he tells me, ‚ÄúSo-and-so asked about you and misses you.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt feel like genuine concern‚Äîmore like a subtle way of reminding me that people are noticing my absence, as if they‚Äôre judging me or discussing it with him. It just adds to the pressure. (I also find it strange that they‚Äôre so concerned but haven‚Äôt reached out to me directly‚Äîjust talk about me to my spouse.)

Make some tea or coffee and sit somewhere comfortable.

Over the last few days, I‚Äôve finally had time to relax, without being overwhelmed by emotions, I can actually think clearly. It‚Äôs obvious that I love you and care for you relentlessly. The last five years with you have been a real rollercoaster, and I‚Äôve truly enjoyed every moment. In fact, it‚Äôs been the most thrilling ride of my life.

We‚Äôve laughed, cried, and fought countless times. Most of those fights were over silly things we didn‚Äôt even remember by morning. Others were more serious and required sensitivity and understanding to work through. But we did.

These past few weeks have been horrible. In some ways, it feels like you‚Äôve only been talking to me out of guilt. Maybe that‚Äôs not true, but it‚Äôs how it feels. I have loved our relationship, xxx. I have loved you and cared for you relentlessly through everything. I‚Äôve been there whenever you needed me. Helping you through your alcoholism was one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever done. It was really painful watching someone I love so much be in such a destructive state, not just to themselves but to others and especially to myself. But we got through it.

After being with someone for so long, the excitement and newness of a relationship can fade, but something even more beautiful grows, a deep bond between two people who truly know and love each other, we are there through anything and support one another's growth and that is the kind of maturity I want in my wife, I thought that‚Äôs what we had. We could talk about what made us happy, what made us sad whatever it was, we were best friends. And that‚Äôs how I still felt, even after you suddenly decided you‚Äôd rather be with someone else during my weak point.

When you told me you weren‚Äôt happy and brought up issues you had never mentioned before, it hurt. Especially since you used to get upset at me for bringing up something from the past but now, here we are, and you‚Äôve done the same, but to another level entirely and it really hurts like a knife stabbed in my heart from the person I thought loved me with her whole being and wanted to marry me. And I think deep down, you know I would have changed all these things in a heartbeat for you. Because you know that I truly loved you not the kind of love that forms in a few months, but the kind that‚Äôs unbreakable regardless of the adversities we face.

Maybe, in some ways, that was taken for granted.

Whatever the case, I believe ending things here is the best thing to do. I was holding on to the words you once said to me, and I really thought you still meant them. I‚Äôve been angry, upset, and confused, but now I‚Äôm at peace because I know I did my best.

Have I made mistakes? Of course. And recently, I‚Äôve been at my worst, right when I needed you the most. But I would have changed in a heartbeat to make you happy, xxx.

I hope you find someone that makes you happy whether it‚Äôs this guy or another. I still truly love you and ultimately that means I want you to be happy, regardless of everything I want you to smile every single day, because you have been through so much and you deserve to have a bright smile on that beautiful face of yours every single day, so don‚Äôt cry because you will one day I promise, because you are beautiful, kind and fearlessly protective of those you love and I think you have a beautiful heart.

I will continue to grieve for a while. But even through the sadness, I feel grateful. I got to love you. I got to smile at the thought of you. You truly brought me joy, and I was so excited to be your husband and have a house with you, my little Hades and Cricket and yes even Jasper all of who I will truly miss as I felt like I was really their dad.

I love you so much, xxx. Thank you for being mine. I had a wonderful time with you on this earth ever since you came to me on that trampoline because I was sad because I really liked you and I wasn‚Äôt brave enough to come talk to you myself having you kiss me on the forehead and give me one of your favorite soft toy scar made me sleep happily, I will cherish and remember the beautiful moments we shared.

I love you so much I truly hope you find the happiness you deserve xxx.

Following up on my first Reddit post about starting my Italian coffee business ‚Üí In this step, I‚Äôll dive deeper into how I selected my coffee blends and the challenges I faced. If you haven‚Äôt read the first part, here‚Äôs the link:

üîó https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/s/nkt7Gz8Ufi

As I mentioned before, I visited two roasters: Lollo Caff√® and Mokarico.

I visited their facilities, observed their work, and loved their approach to roasting, processing, and presenting their coffee culture.

Adapting to COVID & Setting a Budget

When COVID hit, my plans had to change. I couldn‚Äôt visit caf√©s or meet roasters in person, so I had to do everything online.

The first important steps I took were:

I didn‚Äôt want to go to a bank and take out a loan, so I started with my own savings.

üí∞ Budget: 1,500 EUR ‚Üí Roasters typically require at least double this amount for a first order.

Since I requested freshly roasted coffee instead of their pre-stocked production, they had to use fresh green coffee beans and roast them specifically for me as a reseller.

Negotiating with Roasters

I had to convince them that future orders would be larger. They agreed but required upfront payments for the next few orders.

This meant reinvesting almost everything I earned in the beginning. It wasn‚Äôt easy, but it taught me a valuable lesson:

üí° Starting a business doesn‚Äôt make you rich overnight. Like a plant, like a child‚Äîyou have to nurture it, feed it, and help it grow every single day.

My Selection Process

Since I had already secured agreements with Mokarico and Lollo Caff√®, I requested 250g sample bags of their blends. I also invested in a Breville Barista Pro, a small kitchen scale, and the necessary accessories to properly tamp and extract coffee.

Why?

Because I believe that if you want to stand out, you need to advise before you sell. That means:
‚úÖ Knowing your products inside and out
‚úÖ Refining your expertise
‚úÖ Understanding which coffee suits each customer‚Äôs expectations

Learning the Craft

Mokarico was incredibly professional‚Äîthey even provided me with a small booklet covering the basics of coffee selection:

‚úÖ Harvesting methods
‚úÖ Drying techniques
‚úÖ How green coffee is sorted and selected
‚úÖ The ‚Äúcupping‚Äù process ‚Äì how professionals taste and evaluate coffee quality (crucial for specialty coffee)

I also explored trendy brewing methods. I bought a Hario V60 filter coffee maker to experiment with specialty coffee. For this, I tried blends from Gearbox Coffee Roasters, a brand managed by the nephew of Mokarico‚Äôs owner in Florence.

My Selection Criteria

I‚Äôve contacted not less than 16 roasters, and am adding some of them progressively in my product range. 

I wanted to create a specific aroma profile‚Äîa carefully curated selection of flavors.

üîπ To me, ‚Äúbody‚Äù and ‚Äúintensity‚Äù are two distinct aspects of coffee:
	‚Ä¢	A ‚Äústrong‚Äù coffee often has a bitter-sweet balance‚Äîbitterness softened by caramelized sugars.
	‚Ä¢	Intensity, on the other hand, is how a coffee spreads and lingers in the mouth without being overwhelming. A truly intense coffee is enjoyable without sugar, leaving a lasting, pleasant aftertaste.

So here is why I made my first selection with these roasters : 

The blends I selected

üî• Mokarico Rossa ‚Äì Full-bodied, rich, velvety‚Äîlike melted dark chocolate with exquisite bitter cocoa notes.

‚òï Mokarico ‚ÄúColumbia‚Äù ‚Äì Despite its name, it doesn‚Äôt contain Colombian coffee! Instead, it‚Äôs a carefully balanced Arabica blend with a touch of Robusta for a nice crema and smoother taste of hazelnut, with a bitter-like sweetness. The PERFECT cappuccino blend in my opinion ! Brazil - Ethiopia - Ivory Coast - Tanzania 

üåç more Mediterranean-style blends ‚Äì Many South Italian expats in Belgium crave a bold, spicy coffee. However, I wanted to avoid the over-roasted, ashy taste often found in Southern Italian blends. My goal was intensity without astringency‚Äîno overly bitter, dry-mouth sensations. Lollo Caff√® had a range that fit perfectly.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Lollo Nero : A lot of robusta with a touch of arabica  (Uganda, Angola and Burundi), a blend full of character 

‚ÅâÔ∏è YES I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ALL THINKING RIGHT NOW, but this one really has strong tobacco aftertaste and loooooots of body, everybody doesn‚Äôt love red plum and jasmine flower flavor speciality coffee, we can‚Äôt exclude other people‚Äôs desires, but need to adapt to their needs (and yes, of course, educate them to make them discover finer tastes if they agree to ! 

2Ô∏è‚É£Lollo Classico : The signature blend. Classico because it is their idea of Napoli espresso : pleasant spicy touch, black pepper, without a round and progressive caramel aftertaste thanks to the balance of robusta and arabica that they use here. Velvety crema. 

3Ô∏è‚É£ Lollo Oro : The ‚Äúafternoon‚Äù coffee. 90/10 Arabica/Robusta. Very subtle lemon aroma, before leaving again a bit of this naturally sugar touch on the palate, not too ‚Äúinvading‚Äù aftertaste (drink a glass of water and you get again a clean mouth). Fits very well of affogato or with a tiramisu for example ! 

I‚Äôm explaining here with my words how I feel them, so my apologies if some terms I use could sound strange. But at least you understand the idea behind selecting the coffees and making such a research.

Unexpected Challenges & Lessons Learned

1Ô∏è‚É£ Customs & Taxes

Belgium taxes coffee imports, and I learned this the hard way.

üö® I received a fine because I wasn‚Äôt aware of the regulations.

Before importing, you need to register with customs and ensure compliance with tax laws. You have to use a program called PLDA, on which you have to put the precise quantities and separate your ‚Äútypes‚Äù of coffee (only roasted coffee and coffees with added flavor have different taxes)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Expanding My Product Range

At first, I wanted to focus only on high-quality espresso blends. But in Belgium, capsule machines (Nespresso & Dolce Gusto) are everywhere.

I wasn‚Äôt excited about selling capsules, but customers kept asking for them. So, I adapted:

‚úÖ I introduced flavored capsules (hazelnut cappuccino, pistachio, etc.) along with premium-quality espresso capsules.
‚úÖ This helped me reach a wider audience, including customers who later switched to bean-to-cup machines.
‚úÖ Thanks to word-of-mouth, many capsule users discovered my fresh coffee selection and started to advise my store to customers who use coffee beans or even better : switched to better-quality beans and replaced their coffee machines !

Because let‚Äôs be honest: who would buy coffee from an unknown website, especially today, with so many big brands and scam websites making people wary?

When starting a business, it is important to know what ‚Äúthey‚Äù want and what we ideally would like them ‚Äúto want‚Äù.

Reaching Customers in a COVID World

With caf√©s closed, I had to find new ways to promote my coffee:

‚úÖ Selling directly via Facebook & Instagram Live.
‚úÖ Growing visibility through customer recommendations.

Because again, let‚Äôs be honest: who truly enjoys filming themselves in front of strangers, explaining the complexity of a coffee blend to a phone screen‚Äîwithout even being able to let people taste it?

But this is also part of being an entrepreneur:

üî• You HAVE to adapt. There‚Äôs no other choice.

Any method is good if it helps you get known by more people.

(As long as it doesn‚Äôt involve threatening or k**ling anyone üòÇ)

-------------------------------------------------------------

Are you a coffee lover looking to spice up your kitchen with home decor that reflects your passion? You can turn your kitchen space into a cozy coffee-themed sanctuary, making it not only beautiful but also functional. Here are creative ways to incorporate coffee-inspired decor into your kitchen.

### 1. Coffee Wall Art

One of the easiest ways to express your love for coffee is by incorporating wall art. Consider hanging framed prints that feature coffee quotes, beans, or artistic representations of coffee cups. You can even create a gallery wall with different sizes and styles of frames. Look for art that reflects your personal style ‚Äì whether it be rustic, modern, or minimalist.

### 2. Creative Mug Displays

Your collection of coffee mugs deserves a spotlight. Instead of hiding them in a cabinet, display them creatively. Here are some ideas:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/kitchen-home-decor-coffee  
  
- **Floating Shelves:** Install floating shelves on an empty wall to showcase your favorite mugs along with other decorative items like small plants.
- **Mug Tree:** A mug tree provides a functional and charming display, allowing you easy access to your mugs while adding visual interest.
- **Chalkboard Signs:** Label different sections of your mug collection using chalkboard signs for a playful touch.

### 3. Cozy Textile Choices

Transform your kitchen with textiles that feature coffee themes. Think dish towels, tablecloths, and curtains that showcase coffee beans, cups, or even latte art. These small changes can greatly warm up the space and make it more inviting. Mixing different patterns and textures will create a cohesive look that is both charming and stylish.

### 4. Creative Storage Solutions

Not everything about coffee decor needs to be purely decorative. Consider clever and stylish storage solutions for your coffee supplies. Here‚Äôs how:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/kitchen-home-decor-coffee  
  
- **Glass Jars:** Store your coffee beans and grounds in clear glass jars. This method is both practical and aesthetically pleasing.
- **Wooden Bins:** Use wooden bins labeled with ‚ÄúCoffee‚Äù or ‚ÄúBeans‚Äù to contain items like filters, pods, or flavored syrups.
- **Repurposed Furniture:** Antique or vintage furniture can be a unique way to store coffee essentials. A small side table with drawers can serve this purpose beautifully.

### 5. Coffee-Themed Centerpieces

Make your kitchen table the focal point with a coffee-themed centerpiece. You might try:

- **Coffee Bean Vases:** Fill clear vases with coffee beans and place a candle or a small bouquet of faux flowers on top for an eye-catching look.
- **Rustic Trays:** Use a wooden or metal tray to gather your coffee items like sugar, creamers, and a small plant.
- **Cozy Table Runners:** A table runner with coffee graphics can tie the whole theme together while keeping your space tidy.

### 6. Unique Furniture Choices

Choosing the right furniture can also elevate your coffee-themed kitchen decor. Consider a kitchen island or cart that has a rustic finish. A dining table with a reclaimed wood top can complement the coffee theme perfectly. Adding barstools with coffee-toned upholstery can further enhance the aesthetic. This blend of aesthetics and function creates a warm and welcoming environment for coffee enthusiasts.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/kitchen-home-decor-coffee  
  
### 7. Scented Candles and Coffee Accessories

Adding scented candles with coffee aromas can make your kitchen feel warm and inviting. Furthermore, incorporating accessories such as coffee grinders, pour-over sets, or specialty coffee makers can double as decor. A stylish coffee maker on the countertop not only looks great but also serves a daily purpose!

By blending functionality with creativity, you can create a kitchen atmosphere that revolves around your love for coffee. Every detail, from art to textiles, can reflect this theme, making your space uniquely yours. Start transforming your kitchen into a coffee-themed haven today!

The Impact of Color and Style on Your Coffee Station's Aesthetic Appeal
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a cozy and inviting coffee station in your kitchen can transform your daily caffeine ritual into a delightful experience. The right mix of color and style not only enhances the visual appeal of this area but can also reflect your personality and aesthetic preferences. Whether you enjoy a modern, sleek look or a warm, rustic vibe, the way you choose colors and styles can have a significant impact on your coffee station‚Äôs overall atmosphere.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/kitchen-home-decor-coffee  
  
### Understanding the Role of Color

Color plays a crucial role in interior design, influencing mood and behavior. When it comes to a coffee station, the right color can create a sense of comfort and warmth. Here are some popular color choices and their effects:

- **Warm Neutrals:** Shades like beige, cream, and taupe promote warmth and coziness. These colors often work well in traditional settings, making your coffee station feel inviting and homey.
- **Bold Colors:** If you prefer a modern twist, consider vibrant tones like navy blue, forest green, or even mustard yellow. These colors can energize the space and make a bold statement.
- **Soft Pastels:** Light pink, mint green, and baby blue can add a refreshing touch to your coffee corner. These colors provide a serene backdrop, perfect for a calm morning routine.
- **Classic Black and White:** A timeless black and white color scheme can bring sophistication and elegance. It offers a versatile backdrop that pairs well with various decor items.

### Selecting the Right Style

Your coffee station‚Äôs style should resonate with the overall decor of your kitchen. Here are some popular styles to consider:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/kitchen-home-decor-coffee  
  
- **Modern:** Clean lines, minimalism, and sleek finishes define modern aesthetics. Incorporate metallic elements with glass or high-gloss finishes to create a chic coffee station.
- **Rustic:** Embrace wood, stone, and earth tones for a warm and inviting rustic look. Use handcrafted wooden shelves and vintage containers to display your coffee supplies.
- **Farmhouse:** A blend of rustic charm and vintage appeal, a farmhouse-style coffee station features distressed furniture, vintage d√©cor items, and a soft color palette. Consider using open shelving to showcase coffee mugs and jars.
- **Industrial:** A combination of raw materials like metal and wood, industrial style suits modern lofts. Use metal racks, exposed pipes, and concrete surfaces to enhance the design.

### Combining Color and Style

To effectively blend color and style, consider these tips:

1. **Choose a Color Palette:** Begin by selecting a cohesive color palette that matches your chosen style. Stick to three or four colors to avoid a cluttered appearance.
2. **Accent with Decor Items:** Use coffee-related decor items like coffee jars, mugs, or art to accentuate your color scheme. For instance, a pastel mug can pop against a dark wood shelf.
3. **Incorporate Textures:** Different textures can add depth to your coffee station. Consider pairing soft textiles, like a cozy runner or a cushion, with smooth surfaces, like glass or ceramic.
4. **Add Greenery:** Bringing in plants, such as succulents or herbs, can enhance both color and style. Greenery adds life and freshness to your coffee station.

### Creating a Personalized Coffee Station

Personalization adds character to your coffee area, making it feel uniquely yours. Here are some ideas:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/kitchen-home-decor-coffee  
  
- **Custom Labels:** Use chalkboard labels on jars to store coffee beans, sugar, or spices, giving a personal touch.
- **Framed Photos:** Hang a few frames with your favorite coffee moments to capture the joy associated with your coffee routine.
- **Unique Brewing Equipment:** Showcase unique coffee makers or kettles that resonate with your style while highlighting your brewing passion.

Transforming your coffee station into a stylish haven doesn‚Äôt have to be overwhelming. By thoughtfully choosing colors and styles that resonate with you, you can create an inviting space that enhances your daily coffee experience. With a little creativity and personalization, your kitchen can become the ultimate destination for coffee lovers.

### Conclusion

Transforming your kitchen into a coffee lover's paradise goes beyond brewing the perfect cup; it‚Äôs about crafting an inviting space that reflects your passion. Using creative coffee-themed decor can add personality while enhancing your home‚Äôs atmosphere. From wall art featuring coffee quotes to playful coffee mugs displayed on shelves, these elements can turn ordinary spaces into cozy coffee corners that inspire you each morning.

Don‚Äôt underestimate the role of color and style in this decor journey. Choosing hues that resonate with your mood can elevate your coffee station‚Äôs aesthetic appeal. Warm browns and creamy whites invoke the comfort of coffee, while vibrant pops of color can invigorate the space, making it truly unique. A cohesive style‚Äîwhether rustic farmhouse, modern minimalism, or bold contemporary‚Äîensures that your coffee station not only serves its practical purpose but also adds visual charm to your kitchen.

You ever set something up, forget about it, then check back a few months later and realize you made money doing absolutely nothing? That‚Äôs DePIN.

DePIN stands for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks‚Äîfancy way of saying you get paid for sharing stuff you already have. Internet bandwidth, spare computing power, sensor data‚Äîbasically, all the digital scraps your devices waste every single day. Companies need this stuff, and instead of paying AWS or Google, they‚Äôre paying you.

But here‚Äôs the catch (because there‚Äôs always one): most of these projects don‚Äôt pay you in cash yet. They give you points, which later convert into tokens, which could be worth a fortune or‚Ä¶ absolutely nothing. 

The game is getting in early, stacking points, and waiting for the eventual airdrop.

So, I tested **8 legit DePIN projects** myself. Some made me chump change, others made me wonder why I didn‚Äôt start sooner. Here‚Äôs the breakdown.

# 1. GRASS ‚Äì Get Paid for Doing Nothing (Literally)

**üìå Website:** [**getgrass.io**](https://app.getgrass.io/register?referralCode=9GE6XfPu0MGIvQs)

This one‚Äôs stupid easy. Download the app (desktop recommended), let it use your extra internet bandwidth, and earn Grass Points. These turn into $GRASS tokens during their airdrops.

**üí∞ What I earned**: 

801 $GRASS in the last airdrop (\~$2 per token). That‚Äôs $1,600 for literally zero effort.

**‚úÖ How to start:**

* Sign up
* Download the app or Chrome extension
* Connect your Solana wallet (I use Phantom)
* Forget about it

# 2. NAVIGATE ‚Äì Get Paid for Your Digital Footprint (Because They‚Äôre Monetizing It Anyway)

**üìå Website:** [**nvg8.io**](https://dataquest.nvg8.io//signup?ref=1652115)

Instead of letting Facebook and Google sell your data for free, Navigate lets you profit off your own digital footprint. You earn points in two ways:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Completing ‚Äúdata quests‚Äù (surveys, dataset labeling, etc.)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Connecting accounts like Amazon, Spotify, and more

**üí∞ What I earned:** 

No immediate cash, but points will convert to tokens in their airdrop.

**‚úÖ How to start:**

* Sign up
* Install the Navigate extension
* Link your accounts
* Add an Ethereum wallet to track rewards

**Pro tip:** If you‚Äôre already handing your data to Big Tech for free, might as well get paid for it.

# 3. GRADIENT NETWORK ‚Äì Farm Points for an Airdrop That Could Be Huge

**üìå Website:** [**gradient.network**](https://app.gradient.network/signup?code=0BDWGA)

Gradient is working on a cross-chain Layer-2 solution (aka, fixing blockchain‚Äôs biggest bottlenecks). The more points you stack, the bigger your airdrop could be.

**üí∞ What I earned:** 

Who knows? But if it‚Äôs anything like Arbitrum or Optimism, early farmers could cash out big.

**‚úÖ How to start:**

* Download the Gradient extension
* Let it run in the background

# 4. BLOCKMESH ‚Äì Get Paid to Surf the Web

**üìå Website:** [**blockmesh.xyz**](https://app.blockmesh.xyz/register?invite_code=77e927fa-df2d-44a3-9af4-11eeeddc1a3a)

If you don‚Äôt mind sharing some browsing data, BlockMesh pays you for it. Simple as that.

**üí∞ What I earned:**

* Ethernet connection (WiFi sucks for reliability)
* 24/7 uptime (more online time = more rewards)
* This setup turns your mini PC into a passive income powerhouse that runs multiple DePIN projects simultaneously.
* You can easily install other DePIN projects like Filecoin and Theta.

# Final Thoughts: Is This Worth It?

If you‚Äôre expecting instant cash, this ain‚Äôt it. But if you‚Äôre willing to play the long game, stack points, and wait for airdrops, the upside could be massive.

Worst case? You burn a little electricity and get nothing.

Best case? You wake up one day to a fat airdrop worth thousands.

So yeah, I‚Äôm all in.

**Springbank Local Barley 13yo 54.1% bottled Dec 2023**
Loads of cream, orchard fruit and tobacco box initially on the nose. Citrus, tiramisu and shaving cream. Rose petals and an old fire place. Smells like proper Springbank. 

Fireplace, minerality, a painter‚Äôs palette. Toasted malt. It‚Äôs a bit thinner than I hoped on the palate but peaches and apples and a bit of baking spice make it interesting. 

Cream, river rocks, passion fruit vines and almond butter. Some grape fruit zest, coffee grounds and chalkiness.

1igkm15,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeginnerWoodWorking/comments/1igkm15/furniture_made_from_decking_boards_advice_please/,Furniture made from decking boards ? Advice please,"Hello guys,

I¬¥ve playing with an idea recently since hardwood boards in general are pretty expensive for me.

As examples to relate to prices and the reason why I¬¥m thinking about this. Wood species does not really matter. It¬¥s all about using hardwood and being able to not use plywood :

Hardwood board 2000x300x19mm around 200USD

Plywood 2440x1220x12mm AA Grade around 70 USD

Hardwood decking board 2500x140x19mm 16USD

So I found some insanely cheap hardwood decking boards. Visiually I think they look really beautiful. Of course it¬¥s not 1 continous board it¬¥s made from around 3-4 pieces which is why it¬¥s so cheap. But still they look really beautiful... and it¬¥s REAL wood.

My idea was to build a bookcase, coffee table, desk/computer table, bed table and a Dresser/Tallboy to replace my unbeloved MDF Ikea furniture. that would be at least the project for the next months weekends.

With the decking board all I have to do is to plane the sides down to squares (they¬¥re pencil rounded) and then I can already directly join them together as there is the option to buy them either oiled or without any finish (I wanted to use Danish oil and definitely oil them myself). I admit I¬¥ve never joined such long boards together before so I probably either have to build a clamp rig or might buy even a rig since I could keep using decking boards in future as a cheaper alternative for some fun projects. Also they¬¥re also available in different species and at the end it¬¥ll remain much cheaper for me to build from decking boards.

Of course it¬¥s nothing premium, but to me somebody who had only particle board or plywood furniture, having real wood furniture is already premium.

So did anybody ever try before building furniture out of decking boards ?

Did you see something or notice something I might have not seen.. maybe something obvious I turned a blind eye on ?

So my question might be a bit stupid but I wanted to ask this because I thought maybe somebody did it before and can stop me from doing something really stupid. But as far as I see it decking boards are also just hardwood and as long as I buy them unfinished it should be fairly simple to join them to the needed width to build the furniture I want to build.

FYI: I¬¥m just a guy enjoying a hobby. It doesn¬¥t matter to me if it takes 1 week or 1 month or 3 months to finish to build 1 furniture piece. My ikea crap furniture is still fine but just unbeloved. I even use mainly hand tools. So I do not have a powered planer, I¬¥ll do it by hand. But I don¬¥t see a problem as the decking board is 19mm in width so my jack plane could do it as for the width in one go (but probably I¬¥m gonna buy a joint planer (hand tool)).",2,1738571664.0,BeginnerWoodWorking,1,1.0,False
1igkj3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1igkj3k/my_ex_wants_to_be_friends/,My ex wants to be friends,"So she contacted me after 3 months of no contact, saying she regretted how things ended and wanted to stay in touch with me. we've been having coffee to discuss about how we were doing and ran into each other at a couple of events.

Yesterday she seemed to have issues. And I kinda came running. She broke up with the person she was seeing, she wouldn't tell me why. Apparently something really bad happening to her but she didn't give me details. this made her unable to take care of herself and her roommates have been giving her shit. She ranted to me, we cuddled.

I ended up offering a meal at my place. It was fun and emotional bc she put our breakup playlist on. There was some tension at a few moments and I don't know if it was just on my part.
But I was dead set on not making any moves on her.
We watched an episode of a serie with her head on my lap, ran my hands through her hair. I was glad I could bring her some comfort.

She had a mental breakdown, cried a lot, and completely collapsed. it feels like she's been going through a lot.

She was getting sleepy after and I offered her to lay down. When I layed down next to her she unded up saying it was weird and that she should go home. We had a cigarette and she left

I was feeling stupid that I let things escalate like that. She told me it was not a big deal and thanked me for being there, then insisted on going back to just coffee.

What happened? Is my behaviour a problem?

I feel like the problem is deep down I wish we were back together and she doesn't because she thinks it would be a terrible idea.
