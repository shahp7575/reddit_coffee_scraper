This is going to sound a little crazy, but I need some advice anyway. Just want to start by saying that I've never had any problems with paranoia, delusions or psychosis, and I don't believe in ghosts or anything like that. I'm also 35 years old now, so it's unlikely that those type of mental issues would arise at such a late age.

That being said, I feel like I'm going crazy. I'm pretty sure someone moves small things in my apartment when I'm not home. I live alone and no one, as far as I know, has a key to my apartment. I have two keys and both are in my possession (I have checked several times).

I have tried putting glasses and plates on the table as a test before I go to work, and have taken pictures of them to compare with the pictures when I get home. So far I have not been successful in proving anything.

The most obvious things that I have noticed that have moved are a plate I had breakfast on that day moved maybe 30 cm from where I put it, candles have moved from the center of the coffee table to the edge of the table, and a shampoo bottle has moved from one shelf to another that I never use to store shampoo on. There are several other things I have noticed, but they are very small things that ""maybe/maybe not"" could be me now that I am so aware of where everything is. 

My ex-boyfriend had the key to my apartment for many years before we broke up two years ago. We didn't fall out, and he has a new girlfriend now, so I'm 99% sure it's not him. He also works in Copenhagen now several days a week, while I live in Jutland. I have asked him on days when things have moved, where he was, and he has been in Copenhagen all those days. He shared his location on Messenger, so that was enough.

What would you do? I have no evidence of anything and in principle I could have been sleepwalking or something and just not noticed the changes until I got back home from work. I occasionally sleepwalked as a child, but as far as I know it hasn't happened in maybe 25 years. It's starting to get pretty creepy…

> There is a well-known Reddit thread that sounds very similar to what you describe - It turned out that the person had severe carbon monoxide poisoning that created paranoia and delusions. I would strongly advise you to see if you can find somewhere else to sleep for the next few nights and then buy a detector - They are available at Bauhaus and the like.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/DKbrevkasse/s/H2icDbizfd)  **Jan 22, 2025**

[UPDATE] Hi again everyone :) A lot has happened since I wrote the post. I've figured out what's up with the “situation”. I bought two cameras, and set one up in the living room/kitchen and one in the entrance hall.

It turns out my apartment actually has three keys and not two, as I thought. My neighbour (also 35 years old) apparently looked after the previous tenants' cat occasionally, and had a key to their apartment. She didn't return it after they moved out of what is now my apartment.

We were pretty good friends to start with, when I moved in, but she became more and more “clingy”, to the extent that she would call up to 15 times a day, and talk for over 4 hours in total per day. I couldn't even leave the apartment without her wanting to know where I was going, and she would get angry if I didn't respond immediately to her messages, if I was asleep or busy. There was so much drama surrounding her, that I couldn't take it anymore, and chose to completely cut off contact. She has respected that for the most part, I thought.

It turns out that she has let herself into my apartment and gone through my cupboards and drawers, and apparently deliberately moved my things around to make me paranoid. She can hear when I go in and out of my apartment, because her entrance is only 5 meters from mine - that's why she always knew when I wasn't home, even though I work shifting hours.

I confronted her, and said that I would call the police. She panicked and contacted her father, who came over to me. He is a doctor and said that she has borderline personality disorder, and refuses treatment because she doesn't think she's wrong. He said she is impulsive, outwardly reacting and often feels a strong urge to “revenge” herself on people who she feels have treated her unfairly or let her down. This has apparently been a theme throughout her life with almost all her relationships; romantic and friendships.

He practically begged me not to call the police, and said that he would do everything he can to prevent anything similar from happening again. I got him to pay for a locksmith to change the lock, and I said that I would report her to the housing association (who would then report her to the police), if she didn't voluntarily move out of the apartment as soon as possible, because I don't want her as a neighbour anymore. They both accepted that, and she has now chosen to move back to her parents at the end of February.

So the ending was relatively good for me, albeit very chaotic.

I have had a Baratza Encore ESP for a couple of years and have really enjoyed it. I have replaced some parts that I expected to but overall enjoyed using it for espresso. Recently I have been measuring the grinders retention as my shots have become less consistent. I found that a lot of coffee is getting retained in the grinder after the burrs and before exiting. It appears like the chute exit is being blocked with grounds that are packing it. Then coffee can’t get out. I have been grinding at about a 9 on the adjustment and don’t remember having issues in the past. I clean it regularly and check the burrs and have replace the burr carrier and other small parts. I also spray a little water on the beans before grinding and does my grinds. I’m ok with clumping as I can stir those out but mostly concerned with the grinder retention. If I put in 18g of coffee I get about 14g out. Looking for any tips or tricks you have found to help this.",1,1767038914.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1pywnpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/OPSaidpod/comments/1pywnpi/was_i_in_the_wrong_for_not_trying_to_salvage_my/,Was I in the wrong for not trying to salvage my friendship?,"Hello ladies, hope you're doing great! I've been loving your podcast and it gave me courage to finally address and ask for advice on something that happened to me and someone I considered my best friend. 

For some context, I met her in high school, back when she was going through a lot of family stress and I like to think I helped her a lot with that and stayed by her side when her ""best friend"" abandoned her and insulted her over how she was handling the situation at the time (she went to parties a lot and drank a lot). She also said that my friend was a bad friend, but I didn't think she was in the right to say that, since she was the one walking away from a struggling friend. I didn't blame her for all that stuff, because I thought she was struggling and hurting and everyone deals with stress in their own ways, but I also couldn't see her slowly destroy herself so I helped in the best way I knew how at the time, and encouraged her to finally talk everything out with a professional, which she didn't want to for a long time. When she finally got the help she needed, she was slowly getting better and we grew closer and I was genuinely happy for how far she'd come.

Fast forward when we both went to university, I went to one that's like a military university and I can only go home on the weekends, and it can be very tiring and a lot of times when I get home, I don't have the energy to go out with anyone and I usually sleep for long hours so I also don't text a lot. In that, I might've been in the wrong, because I couldn't nurture our friendship in the best way, but I felt as if it was justified giving the circumstances. In the meantime, she went to a ""normal"" university and started going out again a lot to parties, and meeting a lot of new people. When we did get together to drink coffee and such, she usually talked the entire time about herself, and parties, and boys, and if I wanted to talk about my stuff too, I had to do so without her asking anything, because she never asked for how I was doing and what was new. I didn't mind that for a long time because that was just how she was, and I didn't mind listening to her life stories, because she was my best friend. 

However, when I got with my boyfriend, I felt like it all changed... She never asked about him and how I was doing in my relationship, I had to tell her unpromptly, otherwise we wouldn't address it at all. For a little while we didn't talk about him at all, because she was going through some boy drama everytime I saw her, and I didn't want her to feel sad with me being all in love and all, if that makes sense. But with time I started paying more attention on how everything was about herself, and how she always talked about boy drama, and I felt like I was being just an unpaid therapist most of the time and she didn't really care about me. 

Then, the breaking point was when she only wished me happy birthday two weeks after my actual birthday. For context, I did invite her to have lunch together and go out, and she said she couldn't go and left it at that, and fast forward to the actual day, she didn't text me at all and only did so two weeks after that, claiming that she was camping at a concert on the day and slept through the entire following day. I was angry because for me, it's the bare minimum to text your best friend on their birthday, but instead she came up with excuses and decided to wait 14 days to say something. I told her I was upset but thanked her for the good wishes. I also told her I didn't forgive her just yet and we had to talk face to face to make amends and that she had to made the effort to schedule it (since she was the one who was in wrong), to which she agreed and said she also had stuff that she was holding back from saying, which I didn't understand because I always felt like she would tell me if she was unhappy with anything regarding our friendship so we solve any issues, and she never indicated that something was wrong.

Fast forward a month later, we didn't talk at all and didn't meet up (because I wasn't going to chase after her when she was the one who hurt me, and I had made that clear to her) and out of nowhere she invited me to her birthday party, along with 40 people I didn't know, to which I said I wouldn't go. She then texted me offended asking why I wasn't going to her birthday party, and I told her we weren't on good terms at the moment and I wasn't going to pretend we were, and that I was hurt She hadn't reached out. She then said I was in the wrong and she had already apologized and she didn't know what else I wanted from her. I told her that she had made excuses and if she really wanted to apologize, she would've done the effort to meet up, which she hadn't, to which she said I was the one that had to arrange that, because she took the first step in apologizing. She also said I never want to go out with her anymore and I always spend time with my boyfriend and not her, which I don't agree with, because for the longest time I was the one always scheduling our meet ups and she always came up with excuses not to go (for example, we were supposed to meet up but she claimed her friend's mom was in the hospital and was going to pay her a visit, only for her to post a story on Instagram of herself and said friend at a party, later that night). She claimed I was ruining her mood for her birthday and I told her I was open to solve things any other day if she was to make the effort to schedule for us to meet, and she never did and we haven't spoken in a year.

I'm so sorry for the long story but I wanted to ask if there was anything I could've done differently to salvage our friendship or if I was in the wrong at any time? I still think about her from time to time and wonder if this is how it was always meant to be.

I’m in Italy and currently stressed out on 2 decaf espressos. Im extremely sensitive and when you go to a café here they tend to serve even the decaf strong. I knew this already but just wanted the buzz, ngl. I got it but now I regret it, as always. I’m irritable af especially with my little kids. that’s not who I want to be.

I’ve been trying to imagine never having any caffeine, not even decaf or green tea. Decaf and green tea cause me plenty of trouble anyway.

Damn, it’s hard to even visualise having no caffeinated drinks at all again ever. but to live my best life thats what I need to do. Screw this anxiety, it’s horrible.

im also trying to imagine not fapping to porn anymore. Also very hard to do. Both are an intense source of pleasure for me (with horrendous downsides).

I started reading ‘Tweak’ a book about a meth addict. Meth is a level up from coffee, obviously, but it’s the same principle: he can’t give up what he knows is very bad for him.

The book talks about the 12-step program: Being powerless in the face of your addiction (that’s me) and believing that a power greater than yourself can restore you to sanity.

I think I need to apply the 12 steps to caffeine….I think I need the spiritual element. Nothing else is working for me.

The results showed a small hiatal hernia, Schatzki ring, gastric polyps, and Gastritis. Biopsies were taken to test H. Pylori. 

I do not regularly take any NSAIDs. I do drink to extents that vary. I only drink beer, and a typical week consists of 2-3 nights during the week coming home and having 2-4 beers, other nights no beer, and maybe a bit more on the weekend (5-7 beers) one weekend night, but not every weekend. And my most recent blood panels (one two weeks ago and one last year) produced perfectly normal numbers across all categories including liver-related ones. 

After my first flare up of...whatever this was (unkown to me at the time)...1.5 months ago, I stopped drinking beer, coffee, and eating anything with chocolate. If I don't have H. Pylori, alcohol seems to be the only common cause left. 

With that said, when reading common symptoms of gastritis, I realized I have virtually none of them aside from the occasional nausea episodes. There's no abdominal discomfort, indigestion, bloating, fullness, etc. I do not have a loss of appetite. I have had some vomiting over the last 1.5 months, but my vomiting is usually a clear or slightly yellow-green liquid. My primary  symptom over the past 1.5 months have been globus in my throat, which leads to rough nights when it appears -- usually later in the evening even if I eat an early dinner and remain upright for 2-4 hours afterwards. I am going to follow-up with an ENT doctor to see if it can be something else, but I am confused as to why I'm displaying virtually no classic gastritis symptoms, yet it came back as positive for gastritis after my EGD?

While this will be the Wizards’ third game in 4 nights, they’ve managed to win each of their last 2 home outings, and Phoenix’s last two trips to Washington cashed the Over in spades. My money’s on a high-scoring affair here, friends.

1pywjdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1pywjdr/aita_for_getting_on_a_bus/,AITA for getting on a bus,"Hi all, I'll try to make the events as objective as I can be for the sake of balance, happy to answer questions etc. Up front, I thought this was a harmless miscommunication which was no big deal.

Yesterday my wife and I were going to a friend's party/gathering. Prior to the party, although we were running a bit late (maybe 30 mins late if we caught the next bus) we both decided our caffeine addictions needed to be sated and to grab a cup of coffee beforehand. My wife had begun navigating on google maps for which bus to catch and when. We had around 15 minutes until the next bus. Since we wanted coffees from different places, we amiably agreed to split up and then meet back up to catch the number X bus together (from a specific bus stop). I didn't hear the bit about the bust stop so I hold my hands up at that, my bad - I was probably thinking about my coffee! Nevertheless, I went to the coffee shop and my wife said she was going to get one from a machine at the supermarket. Mine was from a chain so I knew it would be pretty quick and I'd be able to catch the next bus. Since hers was going to be from a machine at the supermarket, I assumed would be pretty quick too.

I got my cup of coffee, then realised I didn't know which bus stop/where to meet so text my wife a screenshot of googlemaps (with the stop I was planning to be at to catch bus X) and said ""Ok""? Here's the texts verbatim after that:

- Her: I am at the stop outside 'Shop'. One stop before you.
- Me: Ok tell me where you sit.
- Her: I am at the Starbucks.
- Me: Oh you're not on the bus???

I then tried to call her as the bus was pulling up, but she didn't answer. Thinking she was already at the bus stop (as she said) I thought 'ok, she has got on the bus', and by ""I am at Starbucks"" she probably means the bus is passing Starbucks now. English isn't her first language and I thought this was simply a slightly odd way to say that. In my head, I thought it would make no sense to go to the bus stop first and then go to the Starbucks for coffee, surely - especially as we were already running late! Clearly I wasn't certain either way, but since she didn't answer my call, I had to make a decision, and I got on the bus - only to find she wasn't there.

In reality, her text ""I am at the stop outside 'Shop'"" actually meant ""I am planning to go to the stop outside 'Shop'"" (after getting her coffee from Starbucks - a different place than she initially stated). She said it's like when she texts her friends that she's on the way, when she is actually just putting her shoes on - ""I'm practically on the way"".

Anyway, today she told me this was entirely my fault. Her justification is:

- She said that she never said we were going to catch the *next* bus and she was perfectly fine being even more late to the party (of only 5 people including us, btw). Which I also find mind-blowing. She said it was more important for us to get the same bus and travel together than it was to arrive earlier.
- I failed to hear her initial plan of meeting at the specific bus stop outside the Shop, so I didn't stick to the plan.

I felt a bit guilty about catching the bus when she missed it, as well as me being late and her being even more late, but my wife seemed fine during the part and the hosts were very nice and didn't seem to mind at all either. A good time was seemingly had by all. I thought it was all done and dusted, and had put it out of my mind until she started to blame me for it entirely today, and now I just feel this is completely unjustified. My take is that I made one mistake (mishearing her and consequently going to the wrong bus stop) which was ultimately easily recoverable (hence my text ""tell me where you sit""), while she made several (incorrect/misleading text, not picking up my phone call, and most of all - missing the bus!) which were not possible to recover from (in terms of getting the earliest next bus).

1pywj03,https://i.redd.it/ctvcl43y27ag1.jpeg,Cafés da DCAE (Do Coado ao Espresso): Duas experiências opostas,"Fala, galera. Postando aqui pela primeira vez para compartilhar minha experiência com os cafés da **Do Coado ao Espresso** que adquiri na última compra coletiva da DDUCL e também saber da experiência de outras pessoas.

Escolhi o **Café do Cleber e Fabiana**, o **Joia do Planalto** e o **Campeão do Ivan**, que no portfólio aparentavam estar na linha de cafés que eu curto. Normalmente frutados, florais ou fermentados. O Joia do Planalto veio com sensoriais errados na etiqueta da embalagem, mas no portfólio dizia ser floral, tangerina, groselha, frutas vermelhas, acidez cítrica, corpo liso e finalização doce e longa. Aguardei 15 a 20 dias após o recebimento para abrir e testar, fiz todos na V60 múltiplas vezes usando uma receita padrão que normalmente utilizo e, por vezes, fazendo leves alterações (vou deixar no final do post).

O **Campeão do Ivan** é um dos meus favoritos do ano, sinceramente. Tem tudo o que eu gosto num café, do aroma ao sabor. Não sou muito bom em descrever notas e sensoriais, mas ele entregou algo muito próximo do que a embalagem se propôs a entregar. Definitivamente frutado, ácido e com finalização longa. Me lembrou de certa forma o Frutadinho da Astral, outro que tenho aqui e gosto muito, também fermentado. Não consegui errar o Campeão do Ivan uma vez. Inclusive, servi para alguns amigos e familiares, que também ficaram positivamente surpresos com a bomba de sabor, mesmo não entendendo muito de café.

Já o **Joia do Planalto** e o **Café do Cleber e Fabiana** me causaram muita estranheza ao abrir os pacotes: os grãos de ambos pareciam ter um mesmo cheiro peculiar que eu ainda não tinha sentido, nem no Campeão do Ivan, nem em outros cafés que tenho aqui (alguns da Astral e da Baristrô, torrefação local). Na minha opinião leiga, não parece ser algo normal de café. Esse aroma se repete ao fazer esses cafés e respinga no sabor, que não me agradou de forma alguma. Não se encaixa nos sensoriais descritos nas embalagens e também escondeu qualquer outro possível sensorial.

Ontem fiz mais uma vez o Joia do Planalto na V60 para testar, alterando alguns parâmetros da extração, e confesso que dessa vez tive até dificuldade de terminar a xícara, o que não é muito normal pra mim. Normalmente termino qualquer café, mesmo que ele não se encaixe no meu gosto. O sabor estava bastante desagradável. Não sou bom em descrever, mas diria que algo puxando para ervas (não de um jeito que me agrada), não tinha nada doce e também não estava amargo ou muito ácido. Eu diria até que quase salgado, mas talvez seja exagero. Não senti nada que se aproximasse dos sensoriais da embalagem/portfólio mais uma vez, apesar do sabor muito forte e idêntico ao cheiro do café no pacote, antes de moer.

Para dar um veredito final, ainda vou fazer eles numa receita de cold brew que o u/Alternative_Pitch_15 sugeriu e também fazendo um Soup no OXO Rapid Brewer, mas confesso que, até aqui, acho que esses dois cafés vieram defeituosos, de alguma forma.

Alguém mais já teve alguma experiência semelhante com a DCAE ou com cafés em geral?

- Toiletries: none until all of that product category is used up. I will prioritize using up full sizes over travel sizes in order to postpone buying in my next category.

- travel size toiletries: I am allowed to buy new travel sizes when my option in that category is at risk of running out during planned ""travel"" - note: I am a competitive dancer, so I won't be playing games potentially running out of product mid competition day.

- cleaning products: no buy until I have run out of that product category.

- writing utensils and stationary: can only buy ultra fine point basic non frills ball point pens. Anything else, I must use up what I have before replacements can be purchased. 

- jewelry: can only buy myself one fine jewelry piece on my special anniversary. Will most likely be 14k gold with garnet stud earrings to match a necklace and ring I already have 

- home goods: I am allowed to purchase an anti fatigue kitchen mat when I finally find one I like. I am also allowed to purchase one plate stand for a piece of art I acquired a year ago. Lastly, I am allowed to purchase one set of small coffee cups when I find the ones that will look good in our coffee corner. All other purchases are off limits for the year.

- clothing: I am only allowed to purchase a piece of clothing if I have run out of that category of clothing more than once before laundry day, to the point where I go digging around to do an early load for the purpose of having more of that type of clothing.

I have $40/mo to spend on whiskey. What should I buy?

  
I have $70/mo to spend on whiskey. What bottles do I need to have in my cabinet to enjoy and sip on, and what do I need to have to drink?

  
I have $120/mo to spend on whiskey. What bottles should I invest in to have in my cabinet to drink, sip, and enjoy as well as any potential unicorns to add to it to impress others.

  
Finally, while money is still an issue, what bottles should I have on hand. Are there some unicorns that you're looking to get or that I should be on the lookout for? What is overhyped and overpriced?

That was the first text message I got that morning.

It came from an unknown number. No name. No emoji. No follow-up. Just those five words, all caps, like the sender was afraid of being overheard even through a phone.

For a few seconds, I sat up in bed, staring at the screen while my alarm continued to chirp beside me. The early light filtering through my blinds gave my room its usual harmless look: laundry on the chair, posters peeling at the corners, my backpack slumped against the wall. Everything normal. Everything safe.

I checked the time. 6:14 a.m.

I laughed—one sharp breath through my nose. A prank. Spam. Someone messing with me. My friends thought it was funny to send creepy stuff sometimes, especially before exams.

Still, my thumb hovered over the keyboard longer than it should have.

*Who is this?* I typed.

The message showed as delivered. No response.

I tossed the phone onto my bed and stood up, stretching. I had school. A math test. A bus to catch. The real world didn’t pause for anonymous texts.

As I brushed my teeth, I kept glancing at my reflection, half-expecting to see something different. Someone standing behind me. A shadow that didn’t belong to me.

Nothing.

By the time I was dressed, the message had faded into the background noise of my mind—unsettling, but distant. I grabbed my phone again as I headed downstairs.

Another message had come in.

**They know you saw the first one.**

My stomach dropped so suddenly it felt like I’d missed a step on the stairs.

“Mom?” I called, my voice cracking in a way I didn’t like.

“In the kitchen,” she answered, cheerful, unaware.

I stood frozen halfway down the stairs, staring at the screen. My phone buzzed again.

**You have three minutes.**

“Three minutes for what?” I whispered.

I typed again, hands shaking now. *Who are they?*

The response came instantly.

**Not who. What.**

A chill crept up my arms. I suddenly became aware of every sound in the house: the hum of the refrigerator, the tick of the clock, my mom humming softly to herself.

I went into the kitchen, trying to act normal. My mom slid a plate of toast toward me.

“You look pale,” she said. “Did you sleep?”

“Yeah,” I lied.

My phone buzzed on the counter.

**Two minutes.**

I swallowed hard. “Mom… did you get any weird messages this morning?”

She frowned. “No. Why?”

Another buzz.

**They’re closer than you think.**

My chest tightened. “I—I think someone’s messing with me.”

My mom sighed, already reaching for her coffee. “Sweetheart, if it’s a prank, ignore it. You’ll miss your bus.”

The phone vibrated again.

**One minute.**

I felt lightheaded. “Mom, I think we should—”

The lights flickered.

Just once. Quick. Like a blink.

My mom looked up. “Probably the storm last night.”

The phone buzzed again.

**Thirty seconds. Closet. Bathroom. Anywhere without windows. Do NOT be seen.**

My heart slammed against my ribs. This was too specific. Too urgent.

I grabbed my phone and backed away from the counter. “Mom, please, we need to go somewhere else in the house.”

She stared at me, confused now. “What’s going on?”

The lights flickered again—longer this time.

My phone buzzed.

**They’re here.**

A sound came from outside.

Not a knock.

Not footsteps.

A low, dragging scrape, like something heavy being pulled across concrete.

My mom turned toward the front door. “Did someone—”

“Don’t open it,” I said, louder than I meant to.

She froze. “What?”

The scrape came again. Closer. Accompanied by something else now—a faint clicking, irregular, like nails tapping out of sync.

My phone buzzed nonstop, messages stacking faster than I could read.

**DO NOT LET THEM SEE YOU**

**THEY MIMIC**

**HIDE NOW**

The doorbell rang.

It wasn’t the cheerful chime we’d always had. It was distorted, buzzing too long, like someone was leaning on it.

“Mom,” I whispered, tears burning my eyes. “Please.”

She took a step back from the door.

The doorbell stopped.

Silence.

Then a voice came from the other side.

“Hello?” it called.

It sounded exactly like my mom.

She gasped. I felt something inside me snap, a cold understanding settling in.

The voice spoke again. “It’s me. I forgot my keys.”

My mom covered her mouth with her hand.

The phone buzzed once more.

**That is not her.**

The handle on the door slowly began to turn.

I grabbed my mom’s wrist and pulled her toward the hallway. We ran, slipping on the tile, my heart pounding so loud I was sure *it* could hear us.

Behind us, the front door creaked open.

Footsteps entered the house.

Slow. Careful.

Learning.

We dove into the bathroom and slammed the door, locking it just as something brushed against the hallway wall. I dragged my mom into the bathtub and yanked the shower curtain closed, then turned off the lights.

We huddled there in the dark, barely breathing.

The footsteps moved closer.

The bathroom door handle jiggled.

Then a voice—my voice—spoke softly from just outside.

“I know you’re scared. It’s okay. You can come out now.”

My mom clutched my arm so hard it hurt.

The handle stopped moving.

Silence stretched, heavy and unbearable.

Minutes passed. Or hours. I couldn’t tell.

My phone buzzed faintly in my hand.

**Good. Stay still. They lose interest if they can’t confirm you.**

I typed with trembling fingers. *What are they?*

The response came slower this time.

**We don’t know. They appear, they copy, they replace. We only know how to survive them.**

Another message followed.

**You weren’t the first one we warned.**

A sudden crash came from the living room—the sound of something being knocked over, followed by that same dragging scrape.

Then footsteps moved toward the back door.

The house fell quiet again.

We stayed hidden until the sun was fully up, until my phone battery dipped into the red, until the fear dulled enough for exhaustion to take over.

Eventually, we heard sirens outside. Neighbors gathering. Someone shouting about a break-in.

The police said there was no sign of forced entry.

They said nothing was missing.

They said maybe someone had just walked into the wrong house.

That night, after everything settled, after my mom finally fell asleep on the couch beside me, I plugged in my phone and scrolled back through the messages.

The number was gone.

Not deleted.

Gone.

No sender. No record. Like it had never existed.

Except for one final message, timestamped hours after the others.

**We’ll text again if you survive tomorrow.**

I locked my phone and stared at the dark window across the room.

Outside, someone was standing on the sidewalk.

Watching the house.

Smiling with my face.

**Original Movie/Show Title:** Elysium  
**Original Running Time:** 109 minutes  
**Fanedit Running Time:** 80 minutes



**Synopsis:**  
The main goals here are to strip out the government in-fighting subplot aspects of this future version of our world, and many of the other distracting elements mentioned in the unfavorable reviews. Hopefully this will allow a simply ""corporate overlords vs the disadvanaged"" overarching theme to shine through. I felt the slim and simple plot meant the story needed to be told much quicker, so we've gone from 109min down to 79min for this edit. Short little sci-fi tale. 

Secretary Delacourt's role is changed to simple the lead defender of the space station for the ultra wealthy. Her tactics and use of Kruger are questioned by no one. Criticism of her portrayal highlight her accent, so her dialogue has been extremely reduced. Kruger's arc is simplified as well as he is no longer fired, he is just a violent psychopath. John Carlyle is now simple ""one of the rich"", seen as simple uncaring and an easy target. Frey is no longer a love interest of Max - she is simply someone from his past he sees again. But he has no promises to keep with her.

**Intention:**  
Originally just another ""Evil guys in the sky"" movie that won’t win many points for originality or logic. But, its still such a damn cool looking movie a decade later. The basic theme of wealthy being too far disconnected from real empathy for their fellow humans arguably has more resonance post-Covid as a somewhat accurate metaphor for the divide between the so-called ""Third World"" and the so-called ""West."" And honestly, people living in jury-rigged shacks right outside the walls wealthy gated communities - that's what an economy with little to no middle-class actually looks like, a few ultra-rich and a metric shit-ton of near subsistence poor. Think feudal lords and their peasants. Something like that is basically the bulk of human economic history. That's reality in most of the world, and the exact conditions that make a luxurious life in ""the West"" even possible. Suddenly, Elysium seems a bit less heavy-handed about portraying a reality that already exists (worse than in the movie) in a sci-fi setting. Even complaints about the Med Pods scarcity seem less effective after Covid - we saw how the underprivileged were treated in regards to vaccines in third-world countries.



**Changes:**

* The intro of Earth in decay has new text removing the overpopulation and diseased aspects of Earth, and highlight the growing divide between the rich and poor. 
* Shots of Earth moving to shots of Elysuim is trimmed before shots of Max's childhood. Instead, we cut to the Elysium dinner party with the kids getting cupcakes, and the shot of the sunbather getting into the medpod. (Shot inserted here from the trailer of the medbay detecting trace amounts of skin cancer). This transitions with the Nun and Max on the playground swings looking up at Elysium and talking about how Elyisum is not for them.
* Max's interaction with the locals and the street kids are removed. The initial scene of the bag search keeps most of his dialogue, but reorders the robot lines to be better paced and have Max's joke about the hair products feel quicker and wittier. Tightened the slowmo shot of them breaking his arm.
* At the hospital, Max no longer asks Frey out for coffee. Rather, its just two old acquaintances running into each other. We keep just enough of their interaction so there would be still a reason that Frey takes Max into her home later.
* I moved a later bus ride shot to the space in between the hospital and the parole offices to give more of the ""long, slow process of simply doing what is required to not get into trouble"", and trimmed down the parole officer session quite a lot, to just enough to realize Max is hopelessly trapped.
* When Max gets to work, dialogue is trimmed down to only that his boss docking him a half day of pay, and his interactions with coworkers are also removed. Carlylye's internal office dialogue with investors is removed, he is simply a boss looking down on the factory from above.
* The Elysium entry attempt by the non-citizens sequence is tightened. Most of Delacort's dialogue is removed when possible, keeping her giving only a few commands and cutting some of her weird accents that are happening. Kruger's activation is now simply a part of completely normal process. (Shots immigrant shuttle pilots and their goofy glasses were removed as well, they just seemed distracting to the rest of the intensity.)
* First scene of Julio, talking to Max when he is coming home about what a legend he was, is removed. Julio is now simply a local that knows Max, a low level criminal himself probably. 
* In the factory, Max is not threatened by his boss to be fired if he does not go into the chamber, he simply tries to fix the error himself.  Carlyle's and his boss's dialogue outside the medical room are muted from Max's POV, so Carlylye just seems insensitive. 
* Scenes of Delacort being reprimanded are removed, as is Kruger getting fired (Used later as his next activation when Carlyle is attacked). The intent is that both these two work ""within the system."" 
* Frey's daughter is not staying at the hospital, so those scenes are removed.
* Max and Julio do not have the scene in Max's house about Julio's reservations about Spider. Instead, they go immediately to Spider. Max does not ask for his team or that the mark be Carlyle. Max getting the surgry tightened to remove Julio being worried.
* Scene of Delacort and Carlyle planning in secret removed. 
* Carlyle's data upload tightened, rushing his approving of the ""Lethal"" data into his head to seem standard practice. Now without Delacourt's subplot, it just seems like he is storing the EOD personal data of a very important person.
* Max and Team setting up for the heist tightened to cut excess exposition.
* Kruger's bbq scene added here as his next activation by Elysium. Delacourt's involvement now just seems like worry for an Elysium citizen.
* During the heist, removed: the quick but terrible ""Video game 3rd person camera"" shot, Max's gun doesn't jam, the data is not scrambled, and Sandro doesn't freak out and bail. Kruger's team just gets there and things go to shit. 
* Frey helping injured Max scenes tightened- we lose Frey realizing Max from childhood tattoo, and we lose Frey's daughter telling Max a story.
* Max returning to and confronting Spider tightened.
* On the Raptor, we lose Kruger's discussion about a ""Wifey"".
* Tightened Max, Delacort and Doctors scene so the data simes minimally important but Max hears that the data removal will kill him.
* Tightened Delacort confronting Kruger. Removed Kruger wanting Elysium to be his now, he is just insanely vengeful after the facial reconstruction.
* Moved Spider landing on Elysium to AFTER the ""politicians"" are killed and there is no one to catch them.
* Trimmed out that one ""video game camera shot"" in the final Max/Kruger fight.
* Just before Max uploads, he looks at the locket and we get the later reminder from the nun to never forget where he comes from. 
* Re-edited ending so the computer program simply reboots, (removed brand name that matched Max's factory name), and the system says ""New Citizens >>> All"". 
* Movie ends with distant shot of crowds entering the medbay ships. (Frey with locket removed.)

1pyw5pd,https://i.redd.it/y3y4xfhf67ag1.jpeg,ChatGPT has a 2025 Recap - How I used Al to help me in my Orthodox faith (please read below first before downvoting me into oblivion),"I was fully on the bandwagon of calling Al bad, ranting, railing against it. Meanwhile, I quietly downloaded ChatGPT this year.

It began with simple questions like: Why is Saint Savva the Goth of Wallachia called that if ""Wallachia"" didn't even exist in the 4th century? The kind of question that doesn't require bothering your priest, but still nags at you. From there, I started asking more historical questions about saints, things not covered in the Prologue from Ohrid, or requesting reference books to better understand certain topics. One of those recommendations was Journey to Reality by Zachary Porcu which turned out to be the best book I read in 2025.

I do believe many (maybe most) questions are best answered by a priest, but I've come to realize that Al, when used as a tool, can be genuinely helpful and not demonic in the modern world.",4,1767037741.0,ChristianOrthodoxy,4,0.75,False

I've been doing a lot of reading about weight loss plateaus, and a recurring theme is the idea of a ""slow metabolism."" It seems to be a huge point of frustration for many.

I'm trying to gather real-world experiences. Has anyone here felt they had a slow metabolism and successfully managed to ""speed it up"" or make it more efficient?

I'm not looking for magic pills, but real strategies, habit changes, or specific nutritional approaches that worked for you. For example, did you focus on certain foods, meal timing, or specific types of exercise?

I recently read an interesting story about a woman who tackled this by changing her coffee routine, which sounded fascinating. It made me wonder what other methods people are using.

1pyw3k0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1pyw3k0/my_24f_boyfriend_25m_gave_me_an_ultimatum_and_i/,My (24F) Boyfriend (25M) gave me an ultimatum and I don’t think it’s fair,"To start things out, I’ll give some background history. Me (24F) and my bf (25M) have been dating for a little over 2 years, and have almost been living together for 2 years now. The entirety of our relationship I have supported the both of us, while he has been jobless. I have had no problem with it as I make around 60k per month and can afford it, but I’m starting to resent things. At the start of our relationship he was working, but once we decided to move out together he quit his job. There has been no effort to find a job, as he has a legal injury case going on and has been expecting a settlement for months. The original agreement before we moved in with each other was that if I support us both he’d either go to school in a field he could eventually get a longterm career in, or wait to do that but do the majority of the household chores as he is home all day to do so. None of those have really been put into action. While he does occasionally clean, our apartment is a disaster. It is so disgusting that I’m literally on the verge of breaking down every day due to it, and have been sleeping on our couch due to how horrible our bedroom is. Not only that, but living in a messy space with barely any help for cleaning and cooking hasn’t helped with my mental health status (I’m diagnosed with BPD and clinical depression). Any time i bring up hiring a cleaner I essentially get berated because I should just “ask him to clean”, but I shouldn’t have to ask. Nor should I have to put up with the lowest standard of cleaning and weaponized incompetence because he has no clue how to properly clean things.

On top of a myriad of relationships issues and the constant fighting, I fear he’s become extremely manipulative and borderline emotionally abusive. He consistently tells me that my feelings are wrong, and that I’m the reason he’s depressed. I “never help out” despite funding our entire lives for the majority of our relationship, and doing his job of the household work when I have the time. 

To get back to the story, my boyfriend and his friends planned to go on a japan trip in february back in july. At first, I wasn’t invited as it was a “boy’s trip” with his longterm friends, but I wasn’t comfortable with that. Maybe that makes me a crazy girlfriend, but him going somewhere I’ve dreamt of going to without me had me very upset. He agreed to let me come after hours of crying and trying to explain how hurtful it was that he’d rather go on a big trip across the world without me, and the only thing that made him budge was the fact that he called his dad (assuming his dad would agree with him that I was out of line for preventing him from going on a trip without me) and his dad told him how stupid and disrespectful that would be to me. As mentioned, my boyfriend has a settlement from a legal case that he’s supposed to be receiving, and he was under the impression that he would receive it back in september. He still hasn’t received it, and his plan was to cover the entirety of the trip costs with his own money. The plan has been to fly to japan in mid February, and clearly we’re running out of time. I have been firm on not wanting to pay for the trip, as it’s not “my” trip. It’s a trip with his “boys” and I am just tagging along. If it was only the two of us and wasn’t a trip that he promised he’d cover the cost of, I’d have no problem paying. I have generally no problem with covering the cost of literally anything, as I am the sole provider. But a large trip that I wasn’t even “allowed” to join in the first place is where I draw the line. 

Last night, we somehow had an argument over how I didn’t help clean before his parents came over. I was getting ready as we were going out to dinner with his family for his father’s birthday later in the day. I worked beforehand so I was very limited on time to get ready. While I was getting ready, my boyfriend was tidying up the living room, and they happened to arrive as soon as i was finished doing my hair. We walked around the city for a bit, and I treated all 4 of his family members to a $300 dinner. I love treating people and being generous so I genuinely had no problem with paying, and to be honest I’m used to being the one paying as everyone assumes I’ll pay. After his family left and we got home, we found out that while we were gone our cat peed on the couch. He tasks me with cleaning it while he watches and laughs at me while laying down on the other side of the couch. He keeps telling me what to do, and I say “are you gonna keep watching and laughing and not gonna help me?” He then throws in my face that I “didn’t help at all today” simply because I didn’t tidy up because I was getting ready. I felt backed in a corner, and was getting increasingly frustrated and felt like I was going crazy. Having someone laugh at you while laying back while you’re cleaning up pee feels like a humiliation ritual. I brought up that “well I just paid for a $300 dinner for your entire family so I do think I helped out” and he quite literally lost it. Started yelling at me saying I “crossed a line” and said “i’m sleeping without you tonight, don’t talk to me. idc if you cry yourself to sleep (he knows this would happen as i’m a huge crier and become emotional very easily) i’m thinking of ending our relationship” and went into our bedroom to sleep. Him threatening to leave me due to us fighting because of things that i apparently do is extremely common, as he knows that my bpd makes me spiral after hearing that due to my fear of abandonment. He admits to using this as a tactic to get me to listen since apparently I don’t listen to what I’ve done wrong unless i’m threatened with abandonment. However, as many fights go, i feel as if I’m not in the wrong. He claims i never take accountability, which is extreme projection. I can name maybe one time where he has taken accountability after a fight, and I am always the one to admit I’m in the wrong even though I know i’m not. Every single issue in our relationship is blamed on me. His depression is blamed on me. 

I sat there bawling for over an hour knowing that I can’t go visit my family for comfort as they live an hour away, and my boyfriend has been trying his hardest to isolate me from my family. He insists my family treats me like shit and that i should distance myself from them and just go to his family instead. I was genuinely terrified of him breaking up with me, so I walked in our bedroom to try and solve things. As soon as I walk in he yells “get out”, and I walk over and try apologizing. He hates when i cry and tells me I need to grow up and get ahold of myself. He says “you said what you said and that crossed a line, you threw it in my face and now you have to deal with the consequences.” He sits there no expression getting increasingly angry due to me bawling my eyes out and just keeps harping on how what I said he can’t forgive me for. I have never once personally insulted him during a fight, I simply bring up his actions. He however, has no problem insulting me. He says I’m crazy and mentally unstable, I’m becoming someone he doesn’t love, I’m a child, I make him depressed, I’m manipulative and narcissistic. But me bringing up that I paid for dinner is somehow this unimaginable thing that should never be said and that it can’t be forgiven.

Atp I’m continuing to spiral and I’m at the point of calling my mom and asking to come over. I’m hysterical due to his callousness and constant insults, and he tells me I need to admit myself to a psych ward the next day or he’s leaving me. All i’m doing at this point is crying and saying I need my mom. He won’t let me call her and makes me give him my phone to prevent me from calling her and getting emotional support i’m not getting from him. 

We start de-escalating things and talking things out, and he essentially gives me an ultimatum to stay in the relationship: 

1. I need to stop buying designer clothes and luxury items, and I need to stop buying pokemon cards. (due to my depression and lack of happiness I tend to buy a lot of things that bring me joy for a quick dopamine rush. I’m aware I have a shopping addiction, but buying these things is not hurting me financially in the slightest. I tend to fill my emptiness with material items, and am aware of this problem and am seeing a therapist for it. My boyfriend has no problem with me buying things for him and his happiness however. I just spent over $4k on a new tv, switch 2, new coffee table, new console table and he has no problem with these purchases.) 

2. I need to immediately solve my eating disorder. (I have had an eating disorder for 2 years now, and am seeing a therapist for help, but it’s not something I can instantly solve due to me having an on and off ed basically my entire life, but i am taking action to get help)

3. I need to “become stable” as apparently I’m extremely unstable mentally.

4. I need to buy our japan tickets this week (he fessed up to planning to propose while we’re in japan, making me feel even more guilty for not wanting to buy tickets)

I’m writing this with sore eyes, hoping for some advice on what to do next or giving me insight on how I can go about changing/improving as a person. Thank u for reading, I’m accepting to all criticism and feedback. 

TL;DR : My boyfriend is giving me an ultimatum to solve various “issues” I have in order to stay with him, but I don’t think they need solving.",6,1767037607.0,relationships,66,0.75,False

ill make this quick, i basicly dont feel remorse, i've done alot of bad things in my life and feel no regret, like i can steal (and have done it) and feel no regret.  
I once saw a bunch of insects and killed them for no reason, i would kill a animal if i didn't know it was stronger than me/could harm me, and i would feel nothing about it, just 2 months ago i found a lezard and i took it and cooked it and though it was funny.  
Another exemple: Just last week my friend has annoyed me and at a point he pushed me, so i hit him hard in the leg and he started screaming and crying, i laughed.  
I also enjoy breaking rules, even the most basics ones once i started making coffee at school just for the sake of it.  
I dont even feel empathy toward myself, for a time i used to hit myself when am angry and i still to today dont regret it.  
I dont feel regret at all, i get angry if i get caught and rethink how i could have avoided it.  
And this is just 1% of the things i've done.  
Before anyone says it, no am not intrested in therapy, am just looking for reddit's opinion i have nothing better to do right now.  
Also, as long as i remember i dont have childhood trauma or remember being bullied.  
Also, i dont manipulate people (i dont manipulate them consciously? but i dont think i manipulate at all) i enjoy talking alot to alot of people but am truly honest only to *some.*  
*Also: Funfact about me, I like reading frederick nietsch :D*

I was super hyped about the Evo, it fit my needs, and I opted for the Evo with the milk steamer canister. Setup was easy, but for me the dialing it in has been a pain. I did my water test, have level 1 water hardness, and installed the filter.

Issue 1- the espresso isn’t hot. I preheat the machine, run hot water through, and have even tried tossing my first shot away. It comes out anywhere between 60-70 C. I have it set to the highest temp setting (3rd bean) and even when preheating the machine and tossing the first shot, even as it comes out, highest temp I’ve achieved is 70C. I know optimal is 90C, so way off from that.

Issue 2- the coffee is weak. This is most likely due to low temp, but just in case, my grind is dialed in, looks and flows like warm honey, decent crema, dark coffee. I use the same beans as I was using in the Phillips (literally same bag) and it is just not bringing the tasting notes I experienced from the Phillips.

Issue 3- seems to waste a lot of water and possibly leaks. The machine will squirt out water when turned on, turned off, and after I brew a my latte. I looked under the machine and there was standing water near where the grounds collect.

Is my machine busted or is this the normal for this? I read before about temp issues, but it seems like being 20-30 degrees cooler than optimal temp isn’t a design flaw but might be a machine flaw? I’m not seeing the value in the machine for $550 usd when I’m not getting a proper coffee.",0,1767037518.0,superautomatic,3,0.33,False
1pyw1pt,https://i.redd.it/52eyih7l57ag1.jpeg,Review: 2025 Michter's 20 Year Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Plus 2024 vs. 2025 side by side),"A good friend recently compared picking a ""Bourbon of the Year"" to voting for NBA MVP in the 1990s. Yes, any particular bourbon (Charles Barkley, Karl Malone) may have a standout year. But in hindsight, it's almost never wrong to pick Michter's 20, which is having a Jordan-esque run. And while both Jordan and M20 took some years away from the game, when they're playing, they're almost always the biggest threat on the court.

On to the review.

\_\_\_

# Stats

**Producer**: Michter's

**Distillery**: Undisclosed, but since Michter's only began production at their Shively distillery in 2015/2016, this is likely contract distilled juice from an undisclosed Kentucky partner. Much has been written[ on this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/1mokpa1/review_929_michters_20_year_old_bourbon_2024/) (a big shoutout to u/Prepreludesh) regarding potential contract distilling and, in the brand's late 90s/early 2000s relaunch, sourcing. At this point, it's confirmed all Michter's products that *do* *not* feature an age statement were originally distilled at their Shively plant.

**Age**: 20 year age statement, but as with all age-stated Michter's products, there's a likelihood older juice is in the blend.

**Proof**: 114.2

**MSRP**: $1,200  
\_\_\_

# Tasting Notes

**Nose**: I always have high hopes for Michter’s 20, but this year’s nose might clear that lofty bar. It’s at once woody, fruity, tannic, and decadent, with prominent threads of black cherry and chocolate lava cake on a first sniff, followed by vanilla bean and sweetened condensed milk. I also smell sweet and funky balsamic vinegar, a note which, among modern bourbons, I find (almost) unique to M20. (I get this particular note more frequently on “dusty” bourbons from decades past, back when lower barrel entry proofs were much more common...among other things.) There’s a “funk” here, and to be clear, it’s far from a mildewy mess. Rather, the bourbon conveys sweet, earthen wood, like old barrels rested for decades at the bottom of a damp Kentucky rickhouse. Next up is a progression of tannic components that help the whiskey exude age: library stacks, tanned leather, and dark brewed tea. And I still pick up the smell of Sno-Caps candy, an admittedly esoteric scent and hill I’m happy to die on.

**Palate**: Waves of fruit kick off the palate, with more tartness and red berries than I recall from last year. Chocolate cherry cordial meets clove oil, followed by mocha and chocolate rugelach for a generally sweet, confectionary midpalate. Discernible flavors don’t stop there; cola syrup, sassafras candy, dried raspberries, and candied lemon peel all find their places. That citrus note is an especially fun segue into pronounced oak, heavily tannic but in this instance not drying. It’s like sipping on a wood-infused caramel café au lait, punctuated with red fruit and spices that never let up.

**Finish**: The finish quickly turns away from coffee/chocolate and leans into root beer float, with residual oak for the long haul. A final hit of caramel-drizzled apple pie wraps things up on a brighter — and once again fantastic — take on the classic M20 profile.

\_\_\_

**Overall**: It’s incredible, and definitely one of my top 5 bourbons of 2025. How does it compare to 2024? I found the nose on 2025 a touch brighter, with greater vibrancy in the realms of both fruit and chocolate. I once wrote that the 2024 M20 “burst” out of the glass; if that’s the case, the 2025 version might as well explode. When I revisited both releases side by side, I found 2024 had a *slightly* better progression on the palate, which culminated in a more memorable mouth feel and bigger components of oak.

**Rating:** 9.8 - Incredible | A memorable favorite | Nearing all time status

My summarized take on comparing 2024 and 2025 (not that anyone is asking):

**Nose**: The edge goes to 2025, which one of the best nosing bourbons I’ve tried in quite some time  
**Palate**: 2024 wins on mouth feel and composition, but 2025 is close behind with greater fruit and more fun curveballs. I could see these being neck and neck as the bottle of 2025 gets exposed to a little more oxygen. Either way, both are stellar.  
**Finish**: Tied

Both bottles provided by Michter's for review.

1pyw0hg,https://www.reddit.com/r/problems/comments/1pyw0hg/i_dont_know_how_to_maintain_a_good_relationship/,I don't know how to maintain a good relationship with my mom," I'm a 20yr old female and my mom is in her late 30s. I'm currently in a full time university student, I only did an internship for like a few months so I still live off her money and in her house.However, I would do some digital art gig and use my own money to buy the stuff I need/want, mostly yarns, fabrics and a few dolls.

Recently these 2 months has been stressed for me (mentally). I feel like my mom is stressed too from her works and also my grandpa debts (it's cleared but her savings are all gone).So she would suddenly be mad on tiny things about me.I was preparing for a car exam and was not ready to take it. I told her about it she was fine up until 2 months ago when she asked me whether I had asked my coach when is the exam. 

I answered no because I wasn't ready and she was mad.She scolded and screamed at me to leave her hosue as she doesn't want to see me anymore (almost got hit by her broom)
Luckily,her husband calmed her down and she told me to call my coach on the spot to ask her when can I take the exam.

Fast forward to last week, I learned from her scoldings.I tried my best to clean the house up, the toilet and the laundries before she comes home from another country (I don't want to mention where but we don't live together). She came home was happy with what I did, so we were on good terms up until yesterday. 

So she and her husband woke up late and texted me to buy lunches for them too. I did but somehow misunderstood her orders (I am an idiot) and I also missed one of her messages buy cold coffee for her.When she opened her lunch she obviously was furious and refused to eat it. I immediately apologize to her and offered to buy it again.She refused my idea and told me finished both of lunches myself as she was not gonna to eat it. She went to living room to do her job on her laptop, I still stood in the same place like a frozen statue (I felt like a frozen chicken).

She then continues to scold me. Complained that I'm always on my phone ( in my defense she doesn't allow me to go out with my friends so all I can do are the chores, sewing clothes for my doll, digital art and scroll on social media)and threatened to throw my new phone she bought me as present from the 7th floor.I tried to apologize again and she shut me up then proceeds to say hurtful things to me (I'm her worst investment, cut off ties with me, useless etc.)

But one of the most hurtful thing she said, was that I don't really cared my grandma died (I did and still am I really loved my grandma).She also said all I ever know is to talk my problems to her, I was framed in an assignment by my own ""friend"" when she was the one who didn't do it so I told my mom to ask for advices (she was talking about this).
She said she had no one to go to when she faced problems in her work and when my grandma died she had to go back to work without time to grieve but I actually had a similar experience too I had to go back to school act like I'm ok around my friends.

During the screaming and scolding sessions , I feel like she was also trauma dumping on me? IDK. I don't blame her, I don't think I even have the right to say this. But yea what can I do to make her more satisfied and stop screaming at me as I'm kinda mentally stress rn and have nightmares almost every night now.",1,1767037420.0,problems,0,1.0,False

1pyvvlm,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1pyvvlm/you_want_success_but_cant_focus_for_10_minutes/,You want success but can't focus for 10 minutes – here’s how to fix that,"Everyone around me seems to be stuck in the same loop. Open a tab to work, then suddenly 45 minutes deep into a YouTube rabbit hole. Or scrolling TikToks on “how to improve focus” while actively *not focusing*. It’s like we all *want* to be productive, but attention spans are cooked. If you can’t sit still for 10 quiet minutes, how are you supposed to build anything meaningful?

This post is for anyone who’s sick of feeling scatterbrained but keeps getting distracted by dopamine traps. It’s not your fault. Tech is designed to hijack your brain. But the good news is, your focus is *trainable*. Researched the hell out of this from elite books, podcasts, neuroscience papers, actual cognitive training method not TikTok life coaches who just tell you to “meditate more”.

Here’s how to actually upgrade your focus like a skill, not just a mood.

* **First, understand what broke your attention**
   * *Cal Newport* (professor & author of **“Deep Work”**) argues that ""fragmented attention"" is now our norm. Every time you switch tasks, your brain builds habits around distraction.
   * A 2022 study from the *University of California, Irvine* found that after an interruption, it takes **23 minutes** on average to return to the task. Yet most people switch tasks every 47 seconds. You're not lazy. Your environment is literally wired for chaos.
   * *Tristan Harris*, former Google ethicist, explains in the Netflix doc *“The Social Dilemma”* how apps are built to maximize ""time on platform"", not your well-being. Constant dopamine hits shrink your tolerance for boredom, which is *exactly what deep focus requires*.

* **Tip 1: Use the “20-second rule” to reduce friction**
   * From *Shawn Achor’s* book **“The Happiness Advantage”** he explains that behavior is often driven by *ease*, not willpower.
   * If it takes more than 20 seconds to start a distraction, you’re less likely to do it.
      * *Delete shortcut tabs*
      * *Log out of YouTube and Instagram*
      * *Put your phone in a drawer 20 seconds away*
   * Make your “focus activity” as easy as possible. Open your doc first. Load the website you need the night before. Remove choices.

* **Tip 2: Train your “attention muscle” like a workout**
   * A 2023 meta-analysis published in *Nature Reviews Neuroscience* confirms that attention is *plastic* you can strengthen it with practice.
   * Do a “Focus Sprint”:
      * Set a timer for **10 minutes** to start (yes, just ten).
      * Pick one hard thing.
      * **No switching**, **no checking**.
      * Increase duration over time.
   * This mimics what *Dr. Andrew Huberman* (Stanford neuroscientist) calls ""self-directed neuroplasticity"". The more you practice single-tasking under discomfort, the more your brain builds that skill.

* **Tip 3: Dopamine doesn’t mean happiness – control it or it controls you**
   * Dr. Anna Lembke (Stanford psychiatrist, author of **“Dopamine Nation”**) says we're overdosed on stimulation. That leads to “dopamine burnout” you feel foggy, anxious, can’t enjoy low-stimulus tasks like reading or writing.
   * Try a **dopamine detox** for a few hours:
      * No phone, music, screens, or junk food
      * Go for a walk, journal, drink water
   * This resets your dopamine baseline. Suddenly, things like reading or working start to *feel* rewarding again.
   * Note: it’s not about “cutting out all pleasure” forever. It’s about *retraining your nervous system* to enjoy focus again.

* **Tip 4: Caffeine is a focus tool—not a crutch**
   * According to research from *Johns Hopkins University*, caffeine improves focus **only when timing and dosage are optimized**.
      * Wait **90 minutes after waking** before caffeine
      * Avoid after **2pm** to protect sleep
      * 100–200mg (1 strong coffee) is usually enough
   * Too much caffeine leads to jittery focus, not deep focus. Pair caffeine with focus sprints, not doom-scrolling.

* **Tip 5: Train your boredom tolerance**
   * The ability to be bored is now a *superpower*. A 2021 study in *Journal of Experimental Psychology* found that ""low boredom tolerance"" predicts higher procrastination and lower performance.
   * Practice sitting with boredom for **5 minutes/day**.
      * Stare out the window
      * Don’t reach for your phone
      * Just let your thoughts wander
   * This rewires your brain to stop fleeing discomfort. It’s how you build focus grit.

* **Tip 6: Turn your focus into a ritual, not a grind**
   * Elite performers often make deep work a daily ritual.
      * Same time
      * Same environment
      * Same warm-up (coffee, walk, white noise)
   * James Clear in **""Atomic Habits""** says that *cue-driven rituals* lower resistance. It’s not about motivation, it’s about consistency through frictionless setup.

If you can’t focus for 10 minutes, it doesn’t mean you’re doomed. Your brain just needs a reset. You wouldn't expect to lift 100 lbs on your first gym visit. Same with deep work. Zero guilt, just reps.

Start with 10 minutes. Build from there. That’s how you go from ✨stim-addicted zombie✨ to builder of whatever future you actually want.",1,1767037109.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

Having just graduated university I have some down time on my hands so I was thinking about getting into this hobby. 

A year ago when I lived in a dorm, I learnt to pull shots and loved doing it, more than actually drinking it. I dont usually drink coffee as most of my life Ive drank instant. I only know the basics like how to tamp, steam milk but no idea the mechanics, how to clean and do things to make coffee not run too fast/slow, etc.

I love learning about new things and I was thinking of getting a home setup to try but Im really afraid its just a phase. Even thought about doing matcha but felt too simple. I looked up some second hand ones on fb marketplace but get worried it might be faulty/get scammed (didnt have good experience buying electronics from fb marketplace)

Ive looked at the Breville Barista Express and Bambino and theyre similar prices here in Australia. About 500 from JB. 

Thats basically it, thank you for reading all this, honestly just seeking any advice you guys can give on this.

My pup is a 6-month-old hound heeler mix (with sprinkles of other breeds, according to Embark). He needs a lot of exercise, which is perfectly fine with me. We start off with morning sniff walks, fetch, and running in a big park or a dog park (if it's not too crazy) and then end up with three or more playtimes in the park and even more walks and tons of time in the backyard. All of this to say, he does not play indoors a lot. 

The day started off with heavy rain and slush. He still wanted to go out, so I tested it out in the backyard. My pup likes going out during a snowstorm, but for the first time, he decided the rain and wind were too much, even with a raincoat.

So we stayed in. Each hour we stayed in made him more stir crazy. It threw him off schedule, and he started chewing up my coffee table, my jacket, our couch, etc. Mental stimulation wasn't even working, and he wanted to be out and wanted me to stop the rain. We ended the day frustrated and went to bed. He woke me up at 5 AM to go poop, which was unusual. We went out, and the rain had mostly frozen over into a slick surface in the backyard. I watched him walk, and he seemed okay, and I stepped in and BAM! I haven't felt pain like this in a long time. My backside hit the rock hard, slick  ice. I was sliding towards my pup, who was in the middle of pooping, with no grip. I ended up smearing my pajamas, hands, and slipons in soft stool and just lay there for a minute, all while my pup was looking at me, confused as to what was happening.",5,1767036988.0,puppy101,1,1.0,False

1pyvqm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spikerz_Security/comments/1pyvqm0/can_ai_really_protect_your_online_reputation/,Can AI really protect your online reputation? Here’s what you need to know,"Your brand is constantly mentioned across the internet every day. Someone’s posting about your product on Reddit, a customer is leaving a review on Facebook, and an impersonator just created a fake account using your logo.

How do you keep track of it all?

You can’t hire enough people to monitor every mention, comment, and post about your business across every platform. But the good news is that you don’t have to do it alone.

AI is a powerful tool that processes massive amounts of data that your team can’t handle on their own. And the best thing is, it excels at the hybrid approach businesses need today.

AI continuously scans social media platforms, news sites, forums, and review sites for mentions of your brand. It flags potential threats like impersonators or negative sentiment patterns, and it filters spam from legitimate customer feedback so human reviewers can focus on the truly important issues that require judgment and strategic thinking.

So in this post, we’ll cover what brand monitoring is, how AI transforms the process, and the specific ways AI protects your reputation through content monitoring, impersonation detection, and tracking online mentions.

# What Is Brand Monitoring?

Brand monitoring is the process of tracking mentions of your company, products, or services across the internet. This practice includes monitoring social media posts, news articles, blog content, review sites, forums, and anywhere else your brand might appear.

The goal is to understand public perception, identify potential issues before they escalate, and engage with your audience in meaningful ways.

Here’s an example of what effective brand monitoring looks like this:

A coffee shop chain uses monitoring tools to track mentions across social platforms. When a customer posts about finding a foreign object in their drink, the monitoring system immediately flags the mention. The brand’s team then responds within 30 minutes, apologizing, and offering to make it right.

This quick response can easily turn a potential PR disaster into a demonstration of excellent customer service. After that, other customers may see the interaction and comment positively about the brand’s responsiveness. Or at the very least know that if something were to happen to them, the brand would make it right.

# How Does AI Help With Brand Monitoring?

AI helps with three critical areas: content monitoring, impersonation detection, and tracking online mentions.

AI helps brands monitor content mentioning their products, services, and brand name across social media platforms. These tools scan posts, stories, and videos for mentions of your business, giving you visibility into customer conversations you’d otherwise miss.

AI also filters spam, phishing attempts, and irrelevant content before it reaches your audience. For example, [Spikerz helps brands](https://www.spikerz.com/comment-moderation%20/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_content=Can_AI_protect_online_reputation) with comment moderation through real-time scanning and automated filtering.

*Processing img wlvw4kr737ag1...*

Our platform analyzes comments as they appear, blocking spam and phishing attempts before they cause harm. You can customize what counts as unwanted content, and Spikerz handles the filtering automatically. The system runs 24/7 across Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube, ensuring your comment sections stay clean without constant manual oversight.

# Impersonation Monitoring

There are different types of impersonation that monitoring tools can scan for like social media impersonation, website impersonation, spoofing, etc. Here’s a brief overview of the first two:

**Social media impersonation**

AI helps brands scan social media for impersonators who create fake accounts using your brand name, logo, or similar visual identity. It’s essential to find and remove these accounts because if you leave them alone, they’ll scam your customers, damage your reputation, and steal your business.

*Processing img anh8pfv937ag1...*

The good news is that there are [tools like Spikerz](https://www.spikerz.com/impersonators%20/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_content=Can_AI_protect_online_reputation) that scan for impersonator accounts by analyzing profile information, visual elements, and account behavior. When it finds a fake account, the system alerts you immediately. You can then report the impersonator to the platform and work toward removal.

**Website impersonation**

Criminals create fake websites that mimic your site to steal customer data or money. Spoofing is the technical term for this practice (attackers replicate your domain name with slight variations to trick customers). For example, they might use “arnaz0n(.)com” instead of “amazon(.)com,” replacing the “o” with a zero.

AI tools help monitor for spoofed domains by scanning domain registrations and analyzing website structures. They identify sites that copy your design, content, or branding. When the system detects a spoofed site, you can take legal action to shut it down.

# Online Mentions

Your brand is mentioned in blog posts, YouTube videos, news articles, podcasts, and other digital channels so tracking all these mentions manually at scale is impossible.

Thankfully, monitoring tools scan these channels continuously, identifying when someone mentions your brand. The technology understands variations of your brand name, common misspellings, and related terms.

The system also analyzes sentiment in these mentions, helping you understand whether coverage is positive, negative, or neutral. That way you can then prioritize responding to negative mentions that might escalate into larger issues. Or use positive mentions as opportunities for engagement and building relationships with supporters.

# Conclusion

AI makes tracking practical by monitoring content, detecting impersonators, and tracking online mentions at a scale. The result is better protection for your reputation and more opportunities to connect with your audience.

If you want to be a rat and extract with a loadout full of cheese, go for it. If you only want to run PvE solos and chill, you can do that. If you love sweating in PvP, that’s doable. If you want to roleplay as a medic or a backstabbing villain, the game lets you live that. The person who hops on once a week to rat the extract with a cup of coffee and a Netflix episode in the background can have a perfect session. The person who treats it like Stardew Valley and cares about resource-gathering and maxxing out their stash can do that too.

I’m primarily a single-player RPG guy, most of my friends only touch single-player stuff. But somehow this game scratches that single-player itch. Solo moments where you encounter a KoS PvPer feels like a Dark Souls invader dropping into your game. It's tense and somehow right for the tone. At the same time, the competitive side is deep enough that the sweats have a blast.

I’ve never seen a multiplayer shooter balance that breadth so well. Has any other shooter pulled this off? Catering equally to rats, solo PvE folks, hardcore PvP players, and roleplayers, without feeling split or compromised? Because Arc Raiders feels like it pulls it off. 300 hours later and I'm still obsessed.",7,1767036632.0,ArcRaiders,7,0.82,False

They copy-paste the same script:

• “next-gen” AI trading bot  
• Telegram hype 24/7  
• Dubai office  
• leadership who already destroyed 2–3 other platforms

Add buzzwords like *funded accounts*, *automation*, *compounding*, and BOOM…

✨ Exfusion is born. ✨

And if it feels familiar?

That’s because it is.

It’s not new.  
It’s not innovative.  
It’s just the **same MLM trading scheme with new graphics**.

Let’s actually unpack this — calmly, logically, no fear tactics.

# 🔍 Who Actually Runs Exfusion?

https://preview.redd.it/tvcjlyop27ag1.jpg?width=1216&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77ec2dfa6f1d51ffa3ee4351497935626efea21c

This is where things get weird fast.

No legit corporate structure.  
No public leadership.  
No verifiable executives.  
No compliance team.

Instead:

• subdomain website  
• broken root domain  
• Telegram channel that acts like HQ

Every time you trace the people involved, you find names attached to **previous collapses**.

Not “allegedly.”  
Historically. Documented.

And of course…

A convenient Dubai connection.

Dubai itself isn’t illegal — but it *is* where countless MLM trading programs relocate right before launch.

Huge coincidence, right?

# 🛒 Exfusion “Products”

This will be quick:

There. Are. None.

No software license  
No education  
No retail tools  
Nothing you can actually buy or use

The only thing being sold?

➡️ Participation in the system.

Meaning:

>

That’s not a business.  
That’s a pipeline.

# 💸 The Compensation Plan (Where Reality Breaks)

Here’s the pitch:

>

Cool story.

Except:

• no verified trading statements  
• no audited results  
• no losing months shown  
• no risk disclosures  
• charts that magically only go up

If real traders ever saw this, they’d choke on their coffee.

Then comes the **MLM part**:

Commissions based on:

• what you invest  
• who you recruit  
• what THEY invest  
• and so on…

With extras like:

• ROI matching  
• infinity bonuses  
• global pools  
• dream homes  
• watches

Because nothing says “legit financial service” like rewarding people with Rolexes for bringing in more recruits.

If trading actually generated profit, recruitment wouldn’t be necessary.

# 🧾 Cost to Join

Technically “free.”

But to earn?

• you must deposit  
• stay active  
• and recruit

No deposit = no earnings.  
No recruiting = basically nothing.

Translation:

>

# ✅ Pros

• slick branding  
• easy to pitch  
• appeals to beginners who don’t understand trading

That’s really it.

# ❌ Cons

• no real products  
• zero external revenue  
• leadership tied to past failures  
• recruitment-dependent payouts  
• offshore operations  
• cannot sustain without constant new deposits

It checks almost every Ponzi box.

# 🧠 Final Thoughts

https://preview.redd.it/xf69lr2r27ag1.jpg?width=3321&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bc0ac3c081d941af8907177cb340877daf6e900

Exfusion isn’t a breakthrough trading platform.

It’s a **recruitment-driven money funnel** that only works while new people keep putting cash in.

History shows how this always plays out:

• withdrawals slow  
• excuses start  
• admins vanish  
• “updates coming soon” replaces payouts

A tiny group may profit early.

Most people lose.

Worst part?

People end up dragging their friends and family into it… then feel guilty when it collapses.

If you’re looking for *actual* long-term wealth, this isn’t it.

1pyvlu4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pyvlu4,Aeropress Premium Shattered After Only Two Brews 😔,"After only making two cups of coffee with my new premium AeroPress, the glass already shattered on me.

To be fair, I love AeroPress. I've been an AeroPress customer for over eight years and I use it every day, so I was really excited when I heard about the premium version. There's no plastic, and I figured if I’m using AP in my house every day and there's something else out there that is of higher quality, looks better, I'm happy to pay the premium price. Also, I liked the fact that there was no plastic.

I received the premium on December 26th, 2025. I brewed my first cup on December 27th, 2025, had no issues. Then on December 28th, I brewed my second cup. I was extremely careful because of it being glass. I had no issues pushing the plunger through making the cup of coffee, but after a couple of minutes, I wanted to clean it. So, I removed the stainless steel filter cap to push the puck out using the plunger, and as I was pushing the puck out with the plunger over my trash can, I heard a crack. I looked in the trash can, and sure enough, there was a big chunk of glass that had broken off from the bottom.

I've been trying to get in touch with AeroPress customer service all day today and yesterday, but I haven't had any luck. I'm hoping they respond to me quickly because it obviously seems like a manufacture defect. 

I used the product as expected. I didn't drop it. I didn't bump it. I didn't nick it. I was extremely careful with it. If I had been clumsy and I knocked it over, or my kids had picked it up and dropped it and shattered it, that's one thing, and I'd be happy to cover the cost of a replacement. 

But this did not happen. 

I was extremely careful with it. 

I was simply pushing the plunger through, and it shattered. And to happen on the second day of using it tells me that the chamber was most likely defective before I even received it. 

I’ll be sure to report back what AP customer service says. I’m hoping they honor the warranty and send me a replacement Chamber that isn’t defective. ",31,1767036518.0,AeroPress,24,0.92,False

• Get really clear on one niche and one service first instead of trying to manage everyone and everything (I landed on local small businesses like gyms, mom & pop stores, and coffee shops)  
• Treat systems like a client from day one things like contracts, onboarding docs, and a simple workflow save so much stress later  
• Use a scheduling tool early (I use Vista Social) so you’re not living inside apps all day and can actually focus on growth

I’ll read anything if it sounds interesting.  I think I’ve read 6 books so far in 2025 (not counting a few coffee table books that I pick up once in a while).  I’ve got a few in my kindle app I’ve been debating starting, but nothing is really jumping out at me, and I’m open to other recommendations too.  I’ll make a list of everything I’ve read this year and a few thoughts on it.

There’s Always This Year: On Basketball and Ascension by Hanif Abdurraqib - read it at the beginning of the year, don’t remember a ton of details tbh, but I enjoyed it.

Dilla Time by Dan Charnas - really liked it, it’s a biography about one of my favorite music producers, and anything that ties into Michigan/Detroit stuff is interesting to me since that’s where I’m from.  

Framed: A Villain’s Perspective on Social Media by Tim O’hearn - thought it was pretty good and interesting, not exactly what I expected when I picked it up but I thought it was worth the read.  

Expensive Basketball by Shea Serrano - really enjoyed this.  I’m a big fan of Shea Serrano’s writing but I’ve read all of his other books already.  

10 Commandments of Con-Men… by John Bejakovic - bought it cause the title sounded interesting, it was really a collection of short stories that tied into “commandments”, read it in like a week.  Wasn’t bad but it skewed a bit more towards “self help, learn to sell things” than I’m looking for, especially since I don’t work in sales and probably never will.  

Overlook by Matt McCusker - the only novel on this list.  Finished it yesterday.  Changing narrators every chapter seemed weird at first but by the end of the book I really enjoyed it.  I don’t think it’s that popular cause I can’t find too many people online talking about it but I’ve recommended it to a few friends already.  

And then I’ve got “Fuck It, I’ll Start Tomorrow” by action Bronson and a copy of Take Ivy on my coffee table lol.

In my kindle app I’ve got:

Roadside Picnic, which a friend recommended, I don’t really know much about it.

1984… but I’m not sure if I feel like reading that right now, with the real world being the way it is.

I’m open to pretty much anything, I think I’m leaning towards reading another novel since I really liked Overlook, but I love non fiction too.  Especially anything sports/music/fashion/history related.  ",1,1767036242.0,suggestmeabook,2,1.0,False

Except Sophia Young.


Three years ago, Sophia saved Harrison when he'd lost his memory. They fell for each other. He took her virginity, tattooed her name over his heart.


Then his memory came back. He returned to the Coldwell empire. His family set up an arranged marriage, but Harrison destroyed it all—just to marry that poor girl, Sophia Young.


Less than a year later, he changed completely.


Now Sophia was kneeling in the freezing snow because of Gwendolyn Crawford—his father's former mistress.


Gwendolyn's son spiked a fever. Harrison blamed Sophia.


The wind sliced through her. Sophia pressed her hand against her stomach. Two months pregnant. She hadn't told him.


When she didn't kneel fast enough, Harrison signaled his bodyguards.


Sophia fought back. She couldn't risk the baby.


""Harrison! I didn't fucking touch that kid! I'm not kneeling!""


She glared straight at him.


Harrison grabbed her jaw, voice like ice. ""Sophia, you've been Mrs. Coldwell long enough. Time you remembered who's actually in charge.""


Sophia's eyes went wide. She couldn't believe he'd say that.


He used to give her the world.


The bodyguards moved in again.


This time Sophia stopped fighting. Slowly, she dropped to her knees in the snow.


Two months ago, Sophia discovered Gwendolyn existed.


Harrison suddenly had love songs on his phone. He never listened to music.


Then Sophia caught them at a boutique—Harrison holding Gwendolyn's hand, some kid calling them Mom and Dad.


Sophia stormed over, demanded answers.


Gwendolyn pulled the boy close, all innocent concern. ""Miss Young, you've got it wrong. Harrison asked me to help pick your gift.""


She looked at Harrison, worried. ""This is my fault. Lucas and I should leave.""


Perfect act. Sophia looked like the psycho wife.


That night, Sophia destroyed everything in the penthouse.


Harrison just stood there watching.


""Gwendolyn was my dad's mistress. Don't overthink it. She saved my life once. Nothing's going on.""


""She's been raising Dad's kid alone for years, dealing with all that shit. I'm helping them out—family responsibility.""


""Babe, come on. You're the one I love.""


Sophia didn't argue. She started drafting divorce papers in secret.


Then she found out she was pregnant.


Her uterine lining was too thin. Pregnancy should've been impossible. This baby was a miracle.


For this child, she backed down. Maybe she should trust him.


But Harrison got worse.


He publicly claimed Lucas as his son at some gala. Took ""business trips"" with Gwendolyn. Someone sent Sophia photos of them screwing.


The day Sophia confronted him, she ran into Lucas in the garage. Didn't do shit to him. That night the kid got a fever, wouldn't stop screaming.


Garage camera was conveniently broken. No evidence.


Harrison stared her down like she was trash.


""Sophia, I've told you a million times—they're not a threat to you. But you still went after an innocent kid. Guess I spoiled you too damn much.""


Sophia's lips trembled.


Gwendolyn's call came through. Harrison's entire face softened.


""Hey, don't worry. I'm on my way.""


He turned to leave, threw one line over his shoulder. ""Stay on your knees. Think real hard about what you did.""


Sophia watched him walk away without a single glance back.


This dream was over.


Snow fell all night. Her knees went completely numb.


Sophia pulled out her phone, fingers shaking.


""Dad, I agree to the divorce.""


Chapter 2


The surgery lights went out. When they wheeled Sophia out, her face was ghost-white.


Her empty belly had drained every bit of hope from her body.


Before the surgery, the doctor tried to warn her.


""Miss Young, you already have trouble conceiving. After this abortion, getting pregnant again might be...""


Tears fell. She didn't want this either.


This decision felt like carving out her own heart. It hurt like hell. But she didn't regret it.


The moment Harrison cheated, they were done.


As she was leaving the hospital, she heard a familiar voice around the corner.


Her feet stopped. She turned, eyes drawn to the half-open hospital room door.


Harrison was carefully peeling an apple, cutting it into perfect little pieces, feeding them to Gwendolyn like she was precious fucking china.


Next to them, the little boy had an IV in his arm, playing with a red toy car, making soft engine noises.


Perfect little family.


A passing nurse stared at them with envy.


""That family in VIP 302 is so lucky. The dad's been taking care of them nonstop. And he's gorgeous.""


""Right? Miss Crawford's so blessed. I heard he got the hospital director to arrange the best suite last night—didn't want the noise bothering his kid.""


Sophia listened to their chatter. She couldn't even cry anymore.


The nurse noticed her deathly pale face, her swaying body.


""Ma'am, you look terrible. Are you okay? Should I call your family?""


Sophia glanced one last time at that warm, happy room. Her voice came out flat.


""Don't bother. I don't have family.""


She gripped the handrail, forcing herself step by step toward the elevator.


Behind her, the nurse sighed.


""Poor thing. Going through an abortion all alone...""


Back home, Sophia started packing.


Everything Harrison ever gave her—she threw it all out.


Photos of their happy past? She ripped them to shreds with her bare hands.


Even the massive wedding portrait hanging in the living room—she called the staff to take it down.


They'd flown to Finland for that shot, waited three freezing days and nights just to catch the Northern Lights at their peak.


Supposedly a once-in-a-millennium sight.


Now? She didn't want any of it.


Sophia smashed the frame glass, grabbed a knife, and carved Harrison's face out of the photo—slashed it over and over until you couldn't recognize him anymore.


""Even the most beautiful view can't last forever.""


Just like their love. A flash in the pan.


That night, Harrison came home with Gwendolyn and her son.


""Sophia, it's hard for Gwendolyn to take care of Lucas alone. The villa has plenty of staff. It'll be easier here. Starting today, they're moving in.""


Sophia nodded. Didn't argue.


""Fine.""


Her easy agreement made Harrison pause.


He was about to say something when Gwendolyn cut in.


""Miss Young, I'm so sorry for the trouble. Lucas, didn't you prepare a gift? Go ahead, give it to Auntie Sophia.""


Lucas pulled out a delicate little snow globe from his backpack.


Sophia hesitated, then reached out to take it.


The second her fingers touched the base, she hissed and jerked her hand back.


A drop of blood welled up from her palm.


She looked closer—there was a sharp, jagged piece of metal sticking out from the snow globe's base.


The globe fell, shattered on the floor. Lucas burst into tears.


Gwendolyn rushed to shield the boy, voice shaking.


""Miss Young, are you okay?! He loves this snow globe. The base must've gotten damaged before... He didn't mean it.""


Sophia silently reached for a tissue to wipe the blood.


Harrison stepped forward and shoved her aside.


""What the hell is wrong with you?""


""It's just a scratch. The kid didn't do it on purpose. Why are you making such a big deal out of this?""


The shove sent Sophia stumbling backward. Her lower back slammed hard into the sharp corner of the coffee table.


Pain exploded through her. Her vision went black. She could barely stand.


But she still caught the panic in Harrison's eyes—and Gwendolyn clutching Lucas like Sophia was some kind of monster.


Suddenly, Sophia felt exhausted like never before.


The anger rising in her chest lost all meaning.


What was the point? Getting mad at a man who didn't love her anymore just made her look pathetic.


Sophia didn't say a word. She held onto the staircase railing and dragged herself back to her room.


Chapter 3


The next morning, Sophia was still asleep when someone yanked her out of bed.


Harrison's face was dark as hell. He dragged her straight to the dining room.


The place was a disaster. Lucas was covered in hives, screaming his lungs out. Gwendolyn was crying, trying to calm him down.


A young maid was on her knees, shaking like a leaf.


Harrison stared at her, voice cold as ice.


""Say it again. Everything you just told me.""


The maid glanced at Sophia, then stammered out:


""Mrs. Coldwell—she was pissed about what Lucas did yesterday. She made me put mango sauce in his milk. She knew he was allergic. She said... she said the kid needed to be taught a lesson...""


Sophia's heart dropped. She was wide awake now.


""That's bullshit! I didn't even know he was allergic to—""


Harrison cut her off, furious.


""There's evidence. There's a witness. And you're still gonna lie?""


Gwendolyn wiped her tears. She didn't yell. Just looked at Sophia with those pleading eyes, voice soft but clear.


""Miss Young, moving in was never my choice. Harrison was just trying to help. But I understand—this is your home. We'll leave. I won't make this harder for you.""


She clutched Lucas tighter, voice breaking.


""Just... if you're angry, come at me. Not him. He's just a kid. A severe allergic reaction could kill him...""


She turned to leave, looking fragile but determined.


Harrison grabbed her arm, voice gentle and protective.


""Gwendolyn, don't go. You're not the one who should leave.""


He pulled her behind him, then turned to Sophia with ice in his eyes.


""Sophia, I thought you just had a temper. I didn't think you'd actually try to kill a child.""


His face was full of disappointment and disgust.


""Lock her in the basement. She stays there until she learns to admit what she did.""


""It wasn't me!""


Sophia tore herself free, staring hard at the maid.


""You say I told you to do it? Fine. When? Where? Did I say it to your face or call you? Besides your word, what proof do you have?""


The maid stammered, couldn't answer. Harrison hesitated for a second.


That's when Gwendolyn sniffled and said softly:


""Harrison, forget it. Lucas is okay. Don't let us ruin your marriage.""


But Lucas just cried louder.


Harrison's hesitation vanished. He exploded.


""Enough! Stop playing victim! Yesterday you acted so fucking obedient, I thought you'd finally grown up. Guess I was wrong. Who else would do this but you?!""


He waved at his guards.


""Take her down. No one lets her out without my permission.""


As they dragged Sophia away, she caught Gwendolyn leaning into Harrison's chest—and the flash of triumph in her eyes.


The so-called ""basement"" was a massive iron cage. The bottom was crawling with hundreds of water snakes.


The guards shoved her inside and locked the door.


The second that lock clicked, Sophia lost it. She screamed, trying to get away, but the cage was too small. Snakes everywhere—slithering, cold, wet.


She felt them sliding up her ankles, her calves. One crawled up her back.


She screamed until her voice gave out. But her mind kept flashing back to three years ago.


Harrison holding her, laughing softly.


""I love how fearless you are. From now on, I've got you. Even if you burn the whole world down, I'll take the heat.""


Now? The man who swore to protect her was the one who threw her in here.


Sophia was huddled in the corner, shaking, when Gwendolyn showed up with Lucas.


The sweet, gentle act? Gone. She was smirking now.


Lucas stared at Sophia with pure hatred.


""Bad lady. Why won't you just die? If you die, I won't have to share Daddy anymore.""


Gwendolyn stroked his hair, voice soft.


""Don't worry, sweetie. Auntie Sophia looks bored. Let's help her wake up, okay?""


She lifted a squirming bag and dumped dozens of rats into the cage.


The rats squealed, running all over Sophia.


The snakes got agitated. Right in front of her, they started feeding.


The stench. The sight of it. Sophia dry-heaved, but she hadn't eaten in days. Nothing came up but bile.


Gwendolyn watched her, eyes full of jealousy and rage.


""Sophia, you're just some maid's daughter. Why the hell did you get to live like a queen all these years? If you could have it, why can't I?""


Her voice cracked, almost crying now.


""My son and I have suffered for so long just to get here. Harrison's our only shot. I won't let you ruin this...""


Sophia tried to speak, but she was too weak. No sound came out.


Gwendolyn stared down at her, cold and victorious.


""Enjoy yourself, Mrs. Coldwell.""


She took Lucas's hand and walked away.


The cage went silent again. Sophia curled up in the corner, surrounded by the smell of blood and rot.


Her eyes got heavier and heavier.


Then everything went black.

1pyvemn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/1pyvemn/the_drive_you_dont_remember/,The Drive You Don't Remember,"You've had this experience. Everyone has.

You pull into your driveway after work, turn off the engine, and sit there for a moment with a strange feeling creeping over you. You have no memory of the drive. None. The last thing you remember is merging onto the highway, and now you're home. Somewhere between those two points, you navigated traffic, braked for red lights, used your turn signal, and made a dozen micro-adjustments to the steering wheel. But ""you,"" the thinking, narrating part of your mind, weren't there for any of it.

Or consider something even more unsettling. You're sitting on the couch, lost in thought. The next thing you know, you're standing in front of the open refrigerator, staring at the milk. You didn't make a decision to stand up. You didn't consciously think, ""I'm going to walk to the kitchen now."" Your body just moved. And only after you're already there, hand on the door, does your mind catch up and offer a plausible explanation. *Oh, I must be thirsty.*

These moments are so common we barely notice them. But if you sit with them, really sit with them, they raise a question that has haunted [philosophers](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/auto-draftilluminating-the-mind-lessons-psychology-can-learn-from-anthropology-and-philosophy/) and scientists for centuries. **Who is actually in control here?**

We all walk through life with a deep assumption that there's a unified ""I"" at the helm. A captain of the ship. A CEO of the self. We believe this ""I"" makes decisions, executes plans, and authors our behavior. But what if that belief is itself a kind of story? What if the captain is actually a passenger, one who's very good at taking credit for driving the car?

# Two Ways of Understanding the Mind

To explore this question, we need to meet two of the most important neuroscientists of our time. Their work seems to point in opposite directions, but I want to suggest that they're actually describing the same territory from different vantage points. Understanding how their insights fit together can change not only how you think about your brain, but how you approach your own healing.

Let me introduce them through a metaphor I'll use throughout this piece. Inside your mind, there are two figures constantly at work. One I'll call **The Storyteller**. The other I'll call **The Navigator**.

# The Storyteller

[Michael Gazzaniga](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/consciousness-and-depth-psychology-insights-from-michael-gazzaniga/) spent decades studying people whose brains had been surgically divided, patients whose left and right hemispheres could no longer communicate with each other. What he discovered in these studies revealed something profound about how all of our minds work, not just those who've had surgery.

In the left hemisphere, Gazzaniga found what he called ""[The Interpreter.""](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/revisioning-psychotherapy-beyond-the-biomedical-model-to-understand-consciousness-and-neural-networks/) Think of it as an internal press secretary whose job is to make sense of everything you do, no matter what. If you act on impulse, if you do something bizarre, if your body moves before you've thought about it, the Interpreter swoops in and instantly constructs a logical explanation. It writes the story of why you did what you did.

This is The Storyteller. Its primary concern isn't truth. It's coherence. It wants you to feel like a unified, rational person with clear motivations. It wants the narrative to make sense. And it's remarkably good at its job. So good, in fact, that you rarely notice it working. You just assume that the story it tells is accurate, that when you reached for the coffee cup, you did so because you consciously decided to.

But here's the uncomfortable part. The Storyteller is often wrong. It doesn't actually know why you did what you did. It just knows it needs to provide an explanation, and it will confabulate one if necessary. The story comes *after* the action, not before. The Storyteller is a historian, constantly editing the past to make you look like the decision-maker you believe yourself to be.

Gazzaniga's research led him to a startling conclusion. The brain is not a unified command center with a CEO making executive decisions. It is more like a confederation of independent modules working in parallel, each doing its own job. There is no central executive. The feeling that there is one, the feeling that ""you"" are in charge, is what some researchers call the ""User Illusion."" It's a necessary fiction, useful for navigating social life, but a fiction nonetheless.

# The Navigator

Now let's turn to[ Karl Friston,](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/the-predictive-mind-karl-fristons-free-energy-principle-and-its-implications-for-consciousness/) who may be the most influential theoretical neuroscientist working today. His framework is more abstract, but it gets at something fundamental about why brains exist in the first place.

[Friston proposes that your brain's deepest purpose](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/karl-friston-and-carl-jung-the-unnoticed-rehabilitation/), beneath all the thinking and feeling and remembering, is simply to keep you alive in an unpredictable world. To do this, it has to become an extraordinary prediction machine. Every moment, your brain is generating expectations about what will happen next and then comparing those expectations against what actually happens. When there's a mismatch, when reality surprises the brain, it has to act quickly to resolve the discrepancy.

This is The Navigator. It operates at a level far below conscious thought. It deals with gravity, physics, balance, threat detection, and the coordination of hundreds of muscles in split-second timing. The Navigator is running the show milliseconds before The Storyteller even wakes up.

When you're driving home on autopilot, The Navigator is doing the driving. It's tracking the car ahead, calculating distances, adjusting speed, all without bothering to inform your conscious mind. Consciousness, from this perspective, is almost an afterthought. An energy-expensive luxury that's useful sometimes but not always necessary.

Friston calls this the ""Free Energy Principle,"" but you can think of it more simply. For any biological system to exist, it must maintain a boundary between itself and the chaotic world. To do this, it must constantly predict the future to avoid surprise. Surprise, in this context, means entropy, means death. The Navigator is a cold, calculating statistical engine. It doesn't care about your feelings or your self-image. It cares about error minimization. It cares about keeping you alive.

And here's the crucial difference from Gazzaniga. In Friston's view, you don't just passively interpret the world. You actively sample it to confirm your predictions. You aren't a reporter watching a movie. You are the director, ensuring that the script, your internal model, matches the scene unfolding before you. Your brain predicts ""I am raising my arm,"" and the motor system fulfills that prediction to maintain internal consistency. The model causes the action.

# 

# The Great Disagreement on Causation

Here's where things get interesting. These two frameworks seem to contradict each other on a fundamental question. What causes your behavior?

Imagine you reach out and pick up a cup of coffee. What made that happen?

The Storyteller's account goes like this. *I* caused it. I felt thirsty, I made a conscious decision, and I moved my arm. My thoughts led to my actions. This is what philosophers call top-down causation, the mind directing the body. The timing here is what we might call post-hoc, meaning after the fact. The brain acts, and then the mind makes up a reason why.

The Navigator's account is very different. Your body detected dehydration before you were aware of feeling thirsty. The predictive machinery calculated the trajectory needed to reach the cup and began firing the appropriate muscles. Your conscious experience of ""deciding"" to pick up the cup came *after* the action was already underway. The feeling of deciding was just The Storyteller doing its job, writing a press release about events it didn't actually cause. The timing here is ante-hoc, meaning before the fact. The brain predicts a state, and the body acts to fulfill that prediction.

If you ask, ""Did I cause my hand to move?"" the two theorists would give you opposite answers.

Gazzaniga would say your motor cortex caused it. Your conscious self just filed the report a millisecond later and claimed credit to maintain a sense of coherence.

Friston would say your internal model predicted the hand would move to minimize surprise. The movement was the necessary result of that prediction. The ""you"" is the model itself.

This sounds like an academic debate, but it has massive implications for mental health. If the Navigator's account is right, it means that many of your behaviors, your anxiety responses, your trauma reactions, your sudden emotional floods, are being driven by parts of your brain that your conscious mind can't directly access or control. And it means that trying to ""think your way out"" of these patterns might be fundamentally misguided.

# The Synthesis: Objectivity and Subjectivity

So who's right? Are we conscious agents authoring our lives, or are we biological automatons watching a movie of decisions we've already made?

The resolution comes when we stop asking which theory is correct and start asking *when* each theory applies. They're both accurate. They're just describing different moments in time, and more than that, they're describing different layers of the same system.

Here is the key insight. What if objectivity is one and subjectivity is the other? What if Friston is describing the objective organism, the biological machinery that actually moves through the physical world, while Gazzaniga is describing the subjective self, the psychological experience of being a person with agency and identity?

When we assign subjectivity to The Storyteller and objectivity to The Navigator, the two theories stop conflicting. They become complementary descriptions of a unified process operating at different timescales and different levels of analysis.

The Navigator deals with brutal reality. Entropy, sensory noise, thermodynamics, the physics of bodies moving through space. It doesn't care about your self-image or your goals. It cares about survival.

The Storyteller deals with useful fiction. It ignores the noise to create a smooth, linear story of ""I."" It creates the feeling of agency, the sense that you are a coherent person making choices. This feeling is essential for navigating social life, for making plans, for having relationships. But it is, in some important sense, a construction.

The disagreement vanishes because they are talking about different milliseconds in the timeline of an event.

# The Time-Lag Solution

Let's slow down that simple act of reaching for coffee to a timescale the brain actually operates on.

**Two hundred milliseconds before you're aware of anything.** The Navigator is already at work. Deep, unconscious, somatic parts of your brain have detected a need. Perhaps blood chemistry has shifted slightly, signaling thirst. The Navigator runs its predictions, calculates the physics required to move your arm to the cup, and begins firing muscles. This all happens in the dark, outside the theater of consciousness.

This is why [Somatic Experiencing](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/somatic-experiencing-therapy/) can be so powerful in therapy. It speaks directly to The Navigator in a language it understands, rather than trying to reason with it through words.

**Five hundred milliseconds later.** Now, half a second after the action began, which is an eternity in brain time, the sensory information about your moving arm finally reaches conscious awareness. The Storyteller wakes up, notices the arm in motion, and immediately writes its narrative. *I have decided to drink coffee now.*

The Storyteller genuinely believes it made this decision. It has no awareness of the 700-millisecond head start The Navigator had. It experiences itself as the author of the action because by the time it becomes aware of anything, the action is already happening and it needs to explain why.

**The conclusion is humbling.** The Navigator drives the car. The Storyteller writes the travel blog afterward and sincerely believes it was driving the whole time.

This timing difference connects to the famous Libet experiments on free will, which showed that brain activity associated with a decision occurs hundreds of milliseconds before a person becomes consciously aware of having made that decision. The Navigator moves first. The Storyteller narrates second.

# The Biology of Intuition: The Believer and The Skeptic

There is a structure deep in your brain that embodies this conflict between Storyteller and Navigator in biological terms. The basal ganglia, a collection of nuclei involved in movement and decision-making, contains two competing pathways that researchers like Michael Frank have characterized as ""The Believer"" and ""The Skeptic.""

**The Direct Pathway** functions as The Believer, the ""Go"" signal. Its job is to disinhibit action, to say ""Do it! It will work! Reward is coming!"" This pathway is closely aligned with The Storyteller. It loves linear, goal-oriented action. It assumes the plan is perfect. It wants to move forward confidently.

**The Indirect Pathway** functions as The Skeptic, the ""No-Go"" signal. Its job is to inhibit action, to say ""Wait. Something is wrong. I recognize a pattern of danger here."" This pathway is closely aligned with The Navigator, constantly working to minimize risk and entropy.

Usually, The Believer screams louder. Dopamine, acting on D1 receptors, amplifies the direct pathway. We march forward confidently with our ""logical"" plans, our Storyteller spinning narratives about our excellent judgment.

But sometimes The Skeptic breaks through. This is [what we call intuition.](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/on-intuition-and-trauma-neurobiological-intersections-and-mistaken-identities/)

Consider this scenario. You are about to sign a contract. Everything looks fine on paper. Your Storyteller has reviewed the numbers and approved the plan. But suddenly you feel a knot in your stomach. A hesitation you can't explain. Your hand pauses over the signature line.

What just happened? The indirect pathway, usually gated and quiet, has been allowed to speak. It has been processing vast amounts of implicit data that your conscious mind ignored. Micro-expressions on the other party's face. Subtle inconsistencies in their body language. Environmental cues beneath the threshold of awareness. When it detects a mismatch, a prediction error, it fires the ""No-Go"" signal.

The Storyteller is baffled. It has no access to the data the indirect pathway used. It scrambles to invent a reason. ""Maybe I'm just nervous about big decisions."" Or it overrides the hesitation entirely. ""Stop being paranoid. The numbers are fine.""

This is the nightmare scenario for Gazzaniga's Interpreter. The Storyteller only receives the output of the basal ganglia, the action or the hesitation. It does not receive the reasoning of the indirect pathway. So when you break up with someone ""for no reason,"" the neural reality is that your Navigator accumulated thousands of data points of incompatibility and ungated the ""No-Go"" signal. But your Storyteller, lacking access to that data, scrambles to explain. ""I just need to focus on my career right now.""

When we say the indirect pathway is ""less gated,"" we mean it is active and unblocked, allowed to influence behavior. Intuition happens when the brain prioritizes implicit safety over explicit narrative. It is The Navigator breaking through The Storyteller's confident monologue to deliver a warning that can't be put into words.

This has direct implications for understanding dopamine. High dopamine amplifies The Believer, the direct pathway, making us confident and action-oriented. But it also suppresses The Skeptic, making us more likely to ignore our intuitions. This is why hypomanic states feel so productive and confident. The Believer is winning every argument. The Skeptic has been chemically silenced. The Storyteller can spin any narrative it wants without that nagging feeling that something is wrong.

And this is also why those states often end badly. The Navigator's warnings were real. They were just being ignored.

# An Ancient Map of This Territory

If neuroscience tells us the *mechanism* of this split, [depth psychology](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/jungian-therapy-birmingham/) tells us what it *feels* like from the inside, and more importantly, what to do about it.

This division between a conscious narrator and an unconscious operator is exactly what [Carl Jung was mapping over a century ago,](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/carl-jung-explorer-of-the-soul-a-comprehensive-examination-of-his-life-work-and-legacy/) long before we had the brain imaging technology to watch it happen in real time.[ Jung understood that the ""I"" we identify with is just one small part of a much larger psyche](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/a-short-introduction-to-jungian-psychology/), most of which operates outside our awareness.

Contemporary [Jungian analyst John Beebe](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/unlocking-personality-and-worldview-with-the-beebe-model/) offers a framework that maps beautifully onto our neuroscience synthesis. He describes the personality in terms of archetypes, recurring patterns of human experience that show up across cultures and throughout history. His eight-function model is essentially a ""cast of characters"" within the mind, and it aligns remarkably well with the idea of a Storyteller trying to manage a Navigator.

# The Hero and The Shadow

[**The Hero** ](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/the-hero-archetype-exploring-the-protagonist/)corresponds to The Storyteller. In Beebe's model, the Hero is the dominant function, the core of our conscious identity. It is the part of you that says ""I."" Just like Gazzaniga's Interpreter, the Hero's job is to maintain a coherent sense of agency. Even if the action was caused by a deep, unconscious impulse, the Hero steps in immediately to claim credit.

The Hero projects the illusion of unity. If your Navigator reacts to a threat, your Hero function instantly drafts a press release explaining why that reaction was a ""logical choice"" or ""authentic to my values."" It is often the last to know what is actually happening, but the first to speak about it.

**T**[**he Shadow**](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/the-jungian-shadow-exploring-the-hidden-depths-of-the-psyche/) corresponds to The Navigator. In Beebe's model, the Shadow encompasses functions five through eight, the unconscious functions we don't identify with but which still drive our behavior. This maps to Friston's concept of the brain as a predictive engine functioning below conscious awareness. The Shadow holds the repressed wisdom, navigates reality objectively, and processes threats, body language, and physics often without consulting the Hero.

This gives us a psychological language for what the neuroscience describes mechanically. The Hero claims credit for the Shadow's work. The Shadow steers the ship while the Hero holds the wheel and believes it is in control.

# The Opposing Personality

Within the Shadow, [Beebe](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/understanding-the-beebe-model-a-deep-dive-into-your-psyches-hidden-architecture/) identifies specific archetypal functions. The [Opposing Personality,](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/when-reality-breaks-our-rules-how-personality-types-defend-against-prediction-error/) the fifth function, often acts as a skeptical check on the Hero. While the Hero is telling a story, this function provides the nagging doubt, what Friston would call the ""error signal,"" that the story doesn't fit the data.

This is biologically analogous to the indirect pathway in the basal ganglia. It's the part of the system that can say ""wait"" when the Hero wants to charge forward. In moments of stress or crisis, when the Ego's grip loosens, this Opposing Personality can steer behavior in ways the conscious mind doesn't understand or approve of.

# The Demon

At the deepest level of the [Shadow](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/carl-jungs-shadow-holding-the-tension-of-opposites-in-depth-psychology/), Beebe describes the Demon, the eighth function. This is the most ""objective"" layer, the part that can override the Hero completely in times of extreme stress. It represents the raw, chaotic reality, the entropy that Friston's model is constantly trying to minimize.

The Demon is the ultimate Navigator. It doesn't care about your story, your identity, your carefully constructed sense of self. It cares about survival. And in moments of true crisis, it will take over completely, leaving the Storyteller scrambling to explain actions that feel utterly foreign.

# The Anima and The Interface

Between the Hero and the Shadow lies what [Beebe calls the Inferior Function,](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/applying-jungian-psychology-to-fiction-and-screenwriting-part-3-personality-theories/) associated with the [Anima or Animus archetype.](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/the-anima-and-animus-test-discover-your-inner-opposite-in-10-questions/) This is the bridge between the Ego and the unconscious, the place where Storyteller and Navigator meet.

This is where the disagreement between Friston and Gazzaniga plays out in real time within your psyche. The Navigator pushes a prediction error up through the inferior function. The Storyteller feels this uncomfortable impulse and struggles to interpret it.

Consider this example. You're at a party. Suddenly you feel an inexplicable urge to leave. This is the Navigator detecting something, perhaps social fatigue, perhaps a subtle threat cue beneath conscious awareness. Your Hero doesn't understand why. The Anima bridges the gap, manifesting as a mood change, a sense of unease, a feeling you can't name. The Hero then invents the story. ""I'm not anxious. I'm just bored of these people.""

# The Trickster's Revelation

Most of the time, the Hero and the Shadow coexist without major conflict. The Navigator handles the automatic stuff, the Storyteller constructs its narratives, and life rolls along. But sometimes the system breaks down in a way that can't be ignored.

Beebe calls these moments ""[Trickster](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/the-trickster-archetype-mischief-transformation-and-the-instability-of-life/)"" experiences, associated with the seventh function. The Trickster creates double binds, paradoxes, situations where the Storyteller's narrative machinery fails completely.

You've had them. You're having a calm conversation with someone you love, and suddenly you erupt in rage, saying things you immediately regret, acting in ways that feel completely foreign to your sense of self. And afterward, you think, *That wasn't me. I don't know where that came from.*

But it *was* you. It was your Navigator, your Shadow, seizing control of the wheel because it perceived a threat that your Storyteller was ignoring. The Trickster moment is painful precisely because it exposes the Storyteller's fiction. It is the glitch in the matrix where the objective Navigator exposes that the subjective Storyteller was just making things up all along.

The Trickster is the revealer of the User Illusion. It's the moment when you catch yourself doing something your Hero can't explain, when the carefully constructed story of who you are falls apart, when you're forced to confront the fact that much of what drives your behavior lies outside your awareness and control.

# Personality Type and The Battle Within

This framework helps explain why different personality types experience different internal conflicts. The structure of the Hero-Shadow relationship varies depending on psychological type.

Consider someone whose dominant function is [Extraverted Thinking.](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/the-relationship-mirror-how-your-partner-reflects-your-unconscious-patterns/) Their Hero is the logical planner, organizing the world into efficient systems. Their Shadow, containing Introverted Feeling at the eighth position, holds everything that doesn't fit the rational narrative. Emotions that seem inefficient. Values that can't be justified logically. Vulnerable feelings that threaten the Hero's sense of competence.

When this person snaps at a loved one, when they find themselves crying for ""no reason,"" when they make a decision that contradicts everything they supposedly value, it's not a malfunction. It's the Navigator breaking through, delivering information that the Storyteller had been systematically ignoring.

Or consider someone whose dominant function is Introverted Intuition. Their Hero has direct access to pattern recognition and gut knowing. They might seem, on the surface, to be more in touch with the Navigator. But their Shadow, containing Extraverted Sensing at the eighth position, holds everything about immediate physical reality that they've been ignoring. When they crash into a practical disaster, when their body breaks down, when the concrete world refuses to conform to their visions, it's the Demon function demanding attention.

Different types have different blind spots, different places where the Storyteller's narrative is most likely to fail, different configurations of Believer and Skeptic, different relationships between the conscious will and the unconscious Navigator.

# What This Means for Healing

Understanding this split between Storyteller and Navigator isn't just intellectually interesting. It's clinically essential. Many people arrive at therapy because these two parts of themselves have gone to war.

**Consider anxiety.** When you feel anxious, your Storyteller immediately springs into action, generating explanations. *I'm worried about money. My boss hates me. That conversation yesterday went badly.* These explanations feel true because The Storyteller is very convincing. But they're often confabulations, plausible fictions constructed after the fact.

The actual source of the anxiety is usually in The Navigator. Perhaps your nervous system detected something in the environment that reminded it of an old threat. Perhaps you're stuck in a [trauma response](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/polyvagal-theory-trauma-therapy/) that has nothing to do with your current circumstances. Perhaps your indirect pathway, your internal Skeptic, is sending up warning signals based on pattern recognition far more sophisticated than your conscious analysis. The Storyteller doesn't have access to this information, so it invents explanations based on what it *can* see, your thoughts, your circumstances, the surface of your life.

This is why talk therapy sometimes fails with deep trauma. You can't reason with The Navigator. It doesn't speak the language of logic and narrative. It speaks the language of safety, of body sensation, of rhythm, of somatic experience. Trying to ""think your way out"" of a panic attack is like trying to negotiate with your heartbeat. It's trying to get the Storyteller to overrule the Navigator on issues where the Navigator legitimately has more information.

This doesn't mean insight is useless. Understanding why you react the way you do can be profoundly healing. But insight alone often isn't enough. Real integration requires the Storyteller to develop a different relationship with The Navigator, not trying to override it or argue it into submission, but learning to listen to it, to understand what it's trying to communicate, to work *with* it rather than against it.

This is the essence of [Shadow Work](https://gettherapybirmingham.com/shadow-work-jungian-therapy/). It's not about conquering the unconscious or bringing it under the ego's control. That's both impossible and undesirable. You need The Navigator. The indirect pathway, the Skeptic, the Shadow, these are not enemies to be defeated. They contain wisdom that the conscious mind desperately needs.

Shadow Work is about integration. The Storyteller learns humility. It stops pretending to be the captain and starts learning how to be a good co-pilot. It develops respect for the wisdom, and the warnings, that bubble up from below. The Hero and the Shadow stop fighting and start collaborating.

Sometimes this means learning to pause when you feel that inexplicable hesitation, rather than overriding it with a confident narrative. Sometimes it means sitting with an emotion you can't explain, rather than immediately generating a story about why you feel that way. Sometimes it means admitting that your conscious self, your Storyteller, your Hero, doesn't actually know why you did what you did, and being curious about what the Navigator might be trying to communicate.

# Making Peace with the Passenger Seat

There's something terrifying about realizing that ""you,"" the conscious, narrating part of your mind, are not the sole author of your actions. We want to be in control. We want our choices to be *our* choices. The idea that much of what we do originates in systems we can't access or command can feel like a threat to our very sense of self.

But there's also something liberating in this realization.

It means you can stop beating yourself up for having reactions, emotions, and impulses you didn't ""choose."" When you snap at someone, when you can't shake an irrational fear, when you find yourself doing the thing you swore you wouldn't do again, that's not a failure of willpower or character. That's The Navigator, trying its best to keep you alive based on patterns it learned long ago. It's working with old maps. It doesn't know the territory has changed.

It means those moments of inexplicable intuition, when you just *knew* something was wrong despite all logical evidence to the contrary, deserve more respect. That was your indirect pathway, your Skeptic, your Shadow, breaking through with information that your conscious mind couldn't articulate. Learning to listen to these signals, without either dismissing them or letting them overwhelm you, is a crucial skill.

And it means the goal of psychological health isn't to silence the Navigator and let the Storyteller run everything. A Storyteller with no Navigator would be paralyzed, unable to act in the world, ignoring crucial survival information. A Navigator with no Storyteller would be purely reactive, unable to reflect or plan or make meaning. The goal is partnership. Integration. Two parts of one system learning to work together.

Healing begins when The Storyteller stops pretending it's running the show and starts getting curious about what The Navigator is trying to communicate.

Back with one more attempt. I was close-ish [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/s/usntqUvBDn), I think. But I realized I slipped and was going about 70% into the story instead of stopping a third of the way in. I’m hoping this gets me there!

Also, I am currently at 99k words but I have 4 beta readers going through and I’m hoping their feedback will point out areas I can cut down the word count a little more. I’ve already done 3 grueling rounds of line edits and am really hoping to get it lower by maybe cutting a scene or two. Does anyone know if agents care about the difference between 99k and 97k? Or should I aim for 95k? Or am I totally overthinking this, like I do most things?

Thanks in advance. Everyone has been so incredibly helpful thus far!

Dear \[Agent\],

I am seeking representation for KEEP THE GOOD PARTS, a dual-POV upmarket contemporary fiction complete at 99,000 words. It will appeal to readers of Claire Daverley’s *Talking at Night*, Hanna Halperin’s *I Could Live Here Forever*, and Sally Rooney’s *Normal People*.

Two weeks before she meets Caden in a Seattle coffee shop, Aurora nearly drowns in the Pacific Ocean. She drags herself back to shore with a new conviction: she will stop living small. She has spent eighteen years as the good daughter with perfect grades, a future already mapped by everyone except her, a life built on safe choices.

Caden is anything but safe; he’s a drifter who carries trauma from a troubled childhood, who drinks too much and loves too hard, who sees the hungry, unguarded girl Aurora is finally ready to be. For six months, they build a world that belongs only to them: late walks through sleeping streets, graffiti under bridges, a ferret named Noodle, whispered plans for a quiet life by the sea. He makes her feel alive. She makes him want to stop running.

But when Aurora loses her scholarship, the good daughter in her wins out and she returns to her small coastal hometown to salvage her future the responsible way. Caden sees proof of what he’s always feared: he will only drag her down. He writes her a letter full of love, then vanishes—catching freight trains south, sinking deeper into addiction with every mile.

Told across seven years, KEEP THE GOOD PARTS follows two people bound by a first love neither can release, through the cities and lovers and near-misses that keep pulling them back to each other, and what happens when they finally find their way home.

Some months ago I met this girl through common friends. Over time, we developed a very good friendship and became very close. Unfortunately, I moved out to another city in November and we cannot see each other any more on a frequent basis even if I am back in town on weekends quite often. Considering that we are now distant, we essentially keep in touch a lot through texts. And I mean a lot. We text each other daily multiple times, so we keep each other updated for everything. She remembers everything I say and I listen to her daily updates, so I would say that our relationship is good. Basically, we are behaving like girlfriend and boyfriend. Besides that, we never actually dated. Actually, we went to coffee shops together three times, but always in a friend-context. Recently, a common fiend of ours revealed to me that she said to him that she is into me and suggested me to take my shot. So, I invited her out tonight but unfortunately the “date” went as usual: long friendly talks in front of a good cup of coffee. I want to “take my shot” but I couldn’t find the courage. What should I do? Invite her again and have the classic “what are we?” talk? I feel like I am almost there but I am hesitating to take the last step. ",2,1767035852.0,dating_advice,6,1.0,False

1pyv9mf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1pyv9mf/summary_of_my_trip/,Summary of my trip,"I just finished a more than 15 day trip in the country with my wife and baby. We went to Liberia, Bijagua, La Fortuna, Monteverde, Manuel Antonio, Uvita and Samara. 

Here’s my summary of the trip -

Highlights: 

1. People: I don’t see this mentioned a lot in this sub and would be #1 in my list. People are so so good. They are immensely supportive, positive and helpful. There were people always ready to help us and they loved and entertained our baby so much. 

Whenever we struggled with Spanish, had mighty challenge to navigate stroller on horrible pavements, there was always someone coming and helping. Costs Ricans are gem and some of the best people I have ever seen. I guess that’s the main reason behind CR’s high happiness rating. 

2. Biodiversity: No doubt about this as it’s simply incredible and everywhere. The sound and colours of birds are just beautiful. 

3. Internet: Quality of internet and wifi is awesome. We mostly ate at soda shops and even low key soda shops had wifi. Something we didn’t see even in UK on our last trip

4. Food: Even though the options are so low and we mostly had to rely on gallo pinto and Casado, the quality of food was great and it was mind boggling to see how casado was different in each restaurant / soda shop

5. Culture: Knowing about pura vida lifestyle and saying it often is simply inspirational. Also, I didn’t find the culture to be too laidback as people were quick to respond and worked efficiently especially when compared to Mexico where the culture seemed to be highly laidback and sometimes it takes huge time to even get coffee or french fries served

6. Rental Car: I had absolutely great experience with rental car. Got a great SUV from economy and had seamless experience (except the mandatory 3rd party insurance)

Lowlights: 

1. Expensive: CR is darn expensive. Period! Anyone saying otherwise is just lying or delusional. Everything felt super expensive. Groceries, food, gasoline, clothes, activities, fees, telecom, etc. are crazy expensive. The only good part is drinkable tap water so you don’t have to buy separately. Perhaps the only 2 things that seemed cheap were bananas and coconut. 

2. Viewing points: Unfortunately, there are very few view points or lookouts where you can stop, enjoy nature or scenery for free and capture photos. My wife often complains that I turn a 2 hr journey into 4+ hrs due o hundreds of stops I make between point A & B. In CR, that was not the case

3. Roads: My goodness the roads are terrible. When I left India years ago, I thought I would never see that bad roads and here’s Costa Rica proving me wrong. There are major national highways which are awesome and as soon as you get off, the roads and pavements are just terrible. Navigating a stroller seemed like some kind of obstacle video game. Points 1-3 combined made me feel government there hasn’t done a good job! 

4. Wildlife: Not many people realize but a downside of having so much external wildlife means you will get some inside rooms as well 😛. We saw lizards, cockroaches, insects, ants, caterpillars, crickets in some rooms

5. Lack of free trails: It was insane to see how little CR has in terms of free things to do. I can go to any state or province in US and Canada and spend months checking out some stunningly beautiful spots and not spend even a cent (apart from gasoline and food). In CR, that wasn’t an option in major places except the ones with beaches

Overall, it was a fabulous and memorable trip. Seeing sloths, monkeys, toucans, macaws, tanagers, hummingbirds, spiders, snakes, frogs, cloud forests and insane amount of trees was just incredible. 

Most importantly, the CR trip changed my perspective on life. It made me more conscious of our beautiful planet and especially birds. In Canada where I live, we have ton of birds but after my CR trip, I am looking at them and noticing as well as reading about them more and more often. 

Will I recommend CR to anyone wanting a low cost budget trip? Hell, no!

I don't like fish, just straight up. I've tried many different fish many different times and I've liked 0% of it. Most of my issues are with texture, though.

That was the first text message I got that morning.

It came from an unknown number. No name. No emoji. No follow-up. Just those five words, all caps, like the sender was afraid of being overheard even through a phone.

For a few seconds, I sat up in bed, staring at the screen while my alarm continued to chirp beside me. The early light filtering through my blinds gave my room its usual harmless look: laundry on the chair, posters peeling at the corners, my backpack slumped against the wall. Everything normal. Everything safe.

I checked the time. 6:14 a.m.

I laughed, one sharp breath through my nose.

A prank.

Spam.

It was just someone messing with me. My friends thought it was funny to send creepy stuff sometimes, especially before exams.

Still, my thumb hovered over the keyboard longer than it should have.

*Who the fuck is this?* I typed.

The message showed as delivered. No response.

I tossed the phone onto my bed and stood up, stretching. I had school. A math test. A bus to catch. The real world didn’t pause for anonymous texts.

As I brushed my teeth, I kept glancing at my reflection, half-expecting to see something different. Someone standing behind me. A shadow that didn’t belong to me.

Nothing.

By the time I was dressed, the message had faded into the background noise of my mind—unsettling, but distant. I grabbed my phone again as I headed downstairs.

Another message had come in.

**They know you saw the first one.**

My stomach dropped so suddenly it felt like I’d missed a step on the stairs.

“Mom?” I called, my voice cracking in a way I didn’t like.

“In the kitchen,” she answered, cheerful, unaware.

I stood frozen halfway down the stairs, staring at the screen. My phone buzzed again.

**You have three minutes.**

“Three minutes for what?” I whispered.

I typed again, hands shaking now. *Who are they?*

The response came instantly.

**Not who. What.**

A chill crept up my arms. I suddenly became aware of every sound in the house: the hum of the refrigerator, the tick of the clock, my mom humming softly to herself.

I went into the kitchen, trying to act normal. My mom slid a plate of toast toward me.

“You look pale,” she said. “Did you sleep?”

“Yeah,” I lied.

My phone buzzed on the counter.

**Two minutes.**

I swallowed hard. “Mom… did you get any weird messages this morning?”

She frowned. “No. Why?”

Another buzz.

**They’re closer than you think.**

My chest tightened. “I—I think someone’s messing with me.”

My mom sighed, already reaching for her coffee.

“Sweetheart, if it’s a prank, ignore it. You’ll miss your bus.”

The phone vibrated again.

**One minute.**

I felt lightheaded. “Mom, I think we should—”

The lights flickered.

Just once. Quick. Like a blink.

My mom looked up. “Probably the storm last night.”

The phone buzzed again.

**Thirty seconds. Closet. Bathroom. Anywhere without windows. Do NOT be seen.**

My heart slammed against my ribs. This was too specific. Too urgent.

I grabbed my phone and backed away from the counter.

“Mom, please, we need to go somewhere else in the house.”

She stared at me, confused now. “What’s going on?”

The lights flickered again—longer this time.

My phone buzzed.

**They’re here.**

A sound came from outside.

Not a knock.

Not footsteps.

A low, dragging scrape, like something heavy being pulled across concrete.

My mom turned toward the front door.

“Did someone—”

“Don’t open it,” I said, louder than I meant to.

She froze. “What?”

The scrape came again. Closer. Accompanied by something else now—a faint clicking, irregular, like nails tapping out of sync.

My phone buzzed nonstop, messages stacking faster than I could read.

**DO NOT LET THEM SEE YOU**

**THEY MIMIC**

The Blood in the Cedar.
Part I — Arrival

The rain hadn’t stopped for three days. It came down steady and fine, a curtain of gray that blurred the forest and left the manor smelling faintly of wet iron.

I arrived at the Wenton Manor late that evening, the cedar trees looming like dark sentinels. The house itself was immense, Victorian in design but somehow older, as if its walls had grown around themselves over centuries. I was there to catalog the estate before it was sold, the last in the Wenton bloodline.

George, the caretaker, greeted me at the front door. He was polite, slow-moving, and unsettlingly calm. He had worked here for decades—or so it seemed—and somehow, he knew everything about the manor without ever seeming to think about it.

“Welcome,” he said, smiling faintly. “You must be the last. That makes things… interesting.”


---

Part II — The Manor

The first days were uneventful, though the house seemed alive in subtle ways: doors I remembered locking were occasionally ajar, footsteps echoed in empty hallways, and the smell of cedar mixed with something iron-rich and sweet lingered in the air.

George’s behavior was odd but casual. One morning, he mentioned casually, “Sometimes the branches were people,” as he cleaned an old hunting knife. When I asked him to clarify, he just shrugged and poured me coffee.

In the library, I discovered the journals of generations of Wentons. They spoke of “weakening blood,” “the root’s hunger,” and incidents too strange to fully grasp. One entry from 1921 read:

> “The sickness took Elara after she bore the twins. The doctor said fever, but I saw the truth. She had looked into the roots, and they had looked back. I buried her where the cedar bleeds.”



Another, from 1943:

> “Jonas hears the voices now. I told him not to feed them, but he took the calf down there anyway. The soil drank too fast. The ground shook all night.”



The consistency of the phrases—down there—led me to explore the manor’s hidden underworld.


---

Part III — The Roots Beneath the Manor

I discovered a hidden entrance behind the boiler. The tunnel descended steeply, walls rough-cut stone. The air grew colder and damp as I moved deeper, until the passage opened into a cavern lined with hanging roots.

A circular pit sat in the center, lined with cedar planks carved with looping symbols. A table nearby held defaced family photographs. At the bottom of the pile, I found a picture of my mother as a child with George, both appearing around ten years old. On the back was penciled:

“Lydia and her brother, 1965.”

The implication was staggering—I had no memory of a brother.

George explained the graveyard behind the cedar grove matter-of-factly. “The Wentons didn’t believe in cemeteries. They liked to keep their dead close. Easier to hear them that way.”

By night, the walls of the manor seemed to pulse. Whispers drifted through the halls:

Remember us. Remember yourself.


---

Part IV — The Awakening

The manor became oppressive. Doors narrowed, lights flickered, and the smell of cedar and iron thickened. George, ever nonchalant, remarked, “I always wondered how long it takes the walls to get used to new blood… some families, only one.”

I spent hours in the tunnels. The journals described generations of “feeding” rituals, sometimes involving children. The language blurred between superstition and confession, leaving me horrified yet compelled to continue.

George’s casual remarks became increasingly disturbing:

“You know, they say the roots like to watch the living eat the past. Makes for better growth.”

One evening he led me to a clearing where the family had performed ceremonies. “Not like the ones in the journals,” he said. “Worse. People remember some things… some they don’t.”

The house seemed to pulse with life around me. Floors creaked without footsteps; shadows darted where none should. One night, the piano played by itself—a haunting lullaby I felt rather than heard.

I confronted George.

“You’ve participated in this,” I said, voice shaking.

“Everyone participates in some way,” he replied casually. “Some just get to do it more casually than others.”

That night, whispers threaded through the walls:

Do you remember us?
The blood remembers.
You cannot leave.

I realized the manor was aware. It had been waiting for me—the last heir—to awaken its hidden legacy.


---

Part V — The Root’s Demand

When I descended into the tunnels again, the manor had changed. The hallways upstairs seemed narrower. The air was thick, humid, coppery. George knelt among the roots, tracing them with idle fingers.

“They’ve been waiting,” he said softly. “You’re late.”

The deeper I went, the roots thickened, twisting like veins in a colossal heart. The smell hit me—raw earth, iron, decay, something alive beneath the roots. Then I saw the bodies.

Human forms fused with roots, skin stretched at impossible angles, limbs twisted in knots, faces hollow and bark-like, mouths slick with sap-like fluid. Whispers filled my skull, repeating in a language I felt in my bones:

“We are the roots. We are the blood. We are waiting.”

George brushed a fused arm casually. “Your family always wanted to know how deep the blood runs.”

I staggered. My veins pulsed, hot and urgent. The roots reached for me, curling like fingers, pulling at my skin. The walls groaned, dripping with sap and something darker—a smell that made bile rise.

Among the mass, I recognized my mother’s face. Her eyes were gone, replaced with root fibers. She whispered:

“You came. We’ve been waiting.”

George knelt beside me. “It is done. You cannot leave. Not yet. Not until the blood has remembered itself.”

The roots surged. My flesh folded, merging with centuries of Wenton bloodline. I saw every act, every ritual, every horror. My body was no longer mine. The roots whispered into every cell:

“We are the blood. We are the roots. You are home.”

I vomited bile, earth, and copper. The world above—the fog, the cedar grove, the manor—faded into darkness as the roots consumed, claimed, and reshaped me.


---

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

**Keytom**  
Lean nomad tool: personal EUR IBAN + crypto wallets in one app, quick swaps (fees upfront), free SEPA Instant to local banks, virtual card for instant POS/Apple Pay.

**Trastra**  
Card-first vibe: load crypto to EUR IBAN account, grab Visa (Apple/Google Pay ready), use for global spends/ATMs. Feels like a standard euro debit card funded by your gigs, but watch fixed fees on frequent small ATM pulls or FX abroad—better if you're swiping more than wiring.

Keytom wins for fast, minimal bridges across borders (EEA focus); Trastra for ""just works like my home card"" familiarity. Both KYC/EEA-heavy—test your current country's fit.

1pyuq8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1pyuq8y/realization_hits_hard/,Realization hits hard,"I thought I knew you because I knew your routines, your stories, your laughter. I knew the small details—how you took your coffee, what songs you skipped. I confused closeness with understanding.

It wasn’t until the relationship ended that clarity arrived, slowly and without mercy.
What hurt first was the silence. How easily communication disappeared. One moment we had something that felt fluid, open, alive—and then I was met with distance and unresponsiveness. No explanation, no real goodbye. Just absence. I spent a long time trying to understand how something that once felt mutual could be abandoned so quietly, and how invisible that made me feel.

What hurt even more was how, before the silence, I was made to feel small. Moments where I felt humiliated—spoken down to, dismissed, or exposed emotionally—and then somehow left carrying the guilt for reacting to it. I began apologizing for pain I didn’t cause, questioning my intentions, wondering how I had become the problem for simply wanting honesty and respect. It took time to realize how deeply that shifted my sense of self.

The truth is, my love for you was strong. Strong enough that it softened things I should have paid attention to. Strong enough that I explained away behavior that hurt me, convinced myself it was temporary, misunderstood, or somehow my fault. Love has a way of blinding you—not because you’re weak, but because you’re hoping the best version of someone will eventually win.
With time, other realizations followed.

I began to see how important control was to you—how unsettling it felt for you to lose it. How the end of our relationship didn’t just mean letting go, but seemed to require rearranging other people’s lives too, as if stability only existed when things unfolded exactly your way.

I noticed how difficult it was for you to truly consider others when their needs conflicted with your own. How people were kept close when they aligned, and pushed away when they didn’t. Not out of open cruelty—but out of an inability to sit with discomfort that wasn’t centered on you.

Some of the hardest things to reconcile were the moments when empathy seemed absent altogether. The way certain people—those with mental disabilities, physical differences—were spoken about without kindness. The words directed toward family members when frustration turned into something much darker. I remember feeling unsettled even then, but not fully understanding why.

There were people in your life who showed up for you in real ways—who offered patience, loyalty, forgiveness. And I don’t think you were incapable of seeing that. I think you just didn’t know how to hold it without feeling threatened by it.
I don’t write this with anger. I write it with honesty.

Now that I’m on the outside, things are clearer. Distance has a way of sharpening the picture. The silence, the control, the humiliation, the misplaced guilt—they aren’t isolated moments anymore. They’re patterns. And I understand now that things had to end the way they did, because it was the only way I could step far enough back to truly see what was happening while I was still standing inside it.

Some endings don’t come with closure.
They come with clarity.

And sometimes clarity is realizing that love wasn’t the mistake—

Zero-Type Entry: Snap a photo of a messy receipt. The AI doesn’t just ""read"" it; it extracts the merchant, tax, and individual line items automatically.

Voice-to-Budget: You can literally tell the app, ""I just spent $45 on gas,"" and it logs it in the right bucket before you even put your keys away.

Chat-to-Log feature. You literally just type:
• ""Coffee 5"" * ""Groceries 85.50""
• ""Gas 40 at Shell""

• Auto-Categorization: It actually learns your habits instead of just guessing.
• Privacy First: No selling your data to third parties. Period.
• Clean UI: No clutter, just the numbers you need to see.
•One-tap logging (or auto-sync).
• Smart Insights: Tells you where you’re overspending before the month ends.
• Custom Tags: Organize your money your way.

My father is 84 and has early-stage dementia. He is followed regularly at the AZ ADRC for monitoring and medication. My mother is 82, cognitively healthy, and currently his full-time caregiver. They live in Peoria, AZ. I live in San Diego, and my sister lives in Chicago.

My mom is really struggling in the caregiver role. She is often frustrated and upset with my dad and, frankly, does not want to be his caregiver. This is a huge shift in their dynamic - my dad was very intelligent, handled finances, household matters, travel planning, etc. Now he has poor mobility, declining overall health, refuses to use mobility aids, needs help some ADLs. My Mom is constantly frustrated that his short term memory is gone, he can't do either complex (pay bills) or simple things (make coffee) he used to. 

They are not low-income and do have financial resources, but I’m unsure how to identify appropriate support.

The areas where I think help would make the biggest difference:

1. A professional home assessment — someone who can review their living situation and offer concrete guidance to reduce my mom’s burden (e.g., medication management strategies, simplifying tasks so my dad can still do some things independently, fall-risk reduction, mobility support).
2. In-home support — part-time care to give my mom a break, assist with light housekeeping, and help my dad with ADLs.

I’ve suggested caregiver support groups and ways to improve day-to-day management, but it’s difficult coming from me as her daughter. She also does not drive, which limits access to outside resources. I really think outside guidance, especially from a professional rather than family, would help both of them.

Additional context: they have a will and living trust, a financial advisor, and appropriate legal planning in place. My mom has power of attorney, with my sister as backup. My sister and I each visit 2–3 times per year, but in between visits, they both seem deeply unhappy and isolated. My mom is not very social and doesn’t currently have hobbies outside the home, though they do see one other couple occasionally and she stays in touch with family by phone.

If anyone has experience with geriatric care managers, home health agencies, occupational therapy home assessments, or other resources in Arizona, I’d be very grateful for recommendations or advice on where to begin. I have also reached out to the AZ agency on aging.

I forgave her of this debt once I’ve realized she was getting much better with money and we haven’t been in the situation since. we both make basically the same amount of money (which isn’t much because we’re college students but both work full-time). I have a lot more savings than her because she was irresponsible, but is slowly building up. I have been proud of her and her progress because we now have a decent amount of expendable income after paying bills and rent. It is very important to note that we do not have combined finances. We have no combine bank accounts or anything like that. I decided to keep them separate because of her past with money and was worried if she got a hold of my expendable income, she would spend it like she used to because she now has more money since I spend less than her overall. we will probably combine finances after we’re done with school and have higher income jobs. 

So to the problem. The other day I was going through her wallet to find a card I needed and noticed she had five credit cards (not including her debit card). I knew about one of them, but not the other four. I was shocked because I had no idea she opened them. For example, I knew she had a Chase credit card, but she also had a Mastercard, a Dave credit card (a company that “spots you money” that u have to pay back but the interest isn’t great), a Venmo credit card and another one I can’t remember the company for. I was just confused why she never told me about opening them. i’m not sure if she is in debt or pays them off monthly. I know she pays off her Chase card monthly but I don’t know about the other ones. She told me she opened the Chase one to get points and improve her credit score which is fair but all these other ones seem excessive if that’s the goal. I do not have any credit cards, just a debit card and have good credit. now I am worried her credit is bad because of all these cards and this is a big deal to me because obviously as a married couple, it affects us both when we finally can get a house. The reason I am anxious to confront her about this is because money has been the cause of many fights throughout our relationship and I don’t wanna start more drama. I also don’t want her to lie to me if she says her credit is good and she pays them off every month because she could easily say that, even if it’s not the case, and I think asking her to show me all the accounts is excessive and she will get her feelings hurt that I don’t trust her. I’m not sure what to do. I don’t wanna start a fight. I don’t want her to think I don’t trust her and since our finances are separate, it doesn’t necessarily affect me right now. But I feel like this is something important your spouse should know, especially if she has debt on some of the cards. it wouldn’t be a large amount of debt, like in the thousands, maybe just a hundred or so on each I’m guessing. I don’t know where her money is going because we both make the same amount of money and split rent, bills, groceries, etc evenly. she uses much more in gas than me because her job is a lot further than mine, but that’s really the only difference I can see. We even go back and forth paying for food out and other extra fun things like that so that’s pretty proportional. she used to have an online shopping problem, but I haven’t noticed any extra packages being sent anymore. Maybe she is getting lunch at work that I don’t know about or coffee before work everyday. she has mentioned buying lunch for all her coworkers multiple times and says they pay her back but I’m not really sure now. I honestly have no idea how her money is gone to the point where she needs to have credit cards to charge things on/spit her money. what do you guys think I should do?

1pyug0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pyug0t/aitah_for_telling_my_best_friend_her_fiancé_is/,AITAH for telling my best friend her fiancé is manipulating her,"Hi. Me (26F) and my friend (27F), let's call her Lucy, are friends since high school. So more than 10 years. We were always talking about everything including our boyfriends. About 2,5 years ago she met her now fiancé (40), let's call him Larry. She was really happy and even though he is 13 years older than her, I was happy for her. Until she told me more about him and I met him.

He was never married, still lives in his room with parents (this alone wouldn't be and issue but if you will read further you will understand) and has many debts (he insist his ex-girlfriend made them and he is inocent, but in my country you cannot take a loan in someone elses name, he had to take the loan himself even if it was for his ex). He works as an orderly in hospital, my friend works there too as a cleaner and sometimes help with moving patients. They met there. 

I used to call with her around 3 times a week and she was always talkative, cheerful, happy and we were basicly talking about everything. But after few months every time we were talking she put the phone on speaker and Larry talk with me too. I wasn't really happy about it but if she was okay with it... What made me worry was, that when she was talking with Larry around, she didn't talk too much, wasn't laughing, it was like she was scared she will say something wrong. 

About half year after they met, we (me and Lucy) decided that we will meet in shoping center, grab some coffee and just have a nice afternoon together. She came with Larry. He said that he had to make sure that she is meeting with me and not some boy. She laughed but Larry seemed to be serious. He even looked around if I am alone. Then he gave us space but stayrd at the shopping center. I asked if he was serious and she laughed and said that it's cute that he is jelaus. Girl, what I saw wasn't cute. 

She also used to go and see me at work (jewellery shop) when she was near. In summer this year she came with Larry. She lost one of her earrings and wanted too buy sime new, so I showed her. And I showed her also some rings. Larry talked in everything and wanted her to choose what he likes, he didn't listen to what she wants. She didn't buy anything and was sad, she didn't want to buy something he didn't like. I told her that she can come any time and I will send her photos of some earrings and rings in advance so she can have time to choose. Fast forward to end of the summer, she came. Alone. She bought earring and tried some ring that she liked (by the way, none of it was something that Larry liked). She also told me, that he and Larry are triyng for a baby. She always wanted a baby, but my god, with Larry? At that time they lived together in his childhood room and their income was just enough to make it to the next paycheck. She went to the doctor appointment and later came back. We talked some more, she told about his debts, about their living situation and how she wants a wedding and a baby and happy family. But she also told me something, that made me really scared. She told me that Larry comes to her every break at work, take her to and from the work (even when he doesn't have shift that day), is always with her, usually goes to see doctors with her and basicly is always around. She also told me that he thinks that she is talking too much, laughing too lound and acting crazy. We talked for a long time. I cannot write everything but from what I saw and from what she told me I believed that he is not just jelaus but he is trying to control and manipulate her. I didn't want to tell her and break her heart. But about a week later he came to my work. Without Lucy. He wanted to pop the question. I sold him the ring she liked and decided to acted. I met Lucy and told her what I think about Larry, what I saw. I didn't want to do it but I would be really bad friend if i didn't say anything. She cried and asked if I really think that. I told her that I do. That I trust her decisions but I don't trust him. After few minutes of crying she asked me if she can talk about our conversation with Larry. I told her that she can talk with him about anything she want but I don't want to talk with him. In the evening that day she send me a message and she said that Larry told her he is really manipulating her but ""only when she acts crazy"". So it is okay. I stared at that massage for a long time. He also poped the question and they are planning wedding. I am not invited. She also called me in fall. She is pregnant. They still live in Larrys childhood room and their income is just enough to two of them. I don't know how they wanna feed the baby or buy that baby clothes and diapers. I didn't talk to her since the last call and she didn't try to contact me. I propably ruined our friendship. AITAH for telling her what I think about Larry?",10,1767033949.0,AITAH,14,1.0,False

I currently get zero matches on hinge, bumble, and tinder. I assume I am either ugly or need to update my photos. 

I am currently in med school so I dont have time for full scale hobbies other having a couple's hours on a Saturday or Friday. Some people have said this in the past so I want to say that there are no women that I can date in med school or nurses. In fact, most women I know are engaged or in a serious LTR. As weird as it sounds, its very weird for a woman to be single in med school. Most will get married by 4th year similar to college actually. 

Also I dont have any female friends or counsins to set me up. I grew up as an only child so there are no familial connections to help me out. 

The biggest female connection I have is this girl in my class that I used to like. We somewhat keep in touch and I text her when i am bored lol. She is pretty sweet but she has a bf. And I am trying to not run her away by texting too often. So that is it. 

I dont really have alot of friends either. I have one strong male friend group who all retired players. They are all getting married and putting pressure on me to find someone since they can get women easily. I go out to bars with them sometimes on weekends but to be honest. I dont feel comfortable being so forwardly sexual like them. But they get away with alot and it amazing me how much they can do. 

  
So here are the things that I have not tried yet:

I have yet to go up to women and truly cold approach. I have talked to women in coffee shops before and I get warm convo. Heck, im trying to challenge myself to ask for this waitress name at this restaurant that I go to. Im too shy 

  
As much as I complain on reddit about being single, outside of my parents I rarely talk about it. I never once I have told anyone in my med school that I am looking for a gf nor my male friends. They know I want a gf because they asked and I told them sure. But I never complain and beg them to take me out to bars. My female associate friend doesnt know either because I always talk about school with her. And I told her that I can get a woman if I tried. Lol, she probably knowns but I dont ever admit to being lonely. 

In med school, I just go out and party. I rarely talk about women unless people bring it up. And sometimes people do and I just smile and change the subject. 

  
So what can I actually work on?

Currently, my husband is not speaking to me because I gave our autistic child medication for anixiety. We disagree on how to approach our son's condition, and despite he was against giving medication to our son, I I decided to give it to him for a few days because he was causing selfharm from stress. And yes, it helped him a great deal so I am not sorry. My son was not high, not drowsy, actualy no side effects, except he was not stressed and was able to recover a bit from a stresful period. It was so bad we needed to go to ER. So I stand by my decision.

But- and this is the topic: my husband is not speaking to me because of this, this whole week, since last Friday, complete ignore. He blocked me on phone messenger. He answers the phone just saying WHAT? He leaves the room if I enter.

He's always been nice to kids. I don't mind him as a father, just as a partner. I noticed he's rude to his mother (altough I am very different from her so don't know what parallel here would be), but he just seems rude to her and me, mostly me. 

But what stroke me was that I only realized this now - this is just an extreme of what it's always been like. I noticed it a few times, but did not realize how bad it is. I think it's what we call denial. 

When we searched for a place to move in together years ago, he wouldn't do it unless it was that one exact place he wanted. He wouldn't talk about it if it wasn't that one place. I suppose we could say even he wouldn't move in with me if it wasn't that one place, but I am only guessing.
He wouldn't talk/or agree to go unless it was his choice of holiday destination. 
He wouldn't help me pick a car unless it was his friends car that he wanted to buy. And there are many other examples like this, it happens all the time. No discussion, only silence. He will not have a conversation. 

He'd always answer the phone as if I am a burden, for years. If I ask him if he can be kinder on the phone he'd hang up. 
If I ask him if he wanted to go to a trip with me and the kids he won't answer. Complete silence. I've learnt it just means no. 
I am walking on eggshells if I want him to like me. 

He never takes me on a trip or for coffee. If he does anything nice for me I feel quilty for thinking he's the a*hole. The only place he went with me in the last 6 years was to a piano shop, and I thought oh my god, that is the nicest thing, I can't believe he came with me. It felt incredible, better than xmas. Honestly he didn't come for the company, he came to measure it because he had doubts it will fit, but still. 

Yes, I know how stupid I sound. I knew we were in a bad place for years but I thought hey it will be fine, look he was nicer to me this afternoon, it's gonna work out. I feel so incredibly stupid for only realizing today, he's been mistreating me since the begining. I feel increadibly dumb and ashamed of myself, but I was so in love with him I pretended it was fine. I am sure I annoyed him as wel. I can be stubborn and opinionated, and I am sure my reactions can be annoying to him (I have a bit of a temper but not towards him, in general I get easily stressed and annoyed with things, and he really doesn't like seing me expressing negative feelings), I am far from perfect. 

Obviously I suffer from bad selfesteem. I am autistic and I have severe difficulties reading people and their agendas. I have been bullied so severley in primary school, highschool, talked down by my parents, so I have no idea how you are supposed to be treated. But I know I was watching other couples going out in public for a cup of coffee, having a nice time,  hearing my friend having a normal, kind phone call with their spouse, and it always made me so sad. 

Please don't say counseling. This is not fixable. 
Obviously I need therapy. I've had therapies during this time, but I didn't realize what's really going on with me.

I am not asking for advice. You can't give me advice. I am so broken all I know is I need to leave and get some help to get some sence of self worth.
I don't know what I want from reddit even. I guess I just felt like writing it down to someone that doesn't know me personaly. I am too ashamed to admit this to anyone I know, how I allowed myself to be treated.  Obviously something is horribly wrong with me.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I am open to FaceTiming to see if we connect as well. But a B\*\*\*\* is lonely up here lol.

Surprising myself further, I couldn't even wait to get home: I put it on right there in the Walmart parking lot, in broad daylight. Pro'ly looked sus af doing it, though, looking around to see if anybody is watching like I'm doing drugs. (But kinda tho)

It's a subtle color that was kinda hard to see in the rearview mirror.

1pyu8p5,https://i.redd.it/76aelsytt6ag1.jpeg,"Balancing luxury staples with daily drivers. My recent pickups: Miu Miu, Asics, Canada Goose & more.","1. Miu Miu Arcadie Leather Bag (Brown)
The Vibe: Current ""It Girl"" aesthetic. Very trendy but classic silhouette. Review: Honestly, the leather grain here looks surprisingly buttery. The embossing on the ""MIU MIU"" logo has good depth—it’s not too shallow, which is a common flaw on these. The hardware gold tone looks subtle rather than that cheap, overly yellow gold. The structure seems to hold up well even when empty.

Pros: The packaging (box/dust bag) looks pristine. The color is a perfect neutral for fall/winter fits.

Cons: These bags are prone to scratching because the leather is soft. You have to baby it.

Rating: 9/10 – A heavy hitter. Looks expensive.

2. 6PM (Six PM) Black Hoodie
The Vibe: DACH region streetwear, oversized, heavy-weight comfort. Review: Standard 6PM aesthetic. The embroidery on the hood and chest looks tight—no connecting stitch flaws or loose threads visible from this distance. The contrast stitching is a nice touch, giving it that deconstructed look. The hood shape looks substantial (stiff enough to stand up), which is crucial for a hoodie at this price point.

Pros: Thick blank, likely high GSM. The embroidery detailing elevates it above a basic black hoodie.

Cons: 6PM sizing can be weird (often very boxy/cropped). If you didn't size correctly, it might sit too short on the waist.

Rating: 7.5/10 – Solid daily driver, but fit is everything here.

3. Grey Graphic Zip-Up (Unknown Brand/Y2K Style)
The Vibe: Y2K revival, opium-adjacent, slouchy fit. Review: Looks like a soft cotton blend. The 3D puff print/embroidery across the chest is bold. The grey tone is versatile. However, the zipper hardware is the make-or-break factor here; if it waves or bubbles when you sit down, it ruins the silhouette. The cuffs look a bit loose/relaxed, which fits the style but might stretch out over time.

Pros: Very comfortable looking. The embroidery design is clean and centered.

Cons: The zipper track looks a little flimsy. Light grey stains easily.

Rating: 6.5/10 – Cool piece for lounging or layering, but durability is a question mark.

4. Canada Goose Freestyle Vest (White)
The Vibe: Winter luxury, functional, ""clean girl/guy"" aesthetic. Review: This is a bold choice. White Canada Goose gear is notoriously hard to keep clean, but it looks the best when it is clean. The badge looks solid—the leaves look distinct and the font spacing is decent (common tell on bad ones). The puffiness (down fill) looks adequate, though it could be a bit loftier in the collar area.

Pros: The badge placement is correct. It’s an insane flex piece for layering over hoodies.

Cons: Immediate anxiety about getting it dirty. The collar looks slightly deflated in the photo (might just need to be fluffed in the dryer).

Rating: 8/10 – Looks fire, just don't spill coffee on it.

5. Asics Gel-Kayano 14 (Silver/Blue)
The Vibe: Tech-runner, dad-shoe, JJJJound aesthetic (without the markup). Review: These are arguably the best sneaker silhouette of the last year. The mesh quality looks breathable and the metallic overlays are cutting cleanly (no jagged edges). The glue work around the midsole looks clean, which is rare even for retail pairs lately. The colorway is extremely wearable.

Pros: Insane comfort (Gel tech). Matches literally everything (jeans, sweats, cargos).

Cons: The mesh toebox is fragile; watch out for toe poking through after heavy wear.

Rating: 9.5/10 – Near perfect sneaker. Essential rotation piece.

6. Burberry Classic Check Scarf
The Vibe: Old money, heritage luxury, safe gift. Review: You can't go wrong with the classic check. The tassels/fringing look neat and unfrayed. The crucial thing with these is the alignment of the pattern—the black and red lines seem to intersect symmetrically, which is good. The packaging is nice, but the scarf itself is what matters. If this is cashmere, it's a win; if it's wool, it might be itchy.

Pros: Timeless. Never goes out of style. Keeps value well.

Cons: Everyone has one (or a dupe of one). It’s a bit ""safe"" compared to the rest of the haul.

On weekends, if I don't set an alarm, I will sleep for 12+ hours with my husband usually waking me by the time it hits noon if I'm not awake yet. We joke that it's my weekly coma. My body does not wake up without an alarm. 

I kind of thought this was just catching up on sleep from the week (although I'm not in a sleep deficit), but taking two weeks off for winter break, I am still able to sleep 12-14 hours every day. I feel well rested after this, but again, if I don't set an alarm, I just won't wake up, and I'm wasting half a day. Does anyone have advice or ideas what could be going on?

The Vibe: Y2K revival, opium-adjacent, slouchy fit. Review: Looks like a soft cotton blend. The 3D puff print/embroidery across the chest is bold. The grey tone is versatile. However, the zipper hardware is the make-or-break factor here; if it waves or bubbles when you sit down, it ruins the silhouette. The cuffs look a bit loose/relaxed, which fits the style but might stretch out over time.

Pros: Very comfortable looking. The embroidery design is clean and centered.

Cons: The zipper track looks a little flimsy. Light grey stains easily.

Rating: 6.5/10 – Cool piece for lounging or layering, but durability is a question mark.

4. Canada Goose Freestyle Vest (White)
The Vibe: Winter luxury, functional, ""clean girl/guy"" aesthetic. Review: This is a bold choice. White Canada Goose gear is notoriously hard to keep clean, but it looks the best when it is clean. The badge looks solid—the leaves look distinct and the font spacing is decent (common tell on bad ones). The puffiness (down fill) looks adequate, though it could be a bit loftier in the collar area.

Pros: The badge placement is correct. It’s an insane flex piece for layering over hoodies.

Cons: Immediate anxiety about getting it dirty. The collar looks slightly deflated in the photo (might just need to be fluffed in the dryer).

Rating: 8/10 – Looks fire, just don't spill coffee on it.

5. Asics Gel-Kayano 14 (Silver/Blue)
The Vibe: Tech-runner, dad-shoe, JJJJound aesthetic (without the markup). Review: These are arguably the best sneaker silhouette of the last year. The mesh quality looks breathable and the metallic overlays are cutting cleanly (no jagged edges). The glue work around the midsole looks clean, which is rare even for retail pairs lately. The colorway is extremely wearable.

Pros: Insane comfort (Gel tech). Matches literally everything (jeans, sweats, cargos).

Cons: The mesh toebox is fragile; watch out for toe poking through after heavy wear.

Rating: 9.5/10 – Near perfect sneaker. Essential rotation piece.

6. Burberry Classic Check Scarf
The Vibe: Old money, heritage luxury, safe gift. Review: You can't go wrong with the classic check. The tassels/fringing look neat and unfrayed. The crucial thing with these is the alignment of the pattern—the black and red lines seem to intersect symmetrically, which is good. The packaging is nice, but the scarf itself is what matters. If this is cashmere, it's a win; if it's wool, it might be itchy.

Pros: Timeless. Never goes out of style. Keeps value well.

Cons: Everyone has one (or a dupe of one). It’s a bit ""safe"" compared to the rest of the haul.

1pyu38i,https://i.redd.it/c93gwhkts6ag1.jpeg,"Balancing luxury staples with daily drivers. My recent pickups: Miu Miu, Asics, Canada Goose & more.","1. Miu Miu Arcadie Leather Bag (Brown)
The Vibe: Current ""It Girl"" aesthetic. Very trendy but classic silhouette. Review: Honestly, the leather grain here looks surprisingly buttery. The embossing on the ""MIU MIU"" logo has good depth—it’s not too shallow, which is a common flaw on these. The hardware gold tone looks subtle rather than that cheap, overly yellow gold. The structure seems to hold up well even when empty.

Pros: The packaging (box/dust bag) looks pristine. The color is a perfect neutral for fall/winter fits.

Cons: These bags are prone to scratching because the leather is soft. You have to baby it.

Rating: 9/10 – A heavy hitter. Looks expensive.

2. 6PM (Six PM) Black Hoodie
The Vibe: DACH region streetwear, oversized, heavy-weight comfort. Review: Standard 6PM aesthetic. The embroidery on the hood and chest looks tight—no connecting stitch flaws or loose threads visible from this distance. The contrast stitching is a nice touch, giving it that deconstructed look. The hood shape looks substantial (stiff enough to stand up), which is crucial for a hoodie at this price point.

Pros: Thick blank, likely high GSM. The embroidery detailing elevates it above a basic black hoodie.

Cons: 6PM sizing can be weird (often very boxy/cropped). If you didn't size correctly, it might sit too short on the waist.

Rating: 7.5/10 – Solid daily driver, but fit is everything here.

This is a little different from the sort of stuff that usually gets posted here, I hope it’s okay. 

  
I was wondering if else here ever uses alcohol to help stay awake. I am NOT recommending it. But, it was sort of my main strategy for about a decade. I’m five months sober now, and have a sleep study consultation scheduled for this February. My symptoms match up with IH, I just put the sleep study off for years because I knew the first thing the doctors would tell me was to quit drinking, and I wasn’t ready. 

  
After talking to lots of fellow sober people about it, it sounds like using alcohol as a method of staying awake is…not super common. I’m definitely glad I quit, but honestly, the one and only reason I still yearn for it is because it was the one single thing that would give me anything close to the sort of energy boost that a normal person seemingly gets from a cup of coffee. 

  
I guess all I want to know is, has anyone with a diagnosis had a similar experience? This is maybe the only weird thing my body does that I’ve yet to hear another person say “yes, I experience that too”. ",2,1767032983.0,idiopathichypersomnia,3,1.0,False

My manager, who was also there, came and tapped me on the shoulder.

I thought I was in the way of the coffee machine or something, so I moved. But he got closer and said in a low voice, ""That's not a professional look,"" and then walked away. I was literally speechless. Thankfully the line moved and I could grab my food and get out of there.

This manager has always been big on optics, but this is a whole new level. I'm honestly just waiting for the company-wide email about a new phone policy to drop any minute now. Look, I get not being glued to your phone at your desk 24/7. But we're developers, we solve problems.

1pytybp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pytybp,"Balancing luxury staples with daily drivers. My recent pickups: Miu Miu, Asics, Canada Goose & more.","1. Miu Miu Arcadie Leather Bag (Brown)
The Vibe: Current ""It Girl"" aesthetic. Very trendy but classic silhouette. Review: Honestly, the leather grain here looks surprisingly buttery. The embossing on the ""MIU MIU"" logo has good depth—it’s not too shallow, which is a common flaw on these. The hardware gold tone looks subtle rather than that cheap, overly yellow gold. The structure seems to hold up well even when empty.

Pros: The packaging (box/dust bag) looks pristine. The color is a perfect neutral for fall/winter fits.

Cons: These bags are prone to scratching because the leather is soft. You have to baby it.

Rating: 9/10 – A heavy hitter. Looks expensive.

2. 6PM (Six PM) Black Hoodie
The Vibe: DACH region streetwear, oversized, heavy-weight comfort. Review: Standard 6PM aesthetic. The embroidery on the hood and chest looks tight—no connecting stitch flaws or loose threads visible from this distance. The contrast stitching is a nice touch, giving it that deconstructed look. The hood shape looks substantial (stiff enough to stand up), which is crucial for a hoodie at this price point.

Pros: Thick blank, likely high GSM. The embroidery detailing elevates it above a basic black hoodie.

Cons: 6PM sizing can be weird (often very boxy/cropped). If you didn't size correctly, it might sit too short on the waist.

Rating: 7.5/10 – Solid daily driver, but fit is everything here.

3. Grey Graphic Zip-Up (Unknown Brand/Y2K Style)
The Vibe: Y2K revival, opium-adjacent, slouchy fit. Review: Looks like a soft cotton blend. The 3D puff print/embroidery across the chest is bold. The grey tone is versatile. However, the zipper hardware is the make-or-break factor here; if it waves or bubbles when you sit down, it ruins the silhouette. The cuffs look a bit loose/relaxed, which fits the style but might stretch out over time.

Pros: Very comfortable looking. The embroidery design is clean and centered.

Cons: The zipper track looks a little flimsy. Light grey stains easily.

Rating: 6.5/10 – Cool piece for lounging or layering, but durability is a question mark.

4. Canada Goose Freestyle Vest (White)
The Vibe: Winter luxury, functional, ""clean girl/guy"" aesthetic. Review: This is a bold choice. White Canada Goose gear is notoriously hard to keep clean, but it looks the best when it is clean. The badge looks solid—the leaves look distinct and the font spacing is decent (common tell on bad ones). The puffiness (down fill) looks adequate, though it could be a bit loftier in the collar area.

Pros: The badge placement is correct. It’s an insane flex piece for layering over hoodies.

Cons: Immediate anxiety about getting it dirty. The collar looks slightly deflated in the photo (might just need to be fluffed in the dryer).

Rating: 8/10 – Looks fire, just don't spill coffee on it.

5. Asics Gel-Kayano 14 (Silver/Blue)
The Vibe: Tech-runner, dad-shoe, JJJJound aesthetic (without the markup). Review: These are arguably the best sneaker silhouette of the last year. The mesh quality looks breathable and the metallic overlays are cutting cleanly (no jagged edges). The glue work around the midsole looks clean, which is rare even for retail pairs lately. The colorway is extremely wearable.

Pros: Insane comfort (Gel tech). Matches literally everything (jeans, sweats, cargos).

Cons: The mesh toebox is fragile; watch out for toe poking through after heavy wear.

Rating: 9.5/10 – Near perfect sneaker. Essential rotation piece.

6. Burberry Classic Check Scarf
The Vibe: Old money, heritage luxury, safe gift. Review: You can't go wrong with the classic check. The tassels/fringing look neat and unfrayed. The crucial thing with these is the alignment of the pattern—the black and red lines seem to intersect symmetrically, which is good. The packaging is nice, but the scarf itself is what matters. If this is cashmere, it's a win; if it's wool, it might be itchy.

Pros: Timeless. Never goes out of style. Keeps value well.

Cons: Everyone has one (or a dupe of one). It’s a bit ""safe"" compared to the rest of the haul.

1pytwfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pytwfa/28m_and_35f_aita/,28M and 35F - AITA,"35F wants me to delete all women (mostly high school friends and work colleagues) from my Instagram, stating “ who are these whores on your Instagram that keep coming up on my recommended “. She says she deleted all men for me, even though I never asked her to. I care about her, but the request makes me feel pressured and uneasy about trust and control. I don’t want resentment to build or for social media to become a constant issue. How can I communicate boundaries and expectations in a calm, healthy way? I want to handle this respectfully without dismissing her feelings or giving up mine.

We have been together for 3 years. We met whilst I was in my final year of medical school whilst I was working part time as a caretaker in the hospital I was doing my placement at. She was also working as a caretaker and we hit it off. A year later, she came to my graduation and the months following that, we moved in together. We’ve been living together for the last two years. We’ve met each other’s parents and families. We have two Chihuahuas. I have paid all bills since we have moved into this home, including rent, gas, electric, council tax, water and groceries. I paid for all of the furniture, including a couch, dining table, TVs, rugs, beds etc.. I make around 50k a year, and despite her working a part-time job, she doesn’t contribute.

I am conflicted, because I feel like I am going above and beyond for her, though but now am made to feel like I’m doing something wrong. However, I also feel like I contributed significantly to this:

\- She came to my work place once to get a coffee, and two female doctor colleagues had smiled at me and said “ Hello Dr X “and when she questioned me on who they were, I said I didn’t know. I genuinely could not remember who they were because I’ve met such a large number of doctors in a short period of time, yet she didn’t believe me.

\- I recall going to a local pub/bar with her and her father, and a woman went up to my partner and said “ You’ve got a good man “, which triggered her and had both her and her father questioning me on how I know this woman. I explained, I go to the bar sometimes to have a quiet drink and unwind, the bartender knows me for sitting in a corner and having a quiet drink and watching music videos on my phone with my headphones in. I do not interact with others in the bar, hence why I don’t know her nor know how she knows me. Again, this raised suspicion.

\- A year after we lived together, a married female friend from school had messaged me on Instagram asking questions about her pregnancy and some abdominal pain she was having. I was messaging her back and fourth taking a thorough history and screening for red flags and ultimately advised she should go to the hospital to get checked out. My partner said I should’ve not spoken to her as I’m in a relationship, and she is married, and instead should have directed her to her own doctor in the first instance.

\- About a year ago, I hosted her younger brother at my home. Her younger brother has me on Instagram, and had asked why I have so many women on Instagram. Of my 500 followers at the time, I’d say only about 150 were women. My partner then brought it up after her brother had left, and I became so frustrated that I ended up just outright deleting all the women on my Instagram. Fast forward to this week, I decided to re-add the women who I knew from school and work colleagues who came up on my suggestions, as I wanted to start making doctor “shorts” style videos, and thought the more reach I had, the better. This is what led to her saying “ who are all these whores on your Instagram “…

Some additional context, about a week ago, I went to her work place for a Christmas dinner, and noticed her chatting to two males (one approximately 30, and the other an older male approximately in his 50s). The older male had hugged her upon meeting her, and she spent the majority of her time speaking to him. We were drinking, and during one of the conversations, he had called her a minx (flirtatious young female). I pulled her up on this, and she said if you had a problem with him, why didn’t you say anything to him. I explained that you have made me feel like I can’t even interact with women without meeting a barrage of anger and accusations, and here you are chatting away through the night with a man old enough to be your father, and allowing him to call you a minx without setting clear boundaries. She states that the man is old enough to be her father. I explained that it is moreso the double standard that you have set for me which is why it made me feel uneasy, and I didn’t say anything because I wanted to see how far you two would go. She re-iterated that he is an old man, who is old enough to be her father, and I explained again that this is not the point I’m making, it’s moreso the double standard and I don’t feel threatened by this older man speaking to you. I got angry at one point towards the end of the night, and told her to just shut the fuck up. This occurred on a Friday night. On the following Monday, at the leisure centre where she works, she told me that this older man, who doesn’t go to the leisure’s centre on Mondays or in the mornings, came in specifically to check on her and wanted to make sure that I wasn’t abusing her because of how moody I was and because I told her to just shut the fuck up. I was extremely frustrated, hence the comment I made. I now feel like I’m seen as an abuser.

I am very conflicted, confused, and worried. This older work colleague now thinks I’m an abusive partner. I don’t think I’m an abusive partner but I very well may be without realising it. I know I shouldn’t have told her to shut the fuck up, and that’s unbecoming of a man, and it was a mistake, but maybe this interaction was a microcosm of how I have been treating her subconsciously through my behaviour. I have generally been very frustrated with her in the past, as I was working 40-84 hour weeks whilst she was unemployed for months, and I would come home to a dirty, messy home. I’m not at all saying her role as a woman should be to clean the house, as if the roles were reversed and I was unemployed and she was working, I would ensure the house is in order! I’m trying to build a family and a home, surely this is a fundamental mutual underlying unspoken understanding… I don’t know. I’m not sure. I’m just very much confused.

TLDR: is she being unreasonable, is she controlling, am I being unreasonable, what should I do? What can I do better?

Edit: both our names are on the tenancy agreement. I can’t ask her to leave because of this. She will not leave which means I will have to leave. I don’t make a lot of money, and I’ve spent a lot of money on the place we’re renting in terms of furniture, appliances, an office I built. If I leave, she can’t afford to pay the bills and she said I’m being financially manipulative because I said I’m leaving despite knowing she can’t afford to pay the bills. She can’t leave because she has nowhere to go. I feel so conflicted and I can’t see a way out. I feel trapped in my own life",3,1767032748.0,AITAH,11,1.0,False

Pros: The packaging (box/dust bag) looks pristine. The color is a perfect neutral for fall/winter fits.

Cons: These bags are prone to scratching because the leather is soft. You have to baby it.

Rating: 9/10 – A heavy hitter. Looks expensive.

2. 6PM (Six PM) Black Hoodie
The Vibe: DACH region streetwear, oversized, heavy-weight comfort. Review: Standard 6PM aesthetic. The embroidery on the hood and chest looks tight—no connecting stitch flaws or loose threads visible from this distance. The contrast stitching is a nice touch, giving it that deconstructed look. The hood shape looks substantial (stiff enough to stand up), which is crucial for a hoodie at this price point.

Pros: Thick blank, likely high GSM. The embroidery detailing elevates it above a basic black hoodie.

Cons: 6PM sizing can be weird (often very boxy/cropped). If you didn't size correctly, it might sit too short on the waist.

Rating: 7.5/10 – Solid daily driver, but fit is everything here.

3. Grey Graphic Zip-Up (Unknown Brand/Y2K Style)
The Vibe: Y2K revival, opium-adjacent, slouchy fit. Review: Looks like a soft cotton blend. The 3D puff print/embroidery across the chest is bold. The grey tone is versatile. However, the zipper hardware is the make-or-break factor here; if it waves or bubbles when you sit down, it ruins the silhouette. The cuffs look a bit loose/relaxed, which fits the style but might stretch out over time.

Pros: Very comfortable looking. The embroidery design is clean and centered.

Cons: The zipper track looks a little flimsy. Light grey stains easily.

Rating: 6.5/10 – Cool piece for lounging or layering, but durability is a question mark.

4. Canada Goose Freestyle Vest (White)
The Vibe: Winter luxury, functional, ""clean girl/guy"" aesthetic. Review: This is a bold choice. White Canada Goose gear is notoriously hard to keep clean, but it looks the best when it is clean. The badge looks solid—the leaves look distinct and the font spacing is decent (common tell on bad ones). The puffiness (down fill) looks adequate, though it could be a bit loftier in the collar area.

Pros: The badge placement is correct. It’s an insane flex piece for layering over hoodies.

Cons: Immediate anxiety about getting it dirty. The collar looks slightly deflated in the photo (might just need to be fluffed in the dryer).

Rating: 8/10 – Looks fire, just don't spill coffee on it.

5. Asics Gel-Kayano 14 (Silver/Blue)
The Vibe: Tech-runner, dad-shoe, JJJJound aesthetic (without the markup). Review: These are arguably the best sneaker silhouette of the last year. The mesh quality looks breathable and the metallic overlays are cutting cleanly (no jagged edges). The glue work around the midsole looks clean, which is rare even for retail pairs lately. The colorway is extremely wearable.

Pros: Insane comfort (Gel tech). Matches literally everything (jeans, sweats, cargos).

Cons: The mesh toebox is fragile; watch out for toe poking through after heavy wear.

Rating: 9.5/10 – Near perfect sneaker. Essential rotation piece.

6. Burberry Classic Check Scarf
The Vibe: Old money, heritage luxury, safe gift. Review: You can't go wrong with the classic check. The tassels/fringing look neat and unfrayed. The crucial thing with these is the alignment of the pattern—the black and red lines seem to intersect symmetrically, which is good. The packaging is nice, but the scarf itself is what matters. If this is cashmere, it's a win; if it's wool, it might be itchy.

Pros: Timeless. Never goes out of style. Keeps value well.

Cons: Everyone has one (or a dupe of one). It’s a bit ""safe"" compared to the rest of the haul.

Before I start apologies for my English and grammar . English is not my first language so take in mind 😂.

I’m trying to make sense of something that’s been happening with a coworker that I’ve been working with for 2 years at the start he’d always praise me , now and only recently started working in the same project recently in the same area . Recently he wouldn’t leave me alone. He keeps coming into my office area , asking if I wanted coffee on zoom message work . I didn’t reply, but he brought one anyway. He also kept asking when my meetings would end, tried to pass my office area when I was speaking with a customer, and gave me a smile while looking at me but I didn’t smile back.

Sometimes he’d open my office door and talk to me, lingers thru . But when I invite him to work with me in a bigger area, barely comes. Prior to this he opened up about a personal matter . And shortly after I went to check on him and to let him know I’m all ears basically.

when it’s just the two of us, he behaves this way hovering, smiling, bringing snacks, lingering, even making long eye contact. But when certain  other coworkers are around, he acts completely different he acts like I don’t exist, he doesn’t notice me and treats everyone else like that expect from those certain coworkers .

There are times where I’ve given him the silent treatment after he acts different around certain other colleagues, but then he’d smile at me and start a conversation then ask me to go on a work breakfast break with him when they’ve left , but when they are around he’d go on breakfast breaks with them I wouldn’t include or ask me to join , the others normally do but not him. And there’s other time I’d keep my distance then when those certain co workers aren’t around he’d always come looking for me or would message to ask where I am etc .

He has my number but barely texts me outside of work unless it’s work related. Or he’d check on me when he’s at work and I’m not . I’m currently on holiday and have been for 2 weeks now and he hasn’t messaged me by my number

He doesn’t message me outside of work , I guess my question is what are his intentions and does he have a crush on me? Is he expecting me to chase him ?",2,1767032556.0,self,4,1.0,False

Maybe it’s 2 AM, your eyes are burning from the screen glare, and you’ve got three empty coffee cups on your desk. Maybe you’re looking at a practice exam and feeling like you don’t know anything.

It’s easy to lose sight of the ""why"" when you’re buried in the ""how."" But remember: you aren't just memorizing facts or solving equations; you are **building a version of yourself that can handle anything.**

If you’re feeling the weight of it today, here are a few reminders of why you’re doing this:

# The ""Why"" Behind the Grind

* **""The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet.""** – *Aristotle*
   * The struggle you feel right now is the ""bitter root."" The career, the financial freedom, and the impact you’ll make later are the ""sweet fruit.""
* **""Don’t wish it were easier; wish you were better.""** – *Jim Rohn*
   * Studying isn’t just about getting an A. It’s about the mental discipline you develop by doing hard things when you don't feel like doing them.
* **""Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day-in and day-out.""** – *Robert Collier*
   * You don't need to master the whole subject tonight. You just need to win the next hour.
* **""Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.""** – *Nelson Mandela*
   * You are currently sharpening your tools. Don't show up to the future with a dull blade.

# A Quick Reality Check

One year from now, you will be so glad you started today. You will thank yourself for the discipline you’re building right now. The discomfort is temporary, but the degree and the knowledge are forever.

Cons: The mesh toebox is fragile; watch out for toe poking through after heavy wear.

Rating: 9.5/10 – Near perfect sneaker. Essential rotation piece.

6. Burberry Classic Check Scarf
The Vibe: Old money, heritage luxury, safe gift. Review: You can't go wrong with the classic check. The tassels/fringing look neat and unfrayed. The crucial thing with these is the alignment of the pattern—the black and red lines seem to intersect symmetrically, which is good. The packaging is nice, but the scarf itself is what matters. If this is cashmere, it's a win; if it's wool, it might be itchy.

Pros: Timeless. Never goes out of style. Keeps value well.

Cons: Everyone has one (or a dupe of one). It’s a bit ""safe"" compared to the rest of the haul.

Rating: 8/10 – A classic staple, boring but effective.",1,1767032293.0,CoutureReps,1,1.0,False

1pytnwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/bobdylan/comments/1pytnwj/rolling_thunder_revue/,Rolling thunder revue,"Hi!

I'm currently obsessed with anything and everything related to the Rolling Thunder Revue. I feel like the sound is so full, and I especially LOVE the violin on tracks like Isis and One More Cup of Coffee (a few of my favs!). I had never heard of anything about this era in Dylan's career, until I watched the Martin Scorsese film. Since then, I've scoured every corner of the internet to find any footage from that period. 

I was born in 1976, and my family raised me on country music, so anything I know about Dylan, I've had to find on my own. I'd love to hear what people, who have been around for the whole trip, think about this era in Dylan's music. What were the perceptions of the songs/music? The tour? The face makeup? All the hangers-on? How does it compare to the other periods in Dylan's career? Don't hold back!",14,1767032225.0,bobdylan,21,0.95,False
1pytnn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/philly/comments/1pytnn0/moving_to_philly_hows_fishtown/,"Moving to Philly, how’s Fishtown?","Hi Philly! I’m a mid-20s NYC transplant, recently liberated from a shoebox apartment in Bushwick with 7 other roommates. I make a very healthy six-figure salary as a digital nomad in tech/finance/creative-whatever. Basically, I’ve mastered the art of working just enough to afford avocado toast and a small private island someday.

I’m currently scouting neighborhoods and am intrigued by Fishtown. I hear it’s basically Williamsburg’s slightly cheaper, more “authentic” cousin, with a Sweetgreen and artisanal coffee shops to get my vegan gluten free dairy free soy skinny vanilla cold brew latte with a foamy finish.

Other must-haves: craft cocktail bars within walking distance with $25 old fashioned, a dog-friendly café for my Golden Doodle service dog to sit at the bar (he’s very discerning), at least one boutique yoga studio that also sells kombucha, and enough artisanal pizza spots that I can justify skipping lunch entirely.

Is Fishtown really the Philly Williamsburg, or am I better off settling in another neighborhood where my aura of ironic sophistication will be properly appreciated? And is $3,000/mo a reasonable enough budget? I feel that might be cutting it too close.

TIA for your thoughts!",0,1767032210.0,philly,29,0.28,False
