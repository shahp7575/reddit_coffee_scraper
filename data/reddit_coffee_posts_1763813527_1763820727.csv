by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Cagliari vs. Genoa: A Relegation Free-for-All Where the Only Winner Is the Bookmaker**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a Serie A clash that’s less *gloria* and more *gloria-what-the-heck-is-going-on*. On Saturday, Cagliari (14th, 10 points) hosts Genoa (18th, 7 points) in a match that’s less about triumph and more about avoiding the relegation equivalent of a group project with a toddler. Let’s break this down with the precision of a Roman charioteer and the humor of a stand-up comedian stuck in a stadium.

---

### Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Sieves

The bookmakers are throwing up their hands. Genoa is the slight favorite, with implied probabilities hovering around **42-43%** (thanks to +2.35 to +2.55 odds), while Cagliari checks in at **30-31%**. The draw? A tidy **33-34%**, which is about the same chance of your local barista remembering your coffee order.

The spread? Genoa is a -0.25 chalk, meaning they’re the “favorite” in name only. If you bet them, you need a win or a draw to cash. Cagliari is +0.25 at +1.75 odds, which is basically the sportsbook’s way of saying, “We’re not sure either.”

Total goals? The Over 1.5 is priced at **1.65-1.68** (implied \~60% chance), while the Under is **2.1-2.22**. Given these teams’ defenses—Cagliari concedes 14 goals (2.33/pg) and Genoa 16 (2.67/pg)—this is a match where the only “clean sheet” will be the one you wipe off your face after laughing at their backline.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries? What Injuries?

Let’s assume neither team’s injury report includes a star player “recovering from a hamstring injury after tripping over their own shoelaces” (a classic Serie A trope). But here’s what we *do* know:

* **Cagliari’s home form** is worse than a vegan at a barbecue. They’ve won just 1 of 5 home games, drawing 1 and losing 3. Their “stadium” (Unipol Domus) might as well be called the “Unipol *Please-Just-Draw-So-We-Don’t-Have-To-Talk-About-This-Anymore*.”

Empty coffee cup

I can't be bothered to fill it up

Sunrise is creeping in

The night ends a new day begins

Another day on my own

But I'm locked in trapped



\[Pre-chorus\]

Tell me why I feel so small 

Tell me why I can't make the call

The walls my only friend they hear it all

Tell me why

Why can't I do it

Tell me why

Step outside leave the house

Tell me why

Why am I afraid to meet people

Tell me why

Scared to make a connection

Tell me why

I can't tell myself I'll be ok

Tell me why

The world spins fast out there

I'm stuck in here breathing stale air

I see them all outside

Laughing breathing in fresh air

My window is my screen

A silent movie scene

Why can’t I do it why can’t I try

I given up on life tell me why

The mirror’s just staring it won’t reply

I see myself staring back and I cry

Shoes by the door but they won’t move

This fear's a shadow I can't prove

Underneath the moon

A different wave

Living life to the full I'm entranced

But I’m stuck here with my empty stance

The phone keeps ringing but I can’t pick it up

My minds lost in a maze I try to fight back

My heart’s a prisoner behind broken walls

1p3u175,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1p3u175/demise_of_the_karens/,Demise of the Karens,"The county council chamber stretched before the human pleb representative, a building of astonishing mediocrity designed to impress on everyone who entered a sense of mild boredom. Inside, the council of somewhat corrupt local politicians sat in judgement of underwhelming county affairs. 
     When they got to the subject of placing round a bouts along the trading corridors of the city, Okanquo knew she had to make her voice heard. The other beings in the room considered her people primative. They drove vehicles that still burned hydrocarbons and shifted gears with manual transmissions. They had gotten so comfortable with electric vehicles and dct hybrids they had forgotten the old ways. That those primitive vehicles could still accelerate tons of metal to significant fractions above the speed limit.
     The council ruled in favor of the Karen's, a species who could trace their lineage back as far as some rich family that came over on the Mayflower. They held themselves as more important than other species, always demanding to see a manager. Always going slow in the fast lane. Making people miserable in HOA's. Dejected, Okanquo went back to her quarters. She pulled out her communication device and opened the door dash app. Her hands moved over the controls with practiced efficiency, ordering from Applebee's for the 3rd night in a row. She wasn't breaking her diet, she was feeding her soul, there was a difference. Her best friend the kanine came over, it's greeting warm and affectionate. 
     Somewhere nearby Sarah Chen was sitting in her vehicle playing Words With Friends, when the alert came through. She dropped everything, there was a hungry person and humanity never left people behind. Moving to the restaurant, former LT Chen, no relation, handed her the order. She piloted her vessel to the designated apartment, and was greeted with a genuine smile that made her night. The kanine looked at Okanquo with wonder and she wished she could explain that when humans met a problem, like being too lazy to cook, they overcame. They adapted. Humans evolved as persistence hunters and rose to the top of the food chain on a death world. But she just broke off a piece of her 2 for $20 hamburger and fed it to him.
     The next day she drove to work and was immediately attacked by the Karens. They cut her off in traffic. They cut the line at Starbucks. And as she put on her shift managers badge for her job at Dillards, she knew it was only the beginning. The store manager, Marcus Webb, came over to her with a stale donut and luke warm coffee. He was an older man, with graying hair and eyes that had seen too much. He was a relic from when physical retail still mattered, and echoes of that time still haunted him. ""Good morning Okanquo, I heard about the defeat at the council meeting. I have a plan to defeat the Karen's but we have to have patience. Keep acting the role and acting dependent on their patronage, the tide will be turning soon."" Encouraged, Okanquo braced herself and walked out of the break room. Room. Room. Room. Room. Room.
     Her crew were the best in the mall. Sarah Kim ran the register with grit and determination. James Okafor stood by in men's apparel, adapting clothing to fit people because that is what he loved. Security Officer Lee Hi Jin stood ready at his post in loss management, staring at displays, waiting for his time to tackle someone to break up the boredom. Together they stood against the tides of history, to greet the few who missed not shopping online. In the darkness of the internet, in the spaces between biased news and endless banner ads, a movement was growing. In the meantime, Okanquo kept her team fighting off entitled Karen's and keeping their smiles genuine. The council met and passed motions, forgetting the plebs even existed. Little did they know that peace would soon be shattered.
     James told Okanquo to be ready on her next day off to attend the council meeting and file an appeal to the round a bout situation. She did as instructed but with little hope in the outcome. As her motion came up for debate, something unbelievable happened. Suddenly representatives of the plebs were everywhere around her, lending their support and voices to stop the dumbest and most inconvenient traffic impediment in the galaxy. As the chamber erupted in chaos, the Karen's being drowned out by the voices of the plebs, the council chairman received an urgent message from her aid. It turns out social media was in a minor tizzy over the round a bout proposal and the voters may just change the current administration next election. The contractor clan, who paid bribes to the council members, tried to align with Karen's to kill the motion. But it had come too far. Looking around her Okanquo saw faces from forgotten minor species that she recognized. Sarah Kim representing the Delivery People. Former LT Kim, no relation, for the Wait Staff Alliance. Even some blue collar construction workers from the Local 369 Union who didn't want their daily lives slightly inconvenienced. 
     It turns out that Marcus Webb had assigned his niece to stir up as much social media pressure as she could and she did so with the single minded determination of a teen that had never lived in a world without smartphones. In the face of such opposition Okanquo's appeal passed and silence fell across the room. Later, standing at the observation deck of a local park, a Karen approached her. Gone was the look of mild contempt, replaced with something that might have been grudging respect. ""How did you defeat us when your husband doesn't make hundreds of thousands per year?

I (41F) am the sole provider for our household. My husband (45M) is a stay-at-home dad to our 3-month-old. First time parents. This setup was agreed on before we married — he’s always wanted kids, and with his teaching background we save on childcare. He handles a lot of household tasks (cooking, fixing, building, laundry). He hates cleaning, so I usually pick up those tasks (dishes, bathrooms, etc.). Overall he’s a great partner, husband, and dad.

The conflict:
He wants to know how he can get house projects done during the weekdays so he can enjoy his weekends. But the only way for that to happen is if I take over baby care during the day, which I can’t — I’m working full-time.

I’m honestly confused because caring for her during the day is his role as the stay-at-home parent. I understand he feels like his “manhood” is being diminished by not getting projects done, and I validate that projects are his outlet/identity and a way he contributes. But we also can’t pay bills without me working, and I need him to focus on her during my work hours. I’m exhausted from fighting about this same issue.

Current schedule looks like this:
	•	8–9:30am: I work
	•	9:30–10am: I take baby so he can  
             make coffee/watch a morning show
	•	10am–4pm: I work while he’s on baby  
              duty
	•	4pm: I get off work → errands, dinner 
             decisions, or baby care while he 
             cooks
	•	5–6pm: He cooks dinner
	•	6–7pm: We eat; I clean since he 
             cooked
	•	7–7:30pm: I wash dishes/clean; then I 
             feed or bathe baby and put her down
	•	8–10:30pm: He games with friends; I 
             watch baby or sleep if I can to 
             prepare for night duty.
	•	11pm–8am: I’m on night duty (feeds, 
             diapers, soothing)

            Our baby only wakes 1–2 times a    
            night, but I’m still up a lot in between    
            soothing her so she doesn’t wake the   
            whole house.

	•	Weekends: I take full baby duty so he 
             can do projects.

I’m really trying to see his perspective and not assume he’s taking advantage or trying to shift more onto me. I’m burning the candle at both ends but I assume we both are with a baby. 

How do I see this from his side? Am I missing something? I want him to know I appreciate him, value him, & give him credit. Which I tell him but he says if I truly values him then I would not have made this an issue. Help. Thank you. ",1,1763820289.0,StayAtHomeDaddit,0,1.0,False

1p3ty70,https://i.redd.it/guut4f1het2g1.png,Portfolio Auditor v1.1 is here! Finally made it simpler 🎉,"Hey folks!

Quick note for beta users: If your trial license has expired, just ping me! I'll extend it for free so you can test out v1.1. Want everyone to try the new improvements! 🙂

So, many of you pointed out that the setup and accessing tools was bit complicated in the initial version. I heard you loud and clear, and honestly, I felt the same way! 😅

This is a community-driven project, and your feedback really matters. So I've spent time rebuilding things to make it way easier to use.

# What's Different Now?

# Everything in One Place Now!

Remember how you had to jump between CAMS Uploader, NAV Refresh, and other stuff? Yeah, that was annoying. Now it's all one single app called Portfolio Auditor.

* Upload your CAMS statements → Done in the same app
* Refresh your NAV values → Same app
* All your analysis still shows up in Power BI like before

Already using the old version? Good news - your database file works fine! Just download the new app, replace the old one, and use your same license key. Nothing breaks.

# Benchmark Selection Made Easy

You know how you had to open a separate Power BI report just to find scheme codes for benchmarking? That was weird, right?

Now it's built right into the main app. When you refresh, you get two simple choices:

* Use your saved benchmark (quick option)
* Pick new benchmarks (if you want to change)

That's it. No more back and forth.

# Your Daily Routine = Just 2 Clicks

Seriously, that's all:

1. Open Portfolio Auditor → Click ""Daily Refresh"" (grabs latest NAV, does all calculations)
2. Open your Power BI report → Refresh it

Done. Go enjoy your coffee ☕

# Why I Made These Changes

Look, I built this tool for our community, not some corporate process. The whole point is to make portfolio tracking easier, not add more headaches. When multiple people told me the setup was confusing, I knew I had to simplify it.

This update is basically me trying to fix what was making life harder for you all.

# Where This Tool is Heading 🚀

Here's the bigger picture - Portfolio Auditor is evolving into a complete wealth tracker / multi-asset tracker.

I know many of us (including me!) track investments in Excel. I'm a huge Excel fan myself. But think of this tool as an advanced Excel system powered by Power BI - same flexibility, but with better analytics and visualizations.

With v1.1, I've added support for all the asset types I think most people would want to track in one place. But I need your input!

What assets do you want to track? If there's something missing that you'd like to see, let me know in the comments. This isn't just an analysis tool anymore - it's becoming your one-stop tracker for everything you invest in.

The goal is simple: Stop juggling multiple spreadsheets and apps. Track everything in one place with powerful insights.

Want to try v1.1? Grab it and let me know what you think!

Got questions? Stuck somewhere? Just comment below - happy to help! And if you find bugs (let's be real, there might be some 😄), please report them so I can fix them quickly.

Is the daily drive for a member of my family. The car has been solid for over 11 years so I cant complain about it. At the beginning of the month the ignition lock started to fail, until it left my kid stranded downtown DFW. I had the car towed to a very well regarded local Honda dealer. 
They charges $2200 on labor and parts. I wasn't happy, but ok. I understood i paid extra for a new key, but i guess I was mistaken, so no new key. Fine. FINE.
We get the car back, it rains two days later, and the windshield wiper selector wont work fully! It feels as if there is an obstruction precluding the lever to work all the way to max, and since it's next to the ignition lock, it appears to me that they didnt assemble the lock right. 
I bring it to the dealership, and they want me to pay a $199 fee to check their mistake! I told the advisor that there is no way I am paying anything, and I offered to leave. The advisor waved the fee but said that IF it was their mistake, they will fix it. 
And that's why I only drive Fords. They might be shit compared to Honda, but I can buy a $200 ignition lock and change it in my garage in and afternoon. I bet i will mess something else (I have broken things in my truck while doing repairs) but I aint skirting responsibility. 
Bunch of crooks!

I have a dilemma because I don’t know if I am just overthinking all of those situation that have happened to me with a particular coworker that I am working with

So I started a new job like a month, and in this place I do like by barista kind of job , my team is 4 women’s including me, M 40y, D 30y and E 22y and my self. 

M is the older one, but she plays the same role as me and others, but since I joined the team, I noticed that she is always micromanaging my work and pointing out everything that I do wrong, I do accept criticism because I want to grow, but I’m not young and I’m not dumb and I have years of experience myself in this field. 

M doesn’t accept sometimes the things that I say or point out that she’s doing wrong or she could accept my way of working because what we need is that the customers to feel good when they are being served by us.

So most of the time she always changes the cards that we make/prepare for the next day with cakes and other pastries, making me like the one that always put a lot of stuff that at the end of the day doesn’t sell, D and E say that she does the same thing with them, but it’s getting worse because she is almost like targeting me, but I don’t know if is exactly what is happening. In Some conversations that we have during our shift together she points out that she has 40 years of experience and she knows better and I should just accept what she says and do the things her way, she’s not my boss. She’s not above me, she is my colleague. She has the same Category as me. 

Yesterday she told me that I should not leave the machine with the coffee on it if I will not use it to take a coffee, this happens because a client asked me for one coffee but corrected themselves and asked me for two, so I left the machine with one coffee to take And she saw that and told me to throw away the other coffee. So when I came home, I searched about what she told me and the rules in this type of things and she was not wrong at all. Yeah, we should throw away the coffee that is not taken because the coffee could lose the flavor and the power itself so when I go back from my lunch break, I told her that I did a search and she was in fact, right she starts yelling at me and getting mad because I was doubting the things she’s saying and the things she does, but in my point of view, it was not that is just like if I don’t know I will search if I am not sure I will search you should be interested in learning things. What’s the problem? What’s the big problem in here? I don’t know.

That evening I talked with my boss and he told me if I wanted to be alone serving I could because they see that I’m a very efficient worker so I told him yes I want to be alone doing my shift if I can. When I come back from the office M ask me what we were talking about. I didn’t feel comfortable sharing the things that I was speaking with my boss so I just told her that for the next week I will be able to do my shift alone. She got pissed and I don’t know why, she starts asking me in a very rude tone, If I was sure what I did and if I was really, really sure if I could do all of the work alone since I am younger than her and I told her yes I am. So she stormed off of the counter and told me “if you can do it alone and you feel like it so do it. I’m going to help someone else in the store “ - she left me all alone for the next hours until the end of the shift.

Today I open the store with D and she’s really nice and she noticed that M didn’t close the shop as she should and we had to do much more work doing the morning and was very exhausting. Besides that D told me if I wanted to be alone she will leave me alone doing my shift and I said thank you so much I want to it. The morning went smoothly. So M appears to do the Night Shift and she didn’t ask me if I needed help and what time I was getting off of my shift to go lunch she just vanish for one hour and a half. When she comes back she tells me that I need to go home and go to my lunch break, but I talk to her and say that I have customers to serve and she just leaves me there to go chat with other customers there are already eating, so I needed to go home she didn’t help me and she was pissed because I didn’t wash the dishes and left her with a lot of work to do like cleaning the place. 

I am overthinking this is she targeting me and punishing me for something? I don’t know what is happening.",1,1763820018.0,WorkAdvice,0,1.0,False

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

I'm financially stable, single, and usually flies solo, but lately l've been wanting more social interaction.

I usually prefer chatting first (depends on the vibe), and I'm hoping to meet someone who's in the search for something lasting and not just to pass time. Being a Big 4 grad would be a plus, but at the very least, l'd love to meet someone sensible and engaging to talk to.

1p3tv0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthAsianMasculinity/comments/1p3tv0n/fake_friends_caused_my_inferiority_complex/,Fake friends caused my inferiority complex,"Punjabi male born and raised in the UK. Did anyone else ever have fake friends during school who would tear you down and make you feel inferior. 

  
Growing up i lived in a majority white area. Thus during my school years in my schools there were maybe around 5-10 kids in my entire school who were not white. In school i never struggled at all with friendships, and was somewhat popular. I was good at sports, hung out with the cool kids, talked to a few girls etc. 

  
However, my friends would also put me down when it came towards getting a girlfriend. I remember in my early years say 8-12 having a few girls coming up to me and telling me they like me, etc. When ever i would tell my friends, they would always just say she wouldn't like you and you need will get an Indian girlfriend, etc. This had a big impact on me and i started having a inferiority complex when it came to dating outside of my race which stuck with me for a while. 



My inferiority complex was only related to dating as everything else i was good at, (i was always good at school, sports, fit, tall, etc). In my later years i went to uni and had been going to the gym a lot. I was 6ft 3 inches tall and weighed around 100kg. I went to uni in London and left all my old friends as they went different universities. I still always had my inferiority complex and i remember having resentment and jealousy towards other couples when i would see them about. As i always thought that no women would ever find me attractive due to all the things my friends had put in my mind. 

  
Anyway how things changed was i kind of reinvented myself a bit at uni. Before my mother done my shopping and would get me just cheap and just baggy clothes which never fit properly and were never in fashion. I started buying not fashion stuff but clothes which fit and were not just baggy hoodies. I started wearing tight shirts, jumpers, etc (still warm early September to October in UK). I slowly had more girls in my lectures start talking to me, starting conversations, etc. I still wasn't acting much on it and was always still nervous of women and scared to ever show my feelings. Despite being  ""attractive"" i always though of myself as inferior to white men when it comes to dating. 



I remember this new student came during the second year of uni only to do one module. She was fit and attractive, i never talked to her much during the semester as i had a different friend set. But out of the blue once she just started talking to me before class and i just said do you want to get a coffee after. Had a coffee and got her number and i know it sounds sad but the moment we walked away i had the biggest fucking smile on my face and confidence boost. As i waited for my train home on the platform i remember looking around me looking and saying bro (look at yourself how do you think you are inferior to those around me). I know it sounds egotistical but it was at that moment it all changed. I know it sound cliché but what you tell yourself you slowly start believing. 



To the lads reading this i promise you a lot of your friends who are white might even play into this. I think some white people feel threatened when they see men of other races who are more attractive or with white women. Thus, love bashing people of colour. For example, white incels love attacking men of colour. ",2,1763819849.0,SouthAsianMasculinity,0,1.0,False

I’m an architecture student and over the last months I’ve been making my own CAD blocks for studio projects , furniture, people, outdoor items, and especially cars, which I enjoy drawing way more than I should.

I originally posted a similar thing on another subreddit, but it turned out to be pretty inactive, so I’m trying my luck here where people actually exist.

I decided to organize everything properly and share them (and hey, if someone ends up liking them, it might help me pay for morning coffees or other miscellaneous student-life expenses ).

I also made a **free starter pack** so anyone can test the quality without having to buy anything.

👉 **Free Pack + All Packs (Notion link):** [**https://auspicious-lightning-e37.notion.site/My-CAD-Blocks-Library-238c4292924f804980e6cbba1ff76240?source=copy\_link**](https://auspicious-lightning-e37.notion.site/My-CAD-Blocks-Library-238c4292924f804980e6cbba1ff76240?source=copy_link)

I’m not here just to promote — I genuinely want feedback from other students:

* Do the blocks look good?
* Are they useful?
* Too simple? Too detailed?
* Anything I should improve before making more?

You can be brutally honest — I don’t mind the roasting as long as it helps me improve.

It's a really long one, so if you're not a fan of reading... I don't know what to tell you.

# Elowyn - The island of 8 themes

Elowyn is an island known for its 8 diverse themes, and 8 different colors.

• Red - Forestcore (The Scarlet Orchard Heights) • Orange - Farmcore (Pumpkinspire Fields) • Yellow - Citycore (Butterscotch City) • Green - Swampcore (Mossfall Bog) • Blue - Coastalcore (Forget-me-not Bay) • Purple - Fairycore (Diana’s Twilight Glade) • Pink - Meadowcore (Blossomthread Meadow) • White - Cottagecore (Elowyn Valley)

When you enter the Dream of Elowyn, you're met with the serene skies and calm music of 5am. You wake in resident services. Make your way down to the airport. Your first impression of Elowyn is nothing short of dull as you wake in Butterscotch City - where ducks roam, and the heavenly smell of coffee fills the air. Yellow flowers line the simple dirt paths, and dot the small field known for its picnics, where the villagers are often joined by ducks, seeking their bread. Here, you find Goldie's cafe, curre​ntly run by Marshal, who is visiting whilst Goldie goes on vacation (AKA, I need her, and Marshal won't move out). Next door is the lovely Frett, an old dog who spent his whole life here, constructing the town and building it up.

To the left of Butterscotch City, you're met by Pumpkinspire Fields, the main food suppliers, growing oranges, pumpkins, and carrots. Home of the lovely Billy, a goat who adores tending to his crops, and occasionally zooming around the island. In Pumpkinspire Fields, the scent of pumpkin pie and nature fills your nose. Its notably more overgrown than the built up Butterscotch City, but it's no less serene. Heading left will take you up to The Scarlet Orchard Heights...

The Scarlet Orchard Heights is the home of Poppy, the lovely red squirrel. She is often found in her tomato garden, or reading in her small, fenced-in picnic spot. If she's not there, she might just be home, baking cherry pies with the very Cherries that she grows and nurtures herself, found growing around the Orchard. Apples are also a delicacy, providing delicious apple jam, pies, and even just a snack to eat right from the trees. Villagers such as Stella, Ursala, and Pate are often found here, enjoying the fruits, company of Poppy, and the shade of the abundance of trees.

Heading north, you'll find yourself within the lovely pink flowers of none other than Blossomthread Meadow - home of Stella, provider of quilts and soft jumpers. And Ursala - who, despite her intimidating appearance as a bear - is actually incredibly sweet and nurturing. She waters the beautiful field every day, and would adore to chat to you over some tea and peach pie. Which - speaking of peach pie - Blossomthread Meadow is home to delicious peaches, and is known for its peach jam, peach pie, and even the lovely peach jelly. Orchid Mantis' are also a native bug, and are often found within the fields and crawling on the flowers.

Down the ramp, you find something far more enchanting - gloomy even - Diana’s Twilight Glade. Many small homes painted in purple and black are common here, home to the fairies. Diana’s Twilight Glade is home to - you guessed it - Diana. She often reads on the crescent moon chairs, or sits beside the glow of nova lights late at night, watching for the fairies. Purple flowers are an abundance here, giving the glade a more witch-like appearance, giving it the gloomy beauty it is so well known for.

As you head right, you are met with something brighter. Something sunny. Forget-me-not Bay. The Coastal Town, ​painted in gorgeous blues and whites, flowers and palm trees clustered together. A pool party southwards, with free ice lollies, delicacy of Pate. Pate and Jeremiah live together on the cliff of the Bay. Their homes decorated gorgeously, with ocean views, fishing gear and reading nooks. It reminds you of Coastal new England, which it is heavily inspired by.

Heading south, you find the swamp. Mossfall Bog. This area is known for green mums, black Cosmos, and yellow lilies, and of course - Moss. Henry, a lovely little frog, lives on the beach of the swamp. He spends most of his days indoors, researching bugs, investigating strange moss and mushrooms growing in the swamp, and tending to his flowers - gifts from his best friend Ursala. Life in the swamp isn't ideal, but my is there so much to do. And finally, heading right, you're right back in Butterscotch City.

You may find yourself drawn back to the views of the construction site. And you spot a secret. Nestled between the trees, there's a bridge. And as you cross over, you realise where you are - Elowyn Valley. Home of the resident representative. It is white and cottagecore. White pumpkins and pale wheat grows here. Books and trees all around. It's the heart of Elowyn. Hopping across the river, you find a picnic spot, and hopping again, there's a rainbow flower field. Colors of all the different areas. And finally, you have finished. You have explored the magical island. And so you head back to Luna, and close your eyes. When you wake back on your own island, I hope you find yourself inspired.

\- Brooke, writer and island representative and designer of Elowyn.

She has been meaning to get a laptop for a while as well. Because as she puts it, it's not a matter of if she will be bedridden, it's a matter of when at this point. So after I repaired the system files, we sat down and ordered a laptop, new screen and a little docking station to connect screen, keyboard, printer, etc.

We recently adopted a new 2 month old female kitten, Stormy. We have two other adult cats, Ava (5 yrs) and Maximus (3 yrs.) All three are fixed! 

We completed every introduction step. Slow intros, swapping things with scents, site swaps and visual sightings, the whole shebang. Both adult cats are larger in size than your average domestic house cat, so we fully expected Stormy to be a bit on edge. Luckily, she’s easily distracted with her favorite toys if need be. 

Ava’s first introduction went surprisingly well. We thought she’d be the territorial one, just like she was when Maximus was a kitten, but she immediately showed maternal signs towards Stormy. For example, Stormy hopped up on the coffee table and nearly slipped off, and Ava rushed to make sure she didn’t. It’s Maximus that’s the issue. 

Usually, Max is a very playful, carefree, and affectionate little man - especially to other cats. We often refer to him as our little himbo. But he’s hissing and growling at Stormy, and has attempted to bat at her several times without actually making contact with her. 

What can we do to make this easier on Max? Do we need to supply him with more things that smell like Storm? Do we need to give him a bit more attention to make sure he doesn’t feel left out? Any advice is greatly appreciated.

1p3tlwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1p3tlwe/my_job_as_a_firefighter_living_in_a_cursed_town/,My Job As a Firefighter Living in a Cursed Town,"I’ve spent my entire life in my hometown. It's where I was born, where I grew up, and is probably where I will die. To some people this sounds like a miserable existence, but honestly, I don't think I’d have it any other way.

My Town had an industrial boom once, but that time came and went long before I was ever born. Only the old-timers remember that era now, and even then, most of them were only around for the tail end of it. The rest of us only know this Town for what it has since become: a ghost of its former self, marred by the rusting titan of a bygone age that now looms over our home like a dead sentinel, its hollow body a symbol of what once was, and what will never be again. Our Town rests in that immense shadow now, aching and pleading to once again feel the sunlight that will forever be obscured by its past. 

But hey, it’s home.

My lifelong dedication to this Town is what made me want to become a firefighter. I wanted to give back to the community that shaped me, and the best way I could think to do this was to join the local fire department. That was going on twenty years ago now, and in that time I’ve seen and experienced things, both on and off the job, that most people would struggle to believe. But I guess that comes with the territory of living in a cursed town.

Everybody who lives here learns at a young age that something isn’t right about this place. One day you become old enough to realize that other towns you visit aren’t quite like the one you call home; they don’t carry that familiar layer of darkness that seems to envelop you like a blanket every time you cross back over our Town’s borders after spending time away. Other towns don’t feel like they’re perpetually cold and cloudy, even on hot summer days. They don’t come with that overwhelming sense that they should have passed into the realm of forgotten history generations ago, but are kept alive by a stubborn populace that refuses to move away and leave them in the past. Most “outsiders” who visit The Town can often feel this shift right away, and usually with greater intensity, since they’re not properly acclimated by years spent beneath The Town’s oppressive weight. It’s for this reason that visitors typically try to stay in The Town for as little time as possible, and why any moving trucks that come here tend to arrive empty.

Some people say The Town has been like this since the beginning of time, destined to inherit its curse since before it was even brought into existence all those many years ago. Others say it acquired the curse through some horrible event, and that it was once just like any other forgettable American small town. I don’t know which theory I subscribe to; on one hand, I can’t see why this land would be so infested with evil for no discernable reason, but on the other, it’s difficult to see The Town as anything other than the source of malice and misery that I’ve always known it to be. The least popular belief of the bunch is that The Town isn’t cursed at all, and that all of the misfortunes herein are merely the spawn of cruel coincidence. There are fewer and fewer followers of this model every year, and soon it will likely go completely extinct.

When searching for the specific occurrence that kicked off The Town’s long string of woes, many of those who believe in Theory B point to an incident that occurred at the turn of the twentieth century; those who follow Theory A merely see this event as a symptom of the much older rot that infests this place. Either way, both agree that the event in question is directly connected to the darkness that lives here.

It happened in the old coal mine, which at the time was one of the major pillars of The Town’s economy. A terrible fire broke out in the mine, the source of which is still debated to this day. The inferno turned the wooden supports above the miners’ heads to ash and caused several collapses inside of the main shaft. Eleven miners were trapped inside for four long days while the townsfolk worked tirelessly to dig through the rubble in order to rescue them. By the time they had reached the miners, all eleven of them were dead. Five of them had suffocated, slain by the toxic air and rancid smoke created by the raging blaze, while three of them were crushed in the shaft collapse. The bodies of the remaining three, however, were never found. It is still speculated as to what became of them, and everybody who you ask has their own theory. I’ll allow you to come up with your own.

The collapse that had doomed those miners also did the same thing to the fire, smothering the blaze so that by the time the townsfolk made it into the collapsed shaft, all that remained of the terrible inferno was a few dying embers. Despite little damage actually being done to the mine itself, it never managed to recover from this disastrous event. Any attempts to reopen it were met with further tragedy. More inexplicable fires broke out, and any new shafts excavated quickly collapsed, often entombing fresh victims in a coffin of furious earth. More strange were the miners who continued to vanish without a trace,  much like the three who had disappeared during that initial devastation. There were reports of men disappearing mid-conversation with their constituents, who turned away for a mere moment to take a sip of water or wipe sweat from their brows, only to turn back and see that their companions were gone, seemingly plucked out of space or dragged into the nearby darkness without so much as a sound. Eventually all of the miners, understandably scared for their lives, wound up moving on to new work, and The Town could not find anybody willing to replace them. After years of attempts to rehabilitate the mine, it was finally shut down for good, thus rendering one of The Town’s main economic stimulants officially deceased.

But though the mine is abandoned and in disuse, that does not mean it remains inactive.

Random fires spring up in that mine at least once a year, despite it remaining empty and free of any activity that would potentially cause such ignitions. In the interest of preventing our town from becoming another Centralia, our department, as well as all those in the surrounding area, work together to extinguish these blazes as they come up. The Town has an entire taskforce in place that monitors the mine for fire activity, and when any is spotted, they immediately dispatch us to the scene. Sometimes we manage to put out the blaze in a few minutes; other times we spend hours battling the fresh inferno that seems intent on taking the entire Town with it into the deepest pits of ruin.

At this point, I feel like I have some kind of sixth sense that allows me to anticipate the mine calls a couple of days in advance. I get a tightness in my stomach that continues to twist like an old wind up toy until it finally snaps. Despite seeing it coming, it ruins my day all the same when that call comes in over dispatch.  I hate returning to that horrible place. The invisible miasma of suffering that I feel in there is sometimes strong enough to make me nauseous within a matter of minutes, and I always get the strange sense that there is something watching me from somewhere deeper in the cavern. Every time we’re there, I fully expect to turn away from one of my companions for a mere moment only to turn back and find that they have disappeared, the charged hoseline they were handling now dancing crazily on the dirty ground as it violently discharges water without guidance or reason. This hasn’t ever happened, but that doesn’t mean that it never will. It could even end up being *me* that gets spirited away into the wanting gloom, dragged by some unseen force that doesn’t even award me the luxury of a final scream. I suppose only time will tell.

Practitioners of Theory B who present the mine disaster as the source of the Town’s curse purport that something old and evil was dug up from the earth on that fateful day well over a century ago, and while I am not entirely sold on such a tale, I admit that it’s hard to argue against it considering all that I’ve experienced down there. That mine is a dark, hellish place, and I shudder to think that anywhere in this world could embody so much natural animosity. It’s strangely more comforting to think that some event kickstarted the decades of concentrated malice that radiate from it, instead of believing that such putrid energy has been there from the start. Maybe an evil contained within the oldest stones of this planet since time immemorial isn’t much better than that same presence being free from the start, but clearly there is enough of a distinction there that it’s created a schism between the townsfolk, so I suppose it does make some kind of difference in the minds of the people.

But the mine isn’t the only place of great and concentrated misfortune in this Town, and thus is not the only potential source for the curse that Option B folk point to. I’d be remiss not to also talk about the old steel mill, which, while now long empty, used to work in tandem with the mine in order to fuel this Town’s former prosperity, much like how the mine fueled the mill’s once-hot furnaces. It saddens me to think that those same furnaces will never know such heat again.

The mill, once a thriving colossus of its day, suffered greatly following the mine incident. Without a constant flow of coal coming in from the mine, the mill’s productivity began to slow. Coal, much like the ore that was refined within the mill, began coming in from other mines in the area. This kept the mill afloat for a few more good decades, but it also made operating the mill more expensive, and as money and resources dried up, so too did the prosperity that this great mastodon of its age had once enjoyed. The mill managed to chug along at a decent pace until the mid-1950s, when its viability finally ran out. By then, the Town had long-since given up its dream of returning to the height of its industrial glory, but nobody wanted to tell that to the old mill. They allowed the poor thing to continue believing it made a difference right up until the very end.

Further tragedy struck on the mill’s final day of operation. A disgruntled millworker, devastated and desperate from the news of the mill’s closure, forced his way into the foreman’s office and gunned the man down without so much as a word. The millworker slew four more of his peers before he was finally subdued. He would never see the inside of a jail cell for his barbaric act; his fellow millworkers, riled into a cocktail of rage, took turns attacking the unarmed and defeated man. They beat him so badly that he perished right there on the office floor. It’s unknown if his killers were ever prosecuted for what they did.

This final act in the mill’s long tenure seems to have marked it as a place of darkness that rivals that of the mine. In the years that followed its closure, rumors persisted that the empty old structure became a place of devil worship and depraved acts of unspeakable sin. Whether or not these events ever did or still do take place is unclear, but this doesn’t stop us from getting called out to the mill several times a year. Usually we’re there to investigate a recurring and mysterious burning smell, only for us to arrive and find that the mill’s old furnaces are as cold as ever. First responders that have been called to the mill over the years have reported that they’ve seen dark figures of shadow and subtly shifting silhouettes deep within the bowels of the old building. I’ve personally heard strange, mechanical noises echoing through the mill’s ghostly, abandoned passageways, and have sworn to everybody I’ve told this to that I once heard the rattling report of a gunshot coming from the direction of what was once the foreman’s office.

There are those who believe that the victims of that tragic day, including the murderer himself, continue to work an endless shift in their old place of employment, even though operations there came to an end many decades ago. Some townsfolk leave them containers of food and thermoses of coffee at the mill’s entrance, only to return the next day to find these vessels emptied of their contents. While I can’t confidently say that I know who is enjoying these free meals, I highly doubt there is a person in Town who would dare to steal food from those old millworkers.

The misfortunes of The Town are not isolated to these two sepulchers of the past. While the mine and the mill only see occasional activity, there are other goings on in this Town that affect the townsfolk much more frequently, and, in turn, affect my department more frequently as well.

Everybody who lives in The Town, without exception, gets into at least one automobile accident per year. Most of these are small fender benders, which is the kind of accident that everybody prays for. Some of them are significantly worse. The worse ones are the ones that *we* have to respond to, and they often aren’t pretty.

The plus side to this is that everybody in Town is incredibly friendly and understanding at the scene of a collision. Two guys back into each other while pulling out of their parking spaces at the grocery store? They laugh it off and may even buy each other a beer that night as a way of saying thanks for being their accident that year. An old woman side swipes a young man’s car and takes out his driver’s side mirror? Well, hey, at least his arm wasn’t sticking out of the window at the time. Everybody’s cars are perpetually dinged up and insurance rates in our Town are through the roof, but people are just happy when their accident turns out to be relatively minor. Of course, there are those few unfortunates who wind up in *two* accidents in a year, which really is a testament to their bad luck more than it is to the town’s curse. There’s always that nagging feeling in the back of your mind after you’ve been in what you believe to be your accident: was this *actually* my accident for the year, or am I going to be severely disappointed in a few months? Some people arrive at an unfortunate answer to this question down the line.

A rather large river runs through the heart of Town. Once a key waterway for shipping ore and metals in and out of Town, it has become much more of a liability in the decades since that industry’s demise. Any and all rain can and often does lead to severe and sudden flooding, resulting in many residents being trapped if they’re anywhere near the river when some unexpected bad weather hits. It is for this reason that our fire department requires that members have several different water rescue certifications under their belt, because they’re definitely going to need them. We pull dozens of people out of the water every year. Many of them are still alive when we do it.

An old, neglected railroad track stretches along the outskirts of Town, extending for untold miles in two directions as it passes through the seemingly endless expanse of dense, dark forest that surrounds our Town on all sides. The track hasn’t been in use for going on thirty years now — not since they created the new line that passes through all the bigger and more important communities to the north — but that doesn’t stop creatures from showing up in dead, gore-strewn heaps on or near the tracks on a semi-regular basis. Deer are usually mostly intact, but smaller animals like foxes and raccoons are lucky if we’re able to tell what species they are based on the carcass they leave behind. Nobody can properly explain how these animals suffer such violent deaths in such close proximity to the abandoned tracks, but the popular legend is that there’s a phantom train still running back and forth along the line at night, never able to reach its destination but also not able to return to where it began. Sometimes it even comes to a stop, and if you climb aboard, you’re whisked away to the land of the departed, never to be seen by any of us again until the day we step beyond the threshold of death. I suppose this is preferable to the alternative encounter you could have with such a train; I’ve seen what that thing can do, and it’s not a pretty sight — especially not when the victim has a familiar face.

Disease seems to spread exceptionally easily here. A simple strain of the common cold can knock half of the community out of commission for several weeks, and has the power to halt life in Town for long stretches of time in the colder months. Drive through Town on a random week in February, and you’d think we had abandoned the place like we already should have done a long time ago. There have been a number of times where the fire department has been stripped to a mere fraction of its normal workforce thanks to a particularly stubborn infestation of flu that decides  to linger in our station for upwards of a month. In these situations, we pretty much all end up catching it — the most debilitated by the disease get to take some time off to recover, but those of us whose immune systems put in overtime are rewarded by getting to work some overtime of our own, all while trying to convince ourselves that we’re not about to keel over at any minute from the agony of the disease that we’re just barely able to fight off. The mine hasn’t been quite cruel enough to set itself ablaze during one of these bouts of illness, at least not while I’ve been working at the department, and I pray that it never develops enough of a malevolent streak to test such a thing out. I’m not exaggerating when I say that such an occurrence could easily spell the end for our little Town.

Death is a large part of life here. Without looking up any statistics, I’m willing to bet that we bury at least twice as many dead each year as any of the nearby towns, all of which are double our size. Demise comes in many forms here; there are a surprisingly high number of ways that a life can be lost in a Town this relatively small. There are the “expected” deaths — the kind of things that the Town macabrely anticipates each year, like drownings during river floods or folks perishing in an especially bad yearly car accident — but there are plenty of strange and mysterious deaths that nobody is able to wrap their head around. Being a firefighter, I’ve witnessed the aftermath of a good number of these strange deaths myself, and have spent more nights than I can count falling asleep while trying to solve their unsolvable mysteries in my troubled mind. Folks have returned home to find their healthy loved ones sitting at the kitchen table, midway through a meal that they will never finish, their deaths seeming to have come simply because the Reaper was having a slow day. Grocery store workers have gone missing for the better part of a week, only to be found wide-eyed and blue, trapped in a freezer that had been used countless times in the days since their absence, and from which food had been placed on shelves and then subsequently purchased by customers. Tiny, loving lapdogs that don’t even seem physically capable of harming another living creature have suddenly snapped for just long enough to bury their little teeth into their owners’ necks, hitting just the right spot to make their victims bleed out within a matter of minutes.

Death comes for everybody here, young and old and sick and healthy alike. Most of the time it strikes at random, but it does follow a few recognizable patterns that everybody in Town recognizes and accepts. Without going into detail, I’ll say this: There is a reason that people in this Town try not to grow too attached to their firstborn children.

I could go on. I could tell you every single detail of every single strange occurrence in this Town, but if I haven’t managed to convince you that it’s cursed by now, then I doubt that I’m going to. I was never really trying to convince anybody of anything by sharing these stories in the first place. My goal was just to highlight a place largely forgotten by time, but still very much deserving of recognition, both for all that it has endured over the generations, as well as for all that it has accomplished. And though these accomplishments might remain cold and buried beneath a dark and heavy past, the pride that they inspire is still very much present in all who live here. There is a reason that so many of us who live in this Town are lifers, and it’s not just because the economic downturn in this region has made it difficult for people to escape it. There are plenty of folks here who wouldn’t leave the Town, curse and all, if given the chance, and I count myself among them. That very well could be the curse itself talking; it’s possible that it’s so deeply rooted within our minds and souls and culture that it tricks us into thinking that we actually enjoy living in this miserable, little corner of America, but if this is the case, then I have no intention of fighting it.

My Town is certainly not an easy place to live in. Something lurks here; something festers. And it likes to remind us all that it’s here with us. But like I said earlier, this Town is still home.

For the last couple of days I’ve been getting that familiar twisting in my gut again: the one that warns me of a coming fire down in the old mine. We haven’t had one yet this year, so we’re definitely overdue. If people are interested, maybe after the fire I can share more stories about my Town (assuming the thing that is in the mine doesn’t actually take me this time). But in the meantime, I’ll leave you with something that’s been on my mind lately, and what actually encouraged me to share these stories in the first place.

I had the upsetting realization recently that some day, maybe some day relatively soon, my Town is going to be gone. It’s going to be forgotten. Some day it will be abandoned, either because the economy took too great of a tumble, or the mine fire finally became too great for us to combat, or simply because that one last stubborn holdout of a resident finally decided that putting up with this dying place just wasn’t worth the effort anymore. Regardless of how it goes down, I know the simple truth is that we likely won’t be here forever.

So I just ask that you do your best to remember the places and the people that the world has forgotten about. Do your best to keep their memory alive in some way. Because despite every hardship that the curse inflicts on this Town, I still believe the worst thing that could ever happen to it would be if nobody even remembers that it was ever here at all.",1,1763819142.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1p3tlq8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p3tlq8,"I’m a solo dev who spent the last few months building an AI to analyze every single traffic camera at the Woodlands & Tuas checkpoints. It fuses computer vision with Google Maps data for real-time jam estimates. It’s live, and I need your help with one missing piece.","Hey everyone,

Like many of you who travel between Singapore and JB, I have a love-hate relationship with the Causeway and the Second Link. I’ve spent way too many hours staring at tiny, grainy LTA camera feeds on my phone, trying to guess if ""a bit crowded"" means a 30-minute wait or a 2-hour nightmare. Google Maps is great, but it doesn't always tell the whole story, especially when a lane is blocked due to a breakdown or customs is just processing slowly.

A few months ago, I decided to stop guessing and start coding.

I wanted to build something that didn't just show me the pictures but actually understood them. I’m a solo developer, and this has been my passion project outside of my day job—late nights, endless coffee, and wrestling with AI models.

Today, I’m finally ready to show the beta version of SmartCommute.ai（causewaytraffic.sg) (and the accompanying iOS app).

Here is what I built and how it works under the hood:

It’s not just another webcam viewer. I built a backend system that pulls fresh images from every available LTA traffic camera around Woodlands and Tuas every 5 minutes.

Instead of just displaying them, I pass these images through a custom-trained Computer Vision (AI) model.

Quantifying the Jam: The AI looks at each specific camera view (e.g., the Causeway Bridge vs. the Checkpoint Approach) and quantifies the congestion level. It doesn't just say ""jammed""; it tracks trends like, ""Camera 2701: Traffic congestion increased from clear to moderate over the last 10 minutes.""

Data Fusion: I then take this visual AI data and fuse it with real-time travel time data from the Google Maps API.

The Result: A highly accurate, ""confidence-weighted"" estimate of the actual travel time. If Google says it's clear, but my AI sees a breakdown on the BKE flyover camera, the system adjusts the forecast instantly.

I also threw in the practical stuff we always forget, like a dynamic 3/4 Tank Rule reminder (it actually checks if the lanes leading out of SG are active) and current VEP info.

The Missing Piece: I need your help with Malaysia

Right now, the system is incredibly accurate on the Singapore side because the LTA camera network is open and reliable.

Here is my biggest hurdle: Once you cross the midpoint of the causeway and enter the Johor Bahru CIQ (Customs, Immigration, and Quarantine) complex, my AI goes blind.

I have struggled to find reliable, publicly accessible, real-time camera feeds inside or immediately approaching the Malaysian customs regions for both Woodlands (JB CIQ) and Tuas (Second Link complex).

My ask to the community: Does anyone know of hidden, official, or reliable sources for live traffic images on the MY side of the border?

If I can get access to those image feeds, I can train my AI model on that terrain. This would allow the system to give accurate ""Malaysia to Singapore"" estimates, accounting for those infamous jams inside the JB customs building that Google Maps often misses.

Looking for feedback

This has been a long solo grind, and I’m really keen to hear what actual drivers think.

I probably gonna seem very dumb to some, but if I can save one person from doing something similar, this is worth it.

Just gonna explain what I mean by sharing what happened to me:

A few weeks ago, I finally decided to clean out the trash bins from my kitchen, because despite using trash bags (most of the time), they were still disgusting and had coffee grounds and other things stuck at the bottom.

So, I put some liquid soap in them, pured some hot water in them in my shower and let them soak in there, which was my mistake.

See, my plan was to pour them out in my toilet, but for some reason, when I remembered them after a few hours, I completely went on autopilot and _poured them out in my shower_ .
This meant that I clocked up the drains of my shower and, for the next few weeks, I could only turn on the water in my shower for a few seconds at a time, because the water would drain very slowly.

I should have put the trash bins right next to the toilet instead of leaving them in the shower. Luckily, my Dad was able to help me getting everything out of my shower drains, but having to wash my hair in this conditions where definitely a learning experience.

1p3tkmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1p3tkmf/my_job_as_a_firefighter_living_in_a_cursed_town/,My Job As a Firefighter Living in a Cursed Town,"I’ve spent my entire life in my hometown. It's where I was born, where I grew up, and is probably where I will die. To some people this sounds like a miserable existence, but honestly, I don't think I’d have it any other way.

My Town had an industrial boom once, but that time came and went long before I was ever born. Only the old-timers remember that era now, and even then, most of them were only around for the tail end of it. The rest of us only know this Town for what it has since become: a ghost of its former self, marred by the rusting titan of a bygone age that now looms over our home like a dead sentinel, its hollow body a symbol of what once was, and what will never be again. Our Town rests in that immense shadow now, aching and pleading to once again feel the sunlight that will forever be obscured by its past. 

But hey, it’s home.

My lifelong dedication to this Town is what made me want to become a firefighter. I wanted to give back to the community that shaped me, and the best way I could think to do this was to join the local fire department. That was going on twenty years ago now, and in that time I’ve seen and experienced things, both on and off the job, that most people would struggle to believe. But I guess that comes with the territory of living in a cursed town.

Everybody who lives here learns at a young age that something isn’t right about this place. One day you become old enough to realize that other towns you visit aren’t quite like the one you call home; they don’t carry that familiar layer of darkness that seems to envelop you like a blanket every time you cross back over our Town’s borders after spending time away. Other towns don’t feel like they’re perpetually cold and cloudy, even on hot summer days. They don’t come with that overwhelming sense that they should have passed into the realm of forgotten history generations ago, but are kept alive by a stubborn populace that refuses to move away and leave them in the past. Most “outsiders” who visit The Town can often feel this shift right away, and usually with greater intensity, since they’re not properly acclimated by years spent beneath The Town’s oppressive weight. It’s for this reason that visitors typically try to stay in The Town for as little time as possible, and why any moving trucks that come here tend to arrive empty.

Some people say The Town has been like this since the beginning of time, destined to inherit its curse since before it was even brought into existence all those many years ago. Others say it acquired the curse through some horrible event, and that it was once just like any other forgettable American small town. I don’t know which theory I subscribe to; on one hand, I can’t see why this land would be so infested with evil for no discernable reason, but on the other, it’s difficult to see The Town as anything other than the source of malice and misery that I’ve always known it to be. The least popular belief of the bunch is that The Town isn’t cursed at all, and that all of the misfortunes herein are merely the spawn of cruel coincidence. There are fewer and fewer followers of this model every year, and soon it will likely go completely extinct.

When searching for the specific occurrence that kicked off The Town’s long string of woes, many of those who believe in Theory B point to an incident that occurred at the turn of the twentieth century; those who follow Theory A merely see this event as a symptom of the much older rot that infests this place. Either way, both agree that the event in question is directly connected to the darkness that lives here.

It happened in the old coal mine, which at the time was one of the major pillars of The Town’s economy. A terrible fire broke out in the mine, the source of which is still debated to this day. The inferno turned the wooden supports above the miners’ heads to ash and caused several collapses inside of the main shaft. Eleven miners were trapped inside for four long days while the townsfolk worked tirelessly to dig through the rubble in order to rescue them. By the time they had reached the miners, all eleven of them were dead. Five of them had suffocated, slain by the toxic air and rancid smoke created by the raging blaze, while three of them were crushed in the shaft collapse. The bodies of the remaining three, however, were never found. It is still speculated as to what became of them, and everybody who you ask has their own theory. I’ll allow you to come up with your own.

The collapse that had doomed those miners also did the same thing to the fire, smothering the blaze so that by the time the townsfolk made it into the collapsed shaft, all that remained of the terrible inferno was a few dying embers. Despite little damage actually being done to the mine itself, it never managed to recover from this disastrous event. Any attempts to reopen it were met with further tragedy. More inexplicable fires broke out, and any new shafts excavated quickly collapsed, often entombing fresh victims in a coffin of furious earth. More strange were the miners who continued to vanish without a trace,  much like the three who had disappeared during that initial devastation. There were reports of men disappearing mid-conversation with their constituents, who turned away for a mere moment to take a sip of water or wipe sweat from their brows, only to turn back and see that their companions were gone, seemingly plucked out of space or dragged into the nearby darkness without so much as a sound. Eventually all of the miners, understandably scared for their lives, wound up moving on to new work, and The Town could not find anybody willing to replace them. After years of attempts to rehabilitate the mine, it was finally shut down for good, thus rendering one of The Town’s main economic stimulants officially deceased.

But though the mine is abandoned and in disuse, that does not mean it remains inactive.

Random fires spring up in that mine at least once a year, despite it remaining empty and free of any activity that would potentially cause such ignitions. In the interest of preventing our town from becoming another Centralia, our department, as well as all those in the surrounding area, work together to extinguish these blazes as they come up. The Town has an entire taskforce in place that monitors the mine for fire activity, and when any is spotted, they immediately dispatch us to the scene. Sometimes we manage to put out the blaze in a few minutes; other times we spend hours battling the fresh inferno that seems intent on taking the entire Town with it into the deepest pits of ruin.

At this point, I feel like I have some kind of sixth sense that allows me to anticipate the mine calls a couple of days in advance. I get a tightness in my stomach that continues to twist like an old wind up toy until it finally snaps. Despite seeing it coming, it ruins my day all the same when that call comes in over dispatch.  I hate returning to that horrible place. The invisible miasma of suffering that I feel in there is sometimes strong enough to make me nauseous within a matter of minutes, and I always get the strange sense that there is something watching me from somewhere deeper in the cavern. Every time we’re there, I fully expect to turn away from one of my companions for a mere moment only to turn back and find that they have disappeared, the charged hoseline they were handling now dancing crazily on the dirty ground as it violently discharges water without guidance or reason. This hasn’t ever happened, but that doesn’t mean that it never will. It could even end up being *me* that gets spirited away into the wanting gloom, dragged by some unseen force that doesn’t even award me the luxury of a final scream. I suppose only time will tell.

Practitioners of Theory B who present the mine disaster as the source of the Town’s curse purport that something old and evil was dug up from the earth on that fateful day well over a century ago, and while I am not entirely sold on such a tale, I admit that it’s hard to argue against it considering all that I’ve experienced down there. That mine is a dark, hellish place, and I shudder to think that anywhere in this world could embody so much natural animosity. It’s strangely more comforting to think that some event kickstarted the decades of concentrated malice that radiate from it, instead of believing that such putrid energy has been there from the start. Maybe an evil contained within the oldest stones of this planet since time immemorial isn’t much better than that same presence being free from the start, but clearly there is enough of a distinction there that it’s created a schism between the townsfolk, so I suppose it does make some kind of difference in the minds of the people.

But the mine isn’t the only place of great and concentrated misfortune in this Town, and thus is not the only potential source for the curse that Option B folk point to. I’d be remiss not to also talk about the old steel mill, which, while now long empty, used to work in tandem with the mine in order to fuel this Town’s former prosperity, much like how the mine fueled the mill’s once-hot furnaces. It saddens me to think that those same furnaces will never know such heat again.

The mill, once a thriving colossus of its day, suffered greatly following the mine incident. Without a constant flow of coal coming in from the mine, the mill’s productivity began to slow. Coal, much like the ore that was refined within the mill, began coming in from other mines in the area. This kept the mill afloat for a few more good decades, but it also made operating the mill more expensive, and as money and resources dried up, so too did the prosperity that this great mastodon of its age had once enjoyed. The mill managed to chug along at a decent pace until the mid-1950s, when its viability finally ran out. By then, the Town had long-since given up its dream of returning to the height of its industrial glory, but nobody wanted to tell that to the old mill. They allowed the poor thing to continue believing it made a difference right up until the very end.

Further tragedy struck on the mill’s final day of operation. A disgruntled millworker, devastated and desperate from the news of the mill’s closure, forced his way into the foreman’s office and gunned the man down without so much as a word. The millworker slew four more of his peers before he was finally subdued. He would never see the inside of a jail cell for his barbaric act; his fellow millworkers, riled into a cocktail of rage, took turns attacking the unarmed and defeated man. They beat him so badly that he perished right there on the office floor. It’s unknown if his killers were ever prosecuted for what they did.

This final act in the mill’s long tenure seems to have marked it as a place of darkness that rivals that of the mine. In the years that followed its closure, rumors persisted that the empty old structure became a place of devil worship and depraved acts of unspeakable sin. Whether or not these events ever did or still do take place is unclear, but this doesn’t stop us from getting called out to the mill several times a year. Usually we’re there to investigate a recurring and mysterious burning smell, only for us to arrive and find that the mill’s old furnaces are as cold as ever. First responders that have been called to the mill over the years have reported that they’ve seen dark figures of shadow and subtly shifting silhouettes deep within the bowels of the old building. I’ve personally heard strange, mechanical noises echoing through the mill’s ghostly, abandoned passageways, and have sworn to everybody I’ve told this to that I once heard the rattling report of a gunshot coming from the direction of what was once the foreman’s office.

There are those who believe that the victims of that tragic day, including the murderer himself, continue to work an endless shift in their old place of employment, even though operations there came to an end many decades ago. Some townsfolk leave them containers of food and thermoses of coffee at the mill’s entrance, only to return the next day to find these vessels emptied of their contents. While I can’t confidently say that I know who is enjoying these free meals, I highly doubt there is a person in Town who would dare to steal food from those old millworkers.

The misfortunes of The Town are not isolated to these two sepulchers of the past. While the mine and the mill only see occasional activity, there are other goings on in this Town that affect the townsfolk much more frequently, and, in turn, affect my department more frequently as well.

Everybody who lives in The Town, without exception, gets into at least one automobile accident per year. Most of these are small fender benders, which is the kind of accident that everybody prays for. Some of them are significantly worse. The worse ones are the ones that *we* have to respond to, and they often aren’t pretty.

The plus side to this is that everybody in Town is incredibly friendly and understanding at the scene of a collision. Two guys back into each other while pulling out of their parking spaces at the grocery store? They laugh it off and may even buy each other a beer that night as a way of saying thanks for being their accident that year. An old woman side swipes a young man’s car and takes out his driver’s side mirror? Well, hey, at least his arm wasn’t sticking out of the window at the time. Everybody’s cars are perpetually dinged up and insurance rates in our Town are through the roof, but people are just happy when their accident turns out to be relatively minor. Of course, there are those few unfortunates who wind up in *two* accidents in a year, which really is a testament to their bad luck more than it is to the town’s curse. There’s always that nagging feeling in the back of your mind after you’ve been in what you believe to be your accident: was this *actually* my accident for the year, or am I going to be severely disappointed in a few months? Some people arrive at an unfortunate answer to this question down the line.

A rather large river runs through the heart of Town. Once a key waterway for shipping ore and metals in and out of Town, it has become much more of a liability in the decades since that industry’s demise. Any and all rain can and often does lead to severe and sudden flooding, resulting in many residents being trapped if they’re anywhere near the river when some unexpected bad weather hits. It is for this reason that our fire department requires that members have several different water rescue certifications under their belt, because they’re definitely going to need them. We pull dozens of people out of the water every year. Many of them are still alive when we do it.

An old, neglected railroad track stretches along the outskirts of Town, extending for untold miles in two directions as it passes through the seemingly endless expanse of dense, dark forest that surrounds our Town on all sides. The track hasn’t been in use for going on thirty years now — not since they created the new line that passes through all the bigger and more important communities to the north — but that doesn’t stop creatures from showing up in dead, gore-strewn heaps on or near the tracks on a semi-regular basis. Deer are usually mostly intact, but smaller animals like foxes and raccoons are lucky if we’re able to tell what species they are based on the carcass they leave behind. Nobody can properly explain how these animals suffer such violent deaths in such close proximity to the abandoned tracks, but the popular legend is that there’s a phantom train still running back and forth along the line at night, never able to reach its destination but also not able to return to where it began. Sometimes it even comes to a stop, and if you climb aboard, you’re whisked away to the land of the departed, never to be seen by any of us again until the day we step beyond the threshold of death. I suppose this is preferable to the alternative encounter you could have with such a train; I’ve seen what that thing can do, and it’s not a pretty sight — especially not when the victim has a familiar face.

Disease seems to spread exceptionally easily here. A simple strain of the common cold can knock half of the community out of commission for several weeks, and has the power to halt life in Town for long stretches of time in the colder months. Drive through Town on a random week in February, and you’d think we had abandoned the place like we already should have done a long time ago. There have been a number of times where the fire department has been stripped to a mere fraction of its normal workforce thanks to a particularly stubborn infestation of flu that decides  to linger in our station for upwards of a month. In these situations, we pretty much all end up catching it — the most debilitated by the disease get to take some time off to recover, but those of us whose immune systems put in overtime are rewarded by getting to work some overtime of our own, all while trying to convince ourselves that we’re not about to keel over at any minute from the agony of the disease that we’re just barely able to fight off. The mine hasn’t been quite cruel enough to set itself ablaze during one of these bouts of illness, at least not while I’ve been working at the department, and I pray that it never develops enough of a malevolent streak to test such a thing out. I’m not exaggerating when I say that such an occurrence could easily spell the end for our little Town.

Death is a large part of life here. Without looking up any statistics, I’m willing to bet that we bury at least twice as many dead each year as any of the nearby towns, all of which are double our size. Demise comes in many forms here; there are a surprisingly high number of ways that a life can be lost in a Town this relatively small. There are the “expected” deaths — the kind of things that the Town macabrely anticipates each year, like drownings during river floods or folks perishing in an especially bad yearly car accident — but there are plenty of strange and mysterious deaths that nobody is able to wrap their head around. Being a firefighter, I’ve witnessed the aftermath of a good number of these strange deaths myself, and have spent more nights than I can count falling asleep while trying to solve their unsolvable mysteries in my troubled mind. Folks have returned home to find their healthy loved ones sitting at the kitchen table, midway through a meal that they will never finish, their deaths seeming to have come simply because the Reaper was having a slow day. Grocery store workers have gone missing for the better part of a week, only to be found wide-eyed and blue, trapped in a freezer that had been used countless times in the days since their absence, and from which food had been placed on shelves and then subsequently purchased by customers. Tiny, loving lapdogs that don’t even seem physically capable of harming another living creature have suddenly snapped for just long enough to bury their little teeth into their owners’ necks, hitting just the right spot to make their victims bleed out within a matter of minutes.

Death comes for everybody here, young and old and sick and healthy alike. Most of the time it strikes at random, but it does follow a few recognizable patterns that everybody in Town recognizes and accepts. Without going into detail, I’ll say this: There is a reason that people in this Town try not to grow too attached to their firstborn children.

I could go on. I could tell you every single detail of every single strange occurrence in this Town, but if I haven’t managed to convince you that it’s cursed by now, then I doubt that I’m going to. I was never really trying to convince anybody of anything by sharing these stories in the first place. My goal was just to highlight a place largely forgotten by time, but still very much deserving of recognition, both for all that it has endured over the generations, as well as for all that it has accomplished. And though these accomplishments might remain cold and buried beneath a dark and heavy past, the pride that they inspire is still very much present in all who live here. There is a reason that so many of us who live in this Town are lifers, and it’s not just because the economic downturn in this region has made it difficult for people to escape it. There are plenty of folks here who wouldn’t leave the Town, curse and all, if given the chance, and I count myself among them. That very well could be the curse itself talking; it’s possible that it’s so deeply rooted within our minds and souls and culture that it tricks us into thinking that we actually enjoy living in this miserable, little corner of America, but if this is the case, then I have no intention of fighting it.

My Town is certainly not an easy place to live in. Something lurks here; something festers. And it likes to remind us all that it’s here with us. But like I said earlier, this Town is still home.

For the last couple of days I’ve been getting that familiar twisting in my gut again: the one that warns me of a coming fire down in the old mine. We haven’t had one yet this year, so we’re definitely overdue. If people are interested, maybe after the fire I can share more stories about my Town (assuming the thing that is in the mine doesn’t actually take me this time). But in the meantime, I’ll leave you with something that’s been on my mind lately, and what actually encouraged me to share these stories in the first place.

I had the upsetting realization recently that some day, maybe some day relatively soon, my Town is going to be gone. It’s going to be forgotten. Some day it will be abandoned, either because the economy took too great of a tumble, or the mine fire finally became too great for us to combat, or simply because that one last stubborn holdout of a resident finally decided that putting up with this dying place just wasn’t worth the effort anymore. Regardless of how it goes down, I know the simple truth is that we likely won’t be here forever.

So I just ask that you do your best to remember the places and the people that the world has forgotten about. Do your best to keep their memory alive in some way. Because despite every hardship that the curse inflicts on this Town, I still believe the worst thing that could ever happen to it would be if nobody even remembers that it was ever here at all.",3,1763819044.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1
I turned down bringing caramel latte to my husband's childhood sweetheart—all because I was in a hurry to get home and take care of my mother-in-law.
On the phone, Claire Sutton's voice was thick with sobs:
""Chloe, won't you even drive over with a drink for me?
My low blood sugar's acting up—I'm about to pass out.""
""Can't you just order delivery? Is that so hard?""
I replied, and hung up the phone in confusion.
That evening, my husband, Stephen Holt, scolded me:
""In order to save money, she went home hungry, and then fainted on the road.""
I was completely baffled:
""Couldn't she ask someone else to buy it for her?""
""You're right.""
Stephen agreed in a gentle voice, bringing a piece of pastry to her.
I took a bite, then lost consciousness instantly. When I opened my eyes again, I was locked in a small, airtight basement.
Stephen's face appeared on a monitor. He was feeding Claire in his arms caramel latte.
""Didn't you say ordering delivery was easy?
Go ahead and order one—let me see.""
My phone had been taken, leaving me with no way to contact the outside world.
Through the camera, my weakened state was broadcast to the public. ""Mrs. Holt's Hunger Challenge"" became a trending topic online.
The entire internet was mocking this wealthy family's drama.
I leaned against the wall and stared at him calmly.
""Stephen, I hope you enjoy this meal, because it might be your last full one.""
***
The moment I finished speaking, the general comments scrolled frantically.
[This rich lady's just putting on a tough act! 'Last meal'? She should worry about herself!]
[Exactly, she wouldn't even buy someone a cup of coffee. Mrs. Holt is so cruel.]
[People like them could never understand what our lives.]
[I bet she won't last three days before she's on her knees begging!]
I didn't know how many days I'd been locked up. Intense dizziness and the burning pain of an empty stomach blurred my vision.
My lips were already cracked from dehydration—every wretched moment captured by the camera.
Claire picked up a piece of cake, putting on an act.
""Stephen, I know fainting from low blood sugar was terrible.""
""But maybe Chloe didn't do it on purpose. What if she starves?""
""Let's give her my latte. There are still some left.""
I remembered Claire's voice on the phone—loud and full of energy. Nothing like someone with low blood sugar.
Stephen sneered:
""Don't give it to her. You're always too considerate, that's why people take advantage of you.""
""You fainted from low blood sugar yourself, and you're still worried about whether she's hungry.""
""She's used to eating luxury foodstuff all the time. A few days without food won't kill her.""
""I won't give her any food, unless she apologizes to you.""
Watching Stephen's gentle and attentive manner toward Claire on the screen, I felt numb about the cramping in my stomach.
That tenderness once was mine.
Once, he'd panic if I frowned, doing everything to make me smile.
He remembered all my favorite things and gave me surprise from time to time.
He would decline all social engagements just to spend more time with me.
He once promised me that he would never let me suffer any grievance.
But now, he could coldly watch me starve for another woman.
But my eyes were burning, and I couldn't squeeze out a single tear, maybe it was because I hadn't had a drop of water for so long.
On the screen, Stephen stared at me, his brow furrowing.
Seeing this, Claire spoke up at the right moment, her eyes misty with tears:
""Stephen, when I fainted on the roadside that time, I kept telling myself maybe Chloe was just too busy to get to me.""
""Later I found out she was free, she just didn't want to buy it for me...""
Stephen's expression, which had just softened, instantly turned cold again:
""Chloe, you are rich but still so stingy. If you don't admit your mistake, then continue to endure it.""
""We're enjoying our meal here, and I can't neglect you. You also have a 'good meal' to enjoy.""
As soon as he finished speaking, the ventilation duct suddenly activated.
Waves of stench flooded in—sewage, rotting food, sour decay… a sickening mix that filled the room.
I couldn't stop gagging, retching on the floor. But with nothing in my stomach for so long, all I could bring up was green bile.
The bitter, acidic liquid burned my throat, and I couldn't stop the tears from streaming down my face.
On the screen, Claire was feasting, giggling sweetly.
""Stephen, this steak is delicious, and this pastry, it's sweet but not cloying. No wonder Chloe likes it so much.""
Those were all things Stephen used to go to great lengths to prepare for me whenever I was angry.
Now, someone else was enjoying that same treatment.
I closed my eyes, not wanting to watch anymore.
Stephen's cold voice came through the speaker.
""Chloe, you still have a chance. Apologize to Claire and admit your mistake.""
""If you behave, I can still give you something to eat.""
I slowly opened my eyes, staring straight at the camera.
""Stephen, I just hope you never regret what you're doing right now.""
Chapter 2
Chapter 2
Stephen flinched under my gaze, then became furious from embarrassment.
""Chloe, how dare you glare at me!!""
""It seems you haven't learned your lesson!
You're never getting any of this food!""
""I'd rather throw this food away!
I will never let you taste it, even a single bite!""
With that, he grabbed the steak from the table and tossed it straight into the trash can.
I could only watch helplessly as the food was wasted, my stomach cramping even worse.
""Stephen, why not let the dog eat it? If Chloe can't have it, an animal can.""
Claire suggested.
Soon, a golden retriever was led over, wagging its tail and licking the food scraps off the floor.
Claire looked at me and said with fake sympathy:
""Chloe, just say sorry to me, and promise to bring me whatever I want next time.""
""If you do, Stephen will let you out. Why torture yourself like this?""
I scoffed:
""I did nothing wrong. Why should I apologize to a bitch like you?""
""And run errands for you?
Do you really think you're that special to deserve it?""
These words pushed Stephen over the edge.
Claire immediately put on an innocent act.
""Stephen, don't blame Chloe.""
""She probably can't imagine how weak I felt from low blood sugar—so she thinks she did nothing wrong.""
""Fine. Perfect.""
The last trace of warmth on Stephen's face vanished completely.
He turned to the camera, his voice ice-cold:
""Since she's so stubborn... Doctor, come here. Draw her blood!""
""Let her feel exactly what it's like when Claire has low blood sugar!""
The door was pushed open.
Two people in white coats walked in, holding syringes and blood bags.
""Don't touch me!""
I struggled with all my might, scrambling backward with my hands and feet.
But in this small space, there was nowhere for me to run.
Hunger had left my limbs weak—soon, I was pinned to the floor, unable to move.
A thick needle pierced my vein.
One bag, two bags, three bags...
My vision began to blur, and the world started spinning.
The live stream's general comments exploded:
[Holy shit!
Mr. Holt is insane!
He's playing for such high stakes!
Let's see if she still acts tough!]
[So satisfying!
Bitches like her who doesn't know what's good for her deserves to be taught a lesson like this!]
[Drain her dry!
Make her beg for mercy!]
But some viewers started to worry:
[Isn't this going to kill her?]
Stephen saw the general comments and explained:
""Don't worry, she's hooked up to a vital signs monitor. We'll know immediately if something goes wrong.""
""I won't let her die. I just want to teach her a lesson.""
My lips were completely pale, black spots dancing in front of my eyes, and my whole body was about to collapse.
On the screen, Stephen frowned at my wretched state—like he was starting to feel guilty.
Claire immediately grabbed his hand, her eyes welling with tears:
""Stephen, this is exactly how I felt when I fainted on the roadside from low blood sugar—so weak, I couldn't move…""
""Chloe should understand how I felt now. Next time... next time she won't be so unsympathetic, right?""
Her few words extinguished that tiny flicker of hesitation in Stephen's heart.
His gaze hardened again:
""Chloe, this is just the beginning.
If you don't apologize, I have plenty of ways to punish you.""
""We'll see then what breaks first, your stubbornness or my methods!""
I collapsed on the cold floor, too weak to lift even a finger.
The needle mark on my arm still throbbed faintly.
I couldn't help but remember the time I accidentally nicked my hand while cutting fruit—it was just a tiny cut.
But Stephen had scooped me up in a panic and rushed to the hospital, yelling at the doctors like a madman.
He'd said he couldn't bear to see me hurt—even a little.
And now?
Turns out the difference between being loved and not was like black and white.
I closed my eyes, not wanting anyone to see my vulnerability.
In the general comments, mocking remarks were still scrolling frantically.
Everyone was certain I wouldn't make it through the night.
Just then, an anonymous user suddenly flooded the screen with a hundred million ""premium virtual gifts.""
Rows of golden comments bulldozed over all the others, dominating the entire screen.
【I believe Mrs. Holt will pull through.】
Chapter 3
Chapter 3
The golden special effects nearly covered Stephen and Claire's faces.
The general comments went wild.
【Damn! Who's this mystery tycoon? Dropping a hundred million premium virtual gifts just like that?】
【That's a good show. Mr. Holt looks furious.】
【Must be Chloe's sugar daddy, tsk tsk, Mr. Holt is totally being cheated on.】
【Bullshit! Couldn't it be a random rich guy who can't stand Stephen's crap? Rich bro, Venmo me fifty, I'll help you curse him out!】
The live stream's sentiments slipped out of Stephen's control.
He stared intently at the scrolling messages on the screen, his face turning from pale to ashen, then to dark with rage.
Stephen eyes that once looked at me so gently were now stabbing daggers at me through the camera.
""Chloe, how many men are you sleeping with behind my back?""
I tugged at my pale lips, too weak to even manage a smile.
My silence, in his eyes, was an admission of guilt.
""Fine. Just fine.""
The last shred of sanity in his eyes burned away with his rage. He radiated menacing madness.
""You think you're tough, don't you? Let me help you, let's see just how tough you can be.""
""Turn the air conditioning down to the lowest setting!""
As soon as he spoke, the vents kicked on, and the temperature in the basement plummeted.
My body, already cold from excessive blood loss, now felt as if it had been thrown directly into an ice cellar.
I curled up on the floor, my teeth chattering uncontrollably.
""Stephen.""
Claire said, tugging his sleeve with fake worry.
""Chloe's already in bad shape—she'll freeze to death like this.""
She spoke with concern, but the look she gave the camera was filled with glee.
Stephen shook her hand off, his voice dripping with ice.
""Isn't she supposed to be so capable?""
""I'd like to see when she'll finally realize her mistake!""
Hunger, blood loss, and bitter cold.
Under this triple torment, my consciousness began to fade.
The scene before me started to blur and double.
Stephen's grimace and Claire's triumphant grin swirling together before blurring into nothingness.
""Beep—beep—beep—""
The medical monitor attached to me began to alarm.
On the other side of the screen, Stephen finally panicked.
""What's happening? Doctor! Check the data, quickly!""
The doctor's frantic voice came through the livestream:
""Mr. Holt! The patient's vital signs are dropping rapidly!""
""Bradycardia, hypotension, and her body temperature has fallen below the critical line.""
""This is severe hypothermia and hypovolemic shock. She needs an urgent energy supplement!""
Stephen frantically grabbed the prepared honey lemon water and turned to rush out the door.
""Stephen, let me help you!""
Claire cried out and stood up as well.
She reached for the cup, but her foot ""accidentally"" slipped, and she lunged forward.
""Splash—""
The warm honey lemon water spilled all over the floor, not a single drop left.
Stephen stared at the mess on the floor and suddenly erupted in anger:
""What the hell are you doing?!""

Chapter 4
Claire fell to the floor, looking up with teary eyes, her shoulders trembling slightly.
""I'm sorry, Stephen, I didn't mean it.""
""I was just in a hurry to bring Chloe a drink, I didn't expect to trip...""
She sniffled softly after speaking.
Stephen froze for a second, then sighed, pulling her into his arms to comfort her gently.
Watching this little drama unfold, I pulled myself up against the wall, catching my breath.
Seeing that I was ""fine"" again, the concern in Stephen's eyes was instantly replaced by mockery.
""Chloe, you're quite the actress.""
""You look perfectly healthy to me. Why don't we continue?""
Nested in his arms, Claire added fuel to the fire.
""Stephen, I told you Chloe was faking it. She just wants you to feel sorry for her.""
I stared at his hypocritical face and laughed.
""Stephen.""
""When I get out of here, we're getting a divorce.""
The smile on Stephen's face froze. Then, a towering rage erupted from his eyes.
""A divorce?""
He laughed in fury, a terrifying hostility radiating from him.
""Fine, Chloe. You've got guts.""
He clapped his hands, his voice cold as poison.
""Guards, come here. Isn't she hungry?
Bring up the late-night snack I prepared specially for her.""
A bodyguard quickly brought over a covered tray.
Stephen uncovered it himself, and a foul, fishy stench hit me.
""This is your favorite beef jerky. I prepared it especially for you.""
The general comments section exploded:
[Holy shit!
That's not beef jerky, those are rat heads, aren't they?]
[Has Stephen lost his mind?!
This is a live stream!
What the hell is he trying to do?!]
[Disgusting! I'm gonna throw up!
And Claire is just laughing over there!]
Stephen pinched my chin, forcing me to look at the tray.
""Eat it.""
""I gave you a chance, but you didn't take it. You just had to make a scene.""
""Today, I'll show you the consequences of defying me!""
Two bodyguards held down my shoulders, pinning me in place.
Claire followed them in. Wearing ten-centimeter high heels, she ""accidentally"" stepped on the back of my hand.
""Chloe, hurry up and eat.""
""Look how much Stephen cares about you—he's afraid you'll starve, so he's feeding you personally.""
""Unlike me, I'm so unlucky—I don't even get to eat what I want.""
The thin heel of her high heel ground viciously into my knuckles. I convulsed in pain, unable to make a sound.
The bodyguards stepped forward to pry my mouth open.
I used the last of my strength to clench my jaw shut.
""Still resisting!""
Stephen was enraged. He stepped in himself, roughly prying at my cheeks.
""Don't hold back!
Pry it open!""
My already weak body was no match for three adults.
My mouth was forced open, and those hairy ""beef jerky"" pieces were shoved inside.
One, two, three...
I couldn't stop retching, blood oozing from my mouth.
""Boss, there's no more room in her mouth.""
The bodyguard said, looking uneasy.
Stephen had completely lost his mind:
""If it won't fit in the top mouth, stuff it in the 'bottom mouth'!""
""Besides, who knows how many men she's slept with outside? A few more 'beef jerky' won't matter!""
With that, in front of everyone on the live stream, he began to rip at my dress.
I clutched tightly at my dress, shaking like a leaf from fear.
Was I about to become the first person to be force-fed ""beef jerky"" live in front of the entire country?
The live stream fell silent for a moment, then erupted into a frenzy!
[Mr. Holt!
You're wild as hell!
You, are my god!]
CRASH—!
The basement door was violently broken open from the outside.
""Stephen!""
""Do you have a death wish?!""

1p3thj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/zoloft/comments/1p3thj3/my_experience_questions_about_it/,My experience / questions about it,"Hi all

I have a year follow up appointment in two weeks and was wondering what to expect / if my experience with this medication has been normal. 

I am on 50 mg and have been since last November. Started on 25 and was bumped to 50 after a month with initial complaints of severe depression and anxiety. Since then I have felt so much better! My depression I would say has completely gone away, my thoughts have quieted down. I don’t find myself dwelling on my trauma anymore. (I was disassociating all day everyday). I’ve started going out again and desiring company. It’s been great…. in the depression department lol. 

My anxiety though, I feel has turned into possibly panic disorder. I’ve had episodes of numb hands and feet, tingling of my mouth area, heart rate going over 110… I’m also EXTREMELY caffeine sensitive now, which I never was before. I had to switch to decaf because my morning coffees were triggering panic attacks :( 

I guess my question is - is this because zoloft may not be the right medication for me? Will I have to ween off of Zoloft and try another medication? I really don’t want to deal with withdrawals / side effects of a new med… but I will if that means my anxiety/panic will be treated. Has anyone else experienced this? Will a higher dose of Zoloft treat this? I’ve read a lot that 25-50mg is the pediatric dose.

Thanks. ",1,1763818801.0,zoloft,1,1.0,False

Here’s the exact system.,"I just had the most brutal wake-up call of my adult life and I’m still shaking writing this.
For years I was THAT girl: aesthetic Notion dashboards, 5am club, ice baths, the full discipline Pinterest fantasy. I’d go hard for 2–3 weeks, feel unstoppable, then completely implode for a month and hate myself. Rinse and repeat since 2018.

Last month I almost deleted Reddit because I felt like the biggest fake in this entire sub.
Then I tried something so ridiculously simple I almost laughed at myself… and it completely ended the cycle.
I stopped trying to “be disciplined” and started treating Future Me like a spoiled, high-maintenance celebrity who pays me $10 million a year to be her personal assistant.
Dead serious.

Future Me wants to wake up at 5:30? Present Me preps everything the night before like I’m working for Beyoncé: clothes laid out, coffee timer set, AirPods charged, playlist queued.
Future Me wants a clean apartment? Present Me does the 7-minute “leave the hotel room” cleanup before bed because that diva is NOT walking into chaos.
Future Me wants 10k steps + 30 pages of reading? Present Me negotiates with Current Lazy Me like a Hollywood agent: “We’ll walk if we can listen to 2014 throwback pop and gossip podcasts, cool?”

I literally talk to myself like I’m terrified of getting fired by the most important client I’ll ever have (because that client is me tomorrow).
Results after 31 days:

• Hit every non-negotiable on 29/31 days (a record that has literally never happened)
• Down 11 lbs without one official “diet day”
• Finished 4 books
• Zero shame spirals. Zero.

The wild part? It barely feels like effort anymore. Failing now feels like screwing over someone I love and respect—not “being lazy again.”
If you’re trapped in the same start-crash-hate loop, try this for 7 days. Treat Future You like the highest-paying, most demanding client of your life.
Your only job today is to not get fired by tomorrow’s you.

Processo washed tradizionale ma con una sosta di fermentazione anaerobica con mosto di frutta (melone, anguria e fragola).

Estrazione V60 abbastanza tradizionale con ricetta standard (28 g di caffè, 420 g di acqua osmotizzata 95 gradi, macinato con Timemore C2), da qui farò delle variazioni in base all’assaggio.

Per essere colombiano ha un bouquet più vario di quanto ci si aspetti ma la cultivar e la zona si fanno sentire, senza far spiccare le note fruttate al naso.

Sul foglietto parla di note di pesca e fragoline di bosco che ritengo un po’ ambiziose. L’acidità di frutta è molto buona, che rimane lunga sui lati della lingua. La frutta c’è ma non direi di poter indicare una varietà specifica se non la buccia di melone, esteri con note leggermente terrose. Ha un buon corpo, devo giocare un po’ con il macinino per accentuare l’effetto juicy, sicuramente proverò anche in aeropress.

I started my coffee journey as a home brewer and somehow weirdly my dream job was either a barista or coffee roaster.I got my degree in hospitality and SCA certification before starting my ""dream"" job as a full time barista.

I joined a cafe in another state because of the owner who is a well known personality in my country's  coffee circle.I got to learn a lot like from enhancing my sensory skills to having able to change the brightness,sweetness,body etc from a same process ( still not 100%) but as she is a known  coffee person she is always traveling for work but still gives the cafe good time.


My senior is a backstabbing brutus.He on one side tells the owner that when we don't reach the daily Target he himself puts money in the cash drawer while he very smartly is stealing money like he himself goes to our vendors for syrups and stuff and entering wrong prices on system to  balance the monthly balance sheet.I want to tell this so badly to the owner but after that it would be hell for me as I would be the only barista left on that shift.

Secondly whenever the owner is not around he takes half days and even fullday off on the most selling days.This month he has not even done a full day shift on Monday and Tuesday (highest selling).the only other person other than us is another shift barista who helps me a lot to handle this guy.the worse thing is that this guy haven't told the owner about this and I am afraid to tell this as it would ruin my paid off days.


Thirdly, he doesn't even know how to talk to customers and doesn't even know how to handle manual bars like talking to people while brewing or having custom requests like different ratios and stuff.he doesn't even acknowledge it and whenever someone asks about a certain drink's containt he says 'my junior here will explain '.I cannot even go to lunch break due to this.everh Monday and Tuesday I don't eat due as there is no one to cover my shift.

So for context, I (now 51 yr old) have only had 1 boyfriend in my life, when I was 17.  I have been alone the rest of my life.  I never understood why (the usual - friends telling me I'm pleasant, funny, sweet. I'm nice looking when I do myself up like for a date, and while I don't do myself up to the nines for things like everyday work,  I do dress nice, wear light makeup, do my hair, etc).

She felt very familiar somehow, even though I'd never seen her before.
 “Yep I really like caramel apples, haven't had one in a while though. mmm… you made me hungry for one.”
 “So you just dip an apple in boiling sugar and then eat it?”
 “Well I don't make caramel apples but yeah that's basically it”
 “Weird…”
 The tree I was sitting on was filled with purple flower buds, yet to bloom. Similar trees surrounded us as far as I could see. There was a sweet smell in the air, it felt very nostalgic.
 ""So you're a fairy or something?""
 ""Or something,"" she said with a playful grin, ""So do you like to spread the butter on the bread before dipping it in the coffee or do you just have a spoonful of butter after the bread?"" The fairy asked while fluttering around my head.
 ""Wait, wait, wait.... what am I doing in a forest, talking to some fairy while sitting on some magical tree?""
 ""You're the one who's dreaming, How would I know?"" She said while making an exaggerated confused expression and tilting her head slightly to the right.
 pfft of course, I am dreaming.
 Suddenly I felt weird, a wave of drowsiness washed over me.
 ""Ahh that's right! Morning is just around the corner, you have to go now. See you later Rey."" And with a wink she disappeared.
 I then realised I was traveling through a blindingly bright tunnel at an impossible speed and then everything went blank. I was awake.
 “What a weird dream” I thought out loud groggily.
 I was lying on my bed and it was just so warm and comfy… I tried to go back sleep but,
 “Wake up ya sleepyhead, can't spend the entire day sleeping!”
 sigh… It's Mom.
 “I'm up!”

 I got up from bed and did a little stretching routine, and then practiced some basic elementary spells and mana exercises to really wake me up. I had work to do today.
 Tomorrow I'd be taking the train to Lerubis—a big city about 500 miles from town, all the way in Gingerson County —to study at Quirmise University. Yeah you heard it right The Quirmise University, the leading institute in Magic and Natural Science in the country. All supreme mages—which is the highest ranked mage—of our country, and quite a few of other ones too, had been alumni of Quirmise.
 I still couldn't believe I'd gotten in. I wasn't a genius or anything, but I was fortunate that my brother was one and could guide me.
 I'd just received the acceptance letter the other day and since then I'd received from all the townsfolk lots of congratulations. — and of course comparisons to my 'Genius' brother, Jack.
 Dilshire wasn't a major station and if I missed tomorrow's train I'll have to wait another three weeks before the next one. Too risky.
 The whole day I spent visiting neighbours and friends telling them that I'll be leaving tomorrow and wishing them goodbye.

 To celebrate my achievement we had a special dinner tonight. Goose curry with flatbread. Prepared by the one and only Mama Mia.
 At the dinner table my little sister Lomra looked very somber and had been giving me accusatory glances, in contrast Mom and Dad were over the moon, walking on sunshine ever since they had received the good news, they'd now be able to brag to other parents how two of their children went to Quirmise. That was thought to be almost impossible for a non-mage family like ours.
 I asked Lomra what was up after we had dinner.
 ""So you'll leave like Djume and Jack, Rey? I thought you wouldn't leave."" Lomra said while playing with the tablecloth.
 ""Sorry lil one, I have to go, but whenever I come back I'll bring lots of sweets—and souvenirs too while we're at it. I promise."" I said and gave her an apologetic smile.
 She  walked away to her room without any acknowledgement.
 Darn it!
 Though at first I thought she's just being spoiled, her last remark made me feel guilty.
 I was the same age when Jack had left and felt the same way back then. It must've been even more difficult for Lomra, she'll now have none of her brothers with her.
  I'll make it up to her. Maybe by helping her get into Quirmise. 
I thought with a grin on my face.

 I wished Mom and Dad good night and went back to my room to finish up packing. 
 I wouldn't be carrying much, just some clothes, a water bottle and a few jars of pickles that Dad made for me. After a few finishing touches I closed the suitcase shut. 
 I was very excited for tomorrow, I'd be attending frickin’ Quirmise University, and was probably gonna see Jack again, sooner or later.
 I could barely sleep with all the butterflies in my stomach. So I decided to practice a little magic. Simple elementary spells and some mana exercises helped me calm down my nerves a bit.
 When I woke up in the morning it felt like I had just closed my eyes and went to sleep.
 No fairies tonight, huh.
 I don't know why but I felt something was wrong. A sense of loss was heavy in my stomach, not because I'll be leaving home today, no, I was looking forward to that.

**Here's the breakdown:**



1. Analysts estimate what a company will earn over the next year
2. You divide the current stock price by that projected earnings number
3. The result tells you how much you're paying for each dollar of future earnings



**The ranges that matter:**



* Forward P/E of 15-25 = Fair value for most companies
* Below 15 = Possibly undervalued (or the market sees trouble ahead)
* Above 25 = High expectations (growth stock or overvalued)



**Why this matters:**



Backward P/E tells you what happened. Forward P/E tells you what the market expects to happen.



If Visa trades at a Forward P/E of 20 for 2026, you're paying $20 for every $1 of earnings they're expected to generate next year.



The key question: Are those future earnings realistic?



That's where your research comes in.



Simple, right? Understanding what you're actually paying for is half the battle in investing.

All in one Raid.,"Morning after a long night shift i booted up my rig ready to see what was in store. Right off the bat I knew it was going to be a good day a fresh hour with the Matriarch. 

I loaded in Jupitar and Anvil in hand ready to give this bitch a run and go for that coveted blueprint. 5 minutes late, no big deal and then I hear it. That glorious whine of that bastard already getting peppered, this is it. 

I find my spot in a small apartment structure with no walls and a clear view of my prey, face shield already cracked that shining red core glistening back at me, I start cracking away from a safe distance racking up that beautiful arc damage when it happens.

That sound every raider knows and hates, the stitcher laying into me. The damned noise, I couldn't hear the small padded steps of a rat in this chaos. I roll a single shot left in my Jupiter in hand, I spin the whine of the energy rifle charges and it connects! The flare of his cracked shield in orange and blue speckles gives me a spot of hope. Switching to my anvil i slide and take a shot from one in the same, this is it one last chance to take mine or my run is over. 

It misses, the rat prevails when suddenly a wasp and hornet duo descend on him I curse his name and family as I cheer on the arc. Crawling to the nearest bush to watch my spiteful spectacle hoping the arc succeed in taking out some human scum, conflict inside rages, am I just like the Arc or is this rat?

A small voice breaks me out of my thought and this race against death in front of me.

""Did someone get downed over here?!"" (That idiotic voice changer but still he's looking for me)

""Over here!!"" I shout into my headset still stinking and sweaty from last nights shift.

""I thought i heard a flare over here"" he says with that beautiful needle of friendship already in hand (Dizzyness is his name this hero deserves the spotlight)

""I'm so close to dying thank you, there is a rat around here"" and as if spawned from the depths of hell he appears stitcher in hand aimed at my new friend Dizz

\*BEEEEEEEEEP\* That sound created a surge of adrenaline and dad energy to do what needed to be done.

\*HEADSHOT\* my nineties brain in quake announcer voice says, that rat rolls into a bush.

As if the heavens aimed it themselves i took my next shot into that bush.....\*POP\* \*WHOOSH\*

That raider flare felt like justice served my friend saved me and i got to return it in kind but its not over, the screech of the Matriarch reminded me of the hill still needing to be climbed.

I found my fellow raiders holed up at the Warehouse complex on Blue Gate, comradery, communication, and collaboration filled to air. I was one Jupiter among many raining hate into its red gullet. 

Two wolfpacks as if counted down simultaneously screamed its barrage toward the rocketeer, its fiery remains scattered the battlefield in an instant. That's when flame started to arise from the Matriarch, the end was near.

After several more barrages of Jupiters and hullcrackers filled the air the day was won, the reactor blew with a stunning flash of light and flame erupted from its core and the voice chat crackled with elation and cheers from the teamwork of the raiders.

Without notice weapons away everyone ran toward the pile of treasures they couldn't wait to dive into. As one raider started to chomp on a leg of the fallen king a familiar cry rang through the air of a chilling Bastion, before he knew it that raider's flare was lighting up the sky. 

  
Back to it i think, and i start cracking Jupiter shots into its weak ass knees. As my fellow raiders start throwing all manner of explosives. We managed to kill her and save that poor swiss cheese raider.

But alas no good deed goes unpunished, it was all gone maybe an arc alloy here or there but the blueprint, cores, those sweet big arc cells that make the big chargers, nothing.

As I dig through the pile and the realization hits me I hear another voice"" Hey Spaceman""

I look into my monitor...... Hey I'm a spaceman. I turn around to look at him in game dumb founded.

""Still looking for that blueprint?"" he asks me, my heart pumping with Mtn dew and coffee to get me through the night. 

""YES!!!"" I Voip back with elation and then it just drops, as if it was a throw away penny. Koalaphant, I hope you see this cause you make my entire Arc raiders run. I was you to my friends giving away all the goodies I already acquired but that was the first time someone has done it for me like that, Thank you so much.

I looked and slammed my ""E"" key like I was playing half of the original Mario Party 64 mini-games and it pops into the last spot of my inventory. I Proceed to tell him the story of my epic rat fight when i see a familiar name in the VIOP list, Dizzyness. He was right there listening to me recount the whole thing and expressed his wonder as to why I was looking around so much on the Revive. 

As we walk back recounting on a fantastic time with strangers and comradery Koalaphant gives some solid advice when taking on the Matriarch, ""Stick with the herd"".

So I write this no less than 20 minutes after by far my favorite raid I have had topside. 

Thank you for this weird awesome community Arc Raiders. You are truly one of a kind.

  
Tldr: A rat jumped me on a matriarch run but thanks to the power of teamwork and weirdos we killed the rat, murdered the matriarch, and I got gifted the blueprint after helping save a fellow greedy raider.",28,1763817580.0,ARC_Raiders,10,0.85,False

1p3t0kh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerInfoSupport/comments/1p3t0kh/scanxiety_why_waiting_for_scan_results_is_so_hard/,“Scanxiety”: why waiting for scan results is so hard (and small things that can help),"Many people say the worst part of cancer isn’t the chemo or radiation – it’s waiting for scan results.

There’s even a word for it: **scanxiety** (scan + anxiety).

Some reasons it hits so hard:

* You feel like your whole future depends on a few lines in a report
* You have less control – you have to wait
* It can bring back memories of the first diagnosis
* You may feel pressure to “be positive” when you’re actually terrified

Nothing completely removes that feeling, but a few small things *sometimes* help people:

* **Ask when and how you’ll get results**
   * Exact date or approximate time frame
   * Will the doctor call you, or do you need to book an appointment?
* **Plan the day of the scan and the result day in advance**
   * Who comes with you?
   * Something small but nice after (coffee, a walk, favourite food).
* **Use a “worry parking lot”**
   * When your mind spirals, write down the worry on your phone or in your notebook.
   * Tell yourself: “I’ll look at this later, not right now.”
   * It doesn’t fix it, but sometimes helps break the loop.
* **Limit Dr Google**
   * It’s normal to search, but endless reading of worst-case stories usually makes anxiety worse, not better.
* **Tell one safe person how you really feel**
   * You don’t have to be “strong” 24/7.
   * Saying “I’m scared” out loud is not a weakness.

If scanxiety is overwhelming, affecting sleep or daily functioning, it’s absolutely okay to ask your doctor for:

* Referral to a psycho-oncologist / counsellor
* Temporary medication support for anxiety or sleep (if appropriate)

You are not “overreacting” – waiting is genuinely hard.

So comments ive seen online & things that to me only come just up/completely flipped the script. Shed never insinuated jordan didnt pull his weight around the house til now? Like chores & kids  wise mainly since hes sahd? 

A sahd threatening shed have to pay alimony hed get the kids and going to go for half the business after partner cheated wouldnt be abuse if it was a sahm?

The fight of him being upset, finding out about it? How  she met up with and had dinner with marciano behind his back. Where she just cries and says why are you treating me like this and hes like because of what you did , how was this abusive? Anyone crashing out about being cheated on and finding that out paired with a production crew obviously trying to give the cheating spouse  the better edit would look the same or worse.

Is it even real? I was under the impression their marriage was open. The whole time, i forget why season 1 but jen & hers fight at the coffee shop about halloween she said i know about ur marriage stop tryna include me n zac in ur sick shit & miranda this season saying she sympathises because she knows how hard the divorce process is for couples who dont have traditional marriages. I believe both confirming that thought but seems to not be what jessis trying to present to us? 

Him cheating was briefly mentioned in like a talkover & mayci said about it at bbq which was edited v weird unless my internet he like went to say something then it like cut to him talking to like taylor ? Didnt see it mentioned anywhere else throughout which seems weird when the girls are pointing out his faults theyd miss it or how maycid miss that bit in the recap she gave jessi?

The abuse for months, years ? How long is she alleging? Because it seems to of come out of no where and seems abit crazy. To cheat on someone say its cos theyre a shit partner to them but theyll stay if they pick up their game & saying they cant promise if they will speak to affair partner again after being busted going behind their partners back with affair partner for lie test that was iffy resulty hotel hang then dinner. She even tried to pretend the girls were there for most of it which did not appear to be case at all. I think all of that and everything she says about him contributing nothing having no moneu bein bad husband her bein so great doin it all is abusive af??? As a sahm i would not cop that from my partner id be like thanks for the nudge back into the workforce & fixing the ""empty""nest grief😂

I thought we didnt see all that much of him like obvi more then usual but people seem to be chatting like he was up heaps yelling at her n stuff ? 

This about how doing the chores, the kids, jz and the show?? Im struggling seeing her even do jz and the show ? I wouldve believed if shed of said they had a maid or whatnot once or twice a week which id fully believe but that not really tbh 

Just seen a comment on a post about him grabbing their kid and telling him that theyre getting a divorce and its mums fault, wow is it tru what ep n when ? It doesnt matter cos thats very wrong pretty much regardless of context, my internet made up for them giving jessi great edit and gave him a great edit😂

While im here omg demis hair first time getting on screen, atleast jessi NEVER had her look like that. It was like it hadnt been dont since and she had no idea what to with it, had to chance to of atleast had healthy hair with all that regrowth lol

She’s a professional, responsible, and licensed in her field. She & her husband have been together for 4 yrs. Out of nowhere, she told me that her husband started pushing a fantasy on her, he wanted to share her. 

It began with him asking her to do cybersex with other men. She didn’t want to, but she agreed because she loved him and thought, “Maybe it’s harmless.” But slowly, her self-image started to crumble. Instead of feeling empowered, she began feeling dirty. Meanwhile, her husband framed it as something that would boost her confidence.

Then it escalated. He asked her to send photos and videos to other men, convincing her with lines like, “They like you,” and “They love your body.” Over time, he pushed even further. He started looking for a man she could “grab coffee with” but the truth is he wanted it to go beyond that. It wasn’t just coffee, he wanted her to get physically intimate with someone else. 

This might be a kink for him, but for her, it felt like she was cheating. She never wanted any of it. That’s why she opened up to me snd honestly,I really feel sorry for her. But at the end of the day, she’s the only one who has the power to put a stop to her husband’s behavior. 

Thankfully, she finally opened her eyes and chose to stand by her own values. She stopped letting her husband manipulate her into doing things thst were breaking her emotionally.Now, she has decided to unchain her heart from a man who used her and took advantage of her love. She still cares for him deeply, but she no longer sees a future with him and she’s deeply disappointed in the man she once chose.

YOUR WIFE WAS ALSO A CHILD ONCE, A LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS LOVED DEEPLY BY HER FAMILY. SHE WAS RAISED WITH VALUES, RESPECT, AND LOVE. SHE GREW UP PROTECTED BY PEOPLE WHO CHERISHED HER, PEOPLE WHO MADE SURE SHE WAS SAFE IN EVERY WAY.

AND NOW YOU THE PERSON SHE TRUSTED THE MOST, THE MAN SHE CHOSE TO LOVE, THE MAN SHE BELIEVED WOULD PROTECT HER!  YOU WANT TO PUSH HER INTO SOMETHING THAT BREAKS HER, CONFUSES HER, AND DESTROYS HER SELF-WORTH? WAKE UP!

This isn’t kink-shaming.But if your kink is something your partner doesn’t want, respect that. Healthy relationships require consent, comfort, and mutual respect not pressure,guilt,or manipulation. ",8,1763816759.0,MayConfessionAko,4,1.0,False

    Meridian Crew: Wolfborn, Trust, and Found Family
    
    
    
    The *Dockside Knot* hummed with the particular lethargy of a space station bar at late evening—low neon bleeding into stale beer and the collective exhaustion of a thousand rotations. Raz sat at the end of the counter with his boots planted wide, jacket shrugged off one shoulder, the fabric catching on the ridge of scarred muscle underneath.
    
    He drank slow. Mechanical. Efficient.
    
    His eyes were half-lidded in that way that meant he was actually tracking every sound in the room—the scrape of chair legs, the irregular pattern of breathing three tables back, the hum of the pressure seals that never quite cycled right. A wolf's senses didn't shut off just because you tried to blend in. They catalogued everything, whether you wanted them to or not.
    
    Behind him, someone scraped a chair too hard.
    
    Raz didn't turn. Just let one ear angle a fraction toward the noise—the subtle shift of something that looked relaxed but was actually coiled. His knuckle tapped the bar once, twice. The bartender, a weathered human with a cybernetic eye, clocked the signal and went very still.
    
    The tap meant: *watch this*.
    
    Raz had been coming to this station for three years, and he'd learned that a two-tap protocol was better than violence. It said *I know you're backing me*. It meant he didn't have to go full feral if this went sideways.
    
    ""Hey—wolfborn. You think you're better'n everyone else?""
    
    The voice came slurred, stupid-brave. The kind of drunk that thought loudness was the same as strength. Raz took another quiet drink. The bottle clinked soft against the counter—steady, deliberate. His shoulders stayed relaxed, one ankle crossing behind the other. He looked like a man at rest.
    
    He looked like a man who had handled worse before breakfast.
    
    He had. Last Tuesday, actually. A contractor dispute three docks over.
    
    ""Talking to you, mutt.""
    
    Now Raz sighed.
    
    Not annoyed—just tired of this exact pattern of stupidity, wearing itself out like an old recording. In another life, he might've ignored it. Back when he was younger, more hopeful, he would've turned, explained that he wasn't looking for trouble. Would've offered to buy the man a drink and talked him down.
    
    But three years of that taught him something: people didn't want explanation. They wanted to feel powerful. The best gift you could give them was quick resolution—make them feel like they'd had their say, then move on.
    
    He set his bottle down carefully and turned his head a single degree, just enough for one eye to catch the idiot's reflection in the polished metal of the bar rail. Behind him, the man's hand was already reaching. Raz could smell him—cheap synthohol and desperation and the particular scent of someone who'd lost something he'd never bothered to appreciate.
    
    *Yeah,* Raz thought. *That kind of drunk, that calls you mutt.*
    
    Raz moved before the fingers touched fabric.
    
    It wasn't violent in the way violence usually announces itself. It was just efficient—one boot, heavy and work-worn with steel in the toe, drove straight into the man's groin with a thud that cut the bar noise in half. The idiot folded like a dropped curtain, all the air leaving him in a single, gasping wheeze.
    
    Chairs scraped. Someone muttered ""oof."" The bartender didn't even look up from his glass.
    
    Raz nudged the collapsed body aside with his heel, clearing floor-space like he was shifting a toolbox out of the way. The man was already trying to curl on his side, hands shaking.
    
    Then Raz picked up his beer again, took a drink, and finally spoke—only to the bartender.
    
    ""He'll breathe,"" he said, his voice dry as station dust. ""Eventually. Maybe give him some water in about ten minutes. He'll be sore, but nothing's broken.""
    
    The bartender slid Raz a fresh bottle with a tiny nod—the kind of gesture that meant *good work* and *please don't do it again* in the same breath. Raz accepted it, shoulders settling, ears easing back to neutral. Peace restored. The neon hummed on, indifferent.
    
    He drank the new bottle slowly, methodically, the taste mechanical on his tongue.
    
    This was the problem with being wolfborn. People saw the size, the teeth, the way scent worked on him, and they either wanted to fight you or fuck you. They wanted you to be the monster in the story or the savior. Nobody wanted you to just be tired. Nobody wanted you to just want a quiet drink before heading to your ship.
    
    One more hour, he told himself. Then he'd be off-station. Then he'd be in the black, where the only people he had to manage were people who'd *already* decided to trust him.
    
    He finished the bottle, set it down, and didn't think about how long it had been since that trust was earned instead of just assumed.
    
    ---
    
    Meanwhile, three docking bays distant, Ben was staring at his wristpad like it contained answers it didn't actually have.
    
    *Three days,* Dinee's last message read. *Don't panic. I'm bringing the wrong shoes and twice too many stories. See you soon.*
    
    He'd read it seventeen times. Maybe eighteen. He lost count somewhere around the engineering diagnostics he wasn't actually completing, his hands moving through the motions of work while his mind orbited something else entirely.
    
    Ben had worked with Raz for five years now. Had seen the captain go through two relationships that crashed and burned when people realized the alpha pheromones were just window dressing, that underneath was a man terrified of taking up space. Had watched him contract tighter and tighter, pulling inward, until he was barely visible in his own life.
    
    Three weeks ago, Raz had told him LO-vis was boarding.
    
    Ben had recognized the tone of voice—the one Raz used when he was terrified but too tired to keep lying about it. Had asked, neutrally, if that was a problem or an opportunity. And Raz had gone very quiet, which meant it was both.
    
    Now, checking diagnostics on a ship that was about to haul three people through the dark in tight quarters, Ben found himself thinking: *Please let this one work. Please let him finally figure out that he's worth staying for.*
    
    And simultaneously: *I hope I figure that out too.*
    
    Dinee was coming in three days. After six months of messages stretched between star stations, waiting for orbits to align, she was finally boarding the *Meridian*. They'd been careful with each other online—playful, yes, but also honest about fears and uncertainties. But online was easy. Online was just voice and words and the distance that made vulnerability feel safe.
    
    Face to face was different. Face to face was real.
    
    Ben's hands moved through the diagnostic sequence—checking seals, running systems, doing the work that kept the ship alive. But his thoughts kept circling back to Dinee, to Raz and LO-vis, to the way people could want something so badly that they forgot how to breathe around it.
    
    His wristpad buzzed.
    
    Another message: *""Getting nervous. Is that weird? I'm nervous. What if it's different in person? What if I'm boring without the screens between us?""*
    
    Ben smiled, even as his own anxiety spiked in response. Same fear. Same hope.
    
    He typed back: *""You could never be boring. Trust me on this.""*
    
    Then he considered the work ahead—a month of tight quarters, three people learning each other's rhythms, all the small vulnerabilities that came from proximity. He thought about Raz finally letting someone close, thought about what that might mean for the captain's carefully managed life.
    
    And he thought: *Yeah. Trust. That's the thing. Everything else follows from that.*
    
    ---
    
    The docking tunnel at Loomis Station smelled of ozone and cleaning agents, but beneath it—if you had the nose for it—a thousand other scents layered underneath. Metal and fear. Stale coffee and anticipation. Oil. Sweat. The ghost of every person who'd walked through here chasing something they weren't sure they'd find.
    
    Raz knew that smell. He carried it home with him.
    
    He strode through the tunnel with his boots heavy on the steel grid, each footfall deliberate and grounding. His duffel was slung across one shoulder, and his grey-streaked hair brushed his collar—unruly against the amber station lights that made everything look like it was already tired. Each passing worker nodded as he walked, and he answered each with a quiet dip of his head—habitual, steadying, the kind of gesture that said *I see you* without asking for anything in return.
    
    At Dock 7, two figures waited.
    
    Ben was leaning on a battered crate, rubbing sleep from his jaw in that particular way that meant he'd been awake for at least eighteen hours—maybe more. His wristpad glowed with half-finished diagnostics, and there was grease under his fingernails. He'd already been working on the ship before Raz arrived. Of course he had.
    
    But Ben was grinning underneath the exhaustion—a real grin, the kind that said *I'm glad you're here*, and Raz felt something in his chest ease just slightly. This one was solid. This one stayed.
    
    LO-vis stood apart from Ben, arms folded, one boot toe tapping against the deck—whether from impatience or nerves, Raz couldn't quite tell yet. She was scrolling through something on her wristpad, but her eyes kept flickering toward the dock entrance, tracking arrivals. The way her shoulders shifted when she caught sight of him said everything about her internal state. She'd been waiting. Counting down.
    
    As Raz drew near, both glanced up simultaneously, like they'd been counting down his arrival.
    
    Ben's shoulders eased immediately, his eyes creasing at the corners—relief, genuine and unguarded. The kind of look that said *thank god*, the quiet gratitude of someone who'd been holding tension for hours and could finally let it go.
    
    LO-vis, though—LO-vis just breathed deeper, and something in her face smoothed out, an almost involuntary calm settling into her posture like she'd been holding tension she could finally release.
    
    Raz felt it in his chest, that familiar pull. The weight you carry when people trust you to get them home.
    
    ""Glad you made it,"" he said, his voice low and warm but edged with the kind of exhaustion that came from two weeks of paperwork and bureaucratic nonsense. ""Ship's prepped, but she'll want a gentle hand on the drive—till we finish your magic, Ben.""
    
    Ben grinned, pushing off from the crate. ""I'll treat her like a sleepwalker—promise. Good to see you, Raz. Didn't think you'd get this much hair grey already."" He reached out and clasped Raz's shoulder, squeezing hard—affection and confirmation both. *You're here. You're real. We're doing this.*
    
    Raz returned the grip, then let Ben go. They'd worked together for five years. Ben had seen Raz at his worst—paranoid, angry, convinced that his presence was toxic to anyone who got too close. Ben had stuck around anyway.
    
    His gaze flicked to LO-vis, measuring—taking in the way she stood, the set of her shoulders, the particular shade of tension around her eyes. He'd met her once, briefly, two months ago on a job. She'd been wound tight then too, but it was different. That had been *anxiety*. This was *anticipation*.
    
    ""LO-vis,"" he said, offering a nod. ""Good to see you again.""
    
    She shifted, just enough to catch the movement, then tucked one of her dark curls behind an ear. She was watching his hands more than his eyes—reading him the way he was reading her.
    
    ""Everything checks out on paper,"" she said, her voice crisp and professional—masking something underneath. Something that tasted like nervousness mixed with determination. ""You running the route plan tight, or do we get room to breathe this trip?""
    
    It was a test. Raz recognized it immediately. She was asking: *Are we going to be okay together in tight spaces? Are you stable?*
    
    He took his time answering, letting her see that he was considering the question seriously.
    
    ""You'll have time,"" he said, his tone steady and reassuring in a way that made both of them visibly relax. ""It's a month at crawl before the jump. Plenty to fix what needs fixing. The drive's solid; Ben's just being thorough."" He paused, dropping his voice slightly, making it more personal. ""And—you two need time to get used to each other again. This isn't just a job. We're going to be locked in tight quarters for a month. That's a different rhythm.""
    
    Ben made a small sound of agreement. LO-vis's shoulders eased down by another increment.
    
    The three of them stood in the neon half-light, the hum of station life muffled and distant. As Raz triggered the hatch, it cycled open with a long, familiar hiss—and a hint of home spilled out. Machine oil and wool. The faint tang of new sweat and the particular metallic scent that belonged to his ship and his ship alone. The smell of *waiting*.
    
    Ben's tension faded visibly, his hands loosening as if he'd been holding something tight that was finally safe to release. The relief on his face was stark. This was where he belonged. This was his element.
    
    LO-vis, for just a moment, forgot to guard her expression—and what showed underneath was raw and honest and a little bit afraid. She wanted this to work. Raz could smell it on her—the hope that tasted like copper and electricity.
    
    Raz's heart beat slow and steady as he watched them cross the threshold into the airlock. Every sense sharpened, cataloging their moods in the language he'd learned to read before he could write. Ben's brittle hope—the hope of someone who'd been hurt before and was trying again. LO-vis's worry edged with something that might have been trust, or might have been the echo of something more complicated.
    
    It anchored him—reminding, quietly but firmly, that saving others from loss had become the only way he kept his own at bay.
    
    ""Come on,"" he said gently, his voice carrying all the steadiness he could offer. ""Let's get you both settled. We've got work to do, but there's time.""
    
    Together, they stepped inside. The hatch closed behind them, sealing them into the long dark of the ship's interior. Raz heard Ben exhale—a sound like finally letting go. Heard LO-vis take in the space, reading the ship the way pilots did, calculating dimensions and possibilities.
    
    The work—and the bond—began.
    
    ---
    
    ## **SIGNALS & VULNERABILITY**
    
    Air hissed as the dock cycled shut. The anteroom was suddenly smaller, more intimate, the walls pressing close in a way that made everything feel significant. Raz checked systems by muscle memory while his eyes tracked LO-vis—catching every tap of her foot, every breath she held a beat too long.
    
    Her hand gripped her duffel bag like a lifeline, knuckles pale. Her scent was shifting—not sickness, not fear exactly, but something close to it. Anxiety. The particular tang of someone's pheromones when they're about to be vulnerable.
    
    She shifted closer, as if to say something, then looked away. Her lips pressed thin. The lights threw narrow shadows between them, and Raz could taste her nervousness like copper on his tongue.
    
    He finished the lock sequence and turned to face her fully, deliberately giving her his complete attention.
    
    ""You alright, LO-vis?"" His voice was careful, low—the kind of careful that said he meant it. ""You smell… off. Not sick—nervous. That's not your baseline. If we're stuck in here for months, best to clear the air now. I need to know what I'm working with.""
    
    LO-vis's shoulders rose, then dropped. She seemed to gather herself, forcing a breath. Her fingers drummed against her bag—a nervous rhythm that spoke volumes about her internal state.
    
    ""Yeah,"" she said finally. ""I'm... it's not... I'm not afraid of you, if that's what you're thinking.""
    
    ""I wasn't,"" Raz said quietly. ""But you didn't answer the question.""
    
    She nodded slowly, acknowledging the point. She reached out—her fingertips brushing his shoulder, quick and featherlight, then gone. The contact lasted less than a second, but it carried weight. It was asking permission for what came next.
    
    ""Raz,"" she said, and her voice wavered just slightly. ""Last time we were together—the job two months ago—I didn't handle things well. I mean, I handled *work* fine. The job was solid. But the rest of it...""
    
    She trailed off, collecting herself.
    
    ""I brought something,"" she continued, pulling a small brown bottle from her jacket. The label caught the station lights—medical, official. ""It's Zadine. Pheromone blocker. We used it at the lab for what they called 'diplomatic' projects. Basically, situations where natural biology couldn't be allowed to run the decision-making.""
    
    Raz stared at the bottle, his immediate instinct a spike of something that tasted like rejection. Then he waited, because she wasn't done.
    
    ""I'm not bringing it because I don't trust you,"" she said, meeting his eyes directly. ""I'm bringing it because I don't trust myself. Last time, I couldn't tell what was real. And I spent a week after—after I left—trying to convince myself it was just your pheromones. That I was just responding to alpha markers like some kind of animal instead of... instead of actually choosing you.""
    
    She paused, and her voice got smaller.
    
    ""So I brought this. And I'm asking—should I take it? Or is that... is that insulting?""
    
    Raz was quiet for a long moment. He looked at the bottle, then at her face—at the courage it took to ask that question, to be that honest about her own doubt and need for verification.
    
    ""What do you want?"" he asked finally.
    
    ""I want to know it's real,"" she said. ""I want to feel you without wondering if I'm just a puppet dancing on pheromone strings. I want to come aboard your ship and spend a month here and know that whatever happens between us—or doesn't happen—is actually *me* choosing it, not my lizard brain reacting to your biology.""
    
    Raz nodded slowly. He understood that. He'd spent most of his life wondering if people liked him or if they just liked what he *was*.
    
    ""Then yes,"" he said. ""Take it. And I..."" He paused, choosing his words carefully. ""I want you to know that I'm terrified. That I've spent my whole life keeping distance because anything else feels like a lie. People respond to the alpha thing, and I can never tell if they'd want me if I couldn't make their pheromones sing.""
    
    LO-vis's eyes softened.
    
    ""I know,"" she said quietly. ""Ben told me. He said you pull away every time someone gets close.""
    
    Raz felt a spike of complicated emotion—gratitude and frustration mixed together. Ben should've kept that to himself. Except... except maybe he shouldn't have. Maybe it was good that LO-vis knew. Maybe it meant she was choosing from a position of actual knowledge.
    
    ""So,"" she continued, ""we're both scared. We're both wondering if this is real. And I want to find out the same way you do—without the pheromone interference. Fair?""
    
    ""Fair,"" Raz agreed. ""Take the pill. Come back in an hour. And we'll... we'll see what's real.""
    
    She smiled then—small, brave, full of anticipation.
    
    ""Okay,"" she said. She tucked the bottle back into her jacket. ""I'll go find Ben, make sure he's actually sleeping. Give the Zadine time to work its way into my system.""
    
    ""LO-vis,"" Raz said before she could leave.
    
    She turned back.
    
    ""Thank you,"" he said, and he meant it with every part of himself. ""For being honest. For not pretending this is simpler than it is.""
    
    She nodded, and something in her face settled. She ducked through the hatchway toward crew quarters, and Raz watched her go, rolling her words over in his mind.
    
    *Fair.* She'd said fair. That meant she was willing to meet him in the middle. That meant maybe, just maybe, this could be real.
    
    He leaned against the wall and let himself hope.
    
    ---
    
    In the galley twenty minutes later, Ben sat with his cooling coffee, pretending to scroll diagnostics on his wristpad. Through the aperture between galley and crew corridor, he caught sight of LO-vis moving past—her movements purposeful, her energy different than before.
    
    Something had happened. Something had *shifted*.
    
    Ben watched her disappear into crew quarters, then grinned to himself. *They're doing it,* he thought. *They're actually having the conversation instead of just circling it.*
    
    He'd been waiting for this—not voyeuristically, but because... well, because he knew what it meant when someone finally stopped running from connection. It meant it was possible. It meant there was hope.
    
    His wristpad chimed. Message from Dinee.
    
    *""I'm pacing my quarters again. Tell me something good. Tell me this works, Ben. Tell me you want me there as much as I want to be there.""*
    
    Ben's fingers moved across the screen, composing an answer that felt true:
    
    *""I want you here so much it's terrifying. And yeah, it works. I'm watching someone figure it out right now—that you can actually choose to trust, that vulnerability doesn't have to mean weakness. So yeah. Come. Let's figure this out.""*
    
    He sent it, then sat back with his coffee. Around him, the ship hummed its steady rhythm, and somewhere down the corridor, two people were daring to find out if something built on honesty could actually hold up to proximity.
    
    Ben believed it could.
    
    ---
    
    ## **INTIMACY & TRUST**
    
    The galley was small and utilitarian, all stainless steel and efficient angles. The hum of the drive faded into background noise as the ship settled into her cruising rhythm—a steady, meditative pulse that made thinking easier.
    
    Raz poured three coffees methodically—two black, one sweet for Ben, who liked honey in everything—and set out a battered box of station donuts he'd picked up at the last market. The coffee smelled like home. The donuts smelled like possibility.
    
    He sat at the worn bench seat and waited.
    
    LO-vis appeared about forty minutes later, moving slowly, deliberately. She was still in her travel clothes, hair pulled back, the tight set to her shoulders ease just slightly. She slid into the seat across from him and picked up the coffee gently, as if it might shatter.
    
    ""How long?"" Raz asked.
    
    ""Twenty minutes,"" she said. ""Doc said it would take about thirty to fully integrate, but I can feel the difference. It's like... static clearing. Does that make sense?""
    
    Raz nodded. He understood synergistic responses—his biology worked fast too.
    
    Ben grinned, snagged a donut, exchanged a few easy words that were clearly for show, and then excused himself with exaggerated casualness. ""Engine diagnostics won't run themselves,"" he said, already rifling through his tool kit as he vanished down the corridor toward engineering.
    
    The message was clear: *you two have space now*.
    
    Alone, Raz caught the shift immediately.
    
    LO-vis's breathing deepened. Her gaze flickered to his face, then away. Her hands trembled slightly as she lifted the coffee to her lips.
    
    ""It's quieter,"" she said softly. ""Without the pheromone noise. I can actually think. I can feel... I can feel what I actually feel, and it's—"" She paused, searching for words. ""It's not less. If anything, it's more. Because I know it's me now.""
    
    Raz leaned forward, his elbows on the table. ""What does the real you feel?""
    
    She met his eyes then, and the honesty in her gaze was like being struck.
    
    ""Nervous,"" she said. ""But not scared of you. Scared of myself. Scared that I want this too much. Scared that if it goes wrong, it'll wreck the whole trip.""
    
    ""Or scared that it might go right?"" Raz offered quietly.
    
    ""That too,"" she admitted.
    
    He reached across the table slowly—giving her time to pull away if she wanted to. His hand came to rest near hers, not touching, just present. An offer.
    
    ""Here's what I know,"" he said. ""I've done this before—the pheromone thing, the people responding to what I am. And it's always been hollow. People want the alpha, the protection, the safety that comes with being with someone strong. But they don't want *me*. The scared part. The part that's tired of carrying everyone else's hope.""
    
    He paused.
    
    ""You brought the pill,"" he continued. ""You wanted the truth. That tells me you're willing to see me without the biology running the show. That's... that's something I haven't had before.""
    
    LO-vis's hand slid across the table and covered his. Her touch was warm, grounding.
    
    ""I had sex with someone once,"" she said quietly. ""Because they had pheromones like yours. Wolf-something. And afterward, they just... left. Like what we'd done was separate from who I was. Like I was just a response to what they were, not a person they actually wanted.""
    
    She looked up at him. ""I came here because I wanted to know if it could be different. If I could be different. If *you* could be different.""
    
    ""Can I?"" Raz asked.
    
    ""I think so,"" she said. ""I think you want to be. I can see it in how you hold yourself. Like you're trying not to take up too much space.""
    
    Raz had nothing to say to that. She was right. He'd been trying not to exist fully for so long, he wasn't sure he remembered how to anymore.
    
    ""So here's what I'm proposing,"" LO-vis continued, her voice gaining strength. ""We spend this month—this month in tight quarters—and we actually try. We don't assume. We don't let the biology do the work. We actually see if there's something here besides the pheromones.""
    
    ""And when we get back?"" Raz asked.
    
    ""We figure it out,"" she said simply. ""But I'd like to try.""
    
    She squeezed his hand, and Raz felt something tight in his chest finally ease.
    
    ""Okay,"" he said. ""Let's try.""
    
    ---
    
    Days passed in subtle escalation.
    
    The galley counter. The corridor passing. The bridge during shift changes. Each moment built on the last, a careful escalation of touches and glances that charged the air between them.
    
    One evening, standing at the counter in the galley, Raz scrubbed a plate with unnecessary attention to detail—giving his hands something to do, giving himself an excuse to slow time. Outside the porthole, stars wheeled past, indifferent to the gravity drawing him and LO-vis toward each other.
    
    LO-vis leaned nearby, her shoulder brushing the steel edge of the counter. She was ostensibly reviewing something on her wristpad, but her attention kept drifting toward him.
    
    She reached past him for the sugar—her hand close enough to graze his wrist. Neither of them moved for a breath. The scent of coffee and ozone coiled in the air between them, thick and charged.
    
    Time hung suspended.
    
    ""You're dripping water on your boots,"" she said eventually, her voice low and teasing.
    
    Raz looked down. He was. He'd been standing there, plate half-washed, not actually moving.
    
    ""Observant,"" he said, but he didn't stop. Didn't lower his hand. Just held it there in the water, waiting.
    
    She didn't move either. Her hand stayed near his, the space between them alive with possibility.
    
    ""Careful, captain,"" she said, her voice dropping lower, more intimate. ""If you keep standing that close, the pills might not help. The static interference might break through.""
    
    Raz smiled, slow—just a flash of teeth. He finally moved his hand, setting the plate down, but he only stepped back half a step. His eyes lingered on hers, golden in the dim oven glow meant to simulate evening. His voice dropped, gentle but edged with something that tasted like daring.
    
    ""Maybe I want to see what's real—pills or not,"" he said. ""Maybe I want to know what you feel underneath the pheromone noise. Maybe I've spent so long being small, being manageable, that I want to just... exist with someone for once. Without calculating.""
    
    She met his gaze, her pulse flickering visibly at her throat. For a moment, the ship felt smaller, every sound thick with possibility.
    
    ""That's a lot of maybes,"" she said, but she wasn't stepping back either.
    
    ""Yeah,"" he agreed. ""But they're all pointing the same direction.""
    
    She grinned, shaking her head, then turned away—leaving the distance taut and alive, a wire stretched between them. As she left the galley, she glanced back once, just once, with a smile that promised continuation.
    
    Ben, watching from the shadow of the engineering corridor, let his thoughts circle: *Please let this one work. Please let him finally figure out that he's worth staying for.* And then, quieter: *Please let me figure that out too.*
    
    ---
    
    An hour later, Raz hunched over the nav console on the bridge, and blue light caught the silver in his hair, making him look older and younger at the same time. The control room smelled of ozone, coffee, a trace of engine oil. The hum of running systems filled the space, constant white noise that had become as natural as breathing.
    
    LO-vis's voice filtered through the comm, calm and clipped, a little too bright to be entirely professional.
    
    ""Stabilizers recalibrated,"" she reported from engineering. ""If you break the grav again, you're doing my paperwork, captain.""
    
    Raz smiled into the dark, his thumb resting on transmit. The urge to answer with something unprofessional prickled under his skin—the kind of thing that would make Ben laugh and probably earn him a look from LO-vis that would be worth the trouble.
    
    He gave in to it.
    
    ""Deal,"" he said, his voice smooth and lightly flirtatious in a way that surprised even him. ""But only if you show me how you juggle three diagnostics at once. Ship's never run this sweet with me alone.""
    
    A static pause filtered back through the comm. He heard her soft exhale—caught in the open channel between them. Across the bulkhead, nothing but steel and longing, and the hum of a ship carrying three people toward something that felt like it might be home.
    
    In the engineering bay, LO-vis leaned back from her console, one hand pressed to her temple, grinning into the dark. Ben, checking readings nearby, caught the expression and smirked.
    
    ""You two ever think about closing the channel?"" he called out, not looking up from his work.
    
    ""Absolutely not,"" LO-vis shot back, but there was heat in her cheeks now.
    
    ---
    
    ## **NIGHT'S TRUTH**
    
    LO-vis paused outside his cabin door for longer than she wanted to admit, hand raised, breath warm against the back of her palm.
    
    The corridor vents carried his scent—familiar now, steadying in a way she'd stopped trying to rationalize. She'd taken the Zadine about an hour ago, timing it carefully. Enough time for it to settle into her system, to separate his pheromones from the base truth of her own wanting. Enough time to know, without shadow of a doubt, that this was *her* choice.
    
    She knocked once.

This happened after she was arrested for three felony charges that happened before I knew her she played guilty got out showed up at my house called the police. They said that I would have to evict her three months go by that’s when I discovered the card being used, I called the cops to file a police report and apparently when she was in jail, she had stated that I had hit her which I had not I’ve never hit a person in my life. I spoke to her parents and apparently she does this a lot to her exes makes up false charges, and then robs and destroys everything they have.

I was released on a PR bond when I got home. I noticed that I had over $25,000 of personal property and money missing as well as some clients servers and computer computers. I also discovered over $40,000 worth of damage done to my home. The county where this alleged salt occurred with three hours away the county where my property and finances in a home or destroyed happen in my home county I called a police when I got out again and they didn’t seem to care. They called me a wife beater, even though we weren’t married and they officer never filed a report which I need for my insurance.

I also discovered while watching security footage that over the past year that she had put fentanyl in my food or coffee literally on camera caught her doing this me passing out doing a death rattle, hardly breathing like she brought other guys into our home and had sex with him right next to my unconscious body. 

I don’t know what to do. I can’t get anyone to help me let alone just file a report for the property damage and loss of items for insurance. They won’t help me because everybody thinks I hit her so. 

It’s not about revenge not about getting even I originally filed a police report for a credit card abuse and had no idea that I had a warrant out for my arrest nor did I know that she was doing this why she was incarcerated I guess she thought I called the cops on her for those three felonies which I did not and this was her way of getting revenge and stealing my stuff so she didn’t have to work and could buy drugs with all the stuff she took, but I don’t know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

1p3sl5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify_hustlers/comments/1p3sl5t/you_dont_have_a_meta_ads_cost_problem_you_have_a/,You don’t have a Meta Ads cost problem. You have a clarity problem.,"Every day I talk to brand owners who swear Meta is “expensive,” “inconsistent,” or “broken.”

But the more you look at their funnel, the more you realize the issue isn’t CPMs or algorithm updates.
It’s the fact that their message is so unclear that Meta has no idea who the ad is meant for and neither does the customer.

When your messaging is confusing, your costs feel worse than they actually are.

Because think about it for a second.

If your ad is vague
and your headline talks in circles
and your product page is just features with zero context…

Meta has to dig through a bigger pool of people to figure out who this ad is even for.
And when Meta works harder than you do, CPMs climb and clicks die.

This is why most brands don’t have a cost problem.
They have a comprehension problem.

Let me show you how this usually plays out:

A founder writes a headline like
“Premium hydration solution for busy lifestyles.”

Cool… but what does that mean?
Who’s it for?
What’s the actual outcome?
What moment in someone’s life makes them stop and say “I need this”?

Nobody wakes up hoping for a “hydration solution.”
They wake up hoping they won’t feel tired during work.
They want fewer headaches.
They want better focus.
They want to perform better at the gym.

This is clarity.
This is what Meta can understand.
This is what customers click.

Here’s the simplest rewrite framework I give to clients who overcomplicate copy:

Step 1: Say the problem plainly
“My head pounds every afternoon and coffee stopped helping.”

Step 2: Say the transformation plainly
“This fixes your afternoon crashes in under ten minutes.”

Step 3: Say the mechanism plainly
“Electrolytes your body actually absorbs.”

Step 4: Say the proof plainly
“Over 9,400 reviews from people with the same problem.”

Notice what’s not here.
Buzzwords.
Empty features.
Corporate tone.
Vague benefits.

Plain language converts because humans think in plain language.

So next time you think your CPMs are high or Meta is being “weird,” check your clarity first.

If the ad doesn’t instantly tell someone
what the problem is
what the product does
and why they should trust it

you’ll always feel like costs are the enemy even when they’re not.

Give Meta and your customers clarity, and the whole system gets cheaper overnight.

If you want, I can rewrite one of your product messages in this exact format so you can see the difference immediately.",1,1763816203.0,shopify_hustlers,0,1.0,False

The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song.

I currently use an aeropress with the following recipe:
- 12g coffee ground coarse end of espresso range, around 5-6clicks from touching in a Eureko grinder
- paper filter
- 40ml for 30s
- additional 80ml, swirl
- brew until 2mins total
- dilute 1-1 with hot water, add dash of milk

Quite happy with this, really see the flavour profile change as beans age. Only one level I use which is total brew time, usually between 1:30 and 3:00 but really notice the difference with different beans.

I’m quite sensitive to caffeine so only have 1 coffee a day, try to make it nice. 

My worry with the oxo is all the recipes use a lot more coffee (20g, 40g, which seems like a lot to me). Can I get something out of the oxo with 12g?

I also don’t fully understand the process of leaving it if the water is sitting above the coffee puck for most of that time.

1p3sa1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1p3sa1y/my_current_strategy/,My current strategy,"I AM NOT TRYING TO CHANGE THE PROTOCOL.
However, the protocols are very voluminous and general for many range of lifters from beginner to experienced. It was very confusing/overwhelming for me to navigate the faqs. Instead, I want to check my understanding by presenting my application of it to my own contexts.

Current macros:
176cm 29M 70kg 20%bf 1187kcal 124g protein 68g fat 20g carbs. 
I am about 2 months into this whole thing, starting at 72kg. Plateau'd at 70kg exactly 3 weeks ago from the time of writing.

TKD CKD. I don't need these. Ignoring completely.

I am using foodscale, measuring spoon, and ordered prepped meal with nutrition labels. I will assume that my macro estimate is correct enough.

This is purely focused on the application of the protocol for a beginner like myself who needs to go from high BF to ~15%.

Here is the full, all in, context!

Macros
- When measuring with tape, I add 4% to the final BF value anyway. Unless I am anorexic with meat on bone and my abs are showing, I probably have a lot of body fat to spare. That or I get Dexa, which I will.
- The calculator estimates and is a starting point. My true TDEE is based on how much I eat while my weight does not change. E.g. I was on 1395kcal for 3 weeks and there was 0 change to my weight and not much improvement to my physique. Sure I feel stronger and my clothes fit differently, but at this stage I probably should still be losing weight. Therefore, safe to say that my current TDEE is around 1395kcal. 
- When a plateau of 3 week happens, I will reevaluate by assuming that the current macro is my 0% maintenance (Is this too aggressive?). I will reduce that by 15%, then continue. 1395kcal -> 1187kcal, hence my current macro starting today.
- Question: The faq mentions that deficit of > 30% is not advised because of muscle loss. I believe that this indicates 30% from the true TDEE, not the one from the calculator. If my body has adapted to 1395 kcal and I do not lose weight at this intake (even though the calculator says 1600kcal for RMR), then 1395 kcal is the value that I will base my -15% deficit on. Is this idea too aggressive?

Meal selection and supplements
- I will keep protein intake the same, but use fat as a lever and reduce that as needed. I will never, ever, go lower on protein.
- I will go for animal meat for protein primarily.
- Leafy greens so bowel movement is good + micronutrients. Spinach is awesome.
- No nuts or dairy.
- I just don't eat any starchy or sweet food. I drink some coke zero and sugar free electrolytes drink for refreshments. My net carbs are definitely under 20g.
- I probably drink too much black coffee.
- Eggs are very handy as a filler. For every 67kcal I am missing after putting in all the chicken, fish, and beef, I add one egg.
- I will allow my plan to exceed protein, and be under fat intake at a reasonable amount (like 5-10g). Easier to plan meals that way. 
- Big lunch, big dinner, thats it.
- Salting everything with potassium added salt. Not too much, but enough to combat the keto flu.
- 300mg Magnesium tablet.
- 24g protein shake + coffes + 5g MCT oil for pre workout. I am still adjusting to MCT, and will try 10g soonish.
- Social obligations on weekends are often unavoidable, but I aim to avoid all sweets and carbs. Will aim for minimal hardliquor only. Macros will become unpredictable on these, but I will do my best to limit calories and ensure that my protein intake is enough.

Gymming 
- Sticking to basic Push Pull Leg, focusing on lifting a lot of weight at 3 reps for the first big move after some light warmup, then the rest of the volume at 6 reps range. I get about 6 move of 3-4 working set in 1 hour and a few minutes. Then cool down stretches.
- Push-Pull-Leg-Rest repeat. 5-6 day per week on average with this.
- Rest day, I will go to gym anyway but focus on lighter stuff like mobility. I don't count these as lifting because its low intensity, and I will not take the pre-workout on this day.

I will think about what 'recomp' actually means once I get to sub 15%. For now, the above is what I will stick to. 
Planning a Dexa scan next month to see where I stand.

So, here’s a step-by-step of each meeting and what it seemed designed to do >>

Now keep in mind, if a lot of people wanted to join Amway, they would likely accept them all because that’s how the business model works. But many people do their own research and decide it’s not for them first, rather than these “leaders” actually “selecting” people.


Here’s a quick snapshot: 

MG1 - Meet n greet 1 

MG2 - Meet n greet 2 

MG3 - Meet n greet 3 (optional) 

EW - Entrepreneurial workshop 

FU1 - Follow up 1 

FU2 - Follow up 2 

FU3 - Follow up 3 LAUNCH - Joining the Amway business 

*They often say the process takes about 6 weeks, but from what I saw, they’re willing to wait as long as needed.



MG1 - 

This meeting is mainly about getting to know you, and they talk a lot about purpose and personal goals. Most people don’t notice any red flags here and it usually feels like a friendly catch-up.


MG2 - 

This meeting is where they introduce the Amway opportunity and present it in a very appealing way. In my experience, they encouraged people to avoid external research, especially online forums like reddit. Now looking back on it, I find that a very manipulative tactic because why else would you be telling people not to be doing their own research? They also give you a book to read to “qualify” for the entrepreneurial workshop (which is the next step).


MG3 - 

An optional meeting if MG2 runs out of time.


EW - 

The “special” workshop where someone with supposedly strong results in the business shares their story. The flyers usually talk about the revenue they generate for Amway, not necessarily their personal income. Toward the end, “special guests” share testimonials that often sound very similar and scripted. Even though they present them as exclusive, these workshops happen every week with majority existing Amway partners attending. After the first session, there’s usually a post-meeting for business partners only covering things like recruiting, leadership and goal-setting. These meetings became repetitive for me over time.


FU1 - 

After the first EW, the expectations shift. They outline the education they want you to follow—daily audio listening, three weekly meetings (including the EW you just attended), monthly catch-ups with a mentor, and three conferences per year. From what I later understood, a significant part of the business model involves people paying for educational content, weekly workshops, and conference tickets (tickets alone can cost upwards of $200 plus travel and accommodation on top). Now begs the question, if all IBO’s are paying for the educational content/tickets, who is getting paid that? I’ll give you a clue, it not you and it’s not Milly who went 9%.


FU2 - 

They start discussing plans to help you start your business through a 90-day STP (Start The Process) and talk about potential results. For me, this stage began to feel like I was being encouraged to chase outcomes I never actually experienced, even after three years.


FU3 - 

Here they talk about the cost of running the business and often compare it to the price of a daily coffee. From what I understood, this money contributes to the team’s leadership system, but the specifics weren’t fully explained until higher levels. They also haven’t yet gone into the minimum monthly product spend, which was minimum $420 AUD on Amway products. For example, a standard 190g toothpaste cost about $22 when I was involved.


LAUNCH - 

This is the final step. They usually send a questionnaire to “finalise your case,” although in my experience, people were accepted regardless of how detailed their answers were. They celebrate your decision to start the business and outline the initial costs, including the starter fees and products. Part of the excitement, from what I observed, is that new sign-ups contribute financially to THEM and obviously Amway.

As appealing as MLMs can appear, my personal experience is that the structure tends to prioritise profit over the individual even if they may say the opposite. Best not to get involved.

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for a match that’s part chess match, part lottery ticket, and part “hope you’re wearing clean underwear” gamble. We’re talking about Tromsø IL’s quest to punch their ticket to the UEFA Europa League versus Rosenborg, a team that’s currently fielding what feels like a squad of overqualified lifeguards and a guy who once scored a hat trick in a dream. Let’s break it down with the precision of a Norwegian tax auditor and the humor of a stand-up economist at a bar.

**The Odds: A Math Class You Actually Want to Attend**  
The bookmakers are throwing their weight behind Tromsø like a parent shoving a kid into a college scholarship interview. At FanDuel, Tromsø is a solid **1.43** (decimal) favorite, which translates to a **41.28% implied probability** of victory. Rosenborg? They’re priced at **+600**, or **14.29%**, which is about the same chance as me correctly guessing your favorite color while blindfolded. The draw sits at **4.6**, implying a **21.74%** chance—basically, the likelihood of your Wi-Fi cutting out during a live stream of this match.

But here’s the kicker: Tromsø’s win probability isn’t just a number; it’s a financial lifeline. Third place nets them **5 million NOK** in prize money and a **48 million NOK** Europa League windfall. That’s enough to buy Rosenborg a new stadium… or at least a really nice coffee machine for their coaching staff.

**The News: Injuries, Suspensions, and One Team’s Desperate Hail Mary**  
Rosenborg is currently fielding a lineup that makes a “B team” feel generous. Key players **Emil Konradsen Ceïde** (out for the season) and **Tomás Nemcic** (also out) have exited the building, while **David Edvardsson** is suspended after accumulating eight yellow cards—because apparently, he’s mastered the art of parking his car in traffic cones. With injuries and suspensions decimating their roster, Rosenborg looks like a Swiss cheese that’s also been set on fire.

Here is the math behind the layoffs vs. the massive AI spend (2024-2025 Data)","https://preview.redd.it/cajpdfgfys2g1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=224547507de50d01c0294b20994c7711efa1b3d9

I’ve been reading threads here for weeks from people freaking out because ""the market is bad"" or because Big Tech is ""trimming the fat"" to survive. We’ve been sold the ""Efficiency"" narrative (Zuck’s famous *Year of Efficiency*) as if these companies were actually struggling financially.

I dug into the Q3/Q4 2024 earnings calls and 2025 projections for Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon.

**Spoiler Alert: They aren't saving money. They just decided to stop paying you so they can pay Jensen Huang (Nvidia).**

Here is the data they don't put in the layoff memo:

**1. The Great OpEx to CapEx Shift** For the non-finance folks:

* **OpEx (Operating Expenses):** Salaries, benefits, your free office coffee.
* **CapEx (Capital Expenditures):** Infrastructure, Data Centers, H100 GPUs.

What we are seeing in 2024/2025 is not a crisis; it is a **massive reallocation of resources.**

* **Microsoft:** Spent nearly **$35 billion** in CapEx in just ONE recent quarter. Most of it went to AI infrastructure.
* **Google:** Projecting **$90B+** in spend for the fiscal year, almost entirely focused on AI.
* **Meta:** Burning through roughly **$38-40 billion** annually on AI, while laying off staff from ""metaverse"" or support teams.
* **Amazon:** Planning to spend up to **$75 billion** in 2025, doubling its data center capacity.

**2. The Layoff vs. GPU Math** Let’s do some quick napkin math. A senior engineer in the US might cost the company (Salary + Stock/RSUs + Benefits) around $300k-$400k a year. A server rack with Nvidia H100 GPUs costs hundreds of thousands, and a serious cluster costs millions.

Every time you read ""Microsoft lays off 1,000 people,"" on the books, that looks like freeing up \~$300-400 million in annual OpEx. What do they do with that cash? They don't put it in the bank. They immediately move it to the CapEx column to buy more compute.

**3. The Uncomfortable Truth** You aren't being let go because your work isn't valuable. You are being let go because speculative AI ROI (Return on Investment) has become the only metric Wall Street cares about. CEOs are terrified of falling behind in the AI arms race. They would rather fire 10% of their workforce and risk breaking internal culture than risk telling investors ""we didn't buy enough GPUs this quarter.""

**Bottom line:** It’s not that there’s no money. There is more money than ever. They’ve simply decided that, in 2025, silicon is worth more than carbon.

The Serie A clash between Juventus and Fiorentina on November 22, 2025, is shaping up to be a mismatch masquerading as a contest. Let’s break down why this game is less of a battle and more of a masterclass in footballing hierarchy.

### Parse the Odds: Why Juventus is the Statistical Favorite

The bookmakers are as united as a pizza dough in a Calabrian kitchen: **Juventus is the clear -110 favorite** (decimal odds \~1.95), while Fiorentina sits at +380 (decimal \~3.85), implying a 73% implied probability for Juve and 26% for the Viola. The draw? A 33% shot, which is about the same chance Fiorentina has of winning a lottery if they sell all their players.

Juventus, sixth in Serie A with 19 points (5-4-2), has the consistency of a well-tuned espresso machine—reliable, if not always explosive. Fiorentina, dead last with 5 points (0-1-5), is like a drip coffee maker that forgot to boil water. Their 2-2 draw with Genoa last time out was less a victory and more a chaotic truce.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Form, and the Art of Survival

Juventus enters this match fresh off a 0-0 draw with Torino—a result as thrilling as a nap in a library. But hey, defense wins championships, and Juve’s backline has leaked just 1.2 goals per game. Their attack? Well, it’s like a Michelin-starred chef showing up to a hot dog stand—overqualified but occasionally undermotivated.

Fiorentina, meanwhile, is the Serie A version of a group project where everyone forgot to do their part. Their “draw” with Genoa was less about strategy and more about survival, like two sailors treading wate

# 💥 What Is the AI Affiliate Clipping Engine?

It’s a 3-step system built for speed and simplicity:

1️⃣ Clip my videos using AI  
2️⃣ Upload to YouTube  
3️⃣ Add your affiliate link

That’s it.

No recording.  
No editing headaches.  
No huge audience needed.

Every clip you post can bring in commissions from viewers who click, watch, and join — while you focus on scaling.

This is how **AI Profit Boardroom members** are generating affiliate income without creating a single piece of content.

# ⚙️ The Origin: From Burnout to Automation

A few months ago, I was buried in editing.  
Hours cutting 10-second clips, losing motivation fast.

Then one of my members messaged me:

>

100 clicks. One day.

So I tested it myself.  
I dropped one of my videos into Descript, edited it just by *deleting text*, and made a 20-second clip in under 3 minutes.

Uploaded it.  
It started getting views instantly.

That’s when the idea clicked — literally.  
If my content could make money for me, why not let my community do the same?

That’s how the **AI Affiliate Clipping Engine** was born.

# 🧠 How It Works Step-by-Step

Let’s break it down:

**Step 1: Clip my videos (with permission)**  
Inside the **AI Profit Boardroom**, you get access to my latest YouTube videos.  
You pick a great moment, drop it into Descript, and let AI handle the rest.

**Step 2: Edit with AI (in minutes)**  
Descript lets you edit video by deleting text.  
You can say:

>

Boom.  
You’ve got a professional, scroll-stopping short clip — in minutes.

**Step 3: Upload & Add Your Affiliate Link**  
Upload your new clip to YouTube.  
Add your unique **AI Profit Boardroom affiliate link** in the description and pinned comment.

Now, when someone clicks and joins — *you get paid recurring commissions.*

# 🚀 Real Examples: From 0 to 100,000 Views

Meet **Sani** and **Steve Light**, two Boardroom members using this exact system.

Sani clipped my videos, uploaded them with his link, and hit **100,000 views** on a brand-new channel with only 164 subscribers.

Steve Light did the same and built a steady stream of affiliate sales — 40% recurring commissions every month.

Neither of them filmed a single video.  
They just clipped, posted, and profited.

And yes — their results are public inside the AI Profit Boardroom.

# 🏆 The AI Affiliate Clipping Challenge

We’re now turning this into a full **30-day challenge** inside the AI Profit Boardroom.

Here’s what you’ll do:

Every day, more members join the challenge — building mini content engines that earn commissions daily.

You’ll also compete for prizes (1st, 2nd, and 3rd place).

# 💡 Breaking Every Limiting Belief

**“I’m not good on camera.”**  
You don’t need to be. You’re using my videos.

**“I don’t know how to edit.”**  
You don’t need to. Descript edits for you.

**“I don’t have time.”**  
Each clip takes 5 minutes. Do it over coffee.

**“No one will watch my clips.”**  
Sani and Steve started from 0. They now get thousands of views.

**“It sounds too good to be true.”**  
It’s not magic — it’s a system.  
It only works when you take action.

I love coffee but I always went with convenience, so I currently have a nespresso machine.  
  
But I think it's time to take a step up.  
  
Like the title says I mostly drink Lungo or Cappucino. I'm looking for something more hands-on because I want to learn and it sounds fun. So probably a semi-automatic machine. I'm a bit lost with all the information online, so I need some help. I see all-in-one machines that have everythin included (grinder, steam wand etc), and I also see some other people having everything separate. Not sure which is best for my case.

My budget is around 300-700, but I'm open to suggestions if you think it's worth strething it a bit.

Like I said, I do want to learn, but keep in mind I'm a beginner, so ideally I would love something that could guide me a bit.",1,1763813960.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I’m 26M and in Singapore for a student exchange program. I’ve only been here till the 12th of December. I don’t really have a friend circle yet, and I’m hoping to meet some people while I’m here.

To be transparent, I’m specifically looking to make female friends, and it’s 100% platonic. I’m not here to date, flirt, or hookup. It’s just that I connect better in friendships with women. The conversations feel warmer, more open, and more comfortable for me. I find it easier to talk about life, feelings, and even the random everyday stuff without the pressure to act a certain way.

Unfortunately, I do not find that kind of warmth and comfort in talking with men. I really miss the kind of easy, genuine vibe I’ve had with some of my female friends in the past, and I’d love to have that again while I’m here.

If you’re somewhere in your 20s and would like to grab coffee, check out a café, explore the city, or just talk about anything and everything, feel free to DM or comment. ",0,1763813707.0,ChillSG,4,0.2,False

Here is the blueprint for dominating search results in the UAE.](https://preview.redd.it/3g86uc7wts2g1.png?width=2816&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3382610582e2856631818cdb3743da9eb508b94)

**Why Your Business Isn't Ranking (And How to Fix It)**

**If you aren't ranking locally, you don't exist. Here is the blueprint for dominating search results in the UAE.**

You have a great website (maybe we built it!), but when you search for ""best service,"" you're nowhere to be found. Why? Because you are competing with the entire world instead of focusing on your backyard. Local SEO is the art of ranking for customers who are physically near you and in the UAE, it is the single most profitable marketing channel you can ignore.



**1. The ""Near Me"" Revolution**

Did you know that searches for ""near me"" have grown by over 900% in the last two years? When a customer in Dubai Marina searches for ""coffee shop,"" Google doesn't show them the best coffee shop in New York. It uses geolocation to show them what's close.

If your website doesn't explicitly tell Google, ""I am located in Sharjah, and I serve these specific areas,"" you will never appear in those high-value search results.



2. Google Business Profile: Your New Homepage

Before a customer ever clicks your website link, they see your Google Map listing. If you haven't claimed and optimized your Google Business Profile (formerly GMB), you are handing customers to your competitors.

Verify your location: Ensure your pin is exactly right.

Reviews matter: A 4.8-star rating gets 3x more clicks than a 3.5-star rating.

Photos: Upload real photos of your office, team, or products. Stock photos hurt your trust here.



3. Local Keywords: Be Specific

Stop trying to rank for ""Best Plumber."" That's too competitive. Instead, target ""Emergency Plumber in Al Nahda"" or ""24/7 Plumber Sharjah."" These are ""long-tail keywords"" with lower competition but much higher ""intent to buy.""



4. Consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone)

Google gets confused easily. If your website says you are in ""Sharjah,"" but your Facebook page says ""Dubai,"" and your Instagram has no address, Google won't trust you. Your Name, Address, and Phone number must be identical across every single platform on the web.
