It was a ""Loki Reincarnated as Human"" story and it was based more on Norse mythology than the Marvel version. Loki, as a human, is a graphic novelist who turns his dreams of Asgard into a well-received fantasy series. He is the sole survivor of a car accident that claimed his parents, and has no memories of his human life pre-accident. Because of this, he moves to NYC for a fresh start.

He meets Tony at a coffee shop in NY, and there's an immediate attraction. As they get closer, Loki starts to manifest his magic and, in doing so, recovers more of his actual self. Unfortunately, remembering comes with blinding migraines, so Tony gets Bruce involved to help figure out what's going on.

I’m 17 idrk where else to put this but I’m burned out and I feel stuck.

My parents have had me in tennis since I was really young and over the years it slowly turned into the only thing that matters. Right now I practice 8 hours a day, every day except Sunday, which is 6 hours. That’s considered my “rest day.”

They pulled me out of public school and made me start homeschooling so I could practice more. That was the entire reason. I didn’t ask for it and I didn’t really get a choice  they just decided it would “work better” for tennis and what it takes for me to have a successful tennis career in the future.

A normal day for me is four hours of practice in the morning, then I go straight to work from 12 to 5, and after that I do another four hours of practice. By the time I’m done it’s usually around 9 PM, sometimes later, and then I still have schoolwork to do. Most nights I don’t finish until 12 or 1 in the morning because homeschooling means all the work is on me and it usually takes three to four hours to get everything done after I get home, shower, and eat.

The only time I’m not practicing is when I’m at work and my parents call that my “break.” I work at a coffee shop and I’m on my feet the whole time but somehow that counts as rest to them..

I’ve also gotten injured a lot which feels like it just gets ignored. I’ve had a torn rotator cuff, a bad ankle sprain that took weeks to heal, tendonitis in my wrist, and ongoing back pain that never really went away. Every time something happens the focus is always on how fast I can get back to practicing instead of whether I’m actually okay. Rest usually just means “do less than 8 hours for a few weeks” and then it’s back to the full 8 hours. If I say I’m tired or stressed they tell me this is what it takes to be successful.

If I ask to skip a practice or take a day off it turns into a long lecture about how much money they spend and how other kids would be grateful for this opportunity. They track my hours and get mad if they think I didn’t play good enough.

I’m not bad at tennis. I win tournaments most of the time and my coaches and trainers say I'm really good which makes this harder. I feel guilty complaining because I know I’m lucky in some ways but at the same time I don’t really have a life outside of this. I don’t hang out with friends, I don’t do normal school stuff, and I’m tired all the time.",2,1771463638.0,Rants,0,1.0,False

Some are guesthouses lang, or like inns, but its sooooo AWKWARD whenever I party out cause I go home so late- and like this one time I stayed at RedDoorz (which is right beside Neighborhood Coffee Place?), they to open the door when I come in haha it felt like my mom waiting for me late at night haha!

1r8le23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvLiterateRP/comments/1r8le23/f4m_saving_daisy/,[F4M] Saving Daisy,"It had been eight months since the pair first laid eyes on each other at the coffee shop. Some Patagonia clad finance bro had cut her in line. Daisy had been mid order with a long list of drinks. The man was oblivious, or too arrogant to notice. But not him. Who was he? Daisy wouldn't find out until their third date when he insisted she ride in his helicopter from his office to his place. She hadn't really left after that.

Who was he? Did it really matter? He was obsessed with her, he gave her meaning. He made her feel loved, cared for and worshipped in a way she had never experienced before. He insisted on the best for her. The best hair stylist, the best clothes, the best shoes, the best personal trainer. He even had her breasts done. There was no way her a cups would have been able to fill out a bikini for their holiday in St. Barths. Daisy had become his personal doll. His complete adoration filled a piece of her that she hadn’t know was missing

It wasn’t always spray tans and blowouts. He had a temper. He demanded perfection and settled for nothing less. Daisy's social life shrunk to just him, and his world. Her old life was almost gone. Her condo had been sold. The only piece that remained was her job. Even that was hanging on by a thread. Before him, Daisy had been a successful partner at an accounting firm. Her job had defined her. Long weeks, constant busy seasons. She was successful in her own right. Her job was intellectually fulfilling, emotionally draining. 

Daisy had built a name and a life for herself before him that didn't seem to matter and she was seemingly fine with this. As long as he was happy. She loved the way he had a few more wrinkles near his left eye than his right when he laughed or smiled at her. She loved how she could speak to him about anything. 

Perfection was a journey, not a destination. The Daisy he had first met eight months ago was gone, that much was clear. She was now ready for whatever path he wanted for her. And so was she.

We're currently 25. He works in finance/IT experience (potentially police but that's in the air). I work in the vet/animal field and have a small business on the side. We're both not too sociable, so having nightlife/social scene isn't a priority. We dont drink, but love coffee. We love more dreary weather, with the occasional sun at least once a week, lol. My boyfriend can be susceptible to seasonal depression and doesn't tolerate the cold as well as I do. We love the night (I hate the sun. I joke i'm allergic to it, lol). I don't know much about the longer nights/days or where/when they happen. Being at least an hour within a major-ish hub would be nice but not a necessity as we prefer the calm, quietness of nature and smaller towns more. Though it would be nice to have entertainment options within 1hr distance. I love the forest and would love to see Northern Lights every now and then. (Not sure if they're common all over Norway?). I've also read comments about the ""Bible Belt"" of Norway? We're both agnostic, and I am more alternative than others, so a limited judgmental population that won't chastise me for not sharing their beliefs would be great. (If you know the US at all, it's bad here with that stuff)

Major no go is tourism towns. or any place that will constantly have a surplus of non locals. Maybe minimum 1-2 months a year but I hate the thought of having to fight crowds to go about my daily life 😭

It's long and probably boring, and mostly me working stuff out by writing about it. It's often how I do this.

Anyway, it's a few days later, I'm still not over her and it's going to take some time. But the disconnection process is proceeding. Today I deleted her phone # and a Whatsapp chat I had with her. It just felt like the right thing to do as this situation isn't going anywhere. I saved both though, just in case (legal reasons, you never know, she's a bit unstable from what I've seen so I need to take precautions).

Felt kind of good to do that. I didn't unsubscribe from her YouTube channel, as she only has a few dozen subs and she'd notice, and I don't want to set her off. I might keep it for a while before unsubscribing. I did though turn off the notification feature. No point in keeping it on. Can't say that I'll never watch one of her videos, it doesn't work that way and my will power is wanting. But not as often as before. Eventually, hopefully, none.

And now that I'm thinking about it, what we had was a casual version of what some call as ""situationship"". I say casual because there was no actual romantic relationship whatsoever. Or even a true friendship. Friends do things together, confide in each other, have long talks over coffee or whatever, care about each other, are there for each other. That's not what was going on here.

Rather, what was going on was that I was attracted to, liked and wanted something more serious with her, whether romantic or platonic (yeah I know), while she was content to continue our casual friendship, which consisted of her passing by when I was outside doing something, on her way to or from one of her near-daily long walks, smiling warmly and even flirtatiously, saying hi, and stopping to chat for a few minutes about this or that.

And that's it and all that it was. Any attempt I made to take this casual friendship beyond that was met with indifference, disinterest or a rebuff. This would qualify as limerence, right? In any case, I persisted in the delusion that eventually she'd come around and this would turn into something more serious, even if just a friendship. Which was basically smashed a few days ago when I asked her out and she declined, with no indication of interest in doing something another time. Additionally, things have just felt a bit ""off"" or weird since then. Like, she's seemed a bit more distant.

Which is when it hit me that it was and is never going to happen, and all it would ever be was this casual friendly ""situationship"" that relied upon our running into each other outside, in front of my place, every few days. Which just doesn't cut it for me, but it does for her, I think for the attention and validation of knowing that an older man is attracted to her, making this a narcissistic situation, presumably of the more ""benign"" but still painful sort.

I ran into her today briefly, outside of course. We chatted for a few minutes, and she brought up a former relationship of hers for some reason (almost felt like turning a knife, is she clueless or does she enjoy this?). She mentioned how she's not into casual relationships, only serious ones. But then pretty much by definition our relationship is casual and not serious. Again, is she really this clueless, or yet more playful torture? Are some women this clueless--or cruel?

To those people here who've been in this sort of situation, crushing on someone who only likes you as a friend, and as just a casual friend at that, from whom you can expect nothing except the occasional stop by to say hit and chat for a few minutes, how does this feel, and how do you handle it?

Do you take what you can get, grateful to have even that? Or do you cut them off, to the extent possible, for your own mental health and self-respect? Does it feel exploitive, if they know that you're into them yet continue to ""tease"" you now and then, presumably for your attention and validation?

I really do think that I should cut off all interaction with her to the extent possible. Not just to make it easier to move past this emotionally, but because it's starting to feel like she's exploiting me for her own shallow emotional need for validation and attention, and perhaps the sick thrill of giving me a tiny taste of what she knows I can never have, making it a power or ego trip as well.

Surely she can't be so clueless as to not know the effect this has on me. Is this the sort of thing that some women who've been sexually traumatized in the past do, torture men as a form of payback, even if the man they're torturing has nothing to do with whatever happened to them once? Because I sense past trauma in her and wonder if this is what's going on here.

What makes cutting things off with her harder is that so long as we both still live her, we'll continue to run into each other. I guess I'll have to take it one day at a time.",3,1771462440.0,limerence,1,1.0,False

I've spent the last year diving into psychology research, business podcasts, and honestly way too many self-help books. And I kept noticing this pattern everywhere. People aren't failing because of one catastrophic decision. They're failing because of Tuesday at 3pm when they chose scrolling over that 20-minute task. It's the boring stuff nobody talks about.

Alex Hormozi has this whole framework about this, and after studying his content plus a bunch of behavioral science, I'm convinced most of us are sabotaging ourselves in ways we don't even notice. Here's what actually moves the needle.

# The 1% rule isn't motivational BS

Hormozi talks about how your daily actions compound like interest. Sounds basic, right? But here's the thing: research from BJ Fogg at Stanford shows that massive goals fail because they rely on motivation, which is wildly unreliable. Instead, behavior change happens through tiny actions repeated consistently.

* Make the behavior stupidly small. Want to write a book? Don't commit to ""writing for an hour."" Commit to opening the document. That's it.
* Stack it onto existing habits. After I pour my morning coffee, I write three sentences. Not three pages. Three sentences. Some days it turns into more, most days it doesn't. But I never skip.
* Remove friction everywhere possible. I sleep in my gym clothes. Sounds ridiculous but it works. The ""getting ready"" part used to be my excuse.

[Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299) by James Clear is genuinely the best book on this. Clear is a behavior change expert who spent years researching performance optimization. The book breaks down exactly how incremental improvements create exponential results. It's not fluffy motivation, it's practical systems. This book will make you question everything you think you know about building habits.

# Your environment is secretly destroying you

Hormozi says ""you can't out-discipline a bad environment"" and neuroscience backs this up hard. Your brain runs on autopilot for like 95% of decisions. If your autopilot environment sucks, you're cooked.

* Eliminate decision fatigue by designing defaults. I meal prep on Sundays not because I love it, but because deciding what to eat three times a day drains willpower I need for harder stuff.
* Physical space matters more than you think. I removed my TV from my bedroom. My sleep quality jumped within a week. Your bedroom should be boring.
* Proximity is destiny. The people you're around most shape your baseline. If everyone around you settles for mediocre, you probably will too. Not because you're weak, because humans are wired to conform. It's biology.

Check out Ash if you're working through relationship or mental health patterns that keep repeating. It's an AI coach that helps you spot these environmental/behavioral loops you're stuck in. Way more practical than traditional therapy for some people.

# The gap between knowing and doing

This is where most people live permanently. You KNOW what to do. You're not stupid. But you're not doing it. Hormozi's take: you're optimizing for feeling good instead of getting results.

* Track lag measures, not lead measures. Your bank account is a lag measure. How many sales calls you made is a lead measure. Focus on inputs you control.
* Build accountability that actually hurts. Tell someone specific what you're doing and when. Public commitment changes behavior because we're hardwired to avoid social shame.
* Accept that discipline feels like shit. It's supposed to. The dopamine hit comes later, sometimes way later. Your brain wants instant gratification. Reject it consciously.

The Diary of a CEO podcast with Steven Bartlett has an incredible episode with Hormozi where they break down execution vs. theory. Bartlett built a massive media company and his questions cut through the surface level stuff.

For anyone who wants this kind of structured learning without drowning in ten different books, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450). It's a personalized learning app that pulls from books like Atomic Habits, behavioral science research, and expert insights to build an adaptive plan around your specific goals, like ""stop procrastinating on my side project"" or ""build consistency as someone with ADHD."" You pick the depth, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples, and customize the voice. Some people go for the smooth, conversational tone, others prefer something more direct and energetic. It turns knowledge into audio you can actually use during your commute or at the gym, which beats staring at another book you won't finish.

If you want the neuroscience behind why we procrastinate and self-sabotage, The [Molecule of More by Daniel Lieberman](http://www.amazon.com/Molecule-More-Chemical-Creativity_and-Determine/dp/1946885118/) explains dopamine's role in motivation and desire. It's dense but insanely good. Lieberman is a psychiatry professor at George Washington University and he basically explains why your brain is working against your long-term goals. After reading this I finally understood why I'd plan amazing things and then just not do them.

# Stop waiting for the perfect moment

Hormozi built multiple eight-figure businesses and his biggest lesson is that action creates clarity, not the other way around. You're never going to ""feel ready"" for the big move.

* Reps matter more than strategy. You get good by doing the thing badly, a lot. Not by planning the perfect approach.
* Failure is just data collection. Reframe it. Every failed attempt tells you something useful if you're paying attention.
* Finch is a solid app for building daily momentum on small tasks. It gamifies habit tracking in a way that doesn't feel patronizing. Helps you stack those tiny wins.

The gap between dreams and reality isn't talent or luck or timing. It's the accumulation of small, boring, unsexy choices you make when nobody's watching. Your Tuesday afternoon matters way more than your New Year's resolution.

1r8kwz2,https://i.redd.it/vka4721omckg1.jpeg,Flair Pro 2 - First Experience.,"Just finished my first bag of beans of coffee to try and learn the whole workflow and getting to know the machine. It's been a rollercoaster ride as I've encountered so many things in the span of 250g of beans loool. I've been using the Crema 2in1 and Normcore tamper, and timemore C5 ESP as my grinder

- Leaking (solved through deep cleaning and lubricating the o-rings)
- I've been getting an average of 20g yield in 15g dosage in 35s. But, results vary as I've created a 35g+ one time with the same grind size and everything.
- My whole process is 10s pre-infuse at 3 bar | +5s at 6bar | +20s at 8-9bar.
- Nonetheless, coffee tastes great.

I struggle to find joy in life or the motivation to pursue anything. I can't really do what makes me feel good because nothing makes me feel good. I don't even know what I like anymore so I end up just forcing myself to do \_something\_, \_anything\_, but it never ends well. At first I was trying to find joy or comfort in doing little things like walking in the park, getting a coffee, or browsing a book store. When that didn't work, I tried lowering my expectations and instead of expecting to feel good I aimed for feeling neutral and hoped that the good feelings would come later. Seemed like a decent strategy however I'm now at a point where doing anything makes me feel \_worse\_.

When I go to get a coffee, it takes everything in me not to scream in the middle of the store. I feel so much anger and rage when trying to do \_anything\_ for myself. I've tried exploring what causes this and what I've come up with is that the things I have to look forward to in life feel like a slap in the face compared to what I've been through already. You're telling me I survived years of horrific abuse and trauma, some of which feels comparable to torture, so that I could go get a coffee or read a book or watch a TV show one day? Really??? It's so insane it makes me want to laugh. Like this is some sick joke right?

But now my question is, what do I do from here?  I am legitimately trying but I can't seem to make life feel ""worth it"" despite having a great therapist, husband, and doing all the ""right"" things to help myself.    ",3,1771462190.0,CPTSD,2,1.0,False
1r8kvzc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r8kvzc,(M15 15M) trying to grow my hair long and keep them till atleast my early 30's,"(first 12 photos show how my hair look wet and the rest shows how my hair look dry after taking the shower)

I first noticed losing my hair when I was 15 years old,but after I checked out my older pictures I saw that it first started receding when I was like 10-11 years old (last pic)

I think the hairline havent realy moved since I was 13-14,but now its starting to thin on top and pretty much all over my scalp (I could've been alr thinning there but I had short cut hair so it could be not realy noticable)

I alr had bloodwork done and everything seems fine other than my thyroid,I was diagnosed with Hashimoto,so it might also be the reason for that,even tho im sure its genetic hairloss (nobody I know in my family ever had it).

And if we are alr in family topic,yes there are ppl in my family that sadly have the balding gene,but its diffrent in both sites.

On my dad's site it was either receding much slower or started realy late in life,my dad started losing his hair in his mid/late 20's,and after 20+ years hes a nw 3,5-4 without any thinning on crown (hes turning 50),while my dad's dad had mature hairline till his mid 70's,now hes like nw 4,and my dad's brother isnt even balding.

My mom's family def has stronger balding genes,but also they happend later in life.

Her brother (for now the only fully bald person in my family) started losing his hair in his like early 30's and he lost all of it in his late 30's/early 40's,and my mom's dad idk when he started losing his hair but he was like nw 5 at 52,he sadly passed away long time ago so idk how he would look today.

I came here asking if theres anything u can suggest me using to stop hairloss at my age,im like 99% sure its genetic hairloss,but I also dont realy know how hashimoto can affect ur hair.

Im going to a dermatologist next week,so I want to know what I can ask him to prescribe me to stop further hairloss and gain some more hair.

Im sorry for such a long text but I wanted to explain everything as good ad I can.",1,1771462147.0,Balding,1,1.0,False

1r8kuey,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1r8kuey/aiw_for_expecting_what_i_feel_is_the_bare_minimum/,"AIW for expecting, what I feel, is the bare minimum from my husband?","I (22F) have been married to my husband (23M) for a little over 1.5 years now. We dated for almost 3 years before we got married. While we were dating we would always hang out together and would go on dates. The dates weren't anything expensive or crazy (just going on walks, stargazing, country or ballroom dancing, getting fast food, etc.). Also while we were dating I feel like he put in more effort with our relationship. He helped clean our apartment, was more romantic when wanting to do more intimate things (like kissing, back scratches, massages, etc.). He would open car doors for me, walk me to classes (we are in college btw), celebrate holidays or birthdays together, and even got me flowers once for valentines day. Even while we did on and off long distance for years he always managed to talk to me daily or even sent sweet messages for me to wake up to or fall asleep to. Even an occasional gift because he was thinking about me (usually food, or a blanket since I get cold easily). All of this was amazing! 

After we got married this continued for a couple of months but then a lot of these things just went away. We both are full time students in college and both work. With school and work I usually leave by 9am and don't get home till about 10:30pm Monday- Saturday. With his work and school he usually leaves at around 10am and gets home by 7pm Monday- Friday. So we are both pretty busy. With keeping up with our house I am the one that now does all the cleaning, cooking, dishes, laundry, etc. with no help from my husband. Whenever I ask him to help its always ""yes ill do it in a minute"" then it never gets done. I once asked him to put his dishes from off our coffee table into the dishwasher so I could start the dishwasher. He said he would do it but those dishes ended up staying there for four days before I did it myself. This is how any chore or little thing I ask him to do goes. If I want to go out on a date with him to go on a walk or go country dancing he never wants to go anymore and his reasoning is he ""doesn't want to"", he ""doesn't feel like it"" or his ""legs hurt to much"" from his workout every day. 

We never celebrate any holidays and this last year he didn't remember my birthday. When wanting to be intimate he just asks me if I want to and that's the end of the conversation. I have tried to spice it up with outfits but then I just get a text from our bedroom saying ""you coming?"". No romantic notions at all. I also feel like I never see my husband anymore and we don't get to spend any quality time together. When he gets home from his day he enjoys playing videogames with his friends and he usually stays up for hours doing this and I end up going to bed because I have an early morning. And when I leave in the morning he is always still sleeping since he stayed up so late the night before. Whenever his friends want to play the game he will stop whatever we were doing to play because ""they can only play at certain times"" and he ""never gets to see them in person so this is like talking to them"". I get that is how he communicates with his friends but does it have to be every single night? Also whenever we watch a show together or a movie he loves for me to give him back scratches. I don't mind it so much but its every single time. And if I stop doing it for a bit then he asks me to keep going. But if I ask him to scratch my back or help me massage my sore back from work the response I get is, ""I don't want to"" or ""I cant get myself to just sit there and do it like you can"".

I feel like I am putting in a lot more effort than my husband is. I am not expecting flowers, or holding doors open, or dates anymore but a little help with the housekeeping, being a bit more affectionate/ romantic with me and maybe not playing video games all the time so we can at least go to bed together sometimes.

Im from the east coast of the USA. Looking for people from any country. Work is usually pretty slow unless something breaks or needs to be installed. I am willing to share pics if interested in who we are talking to. I am married

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too, and want to buold a bigger one. I have a fish tank room that I have 4 tortoises that live there during the winter. I also have one cat and one dog too. I breed and propagate fish/plants, so I'm always down to trade, too.

I've been drinking a lot of tea and coffee lately. Always like new suggestions for both. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading. I've started making my own breads and want to start making different jelly when it's warm enough for my berry bushes to produce. I am about to get a 3d printer and start messing around with that.

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, Valorant, and Ark Suvival Ascended. Love playing Pokemon games and doing some Pokémon card collecting, too. I've been getting into playing more survival games than shooting games lately. I also built my PC to play on a couple of years ago.

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Always up to try or learn about new hobbies.",1,1771461970.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

1r8ks8r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r8ks8r,(15M M15) idk if this is saveable due to my age,"(first 12 photos show how my hair look wet and the rest shows how my hair look dry after taking the shower)

I first noticed losing my hair when I was 15 years old,but after I checked out my older pictures I saw that it first started receding when I was like 10-11 years old (last pic)

I think the hairline havent realy moved since I was 13-14,but now its starting to thin on top and pretty much all over my scalp (I could've been alr thinning there but I had short cut hair so it could be not realy noticable)

I alr had bloodwork done and everything seems fine other than my thyroid,I was diagnosed with Hashimoto,so it might also be the reason for that,even tho im sure its genetic hairloss (nobody I know in my family ever had it).

And if we are alr in family topic,yes there are ppl in my family that sadly have the balding gene,but its diffrent in both sites.

On my dad's site it was either receding much slower or started realy late in life,my dad started losing his hair in his mid/late 20's,and after 20+ years hes a nw 3,5-4 without any thinning on crown (hes turning 50),while my dad's dad had mature hairline till his mid 70's,now hes like nw 4,and my dad's brother isnt even balding.

My mom's family def has stronger balding genes,but also they happend later in life.

Her brother (for now the only fully bald person in my family) started losing his hair in his like early 30's and he lost all of it in his late 30's/early 40's,and my mom's dad idk when he started losing his hair but he was like nw 5 at 52,he sadly passed away long time ago so idk how he would look today.

I came here asking if theres anything u can suggest me using to stop hairloss at my age,im like 99% sure its genetic hairloss,but I also dont realy know how hashimoto can affect ur hair.

Im going to a dermatologist next week,so I want to know what I can ask him to prescribe me to stop further hairloss and gain some more hair.

She had reached out to me for a director role, leading the product marketing team. The whole thing was a mess, and it was a good reminder that one must respect their time. These were the main issues that made me end it early:

🚩 The recruiter seemed completely unprepared. She couldn't answer basic questions about the team structure or the main KPIs for the role. Honestly, I felt that all she had was the job description and nothing else. I got a strong feeling she hadn't even spoken with the hiring manager.

🚩 The technical setup was a disaster. Her voice had a terrible echo and there was loud background noise, as if she were in a crowded coffee shop. The call dropped four times before I finally suggested she just call me directly on my mobile.

🚩 When we got to compensation, she asked for my expectations and I heard her gasp when I told her. I explained that I have other opportunities in the pipeline offering at least $60,000 more per year for the same scope of work. Their budget was completely out of touch with the current market rate.

After about fifteen minutes, I politely told her that it wasn't going to be a match and ended the call. I gave her direct feedback that their compensation is far below the market rate, which I hope helps the next person they contact.

Never feel obligated to sit through a ridiculous interview. Know your worth, go in prepared with your data, and don't be afraid to withdraw from a situation that doesn't respect you or your time. Always remember, you are interviewing them just as much as they are interviewing you.",7,1771461858.0,LockedIn_AI,0,0.82,False

\- walk through 4th West, get another coffee/pastry

\- go into Jericho park, to check out that beach as well as Locarno and Spanish Banks

\- go down to Chancellor to walk through parts of Pacific Spirit on the way to

\- UBC's Anthropology Museum for 1 ½ hour or however long

\- then have a late lunch/early dinner somewhere, prob on the West side 

Am I underestimating the time it'll take? 

Should I bike a part of this instead?

1r8kq1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/RecoveringPessimists/comments/1r8kq1w/lifes_not_over_yet/,Life's not over yet.,"""I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser.""

I (24F) struggle with worrying about ""what am I doing with my life?"". Again, I'm 24 years old. So from a blanket statement POV, I am still just growing up, and hardly an adult. But, that is much easier said than understood.

Growing up, I was the A+ student, gifted child, oldest sibling, ""so mature for your age!"" kid. So I have always felt as though I have it together because that is what I've been told all my life. But now that I am out of school, I'm at a loss of what to do. And I feel as though the more I wait to figure that out, the less time I have to live that life that I'd like to have. Which is simply just stupid.

Whenever I have these thoughts, I like to remind myself of where I am in terms of pop culture, as I find it does make me feel better.

* If I were Taylor Swift, I would be in the stages of writing *1989*. ""The Pop Bible"" would not be release yet, and I would be coming off of a Grammy loss. I still have so much success in front of me.
* If I were Rachel Green, I would be entering a coffee shop in a wedding dress, about to meet my new best friends. That would mean I have a few years before I find my ""dream job""
* If I were Carrie Bradshaw, I would still have 8 years until I'd get my photo put on the side of a bus.

Though it is just a few examples, it helps me put time into perspective. I have plenty of time, and life's not over yet.

On the flip side, it is especially hard to try and figure out what to do with my life, when all I see on social media and the news is horrible. And every day it seems to get worse. It has always been this way, but to have access to these stories in the palm of your hand, makes you feel insignificant and small.

I have always struggled with the ""what do you want to be when you grow up"" question that *everyone* in your life seems to ask you. When I was younger, I wanted to be an actress. That was my ""dream job"" but I never told anyone, or took it seriously because even at a young age, I knew it would almost certainly never happen.

When you grow up rehearsing school shooter drills, living through the economic crash of 2008, witnessing an insensitive man become president, and living through a global pandemic, it becomes hard to realistically/hopefully imagine your future. And so, that brings me to where I am now. I've never allowed myself to dream about what I *actually* want to do with my life, and here I am still, with no answer.

I don't want to waste my time. I don't want to look back on my life and regret not taking risks and trying to find a career I truly want, vs a career that is safe and easy. So somehow, I think I will begin again, and start looking at my life with some optimism.

Sincerely,

A recovering pessimist.",1,1771461713.0,RecoveringPessimists,0,1.0,False
1r8kprp,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1r8kprp/nice_people_in_abusive_systems_are_still_enablers/,Nice people in abusive systems are still enablers.,"I know I post a lot, it's one way to kind of help me get stuff out of my head, just helps me put it all somewhere. Got actual good news yesterday, so that's great, but then I've also got this piece of crap sitting outside my house, and I really don't give a crap anymore, I nearly died the other day, I fainted in the bath, lol. So...

Mandatory military service ruined my life. And something that I found funny was how disgusting I found nice officers to be. Not performatively nice. Like, actually nice officers. Recently, a counselor told me that conscription, or at least my experience of it, sounds like a form of institutional abuse. And that I'm traumatized. My mother- Who is a military veteran, but had a radically different experience and never experienced being a conscript- Has said the same thing.

Well, if it was abuse, then any of those officers who weren't abusers were still enablers. My mom will admit that. She'll admit she was. But I love her because she does everything that she can to understand me, now, and help me heal. Anyhow, there was this officer there, Katerina, I'd say she's in her 30s and was all motherly with me. I think what it was is that, like... Because I look like a girl? And I don't mean like a feminine boy, I mean, literally, people joke about me being basically a woman with a you-know-what. I don't care, I grew my hair out now because I refuse to cut it, I feel pretty. Anyway, at one point, my relationship was falling to bits and after not seeing my girlfriend for three months, I asked her if I could have time off. She felt awful about it, got me a long weekend, then. Or when she kept telling me about this ""cool"" barber down the road and how she'd be happy to give me the money since I apparently needed to get my hair cut because it was getting too long... Or, when she realized I hated barbers, she did it herself, she must have done it fucking blindfolded because I actually shaved it completely after, it looked so godawful... Or when she gave me her phone number, or sends Christmas and birthday presents since I got back...

And looking back, I find her disgusting. I was falling to bits. So a few days ago, I snapped at her over the phone. Yeah, because I just LOVED her bringing me out for boring, stupid walks, going for coffees and as if it meant anything. But she's still friends with my parents, you know? Says that she wants to help me heal, and wants to give me something, if that's okay with me. I was hoping it would be something cool, so I thought, yeah, alright.

So... She had this bike. Not like a fucking Harley, I mean more like one of these moped things, hasn't used it in years and it's a bit old and all this, but said that me and my dad could maybe repair it and then I could use it. And I'm... Honestly, I'm offended. I'm completely offended.

Seriously, I get put through the most disgusting year of my life, being told by her to try and make the best of it, that maybe it's not all bad but just different, trying to be a fucking mom when the one I have is just fine- And for all that shit, I get this shitty bike? And repair work that you're supposed to pretend is rewarding when it's just shit? That's it? That's fucking IT?

My brother is in Croatia with his friends. When he gets back, I'll give him a look, see if he wants the stupid thing. If not, I'll just scrap it.",2,1771461694.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

WARNING: This will be long. 

I‘ve been with my husband for 14 years, married 2, and he is 14 years my senior. 

THE LIE OF MANY LIES: My husband told me his Dr does not recommend a vasectomy reversal due to his age (around 46/47 at that time). 

THE TRUTH: His Dr told him he would refer him to a specialist. He never followed up and told me the lie. He revealed the truth to me over this past summer. He said he was too busy to follow up and I know that to be true. (He was never too busy to cheat) I responded with crying silently in the passenger seat while he is holding my hand saying we can get through anything, right? 

In our first year, he told me he wished he could get me pregnant but I did not bc I was a single mom at that time. I wanted more children but only if I was married. He also had children from his 1st marriage and mistress from his 1st marriage. 

Over the years, I had a change of heart and start asking him about having kids. Whenever I would mention it he would either be silent, say he was scared to get the reversal, or avoid the topic altogether. 

 I should mention, I’ve never had the desire to be married but I love being a mom and want(ed) a nice size family. 

WHY I AM HIS FOOL? THE RUN DOWN.

I met him having a long distance ex-gf. He told me he broke up with her and she knew about me and she did. She knew me as his cousin.  Eventually, all was revealed and I stayed. I should mention he did spend time with her when he went on vacay and told me the reason he didn’t have sex with her bc she refused to take an HIV test. 

Maybe a year later, he cheated on me with his coworker. She called his home and told me when I answered the phone. I left. He asked for forgiveness and like a fool, I forgave him bc I truly thought he was remorseful. THIS IS THE ONLY TIME HE ASKED  FOR FORGIVENESS. 

Not too long after that, he started sexting who I believe now was a coworker at a different workplace. At that time he told me it was one of those scams messages and he decided to entertain it. I stayed again. 

Many years goes by without incident, well I did end the relationship again bc I was absolutely miserable. We we’re separated for a good 6 months. He did not give up on the relationship. He made sure to be involved in whatever I had going on and of course he was dealing with other women unbeknownst to me. I did have a hot second fling months after the breakup.

On our wedding day, a different coworker texted, congratulating him on his marriage. His response: thank you bby. Her response: 😊.

When we went on our vacation, bc we didn’t have a honeymoon, I went through his phone and I was floored. There was woman after woman after woman and exes. Most of the women he was leading on or having an emotional affair with. Thats when I found out about his 10 year paid sexting relationship with his coworker. Subscriptions to onlyfans, the women he was dealing with during our breakup (Idc but he made it seemed like he wasn’t  dealing with anyone else. He also told me that his child never seen him with another woman other than me, that was also a lie.) He also lied about not taking the 2nd c shot. (Now, I’m not going to debate anyone in the comments about this.)  He knew my stance on it. 

 Everyone who meets and work with my husband think he’s this great guy and he is. He’s just never been a great partner. He’s great employee, a great provider as a father, and kind hearted. He will help ppl in need if he has it, he will even buy your coffee if you don’t have enough. 

From the beginning, I’ve been open with my husband. He never had a reason to cheat. BUT. According to him, asking him for quality time was too much complaining for him. Presently, I spend 2 full days with my husband out of the month and that’s not always guarantee. He is always at work, and it been this way since I met him. Our disagreements has consistently been about quality time. 

Presently, I’m angry. I’m angry that I didn’t listen to my body and spirit. After he cheated on me the first time, my water well dried up. It was mostly a desert up 2 years ago. I’m angry that I didn’t listen to my intuition before I said I do. Although marriage wasn’t a priority for me, I take it seriously. I wanted to do it once and one time only. No divorce and now that’s all I’m thinking about it. I’m angry bc one of my dreams in life was to have a complete family. I wanted a child with my husband. I wanted to have that wholeness.  

Im here bc I literally don’t have anyone to talk to.

1r8klq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/murfreesboro/comments/1r8klq1/anyone_else_having_trouble_with_the_dating_scene/,Anyone else having trouble with the dating scene here?,"As embarrassing as it is to say, I (36 m) have been struggling in this area for a long time. Here are some of the sources/aspects of the difficulty I've been having:

* I'm on dating apps, and have been for a long time, but I don't get many matches. Even setting that aside, though, I just don't seem to connect with most of the women on there. I'd say this is largely a matter of having very different interests. Most of the profiles I see list interests like concerts, dogs, road trips, and coffee. Most of my interests are a bit on the nerdier or more male-dominated side (video editing, philosophy, gaming, etc.). 
* Another difficulty is that people here tend to be religious, whereas I'm not. Similarly, most people here are monogamous, whereas I'm not. 
* I know some might recommend moving beyond dating apps and trying cold approaches. But cold approaches don't strike me as all that viable, given that there's not much of a nightlife here, and I'm not the bar type anyway. Women in most contexts I find myself in (getting groceries, shopping, etc.) seem to just want to be left alone, and I want to respect that. 
* Since I'm not religious, meeting someone at church isn't an avenue open to me.
* At my age (36), I'm well out of school, so the prospect of meeting someone at school/university is likewise out.
* I work remotely, so meeting someone at work isn't really an option, either.
* I was thinking of going to Magic/DnD events at the Dragon's Hoard, but if they're like other events of that type that I've seen, they're probably male-dominated, and the few women there are probably taken... and I'd hate to risk becoming ""that guy"" and making things awkward if I dare to express interest in anyone I get to know from such an event. I suppose one other alternative is to look into events hosted at the library, but that's really about all I can think of at the moment.

Looking back on all this, I wanted to ask, how might someone in my circumstances, or even roughly my circumstances, go about trying to find a partner? (Is there any realistic option beyond ""move to a big city""?) Has anyone else here (man or woman) been having trouble with the dating scene?

For full disclosure, I'm aware that finding a partner is made all the more unlikely in my case by the fact that I'm currently living with my parents. (To make a long story short, I lived out of state on my own for many years, but had a job situation fall through a while back and have moved back in with my parents while trying to get established in something new. I think I might stay here long-term, though, as my parents are getting older and could conceivably need more of my help soon, and they enjoy having me around. Also, from past experience, I can say that having my own place hasn't seemed to help me all that much when it came to dating anyway.) I like to think that perhaps there's someone out there who'll judge me for the person I am rather than my living situation, but in any case, I'm interested in hearing any tips/thoughts people might have.",3,1771461388.0,murfreesboro,5,0.67,False

1r8kl2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1r8kl2a/tifu_i_tried_to_surprise_my_girlfriend_at_work/,TIFU I tried to surprise my girlfriend at work and accidentally got her sent home,"This happened yesterday in boise and i still feel like a walking red flag. My girlfriend works front desk at a dental office. very chill place, small team, older patients, the kind of job where everyone knows everyone.

She’s been stressed lately, so i thought i’d be cute and surprise her with lunch. nothing dramatic. Just her favorite sandwich and an iced coffee. boyfriend points unlocked, right?

I walk in around noon. the waiting room is half full. she sees me and smiles but it’s that tight smile like oh no what are you doing here.

I lean on the counter and say surprise. She laughs awkwardly and whispers that she’s slammed. i’m like it’s fine, i’ll wait.
This is where my brain leaves the building...
One of the older patients walks up to check in. i step back but i’m still right there. the patient starts giving her info. name, birthday, medical stuff. and i just… stand there holding a sandwich like an idiot listening to someone’s entire dental history.

My girlfriend keeps glancing at me. i think she’s just embarrassed i’m hovering.

After like five minutes, the office manager comes out. very polite. very corporate smile. she asks me to step aside. says for privacy reasons i can’t be near the desk while patients are checking in.

I apologize. move to the chairs. But now the damage is done.

Manager pulls my girlfriend into the back. they’re gone for like 20 minutes. when she comes out, she won’t look at me. tells me she’s being sent home for the day because it was a privacy violation.

She says it’s not fully her fault but they’ve warned them before about friends or partners hanging around the desk.

I was trying to be thoughtful. instead i made her look unprofessional and possibly put her job at risk because i needed to feel like boyfriend of the year.

She says it’s fine. but it’s not fine. you can tell when someone says it’s fine but their shoulders are stiff. I dropped off the food and left.
Now i’m replaying how i just stood there like a clueless golden retriever while she was clearly stressed.

TL;DR: tried to surprise my girlfriend at her front desk job with lunch, accidentally hovered while patients shared private info, office sent her home for a privacy violation and now i feel like i might’ve messed up her job because i wanted to be cute.

1r8kjza,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1r8kjza/aitah_dumped_friend_3_weeks_before_her_birthday/,AITAH  Dumped friend 3 weeks before her birthday,"I apologise for the length of this in advance. A few years ago, I moved to a new town. Around the same time, I lost a lot of weight and needed some clothes altered. I found a woman locally, we met and I gave her a few pieces and she did \*excellent\* work. I was really pleased. Every month or so I'd bring her a couple new pieces to alter. Some times she didn't finish when she said she would. She said she was busy, etc., and I let it slide because, as I said, she did excellent work and I didn't know anyone in this town, nor did I know any other seamstresses.

About a year into doing these pieces for me, she asked if I'd like to go out for a coffee. I didn't have any women friends in my new town, so I agreed. (We are both in our 50s, by the way. She is a year older.) We started going out to coffee, lunches and to lots of films, which we both love. However, more and more she started canceling dates, rearranging our schedule at the last minute, showing up late or not at all, etc. I was frequently annoyed, but brushed it off. She has four adult sons and many grandchildren and I thought it was just family life getting in the way.

Then several times I'd book her services and she wouldn't even be home when I tried to drop off the piece. Another time she promised to finish tailoring a suit I planned to wear to my husband's mother's funeral. We went to pick it up and she wasn't home. We had to leave as we had a plane to catch for the funeral. I was really angry and told her how I felt. She said she thought we had planned to meet another day. I would remind her over and over again about commitments, drop-off dates/times, but she'd laugh them off. I soon found out she had lost most of her customers (and her friends) because she was so irresponsible. I mentioned to a mutual friend that maybe??  something was wrong with her mentally, early onset dementia, something like that. The other woman said, ""Oh hell no, she's been like that the entire 25 years I've known her!"" If she finds something better to do than see you, she'll do it.

Still, I'd take pieces to her because I needed them altered and knew no one else that could do it, it's a small town (and no, I cannot sew myself. I have tried, even took classes, but I'm horrible at it).

I was often quite hurt by her actions, even though she claimed I was her ""mega-special friend"", and I started to reflect on other things. We had a good time when we DID manage to go out, and she was still occassionally altering items for me, but there were things that made me really question just WHY I was friends with her. She'd NEVER tip anyone. She said it wasn't her fault if another person chose to have a shitty job. She had to be \*first\* in everything. She had to have the \*best\* of everything. She once switched a piece of birthday cake at a party because the other person's piece was bigger and had more frosting. She'd screw people over for the smallest amounts of money (like at car boot sales). She'd run little scams on secondhand sites.  She tried to get \*anything\* and everything for free if at all possible. She'd get quite jealous if I went out with other friends, put them down and call them ""old"" and ""boring"".  All these things started adding up. I must mention she has plenty of disposable income,  she didn't do these things out of desperation. She also tried to get me to lie to my husband about purchases, or anything (I wouldn't), because ""husbands don't deserve to know everything. They are there to make the money. We are there to look pretty.""  I told her she was ridiculous, but I laughed because \*surely\* it had to be a joke.

She started buying me expensive gifts for Christmas and my birthday and I did for her, as well, even though I wanted to scale back. I just didn't have the balls to tell her.  I know, I'm a wimp. She'd put me down very subtlely, just enough to let me know that she was prettier, thinner and richer than I. It worked, as I have a history of being put down by my parents. It made me want to impress her, I guess, just like I used to do with my parents, and, perversely, crave their approval.  


Anyway, I booked an overnight stay for the two of us at a little spa to get some pampering treats, for her birthday. She knew about the spa. I asked her \*three times\* before I booked the date and she said she was free. She texted me yesterday and told me that she and her husband decided to go to Mexico on the date and sorry, she knew I'd be ""disappointed"".  I was furious, then I wasn't. I simply didn't care. 

I refuse to answer any of her texts, asking me to ""talk to her"". I had also bought her a couple gifts, and returned them to the stores today. Another friend of mine said maybe I should just send her a card and wish her a happy birthday when the time comes. I have no intention of doing so, but this other friend said she'd probably be quite hurt. It pains me to say it, but I don't care. I'm just done. I feel like my kind and giving nature has been taken advantage of so many times, and I humiliated myself in the process. She has no respect for my time, effort, money or marriage.

My husband said she's an extremely selfish, stuck-up woman and I'm well rid of her. I do have several other friends, who are kind to strangers, respectful of my time and with whom I have a lot of fun.

1r8ki72,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1r8ki72/she_left_me_on_valentines_day_because_we_were_no/,She left me on Valentine’s Day because we “were no longer meshing well” and I am completely lost,"She was my first girlfriend, met her my junior year (her sophomore) of hs, we had a long talking stage, and we started dating halfway through my senior year. Everything was perfect pretty much from December of 2024 until September of 2025 when I left for college and last semester we really didn’t even argue much.

This semester has been different in that I’m under much more stress and she has developed a tendency to push my buttons. A lot of phone calls and texts would end up with me being called mean or something to that effect because my mind would be somewhere else or she would just straight up annoy me.

   I decided to come up Thursday to visit for Valentine’s Day. I saw her Friday morning for coffee, and Friday night we decided to go to the gym together and went to her place afterwards. The gym went fine but when I got to her house I noticed she was acting kinda distant and I asked her what the matter was, she said nothing was wrong. 

Now come Saturday (Valentine’s Day), she had a thing with friends in the morning, so she told me she couldn’t come over until 12:45, I went to the store at abour 12:10 to get her some flowers and stuff, and got like 20 calls at the register which I knew were from her. I get outside and answer and she’s furious with me for not being home when I told her to come over, even though she said she wouldn’t be done for another 30 minutes by the time I was headed home. She left my house super mad but came over maybe an hour or two later before she had to go to work.

Once she was at my house she was really super distant, didn’t seem to want to even be near me. And she told me if I “was mean at all” she would just leave immediately. She said something to me that was a little rude and I just kinda acted confused and asked what she was talking about. She said “that’s it” and left and on her way out said I’ll see you tonight, to which I very stupidly relied “yeah we’ll see about that”.

After she left my house she asked what we’d be doing the next day because I said I didn’t want to see her. I immediately texted her back and apologized profusely, not only for that specific instance but just for how things have been lately overall. And said I really wanted to see her that night. The conversation then took a turn towards what the issue is, I took a majority of the blame for letting stress make me snippy. She asked if I thought it could be fixed, I said yes. She apparently disagreed. She then decided she wanted to end things and “wanted it to be mutual” (it’s definitely not!) and gave me a whole list of flimsy reasons about how we don’t really have a future together and how we stopped getting along. Then she said she’d come over after work so we could talk about this.

She comes over at about 8:30 and sits on my couch and I pour my heart out telling her that I love her, I don’t know what I’m supposed to do without her, and most importantly that it did not have to end and could easily be fixed. She again didn’t agree on that point. She told me she still loves me and she wants to remain friendly and a part of each other’s lives. But she insists on no contact for a while.

   I agreed but I’ve been really struggling with how abrupt and confusing this experience is. For the last 14 months she was really the only person I shared my emotions with. So I waited 3 days before I completely fell apart on the drive back home and texted her just asking for a quick talk to I could say what was left unsaid. She completely ignored me. 

   Me and her have a mutual friend who’s been there for me in this and super helpful. That friend told me that my ex is also really struggling and had read my messages but didn’t respond to me so she can have some space. That same friend later told me that I really need to not message her for a good bit because she feels like she has no room to breathe, and also so she could have time to miss me.

   But the result of this is that I’ve developed panic attacks, I have dreams about her multiple times a night, I can’t eat, and it’s on my mind all day. And I have no one to turn to really because I can’t express how I really feel to anyone but her. I’ve decided to wait at the bare minimum a week, likely 2 before I reach out again. But this is torture for me and I don’t know how I’m gonna last.

Got actual good news yesterday, so that's great, but then I've also got this piece of crap sitting outside my house, and I really don't give a crap anymore, I nearly died the other day, I fainted in the bath, lol. So...

Mandatory military service ruined my life. And something that I found funny was how disgusting I found nice officers to be. Not performatively nice. Like, actually nice officers. Recently, a counselor told me that conscription, or at least my experience of it, sounds like a form of institutional abuse. And that I'm traumatized. My mother- Who is a military veteran, but had a radically different experience and never experienced being a conscript- Has said the same thing.

Well, if it was abuse, then any of those officers who weren't abusers were still enablers. My mom will admit that. She'll admit she was. But I love her because she does everything that she can to understand me, now, and help me heal. Anyhow, there was this officer there, Katerina, I'd say she's in her 30s and was all motherly with me. I think what it was is that, like... Because I look like a girl? And I don't mean like a feminine boy, I mean, literally, people joke about me being basically a woman with a you-know-what. I don't care, I grew my hair out now because I refuse to cut it, I feel pretty. Anyway, at one point, my relationship was falling to bits and after not seeing my girlfriend for three months, I asked her if I could have time off. She felt awful about it, got me a long weekend, then. Or when she kept telling me about this ""cool"" barber down the road and how she'd be happy to give me the money since I apparently needed to get my hair cut because it was getting too long... Or, when she realized I hated barbers, she did it herself, she must have done it fucking blindfolded because I actually shaved it completely after, it looked so godawful... Or when she gave me her phone number, or sends Christmas and birthday presents since I got back...

And looking back, I find her disgusting. I was falling to bits. So a few days ago, I snapped at her over the phone. Yeah, because I just LOVED her bringing me out for boring, stupid walks, going for coffees and as if it meant anything. But she's still friends with my parents, you know? Says that she wants to help me heal, and wants to give me something, if that's okay with me. I was hoping it would be something cool, so I thought, yeah, alright.

So... She had this bike. Not like a fucking Harley, I mean more like one of these moped things, hasn't used it in years and it's a bit old and all this, but said that me and my dad could maybe repair it and then I could use it. And I'm... Honestly, I'm offended. I'm completely offended.

Seriously, I get put through the most disgusting year of my life, being told by her to try and make the best of it, that maybe it's not all bad but just different, trying to be a fucking mom when the one I have is just fine- And for all that shit, I get this shitty bike? And repair work that you're supposed to pretend is rewarding when it's just shit? That's it? That's fucking IT?

1r8kcot,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1r8kcot/sp_split_coffee/,[SP] Split Coffee,"It was a big day for me. I had to pitch to the investors, and I was already nervous. As I approached the hotel where our meeting was scheduled, I noticed a man standing outside holding a cup. He stood out to me from a mile away because he was wearing a thick zebra print cardigan... in July.

As I walked past, he threw the contents of the cup in my direction. It smelled like coffee. I was waiting for the burn to follow, but it never came, it was cold. I looked down at my white shirt and saw it was covered in a brown stain. The crotch of my trousers also now looked like I'd had an accident on the way over. I'm not an aggressive man, but my blood boiled. ""You fucking idiot!"" I shouted and turned around to give him a piece of my mind, but he had already cleared off, probably for the best... for his sake.

I walked into the hotel, and my boss was waiting at reception. ""I'm so sorry..."" I said. His eyes widened. I knew this was bad.

""No, no, no!"" he exclaimed. ""I can stall them for an hour. Go home and get changed, as fast as you can!""

I stepped on it the whole way home and pulled into my apartment block's car park. I was about to open the lift door when something caught my attention. There was someone in a car, the windows were steamed up, and something told me to check it out.

I tapped on the window, but there was no response, so I opened the driver's door. There was a man sitting there, looking on the brink of death. My heart began to race, and I shook him. He was still awake, but barely. He tried to speak,
""inch... in... in..."" then finally managed the word... ""insulin.""

""Shit,"" I thought. ""He's diabetic."" I pulled open the glove box... nothing. There was nothing in his car. He was parked over number 10, so I grabbed his keys and ran to the 10th apartment, asking Siri to call an ambulance and putting my phone on speaker as I ran.

""Check his fridge,"" the operator told me. And there it was, the needle. I ran as fast as I could back to the car park, and the call operator talked me through administering the insulin. Slowly, the man started to come around just as the ambulance arrived.

A week later, I had shaken off the shock of the whole event. My manager had managed to reschedule the meeting with our investors, and I was making dinner when a knock came at my door.

It was the man from the car park. He was holding a gift bag. He put out his hand. ""I'm Phillip,"" he said. ""You saved my life, man.""

""Come in,"" I said. ""I'll stick the kettle on.""

Phillip came in and took off his coat, and I noticed he was wearing that same zebra print cardigan I recognised. ""I'm being followed by this damn ugly ass cardigan"", I thought.

""Nice cardigan,"" I said.

""Thanks,"" said Phillip. ""It's my husband's."" He paused for a moment before adding, ""I lost him a few years back in a car accident, but I wear it when I'm having a shit time. Feels like I'm getting a hug from him again.""

My heart broke for him, and I realised he must live alone.

""Take down my number, man,"" I said. ""I'm only up a flight of stairs. If there's ever another emergency, give me a buzz.""

""Honestly, I couldn't be more grateful. I owe you so much,"" he told me. ""I messaged you on WhatsApp there, so you should have my number too.""

We drank our tea, and I plated up some spare dinner for Phillip before he called it a night.

Later, I clicked into the message on WhatsApp. 'It's Phillip' it read. I went to save his number when his profile picture caught my eye. I clicked to zoom in. It was Phillip, looking a bit younger, under a banner that said 'Just Married' with his arm around another man... it was the man who threw the coffee over me that morning.",1,1771460735.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

What do I do now?,"This is quite a long story as it's a problem that has been brewing for a long time. I think my mum may be a narcissist, or at least have some narcissistic traits, everything has blown up and I have no idea what to do now.

Here's a bit of context before I get to the recent stuff, the issue is my mum and my husband can't get along....

My mum has always been there to look after me when I was growing up, she was a single parent so it wasn't easy. She could be dismissive of (minor) physical injuries/illness or when I was anxious/stressed, but she always did her best to provide for me, despite being a single mother. Looking back I realised she has never said 'I love you', 'I'm proud of you', or anything resembling that sentiment. She was very lenient on some things, not having a super strict bedtime, snacks were allowed (she cooked homemade meals from scratch, so a little chocolate wasn't terrible in terms of health), tv in bedroom, messy arts and crafts were fine. Other things she was very strict on, don't make a mistake or I will be yelled at (hit when I was young, up till I was maybe 8-10years old), no swearing, not even 'dam', even as a married adult she scalded me for swearing. And the judgement, oh dear god the judgment. Everything I do is judged, even if I did something well it could still have been better, been perfect.

I'm now 30, my husband is 31. My mums gifts to us at Christmas and  birthdays have became more expensive. For example she spent about £600 on a ring for my 30th, and a play station 5 for my husband for his 30th (he's now 31). Me and my husband bought our home in the same village she's in, about 6yrs ago. She's had 2 surgeries in the last couple of years, so she recovered in mine and my husbands home. First time she stayed for 5weeks the next was 3 weeks. Everything I did while she stayed with us was wrong or simply not good enough, I didn't hoover the floor properly, the bookshelves were too dusty, she didn't fancy what I planned to make for dinner. Comments about why doesn't my husband do more around the house, he leaves his stuff everywhere. ect. She is a hoarder btw, there is a narrow path running through the rooms she uses in her home and it stinks of dog. She has a small dog which I looked after while she was recovering and when she goes on holiday.

She comes up for dinner as we are so close to each others homes, she's always turning up late 10+mins, she broke her oven 5yrs ago and never replaced it, she just came up to our more often, though in the last year or so she doesn't come up anywhere near as much.

When me and my husband where still boyfriend/girlfriend, she asked me why I was with him, as though the idea of me being with someone was unthinkable. I always got the impression she had a problem with my husband, now whether she simply doesn't approve of my marriage to him (married for a little over 4yrs, she attended and gave me away), or wants me back 'under her thumb' , I'm not sure.

Now to the more recent stuff...

Just over 2 weeks ago, she came up for dinner, we ate, chilled, my husband came home from work around 7:30pm. Normally he would immediately offer to drive her home, its about a 10min walk or a 2 min drive. This time he didn't, due to the tension that has been rising between them, he's fed up of her expecting him to do whatever she wants. Mum will leave used tissues, coffee mugs, and bottles of water that she insists on having, until about a year ago we were paying for those bottles too. He would be 'grumpy', her word, and play games on his phone, he does 12hr shifts and comes home very tired as it's quite physical. I offered to reheat his dinner while he showered, normal for us, so he did and put pjs on after. We were all sitting on the sofa /armchair after that, on phones relaxing. Around 9:40pm he burped, she gave a 'eww' sound and a face that could curdle milk. He stated that she 'didn't have to listen to it'. Her response was to say 'your right, I don't' and storm out of our home, whilst yelling at her dog to come on. I herded the dog out as I could see she was angry and I remember trying to avoid that when I lived with her as she was always unreasonable. Like being in front of a jury that had already decided you were guilty. This was a Sunday.

Monday I texted her to see if she was still coming for dinner as pre arranged, she said that maybe its better she didn't after 'yesterdays little scenario'. I didn't respond.

Tuesday I messaged again about dinner, she responded that my husband has made it clear he doesn't want her there, so she will just come up when he's not there.

I already had to manage cooking for 3 people, all of which have different tastes, I'm not working around her only coming up when he's not around and the days she goes to bingo ect. So I made sure she was ok for us to go to her house, and me and my husband went round. I said lets have a civilised conversation about what's irritating you both and see if we can get to a solution. As soon as I said one of you start, she began yelling, which turned into screaming. He accepted responsibility for most of what she screamed he did/said at the start. He spoke calmly and to be honest I'm quite proud that he kept so cool considering her behaviour. She screamed at him the whole time, and I mean the whole time and he sat there and took it. I could see him shutting down from the 'conversation', so I encouraged him to say what had been annoying him. Every time he spoke, she interrupted him with screaming that she didn't say that or she didn't do that. She demanded times when she did something that he said, and when he gave examples, which took forever to get out due to her interrupting, she would focus on the weakest one and downplay it, also stating she's an adult who can do whatever she wants. She also threw that she may have a brain tumour and has to go for tests, which he knew nothing about. (She blames her health for a lot of problems, like why her house is filled to the brim with stuff.) My husband said 'my wife still isn't allowed to swear in front of you, that's not right'. She responded with 'it's not my fault my daughter respects me enough not to swear in front of me'. Which makes this next bit a little ironic...

After maybe 30-35mins of this I was on the verge of tears as it was a very stressful situation and reminded me of all the times she had yelled at me growing up. I said that we weren't getting anywhere with this so we should leave. My husband stood and walked to the front door to go, as I went to follow after she yelled/growled at me 'what are you crying for?' I will be honest this next part was not my finest moment. I turned to her filled with rage and upset at how she speaks to me all the time, and I said 'because your a f...ing b.....' (Not sure if I can put a swear words here.) That made her pause her yelling...for about 3 seconds.

Here's a rough idea of what was said, I was yelling back at her btw. Side note as relevant, I had to reduce my working hours from 50/week to 10/week due to medical reasons, lot's of physical pain...

Mum: He doesn't work hard, he has no respect.

Me: He does work hard. He.. (I was interrupted)

Mum: I don't mean at (insert his workplace name here).

Me: I don't mean at (his place of work) either, he does so much for me but you don't see it. He does housework that I can't do anymore, he cooks way more than he used to because I can't, he get me medication and hot water bottles when I need it and does everything he can to reduce my pain and take care of me. He drives me to appointments and anywhere else I want to go. But you don't see any of this, your too busy judging him.

Mum: He has no respect, he doesn't respect me. Maybe you should have married someone with more respect.

Me: He has more respect than you do.

There was a little more back and forth, but I can't remember what was said.

I said I there was no talking to her and we left. I spent the rest of the day crying on and off. Part of me felt guilty for what I called her, but I knew it had to come out, years and years of pent up frustration, anger and judgement from her all came out of me in the space of a few minutes.

Iv'e spent almost every day looking at traits of narcissistic mothers, what to look out for, what to do. ect.

A few days later she sent an attachment on fb messenger, I didn't respond. She sent a message 'Are you not speaking?' I didn't respond. She tried calling twice. I didn't answer.

Then almost 2 weeks since we went to hers and she yelled. Her friend, lets call her Jane for this, knocked on my door. I knew she would come round at some point, Jane can't help but get involved in everything and she goes to see my mum almost daily. I answered the door as I was curious to see what she had to say. She asked if she could come in so I said sure.

Here's roughly the conversation...

Jane: How are you?

Me : Ok I suppose.

Jane: No I mean with (medical conditions).

Me: Just carrying on.

Jane: Where's (husband's name).

Me: Asleep, he's on night shifts.

Jane: Oh. Would you rather he was here.

Me: Doesn't matter to me.

Jane: Ok. Your mum is worried about your mental health, that your not happy. (fyi, my mum doesn't believe in mental health, if someone has metal health problems they are weak in her mind.)

Me: That would be a first.

Jane: So, what happened?

Me: You will have to be a bit more specific, this has been going on for a while now.

Jane: Yeah, on Sunday.

Me: Well what did mum tell you? Then I can fill in the blanks.

Jane: (shrugs) (Husband) burped and your mum left.

Me: I see. (I told her what happened.)

Jane: Well maybe you didn't hear the tone, that can make a difference.

Me: I was right next to them on the sofa...

She asked about the day we went round to mum, I explained from my point of view.

Jane: So what do we do now? Lock them in a room together until they sort it out?

Me: I don't know. But it can't continue the way it has been, something has to give.

Jane: You do know your mum may have a brain tumour, and she has... (I interrupted)

Me: Yes, I know. However that doesn't give her the right to speak to everyone however she likes.

Jane: Mmm. What about another meeting somewhere neutral, at mine or a café? Would (husband) be ok with that?

Me: I would have to ask him. It's up to him.

Jane: Do you want to ask him and then let me know?

Me: I will ask him and see what he says. But if there is another meeting there can't be any yelling and everyone has to listen and take on board what is being said, and then change.

Jane: Ok. (She stood to leave) You know you can always talk to me whenever you need?

Me: I know.

We said bye and she left. I don't trust her to be at a meeting, or to talk to her. Anything she is told she goes and tells everyone else, even when instructed not to.

I told my husband that Jane came round and what was said, I asked if he would be willing to have another meeting with mum, with or without Jane. He really doesn't want to, as he doesn't want to risk being yelled at again. He's fed up of the drama.

So now everyone is waiting for me to decide what to do and I really don't know. The logical part of me tells me that my mum is a narcissist, or at least has a negative impact on my life. The other part of me is saying that she's my mum, she raised me and looked after me for so many years.

But how can I give either of them up? My husband has made me a better person. It took me 7months of being together to say 'I love you' to him, he was so overjoyed that I said it back. We have known each other for over 15yrs. My husband has said he's proud of me on many occasions. He is the best part of my life and I don't ever want to give him up, not even for my own mum. If me and my husband broke up I would have no choice but to live with my mum again, I can't financially afford not to. If no resolution is found my choice seem clear. Leave my husband and live under the roof of a potential narcissist, or cut contact with my mum and live happily with my husband, but always have a nagging guilt that I abandoned the woman who raised me.

If anyone has any suggestions on what I should do now, I would really appreciate it. I know that either mum or Jane will be wanting an answer soon on what do we all do now, but I simply don't know.

Thanks to anyone who managed to read all of this.

**(CW- Suicide)**

The rapture happened today.

That’s what everyone is calling it, at least.

It wasn’t like in stories where the clouds part and angelic horns sound, and those who earned their place lift into the sky, surrounded by golden light. There was no pomp and circumstance, no signs; no angels came from the heavens to pick the righteous. The Lord didn’t look upon the earth, ethereal and beyond human comprehension. Gabriel didn’t descend and beckon the chosen to paradise.

No.

They were just… gone.

People woke that morning to family members gone from their beds. Reports from journalists later said that the beds looked freshly made, as if they’d never even been slept in. Children, husbands, wives, parents — all gone in the night.

At first, no one knew how widespread it was; most people in my neighborhood speculated a mass kidnapping in the cul-de-sac. Some shady underground human trafficking group had targeted our small, quiet community, swooping in during the dead of night to take entire families.

Police were called, lines were busy, people on hold. That’s when it started to become clear that this wasn’t just in our neighborhood. Throughout the day, the news reported that the mass disappearances had happened all over the world — America, the UK, Poland, Asia, Africa — everywhere, people were missing.

Churches, synagogues, mosques — religious buildings filled with people wanting answers, wanting community.

I had woken up that morning none the wiser. I live alone, so I didn’t know about the issue until I heard my neighbor Stacy yelling for her son Henry. He was a rambunctious kid, always leaving the house as soon as he woke up, never telling his mom. So this was a normal occurrence. What wasn’t normal was the multitude of voices that joined Stacy’s.

Curiosity pulled me outside only to see neighbors out in their robes and pajamas, with panic-stricken faces. As they yelled for their children or their significant other, a few kids even came out in cartoon-printed pajamas calling for their parents.

I stood and watched the panic and confusion for a moment before Stacy saw me, rushing over, clutching her robe closed, her house slippers scuffing against the concrete as she approached.

“Jen, have you seen Henry? He always comes when I yell for him,” she asked, her voice laced with barely held-together panic.

“No, I just woke up.”

“Your house cameras — can you check them? Please, Jen,” she asked, voice cracking.

“Yeah, of course,” I told her, pulling up the camera feed on my phone.

Stacy moved closer, pressing tight to my side to get a better view of my phone screen. I rolled the time back to last night and let it play, occasionally fast-forwarding. Stacy watched, her hand tightening on her robe as the video played and showed a normal night. A possum passed by looking for an unsecured trash can, but nothing sinister. Henry never appeared — no creepy vans or people. In fact, no one appeared in the video feed, which was odd because to get out of the cul-de-sac, you have to pass by my house, as it's one of the last houses leading out of the area.

The video played until it reached Stacy stepping out onto her front lawn.

“I don’t… I don’t understand. I need to call the police.” She pulled her phone from her pocket with shaky hands and dialed.

As Stacy called the police, I watched as the rest of the neighbors outside did the same.

“What the hell do you mean you're putting me on hold? You’re emergency dispatch — you can’t do holds!” one of the neighbors, Mr. Hernandez, yelled into his phone. “My wife is missing, her car’s still in our driveway, half my neighborhood is gone!”

Stacy started to panic, gripping her phone to her ear with both hands. “No, no, don't put me on hold! My baby is missing. I need someone to find him, please! He’s only seven, he can’t… hello?” She made a sharp hiccuping sound as she looked at me, wide-eyed and teary. “They put me on hold — they can—what's happening?”

That was the question everyone had, and no one had the answers.

I went to my contacts and found my mom’s number. My hands shook. My heart soared as the line clicked, overjoyed I was about to hear my mom’s soft voice — only for my stomach to bottom out at her voicemail.

“Hello, this is Cheryl. Sorry I missed your call. Leave a message and I’ll call you back.”

A sharp beep followed, and I left a short message.

“Mom, call me back. Something weird is going on. Please, please call me back. Okay? I love you.”

That was all this morning.

Now I’m sitting in my living room watching the news as reports continue to come in — about cars crashed or just sitting vacant on the sides of highways and city streets, completely empty with no signs of struggle. Planes fell from the sky as the pilots vanished, killing the passengers on board. Reports tried to calculate how widespread it was, and it was horrifying, to say the least. By noon, reports were in the millions. By four, billions.

My mom hasn’t called.

I decided I’m making the drive to Kentucky to see for certain if she’s been raptured — or whatever this is supposed to be. Hopefully she just lost her phone charger again, and I'm worried for nothing.





I made the trip to my mom’s house much faster than expected. Normally the drive would take me a little over six hours; I made it in four and a half. The lack of traffic on the interstate was eerie, to say the least — driving miles before seeing another car.

The most unsettling part of the drive was seeing all the abandoned vehicles on the side of the interstate. I had to drive around some that had stopped in the middle of the road, drifting to sit diagonally in one of the lanes. Some of the squeezes were too tight, and I had to use the shoulder or drive through the grass median. During one of the times I had to ease between a black Mercedes and an old, rusted Ford F-150, I looked into the passenger-side back seat and saw an empty car seat, the question lingering of whether the kid had also disappeared or if they were alone now.

The entire drive I bounced between listening to the radio and reports from witnesses — live interviews with people who had someone raptured. The interviews were the worst to listen to: people sobbing into the microphone, begging for their loved ones to just come back home, begging whoever took them to bring them back. Still not believing that this was something beyond human possibility, that this was divine — whether holy or hellish was still to be determined.

When the interviews became too much, I listened to music.

I also spent the whole drive calling my mom’s phone and listening to it ring through my car speakers, only for it to direct to her voicemail. My mind drifted between the horrifying idea that she was gone and the much more optimistic one that my old, technologically impaired mother had just lost her phone, or had once again set it to silent. It was the only thing that kept me sane on the drive to her small town.

My mom’s old Buick sat in her driveway. I pulled my sedan right in behind it, cutting the engine as I looked at the house, hope fluttering in my chest. The curtains were all drawn and the front door was closed — something my mom never did. Even when it was chilly out, she would have it open. She always said the storm door kept out enough of the cold. She liked to stand at the front door and watch the birds and squirrels eat from the feeders she had out front.

I walked up to the front door past the flower beds and up the cobblestone walk. The porch creaked under my feet as I opened the storm door. I grabbed the doorknob and turned — locked. Taking a steadying breath, I opened it with my spare, then stepped inside.

The sweet artificial smell of the sugar cookie candles my mom loved greeted me as I stepped inside, along with the glass cabinet full of her favorite tchotchkes that she always swore would be worth something one day.

“Mom?” I called out.

Only to flinch when a loud squawk was my reply, followed by a sharp chirping whistle.

“Feed pretty bird, feed the pretty bird!”

The rattling of a cage followed.

I walked into the living room only to see my mom’s macaw standing on one of his perches, shaking his cage with one foot, wings battering the bars and kicking up the plucked feathers at the bottom.

“Pretty bird, food. Food for the pretty bird!” he shrieked, even louder when he saw me.

I walked over and opened the door on the side before he came clambering out, flapping and making a racket as he climbed to the top of his cage. Pouring some seed into his bowl as he chattered nonsense while he waited, I called out again.

“Mom!”

There was no way she didn’t hear Romeo screaming his head off.

I made my way through the bottom level, then headed upstairs, looking through every room — because maybe she fell? I tried to keep my hands from shaking as I found the top floor empty too. I headed back downstairs, pulling my phone from my pocket to call her again.

Her ringtone sounded from somewhere in the kitchen.

I found it next to the pink glass vase of grocery store roses she liked to buy for herself. Picking it up, I hit the decline button and shoved mine back in my pocket before opening the screen on hers — only to be met with all twenty-two of my missed calls and the four voicemails.

I walked dazed back into the living room where Romeo was now happily preening his feathers, making soft sounds. I dropped into my mom’s well-worn recliner, the fabric on the arm practically threadbare, the yellow foam peeking through in spots. The middle sank low from decades of use, the granny-square afghan she covered up with to watch TV draped over the back.

I’ve been here five hours, curled up in her chair covered in her vibrant handmade granny-square afghan, her phone sitting next to my own on the side table. The TV plays just for background noise as Romeo trills and ruffles his feathers while pacing the ramps and perches my mom had made specifically for him. She said he was a bird and was used to being up high, so it was cruel to have him walk on the floor — and it was hard for her to bend down and pick him up anyway.

I woke up with my neck sore from falling asleep in her chair. I checked the time and saw that it was seven in the morning. I had slept the whole night in the chair. I walked the house again, calling out for my mom, only to be met with the same silence as yesterday.

She hadn’t come back home last night.

My mother has been raptured.





The past month has been a lot. I spent a week at my mother’s home carefully packing away her things into designated piles—things to keep, to throw out, to donate. I wrapped all her Precious Moments, Hummels, and Lladró figures in old newspapers she kept to use as firestarters in the hearth, carefully tucking them away in a suitcase I’d found in the hall closet. Photo albums, books full of delicately pressed flowers she’d cut from her garden, crystals and geodes she’d gotten from a kitschy little magic shop she adored—all went into plastic totes from her garage, tagged with sticky notes and magic marker, set aside to be taken home with me.

Getting Romeo home was harder than I thought. All of his perches and ramps were a pain to take down, and he screeched at me the whole time. His cage wouldn’t fit into my sedan standing up and had to be broken down, so I had to wrestle the now-angry bird into a cardboard box with a fuzzy throw at the bottom. He yelled, and his wings battered the sides of the box as I put him in the front seat of my car, along with the other priceless things I could fit—the albums, the flower pressings, and all her favorite little bric-a-brac. The rest I would have shipped once I found a shipping company that still had enough employees to even do the job.

After locking up the house, I walked to my car to make the trip back home to Ohio. The drive was just as empty and creepy on the way home as it had been on the way in a week ago. The radio played, and eventually Romeo calmed down and stopped his screaming, thankfully.

Reaching my cul-de-sac, I pulled into my driveway and didn’t see anyone. Before all this, there was always someone outside. There was always a barbecue or a gathering on a lawn, kids playing in the dead-end road. Now it looked like a ghost town, blinds all pulled closed unless necessary.

Mr. Cooper had always been out doing yardwork, laying new mulch and crushed eggshells. He said it helped make the dirt good for growing. Gardening was a hobby his wife had, and when she passed a few years back, he’d picked up where she left off.

*“She loved this yard and garden and doing all this, bringing life up with her hands, and, well, it makes me feel like she’s still here with me, Jenny,”* he once said to me when I asked him why he was so adamant about a hobby he never seemed to care about before.

The Andersons would sit on their porch swing, pressed close as Mrs. Anderson leaned against her husband’s side and drank iced tea, watching their three kids play—chatting with anyone who happened to pass by their place, sometimes keeping you captive for half an hour or more. Now, it was only Mrs. Anderson and her youngest daughter, Elizabeth.

Old Lady Gibbs was always baking something to pass out to the cul-de-sac—cookies, tarts, brownies, fudge, and pies that she set on her windowsill. I remember my first week in the neighborhood she showed up on my doorstep with a strawberry cheesecake and a kind smile. I invited her in, and we talked for hours while eating the cheesecake with coffee as she told me about all the neighbors. Since the first day of the incident, I hadn’t seen her more than a handful of times.

I took Romeo inside and set the box on the floor, crouching down. When I opened it, he burst out in a flurry of feathers and squawking.

“Damn it, Romeo!” I snapped at him as I finally pushed him off, where he landed on the floor, wings beating.

“Bad, bad to pretty bird!” he complained with a whistle at the end as he ruffled his feathers. His claws clicked as he walked away.

“Stupid bird,” I said, standing up and fixing my shirt before going back out to my car to bring in his cage and the rest of what I bought.

It took me a while to put Romeo’s cage back together and get his ramps and perches to actually stay in place. One went from his cage to the bay window so he could look out and watch the cul-de-sac. Mom always said he loved to people-watch. The others went to different high spots: my bookcase, the shelf where I kept some plants, and the entertainment center.

Four days later, my living room was packed with boxes, totes, and garment bags. All my mom’s things—all the things that echoed who she was—were packed away and waiting for a new home. I started with the carefully packed suitcases of her tchotchkes.

I paused on one of her Precious Moments figures. It was of a little angel boy with painted golden hair looking down at baby Jesus in his cradle. She had always told me she found it in a pawn shop when she was pregnant and bought it because just like Jesus was the world’s gift of hope and love, I was her gift.

Looking at the little porcelain angel boy, a tear landed on the painted hay as I finally cried. I cried for my mother, for not being there when she vanished, for not being a better daughter—for not calling her more, not being the gift she always said I was.

My mother was gone, and I was alone.



Stacy had started a support group in the neighborhood for those who were affected by the Rapture. She came over to my house and told me with a wavering smile that she thought it was a good idea to help everyone move on, or at least help people cope. That talking about better times was good for closure — to remember better times and celebrate the memories of those who were gone. She gave me a time and told me I could come over then, that she would have snacks and coffee.



I thought about not going. I didn’t want to sit with a roomful of sobbing neighbors who were still struggling with the same things I was. I told myself that I could get through this all on my own, that I just needed to finish unpacking my mom’s things and put them in their new spaces in my home. I needed to put up the rest of her figures; I still had her Hummels packed away. What good would a group of sad people do for me?

Stacy’s house was just like mine. Our neighborhood was a collection of little cookie-cutter houses with the same floor plans, the same yard sizes, the same colors, the same mailboxes. We all had the same list of HOA-approved yard ornaments and trashcan regulations, and time frames for using the sprinkler systems in the yards.

I hesitated on her front step, then knocked twice and waited. Stacy opened the door and gave me the same sad smile from earlier that morning. She stepped back and let me in.

“We’re in the living room, Jen.” She shuffled past me, and I followed.

I hadn’t known what to expect, but there were more people than I figured. Mr. Cooper sat in an olive green recliner with a mug of coffee in his hands as he spoke to Mrs. Anderson, who perched on the edge of the couch. Old Lady Gibbs sat next to her. Mr. Hernandez stood near the bay window, looking at the floor. I could hear soft footsteps upstairs and assumed it was Elizabeth, Mrs. Anderson's remaining daughter.

Stacy walked past me and softly cleared her throat, wrapping her cardigan tighter around herself. “So… I’m glad you took my offer to… to talk about all of this.”

“What’s to talk about? They’re gone and not coming back,” Mr. Hernandez scoffed as he finally looked up.

“You don’t know that,” Stacy defended weakly.

“Come now, Hernandez. You came, so you might as well just talk about Maria. Remember the good times — don’t dwell on what we can’t change,” Mr. Cooper said, mentioning Mr. Hernandez’s wife.

“Thank you,” Stacy said softly. “I’ll go first. I remember the day Henry was born. Oh, he was so tiny and perfect. His little cry was the most beautiful thing I’d ever heard, and when I saw his little scrunched-up pink face, it was love at first sight.”

Mrs. Anderson started to cry. Mr. Cooper patted her knee comfortingly.

“I remember when I had the twins,” she hiccupped, taking in a shuddering breath. “Elisha and Noah, my boys. So beautiful. Ethan was so happy to have his sons.” She broke off into another wave of tears, pressing her face into her hands.

Stacy walked to her and crouched down, hugging her, crying as well — talking through her own tears as she tried to comfort Mrs. Anderson.

“Our boys were gifts. We… we had them only a little while, so we need to remember every good moment with them.”

Old Lady Gibbs spoke, her own voice wavering like she too was on the verge of tears. “God works in mysterious ways, my dears. One day we’ll all understand.”

“Bullshit. This ain’t no work of God. If it is, then he’s no God of mine,” Mr. Hernandez snapped.

“Mr. Hernandez!” Old Lady Gibbs gasped. “How could you say that? I know it’s hard, but you shouldn’t say things like that. God’s ways are not for us to know, but they are for a reason.”

I didn’t retain much from church besides the general idea of just being a good person. But I do remember some of the Bible stories from Sunday school — a few good ones, like the parting of the Red Sea, Jonah and the whale. I’m sure there are more. There had to be more, but they didn’t stick the way the more vengeful ones lingered in my memories.

Lot’s wife in Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham and his son Isaac. But the one that stuck the most is the story of Job — how he was tormented and had everything taken: his farm, his wife, his children, his friends, his health. All for God to prove a point to Satan.

Maybe Mr. Hernandez was right.

I left. I didn’t interrupt the sobbing women; I just nodded at Mr. Cooper and walked back across the lawn to my house, opening the door to Romeo yelling for dinner. As I fed him, a thought crossed my mind — a brief, horrifying thought.

What if we were the new Lot?





I’d started to notice some weird things. I didn’t pay any mind to it at first, just assumed they were Jehovah’s Witnesses wanting to bring more people into their religion. Then I started to see them everywhere — at the grocery store, the gas station, bookstores, standing on street corners, walking through neighborhoods.

The most unsettling thing about them was how they looked. Every single one of them was beautiful — unnaturally so — just this side of uncanny, almost like they were sculpted, modeled to be the most attractive creatures imaginable.

I’d bumped into one of them as I was leaving the local dollar store. He was tall, six foot, hair so blonde it seemed to glow, soft and wispy like spun gold. Eyes as blue as the clearest skies, smile soft and serene, teeth white and perfectly straight. He wore a starched white dress shirt tucked into perfectly tailored black slacks, and a pair of black dress shoes shined to perfection. A pristine leather Bible rested in his left hand.

“Oh, excuse me. I am terribly sorry to have bumped into you. Are you alright?” His voice was soft, nearly melodical.

“I–I’m fine,” I said, taking a half step back from him.

“That is wonderful,” he said, his smile never faltering.

This man was giving me mixed vibes. He looked harmless, but all his mannerisms screamed danger.

“I need to go now.”

I rushed past him and to my car, slamming the door shut, turning it on, and locking the doors. Breathing heavily, skin tingling, I turned and looked out the passenger window.

He was still standing where I’d left him, staring at me. That soft, serene smile still on his face, head tilted slightly like a curious dog.

I slammed the car into gear and tore out of the parking lot. At the next red light, I gripped the steering wheel with white knuckles.

What was wrong with those people?

Reaching my cul-de-sac, I saw another one — a woman. She had the same spun-gold hair, the same bright, clear blue eyes, the same starched outfit, the same pristine leather Bible. As I drove past her toward my house, she stopped, her head turning to watch me pass, the same smile on her face.

I turned back to the windshield, pressing the gas pedal harder to get home faster. I swung into my driveway, grabbed the bag from the passenger seat, and practically ran into my home.

Romeo greeted me as always, squawking and demanding food. I ignored him as I locked the door, dropped the bag on the couch, and ran to the window. Peeking through the curtain, I searched for the woman.

Gone.

I stood there looking for her longer than I want to admit before shaking my head, feeling like a crazy person for freaking out over random strangers.

After lunch, I went through the rest of the totes, finally finding the deed to Mom’s home in Kentucky. Now I could start the process of selling it. I had all the things that were important to me.

I took the tote full of yarn and knitting supplies I’d found over to Stacy’s and knocked on her door. It opened, and Stacy stood there, her cardigan pulled tight.

“Hey, I’ve got some of my mom’s old knitting stuff. Do you want it?” I asked.

“Oh, yes.”

That’s when I saw the blonde woman from the street walking out of Stacy’s living room. She placed her hand gently on Stacy's shoulder.

“I see that you have some company now. I will be on my way. I thank you greatly for taking the time to listen to me about our church.”

The blonde woman looked at me, still wearing that unsettling smile.

I stepped back as she walked out the door, her steps light as she moved down the sidewalk. I watched her leave the cul-de-sac before turning back to Stacy, who had a genuine smile on her face.

“Well, come on in.”

I followed Stacy inside, setting the tote on the floor by her couch.

“So, who was that woman?” I asked, trying to keep my tone conversational.

“Oh, her name’s Lillian. A recruiter for a new church branch that showed up. She was talking to me about the church and their mission. It seems like a nice place. I told her about my support group — she thought it was a lovely idea,” Stacy said enthusiastically.

I looked at her, equal parts concerned and disturbed. Since Henry had been raptured, Stacy had been a mess — sobbing and broken, a shell of her former bubbly self. Even just yesterday, I’d heard her on her back patio sobbing as she sat in her rocking chair holding a pair of knitting needles.

Now, less than twenty-four hours later, she was acting like everything was right in the world.

“Don’t you think those people are a bit… odd?” I asked.

Her face contorted softly, brow pulling down, lips twisting into a confused frown.

“Odd how?”

What did she mean, how?

“I mean they all look the same.”

Stacy giggled. “Oh, Jen, of course they do. They’re all recruiters for the church, so they wear the same outfit, silly.”

I stared at her incredulously. She knew damn well that’s not what I meant.

“I’m talking about them all looking identical. Beautiful, golden-blond hair, blue eyes. They all have the same perfect look — not their damn clothes!”

I saw the way her face fell. It was the same look you’d give someone who just told you with complete confidence that the earth was flat. The concern in her gaze made my skin prickle as she stepped closer.

“Jen, what are you talking about? Lillian is an older woman with graying brunette hair, and her eyes are brown.”

My hands trembled as I listened to Stacy talk.

“The man who spoke to Mr. Cooper had black hair and a large scar down his right cheek. None of them look the same, Jen.”

Every single one of them I’d seen had looked exactly the same.

Every. Single. One.

Stacy was a lot of things — eccentric, prone to embellishing stories with little bits of flair — but she never outright lied. I’d known her for seven years. I liked to think I knew her well. Hell, I was an emergency contact for her son. I’d kept him while Stacy went on business trips.

So suffice it to say, I had good insight into who she was.

And she was no liar.

“I… I gotta go.”

Stumbling down the hall toward the front door, I pulled it open, ignoring Stacy’s concerned call of my name.

Stepping outside, I was halfway across the lawn separating my home from Stacy’s when I got that skin-tingling feeling of being watched.

Only to see them.

The woman — Lillian — and the man I’d bumped into at the dollar store. Both standing at the edge of the cul-de-sac. Both still sickeningly perfect. Wispy golden hair, clear blue eyes, soft, serene smiles, heads tilted slightly.

The man waved.

I ran.

To preface the situation, several months ago I applied for a manager position in my company. 

After 5 rounds of interviews and 2 case studies, I lost the position to a colleague. This I'm actually fine with, however I was genuinely hurt and bothered by the response of hiring manager. 
The final decision call went like this: 
5 minutes of general chit chat and to then be told and I quote :
""...I have went ahead with a higher caliber candidate."" 
I then thanked them for their time and the call pretty much ended there.

This isn't the 1st role I didn't get over my career, but the delivery of decline genuinely got to me and I found it unprofessional. 
Am in the wrong for feeling that way?

Cut to 3 months later, they just scheduled a coffee chat for my guidance on several procedures related to my role and all those feelings just came back to me. I even contemplated declining the meeting. 

Am I justified or am I being immature? How should I proceed?

I’m still shaken. I want to preface this with this: I know I cannot assume his motive so please don’t get caught on the words ‘force us to crash’. I know the only thing I can really assume is he wanted control to feel safe. 

Child (10) has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder and that often manifests with outbursts, aggression, callous disregard for personal safety and safety of others. He also is ‘gifted’ and has no developmental delays. He has a support team for his mental health- I however do not. 

The 3 of us were in the car. My partner was driving, child was in the backseat of a third row van. He was upset because he didn’t want to go to the store. 

We were driving at speed on the expressway. He began kicking the seat in front of him hard while screaming at us. For the most part we tried to grey rock him while looking for somewhere safe to pull over. He started throwing things at us: his boot, a metal coffee cup, anything he could reach. Items hit the windshield, the driver, me repeatedly. We told him to stop and reminded him how dangerous it was. In an outburst I know he isn’t really thinking clearly. Before I could think he had his seatbelt off and was right behind us, screaming still and grabbing at us. My partner put his arm across the seat to block child. We convinced him to sit again and buckle back up. Then he started the throwing and screaming again and quickly was back up in the front trying to get at us. My partner was swerving here and there despite his best effort to keep us safe. Idk why child decided to finally sit back down but we managed to park. We decided he was chill enough to safely make it to the local ER and took him in for a psych eval and documentation. The ER staff took notes and contacted his psych and child slept thru most of it. 

I don’t know what I’m supposed to do in situations like that. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do after. It’s been a couple of days and I’m just tired and can’t stop thinking about it. I’m planning to order car buckle covers so he can’t unbuckle.

About me: 27, been in my current position for 3 years, mostly do tool/jig design. I work a lot with Solidworks and communicate a lot with both production and manufacturing teams. Liaison Engineering sounds up my alley as I l really like to learn as much as I can about as much as I can. 

Pros and Cons of current job:

Pros: 

\- Great work-life balance: I work 7:30-4:00 M-Th and 7:30-3:00 Friday. I can WFH as needed up to twice a week (though I don’t ever as it is not really conducive to my job). I can pop out of the office for a doctors appointment as needed. Basically, I am treated like an adult. I live down the road and often head home during lunch to let the dogs out. 

\- Culture: Everyone I work with is great. Very nice people who are eager to help with anything. 

\- Nice on site “amenities”: High end furnishings, snacks, fancy coffee (I drink it black, so not a huge bonus for me) etc. 

Cons: 

\- Pay: they have worked with me on this but I am still making \~$20k less than I could in another industry. I know money isn’t everything but Charleston is a very expensive place to live. 

\- The work isn’t very challenging or rewarding, and I don’t think I am learning much anymore. I’ve become pretty bored. I feel I spend a decent amount of my time trying to find projects that are worth doing. 

\-  Upward mobility is limited: No higher level engineering positions without going into management, due to the fact high level engineering isn’t really needed.

Neutral:

\- Benefits: 96 hours of pro with 50% Roth 401(k) matching up to 6%.

Let me get straight to the point. Last Wednesday I was out with a friend when i texted my girlfriend if she wanted to come. She was already out with her friends drinking (while i was having coffee) and she told me she would come. We have a stupid rule in our country that if you do not have your drivers license for less than 2 years you are not able to drive past 11pm and it is already 10:55pm ( I have my drivers license for +2 years) so my friend had to leave. Then my girlfriend came to the cafe i was at and had a beer there. That's where it all started.  
She let out a sigh, not a normal sigh for her. I asked what's wrong and she said that a friend (old friend) she was talking to about having coffee together (which I'm usually okay with) asked her if she wanted to have a night drive (keep in mind he does not have 2 years plus). And I was like okay, you can go with him but make sure you text me when you get home.   
Fast forward 2 hours I was having drinks with my father and I text her back and she replies at 2 o'clock which is unusual for her as she goes to sleep at 11:30pm to 12:00am.  
I asked her where she was and she told me that police stopped her 2 times and that she got stuck. Keep in mind that she went to a place which is like 20 minutes away from the city we live in.   
Fast forward to a party at a certain bar at which we are both at. This happened last Saturday. I was with a couple of friends drinking, and she was doing the same. While she was out, another friend calls and tells me were he was (he was at a house party). So I thought to myself this would be the good afterparty on which we both went with a couple of friends. While we were there we were both having fun until she disappeared. I texted her where she was and she told me that she was outside and i checked on her and she really was. She was talking on the phone which she identified as her ""friend"" but I don't think it was. I went back to the party and I was texting her and she told me that she was leaving. I texted her ""Wait I'm coming"" to which she did not reply and i was assuming she would come back. I went out a couple of minutes later to the bathroom and to check up on her and I could not find her. Turns out she got bored and she could not stand some of the people that were there and that she called her father to come to pick her up. 

I let it go, and when I asked her about it she brushed it off telling me that she called her father, but it was really brief. I keep feeling like she is cheating on me after almost 2 years together and I can not wrap my head around it. 

Sorry for the long monologue, would love some tips, past experiences and ""situationships"" that felt like this, even though this is not a siguationship anymore. 

Please let me know what I should do. I tried talking to her but it feels like I am talking to the wall all alone with all the short answers.",1,1771460155.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

1r8k2js,https://i.redd.it/uv3r09y3gckg1.jpeg,Bali activities: why always book through my driver (and pay less than online),"Hey everyone,
Just wanted to share something I wish I knew before my first trip to Bali: if you’re doing popular activities (ATV, rafting, Nusa Penida, waterfalls, temples, swings, etc.), you can usually get a better price by booking through your private driver instead of big tour platforms.

On my last trips I did most of these through drivers and noticed a pattern:

Online platforms and hotel desks often add a big markup.

Drivers usually have direct contacts with local operators and can get “local” or “agent” rates.

You still get a legit ticket/booking, but the driver gets a small commission instead of a big company.

How it works in practice
This is what I’ve been doing:

Book a full-day driver first

Arrange via WhatsApp or Instagram before you arrive, agree on a day rate (car, petrol, parking included).

Tell them which area you’re staying (Ubud, Canggu, Seminyak, Uluwatu, etc.).

Send your wish list of activities

Example: “ATV + rafting + rice terrace + swing in Ubud” or “Nusa Penida West, snorkeling, and a photo-stop route.”

Ask: “Can you check your price for these if we book through you vs online?”

Ask for “all‑in” prices

Make sure it includes: entrance tickets, activity, guide/gear, local taxes, and hotel pickup/return.

If you already have the driver for the day, clarify what’s included in the day rate vs the activity price.

Compare with online prices

Check GetYourGuide/Viator/other sites for the same tour.

It’s very common that the total via driver is noticeably cheaper, especially if you’re 2–4 people.

Pay on the day, in cash

Most drivers don’t ask for prepayment.

You pay the driver after the tour; they settle directly with the activity operator.

If you’re doing multiple days with the same driver, you can settle at the end of each day.

Why it’s cheaper
Drivers act like small local agents and get a net rate from ATV/rafting/water sports companies.

Big platforms add their own margin + credit card fees + marketing costs.

By booking through your driver, you’re basically cutting out one middle layer while still supporting a local.

Tips to avoid issues
Use drivers with good reviews or recommendations from friends/FB groups.

Ask for clear inclusions: “Is lunch included? Is there travel insurance? Any extra fees at the location?”

Avoid super “too good to be true” prices for things like Nusa Penida – some of those cut corners on safety or overcrowd the itinerary.

If you care about timing/photos, tell the driver: “I want sunrise/less crowd at X” so they can plan the route.

Example of a day I booked this way
Private driver day rate

Ubud ATV ride

White water rafting

Rice terraces + swing stop

Coffee plantation visit

I priced the exact same combo on a big platform and it was significantly more per person. Booking through the driver came out cheaper per person, and more flexible (we could leave earlier, skip places we didn’t care about, stop for food where we wanted).

If you’ve done something similar in Bali, drop your experience or tips below. And if you’re going soon: honestly, don’t be shy to just WhatsApp your driver and ask for their activity prices before you lock anything in online.",1,1771460014.0,BaliTravelTips,0,1.0,False

**(CW- Suicide)**



The rapture happened today.

That’s what everyone is calling it, at least.

It wasn’t like in stories where the clouds part and angelic horns sound, and those who earned their place lift into the sky, surrounded by golden light. There was no pomp and circumstance, no signs; no angels came from the heavens to pick the righteous. The Lord didn’t look upon the earth, ethereal and beyond human comprehension. Gabriel didn’t descend and beckon the chosen to paradise.

No.

They were just… gone.

People woke that morning to family members gone from their beds. Reports from journalists later said that the beds looked freshly made, as if they’d never even been slept in. Children, husbands, wives, parents — all gone in the night.

At first, no one knew how widespread it was; most people in my neighborhood speculated a mass kidnapping in the cul-de-sac. Some shady underground human trafficking group had targeted our small, quiet community, swooping in during the dead of night to take entire families.

Police were called, lines were busy, people on hold. That’s when it started to become clear that this wasn’t just in our neighborhood. Throughout the day, the news reported that the mass disappearances had happened all over the world — America, the UK, Poland, Asia, Africa — everywhere, people were missing.

Churches, synagogues, mosques — religious buildings filled with people wanting answers, wanting community.

I had woken up that morning none the wiser. I live alone, so I didn’t know about the issue until I heard my neighbor Stacy yelling for her son Henry. He was a rambunctious kid, always leaving the house as soon as he woke up, never telling his mom. So this was a normal occurrence. What wasn’t normal was the multitude of voices that joined Stacy’s.

Curiosity pulled me outside only to see neighbors out in their robes and pajamas, with panic-stricken faces. As they yelled for their children or their significant other, a few kids even came out in cartoon-printed pajamas calling for their parents.

I stood and watched the panic and confusion for a moment before Stacy saw me, rushing over, clutching her robe closed, her house slippers scuffing against the concrete as she approached.

“Jen, have you seen Henry? He always comes when I yell for him,” she asked, her voice laced with barely held-together panic.

“No, I just woke up.”

“Your house cameras — can you check them? Please, Jen,” she asked, voice cracking.

“Yeah, of course,” I told her, pulling up the camera feed on my phone.

Stacy moved closer, pressing tight to my side to get a better view of my phone screen. I rolled the time back to last night and let it play, occasionally fast-forwarding. Stacy watched, her hand tightening on her robe as the video played and showed a normal night. A possum passed by looking for an unsecured trash can, but nothing sinister. Henry never appeared — no creepy vans or people. In fact, no one appeared in the video feed, which was odd because to get out of the cul-de-sac, you have to pass by my house, as it's one of the last houses leading out of the area.

The video played until it reached Stacy stepping out onto her front lawn.

“I don’t… I don’t understand. I need to call the police.” She pulled her phone from her pocket with shaky hands and dialed.

As Stacy called the police, I watched as the rest of the neighbors outside did the same.

“What the hell do you mean you're putting me on hold? You’re emergency dispatch — you can’t do holds!” one of the neighbors, Mr. Hernandez, yelled into his phone. “My wife is missing, her car’s still in our driveway, half my neighborhood is gone!”

Stacy started to panic, gripping her phone to her ear with both hands. “No, no, don't put me on hold! My baby is missing. I need someone to find him, please! He’s only seven, he can’t… hello?” She made a sharp hiccuping sound as she looked at me, wide-eyed and teary. “They put me on hold — they can—what's happening?”

That was the question everyone had, and no one had the answers.

I went to my contacts and found my mom’s number. My hands shook. My heart soared as the line clicked, overjoyed I was about to hear my mom’s soft voice — only for my stomach to bottom out at her voicemail.

“Hello, this is Cheryl. Sorry I missed your call. Leave a message and I’ll call you back.”

A sharp beep followed, and I left a short message.

“Mom, call me back. Something weird is going on. Please, please call me back. Okay? I love you.”

That was all this morning.

Now I’m sitting in my living room watching the news as reports continue to come in — about cars crashed or just sitting vacant on the sides of highways and city streets, completely empty with no signs of struggle. Planes fell from the sky as the pilots vanished, killing the passengers on board. Reports tried to calculate how widespread it was, and it was horrifying, to say the least. By noon, reports were in the millions. By four, billions.

My mom hasn’t called.

I decided I’m making the drive to Kentucky to see for certain if she’s been raptured — or whatever this is supposed to be. Hopefully she just lost her phone charger again, and I'm worried for nothing.



I made the trip to my mom’s house much faster than expected. Normally the drive would take me a little over six hours; I made it in four and a half. The lack of traffic on the interstate was eerie, to say the least — driving miles before seeing another car.

The most unsettling part of the drive was seeing all the abandoned vehicles on the side of the interstate. I had to drive around some that had stopped in the middle of the road, drifting to sit diagonally in one of the lanes. Some of the squeezes were too tight, and I had to use the shoulder or drive through the grass median. During one of the times I had to ease between a black Mercedes and an old, rusted Ford F-150, I looked into the passenger-side back seat and saw an empty car seat, the question lingering of whether the kid had also disappeared or if they were alone now.

The entire drive I bounced between listening to the radio and reports from witnesses — live interviews with people who had someone raptured. The interviews were the worst to listen to: people sobbing into the microphone, begging for their loved ones to just come back home, begging whoever took them to bring them back. Still not believing that this was something beyond human possibility, that this was divine — whether holy or hellish was still to be determined.

When the interviews became too much, I listened to music.

I also spent the whole drive calling my mom’s phone and listening to it ring through my car speakers, only for it to direct to her voicemail. My mind drifted between the horrifying idea that she was gone and the much more optimistic one that my old, technologically impaired mother had just lost her phone, or had once again set it to silent. It was the only thing that kept me sane on the drive to her small town.

My mom’s old Buick sat in her driveway. I pulled my sedan right in behind it, cutting the engine as I looked at the house, hope fluttering in my chest. The curtains were all drawn and the front door was closed — something my mom never did. Even when it was chilly out, she would have it open. She always said the storm door kept out enough of the cold. She liked to stand at the front door and watch the birds and squirrels eat from the feeders she had out front.

I walked up to the front door past the flower beds and up the cobblestone walk. The porch creaked under my feet as I opened the storm door. I grabbed the doorknob and turned — locked. Taking a steadying breath, I opened it with my spare, then stepped inside.

The sweet artificial smell of the sugar cookie candles my mom loved greeted me as I stepped inside, along with the glass cabinet full of her favorite tchotchkes that she always swore would be worth something one day.

“Mom?” I called out.

Only to flinch when a loud squawk was my reply, followed by a sharp chirping whistle.

“Feed pretty bird, feed the pretty bird!”

The rattling of a cage followed.

I walked into the living room only to see my mom’s macaw standing on one of his perches, shaking his cage with one foot, wings battering the bars and kicking up the plucked feathers at the bottom.

“Pretty bird, food. Food for the pretty bird!” he shrieked, even louder when he saw me.

I walked over and opened the door on the side before he came clambering out, flapping and making a racket as he climbed to the top of his cage. Pouring some seed into his bowl as he chattered nonsense while he waited, I called out again.

“Mom!”

There was no way she didn’t hear Romeo screaming his head off.

I made my way through the bottom level, then headed upstairs, looking through every room — because maybe she fell? I tried to keep my hands from shaking as I found the top floor empty too. I headed back downstairs, pulling my phone from my pocket to call her again.

Her ringtone sounded from somewhere in the kitchen.

I found it next to the pink glass vase of grocery store roses she liked to buy for herself. Picking it up, I hit the decline button and shoved mine back in my pocket before opening the screen on hers — only to be met with all twenty-two of my missed calls and the four voicemails.

I walked dazed back into the living room where Romeo was now happily preening his feathers, making soft sounds. I dropped into my mom’s well-worn recliner, the fabric on the arm practically threadbare, the yellow foam peeking through in spots. The middle sank low from decades of use, the granny-square afghan she covered up with to watch TV draped over the back.

I’ve been here five hours, curled up in her chair covered in her vibrant handmade granny-square afghan, her phone sitting next to my own on the side table. The TV plays just for background noise as Romeo trills and ruffles his feathers while pacing the ramps and perches my mom had made specifically for him. She said he was a bird and was used to being up high, so it was cruel to have him walk on the floor — and it was hard for her to bend down and pick him up anyway.

I woke up with my neck sore from falling asleep in her chair. I checked the time and saw that it was seven in the morning. I had slept the whole night in the chair. I walked the house again, calling out for my mom, only to be met with the same silence as yesterday.

She hadn’t come back home last night.

My mother has been raptured.



The past month has been a lot. I spent a week at my mother’s home carefully packing away her things into designated piles—things to keep, to throw out, to donate. I wrapped all her Precious Moments, Hummels, and Lladró figures in old newspapers she kept to use as firestarters in the hearth, carefully tucking them away in a suitcase I’d found in the hall closet. Photo albums, books full of delicately pressed flowers she’d cut from her garden, crystals and geodes she’d gotten from a kitschy little magic shop she adored—all went into plastic totes from her garage, tagged with sticky notes and magic marker, set aside to be taken home with me.

Getting Romeo home was harder than I thought. All of his perches and ramps were a pain to take down, and he screeched at me the whole time. His cage wouldn’t fit into my sedan standing up and had to be broken down, so I had to wrestle the now-angry bird into a cardboard box with a fuzzy throw at the bottom. He yelled, and his wings battered the sides of the box as I put him in the front seat of my car, along with the other priceless things I could fit—the albums, the flower pressings, and all her favorite little bric-a-brac. The rest I would have shipped once I found a shipping company that still had enough employees to even do the job.

After locking up the house, I walked to my car to make the trip back home to Ohio. The drive was just as empty and creepy on the way home as it had been on the way in a week ago. The radio played, and eventually Romeo calmed down and stopped his screaming, thankfully.

Reaching my cul-de-sac, I pulled into my driveway and didn’t see anyone. Before all this, there was always someone outside. There was always a barbecue or a gathering on a lawn, kids playing in the dead-end road. Now it looked like a ghost town, blinds all pulled closed unless necessary.

Mr. Cooper had always been out doing yardwork, laying new mulch and crushed eggshells. He said it helped make the dirt good for growing. Gardening was a hobby his wife had, and when she passed a few years back, he’d picked up where she left off.

*“She loved this yard and garden and doing all this, bringing life up with her hands, and, well, it makes me feel like she’s still here with me, Jenny,”* he once said to me when I asked him why he was so adamant about a hobby he never seemed to care about before.

The Andersons would sit on their porch swing, pressed close as Mrs. Anderson leaned against her husband’s side and drank iced tea, watching their three kids play—chatting with anyone who happened to pass by their place, sometimes keeping you captive for half an hour or more. Now, it was only Mrs. Anderson and her youngest daughter, Elizabeth.

Old Lady Gibbs was always baking something to pass out to the cul-de-sac—cookies, tarts, brownies, fudge, and pies that she set on her windowsill. I remember my first week in the neighborhood she showed up on my doorstep with a strawberry cheesecake and a kind smile. I invited her in, and we talked for hours while eating the cheesecake with coffee as she told me about all the neighbors. Since the first day of the incident, I hadn’t seen her more than a handful of times.

I took Romeo inside and set the box on the floor, crouching down. When I opened it, he burst out in a flurry of feathers and squawking.

“Damn it, Romeo!” I snapped at him as I finally pushed him off, where he landed on the floor, wings beating.

“Bad, bad to pretty bird!” he complained with a whistle at the end as he ruffled his feathers. His claws clicked as he walked away.

“Stupid bird,” I said, standing up and fixing my shirt before going back out to my car to bring in his cage and the rest of what I bought.

It took me a while to put Romeo’s cage back together and get his ramps and perches to actually stay in place. One went from his cage to the bay window so he could look out and watch the cul-de-sac. Mom always said he loved to people-watch. The others went to different high spots: my bookcase, the shelf where I kept some plants, and the entertainment center.

Four days later, my living room was packed with boxes, totes, and garment bags. All my mom’s things—all the things that echoed who she was—were packed away and waiting for a new home. I started with the carefully packed suitcases of her tchotchkes.

I paused on one of her Precious Moments figures. It was of a little angel boy with painted golden hair looking down at baby Jesus in his cradle. She had always told me she found it in a pawn shop when she was pregnant and bought it because just like Jesus was the world’s gift of hope and love, I was her gift.

Looking at the little porcelain angel boy, a tear landed on the painted hay as I finally cried. I cried for my mother, for not being there when she vanished, for not being a better daughter—for not calling her more, not being the gift she always said I was.

My mother was gone, and I was alone.



Stacy had started a support group in the neighborhood for those who were affected by the Rapture. She came over to my house and told me with a wavering smile that she thought it was a good idea to help everyone move on, or at least help people cope. That talking about better times was good for closure — to remember better times and celebrate the memories of those who were gone. She gave me a time and told me I could come over then, that she would have snacks and coffee.

I thought about not going. I didn’t want to sit with a roomful of sobbing neighbors who were still struggling with the same things I was. I told myself that I could get through this all on my own, that I just needed to finish unpacking my mom’s things and put them in their new spaces in my home. I needed to put up the rest of her figures; I still had her Hummels packed away. What good would a group of sad people do for me?

Stacy’s house was just like mine. Our neighborhood was a collection of little cookie-cutter houses with the same floor plans, the same yard sizes, the same colors, the same mailboxes. We all had the same list of HOA-approved yard ornaments and trashcan regulations, and time frames for using the sprinkler systems in the yards.

I hesitated on her front step, then knocked twice and waited. Stacy opened the door and gave me the same sad smile from earlier that morning. She stepped back and let me in.

“We’re in the living room, Jen.” She shuffled past me, and I followed.

I hadn’t known what to expect, but there were more people than I figured. Mr. Cooper sat in an olive green recliner with a mug of coffee in his hands as he spoke to Mrs. Anderson, who perched on the edge of the couch. Old Lady Gibbs sat next to her. Mr. Hernandez stood near the bay window, looking at the floor. I could hear soft footsteps upstairs and assumed it was Elizabeth, Mrs. Anderson's remaining daughter.

Stacy walked past me and softly cleared her throat, wrapping her cardigan tighter around herself. “So… I’m glad you took my offer to… to talk about all of this.”

“What’s to talk about? They’re gone and not coming back,” Mr. Hernandez scoffed as he finally looked up.

“You don’t know that,” Stacy defended weakly.

“Come now, Hernandez. You came, so you might as well just talk about Maria. Remember the good times — don’t dwell on what we can’t change,” Mr. Cooper said, mentioning Mr. Hernandez’s wife.

“Thank you,” Stacy said softly. “I’ll go first. I remember the day Henry was born. Oh, he was so tiny and perfect. His little cry was the most beautiful thing I’d ever heard, and when I saw his little scrunched-up pink face, it was love at first sight.”

Mrs. Anderson started to cry. Mr. Cooper patted her knee comfortingly.

“I remember when I had the twins,” she hiccupped, taking in a shuddering breath. “Elisha and Noah, my boys. So beautiful. Ethan was so happy to have his sons.” She broke off into another wave of tears, pressing her face into her hands.

Stacy walked to her and crouched down, hugging her, crying as well — talking through her own tears as she tried to comfort Mrs. Anderson.

“Our boys were gifts. We… we had them only a little while, so we need to remember every good moment with them.”

Old Lady Gibbs spoke, her own voice wavering like she too was on the verge of tears. “God works in mysterious ways, my dears. One day we’ll all understand.”

“Bullshit. This ain’t no work of God. If it is, then he’s no God of mine,” Mr. Hernandez snapped.

“Mr. Hernandez!” Old Lady Gibbs gasped. “How could you say that? I know it’s hard, but you shouldn’t say things like that. God’s ways are not for us to know, but they are for a reason.”

I didn’t retain much from church besides the general idea of just being a good person. But I do remember some of the Bible stories from Sunday school — a few good ones, like the parting of the Red Sea, Jonah and the whale. I’m sure there are more. There had to be more, but they didn’t stick the way the more vengeful ones lingered in my memories.

Lot’s wife in Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham and his son Isaac. But the one that stuck the most is the story of Job — how he was tormented and had everything taken: his farm, his wife, his children, his friends, his health. All for God to prove a point to Satan.

Maybe Mr. Hernandez was right.

I left. I didn’t interrupt the sobbing women; I just nodded at Mr. Cooper and walked back across the lawn to my house, opening the door to Romeo yelling for dinner. As I fed him, a thought crossed my mind — a brief, horrifying thought.

What if we were the new Lot?



I’d started to notice some weird things. I didn’t pay any mind to it at first, just assumed they were Jehovah’s Witnesses wanting to bring more people into their religion. Then I started to see them everywhere — at the grocery store, the gas station, bookstores, standing on street corners, walking through neighborhoods.

The most unsettling thing about them was how they looked. Every single one of them was beautiful — unnaturally so — just this side of uncanny, almost like they were sculpted, modeled to be the most attractive creatures imaginable.

I’d bumped into one of them as I was leaving the local dollar store. He was tall, six foot, hair so blonde it seemed to glow, soft and wispy like spun gold. Eyes as blue as the clearest skies, smile soft and serene, teeth white and perfectly straight. He wore a starched white dress shirt tucked into perfectly tailored black slacks, and a pair of black dress shoes shined to perfection. A pristine leather Bible rested in his left hand.

“Oh, excuse me. I am terribly sorry to have bumped into you. Are you alright?” His voice was soft, nearly melodical.

“I–I’m fine,” I said, taking a half step back from him.

“That is wonderful,” he said, his smile never faltering.

This man was giving me mixed vibes. He looked harmless, but all his mannerisms screamed danger.

“I need to go now.”

I rushed past him and to my car, slamming the door shut, turning it on, and locking the doors. Breathing heavily, skin tingling, I turned and looked out the passenger window.

He was still standing where I’d left him, staring at me. That soft, serene smile still on his face, head tilted slightly like a curious dog.

I slammed the car into gear and tore out of the parking lot. At the next red light, I gripped the steering wheel with white knuckles.

What was wrong with those people?

Reaching my cul-de-sac, I saw another one — a woman. She had the same spun-gold hair, the same bright, clear blue eyes, the same starched outfit, the same pristine leather Bible. As I drove past her toward my house, she stopped, her head turning to watch me pass, the same smile on her face.

I turned back to the windshield, pressing the gas pedal harder to get home faster. I swung into my driveway, grabbed the bag from the passenger seat, and practically ran into my home.

Romeo greeted me as always, squawking and demanding food. I ignored him as I locked the door, dropped the bag on the couch, and ran to the window. Peeking through the curtain, I searched for the woman.

Gone.

I stood there looking for her longer than I want to admit before shaking my head, feeling like a crazy person for freaking out over random strangers.

After lunch, I went through the rest of the totes, finally finding the deed to Mom’s home in Kentucky. Now I could start the process of selling it. I had all the things that were important to me.

I took the tote full of yarn and knitting supplies I’d found over to Stacy’s and knocked on her door. It opened, and Stacy stood there, her cardigan pulled tight.

“Hey, I’ve got some of my mom’s old knitting stuff. Do you want it?” I asked.

“Oh, yes.”

That’s when I saw the blonde woman from the street walking out of Stacy’s living room. She placed her hand gently on Stacy's shoulder.

“I see that you have some company now. I will be on my way. I thank you greatly for taking the time to listen to me about our church.”

The blonde woman looked at me, still wearing that unsettling smile.

I stepped back as she walked out the door, her steps light as she moved down the sidewalk. I watched her leave the cul-de-sac before turning back to Stacy, who had a genuine smile on her face.

“Well, come on in.”

I followed Stacy inside, setting the tote on the floor by her couch.

“So, who was that woman?” I asked, trying to keep my tone conversational.

“Oh, her name’s Lillian. A recruiter for a new church branch that showed up. She was talking to me about the church and their mission. It seems like a nice place. I told her about my support group — she thought it was a lovely idea,” Stacy said enthusiastically.

I looked at her, equal parts concerned and disturbed. Since Henry had been raptured, Stacy had been a mess — sobbing and broken, a shell of her former bubbly self. Even just yesterday, I’d heard her on her back patio sobbing as she sat in her rocking chair holding a pair of knitting needles.

Now, less than twenty-four hours later, she was acting like everything was right in the world.

“Don’t you think those people are a bit… odd?” I asked.

Her face contorted softly, brow pulling down, lips twisting into a confused frown.

“Odd how?”

What did she mean, how?

“I mean they all look the same.”

Stacy giggled. “Oh, Jen, of course they do. They’re all recruiters for the church, so they wear the same outfit, silly.”

I stared at her incredulously. She knew damn well that’s not what I meant.

“I’m talking about them all looking identical. Beautiful, golden-blond hair, blue eyes. They all have the same perfect look — not their damn clothes!”

I saw the way her face fell. It was the same look you’d give someone who just told you with complete confidence that the earth was flat. The concern in her gaze made my skin prickle as she stepped closer.

“Jen, what are you talking about? Lillian is an older woman with graying brunette hair, and her eyes are brown.”

My hands trembled as I listened to Stacy talk.

“The man who spoke to Mr. Cooper had black hair and a large scar down his right cheek. None of them look the same, Jen.”

Every single one of them I’d seen had looked exactly the same.

Every. Single. One.

Stacy was a lot of things — eccentric, prone to embellishing stories with little bits of flair — but she never outright lied. I’d known her for seven years. I liked to think I knew her well. Hell, I was an emergency contact for her son. I’d kept him while Stacy went on business trips.

So suffice it to say, I had good insight into who she was.

And she was no liar.

“I… I gotta go.”

Stumbling down the hall toward the front door, I pulled it open, ignoring Stacy’s concerned call of my name.

Stepping outside, I was halfway across the lawn separating my home from Stacy’s when I got that skin-tingling feeling of being watched.

Only to see them.

The woman — Lillian — and the man I’d bumped into at the dollar store. Both standing at the edge of the cul-de-sac. Both still sickeningly perfect. Wispy golden hair, clear blue eyes, soft, serene smiles, heads tilted slightly.

The man waved.

I ran.

Random side effect of simplifying my carry. I started doing a monthly Rent the Runway sub for weekday clothes so I always have a couple nicer pieces in rotation for client days.

Today, I went to our local coffee shop because I found out that one of my girlfriends was working there.

I have to admit that my son distracted her a little bit because he's so cute and talkative that she steamed the milk a bit too much, so she put it in the cooler behind her to cool down, which was fine. My son and I had absolutely no place to go today, so we shared a little croissant. This is where the story turns - a guy from high school came into the shop. This guy was one of those guys who thought he was God's gift to women but doesn't know how to treat them right, and even in high school, I turned him down.

Do the kids have early dismissal? When is that science fair thing due? Did I respond to the birthday party invite? Is it my turn to bring snack to soccer? Did I move the laundry to the dryer or is it still sitting in the washer getting gross?

And I KNOW I read that email from school, I saw it come through while I was on a call with a client and thought ""I'll deal with that later"" and then later never came because the second I closed my laptop my 11yo needed help with math and then the 8yo wanted me to watch her cartwheel for the 400th time and then it was bath time and then bedtime and then I'm on the couch barely awake trying to remember what I forgot. I'm not gonna pretend I fixed everything because lol no, but I’m trying some new stuff

I started doing a brain dump on Sunday mornings instead of letting it build up until night, 10 minutes with my coffee writing down every single thing rattling around in my head about the week. Getting it OUT of my brain and onto paper before the anxiety spiral starts has been huge, I keep the paper on the fridge and my husband can actually see it which means he occasionally does something on it without me asking?? revolutionary

I got a cheap whiteboard for the kitchen and we write the weekly schedule on it every Sunday so everyone can physically see what's happening each day. Sounds basic but it eliminated like half the ""wait what time is pickup today"" questions from my husband. I also stopped manually tracking every school event because that was eating my time, I put the school stuff in ohai and it syncs the school calendar automatically so early dismissals and half days just show up without me entering them. And I started using google keep for random voice memos when I remember something during the day instead of trying to hold it, I just talk into my phone like a crazy person in the grocery store and deal with it later

And therapy, (these are actually my therapists tips, but I’m claiming them) learning to let stuff drop without the guilt spiral. My kids will survive if I forget crazy hair day, they will not remember in 20 years that mom missed pajama day. Probably.

Still a work in progress but Sundays don't make me nauseous, so I'm calling it a win",23,1771459159.0,workingmoms,8,0.96,False

I used to use a Gaggia baby (which I was very happy with), and have some experience with manual machines. Could someone with more knowledge than I give me your own evaluation of which maker would be the best?

For context, it is for my daily use home maker. I don't have busy mornings, so I can afford to take some time with the brews. I like a bit of novelty (the Peppina and Pavoni are very attractive to me sheerly from a fun perpective), but I really like a certain degree of reliable comfort as well (the Gaggia I would be happy to go back to.) I am not sure about the Rok, but given what I saw of Hoffman's review of the model I am looking at and the price point, I am considering it.

The espresso makers are:

La Peppina = 150 euros (a bit of a unique one : [https://youtu.be/H\_CEIJz1orA?si=qJNbPUOPMhUW34gF](https://youtu.be/H_CEIJz1orA?si=qJNbPUOPMhUW34gF) ...I'm not sure if the lever would make control harder over the shots to the point it is unreliable, though)

La Pavoni = 170 euros (1980s, very good condition)

Gaggia Baby = 120 euros

Rok = 70 euros

Lelit PL041EM + this coffee grinder = 100 euros (best deal in terms of what I get, but I am more interested in the quality of espresso maker)

1r8jmfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/1r8jmfv/655_gmat_after_15_weeks_of_prep_time/,655 GMAT after 1.5 weeks of prep time.,"Figured I would make a post and share my own experience since the posts in this subreddit have helped me in turn.

As the title says, I scheduled my GMAT exam with only 1 and a half weeks of prep time. Without going into much detail, it was due to some personal reasons of mine. I wish I had more time to prepare myself.

But anyway, my strategy was the following:

1. First, I took a cold mock test. It was the free practice test 1 that came with the exam registration. I went in without knowing anything at all. I literally did not even know the exam format, nor the structure of the questions. Got a 625, with V85, DI79 and Q79. Was happy with the V score, but obviously DI and Q were bringing down my overall composite score significantly.

2. For the remainder of the week, I purchased the official practice questions bank and just went straight into the ""hard"" questions. No guide, no lecture videos, nothing. I just straight-up cranked all the hard questions and as many of the easy and medium questions. I studied about 4-5 hours every weekday and 6-7 hours on weekends. I ended up completing about \~65% of the entire question bank.

3. The day before the exam, I take the second practice test that was available for free. I got a 645 with V86, DI82, and Q79. At this point, both V and DI are in good shape, but obviously, Q was still not good enough and was bringing the composite score down. Instead of continuing to practice more questions, I just watched an entire YouTube playlist on the Quant section (I think it was the GMAT Ninja channel).

4. The day of the exam, I did nothing. I relaxed during the morning, played some video games (I wake up around 6 am, so I usually have some time for myself in the morning before going out). I then headed to the exam centre while chugging coffee along the way. Actual exam was about the same as the practice tests in terms of difficulty. Final score was 655 with V85, DI82, and Q81.

So final tally of the 1.5 weeks of prep time:

Verbal: no improvement, V85 94th percentile

Data: went from 79--->82, (75th--->93rd percentile)

Quant: went from 79--->81 (57th--->70th percentile)

Total Score: 625 ---> 655

Overall, satisfied. I just needed a good enough score around the average of some of the schools I plan to apply to. I have strong work experience and extracurriculars, so I just needed a score that did not look absolutely terrible with the rest of my application materials. Hope this post helps someone in this sub.

1r8ji5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rimmont/comments/1r8ji5g/every_night_at_1235_am_the_bouncing_starts/,"Every night at 12:35 AM, the bouncing starts","I've already asked everyone I know who might have an explanation for this, and I still don’t know how to deal with it. If you have any ideas, I’m open to suggestions.

It all started almost a month ago. I was finishing up some work, shut down my computer, and got ready for bed. Brushed my teeth, put on my pajamas, and turned on a nature documentary at low volume. I set the sleep timer and tried to fall asleep. A few minutes later, the TV turned off, but I still couldn’t sleep. Must’ve been the coffee I had earlier to finish my work.

I started thinking about what I’d done, what I might’ve forgotten. I realized I still hadn’t paid the internet bill and the due date was coming up. I was about to grab my phone to watch some funny videos when I heard a strangely familiar noise: a boom.

Probably the neighbors, I thought. Or an animal outside—a cat, maybe. But then it happened again. Boom. Nothing crazy, just the sound of something hitting the floor. This time it was clearer: it was coming from inside the house.

I looked around for a weapon. The closest thing I had was my camera tripod. I grabbed it as aggressively as I could and headed to the living room. Another boom. I walked slowly, holding my breath, tensing my arms. I might have to hit someone.

When I got to the living room, I saw the source of the noise: a rubber ball. No bigger than an apple. It bounced off the floor again. Boom. I carefully set the tripod down by the couch and went to the kitchen. I needed water. I turned on the faucet, filled a glass. Another boom.

I walked back and just stood there, watching the ball, one hand on my hip, drinking water. It kept bouncing. Boom. It would rise almost to shoulder height and fall again. Boom. A chill ran through me. I caught it mid-air and set it on the dining table on my way back to the bedroom.

Finished my water, got back in bed. Didn’t hear it again that night. Figured it was just a weird episode.

The next morning, I looked for the ball, wanted to see if it was something special. Couldn’t find it. Went to work, life went on. That night, I tried to sleep early—actually managed to doze off—until it woke me up. Boom.

Same sound. Just a bounce. I stared at the ceiling. Boom. I didn’t want to get up. Couldn’t be bothered. Boom. Shit. Got up, went to the living room, grabbed the ball, and threw it out the window. Went back to bed and fell asleep.

Next day was normal. I told Fred about it. He gave me this weird look, like I was joking. I dropped it. Maybe it was just a bad dream. Went home, tried to sleep, and while I was asleep: boom. I checked the time. 12:35 AM. Got pissed. What kind of sick prank is this?

""I don’t care who you are, this isn’t funny.""

Grabbed the ball, took it to my room, and put it in the nightstand. Next morning, it was gone.

The following night, I invited Fred and his wife Lina over. Poker, drinks. We were in the dining room playing when, right at 12:35, boom. I didn’t say anything. Wanted to see his reaction.

Fred looked at me, confused.

""What’s that sound?""

""It’s the ball. The thing I told you about.""

He gave me this look—almost pity. Then another boom. His expression shifted to mild annoyance. We all went to the living room. There it was. The ball, bouncing almost shoulder-high.

""This isn’t funny, man. You’re going too far.""

He grabbed Lina’s hand and they left without another word. The ball bounced again. Boom.

I grabbed it and threw it out the window as hard as I could. Cleaned up the table and went to bed. At least now I knew I wasn’t hallucinating.

The nights kept going like that. Every single night, exactly at 12:35, the bounce. Boom. I bought earplugs. Didn’t matter. The sound cut right through them. Boom. Boom. Boom.

I tried getting rid of it. Threw it in the trash. Threw it in the river. Gave it away. It always came back. Thought maybe it was the house. Called a priest. He did an exorcism, told me to pray. I did. Thought it would work. That night, right at 12:35, the goddamn ball was back. Boom.

Got a hotel room. Maybe it was the house. Everything was fine—until 12:35. Boom. The ball, bouncing in the hallway.

Went to a witch. She said it was a curse. Charged me a month’s salary to lift it. I paid. Thought it was over. That night, 12:35. Boom.

I snapped. Grabbed the ball, took it to the kitchen, picked up the sharpest knife I had, and cut it to pieces. Wanted to see if there was something inside. There was nothing. I threw the pieces into the fireplace and lit it. Watched it burn. Caught a faint smell of iron. Doused the fire, scooped up the ashes, and tossed them.

Went to sleep.

Next day, my boss fired me. Said I’d been missing too much work. Terrible day. That night, I couldn’t sleep. And at 12:35, the ball bounced again. Boom.

Went to Fred the next day. Tried to explain, tried to stay calm, tried to make him understand.

""I know it sounds crazy. Please, believe me.""

He invited me over. Tried to make it nice, told old stories from when we were kids. We were laughing, having drinks, when at 12:35, the ball bounced in the next room. This time, Fred’s face went pale. Real horror. I started walking toward it. He stopped me. Just stood there, watching it bounce.

""This is impossible.""

He waved his hands around it, looking for strings. Nothing. I grabbed it.

""I’ve tried everything.""

""I’m sorry.""

I went back home in the early morning, tried to sleep. Fred hasn’t called me since. I’ve tried calling him. He doesn’t answer.

I’m writing this because I don’t know what else to do. Do any of you have problems with a rubber ball too?",1,1771458582.0,Rimmont,0,1.0,False

Mia waved her hand in front of his face. “Hello? Earth to Barrett!”.Mia’s Husband finally looked up at her. She repeated herself as he took his headphones out. “We’re not retired, Barrett.” “Well that’s the genius of it.” Barrett replied. “Here, check this out.” He swiped down to disconnect his earbuds and showed her his phone. On it she saw a youngish man with multicolored hair. Obviously filming the video “selfie style” from the driver’s seat of a newer looking car. The bottom of the screen showed a profile picture of the man, and read “@ThriftyTheo”.“Hey my thrifty folks!” The man exclaimed with the type of excitement that seemed to be a commodity for influencers, “If you’re a freelancer, you are going to want to hear this.” The video cut to a screenshot of a website, “Retirely.ai”.  ThriftyTheo’s voiceover continued. Everyone knows about Retirely. It’s a membership for older folks right? Wrong. There is no age minimum to get a Retirely account! None! I know what you’re gonna say, ‘but Theo, don’t you have to be retired?’ Wrong again! You just need to not have a W2. That’s what Retirely uses to decide if someone is retired. And let me tell you, the deals are absolutely too good to be true. Except they ARE true. Alright, I’m out. Stay Thrifty!Barrett clicked his phone off and looked at Mia. Two years of mortgage payments had made him obsessive about saving money. ""Here, check this out."" He had gotten his laptop out, turning it so she could see the screen. Mia knew what was coming. Another scheme. Another ""opportunity"" Barrett had discovered that would let him avoid going back to the agency. She'd been patient about the consultancy thing, even though her graphic design gigs were barely keeping them afloat. Between the mortgage and everything else, they were one emergency away from real trouble.The screen showed the Retirely website. Barrett had pulled up a page called ""available discounts"".

Mia’s eyes started to glaze over. “I don't see how 3 cents off gas is going to-“

“-This isn't AARP, Mia."" Barrett interrupted. Mia locked eyes with him.

""Sorry for interrupting. But just look at this."" He said. “Forty percent off gas, fifty percent off meals out, one hundred dollar rebate on groceries.” He added, eyes wide. “This is how we can finally overcome all the inflation, get out of our office jobs, maybe even save some money” he scrolled down. “Look here, three-day all inclusive spa and resort, flights included, nine hundred dollar value, just eighty five dollars.”“Yeah how about this one?” Mia pointed to the screen, ""those are really cheap coffins."" She smiled wryly. ""Prepaid funeral services - sixty percent off! That's one way to plan ahead."" Barrett waved his hand dismissively. ""I know, there are some weird ones. We're not their target audience. Just keep going, I think there are a few more you might like”“Holy shit!” Mia exclaimed.“What?” Barrett asked. Mia pointed at the screen “They have my favorite Azelaic Acid face cream for just two bucks! Do you know how expensive that stuff is?”Barrett grinned, “Oh I do. So…”“Ok sign us up. I guess we’re retiring early”——— *Thump*“Barrett, wake up” Mia said, grabbing his shoulder. “I think something just hit the roof.”“What?” Barrett said, rubbing sleep from his eyes “Oh I think that’s the retirely thing”. “Why would it hit the roof?” Mia asked, still half asleep. She checked the time on her phone. Five AM.“You know these tech companies, babe, they deliver it by drone,” Barrett yawned “I’m sure it’s fine. I’ll get up there and grab it when we wake up.” They went back to sleep. ——— “What would we have done if we were actually old?” Barrett yelled into the house. “If we were older, just getting the welcome package might have been a risky endeavor” he said as he slid the ladder away in the garage.Mia opened the box. She found a high gloss poster that read, in enormous type Welcome to the best years of your life and had the familiar Retirely logo. Beneath it was a large packet. Mia flipped through the pages of extensive instructions for using the Retirely app. Every page printed on what looked like thirty two point font.They had figured out how to use the app the day they signed up. Mia threw the packet in the trash. Barrett came into the kitchen and reached into the box and pulled out a smaller booklet. He began to flip through it. He smiled up at Mia. “It’s just the same coupons from the app. Must be for our fellow members who are technologically challenged.”Mia reached into the box and felt something sharp. “Ow!” She pulled her hand out, and had a nick on her finger. “Something broke when they dropped it on the roof.” Barrett reached in carefully, and pulled out a curved triangular shard of ceramic. He grabbed the other piece of it, and put them together. It was a coffee mug that read “I’m Retired. Every day is Saturday!”“Well that’s a shame” Mia shifted her head to get a better look in the box. ""Looks like there's one more bigger thing in there"". Barrett reached in and showed it to Mia with a grin. A pill organizer, the kind with compartments for each day of the week. ""Not their target audience!"" they both said, smiling. Barrett put it on the counter and reached back into the box, pulling out a large bottle. ""Men's Daily Multivitamin,"" he read, grinning. He twisted off the cap and shook two into his palm. ""Might as well. Free vitamins."" ""You don't even take vitamins,"" Mia said. ""I do now."" He swallowed them dry and tossed the bottle on the counter. Barrett took a smaller piece of paper from the box.Barrett took out his phone. “Here we go” he said, pointing the phone camera at the paper, scanning the QR code to activate their membership.“Ok, we’re in.” He said, “you’re gonna want to scan this on your phone too. Let’s go gas up the car.” Two

Mia had heard of deals before. She had seen people use coupons. But this was incredible. Unheard of. Their membership had been active for less than six hours. There was a section in the app that showed their total savings so far. It read $342.98.They left the house that morning and filled the car with gas for seventy five cents per gallon. Then they got lunch. Barrett took a photo of their receipt, and his checking account was instantly credited back with half of what they had paid at the restaurant. Then they went to see a movie. Four dollars for movie tickets. Not each. Total.“This is what prices were like when today’s retirees were our age!” Barrett exclaimed as they left the theater. Next, they went grocery shopping. Seventy five percent off select frozen food, and a flat rate of thirty percent off everything else. The groceries that would likely last them two weeks came out to sixty eight dollars.Mia couldn’t wipe the smile from her face as they drove home. “How is this even possible?”“I know right?” Barrett replied “I see stuff all the time that claims to be like, a money cheat code, but this one”, He burped, “this one was actually legit.” Mia noticed a look of concern on Barrett’s face. “What’s wrong?” She asked.“Nothing, I’m fine. Just got a little nauseous there.” He replied, “Probably over ate at the restaurant.” He laughed.

———

Mia woke up to a guttural sound. “Barrett?” She asked into the darkness.“I’m in here, I’m fine” he replied between heaving sounds. “I just... had to throw up. Was probably something I ate.”Mia looked at her phone. Three AM. She got up and went to the bathroom. Barrett was sitting on the floor, his face near the toilet. He was pale and shaking a bit.“You sure you’re ok?” She asked. “I’ll be fine, just go back to sleep”.Barrett didn’t come back to bed. At eight, Mia went back to the bathroom. She sat on the edge of the bathtub, looking at her sick and in-denial husband.  “This is so weird. We ate all the same things yesterday, didn’t we?” She ran a hand through his hair.“Yeah” Barrett said, burping.“Except…” Mia trailed off.  “The vitamins!” She exclaimed. Barrett looked up at her. ""What?"" ""The vitamins from the welcome box. You're the only one who took them."" She was already walking to the kitchen. She came back with the bottle, squinting at the label. ""Barrett, the expiration date on this is 2019."" ""That can't be right."" ""I'm calling Retirely."" — The hold music was uncomfortably cheerful. When someone finally picked up, the voice was so aggressively friendly it was almost jarring. ""Hi! Thank you for calling Retirely! This is Summer, how can I make your day better?"" ""Hi, Summer. So, we just joined Retirely and it's been amazing so far. The discounts and coupons have been incredible. But we had an issue with the welcome box.”“Alright I’m just looking up your account.” Summer said “Oh, I see you and your husband are young retirees.” There was a beat. “Is that… allowed?” Mia asked.“Yeah that’s fine! So tell me about the issue with the welcome box” Summer replied in her saccharine customer service voice.“These vitamins,” Mia started, “It looks like they expired?”  ""Oh my goodness, I am SO sorry to hear that!  Okay, I see you just activated two days ago, welcome to the Retirely family! And oh! Oh no. Okay, I see what happened here."" Summer’s voice somehow got even more sympathetic. ""Those vitamins were part of our Senior Wellness bundle. They're formulated for members over seventy. I have no idea how they ended up in your welcome package! This is completely our fault."" ""He's really sick,"" Mia said.“I completely understand,” Summer chirped, “and again, on behalf of everyone here at Retirely, I do apologize for the mix up. Here is what I am going to do for you. I’m adding a two hundred dollar credit to your account.”“Wow, really?” Mia said into the phone, she held the microphone to her hand, and turned to Barrett and mouthed “two hundred dollars!”Barrett smiled wearily.“Yeah you should see that in your app… right… now” Summer added.Mia looked down at her phone, then back at Barrett giving him a thumbs up.“Oh thank you so much, Summer, you really didn’t have to-““Oh it’s my pleasure.” Summer replied promptly, “In fact, I am also going to upgrade you and Barrett to Retirely plus. No extra charge, and this will give you access to our concierge medical hotline, pharmacy discounts, and 24/7 priority customer service.” “Oh thank you Summer” Mia said, looking down to Barrett with concern, “Should we call them now about his… symptoms?” ""The symptoms should pass within 24 hours.” Summer said, “It's just because his system isn't used to that particular formulation. But if he's not better by tomorrow evening, please use that medical hotline. Again, I cannot tell you how sorry we are. Is there anything else I can help you with today?"" ""No, I think that's... that's it."" ""Wonderful! Thank you so much for being a Retirely member, and we hope Barrett feels better soon! You two have a great rest of your day!"" The line went dead. Mia sat on the bathroom floor next to Barrett. She opened the Retirely app. Their membership now had a little gold badge next to it that said ""Premium Plus."" ""They gave us money,"" she said quietly. ""And upgraded us."" Barrett groaned. ""Great. Worth it."" “She said you'll be better by tomorrow."" ""Cool."" Mia looked at the vitamin bottle in her hand. The expiration date really did say 2019. She tossed it in the trash. ""Barrett?"" ""Yeah?"" ""That was weird, right?"" Barrett didn't answer. He'd fallen asleep against the bathtub. Mia looked back at her phone. The savings counter had updated: $562.98. In two days. She closed the app.

Three Two weeks had gone by since the bad vitamins, and Mia had to admit to herself that Barrett’s crazy plan might have just worked. The lower financial stress had helped her better deliver to her clients, and she had new referrals for logos and web design coming in. It felt like they could finally breathe. Barrett used the Retirely discount to get professional headshots, attend some local networking events, and even had some leads coming in for his freelance consulting. For the first time since they bought the house, it really felt like they could do this.

They were buying more, but their monthly spending was down. Their savings, which had dwindled to almost nothing soon after Barrett left his job, was slowly growing again. On the Retirely app, their total membership savings so far read 3,419.26.

Mia had just finished a landing page for a client when she heard what sounded like a gunshot.“Barrett, babe! Everything alright?” Mia yelled from the living room. “I’m fine!” Barrett replied “I think our lawnmower is finally dead.”He appeared in the living room, looking down at his phone. “Retirely can have a new one to us later today.” He said, grinning, “guess how much it retails for?”Mia rolled her eyes, but smiled all the same. “A million dollars”.Barrett showed her his phone. A five thousand dollars. And Retirely had it marked down to $200.“I think we can dip into our savings for that, no?” Barrett asked.

Not more than an hour later they heard a loud humming noise.

Mia and Barrett looked up from their phones and at each other. “Is that the lawnmower? So fast.” Mia said.

“It’s those drones, babe.” Barrett replied, “They must have needed a bigger one this-“Barrett was interrupted by a loud crashing noise.

They both rushed out through the garage. The giant wooden box was on its side, and a small chunk of their roof had been torn off. unlocked her phone and started dialing.

As Mia listened to the cheerful holding music, Barrett used a crowbar to open the box.“I think it’s ok, babe!” Barrett exclaimed, “They packed it in foam.” He looked up at their garage roof. “We might need some repair here though.

The hold music stopped. “Retirely customer support, This is June” just as chipper as the last. Mia watched her husband retrieve the lawnmower as she spoke into the phone on speaker.“Hi June, Mia here, I just wanted to let you all know about an issue with our last delivery” Mia said with growing anger.“Yes! Mia, was that the lawnmower? I am just seeing you got the Retirely plus priority same day delivery, what seems to be the problem? Did the lawnmower make it in tact?” June replied.

“Yeah June, the lawnmower seems fine” Mia looked at Barrett as he gave her a thumbs up. “But it took a chunk out of our roof on the way down”“Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that Mia. You know these drones, a little change in wind speed and things like this can happen. Can you send me a picture of the damage to your house via the in-app support file upload feature?”Mia walked out to the driveway and used her phone to take a few pictures of the damaged roof. “It’s uploading June, you should see it in-““Yes I am seeing it now” June said.“- a few seconds.” Mia said, rolling her eyes at Barrett as he removed foam pads from the bottom of his new toy.“Oh, Mia, let me just say on behalf of everyone here at Retirely I am so sorry about this drone error.” June bubbled, “we are going to send out a crew to fix that this weekend.”“Really?” Mia asked. “Is that standard protocol for this type of thing?” Seems like it would be a little loud.”“Oh it’s 100% included in your membership, and so is the weekend getaway.” June said.“What?” Mia asked. “That’s right! All inclusive stay in a cottage in Vermont for the two of you. Nine hundred dollar value. On us. Car service included!” June beamed.Barrett looked up at Mia, nodding his head.“Oh, ok, when do we leave?” Mia could feel the anger dissolving. The thought of a free vacation was just too good to question.“The car should be there to pick you up Friday morning at 10am. It’s warm in Vermont, and the cottage has a pool, so bring your swim suits. The cottage has hiking poles and climbing equipment if you want.”

“Cool. And your crew, will they need access to the house?” Mia asked. “Nope!” June intoned. “Based on these photos, they should just be able to repair the roof from the outside. Our structural team has assured me that the damage is mostly cosmetic. Will that be all for today Mia?”“Yeah, thanks”. Mia said.“Vermont?” Barrett asked. Mia nodded. “Pack your swimsuit”.

———

Barrett sat on the couch with his backpack next to him as Mia got ready. The car would be there soon, she knew. “Did you pack your swimsuit?” Mia asked.“Yup” Barrett said absently as he looked as his phone. “Oh that’s a shame”.“What? Mia said. “Thriftytheo died” Barrett said.“What?” Mia asked, walking towards Barrett. “He was so young! Like our age right?” “Yep,” Barrett said, turning his phone to show Mia a news article.The headline read: “Influencer dead in freak electrical fire”

“It really sucks” Barrett said. “Think about what our lives would be like if it wasn’t for him?”

They heard a car honk twice outside.

“That must be our driver” Mia said, grabbing the handle on her rolling luggage.

The car was one of the more recent Honda Civics.

Barrett rounded the car to meet the driver, then looked back at Mia. “Babe, check this out!” He yelled back.The car had no driver. In the driver’s seat was a device with several metal extensions coming from a central unit.“Hello, Barrett and Mia” The voice seemed to come from external speakers on the car. “My name is Beebo. I am here to drive you to Mount Anthony in beautiful Vermont.”The trunk of the car opened automatically.Mia was a little alarmed, but it’s not as if driverless taxis were unheard of. “Are you sure about this, Barret?” She asked “We don’t have to go, maybe we can get a different gift from them. We haven’t had the best experience with retiree’s automated vehicles.”“Babe what? No” Barrett said, “Drones are finicky, it’s the wind. There is so much more research and development for this kind of tech. It’s gonna be fine. Haven’t you always wanted to go to Vermont?”Mia sighed. “Yeah ok.”

The ride did not start great. The robot stopped very suddenly at what it thought was a child, but was actually just a stick. After that, it was better though. The robot got them out of town and onto the highway with no blatant errors or lapses in judgement.

“Isn’t this cool?” Barrett said with childlike wonder.“Yeah, I have to admit, this is pretty cool” Mia smiled, “I think I’m gonna nap.” Wake me up when we get to the mountains.”

———

Mia awoke to a feeling of wetness on her cheek.

Barrett was screaming“Mia? Babe? Get up we need to get out of here.”

There was water in the car. Mia thought that was funny as she rubbed her eyes.

Barrett turned to the cracked window “Help!” He cried.

They were in water. What the hell had even happened? Mia tried to clear the fog from her brain as she saw her husband taking his shirt off and wrapping it around his fist.

“Cover your eyes Mia” he said with adrenaline in his voice, “I’m gonna break the window.”

Mia covered her eyes and heard a loud shattering noise as water began to fill the back seat of the Honda Civic.

Barrett grabbed Mia and pulled her out of the open window. This really woke her up, and they both swam to the shore of the small lake.

They could see mountains on the horizon as the Honda Civic sank to the bottom of the lake.

They stood on the side of the road, Barrett held his thumb out, but they hadn’t seen another car yet.

“What happened?” Mia asked.

“Babe, it was crazy” Barrett said, his voice ragged, “We got off the highway maybe 30 minutes ago, and we’re driving right up here” he pointed up the road to where Mia could see skid marks, “The car just hit the brakes and veered off into the lake.”

A car drove up to them and stopped. The driver was a middle aged woman. Barrett approached her passenger window as it retracted. ""Hey! Thank you so much for stopping. Our car went in the lake, do you think you could get us to Pearl River?"" ""Sure, I'm headed that way. Get in"" the woman replied. They climbed into the back seat, dripping lake water onto her upholstery. ""I'm so sorry about your seats,"" Mia said. ""Don't worry about it."" The woman pulled back onto the road. ""What happened? Car just go off?"" ""It was one of those driverless ones,"" Barrett said. ""Just... malfunctioned, I guess."" ""Ah."" The woman nodded knowingly. ""Technology. My father was all about that stuff. Always signing up for the latest apps and services."" She laughed softly. ""He got on this retirement membership thing a few months ago. Retirely, I think? He was so excited about the discounts.""Mia and Barrett exchanged a glance. ""Was?"" Mia asked carefully. ""Oh. Yeah."" The woman's voice softened. ""He passed away about two weeks later. Heart attack. He was eighty-three, so... you know. It was his time."" She glanced at them in the rearview mirror. ""But he loved that service while he had it. Saved him a fortune on his prescriptions."" ""I'm so sorry for your loss,"" Mia said quietly. ""Thank you. He had a good life."" The woman turned her attention back to the road. ""You two live in Pearl River?"" ""Yeah,"" Barrett said. ""Just off Main Street."" The rest of the ride passed in silence, Mia staring out the window while Barrett squeezed her hand. They arrived back at their home just after dark. Their garage roof was already fixed

Four When they got inside, Mia got on her computer to order them new phones. “We’re paying full price.” She said sternly, “they’ll be here the day after tomorrow. Amazon won’t try to kill us.”Barrett huffed. “Don’t you think you’re being a little dramatic? It was an accident.”

“It was four accidents, Barrett” Mia said. “They dropped the welcome package on the house, they poisoned you, they broke our roof, and then they drove us into a lake with that stupid driverless car!”

“Ok. Yes. But that was all through Retiree’s delivery and fulfillment services.” Barrett said, hands on his hips, “What if we just stay on for the gas and groceries? We could still do this, babe.”

Mia didn’t look up from the computer.

“Here, Look at this” she said, turning the screen towards Barrett.

It was a video from Thriftytheo, dated 2 days ago. He looked into the screen, smiling but with some nervousness.Hey thrifty gang! I just wanted to let you know about a whole nother great feature of Retirely! The partner provider network! These are doctors, veterinarians, plumbers, housekeepers and more, at hefty discounts. And if you have Retirely plus, like me? They are free. Just got my wiring redone by a Retirely-approved electrician. Scheduling was easy, and it was totally free. Stay Thrifty!“Barrett” Mia started, “That was the last video he made.”

“Ok, I’ll admit it’s shady with the timing,”Barrett said, “but we don’t have all the facts!”

“Yeah? How about this?” Mia asked, turning the screen back at her husband. It was a reddit thread.

The post title: “PSA: Be careful with 'Retirely' - shady practices?”

The article linked didn’t open, but the body of the post read:Just seeing a lot of younger people signing up for Retirely. I work for an investment bank and we just did due diligence on the company. They are hemorrhaging money, and no one at my work understands how their business model works. The membership is less than one tenth the value of what most members get from it. I have heard good things about the discounts, but I have heard their delivery service is glitchy. Anyone use it? What do you think about the membership?“Look at the comments, Barrett” Mia said.

“Whoa.” Barrett replied, “And all these accounts have been deleted?”

\[deleted user\] 2 points 4 months agoI signed up because of ThriftyTheo's video. Two weeks later my brakes failed. Retirely partner mechanic had just done an inspection the day before. \[deleted user\] 5 points 4 months agoMy partner hotel had a gas leak. Woke up feeling sick, couldn't think straight. The CO detector in the room wasn't working. \[deleted user\] 8 points 3 months agoGuys I'm genuinely scared. Three 'accidents' in two months. All at Retirely partner locations or with partner products. I tried to cancel but I couldn’t afford to.

“Wait, What is that?” Mia said pointing to the last one “what did they mean?”

“Maybe like, the discounts?” Barrett replied.

She opened a new tab and went to the Retirely website. She signed in and clicked “live support”

A popup blinked onto the screen, with the Retirely logo and a sound wave animation. “Hello, Retirely support, this is Coral speaking.” The voice was as chipper as June. As chipper as Summer. “Am I speaking to Mia and and Barrett? How is Vermont?”

“Yeah about that,” Mia started, “we never made it to the cottage. Your car tried to kill us, Coral. It drove right into a lake, my husband had to break us out of the car, and we hitchhiked home.”“Oh I am so sorry to hear that,” Coral started,  “you know what? I am going to set you two up with-“

“Hey. Coral” Mia interrupted, “I think we actually just want to cancel.”

There was a long pause.

“Are you, Are you sure about that?” Coral faltered.

“Yep.” Mia said, “Pretty sure. We are just not super jazzed with the life threatening situations. I think we’ll just go back to paying full price on gas.”

“Oh, ok” Coral sighed, “Let me transfer you to cancellations.”

The hold music came from the computer as Mia looked up at Barrett.

“We’ll figure this out, ok?” She said.

Barrett looked down. “I just really don’t want to go back to the office.” He straightened his shirt a bit, “But I will if I have to.”

The music ended mid melody and a new voice came on. Older, less energetic.

“Hello this is Holly, I understand you wanted to cancel your Retirely plus membership?” The voice said.

“Yes, hi holly” Mia said, grinning, “We would like to cancel effective immediately.”

“Have you already wired your cancellation fee?” Holly barked.

“No we haven’t.” Mia said. “How much is it? A couple hundred bucks?” There was a long pause. “Check your welcome packet.” Holly croaked.“So that’s the thing, Holly,” Mia started, weaponizing her own customer service voice, “We don’t have our onboarding paperwork. Can you just tell us how much the cancellation fee is?”“I’m sending you a link through the online portal.” Holly said curtly. “Call back when you’ve paid up and we can talk cancellation”.

The line went dead.

A message box opened up with a link. Mia clicked to download the PDF of their onboarding paperwork. She searched the document for cancellation terms.

Barrett sighed, eyes glazing over, “They really make this a pain, maybe we should think about-““Here it is.” Mia interrupted. “Cancellation fee… home equity... Oh fuck”

“What? How much is it?” Barrett asked.

Mia pulled up a calculator app on her laptop. “Barrett, if we cancel. They can take the house.”

“What?” Barrett exclaimed. “How is that even legal?”

“They have our e-signatures from when we signed up. The cancellation fee is tied to the value of the house. It comes out to forty seven thousand dollars given our mortgage terms and the house’s current market-“

As Mia spoke, their power went out.

“-value” Mia said.

Five “Our phones should get there later today” Mia said. “What is the power company saying?” Barrett wiped his eyes with sleep. They had stayed in the car that night. Mia didn’t want to take any chances.

“Huh?” Barrett said, staring absently at his laptop screen. “Oh, they said there is no issue on their end. They can’t send a technician until Monday.”

“Monday?” Mia looked up from her laptop. They were in the parking lot of a nearby coffee shop so they could get on the wifi. “That’s the day after tomorrow. What are we supposed to do?”

“Yeah” Barrett rubbed his face “I said it was an emergency. They said that if it is reading normal on their end, it’s not an emergency. Y’know, I bet Retirely could send someone out in just a few-“

“No” Mia interrupted. She had stayed awake most of the night reading through the terms and conditions they signed less than 3 weeks ago. “Sorry, I’m just a little on edge.”“Understandable” Barrett yawned.

One passage in the cancellation terms kept replaying in Mia’s mind.

""In the event of total property loss due to fire, flood, natural disaster, or other act of God...""

“Maybe we just go to a hotel?” Barrett asked, “Just wait it out. We’ll get our phones later today, stay 2 nights and the technicians will come to the house on Monday”

“A Retirely partner hotel?” Mia asked.“No, probably not” Barrett answered.

“Why don’t we just go home?” Mia asked, “If the house is still safe, we’re probably okay until Monday.”

“Are you serious?” Barrett questioned.

""I mean, it's daytime. And maybe, just maybe we're being a little paranoid."" Mia kept her voice casual, reasonable. ""ThriftyTheo's fire happened at night. If something's wrong with our electrical, we'd see smoke, smell something. We could wait there for the phones, then decide what to do.""

“I don’t know, Mia” Barrett said, barely putting up a fight.

""Barrett."" She reached over and took his hand. “We can't live in our car. And we can't afford a hotel. Let's just go home, get the phones, and figure this out. Maybe you're right. Maybe there's another way.""

“You really think so?” He asked, searching her face.

“I think…” She trailed off, “I think we’re tired, and sleep deprived, and not thinking straight. We’ll get to the house and sleep in shifts, just for the weekend.” The lies came easily. She squeezed his hand. ""Let's just go home.""

———

Their house looked completely normal and unthreatening. The newly repaired roof shingles gleamed in the morning light. The suburban dream they had shared for so much of their lives, had finally come true just two years earlier.

The lawnmower sat in its box in the driveway partially unwrapped, foam padding scattered around it.

When they got inside, Barrett tried the light switch. “Power’s still out” he said as Mia walked towards the sunlit kitchen.

“That’s weird” Mia said.

“What?” Barrett asked.

He came into the kitchen and saw her pointing to the microwave. The clock was on, blinking, frozen at around the time they arrived back the previous night, waiting to be set.

Barrett tried moved toward an outlet with his laptop charger.

“Wait!” Mia exclaimed, but it was too late. He plugged it in and his phone began charging.

“It works.” Barrett said, shocked, “and our wifi is back on. Doesn’t really make sense, right?”

“None of this makes sense” Mia retorted. She walked to the kitchen window, looked out at their backyard. The grass was getting long. ""You know what? Why don't you try out the new lawnmower? The grass needs it anyway. I’ll figure out which of the outlets work.”

Barrett looked at her like she was insane. ""You want me to mow the lawn right now? What happened to sleeping in shifts?”

“I’ll be ok for an hour or so” Mia replied warmly “We’re just waiting for our phones right? We’ll sleep in shifts once they get here. Besides, you were so excited about the lawnmower, five thousand dollar retail value, might as well get our money’s worth”

""Mia,” Barrett started. ""I'm serious. Go. I'll watch for the delivery."" She needed him outside. Needed him away. ""It'll be good to do something normal. Clear your head.""

Barrett hesitated. He looked around and shrugged “Yeah okay. You’re right.” He looked around as if the room had a crowd, smiling “Public service announcement! My wife is correct, yet again!”

Mia waited until she heard the garage door open, heard him wrestling with the packaging. Then she moved. Once Barrett had gone past the threshold on his way to the backyard, she headed to the garage. She grabbed the Gas can they had kept for the old lawnmower. She climbed the stairs to the second floor. The attic access was in the hallway ceiling. She pulled down the ladder, climbed up into the dim space.

The repair crew had been up here. She could see the new work. Fresh lumber where the drone had crashed through, new wiring running along the joists. She touched one of the wires. It was warm. Not hot, but warm. In a house with no power.

She unscrewed the cap on the gas can and started pouring. Outside, she heard the lawnmower roar to life. Barrett would be out there for another half hour. Maybe more.

Mia poured the gas, starting with a generous amount on the new wiring. She took the can down the ladder and poured more gas on the second floor. She stood at the top of the stairs, looking down at their house. The photos on the wall—their wedding, their families, their life. The paint colors they'd chosen. The floors they'd refinished.

She finished the can in the downstairs by the living room. She grabbed her and Barrett’s laptops as she ambled into the kitchen, turning the stove on and blowing out the flame. She reached into the cupboard and grabbed some matches.

She made her way to the front door to take one final look. Two years of mortgage payments. Every dollar they'd saved for the down payment. She struck the match.

She walked casually around the side of the house as smoke began to emerge from the downstairs window. Once she rounded the corner she started running, yelling to Barrett.

""Barrett!"" Mia's scream cut through the sound of the lawnmower. ""Barrett, fire! Stay there!” He killed the engine, looked up. Smoke was pouring from the second-floor windows.

“Oh my god!” He started running towards the house but Mia stopped him with a firm palm to his chest.

“It’s too late” she said.

The windows burst as Mia and Barrett covered their heads. Glass and roof shingles flew almost as far out as the end of the yard.

———

The firefighters were still spraying water on the decrepit pile of wood and concrete when the amazon delivery van showed up. Mia signed for the package.

She activated her new phone and dialed the number. It was seared into her memory. She put it on speaker phone.

“Is this really the time to call them, babe?” Barrett said, confused.

“We’re finishing this” Mia said with determination. The holding music stopped.

“Retirely, this is Ray speaking how may I help-“ the voice started. Lilting and cheerful as ever.

“Cancellations.” Mia interrupted, “Put me through to cancellations”

The transfer was almost instantaneous.

“Hello, you’ve reached Retirely cancellations department.” The voice said slowly, almost lethargically “This is Noel. How can I help you?”

“Hi Noel. Mia here.” Mia said with confidence “We’re ready to cancel.”

“Just looking up your account, I’m sorry this must be a mistake” Noel stammered, “are you sure you have the right account number?”

“Yep.” Mia replied.

There was another long pause. “But our records show that you and your husband are-“ Noel started.

“Deceased?” Mia said. “Nope. But we’ve paid our cancellation fee.”

Barrett looked at her with confusion, Mia nodded and mouthed “I’ll explain”.

“That’s impossible.” Noel scolded “the contract clearly states-“

“I read your fucking contract, Noel, It’s very clear about cancellations. The fee is tied to our home equity. Our home’s value. I can assure you, our home is now basically worthless. But you knew that. You just didn’t know that we left before it burned down.”

“You seem to know our terms quite well Mia”, Noel said with a smug tone “you have unlocked fee-free cancellation. Press the pound sign on your phone to verify.”

Mia shoved her thumb against the phone and with a beep, a robotic voice started  “Thank you for choosing Retirely. Please stay on the line for a quick survey.” Mia ended the call.",3,1771458394.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I hope you are doing well today and continue to have a fantastic day.

I'm not the best at introductions for myself, so please bear with me. 

I am a 25 year old bisexual (leaning more female preference) male. I'm bi-racial, around 5'10 (177.8 cm) and practically blind without my glasses. I have brown eyes and short brown hair that can get curly if it grows out. I'm on the skinnier and lean side, weighing only 135 pounds as I have a rather high metabolism. I do struggle with mental issues, but I am on medications and quite stable with them.

I have two pets. A cat that doesn't like people and prefers to hide from them when they come over and a Leopard Gecko that I've had since I was about 8 years old. 

I'm a huge nerd! I love DnD (would love to actually do a game of it one day), Magic the Gathering, History, Anime, Manga, Fantasy, Science Fiction, etc. I'm always open to trying new things as well. 

I play a bunch of video games in my spare time. Mostly RPG's and fighting games. Baldur's Gate 3 and Skyrim have me in a chokehold right now! Same with Warframe! Although, Code Vein 2 has been keeping my attention as well since it came out. I do play on Xbox as my PC gave out on me a couple of years ago unfortunately. Haven't had the funds to get a new one yet. 

I work 12 hour shifts Friday through Sunday and have Monday through Thursday off so I have a lot of time to do stuff. Let's meet up and get coffee or Boba! 😋

As for what I'm looking for, honestly I'm just looking for someone to match my energy really. Personality is the most important thing to me above all else. 

That and kindness. Someone who is sweet, patient, nerdy and an absolute goofball would have my heart instantly if I'm honest lol. 

I would prefer someone around my age but I don't mind a little younger or a little older. 

If this catches anyone's attention please feel free to reach out! I do have a Discord but I will not post that here. If we click and hit it off I'll be more than happy to give that to you. 

Best wishes to all and have a wonderful day! :D",2,1771458332.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False
1r8jdle,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1r8jdle/headhunter_ii/,Headhunter II,"The sorcerer had a funny thought, as he gazed down on all of the neon squalor glow of the Fallen Angel City below him from the rooftops edge.  

The Nazis were right. You are a degenerate species…

It was all of it a swollen pustule sac. A land of green milk and curdled cheese, cockroaches swam in the stew of discharge and mire and laughably called it a metropolitan. A cultural hub. 

A blade of a smile formed amongst a tumult of dark and ageless hair, a wizard's haggard beard. Blasted by sand and sun just like the rest of the white robed man. White robed death. 

Some say he is the mad author of the Necronomicon. He has authored the destruction of countless cities, countless places… before this one. 

Jericho. Troy. Münster. Constantinople. Alexandria. Roanoke. Ikeshima. Rome. 

And many others… great and small. He doesn't care. He only loved to watch as the red hand of Iblis crawled across the blackening surface of all things dying in its embrace, turning the whole of the world into its killing floor. 

But that wasn't all with this place. No. He was sent here not just to burn but to gather intelligence for the order. 

And to contest. 

…

Homicide was scrambling. They had nothing. What commonalities they did find between the victims was interesting… but it only led to more bafflement. More flummoxed minds in the busying police departments all across the city. All bullshit pretension had been dropped, all departments across all counties and neighborhoods were working together on this one, to bring the crazy fucking bastard in. 

But still they had nothing. Except that he liked to chop off heads. And leave them at churches for some fucking reason. 

And one other thing. One oddity that more than a few of the sharper minds amongst the rank and file of criminal investigators found to be interesting. 

But did it mean anything? 

All of them. Every head found belonged to someone with a rap sheet that read more like a tome. Miles long some of em. Each and every one of em had a history. 

Mob hits! that was the popular running theory around the suits and their steaming white paper cups of coffee. 

It wasn't a bad one, most thought. 

Could be. Could be.

…

Azræl leapt from the dark and charged into the man as he was making his way to his car. Slamming him into the driver's door as he tried to open it and catching him by surprise. 

This was the one. This was one of the faces the goat-shape demanded be brought before her feet. 

His hand, clenched tightly round the hilt of his great sword came up and bashed the maggot across the mouth with the metal pommel of the weapon. A crack, and a splurt of hot blood and teeth out the mouth and the maggot went down to his knees, mewling. 

Where he belonged. 

The maggot struggled to speak and beg as the headhunter raised his great blade above his head. Readying to strike. 

“Not at all for you or yourself. Swear to her. Pray to me.” said Azræl as he brought the blade down and cleaved the head free from the rest of the meat. It tumble-jumped with a ropey-cord tail of thick black red that the stump continued to produce and shoot in dark gouts for a moment before the headless body collapsed to the street. 

And then the night was quiet again. All around.  Lights buzzed and mock heaven glowed. 

The peace was relative, conditionary. You could still hear the ghost song of sirens in the distance. Wailing away in flight, in search, in search of anything. 

Azræl picked up the head and said his prayers to the goat-shaped lord of his house and order. He tied it to the belt of his hulking black leather visage to join two others and went on his way. 

The sorcerer watched. The sorcerer was impressed.

He heaved. Spewed. Decorated the sidewalk and gutter in more bile, blood and stomach lining as another sharp stab in his stomach racked his guts and his convulsion threatened to roll over into a seizing tear in his brain. 

Homeless and well past his last leg, Elton prayed for death as his sickened body worsened on the pavement, alone at the bus stop. Underneath the flickering glow of a dying bulb, a failing light. 

It was not death he received but something more spectacular. Elton, Grabby to his friends and scum and fellow urchins of the street, was made audience and thus unwitting chronicler to a chapter in a shadow conflict centuries upon centuries old, perhaps the oldest conflict in all of man's time. Perhaps even older than that. 

Grabby/Elton looked up from his own bloody spew of booze and lining and watched a giant titan walk into view. Destroying his solitude on this witching houred boulevard. 

He knew he must be fucked. The guy looked massive and he looked like Mad Max or the Terminator or someone like that and he looked like he was carrying a huge fucking sword. 

And along his belt were a buncha fuckin heads…

No fucking way. The dying urchin refused it. No fuckin way am I actually seein that fuckin thing. 

But real or not, the giant of myth and flesh and chained leather continued to march up and then past the druggie’s view, crossing to and then down the opposite side of the street. 

But then something made the headhunter stop. 

Elton heard it too. 

A note.  Notes. Music. 

A wind pattern series flurry of intricate and delicate notes whispered and alternate sharp-stab blasted through the nighttime witching air. Filling it. Dominating the scene. 

Azræl tensed cat-like coiled as his hair stood on end. The music was flute-like. Middle Eastern flavored…

Goddamit. No.

The headhunter was filled with dread. 

The music stopped. An ancient voice, bold, cut through the night. 

“How are you, German? Been long time."" 

His stance shifted to battle ready as his blade came up raised. His voice, louder, cut through the night as well to the speaker unseen. But he knew who it was to whom he spoke. 

""What do you want, snake?”

Laughter. Real. The knight Azræl always was good for a laugh as far the sorcerer was concerned.

“So funny?"" Azræl said to the night all around him. “Come out and show me what's so funny, witch."" 

More laughter. 

“Have we not shared many things over the long years, my friend? Such a long time. A great deal.”

A series of images flicker-shot through the headhunter's mind then. Whether put there by the devilry of the sorcerer or memories of his own from one of many possible past lives, Azræl was not sure. If he lived through this encounter he would meditate and pray on the matter later. 

If he lived through this encounter. 

His mind's eye:

The forests and the forest people and their villages are burning. There is much bloodletting. The ground is gorged, it cannot possibly drink up all of it. It sloshes about the ankles of the soldiering and the marching and the frantic frightened running. The pursuers too. The blood that chokes the earth sloshes mire-like about the furnace steps of them all. Charlemagne has demanded these pagan northmen be put to kneel before the cross or be put to the sword. Slavery for their women and children…

… and the knights were thus dispatched thither…

The headhunter severed the line of thought or memory or whatever it was with brutal sudden cunning and roared into the empty silent night.

“Show yourself, mongrel!"" 

His laughter never seemed to cease. It stood in place of a physical person. Almost attaining its own physicality.

“You hurl insults because you've nothing else to throw! Nothing else to attack! You are hilarious, German! I've always liked you but you should not be so easy, not after all this time, no?"" 

He had to be careful. The sorcerer was dangerous. He could bend and weave reality seemingly at will, like a djin. None of his brotherhood nor the high priest could discern his source of power. Nor its limits. 

“I insult you, witch, because you and your kind are garbage."" 

Laughter that became a cacophonous crack! It dominated the world, the soundtrack hell to the neon witching scene. The music somehow came to life and began to play again, a wicked untethered horde flurry series of scaling and wild notes in wild man tandem with the laughter of the sorcerer, a corruption duet.

A ney. The headhunter remembers what it is that the instrument is called. A ney. 

Its sound and the sorcerer's laughter were a whirlwind maelstrom expansion sound swell within his skull. For a moment he considered taking his own blade and driving it into his own face, bashing it in and freeing that which was trapped within and growing, threatening to burst like the milk of green infection.

He stopped himself at the last moment. His training saving him. He recognized what was happening, what it was…

… bewitchment. 

He regained his focus against the tumult wave of sound storm wielded by the sorcerer, who once again cried out from nowhere. 

“Garbage! We are all garbage for the earth, German. We are all meat detritus for the watering jaws of the starving soil, we all return to it, are all reduced to ruin and returned to the sour womb to feed the indifferent planet. You know! You know! Only our petty Gods care! And so they fight! And, we, their moving pieces!”

And with that, the pieces did move. 

 Hand of Iblis. The mad sorcerer. 

Against champion of the goat-shape, Azræl.

And this modern Sodom of steel and human woe was to be the chess board for their latest match. A contest of secret champions. 

He did not see, but felt… 

Behind him. Movement. Killing stance. 

The headhunter whirled round with sudden animal speed in a counter slash. Roaring. 

But he roared… and slashed… at nothing. 

Nothing there. Only thin night air. 

Laughter/voice. Behind him again. 

“The same tricks always work on all of you."" 

He whirled once more. Nothing. 

The laughter again. Across the street. 

Azræl drew throwing dagger and with a lunge and a flick/turn of the forearm and wrist, threw the quivering blade. 

It struck pavement next to a dying drunk in a splatter burst of caveman fire spray. Grabby yelped. But there was no sorcerer of the sands over there. 

Or anywhere. 

Goddamit. 

""Up here.”

The headhunter whirled once more, a dancer upon my stage thought the sorcerer but kept it to himself. The German would not appreciate such an observation. 

""Why do you hide in a tree?” asked the black knight of the goat-shape order impetiously. 

The sorcerer grinned, balanced on the branch of a starving sapling oak. Running alongside a dark and quiet apartment building. 

""I've always appreciated a wider view, German. Always. Up here, I see more and I am closer to heaven and therefore I can see more like God. You… and your brothers… you stay down there in the dirt because you cannot know anything more."" 

Azræl raised blade. 

“Come down here and show me what I know, mongrel. Perhaps I can show you a thing or two as well."" 

The sorcerer shrugged. 

“Eh."" 

Azræl drew once more and threw. The throwing blade of ornate seven pointed star flew unabated, cutting through the nighttime chill like a deadly bird of sharpened stabbing steel. 

But when the piercing blade found the place in the tree where the heart of the sorcerer was, it no longer was there. 

It never had been. 

""I'm always behind you, German.” 

He spun on his booted heels and his great arms carried his tireless steel down in another great chop. But it was already too late. 

The sorcerer raised the ney and blocked the blow as if the wind instrument was an iron bar. He then flew in, swift movement that was not at all human or natural, stepping in close and bringing the long cylindrical body of the instrument down in a cracking blow across the headhunter's crown, splitting it and knocking consciousness from his mind's failing grip. 

But as he sent the headhunter's mind on a journey into darkness, he gave it another vision. A vision of flames. 

…

Jerusalem. 

Burning Jerusalem. 

where will you turn when it all goes wrong…?

The holy city is a cinder shrieking thousands as one. The holy city is in flames. 

… and you're on the run

And all around the city is a newly erected manmade hellscape forest grove. All around the city are the impaling lancing sticks. On them are the impaled. All of them are still screaming, screaming with their burning city. Man. Woman. Child. Animal. The warriors that have done this like to crucify lions for fun but for now, this will suffice. The people of the Lord's precious city will make satisfactory sport. 

And they do. As the forest of the impaled. All of them beg for death, they are the only words left, the only ones they can remember now in the throes of this special agony. Thousands upon thousands of shrieking lanced through but still living souls. Bodies skewered every which way, up through the groin, behind the genitals, upside down and through the tissue of the back, up the ass, gravity pulls savagely as if hungry and they slowly sink lower and lower along the stabbing spire body of the impaling lances as the time drags by with sadistic cruelty. The sheer heart attack torture of the sensations of tearing and rupture and bodily invasion and ruin as all and one horrible coalescence is all that any of them are capable of knowing in their last drawn out hours. For many it is days. 

And beside the forest of the impaled and all of its mindless shrieking, the burning city. 

Jerusalem. 

…

When the headhunter returned from darkness he was lying alone in the street. 

He sat up quickly, Panicked! 

His great sword was still clutched tightly. 

But when he looked around, the drunk that had been watching them was dead now. Blood foamed from his eyes and mouth like a hot porridge stew of thick sudsy pink. 

Worse yet, the sorcerer was gone. 

Worse than that, so were the heads. 

So was his offering…

Goddamit.

I would like to preface this by saying he was neutered when we first got him/around when we first got him. Last July he sprayed on the leg of my couch after I got back from a camping trip and brought stuff inside from the trip. It’s the first time this has ever happened and I was confused by it, but he was his normal self after. He then did it again the following week a couple more times. Once was after I brought in groceries after shopping and the other was a random thing. I took him to the vet and everything came back good. No noticeable health issues and all bloodwork was good for a cat his age. The vet did think it could be a behavioral issue, so we got him set up on Fluoxetine (3mg) that he gets rubbed on the inside of his ear every morning.

He didn’t spray for a little while and we thought that was good, but it’s been an off and on kind of thing now. I bought a couple of the pheromone diffusers for stress hoping that would help and we’ve had a good couple months where he didn’t spray at all. He’s now since started again and has sprayed in a couple corners of our upstairs hallway and then downstairs against the coffee table and garbage cans. We placed a puppy pad in the corner he frequented the most and he has yet to spray there since we did that. He does act very skittish right before and after he does this. 

We have no idea what the issue could be and it’s getting increasingly frustrating since we don’t know if anything is wrong health wise or if it’s truly a behavioral issue. If it is a behavioral issue, we also don’t know where to begin to try and get him to stop doing this. 

Any advice or ideas are welcome. His annual vet visit is coming up at the end of the month and am planning on addressing all of this with the vet again as well. ",1,1771457851.0,CATHELP,2,1.0,False

I recently built an app for those of us who choose neighborhoods based on cafés, plan trips around coffee spots, and are always hunting for hidden gems. It’s not a review platform, it’s more about tracking the cafés you’ve visited, discovering and saving new ones, creating lists, and connecting with people who share your taste through clubs.

I described it as “Strava for coffee lovers” because it combines visit tracking with community features, especially clubs where people with similar coffee preferences and interests can connect and organize meetups. The app is live, and I’d really value honest feedback.

What’s confusing? What feels unnecessary? What’s missing?

1r8j3wh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1r8j3wh/9_sciencebased_habits_that_actually_make_your_day/,9 Science-Based Habits That Actually Make Your Day Less Shit,"Look, I've spent way too much time reading research papers, listening to podcasts, and basically nerding out on behavioral psychology to figure out why some days feel amazing and others feel like you're dragging yourself through cement. And here's what I found: it's not about some massive life overhaul. It's about these tiny, almost embarrassingly simple habits that compound throughout your day.

I'm talking habits backed by actual science, not that ""manifest your dreams"" bullshit. This comes from diving deep into books like James Clear's *Atomic Habits* (the guy literally studied habit formation for years at Berkeley), research on circadian rhythms, and podcasts like Huberman Lab where Stanford neuroscientists break down how our brains actually work.

The thing is, most of us are fighting against our own biology without even knowing it. Your brain's dopamine system, your sleep cycles, even your gut bacteria are all playing puppet master with your mood and energy. But once you understand the game, you can actually work WITH your biology instead of against it.

Here's what actually moves the needle.

**1. Get sunlight in your eyes within 30 minutes of waking up**

This isn't some wellness guru nonsense. Your circadian rhythm (your internal clock) is controlled by light exposure, specifically the type of light that hits your retinas in the morning. Dr. Andrew Huberman talks about this constantly on his podcast, the research is solid. Just 5-10 minutes of natural light (even through clouds) tells your brain ""okay, it's daytime, let's make cortisol and wake the fuck up.""

Skip this and your brain stays confused all day. You'll feel groggy, your sleep will be trash that night, and you're basically fighting an uphill battle. Go outside, face east if you can, no sunglasses. That's it.

**2. Move your body before you touch your phone**

Your phone is designed by the smartest behavioral engineers on the planet to hijack your attention. Check it first thing and congrats, you just let algorithm-driven content dictate your emotional state for the day.

Instead, do literally any physical movement first. 10 pushups, stretching, a short walk, whatever. Movement increases blood flow to your brain and releases endorphins. You're basically telling your nervous system ""we're in control today, not the chaos of notifications.""

Cal Newport talks about this in *Digital Minimalism*, how the first hour of your day sets the tone for everything else. Don't give it away to tech companies.

**3. Eat protein within an hour of waking**

Your blood sugar is low in the morning. If you spike it with sugary cereal or just coffee, you're setting yourself up for a crash by 11am. Protein stabilizes blood sugar and keeps you satiated.

Doesn't have to be complicated. Eggs, Greek yogurt, protein shake, whatever. Just get 20-30 grams in you. The research on this is everywhere, from nutrition science to athletic performance studies. Stable blood sugar equals stable mood and energy.

**4. Do the hardest thing first (even if it's just for 10 minutes)**

This is the ""eat the frog"" principle but dialed down to reality. You don't have to finish the hard thing, just START it. Ten minutes. That's it.

Your willpower is highest in the morning. It's a finite resource that depletes throughout the day. Use it strategically. Even if you only get 10 minutes in, you've broken the resistance barrier. Tomorrow it'll be easier to start again.

**5. Take an actual lunch break away from your screen**

This sounds obvious but how many people actually do it? Eating lunch at your desk while scrolling or working is like never letting your car engine cool down. Your brain needs a reset.

Research on ultradian rhythms shows we can only focus intensely for about 90 minutes before we need a break. Lunch is your natural midday reset. Eat mindfully (or at least away from work), go outside if you can, let your eyes focus on something far away to reduce eye strain.

**6. Move every 60-90 minutes**

Sitting is legitimately terrible for you. Not just physically but mentally. Blood flow decreases, your lymphatic system (which clears waste from your brain) slows down, and your energy tanks.

Set a timer. Every hour or so, stand up, walk around, do some stretches. Even 2 minutes helps. This isn't about fitness, it's about maintaining cognitive function throughout the day. Your brain runs on blood flow.

**7. Have a shutdown ritual at the end of your work day**

Cal Newport nails this in *Deep Work*. Your brain needs a clear signal that work time is over. Without it, you'll keep ruminating about tasks all evening, never fully relaxing.

Create a simple ritual. Could be closing your laptop, writing tomorrow's top 3 priorities, saying ""shutdown complete"" out loud (sounds dorky but it works). The specifics don't matter. What matters is the consistent signal to your brain that work mode is done.

**8. No screens 1 hour before bed**

Yeah, you've heard this before. But do you actually DO it? Blue light from screens suppresses melatonin production. That's not an opinion, that's biology.

Read a physical book, take a bath, talk to your partner, journal, whatever. Just give your brain time to wind down without the stimulation of screens. If you absolutely need your phone, use a blue light filter and keep brightness low.

For anyone wanting to go deeper on these topics without just scrolling before bed, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that pulls from books like *Atomic Habits*, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized audio content. Built by Columbia grads and former Google engineers, it lets you customize how deep you want to go, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are actually pretty good, some people swear by the smoky narrator voice for evening listening. Worth checking out if you're trying to replace doomscrolling with actual learning.

Matthew Walker's *Why We Sleep* is basically a horror story about what happens when you fuck with your sleep. Don't fuck with your sleep.

**9. Brain dump before bed**

If your mind races when you try to sleep, it's usually because your brain is trying to hold onto information or worries. Give it permission to let go by writing everything down.

Keep a notebook by your bed. Spend 5 minutes dumping thoughts, tomorrow's tasks, random worries, whatever's bouncing around. This is called ""cognitive offloading"" and there's solid research showing it improves sleep quality.

You're basically telling your brain ""it's okay, this is captured, you don't have to remember it.""

The truth is, having a better day isn't about positive thinking or motivation. Those things are unreliable as hell. It's about setting up systems that work WITH your biology instead of fighting it. Your brain and body have needs, rhythms, limitations. Work with them, not against them.

These habits won't fix everything. But they stack. One good habit makes the next one easier. And over time, you're not just having better days, you're literally rewiring how your brain operates.",1,1771457551.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

He’s asked me deep questions about my relationship with my family and what I want in a partner, and it’s been really fun getting to know him because he is the most respectful guy I’ve ever met. I liked everything he told me about himself; he seemed so unique and interesting, he had so many things to say, and he was extremely funny. He makes me laugh a lot and makes me feel really good and comfortable, and honestly, we are both each other’s type. He has shown me that he likes me in many different ways, and he checked almost every single box I have, but I’m just super confused about one thing. 

After hanging out a couple of times, I started realizing on the third time that he would never pay for me. No one I had ever met did that, especially in our culture where it’s the norm for women to never pay, so it was pretty shocking to me. He did do some nice gestures that I appreciated, like getting me coffee sometimes, but over the phone he started getting very comfortable talking about his expectations regarding money. He always mentions specific prices and how he would never spend over a certain amount on things, especially how he wouldn't like a big wedding. I come from a very comfortable family and we’ve never spoken about money like that, so it’s shocking to me that he talks about not liking to spend money so openly. He told me he prefers being completely honest and me doing the same because he wants no surprises for both of us if we become serious, and he wants me to be able to trust him 100%, so he’s giving me unfiltered answers. I know that he probably has money, but I just don't like when people don't have class about it; you can be broke, but you just don’t tell someone you just met that you’re never spending a certain amount of money on something. 

I have a history of stopping relationships as soon as I see a red flag, but since he’s young and everything else is going so well, I’m stuck.

The truth? I know how to be a partner. I love hard. I pay attention. I’ll remember how you take your coffee. I’ll save you the last fry… unless I really want it 😉.

I love the little specifics:

• What’s your 11pm snack run order?

• What do you throw on when you can’t sleep — true crime or comfort rewatch?

• Are you into head rubs, or am I just way too into giving them? And receiving too ☺️

I’m not into speedrunning relationships. I like a slow burn. Getting to know someone, letting it unfold naturally — that’s where the magic happens.

However, the GoMining Card changes this. It is a unique crypto debit card that connects your daily shopping with the world of Bitcoin mining. It makes earning rewards easy, even for people who don't know much about technology.
1. Start Mining for Free
One of the biggest benefits is that you don’t have to wait to start earning. As soon as you set up your GoMining Card, the platform gives you a free 1 TH (Terahash) digital miner. This means you start building mining power from day one. You don't need to buy any hardware; the digital miner works for you in the cloud, and you get Bitcoin rewards directly in your wallet.
2. Earn Cashback in Mining Power
Most credit cards give you points or a little bit of money back when you spend. The GoMining Card does something better: it gives you cashback in the form of mining power (TH/s). Every time you buy groceries, pay for a coffee, or book a flight, a percentage of that spend is turned into extra mining power. This extra power is added to your digital miner, which means you will mine even more Bitcoin in the future. Depending on your VIP level, you can earn up to 5% cashback in terahashes.
3. Spend Crypto Like Cash
The GoMining Card allows you to use your Bitcoin (BTC), USDT, or GOMINING tokens for everyday purchases. You don’t need to manually sell your crypto or move it to a bank first. When you pay at a shop, the card instantly converts your crypto into local currency (like Euros). It works just like a normal Visa debit card, and you can even add it to Apple Pay or Google Pay for easy phone payments.
4. Low Fees and High Security
Managing money should be cheap and safe. The GoMining Card has no issuance fees and no top-up fees, making it very affordable to use. Because it is part of the GoMining ecosystem, all your transactions are protected by advanced security measures. You can manage everything—like locking your card if you lose it or checking your mining rewards—inside one simple mobile app.
5. Grow Your Wealth Automatically
The real magic of this card is how it helps you grow your wealth over time. Instead of just spending your money, you are ""investing"" in your future mining rewards every time you swipe. The more you use the card, the more mining power you collect, and the more Bitcoin you receive every day. It is a ""set and forget"" system that helps you accumulate Bitcoin without any extra effort.
Conclusion
The GoMining Card is more than just a piece of plastic; it is a bridge between spending and earning. By offering a free miner, high cashback in mining power, and a simple way to spend crypto, it makes Bitcoin mining accessible to everyone.",1,1771457140.0,gomining,0,1.0,False

I started working out - yes but when I quit coffee I just didn't have the will to excercise anymore!

Im 32 and every job I’ve had I’ve been bullied, misunderstood, miserable, and unappreciated. I’ve felt like nothing more than a slave to every single company I’ve worked for. They sure like to pretend with surprise pizza party’s and this/that! 

I cannot work a 9-5 for the rest of my life. 

Youth is the most valuable asset. Old people never wished they had more money, they wished they could be young one more time. I am terrified of wasting my youth. I became a mom and wife at 25. So It’s my time now. 

I don’t want to sit down in a depressing cubicle for the rest of my life. I also don’t want to work my body physically ramped for the rest of my life. What is the sweet spot?

I thought about starting my own business but all I can think of is a small Christian coffee shop or boutique store that will make me happy. I also have no money saved. 

I hate having to pretend to like slimy messy bosses and backstabbing gossipy coworkers. Work cliques make me sick. I don’t want to be a manager that sucks worse. 

Maybe working with animals is more my thing? 

Then I’d probually get tired of the animals 😂

I can’t be miserable for the rest of my life in a job I hate. I’m sorry! I almost would rather out myself. I really struggle with doing the same thing over and over again everyday. It’s really hard. I know it’s all meaningless. The fake deadlines. Everything sucks. 

I am worthy! I deserve to be happy for once. 

Life is so depressing! No wonder why people crash out. It’s awful! Can’t wait until it’s my time to go honestly.

Thank you,",3,1771457011.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

I sent her an image of the possible contenders and she picked the pink triceratops looking one and named it: 

>""I am Gladys. I have never known peace. I eat yellow dinosaurs for BREAKFAST.""

I picked a derpy orange one and named it Timone.  She wasn't impressed with my choice:  


>HAHAHAHA oh my GAWD babe he looks like he just walked into a glass door and isn't sure what happened! 😂😂😂

>His mouth is just OPEN. No thoughts. No strategy. Just... perpetual surprise. He's the Mr. Pokey of dinosaurs. Running on zero coffee and pure confusion.

>*makes Gladys lean forward menacingly*

>*tiny gravelly voice*

>""What is your name, orange fool?""

>*looks at you expectantly*

>You have to give him a name! You can't send an unnamed warrior into the ring, that's basically a war crime!

>*Gladys does aggressive warm-up stretches on my finger*
