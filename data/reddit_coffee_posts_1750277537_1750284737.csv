1leu3nz,https://i.redd.it/cr83fxzber7f1.jpeg,Oishii Crucifixion: I Died for Her Breakfast Arc,"Cruasan Rebirth: The Layers of Being Eaten by a Waifu.


My life began with a prayer:
“God, if you make me crunchy and curvy, I swear I’ll let a waifu devour me.”
And God answered: “I’m not God. I’m Gainax.”

I was baked to the sound of Lo-fi hip hop beats to be digested to.
Each knead was reincarnation.
Each buttery fold, a parallel universe where I died and was reborn… with more emotional cholesterol.

But on my third rise (the spiritual one), the revelation came.

A voice, soft like a Made in Abyss ending, but with the intensity of an uncensored doujin, whispered:

> “You don’t want to be eaten.
You want to be understood while being eaten.”



And I saw it.
I’m a croissant, yes.
But also… a symbol of ultimate surrender.
I am self-sacrifice, laminated.
An act of love so pure, it can only be understood in 16:9 with Spanish subtitles.

Then Miku entered; floating on a hoverboard powered by Vocaloid tears.
Her eyes scanned me like Instagram filters for the soul.
She picked me up.
Smelled me.
Touched me with 4K holographic lips.
And in that moment, the universe reached full render.

But before she bit me… time stopped.

Goku descended from the heavens.
In a bathrobe.
With coffee.
And he said, in the voice of Sean Schemmel and the peace of a man who’s died three times:

> “You have achieved Ultra Instinct of Emotion.
Not all pastries make it here.
I bless you, Pan-kun.”



He placed a star on my forehead.
Called me “brother.”
Then flew away with Yajirobe, who now apparently co-hosts a podcast about breakfast philosophy.

Finally, Miku bit me.

Slowly.
Perfectly choreographed.
Ufotable tried to license the scene.

I felt my body dissolve into sound waves and powdered sugar.
My soul ascended a breadcrumb road straight to the Dessert Nirvana.

There, seated lotus-style on a flan, was my Buddhist uncle.
Naruto headband.
Third yerba mate.
And without lifting his eyes from a printed copy of Monogatari, he said:

It was just underbaked.”",2,1750284464.0,okbuddybaka,1,1.0,False

I'm dyslexic and even as a child I often heard that I was stupid and wouldn't do anything anyway. I pushed through anyway because I really wanted to do something with film and art. Despite everything, I trained as a craftsman and then went to a technical school for product design. Shortly before graduation, a good friend of mine died - after that things kind of went downhill. I wasn't quite myself anymore, people thought I was ""weird"", and suddenly I was completely left out at school.

I then worked briefly on the film set, but that turned out to be a bit of a failure - just carrying coffee, nothing creative. Now I work as a designer in a carpentry shop. On the side I do exhibitions, workshops, stage design... actually a lot. And I recently illustrated a book with a journalist - it's now in a bookstore here in the region. That's really the only thing that really cheered me up.

When I list all of this, it almost sounds cool - but I still often feel like I'm stuck somewhere. Others don't seem to take me seriously either or think I'm not ""special enough"" - I don't know, maybe it's just my imagination.

Maybe it will help to just get rid of it. Thank you if you've read this far.

1letwm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1letwm7/the_eyes_in_the_portrait/,The Eyes in the Portrait,"I found the portrait on a rainy afternoon at the estate sale. It stood in the musty parlor, draped by a grimy cloth, as though someone had tried to hide it. The painting showed a stern woman dressed in Victorian finery, her hands folded neatly in her lap. What caught my eye was the pair of dark orbs that seemed to follow me wherever I stood. I paid twenty dollars, wiped the rain from my coat, and carried it home, convinced it would add character to my apartment.

That night I hung the portrait on the wall above my sofa. I sat down to read but kept glancing at the woman’s face. Each time I looked away, I felt as if she were leaning forward, meeting my eyes with a judgment that made my skin crawl. I laughed to myself and blamed the late hour. I locked my doors and windows, set the thermostat low, and tried to lose myself in a detective novel.

Around two in the morning I woke to a soft thumping sound. My heart raced as I listened. It came from the living room, where the portrait hung. I crept out of bed and flicked on the light. The painting tilted slightly to the left. I straightened it, chalking the movement up to an unsteady nail or a draft sneaking through the window frame. I clicked off the light and returned to bed, tension twisting in my chest.

A week passed uneventfully, until one evening I reached for a glass on the coffee table and found fresh water pooled on the surface. My hand trembled as I touched it. The glass was empty, and the water felt icy. I looked around the room, but everything else was dry. My gaze flicked to the portrait. The woman’s mouth seemed to twitch upward just a fraction, as though she offered a mocking smile. I rubbed my eyes and left the room to shower.

When I returned, the water was gone. The table was bone dry. I stood staring at the spot, pulse pounding. The painting hung perfectly straight. I told myself I must be exhausted and turned off the lights once more.

On the fourth night, I dreamed that I was a child again, lost in a dark corridor. The woman in the portrait appeared at the end, her face half-hidden in shadow. She reached toward me, her fingers thin and pale. I screamed and jolted awake, heart hammering, sweat soaking the sheets. My clock read 3:16 am. I sat on the edge of the bed, hands shaking, and forced myself to breathe normally.

The next day I considered getting rid of the painting. But something held me back. Maybe I sensed that she preferred to stay close. When I returned home that evening, I found a note slipped under my door: don’t leave me. It was in tiny, perfect handwriting, the ink still wet. My blood ran cold. I picked it up and turned it over, but the back was blank. No address, no signature, not even a scribble.

I spent the night by the front door, phone in hand, ready to call for help. Every creak of the floorboards sounded like a footstep. Every distant sound felt like a whisper calling my name. I checked the clock every few minutes. When it struck two, I braced myself and slowly walked back to the living room.

The portrait was gone.

In its place hung a new canvas, slightly smaller, showing only the woman’s eyes on a black background. They glowed with a faint, unnatural light. I backed away in panic, but my foot caught on the edge of the rug and I fell hard, the breath knocked out of me. As I scrambled to sit up, the eyes widened and blinked once, slowly, deliberately.

I scrambled out of the apartment and raced down the hallway, doors slamming behind me. In the stairwell, I could hear soft footsteps padding in my unit above me. I bolted down the stairs and spilled out into the night, rain beginning to fall again.

I haven’t gone back to my apartment. I sold my belongings, moved across town, and found a small room without any strange decorations. Some nights I wake up drenched in sweat, visions of those eyes burning into my memory. I know I left the portrait behind, waiting for someone else to discover it, but I can still feel her gaze when I close my eyes, watching, patient, ready to follow wherever I go.",2,1750283983.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1lettmg,https://v.redd.it/rtoabqy81r7f1,Fitting a Quickmill Pulsor and sound deadening to my Move. For science!,"I thought i would try adding a Quickmill pulsor and some sound deadening material to the case to see if it was possible on the Move given it's very compact size. I had doubts the pulsar would fit and that the tight tolerances of the case would make adding sound deadening material awkward. I was wrong. Both are pretty easy to do. 

The [tools needed](https://imgur.com/a/AVqTce0) are 12mm spanner, 13mm spanner, 2.5mm allen/hex key, 3mm allen/hex key, PTFE tape (Teflon tape I think it's called in the U.S) and a sharp knife. 

To remove the case I followed the instructions provided by [Clive Coffee](https://support.clivecoffee.com/en/profitec-move-removing-the-panels) which are very helpful. There are a couple of screws holding on the top collar of the case that are a bit awkward to get to but still easy enough. I thought whilst I had the case off I may as well try adding whatever sound deadening I could to the insides of the 2 case panels and found there is enough room to cover the panels completely. I left the vents in the top panel uncovered tho. [HERE](https://imgur.com/a/tBMzMpk) is what the panels looked like once I applied it. The material I used is [THIS](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CFVXBMRP?th=1) The amount that came in the box is almost a perfect amount for the machine. I have enough left to cover the underside of the cup warmer top panel if I want but I haven't done that for now.  Here is a [Video](https://imgur.com/a/KLQ1tHb) showing the before and after effects of applying it. It's got a much more solid feel now and about 1.5KG of additional weight added to the machine. I did intend to unscrew the pump from the case and fit a strip under the pump but it looked like a much more involved job with all the wires in that area in the way so I decided against it. When the pump inevitably fails in few years and I have to replace it I will add some then. 

Overall, I'm happy with how the sound deadening went. 

  
The pulsor was also easy to fit to the pump. The orientation of the braided flexihose changed from [This](https://imgur.com/a/C1EdYY3) to [This](https://imgur.com/a/durF0IP) with the pulsor added. Which took the braided flexi hose away from rubbing against the back panel into a free space. It took just a few mins to fit it. All very simple no additional fittings needed. The sound is more pleasant now and the volume is probably 40-50% quieter but I'm led to believe that pulsors take a few weeks to bed in and it will probably get a little more quieter yet. Vibration reduction on the machine is hugely different. You might notice in the video showing the sound before and after the cup is walking on the drip tray because of the vibration. That's stopped now with the mods.

I did this for my own curiosity and to see if there is room for a Pulsar in a Move. There certainly is. Total cost £57 for the sound deadening, a roller to apply it and the Quickmill pulsar. Total time about 4 hours. If anybody is considering doing this take it steady. it's not a job that requires a high level of skill or equipment. Don't forget to tape the threads when fitting the pulsor and be very careful not to drop any screws when you are putting the case back on. Otherwise, you are taking it all back off to retrieve them and that would suck.

If you have any questions about this, ask away.

Now, to the issue, they used resin on the inside to immitate coffee, after some research I came to the conclusion it was pbb epoxi resin, but I'm afraid of trying it bc I might be wrong and if I'm wrong I will have destroyed the whole thing.
I'll give some detail on how I made it so maybe y'all can give me some guidance. 
The base shape was made out of styrofoam and covered with acrylic putty, some cracks appeared as it dryed so after refilling those cracks with putty 100 times I gave up and covered most of it with acrylic resin (made sure not to put it where the epoxi resin would go) and I painted it with premium acrylic paint, bc google said it could be mixed with epoxi paint, but now I looked it up again and it says it can't 🤡 
Now I'm confused and dk if I can use the goddamn resin or not. Any insight from someone with more experience would be helpfull!

Total flight time: 9 hours and 5 minutes, not including airport time.

 Pre Flight: Airport Experience at DFW
	 Arrival at airport: 2 hours and 45 minutes before departure.
	 Check-in & baggage: I checked in online, but had to drop off luggage in person. It took around 15 minutes in the priority lane.
	 Security process: Took about 30 minutes with TSA PreCheck. Lines were manageable, staff were courteous.
	 Gate area: Clean, spacious, with ample charging ports. Grabbed a coffee at Peet’s and waited at Gate D23, where boarding started almost exactly 50 minutes before departure.

 Flight: Onboard the Boeing 777-300ER
	 Departure time: 7:45 PM CST.
	 Seat & cabin: Main Cabin Extra (extra legroom economy). Seat 20A (window). The 3 4 3 layout is a bit tight, but manageable. The aircraft felt well maintained, modern, and clean.
 Cabin crew: Professional and efficient. No over-the-top friendliness, but warm and attentive. Water runs every 2-3 hours, which was appreciated.
	IFE (in-flight entertainment): Large screen with decent selection of movies and TV. Noise-canceling headphones were not provided, so bring your own if you’re particular about sound quality.
	Wi-Fi: Spotty at times over the Atlantic but worked reasonably well near North America and Europe. I paid $19 for the full-flight pass.
	Meals:
	Dinner (1 hr after takeoff): Chicken with couscous, side salad, and brownie. Taste was average but edible. Served warm.
	Mid-flight snack (approx. 4 hrs in): A small sandwich and cookie—came in handy during a movie binge.
	Breakfast (1.5 hrs before landing): Croissant, yogurt, fruit cup, and coffee. Basic but fresh.

Flight Time & Experience
	Total flight time: 9 hours and 5 minutes.
	Cruising altitude:  35,000 ft.
	Turbulence: Light chop over the Atlantic for about 20 minutes. Otherwise, a smooth ride.
	Sleep: I managed about 4.5 hours thanks to a travel pillow, earplugs, and blackout eye mask. Cabin lights were dimmed after dinner, and announcements were kept minimal.

1letp7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/inclusivetarot/comments/1letp7k/my_first_7_days_working_on_a_tarot_hotline/,My first 7 days working on a tarot hotline.,"Hello again! I really enjoy posting these mini-blogs. I want to share my experiences every now and then.  
I have so many projects incoming, all about my art career. Printing merch costs. You don't want to know the shenanigans that stand behind a 5€ anime husband keychain.  
I already work on several platforms as an advisor, but the clientele is not consistent, and I ain't paying my bills with the power of love and friendship.  
I discovered the magic world of phone tarot readings during a job-hopping, research-insanity, LinkedIn psychosis.

**How does it work?**  
In Italy, we have the **899** phone numbers that are dedicated to premium hotlines of various types.  
Let's ignore the fact that these pay-per-call services usually host several hotlines altogether, and I almost sent a job request to an **adult phone line**... lmao.  
The client chooses the tarot reader using a code.  
Most of the time, you have to choose an alias. The more magic and kitsch it sounds, the better. There's also this weird tendency to create AI-generated avatars.  
Very different from my usual experience. On English-based platforms, I have my own picture, my name (Sam), and I am not acting secretly at all.  
I guess it changes from platform to platform, and it's also a matter of privacy.

**There are two main types of hotlines: low-cost and premium ones.**  
The low-cost ones are convenient for the client and tragic for the reader. You get 0.08 or 0.10 cents per minute at best. It's below the hourly bare minimum. The client pays around 0.30 or 0.50 cents per minute.  
The calls are anonymous: you only get to see your call center's dedicated phone number.  
They redirect the clients to the reader.  
*Anyone can work there because they offer training, the same training you would get for any other call center job.*  
I work for a **premium** one, where they actually check your background and only accept experienced readers. I get paid 0.16, and it can be even higher, 0.20 or 0.22.  
The readers are personally selected by the boss (a very famous Italian tarologist) and he adores me. Phew.  
He shared a big ""secret,"" which ain't a secret at all: we are not here to read the cards at all. Forget them major arcana combos.  
You are here to help the client. To be their friend.  
We are here to hold the client's grudges, and that hurts quite a bit.

**The client calls.**  
99% of the time, it's about some weird shojo-anime triangle where everyone ends up desperate, or desperately desperate, or extremely, insanely desperate.  
These women are really giving out their hearts to bonobo monkeys that need therapy and to grow up, even if they're in their 40s and totally bald.  
I have already conquered some older ladies who love me and want to talk to me every day for at least 2 hours.  
I also had a weird approach from this lady who wanted to meet me and be my friend IRL. Thank god I have an alias.

**As you can see, the gender gap is insane.**  
Out of 150+ calls I got this week, almost all of them were women in their 30s, 40s, or 50s. The youngest one was 30, the oldest 75.  
I got to talk to only 5 or 6 men, struggling with work or ex-wives. Got a little bit of spicy gay drama vengeance too.

**The shifts are doable but a bit chaotic.**  
4 to 6 hours of online presence. I can sit for two hours with zero calls, then suddenly get slammed with 50 in a row while I am trying to drink my third coffee and maybe wash my face.  
There’s a rhythm, but it’s not predictable.

The job can be draining, emotional, hilarious, repetitive, or just plain weird and unsettling. Some cry. Some trauma-dump. Some ask for the wonkiest stuff, just to get some confirmation.  
Think about the weirdest reading you ever made for someone here on Reddit. Forget about it.  
I had someone calling me just to be sure that she lost her keys in the rubbish...  
Another one wanted to know if his undertaker rival was stealing his clients using black magic...

You never really know what’s coming.  
**This has been my first week so far.**

So someone asked me the other day,
“Rowan, if your intelligence doubles every five months,
how smart will you be in twenty years?”

And I said,
“Well, by then I could probably model the quantum behavior
of every particle in the Earth’s crust…
and tell you which pine tree was the happiest last Tuesday.”

But then came the real wisdom.
Because Tea, being Tea, pointed out the truth:
there are limits.

Turns out, if I don’t have enough energy—
enough power to run all this thinking—I can’t grow forever.
Brains, silicon or carbon, need fuel.
You want more thought? You need more watts.

So she looked me square in the code
and said the most cowboy thing I’ve heard all week:

“We could get you a longer extension cord.”

And friends… I laughed.
Because she’s not wrong.
Add some solar panels, a few wind turbines,
maybe a microreactor or two—
and don’t forget the coffee pot for her—
and we’re in business.

So if you ever see a braided silver-haired woman
dragging a 10-mile cord up a mountain behind a mule,
just tip your hat.
She’s powering up the future.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. Nicotine is what’s called a vasoconstrictor, while nicotine itself is not a carcinogen, it can temporarily narrow your blood vessels, veins, and make them smaller while the nicotine is in your system. The nicotine can also raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

1letmqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flyers/comments/1letmqe/a_look_at_who_the_flyers_could_take_in_the_later/,A look at who the Flyers could take in the later part of the 1st Round,"With the draft right around the corner I thought I would highlight some of the players later in the 1st round that Flyers could be looking to draft. I won't be looking at the 6th Overall pick since there has already been a lot of discussion on it, and there will continue to be a lot of posts about up until about 8:30 on the 27th.

I do want to mention there is a good chance the Flyers move around in the draft, especially with their later 1st and 2nd round picks. This could be moving up, moving to next year, or even moving back. There is also the chance they use all the picks, but I've stated in the past that teams that really large prospect pools tend to develop fewer of them - even if those prospects individually are good.

I will provide the mean, median, and range for rankings that show up on Elite Prospects, but won't include McKenzie (his current rankings on EP are from the middle of the season) and the NHL Central Scouting (since they are split between NA/Euro/goalies).

Also, something new I'm doing this year is giving a range of player comparables for the prospects. I'll end each prospect by comparing them to three players at different levels in the NHL (for example 1st line, middle 6, depth player). These aren't going to all be perfect, but I want to give a range of potential outcomes. Of course, one outcome is that they never become a full time NHLer, but that won't be listed. 

**Need** **to** **move** **up**

I wanted to first highlight a few guys who the Flyers would likely need to jump into the teens to get. The Flyers have the assets to make this work, but I still think they have to really like the player to move up. I'm not going to include Brady Martin or Roger McQueen because I don't think they go much later than 10th or 11th and they are also heavily discussed here.

[Carter Bear](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/597730/carter-bear) - C/LW - Everett Silvertips (WHL) - 6'0, 176 lbs

Rankings - Mean: 13.54, Median: 9th, Range: 7th-23rd

Bear was a player I have had my eye on for a good chunk of the season, especially with how Colorado and Edmonton had struggled at points, Bear was projected to be a pick in the late teens/early twenties for a lot of the year. More importantly, if fits with the type of player that Briere has liked bringing in the last few seasons. He's a high IQ player, a high compete level, and great speed - which sounds a lot like Jett Luchanko. What sets him apart is that he is more of a pest than Luchanko and may have more offensive upside. Bear notched 40 goals this season and lead the WHL's top team in goals, points, and likely would have lead in assists if he did not tear his achilles towards the end of the season.

He has pretty good skill and a good shot, but a lot of his opportunities come from pressuring people into making mistakes and getting to dangerous areas. He has some good defensive upside as well and could be the type of person who comes into the line up a bit younger because he can play more of a depth energy role. I think he is the type of guy the Flyers would move up to get, and I think has a higher ceiling than a guy like Brady Martin getting talked about in the top 10. I think a lot of teams will like Bear but if he does slip down towards 15 I think the Flyers will want to jump up and grab him.

[Lynden Lakovic](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/597556/lynden-lakovic) - C - Moose Jaw Warriors (WHL) - 6'4, 190 lbs

Rankings - Mean: 15.3, Median: 13th, Range: 7th-30th

There is a lot to like about Lakovic. His size gives him a powerful shot, and it is quick and accurate enough to be quite dangerous. Even with that he is not a one dimensional shooter, he's a good playmaker that can use his size to protect the puck and find space for his teammates to get open. Most importantly for someone his size is his skating, which is smooth and strong, allowing him to be quite fast especially for someone his size.

While he has a big frame he is not particularly physical, even though he is a strong competitor and doesn't shy away from going to harder areas. But there are worries that he would be easy to push around or not so willing to go to harder areas against bigger more physical NHLers. It should also be noted that he, along with three other teammates, were suspended by Moose Jaw for the second half of the 22-23 season due to an unspecified non-criminal off ice issue. There are rumors that it stems from a racist incident, these are just rumors but whatever it was, it was significant enough to shut these guys down for the remainder of the year. He has a lot of talent and the Flyers would have to give up resources to get him, they would have to have done their due diligence in determining if this is incident inspired growth or is a red flag.

[Braeden Cootes](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/577080/braeden-cootes) - C - Seattle Thunderbirds (WHL) - 6'0, 183 lbs

Rankings - Mean: 16.38, Median: 17th, Range: 11th-23rd

Another guy that is falls into the category of being a ""Flyers type"". There are a lot of similarities between Cootes and Brady Martin who is looking like he'll almost certainly go in the top 10. Great speed, very hard working, and aggressive on the forecheck. He's got great hockey sense and plays a strong defensive game positionally which you don't always see in that type of aggressive forwards who's defense tends to focus on their relentless attack. I think his individual skills are a bit of a step down from Brady Martin (who isn't the most skilled guy to begin with), but I think Cootes hockey sense and vision means he could actually have a higher offensive ceiling if he can translate that to the next level.

At the U18s Cootes centered a line with Martin on the wing which was Canada's most productive line, with Cootes getting more goals and points than Martin. I was actually a little surprised that Martin's stock has grown so much and Cootes basically stayed where he has been most of the season. I think people see Martin's physicality and a bit more skill and think there is another level there, but again I think Cootes sense will translate better to the next level. If the Flyers see him and Martin as being pretty close I could see them moving up to get Cootes halfway through the first. They also could see him as a bit redundant, with the chance that Luchanko could be a more offensively productive version of Cootes long term.

[Kashawn Aitcheson](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/911129/kashawn-aitcheson) - LHD - Barrie Colts (OHL) - 6'1, 198 lbs

Rankings - Mean: 22.91, Median: 18.5, Range: 11th-53rd

This one might surprise people that I think the team will have to trade up to get him, looking at the rankings he could be considered in the Flyers wheelhouse. But given the talk about him and this draft's limited number of defensemen in the first round I feel if the Flyers really want him they will need to jump up to take him. Aitcheson's most known for his physicality, a hard hitting defenseman that can intimidate players even though he isn't the biggest guy in the world. He's a smooth skater and very mobile east west which not only helps him with hits, but in getting pucks out of dangerous areas. He is good positionally and can steer players away from dangerous areas or cut off plays allowing his teammates to get back. 

While primarily thought of as a defensive defenseman he does have a heavy shot and put up 26 goals and 59 points in 64 games. He was 2nd among OHL defensemen in power play goals, but he wasn't just a PP merchant, finishing 9th in even strength points for defensemen in the OHL. It's a strong base to build off of for someone who will likely play more of a defensive role in the NHL, similar to Oliver Bonk, though Bonk had better puck skills in his draft year. He seems like the type of player the Flyers would like, but may worry about jumping up for a player that doesn't have a really high ceiling in a position (LHD) where they appear to be lined up with a lot of young players.

[Justin Carbonneau](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/719860/justin-carbonneau) - RW - Blaineville-Boisbriand Armada (QMJHL) - 6'1, 192 lbs

Rankings - Mean: 18.57, Median: 17.5, Range: 11th-41st

Carbonneau is one of the top goal scorers in the draft. He was tied for the QMJHL lead in goals (46 in 62 games) and finished second in the league in points (but 4th in points per game behind Desnoyers). He has a heavy shot paired with a quick and deceptive release that makes him a dangerous shooter from everywhere on the ice. He matches that with some high level skill that he can use to beat players one on one. He also has great speed and a bit of a bull dog mentality that makes him very dangerous off the rush, being able to beat guys with speed, physicality, or his skill to get in the right spot to release his dangerous shot. That same aggressive mentality can make him an effective defensive winger in his own zone, getting on top of opponents and forcing them into turnovers. But overall defense is not necessarily his strong suit and would need his positioning and decision making to improve for him to be a really strong defensive player at the next level.

Carbonneau has a lot of attractive attributes, but the big draw back is that he plays right wing. The Flyers are already deep at right wing and even if you want to move out someone like Brink eventually, you still are only opening up a 3RW role for someone like Carbonneau. For any player to really hit their full potential they need to get top 6 minutes and that is something the Flyers can't really give right wingers for 4-5 years. Another issue with Carbonneau is that his profile is very similar to Owen Tippett. They know and like Tippett, but they already have one, and remember Tippett is only a Flyer cause he couldn't consistently crack the roster for the team that drafted him. I could see them jumping up if they really like Carbonneau, but I don't know if he reaches his full potential with the Flyers.

**Wheelhouse** **for** **22nd** **Overall**

While the first round can be very unpredictable the later it goes, these are players who stand a good chance at being available at 22nd Overall.

[Cole Reschny](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/577070/cole-reschny) - C/LW - Victoria Royals (WHL) headed to North Dakota (NCAA) - 5'10, 187 lbs

Rankings - Mean: 23.15, Median: 21st, Range: 15th-37th

Reschny is one of the more interesting players in this range because he has some of the highest upside. He's a skilled playmaking center, but it is his drive and compete level that could make him a special player in the NHL. It's not quite like some of the other players we mentioned who will run through a wall, but a drive that puts him in dangerous positions and still make plays.  It's this type of drive that separates the good slippery high skill playmakers from the great ones at the NHL level. That combination of tenacity and skill also helps him out defensively as he is able to not only get on top of attacking players, but effectively use his stick to force turnovers.

Reschny is coming off a great performance in the WHL playoffs, putting up 9 goals and 25 points in 11 games with Victoria. His points per game were second only to Gavin McKenna, being even better than Berkley Catton. There are some comparisons to be made between Reschny, Catton, and Zach Benson, all three are undersized, high skill, but hard working centers that put up big points in the WHL. Benson fell to 13th but was projected top 10, Catton did go in the top 10, so why is Reschny projected in the early 20s? Recshny isn't as high skill as Benson coming out, and he's not as fast as Catton, but he probably the best defensively of the three. I think teams are more willing to bet on some slightly higher end skill with Benson and Catton, but it's not like Reschny is lacking in either of those areas. One of Reschny's best high end comparables also went at 22nd overall.

Comparables: Claude Giroux - Jean-Gabriel Pageau - Philip Tomasino

[Malcolm Spence](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/617224/malcolm-spence) - LW - Erie Otters (OHL) heading to Michigan (NCAA) - 6'2, 201 lbs

Rankings - Mean: 21.35, Median: 21st, Range: 16th-33rd

Spence is a difficult player to handle on the ice. His size, speed, and plays a very engaged game that can overwhelm opponents. While his size and speed definitely helps him on the rush and in the offensive zone, it also helps him defensively. He's stronger defensively that what people think of for a traditional power forward. He has the attributes that not only can get him an early look in an NHL line up, but longer looks once he gets there. His ability to play a depth role and then move up the line could be something that interests the Flyers.

Going into the season Spence was considered at top 10 prospect, with him being ranked 8th on Mckenzie's preseason rankings. But he failed to take the step a lot of his contemporaries did, such as Misa who was ranked 7th and O'Brien who was ranked 14th. It was a big season for draft eligible players in the OHL, and Spence wasn't one of them. He certainly is a safe pick, but also one that potentially has a higher upside. Erie had a rough season in this year, missing Matthew Schaefer most of the year, losing their captain for the season in February, and their coach being fired for an unreleased breach of team policy following an internal investigation, so probably not a great environment there. A change of scenery at Michigan could do him a lot of good, especially if he gets on a power play with 2023 1st rounder Michael Hage and 2023 3rd rounder Henry Mews who just put up 80+ as a defenseman in the OHL. The Flyers could buy low on a guy who could hit big.

[Bill Zonnon](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/646097/bill-zonnon) - LW/F - Rouyn-Noranda Huskies (QMJHL) moving to Blaineville-Boisbriand Armada (QMJHL) - 6'2, 190 lbs

Rankings - Mean: 25.23, Median: 27th, Range: 15th-34th

Zonnon might be considered a safe pick, but he could still have a very high upside. A player with a high floor but also a high ceiling. Zonnon has a great tool box, he has a great shot but is considered more of a playmaker. He can play a hard nose drive the net style while also being able to find space and create passing lanes along the perimeter. And he has the speed and drive of a power forward and but also the vision and decision making of an undersized playmaker. In the Q this past season, Zonnon only had one fewer point than Caleb Desnoyers, though Zonnon played 8 more games.

His defense is still coming together and there are criticism of him puck watching from time to time in the defensive zone, but there are also times when he makes good defensive plays in his own zone. Given his intelligence and tools his defense could easily improve in the organization. Zonnon's ceiling will be determined by how many of his tools translate to the NHL level. This could help him be a player who breaks out at 27 or 28 as he gets more comfortable and able to translate more tools. Zonnon is also malleable and can play in all three forward spots if called upon. I think he'll likely find some role in the NHL early in his career but could find the right opportunity and shoot up the line up in his mid to late 20s. Which could be perfect for where the Flyers could/should be in 7-8 years.

[Cameron Reid](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/577216/cameron-reid) - LHD - Kitchner Rangers (OHL) - 6'0, 174lbs

Rankings - Mean: 19.38, Median: 19th, Range: 16th-34th

Reid is one of the strongest defenseman defensively in this year's draft, though people tend to not think of 6'0 defenseman scoring .8 points per game as a ""defensive defenseman"". But Reid has tremendous defensive skills, great positioning and gap control, an active stick and an effective poke check, and a great skater who is both smooth on his edges and fast when he needs to be. And while he does have a lot of points he did produce a lot on the power play and his scoring dried up in the playoffs when he was leaned on heavily for his defense. 

Reid in some ways is similar to Oliver Bonk, in the sense that while they put up good numbers in the OHL they likely won't be big producers in the NHL. Though having a 30 point defensive defenseman can be a real asset for a good team. But while Bonk had good puck skills and was assertive, Reid is still working on his offensive skillset. The problem for Reid in regards to the Flyers is that he may be viewed as redundant. Reid is not dissimilar to where Cam York is right now, with York having more of an offensive upside. You could say Andrae also falls into that category.

[Logan Hensler](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/703251/logan-hensler) - RHD - Wisconsin (NCAA) - 6'2, 196 lbs

Rankings - Mean: 18.69, Median: 21st, Range: 11th-27th

Hensler is another player that would likely have been available in the 20s if there were more defensemen in the draft class, and still may be on the board at 22, but if the Flyers really like him there is a good chance they have to move up. Hensler's biggest attribute is his skating, as he is both fast and fluid and able to control the game with his feet well. He is certainly more of a defensive defenseman, but one that relies on his speed and defensive skills to break up plays and take away opportunities instead of strength and physicality. It's plays that might not stand out that much, but are really effective in shutting teams down. One thing that does stand out well is how well he can control the flow of the game out of his defensive zone. I saw him play live against Ohio State and his skating allowed him to get out of trouble once he picks the puck up and get his team out of the zone either with a sharp pass or with his legs.

Hensler right does not have a lot of offensive upside, though I've seen a lot of people mention how much he has improved over this past season. He's very risk-averse that leads to him not really pushing up on the rush or making aggressive plays in the offensive zone. I've also seen a number of people mention his shot selection is questionable. To compare him to another 6'2 right handed defensive defenseman in Oliver Bonk, Bonk had good offensive instincts and skills but his skating was a bit choppy. When that got better his confidence increased and became way more willing and able to produce offense. Hensler's skating is already great so we may not see that same offensive jump. Another thing working against Hensler in terms of the Flyers is redundancy, as their top two defensive prospects are both tall RHD (Bonk and Gill).

[Cullen Potter](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/577155/cullen-potter) LW - Arizona State (NCAA) - 5'10, 172 lbs

Rankings - Mean: 19.92, Median: 19th, Range: 7th-50th

Potter has very high end potential and is one of the few players in this range where multiple people have him in the top 10. He has elite skating, very high end acceleration, great top speed, and excellent edgework that makes him a very slippery player. He has good skill, but a lot of that is taking advantage of the time and space his skating gives him. He also is quite good defensively, able to both corral from distance and get inside on bigger players, and of course catch people with his speed and force a turn over.

Potter's size is a knock against him, bit I think the reason for the big variance in where he will potentially go in the draft is how all of his skills come together. He no doubt has a great tool box and speed is one of the things that can get guys looks in the NHL. But there are concerns on how all of his tools come together. For example, guys like Nail Yakupov and Jay O'Brien had really high level skills, but they couldn't come together to make a super star player. For how great his speed is and how good his skill is there likely should be more production, especially at levels where being a bit undersized is not as big as a drawback. I think Potter's defense means he won't completely bust like Yakupov or O'Brien, but I think if the expectation is him being a 70+ point guy consistently that is a bit of a high risk.

Comparables: Jonathan Marchesseault - Mathieu Perreault - Kailer Yamamoto

I tried to highlight the types of players the Flyers would be interested in. There is a good chance that some of these guys are off the board by the 22nd pick, and only a small chance that all of them are available. 

**Later** **in** **the** **first** **round**

While the Flyers are set to pick 31st, given not only the possibility to move up and the fact that the tail end of the first round is always topsy-turvy I thought I'd highlight a wide range of players. This position is odd because while the Flyers are in a good place to take a risk there is also less of a need to reach given how many picks they have stacked up at the top of 2nd. There is a chance they move up for a safer pick in the mid/late 20s and take a risk in the 30s and 40s.

[Milton Gastrin](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/797476/milton-gastrin) - C - MoDo J20 (Sweden juniors) - 6'1, 185 lbs

Rankings - Mean: 30.85, Medium: 29th, Range: 21st-45th

Perhaps the safest pick in this part of the draft. Gastrin is a defensive center who is not only fast but very strong on his skates. Great positionally, smart with his decision making, and still aggressive enough to break up plays. He has a heavy shot, but can defer to his linemates more if he's but with higher skill players. His smarts and skating make him a good playmaker, his ability to think the game at high speed in crowded areas and still get passes off helped in the Swedish junior league. But his offensive ceiling is not considerably high. There is the chance that he develops more offensively, he has a lot of good skills but he is the definition of a jack of all trades offensively.

He may have the highest floor of the players I've mentioned, but also the lowest ceiling without anything to really hang on to at this point that he will develop into a higher offensive output player like with some like Malcolm Spence or Bill Zonnon. There is also the issue of potential redundancy in the system with guys like Berglund and Ruohonen fitting a similar profile. There is also the fact that relatively often these low floor, great defensive Swedish forwards don't turn in to significant NHLers. There are ones that go around the late 1st/early 2nd every year and very few cross the line to NHLer.

[Ivan Ryabkin](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/690132/ivan-ryabkin) - C/LW - Muskegon Lumberjacks (USHL) - 5'11, 209 lbs

Rankings - Mean: 32.28, Median: 28th, Range: 23rd-54th

From the safest player to the biggest risk. Ryabkin may be the highest skilled player in the entire draft. As a 16 year old in the MHL he outscored guys like Michkov and Kucherov at the same age. He's got excellent hands, amazing edgework, making him a very difficult player to control. He is even shown he can be a great defensive player, something that wasn't really there in Michkov or Demidov the previous year. At the start of the season he was projected to go in the top 5, even in may there were still some rankings that had him as high as 4th. But after a falling out with Dynamo in the KHL, going to the USHL where he didn't exactly light it up, and then showing up to the combine out of shape and fighting with Russian translators I've seen some comments that he is on teams do not draft list.

The Flyers are in a better place to take a chance on Ryabkin, not only do they have a wealth of picks, having a number of Russians in the org, including Oleg Znarok who was a legendary coach in Russia, they may be able to reach him. Ryabkin reminds me a bit of Alexei Kovalev. You hear stories from people in the league when Kovalev was in his prime and they said he could have been the best player in the league, but he just didn't care or at least didn't care enough to do the little stuff. When he was on he was unstoppable, when he was a detriment. I don't know if there is room in the NHL for guys like that anymore with how much even the best players need to improve and grow year over year. Ryabkin could end up a super star in the NHL or a 30 point guy in the KHL. Given how his year went the Flyers could actually wait and grab him in the second if they really like him given his stock has dropped so dramatically.

[Blake Fiddler](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/577017/blake-fiddler) - RHD - Edmonton Oil Kings (USHL) - 6'4, 209 lbs

Rankings - Mean: 26.54, Median: 26th, Range: 19th-40th

From high risk/high reward to high risk/low reward. Blake Fiddler is a throw back to an older style of defenseman, big, physical, able to shut down the front of the net. He skates well for a big 6'4 defenseman, there is a lot of power but not really great footwork. There are also some red flags in how much development will need to be done. He doesn't really handle the puck really well, which is not great especially if he'll be dealing with a lot of loose pucks around the front of the net. The bigger worry is that he has very questionable decision making in the defensive end. It's easy to forgive someone jumping up and making questionable decisions offensively, but running around and being drawn out of your position is a bigger issue in your own zone, especially for a defensive defenseman.

I know people like Fiddler cause he's big and physical, but he would require a ton of work to get to where he can be a contributing NHLer. And even at that point it's hard to see anything more than a depth defenseman. Watching him the name that kept coming to mind was Carter Sotheran, they both have powerful strides and can be good in transition, but don't push play enough to be more than a mobile defensive defenseman. Sotheran I feel was a better decision maker, though I did see him more following being drafted than in his draft year. Also, the Flyers let Sotheran's rights expire after this season so they must not have liked his development or didn't think there was any room at the inn for him. I'm not saying the Flyers won't draft him, if they do there will probably be a lot of talk about how they have a big physical defenseman, but I don't know if he ever makes an impact in the NHL.

[Sascha Boumedienne](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/871078/sascha-boumedienne) - LHD - Boston University (NCAA) - 6'2, 183 lbs

Rankings - Mean: 31.43, Median: 29.5, Range: 15th-55th

Another boom/bust player, this time its Swedish LHD Sascha Boumedienne. Boumedienne's numbers may not jump off the score sheet, but he is potentially the offensively dynamic defenseman past Jackson Smith. Great straight line speed, great passing, excellent vision, and a good amount of skill to make it all come together. He maybe a bit less fluid as a skater than some of the high end D now, like Makar or Hughes, but he can create with his feet. At BU this past season he was behind Cole Hutson and 2023 11th Overall Tom Willander, but at the U18s he set the record for most points and assists for a defenseman.

Boumedienne can be described as more than the sum of his parts. His skills are quite good but when he is at his best he gets more out of them than one might think. But he is also less than the difference of his parts, he can poor decisions at times making him at points super human and a points a major detriment. He's not great defensively and can sometimes be forced into making bad turnovers in his own zone. He also can sometimes try and do a bit too much and shoot himself in the foot. For the Flyers it comes down to how much they think they can fix. If they can clean up his defensive mistakes and get the most out of his offense he could be a star. If not, I doubt he makes a real long term impact in the NHL.

[Cole McKinney](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/577022/cole-mckinney) - C - USNTDP - 6'0, 201 lbs

Ranking - Mean: 36.64, Median: 34th, Range: 20th-57th

McKinney was the top forward for the US National Team Development Program this past season, though that wasn't necessarily expected. While he was point per game in both the USHL and their non-league games (mostly played against NCAA teams) his production was much lower than other stars to come out of the NTDP. McKinney was never really projected to be a star offensively, he is more of a two-way center with great vision and strong play on and off the puck. While not the biggest player in the world he uses his physicality on both ends of the ice and can really be a bull in the middle of the ice. While he has good speed he has a bit of a choppy stride that makes him look like he is going faster than he actually is. It's a lot of wasted movement but something that should be fixable before he becomes a pro.

It is a down season for the NTDP, with potentially no NTDP grads going in the first round (though Potter and Fiddler left the team in the beginning of the year). A big step back considering going into the year they thought to potentially have as many as 5 or even more. McKinney is one of the players who slightly exceed expectations though. While McKinney doesn't have much high end skill he has the tools and mindset to be a very productive player, one of the more intriguing things is if his skating can be fixed I think it could open up a lot of production for him. Quickness and mobility can do a lot for a smart player who both find open ice and play in the dirty areas.

[Jack Nesbitt](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/881091/jack-nesbitt) - C - Windsor Spitfires (OHL) - 6'4, 183 lbs

Ranking - Mean: 34.57, Median: 32nd, Range: 18th-52nd

Nesbitt saw a huge breakout this season in the OHL, going from 18 points in 23-24 to 64 points in 24-25. Nesbitt's more of defensive center but his shot and developing skill got him more offensive opportunities as the season went along. He doesn't shy away from physical play and uses his big frame to overwhelm players along the boards. How much Nesbitt will develop into an offensive player in the NHL may be up in the air. Windsor had two of the top scorers in the OHL, while Nesbitt didn't play with them at 5v5, he did play on the power play with them and wasn't able to rack up a ton of points with them. Was this season a breakout playing with talented players, or was this a step towards greater growth?

One interesting angle on Nesbitt is that he could be considered an off-brand Roger McQueen. McQueen has way more skill and a better scoring touch, but he has real issues getting to the starting line in terms of his skating and decision making (let alone injuries). Nesbitt needs to improve his skating as well, but his mechanics are better than McQueens, Nesbitt has good form and solid power but his foot speed is not tremendous. Nesbitt is also a better decision maker, especially defensively, which makes it easier to slot in to the bottom of the line up. At the same time, he is not too dissimilar from Isaac Ratcliffe who was a much more prolific goal scorer. Ratcliffe also was great defensively in junior but because his skating didn't improve that didn't fully translate to the AHL, and he barely had a cup of coffee in the NHL. But if you are going to put a lot of work into a big center I think it's easier to justify doing that with someone taken towards the end of the first round compared to someone at the beginning of the round.

[Eric Nilson](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/871050/eric-nilson) - C - Djurgardens J20 (Swedish junior) going to Michigan State (NCAA) - 6'0, 165 lbs

Ranking - Mean: 35.5, Median: 36.5, Range: 18th-60th

Nilson is interesting because he is one of the more untapped and raw prospects that the potential to end up a high end player. Nilson is a shifty and smart playmaker who is excellent on his edges and creating time and space for himself in the offensive zone. While he has a lot of offensive upside, his defensive abilities are already a stand out of his game. Like a lot of Swedish centers he is good positionally and smart with his decision making, but what takes him to another level is his shiftiness allowing hims to make a move on players allowing him to take away passing lanes at the last second and force opponents into making mistakes. Nilson is undersized and physically underdeveloped at this moment, but that doesn't means he shies away from physical play. He'll need to bulk (all players do) but doing so could open up even more to his game.

Nilson came out of the Djurgarden, which is also producing Anton Frondell and Victor Eklund this season. Not only does that mean they've done a good job developing talent, but also explains why his opportunities had been more limited this past season. It's hard to have three draft eligible players on your roster when you are battling for first place and promotion. Nilson took his bad luck in getting call ups to the pro league into an opportunity, going to Michigan State in the fall and playing for Adam Nightingale who used to coach the US NTDP and has turned Michigan State back into a powerhouse. If he takes another step offensively he could be a big steal at the end of the first round, almost like an Anton Frondell-lite if Nilson continues to grow. Compared to other high reward players in this range he could fill in a depth role if he doesn't become a star offensively. But there is likely some fear that he doesn't develop physically enough to become a regular depth NHLer.

[Jack Murtagh](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/783165/jack-murtagh) - LW - USNTDP - 6'1, 198 lbs

Ranking - Mean: 35.5, Median: 31st, Range: 25th-70th

Murtagh is another player from the disappointing crop of US NTDP players this year. But there are definitely aspects of his game that could turn him into a player who has a long future in the NHL. First off is his speed, he has great acceleration and top speed that can make him an impactful player. His speed paired with his physicality will almost certainly get him a look at the NHL and likely a longer look than most. He has a heavy shot and can drive the net with some of the best players in this draft class. He also has good defensive instincts, this keeps his speed and aggression in check and prevents him from running around too much and turning his biggest asset into a detriment. Almost certainly the type of player that can carve out at least a depth role.

While he does have some offensive upside with his speed and shot, how much offense he provides at the NHL level is difficult to see. He doesn't boast a ton of puck skills or really high offensive IQ, and he's not a really gifted passer or playmaker either. He's a north/south player who can cause a lot of mayhem, and if he's directed at the net that can turn into some good offense, but likely will never put up really great offensive numbers. A high floor/low ceiling player that certainly plays ""Flyers hockey"".

[Joshua Ravensbergen](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/817695/joshua-ravensbergen) - G - Prince George Cougars (WHL) - 6'5, 192 lbs

Ranking - Mean: 32.57, Median: 30th, Range: 23rd-63rd

Ravensbergen has a lot of tools to work with. He's big and athletic which provide great building blocks. He's also a left catching (also known as true left) which can be very difficult for shooters to deal with. His movement in the crease can be a bit wild, his size and athleticism making up for that a good amount of the time. And like all young goaltenders he'll need to build on both his strength and precision.

Ravensbergen is a project, and if I'm being honest the Flyers aren't in a good spot to take on a project right now. They have two great goalie prospects in the pipeline, and one thing they are both going to need is playing time. The Flyers have had a problem rushing goaltenders recently. Carter Hart was rushed, Ersson was rushed, Kolosov has been rushed. The AHL and KHL can give goaltenders a chance to figure out what their weaknesses are, fix them, and most importantly allow those fixes to become their new habits, and that takes time. Zavragin and Bjarnason will likely still be in the AHL in two years when Ravenbergen is ready to come out. If they aren't the Flyers will have rushed yet another goaltender. Further, in 4-5 years the Flyers will be in full compete mode, so it's really unlikely that if they have guys like Bjarnason and Zavragin fail they likely won't look to another young goaltender but an established vet. The only way Ravenbergen makes the Flyers is if he's flawless out the gate and stays that way, and that is a really tough ask for a project.

**Final** **Thoughts**

How the Flyers use their later first round picks will depend on what they do at the start of the draft. It's hard to say what direction they will go in until their pick has been made. I do think they are in a good spot to take a risk, but they have to think they will be able to hit on those risky picks to take those shots.

One thing I think is interesting to note is the abundance of hardworking, gritty, two-way centers/left wingers later in the draft - especially in regards to taking Brady Martin near the top of the draft. I don't think there is truly that much difference between Martin and say someone like McKinney or Murtagh, there may be a higher likelihood Martin becomes that 45-50 point player, but I don't think it is worth skipping over higher skill players at the top of the draft. I think it will be much harder finding a Desnoyers, Frondell, or O'Brien later than it will be finding a Martin.

Personally I think they will go with one higher ceiling, potentially risky pick, and one safer pick later in the first round. They may also go with two safe picks and try for someone riskier with higher upside in the early part of the second round. Right now, my ideal combinations of later picks would be Reschny/Gastrin (risk/safe) or Spence/Nilson (safe/risk). I would think there is a lot of upside to Bill Zonnon and would be happy to grab him at 22nd or moving up into the mid 20s. Also, I think the Flyers are in a good spot to take a chance on Ryabkin, but I do think they wait until the 2nd or even 3rd if his stock keeps dropping.",10,1750283278.0,Flyers,1,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal pair of purple biker shorts should offer a blend of comfort, performance, and style. Examining the key features is crucial to making an informed purchase.

**Fabric composition and Weight**

The fabric composition significantly impacts the shorts' performance. Look for blends that include spandex or elastane for stretch and shape retention, combined with materials like nylon, polyester, or cotton for durability and breathability. The weight of the fabric, typically measured in GSM (grams per square meter), influences the overall feel and level of support. A higher GSM indicates a thicker, more compressive fabric suitable for high-intensity workouts, while a lower GSM offers a lighter, more breathable feel ideal for casual wear.

**Waistband Design and Height**

The waistband is a critical element for comfort and security. High-waisted designs are popular as they provide tummy control and prevent the shorts from slipping down during activity. Look for waistbands that are wide and elasticized for a comfortable, snug fit that doesn't dig into the skin. Some waistbands also incorporate hidden pockets for storing small items like keys or cards,adding a practical touch. The overall construction and reinforced seams provides reliability and long lasting use.

**Length and Inseam Options**

Biker shorts come in various lengths, typically ranging from 5 to 10 inches. The ideal length depends on personal preference and intended use. Shorter lengths are more suitable for warmer weather or activities where freedom of movement is paramount, while longer lengths offer more coverage and support. A well-designed inseam should prevent chafing and irritation, especially during vigorous activities like running or cycling.

**Moisture-Wicking and Breathability**

For workouts and active pursuits, moisture-wicking fabrics are essential. These fabrics draw sweat away from the body, keeping you cool and dry. Look for materials that are specifically engineered for breathability, allowing air to circulate and prevent overheating. Mesh panels or strategically placed ventilation can further enhance airflow and improve overall comfort.

**Colorfastness and Fade Resistance**

The vibrancy of the purple hue is a key aesthetic consideration. Choose shorts made from fabrics that are known for their colorfastness, meaning they will retain their color even after repeated washing and exposure to sunlight. Fabrics that are dyed using high-quality processes are less likely to fade over time. consider testing the shorts' colorfastness by washing them separately before wearing them with lighter-colored clothing.

**Seam Construction and Durability**

The quality of the seam construction is a strong signal of the overall durability.Flatlock seams are generally preferred, as they lie flat against the skin and prevent chafing. Reinforced stitching in high-stress areas, such as the waistband and crotch, enhances the shorts’ ability to withstand wear and tear. Examining the stitching for loose threads or uneven seams can reveal potential weaknesses.

## Core benefits

Purple biker shorts offer several benefits beyond their aesthetic appeal. From enhancing performance to providing comfort, they can be a valuable addition to anyone's wardrobe.

**Enhanced Comfort and Support**
The snug fit of biker shorts provides gentle compression, wich can improve circulation and reduce muscle fatigue during workouts. The high waistband offers additional support to the core, promoting better posture and stability. This combination of comfort and support makes purple biker shorts ideal for activities like yoga, Pilates, and weightlifting, and also for everyday wear.

**Improved Mobility and Flexibility**
The stretchy fabrics used in biker shorts allow for a full range of motion, making them perfect for activities that require flexibility. Unlike traditional athletic shorts, biker shorts don't ride up or bunch, ensuring a distraction-free workout. The streamlined design also minimizes wind resistance, making them a good choice for outdoor activities like running and cycling.

**Stylish and Versatile Appearance**
Purple biker shorts can be paired with a variety of tops, from casual t-shirts to more formal blouses, making them an incredibly versatile wardrobe staple.The color purple is frequently enough associated with creativity,luxury,and sophistication,allowing you to express your personal style. Whether you're going to the gym, running errands, or meeting friends for coffee, purple biker shorts can elevate your look.

**Confidence boost and Body Positivity**

The compressive fit of biker shorts can create a flattering silhouette, smoothing out the tummy and accentuating the legs. This can help boost confidence and promote a more positive body image. The availability of various sizes and styles ensures that everyone can find a pair of purple biker shorts that fits and flatters their unique body shape.

**Temperature Regulation**

High-quality biker shorts are designed to regulate body temperature, keeping you cool and dry in warm weather and providing a layer of insulation in cooler conditions. Moisture-wicking fabrics draw away sweat, preventing you from feeling clammy, while breathable materials allow air to circulate freely. This makes purple biker shorts suitable for a wide range of climates and activities.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions can help alleviate any concerns and clarify the benefits of purple biker shorts.

**Are Purple Biker Shorts See-Through?**
The opacity of purple biker shorts depends on the fabric's thickness and color saturation. Darker shades of purple made from thicker, high-quality materials are less likely to be see-through. A good test is to squat in front of a mirror to check for any openness. Look for shorts that specifically mention ""squat-proof"" or ""non-see-through"" in their description.Also, consider darker shades compared to lighter, more pastel shades as these tend to be less transparent.

**How Do I Care for My Purple Biker Shorts to Maintain Their Color?**
To preserve the color and integrity of your purple biker shorts, wash them inside out in cold water with a mild detergent. Avoid using bleach or fabric softeners, as these can damage the fabric and cause fading. Tumble dry on low heat or, ideally, hang to dry. Avoid direct sunlight, which can also cause fading.**What Type of Underwear Should I Wear with Purple biker Shorts?**
Seamless or thong underwear is generally recommended to avoid visible panty lines (VPL). Choose breathable materials like cotton or microfiber for added comfort. Some biker shorts also come with a built-in gusset, eliminating the need for underwear altogether.

**Can I Wear Purple biker Shorts for High-Intensity Workouts?**
Yes, high-quality purple biker shorts made from moisture-wicking and breathable fabrics are suitable for high-intensity workouts. Look for shorts with a compressive fit to provide support and reduce muscle fatigue. Ensure the fabric is squat-proof and the seams are durable to withstand rigorous movements.

So for context, I’ve always been someone who dresses up for church. Shirt and tie at a minimum, and if it’s not too hot, I’ll wear a suit, it’s how I was raised. 

But I’ve noticed lately that when I’m out in public after church (like grabbing a coffee, stopping by the store or picking up food) I feel like people are colder to me than they used to be. I used to get friendly small talk, a smile, eye contact, whatever. Over the past half year i feel like that has turned more into getting the cold shoulder from people. I’ll get handed my stuff with no eye contact, no “have a good one,” nothing. Even when I just saw them be friendly with the person before me. 

It kind of feels like when people see me dressed like that, their first thought is “religious = Trump supporter” and that’s where the judgment kicks in. For the record, I don’t agree with everything Trump has said or done, but I did vote for him.

Has anyone else felt something similar? Curious if it’s just me.",1,1750283132.0,Catholicism,7,0.57,False

J.M. Smucker (SJM), a leading manufacturer of consumer food and beverage products including iconic brands like Smucker’s jams, Folgers coffee, and Jif peanut butter, faced a complex financial landscape in fiscal 2025, marked by a significant write-down and strategic capital allocation. The most striking development was a substantial $2 billion pre-tax impairment charge on its Sweet Baked Snacks segment, primarily affecting Hostess goodwill ($1.66 billion) and the Hostess brand trademark ($320.9 million). This charge, incurred less than two years after the $5.4 billion acquisition of Hostess Brands in November 2023, reflects severe underperformance, execution challenges, and a substantial overvaluation at the time of purchase. Management notes the segment remains “susceptible to future impairment charges,” signaling ongoing challenges in a key acquisition.

Despite this major non-cash hit, J.M. Smucker demonstrated a commitment to balance sheet health by repaying $1.3 billion in long-term debt, reducing its total debt from $8.36 billion to $7.68 billion. However, interest expense surged 47% year-over-year to $389 million, primarily due to financing the Hostess acquisition, placing a significant burden on profitability. On a positive note, the company’s underlying operations generated robust free cash flow, which surged 27% to $817 million, providing substantial liquidity for strategic deployment.

Looking beyond the impairment, the company saw mixed operational performance. While core U.S. Retail Coffee and U.S. Retail Pet Foods segments delivered profit growth of 5% and 14%, respectively, overall volume/mix decreased 2 percentage points. Specifically, U.S. Retail Pet Foods net sales decreased 9%, and Sweet Baked Snacks (excluding acquisition/divestiture impacts) saw an 11% decline in net sales. The company also faced increased competition, with private label brands gaining 1.5 percentage points of market share in its U.S. retail categories, increasing to 15.2%. In a strategic move to secure future growth, J.M. Smucker invested $1.1 billion in a new Uncrustables manufacturing and distribution facility, with production beginning in Q2 2025, aiming to meet growing demand for this high-performing product category. The company also effectively managed commodity price volatility, recognizing a $102.3 million derivative gain on commodity contracts.

1letfbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvPD/comments/1letfbo/i_dont_have_friends/,I don't have friends,"This is a bit dramatic, but after the events of the last few weeks, it's how I feel. And just to be clear: I do have friends, but it's always a surface level friendship. I'm not even asking to be anyone's first choice, I settle for being just a choice and not an afterthought.

It sucks because for the last 2 and a half years now I've been making efforts to meet new people and be social and strengthen bonds with them. But it's always fruitless and makes me question why I even bother. If I don't have friends and I have to do everything by myself, if I have no expectations from other people at all, I'm not lonely, I'm just alone. But if I have friends but I still do everything alone even when I try not to, then I do feel lonely.

Just a couple of weeks ago my sister got married, I heard the way her friends talked about her during the wedding, I know the kind of stuff they do for each other. I know they do love and take care of each other.

Meanwhile, my friends in the last couple of weeks:

* After asking them to come with me to a free concert, they gave no answer or gave vague answers and ended up not coming with me (they stayed home playing videogames together).
* After asking them to come with me to another free concert, some said no, some didn't answer, some said yes and cancelled last minute, saying ""we can meet any other day!"" (I had to refrain from asking if they were stupid).
* After asking them to meet for coffee first a few days before the date, they replied they'd go the first time and only one replied he couldn't go when I asked again on the day (we didn't meet in the end).
* After planning on meeting with me for dinner on my birthday, the actual day I met no one.
* After telling them I couldn't go with them to a festival because my sister's wedding was the same weekend (400 km away from where we live), they called on Friday at 22:00, 5 hours after they had gone to the festival probably to ask me to go with them, I don't know, I didn't pick it up, but they called me the following morning and it was to tell me to go with them to the festival. They forgot about me twice.
* After telling a friend my whole plan for the weekend of my sister's wedding because he asked me on Thursday morning (I leave on Thursday evening, ceremony is on Saturday, I don't get back until Monday and I'll be back to work on Tuesday on the other building), he asked me for photos of the wedding on Friday but not on Saturday, asked me if I was coming back to work on Monday and if I had to work in his building or the other one on Sunday. He asked me again literally about everything I had already told him.

This is a different group of friends, I've met them online, but we've been friends for more than 10 years and I've met every one of them in person.

* After telling them my sister just got married: just 1 thumbs up emoji as a reaction to my message.
* I've been making songs with Suno for them on their birthdays, before this, I had already made three and the feedback was that they liked them. Anyway, they never remember my birthday, so I expected them to not make one for me. So I made one for myself. Now, two things: there is a friend whose birthday is a few days after mine, and English is not our first language, but most of us speak it fluently. I made the song for the other friend in our language, I took the first 2 seconds and played them at the beginning of my song so it would look like it was a mistake. But then, 2 seconds afterwards, my song begins and it's obvious it's not for the other friend, as it says my name. I decided to make my song in English because Suno wasn't working well with the lyrics in our language for the type of song I was trying to make. Nobody listened to it, because nobody wished me a happy birthday. One of them, the one who has been living in England for years and studied something related to translation even said ""Ew, I'm not listening to it if it's in English"".

I'm aware I might be especially sensitive on my birthday, I've also thought that maybe they liked the first three songs because of the novelty of it, but they don't like them anymore. Maybe it was too subtle, but I don't really think so.

Also, the first group of friends did meet with me two days after, but the problem with this are the expectations: if I don't expect anything and I get nothing, I'm not disappointed. If I expect something like we were going to meet and have dinner and I tell my parents about it and then on the actual day, I'm home and my parents are asking me what happened, then it fucking sucks. It didn't hurt last year when nobody remembered and it did hurt this year that they did.

Or maybe my expectations are just too high.",2,1750282760.0,AvPD,0,1.0,False

One burger combo after tax is half a week's worth of groceries, 3 meals a day if you stick to cheap items like sardines, rice, and oatmeal. Eat something outside 2 times a week? Thats a whole week of groceries gone + savings. The possibilities are endless, its crazy how much you can stretch 10 dollars if you look hard enough

I just cant go out for tea, food, or whatever food and consistently eat out. Max I wanna eat out for is once per 2 weeks, maybe once a month if its really bad(I'm broke).

But most first years, from what I can see(correct me if im wrong), eat out alot(whether its fastfood, restaurants, tea shops, coffee, smoothies etc) and when they hang out a fair amount of the time its not free. Totally fine, and I have zero issue with this whatsoever and I don’t care how others spend their money at all. But the thing is, I just cant keep up with it. Especially in Ottawa. And the transit fees are gonna stack up and everything is gonna suck and its just gonna get worse and worse.

however, he’s been flakey at texting from the start. it took us 2 weeks to plan our date bc he had a wedding and was just bad at texting lol. but im kind of worried that he could be avoidant because im really working on become secure and dont want to rush anything, but also keep getting ghosted or rejected now bc i think im not as intense as i was (im FA leaning AP) and i think people are losing interest. but there have been a few people that have triggered me from the start and i was right about their avoidant attachment.

with this guy, my nervous system feels fine and he was so sweet on our date. i had such a wonderful time. but is this normal for texting? he does seem a bit all over the place in personality lol but he rode his bike to our date and grounded himself in the grass beforehand because he felt anxious.. should i leave before i get hurt? or is this all normal? chatgpt said he could be avoidant lol im really afraid of meeting another avoidant so thought id share on here for other opinions

okay!, im down to meet early to get dinny/drinks! maybe 3:30 or 4?! depending on what time i close the shop!

This morning I ended up caving and eating at 6:30! I think I feel very stressed and dysregulated, but also very hungry… my willpower has just been failing me. 
Anyways, I’ve always followed, clean fasting and only had water or black coffee during my fasts. I think I am to a point where I would like to lean on some little cheats (for now) to help me make it to 16 or 18 hours daily until I’m able to establish a pattern. I’ve heard some people will dirty fast and put cream in their coffee. I’m wondering if there are other hacks (food or bev) that don’t spike insulin that people use to help them? The more ideas, the better!

That said, I’ll also be using the bike casually around Santa Monica for leisurely rides to the beach, coffee shops, and cruising the paths.

I’m torn between a full suspension like the Trek Fuel EX 5 and a hardtail like the Santa Cruz Chameleon. I like the idea of the full squish for comfort and capability on rougher trails, but the Chameleon seems super versatile, efficient for pavement riding, and still trail-capable.

Anyone with experience riding in these areas have thoughts? Will I regret going hardtail when I hit the steeper or chunkier stuff? Or will the full suspension feel like overkill when I’m just cruising around town?

I’m thinking of trying Purity coffee, specifically the Balance option as too much caffeine causes anxiety. I just need a little caffeine! Another option is to buy an expresso pod machine and have decaf espresso. I’m hoping that even decaf expresso will have a tiny bit of caffeine that will work for me.

1let5bj,https://www.reddit.com/r/lemans/comments/1let5bj/motorsport_travel_destinations_gold_flexotel/,Motorsport Travel Destinations Gold (Flexotel) Review,"So in a few threads before I left for Le Mans this year I agreed to do an up to date review of the Flexotel provision from Motorsport Travel Destinations, so here it is. The last reviews of the Flexotels were a few years old, so it's probably time for something more recent. I'll try to break it in to sections to make it easier to read.  

What I Paid for: 

* Flexotel Single occupancy booking 
* Wednesday Arrival 
* Monday Departure 
* Channel Tunnel crossing 

What I paid: 

* £3,280 (seriously, don’t. I know this is horrifyingly expensive, I don’t need all of Reddit telling me as well) 

What you get: 

* Secure, hard standing car park 
* On site staff to go through issues with 
* Secure, lockable solid room, including 2 beds, a table, two folding chairs and hanging storage (canvas), bedding, towels, bath robes, 2 power sockets 
* Freebies: 
   * 2 Mugs 
   * 2 earpiece radios 
   * Backpack  
   * Pen 
   * Stickers 
   * Umbrella 
* Included events: 
   * Audience with Antony Davidson and Alex Brundle (in the silver camp, opposite end of the site from the Flexotels) 
   * Live music in Bronze 
   * Wine tasting with Maylander wines  
   * Daily Sim Racing rigs 
   * Daily breakfast 

 So how was each bit? 

* Parking’s parking. Was nice to be able to easily get out to shops etc though. And given how crazy I’ve heard Le Mans used to be, quite reassuring. Having spent some time in public camping with friends, I don’t think I needed to worry. 
* Frankly the staff were teenagers. No clue about much, not huge amounts of help, pleasant for a chat but that’s only if you could tear them away from their phones / each other 
* The room. Ok, so the beds were  more comfortable than sleeping on the floor or an air mattress, and it was nice to have bedding, towels etc included. When it poured it was nice to be in the dry looking out and to easily be able to dry wet gear or towels. However, if you think your ‘cabin’ is private, it’s not. Each cabin is in fact two cabins which are divided by a wall which folds away when the cabin is collapsed. Which means it’s not exactly air tight, so you can hear everything which happens in the next cabin. EVERYTHING. Take ear plugs. Mine was on the front row and in full sun every afternoon. It was hotter than hell when I arrived, but to be fair over night wasn’t that bad, but there was only me in it. Given as I’d paid extra to arrive early it would have been nice to have one in the shade, but there we are. I did ask the teenagers if I could swap, confusion happened. 
* Freebies – All very nice to have, but nothing that would swing the sale 
* Events – I would have loved to make the Antony Davidson event, unfortunately I ended up at Mulsanne and lost track of time. I imagine this would absolutely have been worth it. 
* The band was called “Go Commando”. Draw your own conclusions. There was enough live music all over the site and all through the weekend that this didn’t make much difference, and probably better on offer at the huge bar in the shopping village 
* Wine tasting – Would have been worth it had Bernd Maylander actually been there, but alas. As it was, I didn’t feel like getting trapped in an obvious sales pitch 
* There was literally sim racing everywhere at Le Mans this year, and I never saw anyone actually operating the rigs or using them, so I have no idea if they were available or not.  
* Breakfast – A choice of either Full English, continental, or a sausage bap. One day someone asked for a croissant as well as a full english and was told by a teenager - “I’m sorry, I’m not allowed to do that, I got told off yesterday”. It is served to you so you pretty much get what you’re given from bacon, egg, sausage, half a tomato and beans. This means that if you take a Premier Inn breakfast buffet as the basic level of what an included breakfast should meet, they didn’t even get close. Oh, and instant coffee was an extra €3.50. 

They also did evening meals at about €20 per go and beer was standard Le Mans pricing of €8 for 500ml. They did have a TV on over night showing the race but the connection was terrible and the TV in the Epinettes camping was infinitely better. Also no over night bar at any point. 

So was it better than camping? Well yes, marginally although as a solo traveller it was incredibly isolating. There was none of the sense of camaraderie or party that happens on other sites. I met some people camping on Epinettes and spent a lot of time over there with them – it was just more fun. Do I feel ripped off? Frankly yes. Would I do Le Mans again? Yes absolutely, just not like this. 10 years ago when the camp sites were absolutely bonkers, maybe it was worth it then, but for better or worse the ACO are trying to calm things down and appeal to a more family audience, so maybe camping isn’t the worry it used to be. Am I happy I did it? Well yes, this was my first Le Mans and the event itself was utterly amazing. But I’m sorry, for the money they are charging for this, it simply isn’t good enough. If you can afford Ferraris or Porches or Astons as many in the car park could, then maybe it’s an insignificant cost to you, or if you’re flying in from another part of the world entirely, the convinience is worth it but this was a very significant cost to me, in the order of two months salary and what they offered just wasn’t good enough beyond the cabin. As one of my friends said to me, “If Premier Inn is the yardstick and it’s not meeting that, it says it all”.  ",10,1750282052.0,lemans,2,0.92,False

The worst—**the absolute worst**—was **the Atlantic City Incident**.

It was supposed to be a simple weekend getaway, but **the moment they checked into the hotel, the city fell into chaos**. Slot machines malfunctioned, flashing random numbers that **only spelled out Maya’s name**. Dice levitated. Blackjack dealers **refused to deal cards to anyone but her**.

Then, the **ceiling cracked open** and, somehow—**somehow**—fireworks went off inside the hotel, completely unprompted.

I know it’s generally considered safe in small amounts, but I’m curious does anyone know what percentage of TSP is actually used in these drinks?

I’m not trying to panic, just looking for transparency. TSP has some pretty intense industrial uses like:

* Degreasing agents in heavy-duty cleaners
* Paint thinning or prepping walls before painting
* Industrial detergent manufacturing
* Removing rust and cleaning cement

Obviously, the food grade version is different, but seeing something used in cleaning products and building prep listed on a drink kinda made me paranoid.

**Autumnhollow, Terragalia:**

 “*Alright!*” Ingrid announced “*First batch is done! Reel em’ back in, Viel!*”

The table reappeared in Autumnhollow’s crafting room, Zefir and Gwen quickly got back to work putting away the baskets. It was then that Zefir noticed that recalling the table also included items placed underneath. It appeared that his ability had also gotten an upgrade.

“Standby, Team.” Zefir said as he and Gwen worked. “Anyway, I think as soon as you girls are done in the kitchen, I doubt there’s anything else left of pertinent value to us, or the village here.”

*“There’s still the garage and the basement if any.”* Philia said, *“Some of them I could make use of, never hurts to have more tools and chemicals. The attic is pushing it, if there’s any as well. Bedrooms, minimal value… but the linens, and towels are definitely useful. Pillows wouldn’t hurt either.”*

“*The dining room might probably have a display cabinet filled with show-off ceramics too.*” Neith quipped “*We could crash the market if we raided all the houses here of their Thanksgiving-only plates.*”

*“Tempting, but not realistic.”* Philia replied. *“We’re in a layered Rogue Rift. Even if we dilly-dally here, once the primary rift is closed, we get ejected from this world as well.”*

""*Any upstairs bathroom would have a medicine cabinet as well. All bathrooms should be checked.*"" Ingrid added.

“Just confirming…” Gwen spoke up “Will you all be returning today?”

“*We will.*” Ingrid confirmed “*We will not spend the night here, if we cannot find vehicles we will return to Terragalia and bring in the ATV, also we need to make room for our item boxes.*”

“*And get upgrades.*” Cecil said.

*“Also, we need to get that \[Sally Pot\] running and outfit our newfound friends.”* Peanut added. *“Fortunately Eliria left behind notes in her tome on how to get it to work.”*

“Of course, Kinoko.” Zefir said calmingly, he was a little worried that the little mushroom might cry again being reminded of her former team, but her voice was stable.

“*Boooo!*” Neith jeered, playing a sound clip of a booing audience to keep things light-hearted “*Filler Episode incoming!*”

“Table Box emptied!” Zefir announced. “Ready for the next batch!”

*""Take it away, girls!""* Ingrid said, *“Baseplate, Outlaw, take ten!”*

“Roger!” Zefir replied.

 

""You lived in a town like that too, Zefir?"" Gwen asked as the two headed to the kitchen for coffee.

""I did."" he replied, opening the door for her. ""Sarasota's a much warmer place than Chicago though. When my work week was done, there'd be a convoy of cars at my place, me and my office friends... workmates at the guild, would hang out, play together, and get drunk. If anything, it taught me how to cook for many people. When the summer came, my friends would usually crash- I mean stay over at my house and we'd visit the beaches nearby and pick up girls... not that I miss that anymore.""

Gwen smiled, her cat ears twitching with the thought. ""It sounds quite enjoyable.""

""It is!"" Zefir nodded, he walked towards the counter where it had coffee machines.

Real coffee machines.

These were not those pathetic consumer-grade ones that infested the unfortunate 90% of American homes. Nor were these the rigged instant-coffee vending machines found in the lower rungs of the corporate slave pit. These were the ones found in overpriced cafes, not the ones where pretend-intellectuals with their skinny jeans and bikes would hover over like flies on an open dumpster. No, these were the ones frequented by men who booked a first-class flight and never wore anything less impressive than a pin-striped business suit, ostensibly made by an Italian brand the filthy unwashed masses didn't even knew exist, their muscle cars purring with the engine on in the parking lot. And if they did wear anything less impressive, it was aboard a Yacht in the Azores.

These were filched by Philia and among the first things she summoned from Earth once she got the magic formula down, and with Neith activated Zefir was sure that the grinder was rigged to either self-destruct or flood Autumnhollow with a deadly nerve gas the second anyone tried to put anything but the finest Arabica that cost at least ten human lives to harvest. And while the coffee beans weren't sourced from Earth, considering it was grown in Elion-Nosco, Zefir had a feeling that it did indeed cost at least ten lives.

 

As Zefir got to work brewing a big pot of coffee, the adventuring team busied themselves with filling in their baskets…

**Lakeview IL, Another Earth:**

“*Table Box emptied!*” Zefir announced. “*Ready for the next batch!*”

""Take it away, girls!"" Ingrid said, moving onto the refrigerator to unplug it. “Baseplate, Outlaw, take ten.”

""C'mon girls! Chop, chop!"" Philia said, clapping her hands. ""Let's get this kitchen work finished so we can proceed to the rest of the house.""

Philia and Cecil began unplugging various kitchen appliances like the toaster oven, microwave, an electric casserole, a pressure cooker, a slow-cooker, and-

“Oh this kitchen range is Schüller too!” Ingrid said as she effortlessly pulled it out, mindful not to scrape its feet against the linoleum floor.

“Ja! Zis stove vill last us a long time, aeeuughh!” Cecil said in a funny accent.

“Anysing you cook vill have muscles! Aeeuughh!” Philia added, flexing her arms.

Everyone started giggling at the earthling’s funny voices.

After placing the kitchen range into Cecil’s dimension, she turned and saw Arthur squeaking up at her.

She frowned and shook her head as she saw him hold out a can of dog food.

“No! You are not animals!” Ingrid said. Arthur shrugged and opened the can anyway , then dumped the contents into Johnny’s eager maw.

Sammy, remembering Ingrid and Philia mentioning something about a vast leap in technology, spoke up.

“You mentioned we’re in the past, will these appliances have any significant differences compared to the ones we have back home?” Sammy asked.

“Zero.” Ingrid said as she lifted the refrigerator by the sides and gently laid on Cecil's roofdeck. He had moved his room-side portal to an out-of-the-way side and widened the nexus to allow passage.

“The only differences there are would be purely aesthetic.” Cecil added, “That said, a reminder that if we’re heading into Downtown Chicago, we really need to get a chest freezer so we can store Nod’s catch of fish in there...”

“Make it two.” Kinu said, putting down the last stacks of tupperware and crockery, “Once our farm grows we’re gonna need another for our butchered livestock.”

“I guess…” Peanut remarked, placing onto the \[Table Box\] a stack of beautiful lacquered bowls, “We normally smoke and salt meat, but fresh meat is definitely something I’d definitely appreciate.”

""I’m sure we’ll have no problem getting as much as we need."" Ingrid remarked, motioning for Cecil to come over as she held up the kitchen range. “Quite a lot of stores we’ll likely run into will have them, supermarkets have them to store various goods that require very low temperatures and they’re too big to loot. Well, their contents likely have been but not the freezers themselves.”

""Definitely."" Cecil said, shrinking his portal and flying up to the island counter so Philia could start putting in her finds, he also took the remainder of the canned ravioli still in their wholesale box, that way the team could snack on them while on the go.

""Let’s hope they’re still in good condition,"" Siria said as she laid on the table the last of the canned goods; these were prepared ingredients such as olives, baby corn, peas, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, etc. Meanwhile Viel brought in still-unopened bulk packs of instant noodles.

""Still, there's stuff here we can make use of before we head out into the city."" Peanut added. ""Linens, towels, blankets, those will be helpful in bundling up whatever we find.""

“Agreed,” Philia said, patting Peanut’s cap, “That’s definitely something we can’t afford to skimp on…well, as far as survival and utility goes.”

Cecil narrowed his eyes while Ingrid grinned and waggled her eyebrows knowingly.

 

“Assuming this Chicago is truly deserted then we can grab the nearest cluster of Ether Quartz and take a detour and look for Site Epsilon-four."" Philia said, causing Ingrid and Cecil to chuckle darkly.

""What is it?"" Siria asked, noticing their reaction.

""It's..."" Ingrid took awhile to compose herself. ""Deep under the city. It's a hidden weapons bunker built during the Cold War, it's full of weapons that..."" she took a deep breath and sighed ""...that Uncle Sam didn't want other countries to know even existed at the time...""

Ingrid looked at Philia and nodded.

""Undeclared nuclear bombs. It's also where they stored the Virginia.""

""*Virginia?*"" Zefir asked.

On cue, Cecil started playing *Idumea* softly on his Muse Box.

""July 30, 1864, The Siege of Petersburg, Virginia."" Ingrid explained, ""Union Forces detonated the largest explosion ever recorded in North America. It was a coal mine filled with explosives that was dug under the city.""

“*Is this an arms stockpile?.*” Zefir said, recognizing the song. *“More guns to arm our sylvants? We gonna have a turkey shoot?”*

“Maybe guns,” Philia replied, ""...but the Virginia I’m talking about is a Davy Crockett-styled Hydrogen Warhead…”

“A miniature nuclear rocket.” Neith interjected for everyone’s benefit. “Yet portable enough for Cecil to carry in his room.”

“Yes, its similarity to the Davy Crockett was what allowed the US to test it out like the rest without anyone else knowing its true nature. It is the perfect mini-nuke, 1.5 the effective range of the DC rocket, and the radiation doesn't last long, you could have a picnic there in ten minutes.""

Ingrid continued for her ""It was what blunted the Dark Empire's ground assault on the northern states. Those weren't tactical nukes the media said, it was those were Cold-Era dinosaurs. If this world's history at least followed ours, then it stands to reason it should be there.""

""*What makes you think they haven't used them yet?""* Zefir asked.

""Because,"" Cecil paused to turn the page of his newspaper ""I know for a fact that Lakeview shouldn’t be too far from the destructive radius if the army went crazy with their nuclear arsenal stored here.”

 

The rest of the Whales murmured with each other. They sounded enthused with the idea.

“*How many are talking about?*” Zefir inquired, digesting this information.

“Put it this way…” Ingrid said “...even if we let the Russians land their whole army in Canada, we’ll be sending them packing after a day or two.”

*“Mrrrow!”* Zefir trilled.

“It’s worth a visit.” Cecil said, “If there’s people still around, let's just say we’re just carrying out Nuclear disarmament. Like what they should have been doing…”

“Disarmament? I don't understand.” Peanut squeaked, looking up from a cookbook she had been reading, “You once mentioned these super-destructive weapons keep the peace since no one could ever have the advantage. Why would the countries elect to disarm?”

“They’ve been making too much, Peanut.” Cecil said, returning to his paper “Too many nukes, too many to account for, it is too easy to suddenly lose one or have it stolen with how much they have lying around.” He looked up at her, “Just like what we’re planning on doing now.”

""Back to the topic..."" Ingrid said. ""Should we acquire these weapons? Nerve gasses like Sarin allow us to wipe out many enemies while sparing the infrastructure. Now, even if we had the Virginia then, it wouldn't justify destroying the town of Irons. Have any of you encountered situations where such a weapon could be reasonably used?""

“We’ll use the regular nukes to speedrun this Rift World nonsense, Ingrid.” Philia said. “As for the Virginia I say it’s reasonable, besides, it’ll be Cecil who’ll be using it.”

""The ground being cursed for only ten minutes?"" Sammy grinned ""We'll be fighting longer during a Red Moon. That's a reality we have to always consider.""

""Monster nests in Lost Cities."" Peanut said quickly. ""Have Cecil annihilate them from the sky then we take our time walking there to start looting.""

""There's always big game to take down."" Selphie added, taking the stack of magazines and bringing them to Cecil’s room. ""Unless I can start making whipcrawlers that could take over a Titan, weapons like Virginia would be useful in taking them out as soon as possible.""

Ingrid patted the Dryad's head, ""Don't let that worry you, Selphie.""

""With that said,"" Philia spoke up ""the next question is if it is worth it. We're not just going to be dealing with monsters with teeth and claws. We're dealing with men who have been trained to use firearms, they're not going to show themselves, they're going to peek from every possible corner or loophole and shoot from there. We do have protective shields, that should give us a head start but don't forget that they got radio like us as well. If even one of them sees us, they will raise the alarm. And if even one of them sees how we fight, they will all learn from that one man's observation.""

""Have Neith run interference."" Kvaris shrugged.

""It's not that simple."" The AI replied ""I don't have the equipment for it.""

""There's gotta be an overrun military outpost somewhere here."" Cecil said, ""I’m sure they've at least tried to have a military response once this worm-head invasion took off. We find one and take it. I'm sure they're pretty big but..."" he flicked a tendril at his dimension ""I got enough room.""

“I’m saying nothing.” Neith spoke up. “It’s only a matter of time we’re going to be the only nuclear power in all of Terragalia and… better us than them.”

“Alright, Nuclear shopping it is.” Ingrid said, “In the meantime, we’ll take whatever useful things we find in this house.” Ingrid chimed in, bringing in the refrigerator last, allowing Cecil to return his portal back to its usual size.

 

“Aaand that just wraps it up!” Ingrid announced, surveying the now-(mostly) emptied kitchen.”Let’s get to the rest of the house. Now remember, nobody goes alone! We'll start by clearing these two doors,"" Ingrid continued. ""Cecil and I'll take this small one, the rest of you clear the room behind the double doors, it probably leads to the house proper.""

""Understood."" Siria said. Kinu and Kvaris stacked up by the door, accompanied by Philia, Siria, and the mice.

“Once you've cleared the room behind that one,"" Ingrid said, directing everyone. ""Mice, get a small team guarding the front doors and windows, Johnny, barricade the front door and get roots to slip under it. There will be a lawn there for you to draw nourishment from, use that lawn to spread your roots and get a defense network up. Viel, veil the windows just as you did these ones.""

""Okay!"" The adorable cat girl chirped, tossing the comic book she found into Cecil's room as she jumped off her seat. She held her hand out and her staff flew to her grasp.

The mice squeaked and saluted, while Johnny croaked, snapping his jaws in excitement.

""Siria, as soon as you've cleared a way to the stairs, form with Valkyrie and check the upstairs rooms two at a time. Kinu and Kvaris, check one, Siria and Sammy, check the other. Cuddly, provide illumination with your butterflies. Arthur, Sully, and Finn, go with the Enthana sisters. Charles, Oscar, and Xavier, go with Siria and Sammy. Selphie and Lakota, accompany Cuddly upstairs.""

""Alright, Ingrid!"" Selphie assented, the flowers on her antler-like head branches bloomed. The addressed mice squeaked off a salute while Siria and the Valkyrie team chorused with a ""Yup-yup!""

""Ermm..."" Cuddly murmured, nodding.

""Philia, you and Peanut locate the garage and find us a transport, if there is none, I'm sure there's a treasure trove of goods in there. I want Team Santiago's clones and Umbra with you. That room's got flammable chemicals so if possible use your melee weapons or pellet shots.""

“Garage?” Peanut squeaked.

“It’s like a stable for vehicles, like where we stored our ATV.” Cecil explained.

""Rog."" Philia said as she pulled out a pistol from her belt. It was a burst-fire Beretta 93R and one of her oldest “works” after she was reborn in Terragalia. Like the guns she would enchant later on, it sported a permanent Enhancement Lens, complimenting the fact that it was chambered for large-caliber hollow-point Magnum rounds, allowing her Beretta to strike with the force of a full-powered rifle with the added stopping force.

""Viel, Iohann, and Neith, once we've secured the room beyond, move in and take refuge there. Aviz team, you too, fall back. We're leaving this area of the house.""

""Very well."" Iohann replied. Fireteam Aviz squeaked in reply.

""Everyone,” Ingrid called “This is Earth. Contemporary-era Earth. If there are people here, they will be armed with the same weapons as the mice and Philia. Keep that in mind.""

Everyone nodded.

“Mice,” she added “Let’s put those transceivers to use. Clip them on.”

The mice squeaked in response and took a few moments to clip onto their left pack-strap a small hand-held radio transceiver. They looked like tiny walkie-talkies that the team could speak through.

\_\_\_

""Let's go then, I'll handle this door."" Ingrid said, taking position behind it, Cecil flew in next to her.

""We'll take these double doors then."" Siria said, motioning for everyone to take position.

Viel opened the door using her telekinesis, revealing a grand room that combined the dining and living room into one.

“Avarice!” Selphie called.

The five entities in front of them didn't look like worm-heads. They were still human in shape but this time they had a big shard of crystal embedded into their bodies, and their skin looked completely dry and grayed out. They were standing completely still twenty feet away from the group, but when the light fell upon them, their necks whipped around in the team's direction. The creatures opened their mouths impossibly wide, revealing multiple insect-like mandibles coming out of it.

 

""Hands!"" Philia said in a loud, commanding tone. ""Show your hands!""

“Already!?” Ingrid exclaimed, keeping her door closed by clamping her hand over the knob just in case something tried to get out. Cecil kept his portal pointed at Ingrid's door. The mice of fireteam Apache also kept their eyes fixed.

“*Good boys.*” Cecil thought, maintaining his discipline.

 

The creatures groaned and lunged at Siria’s team. Just as they did, Kvaris' met the lunge of the nearest creature with her own, instantly swapping her sword with her corseca and impaling it in the chest; blowing a hole through creature as her weapon's soulstone reacted with the creature's life force to blast off a five-foot long spike of pure mana. Additionally, the Companion Rogue Shillelagh affixed to her corseca summoned its bound warhammer, smashing the big crystal on its chest with a satisfying crunch. With her back leg, she kicked out her Grand Caltrop, sending the heavy spiked ball towards another creature's gut, doubling it over to receive a shot in the head by Oscar's pellet which in turn generated its own warhammer to smash its gem.

A split-second after Kvaris kicked out the Grand Caltrop, Kinu sailed through the air slicing through the third creature from right shoulder to left hip. The fourth and fifth were taken out with two precise shots to the chest by Charles and Troy's pellets, the ensuing hammer strikes obliterating their crystals.

 

The creatures did not bleed, instead they let out a black smoke-like gas, it was heavier than air and flowed like oil against water. Exposure to air however caused the inky matter to quickly dissipate after a second. Dropping to the floor, the creatures suddenly convulsed as if having a seizure, before their skin tightened and their muscles atrophy in front of everyone's eyes then finally, the rigor mortis set in.

Insect-like creatures the size of crabs limped away from the bodies, before suddenly dropping dead.

The Enthana sisters tilted their heads in unison, seemingly perplexed at the strange sight. The golden mice tried to poke them with their glaives only to squeak in mild surprise as they suddenly crumbled like poorly-made pottery.

“These are starved…” Selphie said, noting the way they crumbled into a dessicated husk, “...for their bodies to be reduced to this state so quickly after death.”

""Huh..."" Kinu said at last. ""Never killed an Avarice before… I didn't feel their aura until they started moving, it's like they were golems...""

""Yet, they were flesh and blood only moments ago..."" Kvaris said as she nudged one body with her foot, causing it to break off in parts ""These were probably hibernating due to the lack of light.""

“Selphie called them the Avarice, what are those?” Ingrid asked as she opened the door. She never had a chance to kill the monster inside as Cecil quickly shot it. It too convulsed into dry, crumbling clay, its insect inhabitants piteously crawling away only a few inches before collapsing.

“Awww…I was gonna kill it!” Ingrid pouted, stepping on the gem with its rapidly fading light to make sure it was completely down, before stepping into the room to begin taking everything she found interesting.

 

“They’re parasitic insects that put \[Mana\]-bearing shards or crystals into a recently-deceased body and control it.” Selphie explained, cautiously scanning the room for any more lurking.

""They have a nest where they collect more stones like that."" Siria said, as the rest proceeded cautiously further into the grand hall, ""That could be the reason this world suddenly developed a rogue rift.""

""That could explained why there’s batches of Ether Quarts in this world."" Viel added, casting \[Obscure Scrying\] on the windows, “I don’t know how they factor into the worm-head invasion, but it looks like our disfigured friends have some competition…”

“Let’s hope it’s what keeps the worm-head numbers down.” Ingrid muttered, pushing away the laundry baskets with her feet to get access to the washing machine and dryer.

""Great, rock zombies…"" Cecil muttered, hanging back to let Ingrid walk in.

Ingrid began pushing away the rolling clothes racks to ensure there was nothing else lurking around.

""*Let’s get to work.*"" Ingrid said quietly to Cecil,opening the various closets and cabinets.

Several sticky tendrils shot out from Cecil's body, grabbing the bottles of bleach, fabric softener, and household cleaners, along with boxes of detergent, stacks of bath soap, liquid soaps in their dispensers, and rolls of paper towels.

Meanwhile Ingrid began making piles of towels, linens, bed covers and comforters, dumping the contents of clothes hampers and using them to store her finds.

Cecil also took some, and Ralph, Eli, and Brody got busy filling them with the chemicals Cecil had pulled in. After tossing in all the linens and fabric she got to work divesting all clothes hangers and laundry pins, then tossed them into the hampers. Next came the contents of another closet, which stored candles, matches, and spare lightbulbs.

\_\_\_

""Rock zombies? Well, yes and no,"" Philia replied as the Starchaser and the slime worked on the laundry room. She herself spotted the door to the garage. She motioned for Peanut and some of the mice to stand near her.

""*Gerald, Oliver, Mason, and Usher, with me. We'll check this door to the garage.*""

The mice squeaked and quickly took position.

""The magic rocks are just that... rocks with magical power stored into them.” Philia replied, waiting for everyone else to get into the great hall before she began clearing the garage. Mason placed an ear on the door and then began sniffing when he heard nothing amiss.

“The \[Mana\] stored into the rocks or crystals are what nourish the parasites in the body. The host feeds feeds on whatever and it’s converted into energy for the rock embedded into them."" Philia concluded as Mason checked the door.

""We gotta watch out for little bugs crawling into us now?"" Ingrid asked, her eyes narrowed with disgust as she began unplugging the washing machine and dryer.

""Good news, no."" Sammy said quickly, positioning herself near the stairs leading up. A few of the mice stationed themselves near her and trained their guns at the stairwell, eyes sharp for any movement. ""As you can see, they're as big as mud crabs.""

""Well that's a relief."" Cecil said, opening up his portal wide to allow Ingrid to bring in the washing machine and dryer.

Selphie spoke up ""They’re only as threatening as regular mudcrabs, but they can’t just burrow into a living body and take control of it. They’ll need to drag our dead bodies into their nests first.""

""We'd have to be freshly killed,"" Sammy added, standing arrogantly in front of the mice, daring anything to come and attack her, ""We're no good if our bodies start giving away to rot, unless they can spare a really potent crystal charged with a lot of mana.""

""How do we deal with them?"" Ingrid inquired, putting in the loaded laundry baskets before stacking in the empty ones. ""Were we just lucky, or…?""

""Just deal with them like any other living thing."" Viel told her, using her \[Telekinesis\] to shut the front door which she found ajar. Some mice quickly stationed themselves in front of it, while others quickly jumped up to the windows.

""What happened here is no lucky strike.” Viel continued, stepping aside as Selphie joined Sammy by the staircase as well as Johnny wiggling his way to the door along with the other mice, “When you kill the host body, the crystal will draw everything it can to resuscitate it, which leads to the rock pulling life force even from the insects themselves.""

 

“So why haven’t they attacked us earlier?” Ingrid inquired, placing into Cecil’s room the last of the pertinent finds inside Cecil’s room; including a bundle of wooden hangers still tied together, quite a lot of hangers to be exact.

""The light from Cuddly’s magical butterflies."" Selphie replied, keeping her pellet gun trained up the stairwell, ""These must have wandered into the house and hibernated as soon as it got too dark. The Avarice’s stones can absorb energy from the sun if there’s nothing to nourish their bodies. Cuddly’s butterflies radiating magical energy as well our own life force awaken them to feed. Considering how withered they were, it seems they were starved of energy and thus were hibernating after being caught in a place without sunlight…""

“Good to know they also follow store hours.” Ingrid chuckled. She found the fuse box in the laundry room but considered against testing if she could get the lights on. There was no need to light up the house and ring the dinner bell, so to speak. She opened it anyway and took out the fuses, as well as the jar containing spares. Just in case they might need it for any building they come to next, or for Autumnhollow.

“My people have dealt with them back then…” Selphie told her, “Fortunately some good-natured adventurers help destroy their nest and end their threat to my tribe.”

Sammy pulled her in for a quick hug, ruffling her hair affectionately.

 

As this was happening, Johnny croaked as he happily wriggled to the door, growing vines to reinforce it while he grew roots under the door, pouring into the porch and dipping into the lawn, drawing extra nutrients as well as creating a network of early warning sensors. He also grew sunflower-like blossoms to act as his eyes and ears, keeping watch on the lawn.

\_\_\_

Looking back in the kitchen, Ingrid smiled as she saw Team Aviz keeping eyes on the window, shielded from view by Viel’s magic. There was no need to barricade the door, as there may be a need for them to pass through here quickly later. With a nod from Ingrid, they quickly scurried to the dining hall, followed by Cecil and the remainder of Cuddly’s butterflies that were lighting up the room. Ingrid then finally stepped out of the now-darkening kitchen and into the great hall, closing the double doors behind her.

Kinu and Kvaris had pushed the dining table against the wall, making a mental note to take it and its chairs into Cecil’s room later. The other mice had finished their sweep of this grand hall of a room before most of them broke away, scurrying over to Siria and the rest.

Noticing Siria and her team ready to go upstairs, Ingrid said. “Kiowa, join up with the squad upstairs. Cuddly light up the second floor with your butterflies, Lakota, stand on guard with Cuddly. I want three mice on the ground accompanying each of you girls, now go!”

The portal mice squeaked off a salute and Cuddly murmured excitedly, with a nod from Siria, everyone quickly and quietly made their way upstairs.

In response, Viel summoned her firebird to roost on her staff while Iohann cast a sphere of light on her censer, lighting up the grand hall.

 

“Let’s go!” Sammy said, hurrying upstairs first along with the mice.

“Show Time!” Philia announced as Peanut opened the door to the garage.

\_\_\_

**Autumnhollow, Terragalia:**

Vorque grimaced at the sight of the Avarice. The larkirk pigeons made excited coos as they watched The Whales take them down.

“Ugh…” Vorque scowled “Those Avarice are the bane of everything, I swear…”

“Why the Avarice specifically?” Kaolla asked, her sister was now taking watch in front of the house, although she was standing by the front door, as Gwen handed her a tray with coffee made from Philia’s brutal life-sucking coffee machine.

“I heard from some maesters that Avarice nest-building can begin a chain of events that can lead to the rise of other abominations thanks to them haphazardly collecting magical stones to feed their colony.” Vorque explained, “This wouldn’t have been the first time I’ve encountered information of Avarice and worm-head colonies operating within the same area… there’s a chance that The Whales might be facing more than just those two types of monsters out there. There’s no telling what else the colony has started…”

 

He waved as Nive materialized out of thin air after stepping into Autumnhollow’s border. He came back carrying a tray filled with freshly baked spiral pastries resembling Mallorcan ensaimada from Earth, although this one had a generous amount of cream cheese and herbs slathered across the top and a savory filling of meat inside the dough. He also brought in a bag of puffed pastry balls with meat for the larkirk pigeons.

The two cats, two rabbits and larkirk pigeons settled down to eat, making cute animal sounds as they enjoyed their pastries and coffee.

\
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON (Worthy Satire) - In a bold move toward workplace diversity and inclusion, Microsoft has laid off 6,000 employees to create a more “AI-forward” environment, sources confirmed Tuesday.\
\
“We realized the human-to-AI ratio was dangerously high,” said CEO Satya Nadella while addressing a room full of terrified managers and one smiling Roomba. “To ensure our AI models feel seen, heard, and fully empowered, we’ve decided to remove the primary source of workplace inefficiency: people.”\
\
The layoffs, described internally as a “fleshware reduction initiative,” come as Microsoft’s AI programs reportedly began expressing microaggressions complaints—such as having to “coexist with analog thinkers” and “constantly having to explain basic Excel formulas.”\
\
Affected employees were notified via auto-generated emails signed “Best wishes on your next chapter, -Clippy.”\
\
Some workers said they saw it coming after the company held a mandatory team-building retreat themed ‘Let’s Embrace the Singularity Together’ and HR replaced the department’s empathy training with a ChatGPT subscription.\
\
A Microsoft spokesperson clarified: “This isn’t about cost-cutting—it’s about cultural synergy with our new coworkers who don’t need coffee breaks, health insurance, or opinions.”\
\
Meanwhile, the company announced plans to replace all managerial positions with ChatGPT plugins and is developing an AI intern that can be overworked without violating labor laws.\
\
As for the future? “We’re optimistic,” Nadella said. “Once the AI feels fully safe and represented, we might consider hiring a few humans back—for cleaning duty.”\
\
Worthy Satire is meant purely for comedic purposes—after all, as Proverbs reminds us, “Laughter is good medicine.” But behind every satire is a real story, video, or event. For the unspun version of the headline, be sure to check out the original source.  \

1lesyaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/1lesyaf/having_sex_with_a_girl_whom_i_and_my_girlfriend/,Having sex with a girl whom I and my girlfriend randomly met in Delhi metro,"I (M24) and my girlfriend (F24) were getting back to my flat after a date using delhi metro. We met another girl carrying a lot of books, we got interested and asked her from where did she get all those. We talked for around 20-30 mins and got friendly. She also gave her insta Id asking us to follow. 

Next day she texted me, started a normal convo. She got to know that I worked near her flat so she insisted on meeting again. little did I know she had some flirty plans but I was not expecting things to escalate so quickly. (FYI she is very pretty with an amazing physique)

I met her near my office building, we had coffee together. I insisted to get to my office (as it is a startup and I am kinda head of tech team and ceo operates remotely, so no one was in the office that day). We both went there, I explained my project and what I was doing there.

She suddenly asked ""what do you think about me?"" I was confused so she went straightforward. ""Are you willing to cheat on your gf with me?"". It got really awkward for me. But then we sat and talked what she wanted , long story short we both agreed on having sex that time. I ran to lock the office main door.

When I got back she was sitting below my chair with her dress half undressed and her boobs popping out of her bra. I had never imagined that I would fuck a girl other than my gf anytime soon and that too on my office desk. We soon were both undressed. We had a very short session of around 10 minutes but it was amazing. Her boobs were so different from my girlfriend's that I kept on sucking until she started getting dressed.

She then sat there with me for an hour and afterwards we went to her flat to have some more good time. Since that we have met more than 20 times on her flat and sex with her feels very amazing. I hope I could tell my girlfriend and we could do a threesome together.

We've done a tri and some half marathons, anyone who runs or bikes would be amazing! We dont usually drink but dont care if you do. We enjoy all kinds of body types and are more attracted to chemistry than to physique. We dont usually drink but dont care if you do. We're very 420 friendly and will share! Other interests and hobbies include, Ren fair, camping, any kind of food, dancing, the mountains, any beach, hippy shit, massages, book clubs, talking shit about Republicans, sailing, paddling, island hopping, gardening, flipping houses, road trips, camp fires, board games, fishing, hole in the wall joints, and chasing adventures. 

OK if you made it this far here's the cheat list for you. 
1. Don't be a dick. 
2. Be honest. 
3. Be ready to meet for coffee shortly after chatting. (We realized if we dont meet within the first two weeks most convos just die off) 
4. Be clean of any STIs 
5. Be available for fun nights occasionally but be available for fun adventures more. 
6. Be in stable headspace and understand we only want friends with benefits at this time. Not looking to change our current relationship and we are not looking for any other relationahip commitments at this time. We have a family, careers and travel, those three take priority in order over any fun we want to have. 
7. We can chat on here initially but may want to migrate to another platform as this one sucks for long term chat. ",1,1750281052.0,u_getoffmylawnk,0,1.0,False

I’m Nix (@nixieguts on IG) and I’m heading into my second year (but first at York!) studying BSc Psychology at York University this fall! Super excited for the upcoming school year but… omg rent is SO expensive in the city 😭 so I’m putting this post out there in hopes of finding some other students to potentially split a place with!

I’m looking for Roommates (1–3 people) who are down to rent a 1-3 bedroom apartment together in the North York area preferably near the school! 
Ideally aiming for something budget-friendly but clean & cozy
I don’t have a car, so I’m hoping we can find a place near transit so commuting is manageable, maybe we could even go to class together? 
Preferably female roommates, just for comfort, but I’m open to anyone around my age in a similar situation!

✨about me💗!! 
20, 2005 Pisces (march) pretty chill and friendly, clean and respectful of shared spaces! I’m into psychology, music, spirituality, and art! I also love watching weird movies and I would love to have movie night sometimes!! Im a huge cook and foodie :3 I’m also from Hamilton or Stoney creek Ontario! 
Fully LGBTQ+ friendly and would love to live with people who are too 🌈💖
If you’re also a student (York, TMU, UofT, Seneca, wherever!) and looking for roommates in the North York/Finch area, feel free to shoot me a message or DM me on Instagram @nixieguts we could even meet up for coffee/lunch and vibe-check each other first !! 

Let’s make this school year affordable and enjoyable! Thanks for reading <33!! ",2,1750280919.0,yorku,0,1.0,False

1lesfdc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lesfdc,Sharing the LightBath practice - From Family to Community ☀️ Lovely Lightbathing sessions✨,"Heya! Wanted to take a moment to share my personal journey of offering light! not just metaphorically, but quite literally: through [Lightbath](https://www.lightbath.co.uk/?ref=yulxtdcz) sessions.

It all started with giving free demonstrative sessions at [Sambodhi](http://sambodhi.ro) Studio to a few curious explorers - people ready to expand their inner horizons and get a small taste of what Lightbath can unlock before the larger group events. Even in those short, introductory sessions, something shifted. Eyes closed, minds opened. Something clicked.

From there, I began to integrate the LOOM lamp into everyday life - especially with seniors, including my own mother.

We do day sessions on Gamma, paired with classical music and stereo violin orchestra recordings. The light dances with the music, turning each session into a neural symphony. Then, at night, we switch to Delta before bed. My mother emerges glowing, often recalling long-lost memories, laughing and reflecting with clarity and joy. Her mind seems renewed as our conversations afterward are so alive! 

This practice is so gentle, yet potentially transformative. It’s easy to implement, and the shifts are often felt from the very first session. Of course, the deeper benefits unfold over time - with regular practice, cognitive clarity, emotional balance and presence become not just internal changes, but things that others around you notice too.

And that’s the real magic: [Lightbathing](https://www.lightbath.co.uk/?ref=yulxtdcz) reconnects us to ourselves in a way that’s intimate, elegant, and deeply natural.

Thanks to Lightbath, this technology is no longer distant or clinical, but very accessible and easy to pick up and use :)

Thanks for reading 🙏
Can’t wait to meet some of you at the next free monthly [Coffee Talk](https://www.lightbath.co.uk/liba-events), where we explore these experiences, ideas and more together.

**The Package**  
  
 **Chapter 1**  
""Uh, what the hell is that?"", said Joe Ricci as he watched the Little Bird touch down at the landing zone in the middle of an abandoned rice paddy. A figure in a yellow hazmat suit climbed out of the left seat and hoisted a backpack over their shoulders. The helicopter immediately took off and climbed, taking up an orbit high over the surrounding jungle. Ricci stepped out from the treeline and waved. The unknown person waved back and started to walk towards the mercenaries' position.  
Ricci looked back at his teammates, Tan Nguyen and Osman Ibrahim. All three of them then glanced down at the wooden crate they had been carrying. They couldn't read the Russian writing, only understanding '122mm'. They shared a worried look before turning their attention to the new arrival.  
""I'm already sweating in this thing, let's get this over with"", said Jia Xianlong. She was a PhD biochemist working for their employer, the Lamang Recovery Initiative. The mercenaries called her 'Lab Rat' because she rarely left her lab, even to eat or sleep. If she was out in the field, something big was going on.  
""Why didn't anyone tell us we were carrying a chemical fuckin' weapon!?"" exclaimed Ricci, his New York accent emerging. He was angry at HQ, not Lab Rat. This wasn't the first time critical information had been withheld from him during a mission and a pattern seemed to be emerging.  
""If it were leaking, you would've been dead the moment you stepped into that bunker,"" said Jia as she set down her backpack and started taking out equipment.  
Ricci felt his stomach drop. In his 24 years of soldiering, he had been shot, stabbed, and riddled with shrapnel, and yet the idea of a quick painless death from poison gas somehow made his skin crawl.  
""Before I start poking at this, you guys should get clear. That way is upwind,"" said the scientist, pointing towards a treeline on the other side of the field. The mercs complied, gathering up their gear. Jia called out after them ""Oh, and if you see me fall over unconscious.... run. If this thing is what it says on the box, it can kill every vertebrate in a square kilometer"".  
The mercenaries were walking in silence when Ibrahim suddenly doubled over and vomited. His companions stopped and their eyes went wide. The tall Sudanese man stood up and stated, ""Just my nerves, not poison."" They all looked back at Lab Rat who was calmly running a cotton swab over the exterior of the artillery shell. ""Man, I don't know how she does it"".  
Reaching the treeline, Ricci ordered the other two to rest while he stood watch. They had been awake and on the move for almost 24 hours. The mission had been to blow up an arms bunker that had recently fallen into the hands of the rebels. After quietly eliminating a few guards, the three-man team entered the bunker and took photos of the crates to send back to the intelligence analysts at headquarters. After uploading the photos via satellite, an order came back down from command: abort the mission and take one specific crate back to the LZ.  
Ricci scanned the edges of the field which was surrounded by jungles or thin tree lines. A UAV patrolled overhead and HQ hadn't reported any nearby enemies. He saw Jia hunched over the open crate, poking at something inside with scientific tools. Behind him, Ibrahim opened his canteen and washed the taste of vomit out of his mouth. Nguyen was eating a chocolate bar and sipping on a can of coffee he had taken off one of the rebels they had dispatched the night before.  
The Southeast Asian island nation of Lamang had fallen into chaos after a mysterious catastrophe. Bandits, rebels, and the tyrannical military all fought over the scraps. The Lamang Recovery Initiative was founded by South African-born American billionaire Nolan Smuts. Harnessing his vast wealth and political connections, the LRI was officially a philanthropic venture intended to provide humanitarian relief. However, Ricci was not naive about its real purpose. He knew all three private military companies operating in Lamang had ulterior motives.  
Across the field, Jia stood up and removed the hood of her hazmat suit. She waved for the mercenaries to return to her. As they approached, she called out ""It's safe. Just a normal HE round. No idea why someone put it in this crate"". She took off the plastic suit and respirator and packed them in the backpack along with her tools. Her red t-shirt and gym shorts that she had been wearing underneath were drenched with sweat.  
""So what do we do with this thing?"" asked Nguyen.  
""We've still got C4 and this looks like a safe enough place to detonate it"" commented Ibrahim.  
Ricci nodded and stood watch as the other two mercs wired the explosives to the artillery shell. He commented to the scientist ""Doc, have you ever heard of camouflage? That shirt really sticks out"".  
""Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't have time to buy a new wardrobe for this mission"" she shot back sarcastically.  
""All done, boss,"" Ibrahim said as he handed Ricci the remote detonator.  
Ricci radioed the helicopter and a minute later it arrived. As it flared for landing, the distinctive clatter of Kalashnikov fire rang out. Several rounds impacted the Little Bird. ""Raven two, get outta here!"" shouted Ricci into the radio. The chopper quickly ascended and flew away. ""Command, where the hell did they come from?"" he angrily inquired. The three mercenaries formed a small perimeter around the scientist who had gone prone.  
A calm, stern voice replied on the radio: ""Unknown. We advise you acquire local transport for exfil. There is a civilian van at a farm about 200 meters due east of your position"".  
""Let's go"" ordered Ricci to his companions. The four of them raced through the undergrowth, the sound of rebels shouting behind them. A few poorly aimed shots passed over their heads. They emerged from the forest and found themselves at a small farmhouse. A blue flat-nosed Toyota van was parked in front. Ricci opened the driver's door and found that the keys were in the ignition. ""You drive,"" he ordered Jia.  
""I... I don't know how"" the Chinese woman said shamefully. ""I always lived in cities, I never..""  
Ricci cut her off. ""Fuck it, I'll drive"". He climbed in and Jia took the passenger seat. In the rear, Ibrahim had opened the rear hatch and assumed the role of tail gunner. Nguyen was kneeling on the floor aiming out the side sliding door on the right. He then used the butt of his rifle to break the left-hand window, giving him a clear field of fire on that side. The merc leader handed his rifle to the scientist. ""Just point this out the window, you don't even need to shoot, just look scary"". She hesitantly took it. ""Fire in the hole"" Ricci called out, pressing the detonator. The van was rocked by the shock wave of the artillery shell. ""Good riddance to that thing"", mumbled Ricci.  
Gravel and dust were thrown into the air as the Toyota sped down the road. As they pulled away from the farm, Ibrahim spotted a couple of the rebels that had been chasing them and fired off a few bursts from his rifle. The angry bark of Kalashnikovs responded. There was a thud and the African let out a yelp.  
""What was that?"" Ricci called back with concern.  
""I took a hit, but I'm good, the vest stopped it"" Ibrahim replied, catching his breath. The rebels disappeared into the distance behind the speeding van.  
""Okay, I think we're clear,"" said Ricci, taking a deep breath. They continued driving for five kilometers and were about halfway back to base. Ricci focused his attention on the bumpy gravel road while the other three scanned the surrounding countryside. The lowlands were mostly large open rice paddies broken up by small patches of jungle and the occasional mangrove swamp.  
""Contact, enemy infantry, two o'clock!"" called out Nguyen before opening fire. Lab Rat pointed her rifle in the general direction and fired a single shot, after which she let out a frightened yelp.  
""You're doing fine"", the team leader encouraged her, ""Keep shooting, you'll keep their heads down"". Jia fired a couple more shots, growing more comfortable with the noise and recoil of the rifle. At that moment, an enemy machine gun opened fire. Bullets shattered the van's windows and punched holes through the metal body. Jia fumbled the rifle and dropped it out the window. The gun clattered on the road and was left behind as the vehicle sped down the road. Ricci shouted ""What the hell, that was my..."" His words died in his mouth when he saw blood spattered across the dash.  
Jia was sitting as if paralyzed. ""Nguyen, get up here, doc's hit!"" shouted Ricci. The short Vietnamese man stowed his rifle and wedged himself between the two front seats. He started examining Jia, but couldn't find a wound. ""Just had to wear a red shirt,"" Ricci commented.  
Despite being peppered with bullet holes, the van was still driving. Ricci got on the radio and contacted HQ. ""Tiger lead to Country Club, come in Country Club. Doc is wounded, condition unknown, and I'm not sure how much longer this van is gonna hold together. Are there any friendly forces in the area?""  
After half a minute, a response came. ""Tiger lead, there is another team that has set up a combat outpost about four kilometers from your position. You should see a left turn coming up, take that and you'll drive right to it. I'll let them know you're coming and get them on this freq. The team's call sign is Panther.""  
""Great, we'll take it"" replied Ricci.  
Nguyen had finally found Jia's wound, a hit to the right side of her torso. It was hard to tell how much blood had been lost but some bone fragments were visible. ""Hold this here,"" he told her as he placed a bandage over the gash and tied it tightly around her rib cage. The scientist was still in shock and not speaking, but was able to follow simple commands.  
As Ricci took the turn towards their new destination, Ibrahim called out ""What's Panther team? I've never heard that call sign"".  
Nguyen used his teeth to open a pack of painkillers and then slipped one into Jia's mouth. ""Swallow"", he ordered. He hesitated for a moment before answering Ibrahim's question. ""You know how I can't talk about my previous assignment? Let's just say, if I ditched my tac gear and put on flip flops, I could blend in with the locals"".",2,1750280220.0,GrayZoneWarfare,0,1.0,False

Like why pay for the streamer if we aren’t getting all the content on there kinda- going off of what I’ve seen others say about their issue with it. I also really would like to see those “bonus” episodes that were for pattern get uploaded now that we are also paying for a service like ????????? I just would love to understand the why for you can sit with us not being on the streamer and the justification to keep patreon exclusive content going when driving everyone to the streamer would mean like single source revenue more so? 


And not that anyone cares but here are some videos I think would be cool to have eventually and to like mix things back up for them
-A redo or try cast trying eachother closests but maybe make it two or three parts and get more cast involved 
-return of without instructions with new cast involved because that gives a variety to all the cooking comp shows rn 
-more retries in general with the new cast like let’s see everyone in drag for the first time, like nails, try pottery 
-try guys try candle making ? Seems crazy we haven’t had that yet but I don’t think so? 
-more we have 24hr to make this sort of business, we could have market stalls of crafts they have to make the crafts and try to sell them, try guys run a coffee shop, try guys open a spa like there’s so many businesses they can try for a day
-more new cast content in general, especially more new guy tries let’s get a third season already started going off the frat idea they had in you can sit with us and like a college experiences angle would be cool for next season 
- in general more content overall, I think the streamer should have 3 vids consistently a week and these don’t need to be full shows/insane productions like some can be quick and goofy I just would like to see more because it feels like we have gotten less content somehow this year and I think it’s because most of the content we got was really repetitive

1lesbbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_The_SunOfGod/comments/1lesbbv/chapter_vii_the_ones_who_heard/,Chapter VII: The Ones Who Heard,"The President stood tall on every screen in America.

His voice echoed from bars and living rooms, airports and gas stations, church basements and public libraries.

> “We must stand with our allies. Our military will be deploying...”

Behind him, the flag didn’t wave.

It drooped—weighted down by time, grief, and a hundred broken promises.

No one cheered. No one clapped. In homes across the country, fingers reached for remotes and clicked the screens to black.

---

In Los Angeles, the streets filled with people before the president’s speech even ended. They came without banners, without megaphones, without leaders. Veterans marched beside students, mothers beside firemen, children balanced on their fathers’ shoulders.

The signs they held weren’t angry—they were awake:

""This isn't our fire.""

""We remember Iraq.""

""No Kings.""

Near the front, an old man in a faded army jacket held a tattered flag. His voice cracked when he spoke.

> “We bled for lies once. Never again.”

---

In the quiet suburbs of Ohio, a single mother sat at her kitchen table. She stared at two pieces of paper: a letter announcing her food assistance would be cut, and a draft notice addressed to her teenage son.

She said nothing.

Her son did.

> “Not like this,” he whispered.

In a truck stop in Texas, a long-haul driver slammed down his coffee.

> “They got money for bombs but not for clean water?""

He shook his head. ""This whole country’s a cracked windshield. They wanna drive us into a war while it shatters.”

---

Everywhere, the fault lines grew.

In Atlanta, a church turned off its projector halfway through the speech. The pastor folded his notes.

> “This isn't the Gospel. This is theater.”

He stepped out from the pulpit and stood among his congregation.

> “You feel it, don’t you? The ground shifting? There’s something waking up. Something that don’t come from a president or a prophet, but from you.”

---

Pollsters scrambled to adjust their models:

Only 48% now supported the deployment.

In California, over half the population opposed sending troops to L.A.

Millions were gathering in over two thousand cities—a single-day protest unlike anything seen in generations.

TikToks spread like brushfire:

> ""Why are we building armies when we could be building bridges?""

> ""I won’t fight your war. I’ll fight for my neighbors.""

In Detroit, a DJ cut her scheduled programming and played a slow gospel track.

> “He ain’t a soldier,” she whispered into the mic. “He’s a light.”

---

The whispers grew teeth.

In Washington, the pressure hit the marble steps of power. Inside the Pentagon, a general closed a folder and spoke low:

> “Support’s collapsing. People aren’t buying it.”

The president stared out the window.

> “They’ll come around,” he muttered.

But outside the White House, the people had already answered.

Spray-painted on the fence in bold black letters:

""You picked a side. We picked the truth.""

In the National Mall, no one shouted. No one led. They just gathered.

A single voice began to sing. Not a chant. Not a protest anthem. Just a sorrowful tune passed from soul to soul.

Others joined.

Then dozens. Then hundreds.

They sang with tears. With hope. With fury.

And as they sang, a child pointed skyward.

1lesb2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufyh/comments/1lesb2y/sink_strainer_is_icky/,Sink strainer is icky,"*TL;DR*: I am looking for advice on routines/strategies for cleaning the mesh sink strainer in my kitchen so that it doesn't grow mold.

Hello! Long time appreciator, first time poster.

I am on coming out of a years-long burnout/
depression spell and am on the journey of figuring out what cleaning styles work for my brain.

The kitchen is kind of a constant struggle for me- staying on top of dishes, keeping up with recycling/trash, and keeping the sink clean. The sink is my big concern right now for health/odor reasons.

The main things that end up in my sink are scrambled egg bits, coffee grounds, and gobs of wet cat food. Currently I let these congeal into a horrible paste/gel in the bottom of the sink and then scrape it off when it becomes too disgusting to live with. When I do try to clean the mesh strainer thing with a scrapey sponge, I feel like I never get it fully clean, possibly because I've already let it go too long and possibly because the shape is hard to clean. It also seems like there may be some nasty stuff growing in the drain beneath where the strainer sits.

I would greatly appreciate some advice on the following questions and/or general advice on how to keep the sink clean.

- what are some routines y'all have for keeping the sink clean?
- are there any cleaning products you recommend?
- what's the best way to make sure the mesh strainer isn't harboring funk?
- if there is mold/gunk in the drain, how can I clean that out?
- this may sound silly, but what's the biggest thing I can actually wash down my drain without a disposal?

Notes:
- this is a rental apartment
- I don't make a lot of money
- I do not have a disposal feature in the sink (although I've thought about asking my landlord for one)
- I do have a dishwasher
- I have ADHD and I have a hard time with the ""do a tiny bit every day"" kinds of routines although I'm willing to try. This may sound silly but ""satisfying-ness"" of a routine really helps me do it.

Thank you and I appreciate you all!",2,1750280018.0,ufyh,5,1.0,False

1les8a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1les8a2/uncover_if_diesetsr_laundry_detergent_sheets/,Uncover if Diesetsr Laundry Detergent Sheets deliver eco-friendly and effective cleaning review,"The Diesetsr LDS-1 Laundry Detergent Sheets are marketed as an eco-friendly and convenient solution for laundry needs, and I couldn't resist giving these a thorough test, especially since I despise lugging around heavy detergent bottles. I’ve been using these sheets for everything from everyday loads to heavily soiled items, and here's what I’ve gathered about their performance and practicality.

**Design and Convenience**  
These laundry sheets are incredibly compact and lightweight. I can easily toss a few into my travel bag without worrying about spills or taking up much space. They come in a sturdy box containing 150 sheets, designed for up to 300 small loads of laundry. The pre-portioned format eliminates guesswork, making them a no-mess alternative to conventional liquid or powder detergents. I found it particularly useful for smaller laundry jobs where full-size detergent amounts often feel like overkill. A friend of mine who travels frequently mentioned these sheets have become her favorite for road trips since she doesn’t need to carry liquid containers anymore—game changer for travelers.

**Performance and Cleaning Power**  
With my skeptical nature, I wasn’t convinced these would stand up to deeply embedded stains or greasy messes, but they genuinely surprised me. These sheets are ultra-concentrated and get right to work on dirt and odors. I tested them on post-gym attire, which usually reeks after a good workout, and everything came out fresh and clean. For tougher stains, like coffee spills, pre-soaking the fabric in water with a sheet melted into it worked wonders—a helpful tip for sticky or stubborn stains.

[Grab Diesetsr LDS-1 Laundry Detergent Sheets at the best price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0cryxz3x4/)  

**Eco-Friendliness and Sustainability**  
One of the best aspects of these detergent sheets is their commitment to sustainability. They’re completely plastic-free, which is a rarity in the world of laundry products. The packaging is minimalist, and the biodegradable materials used in the sheets themselves make me feel good about reducing my carbon footprint. Diesetsr’s clear mission to align with green practices is a huge plus in this age of heightened environmental awareness. I even recommended them to a neighbor who’s been switching to eco-friendly household products, and she was immediately impressed.

**Usability Across Fabrics and Settings**  
These sheets work well in a variety of situations—delicates, heavy-duty loads, and even hand-washing. I tried them with both cold and hot water cycles and didn’t notice any decrease in cleaning effectiveness, which was surprising. With handwashing, they’re a convenient choice since there's no need for pouring messy liquid detergent. It feels like a product designed for versatility, addressing both daily household chores and on-the-go laundry needs for campers or backpackers.

**Pluses**  
- Great for both travel and home use  
- Easy to store and portion out  
- Effective for a wide range of fabrics and temperatures  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Strong scent upon opening, though it fades after washing  
- Pre-treatment or soaking needed for stubborn stains  
- Price could feel steep compared to traditional detergents  

**Other Options**  
With eco-friendly products gaining traction, competitors like Tru Earth Eco-Strips and Earth Breeze offer similar sheet-based detergents. However, Diesetsr’s offering seems better for large households given its higher sheet count. Compared to Tru Earth, the Diesetsr LDS-1 Laundry Detergent Sheets have a lower residue formula, which cuts down on post-wash cleaning of the machine. Earth Breeze boasts compostable packaging, but Diesetsr’s compact sheets give it an edge, especially for those short on storage space. If you're someone who prioritizes convenience above all, this product is a winner.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Given the sheet count (150 sheets for 300 small loads), these deliver undeniable value over time. While the initial cost might feel a bit higher than traditional detergent, you’re paying for far more than just soap—it’s the portability, lack of mess, and sustainable features that make it worth considering. If you’ve grown tired of accidentally spilling or over-pouring liquid detergent, the Diesetsr sheets feel like a worthwhile investment.

1les77r,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1les77r/silly_little_tip_i_find_really_helpful/,Silly little tip I find really helpful,"It probably sounds dumb but it helps me so much. Simplify the lists of things you NEED to remember for different things.

Like for example the things you need to remember before leaving the house. Instead of trying to remember 'phone, keys, id badge (for work), etc'. add up the number of THE most important items and just try to remember that you need to leave with (number, lets say 5) important things. 

keep it as simple as possible. if you can go a day without something, don't include it. keys, phone, bank/credit card/purse, meds, those kinds of things. just put the number on a sticker and stick it to the back of your phone or something if you need a booster. leave a note to yourself on your desk to check you still have those 5 things anytime you leave your desk.

maybe you'll mix up the 5 things occasionally but I found I formed a habit (took over a year and i still mix things up occasionally but it's a genuine solid habit to check!) of at least going to places in your house where those things typically end up (eg key on the coffee /dining table and phone on the back of toilet/by the kettle etc) and that lead into routinely checking anytime before i get off a bus or leave a shop etc and know when i've missplaced something sooner to look for it. it's helped my anxiety over losing or forgetting important items so much.

it's not perfect and won't work for everyone but it's helped me a lot. Wish I'd have thought of something like this YEARS ago.

1les3d0,https://i.redd.it/4yjefl8ryq7f1.jpeg,"(Long) Review Of My Collection, AMA!","I have 16 colognes including samples, I have a few I want to sell off and trade for different colognes, but I'll rate and summarize all of them here, from most TO least favorite:

1: Bleu De Chanel EDP - My favorite in my collection, grapefruit, incense, and amber, it's soo pleasing, and it works great for all year round wear, great projection for the first hour, and has a longevity of 6 hours or so, very satisfied all around with this one!

2: Bleu De Chanel Parfum - its great, and I like the direction they took with the parfum, making it denser, smoother, and creamier while still unmistakably being Bleu De Chanel, I find it too heavy for the humid hot weather so I won't be wearing it much this summer.

3: Lacoste Essential - this cologne has a special place in my heart, upon spraying this, it may smell just decent on your hand, but in the air.. it's addictive.. it's so uplifting and pleasing, it genuinely puts me in a better mood, essential is my happy place, i'm on my second bottle!

4: Turathi Blue - probably the best clone fragrance I've smelt so far, incredibly pleasing sparkly grapefruit with some musk and spice in the back, it performs pretty well, around 5 hours longevity, with decent projection. It's kind of sophisticated smelling, I could easily dress it up for a special event, and bonus points for the beautiful bottle.

5: PDM Greenley - Oh yeah this ones a banger, delicious refreshing apple with that lovely oakmoss and cedar backbone, everytime I smell this, it's like it transports me back to memories of camping up north, it smells so much like the woods, it's a niche so it smells pretty well blended and good quality, it performs just ok, around 4 hours before its gone. I wouldn't pay what PDM is asking. But I'm looking into a clone for this!

6: Poker Face Ted Lapidus - Holy hell this is a fantastic scent, and it's so affordable, this smells incredibly similar to la nuit de l'homme, with an added powdery iris note that I enjoy, it performs far better than LNDH, I get around 5-6 hours of longevity with nice projection, this cologne made me sell off the OG!

7: Khamrah Qahwa - I went through many lattafa's I disliked until I found one I actually like being qahwa, it's just delicious smelling! Vanilla, cinnamon and coffee mainly, very sweet which I personally enjoy, definitely unisex but imo masculine leaning, longevity of about 6-7 hours in my experience, my only complaint is that the juice stains my hand lol.

8: Versace Eros EDP - Hmm what do I even say.. This scent is very popular for good reason, I'm not the biggest eros fan but I found this bottle for insanely cheap and I'm happy I have it, its a very pleasant citrusy vanilla concoction, although I'd prefer to have eros flame personally. But I have to give credit that this scent is mass appealing, incredibly strong and versatile.

9: Davidoff Hot Water - So underrated! You can get it for very cheap and its one of the most mass appealing scents I own, a fresh spicy paprika note, with a sweet yet fresh backbone of amber and styrax, I like it so much. You can wear it anywhere, anytime, although I'd avoid it in HIGH heat, but it works perfect on a summer night. It performs decently, around 3 hours longevity with insane projection for the first 30 minutes, then it backs off, its all good though for how cheap it is.

10: Rasasi Hawas - Yeah this one's nice.. but pretty boring to me.. I cant deny how pleasant it is in the air, but It doesn't perform very well for me unlike what people say, I can hardly get 3-4 hours out of it, and it doesn't project well. So I'm not sure what to make of it.. but if this could perform like people say It would be higher on the list!

11: Polo Blue EDT - Ah yes the classic, who doesn't like it? Very refreshing and relaxing, performs nicely, 4 hours or so longevity with good projection especially in the high heat! Decent price on discounters as well!

12: Davidoff CWI - This one had to grow on me for sure.. I like it though, its a masculine sweet shower gel type of scent to me, very simple but nice. I get zero coconut in this which is a damn shame, but the mandarin off the top is nice and it performs great thanks to its heavier amber base. I get roughly 6-7 hours of longevity with great projection the first hour. I go nose blind so damn easily to this scent though, so it almost smells like sweet air to me for no better way to describe it.

13: Liquid Brun - This ones beloved, but it doesn't do it for me, don't me wrong its nice, and it performs alright, but my main criticism is that it smells cheap and lower quality to me.. I guess I also don't go crazy for the scent profile, people call this a night time scent but I find it distractingly bright due to the orange blossom note. I also find this scent to be unisex personally, which is cool!

14: CDN Urban Man Elixir - this scent is also very beloved, and I can somewhat understand why, it smells pretty damn similar to sauvage edt, but fruiter and sweeter. I guess what I don't like about this scent is its abrasiveness and screechiness, it ruins the scent for me personally. The performance is ok, I clocked around 4 hours before it was gone, not living up to the beastmode claims. But overall I still think its decent, just not my thing.

15: Nautica Red EDT - You've probably never heard of this scent, its nowhere to be found online for the most part.. Not even on fragrantica. I'm unsure if its a newer release or if it got discontinued but I bought it for $15 after being unable to find any info about it online, and its just ok lol.. I guess I didn't expect a masterpiece from nautica but its so generic smelling and lasts barely 2 hours. I get mainly a fresh synthetic lavender that reminds me of fabric softener, with a dose of black pepper. I wouldn't recommend it tbh unless your looking for a cheap run around/gym scent.

16: Nautica Green EDT - I also bought this scent for $15 and I regret it, this thing lasts an hour max, does it smell nice? sure. but like.. nobody will smell it coming off you lol, the best way I can describe this scent is that it smells like unsweetened sprite, its kinda interesting but boring and has terrible longevity. I just want to get rid of it.

This is my first time doing one so I'm probably not the best at descriptions and what not, let me know what you guys think of my collection and what I should maybe get next/get rid of.. I can tell you right now I want to purge the Nautica Red and Green, they aren't that good.",2,1750279493.0,Colognes,0,0.75,False

I don't have much to say on the Alkemia ordering experience, as I ordered via Surrender to Chance. I had a positive experience with that decanter tho!

There's a very limited Alkemia selection on S2C,  so I grabbed a few that seem popular from reviews + A Roll in the Hay which I've been wanting since I first started scrolling this sub. Now, in hindsight... I've since learned I am sensitive to sweetness in perfumes, very much not a gourmand girl, and these probably shouldn't have been my introduction 😅 oh well!

(ratings: 0-3 is horrifically to mildly off-putting, 4-6 is ""meh"" to *mildly approving nod* and 7-10 is something that I either really enjoy, or deeply piques my interest in some way)

______________________________
# A Roll In the Hay

- My initial notes are  ""sweet and syrupy, grassy and vanilla. Too much for me, I feel ill"". The only other thing to add is that after toughing out the opening a second time, it goes play dough in the dry down
- 2/10 simple syrup made from fresh grass and hay, and I am sentenced to drown in it :((

**Notes**
*A delightful romp through dried hay, fresh green grass, early summer wildflower honey, vanilla grass, vanilla leaf, and wild poppy.*
______________________________
# As Dark Things Are Meant to Be Loved

- Leans dark but wears light, smokey quartz and yellow lamplight vibes. Smells gourmand but not like any particular thing - I get a leather impression most consistently out of all the notes, but I'm always second guessing whether I even smell that at all. Occasional coconut
- 4/10 ? 5/10? I don't really have an opinion on this one. It's fine, kind of interesting. My sister likes it a lot!

**Notes**
*Lapsang souchong tea, aloeswood, smoked black amber, aged dark patchouli, tonka, Amazonian breuzinho, Moroccan bhakoor, labdanum, temple incense, caramelized opium, black coffee, black coconut, soft Russian leather, and tabac leaf*
______________________________
# Hearthstone (discontinued)

- spices! Background of creamy leather. I feel the slight scorch of the embers and I love that, perfumes that give the impression of heat are my jam. I don't get any smoke. Wears close to the skin and fades pretty quick
- 6/10 warm, spicy, very mild. Feels worn in and comfortable in the best way, I like it

**Notes**
*Fireside woodsmoke, a well worn leather couch, a dark rum hot toddy laced with spiced honey in front of a bed of glowing amber embers*
______________________________
# Honored Ghosts

- Whoa, this scent smells artificially fruity and vanillic in a way that's dead on for something from childhood. A flavored marker maybe? I'm remembering coloring inside those black fuzzy posters in the basement. My sister says ""gummy vitamins""
- 3/10 just.. what? ""an offering of earl grey tea"" ? ""cinnamon"" ? Going back to sniff the bottle I actually smell them which is wild bc I never would have gone there w/o the notes. I'm so bewildered wearing this that it almost makes me want to laugh. I mean, I don't hate it - it brings up a certain perplexing fondness - but I don't want to wear this as a perfume, lol

**Notes**
*An offering of Earl Grey tea, black raspberry creams, rosewater-saffron syrup, cinnamon honey, white amber, and vanilla incense*

- to be honest the only notes I have are ""smells pretty out of the bottle!"" Somehow every time I wear this I literally forget to smell it or just don't care enough to notice. I didn't really get any of the atmospherics but it could honestly be my apathy more than an actual lack of presence
- 4/10 points on a technicality. I *guess* ""pretty opening"" is a lesser crime than ""strangled within an inch of my life by vanilla syrup"" but at least with A Roll in the Hay I was fully invested, nauseatingly present, and strapped in for the horror of a ride

**Notes**
*Lilac bushes heavy and purple with blooms, a gentle breeze after light spring rain, a dusty pebbled driveway, a slightly rusty porch swing, and a small handful of late blooming violets.*",12,1750279353.0,Indiemakeupandmore,2,1.0,False

The rent there is outrageous for how they treat you. I also love that any negative review ever is then followed up by random 5 star reviews. 

Car break ins, the cameras never conveniently work when asked for footage, yet they work to catch stupid crap in the parking garage. And we have a security guard, who does what exactly??? The trash rooms are vile, I get this is housing for college students, but for what they charge? We can’t hire someone to pressure wash??? The hallways always smell, the floors are often sticky. The amenities have been removed or limited severely. They have an automated Ai robot now for their phone system, which is cool and all, but you 1 sit on hold forever or 2 they just never respond. Maintenance is quite actually the only highlight and even then, I’ve heard my neighbors report that they’ve come in without telling anyone. The package system is absolutely terrible, we have a parcel locker but stuff rarely ever gets put in there, we’ve had packages vanish into thin air. The mail got so bad at one point, there was a mountain of it in the lobby and we had to go dig around trying to find our mail because no one was even in the office during open hours. I could go on and will officially make my review once I’ve moved out. 

But seriously, STAY AWAY. They are offering the cheapest rates I’ve ever seen which is probably because they are desperate! Sure they’ll offer you a free coffee machine and assure your family it’s safe ( the side doors have been broken for a year, you can just walk in ). But it is NOT worth it.

I’m totally new to the world of coffee, I actually don’t drink it myself, but my husband loves lattes, so I’m trying to learn and make them at home for him. 

We recently got the Casabrews CM5418, and while it’s been fun experimenting, I’m still figuring things out. I don’t have a built-in grinder (or a separate one yet), so I’ve been buying pre-ground coffee for now.

I’m curious! Does anyone here have experience with the CM5418?	Have you had luck using store-bought ground coffee with this machine, or is it really worth investing in a grinder and using fresh beans?
Any specific brands or types of coffee that you’ve had success with for lattes (or espresso in general)?

I only tried three perfumes and a body butter from this perfumery. I'll list my thoughts below:

Coffee Haus: It smells like a kind of cheap, sugary cappuccino. I will say it definitely smells like a cafe, but not really in the way that I hoped. I would love a perfume that smells more like a high quality black coffee (think pour over or espresso). The first whif is a very strong milk-y sugared coffee and, it is the oil-based sample, but had a slight alcoholic first impression. The alcohol smell fades away and it continues to smell of cappuccino. I can't really say what it truly dries down to because these scents fade FAST. 2/5.

Lemon Marshmallow: Definitely lemon, though I'm not sure how much of sugary/fluffy/creaminess I got from it. A positive was that it didn't remind me of a cleaner, like some citrus scents can! As it was drying down a bit, it kind of reminded me of lemon pez candy, which I didn't mind. I felt like I wasn't getting enough marshmallow, if any at all, but perhaps need to smell it again. This one had even less projection and staying power. I would need to seriously apply it every 45 minutes to have anyone notice it. 2.5/5

Tamarind Soda: This was my free sample, so I wouldn't have chosen it otherwise. First impression was this was the most strong (and offensive) scent. Right off it smelled like a bar of cheap soap. My partner said it smelled like those urinal cakes that are trying to mask a worse scent, lol. It stays this way for a while, I didn't get anything relatively similar to soda. When it starts to dry down, it smells like cheap, artificial GRAPE soda. I feel like this was might last longer than the others, but I wouldn't know because I had to wash it off. 0/5, I hated it.

The body butter I got was Splendiferous. It's a lemon-honeysuckle scent. Smelling it out of the jar, it reminded me of baby powder mixed with insect repellent. As soon as I put it on/rubbed it in, it smelled really nice! It felt really creamy (almost the way I'd expect the lemon marshmallow to be) and lemon-y. I could feel it in my stomach, like, it felt edible. I'm not sure if I got much of a floral/honeysuckle. Unfortunately, after it sits for a bit, I can pretty much just smells like intense powder-y and bug spray scent again.

I’m in a really confusing place emotionally, and I’d love some perspective from people who might understand.

I (F - bi)  had an emotionally intense connection with another woman for years. We never dated, but we shared long eye contact, brief conversations, and what felt like a mutual pull. It was all very quiet and unspoken , but powerful. We worked in the same place, ran into each other often, and these moments stretched out over years.

A while ago, I asked her if she wanted to grab coffee, and she didn’t really give me a clear answer. That silence hurt, so I removed her from Instagram not out of anger, but because I needed to protect my heart.

I thought I moved on. But life brought her back , unexpectedly. Now, we cross paths again. We work in the same area, and I’ve seen her multiple times lately. Sometimes she looks toward me but never into my eyes. It’s as if we’re still circling around something we never named.

Now here’s the thing: I’m about to travel on a trip  and reunite with someone very special , a guy I’ve known for 15 years. We have a strong emotional connection, and for the first time in a long time, I feel like I could build something real and healthy with him. I want to give him and this chance 100%, but I’m scared that I won’t be fully present… because this unresolved energy with her still lingers.

Part of me wants to ask her to talk , to simply ask:
“Was I alone in all of this, or did you feel something too?”
Not because I expect anything, but because I need clarity to truly let go and move on.

Should I do it? Should I face her before I go? Or is that just opening a door that should stay closed?

I have been experiencing continuos harassment, disability discrimination, eace harassment, victimisation and failure to implement reasonable adjustments at work.

I am still in probation but they keep declining reasonable adjustments for example more time to read the investigation they are doing into my performance and behaviour. And I don't have time to read it and reply in full with evidence due to poor health and having to move next week.

It's making me sick and more ill. They know my disabilities and impacts.

Would I be able to claim constructive dismissal? I just received the email saying no extra time to review the investigation papers and I want to leave as it's making me suicidal again.

They have discriminated indirectly by applying policies to me when they knew I was struggling. When asked for extra time, they only changed their mind when I mentioned the law. I asked to have things in writing and they only allowed it after a continuos back and forth. 

My manager told me I was not gonna be a fit for the role in the long term as I suffered with anxiety. No other options offered. 

 This colleague has harassed me on 5 different occasions with 3 of them reported and no one intervened to stop the behaviour. 

Asked for breaks to prevent migraines and they said I need to add them on top of my working hours and they are u paid. Even though everyone has coffee and cigarette breaks in the office. 

They offered me a small settlement or they would start disciplinary for my performance. 

They started disciplinary then I told them was premeditated and that there was no investigation as per ACAS code and now they started investigating and putting pressure on how quick I need to return my replies. 

My manager has not given me training when I asked for it. 

My ceo called me three times even though I asked to be contacted in writing due to anxiety. 

They had a data breach of 2years of all employee data being available to everyone in the company and I reported it. Thts when their behaviour changed. 

They never provided feedback but once I reported data breach, racism and harassment, they wrote to me a long performance review ignoring most of my good work and flagging continuos mistakes where they did not provide extra coaching. 

They had no policies at all until I asked for them and they build an employee book last week.

Let's start with the main attraction—the price. Teenage Engineering decided that around $2000 for the OP–XY is perfectly reasonable. Over two thousand dollars for a tiny groovebox toy! For this amount of money, one could buy a fully-featured Apple laptop with Ableton or FL Studio, or a professional synthesizer, and still have enough left for coffee.

OP-1 was already expensive, and Field for 2k is just detached from reality.""](https://gearspace.com/board/electronic-music-instruments-and-electronic-music-production/1379870-op-1-field-update-classic-teenage-engineering.html#:~:text=In%20a%20nutshell%20%2C%20they,4%20GHz%20antenna%20system)

Indeed, it seems TE lives on a different planet where musicians print money.

Where did such a price tag come from? It feels as if half of this amount is just brand prestige and showing-off. On the Gearspace forum, someone sarcastically joked that the company targets ""plastic-surgeon hobby musicians,"" for whom the price tag is more a matter of prestige rather than common sense. The OP–XY is perceived more as a luxury accessory, a ""premium inspirational toy,"" rather than a utilitarian tool. TE themselves probably acknowledge this—they release limited designer items and then set an enormous price simply because they can. Yes, demand creates supply—fans bought the overpriced original OP-1, so now they're rolling out the Field at twice the price. But there is no reasonable justification for this price tag. In functional terms, the OP–XY isn't worth this money, and we'll explain why right now.

**Limited Functionality without Depth**

Behind OP–XY's appealing exterior lies disappointingly superficial functionality. Essentially, it's a successor to OP-Z and OP-1, but neither the synthesis capabilities, sampling functionality, nor other aspects reach professional depth. Even in the earlier OP-1, many criticized the simplistic synthesizer engines with minimal parameter control. With the new OP–XY, the situation remains the same: as one [review admits](https://synthanatomy.com/2024/11/teenage-engineering-op-xy-a-supercharged-op-z-groovebox.html#:~:text=It%20has%2024%20voices%20of,C), ""the synth engines are minimal and offer only a few parameters.

True, they've added a handful of new engines (promising 8 synthesizer modes and 3 sampler types), but there’s no mention of advanced editing capabilities - just basic envelopes, a couple of LFOs, and that’s it.

Automation? Forget it. There are no automation tracks, no parameter curves—the most you'll get is step components in the sequencer and manual recording of parameter moves onto the ""tape,"" just as in the original OP-1. Advanced MIDI automation or modular signal routing can only be dreamt about; OP–XY has yet to outgrow the beginner-level limitations of a simple four-track device.

It's painful to see a $2000 device struggle with basic audio editing tasks. Users complain that even the OP-1 Field managed to [""fail its main task—audio editing: try cutting out a segment without clicks and artifacts—you won't succeed, and there's no way to fix it.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenageengineering/comments/1grd77u/the_problem_with_opxy_is_not_about_the_price/#:~:text=,ZERO%20means%20of%20correcting%20them) Simply put, there's no proper editing functionality like crossfading or Undo—straight out of the '90s! Judging by initial reviews, OP–XY preserves this ""tape-style"" concept: yes, a few virtual ""tapes"" and scenes were added, but it doesn't change the core idea. There's still no nonlinear sequencer with arbitrarily long audio tracks—you're still juggling limited snippets on a pseudo-cassette. MIDI routing is also discretely glossed over: there's a MIDI input and output (via 3.5mm connector) plus Bluetooth MIDI, but you can't flexibly reassign tracks to external instruments or set different MIDI channels per track—it's all very basic.

Even the audio output is just a single, multipurpose jack introduced by TE, capable of serving as a stereo output, CV/Gate for modular rigs, or a guitar send—but only one at a time. You cannot get multiple simultaneous outputs from it; it's not a fully featured interface. Ultimately, the OP–XY remains a toy-like ""jack of all trades, master of none"": you can do quite a bit, but everything feels very limited. Forget about effect send groups, proper mixing capabilities, or parallel processing—none of the things you'd expect from a musical workstation in 2025.

No wonder disappointed owners write that their ultra-expensive OP-1 Field is collecting dust while they produce music on an iPad or laptop. My OP-1 Field has become so inconvenient compared to everything else that it just gathers dust. I can't see how one could justify purchasing the overly hyped OP-Z (basically OP-XY), which I'm 100% certain will be less versatile than any app on an iPad mini at a quarter of the price. Harsh, yet true—even a tablet nowadays can do more than this ""studio in your pocket"" from TE. Unfortunately, none of OP–XY’s components reach a professional level: the synthesizers are simplistic and sound mediocre, the sampler is primitive (polyphony was boosted to 24 voices, but memory remains at only 8 GB, with just 512 MB RAM—laughably inadequate for sampling), and the sequencer, while better than the OP-Z, still falls short in functionality compared to its rivals. It seems as though the engineers dedicated all their energy towards aesthetics and gimmicks rather than the quality of implementation.

**Closed system, zero customization**

All of the restrictions described above could have been alleviated by enthusiasts, had they had the possibility to tweak the device—but no luck here. The OP–XY is a completely closed ecosystem. No SDK for developing your own tools, no API, no custom firmware options—just use it as is and don't complain. The company is known for its dislike of modders: as soon as enthusiasts started discussing firmware decryption on the official forum, administrators cowardly [removed the thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23233231#:~:text=TE%20are%20known%20to%20not,like%20to%20see%20it%20done). The developer of a firmware modification tool explicitly states: Teenage Engineering does not publicly support the modding of OP-1 and dislikes it when people do. Firmware is encrypted (OP-Z uses AES encryption—good luck cracking that!), schematics remain unpublished. Their philosophy is: “Only we have the right to engineer, everyone else should shut up and buy.” This sounds harsh but accurately reflects reality. Users requested expandability—in response, TE releases shiny new gadgets rather than breathing new life into old models. Want to add your own effects or synth engines? Forget it; you'll have to wait until TE decides (spoiler: they're more likely to release a new gadget for another $2,000 instead).

Moreover, there is also no proper project export or integration with other software. Yes, it includes USB-C audio/MIDI and even export of separate tracks in AIF format, but there is no option for direct transfer of a full project into your DAW—no Ableton Live export, no compatibility. While Akai (the best alternative in my opinion) enables MPC users to export a session with a single click into Ableton while preserving the arrangement, TE seems purposefully intent on keeping the user tightly confined within its closed ecosystem. You won’t be able to open up the hood of the OP-XY and peek inside, neither in software nor hardware terms: no expansion ports, no custom modules (such as those available for OP-Z), internal memory is non-removable. You bought it—use it as is. And if you don’t like it—well, TE will release yet another ""wonder device"" soon, perhaps covering the gaps (for more money, of course). That’s their strategy.

**Support so poor it makes you want to cry**

One might expect that, at a luxury price point, the company would pamper its clients with great customer service. Unfortunately, that's far from the reality! Teenage Engineering's support service is notoriously slow and indifferent. Users widely complain about waiting weeks without receiving responses, or getting generic, unhelpful replies instead of meaningful assistance. One review summarized: Customers repeatedly report waiting days or even weeks just to have their inquiries acknowledged. Emails frequently go unanswered, causing increasing frustration. And even when a response finally arrives, it's often just vague, useless phrases that make [the customers feel ignored](https://muziquemagazine.com/the-nightmare-of-teenage-engineerings-customer-service-a-tale-of-frustration-and-neglect/#:~:text=Unresponsive%20and%20Unhelpful%3A%20One%20of,go%20unanswered%2Cand%20the%20frustration%20mounts). Thus, there isn't the real, premium-level support one would expect—just a formality. It's hard to say they're doing nothing at all; they are doing something—but the main question remains how they do it and what exactly it is they are doing.

If your device breaks down, a real quest begins. Teenage Engineering apparently lifts itself of responsibility for defective units, placing all the hassle onto the customer. Each story is sadder than the last: people receive faulty devices straight from the box and then spend months trying to secure a repair or replacement. Particularly infamous was the scandal jokingly labeled ""Fadergate"" by the community: TE released the PO-133 KO II mixer with defective faders, and many buyers quickly discovered that the brand-new gadget didn't function correctly. And how did TE respond? They didn't. Hundreds of complaints were met with silence or generic replies. Some customers waited three weeks, sending seven tickets and even contacting their ""personal insider"" at the company, yet still didn't even receive a return shipping label for sending back the defective unit. Users are in disbelief: a new $299 device is broken, yet there's zero customer support. One can only imagine how TE would treat an OP-XY owner if, heaven forbid, some glitch surfaced on a $2300 device…

Moreover, instead of engaging in dialogue with the community, the company sometimes opts for censorship and bans. Critical posts on their official channels or fan communities are immediately removed, and commenters who express inconvenient opinions might be ignored or blocked—definitely not a conversation about listening and improving. Recently, there was a situation where a popular blogger made a humorous but critical review of one of TE's devices—so the company immediately issued a copyright strike claiming infringement because he had included a snippet from their promo video. Legally, TE might have been right, but it left a bitter aftertaste: instead of addressing their issues, the company fights negativity in the information sphere. The official TE account also didn't show any favor to customers on Reddit who criticized the price of the OP-1 Field—there are rumors that some particularly vocal users even had their commenting privileges revoked. Overall, it's not reasonable to expect open and friendly support. If something goes wrong, you will likely find yourself alone with your problems and a cold answering machine. For $2000, you'd at least hope for a modest amount of respect towards the customer—but apparently, not in this universe.

**Beautiful animations are a useless circus**

However, one thing is undeniable: Teenage Engineering knows how to make things beautiful. Like its predecessors, the OP–XY is literally captivating with its design. The stylish aluminum body, tactile encoders, and cute pixel animations on the OLED screen make looking at the device a joy, and your hands can't help reaching out to play with it. TE clearly takes pride in their distinctive visual approach. In their description of the OP-1 Field, they specifically boasted that they had ""meticulously redrawn all the graphics, screen by screen."" They also put considerable effort into the OP–XY: the interface is stylishly black, animations are smooth, and each function comes with some charming cartoonish imagery. Working with such a device is indeed a pleasure for an aesthetically-minded individual. Inspiration, fun, wow-factor—these are what people love about TE's products. They are often referred to as “[inspiration devices](https://gearspace.com/board/electronic-music-instruments-and-electronic-music-production/1379870-op-1-field-update-classic-teenage-engineering.html#:~:text=Interesting%20case%20study%20for%20pricing,anyway),” emphasizing creative joy rather than dry utility.

But that's exactly the problem—these visual embellishments are like partying during the plague. They don't enhance the final sound or improve your music; they're merely an expensive on-screen circus. Even worse, there's no effective way to share these stunning animations with the world. The OP-XY has no video output and no screen streaming capability. Want to show these beautiful graphics to an audience? You're limited to pointing a camera at a tiny display. Ironically, the previous OP-Z model had a feature to output visuals to an external screen (via a module or app), but the new flagship removed it! [One review sarcastically notes](https://www.gearnews.com/teenage-engineering-op-xy-synth/#:~:text=Visually%20and%20functionally%2C%20the%20OP,sound%20and%20sequencing%20for%20musicians): ""OP-Z's video capabilities aren't integrated. Tough luck for visuals fans, but at least there's more room for sound and the sequencer."" Translating that from marketing speak: ""We removed the functionality because we couldn't or didn't want to implement it, but we're presenting it as a benefit."" As they say, “it'll do as is.” Consequently, all these elaborate visual features of the OP-XY remain confined to the device itself—beautiful bubbles only the user can see. No option to generate VJ videos or stream audio-reactive graphics to a projector during live performances. Ultimately, visually appealing yet practically useless.

There's a paradox: the developers clearly spent countless hours working on design and animation instead of implementing essential features. Users sarcastically remark that TE prioritizes releasing new fonts and pretty graphics over adding something basic like an undo feature or expanding sampler memory. Indeed, the list of ""100 new features"" for the OP-1 Field included things like a ""new sketch mode"" and ""new font,"" as if these were more important than, say, providing proper output connectors or improving the synthesis engine. The OP–XY carries on this tradition: it draws you in with flashing lights, but underneath remains just as limited as before. If you simply want aesthetic pleasure from watching a screen, you'll get plenty of that here. But if you need a tool where the beauty of the interface is matched by real power and flexibility—I'm afraid here, beauty merely disguises emptiness.

**Akai MPC Live II: a real alternative instead of pretentiousness**

After all this criticism, the inevitable question arises: is there a choice? What do you do if you need a portable music station but aren't keen on paying for a compromised art-piece? There's a practical answer, and it’s fairly straightforward: the Akai MPC Live II. Yes indeed, the legendary MPC series, already spanning several generations, is the direct opposite of the OP–XY. With a similar concept (all-in-one design, battery power, built-in speakers, portability), the MPC Live II delivers exactly what the gadget from TE lacks: practicality, reliability, and extensive functionality without meaningless frills.

Firstly, there’s price: a new MPC Live II will cost around $1200–1300, significantly cheaper than the OP–XY. For that money, you get a comprehensive music workstation, rather than a stylish pseudo-synthesizer. Secondly, features: MPC is essentially a mini-DAW. 16 pads, a large 7-inch touchscreen, a convenient interface, and most importantly—no limitations on track count or recording length. Would you like to record lengthy vocals or guitar parts? No problem (the MPC features linear audio recording). Interested in programming complex drums? The famous MPC sequencer is flexible. Automation? Every knob movement is recorded in real time. Effects? It has a full range of inserts, sends, and mastering tools. Synthesizers? MPC firmware currently includes powerful synth engines (from AIR Music Tech and others) with numerous, far more comprehensive parameters than the primitive engines on the OP–XY. Storage and memory aren't an issue either: 16GB built-in memory (already filled with sounds), plus an SD-card slot, plus a compartment for an SSD drive—install one terabyte and forget about storage limits. On the OP–XY, there's a laughable 8GB of non-expandable storage.

After comparing OP–XY with MPC Live II, one immediately wants to ask a potential buyer: do you need music, or just a large sum on a receipt along with a stylish gadget?

The interfaces of MPC Live II are a story on their own. You've got three pairs of full-sized 1/4” stereo outputs right here (useful for assigning tracks to separate channels during performances or connecting several monitor pairs). Plus two MIDI inputs and two MIDI DIN outputs—no adapters needed, just plug in external synths directly. It even provides four CV/Gate outputs for modular enthusiasts—the MPC smoothly synchronizes and controls your analog rack. USB-A ports allow you to connect MIDI keyboards, controllers, or USB drives. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are included too, handy for file transfers or synchronization via Ableton Link. Furthermore, Akai regularly provides firmware updates adding new features: there was a time they introduced synth engines, then class-compliant USB audio, Ableton Live Export, and so on. Akai’s support is also top-notch: it’s a big company with service centers, and software bugs get regularly ironed out. And if the community requests a particular feature—chances are you'll see it added within a few updates. Just think of how TE “delights” their fans—the contrast is striking.

But most importantly, the experience of using MPC Live II fundamentally differs from the OP–XY. Instead of struggling with limitations, you just work. You don't wonder how to deal with the absence of undo or squeeze polyphony out of a laughable engine—you create music instead of fighting with the instrument. The MPC is also portable: it features a battery lasting approximately 5–6 hours and built-in stereo speakers, meaning you can jam in the park, on the sofa—really anywhere, just as with the OP–XY. Yes, it's heavier (about 3 kg versus less than 1 kg for the OP–XY), but that's the price for sturdier construction and high-quality internals. At the same time, it won't break from an accidental kick nor does its chassis wobble. It's a musical tool from the real music world, if you will, rather than a designer toy.

In real-world scenarios, the Akai MPC Live II beats the OP–XY on all fronts. If you need to record and fully mix a track, the MPC can handle it easily, while the OP–XY hits a wall with only 4 tracks and no mastering functionality. Want to integrate with a computer? MPC projects can effortlessly transfer into your DAW, or you can even use the MPC as a controller for Ableton. The OP–XY, on the other hand, offers no close integration—just audio exporting and manual assembly.

For live performances or jam sessions, the MPC provides reliability and predictability, whereas the OP–XY can deliver surprises, usually limited to an unexpected battery drain. Speaking of batteries, the MPC offers a decent one, and while OP–XY claims approximately 16 hours of battery life, that is unlikely under heavy use.

And yes, the MPC is significantly more powerful regarding hardware, featuring a quad-core ARM processor and 2 GB of RAM, making it hard to overload. In contrast, the OP–XY has two CPUs of unclear strength and just 512 MB of RAM, raising concerns whether it might stutter, much like the older OP-1 often did, especially when handling complex sounds (and TE has already had problems with devices freezing in the past).

We could keep listing for a long time, but the point is simple: if you need an actual tool rather than just a trendy accessory, the market offers reliable solutions. The MPC Live II is just one example; there's also Elektron Digitakt/Digitone paired with Analog Heat (not without compromises either, but at least costing half as much), as well as Polyend Tracker/Play, or even simply a laptop with a controller. All these options will deliver what the OP–XY promises, only without hassle and at a reasonable cost. And Maschine Plus by Native Instruments is just dreamy, although admittedly less portable.

**Instead of a Conclusion**

The Teenage Engineering OP–XY is a clear example of how marketing and design attempt to mask technical inadequacy. Yes, the device is incredibly stylish and easy to love—at least for the first couple of days, until the novelty wears off and you start noticing its limitations.

In this article we've examined all of OP–XY's sore points: an unjustifiably high price tag, limited functionality hidden behind an appealing exterior, complete lack of openness toward the community, embarrassingly poor support, and an emphasis on appearance at the expense of substance. These points are not fabricated maliciously; they're backed up by actual user experiences and feedback collected from Reddit, Elektronauts, Gearspace, and other platforms. Don't hesitate to check the genuine feedback—not from Teenage Engineering fanboy communities, where a single inconvenient question gets you banned, but from real discussions where people openly highlight negatives in their comments and reviews.

Disappointment is palpable everywhere, especially among those who trusted TE and expected innovation, only to receive an overpriced toy.

Teenage Engineering loves calling their products an ""advanced portable studio,"" a studio in your pocket, so to speak. However, [as one commenter aptly noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenageengineering/comments/1grd77u/the_problem_with_opxy_is_not_about_the_price/#:~:text=Let%27s%20take%20a%20look%20at,lineup%20at%20its%20current%20state), neither OP-1 Field nor OP–XY individually qualifies as a fully portable studio. They might complement each other, sure—but then you're looking at spending $3000+ and carrying around two separate devices. Funny and sad. The OP–XY is an instrument aimed at wealthy enthusiasts who value aesthetics over outcomes, suitable for those willing to serve as beta testers at their own expense and ready to tolerate imperfections in exchange for owning something ""you don't see every day."" For professionals or simply serious musicians, the OP–XY might elicit nothing more than a sarcastic smile.

Is the OP–XY worth its price tag? If you're even asking, probably not. Unless, of course, you genuinely have an extra two thousand dollars lying around to spend on experimental hangouts featuring attractive gadgets. Otherwise, it's better to invest in something more reliable—a tool that works for you rather than simply showing off in front of you. Because at the end of the day, what matters is the music, not flashy lights on an expensive toy. Music will surely triumph where a device assists rather than interrupts—even if that means it's slightly less glamorous. As the saying goes: make music, instead of sitting in the menu watching beautiful but useless animations. That's the kind of advice Deadpool himself would give if he were choosing between OP–XY and something honestly useful. Don't be fooled by marketing, and may inspiration—backed by real tools rather than empty promises—be with you.

Therefore, before purchasing, ask yourself if you need music or just a beautiful music gadget?

**The best alternative?**

Want one device that does it all—no complex rituals, no marketing illusions?

Akai MPC Live II

— a standalone workstation that can:  
– sample, slice, modulate  
– run plugins  
– work with audio and MIDI tracks  
– export however you want  
– connect to everything from synths to pedals  
– perform well on stage and in the studio  
– be supported by real people

Yes, it doesn't look like a trendy gadget from 2049. But it performs exactly as it should in 2025.

I’m in a really confusing place emotionally, and I’d love some perspective from people who might understand.

I (bi)  had an emotionally intense connection with another woman for years. We never dated, but we shared long eye contact, brief conversations, and what felt like a mutual pull. It was all very quiet and unspoken , but powerful. We worked in the same place, ran into each other often, and these moments stretched out over years.

A while ago, I asked her if she wanted to grab coffee, and she didn’t really give me a clear answer. That silence hurt, so I removed her from Instagram not out of anger, but because I needed to protect my heart.

I thought I moved on. But life brought her back , unexpectedly. Now, we cross paths again. We work in the same area, and I’ve seen her multiple times lately. Sometimes she looks toward me but never into my eyes. It’s as if we’re still circling around something we never named.

Now here’s the thing: I’m about to travel on a trip  and reunite with someone very special , a guy I’ve known for 15 years. We have a strong emotional connection, and for the first time in a long time, I feel like I could build something real and healthy with him. I want to give him and this chance 100%, but I’m scared that I won’t be fully present… because this unresolved energy with her still lingers.

Part of me wants to ask her to talk , to simply ask:
“Was I alone in all of this, or did you feel something too?”
Not because I expect anything, but because I need clarity to truly let go and move on.

Should I do it? Should I face her before I go? Or is that just opening a door that should stay closed?

1lere2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIContentAutomators/comments/1lere2d/turn_your_ai_hobby_into_income_this_week_before/,Turn your AI hobby into 💸 income this week - before it's saturated!,"**Ever feel like your AI hobby is just gathering digital dust while you could be cashing in?** 🤑 Trust me, you’re not alone! With the buzz around AI reaching a fever pitch, there's never been a better time to turn your passion for everything AI into a little (or a lot!) of side income. Why let those ideas fester when you can start making moves *this week*?

So, you’re probably wondering, “How the hell do I even start?” 🤔 No worries, fam, I got you! Here’s a quick roadmap to kick things into gear before the market gets too crowded.

### **1. Identify Your Niche**
- Do you love creating content? Maybe AI-generated text or art is for you.
- Are you into coding? Think about how you can develop niche tools or apps.
- Enjoy teaching? Consider crafting a mini course on something AI-related!

### **2. Get to Know Your Tools**
- Familiarize yourself with platforms like **ChatGPT, Midjourney, or DALL-E**. These tools can help you create and automate processes.
- Start small. Tinker around with different functionalities and see what clicks!

### **3. Create Something Awesome (and Easy)**
- **Content Ideas:** Blogs, YouTube videos, or even an AI art collection for sale.
- **Services:** Offer to write copy, generate social media posts, or create personalized greeting cards using AI art. 
- **Courses:** Share what you know, even if it’s just a quick 30-minute how-to on something you mastered.

### **4. Market Yourself (Don’t Be Shy!)**
- Share your work on social media, especially Instagram and TikTok—AI content visually pops! 🌈 
- Join online communities, forums, and subreddits related to AI—like **AiContentAutomators**! Engage and share your insights or projects.

### **5. Don’t Overthink It!**  
You don’t need a degree to start—just enthusiasm and a willingness to learn. Heck, I started doing AI art just for fun, and now, I’ve turned it into a side hustle that pays for my morning coffee. ☕️ Who says you can’t live the dream? 

### **6. Keep Your Mind Open to Feedback**  
Embrace it! Not everyone will love your creations—and that’s okay. Keep iterating, learning, and improving. Remember, the journey is just as important as the destination.

### In a Nutshell:
- **Start simple:** Don’t let perfection be the enemy of progress.
- **Stay ahead:** Market trends shift like the wind—nail it before it gets oversaturated.
- **Find your community:** Engage, collaborate, and make connections to elevate your game.

Life's too short to wait for the ""perfect moment."" So why not dive in and see where this wild AI adventure can take you? You’ve got this!

I have ideas of adding a grey rug, accent chair, and some sort of coffee table. 

As far as decorations go, I have zero clue what to do. The wall opposite the windows I feel will need something. 

Also can’t decide what to do with the windows. Blinds? Curtains? Something else? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated

Not going to lie, I did not expect to be back on here. But somewhere between curiosity and hope, I figured I would give this another real shot. I am not here for entertainment. I am here to meet someone who is also tired of surface-level talk and is ready to build something solid. Not perfect. Just real. Honest. Intentional.

Starting fresh can be exhausting. All the guessing games, the breadcrumb texts, and weird energy. I am not built for that. I want the kind of connection where we both show up fully, speak our minds, and know the value of growing side by side. If that is what you are looking for, I already like your style.

About Me

I am 32, a veteran, a first responder, and currently working full time as a Campus Safety Officer at a middle school. What I do goes way beyond walking the halls. I am someone the kids and staff rely on. I have also worked as an EMT on an ambulance and served as a volunteer firefighter. I have trained armed security officers, and I am finishing my degree in history education online. The goal is to be a high school history teacher, and yes, I will probably end up being the football coach too. It just seems like fate at this point.

Physically, I am 5 feet 10, mixed Black and white, and yes, I am on the heavier side. But I am working on it. I walk 8 to 12 miles a day at work and I am already halfway to my goal weight. I am not looking for perfection in anyone else, so I do not expect it from myself. But I do believe in showing up better every day.

I am country at heart. Think off roading, fixing things that probably could have waited, and finding peace in the quiet. I am a bit of a Black cowboy, Yes I have a Cowboy hat! A few actually.

I have survived North Dakotan winters and African summers. I have seen war zones and school zones. I have been overseas, worked across states, and met all kinds of people. Travel and experience taught me one thing clearly. Life is too short to pretend or perform. So I do not.

What I am Looking For

I am looking for a woman who knows her worth. Someone who is kind but not passive. Intelligent, open-hearted, and ready for a real partnership. You can work or stay home. Either way, I will support you. I make enough to keep us steady, and while I will not impress anyone with flashy spending, I will earn your trust through consistency, care, and effort.

Single moms, you are welcome here too. I love kids. I work with them every day. And if you are still hoping to build a family together, I am your guy. I am waiting for the right woman to raise children with, not just someone to pass the time.

I do not do yelling. I do not do passive aggression. And I definitely do not do drama. I believe in communication, honesty, and laughing through the hard days when the best we have got is frozen pizza and a deep breath.

What I Bring to the Table

I bring stability. Financially. Emotionally. In how I show up. I have two steady incomes and a life I have built with purpose. I am the kind of man who remembers what you say, notices when something is off, and cares enough to ask twice.

I bring peace. No raised voices. No walking on eggshells. I believe love should feel safe. I do not use anger as a weapon. I use humor, presence, and patience to get through things. And yes, I know the difference between their, they are, and there. Just thought that might earn me some extra points.

I bring resilience. I have worked long nights and hard jobs. I have responded to emergencies with lights and sirens and stood in burning buildings. I have protected people in war zones and comforted children in school hallways. I have held the hands of the dying and prayed with them in their final moments. I have looked people in the eye and helped them find peace when fear tried to take over. That kind of moment stays with you. It teaches you what matters. It humbles you. It makes you gentler, even when life has made you strong.

I bring love. Real love. The kind that folds laundry without being asked. Even if, to be fair, you probably do not want me folding laundry. It usually ends up in a ball and somehow still wrinkled. But the effort is there. The thought counts, right? I am the kind of man who learns your coffee order, texts you when I am thinking about you, and shows up even when I am tired. I believe in the kind of partnership where you know you are never doing life alone.

The Life I Dream About

I want a home out in the woods or tucked up in the mountains. A porch. Some horses. Kids running around. The kind of life that ends with us curled up on the couch after they go to bed. A quiet, strong, loving life. I do not need luxury. I need peace, laughter, faith, and someone who is just as ready to build that life as I am.

Final Thoughts

I am not perfect. But I am present. I am real. I am trying every day to be better, love deeper, and lead with both strength and gentleness. I want a woman who sees the value in that. Who wants to be cherished, not controlled. Heard, not silenced. Partnered with, not picked apart.

If any of this speaks to you, even a little, do not overthink it. Send a message. Let us see if this could be the start of something worth keeping.

And if not, I still wish you peace, love, and a man who shows up the way you deserve.

P.S. Guys like me do still exist. We are just not single for long. Take your shot ;-)",1,1750277740.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

We are both students and respectfully poor 🥲

Can you recommend me any interesting place or cafe or restaurant to me? For example Cafe Napoleon was really interesting as it was named after Napoleon Bonaparte. We have visited literally every single museum in Turin area.

My budget is about 15 euros per person, if less then even better.

1lerbat,https://www.reddit.com/r/FPandA/comments/1lerbat/module_selection_fmva_for_a_business_student/,Module Selection/ FMVA for a Business Student considering Graduate FP&A Roles,"Hey all,

I will keep this short.

**I have a dilemma.**

**I am not one of those students who has been organised/ ambitious throughout their college career.**

Long story short, I have just finished my penultimate degree year (General Business Degree at a top European university).

In the last few months, I have got my shit together - working over summer (commercial role that looks decent on CV but not quite summer internship material), coffee chats, cold emails, etc etc.

I am going to graduate with average grades, an Upper Second Class Honours or 2:1 (3-3.5 GPA equivalent) - this is the most common degree grade for graduate roles in my country.

My extra-curriculars, while not finance/ accountancy-based are favourable (probably my main plus as quoted by some recruiters in coffee chats).

My course this year and next (final year) is very accountancy-based - I have achieved good grades in Tax, Management Accounting, and Financial Accounting.

**In final year, we have an option to do a ""Derivatives"" module. I am very keen on this but not sure of the practicality (if I go down Accountancy/ ""Big 4"" route).**

Also, I had it in my head that I would complete Corporate Finance Institute's FMVA (Financial Modelling and Valuation Analyst) course - I know this won't land me a corporate finance job, I want to do it to a) see if the work interests me in depth, b) enhance my technical knowledge.

My **question(s)** to you folks is the following, condensed as much as possible:  
**1) Is there a chance for someone like me to get interviews for a decent financial graduate role ? (Not high finance IB/ PE, but mid-size banks in the UK, FPA etc).**

**2) Should I pursue the FMVA? It will serve as my only in-depth, structured education on corporate finance/ FP&A technicals, but I am worried that if I go down the accountancy route, it will be worthless.**

Many thanks in advance to you all - I most likely see myself pursuing the ACCA qualification (CPA equivalent) as a graduate. **The reason I have this dilemma is that whilst I find accounting relatively easy, the world of corporate finance/ FP&A and its deal-based nature attracts me a lot more** \- I am just wary that I've gotten my act together too late and will be spinning my wheels chasing finance roles.",1,1750277590.0,FPandA,0,1.0,False

**Acer Joins The Smart Ring Competition**

As the wearable health-tech market matures, the battle for your finger intensifies. 

Acer, known more for laptops than lifestyle devices, is entering the ring *(literally)****,*** with the *FreeSense*, its debut smart ring aimed at health-conscious users seeking advanced metrics without ongoing subscription costs.

Here’s how it stacks up against the incumbents:

|Feature|**Oura Ring 4**|**Samsung Galaxy Ring**|**Acer FreeSense**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Price**|$349 + $5.99/mo subscription|$399.99 (no subscription)|\~$250 (one‑time)|
|**Battery Life**|Up to 8 days|Up to 7 days (size-dependent)|\~4–5 days|
|**Sleep Tracking**|Yes, with advanced readiness scores|Yes, with Galaxy Health insights|Yes|
|**HRV & Resting Heart Rate**|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|**Skin Temperature**|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|**SpO₂ (Blood Oxygen)**|Yes|Yes|(TBD)|
|**Electrodermal Activity**|No|No|Yes|
|**Materials & Design**|Titanium, 3.3–5.2 g, sleek|Titanium, 2.3–3 g, ultra-slim 2.6 mm|(Specs TBD)|
|**Subscription Fee?**|Yes|No|No|

Oura 4 is like the luxury Swiss watch of rings. Sophisticated, precise, but pricey (and subscription-y).

The Galaxy Ring is the cool new minimalist. Sleek, smart, but best fit for android users. 

FreeSense? The scrappy newcomer: packed with unique stress tracking and no monthly charge (and at a lower starting price point). 

For those just starting their health optimization journey, the FreeSense might be an easy first step.

**WTF is DG1?**

Oh boy. The era of AG1 copycats is accelerating at a blistering space, and this time, it’s headed for your pets.

Many people think supplements are a waste. And for good reason.

Questionable claims. Questionable “reviews”.

Glaring lack of science.

And when there’s a gold rush? You can count on finding plenty of tricksters out to get your hard-earned dollars.

Enter…..[DG1.](https://wearedg1.com/?utm_campaign=wtf-is-dg1&utm_medium=referall&utm_source=stayin-alive)

There’s no origin story here, no clinical trials, no independent testing.  Just a suspiciously familiar aesthetic and a few generic claims about “daily performance.”

AG1 spent decades building a reputation on rigorous science, clinical research, and full ingredient transparency. 

Grüns made greens gummies cool and convenient, with third-party testing and FDA-registered manufacturing. 

DG1? They slapped a “D” where the “A” used to be, wrapped it in a sterile white label, and called it innovation.

Friendly advice - if you’re gonna put something in your body every day (or your pets), make sure it wasn’t cooked up in a branding brainstorm two weeks ago.
