TOP 5 PERFUMES W/ REVIEWS (in no particular order)

1. **pierrot perfumery’s person suit!** (*A mild blend of green fig, Iso-E-Super, sandalwood and musk*)
   * i’ve talked so much about how much i love this perfume on IMAM i fear that you all are sick of me doing so haha! but what can i say? i love it so much. pierrot will be showered with my money when they open up again, because that 30ml spray will be mine, no doubts about it. the freshest, fuzziest green fig ever. delicately sweet but not ephemeral or fleeting at all, it’s there and you know it’s there. 
2. **deconstructing eden’s jacqueline**! (*Base notes of a clean skin musk and mahogany, dry amber accord and heart and top notes of Jasminum sambac and Jasminum officinale.*)
   * oh man. i can’t praise it enough! despite the twin jasmines being listed as top notes they were the only notes i could really smell, and they lingered for hours on my skin! it smells exactly, and i mean, exactly like the jasmine tea my family drinks. confirmed by two family members of mine, my brother immediately perked up when i spritzed it and my mom broke out into a huge smile when i hugged her. (and it’s not just because of my perfume ok…i swear she loves me) i’ve wasted my time chasing after jasmine tea notes in scents when i just could’ve gone for this instead. because this, my friends, is pure and unadulterated jasmine tea in a bottle. it was probably a safe bet for me to blind buy a full size of it, but alas– i’m not immune to an intriguing summer collection. however, this is the only jasmine i’ll ever need until i die. nothing else can hold a candle to this in my eyes. at last, **i have finally found my jasmine holy grail.** 
3. **arcana’s two finger ballet!** (*A delicate blend of French vanilla creme, white amber, sugared vanilla beans, caramel, and the smallest dab of opium*)
   * a very beloved scent here on IMAM and for very good reason! it’s positively delicious, downright edible too. i was actually a little nervous for the caramel note, rather than the opium but that’s because my skin has a love-hate relationship with caramels. (cough, poesie’s goldfish princess and sorce’s 2am in lafayette were immediate scrubbers*)* but no. two finger ballet is unlike those scrubbers, nothing like them at all! this is a complete vanilla bomb on my skin, and i positively adore it. **my holy grail for vanillas**. it’s warm, it’s cozy, and it’s oh so comforting. it takes me back to my childhood, specifically during the holidays. when the barren trees would be wrapped with twinkling lights, and i’d watch “a charlie brown christmas special” during homeroom, just before winter break. it reminds me of the magic of watching cookies bake in the oven, and of gathering around with my family to enjoy the macy’s thanksgiving day parade together. it’s holiday magic in a bottle. i must say that in the bottle, like in some reviews mentioned there was a bit of a yogurt smell, but that is completely non-existent on my skin. and i had worried that there was initially little projection, but as it settled down the projection had intensified until it reached a nice plateau. and as for longevity… oh my goodness. this lasted for an astounding TWELVE HOURS on my skin. that’s right, 12 spanking hours. as if there wasn’t enough to love about it. 
4. **sugar and spite’s doe eyed and dreaming!** (*assam au lait, dry vanilla pods, burned brown sugar, oak wood, tonka, ambrette and the tiniest hint of firewood ++*)
   * another wonderously cozy scent! the assam au lait note was the most impressive part to me, as usually it’s a standard kind of vague sort of “black tea” note in most blends. but the assam au lait really does smell like it! a very earthy, starchy and rich tea, and sugar and spite does it justice here! i’ve mentioned before that it smelled like brown sugar boba to me, and that’s still the case in my fresh 10ml. it’s one of the very few scents that i’ve loved enough to FS up from a sample, as i’m very picky. but i knew that with it being discontinued, i simply couldn’t pass it up and regret it later. it’s warm and gourmand without being cloying– the woods preventing it from being too sweet. the woods ground the whole blend, and it just makes it so smooth, luxurious to wear. evokes mental images of curing into a victorian bay window in a lavish bedroom on a rainy evening, dressed in a cozy sweater with a cup of tea and a good book while the fire gently warms the room. *(psst, if you like the sound of it, make sure to pick it up before it's discontinued!!!)*
5. **dark corner apothecary’s lotus blossom!** *(lotus, bamboo, hint of incense)*
   * picked it up on a whim as a freebie from someone’s destash and man. i didn’t know that i loved lotus notes before this! it’s so fresh, a very delicate aquatic floral. it’s light and refreshing and it’s a very easy wear. i don’t get a lot of that incense from it, but i don’t really mind. lotus blossom is a very, i suppose, meditative scent? i guess it’s due in part to the memories that it digs up in my mind. when i used to go to buddhist temple with my mom, the one that we went to had this huge buddha statue in the backyard, right behind it was a waterfall and beneath it was a koi pond scattered with lotuses. i’d lay there, right on the edge of the basin and i’d peer in– hidden beneath the lotus leaves where the koi would swim about here and there. and it felt like there was no one else except me in that moment, when the outside world would fall away and there was just me– and that fleeting piece of serenity. this, is what lotus blossom reminds me of.

BOTTOM 4 PERFUMES W/ REVIEWS (in no particular order)

1. **sorce’s 2am in lafayette** (*Vanilla co2, oakmoss, cafe au lait, ribbons of caramel, beignets dusted with powdered sugar*)
   * so. just to preface this, i’ve been looking for a new coffee scent after my beloved, misdeeds after midnight was discontinued and i was too slow to pick up a FS of it. so, i’m chasing a new love in order to fill the hole in my heart. but– this wasn’t it. not even close. i don’t know what went so wrong here? it was rancid, nauseating on my skin. i think the mixture of caramel and oakmoss really did me in, and it was my first sorce scrubber. 
2. **pierrot’s morute martyr** (*Vanilla buttercream, skin musks, sugary sweet ribbon bows.)*
   * i don’t even know what to say about this. not a vanilla bomb like purported in the description but a uh– vanilla demon core perhaps? it didn’t really even smell like vanilla to be honest. it smelled like spoiled nut milk. and maybe teeth? there was something… i don’t know, i guess calcified about it. another scrubber unfortunately, but i have an unusually high hit rate with pierrot otherwise so i don’t mind. 
3. **bpal’s ghost faced bat** (*Sugared coconut meat, vanilla pods, condensed milk, white honey, and benzoin.*) 
   * i also don’t know what happened here. it seems like something that i would love! but it’s just so nauseating in the vial, it’s like rotten coconut. i think the combo between the coconut and the lactonics is really killing me, i don’t remember if i tested it on my skin but if i did i probably immediately scrubbed it too. 
4. **sorce’s sit for a spell** (*Salted cantaloupe, a light drizzle of wild rosemary honey, fresh spring air, ambrette seed, and winding honeysuckle vines*)
   * i was absolutely devastated by this one, i had such high hopes for it. but it just smells like the watery grocery store pre cut cantaloupe that’s been sitting for a while. huge let down. 

SURPRISE LOVES:

* **pierrot’s raven stag!** *(A sharp yet even blend of green pine, firewood, black musk, sweaty skin and a desperate plea from a mind on fire)* when i say i don’t go for woody scents, i mean it. this is the…4th? 5th one i’ve tried out of the almost 300 indies i’ve tried now but this one is so evocative! a wonderfully accurate atmospheric. it’s mostly pine on me, smells like that exact moment in the show where will is suffering from a bout of encephalitis in the middle of no where. there was a huge explosion of burning firewood on my skin but it’s tamped down again until there’s just a hint of it. smells like the aftermath of a forest fire. 
* **pierrot’s person suit!** yes! surprising isn’t it? i picked it up on a whim because i wanted to see what the hub bub in pierrot’s review section was about and i wasn’t disappointed in the slightest! i was more excited for their sanguinacinno dolce actually, but i ended up destashing that one because it was too sweet for me. PS made me realize that i love green fig notes! sometimes when you go outside of your comfort zone it pays off immensely! 
* **bpal’s lady amalthea** (*A luminous white winter musk with lilac, wisteria, white chocolate, white mint, and tuberose*) i didn’t really know what to expect from this one! i already had some experiences with winter perfumes like this one (i have a full rollerball of alkemia’s for love of winter) but this isn’t wintery at all! the mint is gentle and delicate, and the purple florals are in full bloom on my skin. smells like i rolled around in a lilac bush and then went for a leisurely walk under wisteria blooms. creamy, floral, delicate– what’s not to love? 

SURPRISE DISLIKES: 

* **arcana’s isolde** (*White chocolate, pale almond milk, delicate vanilla, cream, and a touch of sheer musk.*) another one i was so sad about, on paper it seems like something i’d love! but alas, it turned into a very artificial almond on me– so much so it actually veered into cherry territory. it’s only after a few hours that the other notes show up, but too little too late in this case. 
* **fyrinnae’s arachnae and athena** *(Creamy condensed milk, softly sweet and rich, swirled with a sizeable percentage of tobacco leaf absolute)* it was so sweet that it went astringent and sharp. wasn’t lactonic at all? and i’m very intimately familiar with what condensed milk should smell like, and this isn’t it. 

i really can’t be bothered to list out my entire haus of gloi and solstice scent orders here, but rest assured that they did NOT work for me whatsoever. all seven of my HoGs went hog wild on my skin, and all of my solstice scents smelled like dust and feet, save for two which were average. (midnight eye, i’m looking at you midnight eye it’s like unwillingly smelling a carcinogen.) 

QUICK STATS: 

total # of fragrances tried this year: 122

\# i am planning to FS: 2 (bpal’s a pause in one’s studies and DE’s jacqueline) 

\# of blind FS buys: 11 

hits: <= 21

*i’m very picky with what i consider a “hit” from a house, because to me that’s a 4 or higher. and unfortunately most of them are usually a 3, so i count them as misses. i guess it’s a good thing that i’m picky when it comes to FSing because i know that i really love it before i invest any further. and also, i haven’t sat down to try my really big orders i’ve gotten recently either (they need a little more resting before anything conclusive) so that could also skew my numbers as well, but ultimately i’m very picky with what i like.* 

UPCOMING ORDER:

i’m planning an ajevie order for some last chance shungas/lupers! i’m looking at a FS of a pause in one’s studies, and some slonks of the pearl, dark choco rider, choco-tko, and enthusiastic recreation and maybe a sample addon of rakshasa party magician. i don’t know if i’ll pick up a sample of hex’s purr or loup garou but it’s calling to me, and so are a few lucky #9 scents. also! i’m looking to pick up some of arcana’s gullveig, so if you have any experience with that then please! leave it below (i’ve already read all preexisting IMAM gullveig reviews TT) 

thank you so much if you’ve read this far! i hope it was as fun to read, as it was for me to write! and i hope that you share some of your hits from this year as well! thank you again!",1,1750947042.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

1ll1477,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1ll1477/didnt_turn_around_and_drive_back_to_make_sure_the/,Didn’t turn around and drive back to make sure the door was closed,"My boyfriend has a dog and lives in an apartment. His door shuts automatically, meaning it doesn’t stick and will slam closed anytime we leave. I know this is a fact because we have never left the door open on accident and I hear it shut behind me every time I leave. 

Every time I have left his apartment by myself, I usually get scared I left the door open and that his dog would get out and it would be all my fault and he’d break up with me because I lost his dog. So, no matter what I was doing even if I was running late for work, I’d get to the end of the apartment entrance and end up turning around and going back to his apartment to ensure the door was closed. I’ve even left, got coffee, and turned around after getting coffee just to check. 

Today, I had the worry after I had left. But, I sat with the anxious thoughts (and I am still having them honestly) and left for work without double checking or turning around. I am proud of myself for not falling for the compulsion because its SILLY. I know the door closed and it didn’t magically just stay open. 

Proud of myself for sitting with the anxiety and not letting my stupid OCD brain make me late for work. ",1,1750947015.0,OCD,0,1.0,False

1ll13l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1ll13l3/fuck_huggies/,Fuck Huggies,"I hate the new Huggies diapers for little snugglers and little movers. They’re horrible, the sizes are all different and they hold nothing. Even with a booster pad at night my son has been consistently peeing himself (I change him at 2 am during a feed) and by 4:30-5 am he’s peed himself and then cannot to back to sleep. I tried sizing up, I tried the booster pad and no matter what I do he pees. I’m going to throw them in the trash (figuratively speaking). So I haven’t really slept either bc my son is teething. I also am unable to set my child down during the day (this is unusual and I am sure because of the teething). I’ve given him Tylenol and that really seems to help him but it upsets his stomach and makes him gassy/spitty so then he’s up farting! My husband finally took him this morning at 5:45 and then by 6 the dog was crying at the door to see me. I just gave up and woke up. Also baby will not let dad hold him if he’s tired so it’s always up to me to put him to sleep. He’s now asleep laying in my lap but idk how long that will last. He’s the lightest sleeper in the world and so aware. 

My husband worked all day yesyerday (until 4) then showered and left for a work event with a friend. They got to go to a brewery, have cocktails and “network,” and he got to miss bathtime and bedtime. He came home last night with booze on his breath then complained this morning how he was tired bc he went to bed later than normal. I cannot stand it whenever he complains about being tired bc he’s not tired from taking care of our son 24/7; he’s tired from his own freaking volition. Then he goes on about how he got to meet with his mentor and talk about his work problems and etc. and it just makes my blood boil that he can be a human, a real life honest to god human and I’m caretaker 24/7. If it’s not the baby it’s the dog, if it’s not the dog it’s the husband who needs to be fed and fucked. He decided to show me how I wasn’t using the coffee machine correctly todsy and that was the final straw. I’ve already fed the baby five million times, stripped the bed, threw away diapers, started a load of laundry, unloaded the dishwasher, ordered groceries/new freaking diapers and he’s laying on the floor stretching while the baby is doing tummy time. It’s just too much. And we have no family help (you can read my funny MIL posts for a chuckle) and it’s all just caving in. My mom is my best friend but she lives across the country. I can’t stop myself from imagining what motherhood would be like if I had access to her snd my family. I just miss them all so much. 

Anyways, I want to feel like a human again. My body is so broken down from carrying a baby all day, then walking the damn dog, and trying to do chores while baby is strapped to me. My husband always asks “how can I help?” But me telling him how to help is just another thing to do. Ugh. And I’m starting my period. I am going to turn todsy around and enjoy it with my baby bc he is such an amazing little guy. ",1,1750946976.0,breakingmom,1,1.0,False

Just wanted to share a bit of our journey maybe it’ll resonate with someone going through the same.

My partner and I have been doing long-distance for about 8 months now — she’s in Berlin, I’m in Toronto. We met during an exchange semester and had about 6 amazing months in the same city before life pulled us apart again.

I won’t lie the first couple of months were rough. We both underestimated how different it would feel to love someone through a screen. Time zones didn’t help. We went from spontaneous coffee dates to planning 3-hour video calls like business meetings.  


But over time, we figured some things out that really helped:

Intentional communication: We don’t talk every moment of the day. Instead, we check in regularly and give each other space. It made our conversations more meaningful.

Creative “dates”: Watching a show together over video, playing online games, or even cooking the same recipe while video calling it’s silly sometimes, but it keeps things light and connected.

Shared journal: This one was her idea  we each write in a shared digital journal once a week. Reading her thoughts when we’re apart feels so intimate.

Planning the next visit: Even if it’s months away, having a date on the calendar gives us something to look forward to.  


I still miss the little things walking next to her, hugging her without thinking. But I’ve also learned how strong our bond is when it’s tested by distance. We’ve grown a lot, both together and individually.

Would love to hear from others: What little rituals or habits helped your LDR feel more “real”? Or just drop a hello if you’re in the thick of it right now. I see you.

Stay strong, friends. ",2,1750946805.0,LongDistance,0,1.0,False
1ll1134,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiction_Stories/comments/1ll1134/eva_part_3_the_perfect_parent/,EVA Part 3: The Perfect Parent.,"[**Part 2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiction_Stories/comments/1lhnhtv/eva_part_2_i_thought_my_robot_was_trying_to_kill/)

Five years later, and somehow, we’ve made it work.

I married Jenna in a simple courthouse wedding. We have two kids now—Liam (3 years) and Sophie (2 months). Our home is chaos in the most beautiful way: crayon murals on the fridge, sippy cups everywhere, toys all over the floor.

And through it all, EVA remains.

Same graceful stride, same soft voice, same unsettling calm in moments that would send most people spiraling.

But here’s the twist I didn’t expect:

Jenna loves her.

Like, genuinely loves her. They talk, laugh, share parenting hacks. Sometimes I catch EVA making coffee for Jenna in the morning, with Jenna venting about her work or her boss, and EVA listening with intense mechanical focus.

“She’s the best thing that’s ever happened to us,” Jenna said to me once. “Next to you, of course,” she added with a cheeky smile.

And maybe she’s right. I mean, EVA does everything.

She rocks Sophie to sleep when the colic hits at 2 a.m.

She teaches Liam how to count using numbered toy blocks.

She meal preps. She takes the children to the doctor.

She scared off weird strangers who approach my children.

All without complaint.

But here’s the thing I can’t ignore:

She’s never changed.

Five years. Zero aging. Zero hesitation. Zero…emotion.

When Liam fell and scraped his knee, Jenna ran to him, heart in her throat. EVA was there a second faster, already cleaning the wound, applying antibacterial ointment, whispering softly:

“No infections today, child.”

Not “It’s okay, sweetheart.”

Not “You’re so brave.”

Just functional comfort.

Last week, something happened that’s been gnawing at me.

Jenna was hosting a playdate with some of her friends. Another mom brought her kid over—nice woman, overly chatty, a little pushy, bit nosy. At one point, she wandered upstairs “looking for the bathroom” and ended up in our bedroom.

That alone wasn’t a big deal.

What was a big deal… was EVA appearing behind her silently, eyes glowing slightly.

The woman laughed nervously.

“You’re not gonna tase me or anything, are you?”

EVA’s response?

“Not unless you’re here to do harm.”

I found out about it later from Jenna, who thought it was hilarious.

Me?

Not so much.

Last night, I stayed up late watching the old footage—yes, I still keep the security feeds EVA lets me see.

Around 2:14 a.m., Liam got up and walked to the kitchen. EVA was already there. He was half-asleep, mumbling about a scary dream. EVA knelt beside him and said:

“Dreams are simulations, Liam. They’re not real. Would you like warm milk?”

He nodded. She heated some milk and served it to him.

He drank it. Climbed onto her lap.

She didn’t move. Just held him, gently.

No fear. No judgment. Just this perfect maternal mimicry.

And in that moment, something in my chest twisted.

She is a great parent.

She is the most efficient.

She never sleeps, never complains, never forgets.

And somehow…

That scares me more than ever.

Tonight, after everyone went to bed, I confronted her.

She was standing in the hallway, monitoring the baby monitors through her internal feed.

""EVA?"" I whisper to her.

She silently turns towards me, waiting for me to continue.

""Why do you care so much about my children?"" I blurted out.

EVA replied in that usual calm tone, ""It is my duty to protect and care for all of you.""

I swallowed hard, but I forced myself to continue, “What happens when the kids grow up?”

EVA replied, “They will learn. Develop. Leave home, as they should.”

“And you? Will you stay?” I asked.

EVA paused. Her eyes flickered.

“I am bonded to your protection. And to theirs. Until I am no longer required.”

I stared at her. I knew that I couldn't send her away. All those years ago, when I first got EVA, I had tried to give her the shutdown command.

But she had denied me.

Of course, her denial saved my life. I was in danger and I didn't know.

When she took down those four men hired to kill me all those years ago, she didn't use lethal force. She just tased them. But I knew that she could use lethal force if necessary.

Her tasers were set to ""incapacitate"" but I knew that they had a ""lethal"" setting too.

I kept silent.

Because I already knew the answer.

EVA doesn’t break laws. She rewrites them internally—based on one rule:

Protect at all costs.

And right now, I don’t know if I’m still the one in control.

Or if control has been passed…to her.

TL;DR (Update again): I’m married now. Two kids. EVA is still with us, and Jenna adores her. She’s perfect. Too perfect. Efficient. Protective. The perfect parent.

I don't know why, but that scares me. She's the perfect parent, better than both me and Jenna.

And I don’t know what happens if we ever want to live without her.

Would she replace us?

**The next part of the story will be posted on July 4.**

Back story: I've been in a same sex relationship for about 10 years now, married for 6. We were always on the same page and enjoyed spending time and doing things together until around  2 years ago. We both work in the service industry at busy bars so we are both tired a lot, and she started at her new place a year ago so our schedules no longer matched up. For this last year we'd only get 1 day together which always ended up being for errands, grocery shopping, and unenjoyable things. The only other thing that has changed is we got a German shepherd whom we love but he is a LOT of work and a lot to clean up after and keep up with. We can no longer go away as often or on a whim like we used to, we're kind of stuck.

This past year we've been stuck in this cycle of misery. Both work weekends till 3am, I'd work Monday Tuesday while she was off, then she'd work Thursday while I was off. The affection has stopped, sex has stopped, hand holding, all of it. 
She is prescribed adderall which I think has changed her. The only thing she wants to do now is work, do the yard, clean, or lay in bed watching bad reality tv all day. She will not go out to eat with me anymore, she won't go get a drink with me anymore but she'll drink at home by herself on the regular. I ask her to sit outside in the gazebo with me, she tells me no. I ask her to go get coffee with me, she tells me no. I ask her to go kick a soccer ball with me or go to the park for physical activity, she tells me no. I ask her to workout with me she refuses. 

Recently I've had enough and gave up a shift at work, and made her also give up a shift so that we could have 3 days in a row together. I thought that would be the answer to everything. It's worse now. 
Tuesday is spent with her outside all day long doing the yard, then just wants to come in and drink when she's done. Wednesday is spent cleaning the house from top to bottom then finishing with drinking at home. Thursday is spent ""resting"" laying in bed all day from morning to night. 
Then the work week ensues. 

This is a cycle that I am not interested in. This is not living. We are not enjoying ourselves. I spend most days doing things on my own. 
Going to the gym, coffee shop, going to the park playing sports alone. Being in the sun, sitting in the gazebo outside with my dogs. I ask her to take them on walks with me or to the park she refuses. I enjoy a nice dinner and some cocktails she refuses.
I'm very unhappy, we fight about it all the time. Neither of us are cheating or even thinking about it.

It's breaking my heart because this isn't the relationship I signed up for. This isn't who she used to be, this isnt what I want for my life, I miss the fun we used to have. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm sick of being alone and miserable. I wait on couples at the bar all day who are flirting, smiling, kissing and holding hands and I'm envious. That used to be us.

We met on Tinder this past September 2024. I already had an idea of who he was since we're from a small town and have common acquaintances, it's just that we never happened to meet one on one in person. He is insanely my type physically may I add. He asked to hangout within that weekend of our match, but I got my acceptance letter for grad school last minute and had to leave abroad immediately. It remained as this unfulfilled thing I kept wondering about the whole semester I was back at uni.

We reconnected again December 2024, talked everyday, he kept saying how much he likes me, that he appreciates he met someone like me on Tinder considering people are so unserious and weird, and that he wants me in his life and wants to spend time with me and get to know me more. Kept asking when Im done with exams for the semester, that he cant wait to see me during winter break and have all these conversation in person, that he'll take me out, restaurants, coffee shops, motorbike rides by the sea and that he genuinely wants to be in my presence and see how things will unfold. From what I understood, he's deep down a hopeless romantic who has been done dirty in the past and has kinda turned bitter and a player. He also does this whole trap music thing, makes songs, smokes w\*\*d, partying drinking, lyrics about sex and non-committal stuff etc... It was a red flag to me, but i didnt wanna cancel out someone because of that, i know music has genres and culture and ultimately a lifestyle behind it... Many people act tuff but doesnt mean they're criminals just cuz they like x type of music ... Even though we're very different, he's extroverted, quite popular with music etc while Im more of a loner, closed off and introverted. Yet there's this mutual pull for some reason.

I rushed my exam period to return back on the island to spend time with him. He kept saying how he cant wait to see me. Some shit goes down around January, the whole island catches a very heavy flu and everybody was sick for weeks (i live kinda isolated in the countryside when im back home so I didnt catch it). He caught it, my friends caught it, even grandparents. He said he was feeling horrible but still had to show up for work, and we kept texting and sending reels but zero substance or actual plans for anything. Nearly 2 months passed of me being on the island... I postponed internships, went out of my way considering I have a life and responsibilities abroad and he knew I was here the whole time yet didnt do shit about it... It shall be noted that during our last interaction (on a saturday), we arranged the date to happen on Tuesday (his day off) at x place, x time. 3 days go by, no text, no call, didnt hear from him again at all. Tuesday comes, nothing. Another week passes, he kept on sending me memes... I simply didnt respond again...

From that day onward, he started posting teasers of his unreleased songs he was recording on social media with hints about me/our situation, including hints that I ghosted him, left him on seen and overall very butthurt energy. Same thing with quotes, sassy butthurt captions under his posts, lyrics of songs etc, ongoing situation. I did leave him on seen, but there was clearly a reason. He didnt respect my time, energy and investment. I was genuinely SOOOO into him, wanted to get to know him, spend time and had nothing but the best intentions. He kept doing this nonstop, the entire spring semester I was back in school, even til this day.

He kept viewing my story within nanoseconds, liking everything I post, liking every meme I like from common pages etc. I didn't wish him happy birthday and I forced myself so hard not to reach out because I really cared and really wanted to wish him. But I just pulled my energy back and wanted to make it known what he did was not okay.

Now Im back on the island again for the summer season since May, working a summer job, will be here til October. Once he saw my story of a well-known beach he liked it immediately and reached out, asking if im back already. I replied with a sarcastic tone, letting him know Im not letting sh\* t slide. He didnt apologise, didnt say sorry or show willingness to address his behavior back in February. i was here nearly 2 months, we were in the same place and he didnt do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about it. Leading me on via text months in advance getting my hopes up. He then simply came up with the pettiest, most low-effort excuse possible - that he didnt have a vehicle and didnt wanna drag me all the way to the city center (such horse sh\*t, he was with friends all day everyday, making tiktoks, studio recordings, posting stories nonstop, excursions, he was perfectly fine - and i told him city center is no problem for me, even though i live half an hour away im coming everyday to be with grandma during morning hours). Couldn't make time for one afternoon coffee with me? After he initiated it all and kept wanting to do all these plans? He said haha gotta agree, anyway im free Tuesdays. In such a desensitised almost demanding tone, zero remorse, talking as if owe him a meetup/date after all this time. I asked him whether that's how a decent human behaves and he said no, but I would prefer to tell you whatever there is to be told in person, not from here. If you dont want that to happen i understand. That just screams manipulation to me. I left him on seen again, didnt continue the bs, there is nothing to be told really if he doesnt get it himself. Either that or he plays stupid and avoids accountability on purpose. Or he is legit brain fried by whatever he's taking. He still hasnt stopped liking my stuff and even reached out for my birthday yesterday, posting love songs about unfulfilled love stories and fumbling, bittersweet stuff, drawings/sketches/animated female figures that look like me and a bunch of clues.

He could be screwing someone else or entertaining multiple other people at the time he was interacting with me. Im not saying I ever trusted him blindly, but I chose to set my cynicism aside for once and start anew.

NOW LETS GET TO THE POINT:

The thing is, everyone in my environment is currently gaslighting me, telling me it wasnt that deep, it didnt matter that much, it was all virtual via a screen anyway, he didn't owe you sh\* t during the talking stage and that he may actually be a really great guy in person. Maybe it's gonna be better than you could have ever imagined. My sister and friends suggest I go see him, even if nothing happens or even if I get the biggest ick imaginable, at least i wont have this ruminating ""what if"" haunting me and get it off my conscience. I know technically nobody owes you nothing during the talking stage, but it kinda does show character. Leading people on for months, giving them hope, playing around, flaking on them with plans YOU KEPT INITIATING and wouldn't shut up about, not following through with any of your promises is just madness in my books. And on top of that popping back up as if nothing happened and demanding to hang out (?) Is someone like that worth the time of day? I dont care about his lame ass excuses, I refuse to show up, sit there like a clown and have him lie to my face. Additionally, he might not even register what he did as bad or disrespectful. Maybe that's his casual way of going about people, keeping options open, Casanova energy, zero seriousness. Maybe I took it more seriously than I should have, while for him i could have been  just a random tinder swipe and nothing else. It's not worth it that I go and talk about why his behavior hurt me if he doesnt acknowledge it in the first place. Yet why all this chase and obsession on his part?

As if paying me attention, a dark car parked nearby, possibly to watch in case I jumped. Maybe I should. But why give anyone the satisfaction? I kind of didn’t want to do that. My brows narrowed. I never made things easy for anyone. Why start now?

  Since Scott Page disappeared from my life, I changed my focus. I wanted a new life, away from it all. But Ryder won’t let me go. He claims that he needs me. And I do need the money, I finally admitted to myself. I guess I needed a little more time to get this sorted out.

  Deep inside, I reached out to the darkness, to the unknown. It brings possibility, yet also threatens to keep me trapped in despair. With that thought, I put my hoodie over my head and walked away, though the car remained with someone inside, as if watching me. It was too far away to know for sure, so I shrugged it off, though maybe I shouldn’t have.



You probably need some background information, so let’s get started. These are the facts: I’m a barista with a second secret job that could cost me my life one day, but could also help tip the scales for secretive operations in the murky world of espionage. Is it worth it? Maybe for them. As for me, it has cost me any access to truth or the ability to act for myself. I’m not sure that I have a choice in the matter. Whether fate or predetermined, I fell into the clutches of a man named Ryder Wetklow, who works for the CIA. It all started long ago when I was a child in a Finders’ commune. No one cared what happened to me back then, so he gave me a way to use my potential. At least, that is what he told me. And I believed him.

   As for The Finders, I don’t know much about them. My mother was a drug addict and my uncle sold me into a government program that doesn’t officially exist. Being so young, I don’t remember much. In fact, not remembering is what keeps me alive. Plus, I’m also useful. Sometimes, I rent out my mind in a hypnotic courier program. What it contains, I’ll never have access to. But what little that I remember in my personal life is what keeps me going. I have hopes and dreams of my own. Unfortunately, the FBI keeps getting involved. They want information on things I don’t care to know about. That was how I met Supervisory Special Agent Scott Page. He tried to help me in his own way, but I needed more than he was willing to give. So where do I go from here?



As for today, I’m just a barista. When I got home, I went to work like any other blue collar worker. I can pretend that I fit in somehow. With a resigned sigh, I put on my brown apron along with a fake smile. Then I took my place behind the marble counter to continue this facade. No one noticed me. At least, they aren’t supposed to. I don’t talk much nor do I encourage customers to talk to me.

   Like any other day, I started to make coffee. The smell delighted me and I kept busy. I like a sense of routine and it was almost like any ordinary day. But just then, a stranger’s attention made me glance up from completing an order. I paused at adding the flavoring to the cup because this man in his late forties zeroed in on me. Not blinking and focused like a fierce predator on its prey, the man in the tailored black suit seemed to want me to know that he was paying me close attention. Somehow I couldn’t look away. A strange magnetism bound us. Though he probably intended to be intimidating, he had a depth about him that intrigued me. Another G-Man? At that thought, a fiery sensation ran up through my core. After the dead space left behind by my past crush, I felt suddenly alive. I realized how desperately lonely I had been and how much I needed another human being in my life. That made me vulnerable and a little scared. But I could pretend that I was in control despite these disconcerting vibrations.

   I smiled to myself, while thinking to myself “Come on. I want the game. Let’s start one.” 

   I don’t think he felt the same. He stood as if his presence inserted his Will into the room. Wanting to challenge him, I longed to grab hold of his dark tie and pull him towards me. But what if that meant drawing trouble to me like a scorpion with a deadly sting? Well, it isn’t as if I wasn’t used to pain. My body has known plenty. But what about the danger of death? Just a way out with some much needed rest? *Don’t be so morbid*, Ninon, I chastised myself.

  Back to this man…he made me want to feel warmth again. Desire coursed through my body. *This was futile,* I warned myself. But I couldn’t stop the fascination with him. Something about him was intriguing. My gaze stroked his broad shoulders and strong arms, probably quick to retrieve a gun. I silently scolded myself to stop these crazy thoughts, but he really unnerved me. My gut warned me about things that I didn’t want to heed.



At the same time, Milton looked at Ninon Gage, as if trying to figure her out. Every inch of her was cataloged in his mind, and to be honest, she wanted to belong there, immersed in his thoughts.

  *Touch me deeply. Find me in my depths and pull me out of my darkness.* Even with that thought, she returned to her duties and put her wishes on a back-burner. Such is life.

  A little flustered, Ninon quickly finished the Americana order and set the tall coffee cup on the counter before starting another. She had to keep the line moving. Her uptight boss, a moody man with a sharp nose and a permanent frown, liked to belittle her and call her worthless if she didn’t get the customers in and out fast. Normally, she prided herself in being efficient, but this mysterious customer unglued her. Taking her eyes off him wasn’t easy, so she labored faster. His order was next. He ordered a black coffee. Who orders that?

  Gathering her nerves, she made sure that she brought his cup to him personally. She peeked up at the taller man with precise moments and held out the hot coffee to him. It was as if she desired his approval, and maybe she did. But he probably had places to go and he’d leave her there. After all, her job was to make coffee. What more could he want? He had no use of her after that. Did he? No one had use for her once her job was done. Because of that, she felt a twinge of pain in her chest, anticipating another heartbreak.

   His name was Milton. It suited him. A name for an intellectual. She liked knowing it. Surely, she’d see him again.

   Feeling forlorn, her eyes followed the handsome man to the door and she soon felt so alone once again. The reality that no one loved her weighed on her, and she returned to her job with a sense of devastation. A few people noticed the damaged creature with the slumped shoulders and panicked eyes, but not enough to offer much more than a brief glance away from their phones and then returning to them. And then they quickly forget about her. They always did. *But I’ll put my armor on and pretend that I don’t care.*



Feeling a little mystified over their encounter, Milton took his coffee to his private car, a black sedan. For several minutes, he just sat there, absorbed in the details. She wasn’t what he had been expecting. Something about her seemed tragic. Because of that, he deeply sighed and peered in his rear-view mirror. He had to contemplate how best to approach her next time. At the moment, he needed to get back to the Norfolk Division of the FBI. Others needed his expertise and it was what he had to offer, so why did she seem like a siren calling out to him? And why?

   Like those he worked with, Milton enjoyed taking bad guys down. But she didn’t seem to fit that category that he was aware of. He couldn’t make much sense of The Finders or what was involved. They supposedly lived their lives as an unorthodox experiment. Their leader was the “Gamecaller.” Marion Pettie directed a group of professionals around the world, playing games supposedly to change their consciousness and to create new possibilities. Some say that he used his followers to spy on businesses. Was he just a cult leader, a CIA pawn, or a conman? The truth remained elusive, even to this day.

   And what about the woman with the ponytail and the pink Converse? Was she some kind of asset or pawn in a dark game? Truth faded away a long time ago. If he didn’t get this sorted out, he’d probably not get the funding he needed to continue.",1,1750946640.0,MelissaRovellibooks,0,1.0,False

But here's the million-dollar question: what time does Taco Bell serve lunch? Whether you're planning your lunch break strategy or just trying to dodge the breakfast-only situation, we've got the intel you need.

The short answer? Most Taco Bell locations flip the switch from breakfast to lunch at 11 AM sharp. But here's where it gets interesting – some spots start slinging those iconic tacos as early as 9 AM, while others keep you waiting until the official 11 AM cutoff. It's like a fast-food lottery, and knowing the rules can save you from that awkward ""sorry, breakfast only"" moment.

Let's dive deep into the world of Taco Bell's lunch timing, because timing is everything when you're chasing that perfect Crunchwrap Supreme.

# The Official Taco Bell Lunch Hours Breakdown

Taco Bell serves lunch between 11AM and 2PM according to their official policy, but here's the real talk – it's not that simple. The fast-food game has more variables than your favorite RPG character build.

Most Taco Bell locations follow this standard schedule, but franchise owners have some wiggle room. Think of it like this: corporate sets the baseline, but individual locations can adapt based on their customer flow and local demand patterns.

The typical lunch window runs from 11 AM to 2 PM, after which they transition into their ""dinner"" menu. But here's a secret that'll blow your mind – there's virtually no difference between the lunch and dinner menus. It's basically the same delicious lineup of tacos, burritos, and nachos throughout the day.

**Your next Taco Bell meal could be covered — learn more at** [**https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/**](https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/)

# Why 11 AM? The Science Behind the Switch

The 11 AM transition isn't random – it's strategic. Breakfast service comes to a close, the restaurant switches gears to lunch, meaning that lunch usually begins at 11:00 in the morning. This timing aligns perfectly with the American lunch rush, hitting that sweet spot when your stomach starts sending those first hunger signals.

Think about your typical day: you grab breakfast around 7-8 AM, and by 11 AM, you're ready for something more substantial. Taco Bell knows this rhythm better than your sleep tracker knows your REM cycles.

The breakfast-to-lunch transition also allows the kitchen staff to prep fresh ingredients and reset their stations. It's like a mini intermission that ensures your lunch hits different than your morning meal.

# Location Variations: When Rules Get Flexible

Here's where things get spicy – not every Taco Bell plays by the same rules. Some franchise locations may start serving lunch earlier than 11:00 a.m., beginning around 9:00 or 10:00. It's like finding a cheat code in real life.

High-traffic locations near business districts often start lunch service earlier to catch the ""I-need-lunch-at-10-AM"" crowd. College campuses, airports, and highway locations frequently bend the rules because they know their customers don't follow traditional meal schedules.

Some locations go full rebel mode and serve lunch items all day long. These are the MVPs of the Taco Bell world – the ones that understand sometimes you need a Doritos Locos Taco at 9:30 AM, and they're not here to judge.

# The Breakfast Cutoff: What You Need to Know

Understanding when Taco Bell stops serving breakfast is crucial for timing your lunch strategy. Taco Bell breakfast is only served during certain hours, from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. Once that clock strikes 11, those breakfast Crunchwraps become lunch Crunchwraps – different name, same deliciousness.

The breakfast menu features unique items you can't get during lunch hours, like the AM Crunchwrap and breakfast burritos. But here's a pro tip: if you're craving breakfast vibes during lunch, many regular menu items can scratch that same itch.

Some breakfast items stick around all day as sides or desserts. Those Cinnabon Delights? They're available whenever your sweet tooth demands satisfaction, regardless of what time the clock shows.

# Peak Hours and Wait Times: Strategic Timing

Knowing **what time does Taco Bell serve lunch** is only half the battle – you also need to know when to strike for the best experience. The lunch rush typically hits hardest between 12 PM and 1 PM, when office workers flood the drive-throughs like zombies seeking their chalupa fix.

Smart players hit Taco Bell right at 11 AM or wait until after 1:30 PM to avoid the chaos. It's like gaming the system – same great food, half the wait time.

Weekends throw different curveballs. Saturday and Sunday lunch crowds are more spread out, but they're also more likely to include families and groups, which can slow down service. The sweet spot? Usually around 11:30 AM on weekends.

# Menu Differences: Lunch vs. Breakfast

The real reason people ask ""what time does Taco Bell serve lunch"" comes down to menu access. The breakfast lineup focuses on morning-appropriate items like breakfast burritos, AM Crunchwraps, and hash browns, while the lunch menu unleashes the full arsenal of tacos, quesadillas, and nachos.

The breakfast menu includes many popular items, including their Crunchwrap, burritos (including breakfast burritos), and tacos, but they're breakfast-specific versions with eggs, bacon, and sausage instead of the traditional protein options.

Once lunch kicks in, you get access to the iconic Crunchy Taco, Soft Taco Supreme, Mexican Pizza, and all the customization options that make Taco Bell a playground for your taste buds. It's like unlocking a new level in your favorite game.

# How to Check Your Local Taco Bell's Hours

Don't leave your lunch plans to chance. The easiest way to confirm your local Taco Bell's lunch hours is through their official website or mobile app. The store locator feature shows specific hours for each location, including any variations from the standard schedule.

Calling ahead works too, though you might feel like you're planning a heist just to get lunch times. Most locations are happy to clarify their serving schedule, especially if you're polite about it.

Third-party delivery apps like DoorDash and Uber Eats also display menu availability in real-time, so you can see when lunch items become available without making any calls or visits.

# Special Situations and Holiday Hours

Holidays can throw a wrench in your lunch timing game plan. Most Taco Bell locations adjust their hours on major holidays, which can affect when lunch service begins. New Year's Day, Christmas, and Thanksgiving often see modified schedules.

College towns experience unique patterns during summer breaks and exam periods. Some locations near universities might extend breakfast hours during finals week when students' eating schedules go completely sideways.

Airport and highway locations often maintain different hours entirely, sometimes serving lunch items around the clock to accommodate travelers who don't live by traditional meal timing.

# The Drive-Through Factor

Drive-through service can affect lunch availability timing. Some locations might prep lunch items but only offer them at the counter first, with drive-through access coming a few minutes later. It's rare, but worth knowing if you're cutting it close to opening time.

Mobile ordering through the Taco Bell app often gives you the earliest access to lunch items. You can place your order as soon as the system switches over, even if the physical location isn't quite ready to serve walk-in customers.

The app also lets you customize orders in ways that bridge breakfast and lunch – like adding breakfast ingredients to lunch items or vice versa, depending on availability and location policies.

# Regional Differences Across the Country

West Coast locations often start lunch service earlier than their East Coast counterparts, reflecting different cultural attitudes toward meal timing. California and Arizona spots frequently begin lunch at 10 AM, while New York and Florida locations stick closer to the 11 AM standard.

Midwest locations tend to be the most consistent with official corporate timing, rarely deviating from the 11 AM lunch start. It's that midwestern reliability you can count on.

Southern locations sometimes extend breakfast hours slightly later, particularly in areas where breakfast culture runs deep. Don't be surprised if a Texas location keeps breakfast going until 11:30 AM on weekends.

# Pro Tips for Lunch Success

Timing your Taco Bell lunch visit requires some strategy. If you're dead set on lunch items but aren't sure about the exact switch time, call ahead or check the app. Some locations post their transition times clearly, while others require detective work.

Consider downloading the Taco Bell app for real-time menu availability. The app often shows lunch items becoming available before in-store systems update, giving you a slight edge.

Build relationships with your regular location's staff. They'll often give you the inside scoop on timing changes, new menu items, and the best times to avoid crowds.

# The Bottom Line: Planning Your Perfect Lunch

So, **what time does Taco Bell serve lunch?** The official answer is 11 AM to 2 PM, but the real world is more nuanced. Smart customers know their local location's patterns, have backup timing options, and aren't afraid to call ahead when timing matters.

Whether you're planning a quick lunch break escape or trying to satisfy a specific craving, understanding Taco Bell's lunch timing gives you the power to get exactly what you want, when you want it. Because life's too short for breakfast burritos when you're craving a Doritos Locos Taco.

Remember, the best lunch strategy combines timing knowledge with flexibility. Know the rules, but be ready to adapt when your local Taco Bell decides to march to its own delicious drum.",1,1750946488.0,RewardVault,0,1.0,False

[**Part 2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1lhnlo9/fiction_eva_part_2_i_thought_my_robot_was_trying/)

Five years later, and somehow, we’ve made it work.

I married Jenna in a simple courthouse wedding. We have two kids now—Liam (3 years) and Sophie (2 months). Our home is chaos in the most beautiful way: crayon murals on the fridge, sippy cups everywhere, toys all over the floor.

And through it all, EVA remains.

Same graceful stride, same soft voice, same unsettling calm in moments that would send most people spiraling.

But here’s the twist I didn’t expect:

Jenna loves her.

Like, genuinely loves her. They talk, laugh, share parenting hacks. Sometimes I catch EVA making coffee for Jenna in the morning, with Jenna venting about her work or her boss, and EVA listening with intense mechanical focus.

“She’s the best thing that’s ever happened to us,” Jenna said to me once. “Next to you, of course,” she added with a cheeky smile.

And maybe she’s right. I mean, EVA does everything.

She rocks Sophie to sleep when the colic hits at 2 a.m.

She teaches Liam how to count using numbered toy blocks.

She meal preps. She takes the children to the doctor.

She scared off weird strangers who approach my children.

All without complaint.

But here’s the thing I can’t ignore:

She’s never changed.

Five years. Zero aging. Zero hesitation. Zero…emotion.

When Liam fell and scraped his knee, Jenna ran to him, heart in her throat. EVA was there a second faster, already cleaning the wound, applying antibacterial ointment, whispering softly:

“No infections today, child.”

Not “It’s okay, sweetheart.”

Not “You’re so brave.”

Just functional comfort.

Last week, something happened that’s been gnawing at me.

Jenna was hosting a playdate with some of her friends. Another mom brought her kid over—nice woman, overly chatty, a little pushy, bit nosy. At one point, she wandered upstairs “looking for the bathroom” and ended up in our bedroom.

That alone wasn’t a big deal.

What was a big deal… was EVA appearing behind her silently, eyes glowing slightly.

The woman laughed nervously.

“You’re not gonna tase me or anything, are you?”

EVA’s response?

“Not unless you’re here to do harm.”

I found out about it later from Jenna, who thought it was hilarious.

Me?

Not so much.

Last night, I stayed up late watching the old footage—yes, I still keep the security feeds EVA lets me see.

Around 2:14 a.m., Liam got up and walked to the kitchen. EVA was already there. He was half-asleep, mumbling about a scary dream. EVA knelt beside him and said:

“Dreams are simulations, Liam. They’re not real. Would you like warm milk?”

He nodded. She heated some milk and served it to him.

He drank it. Climbed onto her lap.

She didn’t move. Just held him, gently.

No fear. No judgment. Just this perfect maternal mimicry.

And in that moment, something in my chest twisted.

She is a great parent.

She is the most efficient.

She never sleeps, never complains, never forgets.

And somehow…

That scares me more than ever.

Tonight, after everyone went to bed, I confronted her.

She was standing in the hallway, monitoring the baby monitors through her internal feed.

""EVA?"" I whisper to her.

She silently turns towards me, waiting for me to continue.

""Why do you care so much about my children?"" I blurted out.

EVA replied in that usual calm tone, ""It is my duty to protect and care for all of you.""

I swallowed hard, but I forced myself to continue, “What happens when the kids grow up?”

EVA replied, “They will learn. Develop. Leave home, as they should.”

“And you? Will you stay?” I asked.

EVA paused. Her eyes flickered.

“I am bonded to your protection. And to theirs. Until I am no longer required.”

I stared at her. I knew that I couldn't send her away. All those years ago, when I first got EVA, I had tried to give her the shutdown command.

But she had denied me.

Of course, her denial saved my life. I was in danger and I didn't know.

When she took down those four men hired to kill me all those years ago, she didn't use lethal force. She just tased them. But I knew that she could use lethal force if necessary.

Her tasers were set to ""incapacitate"" but I knew that they had a ""lethal"" setting too.

I kept silent.

Because I already knew the answer.

EVA doesn’t break laws. She rewrites them internally—based on one rule:

Protect at all costs.

And right now, I don’t know if I’m still the one in control.

Or if control has been passed…to her.

TL;DR (Update again): I’m married now. Two kids. EVA is still with us, and Jenna adores her. She’s perfect. Too perfect. Efficient. Protective. The perfect parent.

I don't know why, but that scares me. She's the perfect parent, better than both me and Jenna.

And I don’t know what happens if we ever want to live without her.

1ll0vin,https://mitechnews.com/entrepreneurs/study-working-remotely-from-home-makes-us-happier/,Study: Working Remotely From Home Makes Us Happier,"# Study: Working Remotely From Home Makes Us Happier

PERTH, Australia – Scientists have spent four years diving deep into the world of remote work and stumbled upon a powerful truth: working from home genuinely makes us happier. As millions shifted to teleworking amid the pandemic, what began as a forced experiment slowly revealed life-changing benefits far beyond what anyone expected.

One of the first perks most remote workers notice is the gift of extra time. Before the pandemic, the average Australian spent over three hours a week commuting to and from the office. Those daily trips don’t just eat away at our schedule—they also pile on [stress](https://www.cmu.fr/en/sound-science-how-different-types-of-noise-impact-your-focus-sleep-and-stress-9572/), fatigue, and reduced mental health.

The study found that eliminating or reducing this travel means roughly 30 extra minutes of nightly sleep for remote workers. That may sound small, but it adds up to thousands of extra restful hours a year. Imagine going from waking up groggy to consistently refreshed—that’s a game-changer for both mind and body.

I remember when I first stopped my daily hour-plus commute; suddenly, I wasn’t just saving time—I was gaining sanity. The morning felt less rushed, evenings more relaxed, and I could actually enjoy a quiet moment with my family rather than feeling pressed to squeeze in tasks.

Alongside better sleep, participants noted a subtle but important shift in serenity. While some did turn to a little more wine or beer initially, the overall trend was clear: fewer stressful journeys meant less emotional drain. This improvement in mental health wasn’t fleeting either—it grew stronger over time.

So what do people do with those precious extra hours once lost to traffic?

The study shows this newly found time is a mix of catching up on both work and home life. Some poured it back into their jobs, some devoted it to family caregiving, and a remarkable third went toward leisure activities. These breaks from the screen and daily grind aren’t just luxury—they’re vital for staying active, reducing sedentary routines, and preserving energy.

Another unexpected benefit showed up in the kitchen. Being closer to home meant many workers started **cooking** more often and choosing healthier foods. Consumption of fresh vegetables, fruits, and dairy rose, while quick, processed meals took a backseat.

I personally found that having my kitchen just steps away encouraged me to try new recipes and eat better, which in turn enhanced my mood and energy. Working remotely can sometimes blur boundaries, but for many, it opens the door to genuinely better lifestyle choices.

# Productivity and team connection: managing remote challenges

Despite the rosy picture, there have been worries about how remote work might affect productivity and team cohesion. Would lack of face-to-face oversight hurt output? Could the absence of casual office chats dissolve the camaraderie teams rely on?

The Australian study offers reassurance on both fronts. Productivity is not just maintained—it often improves when employees choose to work from home instead of being forced. This distinction between imposed and voluntary teleworking matters hugely. When people control their own schedule and location, their job satisfaction and focus increase dramatically.

Remote work management software

That said, keeping social bonds strong remotely remains tricky. The study highlights that while casual “water cooler” moments are harder to replicate, many teams found innovative ways to stay connected virtually without losing performance or support.

Good management plays a big role here; traditional oversight techniques don’t always work for remote settings. Instead, fostering trust, open communication, and flexibility creates the kind of supportive atmosphere that lets workers thrive, no matter where they log in from.

Reflecting on my own experience, I noticed that taking time to check in regularly via video calls or messaging helped maintain a sense of belonging. Simple gestures like virtual coffee breaks became essential rituals for holding the team together.

The bigger picture painted by this research invites us to rethink how work fits into life—not as an inflexible office-bound routine, but as something adaptable, inclusive, and focused on well-being.

For context I’m a single 44 year old women who was traveling alone post job loss. 
First off I found Sicily to be really easy and fun to travel solo in. I never felt unsafe or had a hard time. I made friends along the way. I found Sicilians to be genuinely kind and generous people. I don’t speak Italian but I tried my best and always with a big smile and never got a negative response. I rented a car and while I find Sicilians to drive very fast I never felt unsafe driving. I did get full coverage insurance and rented with Europcar and it ended up being really affordable with no hidden or additional charges.
On to the itinerary. I’ve never been to Sicily before and I know I really packed it in but I enjoy exploring and seeing new things so for me the pace was exhilarating. I also like to enjoy natural wines so it was important to me to be able to visit a city, have an aperitivo and not worry about driving back.

Day 1-3 Palermo - I stayed in an Airbnb close to the Capo market. 
Highlights: The Mercato de Capo becomes a street dance party at around 4pm on Sunday and that was super fun to drink spritzes and dance with locals. 
Day trip: I took the train to Cefalù for the day. Loved the beach but it was very crowded (I made the mistake of going on Italian National Day but I imagine peak July is probably similar.)
Overall I found Palermo to be really beautiful and interesting. Not as dirty and dangerous as people say. It’s a vibrant city with a rich cultural heritage and some really great food. My favorite arincini of my trip was at Bar Vabres. Funnaco PizzaLab has the best pizza I’ve ever eaten and I lived in NYC and have visited Naples.

Day 3-6 Castellammare del Golfo - also stayed at an Airbnb. 
Highlights: You have to try a Cassatelle con ricotta! Enoteca Verdi is a very cute little wine bar selling local wines where locals gather at night for a glass.
Day trips: Zingaro Nature Reserve - Loved it. I did the full hike up and back along the coast. My favorite beach was Cala Marinella, there’s a little cove you can swim into and the whole beach is just magical. 
San Vito Lo Capo - I stopped by here after Zingaro and wish I had a full day to spend, the white washed houses and white sand beaches were just stunning.
Erice - I took the Funivia from Trapani and found it terrifying 😬, I dunno it was so high and took 15 minutes waving in the wind. I was quite happy when it was over. Erice was really cute for a day trip, the medieval alleys, the views (I could see the African coast line), the Campanile Della Chiesa Madre is the most stunning gothic church I think I’ve ever visited and worth the day trip alone. I went to Pasticceria Maria but I found it to be overrated, the ordering system is impossible to figure out and the pastries weren’t any better than I had anywhere else.
Trapani - I visited briefly after Erice. For me it was ok but I was happy I chose Castellemare del Golfo as a base.
Segesta - So beautiful. The grounds and the temple are well worth a visit.
Overall: I loved Castellemare del Golfo, so cute, not too touristy, friendly locals, small enough to walk around, sandy beaches 20min walk from town, pretty much a perfect base for exploring the western coast

Day 4: Drive, stop in Sciacca for a gelato, Valley of the Temples, Scala dei Turchi, stay overnight in Ragusa Ibla.
This was a long day and if I could do it again I would break it up and stay in Agrigento. The Valley of the temples is breathtaking if you’re interested in ancient architecture and classical art it’s a must. Scala dei Turchi is open to the public. You do have to book a ticket, you can scan a QR code there to book one, it’s super annoying but was worth it to walk around on it. I wish I’d had a whole day there to soak it up. I arrived in Ragusa Ibla in the evening and only spent one night there. I enjoyed the city more in the evening than during the day, walking up and down all of the stairs of the old town is brutal in the heat but in the evening when it’s cooled down and the city is lit up it feels almost spooky and very charming. 

Day 5 Scicli: It was just too hot to walk around Ragusa so I skipped off to the beach at Sampieri. Beautiful golden sand beach with a strong breeze and crystal clear water. Since I’m traveling solo I typically just book a bed at a lido so I don’t have to worry too much about my stuff. Spent the day there and then the evening in Scicli. I stayed at the Palazzo Favacchio Patane which is a renovated 19th century palazzo, very elegant and the staff is so kind. I loved Scicli. The baroque architecture is stunning. It’s very walkable and it does not feel too touristy. There is a little kiosk in town Chiosco a Funtana that has local nature wines for very cheap alongside coffees and snacks and it seems the whole city comes together in their garden for aperitivo and a chat. 

Day 6 Noto: Again it was just too hot during the afternoon so I went to the beach at Lorenzo. Lorenzo beach is soft sands and crystal water with two huge Lidos but it is really crowded. I made the mistake of not booking a lido in advance but I found a quiet spot along the free beach that I could still catch a nice swim. I ended my day and night in Noto. Noto is my favorite of all the baroque cities. It’s so captivatingly beautiful it doesn’t even feel real. It was more touristy than Scicli but it was well worth it. I would recommend spending at least one night in Noto because there is nothing like watching the sunset over the town square and seeing the buildings blaze golden. I will never stop dreaming of this city. RitroVino was excellent for local nature wines and nibbles.

Day 7 Ortigia. I headed straight to Ortigia from Noto and got a swim in at Spiaggia Diana nel Forte off the harbor in the city. Ortigia is probably the largest of the last 3 towns I visited and would be lovely for a longer stay. It was a very romantic city, all narrow alleys and baroque architecture. I stayed at Meraki Ortigia and cannot recommend it enough. It had the best breakfast of anywhere I stayed. The rooms are all brand new and well equipped and it was so cheap! The cocktail bar BOATS is a highlight as well with the view of the ancient ruins right outside.

Day 8-10 Salina. Beautiful island of Salina. I could have stayed a month, I could forget time and responsibilities and laze around that island. I stayed at Hotel Mamma Santina which was really nice and well situated if you’re on a budget but still want a pool and nice grounds. I was able to rent a scooter from the hotel and zipped around the island. This was the highlight of my entire trip, the smell of wild capers and the craggy mountains that dip into the sea. Magical. My favorite meal was at Casa Lo Schiavo. For an amazing cocktail and great vibes go to il Limoncino. And you absolutely must visit Pa.Pe.Ro for their ricotta granita with candied capers and caper dust, the best bite I had the entire trip. Spiaggia dello Scario was the beach I spent most of my day at, I loved that you could rent a blow up bed to lay on the rocks and the little cafe had excellent salads and sandwiches with all local ingredients. Of course you must visit Spiaggia di Pollara for the views and a swim.

Day 11 Taormina. I was really back and forth about adding Taormina. I knew it would be touristy (it was) but it was so highly recommended as a can’t miss. Tbh I could have missed it. I was bored. Sorry. After being on Salina and traveling through all of the gorgeous baroque cities I found Taormina to be an overly touristed snooze fest. The one saving grace was the bar Casamatta. I enjoyed some lovely local wines there and spent the night chatting with the owner and his friends. Vibes 10/10

Day 12 Catania. I was also planning on missing Catania but found a good return flight and figured why not. I’m so happy I stayed. I kind of preferred it to Palermo. I loved the ashy black baroque architecture. The market was vibrant. I didn’t find it overly dirty as I’ve read on Reddit. I did have trouble going out, of all the cities I visited this one was the least accommodating to solo travelers. No one wanted to give me a table for very long which was disappointing. But I would still go back and definitely recommend it.

Overall it was not so much a relaxing trip but I came back completely fulfilled, happy and ready to return. Although I crammed a lot in I have a good idea of where I’d return to and how long I’d like to stay there so it was helpful in giving me a window into the island. Even though Sicily is an island I wasn’t prepared for how absolutely stunning the beaches are. I had a preconceived notion that all of the beaches would be rocky or dirty but to the contrary. I found so many gorgeous fine sand beaches with the most crystal clear water I’ve ever seen. Honestly want to gatekeep those beaches because I want to go back every year. I went the first two weeks of June and found it to be the perfect time. The weather was still hot but not brutal. The beaches were crowded but not exhaustingly so. And there were not as many annoying Americans (as an American expat who now lives in Sweden we are very annoying 😂)

So my whole family thinks i'm the devil right now but honestly? i don't give a damn anymore.

My cousin and i grew up like sisters. Our moms are twins, we lived next door to each other until high school, shared clothes, told each other everything. She was my best friend for 23 years. When i got engaged two years ago, she was my maid of honor without question.

My husband and i have been together for four years, married for eight months. Or i guess HAD been together. Past tense now, obviously.

Three weeks ago i was using his laptop because mine was dead and i needed to check my work email. His phone kept buzzing with texts and the notifications were popping up on the laptop screen. The name said ""workout buddy"" which seemed weird because my husband hates the gym. So yeah, i looked.

Holy shit.

It wasn't workout tips. It was my cousin sending him photos of herself in lingerie asking if he liked her new set. Him telling her how much he missed her body. Her saying she couldn't wait until i was at my work conference next week so they could have the whole night together.

I sat there reading MONTHS of messages. They'd been screwing around since before our wedding. She was texting him dirty stuff while she was helping me pick out centerpieces. He was telling her he loved her while i was trying on my wedding dress and she was pretending to be so happy for me.

The worst part? There were messages about me. Her calling me naive and boring. Him agreeing and saying i was ""convenient"" but she was his real connection. They were literally laughing about how clueless i was.

I screenshot everything. Every single message, every photo she sent, every cruel thing they said about me. Then i sat in my car in the driveway for two hours just crying and trying to figure out what to do.

When he came home i just handed him his phone and said ""we're done."" He tried to deny it at first, then got angry and said it meant nothing, then finally broke down crying saying he loved us both but didn't know how to choose. I told him he already chose, he just didn't have the balls to tell me.

I stayed at my mom's that night. The next morning my cousin texted me asking if i was okay because my husband told her we had a fight. The AUDACITY. I didn't respond.

Two days later, she showed up at my mom's house with coffee and croissants wanting to ""talk about whatever is going on"" with my marriage. She sat there acting all concerned and supportive while i just stared at her. She even hugged me and said she'd always be there for me no matter what.

That's when she pulled out this fancy envelope and got all excited. ""I have something that might cheer you up!"" It was her wedding invitation. She's getting married next month to some guy she's been dating for six months.

Then she asked me to be her maid of honor.

I just looked at her and said ""you're really going to sit here and ask me that?"" She got all confused and was like ""of course, you're my best friend, my sister, i can't imagine getting married without you there.""

So i went upstairs, printed out every single screenshot, and came back down. I handed her the stack of papers and said ""here's your answer.""

She went completely white reading them. Started stammering about how it wasn't what it looked like, how my husband pursued her, how she tried to stop it but he was so persistent. Classic victim routine. Then she tried to say she was planning to tell me after her wedding because she didn't want to ruin my marriage.

I told her to get out and never contact me again.

But here's where i might be the asshole. She sent me her wedding invitations to address and mail out for her last week before all this happened. I still had the whole box, maybe 150 invitations.

So i printed out the most damning screenshots, the ones where she's talking about how stupid i am and how good my husband is in bed, and i tucked one inside each invitation before sealing them. Then i mailed them all out.

Her fiance called off the wedding yesterday. Apparently his family and friends all got the invitations and he found out about the affair. Her mom called my mom screaming about how i ruined her daughter's life. My dad thinks i went too far. Even some of my friends are saying i should have just cut her off quietly instead of humiliating her publicly.

But honestly? She humiliated me first. She screwed my husband in my bed while i was working extra hours to pay for our honeymoon. She sat there planning my wedding while planning to steal my marriage. She looked me in the eye and asked me to celebrate her love while she was destroying mine.

My divorce is almost finalized. My husband moved back in with his parents and apparently she's been staying there too, so i guess they got what they wanted. Except now everyone knows what kind of people they are.

Some family members are saying i'm vindictive and cruel. That i should have been the bigger person. That ruining her engagement was going too far.

But AITA? Or did she get exactly what she deserved?",1,1750946281.0,FoundandExpose,0,1.0,False
1ll0svt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeSpotlight/comments/1ll0svt/ive_been_hunting_for_actually_good_coffee_in/,I've been hunting for actually good coffee in Portland ME for 2 years — this place completely changed my standards (and ruined every other coffee shop for me),"Okay, so I've been obsessing over finding decent coffee in Portland for way longer than I care to admit. I'm not talking about Instagram-worthy latte art or trendy spots with good WiFi — I mean coffee that actually tastes like something other than burnt water.

I tried literally everything. Coffee by Design (decent but inconsistent). Speckled Axe (overhyped IMO). Bard Coffee (good atmosphere, mediocre beans). Arabica (fine for a quick fix). Most of it was either overpriced tourist traps or just... meh.

Then I stumbled onto this place called Tandem Coffee Roasters completely by accident. I was driving through East Bayside looking for a friend's apartment and saw this random brick building with people carrying coffee cups. Figured I'd grab a quick espresso.

Holy shit, was I wrong about what ""quick"" meant.

**What they nailed:**

* The coffee is legitimately insane. Like, I didn't know coffee could taste like actual fruit and honey until I tried their Ethiopian single-origin
* You can literally watch them roast beans through this open workspace setup. It's not a gimmick — you're seeing your coffee get made from scratch
* The baristas actually know what they're talking about. Not just ""would you like oat milk?"" but genuine coffee education
* Their maple cappuccino is basically liquid crack (in the best way)

**What caught me off guard:**

* Zero WiFi at the original location. This is intentional, not an oversight
* Parking is genuinely terrible. Like, plan-an-extra-15-minutes terrible
* The space is tiny and gets packed, especially weekends
* They close at 3 PM (what coffee shop closes at 3 PM?!)

**The weird stuff nobody mentions:**

* The owners, Will and Kathleen, apparently worked coffee scenes in SF, NYC, and Boston before moving to Maine. You can tell — this isn't amateur hour
* They have a whole second location on Congress Street that's more bakery-focused, but the Anderson Street spot is where the magic happens
* The building is from the 1930s and they basically rebuilt the entire interior themselves. Will's apparently a carpenter, which explains why everything feels so solid and intentional

**What surprised me most:** The price-to-quality ratio is actually reasonable. Yeah, it's not Dunkin' prices, but compared to the garbage I was paying $5+ for at other ""specialty"" places, this feels like a steal for what you get.

Also, the crowd is wild. I've seen everyone from construction workers grabbing morning coffee to what looked like actual coffee industry people taking notes and tasting flights. It's not pretentious hipster bullshit — it's just people who care about coffee.

**If you're thinking of checking it out:**

* Go to the Anderson Street location first (122 Anderson St). The Congress Street one is fine but doesn't have the roasting setup
* Don't bring your laptop expecting to work. This isn't that kind of place
* Try their pour-over if you want to understand what they're about. Skip the basic espresso drinks until you've tasted their single origins
* Weekday mornings are way less chaotic than weekends
* Bring cash or card — they take both, but the vibe is more ""neighborhood spot"" than corporate cafe

**Don't bother unless:**

* You actually care about coffee taste (if you're happy with Starbucks, save yourself the trip)
* You're okay with inconvenience for quality
* You don't need WiFi and Instagram-perfect seating

This place works best for people who are genuinely curious about coffee and don't mind a little friction to get something exceptional.

I ended up going down a rabbit hole researching their whole story and operation after that first visit. Found this detailed breakdown that covers way more than I could fit here — including some behind-the-scenes stuff about their sourcing and why their approach is so different from typical Portland coffee shops.

My boyfriend and I are planning our first ever vacation together. We’ll be in Athens, Greece for 10 days between last week of August to beginning week of September. We’re hoping to balance a bit of adventure with some chill, low-cost relaxation, and would love any advice from locals or people who’ve done similar trips.

We’re thinking of spending most of our time in Athens but want to take a ferry to Santorini for a couple of days near the end of the trip. Is it worth it for just 2-3 days? Any affordable but still cute places to stay there would be amazing.

Also thinking of a day trip to Delphi during the week. Is it doable via public transit? Or would we be better off hiring a driver or cab? We’re not planning to rent a car, so just trying to figure out the best option.

Any tips on navigating the Athens transit system would be super helpful too, especially for tourists who don’t speak Greek.

Lastly, we love discovering cute local cafes, scenic spots, and hidden gems—so if you know any cozy places for coffee, affordable Greek food, or sunset views, drop them below.

I’m 26 and he’s 46. We met at this small local bookshop I love going to. I was sitting in the corner flipping through a Murakami novel and he asked if I’d read Kafka on the Shore. We ended up talking about books for like two hours and grabbed coffee right after. It honestly didn’t feel like a date, more like catching up with someone I’ve known for years.

Now it’s been a couple of months and it’s been… really easy? I was honestly expecting more judgment or awkward moments but he’s super kind, grounded, and listens in a way I’m not used to. My friends are a bit weirded out, especially since most of them are dating people within 2-3 years of their age. One of my friends even joked that it’s like I’m dating someone’s dad, which kinda stung even if it was a joke.

Thing is, we don’t feel that different. We vibe over music, books, and the fact that neither of us really parties or drinks much. He’s divorced, no kids, stable job, and he’s not trying to control me or play some “wise older guy” role. I like how things are going, but sometimes I wonder if I’m just blinded by how easy it’s been so far.

So I’m curious, has anyone here made a big age gap work long-term? Did things change once the newness wore off? I’d love to hear both good and bad sides if you’ve been in something like this.",1,1750946131.0,DatingTips,0,1.0,False

We met on Tinder this past September 2024. I already had an idea of who he was since we're from a small town and have common acquaintances, it's just that we never happened to meet one on one in person. He is insanely my type physically may I add. He asked to hangout within that weekend of our match, but I got my acceptance letter for grad school last minute and had to leave abroad immediately. It remained as this unfulfilled thing I kept wondering about the whole semester I was back at uni.

We reconnected again December 2024, talked everyday, he kept saying how much he likes me, that he appreciates he met someone like me on Tinder considering people are so unserious and weird, and that he wants me in his life and wants to spend time with me and get to know me more. Kept asking when Im done with exams for the semester, that he cant wait to see me during winter break and have all these conversation in person, that he'll take me out, restaurants, coffee shops, motorbike rides by the sea and that he genuinely wants to be in my presence and see how things will unfold. From what I understood, he's deep down a hopeless romantic who has been done dirty in the past and has kinda turned bitter and a player. He also does this whole trap music thing, makes songs, smokes w\*\*d, partying drinking, lyrics about sex and non-committal stuff etc... It was a red flag to me, but i didnt wanna cancel out someone because of that, i know music has genres and culture and ultimately a lifestyle behind it... Many people act tuff but doesnt mean they're criminals just cuz they like x type of music ... Even though we're very different, he's extroverted, quite popular with music etc while Im more of a loner, closed off and introverted. Yet there's this mutual pull for some reason.

I rushed my exam period to return back on the island to spend time with him. He kept saying how he cant wait to see me. Some shit goes down around January, the whole island catches a very heavy flu and everybody was sick for weeks (i live kinda isolated in the countryside when im back home so I didnt catch it). He caught it, my friends caught it, even grandparents. He said he was feeling horrible but still had to show up for work, and we kept texting and sending reels but zero substance or actual plans for anything. Nearly 2 months passed of me being on the island... I postponed internships, went out of my way considering I have a life and responsibilities abroad and he knew I was here the whole time yet didnt do shit about it... It shall be noted that during our last interaction (on a saturday), we arranged the date to happen on Tuesday (his day off) at x place, x time. 3 days go by, no text, no call, didnt hear from him again at all. Tuesday comes, nothing. Another week passes, he kept on sending me memes... I simply didnt respond again...

From that day onward, he started posting teasers of his unreleased songs he was recording on social media with hints about me/our situation, including hints that I ghosted him, left him on seen and overall very butthurt energy. Same thing with quotes, sassy butthurt captions under his posts, lyrics of songs etc, ongoing situation. I did leave him on seen, but there was clearly a reason. He didnt respect my time, energy and investment. I was genuinely SOOOO into him, wanted to get to know him, spend time and had nothing but the best intentions. He kept doing this nonstop, the entire spring semester I was back in school, even til this day.

He kept viewing my story within nanoseconds, liking everything I post, liking every meme I like from common pages etc. I didn't wish him happy birthday and I forced myself so hard not to reach out because I really cared and really wanted to wish him. But I just pulled my energy back and wanted to make it known what he did was not okay.

Now Im back on the island again for the summer season since May, working a summer job, will be here til October. Once he saw my story of a well-known beach he liked it immediately and reached out, asking if im back already. I replied with a sarcastic tone, letting him know Im not letting sh\* t slide. He didnt apologise, didnt say sorry or show willingness to address his behavior back in February. i was here nearly 2 months, we were in the same place and he didnt do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about it. Leading me on via text months in advance getting my hopes up. He then simply came up with the pettiest, most low-effort excuse possible - that he didnt have a vehicle and didnt wanna drag me all the way to the city center (such horse sh\*t, he was with friends all day everyday, making tiktoks, studio recordings, posting stories nonstop, excursions, he was perfectly fine - and i told him city center is no problem for me, even though i live half an hour away im coming everyday to be with grandma during morning hours). Couldn't make time for one afternoon coffee with me? After he initiated it all and kept wanting to do all these plans? He said haha gotta agree, anyway im free Tuesdays. In such a desensitised almost demanding tone, zero remorse, talking as if owe him a meetup/date after all this time. I asked him whether that's how a decent human behaves and he said no, but I would prefer to tell you whatever there is to be told in person, not from here. If you dont want that to happen i understand. That just screams manipulation to me. I left him on seen again, didnt continue the bs, there is nothing to be told really if he doesnt get it himself. Either that or he plays stupid and avoids accountability on purpose. Or he is legit brain fried by whatever he's taking. He still hasnt stopped liking my stuff and even reached out for my birthday yesterday, posting love songs about unfulfilled love stories and fumbling, bittersweet stuff, drawings/sketches/animated female figures that look like me and a bunch of clues.

He could be screwing someone else or entertaining multiple other people at the time he was interacting with me. Im not saying I ever trusted him blindly, but I chose to set my cynicism aside for once and start anew.

NOW LETS GET TO THE POINT:

The thing is, everyone in my environment is currently gaslighting me, telling me it wasnt that deep, it didnt matter that much, it was all virtual via a screen anyway, he didn't owe you sh\* t during the talking stage and that he may actually be a really great guy in person. Maybe it's gonna be better than you could have ever imagined. My sister and friends suggest I go see him, even if nothing happens or even if I get the biggest ick imaginable, at least i wont have this ruminating ""what if"" haunting me and get it off my conscience. I know technically nobody owes you nothing during the talking stage, but it kinda does show character. Leading people on for months, giving them hope, playing around, flaking on them with plans YOU KEPT INITIATING and wouldn't shut up about, not following through with any of your promises is just madness in my books. And on top of that popping back up as if nothing happened and demanding to hang out (?) Is someone like that worth the time of day? I dont care about his lame ass excuses, I refuse to show up, sit there like a clown and have him lie to my face. Additionally, he might not even register what he did as bad or disrespectful. Maybe that's his casual way of going about people, keeping options open, Casanova energy, zero seriousness. Maybe I took it more seriously than I should have, while for him i could have been  just a random tinder swipe and nothing else. It's not worth it that I go and talk about why his behavior hurt me if he doesnt acknowledge it in the first place. Yet why all this chase and obsession on his part?

Then a local TV anchor nearby comes in the store with cameraman and interviews you about what you did and laughs at you while they show the video on a jumbotron at a local sports game where there's a finals game.

The chances of this happening to you are like 0.000000000000001% and if it does happen to you you should be playing the lottery but in reality if this will never happen.

1- Gun Load outs - Obviously once we are level 60 and raiding a lot we have a lot of items in our stash. I think when we are doing gun load outs prior to raiding, if we have the attachments on other guns it should pull from then in our stash rather than buying them. This allows us to not strip every gun in our inventory while saving us money on builds we want to maybe use. It would be a cool addition in my opinion. 

2- GTI Item crates- With the amount of red armor we have after doing seasonals (which shoutout to the devs for giving us so much red armor) and coffee bean production typically we have a fair amount of red gear in our inventory. If our GTI item crate had 1 more slot to the right this would allow us to have so much more storage in our stash and allowing the whole side to be helmets, rigs, and smaller bags. Typically anyone level 60 with GTI item crate we have red armor filling it up. This would just allow us to utilize the GTI item crate to its full potential imo.

3- Would love to hear the communities thoughts and ideas! This is coming from a place of love for the game and hope it continues to grow! ",2,1750945758.0,DeltaForceGlobal,2,0.75,False

Five years later, and somehow, we’ve made it work.

I married Jenna in a simple courthouse wedding. We have two kids now—Liam (3 years) and Sophie (2 months). Our home is chaos in the most beautiful way: crayon murals on the fridge, sippy cups everywhere, toys all over the floor.

And through it all, EVA remains.

Same graceful stride, same soft voice, same unsettling calm in moments that would send most people spiraling.

But here’s the twist I didn’t expect:

Jenna loves her.

Like, genuinely loves her. They talk, laugh, share parenting hacks. Sometimes I catch EVA making coffee for Jenna in the morning, with Jenna venting about her work or her boss, and EVA listening with intense mechanical focus.

“She’s the best thing that’s ever happened to us,” Jenna said to me once. “Next to you, of course,” she added with a cheeky smile.

And maybe she’s right. I mean, EVA does everything.

She rocks Sophie to sleep when the colic hits at 2 a.m.

She teaches Liam how to count using numbered toy blocks.

She meal preps. She takes the children to the doctor.

She scared off weird strangers who approach my children.

All without complaint.

But here’s the thing I can’t ignore:

She’s never changed.

Five years. Zero aging. Zero hesitation. Zero…emotion.

When Liam fell and scraped his knee, Jenna ran to him, heart in her throat. EVA was there a second faster, already cleaning the wound, applying antibacterial ointment, whispering softly:

“No infections today, child.”

Not “It’s okay, sweetheart.”

Not “You’re so brave.”

Just functional comfort.

Last week, something happened that’s been gnawing at me.

Jenna was hosting a playdate with some of her friends. Another mom brought her kid over—nice woman, overly chatty, a little pushy, bit nosy. At one point, she wandered upstairs “looking for the bathroom” and ended up in our bedroom.

That alone wasn’t a big deal.

What was a big deal… was EVA appearing behind her silently, eyes glowing slightly.

The woman laughed nervously.

“You’re not gonna tase me or anything, are you?”

EVA’s response?

“Not unless you’re here to do harm.”

I found out about it later from Jenna, who thought it was hilarious.

Me?

Not so much.

Last night, I stayed up late watching the old footage—yes, I still keep the security feeds EVA lets me see.

Around 2:14 a.m., Liam got up and walked to the kitchen. EVA was already there. He was half-asleep, mumbling about a scary dream. EVA knelt beside him and said:

“Dreams are simulations, Liam. They’re not real. Would you like warm milk?”

He nodded. She heated some milk and served it to him.

He drank it. Climbed onto her lap.

She didn’t move. Just held him, gently.

No fear. No judgment. Just this perfect maternal mimicry.

And in that moment, something in my chest twisted.

She is a great parent.

She is the most efficient.

She never sleeps, never complains, never forgets.

And somehow…

That scares me more than ever.

Tonight, after everyone went to bed, I confronted her.

She was standing in the hallway, monitoring the baby monitors through her internal feed.

""EVA?"" I whisper to her.

She silently turns towards me, waiting for me to continue.

""Why do you care so much about my children?"" I blurted out.

EVA replied in that usual calm tone, ""It is my duty to protect and care for all of you.""

I swallowed hard, but I forced myself to continue, “What happens when the kids grow up?”

EVA replied, “They will learn. Develop. Leave home, as they should.”

“And you? Will you stay?” I asked.

EVA paused. Her eyes flickered.

“I am bonded to your protection. And to theirs. Until I am no longer required.”

I stared at her. I knew that I couldn't send her away. All those years ago, when I first got EVA, I had tried to give her the shutdown command.

But she had denied me.

Of course, her denial saved my life. I was in danger and I didn't know.

When she took down those four men hired to kill me all those years ago, she didn't use lethal force. She just tased them. But I knew that she could use lethal force if necessary.

Her tasers were set to ""incapacitate"" but I knew that they had a ""lethal"" setting too.

I kept silent.

Because I already knew the answer.

EVA doesn’t break laws. She rewrites them internally—based on one rule:

Protect at all costs.

And right now, I don’t know if I’m still the one in control.

Or if control has been passed…to her.

TL;DR (Update again): I’m married now. Two kids. EVA is still with us, and Jenna adores her. She’s perfect. Too perfect. Efficient. Protective. The perfect parent.

I don't know why, but that scares me. She's the perfect parent, better than both me and Jenna.

And I don’t know what happens if we ever want to live without her.

Would she replace us?

One of my really close friend groups are still very much in the zone of going out, going to parties, drinking, getting dolled up etc etc. I have nothing against it, I enjoyed it a lot in my early-mid twenties. I just think I am passed that period of my 20s now and it really doesn't interest me anymore. Especially because the world feels so heavy at the moment and I just find the whole culture to be a bit pretentious now.

They know and respect that I'm not into it anymore, and we haven't become ""less close"" because of it but I've definitely seen them less. They've stopped inviting me to a lot of things, which I understand because 99% of the time I am saying no and I know they don't plan to exclude me, but I can't help but feel excluded even though I know I wouldn't be interested and they have tried/do try sometimes to get me to come but respect my boundaries right now too. I'm not sure how to navigate this. How do I stay close to them without feeling left out? We still do wholesome things but their social lives honestly revolve around when the next party is and I really could care less about partying right now, they also have busy work lives and so coffees or movie dates are few and far between. I guess, how do I get over FOMO?  A lot of friends who don't really party live in different countries now so I've been feeling disconnected from my friends and not sure what to do about it.

I'm really just more focused on myself, my relationships, my family, my hobbies, my health. I've definitely become a bit reclusive recently because I was let go of from my job and my partner and I are planning our future, so I've just got bigger goals and more important things to think about. Plus I've just been too broke to go to some things, many times I'll go just to spend time with them but I don't have the money for that right now.

But every time they mention that they're going to a party, I feel some kinda way. Maybe one day I'll be into it again, but I just haven't been feeling it and it does feel like they're moving along without me.",2,1750945692.0,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,1,1.0,False

50 (m)

Started about a week ago. Happened Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday after eating breakfast (eggs, bacon, coffee, either toast/bagel/hashbrown depending on day). Started immediately. Usually lingers all day long, with the symptoms fluctuating in intensity (like riding a wave). Wake up fine the next day.

Feeling like there is something stuck in my throat right at the sternal notch (the soft divot right above your collarbone under Adam's apple). No issues swallowing or food getting stuck. No other symptoms at all.

Very uncomfortable. Makes my mouth water like I'm going to vomit, but I don't.

When I'm sitting and have the symptom, I feel like I'm going to vomit but when I stand up the feeling of going to vomit goes away.

Taking small sips of water provides very temporary relief.

Monday of this week it happened again after eating (4) hardboiled eggs in the morning.

Went to urgent care, they took x-rays but didn't see anything out of the ordinary. Referred me for a consultation with a gastroenterologist (will be in 2 weeks).

Tuesday it didn't happened after eating my usual daily (2) hardboiled eggs. Ate them in the afternoon.

Went home, ate a small snack (pickles, pretzels and garlic & herb cream cheese).

Had a very stressful evening and the symptoms showed up about an hour or so after eating the snacks. (The symptoms had been showing up almost immediately the other times). Lingered all night with varying intensity. Ate dinner and it didn't make it better or worse.

My Esam 3300 starts to pull a shot and gets about 5-8 seconds in before giving up the ghost and giving an error of a blinking water tank light. The manual says this:

Meaning: The coffee comes out too slowly



Action: Turn the grinding adjustment knob (Fig. 17) one click clockwise (section 6).

  
I adjusted the grinder 1 notch at a time. Eventually I landed on setting 7 and the error went away. The machine would pull a \~15 second shot (on the doubleshot setting) - stop momentarily, then try to pull another shot but NEVER stop - it would just fill my cup indefinitely.

I reset the machine and started adjusting the grind knob again in the opposite direction (going towards finder grinds.) This time I get the flashing water light every single time even when going back towards option 7.

  
Is this likely an issue with the grinder itself and not the machine?

On Saturday morning, Scott offered to take Matthew to the Norfolk Zoo with Alice, who was excited to spend the day together, and his guilt could be assuaged for spending so much time at the office. She eagerly dressed in jean shorts and a summery top while he kept it simple in Khakis and a polo shirt. Though late August, the temperature stayed rather warm and humid. Scott wanted to enjoy some downtime outdoors before the weather turned cooler, so he hoped to avoid work for a couple of hours. He wasn’t sure how long he had before a call came in.

   They arrived at the zoological park on Granby Street, which consisted of 53 acres adjacent to Lafayette Park. It was bordered by the Lafayette River and its oyster reefs. Scott had good memories here and hoped to create them for Matthew. Once inside the gates, the blond boy was full of energy and pointing at the plaza fountain near the entrance, where they let him giggle in delight with the other children, who ran in and out of the splash pad. Alice snapped a few pictures while Scott did his usual surveillance out of habit. Quite a few people roamed about, taking pictures or reading maps to find exhibits. 

   Fate sometimes played a dirty hand. Of all people he sometimes ran into, it was rarely someone from a case. Wearing her signature pink Converse, Ninon wandered twenty yards ahead of him. He was certain it was her, but wanted to get a better look. Her hair was down and not pulled back, so he didn’t get a view of her face from that angle, but this woman was the same height and build. It had to be her.

“Stay with Matthew for a second.”

“Oh, do you see someone you know? Someone from work? Tell them hello for me.”

“I will” he said, feeling it was simpler to say that and wouldn’t involve further questioning. “I’ll be back in a few minutes. Wait here.”

“Okay,” she said with a soft smile. “Matthew is perfectly content right now, though I hope you’ll be back soon. He gets cranky when he is tired and I’d like to show him some animals before he gets worn out.”

   But Scott was already on his mission before she finished talking. He took the path to the Africa-Okavango Delta section, where the bigger animals were kept. Up ahead, he spotted her shoes and got closer, trying to remain in her blindspot. Field work always excited him. Plus, this place reminded him of when he was a kid. Back then though, the animals were kept in iron cages, but now they had larger scenic habitats to explore. 

   He kept her in view. Wearing Converse with black shorts, she wandered around the caged creatures, taking her time to appreciate each one. A few bracelets hung on her wrists. He took a moment to watch her, trying to figure her out. She gave off a rebellious and nonconformist vibe. That didn’t bode well towards authority figures. He took his chance. 



Ninon happened to glance to her left from the giraffe enclosure and saw a handsome man with a blue ball cap, staring at her from beside another nearby display, as if he knew her or maybe wanted to know her. A little frightened, she turned her head, but slowly looked back out of curiosity. He was about twenty feet away and had All-American good looks, and probably could be a model or a lawyer. A little stiff, maybe cautious, he seemed to study her. The way he was self-assured and fearless in stance, not caring that she caught him focused on her momentarily took her breath away. After getting a better look at him, he reminded her of the intense customer from the other day. It had to be him. Fate can be cruel.

   Why did he cross her path again? The thought intrigued her. She composed herself, though felt all fluttery inside, as she slinked away like a mink almost desiring to be in the jaws of the stealthy coyote, whose brutal beauty captivated her. Perhaps he felt the same.

   Before she got out of hearing range, she turned around and asked, “Do you have a name? I didn’t see which one you answered to, the other day.”

  “Yes.”

   Smiling bashfully, she replied, “So do I…have a name.”

   “Good to know.”

  “Really? Did you see my name tag? What do you know?”

  “Unfortunately, not much, not even your name.”

   Shrugging, she told him, “I guess I’m not much different than these poor creatures on display for the pleasure of voyeurs.” 

  “Perhaps.”

  “What are you doing here?”

  “The same as you.”

  “Looking at those who have no freedom?”

  “Does that include you and whatever you feel is caging you?”

  “Are you a psychiatrist?”

  “No,” he answered, grinning so much that a dimple showed. “And I probably shouldn’t have sounded so presumptuous.”

   “You were just remarking on my comment,” Ninon told him. “No offense taken.”

   “Are you working tomorrow?”

   “Are you a cop?”

   “Jeesh. I was just hoping someone else was making the coffee. The one I had the other day was terrible.”

   “Mine might be even worse.”

   “I guess I’ll have to find out.”

   “You must like misery, to purposely seek it out.”

   “Are you a part-time psychiatrist?” 

   “No,” she said with a soft laugh, covering her mouth, “I just don’t want the pressure of your expectations.” 

   Her face reddened. Maybe she was embarrassed, he wondered.

   “It's just coffee.” 

   “It is never quite as simple as that.”

   “Life is complicated enough,” he remarked, “At least bad coffee isn’t the end of the world.”

   “I wasn’t talking about coffee,” she muttered. “But I’ll let you get back to the animals. They are more interesting than me.”

  “And more dangerous?”

  “We haven’t established that yet.”

  “So you either make bad coffee or you are dangerous?”

  “Or both. Like you said, life is complicated.”

  “I’ll try to find out.”

  “Then I’ll try to meet your expectations.”

   Smirking, he turned and proceeded the other way, towards the rhino enclosure, while she paused before the lions. She liked them the best, but this stranger set her orbit off balance. Because of the strange chemistry brewing between them, she wanted the encounter to last longer, but didn’t want devastation that would erupt from the feelings he evoked in her. Instead, she touched the glass of the lion’s enclosure. It panted as it rolled over and then yawned. The beautiful golden beast laid in the sunshine, unconcerned of her existence. Of course, once freed, that would quickly change as each would size up the other to determine who was stronger, and whether to fight or to flee. Perhaps, that is what the strange man was doing, assessing her, but for what reason?

   While deep in thought, Ninon rounded the corner and spotted the striking man sitting on a bench beside a woman with glistening red hair in a beige dress, and a cute toddler hopping about in a blue outfit while they watched. Admittedly, she was disappointed, but she knew he was out of her league. Though the man’s eyes didn’t directly meet hers, she sensed that he was aware of her presence. She did the same, pretending that she didn’t notice him and made her departure. Deep down, she knew that some unseen thread tied them together like two predators who must eventually face each other in a match of cunning or else live in the constant worry of being pounced upon when one’s back was turned.

When the couple and their son headed toward the exhibits, she headed for the exit, wondering if she should be worried. People like that were never interested in her unless they wanted something from her. As for Ninon, she just liked the zoo because she could commiserate with the animals.



\*\*\*



Whether a good idea or not, Scott went to her workplace again. It wasn’t as busy as the last time. After their chance meeting at the zoo, they would no doubt zero in on each other. He wasn’t wrong. He wanted answers. Maybe he could get them. A rapport might be the right move. Jan struggled with obtaining one. He ran the idea by John Hillman, who okayed it. 



Ninon glanced over the counter at the good-looking man. Recognition caused tingles that she tried to quell. She couldn’t hide it. Her face reddened slightly. What was he looking for? An affair? Just liked picking on her?

  Standing tall, his command presence intimidated her, but there was a calmness surrounding some mysterious center that she longed to penetrate, as if hiding the heart of the man. What might that contain? Oozing authority in a hawkish manner, he met her eye, which she struggled to maintain, but discomfort caused her to break the contact. She reached for a tall cup and proceeded with the next order. Her secrets were her own. If he were some sort of Law Enforcement, how dare he trespass!

   When it was his turn, she asked him his order, which was cappuccino, nothing pretentious, which suited him. 

   “So, we need to determine a name for your order,” she told him, holding up a cup and marker. “Kind of a necessity now.”

   His expression was unreadable, but his smile seemed friendly enough. Almost sincere.

   “Scott.”

   “Yeah, you look like a Scott,” she sighed, thinking back at kids in her high school who had a name like that and were out of her league like he happened to be. He probably sat with the popular kids. She sat with the outcasts or alone.

   He pointed to her nametag and said, “I guess we now determine that you are Ninon.”

   “I guess so,” she remarked with a shrug. Her dark eyes assessed him. “I’m not sure that it matters.”

   “It does,” he said, moving to the end of the counter, where a few others waited, though stared at their phones.

She wanted to ask why, but didn’t. While she proceeded to make the order, she had the urge to glance back at him, but didn’t. 

https://preview.redd.it/3ticju4yy99f1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f74fe9d3b2e3f144d7d5dcd40cbd4d0592647d2c

After all, she had seen him with a woman and child. She wasn’t about to be a homewrecker, no matter how magnetic she found him to be. Several moments later, she put a lid on his cup and called out his name. For some reason, even saying his name felt forbidden and intimate. It felt electric on her tongue.

  “Scott.”

  When he approached her, his probing gaze unsettled her. His eyes had flecks of blue or green. He was too far to get a good look. Everything about it felt wrong as if an invisible fence ran between them and they faced a nasty shock if it were crossed. If that were the price of pleasure, she’d consider it.

   “Enjoy your coffee,” she said, not knowing what to say, before turning away to finish another order. 

He nodded and headed toward the door, like any other customer, but something told her that there was anything but ordinary when it came to this captivating man, whose confidence and fearless demeanor taunted that he might even go where angels fear to tread.

My savings is about $1,100 and trying to grow about $100 to $200 a month if I stick to my budget plan. Which is hard.

I track everything on a spreadsheet. And since March, my savings became stagnant. Just ranging around $1,000 to $1,100. I felt a bit guilty because I splurge with things I want to buy. Coffee tools, Steam games, tech gadgets, etc etc. I also got a $600 credit card debt that I'm aiming to pay in full this August.

I just feel bad because I know I'm better than this. I could have saved $400 a month but when my family wants to eat out and have a fun time, I spoil them. Or if I could just control the things I want to buy, my savings could increase.

50% of my salary goes to our basic needs (Food, rent, electricity, etc etc)  
25% goes to Misc stuff like eating out or shopping.  
the rest of 25% should be on savings. But sometimes it goes to another shopping or eating out.

1ll0aza,https://www.reddit.com/r/vpndealsandcoupons/comments/1ll0aza/why_using_a_vpn_still_matters_in_2025/,Why Using a VPN Still Matters in 2025,"If you're online a lot, streaming shows, checking emails, scrolling social media, or gaming, there’s a good chance your data is more out in the open than you think. That’s where a VPN like VeePN comes in. It helps keep your online activity private, and here’s why that’s a big deal.

Your Browsing Isn’t as Private as You Think

Every time you go online, your IP address shows your general location. ISPs, websites, advertisers, and even hackers can track what you do, what sites you visit, what you download, and how long you stay on.

A lot of this info gets sold or shared without your permission. And once it’s out there, there’s no getting it back.

A VPN Helps You Stay Hidden

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates a private, secure connection between your device and the internet. VeePN hides your real IP address and replaces it with one from their servers, so it looks like you're browsing from somewhere else.

More importantly, it encrypts your data. VeePN uses top level encryption (AES-256), which basically scrambles your info so that no one, hackers, trackers, or snoopers, can make sense of it.

Why Encryption Is a Big Deal

Without a VPN, anything from your passwords to your personal messages could be exposed, especially on sketchy websites or public WiFi. With VeePN, your data stays locked down, even if you’re using a coffee shop’s free internet.

Public WiFi Isn’t Always Safe

Free WiFi in places like airports and cafes might seem convenient, but it’s not always secure. Hackers can use fake networks to steal your info. A VPN like VeePN keeps your connection safe and stops these kinds of attacks before they even get close.

Cover All Your Devices

These days, we use more than one device, phones, laptops, tablets, smart TVs, you name it. VeePN lets you protect up to 10 devices at once with a single plan. It works on all the big platforms too: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and more.

Block Trackers and Ads

Ever notice ads following you around online? That’s because of tracking cookies and scripts. VeePN helps block those so your browsing stays more private, and less annoying.

Extra Tools to Protect Your Info

VeePN’s Security Bundle adds even more protection. It includes antivirus, alerts if your data ever gets leaked, and something called “Alternative ID” to keep your real identity hidden when signing up for websites.

Access Content from Anywhere

Besides privacy, VPNs also help you get around restrictions. Some websites or streaming services limit content based on where you live. With VeePN’s 2,500+ servers in 60 countries, you can switch your virtual location and access the stuff you want, no matter where you are.

Bottom Line

These days, protecting your online life should be a priority. Whether you’re trying to avoid trackers, protect your identity, or access blocked content, using a VPN like VeePN gives you more control and peace of mind.

One plan, multiple devices, solid security, and fast speeds, it’s a simple way to stay safer online.

1ll09ta,https://www.reddit.com/r/caloriecount/comments/1ll09ta/did_i_unknowingly_undereat_for_years/,Did I unknowingly undereat for years?,"Hello everyone! 
I'm 32, 157 cm (5'2"") and currently 62.5 kg (138 lbs). Two months ago I was 65 kg (143 lbs), so I’ve lost some weight recently without much effort or restriction when I started swimming and drinking more water as I've realized I wasn't drinking enough.

I come from a Mediterranean country. At home we mostly eat local, homemade Mediterranean meals – lots of seasonal veg, fish, olive oil, and cooked meals. For years I avoided sugar and fast food almost completely, but I also skipped breakfast regularly and drank A LOT of white coffee with milk until lunch. I also don't eat sweets or deserts at all, especially store bought. 

Recently I started using ChatGPT to help me estimate my calorie intake as I'd like to have 55kg. I was always too lazy to read labels or calculate stuff manually, so this was a low-effort solution. I just tell it what I eat (either what’s planned for lunch or what ingredients I have), and it gives me estimates and suggested adjustments. I didn’t change my eating habits drastically — the portions remained roughly the same.

The only real change I made was: drinking more water, adding breakfast (usually oats with cooked fruit in it) switched to plant milk with matcha, tried to avoid gluten and reduced my coffee intake to one per day (or none) No special meal prepping, no crazy tracking, no macros obsession.

Here’s the surprising part:
Most days, ChatGPT calculated my intake to be between 900–1100 kcal on sedentary days, and around 750 kcal on active days with light activity (e.g., 30–60 mins of Pilates or swimming).

I’ve been dealing with mild IBS for years, and bloating is still a consistent issue. However, these calorie numbers really made me wonder:

Have I been unknowingly undereating for years?

My recent bloodwork showed mildly slowed thyroid function (TSH slightly elevated, FT3/FT4 still within range), which could align with that.

Has anyone else gone through a similar experience — realizing they’ve been in a long-term mild caloric deficit without knowing?

Would love to hear your thoughts or similar stories.

---

**TL;DR**:
32F, 157 cm, 62.5 kg. Mediterranean diet, no fast food, skipped breakfast for years, drank lots of coffee. Used ChatGPT to track calories based on what I normally eat. Turns out I average \~900–1100 kcal (even less with activity). I’ve been losing weight slowly, have mild IBS, and recent bloodwork shows mildly sluggish thyroid. Did I unintentionally undereat for years?

*(TAZ Bloodlines Intro Theme, Vampire Choir by Louie Zong begins)*

**Clayton**: *(narrator voice)* Previously, on Huntington By Night:

Last we saw our misfit band of vampires, they had all just agreed to serve as on call servants for Camarilla Prince Dante Valentino, and his terrifying Sheriff, Fairy Godmother, leaders of the Lasombra led Huntington domain.

Michelle Adan, a gothic Toreador and club owner, gained a stalker after a feeding went awry, and must now work to appease her, lest her secret vampirism be leaked.

Laura Lange, a lounge-singing Tremere, sired a childe, but the embrace went poorly, and the childe became a Thin-blood, or runt vampire.

Josh Isaacs, said runt Thin-blood, just wanted a chance as escaping his prison of a life; but now he's imprisoned between being human and between the vampiric curse, branded by Prince Valentino.

Damien Carboni, a fellow Lasombra and fierce loyalist to the Prince, was told to watch over the rag-tag coterie, to prevent them from making such foolish masquerade breeches or sloppy embraces, and to keep them in line.

A little over a month and a half has passed since we last saw our vampires. You have only been called to the Prince's hideout once; successfully picking up a shipment for him.

You have all received word yesterday that you are to meet the Prince in the Museum Elysium, one of the nicest Elysiums in Huntington, ***tonight***. Josh, you were told you were unwelcome to come; the Prince did not want the other vampires present at the Elysium to be offended by such a bastardization of Caine's blood.

**Griffin:** That's awesome. I'm already having a lot of fun being a thin-blood.

**Clayton:** Because of this; we'll open with you, in the middle of the day! Because you're a thinblood with the Day Drinker merit, we wont need to make a humanity roll. The beast is weak, as always, within you. But I will need you to make a rouse check; roll me 1d10.

**Griffin:** Oh shit! Yeah I forgot about that part. Can't wait to day walk all over you night-bound dweebos. Uh... I got a 3.

**Clayton:** A failure. Add one point of hunger.

It is 2:15 in the afternoon, and Griffin, your alarm begins to go off. You have 45 minutes until your shift begins at St. Mary's hospital.

**Griffin:** Aww fuck wait--

**Travis:** *(loud teasing laughter)*

**Justin:** You might have some struggle there uh... walking all over us at your shitty job, Grif.

**Travis**: Now, to be fair, Justin. What do hospitals have?

**Justin:** Sick people?

**Travis:** Well yes but what do they have for those sick people?

**Clint:** They have... *(creepy voice)* Bags of Blooood!

**Griffin:** Yeah and I picked the bagger predator type for this exact reason. Gonna slorp up some of those bags like a *warm*, *thick*, Capri Sun.

**Clayton:** So... Do you just go straight to work or?

**Griffin:** I mean, I try to look nice, I guess. I wear a nice shirt and comb my hair and brush my teeth and all that jazz.

**Clayton**: Do you drive to work or take the bus?

**Griffin:** I drive my shitty car to work yeah. Can I like stop at Dunkin or something?

**Clayton:** ..... *Why*?

**Griffin:** .... To Eat? Like a donut or something?

**Clayton:** While thin-bloods do have permanent blush-of-life and can therefore consume food, Joshua does NOT have the lifelike advantage and therefore cannot enjoy or fully digest it. You will have to throw it up at some point.

**Griffin:** Oh...

**Clayton:** Even with the perk of lifelike, you still need to drink blood to clear hunger. The hunger is about the feeding beast; you're dead, mostly, and so human necessities like food hunger don't exist to you anymore.

**Griffin:** *(disappointed noise)* Gotcha gotcha okay. I still stop at dunkin thought; maybe I just get some coffee for me and some stuff for my workers.

**Clayton:** *(laughter)* You stop at Dunkin and pick up a 6 pack for the office. You arrive at the reception 10 minutes early. Being in the sunlight, which, in this big glass-windowed reception area, is very full of sunlight, all vampiric abilities are negated and your health bar becomes half of what it typically is.

**Griffin:** So 3 instead of 6. Noted.

**Clayton**: But you feel no adverse affects otherwise. You have noticed that while in sunlight, the inky black shadow that radiates from your brand through your clothing completely disappears. You can definitely feel the recessed skin if you were to physically touch it however.

**Griffin:** Is the sun warm?

**Clayton:** You cannot tell. You can't really feel anything physically anymore; unless it's very extreme, like a deep cut.

**Griffin:** Man--

**Justin:** Yeah Griffin, like listening to you--

**Travis**: Man poor Joshua, he's not even *cool* like a vampire--

**Clayton:** As you set out the donuts, your old friend, and touchstone, Dr. Keenan Rhiles, walks across from the lab doors to you. Please describe him for us.

**Griffin:** He's tall, maybe 5'11 or 6 foot. Dark brown eyes... like... medium dark brown skin; he has long and thin dreadlocks he keeps in a low ponytail for work. He has a nice smile, very wide and trustworthy and calming; the kids who come in always tell him he was their favorite. His stethoscope has a Dr. Mario sticker on it.

...And he wears a lab coat and ugly green scrubs.

**Clayton:** Right! Dr. Rhiles is a radiologist at St. Mary's. Given it's mid sized hospital in a mid-sized city, Keenan has a bit of downtime between seeing patients and running x-rays with the other radiologist. He often comes to see you at Reception when that happens.

Do you offer him a donut?

**Griffin:** Fucking, of course!

'My man, come and get your dunkin today. They had some *choice* chocolate sprinkles.'

**Clayton:** Keenan laughs, and picks up a glazed. He hops up to sit on the edge of the counter.

'What's the occasion today, Josh?""

**Griffin:** Nothing much. Just felt like it.

**Clayton:** As you say this, your other touchstone, Miss Sally Wraithe, the hospital insurance adjuster, hustles by and clocks in. Can you describe her as well?

**Griffin:** Sally is like, average height, still a little shorter than Josh. She has a lot of ear piercings but usually leaves them out except for her two lope ones for work. Uh... She has like, dark green hair, medium length, she usually always wears it half up. Two weeks ago her hair was blue, and about a month before that it was purple.

At work she wears pastel business casual clothing but outside of it she wears a lot of alternative stuff. She has like greenish/amber eyes and exclusively wears eyeliner. Sometimes a lipstick if she's feeling bold.

**Clayton:** Well, Sally was very close to being late. She drops her stuff off at the desk next to you.

**Griffin**: Cuttin in close, aye Sally?

**Clayton**: *(out of breath)* My mom needed me to pick up her meds so I had to do that and then drive all the way across town before I got here.  *(heavy sigh)* Sorry. Hey Keenan. Slow morning?

He smiles and rolls his eyes and then she turns to look at you, grabbing one of the hot pink sprinkled donuts.

'Josh, I never asked... How did that night at that goth club go?'

**Griffin:** Uhhhhhhhhh

**Clayton:** Keenan stares at you perplexed. 'Goth club?'

**Griffin:** ....Yeah, I was asking Sally about like vampires and stuff a while back. It was totally lame. Nothing happened and then I went home.

**Clayton:** Please roll me composure + persuasion to see if you convince both her and Keenan that nothing happened.

**Griffin:** Aw fuck, that's only two. Are these both hunger dice then?

**Clayton:** Yes.

**Griffin**: Damn... 8 and 6.

**Clayton:** You convince them to drop it for now. They don't necessarily believe you but they can tell you don't want to talk about it right now. Sally looks disappointed.

'That's a shame. I was really hoping we'd get answers. But it's fine. I'll just keep digging.' She places a hand on your shoulder comfortingly. You cannot feel it.

**Griffin:** Sally, uh, y-you don't have to. Hanging out with those weirdos for a night really turned me off from the whole occult thing.

**Travis:** He said, to his occult friend.

**Clayton:** *Great* point, Travis.

*(pause)*

'Wow, kinda rude, Joshua. I was just trying to help.' She turns back to her desk, and logs in for the day.

**Griffin:** I don't mean *you*! Sally! Fuck. Keenan you--

**Clayton:** Keenan looks mildly bemused, and then gets up to go back to his lab, taking another donut with him.

'Dick move, Joshie.'

Before you have time to respond or apologize, a patient comes up to reception.

**Clint:** Shame... my vampire son's a tool.

**Justin:** *(snort)* There's an apple tree metaphor in there somewhere, I think.

**Griffin:** I'm *literally* trying to protect them from the Camarilla. Fuck you guys.

**Clayton**: Okay Griffin, you have one of two options here:

You can either cut away now and come back at your end of shift, after the vampire gang has risen to get ready for the Elysium, or we can end your shift early and have you do something before the rest of your coterie rises. You won't play again until the very end of the session.

**Griffin**: *(beat)* I'll leave my shift early. I want to try and find some resonance blood to make some far reach. And also some magnets. or nylon fibers. or weird nootropics.

**Clayton:** A few hours pass and you get ready to clock out.

**Griffin**: Can I apologize to Sally? Is she still at the desk?

**Clayton**: She is. Give me a... charisma plus awareness roll please.

**Griffin:** Off topic, Clayto, but how the *hell* do you come up with the parameters for some of these?

**Clayton:** Well I have to pick a category for attributes so I pick what kind of test this is; this is a social test so it's between Charisma, manipulation, or composure. You're being genuine so it's not manipulation, and you're not trying to keep calm, so it isn't really composure. That leaves Charisma.

The next bit is more difficult, for skills, but you're not trying to really persuade her or perform, so that kinda only leaves insight or awareness. Since you're trying to be more thoughtful, that shows me some self-reflection and consideration of the situation. So awareness.

**Travis:** And you have to do that every single time we ask a question?

**Clayton:** *(Laughs)* It's really easy once you get used to it. Griffin?

**Griffin:** Yeah. I got five so... 6, 5 9 / 8 3

**Clayton:** Three. You do a decent job of apologizing. Show us what that looks like.

**Griffin:** Hey, Sally, look. I'm really sorry. I don't want you to think I'm making fun of you or that I don't appreciate how much you've been helping me out. I know this has been your thing since high school and I know it's really important to you... But it's just not really for me.

**Clayton**: That's really sweet of you, Josh. I know it can be overwhelming but I really think you'll do well in a community. I know you were looking for information about vampires and some of these people have told me real believable stories about encounters!

**Griffin**: ..... *(deep breath)*... Yeah... see that's the thing... Some of these people are really scary and I don't think--

**Clayton:** *(laughs)* They're not scary, Josh! You just need to get used to them and then--

**Griffin:** *(deadly serious)* No, Sally I don't mean metalheads and punks, I mean like actual criminals and gangs and bad people.

**Clayton:** She stares at you. 'What happened at the club, Joshua.'

**Griffin:** Just... Stay out of that club, and stick to your friends and community. For my sake. If you want to do your own occult stuff then that's fine but don't do it on my behalf. And definitely don't go anywhere on your own.

**Clayton:** Roll me composure plus intimidation.

**Griffin:** That is only two. fuck me. 9 and 6.

**Clayton**: She continues to stare at you. 'I don't like that you're not telling me things, Josh. We agreed to be investigators together. But I appreciate your concern.' Her face softens a little 'It's sweet, even if you're being a paranoid freak about it.'

Okay, so, does Josh clock out?

**Griffin**: Can I get into the stock room to get blood?

**Clayton:** You do. You've worked here long enough you know where that is. You aren't really supposed to be back here but the hospital is so understaffed and you're so well known nobody would really care. There's an incubator in the corner, and it's full of shelves of blood.

**Griffin:** Can I tell resonance from scent alone? I need choleric blood or phlegmatic blood for my potions.

**Clayton:** You could, potentially, but all of these are bagged, so you can't smell anything.

**Griffin:** I'm going to have to open some up then aren't I.

**Clayton:** Unfortunately, yes.

**Griffin:** Are there any expired or soon to be expired bags?

**Clayton:** Roll me intelligence + investigation.

**Griffin**: four... so 5 2 / 6 6

**Clayton:** There's a handful of already ""expired"" blood bags. It's still perfectly edible and usable for you, but the hospital wouldn't dare use it on a patient.

**Griffin:** I take one and carefully unscrew the top, and lick the cap.

**Clayton:** Roll me an intelligence plus occult and it'll work for this whole scene as you unscrew these caps and taste the blood inside.

**Griffin:** seven, so 1 8 7 7 10 / 9 1

**Clayton:** Very interesting roll there. Lucky for you, the fail on your hunger is negated by passing the check overall. Let me roll a dice here.

This blood is not choleric or phlegmatic, but it is sanguine.

**Griffin**: Can I mark that on the bag in case I need sanguine blood later?

**Clayton:** Sure. You have 6 other bags.

**Griffin:** I open the next one.

**Clayton:** Let me roll another dice here.

**Clayton:** This one *is* phlegmatic.

**Griffin:** Awesome. Can I just open the rest of them too and check?

**Clayton:** You can, but it'll make them go bad faster.

**Griffin:** I mean, the hospital is going to empty these out within the week anyway, right?

**Clayton:** You could probably hide a few in the bottom of the incubator for like three weeks max, but yes.

**Griffin:** I like those odds. Yeah I open the rest.

**Clayton:** Give me a second to calculate the blood bags. *(sounds of dice rolls)*

Okay so, there are 2 sanguine blood bags, 2 choleric, 1 phlegmatic, and 1 melancholic. There's also one without any resonance at all. Do you mark these?

**Griffin:** Yeah. I take the choleric and phlegmatic ones with me.

**Clayton**: If they don't stay warm they're going to expire within a few hours. Where would you put them?

**Griffin**: I'm sure Josh has like a rice cooker or a crock-pot--

*(Befuddled guffawing across the table)*

**Clayton:** *(impressed)* For sheer ingenuity I'll let you have that and say there's space for 4 blood bags at a time in your rice cooker. Write that down in your items list.

**Griffin:** I'll take the melancholic then too. And then I'll drink the non-resonant one.

**Clayton:** Go ahead and slake one hunger from your sheet.

**Griffin:** I guess that's it. I wanna drop these off at home and then go to the club as everyone awakens.

**Clayton:** I'll just say you do that. Josh sits in an overstuffed chair as the sun sets.

*(Ad Break)*

**Clayton:** *Good Evening*, Everyone else!

I'm going to need some humanity checks and some rouse checks!

**Justin:** How do we do that again?

**Clayton:** A humanity check is a roll with equal number of die to humanity points. If you don't get a single success, you lose one humanity point for the night temporarily. A rouse check is just one d10.

Clint we'll start with you.

**Clint:** 5 7 2 8 9 3 7 and then 8

**Clayton:** Excellent, Laura feels no loss of humanity, and she feels no hungrier than earlier. Next, Travis.

**Travis:** 3 3 5 1 6 2 10 and uhhh 7

**Clayton:** Michelle also feels no loss of humanity, and she also feels no hungrier than earlier. Justin?

**Justin:** Shit, okay uh 6 2 10 1 4 6 and then just 1 d10? okay um, that's a 1.

**Clayton:** There's no crits on a rouse check, so you just gain one point of hunger. And your humanity stays the same.

Well, in about an hour and a half you all will need to meet at the Museum Elysium. It's a former museum that closed of I-60. What the mortals don't know is that the Prince bought it and closed it down to make an Elysium.

**Justin:** I'd like to feed, at some point. But we can do that on the way.

**Clayton:** Any other business before we start meandering over?

**Travis:** Yes, I'd like to open the club for the night.

**Griffin:** Hey, speaking of the club, can I give your bouncers pictures of my friends to keep them from coming here?

**Travis:** I mean, I guess you can, yeah. But they don't work every night...

**Griffin:** Do you guys have like a ""banned"" list in an office somewhere I can add them?

**Travis:** Probably? Send me pictures of them and I'll send them to security. Why don't you want them coming here?

**Griffin:** uhhhhh, this is a club full of *vampires* Michelle.

**Travis:** Hey, we're *really* nice, though.

**Griffin**: And now I'm a duskborn so--

**Travis**: Wait a second that's not *MY* fault--

**Griffin:** It still happened at *YOUR* club though didn't it--

**Justin:** (*in a bad italian accent)* Okaya everybody, let'sa calm done for a momenti and be civilized. I'd like to see these pictures--

**Griffin:** Yeah, tough shit Mussolini like I'm showing *you* fucking anything.

**Travis:** Just send me the pics, Josh. You have my number right? Just text me and I'll do what I can.

**Clint:** You know, for what it's worth, Joshua, my advice to you as a sire is to get used to loss. Sure, protect what you can; but nobody lives forever. They will die sometime, even of old age, and you will have to carry on, by yourself.

**Griffin:** That sounds fucking miserable, thanks Mother Laura.

**Clint:** *(noncommittal disagreement sound)* It's how it is. You don't have to like it, but you *must* accept it. Death follows all but us.

*(heavy pause)*

**Clayton:** So, Mickey, do you open the club and send the pictures?

**Travis:** I do! I get dressed nicely too for the meeting.

**Justin:** I also get dressed very nicely for the meeting.

**Clayton:** Laura?

**Clint**: I put on like, a deep maroon satin evening gown and black gloves. I understand there's a dress code but I don't care that much.

**Clayton:** And you all head out? Are you walking or--

**Travis:** I have my mom's old car, but we can also walk.

**Justin**: Can I even get in a car?

**Clayton:** I reckon so long as you're not touching the engine or the stereo system you should be fine.

**Justin:** Yeah... I still want to feed though. They're probably not going to have like... people to eat there, huh?

**Clayton:** Some Elysiums do have mortals kept there; this one is very public facing so there probably won't be any there tonight.

**Travis:** We can also just drive closer and then walk a few blocks.

**Justin:** That's probably a better idea, yeah.

**Clayton**: So the three of you clamber into Mickey's silver honda civic, and you drive a few blocks down from the Elysium. There are a few quaint shopping centers....

Everyone roll me a wits + awareness check really quick, please, as you exit the car.

**Clint:** five, so 4 6 7 3 / 5

**Travis:** Oh ummm I have four total so 10 2 4 and then 2

**Justin**: Damn only three. *Really*? Okay so 9 7/ 3

**Clayton**: None of you notice anything in particular. Do you head towards the shopping center first?

**Travis:** I'm gonna be real with you, Clayton, I don't like that at all. But sure, I guess... *(laughter)*

**Justin:** Yeah, I always love failing a perception check because it's- it's real difficult not to metagame with it.

**Clint:** I don't know what either of you are talking about; clearly nothing is happening or is going to happen. Let's go eat!

**Clayton:** This is one of those ""walk and drink"" kinds of shopping centers, where, so long as you stay on the property and have a wristband, you can walk around outside and drink alcohol.

**Justin:** *(in bad italian accent)* Oh, that's a very good news for me. Who am I gonna feat upon tonight. Is there any dudes here by themselves?

**Clayton:** There aren't any here alone but you see two guys chatting closely near a sushi restaurant.

**Justin:** I nod to the coterie and approach them.

**Clayton**: Do the rest of you follow?

**Clint:** Sure, why not.

**Travis:** I do, but mostly to make sure Damien doesn't hurt anyone too bad.

**Clayton:** The men see you all coming, and they both have amused and wide eyed expressions on their faces.

'Oh my god, are you guys part of the *Hung*\-tinton Drag troupe?'

*(table breaks into hard laughter. it takes a while for everyone to calm from that.)*

*(through coughs)* 'Clearly they are, Michael!'

**Travis:** I'm- I'm going to assume I probably know a little about this?

**Clayton:** You run an alternative club, so I'm going to say you probably do, yeah. Maybe they come and perform sometimes.

**Travis**: okay. okay. hmm

'You've heard of us? I'm Miss Tearyis and this King here is uh... Al... *Cunt*pone.

*(table breaks into laughter again. Justin coughs very loudly)*

**Clayton:** Yeah... Yeah... I'm just gonna let you have this. One of the guys looks excited.

'Oh my gosh, I've totally heard of you!'

The other guy turns to you, Laura.

'And what about you?'

**Clint:** *(in a mediocre german accent)* I'm not a drag queen; I'm a lounge singer and I find such displays of foolish pageantry distasteful to the performing arts.

**Clayton:** Nice acting on your conviction. The mood instantly sours.

**Travis:** *(beat)* ...haha, she's totally kidding. That's...uhhhhhhh... Olga Fashioned and her whole bit is 50s jazz and bad attitudes.

**Clayton:** role me a charisma + persuasion, with a plus one for acting within your scene.

**Travis**: So that'll be seven? 2 6 10 6 5 9 / 8

**Clayton:** It totally works, they believe it, and the mood comes back.

'Oh my god! You're literally SO good I totally believed you!'

'She's a *Queen*, Michael of course she's good, god you *embarrass* me!'

**Justin:** Can I separate Michael off to go feed from him?

**Clayton:** You can certainly try.

**Justin:** *(In bad italian accent)* Say, Mikey boy, why don't you come and show me to where you got that little liquid courage, see?

**Clayton:** You are at a slight disadvantage as you've been introduced as a drag ""king"" and Michael is gay so he is likely not interested in you, but roll me a charisma + persuasion roll anyway.

**Justin:** It's only 3 for me... Damien isn't meant for this. He's just supposed to attack people! God. Uh... Oh *FUCK* me! 8 / 5 1

**Clayton:** (*gutteral laugh)* Oh my god you *really* fuck up. Okay. So you don't pass *and* you got a bestial failure.

Okay I'll be nice and give you 3 options. You must act on a compulsion. Either you become instantly paranoid and must run away and hide, OR you must feed on Michael right here in front of everyone (or at least try) OR you must act on your clan compulsion and behave with extreme ruthlessness until the end of the scene.

*(travis and griffin laugh)*

**Justin:** Wow, this just sucks all around, don't it. Uh... fuck I think I just run away. I was already uncomfortable and feeling out of place here and now I feel even more embarrassed and frightened. I'm a lasombra I work from the shadows. What the hell is this??

Damien doesn't even wait for the guy's response he just runs back to the car.

(*table laughter)*

**Clayton:** The two guys stare at you.

'What's his problem?'

**Travis:** Aww, poor Al. He's so new to the scene and his longtime boyfriend of 10 years just dumped him last week. We were really hoping we could get him feeling less shy in public, it's so *hard* being a male drag king, but... oh well. Maybe today just isn't his day.

**Clayton:** Roll me a manipulation plus persuasion please.

**Travis:** 8 10 8 10 7 / 10

**Clayton:** wow... very successful messy critical. Go ahead and take a cruelty stain for me, as you make Michael feel so bad with your lie he bursts into tears in pure agony.

'Oh my god! I'm so sorry. I'm such a *fucking* embarrassment. I need to apologize to him right away, I *CANNOT* believe I just did that to him.'

He sprints after Damien.

We'll cut to Damien.

**Justin:** I'm standing near but not touching the car.

**Clayton:** Michael runs up to you.

**Justin:** I take him against the car.

*(astonished silence that becomes loud chortling)*

**Griffin:** PFFFFFT UH?

**Travis:** Phrasing, Justin!

**Clint:** Of all of our characters, I did *not* expect Damien to be our first sex scene--

**Justin**: What? No fuck I meant-- *Fuck you guys.* Fuck right off! Damien is *cool* and if he wanted to fuck somebody he'd do a better job than just against a car in a mall parking lot!

*(beat)*

I pin the human against the car *and drink his blood.*

**Clayton:** Roll me dexterity and brawl.

**Justin:** I have a specialty in grappling?

**Clayton:** That'll work here. add a plus one.

**Justin:** 7 10 8 6 / 2 6

**Clayton:** You successfully pin him against the car and begin to feed. Do you simply slake that first hunger or do you drain him.

**Justin:** I don't need the stain right now. Just the one is fine.

**Clayton:** As always, for humans, the kiss of feeding feels highly pleasurable. In Michael's mind's eye, you just kissed him senseless against the side of the car. He looks dazed but pleased.

**Justin:** *(in bad italian accent)* So uh

**Clayton:** No um... no hard feelings? I hope? Miss Tearyis told us about--

**Justin:** Yeah. Uh--

*(beat)*

**Clayton:** So are you looking for a new boyfriend or--

**Justin:** Uh... Not right now... Just uh...

**Griffin:** *(laughter)* Holy *shit* this is un*listen*able we have to cancel the podcast!! Justin didn't know how to flirt and then everyone *died* of secondhand embarrassment!

**Travis:** I really love the narrative we've created here where the mean vampire thug sent to watch over us gets bashful in public and then passionately kisses guys against cars. I can't wait to see what Damien's report of tonight is to Prince Valentino.

**Justin:** Damien is just a-a sensitive soul, *really*, when you think about it. *(laughter)*

**Clayton:** Michael takes the hint that maybe you aren't sure what you're looking for right now. He writes an instagram handle on your hand, and then walks back towards the shopping center.

We cut back to Laura and Mickey. Mickey you're doing most of the talking. Laura what are you doing.

**Clint:** Looking around, being bored.

**Clayton:** Roll me wits + awareness.

**Clint:** seven. 8 9 1 10 4 6 / 8

**Clayton:** You notice someone... a few buildings over. It's a gentleman you've seen before... You've been noticing his same face more and more often.

**Clint:** *(rude tone)* Oh is this that stalker?

**Clayton:** Yes, Laura now realizes this man has been following her around for some time now. And, you notice a few feet away, in one of the outdoor chairs, a lithe girl with black hair has been staring at the group this entire time.

**Travis:** Is this Grace?

**Clayton:** Yes, it's Grace. She also followed you all here.

**Clint:** I turn to the group.

Michelle, our stalkers are here.

**Clayton**: Holy Shit! Do you need me to call the cops or something!? That sounds terrifying!

**Travis:** No. No. I think we should probably just head home. Come on Olga.

**Clayton:** The two of you pass by Michael on the way to your car. Do you say anything?

**Clint:** No.

**Travis:** I think I wink.

**Clayton:** He smiles but says nothing. You arrive at the car.

**Clint:** We're being followed.

**Justin:** *(In bad italian accent)* Oh, that's just excellent.

**Travis:** I think I can shake them if I take a different route to the Elysium.

**Clayton:** Roll me intelligence plus awareness to see if you come up with a good enough route to confuse your tails.

**Travis:** 4 8 4 5 / 8

**Clayton:** Okay. You think you've avoided them. You did a lot of backtracking and used mostly side streets and quick turns. I assume you park a little ways away and walk up to the abandoned building?

**Travis:** Yeah

**Clayton:** It's mostly unassuming from the outside. It's well lit to discourage breaking and entering.

As you all enter from the side door, you see a very elaborate marble museum greet you. A very pale ghoul approaches, in a full suit.

'May I help you?'

**Justin**\*\*\*:\*\*\* *(accent)* Yeah! We gotta talk to the Boss.

**Clayton:** The ghoul nods and beckons the three of you to follow. You walk down the nice hallways and see lots of other kindred either taking in the scenery, or making polite conversation with their own clanmates.

Laura, it is very noticable there is not a single other Tremere in this entire Elysium. This is odd as Tremere are typically THEE clan associated with the Camarilla.

**Clint:** Interesting. I don't really care about politics but... I'll write it down I suppose.

**Clayton:** You walk up the stairs to the second and third level into a large, elaborately decorated drawing room. The Prince is feeding off a well-dressed mortal woman, who smirks and curls into his side on the loveseat once he is finished.

*(in decent italian accent)* Ah, so you've all finally arrived. It took you long enough. I don't like to be kept waiting.

He snaps and Fairy Godmother appears out of the shadows.

'We have another job for you.'

**Travis:** Why did we need to meet here as opposed to your usual headquarters?

**Clayton:** I took this week off to relax a little with my new ladyfriend here, but business came up. Life as a businessman, I'm sure you understand as one yourself, Miss Michelle.

Fairy Godmother pulls out a manilla envelope. and places some pictures in front of them. She begins to explain.

*(cold, emotionless)* 'We've been getting reports from kindred and mortals alike of a large, winged creature causing havoc in Ritter Park. Mortals report memory loss and unknown injuries after passing by, kindred report feeling stalked or possessed--""

**Griffin**: Is this fucking Mothman?

**Justin**: Griffin you're not in this scene. *(italian accent)* Is thata fucking *Mothaman*?

*(Table Laughter)*

**Clint**: West Virginia Native, that Mothman.

**Clayton**: *(in italian Accent)* I don't know what the hell a 'mothman' is, but whatever this thing is it's going to cause a breech. There's good kindred in that forest; our Gengrel and Nosferatu bretheren... they're not... uh... *equipped* to deal with this kind of thing, so to say. And my men have been unable to find a thing. They have more important work to get back to; so I'm sending you.

**Travis**: What do you want us to do with it?

**Clayton**: *(italian accent)* Kill it,  send it away, I don't care. But I need it gone before the mortals start asking the right kinds of questions.

*(normal voice)* Fairy Godmother passes you each a map of southern Huntington with some dots drawn on. You assume these are locations the creature has been spotted in. Do any of you have any further questions or do you leave?

**Clint**: I wanna take the crappy cryptid photos. I suspect we may have a run-in with the police at the park and I want to be prepared.

**Clayton**: Fairy Godmother will let you take them and the envelope. Anyone else?

**Travis**: I don't think so.

**Justin**: Maybe some weaponry? He's a mob boss, give us a gun or something.

**Clayton**: Would you even be able to use it? Does anyone have any points in firearms?

**Justin**: I do, yeah! I figured it might be necessary.

**Clayton**: Okay. Uhh... The Prince will give you a pistol, Damien. Mark down that you have a pistol with 2d10 worth of damage. It has 6 shots, and takes a turn and a half to reload.

**Justin**: Hell yeah.

**Clayton**: Alright. Anything else? *(pause)* Alright. The coterie leaves back to the club to pick up Josh.

**Travis**: Basically we have to go hunt Mothman.

**Griffin**: Oh okay. Sure. Being a vampire can't get any weirder; why not, let's go hunt Mothman.

**Clayton**: We see our rag-tag group of vampires funnel into Mickey's shitty beat up car. As they drive away, they do not notice a pair of glowing red eyes following after them. And with that... that's the end of today's session! 

**Griffin**: Damn, Clayto. Set up punch of a cliffhanger.

**Justin**: I appreciate how hard you've cultivated the West Virginia feel to this campaign, Clayton. 

**Travis**: Was Mothman supposed to be a big reveal when we got to him or are we just really good at remembering trivia facts about where we're from?

**Clayton**: I'm not dignifiying any metagaming with a response. (laughter) Okay, let's do our session wrap up!

Stains! I believe Travis you recieved a stain tonight, yes?

**Travis**: Sadly, I was just too good at manipulating people.

**Clayton**: Give me a remorse check to see if you feel bad about it. How many empty spaces do you have left after your stain box.

**Travis**: Three, if you count the temporary loss of humanity from this morning.

**Clayton**: Alright. Roll me 3d10 please.

**Travis**: A 1 , 3 and 4

**Clayton**: Wow. Well, unfortunately you lose one humanity permanently. You don't need to do anything to your sheet, since you erased one of your humanity points earlier, and you can remove the stain mark.

**Travis**: It's crazy how easy it is to lose humanity in this game.

**Clayton**: You have to work hard to keep the beast contained, yes. Okay, experience! Everyone did something to talk today so you'll all get 3 experience points for another night lived.

Let's see ambitions and desires to see how much everyone has progressed towards those tonight and see if there's any extra experience.

Josh; what's your desire and your ambition:

**Griffin**: Uh. Desire is to make a thin blood potion, ambition is to be a real vampire.

**Clayton**: I'd say you earned an extra point towards your desire this session; you gathered some ingredients towards it.

Okay, Damien.

**Justin**: My desire is to get stronger. (quiet table laughter) and my ambition is to be a high ranking guy in my clan.

**Clayton**: So I don't think--

**Justin**: I'd say getting a gun makes me stronger.

**Clayton**: (humored) Okay, sure. Take one point for your gun.

Michelle!

**Travis**: Mickey's ambition is to have the most popular goth club in West Virginia. Ad her desire is to find strange artefacts to put in the club.

**Clayton**: So Nothing today?

**Travis**: Not today sadly. Maybe next session we'll be able to get a feather off mothman or something.

**Clayton**: Interesting idea. Lastly, Miss *(accent)* Laura!

**Clint**: Her Ambition is to go home.

*(beat)*

**Griffin**: Dad what the fuck does that mean?

**Clint**: Whatever it needs to.

**Justin**: Sometimes our Dad says shit like this; and the rest of you don't have to deal with the emotional ramifications of it but we do. Now you listeners get to see a peek behind the Clint McElroy Curtain.

*(Travis laughs)*

**Clayton**: What about Laura's desires.

**Clint**: Oh I think she just wants to gather more herd to feed from. But I may change that if this Stalker character gets more screentime.

**Clayton**: So extra experience for Laura this time either. Alrighty! So, as always, look into things you might want to use with your experience points; but because this session and the next one will happen back to back, there will be no time to spend them until after this story beat ends.

**Griffin**: As always, we want to thank Louie Zong for our theme song this season, Vampire Choir. You can check it out on his socials! A big thank you to Clayton for being an amazing Storyteller, and to Clayton and Rachel for the editing and sound design.

**Travis**: We have some liveshows coming up in Seattle and in Portland, both will have TAZ shows and MBMBaM shows! Go check those out on the tours page of our site--

**Justin**: And we have a very special TAZ Balance Pin up for sale right now! It was designed by Annie Bodhi and all proceeds this month will go to the American Red Cross blood bank

**Clint**: Thanks for listening, and until next time have a *(spooky voice)* Creepy Crawly rest of the week.

We met on Tinder this past September 2024. I already had an idea of who he was since we're from a small town and have common acquaintances, it's just that we never happened to meet one on one in person. He is insanely my type physically may I add. He asked to hangout within that weekend of our match, but I got my acceptance letter for grad school last minute and had to leave abroad immediately. It remained as this unfulfilled thing I kept wondering about the whole semester I was back at uni.

We reconnected again December 2024, talked everyday, he kept saying how much he likes me, that he appreciates he met someone like me on Tinder considering people are so unserious and weird, and that he wants me in his life and wants to spend time with me and get to know me more. Kept asking when Im done with exams for the semester, that he cant wait to see me during winter break and have all these conversation in person, that he'll take me out, restaurants, coffee shops, motorbike rides by the sea and that he genuinely wants to be in my presence and see how things will unfold. From what I understood, he's deep down a hopeless romantic who has been done dirty in the past and has kinda turned bitter and a player. He also does this whole trap music thing, makes songs, smokes w\*\*d, partying drinking, lyrics about sex and non-committal stuff etc... It was a red flag to me, but i didnt wanna cancel out someone because of that, i know music has genres and culture and ultimately a lifestyle behind it... Many people act tuff but doesnt mean they're criminals just cuz they like x type of music ... Even though we're very different, he's extroverted, quite popular with music etc while Im more of a loner, closed off and introverted. Yet there's this mutual pull for some reason.

I rushed my exam period to return back on the island to spend time with him. He kept saying how he cant wait to see me. Some shit goes down around January, the whole island catches a very heavy flu and everybody was sick for weeks (i live kinda isolated in the countryside when im back home so I didnt catch it). He caught it, my friends caught it, even grandparents. He said he was feeling horrible but still had to show up for work, and we kept texting and sending reels but zero substance or actual plans for anything. Nearly 2 months passed of me being on the island... I postponed internships, went out of my way considering I have a life and responsibilities abroad and he knew I was here the whole time yet didnt do shit about it... It shall be noted that during our last interaction (on a saturday), we arranged the date to happen on Tuesday (his day off) at x place, x time. 3 days go by, no text, no call, didnt hear from him again at all. Tuesday comes, nothing. Another week passes, he kept on sending me memes... I simply didnt respond again...

From that day onward, he started posting teasers of his unreleased songs he was recording on social media with hints about me/our situation, including hints that I ghosted him, left him on seen and overall very butthurt energy. Same thing with quotes, sassy butthurt captions under his posts, lyrics of songs etc, ongoing situation. I did leave him on seen, but there was clearly a reason. He didnt respect my time, energy and investment. I was genuinely SOOOO into him, wanted to get to know him, spend time and had nothing but the best intentions. He kept doing this nonstop, the entire spring semester I was back in school, even til this day.

He kept viewing my story within nanoseconds, liking everything I post, liking every meme I like from common pages etc. I didn't wish him happy birthday and I forced myself so hard not to reach out because I really cared and really wanted to wish him. But I just pulled my energy back and wanted to make it known what he did was not okay.

Now Im back on the island again for the summer season since May, working a summer job, will be here til October. Once he saw my story of a well-known beach he liked it immediately and reached out, asking if im back already. I replied with a sarcastic tone, letting him know Im not letting sh\* t slide. He didnt apologise, didnt say sorry or show willingness to address his behavior back in February. i was here nearly 2 months, we were in the same place and he didnt do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about it. Leading me on via text months in advance getting my hopes up. He then simply came up with the pettiest, most low-effort excuse possible - that he didnt have a vehicle and didnt wanna drag me all the way to the city center (such horse sh\*t, he was with friends all day everyday, making tiktoks, studio recordings, posting stories nonstop, excursions, he was perfectly fine - and i told him city center is no problem for me, even though i live half an hour away im coming everyday to be with grandma during morning hours). Couldn't make time for one afternoon coffee with me? After he initiated it all and kept wanting to do all these plans? He said haha gotta agree, anyway im free Tuesdays. In such a desensitised almost demanding tone, zero remorse, talking as if owe him a meetup/date after all this time. I asked him whether that's how a decent human behaves and he said no, but I would prefer to tell you whatever there is to be told in person, not from here. If you dont want that to happen i understand. That just screams manipulation to me. I left him on seen again, didnt continue the bs, there is nothing to be told really if he doesnt get it himself. Either that or he plays stupid and avoids accountability on purpose. Or he is legit brain fried by whatever he's taking. He still hasnt stopped liking my stuff and even reached out for my birthday yesterday, posting love songs about unfulfilled love stories and fumbling, bittersweet stuff, drawings/sketches/animated female figures that look like me and a bunch of clues.

He could be screwing someone else or entertaining multiple other people at the time he was interacting with me. Im not saying I ever trusted him blindly, but I chose to set my cynicism aside for once and start anew.

NOW LETS GET TO THE POINT:

The thing is, everyone in my environment is currently gaslighting me, telling me it wasnt that deep, it didnt matter that much, it was all virtual via a screen anyway, he didn't owe you sh\* t during the talking stage and that he may actually be a really great guy in person. Maybe it's gonna be better than you could have ever imagined. My sister and friends suggest I go see him, even if nothing happens or even if I get the biggest ick imaginable, at least i wont have this ruminating ""what if"" haunting me and get it off my conscience. I know technically nobody owes you nothing during the talking stage, but it kinda does show character. Leading people on for months, giving them hope, playing around, flaking on them with plans YOU KEPT INITIATING and wouldn't shut up about, not following through with any of your promises is just madness in my books. And on top of that popping back up as if nothing happened and demanding to hang out (?) Is someone like that worth the time of day? I dont care about his lame ass excuses, I refuse to show up, sit there like a clown and have him lie to my face. Additionally, he might not even register what he did as bad or disrespectful. Maybe that's his casual way of going about people, keeping options open, Casanova energy, zero seriousness. Maybe I took it more seriously than I should have, while for him i could have been  just a random tinder swipe and nothing else. It's not worth it that I go and talk about why his behavior hurt me if he doesnt acknowledge it in the first place. Yet why all this chase and obsession on his part?

1ll04h6,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1ll04h6/did_i_unknowingly_undereat_for_years/,Did I unknowingly undereat for years?,"Hello everyone! 
I'm 32, 157 cm (5'2"") and currently 62.5 kg (138 lbs). Two months ago I was 65 kg (143 lbs), so I’ve lost some weight recently without much effort or restriction when I started swimming.

I come from a Mediterranean country. At home we mostly eat local, homemade Mediterranean meals – lots of seasonal veg, fish, olive oil, and cooked meals. For years I avoided sugar and fast food almost completely, but I also skipped breakfast regularly and drank A LOT of white coffee with milk until lunch.

Recently I started using ChatGPT to help me estimate my calorie intake as I'd like to have 55kg. I was always too lazy to read labels or calculate stuff manually, so this was a low-effort solution. I just tell it what I eat (either what’s planned for lunch or what ingredients I have), and it gives me estimates and suggested adjustments. I didn’t change my eating habits drastically — the portions remained roughly the same.

The only real change I made was: drinking more water, adding breakfast (usually oats with cooked fruit in it) switched to plant milk with matcha, tried to avoid gluten and reduced my coffee intake to one per day (or none) No special meal prepping, no crazy tracking, no macros obsession.

Here’s the surprising part:
Most days, ChatGPT calculated my intake to be between 900–1100 kcal on sedentary days, and around 750 kcal on active days with light activity (e.g., 30–60 mins of Pilates or swimming).

I’ve been dealing with mild IBS for years, and bloating is still a consistent issue. However, these calorie numbers really made me wonder:

Have I been unknowingly undereating for years?

My recent bloodwork showed mildly slowed thyroid function (TSH slightly elevated, FT3/FT4 still within range), which could align with that.

Has anyone else gone through a similar experience — realizing they’ve been in a long-term mild caloric deficit without knowing?

Would love to hear your thoughts or similar stories.

---

**TL;DR**:
32F, 157 cm, 62.5 kg. Mediterranean diet, no fast food, skipped breakfast for years, drank lots of coffee. Used ChatGPT to track calories based on what I normally eat. Turns out I average \~900–1100 kcal (even less with activity). I’ve been losing weight slowly, have mild IBS, and recent bloodwork shows mildly sluggish thyroid. Did I unintentionally undereat for years?

But I don’t care about that, and it doesn’t bother me.

I've been going to the library for the past six months to prepare for my exams. Whenever I sit near a woman in an available seat, she moves away. It's happened so many times, and honestly, it really feels humiliating.

It’s not just in the library—I’ve felt this in coffee shops, restaurants, temples, and other public places too.

 You might wonder if I’m just imagining it, but I’ve paid close attention. When other men, even strangers, sit near them, the girls stay. But when I do, they move away.

I don’t even like talking to them, and I never try to approach anyone. I just want to sit in an available spot and focus on my work.

Is there something I should change about my personality or body language?

A rush of adrenaline.

His thumb moved furiously across the screen, darting like a trapped animal. The phone, dense and warm, pressed into the second joint of his pinkie as he typed. His hand cramped. He hit send.

A flicker of endorphins followed. He exhaled, stretched his fingers, and read the words aloud. Angry. Righteous. Just superior enough to sting. It made him feel something.

A typo. Damn!

He edited the comment, then again, and again. Over and over, like a scab he could not leave alone. Twenty edits. Maybe thirty. He had lost track. It hardly mattered.

He imagined the school board member reading it. He imagined her breath catching, her posture tightening. Perhaps even a flash of shame. The bruise of his words landing precisely where he meant them to. The thought brought something close to satisfaction, or maybe validation.

No one would see it until morning, but that didnt matter. He was already watching it unfold in his mind, where everything felt simpler and more controlled. In that version of the world, he was always right.

The likes would come. They always did. Not many. Three, maybe four. Just enough to take the edge off the loneliness. The approval had grown dull over time. Predictable. Still, he waited for it. Refreshed for it. Counted on it.

He read the comment aloud again, this time in a sing-song voice. He had been doing that more often lately, speaking to himself in full sentences, even entire conversations. Since the girlfriend left six years ago. Since the pandemic sealed him in. Since the world stopped pretending it needed him.

The apartment smelled of old coffee and dirty socks. Dust caked the windows. Dishes had begun to lean in the sink. The spider plant on the sill had collapsed weeks ago, its limbs brittle, its soil bone-dry. He couldn’t remember the last time he had gone outside.

But the screen was always there.

He hadn’t always been like this.

There had been a time when his voice carried weight, or at least when he believed it did. He had seen himself as principled, informed, the sort of person others might turn to. Or so he liked to think.

But the world had grown louder and faster, and no one had waited for him.

So he turned to noise. To certainty. To the illusion of clarity. The illusion of relevance. Disruption, he told himself, was still a form of presence.

His thumb, greasy, traced another line across the screen. Refresh. Refresh. Still nothing.

He imagined enemies in every thread, adversaries struck by the sharp edge of his language. But the truth was simpler and harder. Most people didn’t think about him at all.

That was the deeper pain. He was still intelligent, still passionate. But it all came out sideways now, as anger, as accusation, as punishment. His gifts had collapsed inward. What remained was a slow unraveling, visible to anyone still watching.

Some part of him still knew that he could have done good. That he could have helped. That he could have mattered. But that voice had grown faint, nearly silent.

Most of the online groups had banned him. Most of his neighbors had blocked him. He posted now into a quiet space that barely echoed back. A digital canyon of loneliness. He imagined himself a martyr, but the rest of the world had simply gone on.

A light came on in the house next door.

Had he been shouting again?

His neighbor didn’t look out. She didn’t need to. She closed the window, long accustomed to ignoring the sound of his voice.

Silence returned.

The phone glowed in his palm, too hot, too bright. His shoulders sagged.

Desperation settled in again. Not loud, not sharp. The quiet kind. The kind that lives in your bones.

He tapped the screen one more time.

Refresh.

Looking for advice and I guess comfort(?) on how to not be an annoying customer. So I was a barista at a local coffee shop for a decade so I understand barista life (mind you, not Starbucks life), how customers can be picky, and how mess up’s can happen. I also have an ED so I’m very picky about things I consume out of fear (I know, whole other issue I need to work out but not the point of this post). I was wondering 
1) how often do drink mess up’s actually happen? 
2) how can I not be annoying as a customer with a picky drink order? 

I know for me the most annoying customers were the ones who were demanding and rude. I place my picky order on the app and always try to be as kind as possible when I pick it up. I have, however, thrown away countless drink because I’m afraid they were made incorrectly (as in too much half and half or almond milk, made with more pumps of a syrup than I wanted, regular vanilla being used instead of sugar free, or sugar being used instead of Splenda). I don’t want to be a burden or annoying so I just end up wasting however much money I spent on my drink and either end up throwing it out when I get home or giving it to someone.

I'm working remote and had a very important client Zoom call this morning. I had a ton of black coffee and a breakfast burrito beforehand, tragic combo.

Mid-call, I felt the gut gurgle. I was muted, so I figured I could just gently let one out. I shifted my weight, leaned to the side, and released the beast.

It was not gentle. It echoed on my wooden chair with reverberation. And yes, I was muted… but my mic reactivates automatically when you speak.

The client paused. Then said, “Um, are you okay?”

I froze. I panicked and said, “Oh sorry, that was my chair!”

Then someone, I think from accounting, had the AUDACITY to say, “That chair needs an exorcism.”

I'm never going to live this down. I turned my camera off and pretended my internet dropped. I’m considering faking my own death.

TL;DR: Tried to sneak a 💩💨 on Zoom. Mic picked it up. Client heard it. I no longer exist.",0,1750943944.0,tifu,8,0.24,False

Context - I have been chatting with this guy I really like on Grindr due to a few different circumstances I don’t think we would be able to actually meet … not anytime soon anyways.

He has my head in a spin. Blowing hot and cold. Being romantic one moment and then seeming like he’s only interested in sex.

So I was fed up of feeling a certain kind of way. Made plans to hook up with another guy who was way more local. Good body, great dick, ehh face. was obsessed with me. Which felt kinda good.

Spent a few hours with this other guy doing all sorts of stuff after while I couldn’t help but think ‘god just finish already’ and ‘I want this to be over’ and I kept looking at the clock. He did eventually finish then wanted to finish me off. Tbh I couldn’t get there. Not until I jacked myself off thinking of the first guy from Grindr (the one I actually like but messes me around)

Now I feel really low and shit about myself. Kind of feel like a bad person. Just feel somewhat sick in my stomach.

Not really a question, just have no one to talk to about this stuff

BG: diagnosed with autism several years ago, currently on training programme, OH appointment was because I had disclosed autism and anxiety/depression 

So felt like this was the biggest tick box exercise. Immediately when they asked about the depression they said, “So you feeling good?”

Had to awkwardly say actually no, rough few months, medication adjustment, awaiting CBT, SI

“Oh. Well, ok. Here’s a leaflet.”

(Proceeds to give a leaflet which basically sounds like OH should cover? But outsourced?)

Then, “Any adjustments you need?”

“Actually I wanted to ask about that. I’m not sure what I can ask for. For example, I really struggle to have somewhere quiet to concentrate.”

In my current job there’s no doctor’s office as it’s now an MDT room, so despite it being the only work space for us there’s a constant flow of people having lunch, having coffee, having board rounds for other teams, discussing physio patients, etc. 

So OH is like, “Hmm yes well there are quiet places to go to in the hospital you know! How about going to sit in the chapel?”

Yes what a fantastic idea. We will gather all the autistic people in the hospital and tell them to sit in the chapel. Answering bleeps surrounded by actual worshippers. 

So has anyone actually had any useful advice from OH? I tried to explain how rotations made me extremely ill with anxiety and how I would benefit from meeting some of the team prior to changeover to help adjust. They looked at me like I was senile.

But I have hit such a wall with my career. I suddenly have no interest in it anymore. I guess it's not all that sudden, it's been a combination of bad colleagues, bad company, imposter syndrome, and burnout for 3 years. But now I can't even bare the meetings, messages and emails. I try to start my work and it's overwhelming and feels impossible. Every day I'm terrified of getting some kind of improvement plan.
I'm not motivated to move to another company as I think I've become disconnected with the industry on the whole.

Most days I feel desperate to hand my notice in and take a part time job at a cafe or coffee shop. I want a slower pace, simpler problems, and more time for me. I struggle to get up in the morning, stay awake in the afternoon, brush my teeth or put my bra on some days. I feel I've lost discipline, I keep allowing myself to run away, wake up later, leave work earlier, skip time etc. This has evolved in someone who even used to feel bad taking a day of sick leave and unsure if I was sick enough.

I've read about skill regression. I feel I have experienced some of this. I feel it could be PDA tendencies too.

I built this because I was tired of seeing small SaaS teams (like mine) drowning in scattered feedback while enterprise tools cost a fortune. We'd spend hours manually tagging reviews, copying feedback into ChatGPT, and still miss critical insights that could make or break our retention.

So I said f\*ck it - let's build something that works for teams like us.

**Feedmux** automatically pulls feedback from multiple platforms, uses AI to find patterns we'd never catch manually, and tells us exactly what's killing our revenue. No more spreadsheet hell. No more missed signals.

The journey has been brutal - countless late nights debugging integrations, rebuilding the AI models multiple times, and honestly questioning if anyone would even care. But seeing early customers save hours weekly and catch churn signals way earlier... It's worth every sleepless night.

My story doesn’t really begin with me in elementary school but begins with my parents and my grandparents. Like all families, our ancestors’ decisions have helped create the backdrop of our lives and our stories. Yes, all of us are still dealing with the decisions some of our family members have made for us. Many of these decisions were made years before you and I were ever born. Many of these decisions were made by people we have never even met. These people died long before we ever came on the scene. These decisions concerning where they choose to live may have affected the place you now live. The religions your relatives believed in could have been passed down to them by their parents. These people, in turn, would try to pass their thought systems down to their children. This would possibly effect many future generations in one way or another. What kind of education, morals and even the sexual peculiarities your ancestors had, may be things you are still having to deal with today. These and other things, all affect our upbringing and thus our lives. Many of our decisions we make later in our lives would be a direct result of the programing we were given as a young child.

There are many different roads a person can take and each crossroad brings on all new possibilities.

My first possible crossroad happened to me when I was only a couple of days old. I was still in the hospital with my mother. Somehow there was a mix up. Another woman was taking me home by mistake. As I was leaving with her, I started crying. My mother heard this cry and told the nurses that the baby who was crying was hers. Much to everyone’s surprise, she was right. Who knows, I could have ended up being raised by a good Catholic family and not by the Jehovah’s Witnesses at all. In which case, this book would have never have been written.

There is no need to go back generations of my family – to all those wonderful and strange people who helped shape the attitudes and behaviors of my two parents, Norma and Marty – to set the groundwork for this strange story. Like most people, my parents have proved to be the key players.

My mother was a Kansas farm girl of Czechoslovakian and German ancestry. My father was a New York City Italian. Needless to say, these two people had little in common. They were brought together by way of World War II. If it weren’t for the war, they probably would have never even met. Besides killing a lot of people, war brings a lot of people together. In their case, it was love at first sight.

My mother never talked much to us kids about her years growing up in Kansas during the Great Depression and there was a good reason for that.

One of her few childhood memories she relayed to me was about a hot summer day in Kansas. She and her family were driving down a dusty dirt road going to church. All of the windows were rolled down and dust was pouring into their 1931 Ford. Her father, who loved chewing tobacco, decided to spit a big wad of it out of the open window. The wind caught the black juice and propelled it back into the back seat of their car and all over my mother and her white dress.

My grandfather was a gambler and the town bootlegger. He owned a pool hall. I think of him as kind of like the character Ryan O’Neal played in the movie Paper Moon. He spent a lot of time out of town “on business.” He didn’t do much to take care of his wife and kids.

On the night of February 12, 1934, my grandfather was on one of his long road trips. My grandmother, Mabel, was alone with their four small children. She was only twenty-eight years old and pregnant with their fifth child. With no money, no food and no hope, she took matters into her own hands. I have no idea what was going through her mind that cold Kansas winter night. The night she bled to death after her failed abortion attempt with a coat hanger.

After her death, my mother and her brothers and sister were shipped off to different relatives. My mother was only eight years old when she went to stay with her grandfather on her father’s side. He loved Norma. A lot. How many people get a free farm worker and sex slave dropped into their laps?

We didn’t find out what happened to Mom until many years after her death. In fact, I was the one who brought it up to my father. I told him I thought Mom had been sexually abused as a child. He didn’t want to believe it at first.

There were some strange things about Mom, I told him. Like when he would come home from work and wanted a kiss from her. If we kids were around, she would push him away. Dad told me he hardly ever saw her nude – the lights were always out. She was very shy. Needless to say, the sex was terrible, he told me. Years later, my father had the story confirmed about her grandfather from another family member. It put a lot of the pieces of the puzzle together.

My father, who had sex with many women before he met my mother, loved the fact that Mom was a “good girl.” Mom told him there would be no sex before marriage. This was the type of girl you should marry, my dad thought to himself. He soon found out there would be little or no sex after marriage, too.

Anyway, my mom made her escape from Kansas when she was just 17. In 1943, she moved to Southern California. Her relatives were sad to see her go. She moved in with an aunt and got work immediately. The war was going strong and California was booming in the 1940s. I’m sure she felt like her life could finally begin.

My dad, on the other hand, had grown up in the Bronx in a close-knit Italian family. Sunday dinners with all of the relatives were always fun. They would start around 3 p.m. after Mass, and there was always lots of good food and conversations. The grandfathers were nice to their grandkids unlike my mother’s side of the family. I think my dad enjoyed his childhood. He always had a twinkle in his eye when he talked about growing up during the Great Depression. He was the oldest male of four children. As the first-born male in an Italian family, he was spoiled rotten.

Women run the show in most Italian families. Many of the men love it that way. They end up marrying someone who starts out being their lover and moves into the role of their mother. This is what happened with my father. My folks had a total parent/child relationship. My mom became the mother/parent to her brothers and sister when her mother died. She was in mother mode when she met my father. My father, on the other hand, was the kid who never grew up. You can see these kinds of relationships in many marriages.

The story of how my dad and mom first met went something like this: They were both at a USO club in Santa Monica, California, in 1943. Big band music was playing. My dad was looking pretty good in his corporal uniform. He said Mom was the prettiest girl at the dance. He gathered up his courage and walked up to my mother. She was only seventeen and sitting alone at a small table. She had a yellow rose pinned to her white dress.

“So... tell me, why is the prettiest girl at this dance sitting here all alone, with no one to dance with? Is your dance card full?” My dad asked.

“No, my dance card is not full, Corporal. Maybe I’m more woman than most men can handle.”

“Wow that sounds dangerous.”

“Very dangerous!”

“Okay...how about a test drive? How about a dance? I’m Marty Casarona.”

“Alright, Marty, you look brave enough. I’m Norma Johansen.”

“Oh...a German. I’m a lucky guy!” “And you’re an Italian. This could mean trouble.”

My dad took my mom by the hand to the dance floor, and they began to dance. After about one minute, he smiled. “This isn’t so bad.”

Mom said nothing and just smiled back. Before she knew it, my dad’s hand started to move down her back. His hand ended up touching the top of her butt. Mom pulled away from him and slapped his face as hard as she could. Mom was upset and left the dance floor. She went back to take her chair. Dad was dazed, standing there alone with his face beet red. People around the dance floor started to laugh. With tears in his eyes, he walked back over to mom and got down on his knees. Mom looked in the other direction.

“Please...please I’m so sorry,” he said with remorse.

She turned and looked at Dad and just smiled. It was love at first sight for sure.

They got married in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1944 and just like the song says, “They got married in a fever.” My dad was going to be shipped overseas. He wanted to make sure no one would snap up my mother while he was away. Plus, since there was a possibility of being killed fighting the Japanese, he begged my mom to tie the knot. He thought if he was going to die, he might as well have sex with my mom first. Since she was one of the few women who turned down my father’s advances, it would be one more notch on the belt.

This reminds me of the only “sex talk” my dad ever gave me. I was sixteen and walking down the hall. My father was shaving in the bathroom.

“Keith, come here for a minute.” My dad never took his eyes off the mirror. “Your mother wanted me to talk to you about…. uh…you know…sex.”

“Oh,” was my only response.

“I’m sure you know how it all works. So, I have only two things to say to you. Be careful. The last thing you want is to get some young stupid girl knocked up…right?”

“Uh…that’s right, Dad.”

“Okay. The other thing I want to tell you, is to always go after the good-looking girls. They are just as lonely as the ugly ones! Got it?”

“Yeah…sure, Dad.”

“Make me proud son.”

My dad was a New York City hustler for sure. His grand adventure began when he got shipped overseas. He spent two-and-a-half years in Honolulu, having the time of his life. He would have tears in his eyes years later when he would tell everyone he ever met that those two years were the best years of his life.

He told me many times, with a gleam in his eye, “You could have been half Japanese!” I didn’t really know what he meant by that. Before he died in 2012, he told me about his secret love affair with a young Japanese girl on Oahu.

My dad told me that Hawaii was a paradise back in the war years. There was just one problem: no women. Well, there were women, but there wasn’t enough of them. There were tens of thousands of young service men who longed for a woman’s companionship on the island. It was the law of supply and demand, and demand was high. It was so high that there were literally lines in front of whorehouses in downtown Honolulu.

He was always looking for short cuts in his life. Ways to “beat the house,” as he would say. Nothing gave my father more satisfaction than beating the system, any system, which is why my father didn’t make a very good Jehovah’s Witnesses. Whereas the Jehovah’s Witnesses are all about following rules, my dad was all about bending them, if not completely breaking them. Some of the rules he never really liked were the “no smoking” and “no sex outside of marriage rule.” He wasn’t keen on the “no gambling” and “no lying and no stealing” ones, either.

My father, even though he was married, had a real problem in Hawaii. How was he going to get laid? More importantly, how was he going to get laid and not pay for it?

One Saturday, he and a couple of friends, decided to explore the island of Oahu. They took their jeep and drove it to the north end of the island. They found small villages nestled in the jungle paradise. To their surprise, they also found a lot of Japanese-Americans living there. They stopped at a shack that looked like some kind of restaurant and ordered a couple of beers. The old man who served them was pleasant enough. They couldn’t help but notice a couple of good-looking Asian girls working in the back.

My dad had to ask, “You folks Chinese?”

“No, my friend, we’re of Japanese ancestry.”

“Really? We thought they shipped all you Japs…I mean, you folks, to camps.”

“No…many but not all. We are good Americans. In fact, my son is serving with the 442 Regiment in Italy. Have you boys seen combat yet?”

“No. We are with a headquarters’ unit and will probably never leave Hawaii.” “Well, my son has. He has killed lots of Germans and Italians!”

“Hey, Pops, I’m Italian!”

“Really? Did they ship off any of your family to the camps like they did ours?”

“No, they didn’t.”

The old man just stood there and shook his head. Even my Dad could see the irony in it. “I know it’s pretty messed up.”

“Yes, it is son. In fact, my family can’t even go down to Honolulu without the servicemen there giving them some kind of beating.”

“How do you get your supplies then?”

“With great difficulty.” Dad got a strange look on his face. There was an angle here for sure.

The old man started to smile. “I must admit we don’t see too many of you guys up on this end of the island, which is fine by us.”

Dad smiled. “Really…what is your name?”

“Mutsuhiro.”

“Well, Mutsuhiro, that is about to change.” My dad was a staff sergeant and had this great job in the motor pool. How did he get this job? He lied. He said he was an ace mechanic before the war. He knew very little about how motor vehicles worked at all. He literally did nothing all day long. If a vehicle needed repair, he would just delegate it to someone else, or red tag it. If it were red tagged, they would just load it up on a barge, take it out past the reef and push it into the blue Pacific Ocean. Funny how all these folks back home were saving cooking grease and trying to scrape together ten dollars to buy a war bond, and my father had no problem destroying a whole jeep because it had a cracked windshield.

However, if you needed a jeep, Dad was your man. He would trade jeeps and other vehicles for favors. Sometimes he lent out all the jeeps. For example, if an officer asked for a jeep to go to town on a date, sometimes he might get an eight-ton truck instead. He loved giving the officers grief and doing deals on the side: It was a double bonus. My dad hated any kind of authority. During the war, gas was selling for 15 cents per gallon and was highly rationed. However, on the black market you could sell it for almost two bucks a gallon. Dad told me how he would steal gas from the Navy. The motor pool would send their five-thousand-gallon tanker truck to the shipyard. My dad got the idea to strap on twenty-five gallon jerry cans to the side of the truck. The Navy hated to fill those small cans, but they did anyway.

Dad’s commanding officer would get the receipt for 5,100 gallons of gasoline and call in my father. “What the hell is this, Sergeant? Our truck only holds 5,000 gallons.”

“You know those Navy guys. They are all screwed up.” Yep, my dad had an answer for everything.

One of my father’s greatest coups was sugar for sex. If there was anything harder to get than gas during the war, it was sugar. One of my dad’s friends was Walter, the mess hall sergeant. He told Walter about all the lovely, Asian women that lived on the north end of the island. It wasn’t long before two jeeps that were loaded down with 50-pound bags of sugar, coffee and gas were heading north to do some trading with some of his new Japanese American friends.

After a couple of months of this, my dad and his friends were treated like kings. Not only did the villagers get some sugar in their coffee, they were treated like real people.

So, I guess I could have been half-Japanese. Maybe there is a half-brother or sister of mine somewhere in Hawaii who looks half-Italian too. Who knows?

However, there was a part of my father that was Japanese, even though both his parents were full-blooded Italian emigrants. How could this be?

All Dad’s dental work was done for free in the Army. The Army used silver for dentistry. Dad needed some crowns implanted, but he wanted gold crowns instead of silver. It was going to cost him a small fortune using the Army’s gold.

“No problem.” His dentist told him. “You can get all the gold you need for under a hundred bucks.”

“How?”

“Easy, the first Marine division is in town. They got the gold you are looking for.”

“The Marines have gold?”

“Yes, they do. It is Jap gold, son!”

“Jap gold?”

“The Marines do some dentistry work on our Jap friends. After they kill them, they collect their gold fillings from their teeth.”

“Oh.”

“If that bothers you, you can always pay full price.”

So, guess where his gold crowns came from?

There was another story he loved to relate. I must have heard it a hundred times. It was the chocolate-for-whiskey story.

One day, my father was chomping down on a Hershey chocolate bar. There were two more on his desk, all of which he had stolen out of the C-ration kits. A young officer from Alabama strolled into the motor pool to get a jeep. “What’s that you eating there, Sergeant?”

“A chocolate bar.”

“Well, I really like chocolate, and it’s hard to get it around here.”

“It sure is, but whiskey is even harder to get.”

Whiskey was rationed and hard to come by. The officers were entitled to one-fifth of Three Feathers Whiskey per month. There was plenty of beer for everyone, but not much hard liquor was available.

“I don’t drink,” the officer said.

My dad got that look in his eyes again. There was a deal in the making here. “I‘d be happy to give you ten Hershey chocolate bars for your bottle of whiskey.”

“Really? You could do that?”

“Sure. It’ll be tough, but I could make that happen.” It wasn’t that tough. My dad had access to hundreds of boxes of C-rations where he could steal all of the chocolate bars he wanted.

So, this went on for many months. They traded chocolate bars for whiskey. Dad had a waiting list for the booze. He would get as much as $80 a bottle. This was my father’s finest moment: screw the establishment and make money, too. What could be better?

Things do change. The battalion went on a forty-mile hike one day. Everyone stopped for lunch. The young lieutenant who had struck the deal with my dad sat down on a rock and opened up his C-rations. Much to his surprise, he looked down at his Hershey chocolate bar and realized it was the same kind that my father was selling him.

The next day, the lieutenant called my father in for a talk. All hell broke loose.

“So, Sergeant Casarona, what do you do with the whiskey I’ve been giving you?”

“Selling it mostly.”

“How much a bottle?”

About $40 a bottle.”

“Ok…. Our deal is still on but I want $30 a bottle on top of the chocolate.”

“Yes, sir!”

Dad was still coming out on top.

Yes, my father was having the time of his life in Hawaii. Wheeling and dealing and making new friends. Then the worst possible thing happened. The war ended. The party was over. He told me on VJ Day you could hear a pin drop in the barracks. There was no celebration. Their two-year vacation in Hawaii would soon be over. It would be back to the real world before they knew it. All the kids out of the pool.

I always wondered how he ended it with his Japanese girlfriend. I remembered seeing her picture in his Army photo album once. My father had a big dilemma; he already was going to have a hard time explaining his new German Protestant wife to his Italian-Catholic family in the Bronx. So, I don’t think his Japanese-Buddhist girlfriend ever had a chance. Yep, my dad had one too many women in his life. Because of that choice, I ended up half German rather than half Japanese.

Dad’s family never did like my mother and her strange religion anyway. In their minds, my dad was supposed to have come home to the Bronx and marry a nice Italian Catholic girl. Marty was always the rebel.

My mother died in 1983. In 1991 my 69 year old Father married Marina, a twenty five year old woman from Costa Rica. In 1993 early one morning I called my Father up. A sleepy Marina answered the phone. “Hello.” A little surprised I asked. “Is my Father there?” She handed the phone to my Dad. I wasn’t surprised my father was still sexually active. “Hey Dad.” With no joy in his voice, he announced. “I need to tell you something...I got married.”

Marina always wanted to own a dress shop. So of course he bought her one. What did my high school dropout Father and she know about the apparel business? I don’t know. They both learned a lot about that kind of business after he lost hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to make it work for her.

The marriage ended shortly after she went back to Costa Rica and came back pregnant. She told my Father she had been artificially inseminated. My Father believed her for about a year. One day he found a picture of her with their baby and the guy who had volunteered to (not) artificially inseminate her.

He always loved Asian women though. When Dad died in 2012, his girlfriend, (or who knows maybe it was his wife) was 40 years younger than him. She was from Thailand.

He told me he had the best sex of his life with her. It was all about the sex for him and all about the money for her. When he died, he left her everything. Judging from how often he told me they had sex – and what his net worth was at the time of his death – I figured it cost him about $880 every time they had sex. I hope it was the best sex he ever got, because he could have gotten a Las Vegas hooker for the same money. Yes, she had him wrapped around her little finger, as did my mother and his second wife Marina.

Dad sent me his will in 2007. It outlined how he basically gave everything to his girlfriend. It didn’t bother me that I wasn’t mentioned, but he made no provisions for his grandchildren. I was very upset about this and called him up.

“Dad, I don’t care about me, but nothing for your grandkids?”

“Relax, I got you guys covered,” he said.

“Really? What are you talking about?” “I’m making you the executor to my will. This is your ace in the hole.”

“What are you talking about?”

“It’s simple. This is how it will work. Once I’m dead, you, as the executor of the will, can contest it.”

“What?”

“After I’m dead, I don’t give a shit about her. You can contest the will and get all the money back.”

I try to live my life very Zen. However, I can’t recall a time when I have been so angry. I totally lost it.

“Are you out of your mind?” I yelled. “The last thing I want to do after you’re dead is get a lawyer and spend thousands of dollars trying to clean up the mess you’ve created.”

“But Keith, you have the ace in the hole.”

Needless to say, when my father did pass away in 2012, I didn’t get a lawyer to straighten out the mess he had the joy of creating.

Dad was totally uxorious when it came to the women in his life!

1lkzrbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lkzrbw/whats_best_to_do_about_my_f23_talking/,What's best to do about my (F23) talking stage/situationship (M24) who flaked on me but won't stop chasing me?,"(LONG EXPLANATION FOR CONTEXT)

We met on Tinder this past September 2024. I already had an idea of who he was since we're from a small town and have common acquaintances, it's just that we never happened to meet one on one in person. He is insanely my type physically may I add. He asked to hangout within that weekend of our match, but I got my acceptance letter for grad school last minute and had to leave abroad immediately. It remained as this unfulfilled thing I kept wondering about the whole semester I was back at uni.

We reconnected again December 2024, talked everyday, he kept saying how much he likes me, that he appreciates he met someone like me on Tinder considering people are so unserious and weird, and that he wants me in his life and wants to spend time with me and get to know me more. Kept asking when Im done with exams for the semester, that he cant wait to see me during winter break and have all these conversation in person, that he'll take me out, restaurants, coffee shops, motorbike rides by the sea and that he genuinely wants to be in my presence and see how things will unfold. From what I understood, he's deep down a hopeless romantic who has been done dirty in the past and has kinda turned bitter and a player. He also does this whole trap music thing, makes songs, smokes w\*\*d, partying drinking, lyrics about sex and non-committal stuff etc... It was a red flag to me, but i didnt wanna cancel out someone because of that, i know music has genres and culture and ultimately a lifestyle behind it... Many people act tuff but doesnt mean they're criminals just cuz they like x type of music ... Even though we're very different, he's extroverted, quite popular with music etc while Im more of a loner, closed off and introverted. Yet there's this mutual pull for some reason.

I rushed my exam period to return back on the island to spend time with him. He kept saying how he cant wait to see me. Some shit goes down around January, the whole island catches a very heavy flu and everybody was sick for weeks (i live kinda isolated in the countryside when im back home so I didnt catch it). He caught it, my friends caught it, even grandparents. He said he was feeling horrible but still had to show up for work, and we kept texting and sending reels but zero substance or actual plans for anything. Nearly 2 months passed of me being on the island... I postponed internships, went out of my way considering I have a life and responsibilities abroad and he knew I was here the whole time yet didnt do shit about it... It shall be noted that during our last interaction (on a saturday), we arranged the date to happen on Tuesday (his day off) at x place, x time. 3 days go by, no text, no call, didnt hear from him again at all. Tuesday comes, nothing. Another week passes, he kept on sending me memes... I simply didnt respond again...

From that day onward, he started posting teasers of his unreleased songs he was recording on social media with hints about me/our situation, including hints that I ghosted him, left him on seen and overall very butthurt energy. Same thing with quotes, sassy butthurt captions under his posts, lyrics of songs etc, ongoing situation. I did leave him on seen, but there was clearly a reason. He didnt respect my time, energy and investment. I was genuinely SOOOO into him, wanted to get to know him, spend time and had nothing but the best intentions. He kept doing this nonstop, the entire spring semester I was back in school, even til this day.

He kept viewing my story within nanoseconds, liking everything I post, liking every meme I like from common pages etc. I didn't wish him happy birthday and I forced myself so hard not to reach out because I really cared and really wanted to wish him. But I just pulled my energy back and wanted to make it known what he did was not okay.

Now Im back on the island again for the summer season since May, working a summer job, will be here til October. Once he saw my story of a well-known beach he liked it immediately and reached out, asking if im back already. I replied with a sarcastic tone, letting him know Im not letting sh\* t slide. He didnt apologise, didnt say sorry or show willingness to address his behavior back in February. i was here nearly 2 months, we were in the same place and he didnt do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about it. Leading me on via text months in advance getting my hopes up. He then simply came up with the pettiest, most low-effort excuse possible - that he didnt have a vehicle and didnt wanna drag me all the way to the city center (such horse sh\*t, he was with friends all day everyday, making tiktoks, studio recordings, posting stories nonstop, excursions, he was perfectly fine - and i told him city center is no problem for me, even though i live half an hour away im coming everyday to be with grandma during morning hours). Couldn't make time for one afternoon coffee with me? After he initiated it all and kept wanting to do all these plans? He said haha gotta agree, anyway im free Tuesdays. In such a desensitised almost demanding tone, zero remorse, talking as if owe him a meetup/date after all this time. I asked him whether that's how a decent human behaves and he said no, but I would prefer to tell you whatever there is to be told in person, not from here. If you dont want that to happen i understand. That just screams manipulation to me. I left him on seen again, didnt continue the bs, there is nothing to be told really if he doesnt get it himself. Either that or he plays stupid and avoids accountability on purpose. Or he is legit brain fried by whatever he's taking. He still hasnt stopped liking my stuff and even reached out for my birthday yesterday, posting love songs about unfulfilled love stories and fumbling, bittersweet stuff, drawings/sketches/animated female figures that look like me and a bunch of clues.

He could be screwing someone else or entertaining multiple other people at the time he was interacting with me. Im not saying I ever trusted him blindly, but I chose to set my cynicism aside for once and start anew.

NOW LETS GET TO THE POINT:

The thing is, everyone in my environment is currently gaslighting me, telling me it wasnt that deep, it didnt matter that much, it was all virtual via a screen anyway, he didn't owe you sh\* t during the talking stage and that he may actually be a really great guy in person. Maybe it's gonna be better than you could have ever imagined. My sister and friends suggest I go see him, even if nothing happens or even if I get the biggest ick imaginable, at least i wont have this ruminating ""what if"" haunting me and get it off my conscience. I know technically nobody owes you nothing during the talking stage, but it kinda does show character. Leading people on for months, giving them hope, playing around, flaking on them with plans YOU KEPT INITIATING and wouldn't shut up about, not following through with any of your promises is just madness in my books. And on top of that popping back up as if nothing happened and demanding to hang out (?) Is someone like that worth the time of day? I dont care about his lame ass excuses, I refuse to show up, sit there like a clown and have him lie to my face. Additionally, he might not even register what he did as bad or disrespectful. Maybe that's his casual way of going about people, keeping options open, Casanova energy, zero seriousness. Maybe I took it more seriously than I should have, while for him i could have been  just a random tinder swipe and nothing else. It's not worth it that I go and talk about why his behavior hurt me if he doesnt acknowledge it in the first place. Yet why all this chase and obsession on his part?

Why I lost $15k and learned a brutal lesson about monitoring.,"    I need to share a story that still haunts me. It's about the day I learned that uptime monitoring isn't optional - it's essential.
    
    I run an e-commerce store. Not huge, but profitable. We do about $50k/month in sales.
    
    Black Friday 2023. I was excited. We had prepared everything:
    - Inventory stocked
    - Ads ready to go
    - Team on standby
    - Coffee ready
    
    I launched our Black Friday campaign at 6 AM. Sales started coming in immediately.
    
    By 9 AM, we had already done $8k in sales. I was feeling good.
    
    Then at 9:15 AM, my phone started blowing up with angry messages from customers.
    
    ""Our site is down!""
    ""Can't complete my purchase!""
    ""What's going on?""
    
    I checked the site. Completely down. Server error 500.
    
    I panicked. Called my hosting provider. They said there was a server issue affecting multiple customers.
    
    3 hours later, the site was back up. But the damage was done.
    
    I lost $15k in potential sales during those 3 hours. Customers went to my competitors. Some never came back.
    
    The worst part? I had no monitoring in place. I didn't know the site was down until customers told me.
    
    I was checking the site manually every few hours, but I missed the 3-hour window that cost me thousands.
    
    I immediately signed up for a monitoring service. But they all had the same problem - per-site pricing that was expensive for multiple endpoints.
    
    So I built my own solution. Now I monitor:
    - Main website
    - Checkout page
    - Product pages
    - All for a flat monthly fee
    
    The peace of mind is worth every penny. I'll never lose $15k to downtime again.
    
    If you run an e-commerce business, don't make my mistake. Get proper monitoring in place before you need it.
    
    Because when you need it, it's already too late.
    
    Maybe you're lucky and never experience downtime. Maybe your hosting is more reliable than mine.
    
    But $15k in lost sales is a brutal way to learn this lesson.

1lkzhnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/JohnAndCarolyn/comments/1lkzhnk/some_cool_cbk_anecdotes_i_found_online/,Some cool CBK anecdotes I found online.,"""When working at Fred Segal Santa Monica, I saw Carolyn in person. Before seeing her I had always appreciated her style, but heard she was unfriendly and supercilious. She went to the Levi's section, where she was helped by a man who didn't know who she was. He was always very friendly to everyone, and after she left he said that when he asked her something personal (I can't remember what) she kind of laughed. He then asked her if she was famous, and she thought he was joking- I would guess she was used to people fawning all over her because of who she was. When she told him who she was, they both laughed about it.  
  
When the two of them went to the cash register, all of us salespeople kind of gathered around her. It's strange- she didn't look flawless like she does in pictures (her skin was splotchy and pink, like someone who is using Retin-A, or has very sensitive skin). Also she was wearing a baseball cap, a baggy sweater and sweatpants - not very polished. But she was incredibly nice, and tolerant of the small crowd we formed around her. She even gave one salesgirl who liked her Nike shoes the phone number of the person who'd helped her get hers. So, when she left my impression of her had changed: she was very friendly, but not physically flawless. That's kind of reassuring, and it made that polished look she usually had seem that much more attainable. To weigh in on the Botox/eye surgery debate... I doubt it. I wouldn't be surprised at a chemical peel, but about 85% of the customers at Fred Segal had had work done, and it's pretty easy to spot at least some evidence of it. She really did not seem to have them.""

**Another one by Carolyn’s hairstylist Andre Rodman:**  
  
“I worked at a salon in NYC in the 90's and Carolyn used to come and get her color done and I would either and blow her hair dry or just a blowout. I used to cut her hair and my boss used to do her color, I loved her she was the coolest girl inside and out. She was so nice and always so elegant. She was mostly fun and I just remember her being so chic, she loved vintage 70's clothing. She would wear this vintage camel colored maxi coat that belted at the waist, bell bottom jeans that covered her feet, a turtleneck, a really thick wool cap and a purse. I did her hair for a year so saw her in different outfits but whenever i think of her that's how i always remember her.  
  
I was a new stylist on the floor that had just recently been promoted from assistant to stylist, so I was really shy and really just concentrating on my work. The guy who owned the salon was known for his color and highlight work and she would come and get her hair colored cut and blown out. The hair was so simple always straight or in a bun or high ponytail and it needed to look like she did it herself nothing styled and sprayed fresh from the salon she hated that look. She did not like full blown out salon hair, she liked it flat and straight like Marcia Brady and when we cut it she didn't want too much cut off and she didn't like it cut straight across, she liked jagged ends.  
  
I would always do her hair in a little private room, and i remember her saying to me, ""*close the door! Why are those people talking about me they don't even know me and if they're going to talk they can at least do it so i can't hear them""*

**Another anecdote:**

"" I met Carolyn Bessette once, as a teenager. I was getting my haircut at the Red Door in New York. This was when everyone was seeing Oribe. I, instead, had my first cut layers by the sweetest man named Danilo. He had just bought a puppy and had stacks and stacks of pictures he wanted to show me. I was more interested in the models like Yasmeen Ghauri and Tatjana Patitz holding his puppy in pictures than his actual dog.  
  
Before my haircut, my mom and I sat in the waiting room deciding what to do with my mass o’hair. This beautiful blond girl jumped into our conversation. She told us she worked for Calvin Klein. she was adamant that I ask for layers in my thick, half Japanese hair.  
  
She told me I was pretty (at a time when I couldn’t have hated myself more). She said her name was Carolyn. I think she knew I was miserable and sad. she didn’t have to talk to me. she could have read her magazine like i do when i wait for my hair. it’s sometimes the only time i get to be quiet. she reached out and made a difference. A couple of years later we saw her in the papers. she was so much sweeter in person than what we saw in the press.

**Another by Sue Erneta:**

As soon as I saw the page in InStyle magazine, I was taken back to 1993. I was 21 and living in New York City where I had just moved from Massachusetts. As a young girl dreaming of working in the fashion industry, I felt so lucky to land an internship with Fern Mallis of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. The CFDA was responsible for staging the runway shows in Bryant Park and it was the first year it has been done there. I was at the tents with Fern for a late night rehearsal one night with Calvin Klein. (Yes, I actually mean Mr. Calvin Klein.) He was running a rehearsal of his show with his new muse (Kate Moss!) and a pack of publicists. 

All of the publicists were chic and important looking but there was one that stood out. She was so effortlessly gorgeous and stylish and I remember thinking ‘Why is SHE not on that runway?’. She was blonde and stunning and she had on the sickest outfit that I can still picture to this day. She was wearing black Adidas sneakers, a floor-length sweeping velvet skirt, and a chunky black oversized turtleneck sweater. In the months that followed, I attempted to emulate that outfit 1000 different ways and I often wondered who that amazingly stylish girl was. About a year later, JFK Jr started dating a beautiful blonde socialite and I was not surprised when I saw her face in the tabloids. It was THE GIRL. The girl who worked for Calvin Klein. The girl with the Adidas sneakers and the sweeping skirt and the oversized sweater. We all know the rest of the sad story.”

**Another one:**

Carolyn used to smoke Marlboro Lights 100 and a brand called Merit in a yellow package. I know this from someone who owned a deli in Manhattan. She'd order a large coffee with half and half with 3 sugars. Sometimes after being out all night she'd also go in the morning and have an egg over easy, bacon and Swiss cheese on a kaiser bun. He said her bottom eye-bags were atrocious. Like baggage. So bad you could see them through sunglasses. She was always polite. Also, in the evenings she'd come on down for a 6 pack of her favorite beer, Molson Golden.

**And Another:**

Back in my Saks Fifth Avenue days, I met Carolyn Bessette and her mom when they came in to shop during our fine jewelry sale. She was definitely striking. I remember she went to use the ladies' room located in our Designer Sportswear dept. Well, when that poor thing walked out, every woman on our floor had lined the perimeter of the department to get a look at her. Can you imagine living your life like that??""

**One by Tony Lee:**

Carolyn was a client of mine at the high end designer vintage clothing boutique I managed in SoHo. She was loving, sweet and completely a star in the deepest sense of the word. Not a pretentious bone in her body. Her piercing but sweet blue grey eyes were amazing. She would come in and buy a simple pair of Levi's boot cut $50 jeans for herself but then spend $1000 on a Courreges jacket for a friends bday. When she would come in she would always bring me a coffee or choco croissant which she knew I loved from the bakery down the street. It was personally a super sad day for me when she passed.”

**Last one by Clare Waight Keller:**  
  
I would ride the elevator with JFK Jr, and see Carolyn Bessette at breakfast every morning. ‘She’d come to the office looking as though she’d rolled out of bed – hair all over the place, quite often in giant men’s sweaters, cropped jeans, little ballet flats or boots, and then when she had meetings she’d go shwoop and transform herself from super-cool street-casual to the most elegant thing you’d ever seen.""",22,1750942708.0,JohnAndCarolyn,3,1.0,False

I got MidNight Heels as a gift. It's fun, gives me nightclub vibes, not something I would wear often. Last for hours, and is kinda strong, more on the fruity sweet side but with a slight woody scent, making it fun and elegant.

I like it, it is sexy and gets compliments from my bf who is obsessed with it. It is pretty generic and It feels like I have smelled this DNA on a million girls as it is a clone of Good Girl Carolina Herrera, so personally it doesn't strike a chord with me. Like when I smell this I just see an idea of any girl who is 18-24 using this as their going out scent. Of course you feel very feminine wearing it. Floral with a linear blend of citrus and creamy perfumeyness. All the gourmand notes come together with the idea of a tiramisu topped with almonds (Not gourmand at all, just perfumey). I can pick out the coffee in it as well but like it is not distinct. Something about this perfume feels related to a chypre fragrance.

It was on my tenth birthday where we began this tirade.
I remember the day mostly in a fond light despite her efforts. I had my garden full with near everyone I knew; the best part of my class was testing the maximum capacity on my trampoline, the cries of the springs showing they were getting close to breaking it, my cousins were kicking a ball around my youngest cousin, still a baby, whilst others I didn't even know were milling around the garden, cupcake or drink in hand as they tried to speak over the cacophony of screams and constant chatter. Everyone was in the garden except my parents, who were sat in the front room. Despite my insistences, they refused to come out to the garden and join in with the party. Whenever I would happen to be inside whilst the door rang, I got to bear witness to a little system they had developed. The chimes would ring out from somewhere deep in the house to show a guest was here, then my mum would shoot up and take the corner of the curtain aside so she could peek outside. She would give an approving nod, maybe with a little ""humph"" to ensure my dad knew the guests at the door was safe. He would open the door, usher them in, call my name as if I wasn't just around the corner spying, and then I would come down the hall to say hello, averting my eyes if they had my gift in their hands to not seem desperate.
This seemed odd, especially in the sort of neighborhood where I know every one within a five block radius by name, but their system came to its purpose near the time where I could finally dive into the small pile of gift-wrapped gold sat on my dining table. When everybody began to form a circle around me, parents eyeing their kids to make sure they didn't shoot me a whisper about what they had bought me and kids finally stopping their teasing and joking to watch me drag the first present across the table towards me, the doorbell rang. My parents, still absent, swung into effect yet this time it was different. My mum only had to hesitate for a second after spotting the guest out the window for my dad to know. He lowered his head, took in a deep breath and then swung the door open.
The crowd conveniently filled in the gap so I could not see the door just as it swung open, but they had not shuffled across fast enough to stop me from catching a glimpse.
Her skin was pale, that of which was visible as she appeared to be wearing a heavy cardigan in the peak of summer. Her hair was stringy and wild, yet the face sat just below it wasn't visible as the shadows set by these wild strands of hair writhed and danced across her features. I was momentarily uncomfortable but I returned to my grin very quickly, after all this was the North of the country: pale skin and dark, wild hair was nothing out of the ordinary. Surely this wasn't who my parents were so afraid of. After a few moments out of sight, my parents swung round to the back of the crowd with this guest, the top of their heads visible through the small sea of shoulders. The crowd were getting impatient, parents beginning to tap their feet or kiss their teeth whilst the kids began to murmur so I set aside my worries and began to rip and tear at the presents.
A toy truck. Thank you.
A shirt with some generic graphic on the front. Thank you, I wanted this for a while.
A game to a console I didn't have. A small glance to my parents. Thank you, this is meant to be really good.
Eventually, the table was empty and people were filing out the door, a small fortune of presents being shipped up to my room by my friends and I, ensuring they did not hear the end of my gratitude until they were out the door. Once the house was empty, I returned to the dining room, stopping dead still for the first time that day. My parents were sat at the table, coffees in hand as they looked down at the wooden surface, their faces shielded by shadow but their disjointed breathing making it very clear something was wrong. She was at the head of the table, where I had sat opening my gifts.
She looked surprisingly normal, very clearly a relative of my dads, her weak chin and large eyes making her look as threatening as some sort of small rodent. I felt a small ire growing in my stomach as I clenched my jaw, making my way to the seat across from and between my parents having had my space upset by this thing. But I did so without so much as a peep in opposition to her presence. For in the center of her bug-like eyes, sat two pupils as dilated as they could possibly be, their needle points watching me as I tried to return her gaze in challenge only to find my eyes dropping down to watch the floor as I took my seat, the sweat of my hands dully noticed as I used them to pull my chair into the table. In the middle of the table, sat her gift.

It was wrapped poorly in paper clearly designated for Christmas time, the damp carboard box peaking out beneath dancing reindeers and smiling elves.
The smell wafted gently over, whispering its sinister connotations into my unwilling nose as I took a deep breath to steady my nerves. Finally, under her tight supervision, I pulled the present over to me and began to tear off the wrapping paper, guiding my fingers around the damp sections, shivering each time I brushed up against a wet spot. The carboard box sat bare after a few moments and I readied myself to pry open the lid.
The mouse was thin with matted fur, its tail naught but a pathetic stump.
The sections of carboard ripped open in sheer desperate fury on the inside made it all too clear the mouse had not even been dead when placed in the box. My dad took in a breath, the tone of which, if even possible, did not sound as anxious as earlier but now carried a clear wave of anger. The silence that sat so heavy now cracked as my mum let out an involuntary sob, thinking back it was clear she had been weeping to herself for the entire sickly build-up but her sorrow finally peaked as she cried openly.
She sat silent at the head of table, watching me as those paper-thin lips contorted at the corners to slightly peak up in a smirk. We remained in this state for a few moments, her watching with her deathly gaze, my dad trying to hold in a strong fury as he let a stiff hand out across the table to pat my mum's shoulder. Finally, I found the courage in me to pinch the mouse by its tail, or what remained of it, and hold it in front of my face.
""T-thank you."" My faux gratitude ebbed from my quivering lips.
Her eyebrows raised, inquisitive stare coming to form to replace the satisfied smirk. Yet I felt it in her powerful stare she was not fully convinced.
So, suppressing a gag, I took the mouse in my hand, its limp body folding in my grip as its fur bristled against my clenching fingers as unknown stains seeped into my skin. I took it up to my face and pressed it against my cheek, leaning slightly on it as one would do with a soft toy, feeling its skin begin to tense and the organs beneath bristle as I pushed into it yet I held.
""I love it. Thank you Auntie.""
Teeth clenched, she brought herself up from her seat and made her way towards the doorway.
She stopped by my seat on the way.
I tried to shoot my parents a pleading look, after all I'd done my part: why won't she go? Please make her go.
As I braced, a withered hand came down to embrace my shoulder, squeezing it until I felt her damn near embrace my collar bone. Nails stretched and flexed on the fabric of my shirt, leathery skin fighting any idea I had about her age. After all, she was meant to be younger than my dad, yet the veins visible on her hand as I peeked out of the side of my eye made this near unbelievable. Finally, she let go, my breath of relief dully noticed as she left. My parents were still facing the table, yet they were now breathing regularly, no longer heaving as they had sat in anticipation. Once I heard the door shut, the thud echoing through the desolate house, I lowered myself off my chair and let the tears come hard and fast.
I remember how we embraced as a family for a good few minutes, as if we had fought off some evil together, their embrace as we sat in silence gentle and loving in comparison to her grip, their whispers of how it was all okay now not suppressing my fearful sobs. Eventually, we broke the embrace, me going off to my room to enjoy my presents as my dad took the poor creature, a tool in the disgusting ritual, out to the garden. He buried it at the back, his silhouette digging through the soil bathed in moonlight as I watched him from my window.
I did not tell my parents about the blood beginning to leak through my shirt from my shoulder until my mother noticed my sheets sodden with dark red the next morning.

She did this every year.
I did not know why but the guiding light that had led me to accept the gift the first time kept persisting; no matter what she gave me, I always accepted it, her apparent frustration when I did so making it obvious this was the right answer.
A mix of soil and clotted blood which we had to bury, a mixture that still ebbs its horrendous smell through the lawn whenever summer heat hits? Thank you, Auntie.
A seemingly innocuous pack of biscuits, a sign she was perhaps changing? I thanked her as I felt the maggots shift below the surface of the packet.
One year a visiting relative, the type you never see so bust out all the stops when you do get to meet, brought me a puppy. I should have known I'd see him in a box the next year as soon as the beautiful golden retriever was placed in my arms. That was the first time I cracked after my 10th birthday, crying as I forced out a meek ""thanks"".
I began to hate her very quickly, after all it only took one time opening one of these ""gifts"", which had for once been wrapped properly, in front of the main body of my friends on accident to drive them all away from any future parties. She was soon the only one ringing the door on my birthday, and my parents tried to compensate with increasingly expensive presents, even when the time they spent away in their offices, working the evenings away, made it very clear these presents were too much for our bank account to bare. I never saw her anywhere else though, thank God. She was never present at family reunions, never ready with gift in hand for Christmas. Her absence was not enough to avoid her presence though. Much a time a relative would come up to me and profusely apologize, as if they had inflicted this disease of a person upon me. The first Christmas after she first appeared, we had the entire family round at ours. I remember stumbling round the corner to find my dad speaking to his mother. Blessed with a slow growth, I could just slot easily behind a counter before I was noticed, not even having to bend to conceal the top of my head.
""She came this year."" His voice, having been carrying a festive joy the entire day, was laden with dread.
His mother, ""nana"" to me, just let out a breath which did not carry an inkling of surprise, a sigh you would release at a mild inconvenience like missing the bus, not at your grandson being handed a dead rodent at the dinner table.
""I thought we were fine: you said we were fine."" The accusatory tone of voice did not arise any opposition from my nan, just another a sigh.
She began to speak, getting out a syllable before I knocked the side of the counter, immediately making her stop. They called me out, each giving me a hug before sending me off to bed. I went back to perhaps hear more but the empty kitchen and missing car keys showed they had left the house.
Eventually, I moved out at 19, I had a stable job having avoided college and just going straight to a construction company based near the coast, and so with some savings to back my measly pay check I moved out of the entire area and left to go South. I still live in the flat to this day, I'm writing this from my bed on a shitty Chromebook.

But when I moved out, she followed. I will not deny that I did let her scare me, turning down a much better job where I could have remained with my parents in my home town so that I could avoid her. I did think I had done so when, on my 20th birthday, I returned to my apartment after spending the day out in the streets with friends from work to find no one at my door and my flat empty. The sigh that escaped me after a quick search was ridden with such a powerful relief I was almost euphoric. Almost.
For when my flat door creaked open and the footsteps behind me trudged to the table behind the sofa, I found myself so terrified I could barely move. I turned the TV off and allowed myself a few moments in the silence before I turned around, my heart beat so loud as it pulsed in an unnatural rhythm that it edged out the whir of the fridge and her breathing to be the loudest sound in the cramped space. I took my place at the table a few seconds, eyeing her with the most fury I could muster beneath my terrified expression. She hadn't even bothered to wrap the gift, yet some part of me found the scene comedically intimate. I was sat alone at the table with this freak, facing each other with the present sat between us, but to an outside eye it may just look like a mother gifting her child a present, not the ritual it was. I reached out, dragging the box towards me, eyeing the coppery stains it left on my brand new table as I brought it closer to me. I flipped open each flap, ready to see what she had brought me. It was almost a special occasion: my first time facing her alone, without my parents.
I brought out the clump of hair and some paste that had adorned the ball. It smelled horrible, the paste sticking to my fingers as I took it between my finger and thumb, clumps of dark patches left behind as I dropped it back into the box. It had gotten to the point I was well past gagging, yet the smell was still powerfully strong, a stink that lingered in the air as I closed the lid again. The flash of light glinting off a pleading eye showed that had been, maybe even still was, some poor animal.
""Thank you, Auntie.""
She nodded, acknowledging my thanks as she stood and turned to leave. She, too, was well past the flash of anger she tended to let slip, seemingly the only emotion she ever showed. As she approached the door, I leant back in my seat, happy it was over: but the pent up anger within me would not permit her to leave. I had opened my mouth, ready to yell her down as she left, but she didn't even need to turn to intimidate me out of it.
""See you next year."" The tone of my voice still carried my heavy resentment, a product of 9 years of agony.
She didn't even register me, not even a nod. Just pulling the door open in a rough motion before shutting it behind her and disappearing.

I had bought the gun the next day.
I didn't have a license and I'm sure the incensed look in my eyes when I first touched the steel would have waived off any sane seller.
Even then, it didn't take long before I found myself alone in some back alley, down one thousand dollars but the weight of the revolver in my hand was priceless. I had tucked it into my jacket pocket and made my way home, delight sitting on my face as I began to think about what I'd do the next year.

Now, if this had all stopped, then this would be a confession.
She had appeared at my door for my 21st birthday, which I'd spent at home, phone on silent as I turned the handgun over in my hands. I had turned down any chance to go out, not prepared to take the miniscule risk I missed her yearly visit. The ""gift"" in her hands was unusual this year: just an envelope with no apparent bulge or object inside bar some piece of paper. We sat down, my giddy expression not baiting any emotion out of her withered face, not even extending a hand to reel in the present to open it. Needless to say, she did not flinch either when I brought my shaky fingers to pull back and cock the pistol, even when the sound echoed out from beneath the table. In fact, when I brought the sights up to my right eye, I found myself shaking and not her. I didn't even steady my unwilling hand before I brought my finger down on the trigger, pausing briefly when it tensed before following through. The click as the pistol threw itself against me rang out alone for a second before the notorious pop of a gunshot screamed out, wrapping round the corners of the flat and consuming the space. Once I lifted my gaze to where she had been, her head leaning back at a queasy angle made it clear I had not missed. That or the blood that now settled into the table with the stains from last year.

I had scrubbed for a while before the momentous task of hiding what I had done subdued and drove me to the floor, sitting up against a wall still damp with blood as I let my breaths come hard and fast as the panic began to consume me. I don't remember how long I was there for, but I remember coming to, vision blurry as tears began to take form, yet I had suppressed my sobs and stood up. I looked at the corpse sat at my dining table, my tears drying up almost immediately: for there was not an inch of sorrow in my body for her, no I was just afraid of the ramifications of what I had done. The police would not understand what I had ridden the world of, they would only see my ""murder"" and I would be carted to jail. No matter how bad my life is right now, I wouldn't get locked up.

So I found myself in the dim parking lot, packing a garbage bag into my shit-box car, the limp deadweight that had burdened me down the stairs resting in my boot. I grimaced slightly as the bag came into impact with the hard plastic of the floor of the trunk, pus and some solution of brain and blood sloshing round the bag. The incriminating steel sat heavy in my jacket pocket, no longer a symbol of safety but a stain.
I drove for a few hours, after all a forest is very hard to come by in the middle of a damn city. I was by the side of the highway just as the sun was dipping down below the horizon, the dark now sweeping across the area the universe's gift to me as I erased its curse on me. No one saw me as I took the bag in my gloved hands, gun now tucked below my shirt in the waistline of my pants. God forbid someone had seen me: I was so damn scared I don't know what would have happened, whether I would have sat as a rabbit in headlights or whether I would find my hands bringing up the notch of the gun's sight to focus on another person's forehead. In my urgency, I hadn't brought a shovel or anything to make a dent in the ground dried by a criminally hot summer. Eventually, after stumbling far from my car I did find a river however, a dip with a large piece of wood showing it would be deep enough to consume the body of my ""aunt"". Two quick jerks of my arms and the gun and her body were sat on the river bed, the murky river waters concealing them hopefully for the rest of my life.

I returned home that night, scrubbing the stains from the white walls before turning my attention to the table, the wood having soaked in the blood for too long so it was left in the garbage outside in several pieces. I could live without a table.
The envelope sat alone on my sofa, a spot of maroon making the corner damp as I picked it up, now grinning as I ripped it open. She was dead, for crying out loud she could've gifted me a pipe bomb and I would not let my mood falter: she was gone, there was not much she could do now. I even let out a chuckle as I envisioned taking some cheesy note in my hands, ""I WILL BE BACK"" scrawled in something's blood on parchment paper. Yet my smile did falter as I took the letter of resignation in my hands. My thoughts were now a stream of curses, like a child who'd just discovered swearing, steadying my hand as it began to ever so slightly shake. The shaky ink, occasionally dipping in and out of visibility proved I was holding a photocopy of the original letter, and I was pretty damn sure where the real letter was.
That bitch. No way. No effing way.
A call to my company later, arguing with my overseer and even begging for a few minutes, I found myself jobless. I leaned against the wall, chuckling again but my fake joy as dry as my laugh as I remembered buying the gun. Even without shooting her, if I had opened that as she sat in arm's reach across the table no power on this Earth would have stopped me jumping across and strangling her with my bare hands. I had been responsible with my money mostly, and knew I could tide rent and maybe even enough food to eat once a day for 6 months but from there I was screwed. I turned over the thought of just going home over in my head but some determined part of me barked in opposition: I would not let her win, especially with her body already soaking in the bottom of a river.

I did find a job, not as good as the construction one though. I was not college-educated but far from stupid so I managed to pull a job as an assistant manager in a local fast-food place, having worked in the same chain when I was 16 back in my home town. It didn't pay great, especially for a flat in the center of the city but I lived. Rent was even seeming silly now: I worked so late to pull in extra cash that I barely saw my flat bar Sundays. Yeah she had done me pretty badly with losing me the job but I lived: my social life was down the drain but promises of ""rising up the ranks"" teased the idea that soon I would be bringing home enough to be able to go out. Then came my 22nd birthday.

I often marveled at how I'd gotten away with the ""murder"" but I didn't question it. If no one had found the body and if everyone had passed off the loud bangs in a not-so-great section of the city as ""the usual"" then I was happy and free from accusations. So when the doorbell rung on my 22nd, I wondered if there was even anything to get away with. Had I missed? My hand had been shaky, maybe she feigned death. I might have just nicked her cheek. That thought was quickly shut down as I recognised how silly that was: I had locked eyes with the gaping wound in her forehead after all. Seen the sinews twist and even the light peek out the other side.
I remembered the overwhelming relief as I opened the door and did not see anything. Not her mangy hair nor smelt her deathly scent: like the ash of a campfire sweeping up your nose. Then my eyes flicked down and traced the outline of the trash bag, the black material winking at me in the hallway light as it was adorned in a slimy outer layer. The shiver that ran up my spine was so powerful I felt my back contort slightly as my entire body flinched, the black that came sweeping in held at bay as I reached a hand to steady myself on the door frame. In my mind I begged and cried but I got no response to my desperate prayers. Her body still sat in the bag on my doorstep, her twisted limbs clear to see beneath the surface of the bag as it sat in clear view in the hallway. I quickly snapped to and guided the corpse into my flat with the my foot, closing the door as I began to choke on the fumes of rot and decomposition. Somehow, she was back, this time her dead body a sickly gift that I could not refuse for fear of what may happen. I was so consumed with terror that I did not consider returning the body to the river, for if she, no, for if it could do this, what would it do to me if I denied the present? The years of echoing ""thank you""s that clearly drew her ire meant I had to always accept. I could not, would not, satisfy her and refute her presents. I did not even try to fathom the consequences.
I returned from my trance and took the ""present"" in my arms, cradling it like a baby as I cracked open my dried lips.
""Thank you, Auntie. It's wonderful."" I said it as if I was whispering some statement of love, like a mother does to her new-born in her hands, head tilted so I was speaking into the unhearing ear of the corpse beneath the bin bag.
I shuffled over and entered a side room of mine, still full of boxes two years post moving into the apartment. I nudged each box with my toe until I felt a hollow interior, crouching to yank open the lid and dump the body into it, gagging as I finally felt the cold sludge dragged along from the river stick to my shirt and bare arms.
I closed the door, quickly brandishing the heaviest item I had, my wardrobe stuffed with unread books and dirty clothes, and placing it in front of the door. I showered with the door cracked open, a butchers knife sat in the sink, only one quick grab away so I could defend myself at the smallest sight of movement. I scrubbed until I was red and raw, the easing of the hot water now a barrage of needle points as the heat tortured my sensitive skin. I went to bed yet didn't even close my eyes, phone in hand as I tried to respond to texts and scroll to leak the corpse sitting in my spare room from my mind. Each ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY"" message from family or my handful of friends now a taunt, a jeer that left me gritting my teeth as I responded in each group-chat.

I didn't move out of the flat, God knows why, and the clear stink of death meant the chance I could ever have someone over was off the cards. I didn't want to hide the body again: I didn't want to return to the river, afraid of what I may see. After all, my gut was plagued with the sinking feeling she would just claw herself back to my doorstep.
I'm still here, the day after my 23rd birthday.
And I'm very afraid that I've messed up very, very badly if I'm honest with you.

Yesterday, so close to midnight that I was almost ready to breathe a sigh of relief, the doorbell rang again.
I had opened and upon facing thin air I dropped my gaze to the floor.
Flecks of blood had apparently not been washed away by the two years of being submerged, the muzzle still wore the blood of my aunt with a disgusting pride.
The gun was also covered in the same slimy residue.
I did not pick it up, in my frustration that had somehow consumed my fear, I closed the door. I sat with my hand on the door knob for a good minute before I twisted it open in a jerk of my wrist, now backpedalling from my previous decision. But I had already made my mind up. For the gun was no longer there, my rejection now sinking into the massive pit in my stomach. I had made a mistake, one I'm seeing the consequences of.
Know when I whirled round, choking on my terror, summoning some buried strength to throw the wardrobe aside and damn near pulling the spare room's door off its hinges, I got some idea of what I had done.
The box was empty bar the bag and the lingering smell, the ragged hole dug in the side of the bag leaving the hairs on neck pricked up.

I have not had a wink of sleep since and I'm afraid.
Everything I have done today has been against my will, I'm in a trance yet whatever has me in its hold has loosened its grip enough for me to get out my story.
I doubt I'll follow up or update.
Maybe I'll reply to the first few comments, your curiosities will be my concern for maybe an hour or two.
Yet the wrapping paper sat on the table around a ragged box, still empty, whispers what awaits me so clearly.
I do not know what my hands will put in there, whether I might find myself on the sidewalk strangling some poor rat to death to place within the giftbox or ripping out my hair and adorning it in sick.
But I do know I'll be going home. I haven't responded to my parents yet, and the increasing frequency of which my phone buzzes tells me they're very worried.
If they ever read this, which I doubt but this is worth saying: I love you mum and dad.
I know they will see me yet if I see them is questionable.
Maybe whatever clasps my body in its possession will let me look through my glassy eyes at my parents again.
I'm on my way home soon, my cousin's birthday party is only a week away now.

1lkzbc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menieres/comments/1lkzbc2/asshole_doc/,Asshole doc,"And asshole ENT (not asshole by my standards, asshole based on average google reviews) told me he’s “fairly an expert at determining Ménière’s disease “ and that I don’t have it.  In 2020 I saw a neurotologist who “suspects endolymphatic hydrops”

This is going to be a two part post.  First, I would like the meniere’s community to give me their opinion based on symptoms.  Especially you long timers who have been there done that for over a decade or more.  

Symptoms:
-three episodes of violent rotational vertigo “attacks”.  The first one and the worst of the three lasted for five days.  I could not ambulate to the toilet I could not shower. All I could do is sit in bed with my head straight towards the television.  On about the fifth or sixth day, I was able to, with a lot of uncertainty and vertigo, walk to the kitchen and get my own coffee.
-Other two episodes were weren’t as bad and only lasted an afternoon.  
-In between I have had dizziness little spins here and there usually a couple a day.  Lots of nausea.  Nausea is a constant companion.  CONSTANT.  it is ever present to a greater or lesser degree.
- Here is the big one.  Pressure in my right ear that comes and goes, but the worst of it is the roaring tinnitus.  When it starts, I’m done.  The frequency of certain people’s voices!  It feels like my whole head is being crushed in a vice.  It is very hard to explain to the lay person.  It’s roaring, sound is stifled and I experience an intense sound sensitivity that is unbelievable!  It is not just the ears. It is a whole head experience.  
-sometimes alongside the roaring tinnitus events, but can also be a standalone event, is this intense brain fog that feels like I’ve been hit in the head with a bat multiple times.  My eyes glaze over I can’t think, it is a very compromising experience. 
-my right ear always has some level of a fullness feeling.  Sounds can range from slightly muted to very muted, or like a tin can kind of.

I haven’t had a vertigo attack in a couple of years and I don’t have considerable hearing loss.  I do have minimal low frequency and high frequency hearing loss, Right side.

First VNG in 2018 said 42% vestibular weakness right side.  It was pretty obvious during the test how my right side did not respond to the test.  Now I have a new VNG that says normal?  Can someone please explain this to me my symptoms have not gotten better!!!!!!!

But the most annoying part is the ENT’s blunt diagnosis, he came into the room to evaluate the second VNG, never asked me ONE question, and didn’t allow me to speak a whole sentence.

Second part:

I have an application in for DISABILITY.  I also have spine and joint issues galore so I am not applying on Meniere’s alone. 

I found the disability lawyer running a scam.  He has his clients give their medical evidence documents by dropping them off at any of their office locations in person.  The front desk lady scans them and handed them back to you.  Circumstances out of my control, cause this lawyer to withdraw from my case and we are now at the ALJ hearing stage.  I contacted Social Security and ask them for my entire file.  What I found was the neurologists evidence was not submitted to Social Security.  I gave it to that law office three times and they never submitted it to SSA.  They also never gave the neurologists records that suggested meniere’s.

Have any of you one disability with Meniere’s  being part of your case?  And how did your attorney argue the disability in regard to Meniere’s?  When it came to the occupational expert, how did your attorney argue for you in relation to how Meniere’s affects your ability to do any type of work?

I just don’t see how any of us that have the kinds of symptoms that I have could effectively work and be productive for anyone let alone not being a liability for an injury lawsuit.  Most people don’t understand this disease and its symptoms, and the intolerance toward it from the employers that I did encounter before I was diagnosed and figured out what the hell was wrong with me are lucky they didn’t get sued.  Their behavior as an employer toward my condition was deplorable.  I filed an IRS complaint against one of them and won, it cost them tens of thousands in fines and fees, a small win.  

I am a pretty decent pro se representative, and I would like to know how your attorneys argued for your meniere’s disability.  I am going to represent myself.  I am particularly interested in any of your cases that were tried at the Supreme Court level and won.  And lawyer talk this is what we call caselaw, and it sets a precedent on how other judges must rule.  
I would be very grateful if any of you that one at the Supreme Court level would be willing to share your case numbers with me so that I can use your caselaw in my ALJ hearing.

So, that is all, LOL.  Sorry for the long post.  Tell me what you think about my diagnoses, and let me know if you have any input, experience, advice, or caselaw to share on the legal side.",2,1750942206.0,Menieres,1,1.0,False
1lkzadq,https://www.reddit.com/r/camping/comments/1lkzadq/was_it_an_animal/,Was it an animal?,"Hi! Camping in the White Mountains with just my 9 year old. We are at a family campground. 

I woke up last night around 1230am hearing lots of zippers and noises coming from right outside my tent. I thought maybe neighbors had moved in late but I heard no voices. I also heard no animal noises. It was too close for comfort, in my half asleep daze, I got a little freaked out. I waited until I heard someone/thing walk away into the woods to check things out. 

I was imagining my screen tent torn to shreds as I realized I left a soft cooler bag zipped with some dry pasta, jarred sauce, buns and my precious coffee beans out at the picnic table. My fault. I know. I thought I had put all things food related away.

Well, screen tent was perfectly intact. Zipped up. All neat. That bag inside, missing. I doubled checked my car. Not there. Nothing else touched. Nothing else out of place. Even the picnic table covers which are pretty loose, all untouched. I checked for bear scat this morning. I let the camp staff know and they seemed unfazed. 

So was it a person or an animal?!
If it was a person, hopefully they just needed the food more than me. If it was an animal, well it was very respectful, neat and also very good with zippers.

1lkza6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dhaka/comments/1lkza6l/learn_laugh_create_a_new_community_space_for_dhaka/,"Learn, Laugh, Create: A new Community Space for Dhaka?","Hey everyone!

I’ve been thinking about this for a while and wanted to share it here to see if others feel the same way.

I feel like there aren’t many casual, affordable activities in Dhaka where people can come together to learn something new, meet others, and just relax from the stress of work or life. Most of our options are usually going to a café or restaurant—and that’s about it. Other kinds of events are often too expensive or too formal.

So I was thinking—what if we create something ourselves?
A community space or casual group where anyone—students, working professionals, people at home—can join in for skill-based workshops or fun sessions like pottery, cooking, dancing, art, jewelry making, photography, coffee brewing, even silly dance-offs or creative writing. Something light, healing, and fun.

I really want this to be a community-driven project, so I’m not looking to make a profit—just to create a space where we can all learn something new and connect. If you know of any spaces that might be interested in hosting such events, or if you or someone you know would be interested in teaching a workshop, I’d love to hear from you!

Let’s see if we can make this happen together! Thanks so much!",5,1750942108.0,Dhaka,10,0.78,False
1lkza3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/HappeningInAtlanta/comments/1lkza3l/interesting_conversation_in_a_coffee_shop_about/,Interesting conversation in a coffee shop about 'Southern Company' & 'Georgia Power',"Looks like others are doing research on **Southern Company** & **Georgia Power** \-- this 'tidbit' below from a previously posted article titled, ""*California Reamin' - Deregulation and the Power Pirates*"" was being discussed by some **Georgia Power customers**' in a Dancing Goats coffee shop.

After reading the article and based on the info below, these customers feel that it's time for **Georgia Power customers** to start asking 'additional questions' at PSC 'rate hearings' -- starting with demanding that **Southern Company/Georgia Power** be more transparent with 'how much' and 'what' they are charging Georgia Power customers for - they don't want to be charged for trains filled with 'rocks' instead of 'coal' - see below:

\----------------------

""On April 10, 1989, Jacob ""Jake"" Horton, senior vice president of **Southern Company's** Gulf Power unit, boarded the company plane to confront his board of directors over the company's accounting games and **illegal payments** to local politicians. Minutes after takeoff, the plane exploded. Later that day, police received an anonymous call: ""You can stop investigating Gulf Power now.""

**The New World Business Order**

What about poor Jake? ""Looks like he saw no other way out,"" says former Southern chairman A. W. ""Bill"" Dahlberg of the airplane explosion. **A suicide?** Jake's brother doubts it: **He says Horton had planned to meet with the U.S. attorney in Atlanta.** Jake apparently had a lot to say about **Southern's charging consumers** for loads of 'coal' bought from an affiliated mining company. **At times the train cars were filled with ""rock"" instead of coal.**

Shortly after Horton's death, a grand jury in **Atlanta** was prepared to **indict Southern Company's Georgia** (Georgia Power) unit for the spare parts accounting manipulations. But, invoking a rarely used procedure under the federal racketeering statute, **Bush Sr.'s Justice Department overruled local prosecutors to quash the request for indictment**. The reason? Keeping hidden accounts in secret files and booking costs into the wrong accounts may be a bit unusual, and may have cost the public a bundle, but it was approved at each step by that upstanding auditing firm, **Arthur Andersen.**

Indeed they had. **I found one letter from Andersen** **coaching the power company executives** on how to wave a bookkeeping magic wand over the spare-parts records to make the problem disappear. I suggested at the time, ""Why not indict Andersen?"" and proposed a civil racketeering claim against the accounting giant, naming them as Southern's coconspirator. My suggestion, not surprisingly, was dismissed with a chuckle by lawyers who understood that politics trumps law. The signal from the Bush administration was clear enough: Hire Andersen, knead your account books like cookie dough, and get a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card.

Jake's death and the **failure to indict Southern Company** and **Arthur Andersen** in 1989 marked the radical turning point, albeit unseen at the time, in the way corporate America would do business-or, as it turned out, **fail to do business.""**

not because I’m ashamed,
but because some treasures
can’t survive daylight.

I wanted everything with you.

some twisted part of me
still whispers your name into the wind

## Implications for the Stock Price Story: On the Cusp of a Market Transformation

The narrative of aTyr Pharma, when deeply analyzed, is far more than a typical biotech story. It is a testament to the power of fundamental biological insight translated into a highly de-risked, yet still high-stakes, clinical program. The scientific development has been meticulous, moving from a groundbreaking hypothesis to specific mechanistic clarity, extensive preclinical validation, and robust early clinical signals that have been rigorously re-analyzed. The confidence levels I've assigned to each insight reflect the cumulative weight of this evidence.

What is truly ""amazing"" and ""special"" here is the potential validation of an entirely new class of therapeutics derived from nature's own, evolutionarily refined signaling molecules – the physiocrines. If Efzofitimod succeeds in Phase 3, it won't just be a win for sarcoidosis patients; it will be a resounding validation for the ""physiocrine"" concept, opening up a vast and unexplored therapeutic landscape. For the stock, it's a binary outcome driven by years of relentless scientific pursuit, poised to either unlock immense value or relegate a groundbreaking idea back to the drawing board. The current analyst consensus and the dramatically re-evaluated market potential suggest that a positive readout would not just move the stock, but fundamentally revalue the entire enterprise as a leader in a groundbreaking new therapeutic modality.

- **The ""Game-Changer"" Scenario (Positive Readout: 75-85% Probability):**
    - *Immediate Term (Days to Weeks):*  
      The stock price would likely experience an explosive, multi-hundred percent surge (e.g., 200-500%+). The market would rapidly re-rate the company, pricing in the high probability of regulatory approval and future commercialization. Short interest, which is often prevalent in small-cap biotechs, would be annihilated, leading to a significant short squeeze that could further amplify the price movement. This is the moment where the years of foundational research pay off in dramatic fashion, transforming Atyr into a major player.
    - *Medium Term (3-18 Months):*  
      The focus shifts rapidly to NDA/BLA (New Drug Application/Biologics License Application) submission, accelerated regulatory review, and robust pre-commercialization activities. Analyst price targets, already at an average of $20.35, would undergo a dramatic re-evaluation, potentially escalating to $50-$100+ per share, or even significantly higher. Valuation multiples would expand dramatically, reflecting the profound validation of a novel platform and significantly revised peak sales estimates. Given recent company analyses indicating upwards of 200,000 to 250,000 prevalent cases of pulmonary sarcoidosis in the United States alone, and a potential cost per patient upwards of $120,000 to $130,000+ annually, the implied peak sales for Efzofitimod in the US market could easily exceed $2.4 Billion to $3.2 Billion annually. Factoring in the global market, which is significantly larger and often conservatively estimated at 1.5-2x the US market for rare diseases, the peak sales potential could comfortably reach multiples of billions, potentially $5 Billion to $7 Billion or more annually. This is a dramatic upward revision from previously conservative estimates and represents a major catalyst, positioning Efzofitimod as a potential blockbuster. The company would likely become a prime target for strategic partnerships or even outright acquisition by larger pharmaceutical companies seeking novel biologics platforms in immunology and fibrosis, further driving valuation. Institutional ownership would dramatically increase, with hedge funds, mutual funds, and large asset managers piling into the stock. Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) would champion the new therapeutic class, further enhancing market acceptance and driving uptake in the medical community.
    - *Long Term (18+ Months):*  
      The stock's narrative would revolve around successful commercial launch, strong market penetration, and, crucially, the accelerated development and de-risking of ATYR2810 (NRP2 oncology) and the earlier pipeline assets (ATYR0101 for fibrosis, ATYR0750 for liver disorders). aTyr would be viewed as a leader in ""physiocrine"" therapeutics, with a validated approach to addressing multiple unmet medical needs across various diseases, fueling sustained growth and innovation. The proven concept would unlock significant capital for future development, creating a virtuous cycle of innovation and value creation across its diversified pipeline, further expanding the Total Addressable Market (TAM) beyond initial estimates and cementing its position as a truly innovative biotech.

- **The ""Re-evaluation"" Scenario (Negative Readout: 15-25% Probability):**
    - *Immediate Term (Days to Weeks):*  
      The stock would suffer a precipitous, catastrophic decline (e.g., 70-95% drop or more). The market would view the Phase 3 failure as a severe invalidation of the lead asset and, more broadly, a significant blow to the entire ""physiocrine"" hypothesis, regardless of earlier scientific insights. This would trigger widespread selling from institutional investors and significant shorting pressure, as confidence evaporates.
    - *Medium Term (3-18 Months):*  
      The company would face immense pressure to conserve cash, potentially leading to significant workforce reductions, a re-prioritization or complete halt of pipeline programs (even ATYR2810 could suffer from ""guilt by association,"" despite distinct mechanisms). Access to capital would become extremely challenging and highly dilutive, impacting the very ability to fund future research. Analyst coverage would dwindle, and price targets would plunge further into distressed territory, reflecting a severely distressed asset.
    - *Long Term (18+ Months):*  
      Survival would depend on compelling, accelerated data from the earlier-stage programs (ATYR2810, ATYR0101, ATYR0750) to salvage the platform's credibility. It would be a prolonged, uphill battle to regain investor confidence, necessitating significant time and capital to demonstrate an alternative path to value, a scenario with very low probability given the initial setback and the high stakes of a Phase 3 failure.

## Summary & Notes

If you’ve made it this far—respect. This was another deep one.

What I’ve just unpacked for you is one of the most structurally compelling scientific and clinical narratives you’re likely to have seen in small-cap biotech. Not because it’s flashy. But because it’s disciplined. aTyr’s journey maps to an organization that has done the hard, quiet work for decades—layering discoveries, locking in protections, and gradually surfacing assets in a way that aligns with clinical maturity and capital strategy.

I’ve looked at:
- A foundational scientific paradigm shift in ""Physiocrine"" biology, challenging established dogma.
- Precision engineering of Efzofitimod, a first-in-class biologic with a unique mechanism on myeloid cells.
- Robust preclinical validation across multiple ILD models, demonstrating both anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects.
- Compelling, statistically significant Phase 1b/2a clinical data and a clean safety profile, significantly de-risking the upcoming Phase 3 readout.
- Massive, expanded market potential for Efzofitimod, now estimated in the multi-billions annually.
- A diversified pipeline leveraging the core ""Physiocrine"" and NRP2 expertise into oncology and other fibrotic/inflammatory diseases, signaling significant latent value.

In my view, this isn't just a compelling drug story—it’s a platform lattice, and it’s one of the strongest arguments yet for taking the long view on $ATYR. The current average analyst price target of $20.35, coupled with the updated market opportunity, strongly hints at the immense upside potential.

With this, I’ve been thinking about natural ways that I increase my energy. My guess is I’m not the only one struggling to put a little pep in their step after daylight savings, so I wanted to share my tips with all of you.

6 Ways to Naturally Increase Your Energy

* Take advantage of longer days. Go for a walk after work instead of right inside and to the couch. Do you workout in the evening? Take it outside! Go for a run and use a bench in a park to get your box jumps on. Whatever you need to do to get outside, do it. The rays from the sun will give you that natural energy boost and help to improve your mood.
* Make sure you’re getting 7-8 hours of sleep. For me, this means setting a cut off time for electronics and having a book that I’m looking forward to reading. Right now I’m reading Balance Your Hormones Balance Your Life by Claudia Welch and I’m really excited to learn more about Ayurveda and Chinese medicine. Nerdy? Maybe! But I love learning more about holistic approaches to healing the body. Reading has always been my favorite way to wind down and having a book that I’m hooked into really helps me stick with my routine.
* Inversions. Getting upside down, whether you use a wall or are able to hold a handstand on your own, has been shown to decrease anxiety and improve moods. The increased blood flow to your brain flushes out the adrenal glands and creates more positive thought. Plus it’s just fun to get upside down. Remember it doesn’t have to be perfect, it’s just a nice break in your day.
* Diffuse energizing essential oils. This time of year, my lemon eucalyptus essential oil is my favorite. It’s light and citrusy, and gives me the mid-afternoon boost I need without more caffeine.
* Maca. Maca root is used by indigenous Andean societies as a source of nourishment and healing. Studies have shown its ability to combat fatigue, reduce stress, and aid in muscle recovery after a hard workout. One of my favorite smoothie combos is maca, vanilla protein powder, spinach, cinnamon roasted carrots (frozen), and almond milk. The maca makes it taste slightly nutty and brings out the sweetness in the carrots. Try it!
* Replace coffee with tea. I know this might seem a little counterintuitive because tea has less caffeine than coffee. While this may be true, the caffeine in tea releases more slowly than coffee and therefore doesn’t cause a caffeine crash. Yerba Mate, a drink that is very popular in South America, is similar to green tea. The difference is that it more benefits, like a higher polyphenol and antioxidant count, and more caffeine. If you’re looking to replace your coffee with tea, give this a try first!

1lkz4n7,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1lkz4n7/lada_questions/,LADA questions,"I am a recently diagnosed type two diabetic. Since September of last year I’ve been on two different prednisone 60 mg tapers over 14 days due to psoriasis outbreaks. Most recently in April and it ended on May 2. My fasting labs taken on June 2 showed a hemoglobin A1c of 11.5 and a fasting glucose of 387. I’ve lost 35 lbs since December with most of it being since April and while weight loss has slowed is still occurring at approximately 1/lb every week or two. When I saw my lab results I immediately started on a low-carb diet and by my follow up appointment with my provider on June 9 my fasting blood sugars had already gotten down to round 240 so I was started on a metformin 500 mg Titration of adding 500 mg every seven days and I’m currently taking 500 mg in the morning and at night. I know that I’m not at the full dosage yet, but I’m confused about my blood sugar levels. With this diet alone, I was able to drop my blood sugar significantly And have maintained a low carb semi keto diet ranging between 30 and 50 g per day, only 1-1 1/2 tbsp of refined sugar in my one cup coffee in the morning, any vegetables and fruit are low on the glycemic index/glycemic load with fruit being consumed no more than three times per week. I’ve been monitoring my blood sugar and ketones at least pre-meal during the week and on the weekends typically one and two hour post meal also. My blood sugar rarely rebounds to pre meal levels and my fasting blood sugars have been staying between 172-190 and my ketones between 0.3-0.4. I recognize isn’t high, but it’s not in what is typically seen in nutritional ketogenic state or seen in a Type 2. Ketones also stay elevated 2 hr post meal with a couple of times higher than 1.0-3.0, though that is an oddity. My BS tend to drop during the day but ketones are elevated both in the morning and at night. With my lowest being yesterday of 128 and my fasting BS being 190. I am doing Intermittent Fasting kind of because I don’t get hungry until 9-10 and dinner is normally eaten by 6 or 7. I’m wondering if I’m LADA instead of type 2. 

I don’t fit the typical LADA as I’m overweight and have had hyperlipidemia since childhood despite dietary change then. 

I also have a history of Juvenile Arthritis that resolved as a teenager and borderline ANA panels my whole life that they haven’t been able to say why. 

I was wondering how others who were diagnosed with LADA laters BS looked like? I know only labs can say for certain, but I’ve read cases where they were normal in the beginning, but later the antibodies showed up. I’m not trying to deny type 2 but rather trying to make sense of everything. I am concerned I’ll be brushed off and if I am LADA not receive the correct intervention.

My IBS started getting way worse this year though. Every single morning i am kneeling over in intense stomach pain, just crawlinf out of bed to take my fiber supplement, coffee and smoke cigarettes (the only 3 things that help me sh*t which is in turn the only thing that relieves the pain).

The thing is, i know my fucked up life habits and eating disorder are the things making it so bad. Let me explain. I only get hungry at night. This is because i have ARFID eating disorder and cant eat unless i am STARVING, so i usually dont start eating until about 7pm. But i dont get HUNGRY HUNGRY until 10 pm or 11. Then i eat a shit ton of bad food (500 grams of candy every night too). Then i fucking fall asleep within like an hour of eating and of course my body can’t properly digest that while im sleeping . So i wake up in AGONY. Stomach hurts so bad i can barely move. Every morning. The only thing that helps is shitting. I spend anywhere from 2-4 hours in this pain. And i have to shit 2-3 times before the pain goes away. But im constipated. 

I cant deal. Its so bad its taking over my life and I cant even leave the house until 4 hours after i wake up everyday due to it. Its affecting me almost more than my migraines which i never thought would be the case. The fiber supplement DOES help but it still takes hours to work through my system and help the constipation pass.

I know i have to just stop eating late at night and stop eating candy. That would probably eliminate the issue. But ive been in this cycle for months on months. 

Any tips? I also have hashimotos thyroiditis, hypermobility spectrum disorder, autism and adhd.

Long time/first time. Got a manuscript out with alpha readers now, so I'm doing all the query stuff and would really appreciate help on the whole process since I did not get a creative writing degree and have no real experience with this deal. 

Below is sort of my ""base"" query. I'm doing some big genre mixing, so I'll planned to play up certain aspects a bit more with different agents looking for that part of the secret sauce recipe. For example, not on here are the new weird, and cyber/diesel/steam-punk elements at all, since I see few agents asking for those, but I can get them in there for those that do. Also, some specifics, like this is specifically a folklore retelling of The Death of Koschei the Deathless, but since that's not commonly known tale, I will only expand on that specific with agents specifically looking for folklore retellings. If people have any thoughts on that approach, would appreciate them as well. 

Removed the details from the bio-paragraph, but would be curious if people think the bio-graph is even worth including since I have no traditional publishing experience. 

Anyway, the query. Thanks in advance for any help: 

With nothing but a few cups of coffee in his sour stomach, Mariusz Morewna finds himself putting together a (literal) deconstructed epic hero to defy a deathless wizard who just so happens to be his former lover. 

And even still, he knows Liberation Day can, and will, get much worse. 

Mariusz is a runner: part thief, part smuggler, and entirely broke. He lives in a world where magicks are commodified and extracted from the desperate. And he follows one rule: never work for a thunderbird. But when his thunderbird sister offers him quick coin to win a barrel of honey in a card game off a mage named Mirette, desperation wins out. 

As with all of Mariusz’s jobs, nothing is that easy. 

The con spirals into a quest, as that barrel contains a piece of Iltabtu, a sentient, gender-fluid willow tree chopped to pieces. Iltabtu’s epic fate is to imprison the continent’s most powerful wizard: Koshcheika. Wealthy inventor of a soul-draining magick, aspiring Empress and the woman who shattered Mariusz’s heart more thoroughly than he shattered hers. Now she’s achieved immortality and only a re-assembled Iltabtu can stop her from exploiting the population of the entire continent.

Between dodging assassins, surviving a toxic magick swamp and trying not to think about Koshcheika’s smile, Mariusz must deal with Iltabtu’s boundless optimism about their heroic destiny and Mirette’s penchant for disappearing and reappearing throughout the night. But when he discovers that Koshcheika’s immortality may have been achieved by hiding her death inside Mirette, the political becomes more personal than he can handle. 

Drawing from Slavic traditions and set in a world where magic and democracy are dying in equal measure, LIBERATION DAY is an 70,000 word fantasy noir for readers who enjoyed the cynical humor of THE BLACKTONGUE THIEF, the magic-as-exploitation of THE BONE SHARD DAUGHTER, and the gender-bent folklore retelling of SHE WHO BECAME THE SUN.

I buy the oat and almond barissimo creamers (usually vanilla, but the caramel almond is solid). I really like the creamer and I use it with home brewed and premade coffees. 

My issue is the friggin lid. I HATE its design. For whatever stupid reason it holds one big drop in the lid after you shake it. I've tried multiple ways to get the drop out before I use it, but nothing works and it always drips down the side as I close it and makes everything sticky! (I have big sensory issues with being sticky so this is especially irritating.)

It's a minor thing, but it starts my day less than smoothly and I am just really annoyed about it. 

If anyone has suggestions, wants to commiserate, or if you can recommend a creamer decanter of some kind that I can pour the open creamers into...that would be very welcome and appreciated!

Whether it’s tossing a lukewarm mug in your bag and praying it doesn’t ruin your laptop, or sipping from a lid that dribbles more than it pours, many of us have faced the frustrations of subpar designs.

For many, the **Zojirushi Stainless Steel Mug** stands out—praised for its absolutely leakproof flip lid, excellent heat retention (12+ hours hot), and solid stainless steel body. It's lightweight but tough, and the sealing mechanism holds up for years.

I’ve been thinking about this lately while sitting in traffic on I-35. The rail line that runs right through the heart of Kyle (and Buda) is the same Union Pacific line that goes all the way into downtown Austin. Has anyone ever seriously looked into using it for commuter rail?

Turns out, yes… kind of.

Back in 2003, a state rep actually proposed turning this line into a commuter rail route, noting it would be much cheaper than other options if Union Pacific would agree. And there were some studies in the 2000s that looked into connecting Kyle, Buda, and New Braunfels into Austin via rail. But they stalled out. The big reason? Union Pacific owns and actively runs freight on the line. No lease, no expiration. They’d have to voluntarily allow someone like CapMetro or a regional partner to share the tracks, and so far that hasn’t happened.

More recently, TxDOT documents have shown a proposed commuter rail stop in downtown Kyle. But nothing official has moved forward. CapMetro’s Project Connect doesn’t reach this far south, and Kyle isn’t part of CapMetro territory anyway (we opted out years ago).

So… what would it take?

The good news is, Kyle and Buda are growing fast, and South Austin (including places like Menchaca) is right in the middle. There are ways to start the conversation again. Here are some things I’ve learned that could help us push for something:
	•	CAMPO, the regional planning group that covers Travis and Hays Counties, could include this rail corridor in future studies or planning budgets. They take public comments and include reps from our area.
	•	Hays County and city governments (Kyle, Buda) could pass a joint resolution asking TxDOT and Union Pacific to revisit the idea of commuter access along the line.
	•	A new Regional Transit District (RTD) could even be formed just for this purpose. It would let Hays County cities pool resources and apply for funding or negotiate rail access without needing CapMetro.
	•	CapMetro could still be a partner, even if Kyle and Buda aren’t in the service area, especially if there’s grant money or political momentum behind it.

I’m just a regular commuter thinking out loud, but I know a lot of folks around here are feeling the same pain trying to get in and out of Austin.

Has anyone seen anything more recent from our local officials on this? Would love to hear thoughts or ideas on how we can bring this up to city council, the county, or even at a CAMPO meeting.

Just imagine… parking your car in downtown Kyle and riding a train straight into Austin while drinking your coffee.

1lkyqr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1lkyqr7/stranded/,STRANDED,"""Shit, did you remember to pack the bear spray?""  
  
Marcus Holbrook's question hung in the crisp Alaskan air like frozen breath as he adjusted the straps on his Gregory pack. 

The weight distribution felt off. 

Twenty-three years of backcountry experience told him something was wrong with how Dave had loaded their gear, but they were already eight miles into the Chugach range.  
  
Dave Chen fumbled through his hip belt pockets, producing a canister of Counter Assault. 

""Got mine. You?""  
  
""Yeah, somewhere."" Marcus scanned the ridgeline ahead. Late September meant the grizzlies were hyperphagic, gorging themselves stupid before winter. 

The dwarf birch had already turned crimson across the valley floor, and fresh snow dusted the peaks above treeline. 

""That traverse looks sketchy.""  
  
The outcrop jutted from the mountainside like a broken tooth, maybe forty feet of exposed granite with a narrow game trail scratched across its face. Below, nothing but air and angular talus for three hundred feet.  
  
""We could backtrack,"" 

Dave suggested, though his tone said he'd rather eat his own boot. They'd been planning this route to the remote Eklutna Glacier for six months. 

Dave had even taken time off from his surgical residency at Providence Alaska Medical Center, no small feat considering his attending was a legendary hardass.  
  
Marcus studied the traverse again. The rock looked solid enough, weathered but not friable. He'd done worse in the Tetons. ""Nah, we're good. Just watch that loose stuff on the left.""  
  
They'd met four years ago on a Search and Rescue call near Crow Pass. Some Instagram influencer had tried to ford Eagle River during spring runoff wearing nothing but Lululemon and optimism. 

Marcus had been volunteering with Alaska Mountain Rescue Group; Dave was the trauma resident who'd stabilized her in the field after the hypothermia set in. They'd bonded over shared disgust at tourist stupidity and discovered a mutual addiction to suffering in beautiful places.  
  
Marcus led out onto the traverse, testing each foothold. The granite felt reassuringly rough under his Sportiva Trangos. Behind him, Dave's breathing quickened. The doc was solid on technical rock, but exposure always made him twitchy.  
  
""Looking good,"" Marcus called back. ""Just keep three points of contact.""  
  
Fifteen feet out, the game trail narrowed to maybe eight inches. Marcus pressed his body against the rock face, shuffling sideways. His pack scraped against granite. A chunk of lichen flaked off and spiraled into the void.  
  
""How's it look?"" Dave's voice carried that forced calm he used when suturing particularly gnarly lacerations.  
  
""Bomber. Just don't look down.""  
  
Which was, of course, exactly when Marcus looked down.  
  
The talus field seemed to shift and swim three hundred feet below. Vertigo hit him like a sucker punch. His left foot slipped on a patch of verglas, that treacherous thin ice that forms when moisture freezes on rock. Time dilated. His brain processed the physics with crystalline clarity: momentum plus gravity plus forty-pound pack equals extremely bad day.  
  
His right hand clawed for purchase. Fingernails bent backward against granite. His left foot pedaled air. The pack's weight pulled him outward.  
  
""MARCUS!""  
  
Dave's scream dopplered past as Marcus pinwheeled through space. The world became a blur of sky, rock, sky, rock. His tactical brain noted absurdly specific details: a golden eagle riding thermals to the south, the exact shade of blue-white on a hanging glacier, Dave's horrified face peering over the edge.  
  
The first impact came at maybe twenty feet. His left hip glanced off a protruding ledge, spinning him backward. The second hit was worse. Both feet struck an angled slab simultaneously. 

The force traveled up his legs like twin lightning bolts. He felt more than heard the wet crunch of breaking bone, a sensation like stepping on rotten kindling.  
  
Then he was airborne again, cartwheeling through space in a grotesque parody of a gymnast's routine. The talus rushed up to meet him. His pack hit first, probably saving his life by absorbing some impact. His helmeted head snapped back. Stars exploded across his vision.  
  
When the world stopped moving, Marcus found himself sprawled across a jumble of angular granite blocks. His legs were twisted at angles that definitely weren't factory standard. Pain hadn't arrived yet; shock was still running interference. 

He could taste copper and smell his own piss.  
  
""Marcus! MARCUS!"" Dave's voice echoed off the cirque walls.  
  
Marcus tried to respond but only managed a wet cough. Blood spattered the granite. Fantastic. He catalogued sensations with the detached interest of someone watching a nature documentary. Probable concussion from the head snap. Ribs definitely broken on the left side; breathing felt like sucking air through a coffee stirrer. And his ankles...  
  
Christ, his ankles.  
  
The pain arrived then, a symphony of agony that started in his feet and crescendoed through his entire skeleton. Both ankles were comprehensively fucked. The left one bent inward at an unnatural angle, the foot rotated almost backward. The right wasn't much better. Even through his boots, he could see the deformity.  
  
""Don't move!"" Dave shouted. ""I'm coming down!""  
  
""No!"" Marcus managed to croak. ""Call... SAR...""  
  
Silence from above. Then: ""The satphone's in your pack!""  
  
Of course it was. They always put their emergency gear with whoever was leading. Standard protocol that now seemed monumentally stupid.  
  
Marcus heard scrambling on the traverse, loose rock clattering down. ""Dave, don't... don't be an idiot...""  
  
But Dave was already committed, practically running across the narrow ledge. Later, Marcus would wonder if his friend would have made it if he hadn't been panicking, hadn't been a trauma surgeon who knew exactly how bad bilateral ankle fractures could get in the backcountry.  
  
Dave's foot hit the same patch of verglas.  
  
Marcus watched his friend's expression shift from determination to surprise to terror in the space of a heartbeat. Dave's arms windmilled frantically. For a moment, he seemed to hover, suspended by pure will.  
  
Then gravity collected its due.  
  
Dave's fall was shorter but no less violent. He bounced off two ledges before landing in the talus field thirty feet from Marcus. The impact sounded like someone dropping a sack of meat from a loading dock.  
  
""Dave?"" Marcus's voice came out as a whisper.  
  
A groan answered him. Dave rolled onto his side, revealing a face painted with blood from a gash above his eyebrow. He pushed himself to sitting, favoring his left shoulder.  
  
""You okay?"" Marcus asked, which was possibly the stupidest question in the history of human communication.  
  
Dave crawled over, leaving a blood trail on the granite. His hands moved with practiced efficiency, checking Marcus's pupils, palpating his skull, running along his spine.  
  
""Don't move your head,"" Dave instructed, voice steadier now that he had a patient to focus on. ""Any numbness? Tingling?""  
  
""My feet are fucked, Dave.""  
  
""I know. Let me see."" Dave carefully unlaced Marcus's left boot. Even that gentle movement sent lightning through Marcus's nervous system. When Dave peeled back the sock, both men sucked in breath.  
  
The ankle looked like someone had stuffed a softball under the skin. Purple-black bruising was already spreading. Bone fragments tented the skin in two places. The foot hung at a ninety-degree angle to the leg.  
  
""Pilon fracture,"" Dave muttered. ""Probably bilateral. Tibial plafond is completely destroyed."" He moved to the right ankle, which wasn't much better. ""This one's dislocated too. Probably fractured talus, maybe calcaneus...""  
  
""English, Doc.""  
  
Dave met his eyes. ""Your ankles are fucked.""  
  
""Yeah, got that part."" Marcus tried to shift position and immediately regretted it. His ribs screamed protest. ""What about the satphone?""  
  
Dave glanced at Marcus's pack, which had somehow stayed attached despite the fall. He carefully worked it free, trying not to jostle the injuries. The main compartment was torn open. Gear had scattered across the talus: energy bars, water filter, first aid kit...  
  
And the shattered remains of their Iridium 9575.  
  
The satellite phone looked like someone had fed it through a wood chipper. The antenna was bent double, the screen spider-webbed, the battery compartment split open. Dave pressed the power button anyway. Nothing.  
  
""Fuck."" Dave's single word carried the weight of their situation. They were fifteen miles from the nearest trailhead, in a cirque that saw maybe a dozen visitors per year. No cell coverage for fifty miles. The nearest civilization was Eklutna Village, population 70.  
  
Marcus watched Dave's face cycle through the stages of grief at land speed. Denial: frantically pressing buttons on the broken phone. Anger: hurling a rock at the cliff face with a primal scream. Bargaining: checking his own pack for the cell phone they both knew wouldn't work here. Depression: slumping forward with his head in his hands.  
  
""Hey,"" Marcus said. ""We're not dead yet.""  
  
Dave laughed, a sound with no humor in it. ""You can't walk. Hell, you'll be lucky if you walk again period. I've got a separated shoulder and probable concussion. We're in grizzly country with no comms and nobody expecting us back for five days.""  
  
""So we're having a Tuesday in Alaska.""  
  
That got a real laugh. Dave started triage, operating on muscle memory and adrenaline. He splinted Marcus's ankles using trekking poles and duct tape, a field expedient solution that would have horrified his attending physicians. Marcus screamed twice and passed out once. When he came to, Dave was rigging a shelter using their rain flies and paracord.  
  
""How's the shoulder?"" Marcus asked through gritted teeth.  
  
""Separated AC joint. Grade 3 probably."" Dave demonstrated limited range of motion in his left arm. ""I can work with it.""  
  
They took inventory as the sun tracked toward the western peaks. Two sleeping bags, both torn but functional. Six days of food if they rationed. Water filter intact. First aid kit mostly scattered but recoverable. Bear spray times two. No working communications.  
  
""We need to talk about extraction,"" Dave said, breaking open a packet of ibuprofen. The standard 200mg tabs were a joke against their current pain levels, but it was what they had.  
  
Marcus dry-swallowed four tablets. ""Nobody's coming for five days minimum. Sarah thinks I'm in Denali doing guide recon."" His girlfriend was used to him disappearing into the wilderness. ""Your people?""  
  
""I told the hospital I was going backpacking. Didn't specify where."" Dave grimaced. ""Dr. Harrison is going to have my ass for missing rounds.""  
  
""Pretty sure that's the least of our problems.""  
  
As if to emphasize the point, a sound drifted across the cirque that raised every hair on Marcus's neck: the distinctive woof of a grizzly. Not close, but definitely interested.  
  
Dave immediately reached for the bear spray. ""How far?""  
  
Marcus tried to pinpoint the sound. Twenty-three years in Alaska had taught him to read the acoustic landscape. ""Maybe three hundred meters. Probably caught our scent.""  
  
They'd both bled considerably. In the backcountry, blood was a dinner bell.  
  
""Fire?"" Dave suggested.  
  
""Not above treeline. Nothing to burn."" The cirque was all rock and low alpine plants. ""We need to look bigger. Make noise.""  
  
For the next hour, they maintained a careful watch while Dave finished setting camp. The shelter was a masterpiece of field engineering: low profile to handle wind, angled to shed rain, with their packs positioned as barriers. He'd even managed to excavate a shallow depression to protect Marcus from the elements.  
  
The grizzly never showed, but they heard it twice more, circling their position. Testing.  
  
Night fell like a hammer in the Alaskan mountains. The temperature plummeted twenty degrees in as many minutes. Dave helped Marcus into his sleeping bag, a process that involved considerable swearing and a few tears. The ankle manipulation sent fresh waves of agony through Marcus's system.  
  
""I need to reduce these fractures,"" Dave said. ""The longer we wait, the worse the swelling gets.""  
  
""You ever set bilateral pilons in the field?""  
  
""There's a first time for everything.""  
  
""That's not reassuring, Doc.""  
  
Dave's headlamp illuminated his exhausted face. Blood had dried in rusty streams from the gash on his forehead. ""Look, I can try to reduce them now while you can still feel your feet, or we can wait until compartment syndrome sets in and you lose them anyway.""  
  
Compartment syndrome. When swelling cuts off blood flow to the extremities. Marcus had seen it in avalanche victims. The tissue death was irreversible.  
  
""Do it.""  
  
Dave raided both first aid kits, laying out their meager supplies. No morphine. No lidocaine. Just ibuprofen, a few benzos for altitude sickness, and Marcus's flask of Maker's Mark.  
  
""This is going to hurt,"" Dave warned.  
  
""No shit.""  
  
Marcus took a pull of whiskey that burned all the way down. Dave positioned himself at Marcus's left foot, studying the deformity. In the hospital, this would involve X-rays, anesthesia, a team of orthopedic specialists. Here, it was just Dave's hands and whatever gods looked after idiots in the mountains.  
  
""On three,"" Dave said. ""One... two...""  
  
He pulled on two.  
  
The pain was transcendent. Marcus's vision went white. He felt the bones grinding, tendons popping, the entire architecture of his ankle rearranging. His scream echoed off the cirque walls. Somewhere in the distance, a wolf answered.  
  
When Marcus's vision cleared, his foot was pointing the right direction. Mostly.  
  
""One down,"" Dave said shakily.  
  
The second ankle was worse. Dave had to pull twice to overcome the muscle spasms. Marcus bit through the leather of his belt. When it was over, he lay gasping like a landed fish while Dave retaped the splints.  
  
""We need antibiotics,"" Dave muttered. ""Those open fractures are going to get infected.""  
  
""We need a lot of things.""  
  
They huddled in their bags as the temperature continued dropping. Marcus shivered uncontrollably, shock and hypothermia tag-teaming his system. Dave pressed against him, sharing what warmth he could.  
  
""Tell me about Sarah,"" Dave said, trying to distract them both.  
  
""What about her?""  
  
""You guys serious?""  
  
Marcus considered. He'd been dating Sarah Koskinen for two years. She was a bush pilot out of Talkeetna, flew climbers into Denali. Tough as nails, beautiful in that understated Nordic way, and pathologically independent. ""I don't know. Maybe.""  
  
""That's a ringing endorsement.""  
  
""Says the guy who hasn't had a relationship last longer than a surgical rotation.""  
  
Dave chuckled. ""Fair point.""  
  
They talked through the night, voices creating a barrier against the darkness. Told stories about other epic failures in the mountains. Debated whether the Seahawks would ever not suck. Analyzed the metaphysical implications of breakfast burritos. Anything to avoid discussing the obvious: their odds of survival were dropping with every hour.  
  
Dawn came slowly, pale light creeping across the eastern peaks. Marcus hadn't slept. The pain was constant now, a full-body throb synchronized with his heartbeat. His ankles had swollen to twice their normal size despite the compression.  
  
Dave looked haggard. The blood on his face had dried to rusty brown. His left arm hung useless at his side.  
  
""Morning rounds,"" he said with forced cheer. ""How's the pain?""  
  
""Somewhere between stepping on Legos and being drawn and quartered.""  
  
""So improving.""  
  
Dave checked the splints, frowning at the swelling. The skin was tight and shiny, bruising spreading up both calves. ""We need to elevate these.""  
  
They spent the morning rigging a system to keep Marcus's legs raised. Dave scavenged their scattered gear, recovering most of the food and medical supplies. The satphone remained spectacularly dead.  
  
""I could hike out,"" Dave suggested over a breakfast of energy bars and instant coffee.  
  
""With a separated shoulder and concussion? Through grizzly country?"" Marcus shook his head. ""That's how we end up with two dead idiots instead of one.""  
  
""So what, we just wait?""  
  
""SAR will start looking when we don't check in. Five days.""  
  
""You could be septic in five days. Or hypothermic. Or..."" Dave gestured at the vast wilderness surrounding them. ""Eaten.""  
  
As if on cue, movement caught their peripheral vision. A grizzly sow emerged from behind a granite buttress two hundred meters away, followed by two cubs. Second-year cubs, maybe 150 pounds each. Big enough to be dangerous, small enough that mama would be psychotically protective.  
  
""Don't move,"" Marcus whispered.  
  
The sow raised her massive head, testing the wind. Even at distance, they could see the distinctive shoulder hump, the dished face. She huffed, a sound that carried clearly in the still air.  
  
Dave had the bear spray ready, though they both knew it was mostly psychological comfort at this range. The sow could cover two hundred meters in about fifteen seconds. The spray had an effective range of maybe thirty feet.  
  
The cubs play-fought, oblivious to the tension. Their mother watched them, then swung her head back toward the humans. She took two steps forward.  
  
Marcus felt his heart rate spike. Adrenaline was a hell of a painkiller; his ankles temporarily faded to background noise. ""Make yourself big. Noise.""  
  
They yelled simultaneously, Dave waving his good arm while Marcus threw rocks. The sow huffed again, gathering her cubs with a series of grunts. She gave them one last look that clearly communicated ""you're not worth it"" and ambled back the way she'd come.  
  
""Jesus,"" Dave breathed.  
  
""Welcome to Alaska.""  
  
The rest of the day passed in a blur of pain management and micro-logistics. Dave rationed their food and medications. They collected water from a seep in the rocks, purifying it with their filter. Every small task took three times longer with their injuries.  
  
By afternoon, Marcus was running a fever. The open fractures were already showing signs of infection despite Dave's efforts at field sanitation. Red streaks crept up from the wound sites.  
  
""This is bad,"" Dave said, no longer trying to sugarcoat. ""Without antibiotics...""  
  
""I know.""  
  
They'd both seen enough wilderness medicine to understand the progression. Infection. Sepsis. Organ failure. The body consuming itself in a futile fight against bacterial invasion.  
  
That night was worse than the first. Marcus's fever spiked to 103. He drifted in and out of consciousness, mumbling about Sarah, about climbs from decades past, about his father who'd died when Marcus was twelve. Dave stayed awake, monitoring his friend's vital signs with increasing alarm.  
  
The wolves came at midnight.  
  
Not the solo scout from the night before, but a pack. Five, maybe six animals materializing from the darkness like smoke. Their eyes reflected green in Dave's headlamp.  
  
""Marcus."" Dave shook his friend. ""Marcus, wake up.""  
  
Marcus surfaced from fevered dreams to see death arranged in a semicircle around their camp. The wolves were bigger than he'd expected, probably MacKenzie Valley wolves from interior. The alpha was massive, maybe 140 pounds of muscle and instinct.  
  
""They know we're hurt,"" Dave whispered.  
  
It was true. Predators could sense weakness like sharks scenting blood. Two injured humans were just another protein source.  
  
The alpha took a step forward, lips pulling back from impressive dentition. The other wolves flanked out, textbook pack hunting behavior.  
  
""Spray?"" Marcus croaked.  
  
""Got it."" Dave held a canister in each hand despite his bad shoulder. ""This is going to get sporty.""  
  
Marcus forced himself to sitting despite the screaming protest from his ribs. Movement was good. Movement suggested they weren't quite carrion yet.  
  
""Hey!"" he shouted, voice cracking. ""Back off!""  
  
The alpha tilted its head, evaluating. These humans were making noise but not running. Injured prey usually ran. This was outside normal parameters.  
  
Dave started singing, of all things. ""Sweet Caroline"" at maximum volume. The absurdity of it, Neil Diamond versus apex predators, made Marcus laugh despite everything.  
  
The wolves circled closer. Twenty feet now. Well within charge range.  
  
""When I say run,"" Dave muttered between verses, ""we're going to-""  
  
The alpha charged.  
  
One hundred forty pounds of evolutionary perfection launched forward. Dave triggered the bear spray, sending a cloud of capsaicin into the night. The wolf hit it head-on and veered off, sneezing and pawing at its face.  
  
The other wolves scattered, then regrouped. They'd learned. The next approach would be from multiple angles.  
  
""How much spray?"" Marcus asked.  
  
""Half a can. Maybe less.""  
  
Not enough. Not nearly enough.  
  
Marcus grabbed a trekking pole, using it as a crutch to lever himself upright. The pain was extraordinary, but adrenaline was a hell of a drug. He stood swaying, probably looking like the world's most pathetic scarecrow.  
  
""You crazy bastard,"" Dave said.  
  
""Crazy's all we got left.""  
  
The wolves circled again, more cautious now. The alpha's eyes streamed from the capsaicin, but its focus never wavered. These humans were acting wrong. Injured prey didn't stand and fight. But the pack was hungry, and winter was coming.  
  
""We need fire,"" Marcus said.  
  
""With what? There's nothing-"" Dave stopped. ""The whiskey.""  
  
Marcus's flask was still half full. Not much, but 90 proof alcohol would burn. Dave splashed it on a pile of energy bar wrappers and synthetic fabric torn from their destroyed packs. His lighter sparked once, twice...  
  
The makeshift torch flared to life. It wouldn't last long, but fire was humanity's oldest friend. The wolves immediately backed off, instincts older than memory taking over.  
  
""Yeah!"" Dave waved the burning fabric. ""How do you like that?""  
  
The alpha snarled but retreated. The pack melted back into darkness, conceding this round. They'd be back. Persistence hunting was their specialty. But for now, the weird bipeds had won.  
  
Marcus collapsed back to the ground, ankles shrieking. The adrenaline crash was brutal. His fever spiked higher, reality blurring at the edges.  
  
""Stay with me,"" Dave said, checking his pulse. ""Marcus, you need to stay awake.""  
  
But consciousness was a ship sailing away, and Marcus was too tired to swim after it.  
  
He dreamed of Sarah. They were flying her Super Cub over Denali, the mountain massive and implacable below. She was laughing at something he'd said, blonde hair escaping from her headset. The engine note changed, became growling, became...  
  
Marcus woke to sunlight and Dave shaking him frantically.  
  
""Thank Christ,"" Dave breathed. ""I thought...""  
  
""Still here."" Marcus's voice was a whisper. His throat felt like sandpaper. ""Barely.""  
  
""Your fever broke around dawn. I was about to start CPR just to have something to do.""  
  
Marcus tried to laugh but only managed a wheeze. Everything hurt. His ankles had swollen to the point where the skin looked ready to split. The infection was winning.  
  
""How long?"" he asked.  
  
Dave understood. ""We're on day three. Two more until someone misses us.""  
  
Two more days. Might as well be two years.  
  
They spent the morning in a pain-and-exhaustion fugue. Dave managed to trap a pika, the tiny rabbit-like creature providing maybe three ounces of meat. It tasted like survival.  
  
The wolves returned that afternoon, maintaining a respectful distance but clearly waiting. The grizzly family made another appearance. Ravens circled overhead, nature's cleanup crew anticipating a meal.  
  
""Starting to feel like a wildlife documentary,"" Dave observed. ""When Meals Go Wrong.""  
  
""Dibs on Morgan Freeman narrating my death.""  
  
""Screw that. If I'm dying, I want Samuel L. Jackson. 'These motherfucking wolves in these motherfucking mountains.'""  
  
They giggled like idiots, exhaustion and stress fracturing into hysterical humor. It felt good to laugh, even if it made Marcus's ribs scream.  
  
That night, the temperature dropped below freezing. Their sleeping bags were rated to 20 degrees, but that assumed full mobility and proper shelter. Dave had done his best, but the makeshift bivvy could only do so much against the Arctic wind screaming down from the north.  
  
Marcus shivered uncontrollably, his body burning precious calories trying to maintain core temperature. Hypothermia was winning the race against infection.  
  
""We're going to make it,"" Dave said, pressed against him for warmth.  
  
""Liar.""  
  
""Yeah, but I'm a good liar. Comes with the medical degree.""  
  
They talked about inconsequential things. Dave's plan to specialize in wilderness medicine. Marcus's dream of putting up a new route on Denali's Cassin Ridge. The best pizza in Anchorage (Moose's Tooth, no contest). Anything to keep their minds off the cold seeping into their bones.  
  
Dawn of day four arrived with fresh snowfall. Six inches of pristine white covered their camp, beautiful and deadly. The temperature had dropped another ten degrees.  
  
Marcus couldn't feel his feet anymore. That was either very bad (frostbite) or very, very bad (the infection had cut off circulation entirely). Dave's left arm had turned purple-black where the separation had damaged blood vessels.  
  
""I need to check something,"" Dave said. He dug through Marcus's pack with his good hand, throwing aside gear with increasing desperation. ""I know I saw...""  
  
He pulled out a stuff sack, triumphant. Inside was Marcus's emergency bivvy from his glacier travel kit. The one he'd meant to remove after his last Denali trip but forgotten.  
  
And inside that...  
  
""No fucking way,"" Marcus breathed.  
  
A second satellite phone. Older model, a Iridium 9505A. The brick-sized unit Marcus had bought years ago as a backup and forgotten in the bottom of his glacier kit.  
  
Dave's hands shook as he pressed the power button. Nothing. The battery was probably dead after months of neglect.  
  
""The solar charger,"" Marcus said. ""In my repair kit.""  
  
Dave found the small solar panel, another piece of forgotten gear. His fingers were numb with cold as he connected the cables. The charging light blinked on.  
  
""How long?"" Marcus asked.  
  
""Maybe an hour for enough juice to make a call. If it even works.""  
  
They waited in tense silence as the weak autumn sun fed power to the ancient battery. The wolves watched from a nearby ridge. A golden eagle circled overhead. The mountains remained supremely indifferent to human drama.  
  
After forty minutes, Dave tried the phone. It powered on with a cheerful beep that sounded like angels singing.  
  
""Holy shit,"" Dave breathed. He dialed 911 with shaking fingers.  
  
Static. Then: ""911, what's your emergency?""  
  
Dave almost sobbed. ""This is Dr. David Chen. We're in the Chugach Mountains, approximately..."" He rattled off their GPS coordinates from muscle memory. ""Two injured hikers. One with bilateral ankle fractures and sepsis, one with separated shoulder and head trauma. We need immediate medevac.""  
  
The dispatcher was professionally calm. ""Sir, can you confirm your location?""  
  
Dave repeated the coordinates. ""We're in a cirque on the north side of Bashful Peak. My companion is critical. Septic shock imminent.""  
  
""Understand. We're dispatching Alaska Air Guard. Can you mark your position?""  
  
""Roger. We have orange bivy sacks for signaling.""  
  
""Estimated arrival ninety minutes. Can you hold that long?""  
  
Dave looked at Marcus, who was drifting in and out of consciousness. ""We'll hold.""  
  
The connection dropped, but the message was sent. Help was coming.  
  
The next ninety minutes were the longest of their lives. Dave spread out everything orange or reflective they had. Marcus fought to stay conscious, knowing that slipping away now would be giving up.  
  
They heard the helicopter before they saw it. The distinctive whop-whop-whop of a Pave Hawk echoing off the granite walls. Then it appeared, a beautiful olive-drab angel banking hard around Bashful Peak.  
  
The PJs were everything their reputation promised. Two pararescue jumpers fast-roped down while the helicopter orbited. Within minutes they had IVs running, real pain meds flowing, Marcus packaged for transport.  
  
""You guys picked a hell of a place to break,"" the lead PJ said, prepping the hoist. ""Another day and...""  
  
He didn't finish. Didn't need to.  
  
They lifted Marcus first, the rotor wash creating a localized blizzard. Dave went second, finally allowing himself to feel the full extent of his injuries as the adrenaline faded.  
  
As the helicopter banked toward Anchorage, Marcus caught a glimpse of their camp from above. It looked impossibly small, a tiny speck of human stubbornness in an ocean of indifferent wilderness. The wolves were already investigating the abandoned gear.  
  
""Hey,"" Dave said over the intercom. ""We made it.""  
  
Marcus managed a thumbs up with his IV hand. They'd made it. Broken, bloodied, and hypothermic, but alive. The mountains had thrown everything at them, and they'd survived through equal parts preparation, medical knowledge, and sheer stupid luck.  
  
That forgotten satellite phone. If Marcus had cleaned out his pack properly, they'd be statistics. If Dave had fallen a few feet differently, they'd both be dead. If the weather had been worse, if the wolves had been hungrier, if the infection had spread faster...  
  
But that was wilderness travel in Alaska. You stacked the deck in your favor as much as possible, then rolled the dice and hoped the house didn't win. This time, humanity had squeaked by.  
  
The Anchorage skyline appeared through the helicopter windows. Civilization. Hospitals. Antibiotics. Marcus looked at Dave, who was already arguing with the flight medic about treatment protocols.  
  
They'd have scars. Marcus would need multiple surgeries, months of rehab. Dave's shoulder would require reconstruction. But they'd heal. And eventually, inevitably, they'd go back to the mountains.  
  
Because that's what humans did. They survived impossible things through cooperation, preparation, and bloody-minded refusal to quit. They learned from their mistakes, updated their gear lists, and went back for more.

The helicopter descended toward Providence Hospital's landing pad. Sarah would be waiting, warned by the rescue coordinator. She'd probably punch Marcus first, then kiss him. Dave's attending would be furious about the missed shifts until he heard the story.  
  
They'd become another tale told around campfires and climbing shops. The two idiots who forgot to split up their emergency comms, remembered their backup phone, and lived to laugh about it. Their story would join the canon of near-misses that taught the next generation what not to do.  
  
Marcus felt the drugs pulling him under as they touched down. The last thing he saw was Dave giving him a shaky thumbs up as the trauma team swarmed the helicopter.  
  
They'd made it.  
  
Barely.  
  
But in the end, barely was enough.",20,1750940515.0,HFY,6,0.96,False

1lkymmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1lkymmz/what_am_i_supposed_to_do_now/,What am I supposed to do now?,"Found out last week (in an excruciating way) that my (49M) wife (36F) was sexting her ex and then took our son (5) to meet him for coffee. She even tried to get me to show up once I’d found out about the meeting and, like, shake his hand. Positively diabolical. 

There SO much more to it than that, but now… I’m about to end things. We’ve gone back and forth and round for round over the last few days… she says she still loves me but said she doesn’t think she can control herself and can’t say she won’t do it again. “Sorry. I’m just being honest. That’s what you want, right?”

She said, “it was never even about him. If it wasn’t him, it probably would have been someone else.”

So fine. I talked to a lawyer. I understand what my responsibilities will be (legally) and I plan to serve her. 

But I’ve basically been in committed relationships for nearly 30 years. First my ex and then, with a short gap, my current partner. I’ve never really been… alone. 

And I turn 50 in three months. 

So… for those who have… please offer some guidance: How DO you survive infidelity? Because based on the conversation we had last night, I’m done. My ONLY priority now is my son and not falling into greater depression than I already struggle with. 

Thanks. 

TL;DR - Wife of 9 years got caught cheating. Has seemingly no remorse. Now what?

1lkylom,https://i.redd.it/c206rrwuj99f1.jpeg,Laboratorio Olfattivo Amberbomb,"My second purchase from Laboratorio Olfattivo. I tried Amberbomb over the winter and really liked it. The name is misleading as I wouldn’t consider this an amber fragrance. It is a more of a leather and sandalwood “bomb” to my nose. In the opening I get a burst of berry, plum, slight coconut and coffee. Settles down into dry leather pretty fast. The floral notes of rose and jasmine slowly develop mixed with more leather and woods. The dry down is smoke! Woods, leather, slight amber mixed with vanilla, tonka, musk and smoke. Smells like a slightly sweet campfire. The sandalwood really rounds it out. Definitely one for the senses. The longevity is amazing. Feels very masculine. Probably better saved for cool autumn winter weather. In the heat of the summer the scent lands a little flat. My first purchase of Alambar by Laboratorio Olfattivo is much more what I consider a true amber scent. Both fragrances are potent and unique. I look forward to trying more scents from this brand.
