1gkz9mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1gkz9mg/wife_16_yrs_had_affair_but_refuses_to_admit/,Wife 16 yrs had affair but refuses to admit anything. What do I?,"I've read others posts and seen that there is some good advice on here from folks that have been through this already. I decided to join and tell my situation. I'll start like this... my wife and I have been married for 16 years.

First red flag, November 2018. During deer season my wife had started asking me nearly every time, exactly when I would be home and to please call her when I was leaving. She never did that before. Didn't think much about it at first.

Second red flag, 3rd week of February 2019. Out of the blue, one day when she came home from work, she told me about this cool new app where we could keep check on each other in case something happened, it was Life360. She assured me she had already checked it out and downloaded it on her phone and I should download it asap. I thought it was kinda strange, so I told her I would but I didn't. The next evening she asked if I had downloaded it yet, I replied no. She told me she could go do it for me. I told her I would in a minute. I still didn't. The next day, after work, she frustratingly asked me why I hadn't downloaded it yet. She pushingly insisted on showing me exactly how to download it right then and there, so I finally did.

Third red flag. Second week of March 2019. I hadnt really messed with the life360 app since the day I had installed it and created my account. So I decided to mess with the app. I opened it up and instantly noticed my wifes name wasn't on there. I thought it was strange, but didn't ask about it. One week after that, Life360 sent me an email syaing that my family group member xxxxxxx had been turned off their location and because of this they were unavailable. I didn't say anything to her about it.

Fourth red flag. Last week of March 2019. She locked her phone. For the first time ever. She said it was for work, but yet she kept it locked at home, no linger allowed the kids to play on it and didn't even tell me the password. She would say her pho3was messed up right now and it need to be fixed. She also informed me that her job was getting real busy and she may have to work extra hours or weekends in the future and that because she was paid salary, the extra hours wouldn't count and wouldn't show up on her paychecks.

Fifth red flag. First week of April 2019. It was the weekend and we were gonna grill outside. She volunteered to go get the groceries in town, roughly 7 minutes away. So she did. Nearly two hours later (1 hr 38 mins to be precise) she returned. Typically a trip like this would take 30 to 40 mins. I had called her after about 30 mins and she answered and said the store was packed. I called her at the 1 hour mark and she didn't answer. I called twice more about 15 mins apart and still no answer. Finally she called when she was nearly home and said she didn't hear the phone ringing. As Im carrying things in the house, shes walking in front of me and I notice her shirt is inside out. Now this was a sleeveless button up flannel with a collar. I immediately said, hey your shirts inside out, how'd that happen? She looked down, checked it quickly, turned beet red and mumbled something and ran to the bathoom. Oh and the meat she went to buy for us to grill, she forgot to buy. Instead, she bought a bunch of other random groceries that didn't even make a complete meal for a family of 5. Also, by this time she was always getting cash out of local atms in amounts of 60 to 200 dollars. She never did that, just always used her debit card.

Sixth red flag. Third week April 2019. She reminds me that she has to work some OT this coming Saturday, but won't be getting paid for it. So that Saturday morning I get up with her and have a morning. I notice she is definitely acting nervous. Won't sit down with me for coffee. Keeps getting up and down and wandering around. A thought popped in my mind and I went with it. I went in our bedroom and opened her underwear drawer and quickly took one photo of it. I feel like a scumbag for doing that. Anyway, come time for her to leave, I walk her out to the driveway, she's still acting very nervous. As we get to the vehicle she says she forgot to grab her pads and she thought she was gonna start soon. She asked if I'd crank her vehicle while she ran back in. So i did. She leff soon after, I went straight inside, opened her underwear drawer and took another photo. After briefly comparing the two photos, I observed that her pads were untouched and a pair of lace type panties were gone. I didn't say anything about it yet. She had to go in for 4 hours that Saturday she said. After she got home, that evening, I went to give her a hug and she kinda halfway hugged me and I could smell guys cologne on her shirt. Later that evening after she showered, 
I checked the laundry hamper. Her work clothes were there, her socks, but I didn't see any undies. I started pulling clothes out of the hamper and fpund those same lace panties at the bottom of the hamper, underneath everything else. She had deliberately shoved her undies to the very bottom of the hamper. I didn't say anything.
 
7th red flag. First week of May 2019. By this time I had really started watching for out of character things she would do. During the first week of May 2019, one particular day, as soon as she got home she went to the bathroom and said she was gonna shower. Five minutes later she came out and headed to the washing machine with the clothes she wore to work that day. The hamper was totally empty. I had already washed all the clothes that Saturday. I didn't say anything to her. She did the same thing the next two consecutive days. I didn't say anything. 

8th red flag.  Third week of May 2019. Things npw had started getting weird. She would give odd reasons why she had to go somewhere late and the kids couldn't go. She would start arguwith me over petty things snd then leave for anywhere from one to three hours. I decided to test her around this time. One evening about 5pm she said she was gonna run to Walmart.  I said I'd go with her. She said okay and went to the bedroom.  5 minutes later she came out and said she had a stomach ache and would go tomorrow. I said okay. At 11pm that night, she took a shower, got out, a few minutes later she came in the living room fully dressed and said she was just gonna run to Walmart now real quick. By this time I couldn't go because of our 3 children. She left at around 11:20pm, got home around 1:30am. 
By this time I was getting frustrated. I finally did ask if something was wrong, or if anything was going on. Any time I asked any questions, she would explode on me. Start cussing me, call me names, even in front of the kids. Then she would leave again. This went on for months like this all the way through March of 2020. Things started to seem to calm down and get better, then she would start acting like that again for a few months, then things would seem to calm down again. A vicious cycle of hell for me. We're still together right now but things are severely strained. It has been a nightmare for me because I know she was seeing someone else. Since 2019 she has gotten very secretive about everything she does. Now things are really strained again and she seems back to her old habits again. Im so tired. I just wish she would answer my questions. She refuses or says things like she doesn't remember. I don't know. Anyone deal with someone like this? Thanks.",1,1730901942.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

So here it goes:

When my boyfriend (30M) and I (27F) were about two months together (at that point, it was verbally stated by the both of us we are exclusive) he said he needed to see his ex to give her things she left at his apartment back. It was okay with me since I know they had an easy break-up and stayed on good terms. Also, he announced it well in advance which I appreciated.

At that time, I was at my parent's house since it was around Christmas and he was at his parent's house, around 200 km far away (we both usually live at another town, but went home for the holidays). I completely forgot about the ex until a month later I asked him if he ever saw her and he imidiately said yes and that he got a present from her. He said that he went to her apartment to give her her things back which was very weird to me because I thought they will meet at a cafe, have a coffee toghether and be on their way. Also, she asked him if he has a girlfriend and he said no because he didn't want to hurt her because they broke up only few weeks before we met. I wasn't thrilled with this, but I understood why. The present he got is a really big expensive picture from a (I guess) well-known local artist and my bf really likes art pieces. Also, it was a present for their anniversary which (maybe) never happened and also his birthday which was two months from then. I saw how happy he was, but it bothered me he was this happy and also that he denied me as a girlfriend. He told me his ex texted him a few times and he texted back, but in a obviously non-interested way until she finally got he wasn't interested.

I know a lot of people will say something happened then between them, but I completely trust him that it didn't and that he has no feelings for her. During their whole relationship which was about 1 year long, they never said »I love you« and he never had any intention of bringing their relationship to another level.

So, fast forward some time, I come to his parent's home and the picture is on the wall in his room (it wasn't before). His mom put it there. And without me saying anything, he told his mother jokingly  in front of me »put it somewhere else, \[I\] gets hartburn looking at this.« She said: »why did you even tell her where it's from?« I was really shocked she said that right in front of me, but I kept quiet. So it was left in that room for some time and I had to look at it every time I came there. Every day it bothered me more and more until one time I took it down and just put it down on the floor. He got the hint and put it in his parent's room and said he will gift it to his parents. I would rather he sold it, but he wouldn't even want to hear that. So okay, he gifted it to his parents. Everything was okay for some time and I even started to forget about that until one day I came at their house and the picture is hanging in the living room, right across the main entrance and is the first thing you see as you walk in. His mother asked me: »You don't mind me hanging that picure, do you? I just have nowhere else where I could hang it.« I anwered jokingly: »Only if you put a curtain on top of it.« You see, I usually don't feel confortable expressing how I feel and I am highly conflict avoidant and his mother is kind of confrontational and likes to fight. I never thought his mother doesn't like me up until then. If your son gifted you his picture bacause his girlfirend can't look at it, why would you put it where she sees it every time she walks in? And to my misfortune, because of some buissiness we had to do on the weekends, we had to stay at his paren't house every. Single. Weekend. The picture started to bother me again and it sparked a new fight with my boyfriend. I don't want to fight with him and I don't think he even talked with his ex anymore, and I trust him completely, but every time I even think about that picture, I'm irrationaly mad. I think his ex wouldn't have give him the picture if he said he had a gf, I believe it was her way of getting him back. I don't have a problem with any other presents from any of his exes he got while they were together. Only this fucking picture. And it's haunting me. I even dream about it. And then during the day I daydream about destoying it. One time we were walking down the street and we saw a picture in shopwindow and we both really liked it. Later, I wanted to come back and buy it for him, but I just couldn't because I was afraid of him not liking it as much as his ex's gift. It wasn't as big or as expensive and it was not painted by a famous painter so how could he like it as much?

I talked to my bf about it (again) and he said he will ask his mother to take it down, but that she probably will not want to do that. I said then that I cannot tell somebody what they will or will not hang on their walls, but I won't spend any time with them that I don't need to, especially in that living room where it's looking at me. Also, I told him he should've never accepted the gift and he got really mad at that.

Please tell me, am I overreacting regarding my feeling about that picture? Should I just leave everything as is and try to forget it, just bury it somewhere in my mind?

TL;DR bf got an expensive present from an ex, gifted it to his parents, now it hangs in the living room eating away my sanity.",2,1730901584.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

-I found ground coffee (Bru. And if I look at Amazon there’s also Narasu) - does it actually taste good and/or last long without going stale if it’s ground? 

-If I were to buy the beans and grind it myself: 

1. Where do I get the beans from? And the chicory? (I don’t think the Amazon products are reviewed enough times for me to feel comfortable buying.) Is buying it from India and bringing it over my only option? 

2. Any grinder reccs? (Also any reccs for the filter coffee equipment itself that’s not off Amazon?)

My friend (M) and I (F) have been friends for the past 8 years. We met at work and over the years we got closer and I’d like to say we have a pretty strong friendship. Over the course of our friendship, we would hang outside of work however never just us two, always with someone else. Anyways long story short there were feelings there for us both but when the pandemic hit, it complicated a lot of things. Also at the same time, he had lost 2 family members and grieved for a couple years. I was there for him and any time he needed a friend I was there. I feel that now he has made peace with the loss and transitioned now to a midlife crisis, which prevents him from going out and seeing the world, and also hanging out with people, including myself. Now while we never got the chance to hang out just us 2, and over the course of our friendship, every time I would ask to hang out, I would always be told no because it wasn’t a good day for what he was going through. While I never asked for this hangout to be anything more than just grabbing a coffee or going for a walk to spend time together, I feel the constant let down of not wanting to be hung out with. Yesterday, I decided to lay everything out on the line and say that I don’t know what this friendship is if we can’t see each other.

I know all y’all are complaining about Lucanis’ romance, and how bare bones it is. And I agree.

But the vibe I’m getting is that the writer or writers couldn’t really decide what kind of character he was supposed to be. He seems...inconsistent?

>!In a romance with Rook, it looks like they were TRYING to go for the professional, but a traumatized softy-underneath character who is afraid of being vulnerable and getting hurt, or hurting others due to his dangerous background. All about that ""slow burn"".Thus his standoffish-ness despite the flirts, his almost-kiss scene, and his final scene where he asks Rook to just comfort him with his voice. !<

>!But in the flirty banter with Neve, he’s very open, confident and suave- like this time, the writers are going for the romantic bad boy flirt with a sexy accent who will cook for you and also kill for you. It’s like, he was written from a completely different, almost objectifying perspective? !<

I wouldn’t be weirded out by it if it was >!revealed that his suave exterior is a front he plays as a mask, but that’s not the case with his relationship with Neve. If he was awkward and stilted at first with her like with Rook but gradually opened up to her, it’d feel much more natural and believable and in-character of a socially awkward, traumatized ""dumpster fire"" he is supposed to be.!<

My point is >!that he doesn't feel like the same character? Like, it's weirdly written and disjointed.!<

And of course, >!outside the romance Lucanis is honestly...not that interesting? He talks about coffee a lot. and cooking. His dynamic with spite isn't really explored that deeply. He comes across as 'haha look at this weird coffee man who really likes coffee, did we mention he likes coffee' and little else.!<

It's like they couldn't decide >!whether he was going to be the awkward one, the sexy one, or the funny weirdo one instead of blending all these traits together to create a consistent, believable character.!<

1gkz3ey,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beichtstuhl/comments/1gkz3ey/ich_gebe_lieber_emotionales_trinkgeld_statt_bare/,"Ich gebe lieber emotionales Trinkgeld, statt bare Münze!","Ich bin ein absoluter Verachter von der heutige Trinkgeld-Kultur. Wenn ich schon sehe, dass ich beim Coffee-to-Go auf dem Karten-Zahl-Gerät aktiv ein Trinkgeld (10%/20% oder der schwer zu treffende kleine Button ""0%"") wegklicken muss, ballt sich bei mir schon die Faust in der Tasche! 

Trinkgeld ist für mich etwas, was ich für guten Service ""freiwillig"" gebe und keineswegs Normalität! Daher muss ich gestehen, dass ich mir hier auch einige Angewohnheiten antrainiert habe, die manch einer als sündhaft ansehen könnte:

A) Gibt es wirklich mal einen guten Service, äußere ich gerne laut und vor allen, dass ich sehr zufrieden bin und hier ein üppiges Trinkgeld angebracht wäre - bewusst unerwähnt lasse ich, das ich mich hier verpflichte, etwas zu zahlen. Nur weil jemand etwas verdient hat, heißt es ja nicht, dass ""ich"" das zahlen muss! Sicher sind diejenigen dann auch enttäuscht wenn am Ende nichts oder, hab ich mal einen echt guten Tag, nur ein 50 Cent-Stück auf dem Tisch liegt, aber dann bin ich ja in der Regel schon weg - nur mein Lob bleibt ja! 

B) Vor allem in Cafés gibt es ja meist Trinkgeldbüchsen vorne an der Kasse. Ich sammele hier dann gerne mal zwei oder drei 1-2 Cent-Münzchen und hau die nach dem Bezahlen mit ordentlich Karacho in die Box sein, sodass es schön laut klimpert. Im Ergebnis zaubert ich damit auch ein Lächeln in die Gesichter der Barista - die wissen ja nicht, dass es nur 2-3 Cent waren, aber hey... beim guten Kaffee schenke ich auch gerne was Freude zurück!

I check absolutely all her social media accounts and those of close friends with unlocked profiles on Instagram. I go to her profile more than five times a day to see if she posted any new stories. I try to stop, but I can’t. I tell myself, “just this one last time.” I don’t even know if it’s jealousy or what exactly I feel about her. At some point, I started thinking it was because I feel better than she is—every time she posts a story, I find her really unattractive, and I wonder how my boyfriend could have been with her. It makes me a bit angry, and I know it sounds like a bad feeling to have, but in a way, it’s strangely satisfying. I don’t feel good doing it (when I think about it rationally and reflect on it), but at the same time, I just can’t stop.

I feel totally obsessed. I really want to stop, but I can't. I even got to the point of mast\*\*\*\*\*ing once while thinking about her (and I don't even find her attractive).

Honestly, quitting coffee was much easier than this. I don’t even have social media; I check Instagram through a profile-viewing site that doesn’t require an account. So, I search for the site, then type in her Instagram directly. It’s not something that shows up in my own social feed, you know? I clear my history constantly so that typing out the site becomes a more conscious process, and I try to avoid doing it. But I don’t always manage to (most of the time, I don’t).

Epic-sense that RTA supporter and Gear setting tool updated as below,

(sorry for my english...)

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, For those of you who don't know, let me introduce it briefly,

[www.epic-sense.com](http://www.epic-sense.com/) is,

1. RTA draft supporter

https://preview.redd.it/shgsjext8azd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=62abce15903608de4e63cebd499e6a3393faab9f

It is recommend synergy hero for your pick and counter hero for enemy's pick.

2. Hero info

https://preview.redd.it/6r029qgv8azd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9af3c21fe4684864ef6897f9474a82e7a3116b4b

You can see hero's average stat, main set, valid options and artifact info.

3. Gear settings

https://preview.redd.it/hxb18gxw8azd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=602204166b4fd03bfc7e83bddd718b4f9e6d0057

Once you select the equipment option, you can see which hero to give it to.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Now, This is recently updated in this this website.

# 1. The Gear enhance supporter page has been opened.

https://preview.redd.it/aq7cq3ei9azd1.png?width=2140&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c44757d27e9f43dff36277eb104841c0508d4bc

This is..

\- Can't I see the score separately just the valid option of the equipment?

\- Can't it be easy to see whether or not to add more reinforcement to the equipment between the 3rd and 12th round, i.e. the ambiguous section?

I made it because of this concern, and it is a tool that checks the score by entering only the 'valid option' of the equipment for each reinforcement section and tells you whether or not to strengthen it further.

I hope it will be helpful to Newbies who had the same concerns as me.



# 2. In ""Gear Setting"" page, I now recommend who I'll give to among the heroes I have.

https://preview.redd.it/swn50o6y9azd1.png?width=2119&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3bb7610cb79a149634c55efa4baa1fe7fcb1345

The 'Gear Setting' page is a tool that recommends which hero to give when you enter equipment options.

However, I've recommended who to give out of all heroes before, but if you click ""recommended from my heroes""

It recommends you to give the equipment to any of the heroes I have.



# 3. RTA supporter tool is updated.

\- I have changed the number of free-ban heroes to 1-4. When the free-ban characters are duplicated, you can adjust the number of ban heroes by reducing them.

\- The already selected hero has been changed to Unrecommended.

\- Heroes that aren't being used in RTA have been removed from the recommendation list so it's a little easier to watch.

\- Marked your opponent's character's ban rate. Just a probability marker of how many van's been hit and not a recommendation based on the overall combination, please use it for reference only. (Mobile will be updated later)



By the way, I think I'm coming in about 1dollar a day as advertising revenue.

It is still very, very deficit to operate, but there are more than 500 users who have signed up for membership, and I am receiving a lot of messages of support that I am using it well.

It's very rewarding, but it's still in the red... If you press the ad several times to pretend to be a mistake, it's very helpful!

Please give us a lot of feedback.

1gkytn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1gkytn7/dav_spoilers_all_long_read_veilguard_an_honest/,[DAV SPOILERS ALL] Long read - Veilguard - an honest review,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I completed Veilguard exactly an hour ago from the time I began drafting this post, and had such a strong reaction I felt I had to record my thoughts here, not least because nobody else in my offline life is a fan of the series and I have nobody else to vent to.

I'd like to include a TL;DR for this post, but my feelings toward this game and its implications for the franchise are so powerful, I don't think it would be possible to summarise them in a couple of lines without repeating what other fans and reviewers have already recorded, or resorting to a trite one-liner.

As a caveat, I'm a long-time, diehard fan of DA. I played DAO when it released in 2009 (I was still a kid at the time!) and immediately fell in love. It became, and remains, one of my two favourite games of all time, and began a 15 year fixation with the world and characters of Thedas. That said, and given my investment in this series, I don't pretend this review attempts to be objective, or see DAV through the eyes of a new player to the series.

But, without further ado, what follows is my review of Dragon Age: The Veilguard - the good, the bad, and the ugly.

\*\*\*\* SPOILERS BEGIN \*\*\*\*

Upon starting Veilguard, it's apparent this game is a highly polished effort. Despite some controversy over the visuals and art direction DAV took, the opening character creator and subsequent introductory sequence is a testament to BioWare's efforts to modernise the franchise's visuals, animations and mechanics. As has been widely remarked upon, options for customisation within the character creator are genuinely impressive, while both cutscenes and playable sections are smooth, and largely absent of the awkwardness which has characterised BioWare's animations in previous releases. Though there are some exceptions to this, such as characters smirking inappropriately during difficult conversations, this, on the whole, doesn't detract from the major leaps BioWare has made in bringing this franchise into the modern age.

The devs' attention to aesthetic detail is something which is equally evident in the design of the game's environments, every one of which is genuinely gorgeous and create a unique sense of place, always reflecting the pre-established and newly introduced lore relevant to each environment. I counted, perhaps, two or three recycled maps and settings during my playthrough, but these are disguised sufficiently well so as not to become wearisome in the manner Dragon Age II's infamous repeating caves did.

In regard to gameplay and mechanics, the refining process the game went through to make it a complete product on release is evident. I noticed no bugs or glitches during my playthrough, which is both impressive and rare for a product which possess the scale and breadth of content of Veilguard.

BioWare is to be commended for all the above, but these qualities do not, regrettably, save the game from its **significant** failures.

The key strength BioWare has rightly traded on throughout its history has been the depth and quality of its writing. With a couple of recent exceptions, the studio's ability to craft nuanced and emotionally provocative characters, sweeping narratives on a grand scale and intimate tales of personal conflict, and to integrate weighty and cerebrally demanding choices has been, for the most part, unparalleled in the industry. The quality of the plot and characters is surely, then, the factor which weighs most heavily when reviewing any BioWare game. With that standard in mind, it truly pains me to say this is, by some distance, the worst writing BioWare has ever produced.

The threat the game establishes in its opening sequences follows relatively neatly from the conclusion of Inquisition and Trespasser, but proceeds to move at such a breakneck pace that the player has little time to bed in and establish a meaningful connection to the characters or world with which we interact, including with the PC, Rook. Although we're offered a choice as to Rook's background, much of their character is predefined to an extent I haven't seen before in a BioWare protagonist. Rook's moral framework and worldview feels to have been decided by DAV's writers for us, taking away much of the pleasure of roleplaying, and making it difficult to decide what our character's motivations might be for taking certain actions. In almost every beat of DAV's plot, Rook's expressions of purpose are bland and pedestrian, and there is no option to acknowledge the highly complex and often personally, politically and socially painful decision-making which leadership demands, particularly when combatting a threat as great as the one DAV focusses around.

By contrast, The Warden in Origins was able to make choices so controversial they would test relationships with allies and companions, sometimes to breaking point: people we have fought alongside and perhaps grown to love could be forced into a moral quandary so great by our protagonist's actions that they could leave our side or, in extreme cases, decide we were a threat to their own worldview so great we needed to be eliminated by force. Similarly, Dragon Age II's companion interactions could, depending on player choice, be fraught with a grand scale of emotional, from deep friendship and romantic love, to deadly interpersonal conflict which could cause a decade-long companionship to end in an irreconcilable quarrel or, in the case of Anders, with the edge of a knife. Inquisition, again, gives the player the option to make monarchs rise or fall, imbues the protagonist with the power to pass the judgements which leadership demands, and shape a revived institution according to their morality, ambition and worldview.

What all the previous have in common, to varying degrees, is that the PC's actions in each of these decisions and subplots are explicable within the context in which they operate; the Warden can undertake morally questionable acts and justify them through the cruel necessity of combatting the Blight, Hawke could challenge and be challenged due to their proximity and the desperation of their situations, the Inquisitor can reason in various ways as to why they chose a certain path, be it pragmatism, ambition, or simple mercy.

This morally complex reasoning and interpersonal conflict is almost entirely absent from Veilguard. There is no option at almost any point in the game to challenge our companions, or indeed most other NPCs with the exception of the villains, on their words, actions or worldview and, by contrast, almost every action Rook takes will be met with a cascade of approval form companions which, so far as I could tell, has no effect whatsoever on how they interact throughout the course of the game. There were two scenes in DAV in which I noted companions bickering with one another; one of these conflicts was resolved in the very same scene and did not depend on interaction from Rook, while the other resolved itself without prompting some hours later. This conflict felt so obviously scripted and phoned in, with no consequence on the cohesiveness of our team, I was left wondering why it was included at all.

The above is underpinned by a general sense that Veilguard's writing, particularly it's dialogue, is cloyingly, suffocatingly **safe**. It's been remarked elsewhere and often that much of the game's dialogue feels crafted by an HR department, and while I don't want to comment on the specific political and social debates which motivate those comments, I will say there's an undeniably sterile, corporate and often therapised tone to Veilguard's writing. A particularly jarring example occurred when Rook was attempting to convince >!a spiritual remnant of Mythal to lend her aid in the fight against the game's villains!<, and appealed to her with an argument which rested on ""building a community that's tied together through shared bonds"", or words to this effect. The sheer blandness of this statement simply did not match the solemnity or grandeur of speech and manner which >!meeting a fragment of a murdered god!< would demand - instead, it felt that I was applying for a job at an NGO.

The game is littered with dialogue such as the above, as well as an excess of quirky and twee conversations and scenes which, though always a feature of the franchise, dominate Veilguard to a sickly sweet degree; indeed, Rook himself often resorts to quips during tense situations, which is especially frustrating when the dialogue wheel suggests a stoic or tough response will follow. This creates both a sense of tonal whiplash when contrasted against the stakes the characters face, and gives the impression of some (though not all) characters being written around recycled tropes deployed in previous instalments.

This lack of true originality or ability to respond appropriately or deeply to the events happening around Rook are borne out in other aspects of the game. Some scenes seem suspiciously similarly to those featured in other RPGs both produced by BioWare and other studios, sometimes appearing to have been ripped directly from them and repurposed to fit the Dragon Age setting. Further, companions, and Rook himself, will often repeat themselves, falling back on stock phrases or clobbering the player with a single aspect of their personality and giving the impression that they are defined by simply two or three superficial characteristics: Lucanis, for example, a character I was excited to discover prior to release, talked at length in at least four conversations about his love of coffee, yet I had no opportunity to explore in any depth his personal history, worldview, his attitude to his employment as an assassin or his questionable relationship with his family. This preference for the superficial over the substantial sadly defines swathes of characterisation in Veilguard.

The above does not apply universally, and there are characters which expand the horizons of the world of Dragon Age and recall the internal conflicts of mind and heart which have historically made BioWare games so appealing. Emmrich is such a character, and the companion I felt most challenged and impressed by, not least due to the fact Rook is able to express discomfort at Emmrich's occupation, leading to the two challenging each other's preconceptions (albeit, on Rook's part, in an often displeasingly squeamish manner). This depth, however, is unfortunately rare and despite marketing for DAV being centred around the companions, I found them on the whole to be the weakest cast of any DA game so far, with a few exceptions.

The often shallow characterisation of companions is mirrored by by a surprisingly diminutive sense of scale and purpose in the overall plot, which juxtaposes jarringly with the supremely high stakes our characters contend with. The allies Rook gathers to combat the apocalyptic nature of the threat in Veilguard occasionally left me questioning their competence and suitability for such an undertaking: rather than marshalling the armies of the nations of Southern Thedas, Rook relies on an occasionally ragtag band of of militias and paramilitary groups, whose role in main and side quests left me questioning whether they were really the best people for the job This often manifested in small but striking ways. In one companion quest, I cleared a warehouse in Minrathous of Venatori, and was assured by the Shadow Dragons they would protect the site against future incursions. Yet several hours later in the game, I returned to the same location to find it overrun with enemies yet again. If my allies can't be trusted to protect one warehouse, are they truly up to the task of defeating risen gods?

Although my interactions with more established factions such as the Grey Wardens and Mortalitasi felt meaningful, DAV is riddled with loose threads which are left hanging even by the games conclusion. To name but a few, we never establish why it was possible for >!Davrin to kill an archdemon without sacrificing his own life!<, previously a central aspect of established Warden lore - indeed, this mystery is acknowledge only in passing. The seismic and, literally, world-shattering revelations around the origin of the Blight, its impact on the Chantry's theology, the effect of the elven gods' return on Dalish and city elves, are either addressed merely in strangely casual and breezy dialogue, or not at all. There are yet stranger narrative choices surrounding the elevation of the Venatori and Qunari to the game's secondary villains, without any explanation of their motives beyond a nebulous assertion they desired ""power"". Why would Tevinter supremacists fight on behalf of ancient elves whose people they regard as fit only for slavery and sacrifice? What were the circumstances leading to the Antaam's rebellion and breakaway from the Qun? How has this impacted the war with Tevinter, the situation in Par Vollen? Why do the Antaam lapse from highly disciplined and cerebral soldiers to thuggish henchmen for a cause their culture teaches them to fear and abhor? The game's refusal to address this tells us that the writers don't care, so you shouldn't either. And yet, with three games, multiple non-game media releases, and 15 years of world-building behind us, it's impossible for any dedicated fan not to.

It felt, indeed, that Veilguard often treated the series' pre-existing lore as an inconvenience, an irritant which blockaded the smooth progression of a plot of whose compelling brilliance its writers seemed inexplicably convinced. Indeed, nowhere was this more apparent than the omission of any acknowledgment that events did actually take place in Thedas prior to the tail-end of Inquisition. This could have been a far richer and compelling narrative if player choice in previous games were integrated into the game, yet, far from this, we're informed via a letter that every location in which the previous games took place are effectively destroyed beyond repair, the characters within them presumably dead. Quite aside from the way this breaks the cardinal ""show, don't tell"" rule of good writing, I couldn't help but feel this was an act of, at best, laziness on the writers' part, and at worst, spite born from a desire to punish longtime fans for their misplaced investment in the world of Dragon Age pre-Veilguard, and wipe the slate clean for future instalments which will now, necessarily, be founded on what feels like a far shallower, poorer and less compelling world than the one established over the previous 15 years. This likewise applies to many returning characters, whose contributions to the plot feel shoehorned, not least because it's impossible to interrogate them as to their own pasts - it becomes difficult to connect meaningfully to a character when one receives the impression they don't know, or are unwilling to give away, anything about their own history, particularly given some, such as Morrigan, are talked of as being embroiled in some of the most significant events in Thedas of the previous 20, in-game years.

The above does not apply to every act and scene of the game. Interactions with Solas throughout the game were a reminder of the delicate and often beautiful character writing on which BioWare built its reputation. Events in Act 3, in which I was hit with twist after twist, devastating turn after devastating turn, elevated the game's coda to high drama which represented some of the most impactful and memorable writing and visual sequences I've seen in any video game, drawn together in an elegant and satisfying conclusion. It left me bitterly sad and disappointed this level of quality was reserved for a few hours at the game's conclusion however, and was realised only after dozens of hours of pablum.

Much more ink could be spilled on the manifold issues with Veilguard's writing at the micro level, but this post is already longer than intended, and there are yet further issues with the game that I'll attempt to summarise here. DAV's combat began as one of the game's highlights, a striking improvement from any previous instalment, and although it kept me relatively challenged throughout, enemies often felt repetitive, with a limited range of attacks which could be predicted ahead of time based on their type. There are similarly hordes of low level foes in this game, which will respawn in an area sometimes after simply visiting an adjoining room. There is no mechanic in Veilguard which acknowledges I've 'cleared out' an area of the map, and it sometimes felt as though the game assumed I wanted to fight as much as possible rather than being allowed to explore unfettered.

The game's combat is further defined by comprehensive skill trees which allow us to access unique, class-based abilities, which are engaging and fun, but absent from any part of our skill development is the option to select non-combat based skills. There are vanishingly few options in Veilguard to resolve 

A similar problem exists with the endless puzzles which litter the game, which are simultaneously so simple, ubiquitous and repetitive in form, they become a major source of tedium which serve no purpose except to impede progress and pad the game out with needless content. This was reflected in the game's quest design, which often had me run between points A - D, collecting various notes and trinkets, with a litany of side quests following a formula in which we were tasked with finding a missing person from an allied faction who, in almost every case, I was able quickly guess when the quest started my target would already be dead by the time I got to them. None of the side content in this game felt truly meaningful, and felt like a clumsily disguised repeat of the infamous fetch quests which bedevilled Inquisition. Much of this felt like it was a holdover from the game's day as a live service product, with simplistic and low-impact objectives which served only to punctuate a cavalcade of hack and slash combat.

Overall, then, I found Veilguard to be a baffling, shockingly disappointing, and sad entry to the series. I was stunned that this game was the end product of a ten year development cycle, and felt to a degree misled by much of the marketing and developer statements which preceded the game's release. BioWare's future remains uncertain, and so, necessarily, does Dragon Age's. If this is the series' swan song, I can't help but regard it as a tragically unworthy bookend to a series which has previously been so richly crafted, and which teemed with narrative potential which has gone unfulfilled. If, however, Veilguard is the stepping stone to a blank state worldstate in which the series undergoes an explicit reboot, I can't say with any confidence the game has left the franchise at a point that makes a retained investment appealing at all.",2,1730900684.0,dragonage,1,1.0,False

For a second, I wonder if I'm going insane. But insane people don't think that they are going insane, right? Everybody knows that. Is it natural to wonder if my existential dread is triggered by reliving a series of stupid mistakes I made when I first stepped into independence and adulthood? Or is it from repeating these same mistakes knowingly and willingly? It makes me wonder if I’m some sort of emotional masochist.

The inability to change myself, combined with anxiety and self-awareness, is a sinister mix and the root of my dread. Sometimes, I wonder if it’s easier to live in denial rather than be self-aware. It’s time to embrace my feelings instead of bottling them up and projecting a tough exterior. Maybe that’s the only way I can break out of this vicious cycle of fear and loathing.

I’m at that phase in life where all my friends have moved on or settled down with family and kids. Being single and pushing 30 is not an ideal place to meet new people or make new friends. I hope to find something real—could be a friend, could be something more. A deeper connection and meaningful conversation. Is that too much to ask for? I really hope not.

I’m on a fitness journey, low-key taking the winter arc seriously, and trying to bring some much-needed discipline into my life. Eating healthy, getting proper sleep, and consistently working out and hitting my goals for the past two months have been keeping me sane. If you’re on a similar journey, let’s keep each other accountable.

I absolutely love banter of all kinds, as long as no feelings are hurt. TV shows, music, and football are my escape from reality. I’m a decent cook and would love to share healthy recipes. I’m weirdly in love with all things black and dark—from my favorite color to how I prefer my coffee, and even the sort of humor I enjoy. If you can relate to me and you’re looking for something similar, let’s connect over DM and take it from there.

1gkyoqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/gastricsleeve/comments/1gkyoqu/approved_for_surgery_1_yr_ago_backed_out/,"Approved for surgery 1 yr ago, backed out, reconsidering","Post from 9/2023: Approved for VGS, having so much anxiety about it

I started the process in March and it took 6 months to complete the program to be approved for a surgery date (10 week program, blood work, follow up blood work, supplements, preop appointments, psych evaluation, etc.)

I was finally scheduled for surgery.

And on the morning of surgery, I cancelled. 

For 4 reasons:
- “I can do it myself, I’ve done it before, I know how, I just need to get back into that mode, get back into a routine, get back to that lifestyle”. 
- In my final pre-op prep group call, my program decided to use a new meeting platform which enabled people to have their cameras on. And for the first time I was able to see all these people in my class. They were all in such worse shape than me and much older. I’m talking 300+ lbs, in their 50s+, severe health issues, mobility issues. I just thought to myself I don’t belong here… I’m young, I’m healthy, I’m mobile, I’m capable…..I have no excuse. These people actually need it, I don’t, this is too drastic.
- The idea of foreign objects (staples) being in my body for life because I can’t control my mouth just feels insane. The fact that I’m resorting to mutilating an organ because I can’t have some discipline and self control.
- My family was pulling me in every direction. One person saying yes do it. Another saying no, you just need a routine. Another saying no, you can do it on your own, you’ve don’t it before. Another saying it’s up to you.

I keep mulling over all this in my head, trying to allow myself to proceed and get the surgery.

Me: 

34, female, 5’5”, start of surgery prep program: 213 lbs, currently 233 lbs (literally gained 20 lbs in 2 months because I had a food funeral and was nervous my insurance would deny me because I was under the required bmi so I purposely ate more to gain weight to ensure I’d be approved. It’s insane. And this was before I realized the surgery involved permanent staples).

A lifetime of obesity. Grew up on fast food and busy parents, lost and gained 100s of lbs, every diet you can think of and ones you’d never even fathom (think hcg diet, corn beef/acv/coffee diet, one pack of oatmeal a day diet, etc).

The only time I was ever an almost normal weight and healthy lifestyle was when I was 26; I started keto and weight lifting and dropped down to 160 lbs. I maintained this very healthy, active lifestyle for 2 years and did really well and felt great on it (my body really doesn’t do well with carbs) before ending up in an abusive marriage among other related stressors and losing grasp of my lifestyle. I ending up gaining 70 lbs in the span of 1 year.

I don’t know what replies I’m looking for from this post. Maybe I’m just venting. Or maybe I’m hoping someone will say just the right thing that will make me feel better and allow myself to do the surgery. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Update 10/5/24: My surgery date was scheduled for 9/11/24, so it’s been over a year since I opted not to go through with it. I’ve not made any drastic lifestyle or weight changes in this time, currently 210 lbs after losing the weight I gained from the post above. So essentially I’m right back where I started a year ago wait wise. My doctor has approved me to go on Ozempic, but I’m not seeing any effect from it. I suspect it’s because it’s being shipped to me and not staying at the optimal temperature, and potentially losing effect. i’m realizing that even on a great drug like Ozempic, it will be a lifetime thing as soon as I’m off it the food noise and insatiable cravings come back immediately. This realization that even Semaglutide is for life is making me rethink not doing the surgery. My qualms with it was how permanent it was, but here I am a year later, and I didn’t do it myself, I didn’t make any major life changes, and I’m still having to use the assistance of something that is lifelong. So my mind is starting to shift towards re-considering surgery. Both my brother and father did it in the past one to two years and have maintained their weight and happy with their decision. Sigh. I don’t know. ",1,1730900291.0,gastricsleeve,2,1.0,False

What do I do?,"I've read others posts and seen that there is some good advice on here from folks that have been through this already. I decided to join and tell my situation. I'll start like this... my wife and I have been married for 16 years.

First red flag, November 2018. During deer season my wife had started asking me nearly every time, exactly when I would be home and to please call her when I was leaving. She never did that before. Didn't think much about it at first.

Second red flag, 3rd week of February 2019. Out of the blue, one day when she came home from work, she told me about this cool new app where we could keep check on each other in case something happened, it was Life360. She assured me she had already checked it out and downloaded it on her phone and I should download it asap. I thought it was kinda strange, so I told her I would but I didn't. The next evening she asked if I had downloaded it yet, I replied no. She told me she could go do it for me. I told her I would in a minute. I still didn't. The next day, after work, she frustratingly asked me why I hadn't downloaded it yet. She pushingly insisted on showing me exactly how to download it right then and there, so I finally did.

Third red flag. Second week of March 2019. I hadnt really messed with the life360 app since the day I had installed it and created my account. So I decided to mess with the app. I opened it up and instantly noticed my wifes name wasn't on there. I thought it was strange, but didn't ask about it. One week after that, Life360 sent me an email syaing that my family group member xxxxxxx had been turned off their location and because of this they were unavailable. I didn't say anything to her about it.

Fourth red flag. Last week of March 2019. She locked her phone. For the first time ever. She said it was for work, but yet she kept it locked at home, no linger allowed the kids to play on it and didn't even tell me the password. She would say her pho3was messed up right now and it need to be fixed. She also informed me that her job was getting real busy and she may have to work extra hours or weekends in the future and that because she was paid salary, the extra hours wouldn't count and wouldn't show up on her paychecks.

Fifth red flag. First week of April 2019. It was the weekend and we were gonna grill outside. She volunteered to go get the groceries in town, roughly 7 minutes away. So she did. Nearly two hours later (1 hr 38 mins to be precise) she returned. Typically a trip like this would take 30 to 40 mins. I had called her after about 30 mins and she answered and said the store was packed. I called her at the 1 hour mark and she didn't answer. I called twice more about 15 mins apart and still no answer. Finally she called when she was nearly home and said she didn't hear the phone ringing. As Im carrying things in the house, shes walking in front of me and I notice her shirt is inside out. Now this was a sleeveless button up flannel with a collar. I immediately said, hey your shirts inside out, how'd that happen? She looked down, checked it quickly, turned beet red and mumbled something and ran to the bathoom. Oh and the meat she went to buy for us to grill, she forgot to buy. Instead, she bought a bunch of other random groceries that didn't even make a complete meal for a family of 5. Also, by this time she was always getting cash out of local atms in amounts of 60 to 200 dollars. She never did that, just always used her debit card.

Sixth red flag. Third week April 2019. She reminds me that she has to work some OT this coming Saturday, but won't be getting paid for it. So that Saturday morning I get up with her and have a morning. I notice she is definitely acting nervous. Won't sit down with me for coffee. Keeps getting up and down and wandering around. A thought popped in my mind and I went with it. I went in our bedroom and opened her underwear drawer and quickly took one photo of it. I feel like a scumbag for doing that. Anyway, come time for her to leave, I walk her out to the driveway, she's still acting very nervous. As we get to the vehicle she says she forgot to grab her pads and she thought she was gonna start soon. She asked if I'd crank her vehicle while she ran back in. So i did. She leff soon after, I went straight inside, opened her underwear drawer and took another photo. After briefly comparing the two photos, I observed that her pads were untouched and a pair of lace type panties were gone. I didn't say anything about it yet. She had to go in for 4 hours that Saturday she said. After she got home, that evening, I went to give her a hug and she kinda halfway hugged me and I could smell guys cologne on her shirt. Later that evening after she showered, 
I checked the laundry hamper. Her work clothes were there, her socks, but I didn't see any undies. I started pulling clothes out of the hamper and fpund those same lace panties at the bottom of the hamper, underneath everything else. She had deliberately shoved her undies to the very bottom of the hamper. I didn't say anything.
 
7th red flag. First week of May 2019. By this time I had really started watching for out of character things she would do. During the first week of May 2019, one particular day, as soon as she got home she went to the bathroom and said she was gonna shower. Five minutes later she came out and headed to the washing machine with the clothes she wore to work that day. The hamper was totally empty. I had already washed all the clothes that Saturday. I didn't say anything to her. She did the same thing the next two consecutive days. I didn't say anything. 

8th red flag.  Third week of May 2019. Things npw had started getting weird. She would give odd reasons why she had to go somewhere late and the kids couldn't go. She would start arguwith me over petty things snd then leave for anywhere from one to three hours. I decided to test her around this time. One evening about 5pm she said she was gonna run to Walmart.  I said I'd go with her. She said okay and went to the bedroom.  5 minutes later she came out and said she had a stomach ache and would go tomorrow. I said okay. At 11pm that night, she took a shower, got out, a few minutes later she came in the living room fully dressed and said she was just gonna run to Walmart now real quick. By this time I couldn't go because of our 3 children. She left at around 11:20pm, got home around 1:30am. 
By this time I was getting frustrated. I finally did ask if something was wrong, or if anything was going on. Any time I asked any questions, she would explode on me. Start cussing me, call me names, even in front of the kids. Then she would leave again. This went on for months like this all the way through March of 2020. Things started to seem to calm down and get better, then she would start acting like that again for a few months, then things would seem to calm down again. A vicious cycle of hell for me. We're still together right now but things are severely strained. It has been a nightmare for me because I know she was seeing someone else. Since 2019 she has gotten very secretive about everything she does. Now things are really strained again and she seems back tp her old habits again. Im so tired. I just wish she would answer my questions. She refuses or says things like she doesn't remember. I don't know. Anyone deal with someone like this? Thanks.",1,1730900233.0,AdulteryHate,0,1.0,False

With yesterday's large late-day bullish call volume and our current pre-market Donald Pump. We've got a lot to investigate with respect to our data and what it means for our price action in the near future.

But first, a word of measured clarification:

As we move out of our lower volatility, lower volume trading environment and into a time of exciting and more dynamic trading on GME, a lot of newly active or re-active investors and traders will happen upon our discussions here. I want to make it expressly clear that in talking about the options market, in analyzing options data, and what options traders are doing, I am not exhorting anyone to go out and dump money into options or to 'chase' upward volatility with calls especially.

\*\*\*Options contracts favor the DEALERS by conscious design. It is intended by the organizations who structure our equities markets that the majority of all contracts expire WORTHLESS. If you charge into buying calls without a soundly tested strategy, a system of iterative meta-games to optimally advantage yourself, you will LOSE MONEY. This is a statistical certainty.\*\*\*

If you need a quick tour of why understanding the options market is essential for making sense of our day-to-day price action, I recommend checking out my pinned posts here on reddit and on X. Nothing there will exhort you to actually buy options either.

Now, let's get to business.

**Price Movement Recap**

[Trading Day 11\/5 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/6fkchp46a9zd1.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa2eaa75aceac5892223fb75ad6722c318c31acd)

We began the day with the flattest, most gamma-pin-boring trading we have seen since that IV bottom pre-CATalyst. Midday, things were so sideways it was suspicious. Money seemed completely unwilling to do anything on the day. That is, until 2:40pm EST:

https://preview.redd.it/eposq5oba9zd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6f270357c1a422fd99323541476ecdad8ddd097

That's right, we got a block of 5,000 $25 Calls for 15 Nov 2024 hit the tape.

https://preview.redd.it/wnp8s509d9zd1.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&s=775c7b88e3640569f9f361cb98ee1e52c1778f94

As user Stonkdongo pointed out yesterday, the largest value share order on the day - lit or dark pool - hit the tape within three minutes for 24k shares (big enough to have an effect, but you can see how much more capital scales when it comes to options and MM hedging).

https://preview.redd.it/1wicgrsca9zd1.png?width=901&format=png&auto=webp&s=877d91ea91f9bdf9682438165cb1e58f13e6554b

Some additional $25c for Nov 15 came in on the back of some huge bullish flow which tipped the bull-bear premium balance heavily bullish. A couple whalish trades followed in the wake of this bullishness targeted at $25 and $30 Calls for January:

https://preview.redd.it/0lsfcp3td9zd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba01a5cb92fb6e6059dcc1051fe0c11dcfe9a039

Now, obviously the first thing that comes to mind when we see a block of 5,000 calls hit the tape is Keith. Block purchases of 5,000 calls are rare for GME. How rare? **This is only the 3rd time all year I have seen a 5,000 block of calls hit the tape**.

First time? - Keith's April Calls  
Second time? - The 5,000 Blocks of $23.5 Weeklies that hit the tape 30min before Keith dropped his Woody tweet on 9/6.  
Third time? - Yesterday

Again, obviously, we don't know that this was Keith for sure - just like we don't know it was him in September (or even April/May for that matter). We have an extra data point for the Spring - Keith's posting testimony - versus September 6 and yesterday. All of these trades, really, were different.

The April/May/June trade from Keith seems meant to reveal that GME's MMs sold Keith his OTM calls naked. The price didn't really move at all on any of the days Keith picked up his calls despite how much money he was spending and how much that should have stimulated MM gamma hedging. The result, when the stock went parabolic, was that it went BERZERK when MMs (probably Wolverine) realized they might get caught in another infinity gamma squeeze and bought to cover Keith's options.

Sept 6 was an options scalp - indeed the largest options scalp I've ever seen - for a $535 profit. Whoever it was either KNEW Keith was going to post on the day he did (either because he had advanced knowledge or was Keith himself) or simply planned to move the market much less he did and got extremely lucky with Keith's tweet.

Yesterday's trade, though a 5k block, was obviously smaller - at least initially - than the two 5k block trades we saw earlier this year. This trade, however, does not appear to be a scalp, despite its short-term nature (10DTE). Indeed, as we'll see in the OI data, it does not appear that this trader has exited his position, at least not fully:

https://preview.redd.it/xvojw1teh9zd1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=8987480f1cac1bfd226299c4d66c58017518a55a

As I said yesterday, though, we'll have to take a look at our OI changes to get a clearer sense of our probabilities.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

Let's start with the burning question: did yesterday's long whales for 11/15 Close? No:

[11\/15 OPEX OI Changes 11\/5-11\/6](https://preview.redd.it/05uw5urer9zd1.png?width=1062&format=png&auto=webp&s=625396543b676c3ff29ea299286699af43b21575)

Aside from some notable OI expansions down at $20, at $26, and at $30 (Skew: MID, ASK, ASK, respectively), our $25 Call OI for 11/15 expanded by over 9,000 Calls. With the BID volume on the day at 5,300 and the total ask volume over 13,700, at most 3,700 contracts opened yesterday at the ASK could have been closed by EOD. It is more likely at a fair amount of those contracts at the ASK represent buys to close (on instinct I bought to close all of my Short-IV trades like an hour before this happened).

[11\/8 OI Changes 11\/5-11\/6](https://preview.redd.it/xkzaba3mr9zd1.png?width=1062&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ee5fdf8c0e373362be27af5fd2c892a8a782d56)

We also had a significant number of new contracts opened heading into this week's expiry at all our whole dollar strikes especially, namely $22, $23, $24, and, yes, also $25, which now stands out as a considerably large weekly OI position at almost 18,000 open contracts. Put OI changes were laughably small. GME's unique IV characteristics and medium-term price outlook seem to make trades on the right side of the board utterly unpalatable - at least in comparison to call trades.

OI expansions were decidedly light across all other expiries - perhaps indicative of the lack of predictability at present with respect to the timing on impending dynamic moves with respect to the stock. In any case, the recent call trades opened at the ASK should be viewed as sentimentally bullish, but limited to an upward move in terms of price and/or IV developing within the next 10 calendar days.

Max Pain remains at $21 for this week and $20 for next week, though on such heavy call imbalances with many contracts ITM and no counterbalancing Puts, these values will start to have less meaning for predicting weekly closes in a clear bull trend.

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/ue5ptct6r9zd1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=27471b5a8ed20a572bddde6d3f2017fe93eecb78

The effect of all this new Call OI without negligible new Put OI is to send right back into the very bullish 1:4.5 Put/Call Gamma Exposure ratio on the order of what we saw the morning after National Cat Day (based on the revised historic value actually more bullish by a very small margin than Nat'l Cat Day).

https://preview.redd.it/2x8ztm74r9zd1.png?width=507&format=png&auto=webp&s=9305eb9e3cc7a1d672ba0b55fd3ebea4d212fac5

Now let's revisit our intraday structure - we see that familiar $22-$25 macro bracket replete with whole-dollar strike 'speed bumps' of high call gamma volatility suppression and lower, but still gamma positive half-dollar strikes. What is noticeable here is that new Call OI is slowly ratcheting up to new whole-dollar intervals. This week, we look to be moving past the $21-$22 range and mounting the $22-$23 sub-bracket. It is notable that, after $25, $23 is our strike with the highest net Call Gamma.

If we open above $23 (which it looks like we are likely to do as of premarket trading), we will look to establish $23 as a new near-term support toward the end of this week with concentrated bullish volume potentially pushing us up into the $24-25 sub-bracket, though breach-and-holds of $25 into Friday's expiry are not likely given the enormity of the $25 net gamma position as a volatility suppressor. MMs will pull out the stops to keep the $25 Calls from closing in the money - and will do so until they have enough time to draw premiums into Call Strikes above $25, as was the case in early July. IV traders will also happily sell calls into a spike toward $25 in volume given the continued reliability of that trade for many months now (yes, even during the July $29.99 spike, the $25 monthlies STILL closed OTM and WORTHLESS).

Despite the excitement here, we'll still likely need to see an upward grindy 'stenosis' on our price develop into and out of November OPEX with more consolidation at these elevated prices before things have a chance to cruise - again, barring some other informational or mechanical externality that forces dealers to accept the price hike whether they are properly hedged for it or not.

**Technicals**

[7\/16-10\/29 1-Day Aggregation w\/ Doodle Projection](https://preview.redd.it/1tzibrtu99zd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=e91f1d2cd48e7ebb5f6dacfd8ae30766f6582e1a)

[7\/16-11\/5 1-Day Aggregation Actual](https://preview.redd.it/erelg19ii9zd1.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=68051533278256392c76315f6adee031b43869cd)

With our $22 consolidation successful across four trading days and RSI neutral (=50) achieved, GME looks like its angling into a mini uptrend as we approach 11/15 OPEX. On the daily chart, the uptrend has plenty of room to develop, especially considering are relatively low-volume upward reversal yesterday (under 6mil shares on the day). If we take a look at the 4-hour chart we can see that a test of $25 this week would lead to an RSI overbought signal on that timeframe, however:

[7\/16-11\/5 4h Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/ko3ks2h9j9zd1.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c00c0c25d988bdfbe34258ae4321a9146919c6)

I could see an upward retrace of our 10/29 and 10/30 trading (up through $24.50) as a distinct possibility, especially given my comments yesterday and today on our MM gamma exposure structure. The overbought signal (on no news or other major system-reconfiguring externalities) would likely prompt traders to rotate once again to selling short term IV as the stock retraces to seek consolidation at higher levels (namely $23, instead of $22 this time around into November OPEX). Thursday's Fed funds announcement might serve as the excuse for some broader downside in the market to 'explain' such a retrace. We will have to take things day by day to see.

**IV Trends**

[10-Day Mean IV](https://preview.redd.it/lpn9rw5xp9zd1.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a9efa0014cb3ccf66085664673c9b45c5f455e0)

[IV Actual \(4hr Aggregation\) Schwab](https://preview.redd.it/e7n8phkzp9zd1.png?width=1487&format=png&auto=webp&s=450dc5efaa27308d31449c84943dd7d2d4fdb372)

As our price moves up, our IV moves up with it with only substantially low volume, flat trading conditions reliably grinding it down. A test of $25 (run into the $24.50 range) will bring a substantial IV spike - in fact, we will already spike based off of our premarket trading. If volume stays high, IV will remain elevated. If returns to earth for one reason or another IV will calm down, but likely now not back to the levels we saw pre- Cat Day. This upward IV grind related to volatility events and upward price action will eventually be picked up by the earnings anticipatory appreciation effect at T-14 Calendar days to the earnings report. I expect we see a return by the end of those two weeks to the 125%+ area.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

A spike up toward $24.50-$25 looks likely today based on yesterday's options orders and our pre-market activity. A breach of $25, however, is unlikely at this point. I expect a run-up today will likely be followed by a return to earth as traders sell IV on the tail of whatever JPOW says tomorrow and into a sub-$25 close this week. I suspect we might be able to anticipate consolidation at $23 heading into November OPEX and a closing of the major support-resistance gap in the weeks thereafter. It also looks potentially like Keith - or DFV copycats - are placing big, short term bets into November OPEX, given the surfacing of yesterday 5,000 Call Block. I'll be keeping my eye on the data.

The moral here? I'm staying patient, not chasing, not jumping to conclusions, staying vigilant with respect to the data.

All of this, however, does not affect my expectation - and what I suspect is a broader market expectation, including MMs themselves - that we start to see major bullish diversion into the December-January timeframe, likely on the heels of a late November, early December earnings IV appreciation, a solid Q3 earnings report (which Cohen might be suggesting will rock our sh\*t), and then the potential of a major SEC filing from Keith just before 12/20 OPEX to blow out the squashed options chain.

Cheers and good luck out there!

PS: Another day, another gesture of generosity from the community. Today I am happy to thank user 'driftthabimmer' for a whole week of coffees! I can't thank you enough - more than the beverages, for the support and showing of gratitude in this way. I started sharing these analyses back in June when I saw a wave of attempts trying to speculate blindly on our day-to-day price action. This community has highlighted so much of our current market situation, but I thought perhaps I could contribute at least in this one area and save even just one person the pain of loss, self-doubt, dejection, and 'ban-bets' that come with getting taken up by blind speculation. I wouldn't be here without all of your support. thank you.

For those of you who are on X, I have, at the encouragement of several users, decided to start crossposting there. These posts will be identical to those found here on Superstonk, so no need to leave the party here. However, just in case there are any 'issues' with my posts in the future, you'll be able to find each and every Open Interest Newsletter in the Articles tab of my profile. Open Interest will remain aimed toward the Superstonk - and GME shareholder - community first and foremost. So, rest assured, this will in no way affect my attention here.

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I rarely hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.

My cousin takes her son to a different activity every single day. Baby Spanish, sensory groups, messy play, Rhythm Time, etc. She also has a lot of other friends around her who also have babies and she always tells me through voice note whilst she’s driving how busy they are.

**Brew size**

Bialetti website just states the size of brew: 40ml for La Mokina vs 60ml for Moka 1 cup.

**Funnel size / amount of ground coffee**

But how is the funnel size? What I‘ve read is that Moka 1 cup fits around 8grams of grounds. For la Mokina I have no information except its coffee might be more like a ristretto. Ristretto would mean, that the same amount of ground is brewed with less water.

**Does anyone know how much ground fits the La Mokina?**

That way I would know wether it brews a smaller espresso (less water and less grounds) or a ristretto (less water but same amount of grounds)

I want to date, but I don’t always have enough money to go on dates or pay for them the way I think I should. I’m working on getting into business, so some months I’m doing okay, but other times it’s just me and my two dogs, and money’s tight. Even when I do have money, it’s usually for my own survival and for taking care of my dogs—sometimes, I feel like I’m just barely getting by.  

That said, I don’t want to go on dates if I can’t at least contribute or treat the person I’m with to something nice, like dinner or drinks. I’m looking for advice on what I could do. Are there girls out there who’d be okay with more budget-friendly dates, like something simple and not too expensive? Maybe coffee or a walk in the park?  

Also, if you’ve been in a similar situation, any suggestions on how to make dating work while building your way up financially? Or should I just forget about dating until I’m in a better spot? I’d love to hear what others think!",0,1730899078.0,dating,2,0.5,False

# Part 2: Diet

* Drink only water and herbal tea, no soda, sweet tea or juice. Unfortunately, as tasty as they (soda, sweet tea or juice) are, all three are terrible for your skin, weight, and organs. Instead, seltzer water with fruit marmalades is a fantastic alternative!
* Drink 8-12 8oz glasses of water per day. If you are more physically active, you definitely want to supplement your water with electrolytes!
* Cut out processed snacks, replace with whole foods (meats and grains), fruits and veggies.
   * Ladies, I know it's so much easier to reach for the processed food. To grab something quick that you can pop in the microwave or to stop at a fast food joint on the way home from work. Do not use convenience as a tool for long term planning. It is not always more beneficial in the long run. Sure, you can stop once in a blue moon to pick up a burger from In-and-Out. But you shouldn't have said burger once a week, or even every two weeks. Do not mistake convenience for long term benefit. Here is an article written by [The American Medical Association](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-ultraprocessed-foods) on the dangers of ultra processed food consumption. If you live in the USA, you know we are in a public health crisis in all things weight and health. It is no one's responsibility but your own to make sure you maintain discipline in quantity and quality of food.
   * COOK AT HOME - Cooking at home will save you money and allow you to control what you put into each meal. YOU control the amount of butter in that fettucine alfredo.
   * Consider alternatives. If you're like me and love pasta, consider switching to healthier alternatives. Zucchini can make a pretty deceptive angel hair. Chickpea pasta is gluten free for my celiac girlies out there. Research alternative ways to make the things you love to eat, and you will wipe away the guilt of having your favorite hearty meals.
   * Whole foods take longer for your body to digest, which means you stay fuller faster AND your body uses more energy to process it.
* Coffee AFTER eating and never on an empty stomach. This will assist with bloating and acid reflux.

 

If you are looking to specifically lose weight, you should make several considerations \[note- I am not a doctor or dietitian, you should consult with your doctor before making drastic dietary choices\]. When thinking about diet, you need to know and understand two things; 1. How the body transforms food into Energy and 2. How said Energy is stored for later use. 3. Changes in your metabolism and hormones.

1. How the Body Transforms Food into Energy
   1. Most of us are consuming far more carb based calories (especially simple carbs) than needed. You body turns these carbs into glucose, which is what you use to burn energy. If you do not burn all of the glucose prior to the next meal, it is transformed into glycogen and stored in your muscles or fat and stored as an energy deposits. The goal when eating (while yes, it is to enjoy the meal) is to consume foods high in nutritional value so your body WORKS to break them down.
      1. Doctors recommend that as much as 60% of your total daily calories should come from carbs based in fruits, vegetables, beans and unrefined grains. This means your bagel is out and a dense bean salad is IN.
      2. And guess what on the sugar front, only 10% of your daily calories should come from added sugars. These are your syrup sugars, candies, etc.
   2. How energy is stored for later use
      1. Glucose is the body's most preferred source of fuel. Stored glucose turns into glycogen and the body uses this as a reserve tank to fuel itself. Think about it as a smaller reserve tank while the free floating glucose is being used for active energy. Glycogen is GOOD! We want our bodies to have a good reserve of carbohydrates for energy. This is what keeps your blood sugar regulated and maintains an even supply of energy. However, your body can only store so much before this ""reserve tank is full"". This is when your glucose will turn into fat. If you are not using up the free floating glucose, your body will still store it. Unless your super meticulous in tracking your caloric intake and output (and I don't advise this, it's an easy road to an eating disorder), you will always be over or under in your consumption vs calorie spend. This is normal. The problem becomes when you are consuming 3500 calories a day and only doing 1800 calories of movement. In this scenario, you are consuming far more than your body needs. Your body has a minimum of calories needed to function, so staying within that threshold is key.
   3. Changes to your metabolism and hormones
      1. Many of you hear about PCOS, cortisol (the stress hormone), and hypothyroidism. These are hormone imbalances that affect your ability to lose weight. They CANNOT be solved alone and they cannot be self-diagnosed. You need to be tested to discover hormonal imbalances. I strongly suggest if you have put solid effort towards a proper diet and exercise plan, to see if you have a hormone imbalance.
      2. Hormone imbalances can be characterized by inability to lose weight, mood swings, severe acne, hair loss, depression, fatigue, and excess hair growth, especially on the face. You will know if you have a suspected imbalance if you develop a very puffy face and a ton of weight gain around your midsection.
   4. Dietary options
      1. Low Carb Diet – Not all carbohydrates are equal. Carbs are in everything you eat, but the carbs you get from an apple or quinoa are far different than the carbs from pasta and bread. Carbs are stored in our body as sugars, and when those sugars are not burned, they transform into fat. It is harder for the body to burn fat than sugars, so every time you eat, your body is actively burning what you eat. If you consume more calories than you are expelling (and majority of those calories are carbs), then your body will turn all of that sugar into stored fat for later use. [Healthline on Low Carb Diets](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-benefits-of-low-carb-ketogenic-diets)
      2. Pescatarian (Fish Based) Diet – Anyone who knows me, knows I LOVE fish. In fact, as I’m writing this paragraph, I’m eating [Yellow Tail Sushi](https://rbsushi.com/blog/yellowtail-sushi/). Fish is an amazing way to get in protein and healthy fats in. Plus, you can have a ton of variety and eat it more frequently than red meat.

1gky8q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gky8q2/i_fought_a_god_and_made_him_bleed/,I fought a god and made him bleed,"*Übermensch - Above or Beyond man*

To William Ernest Lex Jacobi. My Brother.

If you're reading this, I am in prison. An anonymous contact has sent you this letter and a lead-encased box. Here, they don't call me by name. My prisoner number is 181938. Sometimes, I wonder who allowed me to be alive today. Was it the judge, the law, the jury of my peers, destiny, God... or him?

We used to rule Manhattan, my brother. Our inherited wealth was enough to expand the empire that Father built. At first, I felt it was a shame that you chose science over our father's vision. But now, I am proud of you for getting that scholarship to a prestigious university. Since the day He took to the skies like a lightning bolt, our criminal empire has fallen. Gangs no longer run the streets and the Manhattan underworld is unrecognizable.

But my brother, this letter isn't about me brooding what I've lost. What if I told you that I made a god bleed?

You're not better than I am, brother. So, don't make sanctimonious statements against me after you read this. I have seen your work on those dishonest debtors. How you had this obsession of creating a perfect man or perhaps... you are trying to become one.

The bodies, the blood, the brains in the basement. Father was more merciful to them than you were.

I can almost see the look on your face, the flush of envy spreading as you read these words. Now everyone knows the perfect man exists—and it isn’t you. You, pale with that furious little tic in your jaw. Go on, let the hatred simmer, the anger gnaw at you. Maybe it’ll even give you the strength I didn’t have.

You might be wondering how I managed to get involved in a scuffle with a god. So let me take you back to a few months ago when our empire... scratch that. MY EMPIRE was at its peak. Father was long dead, rest his soul. The outer circle of our vast criminal network only knows me as Baal. I fashioned myself after the Canaanite god, exuding a sense of power and a little bit of flamboyance. Because who could judge us? Who could stop us?

There was this journalist... I couldn't remember her name. Was it Laurie? Lana? Lois? Such things slipped my mind, but it started with an L. 

So let's say, Miss L. 

She was incessant and annoying. The police on my payroll tried to pay her off to look the other way. But she refused. She went around digging where she shouldn't be. She wanted to be a ""hero"" who would expose Manhattan for the crime-ridden city it is. She knows this ""clean"" city is putting up a façade.

So I planned to kidnap her. She was attending a gala hosted by her workplace. For a woman as beautiful and feisty as Miss L, she was quite the loner. So, I had my men approach her and invite her to the car. We pulled out our knives in a subtle manner for extra persuasion. 

A nerdy, milquetoast man came close to spotting us. He said we were making the woman uncomfortable. I put my arm over his shoulder and told him I would buy him coffee for a talk. He took the bait, and my men took Miss L for a ride. It was a short talk for that nerd. He refused my fifty-grand offer to avoid trouble, but Miss L had already left him.

I took another car and went back home. Miss L had been waiting for me... in the basement, tied up and surrounded by my men like a feast of pigs. I gave her one last offer, but she spat in my face and refused.

So, I wanted to make an example of her. You were not around then, my brother. So, forgive me for rummaging through your laboratory. One of the oddities I found was a green scalpel. I could've picked a jackknife or any ordinary blade. But, I picked your favorite scalpel. I saw you cut through bones with it. 

Perfect!

As I was about to carve the fucking reporter like a pumpkin, he came.
He stood above me at the top of the stairs, Vasiliy’s limp body dangling from his grip. Vasiliy, a six-foot mountain man of fat and muscle, hung like a ragdoll, utterly helpless in the hands of this Übermensch.
My men didn’t hesitate; rifles snapped to shoulders, pistols aimed. There was gunfire. He just stood there as the bullets bounced off him like harmless raindrops. Then this demon, draped in shadow, laughed. He laughed, my brother, mocking me and my men.

Then his eyes flared. A deep crimson glow, like something straight from hell.

Our guns melted like slag, and we had to throw them away lest we burn our palms. The hiss and smell of burning metal filled the air as I stumbled back, bolting toward your laboratory.

I slammed the steel doors shut and ducked behind rows of your “Perfect Man” experiments—still, silent corpses on gurneys, their faces half-done, some mouths stitched shut. The air reeked of formaldehyde and something else, something rotten. You were never merciful, brother; I see that now, surrounded by the remnants of your “work.” I heard muffled screams through the door as he made his way with my men.

For a heartbeat, silence. 

Metal screeched as he tore through five hundred pounds of bulletproof steel. The door buckled like cardboard, and there he was. His demon eyes pierced through me, burning red-hot. He wasn’t here to speak; he was here to end me.

""Weapons, yes,"" I thought to myself.

My hand shot out, finding a lever on the wall, hoping for a weapon, anything. I yanked it down and the lights cut out. The room was black, except for those relentless, crimson eyes.

A surge of electricity flowed through the morgue. Then, there were sounds of stone scraping against flesh.

I awakened your ""Perfect Men.""

I heard the groans and mumbles of men supposed to be dead. Only the faint shuffle of feet and low, guttural groans grew louader as they closed in. The Übermensch was silent and still, a predator waiting. His glowing eyes were the only pinpoints of light.

His eyes seared through the blackness in a brutal crimson flare, just as the first Perfect Man lunged, fists swinging like hammers. Darkness closed again. Just shuffles and heavy breaths, until—flash! The Übermensch’s eyes lit up, fire flickering against clenched teeth and bone. They struck, shadows battering shadows, every blow shaking the walls.

The Übermensch twisted and dodged, but a punch caught his shoulder. It sent him skidding back. 

Another Perfect Man charged, tackling him like a freight train. They crashed to the concrete floor and rolled in the dark. The Perfect Men's fingers clawed at the Übermensch's throat. Their hands, straining with monstrous strength, tried to choke him.

Flash! His eyes blazed again, shooting searing red fire across the room. The Perfect Man choking the Übermensch staggered back, smoke rising from his face. Yet, he lunged forward, refusing to relent. Two others joined, attacking in tandem. The Übermensch swung his arm like they were made of steel. It cracked their undead ribs and flung one into the wall. But the others surged on, clawing and punching, using their bodies as weapons. The darkness swallowed them whole again, leaving only grunts and the clash of fists.

The room lit up with another fiery flash as the Übermensch's eyes ignited, and he released a burst of red flame. The Perfect Men twisted, some catching fire. One swung through the flames, his fist hitting the Übermensch's jaw. The impact echoed. For the first time, the Übermensch staggered, surprised but not in pain.

He snarled, grabbing the attacker by the head and twisting sharply. But as that Perfect Man fell, another one grabbed the Übermensch's arm, twisting it backward. Another slammed into his ribs with enough force to crack a stone. They fought like cornered beasts. Relentless and mindless, they were driven only by whatever spark of life animated them. The Übermensch's red eyes glowed even brighter, and he let out a laugh—a cruel, taunting sound—as he wrenched free, flinging two of them across the room in one motion.

The entire room is on fire now. The blaze should be enough to consume the Übermensch and the monsters you created, brother. I climbed up a ladder and escaped into the garden. But he was there, waiting for me.
His hands held the twisted, lifeless bodies of the Perfect Men. He scattered them across the floor like broken dolls.

""Where do you think you can go that I cannot follow you?"" said the Übermensch.

I was desperate, my brother.

What was the point of going up against someone you knew you could never escape, who could take you apart with just a thought?

This was the moment I fought a god.

Ever since I was a child, I saw that the world was ugly. So I hurt it. I hurt again, and again, and again. They begged, they screamed, they bled, they died. But this was different, he was not concerned about what I was going to do. And I understand that. I know it was useless. I know I was a dead man.

So I pulled out your green scalpel and I stabbed him in the eye. The blade pierced through with a sickening pop. The god screamed in pain. His voice tore through the air, a guttural, raw sound that almost destroyed my ears.

His hand shot up, gripping the scalpel, his fingers closing over it like a vise. With a twist, he crushed it into splinters, fragments of green metal scattering to the floor. I didn’t wait to see the rage in his one good eye—I spun around, legs pounding as I bolted for the back gate, heart hammering, his furious roars chasing me into the darkness.

I flung open the gate, breathless, only to freeze. He was already there, a shadow stretching across the ground in the faint light, blocking my escape.

He cocked his head, one hand resting loosely at his side, the other dripping blood from where the scalpel had bitten. His voice sliced through the silence, low and icy.

“Tell me—where haven’t I already followed you?”

He didn’t blink, his good eye fixed on me, gleaming with cold amusement, as if this was all just a game he was tired of winning.

""You’re already at my feet, defeated. You’ve surrendered,"" said the *superhuman*, each word precise as if the outcome had been decided long ago. ""You are already sitting in a jail cell. It’s over.""

There was no choice. I knelt, not because I wanted mercy, but because I knew—he had no mercy left to give. I waited for him to end it. But this god showed mercy after all. 

And so here I am, locked in this prison, watching as my empire burns to ashes outside these walls. I spent the next six months watching my gangs fall one by one to this superior man. While another three were spent communicating with my remaining contacts gathering shards of your broken scalpel and collecting what remains of your laboratory. They encased your equipment in a box of lead when they found out some of them were radioactive, especially your scalpel.

I hope you found this letter useful, brother.

Signed,

That of course makes me cough a bit too. Feels like something is stuck in there (but of course there isn’t). Or like an itch. I had a colonoscopy a few months back so they did an endoscopy as well and said I had GERD and Barrett’s esophagus (meaning I’ve had GERD for a while and never knew it - to me that means silent reflux not GERD but whatever, they insist it’s GERD). 

I’m on a PPI and famotidine. I’ve been on an acid feee diet for about six weeks now. I dropped coffee. Wedge pillow. No food before bed. Alkaline water. All that jazz. 

And I’m still clearing my throat nonstop (and coughing because of it). Still feels like there’s something in there. 

My question is….is my esophagus going to heal or will it be like this forever? The doc acts like it’s no big deal (the throat clearing) but it’s driving me INSANE. I imagine my esophagus is damaged from the acid (for who knows how long). I realize nobody can tell me if and when my esophagus will heal but curious if anyone has been through this and has any experience.

Sorry I have not been around lately!  I thought everything was just fine in my little workshop on the beach. The sun was shining, the waves were crashing, and my merry elves were busy crafting gifts as they always did. But I felt like something was off. Different. I’d catch them whispering when they thought I wasn’t around, and their usual smiles seemed just a tad forced. I kept brushing it off, thinking they were just tired from the holiday rush, but a nagging little voice told me I was missing something important. Still, I chalked it up to pre-holiday jitters. Oh, how wrong I was… how wrong… I was 😭. 🏖️ 🦞 got a rude awakening this week!  I will tell you more about it 
tomorrow. 

Part II
Since I knew the holiday rush was getting to everyone, the next morning, I decided to check in and lift their spirits, but the moment I entered the workshop, the usual hum of happy elves working away was gone. Instead, I was met with little picket signs! “Fair Seas, Fair Treats!” they read, and “Breaks for Beach Days!” My mouth dropped open. I asked Coral, my chief elf, what in the sandy depths was going on, and she hesitantly told me they were forming a union. A union! Can you believe it? They said they were overworked and didn’t have enough time to enjoy the beach they loved so much. I couldn’t believe my little elves were unhappy—wasn’t this work supposed to be a joy? My jaw dropped and knew a storm was coming and 🏖️ 🦞was going to get wet if she didn’t find an umbrella quick!  Man… retelling this story is stressful. More tomorrow!

Part III
That day, we sat down right in the sand with a list of demands. Now, I’ve faced stormy seas, but nothing prepared me for this: they wanted shorter hours, regular breaks, and comfier chairs to sit on. They told me they loved making gifts, but they were just too worn out to enjoy it anymore. I felt my shell heat up in embarrassment. I’d always thought the elves were happy because giving brought me so much joy. I couldn’t understand why they didn’t feel the same—wasn’t that the spirit of the season? But looking at their tired faces, I started to wonder if maybe I’d missed something important.
That night, I lay awake in my sandy little nook, thinking about everything the elves had said. Could it be that I’d taken their hard work for granted? All these years, I’d been caught up in the joy of delivering gifts and spreading cheer, never stopping to consider the toll it might be taking on them. My claws felt heavy as I realized I hadn’t truly understood what it means to give. Giving, I’d always thought, was about making others happy—but maybe, I was learning, it also means knowing when to give others a break. I knew then that things had to change.  But could I? Should I?  There was so much to ponder - I will give more deets on the morrow. 

Part IV
The next day, I gathered my little team together under the palm trees and told them I was ready to listen. I asked each elf to tell me what they truly needed to feel valued and happy in our sandy little world. One by one, they shared their thoughts—Coral talked about needing time for her family, Barnacle Bill said his back was sore from sitting on rough shells, and little Peri just wanted time to play in the tide pools. I felt a lump in my throat. How could I have missed all this? They weren’t just elves; they were my friends. I promised them things would be different.

With the elves’ suggestions, we created a whole new plan. I even rolled up my claws and helped make them proper shell chairs and put together a new schedule that gave everyone time for themselves. The workshop felt alive again—no longer a place of endless work, but a place of shared joy. They even started singing again, only this time it wasn’t just for me—it was for all of us. For the first time, I realized that real generosity didn’t mean giving all you had until you were worn out. Real generosity was about making sure everyone felt appreciated and understood.

With the changes in place, I set off along the beach with gifts for the other creatures, but something was different this time. I wasn’t just giving things—I was connecting with them. I asked each critter what would bring them the most happiness instead of assuming I knew. I realized that giving wasn’t just about the act itself; it was about seeing the other person’s heart. That night, back at the workshop, Coral patted my claw and said, “You did good, Sandy.” And you know, I think she was right. This year, I learned that being generous wasn’t about working tirelessly or expecting gratitude in return. It was about giving from a place of understanding, so that everyone could share in the joy together. And that, my friends, is a gift that never runs out.

Since I’m in town - I thought I would see who all have been good little boys and girls - and if they would like a 🎁 or would prefer to be pinched?

1gky1mw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee_Machines/comments/1gky1mw/experience_with_breville_grind_control_coffee/,Experience with Breville Grind Control Coffee Maker,"I wanted to give you a detailed rundown of my experience with the Breville Grind Control Coffee Maker, especially regarding its brewing performance.

Quick Look at Features: Integrated Adjustable Burr Grinder, Programmable Auto Start, LCD Display, Calibration Mode, Multiple Brew Size and Strength Options. 

[Check Latest Price Here](https://www.pricealert.me/goto/breville-B00VGGVQCI)

When I first started using the Breville Grind Control, I was really excited about the idea of having freshly ground coffee every morning. The built-in conical burr grinder is impressive and does deliver a rich, aromatic brew when everything is working smoothly. I appreciated being able to adjust the grind size and strength settings, which allowed me to customize each cup to my liking. Brewing a full pot was consistently strong and flavorful, which was perfect for those mornings when I needed multiple cups or had guests over.

However, I quickly ran into some frustrating issues with the single-serve brewing. Despite tweaking the settings and trying to calibrate the machine, my single cups often came out weaker than expected. It was disappointing because I was expecting the same quality as the full pot, but it just didn’t deliver. In contrast, when I brewed a full carafe, the coffee was robust and stayed hot longer than I anticipated. This was a stark difference compared to my old Capresso grind-and-brew machine, where the coffee maintained its temperature much better.

Another major hiccup was the inconsistency in the brewing process. There were multiple instances where the machine dispensed the wrong amount of water, leading to either overly strong or surprisingly weak coffee. On a few occasions, the machine stopped brewing before it had used all the water in the reservoir, leaving me with a partially filled carafe and a wasted batch of coffee. These interruptions were particularly annoying during busy mornings when I didn’t have time to troubleshoot.

The grinder itself also posed some problems. It would jam frequently, especially when I used darker roasts or finer grinds. This not only interrupted the brewing cycle but also required me to spend extra time cleaning and unclogging the chute to get things moving again. Additionally, I noticed that the grinder seemed to use an excessive amount of coffee beans for each brew, which was both costly and affected the flavor negatively. To cope with this, I ended up “tricking” the machine during calibration by entering incorrect values to reduce the amount of coffee it used, but this felt like a workaround rather than a proper solution.

Cleaning the machine was another area where I faced challenges. While some parts were easy to clean, the grinder and brewing assembly had multiple crevices that required thorough attention. It took more effort than I had anticipated to keep everything in good working order, especially with the frequent clogs and grind jams.

Durability has been a mixed bag as well. After about a year of use, I started noticing minor leaks and the motor wasn’t running as smoothly as it did initially. When I reached out to Breville’s customer service for support, the response was slower than I’d hoped, and it felt like older models didn’t get much attention.

Conclusion:

While the Breville Grind Control Coffee Maker offers some fantastic features like freshly ground coffee and brewing flexibility, the brewing inconsistencies and maintenance issues significantly impacted my overall experience. If you’re someone who values a perfectly consistent single cup every morning without much hassle, this might be a bit of a gamble. On the other hand, if you primarily brew full pots and don’t mind putting in a bit of extra effort to maintain the machine, it could still be a worthwhile option.

Just be prepared for some potential headaches with the brewing process and grinder maintenance. It’s a great machine when it works as intended, but the inconsistencies and extra maintenance can be a bit of a letdown over time. ",3,1730898367.0,Coffee_Machines,2,1.0,False

My longest fast was 21 days at home. It was hard, because 

* I usually had someone super demanding was around me  
* household stuff  
* the temptation of ordering food
* getting distracted from work from the things above which triggers emotional eating habits

**This time I wanted to do it different, easier, albeit more expensive.** I started a fast at my birthday and far away from home (a small island). I chose a hotel that offered a ""Buchinger Heilfasten"" fasting program where you can get your ""soup"", but you don't have to.   
  
There's a kinda voluntary daily meeting with the fasting leader and you should check in some time especially if you don't feel so well. You get a personal schedule including massages, peelings, body wraps. You can also use a small gym and pool which I did at the start.

**I brought my work with me:** computer and second screen (it's not a vacation) As having stuff to do that you like to do (!) also helps against boredom. Boredom is the biggest fasting killer.

I worked normally, sometimes I had super creative highs. Walked 10.000 to 30.000 steps everyday (sightseeing, beach and checking the supermarkets haha) and did some HIIT workouts in my hotel room every now and then.   
  
I started a short yoga routine and the morning and dry brushing my body for blood circulation. I am not esoteric or spiritual at all in any part of my life, but I've really started to enjoy doing these things – because I do like self-care.

After the first week I started to consume coffee again with a soy drink that has zero carbs. I noticed for my creative job I really thrive on caffeine and I'm not going to breaking that habit whilst working on 3 projects. Besides that drank a lot of water, mostly from herbal teas.

**I also took some electrolytes as recommended, but didn't go crazy about it.**

**Oh and I didn't step on the scale** once because I don't have one in my room. I can see the change. When I get home on saturday I think I'll weigh myself on sunday.

**Blood Ketones today 3.9 mmol/L**

I then want to follow a kinda Keto or Low Carb diet again, with more vegetables that I like.

I just wanted to let all the reddit fasters know how I am doing on a kinda long fast of 27 days :)

I had the foresight to take today off from work, so I've got time to process this. I haven't even made my coffee yet let alone done morning prayer.

But I am still reminded more so than ever of our baptismal covenant. These aren't words we mean when they are easy to fulfill. And that no matter what the situation is in the world, this is what we do.

I’m currently staying at my condo in qc and will be here for a month to focus on work (until nov 28 then I’ll be flying out) and I figured I might need some company while I’m here. It’s super lonely here HAHA

About me: I’m an introverted 5’9” chinito with glasses and a lot of tattoos. I regularly work out (run and gym), pleasing to the eyes I would say a 8-9/10. Am into cars, western series (binge-i ng breaking bad again), music taste is diverse but am listening to j-indie recently. I love dogs and coffee too!! I’m in the fulfillment industry :-)

About you: I like tall women; but please don’t be taller than me! I hope you also work out so we could be running buddies too. Being hygienic is a no brainer. Must be willing to swap pics!

Other preferences: chinita, nice thighs, wears glasses. Haha

Hit me up with a nice intro and let’s go from there!",1,1730897003.0,PHR4Rhookups,0,1.0,False

It lasts for about 1 second, with random intervals. I wouldn’t describe it as pain—just a weird feeling that comes and goes. I’ve noticed that stretching my arm can make it go away for a while. I tried deep breathing to see if it makes a difference, but it doesn’t seem to help.

A bit about me: I’m slightly overweight due to a mostly sedentary lifestyle (I spend a lot of time at the computer), but I eat healthy (no oil, no energy drinks, no coffee, no sodas). I don’t experience any exhaustion, breathing problems, or sweating. The only other symptom I’ve noticed is cold fingers at night, but I think that might be because it’s winter here.

Could this sensation be heart-related, or is it more likely something else?

\*\*people who have done above -i am dead sure they cant fail at all ,unless they havent gone through concepts on NMBES and UWorld properly\*\*-so please focus focus on that 

my dedicated period was 4 weeks and that took toll on me as i got sick with flu bla bla,despite sick i had to study and study hard ..

The night before exam couldnt sleep ,twisting and turning but got may be 2hours sleep and that also imagining biochem /genetics in mind lol 

left earlier for exam to centre drove 2 hours from my house,u must have coffee and some cereals in breakfast and should have some energy chocolates and some water too 

during exam must skip your tutorial and you will buy 15 mint extra and during that,u should write all formulas u know like biochem/physio/carido/renal /pulm etc all that weird stuff,YOUR CIN id will be given every time u log in and log off ,so copy paste it to save time 

i did two blocks straight away and then took break and made sure -my bladder was thoroughly empty without a single drop ,as full bladder is a trouble during exam .and hydrate and stretch urself well 

took exam 23/10/24,and my perception was ,it was super easy and straight forward ,no tricks at all,yes some questions were lengthy some were short .

I completed each block like in 30 minutes and thought may be i F\*\*\*\*\*\*\* up my exam ,each block was kinda same ,and at end i still had 58 mint break left when i finished time..Came out of exam like nothing happened .and exam was super easier then nbme /uworld/ and other stuff

last 2 weeks have been very unsettled thinking nonsense about my result...

Today Got big P what a physician would always want .

Any Questions and guidance you want -feel free to contact me .I hope all the best to people who are waiting for result and how are due to appear in exam..ITs doable but u need to put away your anxiety on day of exam and remain calm.

[US Election: what Trump or Harris means for critical minerals](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/us-election-what-a-trump-or-harris-victory-means-for-critical-minerals/)

**Both candidates have pledged their support for mining and recognize the strategic importance of critical minerals for the energy transition and national security.**

https://preview.redd.it/h7ml7wy6m9zd1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fc5c3bd74f21a10f712d156e864f7b6d6ab7438

In the most anticipated political event of the year, the 2024 US presidential elections will see Kamala Harris and Donald Trump battle for America’s vote on 5 November.  

It is an extremely tight race. Polls are predicting a “knife-edge” result, with outcomes in seven swing states set to decide who will become the next US president.  

Both candidates have pledged their support for mining and recognise the strategic importance of critical minerals for the energy transition and national security.

Here, *Mining Technology* looks at how critical minerals policy could be impacted by the election outcome.  

# US and China ‘decoupling’

Decoupling from China is expected to continue regardless of the election result, according to Christopher Granville, managing director of global political research at TS Lombard.  

However, there is stark contrast between the [energy policy priorities](https://www.power-technology.com/features/us-election-what-a-trump-vs-harris-victory-means-for-the-power-sector/) of incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, alongside differing approaches to trade policy that means decoupling will take “very distinct” forms.   

Over recent years, China has gradually tightened its control over mining and processing of rare earth elements and critical minerals. Today, 80% of critical minerals [supply chains](https://www.state.gov/remarks-at-the-u-s-chamber-of-commerces-critical-minerals-summit/) run through China. The country, a so-called [minerals monolith](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/a-deep-dive-into-chinas-role-as-critical-mineral-monolith), currently produces 99% of battery-grade graphite, more than 60% of lithium chemical, 40% of refined copper, over 80% of refined magnet rare earths and 70% of refined cobalt. 

According to Granville, the Biden administration’s approach to decoupling from China has been “limited to a small yard with a high fence,” with so-called foundational technologies including electric vehicles (EVs) and critical minerals “very well protected” and everything else left to mutually beneficial economic cooperation. 

However, “that is really not working out” and “the reality is rampant proliferation of US-China decoupling is going to go on regardless of the result of the US election,” he says.  

# Proposed tariffs on critical minerals: Harris vs Trump 

The trajectory of the trade war will be drastically different depending on whether Trump or Harris wins the election, according to GlobalData.   

Decoupling from China could be “significantly worsened” under Trump, who has proposed 10-20% baseline global tariffs, plus 60% or higher tariffs on Chinese imports.  

These tariffs, alongside any additional retaliation from China, could produce ‘stagflation’, that is, causing higher inflation and interest rates, in turn weakening economic growth. As a result, such tariffs will likely receive significant pushback. 

Similarly to Biden, Harris’s foreign policy focuses on managing competition with China while decoupling in critical areas, building allied relationships and prioritising nearshoring/friendshoring initiatives with the EU, Japan and South Korea.  

A Harris administration is also expected “to maintain or build on” the $18bn dollars in Section 301 tariffs levied on Chinese imports in strategic tech and green sectors, says Grace Fan, global director of policy and disruptive research at TS Lombard.  

These tariffs, which came into effect from 27 September, saw the rate on EVs under Section 301 increase from 25% to 100%. Additional rates rose to 25% on lithium-ion EV batteries, steel and aluminium products and certain critical minerals.

Tariffs of 25% on natural graphite and permanent magnets are also scheduled to come in from 2026. However, despite these tariffs and subsidies the US graphite industry is [still struggling](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/us-tariffs-and-subsidies-non-chinese-graphite/) to compete with low-cost Chinese production.  

# Differing approaches to shoring up minerals supply 

As US-China tech decoupling continues, Fan points out that “Beijing is flexing its muscles on more stringent export controls in this area, starting with gallium, germanium, graphite, [antimony](https://www.mining-technology.com/news/china-to-limit-antimony-exports-from-15-september/), and rare earth \[processing\] technologies.”   

The main different between a Harris and Trump presidency, she adds, is the extent to which Harris might leverage US alliances to help “friendshore” critical minerals.  

The Biden-led Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), launched in June 2022, recently welcomed seven new members, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Philippines and Türkiye. It now has 32 critical minerals projects underway.  

Ahead of the election, Harris also [vowed ](https://www.mining-technology.com/news/harris-pledges-to-create-us-critical-minerals-national-reserve/)to create a US critical minerals reserve and incentivise investments that expand domestic and allied production. 

The level of trade restrictions against China will depend on how successful efforts to boost domestic manufacturing are during Harris’s first term, GlobalData says in its latest [report](https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/usa-elections-theme-analysis-executive-briefing/).  If the US struggles to build up its manufacturing capacity, US-China trade restrictions may temporarily ease to help boost the reshoring transition using cheap raw materials from China.  

Trump is expected to focus on reshoring. While some of the critical mineral partnerships could also see forward momentum under a Trump administration, the risk of a more chaotic approach means “possibly less progress than under Harris,” Fan says.  

# Fossil fuels and environmental regulations 

Trump’s return to the White House is likely to signify a sharp [pivot towards fossil fuels](https://www.offshore-technology.com/news/us-election-what-a-trump-or-harris-victory-means-for-the-hydrocarbons-sector/), with growth of the oil and gas sector, more liquified natural gas export permits and relaxation of environmental regulations. He has also suggested attempts to revitalise coal, an industry in rapid decline.    

Plus, if Trump wins a second term, the clean energy priorities of fossil fuel and mining companies are likely to be favoured over other segments such as offshore wind, which saw permitting stalled under his first term. 

Battery EV supply chains are also likely to be at risk, due to ties with China. This is still unclear, however, as “while Trump 1.0 tried to withdraw EV subsidies, now, the owner of the biggest EV company in the US is openly backing the Republican candidate,” says Paul Hasselbrinck, senior energy analyst at GlobalData.   

Trump has also voiced his support for domestic mining. Speaking at a rally in Minnesota the former president pledged to overturn the Biden administration’s 20-year ban on mining in the Iron Range and bring the industry “roaring back”. 

Under the Biden administration’s $369bn Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the mining sector has benefitted from the roll-out of loans and grants. This includes the $2.26bn US Department of Energy loan for a lithium carbonate processing facility at Thacker Pass, [finalised](https://www.mining-technology.com/news/lithium-americas-thacker-pass/) in October.  

Harris is expected to introduce further legislation to support the IRA, including mining reform to promote sustainable domestic critical mineral mining. 

However, the Biden-Harris administration has also been [accused](https://mineralsmakelife.org/blog/president-bidens-first-term-minerals-mining-legacy/) of lacking urgency to develop minerals and making only ‘modest headway’ on mine permitting reform. In addition to the mining moratorium in Minnesota, the Biden administration [banned new coal leasing](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/ending-coal-leasing-in-wyoming-powder-river-basin-in-us/) in the Powder River Basin.  

# Critical minerals: priorities for the next US president 

Regardless of the election result, the next US president “must hit the ground running to break China’s alarming grip on the nation’s mineral supply chains,” says Rich Nolan president and CEO of the National Mining Association. 

He is [calling](https://www.realclearenergy.org/articles/2024/10/30/bipartisan_confrontation_of_the_minerals_crisis_1068784.html) for three key actions: more centralised governance, mine permitting reform and creation of a level playing field for domestic producers to address the flood of Chinese and Russian-controlled minerals into global markets.  

Momentum is [already building](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/could-the-2024-us-election-revive-the-bureau-of-mines/) for a successor to the US Bureau of Mines, which was shut down almost three decades ago. Such a centralised mining authority charged with developing a comprehensive and coordinated mineral policy could help increase the US’s competitiveness in the mining sector, advocates say.   

Paramita Das, chief strategy officer at Stardust Power, a company that is planning to start construction of a lithium refinery in Oklahoma by mid-2025, tells *Mining Technology*: “It will be the expectation of the new administration…to prioritise policies that enhance national security, US energy independence and the self-sufficiency of critical supply chains.”  

According to Das, this should include “increased investment in domestic mining and processing initiatives” while continuing to encourage allied countries to work with the US.  

She, too, points to priorities such as “regulatory reforms to streamline and accelerate permitting processes and incentivising enhanced manufacturing in the US and neighbouring countries”. 

Regardless of the outcome of the 2024 US presidential election, the US must continue its effort to create independent supply chains for critical minerals. 

Decoupling from China is likely to continue regardless of the election outcome, particularly in the critical minerals space because of the national security implications of dependence on adversarial nations such as China and Russia. However, we can expect very different approaches depending on a Harris or Trump election victory.

# With ambitious technological and financial cooperation, Western allies could produce enough critical minerals to meet climate goals.

In the aftermath of the COVID pandemic, nations quickly discovered the perils of an uneven distribution of production and processing capabilities in the guise of globalization. Phrases like ""near-shoring"" and ""friend-shoring"" led discussions of a green economy as remedies to the trade imbalance between the United States and the People's Republic of China (PRC). While exclusionary nationalism will only exacerbate the situation in the short term, a stabilizing solution in the form of teamwork between democratic countries is not only possible but is already in progress.

Calls for a Western-led critical minerals market have been growing ever since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and grew louder following the announcement of a derivatives trading desk at Ganfeng Lithium – the top Chinese producer with resources in Argentina, Australia, Mali, and Mexico – to stabilize and protect Chinese interests against financial risks.

The decision to establish the desk comes during a period of extreme volatility and geopolitical tensions in the lithium industry. Lithium prices have fallen over 70% in the past year after more than doubling to a record high in late 2022. The desk will trade instruments linked to commodities, equities, indexes, and rates to help lower the risks of cross-border investments and overseas market volatilities.

In April 2023, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke at the Brookings Institution, outlining the U.S. international economic agenda. He noted that the Biden administration faced challenges – intense geopolitical competition, a squeeze on the middle class, a weak American industrial base and vulnerable supply chains, an accelerating climate crisis, and rapid technological change.

Last month, Sullivan returned to Brookings to reflect on the progress and challenges of the past 18 months. As part of that ongoing agenda, the U.S. has been working on a standardized international marketplace between Western allies aiming to divert critical mineral processing and refinement away from China's domination of supply chains and key renewable energy technologies.

""That's why we are working with them to create a high-standard, critical minerals marketplace, one that diversifies our supply chains, creates a level playing field for our producers, and promotes strong workers' rights and environmental protections,"" Sullivan said. ""We're driving towards tangible progress on that idea in just the next few weeks.""

# Notable movement

Though further details on the partnerships weren't forthcoming at Brookings, headlines have shown movement in the right direction.

Early last year, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that a key pillar of the EU's new industrial strategy would be global partnerships to access inputs needed for industry, building on existing EU initiatives, including the European Battery Alliance and the Critical Raw Materials Act, both of which aim to secure supply chains.

President von der Leyen also [released a joint statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/10/joint-statement-by-president-biden-and-president-von-der-leyen-2/) with President Biden, committing to working together to ensure that the supply chains of the future are reflective of shared values, ""The United States and European Union are committed to addressing the climate crisis, accelerating the global clean energy economy, and building resilient, secure, and diversified clean energy supply chains. Both parties recognize that these objectives are at the heart of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the EU Green Deal Industrial Plan.""

""They laid out practical steps in the statement to achieve those goals – like aligning respective clean-energy incentives on each side of the Atlantic and launching a negotiation on supply chains for critical minerals and batteries,"" said Sullivan.

In May of this year, Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau extended the [Bilateral Energy Transformation Task Force](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/16/u-s-canada-joint-statement-on-the-extension-of-the-bilateral-energy-transformation-task-force/) to accelerate clean-energy supply and create middle-class jobs on both sides of the border.

The U.S. and Japan have also [signed an agreement](https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2023/march/united-states-and-japan-sign-critical-minerals-agreement) expanding cooperation on critical-mineral supply chains.

""Today's announcement is proof of President Biden's commitment to building resilient and secure supply chains,"" said Ambassador Katherine Tai, principal trade advisor, negotiator, and spokesperson on U.S. trade policy. ""Japan is one of our most valued trading partners and this agreement will enable us to deepen our existing bilateral relationship. This is a welcome moment as the United States continues to work with our allies and partners to strengthen supply chains for critical minerals, including through the Inflation Reduction Act.""

''\[The critical minerals\] sector is marked by extreme price volatility, widespread corruption, weak labor and environmental protections, and heavy concentration in the PRC, which artificially drops prices to keep competitors out of the marketplace. If we and our partners fail to invest, the PRC's domination of these and other supply chains will only grow, and that will leave us increasingly dependent on a country that has demonstrated its willingness to weaponize such dependencies. We can't accept that, and neither can our partners.'' Sullivan said.

# Will it be enough?

Ongoing research and exploration initiatives from both government and private sectors have resulted in several promising international resource finds.

At the international level, discussions have been ongoing about the potential for abyssal seafloor mining operations, promising a treasure trove of minerals but uncertain environmental consequences.

The U.S. Geological Survey this month [announced world-leading measurements of lithium](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2024/10/23/tech-metals/arkansas-sits-atop-a-sea-of-lithium/2000.html) beneath the bedrock of Arkansas in a massive underground brine resource called the Smackover Formation extending under parts of Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida as well.

According to the Nordic Council of Ministers, the countries of Finland, Greenland, Norway, and Sweden are rich in rare earth elements as well as cobalt, graphite, lithium, and nickel reserves that remain largely unexploited and have a history of commitment to low-impact, sustainable mining practices, making them ideal industry sources.

In 2022, the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and EU launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment to build clean energy supply chains between each other. The countries also signed the Minerals Security Partnership to produce, process, and recycle critical minerals, strengthening ""joint industrial policy"" to coordinate at the international level, build collaborative supply chains and work together to secure supplies of needed technologies and create markets in support of net-zero industries at home.

Studies done by the Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab at Johns Hopkins University have concluded that with sufficiently ambitious technological and financial cooperation, such democratic partnerships could produce enough critical minerals to successfully meet Paris Agreement targets.



# Nov. 1st 2024 ~What are Critical Minerals?

[What are Critical Minerals? | U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/mineral-resources-program/science/what-are-critical-minerals-0)

How did the List of Critical Minerals come to be?

# A ""National Plan""

Calls for a “national mineral plan” became loud in the 1920s, as American scientists recognized the importance of understanding mineral resources and supply chains in an increasingly globalized and industrial world. Around the same time, the USGS began using standardized methods to collect mineral statistics, including information about mineral production and supply chains. 

# The Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act

In 1939, as WWII began and mineral supplies became stressed, Congress passed the “Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act.” The Act was intended to bolster stockpiling and supply chains of “certain strategic and critical materials” that would become essential to national defense. The President was given the authority to name which materials were considered “strategic and critical”. 

# A Renewed Interest

In more recent years, as supply chain science has advanced and the Nation’s mineral needs have changed, there has been a renewed interest in identifying minerals that are critical today, and especially in sectors within and beyond the national defense sphere, including for advanced consumer technologies and energy infrastructure. 

A number of pieces of legislation in recent years have laid the foundation for developing increasingly sophisticated lists of critical minerals. Additionally, in 2010, the National Science and Technology Council established a [Critical Minerals Subcommittee](https://www.criticalminerals.gov/) to coordinate across federal agencies on matters related to critical minerals

In a post on the struggles of [Abbess Thaisia](http://holynativity.blogspot.ca/2014/11/a-charismatic-learns-to-take-up-her.html) I wrote of a young nun’s struggle to find peace in her calling when there seemed to be no love in those around her.  The following comment was left on that post, and I would like to respond to it now.  Here’s the comment:

>I am struggling with much of the same issue in your excerpt posted from Thaisia in regards to discouragement with those in church leadership and a lack of love by those in the church. My thoughts often drift to the same place as her’s… If no sincere love is seen and experienced, then there must not be any salvation. Perhaps in the future you might speak to this point, as I know many of the younger generation feel similarly.Anonymous

Well Dear Anonymous, I think this is a pretty common experience.  Anyone who has spent more than a little time in the Orthodox Church (or, for this matter, in any group calling itself church) quickly notices that the saints are in the minority, a very small minority, and that those who seem to be desiring to live a Christ-like life—while they may be found here and there—seem to keep themselves well hidden. In fact, sometimes it seems as though the nonreligious people in our life are more compassionate, more like Christ, than many of the religious people we know.  This is a common experience.

To understand what’s going on, I think we have to keep several things in mind.  First, we have to keep in mind that this is very much how Jesus experienced the religious world into which he was born and raised.  The religious leaders of Jesus’ day were largely corrupted, selfish and lacking in basic compassion.  Jesus constantly refers to them as vipers and hypocrites.  But not all of religious leaders of His day were that way.  There is the Lawyer to whom Jesus says, “You are not far from the Kingdom of Heaven” (Mark 12:34).  Jesus also meets secretly with Nicodemos, “a ruler of the Jews” and explains His mission to him (“Light has come into the world, but men prefer darkness rather than Light… John 3).  This same Nicodemos tries to defend Jesus before the other Pharisees (John 7:50) and in the end joins Joseph of Arimathea (a rich and “prominent council member,” Mark 15: 43 and John 19: 38-42) in enabling and burying Jesus’ Body.  It says of Joseph that he is a secret follower of Christ “for fear of the Jews,” yet he nonetheless boldly asks Pontius Pilate for Jesus’s body.

Furthermore, that same religious world that, on the one hand, seems so corrupted, was the same religious world that produced Jesus’ Mother, Mary, the holiest of women, and her parents Sts. Joacim and Anna.  That apparently broken religious world also produced John the Baptist, his holy parents, Sts. Zachariah and Elizabeth.  It was the religious world that also produced the twelve Apostles (one of whom was a traitor) and the seventy lesser Apostles.  Clearly, despite the abundance of (both truly and apparently) unloving, corrupt leaders in Jesus’ day, God was still able to produce from that religious world a lot of very holy people.  And this is, by the way, exactly what Abbess Thaisia found out.  In fact, it may indeed be that part of our growth in Christ must take place in such a context of seeming abandonment: abandonment by every human authority who should love and help and encourage us, abandonment that forces us to find strength in God alone, abandonment that teaches to love and forgive even those who seem to have no love and no forgiveness.

Some other things to keep in mind when we are confused and despondent about the lack of love in the Church are the parables Jesus told about what the Kingdom of Heaven would actually be like. For example, Jesus said that the Kingdom of Heaven is like a farmer who sows good seed in his field, but at night an enemy comes and sows tares (weeds that look somewhat like wheat, but have no edible grain.  Matt. 13:24 ff).  This is what Jesus said the Church would look like: the real and the false growing side by side.

And of course we are all so like the servants in the parable.  We want to rush out and separate.  We want to determine who the real Christians are and who the impostors are.  We want to make the determination.  But the master in the parable says no.  Ours is not to determine, to separate.  Ours is to just let it be.  God, we are told, will send His reapers, the angels, who will gather the wheat into barns and the tares into destruction.  Whenever we try to separate, whenever we try ourselves to determine who the false Christians are, we end up making a huge mess of it and uprooting and trampling on the very precious wheat.  Ours is not to determine the genuineness of the faith of others, ours is to discern the genuineness of our own faith.  Am I being saved?  Am I loving even those who are hard to love?  Am I forgiving others as I want God to forgive me?

A final thing I encourage people to keep in mind when they are confused and discouraged by the apparent lack of love and lack of Christ-like virtue they seem to see in those who lead the Church is that what we see with our eyes is generally only a very small part of what is actually happening.  This is particularly true when it comes to leaders in any institutional setting (and the Church is an institution—a God bearing institution, but an institution nonetheless).  Those who lead both see much more than we see and at the same time see much less.  What I mean is that even when we assume the best intentions, leaders are forced to look at the bigger picture and make decisions based on what seems to them to be best for the whole.  And at the same time, because they are looking at the big picture, often leaders do not see or appreciate the pain of specific people and specific situations.  The leaders themselves often do not realize the pain they are causing in specific situations in their desire to do what is best for the corporate good.  It’s a matter of basic human weakness.  None of us sees everything.  None of us knows everything.  Even assuming the best intentions, none of us sees or knows clearly enough to encourage any good without at the same time unintentionally causing pain or misunderstanding somewhere.  That’s just the nature things in our fallen world.

I was at a seminar for priests recently.  And as is usual, in the evenings we would gather in small groups in one another’s rooms, drink a little (or a little too much) wine and talk about what’s troubling us in our churches.  One young and zealous priest was complaining about the apathy and lack of piety among his parishioners when an older priest told him the following story.  There was an older woman in his parish who never seemed to keep the Church’s fasts.  She would bring food with “only a little bit of beacon” in it to coffee hour during lent.  Her breath often smelled of coffee when she was receiving communion on Sunday mornings.  This bothered the father greatly until one day he determined that it was his duty to teach this woman the importance of fasting.  Then one Sunday, he seized the opportunity and drew the woman aside and said to her, Nellie (I think that was her name), we need to talk about the importance of fasting.  Nellie’s response shocked him.

Nellie said, “Father, I have always been confused by the Church’s rules on fasting.  I never knew what was allowed on which days.  It was all so very confusing to me.  So, as a young woman I made a determination:  Since I didn’t know which days to fast on or what to fast from on those days, I decided to fast completely, drinking nothing but water, for the first three days of every month.  And so that is what I have been doing for the past thirty years.  What was it, Father, that you wanted to tell me about fasting?”

The Father could say nothing.  He, in his ignorance, had judged a pious woman harshly.

You see, we never know enough about a person or about a situation to judge fairly.  Often what seems to us to be unloving, harsh or unChrist-like behaviour may indeed be the most loving, kind, and Christ-like behaviour possible, if we knew the whole story.  Of course life is never just all one thing or all another.  We are seldom completely Christ-like in anything we do.  When I have a headache, my wife often asked me if I am mad at her.  Trying my best to be loving, in my weakness my best attempts at kindness sometimes sound to her like anger.  And then there is just plain carelessness. How many times have I been offended, not by what someone has said to me, but by the *way* he or she has said it to me or by the timing or by the context?  Sure, they could have said it in a better way, or at a better time or in a better place, but then again, who is perfect except God?

But this then brings us back to Abbess Thaisia and how God uses broken people in this broken system in this broken world to save our souls.  Jesus came to show us the way to heaven, the way of salvation.  And the way that Jesus showed us was the way of Resurrection through the Cross.  We must all die with Christ so that we can be raised with Him.  And what does this death look like? Abbess Thaisia tells us that the death is a death of our will, a death of our expectation of how things *should* be, a death of our plan, our agenda, our way.  It is often a death like the death of Jesus, a death that comes through the failures and weaknesses of religious leaders, that comes to us through the intentional and unintentional blows of those who should have loved and protected us.  It’s a miserable death, a painful death; it is a real death.  It is a real death followed by a even more real resurrection.

This is the Christian way, the way of the ascetics, the way of the saints, the way of everyone who would take up their cross and follow Christ.",1,1730895714.0,SophiaWisdomOfGod,0,1.0,False

a short story 
MYSTERY | SUSPENSE | THRILLER 
 

“Come on,” a woman’s voice comes from behind me. Loud and bubbly, full of joy, like a pageant parent. I jump at the sound of it. I turn to face her, forcing a false smile, pretending to be amused.

 

“I’m sorry, ma’am, but it’s time for us to lock up.” I inform her, gesturing her and her little ones towards the exit. 

 

She scoffs. Her blonde hair, carefully curled and pinned, framing her face of sharp angles, softened by layers of expertly applied makeup. 

 

I hold my smile and say, “I know, time flies when you’re having fun!” 

 

This prompts her to lean off her place against the shark tank and approach me. She wore a red floral dress, one that moved with her like a breeze, as if she floated rather than walked. 

 

“Can’t we just swim with the fish a little while longer?”

 

Her voice high and sweet, dripping with exaggerated enthusiasm. Even the way she blinked seemed calculated, the slow flutter of her lashes too deliberate to be genuine. 

 

“I promise we won’t splash!” she jokes, hands folded together, lip pouting. 

 

“I wish I could say yes, but those are the rules.”

 

She rolls her eyes, motioning her children into a hurdle, then waving them onwards. 

 

“Oh, rules shmules,” she says as she parades passed me, “What would another five minutes hurt?” she says mockingly from behind her middle finger. “Come on girls, lets get out of this aquari-yawn.” 

 

The aquarium closes at 5 p.m., but anyone still inside gets an extra hour to wander the halls. The speakers overhead that normally blast music and sound effects during the day are turned off for that last hour, which turns the place into an awkward, slightly eerie, underwater maze. 

 

By 6 o'clock, we’re usually dealing with disappointed guests who believe they’re the first to crack a sarcastic joke, hoping to convince us to let them stay ""just a little while longer."" But there was no sarcasm in the voice I heard next.

 

“Really? You’re kicking us out now?” I hear a man shouting just around the corner from the ticket booth. He’s yelling at Nancy, the employee in the box office. “Who knew fish had such strict curfews?” He crosses his arms dramatically, tapping his foot impatiently. 

 

“I’m really sorry sir, but unfortunately that’s all the time there is.” Nancy apologizes sympathetically. 

 

The man tosses his hands up and argues, “Well, what are you going to do about it, huh?” 

 

That’s when I step in to mediate. I start in their direction quickly, but quietly on my feet. I turn my radio off then back on, increasing the  volume so the static screech blares from the speaker. The man whips his head towards me when he hears it, then shifts back to Nancy.

 

His eyes peel back, wide with disbelief. “Oh, what? Did you call security on me?” 

 

“What seems to be the problem, sir?” I interject.

 

“Unbelievable!” the man retorts, before scurrying to the exit. 

 

“Have a great night, sir!” I add. 

 

The man pauses abruptly at the door, looks over his shoulder, a smug grin stretching across his face. “You know, strange things happen after hours in places like these,” he says in a deep, low tone, almost playfully. “I’d keep an eye on those fish if I were you.” He laughs maniacally, then pushes the door open and steps out.

 

I stand in place for a brief moment, feeling the cold chill of his words—it made me realize the quietness of the aquarium. 

 

“A joke,” I tell myself, but something about the way he said it made it feel particularly strange. “It’s probably nothing. Right?” I ask myself.

 

“Thanks, Jett,"" Nancy says, her hand trembling over her heart. 

 

“Don’t mention it.” I reply with reassuring confidence, and then, “He had no right to yell at you.”  I shake off the unease, turning down the hallway to check for more guests. 

 

Just as I’m about to disappear around the corner, Nancy calls out, “Hey, Jett,”

 

I stop and turn around, “Yes?” 

 

“I know it’s probably nothing,” she hesitates, almost afraid to speak, “but what that man said… what did he mean, strange things happen after hours?”

 

I open my mouth to shrug it off, but a strange feeling nags at me. I glance back toward the now-closed doors. “I’m sure it was just some stupid joke,” I say, though I’m not sure who I’m trying to convince—her or myself.

 

 I’ve grown used to the dry humor from customers who think they can negotiate for more time, chuckling, “Just a little longer, right?” as if this isn’t the tenth time I’ve heard it this week. But this man said it with a  smile on his face, making it feel more grim than playful. Like it was personal. But he was just doing that because he was upset and I shouldn't be worried about it.

 

Today, at six o’clock on a Saturday evening, the place is nearly empty. The tanks that normally hum with excitement now feel still and lifeless, which is oddly satisfying. No more guests are lingering or begging to stay just a bit longer. I can almost taste the freedom of leaving early. 

 

I glance at my watch again, the hands steadily inching closer to the hour. I have to pick up my sister at eight, but with the building so quiet, I suddenly see a rare opportunity to carve out a moment for myself. Maybe I could grab a coffee or take a quick stroll by the river before diving back into family obligations. Just thinking about it brightens my mood a little.

 

I take a deep breath, letting the peaceful emptiness wash over me as I look forward to the moment I can finally walk out the door.

 

The last visitor exited the aquarium, the sound of the doors clicking shut was like a well-tuned song. I secure the locks, then engage the alarms, checking to ensure everything is in place. For good measure, I double-check that everything is locked and loaded.

 

“You almost done, Jett?” I hear Nancy’s voice from the lobby. The clicking of her heels and the jangle of her bangles and keychain are her subtle cue that she’s ready to go home.

 

“Just a few more minutes,” I holler, picking up my pace, but not so quickly that I skip steps.

 

“I really need to get going,” Nancy urges, looking anxiously out the window into the employee parking lot. “You don’t think that man from earlier is still hanging around, do you?”

 

“He’s probably long gone by now.” I say with too much confidence, my gaze drifting to the lot where Nancy has been staring, biting her nails and tensing her shoulders.

 

“You see anything out there, Nancy?” I ask humorously, hoping to lighten the unease that now makes my skin crawl.

 

“No, no,” she replies, uncertainty clouding her eyes. “It’s just… darker than it usually is.”

 

I almost brush it off but can’t shake the feeling that something’s not right. The parking lot is darker than usual, the lights barely doing their job.

 

“If you can wait just a few, I’ll walk with you,” I offer, sounding more like a question than a solid plan.

 

She hesitates, considers it for a moment, then says, “Don’t worry about it.” She pulls her phone from her purse, “I’ll be fine.” Her confidence feels brittle as she flips on her flashlight, “Good night, Jett.”

 

I look up from the security cameras to say goodnight, but Nancy is already gone. 

 

I hear a sound—maybe a shuffle or a footfall—but I push it aside when my phone buzzes. It’s Skye, my little sister. I answer, eager to redirect my thoughts.

 

“Hey, you still picking me up at 8?” she asks, sounding a bit worried that I might be late again. 

 

“Yeah, I’m right on schedule,” I reply, trying to keep it brief. The old pinky promise we made as kids rings in my ears, a reminder: I need to be there for her—no excuses. 

 

I finish up securing the building and grab my keys to head out. As I step outside, I listen to the door click shut behind me. I glance toward the parking lot, where Nancy should’ve been walking, but I don’t see her. It’s hard to tell in the low light, but I think I can see her silhouette on the far side of the lot.

 

“Jett? You still there?” My sister’s voice pulls me back.

 

“Yeah, yeah, I’m here,” I say, stepping further into the lot. I hear another shuffling sound, not as easy to ignore this time. I walk a little faster, squinting toward where I thought I saw Nancy, but I don’t see her anymore. I notice her car is still parked with the engine off.

 

“I’m leaving now, sis. I’ll be there in fifteen minutes,” I say.

 

“Okay, I’ll be ready!” she chirps, blissfully unaware. I hang up my phone, slipping it into my pocket. The thought of a coffee or a stroll by the river quickly vanishes beneath the urgency of keeping my promise.

 

 

I squint again toward Nancy’s car, but now I’m certain—there’s no sign of her. A prickling sensation rises along the back of my neck when I remember that she’d been in such a hurry to get going. I try to push down the thought of that creepy man from earlier—how he might be involved somehow. Why else would she have just left her car here? 

 

My feet scrape across the pavement. That shuffling sound again. Only this time it’s closer—almost like it’s right behind me. I spin around, but there’s nothing there. My eyes pinball around the lot. I hold my breath, trying to listen, but other than the distant sounds of typical city life, I don’t hear anything out of the ordinary. 

 

""Stop it,"" I mutter to myself. ""You’re just imagining things.""

 

I tell myself to just leave—that I’m overthinking all of this. Nancy was probably in a hurry because maybe she was catching a ride with a friend who was waiting outside for her. But, no, surely I would have seen a vehicle in the parking lot. And Nancy would have mentioned that when I offered to walk out with her. 

 

Then, something catches my eye—her keys. Hanging from the lock in her driver’s side door. All the flashy keychains and accessories shining little reflections of light. They’re just dangling there. Nancy wouldn’t leave these behind, would she? I find myself standing before her car door, and reach for her keys. My thumb runs over the smooth surface of the key fob. The metal should be warm since she’d been holding her keys since before she walked out to leave. But they are ice cold in my hand. 

 

My gut tightens, that sense of something not right deepening. I glance back at the aquarium doors, the huge tanks beyond. Just then, the parking lot lights flicker—just once, but enough to make me see spots. I pocket her keys and look around, blinking away the spots, hoping to catch a glimpse of something—anything—that makes sense of this. 

 

But, nothing. 

 

I wonder if I should go back inside, check the cameras again, just to make sure Nancy left on her own. But a gnawing feeling keeps me rooted to the spot—telling me that if I don’t walk away now, I’ll regret it. 

 

That man’s words replay in my mind, like a warning or a taunt. I glance back toward the aquarium, see the massive fish tanks, how the lights mix with the strange shapes across the pavement. 

 

“Maybe it’s just paranoia,” I think, but I can't shake the idea that something more is going on.

 

I force myself to get into my car, struggling to keep control of my own movements. My hands move in slow motion, my feet feel like they’re two steps behind me. The key slips twice before I manage to turn it in the ignition. 

 

“I just need to drive, get out of here, clear my head,” plays repeatedly inside my head. The parking lot appears unfamiliar all of a sudden, and the lights phasing in and out make my head ache. I breathe in short bursts, desperate to calm down—determined to fulfill my promise with Skye. If I go now, I can still make it in time, then I can get to the bottom of whatever happened with Nancy.  

 

The engine roars to life, much louder than it should against the empty asphalt. As I pull away I fight the urge to look in the rearview mirror. 

 

“Don’t look back,” I demand myself. “Don’t look back.”

 

I peel out of the parking lot faster than I realize, barely missing the curb. Then, I slam the brakes, pulling off to the side of the road when I spot a figure sprawled on the sidewalk. My stomach drops. “Please don’t let that be Nancy.” 

 

As I jerk forward, my chest smacks against the wheel. I pull in closer, the figure just out of reach of the headlights. But I can see that it is a woman laying there—her hair is the same color, and her coat—it’s the same one she always wore to work.

 

I stay frozen in my seat, unable to move. Then she sits up, looks directly at me. I flinch. It looks like she’s waiting for me. I swing the door open and stumble out, confused but fueled by a desperation that’s propelling me toward her.

 

""Nancy!"" I call out, stumbling into the shoulder of the road, arm outstretched, ""Are you alright? What are you doing out here?""

 

“Nancy!” I shout again, desperate for a response, but she doesn’t speak. She doesn’t move.

 

I try to clear the unfamiliar onset of a strange haze clouding my mind. It’s as if life itself has turned on me—made me the enemy. Everything around me seems to behave independently, as if objects somehow sprang to life.  I shake my head and rub my eyes, but my surroundings remain distorted. Everything runs together, sludgy and syrupy. 

 

As disturbing as this is, I can’t just leave Nancy laying here. I run toward her, unsure of what I’ll be able to do to help, but sure I’ll figure something out once I reach her.

 

As I get closer, the edges of her form blur, like a photo out of focus. The streetlights towering ominously above me laugh in a hushed, humming tone—mocking me.

 

I leap towards Nancy, but by the time I reach the spot, she’s gone. I scramble, grabbing at the empty ground. “Wha-what? She was just here.” I mutter to myself, glued to the pavement. Panic surges through me, sharp and bitter. 

 

I look up into the streetlights again—they’re watching, laughing, like this is some sick joke. I stand up cursing at the lights, “Damn you!” I shout at the top of my lungs, “What have you done with Nancy?” but the lights just stare back, refusing to answer. 

 

I storm off and head back to my car when suddenly, from behind me, red and blue lights flash. A voice booms through a speaker. “Sir, step away from the vehicle.”

 

“Oh, good!” I praise the moment with my arms raised overhead, “Thank God, you’re here!” I run towards the officers car, now shielding my eyes from the strobe. 

 

“You have to hurry, please!” I begged the officer, tapping on his window, gesturing for him to roll it down, but he doesn’t. He just sits in his vehicle staring at me. Hope quickly turns to worry. Then I hear the voice come over the speaker again—it’s the officer. He’s commanding me to back away from the road, “Get down on your knees and place your hands behind your head!” 

 

What? No, this isn’t happening. 

 

Slowly, I back away, bewildered. 

 

They’re talking to me? For what? I didn’t do anything! 

 

Before I know it, they’re on me, forcing my hands behind my back. “Wait, you don’t understand,” I shout, struggling to keep my voice steady. “Nancy’s missing! I just saw her—she was right there!”

 

But my words come out in jumbles, running together like ink on damp paper. The officer’s face appears before me, glaring with impatience and disbelief. But no matter how much I shout, how loud I plea for them to hear me out, they don’t listen—they never do. My chest ignites with rage. I can hear the voice of one of the officer’s—the one leading me to the squad car—but it’s like my brain has turned to mush because I don’t understand a single word.

 

How can they be arresting me? Nancy’s missing, and it's like no one cares.

 

They don’t waste any time before they shove me into the back of the car. I look out the window hoping to see things correctly, as they should be again. But still, everything looks like it’s not real—like a painting or a cartoon. Or maybe it just seems that way because inanimate objects are moving on their own, or shaking, or melting. But I know that that’s impossible!

 

I rest my forehead against the window and focus on my breathing. Just then, the officer mans the vehicle and cuts off the flashing lights. 

 

“What’s going on?” I manage to ask the officer as he shifts to drive. “Where are you taking me?”

 

He draws in a deep breath, “We’ve seen this happen before,” he exhales, “we’re going to take care of you. Just sit back and relax.”

 

It was then when I realized how tense I was. I became hyper aware of my body and I swear it was like I could feel my insides operating, like I could hear beeping, or clicking from inside of me. Panic set in.

 

I see my phone light up a little way off in the distance, right where I thought Nancy was. “That’s probably my sister wondering where I am!” I shout, thrashing in the back seat. “Wait, we can’t leave—my sister!” 

 

The officer shakes his head, keeping his eyes forward. “Your sister isn’t here,” he says in a calm voice, pulling out of the parking space. As we pull away, one of the officers picks up my phone and puts it into his pocket.

 

When we reach the station, they take me down a hallway and sit me in a room with nothing but a table and a few chairs. The walls are blank and colored the same shade of gray as the floor and ceiling. I take a seat at the empty metal table to await my fate. It isn’t long before a detective enters, carrying a file, looking at me but saying nothing. He holds his face so sure and still that I struggle to gain any clues to what he might be thinking. Then takes a seat across the table from me and opens the file. 

 

He spreads out photographs across the table. Pictures of me at different points during the night—standing outside the aquarium, yelling at the streetlights, and shouting at no one on the sidewalk. I lean in closer to get a better look, but there’s no sign of Nancy in any of the photos.

 

“Care to explain this?” he asks overly calm, almost deliberate. 

 

I shake my head. “No, that can’t be right. Nancy was there. I saw her.”

 

He sighs, then gives me a look of pity. “We’ve seen this kind of thing before.” He starts collecting the photos, individually placing each one back into his file. “A couple of other patrons mentioned two regulars who like to slip something into people’s drinks from time to time… It makes them see things—things that aren’t there.”

 

“No, you don’t understand. I wasn’t hallucinating. She was right there. You have to believe me.”

 

He slides the file across the table, folds his hands and continues, “We’ve been tracking those two for a while. They come around every few weeks, pick a spot, and disappear just as quickly. You were just unlucky enough to be their latest project.”

 

 

I want to argue, to insist that I know what I saw, but the memory of Nancy’s face—the way it blurred when I approached her, how she simply vanished when I tried to help her up—it’s as though someone is pulling it from my mind.

 

Then the detective spreads out another series of photographs, but this time they are of other people who I don’t recognize.

 

“Recognize anyone?”  

 

“No.”

 

He pushes the pictures towards me, “You sure about that?” 

 

I examine the pictures again, more closely this time. “No, wait.” I stuttered, “I think I do recognize someone—two of them, actually.”

 

 

The detective raises an eyebrow, his eyes prompt me to continue. 

 

 

“Him,” I point to one of the photos. “He was at the aquarium tonight. He was yelling at one of my employees, saying some weird stuff that had us spooked.

“And who else did you recognize?”

 

 

I nod with my head at the last photo. It’s of a woman with the same hair and sharp facial lines—exactly like the lady that was begging to stay late. 

 

 

The detective puts away the remaining photos, which tells me that I’ve helped their investigation in some way—that I must have picked the people he’d been hoping I would. 

 

 

“What’s this all about?” I ask after some time.

 

 

The detective looks up from the files. “It’s about a series of incidents in the city, now connected to the aquarium,” he sounds like he’s reading a script. “People have gone missing, and we believe the pattern might be linked to what happened tonight.”

 

 

“Missing? You mean… like Nancy?”

 

 

He nods, confirming my fears. “Yes. We’re trying to piece together what happened during your last closing shift. You said something odd occurred, right? That man’s comments… they seemed to stand out.”

 

 

“Yeah. He made a remark about how ‘strange things’ happen after hours,” I reply, the taste of the words made me sick to my stomach, “I didn’t think much of it then.”

 

 

“Perhaps you should have,” he says, leaning closer with disapproval in his eyes. “People don’t just vanish without reason. We're looking into surveillance footage from the area, but any detail you can provide could be crucial.”

 

 

A lump forms in my throat as I rack my brain. I tell him about the rude, sarcastic lady, about Nancy’s hurried departure, and of course, that man’s creepy comment. “I didn’t see anything else out of the ordinary, but…” I hesitate, “There was a moment when I thought I heard something—just before I left the building, and again in the parking lot.”

 

 

“Anything you remember about it?” he presses, pulling out a yellow legal pad, clicking his pen.

 

 

“It was like a shuffle, I thought it might’ve been someone moving behind me, but when I turned around, there was no one there. I assumed it was just my imagination.” I admitted, trying to hide the frustration I felt towards myself for not having been more vigilant in the moment. 

 

 

The detective nods, jotting down my words. “Even small details matter. We need to keep a record of everything. The missing persons report includes multiple individuals who were at your aquarium recently. We’re hoping you can provide something—anything—that can link them together.”

 

 

I can’t help but feel guilty for not having been more precautious—for letting Nancy leave by herself. I had been too selfish, I wanted to leave, to get home to my sister. 

 

 

“Do you think that man had something to do with it?” I ask.

 

 

“It's possible. We’re digging into his background. Your description of him and the interaction may give us a lead,” the detective replies, glancing at the two photos on the table.

 

 

With a heavy heart, I stare at the images of the familiar faces.

 

 

“Is there any way I can help?” I murmur.

 

 

“You already have. Just keep your eyes open and let us know if you remember anything else,” the detective says, packing away the files. 

 

 

As he stands to leave, I suddenly realize that this isn’t just about Nancy. It’s something much larger than what happened at the aquarium. And now, I’ve been dragged into it.

 

 

The detective leaves as quickly as he'd arrived, leaving me to my thoughts. I stand up, pacing the room. Why had Nancy been so eager to leave? The urgency in her voice plays on repeat. She had clearly been rattled before she left, but in the chaos of the evening, I dismissed it. Had she sensed something that I had failed to?

The aquarium is supposed to be a haven for marine life, a place of wonder, yet an awful crime had been brewing just under my nose.

 

 

When I'm released, my phone is handed back to me, the battery down to nine percent. I step out through the front door, seeing several missed calls from Skye. It’s after ten p.m. now—she’s probably freaking out. I dial her back immediately, but after two rings, it goes to voicemail.

 

 

“Oh, come on.” I grumble, trying again. Still no answer. Then, a text from her lights up the screen: *""Don’t bother. I found a ride home, Jett.""

 

 

A tear rolls down my cheek as I reply, ""I'm just glad you're okay. Something awful happened tonight, beyond my control. I'm so sorry.""

 

 

My car is parked a few blocks away, and I’m halfway there when my phone buzzes with her response: ""Yeah, you’re right, something awful did happen tonight.""

 

 

I start to type back, ""No, listen, you don't underst—"" but the screen goes dark. My phone’s dead.

 

 

“Goddamn it!” I shout up into the night sky.

 

 

The rest of the walk blurs by. When I finally reach my car, I stop, looking back at the sidewalk, half-expecting to see Nancy there, but of course she isn't there. She's gone. I can't control the guilt I feel.

 

 

Sliding into the driver’s seat, I close the door, and everything in me unravels. I bury my face in my hands, the pressure crushing me as my breath heightens. I yell, slamming my fists into the dashboard, my anger and sorrow exploding together.

 

 

Then, I freeze. That shuffling sound again—coming from behind me, quiet but unmistakable. I lift my head, looking up into the rearview mirror. My stomach drops. I catch a glimpse of two figures in the back seat, barely discernable against the darkness already so present. I frantically unfasten my seatbelt and fumble with the door handle. Before I can make it out, a cloth presses over my face. I gasp, clawing at the hand holding it. Turning, I see a hint of red, a floral pattern draped over the back seat, but before I can see more, my vision tunnels to black and my muscles go limp.

a short story 
MYSTERY | SUSPENSE | THRILLER 
 

“Come on,” a woman’s voice comes from behind me. Loud and bubbly, full of joy, like a pageant parent. I jump at the sound of it. I turn to face her, forcing a false smile, pretending to be amused.

 

“I’m sorry, ma’am, but it’s time for us to lock up.” I inform her, gesturing her and her little ones towards the exit. 

 

She scoffs. Her blonde hair, carefully curled and pinned, framing her face of sharp angles, softened by layers of expertly applied makeup. 

 

I hold my smile and say, “I know, time flies when you’re having fun!” 

 

This prompts her to lean off her place against the shark tank and approach me. She wore a red floral dress, one that moved with her like a breeze, as if she floated rather than walked. 

 

“Can’t we just swim with the fish a little while longer?”

 

Her voice high and sweet, dripping with exaggerated enthusiasm. Even the way she blinked seemed calculated, the slow flutter of her lashes too deliberate to be genuine. 

 

“I promise we won’t splash!” she jokes, hands folded together, lip pouting. 

 

“I wish I could say yes, but those are the rules.”

 

She rolls her eyes, motioning her children into a hurdle, then waving them onwards. 

 

“Oh, rules shmules,” she says as she parades passed me, “What would another five minutes hurt?” she says mockingly from behind her middle finger. “Come on girls, lets get out of this aquari-yawn.” 

 

The aquarium closes at 5 p.m., but anyone still inside gets an extra hour to wander the halls. The speakers overhead that normally blast music and sound effects during the day are turned off for that last hour, which turns the place into an awkward, slightly eerie, underwater maze. 

 

By 6 o'clock, we’re usually dealing with disappointed guests who believe they’re the first to crack a sarcastic joke, hoping to convince us to let them stay ""just a little while longer."" But there was no sarcasm in the voice I heard next.

 

“Really? You’re kicking us out now?” I hear a man shouting just around the corner from the ticket booth. He’s yelling at Nancy, the employee in the box office. “Who knew fish had such strict curfews?” He crosses his arms dramatically, tapping his foot impatiently. 

 

“I’m really sorry sir, but unfortunately that’s all the time there is.” Nancy apologizes sympathetically. 

 

The man tosses his hands up and argues, “Well, what are you going to do about it, huh?” 

 

That’s when I step in to mediate. I start in their direction quickly, but quietly on my feet. I turn my radio off then back on, increasing the  volume so the static screech blares from the speaker. The man whips his head towards me when he hears it, then shifts back to Nancy.

 

His eyes peel back, wide with disbelief. “Oh, what? Did you call security on me?” 

 

“What seems to be the problem, sir?” I interject.

 

“Unbelievable!” the man retorts, before scurrying to the exit. 

 

“Have a great night, sir!” I add. 

 

The man pauses abruptly at the door, looks over his shoulder, a smug grin stretching across his face. “You know, strange things happen after hours in places like these,” he says in a deep, low tone, almost playfully. “I’d keep an eye on those fish if I were you.” He laughs maniacally, then pushes the door open and steps out.

 

I stand in place for a brief moment, feeling the cold chill of his words—it made me realize the quietness of the aquarium. 

 

“A joke,” I tell myself, but something about the way he said it made it feel particularly strange. “It’s probably nothing. Right?” I ask myself.

 

“Thanks, Jett,"" Nancy says, her hand trembling over her heart. 

 

“Don’t mention it.” I reply with reassuring confidence, and then, “He had no right to yell at you.”  I shake off the unease, turning down the hallway to check for more guests. 

 

Just as I’m about to disappear around the corner, Nancy calls out, “Hey, Jett,”

 

I stop and turn around, “Yes?” 

 

“I know it’s probably nothing,” she hesitates, almost afraid to speak, “but what that man said… what did he mean, strange things happen after hours?”

 

I open my mouth to shrug it off, but a strange feeling nags at me. I glance back toward the now-closed doors. “I’m sure it was just some stupid joke,” I say, though I’m not sure who I’m trying to convince—her or myself.

 

 I’ve grown used to the dry humor from customers who think they can negotiate for more time, chuckling, “Just a little longer, right?” as if this isn’t the tenth time I’ve heard it this week. But this man said it with a  smile on his face, making it feel more grim than playful. Like it was personal. But he was just doing that because he was upset and I shouldn't be worried about it.

 

Today, at six o’clock on a Saturday evening, the place is nearly empty. The tanks that normally hum with excitement now feel still and lifeless, which is oddly satisfying. No more guests are lingering or begging to stay just a bit longer. I can almost taste the freedom of leaving early. 

 

I glance at my watch again, the hands steadily inching closer to the hour. I have to pick up my sister at eight, but with the building so quiet, I suddenly see a rare opportunity to carve out a moment for myself. Maybe I could grab a coffee or take a quick stroll by the river before diving back into family obligations. Just thinking about it brightens my mood a little.

 

I take a deep breath, letting the peaceful emptiness wash over me as I look forward to the moment I can finally walk out the door.

 

The last visitor exited the aquarium, the sound of the doors clicking shut was like a well-tuned song. I secure the locks, then engage the alarms, checking to ensure everything is in place. For good measure, I double-check that everything is locked and loaded.

 

“You almost done, Jett?” I hear Nancy’s voice from the lobby. The clicking of her heels and the jangle of her bangles and keychain are her subtle cue that she’s ready to go home.

 

“Just a few more minutes,” I holler, picking up my pace, but not so quickly that I skip steps.

 

“I really need to get going,” Nancy urges, looking anxiously out the window into the employee parking lot. “You don’t think that man from earlier is still hanging around, do you?”

 

“He’s probably long gone by now.” I say with too much confidence, my gaze drifting to the lot where Nancy has been staring, biting her nails and tensing her shoulders.

 

“You see anything out there, Nancy?” I ask humorously, hoping to lighten the unease that now makes my skin crawl.

 

“No, no,” she replies, uncertainty clouding her eyes. “It’s just… darker than it usually is.”

 

I almost brush it off but can’t shake the feeling that something’s not right. The parking lot is darker than usual, the lights barely doing their job.

 

“If you can wait just a few, I’ll walk with you,” I offer, sounding more like a question than a solid plan.

 

She hesitates, considers it for a moment, then says, “Don’t worry about it.” She pulls her phone from her purse, “I’ll be fine.” Her confidence feels brittle as she flips on her flashlight, “Good night, Jett.”

 

I look up from the security cameras to say goodnight, but Nancy is already gone. 

 

I hear a sound—maybe a shuffle or a footfall—but I push it aside when my phone buzzes. It’s Skye, my little sister. I answer, eager to redirect my thoughts.

 

“Hey, you still picking me up at 8?” she asks, sounding a bit worried that I might be late again. 

 

“Yeah, I’m right on schedule,” I reply, trying to keep it brief. The old pinky promise we made as kids rings in my ears, a reminder: I need to be there for her—no excuses. 

 

I finish up securing the building and grab my keys to head out. As I step outside, I listen to the door click shut behind me. I glance toward the parking lot, where Nancy should’ve been walking, but I don’t see her. It’s hard to tell in the low light, but I think I can see her silhouette on the far side of the lot.

 

“Jett? You still there?” My sister’s voice pulls me back.

 

“Yeah, yeah, I’m here,” I say, stepping further into the lot. I hear another shuffling sound, not as easy to ignore this time. I walk a little faster, squinting toward where I thought I saw Nancy, but I don’t see her anymore. I notice her car is still parked with the engine off.

 

“I’m leaving now, sis. I’ll be there in fifteen minutes,” I say.

 

“Okay, I’ll be ready!” she chirps, blissfully unaware. I hang up my phone, slipping it into my pocket. The thought of a coffee or a stroll by the river quickly vanishes beneath the urgency of keeping my promise.

 

 

I squint again toward Nancy’s car, but now I’m certain—there’s no sign of her. A prickling sensation rises along the back of my neck when I remember that she’d been in such a hurry to get going. I try to push down the thought of that creepy man from earlier—how he might be involved somehow. Why else would she have just left her car here? 

 

My feet scrape across the pavement. That shuffling sound again. Only this time it’s closer—almost like it’s right behind me. I spin around, but there’s nothing there. My eyes pinball around the lot. I hold my breath, trying to listen, but other than the distant sounds of typical city life, I don’t hear anything out of the ordinary. 

 

""Stop it,"" I mutter to myself. ""You’re just imagining things.""

 

I tell myself to just leave—that I’m overthinking all of this. Nancy was probably in a hurry because maybe she was catching a ride with a friend who was waiting outside for her. But, no, surely I would have seen a vehicle in the parking lot. And Nancy would have mentioned that when I offered to walk out with her. 

 

Then, something catches my eye—her keys. Hanging from the lock in her driver’s side door. All the flashy keychains and accessories shining little reflections of light. They’re just dangling there. Nancy wouldn’t leave these behind, would she? I find myself standing before her car door, and reach for her keys. My thumb runs over the smooth surface of the key fob. The metal should be warm since she’d been holding her keys since before she walked out to leave. But they are ice cold in my hand. 

 

My gut tightens, that sense of something not right deepening. I glance back at the aquarium doors, the huge tanks beyond. Just then, the parking lot lights flicker—just once, but enough to make me see spots. I pocket her keys and look around, blinking away the spots, hoping to catch a glimpse of something—anything—that makes sense of this. 

 

But, nothing. 

 

I wonder if I should go back inside, check the cameras again, just to make sure Nancy left on her own. But a gnawing feeling keeps me rooted to the spot—telling me that if I don’t walk away now, I’ll regret it. 

 

That man’s words replay in my mind, like a warning or a taunt. I glance back toward the aquarium, see the massive fish tanks, how the lights mix with the strange shapes across the pavement. 

 

“Maybe it’s just paranoia,” I think, but I can't shake the idea that something more is going on.

 

I force myself to get into my car, struggling to keep control of my own movements. My hands move in slow motion, my feet feel like they’re two steps behind me. The key slips twice before I manage to turn it in the ignition. 

 

“I just need to drive, get out of here, clear my head,” plays repeatedly inside my head. The parking lot appears unfamiliar all of a sudden, and the lights phasing in and out make my head ache. I breathe in short bursts, desperate to calm down—determined to fulfill my promise with Skye. If I go now, I can still make it in time, then I can get to the bottom of whatever happened with Nancy.  

 

The engine roars to life, much louder than it should against the empty asphalt. As I pull away I fight the urge to look in the rearview mirror. 

 

“Don’t look back,” I demand myself. “Don’t look back.”

 

I peel out of the parking lot faster than I realize, barely missing the curb. Then, I slam the brakes, pulling off to the side of the road when I spot a figure sprawled on the sidewalk. My stomach drops. “Please don’t let that be Nancy.” 

 

As I jerk forward, my chest smacks against the wheel. I pull in closer, the figure just out of reach of the headlights. But I can see that it is a woman laying there—her hair is the same color, and her coat—it’s the same one she always wore to work.

 

I stay frozen in my seat, unable to move. Then she sits up, looks directly at me. I flinch. It looks like she’s waiting for me. I swing the door open and stumble out, confused but fueled by a desperation that’s propelling me toward her.

 

""Nancy!"" I call out, stumbling into the shoulder of the road, arm outstretched, ""Are you alright? What are you doing out here?""

 

“Nancy!” I shout again, desperate for a response, but she doesn’t speak. She doesn’t move.

 

I try to clear the unfamiliar onset of a strange haze clouding my mind. It’s as if life itself has turned on me—made me the enemy. Everything around me seems to behave independently, as if objects somehow sprang to life.  I shake my head and rub my eyes, but my surroundings remain distorted. Everything runs together, sludgy and syrupy. 

 

As disturbing as this is, I can’t just leave Nancy laying here. I run toward her, unsure of what I’ll be able to do to help, but sure I’ll figure something out once I reach her.

 

As I get closer, the edges of her form blur, like a photo out of focus. The streetlights towering ominously above me laugh in a hushed, humming tone—mocking me.

 

I leap towards Nancy, but by the time I reach the spot, she’s gone. I scramble, grabbing at the empty ground. “Wha-what? She was just here.” I mutter to myself, glued to the pavement. Panic surges through me, sharp and bitter. 

 

I look up into the streetlights again—they’re watching, laughing, like this is some sick joke. I stand up cursing at the lights, “Damn you!” I shout at the top of my lungs, “What have you done with Nancy?” but the lights just stare back, refusing to answer. 

 

I storm off and head back to my car when suddenly, from behind me, red and blue lights flash. A voice booms through a speaker. “Sir, step away from the vehicle.”

 

“Oh, good!” I praise the moment with my arms raised overhead, “Thank God, you’re here!” I run towards the officers car, now shielding my eyes from the strobe. 

 

“You have to hurry, please!” I begged the officer, tapping on his window, gesturing for him to roll it down, but he doesn’t. He just sits in his vehicle staring at me. Hope quickly turns to worry. Then I hear the voice come over the speaker again—it’s the officer. He’s commanding me to back away from the road, “Get down on your knees and place your hands behind your head!” 

 

What? No, this isn’t happening. 

 

Slowly, I back away, bewildered. 

 

They’re talking to me? For what? I didn’t do anything! 

 

Before I know it, they’re on me, forcing my hands behind my back. “Wait, you don’t understand,” I shout, struggling to keep my voice steady. “Nancy’s missing! I just saw her—she was right there!”

 

But my words come out in jumbles, running together like ink on damp paper. The officer’s face appears before me, glaring with impatience and disbelief. But no matter how much I shout, how loud I plea for them to hear me out, they don’t listen—they never do. My chest ignites with rage. I can hear the voice of one of the officer’s—the one leading me to the squad car—but it’s like my brain has turned to mush because I don’t understand a single word.

 

How can they be arresting me? Nancy’s missing, and it's like no one cares.

 

They don’t waste any time before they shove me into the back of the car. I look out the window hoping to see things correctly, as they should be again. But still, everything looks like it’s not real—like a painting or a cartoon. Or maybe it just seems that way because inanimate objects are moving on their own, or shaking, or melting. But I know that that’s impossible!

 

I rest my forehead against the window and focus on my breathing. Just then, the officer mans the vehicle and cuts off the flashing lights. 

 

“What’s going on?” I manage to ask the officer as he shifts to drive. “Where are you taking me?”

 

He draws in a deep breath, “We’ve seen this happen before,” he exhales, “we’re going to take care of you. Just sit back and relax.”

 

It was then when I realized how tense I was. I became hyper aware of my body and I swear it was like I could feel my insides operating, like I could hear beeping, or clicking from inside of me. Panic set in.

 

I see my phone light up a little way off in the distance, right where I thought Nancy was. “That’s probably my sister wondering where I am!” I shout, thrashing in the back seat. “Wait, we can’t leave—my sister!” 

 

The officer shakes his head, keeping his eyes forward. “Your sister isn’t here,” he says in a calm voice, pulling out of the parking space. As we pull away, one of the officers picks up my phone and puts it into his pocket.

 

When we reach the station, they take me down a hallway and sit me in a room with nothing but a table and a few chairs. The walls are blank and colored the same shade of gray as the floor and ceiling. I take a seat at the empty metal table to await my fate. It isn’t long before a detective enters, carrying a file, looking at me but saying nothing. He holds his face so sure and still that I struggle to gain any clues to what he might be thinking. Then takes a seat across the table from me and opens the file. 

 

He spreads out photographs across the table. Pictures of me at different points during the night—standing outside the aquarium, yelling at the streetlights, and shouting at no one on the sidewalk. I lean in closer to get a better look, but there’s no sign of Nancy in any of the photos.

 

“Care to explain this?” he asks overly calm, almost deliberate. 

 

I shake my head. “No, that can’t be right. Nancy was there. I saw her.”

 

He sighs, then gives me a look of pity. “We’ve seen this kind of thing before.” He starts collecting the photos, individually placing each one back into his file. “A couple of other patrons mentioned two regulars who like to slip something into people’s drinks from time to time… It makes them see things—things that aren’t there.”

 

“No, you don’t understand. I wasn’t hallucinating. She was right there. You have to believe me.”

 

He slides the file across the table, folds his hands and continues, “We’ve been tracking those two for a while. They come around every few weeks, pick a spot, and disappear just as quickly. You were just unlucky enough to be their latest project.”

 

 

I want to argue, to insist that I know what I saw, but the memory of Nancy’s face—the way it blurred when I approached her, how she simply vanished when I tried to help her up—it’s as though someone is pulling it from my mind.

 

Then the detective spreads out another series of photographs, but this time they are of other people who I don’t recognize.

 

“Recognize anyone?”  

 

“No.”

 

He pushes the pictures towards me, “You sure about that?” 

 

I examine the pictures again, more closely this time. “No, wait.” I stuttered, “I think I do recognize someone—two of them, actually.”

 

 

The detective raises an eyebrow, his eyes prompt me to continue. 

 

 

“Him,” I point to one of the photos. “He was at the aquarium tonight. He was yelling at one of my employees, saying some weird stuff that had us spooked.

“And who else did you recognize?”

 

 

I nod with my head at the last photo. It’s of a woman with the same hair and sharp facial lines—exactly like the lady that was begging to stay late. 

 

 

The detective puts away the remaining photos, which tells me that I’ve helped their investigation in some way—that I must have picked the people he’d been hoping I would. 

 

 

“What’s this all about?” I ask after some time.

 

 

The detective looks up from the files. “It’s about a series of incidents in the city, now connected to the aquarium,” he sounds like he’s reading a script. “People have gone missing, and we believe the pattern might be linked to what happened tonight.”

 

 

“Missing? You mean… like Nancy?”

 

 

He nods, confirming my fears. “Yes. We’re trying to piece together what happened during your last closing shift. You said something odd occurred, right? That man’s comments… they seemed to stand out.”

 

 

“Yeah. He made a remark about how ‘strange things’ happen after hours,” I reply, the taste of the words made me sick to my stomach, “I didn’t think much of it then.”

 

 

“Perhaps you should have,” he says, leaning closer with disapproval in his eyes. “People don’t just vanish without reason. We're looking into surveillance footage from the area, but any detail you can provide could be crucial.”

 

 

A lump forms in my throat as I rack my brain. I tell him about the rude, sarcastic lady, about Nancy’s hurried departure, and of course, that man’s creepy comment. “I didn’t see anything else out of the ordinary, but…” I hesitate, “There was a moment when I thought I heard something—just before I left the building, and again in the parking lot.”

 

 

“Anything you remember about it?” he presses, pulling out a yellow legal pad, clicking his pen.

 

 

“It was like a shuffle, I thought it might’ve been someone moving behind me, but when I turned around, there was no one there. I assumed it was just my imagination.” I admitted, trying to hide the frustration I felt towards myself for not having been more vigilant in the moment. 

 

 

The detective nods, jotting down my words. “Even small details matter. We need to keep a record of everything. The missing persons report includes multiple individuals who were at your aquarium recently. We’re hoping you can provide something—anything—that can link them together.”

 

 

I can’t help but feel guilty for not having been more precautious—for letting Nancy leave by herself. I had been too selfish, I wanted to leave, to get home to my sister. 

 

 

“Do you think that man had something to do with it?” I ask.

 

 

“It's possible. We’re digging into his background. Your description of him and the interaction may give us a lead,” the detective replies, glancing at the two photos on the table.

 

 

With a heavy heart, I stare at the images of the familiar faces.

 

 

“Is there any way I can help?” I murmur.

 

 

“You already have. Just keep your eyes open and let us know if you remember anything else,” the detective says, packing away the files. 

 

 

As he stands to leave, I suddenly realize that this isn’t just about Nancy. It’s something much larger than what happened at the aquarium. And now, I’ve been dragged into it.

 

 

The detective leaves as quickly as he'd arrived, leaving me to my thoughts. I stand up, pacing the room. Why had Nancy been so eager to leave? The urgency in her voice plays on repeat. She had clearly been rattled before she left, but in the chaos of the evening, I dismissed it. Had she sensed something that I had failed to?

The aquarium is supposed to be a haven for marine life, a place of wonder, yet an awful crime had been brewing just under my nose.

 

 

When I'm released, my phone is handed back to me, the battery down to nine percent. I step out through the front door, seeing several missed calls from Skye. It’s after ten p.m. now—she’s probably freaking out. I dial her back immediately, but after two rings, it goes to voicemail.

 

 

“Oh, come on.” I grumble, trying again. Still no answer. Then, a text from her lights up the screen: *""Don’t bother. I found a ride home, Jett.""

 

 

A tear rolls down my cheek as I reply, ""I'm just glad you're okay. Something awful happened tonight, beyond my control. I'm so sorry.""

 

 

My car is parked a few blocks away, and I’m halfway there when my phone buzzes with her response: ""Yeah, you’re right, something awful did happen tonight.""

 

 

I start to type back, ""No, listen, you don't underst—"" but the screen goes dark. My phone’s dead.

 

 

“Goddamn it!” I shout up into the night sky.

 

 

The rest of the walk blurs by. When I finally reach my car, I stop, looking back at the sidewalk, half-expecting to see Nancy there, but of course she isn't there. She's gone. I can't control the guilt I feel.

 

 

Sliding into the driver’s seat, I close the door, and everything in me unravels. I bury my face in my hands, the pressure crushing me as my breath heightens. I yell, slamming my fists into the dashboard, my anger and sorrow exploding together.

 

 

Then, I freeze. That shuffling sound again—coming from behind me, quiet but unmistakable. I lift my head, looking up into the rearview mirror. My stomach drops. I catch a glimpse of two figures in the back seat, barely discernable against the darkness already so present. I frantically unfasten my seatbelt and fumble with the door handle. Before I can make it out, a cloth presses over my face. I gasp, clawing at the hand holding it. Turning, I see a hint of red, a floral pattern draped over the back seat, but before I can see more, my vision tunnels to black and my muscles go limp.

1gkx4yy,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1gkx4yy/udacity_nanodegree_experience_c749/,Udacity Nano-degree Experience (C749),"This first class is insane. The first objective is to examine a dataset. My last experience with descriptive statistics was AP Stats in highschool, almost seven years ago. I thought there'd be more explanation on how to graph relationships dependent on whether data is categorical or numerical. I've come to understand that continuous numerical data is much more easily visualized with the methodologies employed in the lesson videos. 

Being an idiot, I decided to use a data set they provided that is full of binary categorical data. I'm doing the first project and it's taken me three days to understand a chi-squared value test and what it implies, how to make a function that takes two columns from a dataframe and spits out formatted results for a chi-squared test.

Add another day for making a function to plot bar charts of expected versus actual cross tabs.

I've finally gotten around to making a correlation matrix of the binary categorical variables, and at least Pearson's correlation was somewhat easier to understand. Though it did take me 2 hours of Google searching to arrive at the conclusion that using Pearson's for binary categorical data is fine because you end up with the Phi value.

I've also looked through the lessons on data visualization multiple times and can't see any instances where the instructors or interactive workspaces use seaborn, so I've elected not to use it even though their Jupyter kernel has it installed. I've read so much matplotlib documentation in the past 5 hours, my eyes might fall out. 

Anyway all this is to say that I'm slowly going insane, my brain is full of central measures, r's,  p's, phi's and chi's. I feel like there was a class before this that I missed somehow.

Does anyone have any tips? Has anyone had a similar experience?
