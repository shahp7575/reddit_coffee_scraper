This one certainly is a unique one! So without further ado, please enjoy:

**Arctic Palace**

Opening: grapefruit and oranges on top of whatever I assume is red tea (giving a chai kind of feel here)? It gives a citrusy-spice vibe that is certainly unique. 

Mid: that red tea takes center stage now, supported a bit by the citrus notes.  Projection is ok- I wouldn’t say this is anything to run around and tell the neighbors about, but still respectable. Tonka and vanilla give this and interesting vibe that reminds me a little bit of coffee or brown sugar milk tea in the air. I actually looked around when I smelled it to see if we had left a cup sitting out somewhere. It has an interesting citrus-sweet characteristic that I haven’t smelled in any other fragrance I’ve tried.

Overall: I’ve seen this compared to a urinal puck many times, and while I would agree there are some aspects I could see that are similar, I do believe that this smells better than a urinal puck. 😆 It is certainly an interesting fragrance, and one that would be full bottle worthy if I was more into tea-related fragrances, and it definitely makes me want to try the OG, especially since it’s been 84 years since its last restock.",1,1767588568.0,MontagneParfums,2,1.0,False
1q4cex9,https://i.redd.it/01enqxw9ogbg1.jpeg,I made the switch from Distiller to RO system,"A few weeks ago I posted about using a water distiller for my carnivorous plants. After actually living with it for a bit, I realized it wasn’t the right tool for me!
- lots of heat
- more noise than I expected
- slower in real world use.
- too much clean-up (descaling)

Some comments mentioned that RO systems tend to be quicker and more practical, which lined up with what I was already noticing. I ended up switching to an RO/DI setup, and the install is now fully finalized. I luckily had some room in my laundry closet and things worked out great. I was able to split the cold water feed for my washing machine, thus having an accessible shut off specifically for the RO system.

What I’m liking so far:
- Much quieter
- No extra heat dumped into the room
- Continuous water instead of batch distilling
- Easy to dial water quality for different plant types

Tap water here is roughly 175 ppm. I’m now running different mixes depending on use:
- Carnivorous plants: 0 ppm (pure RO/DI)
- Succulents & cacti: 30-50 ppm
- Tropicals: 40-60 ppm
- Coffee: 75 ppm (for the wife, lol)

I added an 8 L (2.1 gallon) storage jug. 
Production rate is about 8.8 L in 1h20m (2.3 gallons), which seems pretty reasonable for a 50 GPD membrane.

Everything’s been running smoothly so far. If anyone spots something questionable or has suggestions, I’m happy to hear it, but overall I’m really happy I made the switch.

TL;DR Switched from Distiller to RO system based on sub feedback. Very thankful I did. ",1,1767588553.0,SavageGarden,0,1.0,False

Again, I didn't think much of it until we started planning to go on a trip. I planned everything from where we would go, where we would stay, and activities. I was ready to book, but it was all quite expensive, so I told her I'd cover the lodging (the most expensive part) and asked her to chip in for the rest

Well, she didn't take it well. She basically said no and said she would ""feel better about it"" if I could pay for everything

I asked her if this is because it's out of her current situation or because she expects me to pay for everything, all the time. And her response was that it's both

She also added that we're in a ""dating situation"" instead of a ""relationship"" so she expects me to pay for everything

I told her that I value reciprocity and equal effort and that I don't feel comfortable paying for everything and she left me on read

I think I’m just after some advice. My partner (30/M) and I have been together for 2.5 years. He has really incredible mates. They are all so down to earth, consistent, friendly and warm. I love them and I look forward to spending time with them. When he goes out with them, I love hearing about what they talk about and get up to. However, I do not like his best mate (30/M) who he has been friends with his whole life. At all. His best mate is different around all groups. I’ve never seen the same version twice. We have had conflict where he yelled at me at my partner’s birthday because we had a difference of opinion on education and political matters (I’m a teacher). He has this masculine “big guy” energy. I just cannot stand him. I have tried. I have initiated a coffee catch up to hash out our differences after he yelled at me. Which I went to and it was seemingly okay. I have also trained with him (he’s a PT) for 6 weeks where he BARELY asked me any questions about myself, it was all about him and his goals. 

I vented to my partner today and it’s upset him (to be fair, I wasn’t gentle about it). At the same time, he’s not upset AT me. He’s just disappointed it’s like this. While my partner said he can agree with many of the things I’ve said, he says it’s changed things for how we spend time with his best mate in the future as he’s now uncomfortable. I understand this and I’m not discrediting his feelings at all. I seldomly see his best mate anyway but I feel TERRIBLE. I don’t want my partner to feel he can’t hang out with his best mate. I would just like some advice on how I can better manage this or what your thoughts are. I can hear hard truths.

TL;DR: I don’t like my partner’s best friend. I vented this out and it’s upset him and it’s changed how he will or won’t invite him to things. I feel terrible. How do I manage this?",1,1767587915.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

I just need to vent.  Not really sure how to even condense this so bare with me, please.

Some background info: I'm 27 and he is 36 - I was 22 when we started dating and he had just turned 31. We have two kids together, but three at home total. I had one child before my bf and he had two children before me with two different women, but his kids live in other states and we don't see them, nor does he have contact with his oldest (his kid's mom blocked my ""partner"" and his entire family years ago) We have been together for 5 years - living together for over 4 years. He lived a state away and moved to my state/city when I found out I was pregnant. That was the first time I ever lived on my own let alone with somebody else as I lived at my mom's with my oldest while I went to school and worked part-time. I had my oldest at 18. Now we moved back to his home state/city and rent a house that his parent's bought for us to live in. 

Ok, now onto the hardships and stories...

  
Our relationship has always been rocky and I've always struggled with trust issues well before he moved to my city. His friend group had always been problematic. He went out all time and didn't have a job. He was 31 with friends closer to my age or even in college and would frequent college bars every time they went out. That should've been my first red flag. He does have friends his age but they moved out of state and started their own lives. He lived with a roommate that to this day has no job other than dealing I guess. 

After moving to my hometown and getting a place together he spent 90% of his time on his phone, watching sports or youtube, or playing COD/warzone with his friends and talking to his friends all night. He would play for for 8-12 hours a day. The  3.5 years he lived there he had about six different jobs, the last job being one my dad had gotten him which he did stay with for over a year. Anyway, our oldest together was born after three months of us living together. The first five months of our her life, her and I slept on the couch because he would get frustrated with her waking up so often when he had to work.

When we first got our place, he was jobless and I took out student loans to pay deposit, first months, and the first few months. Fast forward nine months we moved to a new, better apartment, he was starting another new job so again I used student loans to pay deposit and first two months. I got a part-time job and contributed. Again, same story, he just wasn't a present parent or partner. His priority was a screen and talking to his friends. He never took the kids to do anything nor would he want to do anything as a family. Every time he went back home he would go out with friends. Fast forward to our daughter being 1.5 we decided we shouldn't be together and I found out he had cheated two months into our relationship at the beginning. He moved back and stayed with his friend but a month later we decided we could give it another shot as he promised all of these changes. A month after that I found out I was pregnant with our second. After our second was born (at 2am), he went home at 7am (I still haven't slept while he napped at the hospital) and he left me at the hospital 5 hours postpartum and was gone for 2+ hours (who knows how much longer if I wasn't blowing up his phone). He went home and showered and watched Youtube while drinking coffee and whatever else he did. About a month later the night before mother's day, he tried to leave me and go back home so he could go out with friends and leave me with the kids. After pleading, he stayed but went back the following weekend.

A few months go by and I went on his phone after he got home from work and went to shower. His most recent app open was the app store and pulled up was an lgbtq app ""Taimi"". I re-downloaded it and put in his credentials, and low and behold he had an account. He said he forgot the app was on his phone and he went and deleted it, but that doesn't explain why he had it open on the app store, right? Before I asked him about the app, I also downloaded grindr and saw he had an account on there too but it was older pictures. His bio talked about looking for nice butt bottoms. Those accts were made with yahoo emails, and for some reason I thought of trying his apple id login too and he had accounts with his icloud email as well, so he had two accounts per app. He told me he just wanted to see what they were about and if trans women actually looked good???? I also went to his files app and saw that he had a deleted file that linked to a video on a g@y corn site. Earlier in the year, his google acct was logged in on my laptop and I saw his google search history of g@y corn sites specifically looking up big booty tr@ns. He denied everything and ofc i gave him the benefit of the doubt both times. We moved on, but I've never really been able to shake the thought. December of 2024 came and we still aren't getting along, he called me out of my name and that was it I was done. He still lived in the apartment, as he was the one paying for it bc I was only working part time. He moved out at the end of February 2025 and into his parents house to care for their home as they moved across the country for a job. He and I both paid the rent while he was gone, come May 2025 he's begging to get back together and he was going to change and all this BS. I caved and thought well it would be good financially, the kids would get to see their dad, I get some help and whatever. This time he wanted us to move to his state. I agreed and thought we were turning a new leaf.... July came and his parents bought a second house and then August came and we moved into it. September came and one weekend I took the kids and myself back home to visit my family. I set up the camera in the living room and on Saturday night/Sunday morning at Two Thirty AM he broke the camera. That following monday I had seen something about another person that prompted me to just check his laptop. His search history shocked me. Earlier in the year he had another search about tr@ns women and lgtbq sites.. but this time over the weekend was much worse. I saw him searching stuff about dogs and women. Women getting ... by dogs. I took pictures and video of the extensive search for proof. He told me it was a fb thing where this lady was talking about how people were freaking out that she did that and he said he was trying to find the whole story. I do not believe him.... it just doesn't add up. I'm going to leave and move back home but I've been stuck and I'm trying to create my exit plan. We just established care here and transferred schools... I have no job and no support. I have no friends or family here and his parents are out of state working. How do I even leave when my family is in another state  and I don't have any income??? Anyway, he has been sleeping in the basement ever since and contact is minimal and he is never alone with our kids and I will never allow for that. Part of me is feeling guilty for planning this leave because my kids love their dad... they love this house and having their own room and so much space, they love having a fenced in yard to run around in. I fear how they'll feel moving into an apartment..and having to share bedrooms. I also feel guilty because right now there hasn't been arguing so how do I just get up and leave after so much time has passed. I know, I know that leaving is the best and safest things to do and I'm going to do it. I'm just trying to figure out how. I'm scared of the what ifs. What if I don't find a good job, what if I can't pay my bills, what if I can't pay my debt, what if I can't give my kids a good life? Right now, I have a cushion. I'm scared to fail. 

Also adding, MY oldest has learning and behavioral disabilities and ASD.. and has never been treated fairly. He says my oldest is fully capable of understanding and doing right, and he treats my child as if they function as a neurologically normal child. It seems like he resents my child and me most of the time. He never makes time for my child when all my child wants is his attention.

These last few years I've been brain washed and made small by a narcissist. I just want to be in my own space, find myself again, and be a better parent to my kids. I want to be happy again. I want to become me. My entire 20's has been made small and I've been in survival mode. I'm tired of surviving.. I want to breath and live again. ",1,1767587810.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

I am starting to feel like the novelty of starting Wellbutrin has begun to wear off. 
The first month was amazing - I was so active and doing so much shit and now I’m on month 4 and I find myself starting to bed rot more often and just feel overall tired again. 

When I first started the medicine I feel like my calendar was booked and busy and I’ve found myself canceling plans again. 
Im also feeling more apathetic to things and noticing I feel more “bothered”. 

I’m doing my best to fight through it by limiting social media, doing dry January and really challenging myself to get out in the world again. I went to a new coffee shop today and finished a book that’s been staring at me for like 4 months…so taking the small wins where I can. 

It’s starting to feel like pulling teeth to get shit done whereas the first month on Wellbutrin was so magical. 

Did anyone else experience this? 
Did you up your dosage? Did that help? 

Is this just what living feels like?!

1q4bwiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1q4bwiz/grieving/,Grieving,"Back in 2024 around June I lost my niam tais(Grandma) and in my culture(Hmong culture) we differentiate between my dads mom as poj and my mom's mom as niam tais. So a year a half ago I lost my niam tais and to Leukemia, and she was battling it for over 2 years, and when her medication stopped working and they'd put her on hospice it was extremely devastating for my family. Then a week before her birthday she was barely breathing, wasn't eating, couldnt talk and wouldn't even open her eyes, and later that morning she passed away at 7:34 am. And after her funeral and obviously I was super sad, because she lived in a different state and I couldnt visit her as often. 

Than my poj, my dad's mom right. She has never been very fond of my mom, and sometimes wasn't to us, but she still played a big role in my life. She was battling End-Stage Renal Disease, which for those who dont know what that is, its where someone's kidneys basically aren't functioning as well anymore so she constantly needed to go to dialysis. 

Then maybe 3 months after my niam raises funeral on a car ride somewhere my mom was telling me ""You know even though your grandma is not very nice to our family, you should still cherish, appreciate, and spend time with her while shes still with us, because shes your only real grandma you have left.""

She was very much right. My dad's side of the problems was with my parents, it wasn't with me nor my siblings. So we started taking my grandma for 2 days each week. Me and my siblings got very close with her despite the language barrier. We only understand enough to where we can get at what she was trying to say. She was hard if hearing and on top of that she had dementia, so we only talked to her whenever she had her hearing aids in. And it was sad every time she asked a question over and over again. Than the weekend of November 21st of 2025 she had a stroke. I visited her that entire weekend, and than on November 23rd, she wasn't opening her eyes, she wasn't talking to anyone, she wasn't eating food, drinking water. 

And for context, my older sisters name is Nadia and mines is Belle like the princess. She would always mistaken me for my sister, and it was always hilarious. 

But she didnt call for me or my sister, she didnt ask us for coffee, she didnt ask for noodles or sweets. She wouldn't move. She was so still, her feet were pale, purple and a blue colored mix. Her feet were so cold, her hands were so cold even though she had 5 blankets on her and her breathing was so uneven and fast. She wouldn't open her eyes when I begged and quietly whispered to her in hmong, ""Please dont go"" , ""Grandma, please wake up..""

Unfortunately shortly after I had to leave because it was almost 1am and my family lives all the way across town. So we left that night. But than shortly later, around 4am, my grandma passed away. It wss the fastest I'd ever gotten out of bed. I stayed the whole morning, didnt go to school, and waited with her. I held her hand the entire morning up until they took her.

I haven't seen her since, and when new years came I was so sad. Because in 2024 I went into 2025 with one grandma and then going into 2026, im going in with no grandmas.

I have cried so much, I have cried so hard to thebpoint I feel like my head is gonna explode or I get super dizzy.

1q4buq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1q4buq5/i_analyzed_2908_writing_streaks_from_1134_writers/,"I analyzed 2,908 writing streaks from 1,134 writers. Writers who logged hour-long sessions quit after 2 days. Less ambitious writers with 6-minute sessions wrote 250,000+ words in 2025.","Writers who logged hour-long sessions on their first day lasted a mere 2 days before quitting. These writers produced a maximum of 17,000 words the entire year.

Writers with 100+ day streaks averaged just 6 minutes before taking a break. Sometimes their sessions lasted a mere twenty seconds. But most of these writers produced over 250,000 words in 2025.

# The 2-day heroic writer

You know this writer. I've been this writer.

They clear their Sunday afternoon. They brew the good coffee. They silence their phones. Two hours later, they’re done for the week. Possibly for the month.

When you try to write every day for an hour, it becomes a significant life commitment. It competes with the gym, family time, and sleep. It requires motivation. And motivation is the first thing that disappears when life gets messy.

# What the productive writers actually do

Writers who finish books don't have sacred morning rituals. They don't write at the same time every day. They don't wait for inspiration. They write whenever they have a few spare minutes. They average six minutes per session, three times per day.

No ritual. No warm-up. Just open the document, add a paragraph, close the document.

And somehow that adds up to almost two novels in twelve months.

# The Saturday trap

Forty percent of the streaks I analyzed ended on a Saturday.

Saturday should be a writer’s paradise. No commute. No meetings. Endless free time. But that's the problem.

On weekdays, writers squeeze their 6-minute sessions between obligations. This constraint creates urgency. But Saturday arrives with its wide-open schedule, and suddenly the pressure appears.

Today, you can do more than just fix that paragraph you were working on last night. The goal to “just write something” has become “write something good.”

Before you know it, Saturday has ended. And you still haven’t written.

# Lower the bar for what counts as success

Six-minute writers aren't trying to be great. They're not even trying to be good. They're just adding words. Some days it turns into twenty minutes because they're on a roll. But they never force it.

Six-minute writers don’t have any particular goal in mind. They just write something. Anything. But they do it every day.

Do that enough times, and you’ll accidentally write a book.",0,1767586929.0,writing,1,0.14,False

I know in my heart that the Catholic Church is where I want to be. 

I have attended a couple different parishes, and the one thing that I have noticed is nobody in church goes out of their way to meet you. Which I understand that mass is a time between yourself and God. Which is great. But in contrast, when you are a first time visitor at a protestant church, they will often greet you and chat with you before or after service. Then before you know it they are inviting you to their coffee hour and bible study and you already have their name and phone number. It can be a little overwhelming at times as a shy person like me, but at least people know me and acknowledge that I might be new. 

The particular parish I am attending, I have been going for about 3 months now. Its a big congregation with five different weekend masses. As a shy person, it is hard for me to go out of my way to introduce myself. An inquiry class for OCIA starts in the new year and hopefully I will start the actual OCIA class when it starts in May (They have a couple that start in the year). Is OCIA a way to meet people? Especially since they are going through a similar journey? As a single guy, going to church by myself can feel somewhat lonely. Even though I have been attending for 3 months, I think the only person from the church that knows me by my first name is the OCIA coordinator! 

TL;DR: How did you meet people/make friends at your church? Should I join other ministries or is the OCIA inquiry class a good start?",2,1767586508.0,Catholicism,3,1.0,False

The first time, she took a blade meant for Cole Quin. Pure instinct.


It collapsed her lung.


Cole spent that whole night on his knees in the hospital chapel, begging gods he'd stopped believing in to take him instead.


The second time, they were ambushed. Six men with orders to make them disappear.


One pulled a hunting knife, angled it straight at Cole's ribs.


Raina slammed into him sideways, took the blade herself again.


It missed her heart by half an inch.


Outside the OR, Cole had a scalpel pressed to the surgeon's throat, eyes wild and bloodshot.


""She dies, you ALL fucking die.""


But the third time?


No ambush. No rivals.


Just Cole and the woman he kept in a Russian Hill penthouse.


And this time, the blade went into her belly. Seven months pregnant.


She lost the baby.


And any chance of having another.


Ten years of blind, stupid devotion—and this was what it got her.


Good.


Now she knew exactly what he deserved.


...


Pain dragged Raina awake.


Voices filtered through the fog.


""...the baby didn't make it."" Marcus. Cole's right hand. ""Uterine damage is severe. She won't be able to carry again.""


A beat of silence.


Then Cole's voice cut through, low and deadly: ""Handle it. Get Vivian out of the city. Tonight.""


""At once, Don.""


Footsteps faded.


Raina's hand trembled. She slid it down to her stomach.


Bandages. Thick and stiff.


She pressed down.


Empty.


Yesterday, she'd felt him kick—tiny fists pounding against her ribs, fierce and alive.


Now there was nothing. Just emptiness where her son used to be.


And Cole wasn't grieving at all.


He was even protecting the woman who'd murdered their son.


Tears spilled over, hot and soundless.


Two more months.


Just two more fucking months, and her baby would have lived!


Her fingers twisted into the sheets, knuckles bone-white.


She wasn't stupid.


This was a private suite. Armed guards rotating every six hours. A nurse who never left her side.


But yesterday, when Vivian walked in with that knife—coincidentally, the guards were switching shifts.


Coincidentally, the nurse got called away for some bullshit emergency.


Too many coincidences.


Only one man had the power to clear that room.


Raina let out a bitter laugh.


She'd spent ten years watching her back against enemies, rivals, men who wanted Cole dead.


But she'd never thought to guard herself against HIM.


The man she'd bled for. The man she'd taken bullets for.


He hated her for what she'd done to Vivian. Hated her for taking away that woman's baby.


So he'd let Vivian take hers.


A son for a son. Blood for blood.


You fucking monster.


She felt the tears burn, soundless. But underneath the grief, something else was happening.


Something cold. Something sharp.


Ten years of blind, stupid devotion—and this was what it got her.


Good.


Now she knew exactly what he deserved.


Chapter 2


""You're awake.""


Cole's voice came out rough.


""I took care of Vivian."" He was watching her face, trying to keep the panic out of his own voice. ""She lost it. Went too far. But you pushed her there, Rai. You can't do what you did and expect no blowback.""


He reached for her face—wanted to wipe away the tears.


She turned away.


His hand hung in the air. Then dropped.


His expression stayed flat, but something dark flickered in his eyes.


""It's done. It was just a pregnancy. We'll have another one.""


His face didn't change. Just cold, transactional indifference.


""Cole."" Raina's voice came out wrecked, barely more than a rasp.


""Drop the act. You let this happen. You WANTED this to happen. You sick fuck.""


For a second, she saw panic crack through his mask.


But then his jaw set, and the guilt vanished.


He reached for her hand where it lay on top of the blanket. Cold. Lifeless.


He rubbed it between his palms.


""You don't get to play victim here, Rai. You did the exact same thing.


""I got on my knees. I BEGGED you. Let you grind my face into the dirt. And you still sent Vivian to that clinic without blinking.


""She took what you owed her. That's all this was.""


Raina's eyes went red from rage burning so hot.


""What she was carrying? Some random bastard's mistake! What I was carrying? YOUR SON!""


Cole's face changed. Anger flared in his eyes.


""Don't insult me. We both know whose baby was the mistake.""


Raina stared at him.


And suddenly it all clicked into place.


He thought she'd cheated. Thought the baby was someone else's.


That's why he'd let Vivian do it.


She laughed.


""You're going to regret this, Cole. I promise you that.""


Something twisted in his chest. He crushed it down.


""Regret what? Getting rid of a bastard? You killed my kid. Vivian killed yours. We're square. It's over. I'll keep her away from you, and we move on.""


""Square."" Raina repeated the word like she was tasting poison. ""Move on.""


A mistress's bastard.


And a son she'd fought through hell to give him.


How the fuck was that even REMOTELY the same?


And after everything he'd done, he actually thought they could just... what? Pretend it never happened?


All she wanted now was to watch him burn.


""You'll PAY. Both of you.""


Cole's grip on her hand tightened. Over a bastard, she was actually ready to turn on him.


He looked at her—pale, hollow, drowning in hate—and for half a second, regret stabbed through him again.


But he shoved it down.


This wasn't on him.


SHE'D betrayed him. SHE'D gotten pregnant with another man's child.


How could she be that cruel?


He'd never raise some other man's bastard. Never.


That baby had to go.


And besides—she'd owed Vivian this.


He just hadn't expected Vivian to go that far with the knife.


But it was fine. He'd already told Vivian it was over. From now on, he'd stay with Raina. Make it right.


Even if she couldn't have kids anymore, he'd be there.


As for Vivian—she'd been his. Carried his child, even though it didn't make it. He owed her something.


""Vivian crossed a line. I'll pay her debt.""


With that, he grabbed the fruit knife off the nightstand.


And drove it straight into his forearm.


He grunted through clenched teeth.


""That's for her.""


Without hesitation, he ripped it out and stabbed himself again.


""That's for me.""


Raina's eyes burned redder.


And just like that, the memory slammed back—the day she'd walked in on them.


Chapter 3


Cole stood between them, body angled to shield Vivian.


""This is on me, Rai. Not her. You want to hurt someone? Hurt me.""


Raina stared at him—this man who'd sworn to protect her, now using that same body to protect another woman.


Bile surged up her throat.


She swallowed it down through sheer force of will.


Her eyes drifted past him to the coffee table.


The fruit knife sitting next to the bowl of apples.


""You want to take responsibility? Prove it.""


She flicked her fingers.


The knife skittered across the table, hit the floor with a sharp CLINK at his feet.


Cole looked down at the blade. Didn't hesitate.


Bent down. Grabbed it. Drove it into his side.


Blood bloomed across his white shirt, spreading fast.


""COLE!""


Vivian screamed and lunged, grabbing his wrist. Tears streamed down her face.


""Stop—you can't—I'm not worth this—let her do whatever she wants to me, just PLEASE—""


""Sure."" Raina's voice cut through the hysteria.


She looked at Vivian with dead eyes. ""Then do what he just did. One cut. Do that, and maybe I let you walk.""


""RAINA!"" Cole's voice came out strangled. ""She's pregnant. Back off.""


He was breathing hard, blood dripping from his fingers.


He raised his trembling hand and pressed it over his heart.


""I said this is on me. You still want blood?""


""Right here. Say the word.""


Raina's eyes burned.


Not from tears. From rage so hot it felt like her veins were on fire.


She held his stare. He held hers.


Neither looked away.


Then Vivian dropped to her knees.


""Please—Ms. Raina—PLEASE. This is my fault. I seduced him. Hate me, not him.""


She slapped herself hard. Once. Twice.


""I'll do anything—just stop hurting him. He's bleeding—doesn't that mean ANYTHING to you?!""


Raina sneered at the scene.


She looked at Vivian's tears. At Cole's bleeding side.


And realized that somehow, she—the WIFE—had become the villain in this fucked-up little play.


Finally, she looked away first.


She turned to leave.


Cole grabbed her wrist.


""I swear, Rai—once the baby's born, she's gone. You'll never see her again. I'll fix this. We can go back to how things were—""


Raina ripped her arm free. Looked down at his blood-soaked sleeve.


""You disgust me.""


Cole went rigid. All the color drained from his face.


Raina walked out.


...


On the drive home, she suddenly started laughing.


Quiet at first. Then harder.


Then the tears came.


She hadn't lost to Vivian's schemes.


She'd lost to HIM. The man she'd loved for ten years.


Lost so completely there was nothing left.


Ten years.


Back then, Cole Quin was muscle-for-hire at a Vegas dive bar. Raina White was a San Francisco heiress who'd never pumped her own gas.


They should never have crossed paths.


But she ran from an arranged marriage, only to stumble into his world.


And from that moment, she gave him everything. Fought her family for him. Bled for him. Built his empire with her money, her name, her LIFE.


She took bullets for him. He killed for her.


They burned through the world together, fused by blood and fire.


She thought it would last forever.


Then he cheated.


When she found out—when she made Vivian get rid of that baby—she thought it would bring him back.


Instead, it pushed him into Vivian's arms.


He protected her. Let her have her way.


And let her knife find its mark in Raina's belly.

We’ve read to our son since he was born, morning and night and nap time and whenever he’d ask. He loved them. Since he turned about 4 he’s not so interested. He prefers the short stories and anything too long and wordy he’s over it. He never asks to read unless it’s a new book. We go to the library and he’s never ever helped me choose books- he just wants to play. He lets me choose and is excited to read them. We go about 2-3x a month. 

I try to read in a fun way. I don’t love reading books myself. I’ve read about two a year to encourage him to see me reading. Admittedly, I am on my phone more than I’d like to admit, mostly Reddit and I just do lots of research- best mattress or recipes or sports for kids or whatever.

1q4bhj4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q4bhj4,The Don's Mistake: Loving Me Cost Him His Family,"Raina White had three scars.


The first time, she took a blade meant for Cole Quin. Pure instinct.


It collapsed her lung.


Cole spent that whole night on his knees in the hospital chapel, begging gods he'd stopped believing in to take him instead.


The second time, they were ambushed. Six men with orders to make them disappear.


One pulled a hunting knife, angled it straight at Cole's ribs.


Raina slammed into him sideways, took the blade herself again.


It missed her heart by half an inch.


Outside the OR, Cole had a scalpel pressed to the surgeon's throat, eyes wild and bloodshot.


""She dies, you ALL fucking die.""


But the third time?


No ambush. No rivals.


Just Cole and the woman he kept in a Russian Hill penthouse.


And this time, the blade went into her belly. Seven months pregnant.


She lost the baby.


And any chance of having another.


Ten years of blind, stupid devotion—and this was what it got her.


Good.


Now she knew exactly what he deserved.


...


Pain dragged Raina awake.


Voices filtered through the fog.


""...the baby didn't make it."" Marcus. Cole's right hand. ""Uterine damage is severe. She won't be able to carry again.""


A beat of silence.


Then Cole's voice cut through, low and deadly: ""Handle it. Get Vivian out of the city. Tonight.""


""At once, Don.""


Footsteps faded.


Raina's hand trembled. She slid it down to her stomach.


Bandages. Thick and stiff.


She pressed down.


Empty.


Yesterday, she'd felt him kick—tiny fists pounding against her ribs, fierce and alive.


Now there was nothing. Just emptiness where her son used to be.


And Cole wasn't grieving at all.


He was even protecting the woman who'd murdered their son.


Tears spilled over, hot and soundless.


Two more months.


Just two more fucking months, and her baby would have lived!


Her fingers twisted into the sheets, knuckles bone-white.


She wasn't stupid.


This was a private suite. Armed guards rotating every six hours. A nurse who never left her side.


But yesterday, when Vivian walked in with that knife—coincidentally, the guards were switching shifts.


Coincidentally, the nurse got called away for some bullshit emergency.


Too many coincidences.


Only one man had the power to clear that room.


Raina let out a bitter laugh.


She'd spent ten years watching her back against enemies, rivals, men who wanted Cole dead.


But she'd never thought to guard herself against HIM.


The man she'd bled for. The man she'd taken bullets for.


He hated her for what she'd done to Vivian. Hated her for taking away that woman's baby.


So he'd let Vivian take hers.


A son for a son. Blood for blood.


You fucking monster.


She felt the tears burn, soundless. But underneath the grief, something else was happening.


Something cold. Something sharp.


Ten years of blind, stupid devotion—and this was what it got her.


Good.


Now she knew exactly what he deserved.


Chapter 2


""You're awake.""


Cole's voice came out rough.


""I took care of Vivian."" He was watching her face, trying to keep the panic out of his own voice. ""She lost it. Went too far. But you pushed her there, Rai. You can't do what you did and expect no blowback.""


He reached for her face—wanted to wipe away the tears.


She turned away.


His hand hung in the air. Then dropped.


His expression stayed flat, but something dark flickered in his eyes.


""It's done. It was just a pregnancy. We'll have another one.""


His face didn't change. Just cold, transactional indifference.


""Cole."" Raina's voice came out wrecked, barely more than a rasp.


""Drop the act. You let this happen. You WANTED this to happen. You sick fuck.""


For a second, she saw panic crack through his mask.


But then his jaw set, and the guilt vanished.


He reached for her hand where it lay on top of the blanket. Cold. Lifeless.


He rubbed it between his palms.


""You don't get to play victim here, Rai. You did the exact same thing.


""I got on my knees. I BEGGED you. Let you grind my face into the dirt. And you still sent Vivian to that clinic without blinking.


""She took what you owed her. That's all this was.""


Raina's eyes went red from rage burning so hot.


""What she was carrying? Some random bastard's mistake! What I was carrying? YOUR SON!""


Cole's face changed. Anger flared in his eyes.


""Don't insult me. We both know whose baby was the mistake.""


Raina stared at him.


And suddenly it all clicked into place.


He thought she'd cheated. Thought the baby was someone else's.


That's why he'd let Vivian do it.


She laughed.


""You're going to regret this, Cole. I promise you that.""


Something twisted in his chest. He crushed it down.


""Regret what? Getting rid of a bastard? You killed my kid. Vivian killed yours. We're square. It's over. I'll keep her away from you, and we move on.""


""Square."" Raina repeated the word like she was tasting poison. ""Move on.""


A mistress's bastard.


And a son she'd fought through hell to give him.


How the fuck was that even REMOTELY the same?


And after everything he'd done, he actually thought they could just... what? Pretend it never happened?


All she wanted now was to watch him burn.


""You'll PAY. Both of you.""


Cole's grip on her hand tightened. Over a bastard, she was actually ready to turn on him.


He looked at her—pale, hollow, drowning in hate—and for half a second, regret stabbed through him again.


But he shoved it down.


This wasn't on him.


SHE'D betrayed him. SHE'D gotten pregnant with another man's child.


How could she be that cruel?


He'd never raise some other man's bastard. Never.


That baby had to go.


And besides—she'd owed Vivian this.


He just hadn't expected Vivian to go that far with the knife.


But it was fine. He'd already told Vivian it was over. From now on, he'd stay with Raina. Make it right.


Even if she couldn't have kids anymore, he'd be there.


As for Vivian—she'd been his. Carried his child, even though it didn't make it. He owed her something.


""Vivian crossed a line. I'll pay her debt.""


With that, he grabbed the fruit knife off the nightstand.


And drove it straight into his forearm.


He grunted through clenched teeth.


""That's for her.""


Without hesitation, he ripped it out and stabbed himself again.


""That's for me.""


Raina's eyes burned redder.


And just like that, the memory slammed back—the day she'd walked in on them.


Chapter 3


Cole stood between them, body angled to shield Vivian.


""This is on me, Rai. Not her. You want to hurt someone? Hurt me.""


Raina stared at him—this man who'd sworn to protect her, now using that same body to protect another woman.


Bile surged up her throat.


She swallowed it down through sheer force of will.


Her eyes drifted past him to the coffee table.


The fruit knife sitting next to the bowl of apples.


""You want to take responsibility? Prove it.""


She flicked her fingers.


The knife skittered across the table, hit the floor with a sharp CLINK at his feet.


Cole looked down at the blade. Didn't hesitate.


Bent down. Grabbed it. Drove it into his side.


Blood bloomed across his white shirt, spreading fast.


""COLE!""


Vivian screamed and lunged, grabbing his wrist. Tears streamed down her face.


""Stop—you can't—I'm not worth this—let her do whatever she wants to me, just PLEASE—""


""Sure."" Raina's voice cut through the hysteria.


She looked at Vivian with dead eyes. ""Then do what he just did. One cut. Do that, and maybe I let you walk.""


""RAINA!"" Cole's voice came out strangled. ""She's pregnant. Back off.""


He was breathing hard, blood dripping from his fingers.


He raised his trembling hand and pressed it over his heart.


""I said this is on me. You still want blood?""


""Right here. Say the word.""


Raina's eyes burned.


Not from tears. From rage so hot it felt like her veins were on fire.


She held his stare. He held hers.


Neither looked away.


Then Vivian dropped to her knees.


""Please—Ms. Raina—PLEASE. This is my fault. I seduced him. Hate me, not him.""


She slapped herself hard. Once. Twice.


""I'll do anything—just stop hurting him. He's bleeding—doesn't that mean ANYTHING to you?!""


Raina sneered at the scene.


She looked at Vivian's tears. At Cole's bleeding side.


And realized that somehow, she—the WIFE—had become the villain in this fucked-up little play.


Finally, she looked away first.


She turned to leave.


Cole grabbed her wrist.


""I swear, Rai—once the baby's born, she's gone. You'll never see her again. I'll fix this. We can go back to how things were—""


Raina ripped her arm free. Looked down at his blood-soaked sleeve.


""You disgust me.""


Cole went rigid. All the color drained from his face.


Raina walked out.


...


On the drive home, she suddenly started laughing.


Quiet at first. Then harder.


Then the tears came.


She hadn't lost to Vivian's schemes.


She'd lost to HIM. The man she'd loved for ten years.


Lost so completely there was nothing left.


Ten years.


Back then, Cole Quin was muscle-for-hire at a Vegas dive bar. Raina White was a San Francisco heiress who'd never pumped her own gas.


They should never have crossed paths.


But she ran from an arranged marriage, only to stumble into his world.


And from that moment, she gave him everything. Fought her family for him. Bled for him. Built his empire with her money, her name, her LIFE.


She took bullets for him. He killed for her.


They burned through the world together, fused by blood and fire.


She thought it would last forever.


Then he cheated.


When she found out—when she made Vivian get rid of that baby—she thought it would bring him back.


Instead, it pushed him into Vivian's arms.


He protected her. Let her have her way.


And let her knife find its mark in Raina's belly.

Voting starts Jan 16!,"I'm excited (and slightly terrified) to announce the first Alameda Peep's Best Of Alameda Vote. I've been coding up for the past few months. [https://alamedapeeps.com/vote/best-of-alameda-2025](https://alamedapeeps.com/vote/best-of-alameda-2025)

# What is this?

From your favorite coffee spot to the teacher who changed a kid's life — this is YOUR chance to celebrate the best of Alameda. Winners earn the Certified Alameda Peeps Favorite award, recognized by over 20,000 of your neighbors (20,000+ in the Peeps FB group and 20,000 on this Reddit, and I'm not sure the overlap).

No corporate picks. No paid placements. Just real votes from real Alamedans.

# The Story

A few months ago, I had this idea: what if we could recognize and award our favorite local businesses and the amazing people who make Alameda special? Give them some attribution to show they are Alameda's Best! So I decided to build a sophisticated voting platform from scratch.

# How It Works

RIGHT NOW: We're in the nomination phase. All you need is a verified email to login and nominate businesses and people across dozens of categories.  
  
NEXT: Once nominations close, we'll move to voting. Businesses can even print QR codes to encourage their customers to vote for them! You'll be able to vote once per day for your favorites.  
  
FINALLY: We'll announce the winners, and they'll get bragging rights as official Alameda favorites.

# The Fine Print

* A few volunteers, including myself, are keeping an eye out for vote manipulation (this isn't a secret ballot)
* You may run into bugs — PLEASE let me know if you do!
* Check out the business directory, where each nominee gets their own page showing their awards history.

# Your Turn!

1. Head to [https://alamedapeeps.com/vote/best-of-alameda-2025](https://alamedapeeps.com/vote/best-of-alameda-2025) and start nominating!

2. Comment with any categories you think we're missing.

1q4bdo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIronCouncil/comments/1q4bdo7/how_to_build_habits_that_survive_stress_and/,How to build habits that survive stress and laziness: the ultimate lazy-proof system backed by science,"Ever notice how your “good habits” disappear the moment life gets stressful? Gym? Ghosted. Reading? Forgotten. Diet? Gone. Suddenly, you're bingeing snacks, doomscrolling, and wondering if self-discipline is a scam. It’s not just you. Most people don't fail at habits because they’re lazy or weak — they fail because the system they’re using doesn’t work under pressure. 

This post is a breakdown of how to build stress-resistant, laziness-proof habits. Not TikTok hacks. Not overly aesthetic routines built for influencers. This is based on the best habit research from top thinkers like James Clear, Dr. Wendy Wood, Charles Duhigg, and neuroscience-backed psychology podcasts like Andrew Huberman’s.

Most people build habits that only work when life is perfect. That’s the problem. Real life gets messy. So your system needs to work *even when you’re tired, emotional, or overwhelmed.*

Here’s how to build real-life habits that survive chaos:

Design for frictionless action
  
Research from BJ Fogg’s Stanford Behaviour Design Lab shows that simplicity beats motivation every time. Make your habit so easy that it doesn’t rely on willpower. Want to read? Leave the book on your pillow. Want to walk daily? Shoes by the door. You need the path of least resistance.

Use “starter habits,” not outcome-based goals
 
Don’t aim to ""get fit."" Aim to do 1 push-up after brushing your teeth. This taps into what Dr Wendy Wood calls ""contextual cues,"" which automate behaviour. Once it’s easy, your brain stops resisting.

Build habits “inside” your existing routines
  
James Clear calls this “habit stacking.” After coffee, meditate. After lunch, take a walk. Attach the new behaviour to something you're already doing. That way, stress doesn’t erase the trigger.

Automate with environment, not motivation
  
Charles Duhigg, in *The Power of Habit*, explains how the environment shapes behaviour more than intention. If you're trying to quit sugar, don't ""fight cravings,"" just don’t keep cookies in the house. Setting your environment beats “trying hard.”

Track wins, not perfection
  
A 2010 study published in the *European Journal of Social Psychology* found it takes, on average, 66 days to build a habit that becomes automatic. You’ll slip up. What matters is that you *start again fast.* A simple checkmark habit tracker (paper or app) builds momentum and reminds your brain it’s still on track.

Plan for bad days with “minimum viable habits”
 
Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman recommends minimum commitments to train consistency. Too tired to run? Walk 5 minutes. Too stressed to journal? Write one sentence. These ""tiny wins"" protect the habit identity even on your worst days.

Use “if-then” plans to prevent relapse
 
Psychologist Peter Gollwitzer’s work on implementation intentions shows that “if-then” scripts (e.g., If I skip the gym in the morning, I’ll go after lunch) dramatically increase follow-through. You prepare your brain for resistance before it shows up.

None of these relies on superhuman discipline. They’re just systems that expect you to be human — tired, emotional, distracted. But they still work.",1,1767585570.0,TheIronCouncil,0,1.0,False

Lived in Denver for 10 years, chief complaints are way too fucking sunny, felt like I didn't fit in with the ski/outdoor climbing high income and ""softer"" people. Loved the mountains and outdoors and the feel of a small-big city that was fairly liberal, had an airport w/ ample international & domestic locations, and had endless things to do and an expensive women & queer scene (lgbtq breweries, women's sports bars, queer rec leagues, queer climb nights, etc).

From Buffalo, back for a stint, chief complaints are I think I might want a bigger city, the food scene is lacking, now annoyed when snow impedes my plans.  Positives, I feel like I fit in (very sarcastic and laid back). I like the grey days, not the snow that comes with it 9 months of the year. 

PDX: I am there for 3 days, of which I have to work 6-8ish hours remote.

I don't need to see the mountains, ocean, scenery, museums, zoos, bot gardens. They'll be there if I move there.

Goal: try to ""catch a vibe"" of daily life.

Will be checking out queer/women's gyms, and bouldering gyms, coffee shops, grocery store (super fun I know), etc. 

Not a drinker, not interested in going out scene.

What are: 
1. Some good neighborhood(s) I could look for an airbnb/hotel/hostel in to scope a vibe for rent a 1br ~2k& under, can go 2500.

1q4baq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/WisdomWriters/comments/1q4baq4/the_first_date/,The First Date,"By Nekro

It begins on a Tuesday that doesn't know it matters yet.

A man with a laundry bag slung over his shoulder, thinking about whether he has enough quarters. A woman holding an envelope, wondering if mailing it will fix anything or just make it permanent.

They pass each other on that particular stretch of sidewalk where the bodega meets the dry cleaner, where the city's rhythm briefly stutters.

Their eyes catch. Not dramatically. Just the way eyes sometimes do when two people happen to be looking up at the exact wrong or right moment. A half second of accidental intimacy that the brain immediately begins to misinterpret.

You know this feeling. The one where your chest does something architectural. Where time briefly forgets how to move forward.
He walks another ten steps. Tells himself it was nothing. That the washing machines are waiting and quarters have a way of disappearing when you need them most.

He stops anyway.
Turns around before the rational part of his brain can lodge a formal objection.

She is still there, half a block away, walking slower now like she's waiting for something to happen or hoping it wont.

He catches up. No prepared speech. No borrowed cleverness. Just honesty, which is usually a terrible opening move but occasionally the only one that works.
""I know this is strange,"" he says. ""But I think I'd regret not saying something.""

She looks at him the way people do when theyre deciding whether a stranger is dangerous or just refreshingly honest. There is a pause. A car passes. Someone's radio plays something neither of them will remember.
""Saying what?"" she asks.
""I dont know yet. But it felt like walking away would be a mistake.""

She studies him. He doesnt look away. This is the moment that seals it, not what he said, but that he stayed present for her inspection of it.

""I was going to the post office,"" she says finally.
""I was going to do laundry.""
""Riveting lives we lead.""
""Devastating,"" he agrees.

She smiles. Its a small smile, the kind that suggests shes already decided but wants to see how this plays out.

""You can walk me to the post office if you want,"" she says. ""If your laundry can wait.""
""My laundry has been waiting since Thursday. It can wait a little longer.""

They walk together. She mails the letter without telling him who its to, and he doesnt ask, which she appreciates. He loads two machines at the laundromat on the corner while she sits on the bench by the window and watches people argue about the right water temperature.

""You fold or crumple?"" she asks.
""Fold what?""
""Your life. When you pack it away.""
He considers this. ""I fold the things I want to keep nice. Everything else gets crumpled.""
""Honest answer.""

""I'm trying something new today.""
Breakfast happens because they're both hungry and neither wants the conversation to end. A diner with cracked vinyl booths and coffee that tastes like the 1970s never left.

They talk the way people do when they sense time is limited, not frantically, but without filler. No resume recitations. No practiced anecdotes.

Just the stuff that bubbles up when you're not trying to impress anyone.
She tells him about the year she lived in her car. He tells her about the plant he accidentally killed by loving it too much. They disagree about whether movies are better when you know the ending. Neither convinces the other. Both enjoy the argument.
Hours dissolve. The laundry finishes. They fold it together, and somehow this feels more intimate than it should. The city darkens.

 They wander without destination, the way you do when stopping would break whatever spell is holding.
By the time they circle back to where they started, the day has taken on that golden hour quality where everything looks like a memory already.

She reaches into her jacket. He sees whats coming, the pen, the number, the promise of continuation.
""Wait,"" he says.
She pauses, pen halfway out.
""I don't want your number.""
She blinks. Recalibrates. ""Oh.""
""Not because"" He stops. Tries again. ""Do you believe in fate?""
""I don't know. Do you?""
""I didn't this morning.""
She laughs, but it fades quickly because she can see he's serious.

""If this matters,"" he says, ""we shall meet again. Same circumstances. Laundry and mail. And if we do, if the universe is paying any attention at all, ill ask you to marry me immediately. No phone calls. No slow erosion. Just that.""

She stares at him. ""That's insane.""
""Completely.""
""We dont even know each other's names.""
""I know you hate cilantro and love your sister and youre afraid of becoming the person in that letter you mailed. Thats not nothing.""
Shes quiet for a long time. He can see her working through it the absurdity, the romance, the clean logic of a bet against entropy.
""And if we don't meet again?"" she asks.

""Then this was enough. One perfect day. No decay. No disappointment. Just this.""
You can see her decision in her shoulders. The way they drop slightly, accepting the terms.
""Okay,"" she says.
""Okay?""
""Okay.""

They kiss. Not like people who are saying goodbye, but not like people who are certain of tomorrow either. Somewhere in between. The kind of kiss that carries its own ending.
They walk away in opposite directions. Neither looks back. Looking back would be cheating.

Time does what it does.
Days become weeks become years. They meet other people. Fall into other rhythms. Get married, different people, different ceremonies, different last names. 

Build lives that work. Have children who ask questions they can't quite answer. Forget the exact sound of each other's voices but never quite forget the feeling of that day, lodged somewhere behind the sternum like a splinter made of light.

Memory is generous with distance. The day becomes mythical. A story they each tell themselves, alone, in quiet moments. Proof that magic happened once. That they were capable of it.

They dont google. Dont search. That would violate the pact.
The years pile up. The laundry continues. The mail still needs sending.

It happens on a Tuesday again. Because irony is lazy but persistent.
A man, older now, with gray threading through his temples and a laundry bag that weighs exactly as much as middle age feels.

 Different apartment. Same detergent.
A woman, older now, with reading glasses on a chain and an envelope in her hand. Different handwriting. Similar dread about what mailing it will set in motion.

They cross paths on that same stretch of sidewalk.

The bodega is under new management. The dry cleaner has closed. But the geometry of the intersection is identical.

They pass.
Their eyes dont catch. Or maybe they do, briefly, the way everyones eyes catch a thousand times a day in cities, a flicker of recognition that could be anything or nothing.

They keep walking.
He doesn't turn around. She doesn't slow down.

The moment evaporates like all the other moments that happen and unhappen a thousand times a day in cities where people are always crossing paths and never stopping.

The laundry gets done. The letter gets mailed.

Somewhere in their respective homes that night, maybe one of them pauses. Feels something. Dismisses it. Returns to the dishes, the mortgage, the life that turned out fine even if it turned out differently than expected.

That's the story.
The one where fate doesnt show up.
Where the pact goes unclaimed.
Where something perfect happened once and then ended, and ending didn't make it less perfect.

If this bothers you, good. You're supposed to be bothered. You were never promised a universe that pays attention or rewards your bets against entropy.

Only reminded that some things are complete because they end.
That meaning doesn't require continuation.

That the machines keep spinning and the mail keeps moving and life keeps happening whether or not you get the ending you negotiated with a stranger on a sidewalk when you were younger and believed in tests the universe might actually grade.

Somewhere between the detergent and the mailbox, something mattered once.
And that was enough.
It has to be.

1q4b7be,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NightmareNarratives-/comments/1q4b7be/i_moved_into_a_cheap_house_with_a_locked_basement/,"I moved into a cheap house with a locked basement door covered in cement around the frame. Last night, the hinges clicked like someone was opening it from the inside, even though the door still looked sealed shut...","I moved into the house because it was cheap and because I didn’t have options.

That’s the honest reason. I’d just picked up a night job doing inventory counts for a regional supplier. The pay was steady, the hours were bad, and my savings were thin enough that one missed paycheck would’ve put me in trouble. The listing said fixer-upper. What it meant was no one else wanted it.

The house sits on a quiet street outside town. Single-story. Faded siding. Small backyard with a dead patch of grass where nothing grows. It looks normal enough from the outside, which mattered to me more than it should’ve.

I noticed the basement door during the walkthrough.

It’s in the hallway between the kitchen and the bedroom. Standard size. Old wood. No handle on the outside, just a smooth, painted surface. The frame around it is rough, uneven, like someone poured cement by hand and didn’t bother smoothing it out.

I asked the landlord about it.

“Old moisture issue,” he said. “Basement flooded years ago. Sealed it off. No reason to go down there.”

“Is it structurally sound?” I asked.

He nodded too quickly. “That’s why it’s sealed.”

I didn’t push. I needed the place. Rent was due in three days. I signed the lease and told myself I didn’t care what was behind a door I’d never open.

The first few nights were uneventful. Quiet house. No neighbors close enough to hear. No weird noises beyond the normal creaks and pops you get in older buildings. I work nights, so I sleep during the day and exist in a half-lit world of drawn curtains and coffee.

That routine matters, because when it breaks, I notice.

The first sound came late, around 2:30 a.m.

I was in the living room watching something mindless, volume low. I thought it was the house settling at first. A dull click somewhere down the hall. Not loud enough to register as a problem.

Then it happened again.

Closer.

Metal on metal.

I muted the TV and listened.

The sound came from the hallway.

From the basement door.

I stood there for a full minute, telling myself it was nothing. Old hinges contracting with temperature changes. Pipes shifting. Any explanation that didn’t involve something happening on the other side of a sealed door.

Then I heard it clearly.

A hinge clicking.

Not randomly.

Sequentially.

Top hinge.
Pause.
Middle hinge.
Pause.
Bottom hinge.

Exactly the sound a door makes when someone opens it slowly and carefully.

I walked into the hallway.

The door looked exactly the same. Cement intact. No cracks. No gaps. The painted surface unbroken, like it had been poured into place and left to harden decades ago.

I put my hand on it.

Cold. Solid. No vibration. No movement.

I laughed quietly, more at myself than anything else, and went back to the couch.

That’s when I realized something else.

The clicking had stopped because the door had finished opening.

At least, that’s what the sound suggested.

But there was no space for it to open into.

The next night, it happened again.

Same time. Same sequence.

This time, I was in bed. Lights off. House quiet. I didn’t move. I counted the clicks in my head, heart pounding harder with each one.

When it finished, I waited for something else. Footsteps. Breathing. Any follow-up noise that would confirm I wasn’t losing my mind.

Nothing came.

I slept badly after that.

The third night, I checked the door before going to bed.

I examined the cement closely. Ran my fingers along the edges. No seams. No hairline fractures. No signs of tampering. Whoever sealed it had done it thoroughly.

That should’ve been reassuring.

It wasn’t.

At 2:14 a.m., the hinges clicked again.

This time, I was standing right in front of the door.

The sound didn’t come from the hinges themselves.

It came from inside the wall.

I felt it then. Not movement. Not vibration.

Pressure.

Like something on the other side was leaning against the door, testing it. Not hard enough to break through. Just enough to make the hardware respond the way it was designed to.

Open.

When the last hinge clicked, something brushed the door from the inside.

A soft scrape.

Careful.

Deliberate.

Like fingers finding the edge where the door should have separated from the frame.

I stepped back, every instinct screaming at me to run, even though there was nowhere to go.

From the other side of the door, something shifted its weight.

And for the first time since I moved in, I heard a sound that didn’t belong to the house at all.

A breath.

Slow. Deep.

Patient.

Part 2

I didn’t sleep after that.

I sat on the couch with the hallway light on, staring at the basement door like it might do something if I looked away. The breathing didn’t continue. That almost made it worse. It meant whatever was on the other side didn’t need air the way I did. Or didn’t need to rush.

Morning came slowly. Pale light through the curtains. The house settled back into its harmless daytime shape. By the time the sun was up, I almost believed I’d imagined the whole thing.

Almost.

The basement door was warm.

Not hot. Not enough to hurt. Just noticeably warmer than the wall around it. The cement frame felt the same way, like it had been holding heat all night and hadn’t let it go yet.

I took photos. Close-ups of the hinges. The cement. The door itself. Everything looked unchanged. No cracks. No bowing. No damage.

The photos didn’t capture the warmth.

I went to work that night exhausted, jumpy, replaying the sound of the hinges in my head. I told myself I wouldn’t stand by the door again. I’d stay in bed. Ignore it. People live with sealed crawlspaces and basements all the time.

That logic worked until 2:14 a.m.

The first hinge clicked.

Not loud. Not sharp. Just precise.

I lay perfectly still, staring at the ceiling, counting each sound. The clicks didn’t echo through the hallway this time. They sounded closer. Deeper. Like the door wasn’t opening outward anymore.

Like it was being unlatched from the other side.

Top hinge.
Pause.
Middle hinge.

My throat tightened.

Before the bottom hinge could click, something else happened.

The door answered.

A faint creak. Not from the hinges. From the wood itself, reacting to pressure. Like someone had pressed their forehead against it and leaned in slowly.

I heard nails scrape.

Not dragging. Not clawing.

Testing.

The bottom hinge clicked.

Silence followed. Heavy. Expectant.

Then the handleless door shifted inward by a fraction of a centimeter.

It shouldn’t have been possible. The cement frame didn’t crack. The paint didn’t break. The door simply… existed in a slightly different place than it had a moment before.

I felt cold rush over my skin, like the house had opened a window somewhere deep inside itself.

Something exhaled on the other side of the door.

Closer now.

I bolted upright in bed and shouted without thinking. “Stop.”

The breath paused.

For a second, I thought it worked.

Then something on the other side mimicked my voice.

Not perfectly. The tone was right, but the timing was off, like it hadn’t practiced enough yet.

“Stop,” it said back.

I didn’t stay in bed after that.

I grabbed my keys, shoes still untied, and left the house at 2:17 a.m. I sat in my car until dawn, watching the front door like I expected it to open on its own.

It didn’t.

When I went back inside in the morning, the basement door looked untouched.

But the cement around the frame had new marks.

Finger-length grooves pressed into it from the inside.

Perfectly spaced.

As if something had been counting how much room it needed.

I didn’t go to work that night.

I texted my supervisor something vague about food poisoning and shut my phone off before he could ask questions. I spent the evening sitting in the living room with every light on, a chair pulled back from the hallway like distance alone might help.

I kept glancing at the basement door.

It didn’t move.

That almost felt intentional.

Around midnight, the house started doing things it hadn’t done before. Not loud things. Small corrections. The kind of sounds you only notice when you’re already listening too hard.

A floorboard creaked near the hallway, even though I wasn’t there.
The air pressure shifted, like a door opening somewhere deep underground.
The smell changed. Damp earth layered under old concrete.

At 2:10 a.m., the lights flickered once.

At 2:12, the hallway felt colder.

At 2:14, the first hinge clicked.

I was standing this time. Halfway down the hall. Close enough that I could see the basement door clearly. My heart hammered so hard it blurred my vision.

The sound didn’t come from the hinges anymore.

It came from behind the wall.

Top.
Pause.
Middle.

The cement frame groaned softly, not cracking, just flexing the way old structures do when weight shifts in the wrong place. I could feel the sound in my teeth.

“Please don’t,” I said, before I could stop myself.

The house went completely still.

Then something pressed against the door.

Not leaning. Not shoving.

Resting.

Like a body finding the exact place where effort wasn’t required.

I realized then why the door didn’t have a handle on my side.

It was never meant to be opened from here.

The bottom hinge clicked.

The door didn’t swing open.

It slid.

Not outward. Not inward.

Sideways.

Just enough to create a hairline shadow along the cement frame. A darkness that wasn’t empty space, but depth. A space that swallowed the hallway light instead of reflecting it.

I staggered back, bile rising in my throat.

From inside that thin seam, a voice spoke.

Not loud. Not strained.

Calm.

“You moved in,” it said. “That made it your turn.”

My knees almost buckled. “What are you?”

There was a pause. Long enough that I thought it wasn’t going to answer.

Then the pressure shifted again.

Closer to the opening.

“I’m what stayed,” it said. “When the rest was sealed.”

The shadow widened by a few millimeters.

I smelled breath. Warm. Human. Close.

“I can’t fit yet,” it continued, almost conversational. “But you help every night.”

“Help how?” I whispered.

The voice sounded pleased.

“You listen.”

The door slid back into place.

The seam vanished. The hallway returned to normal. The basement door looked exactly the way it always had.

Except the warmth was gone.

It felt cold now. Empty. Like something had stepped away from it at last.

I stood there shaking until morning.

At sunrise, I noticed something new.

The grooves in the cement weren’t finger marks anymore.

They were smoothed out.

Rounded.

Like the space behind the door had pressed itself forward and learned the shape it needed.

That afternoon, my landlord finally returned my calls.

He was quiet when I told him about the sounds. The warmth. The marks.

He didn’t deny anything.

“They sealed it because it learned doors,” he said flatly.

My stomach dropped. “Learned?”

“It used to come up the stairs,” he said. “Not fast. Not all at once. Just enough to be noticed.”

“Why didn’t anyone remove it?” I asked.

He sighed. “Because it doesn’t leave. It waits. And it needs someone living above it.”

I swallowed. “Then why rent the house?”

There was a pause on the line.

“You’re the first tenant who’s stayed long enough for it to start opening again,” he said.

That night, I moved my mattress into the living room.

It didn’t matter.

At 2:14 a.m., the hinges clicked anyway.

This time, all three at once.

And from the other side of the sealed door, something laughed softly.

Like it finally understood how close it was.

I didn’t stay to hear the hinges finish.

When all three clicked at once, something in my chest gave way. Not panic. Clarity. The kind that arrives too late but still demands to be obeyed.

I grabbed my keys and ran.

I didn’t bother with shoes. I didn’t look back. I tore the front door open and stumbled onto the lawn, lungs burning, night air cutting cold against my skin. I kept going until the house was a dark shape behind me and the streetlights felt real again.

I spent the night in my car, parked under a gas station canopy with the engine off, watching the time tick past 2:14 a.m.

Nothing happened.

No sounds. No movement. No laughter carried on the wind.

By morning, exhaustion made me reckless.

I went back.

I told myself I needed proof. Photos. Something to show someone who could do something about it. Police. Inspectors. Anyone who wouldn’t dismiss me as another tenant spooked by an old house.

The front door was unlocked.

I know I locked it. I checked twice when I left.

Inside, the house smelled wrong. Not damp. Not moldy.

Occupied.

The hallway light was on.

The basement door was open.

Not broken. Not shattered.

Open.

The cement frame was still there, intact, but the door itself stood flush against the wall, slid neatly aside like it had always been designed to do that. Beyond it was darkness so complete it felt textured, like a surface instead of empty space.

No stairs.

No basement.

Just depth.

I stood frozen at the threshold, heart pounding, listening.

Something shifted inside the dark.

Not stepping forward. Adjusting.

Learning the height of the doorway.

“You left,” the voice said gently. “That slowed things down.”

I couldn’t see it, but I felt it move closer. The air grew warmer with each second, thick and stale like breath held too long.

“You live above me,” it continued. “That’s how this works.”

“I’m moving out,” I said. My voice shook. “I won’t be back.”

There was a sound that might have been amusement.

“They all say that.”

Something reached the edge of the doorway. I saw it then, not clearly, but enough. A shape that had learned verticality. Learned where shoulders go. Learned how much space a human takes up.

But it hadn’t learned faces yet.

That’s when I understood the laughter.

It wasn’t happy.

It was patient.

“I don’t need to chase,” it said. “I just need you to sleep somewhere with a door.”

The hallway creaked behind me.

I ran again.

I didn’t take anything with me this time. Not clothes. Not documents. Not proof. I drove until the sun came up and kept going until I crossed county lines. I slept in the car. Then in motels. Then on a friend’s couch.

Weeks passed.

Nothing happened.

I started to believe I’d escaped.

Then last night, as I was drifting off in a new place with new walls and a new locked door, I heard a familiar sound.

Metal on metal.

Not hinges.

A latch.

Testing.

Careful.

Deliberate.

And from somewhere beneath the floor, deep enough that it felt like it came from the building itself, I heard something breathe and settle into place.

Waiting.

Because now it knows how doors work.

And it knows I’m still above it.",1,1767585068.0,u_NightmareNarratives-,0,1.0,False

Currently a seven stage setup with an extra carbon block pre/post-pressure tank for drinking water. Check valve is to prevent back flow from the pressure tank into the DI stage. 

Everything is mounted on 3/4” MDF 2-layers of primer to seal for paint and 2-layers of paint to seal for water. I found MDF allows for solid and flexible mounting for equipment and brackets. MDF needs to sealed to keep dry and avoid swelling. 

I did some re-plumbing to include pressure gauges, TDS measurements, and water sample ports. I bought/printed the brackets. 

Pressure gauges (listed in flow order) allow me to monitor booster pump performance (P2-P1), pre filter pressure drop as an indicator of clogging (P3-P2), RO membrane pressure drop as an indicator of performance (P4-P3)

P1 - city water
P2 - booster pump outlet
P3 - post sediment/carbon blocks
P4 - post RO membrane

I had a dual TDS and upgraded to a triple TDS and now I am using all five (listed in flow order). I monitor my RO rejection rate (T2 and T1), RO flushing monitoring (T3), DI performance (T4), DI polish performance (T5). 

T1 - city water
T2 - RO product water
T3 - RO waste water
T4 - post cation and anion 
T5 - post mixed bed DI

It feels like the only new products we get are different flavored cold brew or cold brew concentrates, or some gimmicky tea. The winter hot chocolates lasted about one week in my store, and the winter coffee blends were two variations of the same thing: spiced coffee. There's just no creativity! And the different variations of cold brew sit on the shelf (or get plussed out!), taking up our extremely limited space while selling horrifically. 

I wish we had at least one more light roast option - maybe a light roast whole bean? A play on Starbucks Blonde roast or something?

I would also like to see some product innovation in the same spirit of the (relatively) new RTD espresso - perhaps a powdered latte mix in the same lane as the Chai and the two matcha latte mixes we have? Or some new coffee product I wouldn't think would be possible for TJ's to sell?

I also love the gifting options we get in other sections - Chocolate passports, honey trios, etc. I wish we had a holiday gift box that had 3-5 different single origin packets of grounds, even if it cost $19.99 or something. They could just not blend the 5 country blend together, grind up the single country beans, and add it to a artsy box.

My heart raced. The second my plane landed, I went straight to him.


Found him on his knees outside his building. Tying another girl's shoelaces.


I stopped dead. Everything went cold.


I thought he'd panic when he saw me. Scramble for an excuse.


Instead, he smiled.


""Ava! Perfect timing. This is Brielle—my girlfriend.""


Then he turned to her.


""Babe, this is Ava. We go way back. Just friends.""


I felt myself shut down.


So that's it. I was just a hookup with history.


That night, I blocked him everywhere.


Put in for a transfer.


But the day I left, he showed up crying.


""Where are you going?!""


""Somewhere you're not.""


...


Grayson texted me a shirtless pic: \[Coming over tonight.\]


I practically sprinted off the plane.


But when I got to his building, there he was—crouched down on the sidewalk, tying some girl's shoelaces like a lovesick golden retriever.


I stopped cold.


I thought he'd panic. Maybe stammer. Something.


Instead, he smiled.


""Ava! This is Brielle. My girlfriend.""


He turned to her, still grinning.


""Babe, this is Ava. We've known each other forever. Just friends.""

The words hit me like a punch.


Brielle narrowed her eyes at me, then turned on him.


""Friends don't show up straight off a plane dragging luggage behind them.""


He jumped in fast.


""Babe, seriously—we grew up together. That's all it is.""


Then he looked at me, annoyed.


""Why'd you even come here? You should've just gone home.""


The wind blew my hair across my face. Good. It hid the tears.


I glanced down and saw my shoelace trailing loose. I bent down, tied it, wiped my eyes.


""Just passing through.""


Brielle was still sulking. Grayson barely looked at me as he waved me off.


""Yeah. Go.""


I turned and wheeled my suitcase away, throat burning.


After college, we both stayed in the city.


One night at some work party, he got blackout drunk. I helped him out of his jacket—and suddenly, he kissed me.


In the dark, I didn't stop him.


I'd wanted him since we were kids.


Friendship was just the excuse I used to stay close.


The next morning, I tried to laugh it off. Told him we should forget it.


He didn't laugh. He kissed me again.


After that, everything changed.


We held hands in the snow. Kissed at midnight. Spent nights wrapped up in each other.


I thought we were together.


Turns out I was the only one who did.


I got home and just... collapsed on the couch.


Everything that just happened kept running through my head on a loop. It was so fucking stupid.


My phone lit up. Grayson.


\[You home?\]


I stared at it.


The whiplash was insane.


Did that actually just happen?


How do you tell someone you love them while you're still fucking someone else?


My stomach lurched. I barely made it to my knees before I started dry-heaving.


Another text.


\[Be there in 10.\]


I laughed. I was crying, but I laughed.


So that's what I was. A booty call with a history.


\[Don't come over.\] I texted him back.


Typing bubble. Then:


\[What's your problem? We've always been like this.\]


\[Or are you mad I have a girlfriend now? Chill. I'm not even sleeping with her yet.\]


I actually laughed out loud. It was that ridiculous.


When did I ever say I was okay with this?


Every time I slept with him, every time I let him touch me—it was because I loved him.


And he thought—


\[You were into it too.\]


I blocked him without thinking twice. Deleted his number. Everything.


Then I locked myself in the shower and stayed there for two hours.


Like I could scrub him off my skin. Undo every stupid decision.


I just felt disgusting.


For giving him everything. For getting nothing back.


When I got out, he was already inside.


He grabbed me before I could say anything, pulled me close, mouth on my neck, hands everywhere.


""Damn. You showered without me?""


He dangled a box of condoms. ""Let me hop in real quick. Then we're good.""


I snatched the box and threw it straight in the trash.


""Give me my key back. And leave.""


He stopped. Blinked.


""Wait—are you serious right now? Did you actually catch feelings?""


He laughed. Like it was funny.


""Come on. We've known each other since we were kids. There's nothing new here.""


I felt humiliated. Crushed. I couldn't even breathe.


He finally got that I wasn't joking.


He tossed the key on the floor.


""Don't tell Brielle.""


Pause.


""I really love her.""


That broke something in me.


He knew exactly what he was doing.


Whatever was left of my dignity, he ground it into the floor.


Along with every memory that used to matter.


I bit down hard so my voice wouldn't shake.


""Fine.""


Chapter 2


I dragged my ass to work the next day.


Because that's what you do. You fall apart after five.


I threw myself into every project I could find. If I stayed busy enough, maybe I wouldn't have to think.


That night I was scrolling Instagram when Grayson's story popped up.


My stomach flipped.


When I first got on there, I'd bugged him until he followed me back. Took forever.


My thumb hovered over his name. I knew I shouldn't.


I clicked anyway.


There they were. Faces pressed together. Fireworks exploding over Disneyland.


I really into theme parks. I'd asked him a hundred times to go with me.


Same line every time: ""That's for kids. We're almost thirty. Why would we go?""


Guess it wasn't about Disneyland. It was about me.


I kept scrolling.


He looked so fucking happy.


Every memory I thought was ours—he was already making new ones with her.


I didn't sleep until three.


Anger and heartbreak kept ripping through me in waves.


I didn't get it.


What did I do wrong? Why was I the one drowning while he got to be fine?


...


Christmas was coming. Work made us stay through Christmas Eve to hit some bullshit deadline.


Everyone complained. I was relieved.


Grayson's family lived across the hall. Every year our families had dinner together on Christmas Eve.


At least now I had an out.


By the time everyone left, it was past midnight.


Fireworks started going off outside. I stood at the window watching them fade and didn't realize I was crying until my vision blurred.


Suddenly someone tapped my shoulder.


I spun around. My manager Liam stood there with two coffees.


I wiped my face fast.


I thought I was alone.


Smiling, I took the cup. ""Thanks.""


He kept his voice soft. ""Why are you still here?""


I pressed my lips together. ""Leaving soon.""


He smiled a little. ""You're always so put-together. Never seen you cry before.""


Beat.


""Bad breakup?""


I froze. ""How'd you know?""


He shrugged. ""You stopped posting about him.""


I had nothing to say.


Yeah. I used to post about Grayson constantly. Like I needed proof he was mine.


Liam seemed to catch my embarrassment.


""If your love life's a shitshow, throw yourself into work. Company's opening a southern office. We need someone to lead it.""


He looked at me.


""Board wants you. You in?""


...


It was late so Liam drove me home.


Halfway there, snow started falling.


I watched it through the window. Last Christmas it snowed too.


Back the, Grayson and I set off sparklers in the snow. It came down so thick it covered our hair.


My nose went numb but I didn't want to go inside. He grabbed my hand and shoved it in his jacket pocket.


""What's with you? You're walking like a turtle.""


I blamed the weather. ""Waiting for more snow.""


He stopped. Cupped my face. Kissed my forehead.


He grinned. ""That what you were waiting for?""


...


My head was spinning.


Was any of that real? Or was I just some idiot replaying fake memories?


My phone buzzed.


Grayson. I still knew his number by heart.


\[Why aren't you home? Your mom said you're still at work. I'll come get you.\]


I glanced at it. Tossed my phone in my bag.


Five minutes later Liam pulled up outside my building.


I got out. He stopped me.


""Hey—your fly.""


I looked down. My zipper had busted open. No idea when.


My face went nuclear. I yanked at it five times. Wouldn't budge.


Kill me now.


He smiled. ""Marry Christmas.""


Then he drove off.


I stood there wrestling with my zipper like an idiot.


Then I turned and looked up.


Grayson was standing there.


So was Brielle.


Her smile was all teeth. ""Oh wow. You two were just in his car and... haha... Christmas hookup?""


""Starting strong!""


I snapped, ""It's not like that!""


She waved me off. ""Girl, relax. We're all adults. Grayson and I couldn't keep our hands off each other last time either. We were in the—""


She giggled and shoved his arm. ""You're so bad!""


Grayson's face turned to stone. His voice went ice-cold.


""Don't compare yourself to her. She's not exactly picky, if you know what I mean.""


At his words, Brielle fake-gasped, still giggling. ""Babe, that's mean.""


He looked at me like I was dirt on his shoe. ""She's desperate and fake as hell.""


Then he turned to Brielle, voice soft again.


""You're nothing like her.""


Pause.


""You've got class. She's just... easy.""


Brielle ate it up.


I stood there. Nails digging into my palms so hard I thought I'd draw blood.


""You're right,"" I said. Voice steady. ""I didn't know what good sex was until now.""


I smiled.


""Guess my standards were in hell.""


Grayson's face went black.


Chapter 3


Christmas morning, I woke up to chaos in the living room.


Grayson's mom barged in and shook me through the blankets.


""Get up, beautiful! You missed dinner last night. You're coming to lunch, and I'm not taking no for an answer.""


I rubbed my eyes, still half asleep. Grayson stood behind her looking like he wanted to strangle someone.


I was already scrambling for an excuse.


My mom smiled. ""Grayson's girlfriend is coming over. Mabel invited all of us.""


My brain stalled.


Wait—already meeting the parents?


""Mabel, I don't think—""


My dad groaned. ""This girl. When's she gonna find someone? All she does is work. Your mother and I are going gray over here.""


Great. Now it was about me.


""Fine. I'll come.""


...


By the time I dragged myself over, everyone was already there.


I could hear Mabel gushing about Brielle. How smart she was. How sweet. What a wonderful wife she'd make.


I stepped inside. The room went quiet.


I froze. Then it hit me.


Mabel used to say that stuff about me.


My mom coughed awkwardly. ""There you are. Come meet Brielle. Grayson's girlfriend.""


Before I could say anything, Brielle spoke up.


""Oh, we've actually met. The night Grayson and I got together.""


She smiled. ""Ava showed up straight from the airport with her suitcase. You two must be really close.""


Bringing that up felt like she'd torn off a scab I'd barely grown.


My chest tightened. But it didn't that hurt like before.


...


Once the parents left, Brielle dropped the act.


""You still hung up on him? That's... kinda sad. But hey, I get it.""


She stepped closer, voice sugar-sweet. ""Whatever you two had before—it's cute. But let's be real. You never stood a chance.""


""We're getting married in three months. You're welcome to come.""


So they're married.


I used to think about marrying him.


Asked him once what kind of wedding he wanted.


He didn't even look up. ""We're not even close to that. Why bring it up?""


Tried asking in bed once. He just fucked me harder. Never answered.


He never answered.


But that was an answer, wasn't it?


I was still thinking when Brielle's voice cut through.


""Babe, I think Malt's hungry. Can we go check on him?""


She pouted. ""I don't remember if I filled his bowl before we left...""


That was an hour and a half round trip.


I remembered when I forgot a file once. Called Grayson and asked him to drop it off.


Ten-minute drive. He shut me down immediately.


""Can you get your shit together? I'm not your delivery guy. I need a break too.""


But now?


Grayson was already grabbing his jacket. ""Get dressed. We'll leave now.""


And just like that, I got it.


The difference between love and nothing was that obvious.


He was short with me because he never loved me.


I was never his girlfriend. I was just... available. A safe fuck he didn't have to work for.

A would with only ESTJs: Pretty much the same as our world now but the ESTJs would be more blunt and robotic because there is no damn Feelers policing everything. They would mostly do work, since they have Ne. They would occasionally find creative works to do work or insult or fight each other with catchy Ne one liners. 

Everyone would tell each other to go to work and get mad at each other even though they tell others to go to work and then beat each other up. But, do it, when it’s not work hours of course.  


A world with only INFJs: Basically everyone would speak like poets; instead of someone saying, “I’m gonna get some coffee” to fit in or for people to understand. They would say, “I must venture out for subsistence to replenish myself and bring joy” and without the Thinkers or Sensors around, they would barely do anything because they would try to find double meaning in everything or try to find a secret meaning in a coffee cup instead of drinking or going to work. They would have great ideas, but since they are trying to find meaning towards everything or analyze each person they see. They would be too busy doing that. 

Also you wouldn’t need a degree to be a therapist or get paid. You would just do that originally. 


A world with only ESTPs: The world would be like a kick ass action movie. Things would be crazy. Everyone would throw wild pranks at each other, do extreme stunts everywhere. Dare each other to break the speed limit. People would instead of saying, “Excuse me”, they would say “Hey, mind if I scoot in there”. 

Also like the ISTP world; people would go to work for fun and go inside and leave whenever they please. Still no time schedule (I feel like that would apply for most worlds with only P types anyways) 


A world with only ISFJs: People would be neat as hell. Everyone would hold a Community clean up day and clean everything. Plant flowers every where in the neighborhood and write little notes to each other. Risks would be rare though with someone putting mustard in their toast be considered the most risk. Aside from cleaning up, people would mostly stay home with their cats. 

Everyone would come to work exactly on time and most jobs would be pro bono or free because the money would be nothing without the friendships and cleanliness. I guess. And every one would take a shower every single day. 


A world with only ENTPs: If the ESTP world is more like an action movie, then the ENTP world would be more like satire film/show. Flashy commercials and billboards, and advertisement industry would change, people would have no script and instead of saying, “Buy this because of (something)” they would say, “Buy this or don’t. We will still get paid money and shit. Buttttttttt (actually says something interesting that will make you want to buy it no matter what they say)”    

There would be more wacky half done inventions, and they would atleast experiment more and itself try to build a flying car or try to find a way to colonize Mars or something. 

People would openly troll each other. And work would just be, making shit and brainstorming ideas and having a good time 24/7 and seeing which shit would be a good idea or a stupid idea. You don’t even need corporate, just figure it out your damn selves like grown ass man. Period  

The world would probably accidentally explode like a few times but it would be totally worth it. We would be playing with dynamite or grenadines more like catch and see who can grab it. 

Alright, I’m gonna do Part 3 soon. Guess, this is it for today. Maybe?

Life is filled with ups and downs, and how we respond to these challenges shapes our journey. Whether grappling with professional setbacks, personal losses, or the pressures of daily life, maintaining a positive mindset is key. Here are several strategies to help you stay motivated even in the most challenging circumstances.

https://preview.redd.it/0ijsei50cgbg1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d149ada1a312aceee5bce9477de66cc7c228cf1b



Embrace a Positive Mindset



The first step to maintaining motivation is to cultivate a positive mindset. This doesn’t mean ignoring difficulties or putting on a happy face; rather, it involves shifting your perspective to focus on potential opportunities in every challenge. By consciously choosing to view obstacles as chances for growth, you empower yourself to take proactive steps rather than become stagnant in frustration.



Set Small, Achievable Goals



In tough times, large goals can feel insurmountable. Breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks can create a clear path forward. Setting small, achievable goals allows you to celebrate milestones along the way, keeping your motivation high. Each time you accomplish a small task, no matter how trivial it may seem, you reinforce your sense of purpose and capability, driving you further toward your ultimate goal.



Create a Routine



Establishing a daily routine can provide a comforting structure amid chaos. Routines help to anchor your day, instilling a sense of normalcy. Whether it’s your morning coffee ritual, scheduled exercise, or designated work hours, having a structured plan allows you to focus your energy productively. Consistency breeds motivation, helping you navigate tough times with more ease.



Surround Yourself with Positivity



The people around you can significantly impact your motivation levels. Surround yourself with positive influences and uplifting individuals who inspire and support you. Engage in conversations that energize you; create an environment where encouragement is abundant. Conversely, try to limit time spent with negative influences, as they can drain your motivation and shift your focus away from your goals.



Practice Self-Care



Taking care of yourself is vital for maintaining motivation during difficulties. This means investing time in activities that rejuvenate you, whether it’s exercising, reading, meditating, or simply spending time in nature. Prioritizing self-care fosters physical and emotional well-being, making it easier to handle stressors. The more revitalized and balanced you feel, the better equipped you’ll be to tackle challenges.



Stay Connected



Isolation can exacerbate feelings of helplessness and demotivation. Make an effort to stay connected with friends, family, or support groups. Sharing your thoughts and feelings can provide new perspectives and remind you that you are not alone in facing challenges. Additionally, networking with others going through similar situations can foster a sense of solidarity and mutual support.



Focus on What You Can Control



In tough times, it’s easy to become overwhelmed by circumstances beyond your control. Redirect your energy toward what you can influence, whether it’s your response to a situation or the steps you take to improve your current reality. By concentrating on actionable items, you gain a sense of agency and empowerment, making it easier to sustain motivation.



Cultivate Gratitude



Practicing gratitude is a powerful tool for maintaining motivation. Spend a few moments each day reflecting on things you are grateful for, even in difficult times. This practice shifts your focus from what’s lacking to what’s present, creating a more positive outlook. A gratitude journal can serve as a helpful reminder of the good things in your life, further inspiring you on your journey.



Keep Learning and Growing



Embrace new challenges as opportunities for personal growth. Whether it’s picking up a new skill, exploring a hobby, or engaging in courses, the pursuit of knowledge can reignite your passion and motivation. Learning fosters curiosity and excitement, breaking the monotony of tough times and encouraging you to move forward.



Visualize Your Success



Visualization is a powerful motivating tool. Take time to imagine your goals and the steps necessary to achieve them. Creating a vision board, filled with images and words that inspire you, can serve as a daily reminder of your aspirations. Visualization not only clarifies your objectives but also inspires you to take action toward turning them into reality.



Conclusion



Staying motivated in tough times is not always easy, but by implementing these strategies, you can cultivate a positive and resilient mindset. Embrace the journey, focus on small steps, and surround yourself with positivity. Life’s challenges may test you, but they also offer opportunities for growth and fulfillment. By maintaining your motivation, you will emerge stronger and more prepared for whatever lies ahead.

I almost can't believe it's been a month since I moved in. This damned house is driving me insane. I'm now hyper-aware of every creak, every moan, every bump. Nothing has happened as dramatic as what I saw with the shower, but if anything, this silence is worse. I'm always expecting to hear something or someone, to see something out the corner of my eye. It's worse at night. No matter how many lights I turn on, there always seems to be shadows watching me from every corner of the room. I feel eyes on me, and I wonder how many eyes there are, and who they belong to.

I've finally decided to take my sister's advice, for lack of anything else to do. I haven't gone all out and hired a spirit guide or anything. But, I picked up some incense at a local shop downtown. I had no idea what to buy, but I saw a few names of plants I recognized, and went from there. It's nice, actually, having a house that smells like jasmine instead of dust. I suppose you could say it's working, since I've started burning sage the spirits have been quiet. Maybe they really are pacified. . . maybe it was all just my imagination. . . maybe I'm losing my mind.

I started my new job last week. It's nothing exciting, just an IT help desk I work from home. There's not much else in a small town like this, everyone pretty much either works form home or commutes. I'm also going out more, getting to know the area, and making new friends. The town is really nice, the people are friendly, the roads are quiet. I'm glad I moved out of the city, I never knew how much I needed the fresh air. All in all, it's not a bad life. Sometimes I even forget about my spooky little haunted house, until it inevitably comes up in conversation.

I was getting coffee with a friend. They asked how I was enjoying the town. I told them all about how I loved it, but they could hear the uncertainty in my voice. I told them I was living in that old house over on maple street, you know the one. Yes, of course they knew the one. They were shocked. They started probing me for questions relentlessly. I just answered honestly, said the house was a little quirky, but nothing too scary. But again, they could sense I was holding something back. So, I told them about the writing on the shower door. It was as if I told them I found a body in the closet. I tried to reassure them, after all, It could have just been a dream for all I know. They weren't convinced, of course. And just like that, my apprehensions were back.

I did some more digging, but there wasn't much to find. There weren't any murders in the house, no portal to hell opening or a madman disposing of his victims under the floor boards. In fact, there wasn't anything odd reported in the house until about 11 years ago. One day, there was just a sudden change In the atmosphere. There were whispers, footsteps, things were moved when no one was there. The oddest thing was people claiming that food was going missing from the house. It was subtle enough that they didn't notice most of the time, but every so often, the pantry just felt a bit too empty.

I wondered If the same was happening to me. So, I decided to experiment. I kept a close watch over how much food was In the house, and how much I was eating. Sure enough, some of it went missing. . . but then, It didn't. Some food would go missing for a time, then it wouldn't, and oddest of all, I could swear there was new food being added in without me buying it. I was food that I had usually bought in the past, but there was just a bit more than I remember buying. It got to the point that I had to check my receipts just to be sure. It wasn't very much, but the discrepancy was certainly there.

I had never heard of this kind of phenomenon in any sort of haunting. All my research - and there was quite a bit of it - seems to show nothing like it in any paranormal reports. I asked my sister, but she didn't have any answers either, despite seeming to always have an answer to everything. Even stranger still, my neighbors are now telling me that they've noticed food going missing too. Again, it's a very subtle amount, but it's definitely been happening. I've been trying to wrap my head around it, but the conclusion I've reached is much more troubling than a ghost.

Maybe this a matter of who, not what.

New year, first Project Pan!

I’ve always joked that I’m the lady version of Ghibli/Diana Wayne Jones’ Howl with my love of beauty and self care things, but this past year I’m kind of shocked by how the collection has spiraled.

Part of this was I think from a chaotic “vacation mode” mentality that my previous year held; and part of it from the fact I’m usually pretty thrifty with consumption so 2025’s purchasing spree caught me off guard.   
  
This is why there’s not a ton of super old products (thankfully, I’d thought it was much worse off), I usually only buy more after I run out of a given scent and rotate things seasonally.

My aim is to actually give myself permission to use what I’ve got instead of making it stretch to the point of a crazy pile up like this and have fun doing it!

(Some have names in the notes, that’s bc friends have claimed some and I forgot to update the list lol)

(Hope a list only post like this is allowed to start a project with, my collection is kinda scattered about so I didn’t feel like trying to dig it all up for a pic, but empties will get actual photos.)",6,1767584018.0,ProjectPan,0,1.0,False

I’m developing a small open-air food court right outside my ice cream parlour and I’m looking for suggestions on what kind of vegetarian food carts I should invite to set up here.

The idea is to create a cosy, family-friendly space with 1 cart = 1 cuisine, so each vendor has their own niche and the overall mix feels exciting rather than repetitive.

Pav Bhaji cart is already operational.
From my side, the only desserts & beverages are: Ice Cream Sundaes and Milkshakes (no separate dessert or beverage carts).

Important limitations
Completely veg only (no egg, no meat, no seafood).
No beverage-only concepts (tea/coffee/juices/sodas, etc. are out).
No dessert-only carts (since ice cream is already covered).

So I’m mainly looking for:
Savoury snack / meal-style carts
Strongly street-food friendly concepts that work well in an open-air, casual setup
Things that pair well with families coming for an evening outing and then probably ending with ice cream

One concept I really like (but would need a vegetarian spin) is the Bring Your Own Bag (BYOB) chips idea. Customers bring their own packet of chips, the vendor slits it open and loads it with toppings inside the same bag. In many places this is done with shawarma or chicken, but I’m imagining:

Veg BYOB: chips + assorted veggies, beans/chole, corn, cheese, olives, jalapeños, different sauces, etc. – basically a portable chaat/nachos-style meal in a bag.

This is just one example to show the style of ideas I’m after: fun, customisable, Instagrammable, and easy to eat in a casual outdoor seating area.

What veg food cart concepts would you personally love to see in a small neighbourhood food court?

Any unique twists on Indian veg street food, global veg snacks, fusion ideas, DIY/customisation concepts, etc.?

Would love to know if you’ve seen something similar work well in India already.

Location is Ghodbunder Road, Thane, target audience is nearby families and young crowds looking for an evening snack + ice cream.

Would love to hear your most creative veg cart ideas!",1,1767583992.0,FoodEntrepreneurIndia,0,1.0,False

1q4aolv,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1q4aolv/i_dont_know_what_to_do_long_read/,I dont know what to do (long read),"

Im not sure what to think of my marriage. 41/f he is 48. We have an 11 year old son together, and I have 16 and 17 year old daughters from a previous marriage. From the start, when I first met my husband he was low effort with everything, he didnt pursue me, I pursued and called him. He was between homes because he was on his way up to Alaska to go gold panning but needed some money so he was trying to get a part time job. We started dating and he was just really easy going and kind, which drew me in. But he also has a passive aggressive a-hole side to him.

I thought he really cared about me, but he ended up going to Alaska anyways. He didnt really bother to call me. I felt like he was doing to me what he was doing to his ex. When we first met he was still dating his ex and he was trying to get with me, I told him no, he needed to break up with her first, but despite him saying he didnt like her he dragged his feet. Which I should've seen as a sign. While he was up in Alaska his room mate kicked him out because I guess he was paying his rent with gold instead of cash, she he ended up sleeping in an outhouse and then at a hostel. 

This was all back in 2011. He moved back down to be with me, but I think it was because I was begging him to. I was addicted to his attention and his kindness. But he was also a flirt. When we first started dating I found Facebook messages (he didnt log out on my laptop)  between him and a few other women that were flirty, and he told me they were like sisters to him. 

He always had an excuse for his flirty behavior. And he would watch porn and lie about it, we had agreed we didnt want it in our relationship. But still, he has always been a kind and selfless person. But his flaws are he doesn't seem to care about anything including paying bills, he is passive aggressive, and he has a temper sometimes. I saw him kick our cat once and he saw that I saw him and he laughed and said ""you thought I kicked the cat? 😆 "". And he has been borderline abusive to my girls by yelling at them, and one time last winter my daughter tossed snow at her brother and my husband got mad and grabbed snow and rubbed it in her face, she tried to get away and he grabbed her arm. He denied all of this and said he ""gently tossed snow at her"" and said she was lying, she was really worked up and hyperventilating. 

There have been some incidents like that. And then also the lapses in judgement, like when he took our son at 5 in the morning to go look at stars and my girls woke up and they were gone and he didnt leave a note, and since he is never near his phone he wasn't answering. My girls called me at work, but I was finally able to get ahold of him and he was mad because they are old enough to be by themselves. Not the point.

And there was an incident with his 19 year old coworker, I had just had our son and I found deleted texts on his phone, I could only retrieve the first 3 or 4 words from each. But he said something about having to go shower at work. They worked night security at a data center, so it was just the 2 of them usually in a big building with limited cameras. There ended up being an investigation done on them because some people were saying things about them, but my husband couldn't remember. But the results were sent to our house, it said they disappeared off camera for several hours, he denied this and said they were in the break room, but there are cameras over there. The last text he sent her he said ""i will miss you... all"" because he was fired. He said it was innocent. I said ""what would you think if I sent that to someone?"" He said ""i wouldn't care"", he honestly probably wouldn't. Anyways, he was 36 and she was 19. He swears on our son that nothing happened. A few women came forward and told the boss that he made them uncomfortable. He was giving them massages in a room, because he had a massage license.

So that was the 1st big thing, and then the 2nd big thing which is more recent, was that he quit his job of 10 years without telling me. So about 2 weeks before it happened he tried to aggressively get me on board with him quitting his job to go gold panning full time (he has been panning for 20 years, and so far he has only found a few hundred dollars worth of gold), he was getting really upset that I wasn't enthusiastically on board, he said we have been living my dream, so its time to live his dream and it will be fine because he will pull out his 401k and we can live off of that, and then when it starts to run out he would go back to work, he promised. So at first I agreed because I felt bad. And then after a while I changed my mind and said we should compromise, he can pan on tbe weekends to see if he could replace his job with it, he said he easily could, he said he could make over 50 grand a year doing it.

So, we agreed with the weekend situation. But a week later he comes to me to tell me Thursday would be his last day, and he also admitted he had already put in his notice weeks before our previous conversation, he was just trying to get me on board so it would be smoother. He said he knew it could be the final straw that would make me leave him but he didnt care, he said ""i knew it would either make us or break us but I didnt care"", he also knew that if I left he wouldn't see his son as much, but he said he didnt care. 

So he quit his job, I almost left him but he swore he would go to marriage counseling and also personal counseling (he went to 1 appointment and didnt like it.). He said he had the opportunity to change his mind and tell hr to retract his notice but he never did. He never found gold during those 4 months, and then money was dwindling and he was not finding work, he admitted he was dragging his feet because he didnt want to work for anyone because all jobs were thr same, all bosses were a-holes. 

Luckily his job was willing to take him back eventually. But now we have fallen behind on our mortgage and some bills are not being paid. We are working with a financial advisor that i hired to help us. He honestly couldnt care less, he is oblivious to our financial condition. I feel like even though he is kind and thoughtful most of the time, he just doesn't care if i stay or go and he doesn't see that im no longer in love with me, he doesn't see it because I am still nice to him like a friend. 

Our kids dont know about all of this conflict. If we were violent or really toxic I would be gone, but I stay for our son and because my husband still displays selfless behavior every day and goes out of his way for us, he cooks and makes me coffee, he does a lot of the running around. I feel dependent on him. Luckily I have a really good paying job, so if things were worse I could leave. 

I just feel stuck. Do I just try to forgive all of this and get past it, even though it physically hurts to be hugged and loved by him? He had said very hurtful things, but i feel addicted to his daily kindness and that's what keeps me around.

Sorry this is so long, and I probably come across as a nagging awful wife.


tl;dr:  married with a son, husband has betrayed me several times, not physically that I know of, married 12 years. He doesn't care about much of anything, but is usually nice and happy. But is also passive aggressive. The pain from the past still hurts, there are holes in his stories, and he doesn't feel bad about the things he has done, I cant even bring my friends around anymore because he flirts with them and makes things awkward. I regret marrying him, but I dont know if I should leave because our son (11) doesn't see the conflict, he sees us being friends. I feel stuck, I try to forgive but the hurt doesn't go away.",0,1767583647.0,marriageadvice,0,0.5,False

**Part One: Analysis of Danny De Hek’s Video on the Opteq Wallet & Qoin Migration**

This post looks at a recent video by Danny De Hek, who describes himself as a *Crypto Ponzi Scheme Avenger*, in which he investigates the new Opteq Wallet and the Qoin migration.

To be upfront, I had never heard of Danny De Hek before this, so I did some background digging. He presents himself as an independent New Zealand (no judgement there - we love kiwis) journalist focused on exposing crypto scams — an admirable goal on the surface. However, after watching his video, I’m not convinced his approach here is as rigorous or objective as he might believe. That said, let’s focus on the content rather than personalities.

The first thing that stood out was the presentation itself. De Hek appears to be reading from a prepared script that he repeatedly trips and stumbles over throughout the entire presentation. He doesn’t seem particularly familiar with the material he’s presenting, which raises serious questions about how deeply he even understands the topic. 

At the time of writing, the video has just 79 views. For comparison (and a bit of humour), a video of me being filmed without my knowledge farting at a café 2 years ago managed 25,000 views on You Tube in seven days. You can draw your own conclusions. Real incident, but jokes aside, let’s get serious.

In the video, De Hek raises the following questions:

1. Who controls the system now?
2. Is the migration necessary?
3. What if something goes wrong?
4. Is this a scam or a genuine wallet?

Rather than forcing anyone to sit through 25 minutes of a rambling breakdown, here are the answers below. Why De Hek didn't provide these answers, only he will know : 

**1. Who controls the system now?**  
The Qoin Foundation.

**2. Is the migration necessary?**  
Yes. Qoin has migrated from its original blockchain to the Base blockchain, which is widely regarded as one of the safest, most reputable, fastest, and lowest-cost blockchains available. This represents the most significant upgrade to the Qoin ecosystem to date

**3. What if something goes wrong?**  
Users can contact the Qoin Foundation directly at: [**contact@qoin.com**]()

**4. Is this a scam or a genuine wallet?**  
Qoin has already undergone a two-year ASIC audit and investigation, along with two high-profile Australian Federal Court cases. These processes determined that Qoin was *not* a scam. While some technical issues and statements were criticised, regulators did not shut the project down or prevent it from trading. Instead, they recommended changes to ensure ongoing compliance — many of which have already been implemented.

Given that regulators and courts with far greater authority than a YouTube commentator have already addressed this question, it’s unclear why De Hek feels the need to re-litigate it. That naturally raises the question: what is he actually trying to achieve?

One particularly odd omission is that De Hek doesn’t mention the **Qoin Foundation** at all in his video, despite its central role in governance and communication. This absence is strange, especially considering that Qoin users have received multiple official communications from the Foundation. Was this left out deliberately to create uncertainty or fear? It’s hard not to wonder.

Another major issue is that De Hek fails to mention the four other wallets available to users who don’t wish to use the Opteq Wallet. These include **Coinbase, Kraken, MetaMask, and Rainbow** — some of the most recognised wallets in the crypto space, with a combined user base of over 150 million users globally. If the Opteq Wallet is supposedly problematic, why not present these alternatives?

The most confusing moment comes when De Hek promotes his own crypto investigation services, offering to investigate projects for **$300 cash**, while also encouraging viewers to “buy him a coffee” through a donation app. That raises an obvious question: if Qoin hasn’t sold Qoin for years, the Opteq Wallet can’t sell Qoin, and the Qoin Foundation isn’t offering investment packages — what *exactly* is the scam he’s protecting people from? The only clear cash transaction on offer appears to be paying *him*.

Based on that, I’ll be keeping my money, and I’d politely suggest that whoever paid for this particular investigation might consider asking for their money back.

To be clear, this isn’t a blanket criticism of all of De Hek’s work. He has genuinely exposed real global scams that have cost innocent people millions, and that deserves recognition.

However, in this case, I strongly disagree with both his analysis and his presentation of the Opteq Wallet and the Qoin migration and suggest that people complete their own thorough analysis.  ",1,1767583630.0,Qoin2025,0,1.0,False

By day, I live in a very put-together and professional world. Outside of that, I lean more expressive, curious, and much less restrained. Style has always been part of how I communicate. In and out of the office. It’s important to me that I look put together! I’d say I lean to a timeless, classic but feminine look…though I love to push boundaries.

I’m faceless by choice. I like keeping some things to myself and letting the vibes do the work.

I love animals and donate to multiple rescues; horses, farm animals, dogs and cats. It’s something I’m very passionate about.

When I’m not working, you’ll usually find me hiking, cooking, hosting friends, chasing good coffee (Seven Brew is my fav), ordering espresso martinis from my favorite spot, scouting a menu for shrimp cocktail and arguing that cheesesteaks should only come from Philly!

I’m a plant mom and love to garden in the summer! I prefer a wide, open, green space to explore over the towering steel of the city….but I do love pretending to be a city girl and spend the occasional weekend in a nearby east coast city with my husband.

In 2026 I’d like to get back into reading and doing more expressive things… hopefully to post here and show you all! Stick around and see what 2026 brings for me🍑💋

At home I already use a Lagom P80, so this hand grinder is only for when I leave the house and brew for friends/family.

Current grinder: Kinu M47 Phoenix  
Brewers: OXO Rapid Brewer (soup), V60 v3 large output recipe  
Roast: light to light-medium  
Goal: clean, sweet, approachable filter coffee (good clarity, not thin)

I’m deciding between:

* Comandante C40 (possibly Lab burr variants)
* Timemore M01

Main questions:

* Compared to Kinu, does C40 give noticeably cleaner / clearer cups for pourover?
* How does M01 compare in clarity, body, and overall forgiveness?
* Any meaningful differences in fines, texture, or astringency?
* For filter-only use, is stock C40 adjustment enough? Is Red Clix unnecessary?

If I go with C40, are any upgrades actually worth it for travel use?

* Red Clix
* Magnetic catch cup
* External adjustment ring
* Handle/knob upgrades

Would stepping up to the Comandante C60 be *overkill* for a travel / brew-for-others grinder, or does it offer a meaningful improvement over the C40 in this context?

The coffee at the Golden Spoon tastes like they boiled an old shoe. I'm staring at a slab of meatloof that's the color of a week old bruise. I push it around my plate with a fork. I take a glimpse outside. The city drizzle smears the neon lights into a watercolor painting of a bad decision. My name is Christopher Hall. In another life I probably would've been a character in a book somebody like me would've read. Now I'm just a guy with a gun, a PI license, and a knee that aches when it's about to rain.

Marge the waitress, who's been serving me coffee since I was still on the force, shuffles over and tops me off. ""You look like hell, Chris.""

""Feel like I live there, Marge. Just payin' rent."" I force a smile that her eyes don’t see. ""Getting too old for this. Thought I left chasing shadows behind when I got the boot. Turns out, they just have better hours on the more private side of things.""

She gives me that look. The one that says *I've heard it all before, honey*. She's not wrong. This morning's job was tailing a cheating accountant who thought his mistress's condo was a secret. He practically waved at me from the freeway. Easy money. Soul crushing for sure, but easy.

The real fun started yesterday. A woman named Ellen Reid hired me. All pearls and quiet desperation. Her kid Leo wasn't sleeping. He was having nightmares about a ""Hat Man."" I nodded along filing it under ""rich people problems,"" and took her hefty retainer. My theory? Some creep in a costume getting his kicks. Find the guy, snap a photo, let the cops handle it. Case closed.

Now, I'm parked across the street from her perfect little colonial house watching the perfect little suburban street in its darkness. The only sound is the swishes of my wipers and the faint static of the police scanner I keep on for background noise. 10:47 PM. My log for the night reads: *""Subject residence quiet. No signs of ghouls, goblins, or other things that go bump in the night. Client likely needs a therapist not a P.I. Going home in an hour.""*

I'm just about to kill the engine when I see him.

He doesn't walk out from behind a tree. He separates from the shadow of the trees. Like the darkness itself decided to stand up. He's tall. Too tall. I grimace from what he's wearing. A long coat that hangs straight down not moving in the damp breeze. A fucking pervert I thought. On his head is the silhouette of a top hat. A goddamn top hat. In this neighborhood.

My next thought is annoyance. *Great. A prankster.* I grab my DSLR ready to get a crystal clear shot of this joker's face and end this nonsense tonight.

But he doesn't head for the front door. He glides across the lawn and stops right under a second story window. The kid's window per what the mother told me about their house layout.

And then he starts to climb.

No ladder. No drainpipe. He just puts his hands and feet on the brick siding and starts to scuttle up it like a goddamn spider. The movement is fluid and unnatural. A cold knot forms in my gut. A feeling I haven't had since I saw a grenade go the wrong way in Kandahar. I drop the camera into my lap and fumble for my voice recorder. My thumb fumbled the record button.

""This is Hall,"" I whispered. My breath fogged the window. ""I have a visual on the suspect. Male, tall, dark coat... Jesus Christ. He's climbing the goddamn wall.""

He reaches the window ledge. He doesn't try to open it. He places a flat hand against the glass pane. For a second the window looks like it's made of water. It rippled and distorted the light from the kid's nightlight inside. Then, without a sound, the Hat Man just steps through. Like the glass wasn't even there.

I sit there while my heart tried to beat its way out of my chest. The part of my brain that’s cynic, a cop, a realist, is screaming for an explanation. A projector or a hologram. This was some kind of goddamn ninja magic I've never heard of. But the part of me that's just an animal that hides in a metal box on a dark street knows what I saw. It was impossible.

I pick up my notepad. My hands shook just enough to make my scrawl look even more like a doctor's signature.

*23:14 hrs. Suspect entered the premises. Not through a door. Through the fucking window. This isn't a creep. This is something else.*

I stare at that sentence. *Something else.* That's not a conclusion. That's a surrender. The cop in me, the part that got discharged for excessive force because I never knew when to quit, screams at me. You don't let the perp get away. You don't sit in the car while he's inside. You act.

My hand is on the door handle before I've even made the decision. The cold night air hits me like a slap as I get out. I left the engine running. I cross the street staying in the shadows of the opposite lawns. The Reid house is silent. I'm under the window now looking up. Nothing. Just the dark glass of Leo's room capturing the night light.

I can't let this stand. I put my foot on the first brick. It's too slick. I try to get a grip. My fingers searching for a hold in the mortar. It's useless. The brick might as well be coated in oil. My foot slips and scrapes down the wall taking a chunk of mortar with it. I land hard on my ass in the damp grass.

For a second I just lie there staring up at the starless sky. I feel like a fool. An old washed up fool trying to fight a ghost with bare hands. A surge of pure hot rage hits me. I scramble to my feet and kick the base of the wall. ""Goddamn it!"" I shouted through gritted teeth into the night. The house doesn't care. The neighborhood doesn't care.

I defeatedly limp back to my car. My pride was  more bruised than my tailbone. I sink into the driver's seat. There's nothing to do now but wait. He'll have to come out sometime. I'll be here when he does.

I prop my head against the cold glass of the window. My eyes fixed on that second story opening. I'll just rest them for a minute. Just one minute.

The next thing I know the car is filled with a blinding light and a sound like a hundred tiny bells. Sunlight. I jerk awake my neck screaming in protest. I glance at the dash. 7:18 AM. I slept for eight hours. My head pounds and my mouth tastes like an ashtray. I frantically scan the house. The window is just a window. No sign of the Hat Man.

Out on the street a couple of kids on brightly colored bikes are racing each other. Their laughter echoing in the morning air. They look so normal. So untouched by the darkness that crept into their neighborhood last night. One of them, a little girl with pigtails, looks right at me. She then looks back at her friend and they pedal away giggling. They have no idea.

I start the car. The diner. I need coffee and food. As I pull away from the curb I dig my flip phone out of my pocket. I thumb through the contacts until I find ""Reid, Ellen."" It rings twice.

""Mr. Hall?"" Her voice sounded hopeful.

""Mrs. Reid,"" I tiredly sighed. ""It's Chris Hall.""

""Did you see him? Did you find anything?""

I hesitate picturing the shadow climbing the wall. The window rippling like water. ""I saw something,"" I said choosing my words carefully. ""But I lost him. He's slippery. Look, I'm going to need another night. I'll try a different approach tomorrow.""

I can hear her deflate on the other end of the line. ""Oh. Okay. Tomorrow, then.""

""I'll be in touch."" I snap the phone shut and toss it onto the passenger seat. The lies always tasted the worst. I didn't lose him. He vanished. And I, Christopher Hall ex cop, ex soldier, now turned professional ghost chaser, fell asleep on the job. I drive towards the diner. Maybe a greasy spoon of reality will wash the impossible out of my mouth.",5,1767583431.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,0.86,False

Emily froze at the kitchen window, her coffee mug halfway to her lips. _
The porch light next door flickered like a bad omen on this chilly Toronto October night. _
She'd caught her dad, Robert, out there again—with Victoria. _
Laughing. _
Too close. _
His hand grazing hers in that ""accidental"" way that screamed anything but. _

Subtle sexual tension crackled through the air, even from here. _
Victoria, the high-flying corporate exec with her BMW parked like a trophy in the driveway. _
Their Scarborough neighborhood was full of folks like Emily's family—factory workers, part-time clerks, scraping by. _
But Victoria? _
She embodied the elite, the kind of success that made Robert's stagnant supervisor job feel like a trap. _

Emily's pulse quickened. _
Class disparity hit home hard tonight. _
Why did Dad keep crossing that fence? _
Jealousy twisted in her gut—not just over the affair she suspected, but the way he favored her brother Alex, the ""golden boy"" mechanic. _
She was the teacher, the fixer, always overlooked. _

Her mom, Patricia, shuffled in, still in her wrinkled uniform from the discount store. _
""Em, you're glued to that window again. _
What's eating you?"" _

Emily turned, forcing a tight smile. _
""Just... Dad's out there chatting with Victoria. _
Again. _
Doesn't it bug you, Mom? _
Her flashing all that wealth while we're pinching pennies?"" _

Patricia sighed, rubbing her temples. _
""Hon, he's probably just venting about work. _
Factory life's no picnic. _
Hand me the bread—dinner's Tim Hortons leftovers tonight."" _

But Emily couldn't let it go. _
She slipped out back, the crisp air nipping at her skin. _
The fence slats were splintered, easy to peer through. _
Robert's voice carried: ""Vic, you get it—climbing the ladder, leaving the grind behind. _
I envy that."" _

Victoria's laugh was low, inviting. _
""You could have more, Robert. _
My connections? _
They'd open doors for you."" _

Their silhouettes leaned in, a brush of shoulders that lingered too long. _
Emily's stomach churned. _
Paternal betrayal? _
It fit the pieces—late nights, evasive answers. _

Back inside, Alex sprawled on the couch, remote in hand, grease under his nails from the garage. _
""Yo, Sis, you look pissed. _
Spill."" _

She eyed him, sibling rivalry flaring. _
""Dad's out there with Victoria. _
It's not just talk, Alex. _
He's... different around her."" _

Alex snorted, popping a beer. _
""Paranoid much? _
Dad's a stand-up guy. _
Probably networking or whatever. _
Chill."" _

His blind loyalty grated—always the favorite, never questioning. _
Dinner was tense: pasta from a box, sauce from a jar. _
Robert avoided her gaze, phone vibrating in his pocket. _
Patricia picked at her food, silent. _

Upstairs later, Emily paced her room. _
She grabbed her laptop, typing furiously: ""signs of marital infidelity."" _
Results flooded in—emotional affairs, secret meetups, class envy fueling forbidden desires. _
It matched. _

Digging deeper, she remembered his jacket downstairs. _
Heart racing, she crept down, fishing through the pocket. _
A receipt: upscale cafe downtown, not his usual spot. _
Timestamped during ""overtime."" _
Scribbled note: ""Missed you already. V."" _

Proof. _
Her world spun. _
This wasn't just cheating—it was cross-class betrayal, Victoria exploiting Dad's upward mobility dreams. _
Jealousy surged; revenge flickered in her mind. _
Confront? _
Expose? _
Or play it smart? _

Midnight struck. _
The front door creaked. _
From her window, Emily watched Robert slip out, heading straight to Victoria's glowing porch. _
A hushed whisper, a shared laugh, then—his arm around her waist. _
No accident this time. _

Emily's fists clenched. _
This affair would destroy them all. _
But she wouldn't let it. _
Tomorrow, she'd start digging—for evidence, for leverage. _
The fences were fracturing, and the storm was just beginning. _
A gut-punch revelation waited, one that would redefine everything. _",1,1767583429.0,familydrama,1,1.0,False

I know importing into foundry is good, but Foundry has too many bells and whistles with character sheets and dice rolling and all that.  Because we are in person with real math rocks, and miniatures, those features are unnecessary.

1q4ahm8,https://open.substack.com/pub/davidrmann3/p/three-predictions-about-mocktails?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&utm_medium=web,Three Predictions About Mocktails in Restaurants: The Year Everything Changes,"**Three Predictions About Mocktails in Restaurants: The Year Everything Changes**

The mocktail isn’t a trend anymore. It’s a margin opportunity that most operators are still sleeping on.

Over the past four years, mocktails appeared on restaurant menus with rising frequency as consumer demand shifted toward alcohol-free alternatives. 44% of restaurants are actively expanding their mocktail menus to meet rising health-conscious demand. The global mocktail market was valued at $8.38 billion in 2025 and is expected to reach $16.02 billion by 2035, growing at 5.7%. Especially for Gen Z and Millennials, these numbers matter because they signal a shift in how diners see socializing, self-care, what they’re willing to pay for. If you run a restaurant or manage a bar, 2026 is the year you stop treating mocktails as an afterthought and start treating them as a portfolio business inside your beverage program. Here are the three predictions that will shape how you should think about mocktails this year.​

**Prediction One: Premium Pricing on Mocktails Will Stick, But Only If You Invest in Craft**

A third of Gen Z adults have purchased or made a mocktail in the past 30 days, compared to 18% of Millennials and under 10% of adults 45 and older.

The problem is that most restaurants treat mocktails like they’re easy. A splash of this, some sparkling water, a fruit garnish, and you’ve got a mocktail. That approach kills you on two fronts. First, you price it too low because the labor feels cheap. Second, you don’t deliver enough sensory complexity to justify the premium price your guests expect to pay.

Price mocktails at 80% of what you charge for a comparable cocktail, which is the winning move for 2026 if it makes margin sense. Justify that price through craft. Use house-made syrups. Source better fruit. Build layered flavor through fermentation, infusions, and bitters that most operators haven’t touched yet. Make each mocktail take as much time and skill to prepare as an alcoholic cocktail. Your guests, especially younger diners, will notice. They’ll order again. And your average check grows because they’re not trading down from a $15 cocktail to a $7 soda.

At Tupelo Honey Cafe in Asheville, North Carolina, the corporate beverage director launched house-made ginger beer and a non-alcoholic Bee’s Knees using Lyre’s Pink London Spirit. The results were that guests ordered mocktails because they perceived them as genuinely crafted, not as an obligation for non-drinkers. This is the playbook. Premium ingredients plus visible labor equals pricing power.​

Consider also that over 55% of consumers moderating their alcohol intake are looking for pre-mixed sober options. These drinkers aren’t price-sensitive in the traditional sense. They’re value-sensitive. They want to know that what they’re drinking is intentional, not a default.​

Fermented tea bases are emerging as the secret weapon for building adult-flavored mocktails without relying on heavy sweetness or artificial taste profiles. A long-aged fermented tea base, like kombucha, kefir, or a proprietary house ferment, gives you structure, organic acid, and subtle bitterness that mimics the mouthfeel of spirits. Layer in botanical bitters, citrus, and fresh herbs, and you’ve got something that feels like a real drink, not a juice compromise. The cost is negligible. The perception is everything.​

**Prediction Two: Functional Ingredients Will Become Your Competitive Moat**

Adaptogens, nootropics, fermented botanicals, and CBD are moving from wellness retail into mainstream restaurant culture. This isn’t wellness theater. It’s the next chapter of how younger diners make social choices.​

Among canned non-alcoholic cocktails tested in consumer research, CBD and mood-boost versions performed best in demand studies, with CBD additions increasing demand by 13% compared to standard formulations. That demand can translate to higher pricing and larger check sizes if your team is educated on the why behind the ingredients.​

For restaurants, the opportunity is straightforward but requires discipline. Build mocktails that feature functional ingredients as story elements, not gimmicks. If you add ashwagandha to a house mocktail, tell guests why. If you’re using reishi mushroom in a fermented tea base, explain what it does. This isn’t false health claiming. It’s transparency about ingredients that have been used in traditional medicine for centuries and are now being validated by peer-reviewed research into stress reduction, immune support, and sleep quality.

However, don’t claim that any mocktail is medicinal or capable of treating illness. That’s a legal minefield and will destroy trust faster than anything else. Instead, position functional ingredients as intentional additions that support wellness rituals. A mocktail with ashwagandha isn’t medicine. It’s a drink designed for guests who want to unwind with the same ritual they’d have with alcohol, minus the intoxication and next-day fatigue.​

Fermented ingredients, kombucha, kefir, tepache, koji-inspired beverages are also breaking through. These aren’t new, but they’re moving beyond health food stores into upscale restaurant programs. A fermented ginger shrub or lacto-fermented citrus blend adds gut-health credibility and flavor complexity that younger diners are actively seeking. According to consumer research on fermented food trends, 44.2% of respondents consume fermented foods for digestion and wellness, three times more than those who choose them purely for bold flavor. 34% of consumers say they’re more likely to trust a new fermented product when it carries a clear health benefit, such as probiotic support.​

**Prediction Three: Mocktail Profitability Will Become Your Non-Negotiable Competitive Advantage**

In 2026, the beverage program that moves from alcohol-centric to a portfolio strategy wins.

Non-alcoholic beverages are expected to grow at 5.7% annually through 2035, while traditional alcohol grows at only 1%. The restaurants that thrive in 2026 will stop seeing mocktails as a customer-service obligation and start treating them as the primary profit driver of their beverage business.​

The reality is that most restaurants price mocktails too low because they perceive them as easy to make and low-cost. They’re not. A properly crafted mocktail requires fresh juice, house-made syrups, specialty bitters, premium spirits alternatives (brands like Lyre’s, Seedlip, and Ritual cost $35 to $50 per bottle), quality ice, and skilled labor. When you break down the cost, you’re often at 30% to 35% food cost on a $10 mocktail. Your margins should reflect the work. You need to price it correctly.

The strategic play for 2026 is menu engineering. Build 3 to 5 hero mocktails that are non-negotiable fixtures on your menu. Price them at $11 to $14, if it costs out right. Build the margins by using high-cost, high-perception ingredients. Rotate 2 to 3 limited-time mocktails monthly, keeping the winners and cutting underperformers. Analyze which mocktails pair best with food. Attach them to specific dayparts. A morning mocktail might feature coffee or matcha. An afternoon refresher might feature fermented citrus and sparkling water. An evening aperitif might feature adaptogens and botanical spirits.​

Track every sale. Measure attachment to food orders. If a mocktail drives appetizer orders up by 12%, it’s doing real work. If a mocktail cannibalizes sales from another beverage, cut it and replace it with something better. Use technology to measure which beverages actually move the margin and which ones are just ego plays.​

The profitability equation is that in 2026, full-service and casual restaurants can no longer afford to treat beverage programs as static. The restaurants that thrive will treat their beverage portfolio like a hedge fund treats its holdings. Optimizing for margin. Test new products weekly. Scale winners faster than the competition.

44% of restaurants report mocktails as expanding due to rising health-conscious demand. Awareness of a trend isn’t execution. The difference between the operators winning today and the ones stuck in 2025 is that the winners will have a documented mocktail strategy. They’ll know their cost per serve. They’ll price for margin, not sentiment. They’ll educate their service team on functional ingredients. They’ll rotate aggressively. They’ll measure everything.​

**What This Means for Your Business Right Now**

Start with one hero mocktail. Something that reflects your restaurant’s identity. If you’re a steakhouse, that might be a high-alcohol-alternative spirit with bitter botanicals and fermented tea. If you’re casual dining, it might be a kombucha-based refresher with fresh fruit and house syrup. Train your bartender on why you built it. Price it at $12. Measure what happens to your check size.

By March 2026, add a second mocktail. Test a functional ingredient. Something with adaptogens. Reishi. Ashwagandha. Lion’s mane. Don’t make health claims. Just tell guests what’s in it and why you chose it.

By May 2026, rotate your first limited-time offering. Fermented fruit shrub. Koji-inspired botanicals. Something with technique and story.

By July, measure which mocktails drove the highest check attach, the highest repeat rate, and the highest perceived value. Double down on those. Cut the rest.

The mocktail era isn’t coming in 2026. It’s already here. The question is whether you’re going to treat it like a trend or like the most important margin opportunity your beverage program has seen in a decade.

Maybe this is the first wave of a midlife crisis, maybe not. Either way, enough is enough. I want to escape a life of average comfortability and actually try — to dream again and see what my life could become.

In full honesty, this post is for me, not for thee. I have a deep fear of people and their judgment. I don’t like being perceived, because if no one sees me, no one can hold me accountable.

So I’m using that fear as a tool.

For all of 2026, I’ll post a weekly accountability update here. I’ll be 100% transparent about my actions, spending, progress, setbacks, and thoughts. The focus is simple: small, consistent improvements over time. Progress over perfection.

Feedback, ideas, and constructive criticism are welcome.



# Weekly Format

**Topic:** *(Goal)* — Current — Notes

**Fitness**

I will be looking to run everyday and to improve my other areas listed here. I used to be more into running but have not run continuously more than 2 months at a time for over 9 years. Would love to improve this area and other general fitness areas.

* **Running:** (15:xx 5K | 2:59 Marathon) - I ran a 20:19 5k time ran this weekend to find my benchmark. I have never ran a marathon so would love to try this distance out this year. Might be unrealistic but might as well try.
* **Weight:** \- 197  
* **Push-ups:** (100) - 37    
* **Pull-ups:** (20) - 5    
* **Plank:** (300s) - 90s  

**Finances**

I have really let my finances slide recently and want to start saving towards a house and paying down my credit card before July when my interests payments start. TBH, I am horrible with expenses so any help here would be much appreciated!

* **Income:** $4,960/month (after taxes)  
* **Expenses:** Rent/utilities $1,500 | Student loans $346 + $430 | Gym $150   
* **Remaining:** \~$2,534 
* **Credit Card:** $10,000 
* **Weekly Spend:** \*Will start tracking this next week

**Professional**

I work in the cybersecurity field and have a great job but would love to move into the field of penetration testing. Relatively new and have completed a few CompTIA into to mid level certs but now I am looking to finish the INE eJPT certification by mid February.  

 Would love any professional advice in this area!

* **Cert Progress:** \*will give updates/progress tracking in this area starting next week.

**Personal**

* **No Drinking / No Games:** I’m cutting out drinking and video games because they’re my default escape. It’s too easy to have a drink and play a round (or 20) of something like LoL instead of doing the uncomfortable work that actually moves my life forward.  
* **Korean:** (TOPIK II) -I have a family that is Korean, and I’ve been putting off learning for too long. I’m starting a weekly Korean class at the end of January, and I want to track progress consistently - should I log vocabulary learned, practice exercises, or something else to keep myself accountable?  
* **Chess:** (1800) - I’m unrated right now and will begin attending weekly tournaments to track my rating progress and document lessons learned. My first tournament will be later this week and will give updates towards this, and I’ll add notes after each event to see growth over time.  
* **Coffee:** (Pop-up goal) - It’s my dream to eventually open a cafe, and I want to start building skills toward that this year. I’m thinking of ways to track progress - should I log recipes, tastings, or small pop-up experiments?  
* **Photography:** (1 photo/week?) - I want to start taking one photo per week to practice and document my skills. I’m not sure if I should post them weekly, create a personal log, or track it another way - feedback welcome on how to make this measurable and meaningful.

Make this week your best week yet. Don’t settle.

This is our new home for all things related to **source-verified Naturopathy and Ayurveda.** I built NatureNani because I was tired of conventional treatments that often ""mask"" minor symptoms until they grow into major health issues. Our goal here is to use ancient wisdom to identify **root causes** and restore balance to the body naturally.

**What to Post** We want this to be a ""Feedback Lab"" where we learn together. Please feel free to share:

* **Health Queries:** Ask about a symptom or trigger, and I’ll use the NatureNani engine to share what traditional texts say.
* **Your Experiences:** Share your journey with natural remedies—what worked, what didn't, and what ""aha!"" moments you’ve had.
* **App Feedback:** Tell us what you want to see in the NatureNani app. How can we make it easier for you to understand your own body?
* **Photos & Insights:** Found a helpful herb or a great passage in a traditional text? Post it!

**Community Vibe** We’re all about being **friendly, constructive, and grounded.** We respect modern medicine for emergencies, but here, we focus on prevention and deep healing. Let’s build a space where everyone feels comfortable sharing their health journeys without judgment.

**How to Get Started**

1. **Introduce yourself** in the comments below! What brought you to the world of natural healing?
2. **Post a question** today! Even a simple ""Why do I feel sluggish in the afternoon?"" can spark a great search and conversation.
3. **Invite a friend** who is tired of ""pill-for-an-ill"" culture and wants to understand the *why* behind their health.
4. **Interested in helping out?** As we grow, I’ll be looking for moderators who are passionate about Ayurveda and Naturopathy. Reach out if you’d like to apply!

Thanks for being part of the very first wave. Together, let’s make r/NatureNani the ultimate bridge to ancient wisdom.

1q4aenj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BloodcurdlingTales/comments/1q4aenj/goatwitch/,Goatwitch,"She said her name was Maab. He didn't believe her. Until the end. 

Earliest morning. Still dark. The far off horizon hadn't yet birthed the sun. She'd said it must be so. 

He followed her, the hunched over black robed and hooded goblin shape that had only the semblance of a woman's old and weathered voice with which to perhaps mark her as human. 

She was not one of God's children. 

He followed her into the graveyard. So that they might fulfill the rite. 

And pull one back. 

She said it could be done. The thing that might be a woman that called itself Maab. And though it was vile blasphemy to do so, Wyckoff prayed that the foul shape in black was able to actually perform the ebon necromantic arts. 

Please. God forgive me. Please. 

I just want her back. Please just give her back to me. 

Maab-thing had croaked orders to him before they'd departed the village proper. Instructions. And materials needed. 

The place, the wound in time and nature, it must drink…

The place was shrouded in swamp gas and white blankets of heavy rolling fog. It was the only thing moving with any kind of life in the rotten cemetery. Neglected. Time had won a terrible battle here. Bomb-blasted and nearly primeval. It was as if the prehistoric age was reaching a clawing vengeful grasp from all the way back and digging in its terrible wounding marks here. 

In this place. Of cold. And sweat. 

Everything was rotten and rotting in this place and Wyckoff would've sworn that he felt the very air of the foul place begin on him its own putrefying process of slow decay. 

If I stay here long enough with that crawling she-thing my own hair and teeth and flesh and tissue will just liquify to green and melt away. Mayhap how she came to be in such a condition. 

He didn't like to look at her but he needed her so he kept behind her, the witch-woman Maab and he followed her to the pulling place. Time womb. 

Hellmouth. 

Oh God… why did I ever put you in this place…? Whatever compelled me to put you in the ground here… why did I leave you in this rotting dark place…? 

A great wail, electrical throated animal cry from somewhere in the pale. From within the white shrouded dead dark. It sounded both desperate animal and malfunctioning failing mechanics, atonal techo-organic, a metallic KO from another obsidian world. 

Wyckoff clapped his cold sweating greasy palms, filthied, to his ears and cried back in response. Begging it to stop. Maab the witch-thing just cackled her snapping shrubbery laughter and urged the fragile man forward. 

He went. They went on. 

…

They came to the place and she turned and regarded him then. 

She threw back the hood. Wyckoff suppressed a shriek. 

Her flesh was as melted wax. Mishapen and sculpted by a cruel hand wielded by a demented mind. Tissue as clay bubbled and erupted in scarred mutilated remnant of a woman's face. Yellow eyes gazed reptilian from within the distorted warped features of a hag-lizard, snake-bitch design. 

Someone had tried to burn her before. Someone had tried to burn this witch once already. Someone had put her to the stake. 

Yet here she stood. 

She thrummed with power. Wyckoff could feel it. They stood over the cold lonely grave of his Paula. She'd said it was perfect. It was right next to the bastard womb. It was right beside the cradle of filth that was a womb of light only shrouded in shadow. She would show him. 

He would see. 

He brought forth the knapsack at her instruction. The small creature inside had ceased struggling in the journey through this sour bastard land. But as he raised it before them both, the cat inside must've sensed their terrible intent for it renewed its thrashings and yowling. Reinvigorated. Revived. Brought to life. 

Maab spoke. Wyckoff nodded. Brought forth the great blade. 

It was a large hunting knife. Beautiful. Ornate handle with a sparrow in flight with a sprig of fig leaf in its beak carved into the handle by Paula's father. For the wedding. A gift. So long ago. 

She laughed at him and told him to stop dawdling. And laughed at him again. Her dry cackles the dead cracking rustles of little animal bones jostled in the killing den of the black nest. 

He attempted to pray. To God. For forgiveness. 

She yelled. Scorned. She told the little fool that the Jew God had no power over this blind land. Some places spoiled and were lost to the other side. Enemy territory, she called it. And smiled a sliming black smile. It wet the dry leather of her lips to a dripping ebon-green. She stretched out her thin skeletal-goblin arms and splayed out her claws. 

Begin then, bade the witch. 

He did. 

Holding the struggling small satchel aloft over the grave of his lost love, he plunged the long hunting blade into the pregnant teardrop bulge filled with feline life and stilled the beast. 

The blood, warm, flowed. 

Spilled. Onto the grave. 

The warm blood flowed forth and Maab began to sing-speak. Throat-screech bastard tongue and black words that were eons old when the Earth was virginal and new. 

Wyckoff held the bleeding thing where it was and let it pour onto the terrible land that held his Paula prisoner. He let the earth drink so that she may be once more set free. 

please give her back to me…

At first nothing … …

A beat …

But then the blood, thick and growing darker in color like pitch, began to pool about the wretched little grave. Unnaturally. Accumulating and growing in an abundance that was not in sensible correlation with what flowed forth from the small dead beast in satchel and into the growing pool. 

It began to dance. The surface of blood. With little ripples that suggested movement. Life. Something moved beneath its surface. Something was alive inside.

Wyckoff began to sweat despite the cold. His eyes were wide in a bulge and unbelieving. His visage was all a mask of greasy grimey flesh and desperate gazing eyes. Wide. Wide as the whole Earth. 

It began to emerge. And Maab began to laugh. 

And sing.

Naked. She dripped with thick ichor. Hair matted down in a blanket mass. Her breasts and figure more plump and ample than before in life. Lips full, generous mouth slitted in a smirk. Her eyes were ghostly aglow with mischievous light. 

Wyckoff saw all of this and none of this. His wide eyes never blinked. Paula…

Her smirk grew wider to a grin and the grin grew teeth. 

She raised her bare arms to him and held them out and open. Come. Come into them. Come to me. 

Wyckoff obeyed the gesture without hesitation. 

Within her arms he knew he made a mistake. It was cold. Colder than the earth. As ice of the Scandinavian warrior's hell. He tried to pull away immediately but found she was endowed with terrible strength. He struggled a moment, dread and worry and not comprehending what was happening even as it occurred trap-like all around him. 

He looked up into her face then. The thing that should be Paula but wasn't. 

The visage had begun to crack. The mask had begun to deteriorate. The pores first deepened and filled with coagulant and filth and then began to squirt and spray out like rancid milk and cheese. The eyes suddenly burst into flame and began to roast within the failing skull as the once immaculate face and flesh of his beloved Paula began to slough away. 

It fell to the cursed earth with a slop. What was behind the mask was a dreadful mess, a wild chaos set of eyes and teeth and mandibles and tendrilic hissing things of the color pink.  

Maab howled laughter and discarded her robe. She too was naked beneath. 

Her misshapen flesh and goblin-woman form began to shift and change as the scar-tissue of her ravaged form began to undulate and dance and manipulate. 

Bones snapped as she grew taller. Twice. Twice her height. Cracking could be heard in tandem with Wyckoff’s desperate screaming amongst the rolling white clouds of fog and the sour damp stones of the cemetery graves. 

Fur. It grew wild and patchy and all over. But inconsistent. Like a sick animal that should be dead from pestilence but isn't because it is the devil's harbinger. 

Her face stretched and these bones snapped too but Maab just laughed. Loving it. Loving all of this. She always loved to take this shape. 

Horns erupted from wiry dry witch hair that was more straw from the floor of a barn than anything alive. They were coated in something that had once been human blood but now was the noxious color and odor of seaweed. 

Her eyes changed color and composition. Pupils swirled like milk within a cup of coffee into blasphemous cross shapes. Terrible black Xs that were the universal shape and character that was the symbol for death. Death. 

She grew a beard upon her long misshapen chin of scarred ancient flesh. She stroked it as she watched the thing take the shrieking Wyckoff. He was begging it to stop. 

Please. He filled the cemetery, the sky, the heavens. He filled the entire world and universe in encompass with his desperate throated pleas. 

Maab the goatwitch did not answer him. She'd already given him what he wanted. Now she was taking her part. It was all just the natural order. 

The natural order of things. 

Maab belted cruel strange animal laughter into the sky in duet tandem with Wyckoff and his desperate caterwauls of mind-flaying insanity. They filled the sky together and the day never came to be.

I think this is for the classy young man, probably better suited for those 25+. Hawas Viper immediately feels grown: dark, warm, and composed. It’s not trying to be youthful or crowd-pleasing; this is something you wear for yourself.

The saffron opens dry and slightly bitter, almost leathery. There’s a cannabis note listed, but if it’s there, it’s subtle; more of a green, herbal vibe than anything smoky or skunky. 

The heart is where it clicks for me. Rich tobacco and mellow coffee take over, smooth and rounded with a touch of warmth from cinnamon. Nothing sweet or overly loud, just well-blended, refined and warm.

I can smell the dry-down bringing tonka bean, softening everything with a SLIGHTLY sweet, comforting finish. It feels grounded, confident, and complete.

Longevity is strong, pushing 9 hours straight out the box, with moderate projection. It stays noticeable, but close after the first couple of hours, which suits its more mature vibe. That said, I am 

Not a compliment “magnet” but when it is noticed, it’s “that smells expensive” type of compliment. If you’re into darker, grown-up fragrances with saffron, tobacco, and coffee, this one’s worth a shot.",1,1767582852.0,u_simocd,0,1.0,False

1q4addh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1q4addh/not_sure_where_my_marriage_stands/,Not sure where my marriage stands,"Sorry, this is going to be long.

Too long, didnt read version: married with a son, husband has betrayed me several times, not physically that I know of, married 12 years. He doesn't care about much of anything, but is usually nice and happy. But is also passive aggressive. The pain from the past still hurts, there are holes in his stories, and he doesn't feel bad about the things he has done, I cant even bring my friends around anymore because he flirts with them and makes things awkward. I regret marrying him, but I dont know if I should leave because our son (11) doesn't see the conflict, he sees us being friends. I feel stuck, I try to forgive but the hurt doesn't go away.

Im not sure what to think of my marriage. 41/f he is 48. We have an 11 year old son together, and I have 16 and 17 year old daughters from a previous marriage. From the start, when I first met my husband he was low effort with everything, he didnt pursue me, I pursued and called him. He was between homes because he was on his way up to Alaska to go gold panning but needed some money so he was trying to get a part time job. We started dating and he was just really easy going and kind, which drew me in. But he also has a passive aggressive a-hole side to him.

I thought he really cared about me, but he ended up going to Alaska anyways. He didnt really bother to call me. I felt like he was doing to me what he was doing to his ex. When we first met he was still dating his ex and he was trying to get with me, I told him no, he needed to break up with her first, but despite him saying he didnt like her he dragged his feet. Which I should've seen as a sign. While he was up in Alaska his room mate kicked him out because I guess he was paying his rent with gold instead of cash, she he ended up sleeping in an outhouse and then at a hostel. 

This was all back in 2011. He moved back down to be with me, but I think it was because I was begging him to. I was addicted to his attention and his kindness. But he was also a flirt. When we first started dating I found Facebook messages (he didnt log out on my laptop)  between him and a few other women that were flirty, and he told me they were like sisters to him. 

He always had an excuse for his flirty behavior. And he would watch porn and lie about it, we had agreed we didnt want it in our relationship. But still, he has always been a kind and selfless person. But his flaws are he doesn't seem to care about anything including paying bills, he is passive aggressive, and he has a temper sometimes. I saw him kick our cat once and he saw that I saw him and he laughed and said ""you thought I kicked the cat? 😆 "". And he has been borderline abusive to my girls by yelling at them, and one time last winter my daughter tossed snow at her brother and my husband got mad and grabbed snow and rubbed it in her face, she tried to get away and he grabbed her arm. He denied all of this and said he ""gently tossed snow at her"" and said she was lying, she was really worked up and hyperventilating. 

There have been some incidents like that. And then also the lapses in judgement, like when he took our son at 5 in the morning to go look at stars and my girls woke up and they were gone and he didnt leave a note, and since he is never near his phone he wasn't answering. My girls called me at work, but I was finally able to get ahold of him and he was mad because they are old enough to be by themselves. Not the point.

And there was an incident with his 19 year old coworker, I had just had our son and I found deleted texts on his phone, I could only retrieve the first 3 or 4 words from each. But he said something about having to go shower at work. They worked night security at a data center, so it was just the 2 of them usually in a big building with limited cameras. There ended up being an investigation done on them because some people were saying things about them, but my husband couldn't remember. But the results were sent to our house, it said they disappeared off camera for several hours, he denied this and said they were in the break room, but there are cameras over there. The last text he sent her he said ""i will miss you... all"" because he was fired. He said it was innocent. I said ""what would you think if I sent that to someone?"" He said ""i wouldn't care"", he honestly probably wouldn't. Anyways, he was 36 and she was 19. He swears on our son that nothing happened. A few women came forward and told the boss that he made them uncomfortable. He was giving them massages in a room, because he had a massage license.

So that was the 1st big thing, and then the 2nd big thing which is more recent, was that he quit his job of 10 years without telling me. So about 2 weeks before it happened he tried to aggressively get me on board with him quitting his job to go gold panning full time (he has been panning for 20 years, and so far he has only found a few hundred dollars worth of gold), he was getting really upset that I wasn't enthusiastically on board, he said we have been living my dream, so its time to live his dream and it will be fine because he will pull out his 401k and we can live off of that, and then when it starts to run out he would go back to work, he promised. So at first I agreed because I felt bad. And then after a while I changed my mind and said we should compromise, he can pan on tbe weekends to see if he could replace his job with it, he said he easily could, he said he could make over 50 grand a year doing it.

So, we agreed with the weekend situation. But a week later he comes to me to tell me Thursday would be his last day, and he also admitted he had already put in his notice weeks before our previous conversation, he was just trying to get me on board so it would be smoother. He said he knew it could be the final straw that would make me leave him but he didnt care, he said ""i knew it would either make us or break us but I didnt care"", he also knew that if I left he wouldn't see his son as much, but he said he didnt care. 

So he quit his job, I almost left him but he swore he would go to marriage counseling and also personal counseling (he went to 1 appointment and didnt like it.). He said he had the opportunity to change his mind and tell hr to retract his notice but he never did. He never found gold during those 4 months, and then money was dwindling and he was not finding work, he admitted he was dragging his feet because he didnt want to work for anyone because all jobs were thr same, all bosses were a-holes. 

Luckily his job was willing to take him back eventually. But now we have fallen behind on our mortgage and some bills are not being paid. We are working with a financial advisor that i hired to help us. He honestly couldnt care less, he is oblivious to our financial condition. I feel like even though he is kind and thoughtful most of the time, he just doesn't care if i stay or go and he doesn't see that im no longer in love with me, he doesn't see it because I am still nice to him like a friend. 

Our kids dont know about all of this conflict. If we were violent or really toxic I would be gone, but I stay for our son and because my husband still displays selfless behavior every day and goes out of his way for us, he cooks and makes me coffee, he does a lot of the running around. I feel dependent on him. Luckily I have a really good paying job, so if things were worse I could leave. 

I just feel stuck. Do I just try to forgive all of this and get past it, even though it physically hurts to be hugged and loved by him? He had said very hurtful things, but i feel addicted to his daily kindness and that's what keeps me around.

Sorry this is so long, and I probably come across as a nagging awful wife.",1,1767582772.0,Marriage,4,1.0,False

He always had an excuse for his flirty behavior. And he would watch porn and lie about it, we had agreed we didnt want it in our relationship. But still, he has always been a kind and selfless person. But his flaws are he doesn't seem to care about anything including paying bills, he is passive aggressive, and he has a temper sometimes. I saw him kick our cat once and he saw that I saw him and he laughed and said ""you thought I kicked the cat? 😆 "". And he has been borderline abusive to my girls by yelling at them, and one time last winter my daughter tossed snow at her brother and my husband got mad and grabbed snow and rubbed it in her face, she tried to get away and he grabbed her arm. He denied all of this and said he ""gently tossed snow at her"" and said she was lying, she was really worked up and hyperventilating. 

There have been some incidents like that. And then also the lapses in judgement, like when he took our son at 5 in the morning to go look at stars and my girls woke up and they were gone and he didnt leave a note, and since he is never near his phone he wasn't answering. My girls called me at work, but I was finally able to get ahold of him and he was mad because they are old enough to be by themselves. Not the point.

And there was an incident with his 19 year old coworker, I had just had our son and I found deleted texts on his phone, I could only retrieve the first 3 or 4 words from each. But he said something about having to go shower at work. They worked night security at a data center, so it was just the 2 of them usually in a big building with limited cameras. There ended up being an investigation done on them because some people were saying things about them, but my husband couldn't remember. But the results were sent to our house, it said they disappeared off camera for several hours, he denied this and said they were in the break room, but there are cameras over there. The last text he sent her he said ""i will miss you... all"" because he was fired. He said it was innocent. I said ""what would you think if I sent that to someone?"" He said ""i wouldn't care"", he honestly probably wouldn't. Anyways, he was 36 and she was 19. He swears on our son that nothing happened. A few women came forward and told the boss that he made them uncomfortable. He was giving them massages in a room, because he had a massage license.

So that was the 1st big thing, and then the 2nd big thing which is more recent, was that he quit his job of 10 years without telling me. So about 2 weeks before it happened he tried to aggressively get me on board with him quitting his job to go gold panning full time (he has been panning for 20 years, and so far he has only found a few hundred dollars worth of gold), he was getting really upset that I wasn't enthusiastically on board, he said we have been living my dream, so its time to live his dream and it will be fine because he will pull out his 401k and we can live off of that, and then when it starts to run out he would go back to work, he promised. So at first I agreed because I felt bad. And then after a while I changed my mind and said we should compromise, he can pan on tbe weekends to see if he could replace his job with it, he said he easily could, he said he could make over 50 grand a year doing it.

So, we agreed with the weekend situation. But a week later he comes to me to tell me Thursday would be his last day, and he also admitted he had already put in his notice weeks before our previous conversation, he was just trying to get me on board so it would be smoother. He said he knew it could be the final straw that would make me leave him but he didnt care, he said ""i knew it would either make us or break us but I didnt care"", he also knew that if I left he wouldn't see his son as much, but he said he didnt care. 

So he quit his job, I almost left him but he swore he would go to marriage counseling and also personal counseling (he went to 1 appointment and didnt like it.). He said he had the opportunity to change his mind and tell hr to retract his notice but he never did. He never found gold during those 4 months, and then money was dwindling and he was not finding work, he admitted he was dragging his feet because he didnt want to work for anyone because all jobs were thr same, all bosses were a-holes. 

Luckily his job was willing to take him back eventually. But now we have fallen behind on our mortgage and some bills are not being paid. We are working with a financial advisor that i hired to help us. He honestly couldnt care less, he is oblivious to our financial condition. I feel like even though he is kind and thoughtful most of the time, he just doesn't care if i stay or go and he doesn't see that im no longer in love with me, he doesn't see it because I am still nice to him like a friend. 

Our kids dont know about all of this conflict. If we were violent or really toxic I would be gone, but I stay for our son and because my husband still displays selfless behavior every day and goes out of his way for us, he cooks and makes me coffee, he does a lot of the running around. I feel dependent on him. Luckily I have a really good paying job, so if things were worse I could leave. 

I just feel stuck. Do I just try to forgive all of this and get past it, even though it physically hurts to be hugged and loved by him? He had said very hurtful things, but i feel addicted to his daily kindness and that's what keeps me around.

1q4ac0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1q4ac0b/connection_between_stress_and_seizures/,Connection between stress and seizures?,"My father is in his late 40s, and he had one ""episode""  around 2 years ago that went undiagnosed as a seizure after an EEG, stress test, and neurological workup. I believe it was also not immediately ruled as a seizure because he just slid down the wall into a curled position with no shaking, and around 1 hour of confusion after arriving at the hospital. The doctor said that since the tests were inconclusive, no driving for a year, then he could be cleared.

Today we were eating dinner at home when I asked him a question about what he was doing tomorrow/if he had a big day tomorrow. The answer he gave me was really confusing; he was speaking clearly and in full sentences, but he was answering a completely different question, unrelated to what I had asked him. 

Then he stopped speaking completely and stared blankly at me. Of course, I was terrified and started crying and screaming out, ""Why aren't you speaking? Can you hear me?"" Then shortly after, started violently shaking for around a minute, then went still, breathing hard, eyes rolled back and half closed. Of course, I called an ambulance as soon as the shaking started, and he was taken to the hospital. This time, he was given Keppra and discharged with a referral to the same neurologist that we originally saw. 

My reason for posting is to ask about others' experiences and opinions on the connection between stress and seizures. My father, like many other people, is chronically stressed about money. He also has this tendency, when he's thinking or rather spiralling about finances, to space out. He goes into states of confusion and has to ask me to repeat myself 5 or 6 times. It usually never lasts longer than a minute, but once at a coffee shop he went completely silent after a moment of confusion and didnt speak for around 5 minutes, just stared while I cried and asked why he wasn't responding. He always told me that he just tends to space out when he's stressed. But the spacing out, and the spacing out before the seizure, just feel too similar. 

I think because he doesn't want to pass the anxiety about money onto me, he is dismissive of my concerns about spacing out being connected to a bigger health problem.

Does anyone have any advice? Has anyone else had experiences similar to mine? If so, what did you do to help them/yourself? ",6,1767582667.0,Epilepsy,4,1.0,False

I’ve searched the sub and read tons of reviews but am still stuck, so hoping for some current insight.

Traveling first week of May with my husband, two kids (1.5 & 4), and my mom.

Must-haves:

	•	Oceanfront

	•	Heated pool (kiddie pool preferred, no big waterpark needed)

	•	Reliable elevators (huge deal with stroller + grandma)

	•	Clean, decent reviews

	•	Walkable to restaurants/coffee or very close

	•	Close to Boardwalk/Broadway preferred, but willing to drive 10–15 min

Places I’ve looked at:

	•	Dunes Village – looks great but recent reviews mention cold pools, loud/chaotic atmosphere

	•	Bay View – perfect location, but too many elevator complaints

	•	Island Vista – worth the higher price and distance north?

Also considering Anderson Ocean Club and Oceans One — any thoughts for families with young kids?

I don’t need luxury or newly renovated, just heated pools and working elevators 😅

Ranging from just unsolicited compliments to more concerning behaviors. It seems to be a big problem with our location and I didn’t know what I should do if it’s common at other locations or if anyone had their own tale 

This happened last night. Two men entered the cafe and without ordering sat for hours. They barely spoke to eachother except for occasional whispers. They had nice branded clothes and expensive looking watches not necessarily relevant just observations. But when I went on my lunch break and walked past one stoped me saying “are you leaving now?” Like they had been waiting for me. I said no and they asked when I got off. I ignored them and sat in the cafe even though I was going to leave and I thankfully had a headset nearby so I put it on and let my shift know what had happened and he asked if he should tell them to leave. I said no at the moment just asked him to keep an eye on the situation but after another 30 minutes they were still there watching me work and buying nothing so he approached and told them that they had to buy something to be there. They claimed to be “waiting on someone” which creeped me out a bit cause I feel like maybe they meant me. He said they had 1 minute to buy something or get out and with 5 seconds left they bought a short black coffee and moved to the spot I had been sitting in for my lunch and stayed for 2 more hours watching me not speaking to eachother eventually they got in their cars and left withought meeting anyone. probably when they realized that I wasn’t leaving anytime soon

Anyway the whole thing was really creepy and I’m not sure what I should do if they come back because I know I had seen them in there previously although I don’t remember any purchases they made so I’m sure they will be back

••••••••••••

December 14th:

I land in Netherlands. I arrive to my airbnb at 5 pm , he gets there at 530 pm. We spend the entire evening together then he ends up spending the night. One thing that caught me off guard was that he was extremely adamant about sleeping with me. Idk if it’s because there was a lot of chemistry or if it’s cause he was being a man. 

December 15th:

I had to be in belgium that day so I allowed him sleep in and on the way out at door at 4 am I gave him a hug and kiss bye and he said to text him later so I did. So he sent me a message, I misread it, got upset, and told him “I’ll text you tomorrow” and blocked him on WhatsApp and unfriended him on insta. I spent this night alone.

December 16th:

I had to be in Germany. He texted me “are you gonna ghost me?” And talk then end up getting back together and that night he ends up coming back over.

December 17th:

He had work this day but ended up calling in sick to spend time with me. He said he had to call work twice that day. Once in the morning and once in the evening to let them know he wasn’t going in and to update them on how he was feeling (kinda weird right?). 

Anyways that was my last full day there. It’s weird he didn’t want to spend the late evening and spend the night with me right? On the first day in he would tell me things like “you’re intimidating” and that he was insecure. Then , on the last day we were talking and he said “if you lived here I’d date you but I’m not sure if it would work because I get very cold”. Then I told him “I hope I don’t block you, I feel like I made a real friend in you” and he said “it would be hard to not be offended by the blocking we have good chemistry”.

So… the morning of the 17th we went to a city outside of Amsterdam and had coffee and explored the village. We then went home had lunch and he had to get a hair cut. I told him when we were waiting on our food to arrive “you can just go home after your haircut” and he was visibly caught off guard but said okay. Fast forward he’s getting ready to leave and he was so causal about leaving that it bothered me, he was like “I hope you have fun exploring Amsterdam” and I was like “wait will you actually come back when you’re done?” And he was like “only if you want me to”. 

So he ended up coming back and I had things to do so after an hour we agreed he should leave and before he left I literally just broke down crying in his arms and he held me for like ten minutes. Then I calmed down and I walked to the door to let him out and as he was walking towards the door I started to cry again and you could see in his face that hated it like his face went from calm to dropping like “ugh I don’t want to see you like this”. 

Anyways, he leaves. I told him to not text me and to just let me text him when I felt better and he agreed. When I readded him on Instagram he was like “are we going to be friends forever?” And I said “I hope so” and he said “you should just do another stop in Amsterdam”. Fast forward I end up blocking him mid conversation I explained I cared about him and would miss him but ultimately was afraid I’d disappoint him. That was almost 2 weeks ago.

I reached out on New Year’s Eve to see if maybe I could see him again but after an hour of no reply I unsent the message and reblocked him.

SIDE NOTE: earlier I asked him why he wasn’t going to spend the night and he started giving me excuses and when he realized I was sad over it he said he would stay the night.

Other things that bothered me: 

He insinuated I DoorDash food for him lol and I said no and he laughed it off

He never paid for me for anything and every time I bought food I paid fully but we always shared it. He doesn’t have a good paying job at all and even once said “it must be nice not having to worry about money” to which I replied “that’s not true at all” so maybe that’s it?

Also he kept trying to make future plans saying that I should meet him and his friends in Chicago and that he wanted to come visit me in Colorado and so on

Also he liked a girls photo, who he follows, who I found out was on a website where men fly her out to their country in exchange for intimate stuff but it was only a picture of her in Colorado lol and he knows I’m from there. And then when I blocked him he started following a couple people. 

But he showed me pics of him and his fam and wanted me to do the same with my fam

During text , after I left, he also said he didn’t want me talking to other guys and that I was his girl and that he’d be upset and jealous if I did

Our website is built by our community during hack days. I wrote a blog post a few days ago (link below) to help future contributors get up and running.

When it comes to a continual workstream like organizing a meetup, I prefer a policy of “I shouldn’t have to remember to update it” when possible.

For the Kyoto Tech Meetup site, that means that I want the site to update itself as new meetups come and old meetups go.

I thought I'd share here in case this is of interest to other Astro site builders here.



\## Tech stack

The pillars of our tech stack are:

\- Astro 5  
\- GitHub Pages  
\- GitHub Actions

  
\## Build, deploy, and cron

Our GitHub Action runs a build and deploy in these scenarios:

1. There's a merge to main  
2. The cron runs  
3. A manual build-and-deploy is triggered

  
When build-and-deploy happens, the build process does the following:

\- Updates member feeds to show recent content from our blogs  
\- Updates the on-site meetup calendar

For updating member feeds, we execute`scripts/fetch-feeds.mjs` to fetch every RSS/Atom URL in [src/data/member-feeds.json](https://github.com/kyoto-tech/kyoto-tech.github.io/blob/main/src/data/member-feeds.json?ref=ashryan.io), normalize and filter items, then write [src/data/composite-feed.json](https://github.com/kyoto-tech/kyoto-tech.github.io/blob/main/src/data/composite-feed.json?ref=ashryan.io).

For updating the meetup calendar, our [src/components/Calendar.astro](https://github.com/kyoto-tech/kyoto-tech.github.io/blob/main/src/components/Calendar.astro?ref=ashryan.io) component runs a server-side fetch. This fetch gets our upcoming event data from Meetup and bakes it into the generated HTML/JS.

I(20M) asked a couple weeks ago a girl from my universities' work group. At the time she said yes but that it couldnt be then because i only got the courage right before christmas break and she was about to leave to be with her family. But she still added that she would be down to go on a date on a later date, which i confirmed.

We're only together when we work on assignments and not often alone since its groups of about 5-6 people but when we work we tend to make a good pair, although we never go personal, only talk about college.

I inicially asked her for a coffee date, but now i'm not sure what to suggest. Since i asked inicially i feel it's my responsability to pick something nice. Got a suggestion from a friend about going to like a crepe place but still wondering if i should do something else, like a stroll, or a movie.

I also worry about how to behave. Only been one 1 date before and it wasn't bad but not great. Im also introverted, and although I believe we make a good match, and i want to learn more about her, i'm scared of turning it into an interrogation.

There's also the possibility that she doesn't see this as a date. I mean, in my language ""a date"" isn't a really used expression so i basically said i wanted to go for a coffee or something, just the two of us.

She got into a lot of trouble growing up and has a history of lying to get people in trouble but never too extreme and as far as I know it stopped once she was around 15. But I can't shake that, or how she just can't stand my husband when it comes to what I am about to share.

Last week, she asked me if we could get coffee, which we did, and she told me that Hailey is having an affair with my husband. I immediately told her she was lying and didn't believe her, but she was adamant. She claimed that she and Hailey got drunk with some high school friends and Hailey told her while super drunk and started crying. Which, they definitely did get together and drink, but there's no way of verifying the rest. She had no proof whatsoever. But she remained adamant, and started crying which I haven't seen in a long, long time, and told me she doesn't know for a fact but suspects it started happening years ago, which makes me sick to my stomach for obvious reasons.

I don't know what to do. Either she's telling the truth and my husband is having an affair with my MUCH younger sister, potentially since she was underage, which is beyond unforgivable, or my other sister is trying to destroy my marriage and potentially get my husband accused of some terrible things, which is almost unforgivable. I can't stop thinking about it and feel sick to my stomach. I'm second guessing every interaction between my husband and Hailey, and like I said they're close. I went through his phone while he was in the shower, and his texts with her were all infrequent and normal but he's not an idiot and would be communicating with her some other way. If it's even needed because she lives in our fucking house.

I don't know what to do and I can't tell anyone I know about this because my life could just blow up and I don't want it to blow up for lies my sister told",385,1767581726.0,whatdoIdo,607,0.87,False

I woke up angry again. I reminded myself that I forgave my ex - for me to let go of her.

Later today I met a lovely lady for coffee. We spent 3 hours talking and it felt great. We would have kept talking if we both didn't have other prior commitments. It was natural, not forced and amazing to experience connecting with another woman. I could feel my confidence, I could feel my natural authentic self coming out and he was connecting with another person, a physically beautiful woman, who turned out to be intelligent and emotional mature and it was great. 

For the first time in a year, the beginning of my marital problems, I didn't think about my ex-wife (of only a couple weeks). For the majority of the three hours we talked I didn't think about my ex! 

Meeting someone else is a very risky move. It could go either way; either it brings up more pain, resentment and sorrow or it calms the nervous system. I'm lucky that it actually calmed my nervous system down.

It's funny I didn't even realize I wasn't thinking about my ex wife until we parted ways after the coffee. After meeting I thought about what happened and I was shocked when I realized I didn't even think of my ex...then the anger came back 😂😂😂 I started thinking things like ""can't believe I have to do this again, I have to find someone to love and love me back"". I just let the emotion come to me and didn't try to fight it. The 3 hour void of thinking about my ex was a big enough win. I didn't need to win every battle today.


I've now set a new goal for myself. I will stop talking about my ex wife by next Friday. Talking about her is still holding onto her in a way. She doesn't deserve access to my heart, mind or soul - even if she doesn't know I'm thinking about her. I don't want her living rent free in my head. Of course I will speak about her if necessary such as in therapy, explaining my history to a date if needed or posting on this subreddit etc.


I'm going to sleep with small thoughts and feelings of anger but I'm also going to sleep with great joy that for a small time I forgot all about her today 😁 And a little excitement that there may just be a wonderful lady out there just waiting for me to find her and her find me 😁 There's still a road ahead and I will make sure I'm ready to be in the right place to give and receive love, I will not hurt another because I didn't heal properly.

Sometimes life fucking sucks! But with hard work and a little luck, after that shitty part, comes ease and joy!

(1-10) 🤔","    It's something that makes me curious... I mean, Xin is really cool, but I don't think he's canonically handsome in a way that stands out. I don't remember if anyone's ever called him handsome. More if we focus on his head/face and other physical characteristics.

    Height = 1.77 meters.
    Slanted, grayish-green eyes (which I think are like amber coffee in that world).
    Slightly dark skin tone.
    Soft cheekbones, defined but oval jawline.
    I think Xin has a long, oval head. He's not ugly; I think he's average.
    
    Kyou Kai is clearly much more attractive than him, and other characters as well.

I am mostly looking to avoid buying milk, because it never lasts long in our house and we've had bad luck where we shop with it going bad within days. 

I was wondering if anyone had ideas for what to do with what I have:

Flour, sugars, and yeast
Pancake mix
Rice
Chicken and eggs. I also think I have ham I can use, but I'm not sure if it's still good. 
Sour cream, Cream cheese, shredded cheese, ricotta cheese, and butter
Hot chocolate mix, teas, and coffee
Condiments
Homemade pumpkin and carrot purees 

I am allergic to peanut butter, which is my only true restriction. However, my baby loves it, so I can make snacks specifically for her using it. 

My audience is an almost 1 year old who can't eat choking hazards, but loves all food, and my very picky husband. 

We are trying to avoid red meat as well, bc of his gout, but we're just minimizing at this point. 

Eggs or chicken and rice is an option, but I enjoy variety.

I am mostly looking for advice on:

Meal prep lunches
Sweet snacks (likely baking stuff)
And ways to stretch dinners to last longer

We have most appliances that I can think of, cooking wise. We do not have a meat grinder, tho.

I have a now 10 year old daughter and have been dating my boyfriends for 2.5 years. I just got out of a toxic relationship of 5 years but my daughter didn’t even realize he was gone since she barely saw him, he was always gone working and not really around so she felt like it was just me and her for as long as she could remember. This is important detail for later. My now boyfriend and I moved in together quickly. We both are the type to be all in. He’s never been married or had children, although he’s always wanted to. So this was a huge change to have someone so involved and caring. We are vegetarian/daughter vegan and he adapted to our diet on his own for health. He watched my cook for a few weeks and started taking over cooking amazing meals almost every night, helping her enroll and teach her sports, make my coffee every morning and her lunch for school. He’s an acts of service guy. I make significantly more than him and we realized with his skill sets and artistic capabilities it made sense for him to be more of a house manager since she was aloof enough to not really need lots of “child sitting”. My gosh he can do it all! The first year was an adjustment. Him learning not to “over parent”, and get to this point of helpfulness. Really this amazing set up happened in year two. 

We’ve gone on three snowboarding trips to Japan and Tahoe. Traveled to NY, and New England. 

There’s one big problem though. His communication is very toxic. I didn’t realize that until we started dating he would throw extreme tantrums. Such as (before we starting dating) if they got his food wrong sometimes flip his plate over at a restaurant. He’s never done that with me, but I’ve seen his mild outbursts and they remind me of a pre-teen acting act in school. I would have never guessed this because 95% of the time he’s so easy going. Cool, calm and collected and just so easy to be around. But I do have to say encourage him to be best version of him and be his beacon of motivation often. These tantrums though are unpredictable and super triggering. A recent example; we just got back from a vacation. He immediately unpacked all of our suitcases and did all of the laundry. Honestly, sometimes he’s so amazing like that. It’s the next day and we all slept in super late which never happens and I was feeling lazy so when he went to get lunch, I got up and started folding some of the laundry. He was so mad that I touched the laundry because that was “his thing “. After deeper conversation, he felt as if when I step in and do things like laundry or dishes that I am telling him without my words that he’s not doing enough or he’s not doing it fast enough. To the bottom of my heart, I explain that’s not at all it, I was bored and genuinely enjoyed watching something on my phone while I folded laundry. It was mindless and productive, and I enjoyed it. He just gets so angry, and it shifts the entire mood in the whole house for the rest of the day though. It doesn’t feel like it’s a place of love, but maybe an insecurity. Which I can understand, but I still demand healthy communication either way.

Now I’m a lot to handle sometimes too. I own multiple businesses and like things a certain way. I’ve learned to adapt to my surroundings and not be OCD, but eventually when I’m under a lot of stress with so many people depending on me I start to clean or need things orderly because I’m too stimulated. Sometimes it’s a crippling amount of responsibility emotionally and financially. To top it off we live in one of the highest price areas in the US. I’ll make comments or jabs in hopes that others will pick up their slack. I know this is something I have to work on. You can tell when I’m in this mode though because I start moving around quickly and getting a lot of things done. This was not the case, for example with the laundry above. But I can see how he might not be able to tell the difference. 

There is some other adage stressors in a household also. That ex-boyfriend I mentioned earlier in a post also turned out to be quite crazy. A couple years after we broke up, he found out I was dating my new boyfriend who at one point did some work on his condo. He sued us both with the “intent to destroy me“. He is suing me for my house that I purchased from one of his family members. Although he does not have grounds, it’s already cost me $100,000 last year just to go through the process and probably another hundred thousand or more this coming year. Whenever I have deadlines coming up for the lawsuit or new discoveries, it gets me so angry that I even have to go through this process that my anxiety seeps through and I become short and agitated with everyone around me. When this all started last year, it really took a toll on me. Not to get into too much detail, but I started getting stomach ulcers and was bleeding internally and vaginally for 80 days. Then ended up with an ectopic pregnancy that landed me in the ER. I did have a two-year-IUD in, but luckily they caught it in time. With my lower organs sitting in the fluids/blood for that long it made me very sluggish and lethargic. I lost a lot of work and over $100,000 of income. I’m only giving these details because I think having an overall understanding of the stress can provide insight to a household dynamic.

Overall, we are naturally all pretty happy people and don’t sweat the small stuff. After some therapy and going to some naturopathic doctors, I was in much better health towards the end of the year. But the one thing that I can’t seem to figure out as if I’m overlooking this relationship dynamic. My daughter likes him and he has taught us many things, such as snowboarding, surfing, crocheting, culture,. He added stuff to our life that we never had before, and we love that. Again, he consistently tries to cook and clean and love on us and everyone in our life. But emotionally and mentally the conversations are limited and I’m always scared that he’s going to blow up again and the fights last for a while. He does not know how to shelter my daughter from this either. And she has never seen me fight with anyone before. I told him from day one that I wouldn’t get into a relationship without therapy. He had promised me from the very beginning that he would go and still has not. However, he did start a new type of brain therapy that uses electromagnetic pulsing for brain, healing, and health. In fact, I did this as well which really put me back on my feet and gave me the energy I used to have.

We’re entering a new year and clearly I have made mistakes with my relationships in the past. My daughter is getting to the age where she is very observant. I guess I’m wondering am I over-reacting and not being patient with him working on his behavioral issues? Should I give this relationship more time? When is enough time? He checks so many boxes, is this really something that should be a make or break?",0,1767581495.0,Advice,0,0.5,False
