1ot2uhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ot2uhu/single_dose_grinder_suggestions_1500/,Single dose grinder suggestions [~$1500],"I recently got a Linea Micra and an AllGround Sense. I chose the Sense for its GBW feature and ability to grind for filter. I usually stick with the same espresso beans for months, so the hopper and GBW convenience work well. However, it’s not easy to swap beans for the occasional decaf affogato or light roasts for pour overs. I didn’t consider this when choosing the Sense. I don’t plan on switching from it but looking for a single-dose grinder to pair with my setup for the other interests mentioned.

If I hadn’t bought the Sense, I probably would have gone with an MC6. I can’t justify another $2500 for a grinder so I have been considering the Niche Zero or Duo. I’m not a big fan of the Option-O “look” so haven’t looked at the P64 or P80 closely. The Acaia Orbit is interesting to me but reviews mention a number of varying quirks.

I have a Fellow Ode gen 2 that I currently use for filter, aero press, and cold brew. I’d like the single dose grinder I buy to replace it (if it can grind coarse enough for cold brew). Also, the few times I have ground filter using the Sense I have felt like it wasn’t able to grind coarse enough and I ended up with a large amount of chaff and fines.

tl:dr, Currently own an AllGround Sense for my daily espressos. Looking for a single dose grinder that can pair with it to handle other coffees that I don’t daily like light roasts for pour overs.",0,1762743830.0,espresso,0,0.5,False

I'm an introverted homebody with extroverted skills. I have a bachelor's degree and previously worked as a writer and editor. I'm contemplating returning to school to pursue a master's. I'm currently working towards building a soft, kind, balanced, and intentional life. 

I have been told that I'm kind, thoughtful, helpful, and smart. I like to laugh and make others laugh. I feel things deeply. I have chronic depression and ADHD, both of which I am in treatment for. I chafe at my current life, because I think all I have done so far is survive, and I want more than that. 

I am easily distracted by dogs, good coffee, and books. I like exploring where I live, visiting farmers' markets and thrift stores, going on hikes, listening to music, trying to keep my plants alive, and collecting art supplies for numerous unfinished projects. 

I'm looking for someone with whom I feel safe — enough that I can drop my mask and be me: passionate and goofy and nerdy and sometimes sad. All the multitudes within me. I want someone who will sit with me and hold my hand in both the light and the dark. 

I want to do the same with you — be your best friend, be a part of your village, be your hype-woman. Grow with you, explore life with you, badly serenade you with Spice Girls' songs, be a dog parent with you, etc.

Making friends as an adult is already hard, but social anxiety makes it feel impossible. I can’t even order food or coffee by myself. I stutter, forget words, panic, and feel stupid. I try writing things down or rehearsing in my head, but it doesn’t help, I still freeze.
The other day I called my bank, had it all planned, and still panicked. They made me go through extra security questions because I couldn’t speak properly.
It makes me feel inferior, unconfident, and trapped. I am also a very sensitive person, really empathetic and put others needs before mine. 
Yesterday, i went to a dog friendly coffee shop and my coffee arrived cold. Couldn't bring myself to tell the waiter and ended up drinking two or three sips. I am also a people pleaser with people i don't know. I am extremely nice to others but in ways that sometimes hurt me. I moved to a new country it's been three years now and don't have family or close friends here. Just people i met here and there. I live with my husband and our dog, they help me a lot. But i don't have girl best friends. It's so hard to feel overwhelmed like that.

Does anyone else struggle like this? Anything worked for you?
Please don't tell me to join a yoga or martial arts class since it's out of question being this anxious in social situations. Also, please be kind.

1ot2qaz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ot2qaz,Updated: Review / Critique my lighting design,"I appreciated everyone's comments on the original lighting design from my contractor (baseball stadium, swiss cheese, etc! - first image). Very helpful comments.

I researched some and got another opinion from a lighting design speciality (second schematic uploaded) that I am planning on using instead of the contractor's grid. (A1) are the recesseed lights in the schematic.

I have 8ft ceilings except in the living space which is sloped 8ft-14ft.

I'm looking at the ELK11SD-W Eclo Koto™ LED Module, 1150 lm (12.5W), Sunset 1, 2, 60° for all recessed lights (with some more narrow lens over the dining room table and high area of the living room).

We have some pendant lights, sconses, and under-cabinet lights scattered around to give some layered light, but I'm still nervous we will be under-lit. We are trying to avoid floor lamps as we have very young kids that love knocking them over.

Curious if anyone has ideas around lighting the area in front of the couches which will likely be a coffee table eventually, but until then a kids play area. Right now the design has no light there to avoid glare on the TV.

Any general / specific critiques would be very helpful.

Thanks!

He’s in the arts and currently works four days a week at a coffee shop, plus teaches ome day a week and works on his art. I work a full-time corporate 9–5.

The last few years have been rough for both of us. I lost my dad at 23 and my mom at 25. He was supportive but I handled almost everything alone: working full-time, paying rent, groceries, cleaning out their house, etc. His mom is now in late-stage cancer, which has been very hard for him and his siblings.

About a year after my mom died, I told him I was ready for us to take the next step and move in together. At the last minute he backed out because he didn’t want to leave his brother and was worried about “losing creative space” with his roommates, who were all artists. I was hurt but agreed to wait another year.
We eventually did move in together into a one-bedroom and have talked about upgrading to a two-bedroom so we both have work space.

But we’ve been disagreeing on two major things:

1. Holidays and visiting his family
He’s upset that I don’t want to spend both Thanksgiving and Christmas with his family. I told him I’d like to do one holiday with him and spend the other by myself. Holidays were extremely stressful and hostile for me growing up, and I’m still grieving the fact that I’ll never have holidays with my parents again.
He interpreted this as me avoiding his sick mom. I reminded him I’ve told him I’d go see her whenever he plans something, but he says he “can’t plan” because of his schedule. I could probably be more proactive, but ultimately I’m waiting for him to tell me when to go. He suggested Thanksgiving and I agreed.
Long-term, I said it would mean a lot if we could eventually do one holiday just the two of us. He said he’s not willing to do that.

2. Finances and the future
Any time I bring up money, he gets very defensive and sometimes aggressive. He tells me I “don’t have to worry about him,” and I keep telling him that in a long-term relationship, I do. He won’t tell me what he makes or whether he has any savings (I strongly suspect he doesn’t).
I asked what his plan is if he hasn’t made meaningful progress in his art career in 10 years. He got very upset and said that if I don’t fully believe in his Plan A, I’m not supporting him. He refuses to talk about any backup plan.
I said it’s a realistic concern, and he told me I shouldn’t be worried about money “this young.” I told him I disagree and that he should be planning for the future too.

The conversation ended with him accusing me of turning his life problems into problems with him, and calling me egocentric for thinking any of it involves me.

Lately it feels like every serious conversation turns into an argument. Our lease is ending soon, and part of me wonders if that’s a sign. I don’t want to break up, but it feels like we both have major red flags the other person won’t budge on. Genuinely at a loss here.

An Honest Take for Style-Loving Home Cooks,"Let's have a real chat about the Smeg kettle. You've seen it everywhere. It's the undisputed darling of kitchen Instagram, a beacon of retro cool sitting on countertops. It's beautiful, there's no doubt. But when you peel back that gorgeous pastel paint, is it a good kettle? Does it actually do its job well, or are you just paying for a pretty face?

As someone who loves a kitchen that looks as good as it functions, I was right there with you, debating the purchase. So, I did the deep dive, and I'm here to share what I've found.

## The Obvious: Why We All Want One

First, let's just acknowledge the elephant in the room. The main draw of a Smeg kettle is its design.

*   **Aesthetics:** It’s a masterpiece of mid-century modern design. The curves, the chrome accents, the range of colors—it's a piece of functional art. It can single-handedly define the vibe of a kitchen.
*   **Build Quality:** When you pick one up, it feels substantial. This isn't a flimsy piece of plastic. It has a weight and solidity that gives you confidence it's built to last.

For many people, this is enough. And that's completely valid. But let's dig into the performance.

## The Nitty-Gritty: How Does It *Actually* Perform?

This is where things get a little more nuanced. A kettle's job is to boil water, but the details matter.

### Boiling Speed and Noise

Here’s the deal: compared to many high-end, fast-boiling kettles, the Smeg is often on the slower side. It's not glacial, but if you're used to a kettle that superheats water in under a minute, you'll notice the difference.

It can also be a bit noisy. Again, not jet-engine levels, but it has a distinct, louder hum as it gets up to temperature. For some, this is a minor point. For others who make an early-morning cuppa in a quiet house, it's worth knowing.

### The Pour and the Handle

The handle is generally comfortable to hold, but the pour can be a point of contention. The spout isn't designed for precision. If you're a pour-over coffee aficionado who needs a slow, controlled stream, this might not be your kettle. For general use—filling a mug or a pot—it works just fine, but be prepared for a slightly faster, less controlled pour than you'd get from a gooseneck model.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=smeg%20kettle)

### Inside the Kettle: The Heating Element

Smeg uses a concealed heating element at the bottom of the kettle. This is good! It means there are no coils to get gunked up or to make cleaning difficult. The opening is also reasonably wide, making it easy to get a hand or brush inside for cleaning.

## A Few Things I Wish I’d Known Sooner

Whether you buy a Smeg kettle or already own one, keeping it in top shape is key to loving it long-term. Here are a couple of game-changers for any kettle owner.

> My number one frustration with any electric kettle is limescale buildup. It looks gross and can affect the taste of your water. I used to just use vinegar, but I always felt like I could never fully rinse the smell out.

Then I discovered something I wish I’d found years ago: a simple, high-quality powdered citric acid descaler. It’s a food-safe acid that demolishes limescale with zero effort. You just add a spoonful, boil, let it sit, and rinse. The kettle is sparkling clean and there's absolutely no lingering smell or taste. It's a small thing, but it makes maintaining a beautiful appliance like a Smeg so much easier and more effective.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=smeg%20kettle)

Another thought, especially for the tea and coffee obsessives out there: temperature control. A standard kettle just boils everything to 212°F (100°C). But green tea needs cooler water, and some coffees taste better off the boil. This is where a lesser-known hero comes in: the variable temperature electric kettle. While the Smeg is a style icon, a variable temp model is a performance icon. It lets you dial in the exact temperature you need for the perfect brew. If you’re passionate about your daily cup, it's a life-changing upgrade that the Smeg doesn't offer.

## The Final Verdict: So, Is It Worth It?

This all comes down to what you value most in your kitchen.

**The Smeg kettle is absolutely worth it if:**

*   Your top priority is aesthetics and having a statement piece on your counter.
*   You value a solid, sturdy feel and timeless design over cutting-edge performance.
*   You just need a reliable kettle to boil water for tea, instant oatmeal, and other basic tasks, and you're not in a huge hurry.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=smeg%20kettle)

**You might want to reconsider if:**

*   You are a serious tea or coffee brewer who needs temperature precision.
*   You demand the absolute fastest boiling speed possible.
*   You are on a tight budget and prioritize function over form.

At the end of the day, the Smeg kettle excels at being a beautiful, well-built object. It does its job, but it's not the fastest, quietest, or most technically advanced kettle you can buy. It’s a purchase from the heart as much as from the head. And for many of us who spend so much time in our kitchens, that's a perfectly good reason to buy something.

(Vent + desperate plea for help),"Seriously! is it just me or do all these fancy Notion templates, pretty planners and smart task apps feel like they were designed by aliens who've never experienced a single moment of executive dysfunction? I'm so, so frustrated. Every semester I buy into the hype. ""THIS time,"" I tell myself, ""I'll finally be organized! I'll track my assignments, block my time, master my to-do list! And then... it's the same old story. Like, last week I had three readings due, a lab report to start, and a presentation outline. My Notion dashboard was pristine, colourcoded, linked databases, the works. Monday morning, I was jazzed. High energy! ""I'll tackle that complex econ reading first!"" Then 20 minutes in, my brain went, SQUIRREL! Have you checked if that weird bug from your dream last night is real?"" Boom, down the rabbit hole for an hour.

Later, I tried to switch to the lab report, which should have been a breeze, but my brain was already fried from the squirrel research. So I bounced to YouTube for five minutes to reset and suddenly it's 3 AM and I've watched every documentary ever made about deep sea creatures. The econ reading is untouched, the lab report is a distant memory and the presentation outline? What presentation? That template just sat there. Another time, I had a project with multiple stages. Just break it down! they all say. So I did! Ten sub-tasks, each with a deadline. But getting started on even the first, tiny step felt like impossible. I'd stare at research topic A, feel utterly overwhelmed, and then find myself reorganizing random stuff. if there was a clear system that actually understood that feeling of paralysis, maybe I wouldn't have ended up writing a 3000-word essay in 4 hours fuelled by instant coffee and sheer panic. (I got a B+, somehow, don't ask.)

I feel like most procudtivity systems expect a consistent, linear, neurotypical approach to productivity, and my ADHD brain is just a chaotic pinball machine. They become another source of shame and a monument to my failures rather than actual tools. So, for real, what are you guys using that actually works? Like, not just try time blocking! because I've tried. What's the secret sauce for ADHD brains in college? Any specific apps, Notion setups, weird analog methods, anything?

This year, as I will be expected to provide the holiday cocktail for both Thanksgiving and Christmas, I want to bring that joy to my family. However, one of my family members is vegan and I don’t like to leave her out, so I figured I could look into a vegan version of hot hot buttered rum that could satisfy everyone. Luckily, coconut butter exists and is, of course, a no-brainer because the coconut flavor would pair so well with the remainder of my handle of Appleton Estate Signature! So off I go to my local Star Market, but unfortunately all they have is coconut oil so of course I have to take a trip to Whole Foods to get coconut butter. When I get home I do some googling for recipies only to find out that I didn't fucking need coconut butter, I needed coconut oil. Once I got back from Star Market for the second time, for shits and giggles I decided to try both the coconut butter and the coconut oil and see how they worked. The butter seemed to provide better texture and flavor than the oil, but a lot of solids precipitated out and sank to the bottom of my $1.50 Dollar Tree© Irish Coffee Mug (available in a cardboard box on the floor of a store near you!). Well, shit, I'm currently unemployed and I've seen How to Drink's hot buttered rum video, why not try fat washing the rum with coconut oil and making something with that? Well, the result had none of the butteriness of a hot buttered rum, and was more like a coconutty rum hot toddy, so I have not accomplished my mission. I have since made a dairy butter batter just for myself using a recipe posted here from u/Drinks_by_Wild and am currently about 4 hot buttered rums deep.

You know the postcard shots: the Colosseum at sunset, a coin toss in the Trevi Fountain. But the real magic of the Eternal City lies beyond the lens. It's in the scent of espresso wafting from a tiny corner bar, the sound of a vespa buzzing down a cobblestone alley, and the taste of a perfectly caramelized plate of *cacio e pepe*.

This isn't just another list of tourist attractions. This is your guide to the *must-do in Rome* experiences that will turn your trip from a vacation into a memory you'll carry forever. Let's dive in.

## The Icons (Mastered, Not Just Visited)

### 1. Step Back in Time at the Colosseum *The Right Way*
The Colosseum is non-negotiable. But don't just show up and wait in a three-hour line.

*   **The Pro Move:** Book your tickets online *weeks* in advance. Choose a combo ticket that includes the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill.
*   **Insider Tip:** Start at the Palatine Hill first. It opens earlier and is less crowded. You'll get an incredible, elevated view of the Forum below, and then you can walk down through history directly into the Forum before finishing at the Colosseum. This route is chronologically correct and far less chaotic.

### 2. Experience Divine Awe in Vatican City
Visiting the Vatican Museums and St. Peter's Basilica can be overwhelming. The key is strategy.

*   **The Pro Move:** Book a ""skip-the-line"" tour for the early morning. A good guide will navigate the crowds and point out details you'd otherwise miss.
*   **Insider Tip:** After your tour, don't just leave. Go back to St. Peter's Square in the late afternoon when the tour buses have gone. The square is bathed in a golden light, and you can see Michelangelo's *Pietà* inside the Basilica with significantly fewer people. Climbing to the top of the dome is a strenuous but absolutely unforgettable must-do in Rome.

### 3. Make a Wish (and Eat a Gelato) at the Trevi Fountain
Yes, you have to do it. Toss a coin over your shoulder to ensure your return to Rome.

*   **The Pro Move:** Go very early (around 7 AM) or very late (after 10 PM) to see it without the crushing crowds. The early morning light is magical for photos.
*   **Insider Tip:** Don't just get any gelato. Walk a few streets away from the fountain to find an authentic *gelateria*. Look for signs that say *produzione artigianale* (artisanal production) and avoid the places with neon, mounded gelato. A real must-do in Rome is finding the creamiest, most flavorful gelato of your life.

## Wander, Discover, and Immerse

### 4. Get Lost in the Charming Maze of Trastevere
This is the Rome of your dreams. A neighborhood of ivy-clad buildings, winding cobblestone streets, and the best traditional restaurants in the city.

*   **The Pro Move:** Cross the Ponte Sisto at sunset. The sky glows orange over the Tiber River. Then, just wander. Let the labyrinthine streets guide you.
*   **Insider Tip:** This is the best place for your *aperitivo*. Find a bustling bar around 6 PM, order a spritz or a glass of wine, and enjoy the complimentary spread of snacks that comes with it. It’s a classic Roman ritual.

### 5. Find Serenity at the Pantheon
Walking into the Pantheon is a singular experience. The sense of space, history, and engineering genius is palpable. The oculus, the hole in the center of the dome, is a direct connection to the heavens.

*   **The Pro Move:** Entry is now free but requires a reservation. Book it on the official site a few days ahead.
*   **Insider Tip:** Go when it's raining. Standing in the dry center of the Pantheon while rain pours through the oculus is an unforgettable, almost spiritual event.

### 6. Ponder Art at Piazza Navona
Built on the site of an ancient stadium, this Baroque square is a masterpiece of public space. Its centerpiece is Bernini's magnificent Fountain of the Four Rivers.

*   **The Pro Move:** Don't just look at the big fountain. Walk around the square to see the smaller Fountain of the Moor and the Fountain of Neptune.
*   **Insider Tip:** Visit the church of Sant'Agnese in Agone on the western side of the piazza. It's free to enter and offers a stunning view and a moment of quiet away from the crowds.

### 7. Rent a Rowboat in Villa Borghese
Need a break from the intensity of the city? Escape to Rome's largest public park.

*   **The Pro Move:** Rent a rowboat on the small lake in the center of the park. It's cheesy, romantic, and offers a completely different perspective of the city.
*   **Insider Tip:** If you're an art lover, book tickets for the Borghese Gallery *months* in advance. It houses Bernini's breathtaking sculptures and Caravaggio's masterpieces in an intimate, opulent setting.

### 8. Descend into the Capuchin Crypt
For something truly unique and macabre, the Crypt of the Capuchin Friars is a must-do in Rome. The small rooms are decorated with the bones of over 4,000 Capuchin monks.

*   **The Pro Move:** It's located right under the Church of Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini on Via Veneto. It's not for the faint of heart, but it's a powerful and unforgettable reflection on mortality.

### 9. Marvel at the Mouth of Truth (*Bocca della Verità*)
Made famous by the movie *Roman Holiday*, this ancient marble disc is said to bite the hand off any liar who places it in its mouth.

*   **The Pro Move:** It's located in the portico of the Church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin. The line can look long, but it moves quickly. Have your camera ready!
*   **Insider Tip:** While you're there, explore the church itself. It has a beautiful, mosaic-filled interior and is far less crowded than the major basilicas.

## The Foodie Pilgrimage (A True Must-Do in Rome)

### 10. Master the Art of the *Caffè*
Roman coffee is a ritual. Don't order a to-go cup. Stand at the bar with the locals.

*   **The Rules:** An espresso is a *caffè*. A cappuccino is *only* for breakfast (before 11 AM). After that, it's a *caffè macchiato* (espresso with a dollop of foam).
*   **Insider Tip:** Pay first at the cash register (*la cassa*), then take your receipt to the bar (*al bancone*) to order. This is how the locals do it.

### 11. Eat Your Way Through a Roman Food Market
Head to Campo de' Fiori in the morning (it's a packed bar scene at night). While the market is a bit tourist-focused now, it's still a vibrant explosion of color, scent, and energy. For a more local vibe, try Mercato di Testaccio.

*   **The Pro Move:** Go with an empty stomach. Try fresh mozzarella, *supplì* (fried rice balls with mozzarella), and fresh fruit. It's a delicious and authentic experience.

### 12. Devour the Four Holy Dishes of Roman Cuisine
You cannot leave Rome without trying its signature pasta dishes. Find a traditional *trattoria* in Trastevere or Testaccio and order:
*   ***Carbonara***: Egg, Pecorino Romano cheese, guanciale (cured pork jowl), and black pepper. No cream!
*   ***Cacio e Pepe***: ""Cheese and Pepper."" Simple, yet incredibly difficult to perfect.
*   ***Amatriciana***: Tomato, guanciale, Pecorino Romano, and onion.
*   ***Gricia***: The ancestor of Carbonara—guanciale and Pecorino Romano.

### 13. Indulge in *Carciofi alla Romana* (Roman-Style Artichokes)
When in season (spring), artichokes are a local obsession. Try them two ways:
*   ***Alla Giudia***: Deep-fried until crispy and delicious. A Jewish-Roman specialty.
*   ***Alla Romana***: Braised with mint and garlic, incredibly tender and savory.

### 14. Do the *Aperitivo* Like a Roman
As mentioned before, this pre-dinner ritual is a cornerstone of Roman social life. It’s more than just a drink; it’s a light meal and a chance to unwind.

*   **The Pro Move:** Find a busy spot in a neighborhood like Monti or Trastevere between 6 PM and 8 PM. Order a Negroni or a spritz and enjoy the buffet. You’ll often pay one price for the drink and the snacks.

### 15. Hunt for the Best View of the City
Rome is stunning from above. The dome of St. Peter's is one option, but for something different, try these:
*   **Aventine Keyhole:** Peer through the keyhole of the Priory of the Knights of Malta on the Aventine Hill for a perfectly framed view of St. Peter's dome. It's magical and free.
*   **Gianicolo Hill (Janiculum):** Head here at sunset for a panoramic sweep of the entire city. Stay to watch the cannon fire at noon, a daily tradition since 1847.

> **The Golden Rule of Rome:** The best experiences are often the unplanned ones. Give yourself permission to get lost, to follow a tantalizing smell, to sit on a bench and simply watch the world go by. That is the ultimate must-do in Rome. Buon viaggio",1,1762742433.0,GoItaly,0,1.0,False

Morristown?,"Hey there. I'm a single 30 y/o guy, working remotely. I've moved between a few states, currently living near Charlotte NC. A good chunk of my friend group is spread between NYC, Philly, Hoboken, Jersey City -- so I'm interested in making a move back to NJ.

Around that area, I used to live:

* UES in Manhattan - I liked the walkability, but with a small apartment, it felt a bit cramped
* Jersey City - maybe I was living in the wrong area, I didn't like JC at all. I felt it was loud, dirty, congested, and stressful to get in/out of.

I'm looking for:

* a walkable downtown (bars, restaurants, coffee shops, parks)
* not super crowded/dense (not Hoboken or JC)
* people in their 20s/30s, dating scene
* preferably on a NJTransit train line -- reasonably easy access to NYC and Newark Airport, and to a lesser extent Philly
* budget of $3-3.5k for a 1br, may buy a home in a few years
* I have a car, it'd be nice if driving places isn't an absolute nightmare

I'm considering... Morristown, Red Bank, Somerville, Asbury Park, Princeton, Montclair, Hackensack. But really open to anywhere that might be a good fit!

1ot29bz,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1ot29bz/anyone_else_hate_customer_service_practices_lately/,Anyone else hate customer service practices lately?,"This specifically applies to in-cafe orders, not drive through which is a different animal and is actually probably helped by the new ""efficient"" interactions.

Note that I'm not blaming employees, I know the interaction is by design from Starbucks and not the employees fault.

If you think I sound like a Karen hear me out...This is not about entitlement, it's about changing the natural exchange to be awkward, and not predictable, for the sake of efficiency. It seems minor, but the whole thing is awkward from start to finish. Every. Single. Time. While paying $5-$10 for a grande drink, in an unpleasant cafe.

How customer service should work: the interaction starts *when you get to the counter* (or whenever you're in reasonable range to the exchange), and *at that point you* *greet* each other in some way, a smile, hello, how are you etc. *Then* you state your order/they ask what they can get you.

Instead, employees shout hello right when you open the door. Sounds like a fine idea, but I'm not expecting it from that far away, or while they're doing another task and don't even look up at you. You can't even tell who it came from, especially with loud music, and it'd be weird to shout across the store anyways to acknowledge them back. So the whole thing is just awkward and makes me feel impolite. I've also seen some customers complain about hearing the constant ""hellos"" while in the cafe.

Then, since they've already ""acknowledged"" you with that ""hello"" (even if it was *minutes* before), they not only abruptly start the ordering interaction with ""what can I get you?,"" with no greeting/acknowledgment, they ask it when I'm still a good 10 feet away from the counter. It sounds trivial, but I'm just not expecting it or mentally prepared to spout off my order because I'm anticipating exchanging greetings and starting once I get to the counter, rather than from 10 feet away. The same way I've done it for 20-30 years at every establishment. And once again, I don't want to shout, so I don't reply with my order until I reach the counter, which by then the employee has been staring at me and waiting expectantly for several paces, adding to the awkwardness.

This is merely the tipping point for me to stop going, on top of all the other issues of high prices, too much ice, upcharges, employee treatment, bad coffee, going out of their way to make the cafe as uncomfortable as possible to be in. Otherwise I wouldn't even mention this. Over the past 15 years I've gone from hanging out/meeting friends, getting tasty drinks in the cafe at a mildly premium price, to ordering the most basic coffee to stay cheap (which often tastes burnt), and exiting the cafe as soon as possible because it's designed to be unpleasant and keep you moving, or just using the drive through. If the customer service sucks too, it's the final straw.

So is it just me? Or have you noticed this? Any employees want to chime in?",4,1762742115.0,starbucks,1,0.84,False

**Chapter 1**

James had never committed a crime before. He searched the bottom of his backpack until he felt a pair of wire snips. Heart pounding, he put the blades around the thick wire of a chain-link fence, took a deep breath, and squeezed until his hand shook. It snapped so loudly that he jumped back and peaked over a bush to scan the park for witnesses. With no one in sight, he got back to work. 

The sun would rise soon so he quickly made five more cuts in a vertical line and squeezed through the flap. The woods were dark, but James moved down the trail with ease. After passing a paper birch, he slowed his pace to check a thin thread he had stretched across the trail, giving a sigh of relief to see that it was unbroken. He stepped over the thread, rounded a corner, and there it was: a wooden treehouse tucked safely in the branches of a giant maple tree.

James ran up to the tree to give it a hug before stopping himself and settling for a pat on its rough bark. He wasn't sure if it would still be intact after Suncorp, a secretive new company, bought up all the remaining forest outside his small Ohio town and sealed it behind a barbed-wire-topped-fence. It had been a miserable month for him and his friend, Maggie, as they sat on the swings wondering what was happening deep in the woods on the other side. Heavy machinery pounded and strange smells that many described as “violent” would often drift out. He couldn’t wait to tell her that they had a way in and that Operation Surveillance could officially begin.

James walked over to a neighboring tree and pulled a hidden line. A rope ladder unraveled and stopped just before hitting the ground. He climbed the swaying ladder up to the treehouse and poked his head inside. It was intruder-free, so he pulled himself up and lit an oil lamp on the table.

Everything appeared to be as he left it: two of every dish sat neatly in the cabinet, his stack of drawings was still jammed in a cubby, and several playing cards were still strewn about from Maggie throwing her cards up in celebration after a win. Even the *No Trespassing* sign he snatched from a tree before the fence was built was still in the wood stove, ready to be burned.  

James checked his watch and kept moving. A ladder in the corner took him through a hinged opening and onto the roof. He pulled two cameras out of his backpack and screwed them to opposite corners, pointing down at the ground below. He ran the wires back into the house to a tape-covered cookie tin with an antenna sticking out of the top. A flick of a switch turned on a little green light.

“That should do it,” he said with a smile. “We’re watching you now.”

He wished it hadn’t come to cutting fences and setting up cameras, but he couldn’t imagine losing the treehouse forever. He started building it as a place to escape when his dad went missing on an arctic job assignment. Working on it helped keep his mind busy as search parties came back empty-handed. Every detail held a memory; from the window boxes he made at home with his mother to the chimney crafted with his dad’s old coffee cans. With any luck, the network of cameras he was putting up would record Suncorp breaking the law and get them shut down for good.

After one last look around, he blew out the lamp, slung his backpack over his shoulders and closed up the treehouse. James found the faint trail that lead him deeper toward the pounding machines. Ferns brushed against his ankles as he rushed past mature oaks and hickories that towered to the canopy above. The sun began to warm the eastern sky, turning the woods from black to gray. He picked up his pace but skidded to a stop after seeing a large white animal disappear behind a shrub ahead. 

He crouched down and stared into the understory. Eyes wide, James took a few steps closer. The woods were silent aside from Suncorp’s machines, so he gasped when he turned around and saw a barefooted, shirtless boy standing on the trail next to a frost-white coyote. James nearly took off running, but they did not make any moves. James stayed put and studied the wild-looking boy and coyote who both scanned at him with just as much curiosity.

""Hi,"" James eventually said to break the silence.

A hint of a smile pulled at the corner of the boy's lips, but he did not speak.

“Are you with Suncorp?” James asked.

The boy did not like this question and took a step back while the coyote stared at him with piercing blue eyes.  

""Wait! Don’t go!” James pleaded.

The boy paused. A sharp metallic grinding sound reverberated through the trees, causing the boy to wince.  

“I don’t like them either,” James said. “I don’t know what they’re up to, but it can’t be good. I’m going to film them and if they do anything shady, I’ll send it out to every news station in the area.”

The coyote kept its eyes locked on James while the boy looked deep in thought.

“What is that? Over your shoulder,” James asked, pointing to a vine with large black flower buds slung across his chest like a sash. “I’ve never seen any plant like that.""

The boy looked down at his chest and picked one of the bulbs from the vine. He held it between his finger and thumb for James to see. James stepped forward to get a better look, but the boy released the flower from his fingers, letting it fall to the ground.

The flower hit the ground and exploded with a blinding light that left behind a cloud of black smoke. James fell backward onto the ground. He squinted and rubbed away the bright afterimage, only to find that the boy was gone. In a flash, he had vanished into thin air along with the puff of smoke. Feeling uneasy, he turned around and saw the boy standing behind him, coyote at his side.

""What was that!?"" James shouted

The boy smiled.

""Ha ha, very funny,"" James said, blushing. ""Where did you even come from?”

The boy thought for a moment and reached into a pouch that hung at his hip and pulled out a shiny brown seed the size of an acorn. He held the seed in his palm, wrapped his fingers around it, and squeezed until his hand trembled. James watched in amazement as tiny, thread-like roots grew through the cracks of his fingers and dangled below. A green stem shot up between two of his fingers, sprouting leaves and a feathery purple blossom as it grew. The boy opened his hand to expose a bundle of roots sitting on his palm with an exotic-looking flower that bobbed around on its stem. He held it out for James to take.

James hesitated but then carefully took the flower from his hand. The delicate petals spiraled outward form a central hole that seemed to swallow all light. He held it to his nose for a sniff and was immediately transported to a misty swamp below a rocky waterfall. An unusual bird with black and yellow stripes was drinking the nectar of the same type of purple flower he held in his hand. After drinking its fill, the bird flew off to the window of a house built in the canopy of the boggy forest.

""What the—How did--- Is this where you live?"" James asked as the vision faded.

He opened his eyes, expecting to see the boy standing before him, proud and amused, but there was no one there. No poof of smoke, no blinding light. Just James, the flower, and two bouncing ferns. James ran to the ferns, but the boy was long gone. He wondered if he should chase after him but at this point it was fully light out so he had to get back to the fence. ",1,1762741685.0,fantasywriters,0,1.0,False

Then i moved to states and boom i feel like i get along with men here way more. Like I can connect to men here more for some reason. But the problem here is most men are just looking for hookups and are pretty good at being players. Its hard to tell if a guy is genuinely interested. I went on two dates and we'd been talking but when i met the guy i felt he was just pushing to take me to bed. Like there was no mood or vibe and he kissed me out of nowhere. It was my first ever kiss and it was so bland. I felt nothing. I feel bad rhat my first ever kiss had to be that way. I've never experienced a guy do anything sweet and nice for me. That concept is so alien to me. When we went for coffee he insisted on paying even though I wanted to get something to eat with coffee out of politeness I just went with coffee. He then had dinner and I told him I wasn't hungry and ended up just sharing a slice of pizza that he got for himself. Lol. I don't want to be a burden on anyone either but at the same time I crave that someone would be genuine towards me and show the old school kinda love. Like ive had so many talking stages and they fail because either the guy has no goals and wants to obsess over me or either the guy is emotionally unavailable or wants to bang me. There's never that perfect balance. Like I just want someone with goals, who can communicate well with me and we can push each other to do well in life but that seems like too much to ask for. I consider myself a good person who has a kind heart. I would say im fairly decent looking. I don't like playing games and people say you gotta not be available or act a certain way for men to like you and I find it fake. Why not be open about how much you like someone? I feel like I'll die alone. I want love and family but here im at the age of 29 without ever even getting a flower from a guy LMAO",1,1762741555.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

Her first peck. Her first time. Her first everything. But the next morning, he announced his relationship to her stepsister.
""I wanted to be the one to say it. Isabella and I are officially together.""
Lilith's body went still. Her heart stopped.
Her mouth opened, but no sound came out.
Below her, in the open foyer, she saw them.
Daemon. Dressed. Clean-shaven. Steady.
Isabella. Wrapped around his arm like satin ribbon. Smiling like she'd already won.
He didn't glance up the stairs.
He didn't remember.
The same lips that had whispered Lilith's name last night now curled into a smile for her stepsister.
Lilith stepped back, slowly.
One step. Then another.
No one noticed.
No one saw her - not even the man who had been inside her just hours ago. 
Not even the man she gave her firsts to.
____________
 
""Mr. Volkov, welcome back.""
The housekeeper bowed slightly as the tall man entered the Salvatore estate, flanked by two guards and Isabella, whose laugh echoed like it owned the space.
Daemon Volkov didn't laugh.
He never did.
He surveyed the place with sharp, calculating eyes - cold, arctic blue - as if already mapping every exit, every threat. He hadn't set foot here in six years. Not since-
""Mother!"" Isabella chirped, flinging herself into her mother's arms. ""I told you he'd come. He had meetings in London, but I convinced him to visit before flying to Moscow.""
Her mother gushed. Her father - Lance Salvatore - smiled stiffly.
Daemon said nothing.
He took a seat like a king - coat still on, gloves removed with silent efficiency. His presence alone shifted the atmosphere.
And then-
Footsteps.
Soft. Unhurried.
A figure entered the room - curves in silk, a storm of dark curls falling down her back, presence calm but... arresting.
Daemon didn't look up at first. But when he did, something in his gaze froze.
""Ah,"" Lance stood quickly, a flicker of unease flashing across his face. ""This is-""
""Lilith,"" said the girl, offering no handshake.
Daemon's eyes snapped to her.
Lilith.
He hadn't heard that name in years.
Not since-
His jaw tightened.
Isabella let out a nervous laugh. ""Oh, right. You two used to play together when we were kids. Crazy, huh?""
Lilith tilted her head. ""We weren't playing.""
That voice.
He remembered it - quieter, younger, always trailing behind. Always looking up at him like he was something divine.
But this?
This version of her was dangerous. Stunning. Indifferent.
She didn't look like a girl anymore.
""Lilith,"" he repeated slowly. ""You've changed.""
She arched an eyebrow. ""People tend to.""
""I almost didn't recognize you.""
""You didn't,"" she replied coolly. ""It's alright. I wouldn't recognize me either.""
He studied her - the dress, the eyes, the way she stood like she belonged in a painting no one was allowed to touch.
Untouchable. Unbothered. Unapologetic.
""I remember you now,"" he murmured, eyes never leaving her face.
""Do you?"" she asked, voice featherlight.
""Yes."" A pause. ""You used to follow us around.""
Isabella snorted. ""She was obsessed with you.""
Lilith's smile didn't reach her eyes. ""Isn't it funny, what we grow out of?""
The tension thickened.
Lance cleared his throat. ""Lilith, don't be rude-""
""I'm not."" She met Daemon's gaze. ""I'm just... honest now.""
Isabella clung to his arm. ""Anyway, we're engaged. Isn't it perfect?""
Lilith blinked slowly. ""Absolutely poetic.""
Daemon's gaze didn't leave her for a second.
There was something wrong. Off. That quiet girl he remembered - she wasn't there anymore.
And this woman...
This woman didn't flinch under his stare.
She didn't look at him with longing.
She didn't look at him like he mattered.
And for some reason...
That infuriated him.
 
Daemon
""Lilith,"" he murmured again, as if the name would steady something inside him.
It didn't.
She was gone - silk vanishing up the stairs, leaving only silence and the faintest echo of heels on marble. But the weight of her presence remained.
Heavy. Disruptive.
Like a storm pretending to be still air.
Beside him, Isabella talked too loudly. Smiled too widely. Her hand curled around his forearm like a claim. He barely felt it.
""She's always like that now,"" she said, half-laughing. ""Cold. Weird. I think she likes being difficult.""
He didn't answer.
""I told you she changed,"" Isabella went on. ""She thinks being quiet makes her mysterious. Honestly, she's probably just jealous. She was always jealous of me.""
Daemon's jaw ticked once.
""Right,"" he said absently, eyes still on the staircase.
Isabella didn't notice the flatness in his tone. She never did.
He should have been focused on the business dinner he'd flown in for. On the engagement announcement. On the deal he was closing with Lance.
But all he could see were those eyes - that exact blue that once watched him from shadows. Eyes that used to glow with hope.
Now?
Now they were empty.
Dead calm.
She didn't look at him like he was worth remembering.
And that?
That bothered him.
---
Lilith
Her door closed behind her with a soft click.
Silence.
Not peace. Just the kind of quiet that settles over ruins.
Lilith walked across her room with steady, effortless grace, like a woman used to keeping her emotions chained so deep no one could hear them scream.
She peeled the silk dress from her shoulders, not delicately. She wasn't delicate.
She wasn't anything anymore.
She tossed it on the chair, pulled on an old oversized tee, and sat at the edge of the bed - back straight, eyes forward.
Blank.
She didn't cry.
She hadn't cried in years.
Not for Daemon Volkov.
Not for the girl she used to be.
She didn't wear that dress for him. She hadn't even known he'd be in the country until this morning. And even if she had...
It wouldn't have changed a thing.
He meant nothing now.
Nothing.
Just another man in a suit, mistaking silence for weakness. Mistaking her for someone soft.
She rested her elbows on her knees, fingers laced together. Breathing.
Still.
Unmoved.
The girl who once waited for him was dead.
And Lilith didn't mourn her.
 
The dining room gleamed with polished silver, tall candles, and uncomfortable tension.
Lilith walked in without announcement, without performance - wearing a simple black satin dress that clung to her body like it was born there. No jewelry. No effort. Just skin and silk and silence.
She didn't smile. She didn't speak. She took her seat - directly across from Daemon - and poured herself a glass of wine without waiting for anyone to offer.
Daemon's eyes followed every movement.
She didn't spare him a glance.
At the head of the table, Lance stood, lifting his wineglass.
""We wanted to wait until we were all together,"" he began, voice tight with pride, ""to share the good news.""
Lilith didn't blink.
Isabella leaned into Daemon with a bright, too-wide smile. ""We're engaged!""
Gasps. Cheers. Her mother's dramatic flutter of hands.
Lilith raised her glass lazily, not even bothering to fake a smile.
""Cute,"" she muttered.
The table hesitated - unsure whether it was sarcasm or approval.
It was sarcasm.
Daemon's eyes narrowed, studying her like a puzzle with a piece missing.
""You don't seem surprised,"" he said, voice low.
""I'm not.""
""You don't seem happy either.""
Lilith sipped her wine, still not looking at him. ""I'm dressed, aren't I?""
Isabella's smile twitched. ""She's always like this,"" she said through her teeth. ""Ignore her.""
""Ignore me harder,"" Lilith murmured.
Lance shot her a look. ""Lilith-""
""Didn't say a word,"" she cut in, her voice cool as the silverware.
Daemon leaned back in his chair, eyes fixed on her like a trigger waiting to be pulled. ""You used to have more to say.""
Lilith finally looked at him - slow, sharp, and dangerous.
""And you used to matter.""
A silence fell like glass shattering.
Daemon's jaw clenched once.
Isabella laughed nervously. ""She's joking-""
""No,"" Lilith said, finishing her wine. ""I'm not.""
She stood up, calm and detached, her chair scraping softly against the floor.
""If the engagement's the main course, I've had my fill.""
And without waiting for permission, she walked out - satin trailing behind her like a warning.
Daemon didn't move.
But his knuckles were white against the glass.
 
But then he didn't think.
He moved.
The moment Lilith left the table, Daemon was on his feet - not for Isabella, not for appearances, not for pride.
For her.
And it wasn't because he loved her.
He was sure he didn't.
Lilith had once been his friend - a quiet shadow behind him, harmless, constant. But now... she was someone else. And it shook him.
He didn't understand how she'd changed so much in six years.
So he followed her.
Down the corridor that used to be warm and golden, full of light and laughter. Once lined with ridiculous childhood portraits and flowers in vases.
Now, it was dark. Silent. Lifeless.
Just like her eyes.
His footsteps were quiet over the marble floor, breath tight in his throat.
She didn't turn.
Didn't slow.
Didn't acknowledge him.
And for reasons he couldn't explain, that wrecked him more than anything.
She wasn't walking away to make him chase her.
She walked because she knew he wouldn't matter enough to stop her.
But still-he followed.
Her bedroom door was nearly closed when he caught it.
He pushed it open.
Stepped inside.
---
She didn't flinch.
Lilith stood at her vanity, slowly removing an earring, back to him. One bare shoulder catching the low light. That black satin dress clung to her like it was painted on - effortless, lethal.
She didn't look at him. Didn't move any faster.
""Let me guess,"" she said flatly. ""You forgot something.""
He said nothing.
Her eyes met his in the mirror. Cold. Unbothered. A face carved from still, expensive marble.
""You walked out,"" he said finally.
""I got bored.""
The words were like a slap dressed in silk.
His chest tightened. ""You're trying to get a reaction.""
She turned to face him, slow and deliberate - not like she was afraid, but like she was bored of the idea of being chased.
""No,"" she said, her voice low. ""If I wanted a reaction, I'd be in your lap. Not your memory.""
His jaw clenched.
""You used to smile when you saw me.""
""You used to deserve it.""
His hands curled into fists at his sides.
""You've changed.""
""Thank God."" Her tone didn't waver. ""Can you imagine if I was still pathetic enough to beg for scraps at your table?""
He took a step forward. ""I didn't know what I was doing.""
""I was eighteen."" Her voice cut clean. ""You knew exactly what you were doing.""
Silence.
She didn't fill it. She let it rot.
Daemon's voice dropped, rough and low. ""You think I don't regret it?""
Lilith let out a soft, breathless laugh - not amused, just done.
""No,"" she said. ""I think you regret being seen. Because now I see you clearly. And I feel absolutely nothing.""
That word.
Nothing.
It gutted him more than hatred ever could.
She walked past him, her shoulder grazing his arm with cruel indifference. That faint, familiar scent on her skin - vanilla and storm - burned through him like poison.
He caught her wrist.
Not hard.
But desperate.
""Why are you like this now?"" he asked.
She looked down at his hand like it was a stain. Then she met his eyes - not with anger, but emptiness.
""I'm like this,"" she whispered, ""because the girl who loved you died six years ago.""
She pulled her wrist free with ease.
""Don't follow me again.""
She opened the door.
But Daemon didn't move.
He couldn't.
Because all he could see now - behind his eyes, behind his ribs - was that night.
 
Six Years Ago
The night was quiet when Daemon left the party.
Not silent - he could still hear laughter echoing from the Salvatore estate next door. Laughter that didn't include him anymore. Laughter that belonged to her.
Isabella.
She had been glowing all night - fluttering around in a soft pink dress, surrounded by friends and gifts and cameras. Every second was about her. Every smile. Every photo. Every candle.
No one mentioned that it was Lilith's birthday too.
No one remembered that the girl who lived under the same roof, who had been born just minutes before Isabella, was now eighteen.
He had forgotten, too.
Until now.
Until he saw her - outside, alone, curled on the back patio of her father's house, knees hugged to her chest, a nearly empty bottle of wine between her bare feet.
Daemon stopped when he saw her, something in him stalling. Breaking.
""Lilith.""
She didn't turn right away.
When she did, her eyes were calm - too calm.
""Hey,"" she said softly.
""You drinking alone?""
""Looks like it.""
He hesitated.
""Come over?"" His voice cracked in that last word, and he cleared it quickly. ""I... I don't want to be alone.""
She blinked. ""Everything okay?""
He shook his head.
And she nodded once - stood - and followed him.
---
Daemon's place was dim, shadowed in moonlight and silence. Familiar to her. Foreign now.
He poured whiskey for both of them.
They sat on the couch without speaking.
""She pecked someone else,"" he muttered eventually. ""At her party.""
Lilith raised an eyebrow. ""Isabella?""
He nodded. ""Said it was a dare. But it didn't look like a dare.""
She didn't say I told you so. Didn't smirk.
She just sipped her drink and let the quiet sit with them.
Daemon glanced at her. ""Why weren't you at the party?""
She gave a soft laugh - one that didn't reach her eyes. ""Because it wasn't mine.""
He froze.
Lilith tilted her head, voice light, detached. ""You know we share a birthday, right?""
Guilt hit him like a slap.
""I'm sorry. I didn't-""
""It's fine."" She sipped again. ""Doesn't really count when no one notices you're missing.""
He stared at her now - really stared. The t-shirt clinging to her frame was old, probably borrowed from her father's closet. Her curls were half-pulled back, still a little damp. No makeup. No effort.
And yet she looked...
Undeniably beautiful.
Real. Unreachable.
""You look different,"" he murmured.
She shrugged. ""I'm older.""
""You're eighteen,"" he repeated, like the word mattered more now.
She nodded, quiet. ""Today.""
He rubbed his face. ""God.""
She laughed softly. ""That's twice now.""
Daemon stood up, walked to the bar. ""You spilled a little,"" he said over his shoulder, noticing the wine stain on her shirt.
""Of course I did."" She sighed, rising. ""Do you mind if I-?""
""Go grab something from my room,"" he cut in gently. ""Top drawer. T-shirt or whatever.""
She blinked, surprised.
He held her gaze. ""Please. Just... make yourself comfortable.""
---
She returned ten minutes later.
Barefoot.
Fresh-faced.
Wearing his black t-shirt - long enough to brush her thighs, fitted enough to make him forget how to breathe.
She sat beside him again like nothing had changed.
But everything had.
""You know,"" she whispered, ""I used to think you were untouchable.""
He turned to her, stunned.
""That day we met,"" she went on. ""My mom had just died. I was eight. I was in the backyard crying over Sunny - that stupid yellow bear my nana made by accident.""
""I remember,"" he said quietly. ""You wouldn't let go of it.""
""You gave me candy,"" she said. ""You made me laugh. And from that moment, I was yours.""
Daemon's throat tightened.
""For a long time,"" she continued, voice barely a breath, ""I thought... maybe if I stayed close, long enough, you'd see me. Really see me.""
He stared at her.
""You were my first friend. My first everything.""
She met his eyes. Steady. Bare.
""My first love.""
Daemon didn't move.
""I know you loved her,"" Lilith said. ""I know I wasn't easy to love. I was loud. Rough. Not... soft like her.""
""Lilith-"" His voice broke.
But she didn't let him speak.
""I'm not saying this to guilt you. I'm saying it because tonight? I don't want to lie anymore.""
And then she whispered, ""I don't want to be alone.""
He moved before he thought.
His hand reached out, curling around her wrist, then her waist, pulling her in like a wave he didn't know he was drowning in.
Their lips met - tentative at first. Searching.
Then all at once.
She gasped when he lifted her into his lap, her legs wrapping around him like instinct. He pecked her deeper, fingers tangled in her hair, pressing her closer like he was trying to remember what she felt like before he lost her completely.
""Tell me to stop,"" he whispered against her lips.
She shook her head. ""Don't.""
He stood, carrying her with him, eyes locked on hers. He walked them to the bedroom, laid her down with aching care - as if the weight of what they were doing hadn't truly hit him until her back touched the sheets.
""You've done this before?"" he asked, voice thick.
She blinked once. Then, quietly: ""No.""
He froze.
His jaw clenched.
She reached up, brushing a thumb across his cheek. ""I want it to be you.""
A sound escaped him - soft, broken. Reverent.
When he pecked her again, it wasn't hungry. It was everything.
He touched her like she'd never been touched before.
Because she hadn't.
She arched under him, breath catching as his mouth explored her skin like it was sacred. She trembled when he entered her, and he slowed - whispered her name like a promise.
He held her hand.
He held all of her.
And when she cried - just a little, just once - he pecked her tears away like it would somehow make this right.
But it wouldn't.
Because in the morning, she would learn the truth.
And so would he.
 
Lilith
Six Years Ago
She woke to stillness.
A golden beam of morning light stretched across her thigh, warm and slow. The scent of clean sheets and something deeper - wood, cologne, him - clung to the air like the ghost of last night.
She blinked against the light.
The room was unfamiliar. Sleek. Masculine. Quiet.
His bedroom.
For a moment, she didn't move.
She lay still in his bed, wearing nothing but his black t-shirt, and listened to the soft hush of silence, the thud of her own pulse. Her muscles ached - not painfully, just... differently. Her thighs. Her hips. Her ribs.
She turned her head.
The space beside her was empty. Still warm.
Daemon had been there. Not long ago.
And now he was gone.
She smiled, a small, shaky thing.
Maybe he was downstairs. Making coffee.
Maybe he'd left to grab something and would be back soon.
Her heart fluttered, soft and foolish, still na茂ve enough to believe that last night meant something.
She stretched once and sat up - and froze.
There it was.
A faint bloom of red on the sheets beneath her.
Her heart skipped.
Not from shame. From something older. Deeper.
She hadn't expected to bleed. She hadn't expected... this.
Her first.
She clutched the edge of the sheet, staring at it.
Her first peck.
Her first time.
Her first everything.
She swallowed hard, chest tight, and quietly pulled the sheets off the bed. She folded them gently, carefully - like someone trying to erase evidence of a crime.
She didn't want him to see the blood.
She didn't want him to know just how much it had meant to her.
---
Lilith found the linen closet in the hallway - of course she knew where it was; she used to run through this house like it belonged to her too. Back when they were kids. Back when he saw her as something soft. Something safe.
She replaced the sheets, smoothed them out, tucked the corners in tight.
Then, barefoot and hopeful, she padded down the stairs.
That's when she heard it.
Voices.
Laughter.
Not casual - celebratory.
Her father's voice, bright and formal. ""We're thrilled. Truly. It's been a long time coming.""
Her brows pulled together.
She moved closer to the railing at the top of the stairs.
Then she heard Daemon's voice.
""I wanted to be the one to say it. Isabella and I are officially together. And she'll be joining me in England next week - just a few meetings, nothing dramatic.""
Lilith's body went still.
Her heart stopped.
Her mouth opened, but no sound came out.
Below her, in the open foyer, she saw them.
Daemon.
Dressed. Clean-shaven. Steady.
Isabella.
Wrapped around his arm like satin ribbon. Smiling like she'd already won.
He didn't look conflicted.
He didn't glance up the stairs.
He didn't remember.
The same lips that had whispered Lilith's name last night now curled into a smile for her stepsister.
Lilith stepped back, slowly.
One step. Then another.
The floor didn't creak.
No one noticed.
No one saw her - not even the man who had been inside her just hours ago.
Not even the man she gave her firsts to.
She turned.
Walked back down the hall.
Slipped out the back door of his house like a secret.
She didn't cry.
She didn't collapse.
She just walked.
Across the narrow patch of grass separating his house from hers. Back through her back door. Up the stairs.
Into the bathroom.
She stood under scalding water, fully clothed, until she couldn't feel her fingers anymore.
---
She never said a word.
Not about the blood.
Not about the sheets.
Not about how she'd thought - even just for a moment - that maybe she mattered.
Because that morning proved what the last six years had been trying to teach her:
She was forgettable.
She was a mistake.
She was nothing.
And the girl who loved Daemon Volkov?

I had given a year’s notice to my husband of 20 years that I wanted a party, trip, or something big for my birthday. We do not have financial issues. Two weeks before my birthday we got in a fight and he said he was going to cancel my birthday trip. Come to find out he didn’t have a trip planned at all, he had only googled flights. 
The weekend before my birthday is when we typically celebrate and I was getting ready for my birthday dinner when I saw him laying on the couch and he asked where I was going. I then realized he had no reservations or anything planned. My actual birthday was on Tuesday in the morning of he bought me flowers, coffee and a Groupon. Yes, a Groupon. I was devastated. He defends his actions and said he had the whole day planned including lunch with my kids that day, but I had already scheduled my own massage and he said he wanted going to take me out to dinner solo but that’s not how I wanted to celebrate. I called my friends and they took me out for a drinks instead. 
I told him that buying a Groupon for your wife of 20 years on her 40th birthday is insulting and I want a divorce. With tears in his eyes, he said, let me make it up to you. A week later was our anniversary. No card, no dinner, no gift.  
It’s been four months and I bring it up often. I cry and tell him it’s really important that he makes this up. It’s not so much about the gift but about the effort. He won’t even take me on an actual date night. I’ve completely pulled back from the marriage and I’m putting zero effort in but I’m ready to divorce after 20 years of marriage over this. Is it petty to divorce him over this? AITAH",64,1762741302.0,AITAH,76,0.86,False

The Next Morning:

Anthony hurried along the hall and knocked on the trio's door. Fiona opened it and let him in. He quickly flipped to the apocalyptic scene he had drawn the night before. He hadn't slept sense, the caffeine coursing through his veins making him a little bit jittery. He pushed it toward the witch who had opened the door.

“Do you recognize any of these symbols?” he asked, pointing to one of the strange designs that was formed by the outer edges of a flame, then another on the chest of a twisted, demonic soldier figure.

“It might take me some time. Can I copy them, or take a picture?” she countered.

He nodded.

“Take all the pictures you need. Share them around.” he replied.

After she had done just that, he took his leave of their room and returned to the lobby, claiming another cup of the hot instant coffee, along with a muffin, in order to avoid getting sick. He was standing outside of the elevator, waiting to ride back up to his room but saw Shayla when the doors rolled open. She smiled and waved, then removed the headphone from one of her ears.

“Good morning.” she said softly, still clearly just waking up.

He pivoted and walked alongside her back to the table where the coffee machines were sitting.

“We need to go back to that house.” he whispered.

Shayla raised one well manicured eyebrow at him.

“You want to do another séance?” she giggled.

“Not exactly. I want to try something that I haven't done in years, and I need your help.” he told her, his voice low and serious.

“What are you thinking?” she prodded.

“I'm going to try to channel that spirit we talked to.” he admitted.

“You do know that is a supremely bad idea, don't you?” the woman's voice raised to an almost normal volume, and they both glanced around afterward, but there was no one else there.

He nodded and let out a quiet sigh.

“That's why I need you there, in case they don't want to leave, and I can't force them out myself.”

The words were heavy in her ears, and her mind. She dumped a bit of creamer into her coffee and stirred it with one of the small plastic sticks, then raised it to her lips to take a long sip. They started back toward the elevator.

“I will help you, if you need it. Is there anything else?” she asked. She hadn't read his mind, but it was clear something more was on the young man's mind.

“I saw something last night. I showed the others. I was waiting for you to wake up.” he confessed again.

Shayla waited until they got back to her room. Anthony didn't waste any time opening his sketch book. As soon as she laid eyes on the picture the young man had drawn, a sense of ice cold dread running through her, her body shivering a bit in response. It looked like the end of the world, and the twisted, evil faces that stared up at her radiating malice and ill intent. It felt like the end of the world. Shayla closed the sketchbook and rubbed her eyes.

“We have to stop it.” she mused, almost to herself.

He nodded, and they both re-filled their coffee cups and walked to the elevators together.

On The Outskirts Of Portland:

Falielle opened the borrowed eyes. Sleep was one thing he still wasn't used to. Unlike angels, when they were on Earth, demons were bound by the rules of the human body. At least his strength and the other abilities that his kind possessed were still functional. He glanced around the small motel room, frustrated that he had to keep a low profile, but it was of the utmost importance that he not draw the attention of either the hierarchy of either Heaven or Hell until it was too late to be stopped. The two witches who had summoned him were gone, another target in their sights.

The second phase of their plan was ready to begin and then they would move down south, toward the valley, and from there, to Crater Lake. That was where he would enact the Rite of Demoloton, and call the demon who had created him to the Earth. They would be unstoppable. He stared into the mirror seeing his true face beneath the flesh, bestial and hideous. His mind returned to the present, to the matter at hand. He had to focus. They would be back to collect him soon, and then he would raise his second in command.

The demon stepped back and collected the small bag of sharp implements he had assembled and started to pace, itching to feel one of the blades sinking into yielding flesh, to hear the whimpers of fear and cries of pain before eventually snuffing out the light in his victim's eyes. The thought of it was almost enough to send a shiver along his spine. His eyes flashed red as he grew impatient and the temperature around him began to rise. By the time the women pulled into the lot he was literally steaming when he stepped through the door.

He ducked into the back seat of the sedan.

“Where's Brooke?” the demon growled.

“She's keeping our guest comfortable.” Hunter replied with a giggle.

They drove on, and the creature in the human skin leaned back in the seat. Thankfully, the abandoned building where they had taken the woman wasn't too far away. He stepped out into the chill air and inhaled deeply. The night air was crisp and cool as it flowed down into the lungs of the body as he retrieved the kit of torture tools. He carried that with him as he approached the building. He opened the door then stepped aside, allowing the human woman to enter before he stepped through and secured the door behind them.

They entered the basement of the former clothing store and found their victim there, wide eyed and biting at the cloth gag in her mouth. Falielle grinned.

“Hello, lovely.” he practically purred.

The temperature in the room rose, and his smile made even those who had called him nervous.

“You two know what to do while I work, so get to it.” he said simply.

The two witches nodded and bean drawing the symbols and the circle on the floor around the chair while the demon moved to loosen the gag clenched between the abductees teeth. She screamed as soon as she was able. That only made him laugh.

“Scream all you like, my dear.” he sneered.

A moment later, the first cuts were made, and cries were heard. Her blood and tears were collected in separate vessels.

At The Scene Of The Crime:

Anthony sipped the tea from the lid of the thermos, the chamomile helping soothe his nerves as the trio of NeoPagans began to draw their own circle, the two girls quietly chanting in Gaelic as one walked clockwise, and the other walked the opposite direction, each tracing the lines with a piece of salt coated chalk. Cameron was busy preparing the other ritual items they would need. Shayla was pacing one room over, keeping her guard up for the moment. She would need to focus if it came down to her helping push an unwilling spirit from another human's body.

The two psychics didn't have to be nervous for long, because the magic users were ready pretty quickly. Anthony closed his eyes and began to relax as Cameron approached him, drawing a symbol on his forehead with the ash of a piece of Palo Santo. Almost immediately he felt something. A surge or a jolt between his ears. A moment later he could see things he couldn't before. The phantom image of furniture and people in the room, like a double-exposed photograph. He blinked hard, and then the images began to move.

The trio began to chant again. A moment later the room grew cold and Anthony saw a swirling, dark cloud of energy gathering near the perimeter of the circle. Shayla stood in the doorway, leaning against it, clearly unaware of what was happening. That figure became a fully realized apparition of the missing person they had been sent to find. The ghost seemed just as confused as he was when they made eye contact.

“If you can't speak to me, then I invite you to inhabit me.” he said, using exactly the words they had decided on earlier that morning.

The dead man stepped toward him and reached out, and the moment his finger made contact with the artist's forehead, everything went dark for a second. The other four saw his eyes roll back and body go rigid and then limp a few moments later. He issued a distressing, creaky, rattling cough from his chest. His eyes blinked and then focused, moving around the room. They were glassy and unfocused. The voice that left his lips was not his own.

“What is going on?” the spirit of the vagrant asked.

Fiona stepped forward.

“I'm sorry, but we don't have time to give you answers. We need you to tell us what happened to you. Quickly.” she said.

“I was murdered by two women, and then I watched my body walk out of this place without me.” he summarized as succinctly as he could.

“Who killed you?” she followed up.

“Two women. They used some sort of weird knife.” the ghost replied.

There was a moment of panic as Anthony's body went stiff and began to contort against the chair. In that moment, the artist could see the room, and the people in it. His view faded to black again as his body settled.

“Do you know their names?” the girl asked, her eyes betraying a sense of urgency that didn't show in her face or come through in her voice.

“Hunter and Brooke. Black Sedan. O, H, 54.” the spirit said and then the convulsing began again.

The coughing followed, and Anthony's body fell to the floor. The spirit couldn't remain inside the prison of flesh, growing weaker by the moment. He faded into nothing once again, and the artist resumed control of his body. A collective sigh of relief was let out by the others. He felt like he had run a marathon, but otherwise, seemed to be fine.

“Did we get anything useful?” he groaned quietly.

“A pair of names and a partial plate.” Cameron said, smiling as he helped him up. The two girls powered down the protective circle.

They swept and mopped up the evidence of their little ritual before leaving.

A Thousand Miles Away:

Edward was getting anxious. The team had informed him of their plan of course, but the risk was high that something was going to go wrong. He forced his mind off of that track, and back to his current task, placing a box of ritual supplies next to his desk. He wanted to be prepared in case they had to perform an emergency exorcim, in which case he would need help of his associate on the top floor. He really hoped that it wouldn't come to that. He took a long drink from the bottle of water sitting atop his desk and settled back into the chair.

It wasn't much longer before the phone on his desk rang. He picked it up.

“Please tell me you have something we can use.” he said, certain he knew who was on the other end of the phone.

“We have two first names and a partial license plate. They drive a black sedan.” Fiona's voice informed him.

“Give me that info and I will get it to the appropriate nerds and have the registration for you by the end of the day.” Edward said, reaching to pick up a pen.

She did, and assured him that the spirit was too weak to give them any trouble. His spirits were much higher as they hung up and he immediately dialed the number of the Field Office he had been put in contact with. It took a few minutes before he was connected to the right person. He gave the woman the numbers and letters that he had received.

“I will see what I can do with this.” she said after a moment.

“The car may be registered to a Brooke or a Hunter. I have no last name. It will be a dark colored sedan, if that helps.” the man in the suit added.

“Every detail helps. I will call you when I have something sir.” the woman told him, and then the line went dead in his ear.

He stood up and moved to the room where the coffee pot sat on its warming plate, pouring a mug of the warm, bitter bean water. He sipped at that as he carried it back to the office he had been occupying. There wasn't much that he could do, so he sipped the beverage and checked his private e-mail, responding to a few messages. Once that was done, he took the stairs down to the lobby and around the corner to the diner he had visited before. He was settling into a routine and even starting to like his new position.

“You're becoming quite the regular.” his hostess said playfully as she led him to the corner booth that he had sat in the day before.

He didn't answer except for a polite smile as he settled onto the padded bench and scooted toward the wall. He scanned the menu until he made his decision and closed the laminated folder. When the server approached, he placed his order and they exchanged a glass of cola for the menu. He glanced around the place at the families and other patrons in the place. He reached down and idly rubbed at his shin, a dull ache radiating up toward his hip. It was going to rain again. He let out a quiet sigh and leaned back in his seat.

Edward sipped his drink, and was just scooting out to make for the restroom when the phone in his pocket rang

In Portland:

Trivel sighed. Observation was boring, sitting in one spot, in the cramped confines of a vehicle he barely understood, and even worse, his essence crammed into the prison of slowly rotting meat. Then there was the passenger. An uncooperative co-pilot if there ever was one. To make matters worse, he was conscious in that moment, a tiny, screaming voice in the Angel's head.

“Shut up.” he sneered, and a moment later, he had subdued the human's mind, trapping him in a dream-like world where everything seemed normal.

The man with the cane exited the diner, and Trivel made a note, pulling away from the curb.",1,1762741071.0,u_OutlawWriter,0,1.0,False

It gets dark as early as 4:45 p.m. and because of that the day feels over before it has even begun. But, the snow did help my mood a little, if not my productivity. Yes, you heard right. Snow in early November, just as the forecast predicted and more. The ground was already white by the time I woke up and it remains white tonight; it hasn't stopped all day. My first thought this morning was that is was a wonderful backdrop for writing so guess what I didn't do today. I did not write at all. Not last night or today. Last night, I needed to help mother move some furniture around and today was laundry day. Mother was busy making a wonderful lasagna for dinner so I didn't feel right retreating upstairs to my cave to write when the laundry needed to be done.

One small sliver of bad news on account of the snow. Father lost the keys to the jeep while out on a walk. I had just sown a hole in his coat pocket a few days ago and when he came home I checks it only to find it was still holding firm. My best guess is it fell out while it was removing his hands from his pocket. He plans to go back to look for it tomorrow. Maybe I'll go with him so he has some fresh eyes. I also some some worries about how many trees and plants still have leaves with all this snow. Hopefully it isn't going to last and the plants will be able to go fully dormant before winter really sets in.

This time, actually will write tonight. At least a little. The laundry is done and so is dinner. The night is chilly but guess what? Father bought me a new heater. I mentioned in passing that mine broke and he very kindly bought me a new one that arrived today. I set it up and it is even nicer than my old one. With it and a warm cup of coffee, I'll be perfectly toasty and ready to write.

Background:

I’m in a humanities PhD program, and I’m not sure what my friendships are supposed to look like with people in my program and my field.

I feel like I’m nailing my mentor and supervisor relationships. In my normal life, I have amazing neighbor/context-based friends as well as lifelong friends. 

The problem is that I feel like I’m not connecting with people in my program enough. But maybe I am, and this kind of academic friendship isn’t as close as I imagined?

I get coffee or dinner with people in my program. I stop to chat with them in the hallways when I see them. I’ve been to a couple small dinner parties. We drive to conferences together etc. But I also know of some parties I haven’t been invited to. I’m one of the oldest in my cohort and have a toddler at home, so maybe I’m just weird and old to them.

Questions:

Especially if you’re farther along in your academia journey, what are your academic friendships like? How intimate/close are you with your friends in academia? And how did you get past the we’re-basically-just-coworkers level?",5,1762740997.0,AskAcademia,4,0.86,False

My mom divorced my dad when I was 12. The reason? ""Life just drove us apart."" No fights, no big discussions, just... poof. Dad moved out, seemed weirdly okay with it, and in swooped Aunt Nancy (not my actual aunt, just my mom's ""best friend"" since forever).

Nancy was ALWAYS at our house. Wine nights every Friday turned into wine nights every other day. She'd show up with groceries, fix our leaky faucet, build my sister's dresser from IKEA, take mom to every single doctor's appointment. Then one day she just... never left? Literally moved in 6 months after the divorce because ""us hags need to stick together and thrive!""

Growing up I thought it was so cool having two moms basically. They'd call each other ""soulmate"" as like, a cute nickname? They have matching ""soulmate"" necklaces they got on a trip to Vermont (yes, VERMONT). They share a Pinterest board called ""our dream kitchen renovation."" They slow dance to Fleetwood Mac in said kitchen while cooking dinner. They have ONE shared Netflix account named ""LindaNancy.""

Nancy takes my mom coffee in bed every morning. My mom leaves little notes in Nancy's lunch bag. They go on ""gal pal vacations"" to Provincetown every summer. They adopted a rescue dog together and hyphenated its last name. THEY HYPHENATED THE DOG'S NAME.

Last week my girlfriend was looking at the photo I've attached here and she goes ""your moms are so brave for dating so openly in their time"" and I was like ""haha yeah my mom and her best— wait. Wait. WAIT.""

I called my sister, and she just laughed at me for 5 straight minutes. Apparently everyone knows? My dad knows? My grandma sends them ONE anniversary card every year addressed to both of them??

Anyway I'm having dinner at their house tonight and honestly? Seeing that photo, seeing how they look at each other after 14 years of being ""roommates""... I've never seen my mom this happy. Ever. Im so happy for them, and feeling so dumb lol",25,1762740478.0,gay,9,1.0,False

Just as we wanted, it was supposed to be just a casual hookup. But of course, I liked him, I liked him physically, I was attracted to him, which is why I hooked up with him. He told me he felt the same. After that, I decided to delete my G app and be exclusive with him for safety reasons.

On our second meet, I slept over at his apartment. We talked about a lot of things, life, love, career, etc. It was a very wholesome experience and felt like it wasn’t just a hookup. We cuddled all night, and when we woke up, I went straight to the shower. After I got out, food and coffee were ready, and he even booked and paid for my ride to work. At that moment, I got confused. Was that just basic human decency, and I was just overthinking it?

As weeks went by, our communication didn’t stop. We would always talk about random things, funny memes, dirty jokes, my love life (he would even encourage and help me look for a boyfriend), and our work.

Then, on our third meet, I slept over at his apartment again. The same thing happened, fun and wholesome conversations, cuddling all night, eating dinner together. He was really accommodating. We would meet about once a month because his boyfriend stays at his apartment, so we only meet when we get the chance. There were also times I couldn’t go because of schedule conflicts.

Once, we were talking about hookups, and he told me he felt guilty because I was being exclusive with him, and he couldn’t do the same. He also told me that sleepovers weren’t allowed based on the rules he and his boyfriend made for their open relationship. He said it was supposed to be just a hookup, but we kept in touch and would still meet whenever we could.

I need some advice for this situation. It’s hard to detach. It’s hard to like someone who can’t like me back. I’m stuck.",1,1762740369.0,nonmonogamy,1,1.0,False
1ot1nj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Home/comments/1ot1nj4/cluster_of_flies_next_to_windowfly_screen_for_2/,"Cluster of flies next to window/fly screen - for 2 days now, can't find the source! :(","Hey guys,

I live in Sydney in a small, 2 bedder unit and last 2 days, woke up to a cluster of flies near the fly screen balcony, ironically, the flies are on the wrong side of the fly screen lol.

Anyways, I live alone and I can't find the source.

This is what I have done

1. Close all doors to isolate which room it may come from and see the next day
   1. I have isolated it's coming from the loungroom and kitchen (open space area) as no flies were in the bedrooms, bathroom, closet, laundry room.
   2. Woke up to flies on the fly screen
2. I don't have any fruit/veg out, all kept in the fridge
3. I have moved the dishwasher, fridge, couch and entertainment unit and did a deep clean underneath
4. I do no leave the rubbish out, for safe measure I have taken all the garbage out and looked in the garbage but no flies
5. Checked the bathroom drains - nothing
6. Checked sink drain - nothing
7. Checked inside and underneath the couch - nothing
8. Checked in and around the coffee table - nothing
9. Checked ontop of the fridge - nothing

I have checked other forums and don't think I have anything rotting or dead like a mouse or something..

These are the flies, it's doing my head in. Every time I go out to the lounge from my bedroom (WFH), there's at least 2-4 new flies hanging on the balcony fly screen.... I open the fly screen and they fly out.

But in the last 3 hours, I have left the fly screen open so they can just fly out naturally. Usually 1 or 2 just stick by the window.

Any insight?

##🚨 Warnings from the Future

Be wary, travelers! In Twin Peaks, even the numbers can be...slippery. Some sources label the Pilot as Episode 0, while others count it as Episode 1. To stay on track, follow the episode titles, not just the numbers. Write it in your diary.

If you've just arrived in Twin Peaks, you should know the original U.S. pilot (1 hour 34 minutes) is the true beginning. It opens the door slowly, letting the fog roll in and the mysteries breathe. The so-called ""International Release"" (1 hour 52 minutes) tacks on an ending that concludes the case far too soon, unraveling secrets meant to linger in shadow.

Does our thinking affect what goes on outside us, and what goes on inside us? I think it does. Where does creamed corn figure into the workings of the universe? What really is creamed corn?

Have you ever seen something startling that others cannot see? Why are some things kept from our vision? Is life a puzzle?

>One more thing. I grew up in the woods. I understand many things because of the woods. Trees standing together, growing alongside one another, providing so much. I chew pitch gum. On the outside -- let's say, of the Ponderosa pine -- sometimes pitch oozes out. Runny pitch is no good to chew. Hard, brittle pitch is no good. But in between these exists a firm, slightly crusted pitch with such a flavor. This is the pitch I chew.

Found out about this practice in July and have had several streaks of 25-30 days and all of them felt amazing. However I’m feeling really depressed and unhappy with a lot of things now. I think back to about 2 years ago when I was constantly releasing and how hard I tried to achieve my goals. How ambitious I used to be. It was so unique and inspiring to my soul. However now I do try in my schooling and at work and with my relationships, almost every aspect but still to this day I have nothing to show for it and while on retention.

At the beginning of this streak it felt like everything was coming together, like I could finally breathe and be free from everything that has been holding me back. However I’m so depressed and lazy, I almost don’t feel like I’m myself at all. Just a dude walking around not knowing what the hell he is doing. 

It’s weird because when I was in a constantly released state I felt so emotionless and I couldn’t feel sad. It was hard to feel much of anything. However now I just feel everything without the ability to full express or feel the full weight of that emotion. Almost like it’s just haunting me.

I’m sober from everything… I don’t take meds, I don’t smoke, I don’t drink since like 2 weeks ago, I workout regularly, I don’t drink coffee, I might be one of the most health conscious 20 year olds out there… like no joke. However I just don’t know what the hell to do… I pray to God but it’s almost like I feel worse afterwards because I lose hope when things continue this way. 

Edit: been free from alcohol 2 weeks. I have never regularly drank or smoked. I haven’t smoked weed in 6 months. I haven’t had caffeine in almost 3 months 

Can someone please give me some insight. I’m not trying to look for sympathy I’m literally just describing my thought process so yall can understand what I’m going through. I’ve seen so many people talk about the benefits of long term, so trust me, I’m in it for the long term.

And that jinx gets like worse each time.

1 First was a grocery cashier in high school, where I randomly almost fainted. Never figured out why, my Mom just assumed I needed more red meat, and the rest of my work there was fine.
2 Second was a fancy restaurant in college I worked at shortly, and though I didn't get physically ill, it was so demanding that I had nightmares for months from working there.
3 Third was the job I finally got after thinking that the pandemic was over, and literally a week before it I got COVID for the first time. It was awful anyway, prevented anyone from ever having a life, and I quit after a week.
4 Fourth was at a coffee shop, much more low-key and only part time, and I was happy. But, my body wasn't quite right after having COVID, and lo and behold I developed Long COVID! I got POTS and dysautonomia!

Chronic illness has been devastating. It's been about 3 years (?) and I haven't had any serious job since the coffee shop, as my symptoms get in the way of my everyday life, as well as sometimes flare and debilitate me for varying lengths of time (hours to even days).

Currently, I help out at my church for a few hours once a week, and I get some money from it, but I also felt awful starting that because it was only meant to be temporary relief for the person who did it before, but then she died and I still almost feel like it was somehow my fault, my jinx or something.

The economy and job market have been so awful and I was so excited to hear back from literally anyone after nothing for months. The only issue is that my interview is for a particularly stressful position. My parents have even tried talking me out of it, concerned that it'll have an incredibly negative impact on my mental health, potentially even affecting my physical health due to my chronic illness. And I don't necessarily disagree, but I really need to make money. 

I want to do the interview at least for practice, but I'm still terrified. I keep telling myself it's only an interview, not actual work, but I'm still terrified. I'm scared of my ""jinx"", I'm scared of any potential negative health things happening. I wish I knew how to at least manage my chronic illness better. I sometimes wonder if I have an actual curse on me and I need to find a witch or someone to lift it.

I feel silly even typing this. Like I know I don't have good mental health, but I feel somewhat justified in my fear.",1,1762740019.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1ot1bm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/KamenRider/comments/1ot1bm6/finished_my_first_kamen_rider_series_and_my/,"Finished my first Kamen Rider series, and my thoughts (Kuuga) (spoilers)","Ok I watched all 49 episodes... I don't get the appeal. I'm pretty disappointed at how anti-climatic this series was. I was really wanting to like this series so please understand before flaming me. Also please understand this is my opinion and by no means am I the end all be all to a show's critical reception nor the most important voice in a room, you are allowed your own opinion as well. Though that being said I do feel like there's some serious problems with this show.

All that build up for little to no pay off. Yusuke is the same character he was at the beginning that he was at the end. All that happened is that they beat the big bad guy. The bad guy kept saying that ""you'll become like me"" but... that never happened. Yusuke literally tells his friend by the tree, ""Violence shouldn't be the solution to our problems because it creates a cycle of violence "", yet ironically, violence is always the solution in this show and it always solves the problem. The show is hypocritical in its messaging. What negative comes from fighting the big bad guy, and continuing ""the cycle""? Absolutely none. By episode 49, every is smiles and rainbows and everything is perfect.

Every time real conflict comes up it's immediately shut down. Oh, Kuuga blew up a city? We at the police force decided that's bad so we suspended his police bike. Nope. Just kidding, Ichigo reminded me he's the protagonist I guess, here's the bike back! \*thumbs up\*. Yusuke didn't have to sacrifice anything to defeat the final boss. He just did and the plot asspulled the only consequence out at the last second. Actually this show does that all the time. It gives you conflict to keep you engaged, but pulls the rug the second something actually is about to happen. Like there's never any consequences to anything ever.

Oh shoot, the police don't trust this ULF 2 guy, he's right next to the other ULF, clearly he's trouble too and we can't trust him. But they end up trusting him anyway, really too quick in my opinion. A lot of the Pole Pole scenes and pointless, time wasting small talk scenes that litter every episode could've been taken out in favor of Kuuga trying to earn the police force's trust. Oh, Kuuga got critically injured? Well it's okay he has BS regeneration so no problem. Oh, Kuuga's heart stopped in the hospital? It's okay, he was just getting a new power up. Oh, Kuuga blew up a city? No one got hurt so who cares that he caused millions in yen of damage (I assume no one was in those buildings...?). Oh, Kuuga might end up becoming a biological weapon if he keeps fighting these serial killers? Eh, who cares he looks normal at the end of the show anyway so clearly that didn't happen or if it did it's not a problem. Oh that one girl from Pole Pole was told something really rude and cried and Yusuke had to leave last second and couldn't resolve their argument. But who cares, she made up with the person anyway so no consequences! Oh, Ichigo's mother collapsed at the hospital and makes Ichigo question how much he's overworking himself? EHHH just kidding, she's fine, it's okay to overwork yourself!

The only ""consequences"" that ever happen ever are random civilians who have no connection to the characters whatsoever die. Sure, Yusuke gets mad or whatever, but he smiles at the end of the episode anyway and forgets about them. Oh, acting girl's teacher died? Oh well she forgets him after that episode too. What is the point of anything happening ever if the reality of their deaths forgotten after a episode? Having a sad little funeral scene for 3 seconds doesn't show me how it's affecting the main characters.

I get the point of the show, optimism in the face of bad odds. But genuinely, never at any point do I get the feeling ""Oh damn, idk what's going to happen"". He always shows up and beats the bad guy and it's just wash rinse repeat. It's just watching Kuuga level up and defeat the Elite Four like it's Pokémon. Also like hundreds of people died and everyone is all smiles and rainbows on the final episode. This show just drags its feet for no reason only to be essentially the same as it started. The pacing is unbearably slow and that's coming from someone who puts up with some reeeeaallllly slow shows and generally I feel like I have a LOT of patience. My patience was tried several times during this series.

Also why did the serial killer people keep saying ""you're like us"" now towards the end of the show? The hell they aren't. Ichigo killed a ruthless evil person who kills people for fun. Yusuke did too. Sounds like self defense to me. In what way is he or any ""linto"" like them in any way what so ever? This show likes to pretend it's talking about deep topics but never actually approaches them with any actual introspection. It just lightly touches on it, goes back to ""EHHHH ITS OKAY XD"", and we get another pointless Pole Pole scene where we watch the old guy make coffee and make a corny joke for no reason.

ALSO WHO EVEN ARE THESE GRONGI GUYS?? Are they aliens??? They apparently are human??

I love the atmosphere in this show. The intro is so foreboding and chilling (please watch in a well lit room intro). The ambience is incredible. Final boss guy aura farming was so creepy. That suicide episode was crazy too (needle guy, ep 35 Emotion).

That scene where Kuuga was fighting final villain dude in either Decision 47 or Kuuga 48 (don't remember) and there was fire everywhere and people dying while on fire and it was raining and then Kuuga collapsed from his belt being cracked was actually disturbing (tbh that was the best scene in the show). WHY DIDN'T THAT SCENE HAPPEN?!??!?! I thought it was foreshadowing, was it just a dream???? WHERE IS THAT FIGHT SCENE I WANT TO SEE THAT SCENE PLAY OUT!!!!!!!!!! CUT OUT A FEW OF THE POINTLESS YAPPING SCENES AND SHOW ME KUUGA FIGHTING FINAL BOSS GUY NEXT TO BURNING CARS IN THE RAIN UNTIL HE COLLAPSES!!!!

This show just builds and builds and builds and builds with absolutely no pay off. It's really disappointing, especially since this is my first KR series I finished, ever.

I thought the practical effects were great. So many great shots and cinematography. That scene with Kuuga in the burning church has so much symbolism and I really thought this series would have been even darker and more thought provoking than it was. The digital effects were absolutely terrible and have aged horribly. I could forgive them if the story was genuinely great but this really ended up being a blue ball inducing series.

I can't help but feel like the reason this series has the high reviews it has is because they're all from pre-existing KR fans who gave it high reviews because their standards for peak cinema are red dude punches the bad guy and they blow up. Which granted is pretty peak, but I want a little plot too y'know?

Speaking of which I hated the costumes for the grongi or whatever they're called. Some of them were cool but most of them were awful. That flying guy in the burning church episode was REALLY well done, the darkness cast on him and the low visibility really sold the scene, along with the analog horror influences. The darkness also hid the cheap costume design so they really worked with the lower budget. But as the episodes went on the creativity decreased, as did the costumes. Granted the last couple of bad guys had some pretty good designs, but there's a LOT of costume designs here that look WAY too much like costumes and it combined with the crappy special effects take me out every time. They worked with their small budget well the first couple of episodes but really dropped the bar later on.

Yusuke is such a one dimensional character it hurts. He reacts the exact same way to everything without fail. I think static characters can work but I really don't think a static character like him works in such a slow and uneventful show. I really think it makes it more boring than it should be.

And before someone says, ""This show is about everyone else, not Godai!"", please point to me one character that had an actual arc, and I mean actual arc not ""Oh no I have a problem!"" only to get resolved like two episodes later at the latest. The only character I can think of is Ichigo, and he is such a stoic and emotionless character it's hard to even like him much either.

There's a lot of other things I can nitpick like why weren't the military getting involved when hundreds of Japanese citizens are dying? Seriously? Why aren't people being told to stay inside similar to a covid-like scenario? Why are random patrol officers being sent to take down serial terrorists that kills dozens instead of a SWAT team or a tank even?

I really did enjoy how bloody and brutal this show can be which was a part of the main appeal of the show to me. But considering how uneventful this show ended up being, honestly the blood is kind of over the top for no reason. I sort of enjoyed this series but I'm really disappointed right now. Please someone convince me I'm wrong and a idiot I WANT to love this series. But for right now....

I have a bachelors in communication sciences and disorders, and a masters in Speech Language Pathology and so I feel a bit stuck in my options as I honestly have no interest in my field or even in any adjacent fields. I would like to get out of healthcare entirely. I was never overly passionate about the field while I was in school, and only really figured out that I did not wish to pursue this occupation once I was already halfway through graduate school, so I thought I might as well finish. Now I am in my Clinical Fellowship Year, basically a training year under a supervisor before you can be completely licensed. I plan to finish this year, become fully licensed, while using this year to find another career I can pursue. And that way I will still be able to keep being an SLP as a backup. However, I really, truly do not feel as though this job is right for me and want out, but I have no idea where to start. I feel very stuck due to having such a specialized degree and having not explored other careers and hobbies when I was younger. 

My hobbies include drawing, watching and analyzing movies, reading, photography and baking. I love art and going to museums, collecting coffee table books and dvd’s, decorating, and scouring Pinterest for outfit ideas, recipes, home inspiration, and overall just pretty, aesthetic photographs. I also enjoy being outdoors, hiking and walking, or even just sitting and reading. I’ve looked into many careers such as becoming a graphic designer, photojournalism/travel photography, working various jobs in museums, in publishing, creative or art directing, jobs in the film industry etc. So many decent options, but feeling very overwhelmed in what direction to go in, what is necessary to break into these different fields, and where I would even begin. My resume is definitely…lacking…in anything relating to any of these fields. I want a job that allows for security, a consistent and decent salary, access to health care and other benefits, regular hours, and doesn’t require any more schooling. Other things that would be nice to have, but aren’t dealbreakers necessarily are chances to travel and a hybrid job (both work from home and chances to go into the office).

I’m currently 5m PP. Ever since I had my baby I can literally count in my hand of how many times I’ve gotten invited to hang out. I’ve saw them hanging out with me freshly PP which is no big deal I’m bleeding and breastfeeding don’t want to be out an about. Then they came over for the first month 1/2 probably of total of 3 time all together. I then started seeing them post more stories together, then more, then again more until I said something. I wrote them this because at the time they where together hanging out ALL DAY. 

“Looks like yall are having fun, but I’d love to come along next time. To be honest it’s been a little hard not hearing from yall both much lately. I miss you guys and could really use my friends checking in sometimes. I don’t mind it as much bc my husband is such great company and supporter 100% like this man took me to see The Weeknd very last min bc of how much bored I was in the house doing basically nothing, but anyways it would be nice to have company here too with the baby. And I know yall don’t understand what its is to be a full time mom. It’s just a hear me out thing. Yall don’t have to reply to this text, I just wanted to say how I feel because as friends I should be listened to. Being home 24/7 gets rough sometimes” 


Only one responded. 


I then feel like it was FORCED for them to invite me. Bc they invited me to get coffee the following week. When I go, I see only one friend. The other friend doesn’t make it. Whatever that’s cool. Then I get told “I didn’t think you’d come” Like wow OK HURT. And I go about my day


Weeks pass by & surprise surprise I still don’t get invited nor checked on. What pisses me off the most is that they text each other every other week to hangout. And me? NOTHING. I don’t want to seem like a crybaby but they don’t see what I’m seeing ive been on my lowest and not one has checked up on me. 


Then once again I sent another message on the GC. 


“Just wanted to say again, it might had not been a malicious intent but at this point I feel like it is. If I had never said anything it would of been the same thing even at that it was forced because I said something. But I get it at this point I’m used to it. No one understands the hurt & tears I’ve gone thru every day thinking it’ll change. It might sound silly to yall but PPD is real and everything will hurt me in every way because the people i thought that would care the most hasn’t. Especially from the people you love. I’m not asking for hangouts/ visits anymore, but I just wanted to let yall know how much it impacted on me. I know in my mind I’m 100% right to feel this way because I’ve ever hardly heard from yall maybe a handful of times at most. Meanwhile I see yall hanging out with each other. I’d pray yall won’t ever go through this after having kids because I can tell you it sucks” 

And guess what ONLY ONE RESPONDED. like wtf am I overreacting?!? Then I get told by that one friend “It goes both ways, I shouldn’t be inviting all the time” then proceeds to show me ONE TIME THAT SHE INVITED ME. I said forget it the point went over your head. I re wrote a paragraph and she answered with a picture. And the other friend you might ask? No where to be found. 

For Halloween they threw a party and I wasn’t invited 
They took a trip to Dallas. I wasn’t invited 
They went to Austin. I wasn’t invited 
They went to coffee shops I wasn’t invited 
Birthday brunch. I wasn’t invited 


Like how tf are these so called friends hanging out all the time and I can’t even get a simple TEXT. But atp I muted them I don’t even respond to them bc I ask them for 45 minutes of their life and they couldn’t go like ok fuck yall too. But yet they’re out and about every night.

Just as we wanted, it was supposed to be just a casual hookup. But of course, I liked him, I liked him physically, I was attracted to him, which is why I hooked up with him. He told me he felt the same. After that, I decided to delete my G app and be exclusive with him for safety reasons.

On our second meet, I slept over at his apartment. We talked about a lot of things, life, love, career, etc. It was a very wholesome experience and felt like it wasn’t just a hookup. We cuddled all night, and when we woke up, I went straight to the shower. After I got out, food and coffee were ready, and he even booked and paid for my ride to work. At that moment, I got confused. Was that just basic human decency, and I was just overthinking it?

As weeks went by, our communication didn’t stop. We would always talk about random things, funny memes, dirty jokes, my love life (he would even encourage and help me look for a boyfriend), and our work.

Then, on our third meet, I slept over at his apartment again. The same thing happened, fun and wholesome conversations, cuddling all night, eating dinner together. He was really accommodating. We would meet about once a month because his boyfriend stays at his apartment, so we only meet when we get the chance. There were also times I couldn’t go because of schedule conflicts.

Once, we were talking about hookups, and he told me he felt guilty because I was being exclusive with him, and he couldn’t do the same. He also told me that sleepovers weren’t allowed based on the rules he and his boyfriend made for their open relationship. He said it was supposed to be just a hookup, but we kept in touch and would still meet whenever we could.

1ot16cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesToldWeirdly/comments/1ot16cd/portal_on_the_floor_chapter_from_dravens_hellfire/,Portal on the floor. (Chapter from Draven’s Hellfire.),"
Valleys wreathed in wraiths and ghouls. Ventricles wired to a massive heart in the backdrop of the womb. Murmuring off kilter. Beating, nevertheless. Throbbing like bicycle brakes as they contract and constrict in tune with the other vessels that line the carnal walls. 

Specters raping vultures by the roadside. Vultures eating the undead—just trying to clean up the mess the specters made. The undead just trying to get away. Portals all over the highway—driving south and away. The openings are always on the ground—never in the sky above his head. In and out of portals taking him to a land colored in blood red. Absolute and abysmal, the molochs feed, skittering off to hide as Draven passes by. He always detects staring eyes but never sees a soul or pupil. 

Knows the adversary is always viewing like an eagle from his skybox behind the holy gates. Draven can see his outline through the veil if he looks hard enough. Barred by religious rule—God can watch but he can’t touch. So if and when prayers are answered here—it’s only fortune, and luck. Our lives have been in Hell all along—on the edge of circle one. 

Everything makes sense to him now, taking a  drag from his cigarette and flicking it in the dirt. Thinking he must’ve slipped through a portal on the highway. The scenery is no longer flashing different filters. Its all red on the rocks in the foreground. 
The big sky is sheened in maroon too, as he stops his bike and takes the scenery in. An odd mist settles in the air, floating droplets of blood.  Glistening In the lowest light of a tinted rosewood sun. Veiled by crimson, red covers everything in sight. A bloodshot backdrop within the horizon line as he put a salute to his head to visor his eyes. Red as rust as far as his optics could take—like a scene from Mars happening on Earth. Even the white paint on the road side is tinted with burgundy hues. Everything beneath a filter of vermillion. Nothing black or green or blue—only a darker shade of red and its corrosion. 

Visor still above his brow, focusing on the road ahead; Flames flicker on the horizon’s line like an Army marching to the killing fields for battle. The splitting tops of fire like the spears and javelins of knights on horseback. Red and orange flags of the guard, waving in the form of firestorms as their weaponry jostles back and forth from the stride of It’s carriers—the thoroughbreds of Hades—Palomino and Arabians—armored up and prancing ahead on the frontline—putting on a dance for Ares. Marching onward towards death, and to set fire to the holy lands again. 

It dawned on him then, like the blood red sunrise—he’s received a gift. To cruise the limits of the underworld with a free pass through Hell’s gates. Up ahead within the flames must be the boundary and the River Styx. 

He’ll make sure not to hit another portal on his way to the flames, see where this road takes him, where it goes and whether it makes him or breaks him. If it turns him from a crow to a sparrow or from a sparrow to a condor. 
He knows if the devil catches him out of bounds that he’ll burn inside of his flesh until he plucks him out again. If he lives—he’ll always have a piece of Hell stuck in. He’s always had a piece of some sin inside of him on purgatory Earth. Damaged goods may never repair. So they must always remain. He found that there’s a portal to Hell inside of everyone—waiting for their last exhale. Though, If you cut them off at the head—the road to Hell unveils. 

Been driving on for so long, inhaling white pipes instead of sleep. Smoking Marlboro lights again that he stole from a roadside merchant that he beheaded. Stole two cartons. Don’t smoke much because you can’t with a helmet on. Don’t know how long he’s been awake but it’s been more than a few sunsets. Riding to Hell on two wheels and having the time of his life. Who needs sleep when you can cut throats with a knife? Who needs a nine to five when you can dissever with a machete? His inner monologue inquires. 

At rest areas along the highways in Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma he conducted a string of beheadings. Blood baths, cut em all down like Jonny Cash, but he had them seeing black instead of wearing it. Dressed in red instead like a wedding or a ventricle. Left or right—offed their heads—left God to close the caskets. Married to the road and she’s been a loyal companion. Curled back through Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado.  Just riding white and yellow lines. Barely eating just inhaling smoke. Forgetting to drink water like he always does. Fell asleep on two wheels but woke up parked on the side of the road, sleeping under a sprawling spruce, bike with its kickstand down. Colorado or Nebraska he can’t remember which. Drove through the rocky mountains too. 
All those snowy peaks seemed to him like they were too high to scale or climb—considering there are other ways to get high that are less labor intensive and easier on the mind. Never changes clothes or wears deodorant. Hasn’t  since he left town. Nobody riding with him to care. Can’t smell himself yet so he can’t be that bad. Rode hard and rode long—state line by state line. 

The lack of sleep started to catch up to him—dazing off—following the center line. Nearly bit the asphalt but since he’s already in Hell—no divine intervention to save his life. Pulled off the highway and went to sleep under the overpass—the afternoon sun was blazing an inferno through his lids—so he got up and hit the road again.  

A couple more weeks of easy riding like an outlaw in the wild west. Riding a stolen BMW instead of a Mustang or Palomino. With the wind at his back. His stallion lived for the road. Quiet as a compliment. 

The urge to kill came on strong at the Texas border. By the time he reached Austin, that’s all he could think about. But he wanted more this time, blood and infamy. Someone famous and more important to the grand scheme. He stopped off at a coffee joint to charge his phone. Carrier locked because he hasn’t paid the bill but he can still use Wifi. He used Google maps to plot his next move.  

He squinted at the coffee shop’s screen, the blue glow hard and bright against his bloodshot eyes. The Wi‑Fi spun like a rusty wheel while he scrolled through names — musicians, anchors, a senator, a preacher whose face was everywhere on late‑night clips. 
He wanted a name that would echo, something that would print his own into every headline. Fame, infamy. A celebration for the anniversary of his birth and death. 

Sleep debt blurred.  The coffee burned his tongue but it was noise, not salvation. People moved around him like props or boat motors, a barista with ink on her fingers, bags under her hazels, a couple students arguing over a map, a soccer mom whose posture said she hates her life but she’s living it anyway. No one here is innocent, they’re all fucking, guilty.

1ot165c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ot165c/aitah_for_breaking_up_with_him_because_he_called/,AITAH for breaking up with him because he called my family a waste of his time?,"For context, this happened about 8 months ago.  Me (F33) and my ex-bf (M31) got into an argument like most couples do and he called my family a waste of time so I ended our otherwise good 1 year relationship.

Some background:

Me and my ex met at a friend's party.  He's a med student in his 4th year and I work in the hospitality industry in a town about 30 minutes away.   When we met it wasn't like some couples where there is crazy chemistry at first - he pursued me and I gave it a shot and we actually found that fundamentally we were both very similar in terms of personality - ambitious, introverted, very hard on ourselves, independent, love animals, discipline, wanted family, etc.  I come from a lower class family of tradesmen, teachers, and first responders and he comes from a family of pretty impressive careers - inventor, multiple PHD's, PHD-DO's, etc.  He was also bi-curious.  Which - no big deal as long as he was open with me about it, but something I didn't have much experience with in the dating world up to this point.  

We had our fights but also always respected each other's boundaries.  Our communication was good but we also broke up once where he needed a break to focus on school and his rotation which I thought was odd and usually is a deal breaker for me but I gave him a second chance about 3 weeks later.   I understood med school can be demanding and I chalked it up to being overwhelmed.  But never really got to the bottom of why the need to call it quits other than space, time to think, etc on his side.   This is usually a red flag to me but...again...he was literally studying and rotating in his clinical rotation 18 hours a day.   He was also taking multiple medications to help him manage the pressure of med school - think the typical ADHD medications along with anti-anxiety medications and the occasional cigarette or joint.   I'll drink and smoke on rare occasion but otherwise try to only take something if I need it temporarily.  

On the day I broke up with him we were set to meet my family that weekend so I came late on a Friday (we both worked during the day) and planned to spend the morning with him, swing back to my place for a change of clothes, and come back that night to leave in the morning the following day to meet my family.   It's worth noting - he had only met my Dad at this point and had not yet met anyone else in my family and even that meeting I had to force as it was on a random day my dad was in town so we celebrated his birthday and I brought my BF over to introduce him.  They got along and I thought all was well.  I even drove to a different state to meet his parents (7 hour drive) where we also had a few minor arguments but seemingly had a great time and he said his family liked me....

Fast forward a few months later to the day we broke up again and he went out to get us coffee in the morning so I tagged along.  He wanted to go to one place and I another - so we got into an argument.  When we drove back home he was obviously irritated and got out of his car before me, locking me in his car with his key-fob.  I got out and set the car alarm off which seemed pretty dramatic as he stormed back in the house.  We got into another argument in the house about the day, how he had to go study and how I should just stay in his apartment and me wanting to go home quick and change and come back, which escalated to him being a bit controlling and never thinking like he is good enough, etc.  He did apologize for storming off and I thought we were okay but when I was driving home to change he called me and told me to not come back and not worry about him going with me to meet my family because they were a waste of time.   In what felt like a snap judgement at the time I remember calmly saying, ""I think we should end our relationship"" to which he replied he hated me.  I oddly felt reassurance as if he valued our relationship and future I felt like he would have prioritized meeting my family like I had his.  I sent a summary text of how I thought he would be happier dating another resident and how I felt like I couldn't be enough for him thinking he was good enough, hot enough, smart enough, etc.  

I don't want to think he was a narcissist because nobody is perfect but I can't shake the feeling like I was more of arm-candy for him and though he took responsibility for how he acted, I felt like him saying my family was a waste of his time, even though they were important to me, and him not at least proirtizing meeting them 1 year into the relationship meant that he either had severe reservations about the relationship or was cheating on me or something.  

Anyways - AITAH?  He did try reaching out a few times afterward to apologize but I felt like the damage was done and I focused on moving on.  I felt like if we broke up once and got back together we probably weren't meant to be.  And the contempt he had for my family's background?  education?  socioeconomically status?  would have lead us to break up anyways...I am not perfect either and we had our little fights but they were always between us and not escalated...I was heartbroken and still am almost a year later as we were otherwise really good for each other and my nervous system felt at ease just nerding out at home with him but with his career in medicine I felt like I would eventually have been 50% or less of a partner and our time together would inevitably always be limited.  He also seemed to have very high swings in mood due to the stress from med school and possibly other factors.

I’ve read about scams where they do that and then refuse to take you back until you pay another fee. Whole thing was also a bit uncomfortable. Gf was a bit annoyed I kept saying no.

Was I being overly cautious or rude? I felt bad but he accepted the ride knowing it was a far drive.

I've been single for a couple of years after being in relationships since I was 29. I find online dating to be frustrating currently, because they give you so little space to really describe yourself! A handful of pictures, maybe a few short blurbs about your hobbies (or a few sentences), and that's it. So, after stumbling on this subreddit, I thought I'd give something different a shot.

I'm white, 38, 5'11 and 175lbs with brown hair and a beard. I wear glasses and I'm practically blind without them. I live and work downtown. My current job involves a bit of travel, but nothing excessive, and overall I now have an amazing work-life balance with low stress. 

I've got a variety of hobbies. I'm a fan of soccer, in particular EPL, and try to watch at least one game a week (time permitting). I love to travel, but I'm not really an all-inclusive / beach person. I much prefer actively visiting historical sites, museums, food tours, nature preserves, etc. I'm fond of camping and hiking, in either the early spring or late summer/fall (the bugs eat me alive if I go anywhere in Ontario in the summer). I'm a fan of the arts, in particular live theatre (Fringe festival is my favourite time of year in Toronto), live music (mostly metal and classical), and live comedy (improv more than standup). I enjoy going to the ROM and AGO, and smaller museums. I'm a foodie and I'm always down to try new restaurants (Japanese, Korean, and Chinese are my favourites).

For quieter hobbies, I'm into tabletop and board games, and video games. I follow a number of different podcasts, like OSPod, Sounds like a Cult, and Moviestruck. I'm a voracious reader; mostly science fiction, fantasy, and history, although I will dabble in other genres when something appeals to me. I will watch a variety of TV shows, although I'm not really a fan of reality TV. Movies I'm down for pretty much anything, although my favourites by far are Horror and Action (especially older martial arts films).

My friends would describe me as thoughtful, caring, considerate, and contemplative. I'm quiet, but not because I'm shy, rather because I prefer to listen. I think things through before I respond. But on the right topic I will absolutely talk your ear off.

If you've made it this far, you're wondering what am I looking for? A long term partner, but not keen to rush things. I'd rather spend quality time together through our shared hobbies and interests, and learning about what you enjoy in the hobbies and interests we don't share! We can chat for a bit on here, and then grab a coffee or tea in person and see where things go. ",2,1762738696.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False

“Yeah… I’m glad too, dad.”

The bride wore a ball-gown – patterned white, a long train, and the one she had her eyes on since she was in high school. She’d saved it for someone special, her one and only. And right now, it was only him that she saw in her eyes, standing at the altar. Curly dark hair and clean shaven, he wore a bright tuxedo, with that smile to boot. The violins played Wedding March and the guests – family and friends all stood with big smiles; they gave this couple their silent blessing, as the bride’s father had too.

It was an indoor venue. The windows are sealed well, with little sign left behind of ever being ones there. No expense was spared, it did well to stave off that heat from the outside with little noise.

The father's boots landed heavy and slow up the marble steps, the old man that held the hands of his daughter adjusting his leg to find surer footing on the ground. Bride and groom now faced each other – childhood friends, to highschool sweethearts, and soon to be husband and wife.

Deep and gruff, his voice tried hard to carry a weight of authority as he pulled himself close to the groom, “You take ca- You make sure you and Sonya live a happy life… You hear me, Peter?”

But no words came. None yet, anyways. The old man looked up and saw the man biting his lips, trying to push up a smile, eyes glossed over with tears. Peter gave a single sniff, then said, “That I will, sir. You take care of your own daughter just fine, yeah?”

And this time, tears welled up in the old man’s eyes. He couldn’t bear to let this young man see him cry then, and pulled him in closer, hugging him.

“I will, son… I will.”

It was the picture-perfect wedding. Young love triumphed, and none would object. None possibly could. They kissed, now spouses two in the month of March – under the first Autumn leaves that fell in Spring.

The sun was dipping now behind the distant buildings. Still, when the rooftop door opened to Sonya, a blast of prickling heat followed, with that glow of red in the sky. She pushed open the door with her shoulders, cake in one hand and an open umbrella in the other. She saw the young man sitting near the edge of the roof staring at that setting sun, unburdened by its rays. Speechless, both from the stunning beauty of the star of day, and the fact that Peter was sitting there without any protection, eating a slice of cake. He turned around, seeing the look on her face.

“Cooler today, ain’t it? Don’t even need an umbrella.”

“Mmhm.”

Sonya uses her feet to drag a brick to hold the door open, before propping her umbrella against the entrance there and entering with wine in her left hand. She takes a seat, leaning against the man. His hair felt nice – the softest and most comfortable.

“Is that all supposed to be for me?”

“Mmhm.”

“Cause you know you can’t drink with th-”

“I know. I know, it’s not that strong. And at least one of us should be drinking the wine we bought for this>’

She presses up against the cork, thumbing it open with a loud pop. Peter accepts the bottled red from her, taking his first sip. It was sweet like grape juice, and just how he liked it.

“I-is something wrong honey?”

Sonya moved a piece of cake around her plate without having taken a single bite out of it. She only snapped back to that present moment after hearing her husband’s words.

“Yeah… sorry Peter hah… It’s just the same thing I talked to you about the night we found out about the baby. I’m just a lil’ worried about some stuff, that’s all.”

“We’re gonna be just fine, Sonya. The state mandates that your employer has to give you paid maternity leave later on, even if you’re quite a new hire. Plus, we’ve got your dad, my dad, my mom, my sister… Point is, we’ll be just fine-”

“I know, I know,” she turns away just enough to hide the slight annoyance in her eyes. Sometimes, he didn’t know how exactly to help, “I guess… It’s just that I don’t know if I’m gonna be a good mother, is all. Some friends tell me that they feel this inexplicable joy and… I don’t think I’ve felt it, y’know?”

Peter pulls her in closer, resting his head on hers now before turning his torso to give her a small hug, which turned into him holding both her shoulders, “Well I’m scared too. Dunno how much it’s worth but I think I get less scared that I’m gonna be a father of a child that’s gonna have you as a mom. And you gotta know that I’m gonna be there, aight? Throughout the entire way. You know that, right?”

Sonya turns back. Some other times, he knew exactly what to say.

“I know.”

Sonya feels his hand come to rest on her belly. Hers follow suit. She wondered if the baby, even then, could feel the odd stillness in the air – like the world holding its breath.

“So… how drunk’s dad right now?”

“Oh,” Sonya says, blowing a raspberry, and making a drinking motion with her hand, “Already showing my uncles photos of his past camping trips.”

Peter laughed. And things would be good for a while.

The First Trimester

“Scientists are now saying that the early Autumn is actually a sign of warmer Summers to come. Let’s hear more fro- Psshhhhat- I voted for you because I thought you could stop the fires, Mr. President. I thought we’d finally get permanent homes.. WHERE ARE OUR HOMES MR- Psshhhhat- Kyrieee, Eleisooon. Let us join our hands in prayer, and pray for all of those stricken by the new droughts around the world. May God sa- Pssssheu- zzz”

The front door opens and Sonya turns the television off. She turns around from the sofa, “Did’ja manage to fit the crib in the car, Peter?”

He pokes his head in, from the side of the living room entrance, the box filled with planks and screws rattling around as he gives that goofy smile. Unsurprisingly, his light grey stubble gives it a goofier quality of sorts.

“You betcha. Got you those donuts you like so much too.”

“Thanks, Pete. Just leave them in the kitchen for now.”

A coat, a sweater, then scarf and beanie were tossed onto the other chair in the living room. Peter sits himself down on the chair with a tired sigh. He was soaked with sweat, and thus adjusted his seating to the edge of the leather.

“Where’s your dad?” Peter says, cracking open a can of Fanta, and taking a few sips from it, “didn’t see him in his room.”

“He’s closing shop downtown right now. Not exactly the best time to be running a sauna with… everything that’s happening.”

“Good on him. The guy could’ve retired a good while back. Poor man deserves a break.”

“Hey could you also get me o-”

Peter waves his hands in front of him, and takes out another cold can of soda with a silent ‘tadaa!’

“Thanks,” Sonya responds flatly, taking the can and cracking it open to drink, “I bet the kids in the Kindergarten love it when you do stuff like that, huh? Are your parents able to make it today?”

“My mom had to cancel because of some work stuff. Says she’ll come during the later half of dad’s trip though. Dad says he’ll be coming a bit later on tonight. The radiation keeps messing with his GPS or something.”

“I see.”

They both take a sip from their cans of drink. Their blinds and curtains were drawn open, allowing filtered light to pour in through the windows. The weather wasn’t hot per se. It was standard for autumn, and perhaps the freshest and cleanest air the two had breathed their entire life – clean as water in the ice caps. But the light was becoming poison. It distilled slower where the two lived, but still it grew in toxicity, day-by-day. Already, they’d given up on painting the walls outside, the paint discolouring under the afternoon sun.

“Hey, I’ll just put something on the telly while I go whip up something for us to eat, alright?”

“N-nah, that won’t be necessary I think. Just tune the old radio to something nice for yourself. I haven’t showered yet.”

The front door opens again, this time, slower steps enter. A voice called out from the entrance, “Finished up at the old place. Found some old photos as well… I think.” His voice was strained, and so Sonya rushed to the door, offering to help him carry his things. It’d only been two months, but not many would’ve guessed, looking at the guy.

His skin, still bronzed from days of work under the sun, now shone more clearly with the gloss of old age and splotches of white and purple that came with no real reason. The stocky and built frame he had on the day of the wedding had withered away into less meat, and just… less.

“This is why… dad.. I’ve told you many times to just… bring Peter along with you.”

The weight turns light as a third person takes the load off for both of them, carrying the box to the other room.

“W-when did you tell me that, now? You never said anything about that.”

“Just this morning, dad. I thought you were going to call him after you were done cleaning up the stall.”

“A-ah…”

The silence lasted for a few seconds before Sonya turned on the TV and changed the channel from the religious one, “Which one do you want to watch Pa?”

“The documentary one. My favourite program should be over already but the one that runs at six is pretty good. They’re showing reruns of Ocean Planet around this time I think.”

The screen flashed to a shot of a marine mammal – one of many that existed before the surface waters got too hot. This one grew bigger than the many large beasts of land and even the giant squid that emerged since those times before, drawn to the warmer waters above. Narrating it all was a deep and accented man’s voice, carrying with it the awe and reverence the world should have warranted from man. These things were enough already to set the old man into a comfortable haze, slouching back into the couch and watching the drifting currents on the screen. It was left to Sonya to take off the many layers of clothing he still kept on.

He uttered a small and perfunctory thank you to his daughter before continuing, “I usually hate these broadcasting services. All no-good peddlers of their agenda, fearmongers and the fakest shit you’ve had ever seen in your life. And I’ve lived for my fair share of those. But one thing these guys did right was stopping this show after the honourable man who voiced it all passed on. Hats off to them I say.”

“Hats off to them,” Sonya agrees.

The evening ran quick after Peter’s father came. He arrived in his jeep and emerged from the garage.

“Howdy! Is that Greg watching that show again?”

“Hey. All goes well, Mateo,” replied Grigor, to his neighbour of many years, from times passed, “Catch anything today?”

Mateo raises up a blue and white cooler box, “Squid again.”

They were friends in high school, friends in the military, and then friends again as fathers to the married couple. It was a small world in a big city. And it helped that half the apartments were left derelict and abandoned. They ate, talked and then reminisced for a while longer. The night held the day’s warmth and vigour well. The alcohol helped the two old men much to do this. The heat helped make it difficult for much rest to be found until some hours past midnight.

And then it was two in the morning. Sonya couldn’t sleep. She just found herself reviewing her case notes in bed. Paying clients paid their lawyers well to do a good job; they paid top dollar to warrant attorneys like Sonya just to simplify and shorten documents for them to read. Patience and attention were rare commodities today — they said it depended on whose parents had switched early from plastic to glass. Most men were stripped of finer intellectual faculties but really, it had been a whole fiasco overblown. There had even been people that warned of the bioaccumulation of microplastics to lead to the extinction of man. No, no, man didn’t go extinct, so things were still good.

Then it was three in the morning. Sonya shuts her laptop off, feeling her eyelids heavy at last. She had to stop herself from continuing. It was only the coughs of the old men in the other room that stirred her from her nods off.

She kept the glossy black device under her desk, catching sight of the glow that burnt into the night sky. It was a pretty glow, embers thrown into the atmosphere from the forests and fires of midtown. Sonya smiled. Really, dread was something only afforded to a people that were running out of time to fix a problem. Only tranquility was left to the people of this time. The Second Trimester

“Oh my god! Sonya! You’re still so thin, darling! You have got… to eat more,” the lady, equally tall and loud in a floral blouse with naturally curly hair dyed a light brown, started, “Is it him? Is it because Peter starves you? Just tell, m’kay? B’cause I’ve whooped his ass before and I’ll do it again. Lemme te-”

She trailed on for a good while. And she was certainly a very talkative woman. Her name was Donna. Everyone has that one aunt whom your mother takes you to shop with once or twice a year. Everyone but Peter. That aunt was his mother.

It was at the tail-end of Autumn now. The leaves that fell were gray and translucent. So was the dirty glass that hid the interior of the showrooms of rows upon rows of bunkers. They varied from the more affordable and functional one-room types that would protect you from the sun unveiled, to the slightly less dull mansionettes that ran for two or three floors, luxury where it could be found these days.

“How’s about this one now? Looks kind of like the old house, doesn’t it, son?”

The house Mateo pointed to had a concrete exterior, though it kept a thin lining of wood plastered on the inside. It looked quite homely. It even had a sloped ceiling and those open-layout built-in furniture. It made it look larger than it actually was.

“It does, pa. I don’t think rustic’s what we’re looking for though.”

Sonya was clinging to Peter’s side. Maybe it was just her, but she didn’t fancy shopping for housing nowadays. The National Department of Housing and Development and realtors assure the people that such enclosed layouts didn’t pose any dangers to the health of their occupants.

And maybe they were right. For years now, people have cloistered themselves in their houses, either living at work or working at home. Food no longer demanded one to step foot in the streets – for day found blistering heat from above, from the rays that had perforated the sky’s fine lining, while night felt that same heat come from cracked concrete skeletons and sticky tarmac. In truth, it had been like this even before the summers had gotten this bad. Ultraviolet showers gave you and your plants everything the sun could – the new normal, people called it. Sonya caressed the now visible bump that showed through her woolen sweater, looking at it. She wondered if her baby would ever get to see a first snow.

She whispered to Peter, “Hey, honey. I think I need to sit down somewhere for a bit.”

“S-should I come with?”

“You go on ahead.”

Sonya had only begun to walk away from the group when she felt Donna clasp her hands around her arm.

“Come on. Let’s you an’ me go together then, spend some girl time away from the boys, hmm?”

They found the display area for the recliner chairs and took their seats there. The store’s speaker systems were playing the amateur-ish voice of a young woman with a difficult accent repeating the deals they had on for the new pay-to-install insulant lining as they sat in silence for some time. Donna did so to give Sonya some rest. Sonya did so, having noticed that Donna already had her phone out with pictures of what she could only assume was yet another baby product. Those moments didn’t last for long, Donna shifting her chair closer to Sonya, and leaning in close to show her a photo of what looked like a small jar of cream.

“So what you’re gonna want to do is apply this over wh-”

Sonya snorted, and then began giggling, pulling her hand up to cover her mouth.

“Ah… I’m sorry dear. It is a bit weird for me to be showing you this he-”

“No… hahahah- No you’re perfectly good, Mrs Smith. And I’m sorry, Mrs Smith. It’s just you’re the first person whose gotten something for me, and not the baby.”

On her phone, she was showing an opaque white container of cream, labelled ‘Breastfeeding Ointment’, sealed with a metal lid.

“Ohh… so you were saying something about how to use it, is that right?”

“Yes, that’s right dear. So this is for after the pregnancy but I’d suggest stocking up now before things get too bad outside. What you’re gonna want to do is…”

They talked together about things, Donna sharing some stories Sonya hadn’t heard before during her own pregnancy with Peter.

“Y’know… I wish that you would just call me mum, after so many years.”

Sonya lets out a small hiss of air out of her nose, and smiled, staring down, “I know Peter does that for dad already but I think I’ve just gotten way to used to calling you and Mateo, Mr. and Mrs. Smith already.”

“Ahh know, ah know. Just sayin.”

The store hummed softly under fluorescent light, nearly empty now. Sonya was still staring at her shoes when she said, “You know you’re my mom, though.”

And this time, it was Donna’s turn to smile, letting out that sniffling laugh, nodding in response. And they let the moment hang for a bit there, before Donna spoke again, “How’s Greg holding up these days at home?”

“Oh… well I think he’s still doing fine. He helps around the house quite a bit still, though I am glad we made him close up shop when he did. He forgets the names of people he sees on television a lot of the time now though.”

Donna opened her mouth to say something but closed it, placing her hand on Sonya’s lap instead, rubbing it.

“You’re being very strong about all of this business y’know?”

“Yeah. Maybe not dad’s ex-wife but I do wish a lot of the time that he would have someone who connects with him better to accompany him on his worse days.”

“Ah know darling. Ah know.”

The three men came back not long after this. They’d done everything they came to the store to settle that day and were just about ready to head back home.

They pushed open the door to the airlock connected to the building. It smelt flatly of sweat and warehouse, Peter pulling open the locker to place the radiation poncho on Sonya as it was harder to fit on with the baby. She put on the mask and goggles on herself just fine. And then they left the building to the sheer temperature outside – to streets of barren trees of late fall.

They stepped out into the late evening. Though it wasn’t light that touched them anymore, no, it was something closer to memory. The Third Trimester

The three – Sonya, Grigor and Peter – sat at their couch in the living room. They waited, breaths bated, while they listened to snippets of the conversation the visiting Mateo was having with Donna on the phone. They could only hear his side of it all, and he had done a good job to hide the worry in it.

“I- I see. Yes, I still have my key to it. Have you checked the garage door? It’s closed right? You’re certain it’s closed… Alright then.”

The bunker had a rather minimalistic Scandinavian design. Light wooded browns complemented blue fabric furniture and curtains – ones that covered the false sunlight from the outside. It was only a little smaller than Grigor’s house. This was the house Sonya, Peter, and Grigor would live in and prepare for the baby boy that was soon to come a month from then. Mateo and Donna lived in a separate bunker, not too far from theirs, in case anything happened to any one of them, so they could help each other out.

Peter didn’t say the first words, for he’d already gone to his room. The folks in the living room heard him ruffling through the clothes on hangers in the wardrobe, no doubt looking for his radiation poncho. So Sonya was the first to speak, “Wh- What did she say? Is she fine right now?”

Mateo’s voice hung grim and low, the kind of gravel that filled the room, “She’s safe, Sonya. She’s in the garage of our bunker and well… It’s still night out.”

At this, some relief washed over Sonya’s face, her pupils no longer pinpricks. Her sigh was followed by Mateo continuing on, “But she let some young kid, a girl wearing a jacket I think… The girl asked for shelter from Donna when Donna was heading back to the bunker. Donna said all she did was ask her where her parents were. That sent the young girl into all sorts of panic, locking herself inside of the bunker, screaming that she didn’t want to be taken back to her father. She took Donna’s key inside with her.”

Sonya nodded, her mouth open, “O-okay. If Peter can’t make it back here from your place safely before dawn, please just tell him to stay at your place, okay? Grigor and I will be fine here for a day.”

Mateo nodded. His poncho was on the coat rack, and began to wear it. Peter came out of the room soon after, already in the silvery coat that reflected the yellow lights of the house in every direction. Sonya saw him packing items in his duffel bag, looking for that one thing he always misplaced somewhere in the house. Sonya saw herself moving to find it – the water bottle that was always in the top cabinet of the kitchen, and always somehow invisible to Peter – handing it to him. Sonya saw an opportunity for her to touch his hands with hers. Peter held it back. Her skin was smooth, and his skin soft with hair. Peter was the one to move his hand away first this time, a rare first, continuing to finish packing everything up for the excursion.

Sharp and red – alarms rang in dragged high notes as the button was pushed by Mateo to open the doors to the garage.

“Use the landline at their place to call me when you get there okay?”

“I will honey.”

“What are you gonna do with the girl?”

“Maybe nothing at all. Hopefully, she would’ve let Mom in by the time we get there.”

“Maybe.”

Peter hung close to Sonya, pressing himself against her belly as he kissed her for a good few seconds. He said something about them having more than four times the amount of time needed to get to the bunker, only an hour and a half away, and not to worry so much. The car engine started, its sporadic bursts of activity heard loud and clearly from the living room. The young father was about to leave, until he stopped at the door, hanging on the door frame.

“Hey, dad! Greg!”

At this, the man that sat in a grooved and stretchy singlet that sat on the sofa became lucid again, staring up to look at Peter. His face painted with a coat of confusion.

“You’ll take care of your daughter just fine until I get back, yeah?”

Nobody said anything for a few seconds. The car the only one that didn’t hold their breaths under the heavy air.

“I will, son. That I will.”

Peter’s face turned into a smile for the first time in an hour as he gave the wall of the living room two last smacks for good luck, “We’ll be off then. See you guys!”

“Remember to take your boots off before you get into their place! You always forget!”

And they were gone.

Sonya found herself pacing around the living room after taking out a book to read initially. The sound of the television could be heard behind her, the deep voice of an old and British knight narrating the hunt of the giant cats of the Serengeti – residents of an old house of cards, folded, waterlogged and burnt now all the same. They were made vagrants, doomed to humble artificial abodes, or made docile to “preserve biodiversity” in bunkers with hairless aliens.

These were the young days of a new kind of Summer. Tar and varnished wooding are made fuel under the daylight, and signals that combat the surface radiation come and go distorted and warped. Fall, Winter and Autumn are events as the Woolly Mammoth, Dodo and whales are – they all were – things made antiques. People were advised to weather the first five decades of the new era until all the major sources of “difficult fuel” have dried up, enabling folks to reinhabit the surface assuming scientists finish up their discovery of a machine that would stop radioactive decay. This, this and certainly nothing more, had to be the new normal. All things considered, it wasn’t that bad, because they still could be so much worse. The friendly and honeyed words that men on the cable television said that they’d actually been lucky to have been afforded the luxuries of a nuclear energy generator that could be fitted into a storeroom. They were lucky that the miracle tonics and tisanes of the future could save them from the slew of new monsters that emerged from the ice-caps and tiny plastic knives that laced every water source. It might have just been indulgence then, that Sonya found herself wondering if her child would ever grow to see the blue sky of day in his entire life.

Sonya didn’t know how long she’d been ruminating to herself, the still stagnant nighttime lighting of the bunker giving no indicator. She was only snapped out of it when she had heard her father start to reminisce again, for the first time in weeks at this point, “I served in the Annexation War of Mongolia… before I settled down and had a daughter in the United States.”

Sonya knew about this one already. He set it up this same specific way each time, leading into the story about how he learned to make milk tea the same way the Mongols did – mixing tea leaves with ox milk, instead of water. She liked it though, and so she listened. He continued, voice interrupted by his phlegm-ruined throat.

“We came in… from the northern border near Baikal. It took some time before we saw it, but we saw it- it-... all of it was beautiful.”

The story was different.

“Golden stalks of grass that carpeted rolling hills and flats as far as the eye could see. All with no tree, nor sea in sight. And above it, lied the clearest, and bluest sky any man could have ever laid their eyes on. It was midday, and so the sun was up high but it didn’t make light of that deepness. There were no oceans there, but the sky still held the reflection of one. Blue skies! As far as my eyes could take me.”

He recalled all of this, his dried eyes wetting with tears – hands rubbing the fabric of the sofa as if it were a map he was reading. Sonya was the first to speak next.

“Sir?”

“Yeah?”

“May I have your name again? I must have forgotten it.”

“It’s uhh…”

Grigor paused there, his voice trailing off as he stared into the distance that didn’t exist – straight into the wooden floor. He looked up again, some shock in his eyes now as he said, “W-wh- why are you crying young lady?”

“I-it’s nothing. Uhh… You were telling me about your daughter before I think.. Maybe we could continue with that?”

“No, nonsense. I’ll tell you all about her later. Maybe we could talk about what’s bothering you first, young lady.”

Sonya knew she shouldn’t try this line of talk right now. Her mouth said differently.

“I’m… I’m going to become a mother soon, you see? And things are kind of scary right now.”

“You seem like a perfectly capable young lady. I mean… looking at your place, it looks like you’re doing quite well for yourself.”

“I was, I- I really was. I worked in a law firm before, and it fetched good money I suppose. I don’t think any of what I learnt translated over here at home though. That’s more of my husband’s thing.”

“Well! Well there you have it. It sounds like you have yourself a nice husband right? Good family too?”

“Only the best I could hope for. But I have to take care of my dad as well… And he’s sick.”

“I can’t speak for you, but it sounds like you’re going to be okay then, right? Your dad raised a fine young lady. I trust you’ll do a fine job taking care of him with your family.”

“Mmhm.”

“O-oh no… You’re crying again. Did I say something wrong?”

“No, no you didn’t. I think I’m just being unreasonably worried right now… my husband’s gone on a trip and I’m worried something will happen to him on the way there. I don’t know what I’m gonna do then.”

“Mother? Siblings?”

“It’ll just be me and my dad..”

The tears couldn’t stop then. They came, choked and interrupted only by stiff inhales through her mucus-caked nostrils. The old man just sat there, the tightest pang of pity in his heart. He didn’t know what he could do to help this nice stranger. This went on for several minutes.

“I’m just being stupid. He should be reaching there in less than an hour. I-”

She stopped, and quickly turned to hold her breath and wipe the tears off her face. Grigor’s face had blanked out again at that time. He was staring into a wall this time.

An hour and a half had passed, then two. Eventually, it was only two hours till dawn. Then the call finally came. The exhausted woman drifted off in her recliner, woken up by the thin strip of red light that flashed urgently from the wall, signalling an incoming call. She’d tripped over the coffee table, almost waking up Grigor in the process trying to get to the button. She pressed the button, and heard nothing but heavy breathing for the first few seconds. Her smile vanished.

“H-hey did we manage to connect to you guys?”

“Peter?”

He sounded muffled and somewhat tired, though it was happiness that Sonya heard cut through, if only for one moment.

“Sonya, you have to listen to me okay. S-stay where you are. We’re going to be okay, you hear? We’ve contacted the local search and rescue guys and they’re saying they’re gonna make it here so-”

“Wait… What the fuck happened, Peter?”

Only his breathing punctuated the silence.

“... We ran across a patch of melted tarmac. Our truck got stuck, and I don’t think we’re able to make the jump to the side of the freeway. You have to li-”

“Bring Mateo on the line.”

Her voice cut off what was bound to be another round of rambling. Hers was a tone so quick and clinical. Details were the only cure for her condition then, breaths hastening, every hair on her body raising all too discernably.

“Wh- What?”

“Bring your dad on the line, Peter,” She repeated herself, this time a little more firmly.

The line clacked and crackled, the device being passed over to the other man there.

“Hey, is thi-”

“Mr. Smith, where are you and Peter? I need the precise location shown on your car’s GPS.”

“GPS’ broken, Sonya. Has been for months now.”

“DAMN IT, YOU WERE ABLE TO REACH ME RIGHT? J-”

Sonya wiped the tiny rivulets of sweat off her face and started pacing again, more awake that she had ever been in her entire life. Sicker than she’d ever felt in the mornings so far.

“Mr. Smith… try. It. Again. And keep me on the line.”

“I-I will Sonya.”

Sonya already didn’t waste any time searching for her belongings, taking with her only what she needed for what would be a very fast drive to this freeway. A rustling could be heard from the speakers, Peter on the call now.

“Sonya, please. We will be fine, the search and rescue will be here before you even get here. What will you do then? How are you even going to reach us? The road is still sticky and actual tar right now. Stay pu-”

“SHUT THE FUCK UP… Alright? You don’t get to tell me what to do right now. You don’t know if they’ll even reach you in time and there’s more than enough time for me to reach wherever you are and back… Besides, your dad’s truck doesn’t have very good radiation shielding, only ours does.”

“Sonya… Even with that, it’ll still be at least five hundred x-rays of radiation when day comes. I don’t think Max could handle that.”

Sonya froze. Max. He’d used the name they’d whispered to each other in the dark, the name no one else knew. The sound of it on his lips now, as a weapon to stop her, made her see white.

“You don’t ge- You don’t get to use that to tell me not to come! Alright? How fucking dare you use him to make me stay here?! H-”

Nobody said a word for a while.

“Mateo. What’s your coordinates? Where are you guys at?”

“The GPS isn’t working… And the city’s become a fair bit different since the surface closed up. I don’t think you’ll know the way he-”

“Try me.”

It was the freeway they’d usually take to pass through the central business district. There were two voices fighting for her attention to get her not to leave but they were silenced with a single button. She was already in a radiation poncho, nearly out the door.

“Sonya?”

The voice was weak and sleepy. And it came from the physical space in the living room. A ghost had said them.

“Dad?”

“Sonya… where am I?”

“Dad, you’re home alright. Just stay put. And don’t go anywhere, I have to go no-”

“Sonya, where are you going?”

“Outside! Okay?! I have to go fast or else.”

“Sonya… Please stay. I don’t want to be alone.”

The words were glass and steel tempered well at the same time; the words were a father’s last sword and shield. One he held rubbing the fabric of the couch in trembling hands – like a soldier that traced the contours of a map.

Sonya was suddenly aware of everything besides the sights around the bunker. It smelt like piss-soaked diapers, the sound of documentary reruns on the television. And all of this before Max had even been born.

Day came. Only Sonya and Grigor remained.

September, the twenty-eighth was Sonya’s original due date; but as Autumn had, Max came early. His first cries punctured the solemnity.

Epilogue

Scissors snipped at strips of meat, a woman preparing the bird and laying it on plates for a drooling man and herself. In the background, was only the humming of the microwave that warmed a bottle of milk. It dinged as dinner began.

The woman had to lift both hands of the two boys that sat before their carer then. She said grace – and it was said well.

Dinner began with a kiss to both cheeks of the men left in the room, Sonya whispering to Max just two words.

1ot0zuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1ot0zuk/the_long_and_final_autumn/,The Long and Final Autumn,"“I’m glad that I’m able to walk you down the aisle, Sonya.”

“Yeah… I’m glad too, dad.”

The bride wore a ball-gown – patterned white, a long train, and the one she had her eyes on since she was in high school. She’d saved it for someone special, her one and only. And right now, it was only him that she saw in her eyes, standing at the altar. Curly dark hair and clean shaven, he wore a bright tuxedo, with that smile to boot. The violins played Wedding March and the guests – family and friends all stood with big smiles; they gave this couple their silent blessing, as the bride’s father had too.

It was an indoor venue. The windows are sealed well, with little sign left behind of ever being ones there. No expense was spared, it did well to stave off that heat from the outside with little noise.

The father's boots landed heavy and slow up the marble steps, the old man that held the hands of his daughter adjusting his leg to find surer footing on the ground. Bride and groom now faced each other – childhood friends, to highschool sweethearts, and soon to be husband and wife.

Deep and gruff, his voice tried hard to carry a weight of authority as he pulled himself close to the groom, “You take ca- You make sure you and Sonya live a happy life… You hear me, Peter?”

But no words came. None yet, anyways. The old man looked up and saw the man biting his lips, trying to push up a smile, eyes glossed over with tears. Peter gave a single sniff, then said, “That I will, sir. You take care of your own daughter just fine, yeah?”

And this time, tears welled up in the old man’s eyes. He couldn’t bear to let this young man see him cry then, and pulled him in closer, hugging him.

“I will, son… I will.”

It was the picture-perfect wedding. Young love triumphed, and none would object. None possibly could. They kissed, now spouses two in the month of March – under the first Autumn leaves that fell in Spring.

The sun was dipping now behind the distant buildings. Still, when the rooftop door opened to Sonya, a blast of prickling heat followed, with that glow of red in the sky. She pushed open the door with her shoulders, cake in one hand and an open umbrella in the other. She saw the young man sitting near the edge of the roof staring at that setting sun, unburdened by its rays. Speechless, both from the stunning beauty of the star of day, and the fact that Peter was sitting there without any protection, eating a slice of cake. He turned around, seeing the look on her face.

“Cooler today, ain’t it? Don’t even need an umbrella.”

“Mmhm.”

Sonya uses her feet to drag a brick to hold the door open, before propping her umbrella against the entrance there and entering with wine in her left hand. She takes a seat, leaning against the man. His hair felt nice – the softest and most comfortable.

“Is that all supposed to be for me?”

“Mmhm.”

“Cause you know you can’t drink with th-”

“I know. I know, it’s not that strong. And at least one of us should be drinking the wine we bought for this>’

She presses up against the cork, thumbing it open with a loud pop. Peter accepts the bottled red from her, taking his first sip. It was sweet like grape juice, and just how he liked it.

“I-is something wrong honey?”

Sonya moved a piece of cake around her plate without having taken a single bite out of it. She only snapped back to that present moment after hearing her husband’s words.

“Yeah… sorry Peter hah… It’s just the same thing I talked to you about the night we found out about the baby. I’m just a lil’ worried about some stuff, that’s all.”

“We’re gonna be just fine, Sonya. The state mandates that your employer has to give you paid maternity leave later on, even if you’re quite a new hire. Plus, we’ve got your dad, my dad, my mom, my sister… Point is, we’ll be just fine-”

“I know, I know,” she turns away just enough to hide the slight annoyance in her eyes. Sometimes, he didn’t know how exactly to help, “I guess… It’s just that I don’t know if I’m gonna be a good mother, is all. Some friends tell me that they feel this inexplicable joy and… I don’t think I’ve felt it, y’know?”

Peter pulls her in closer, resting his head on hers now before turning his torso to give her a small hug, which turned into him holding both her shoulders, “Well I’m scared too. Dunno how much it’s worth but I think I get less scared that I’m gonna be a father of a child that’s gonna have you as a mom. And you gotta know that I’m gonna be there, aight? Throughout the entire way. You know that, right?”

Sonya turns back. Some other times, he knew exactly what to say.

“I know.”

Sonya feels his hand come to rest on her belly. Hers follow suit. She wondered if the baby, even then, could feel the odd stillness in the air – like the world holding its breath.

“So… how drunk’s dad right now?”

“Oh,” Sonya says, blowing a raspberry, and making a drinking motion with her hand, “Already showing my uncles photos of his past camping trips.”

Peter laughed. And things would be good for a while.

The First Trimester

“Scientists are now saying that the early Autumn is actually a sign of warmer Summers to come. Let’s hear more fro- Psshhhhat- I voted for you because I thought you could stop the fires, Mr. President. I thought we’d finally get permanent homes.. WHERE ARE OUR HOMES MR- Psshhhhat- Kyrieee, Eleisooon. Let us join our hands in prayer, and pray for all of those stricken by the new droughts around the world. May God sa- Pssssheu- zzz”

The front door opens and Sonya turns the television off. She turns around from the sofa, “Did’ja manage to fit the crib in the car, Peter?”

He pokes his head in, from the side of the living room entrance, the box filled with planks and screws rattling around as he gives that goofy smile. Unsurprisingly, his light grey stubble gives it a goofier quality of sorts.

“You betcha. Got you those donuts you like so much too.”

“Thanks, Pete. Just leave them in the kitchen for now.”

A coat, a sweater, then scarf and beanie were tossed onto the other chair in the living room. Peter sits himself down on the chair with a tired sigh. He was soaked with sweat, and thus adjusted his seating to the edge of the leather.

“Where’s your dad?” Peter says, cracking open a can of Fanta, and taking a few sips from it, “didn’t see him in his room.”

“He’s closing shop downtown right now. Not exactly the best time to be running a sauna with… everything that’s happening.”

“Good on him. The guy could’ve retired a good while back. Poor man deserves a break.”

“Hey could you also get me o-”

Peter waves his hands in front of him, and takes out another cold can of soda with a silent ‘tadaa!’

“Thanks,” Sonya responds flatly, taking the can and cracking it open to drink, “I bet the kids in the Kindergarten love it when you do stuff like that, huh? Are your parents able to make it today?”

“My mom had to cancel because of some work stuff. Says she’ll come during the later half of dad’s trip though. Dad says he’ll be coming a bit later on tonight. The radiation keeps messing with his GPS or something.”

“I see.”

They both take a sip from their cans of drink. Their blinds and curtains were drawn open, allowing filtered light to pour in through the windows. The weather wasn’t hot per se. It was standard for autumn, and perhaps the freshest and cleanest air the two had breathed their entire life – clean as water in the ice caps. But the light was becoming poison. It distilled slower where the two lived, but still it grew in toxicity, day-by-day. Already, they’d given up on painting the walls outside, the paint discolouring under the afternoon sun.

“Hey, I’ll just put something on the telly while I go whip up something for us to eat, alright?”

“N-nah, that won’t be necessary I think. Just tune the old radio to something nice for yourself. I haven’t showered yet.”

The front door opens again, this time, slower steps enter. A voice called out from the entrance, “Finished up at the old place. Found some old photos as well… I think.” His voice was strained, and so Sonya rushed to the door, offering to help him carry his things. It’d only been two months, but not many would’ve guessed, looking at the guy.

His skin, still bronzed from days of work under the sun, now shone more clearly with the gloss of old age and splotches of white and purple that came with no real reason. The stocky and built frame he had on the day of the wedding had withered away into less meat, and just… less.

“This is why… dad.. I’ve told you many times to just… bring Peter along with you.”

The weight turns light as a third person takes the load off for both of them, carrying the box to the other room.

“W-when did you tell me that, now? You never said anything about that.”

“Just this morning, dad. I thought you were going to call him after you were done cleaning up the stall.”

“A-ah…”

The silence lasted for a few seconds before Sonya turned on the TV and changed the channel from the religious one, “Which one do you want to watch Pa?”

“The documentary one. My favourite program should be over already but the one that runs at six is pretty good. They’re showing reruns of Ocean Planet around this time I think.”

The screen flashed to a shot of a marine mammal – one of many that existed before the surface waters got too hot. This one grew bigger than the many large beasts of land and even the giant squid that emerged since those times before, drawn to the warmer waters above. Narrating it all was a deep and accented man’s voice, carrying with it the awe and reverence the world should have warranted from man. These things were enough already to set the old man into a comfortable haze, slouching back into the couch and watching the drifting currents on the screen. It was left to Sonya to take off the many layers of clothing he still kept on.

He uttered a small and perfunctory thank you to his daughter before continuing, “I usually hate these broadcasting services. All no-good peddlers of their agenda, fearmongers and the fakest shit you’ve had ever seen in your life. And I’ve lived for my fair share of those. But one thing these guys did right was stopping this show after the honourable man who voiced it all passed on. Hats off to them I say.”

“Hats off to them,” Sonya agrees.

The evening ran quick after Peter’s father came. He arrived in his jeep and emerged from the garage.

“Howdy! Is that Greg watching that show again?”

“Hey. All goes well, Mateo,” replied Grigor, to his neighbour of many years, from times passed, “Catch anything today?”

Mateo raises up a blue and white cooler box, “Squid again.”

They were friends in high school, friends in the military, and then friends again as fathers to the married couple. It was a small world in a big city. And it helped that half the apartments were left derelict and abandoned. They ate, talked and then reminisced for a while longer. The night held the day’s warmth and vigour well. The alcohol helped the two old men much to do this. The heat helped make it difficult for much rest to be found until some hours past midnight.

And then it was two in the morning. Sonya couldn’t sleep. She just found herself reviewing her case notes in bed. Paying clients paid their lawyers well to do a good job; they paid top dollar to warrant attorneys like Sonya just to simplify and shorten documents for them to read. Patience and attention were rare commodities today — they said it depended on whose parents had switched early from plastic to glass. Most men were stripped of finer intellectual faculties but really, it had been a whole fiasco overblown. There had even been people that warned of the bioaccumulation of microplastics to lead to the extinction of man. No, no, man didn’t go extinct, so things were still good.

Then it was three in the morning. Sonya shuts her laptop off, feeling her eyelids heavy at last. She had to stop herself from continuing. It was only the coughs of the old men in the other room that stirred her from her nods off.

She kept the glossy black device under her desk, catching sight of the glow that burnt into the night sky. It was a pretty glow, embers thrown into the atmosphere from the forests and fires of midtown. Sonya smiled. Really, dread was something only afforded to a people that were running out of time to fix a problem. Only tranquility was left to the people of this time. The Second Trimester

“Oh my god! Sonya! You’re still so thin, darling! You have got… to eat more,” the lady, equally tall and loud in a floral blouse with naturally curly hair dyed a light brown, started, “Is it him? Is it because Peter starves you? Just tell, m’kay? B’cause I’ve whooped his ass before and I’ll do it again. Lemme te-”

She trailed on for a good while. And she was certainly a very talkative woman. Her name was Donna. Everyone has that one aunt whom your mother takes you to shop with once or twice a year. Everyone but Peter. That aunt was his mother.

It was at the tail-end of Autumn now. The leaves that fell were gray and translucent. So was the dirty glass that hid the interior of the showrooms of rows upon rows of bunkers. They varied from the more affordable and functional one-room types that would protect you from the sun unveiled, to the slightly less dull mansionettes that ran for two or three floors, luxury where it could be found these days.

“How’s about this one now? Looks kind of like the old house, doesn’t it, son?”

The house Mateo pointed to had a concrete exterior, though it kept a thin lining of wood plastered on the inside. It looked quite homely. It even had a sloped ceiling and those open-layout built-in furniture. It made it look larger than it actually was.

“It does, pa. I don’t think rustic’s what we’re looking for though.”

Sonya was clinging to Peter’s side. Maybe it was just her, but she didn’t fancy shopping for housing nowadays. The National Department of Housing and Development and realtors assure the people that such enclosed layouts didn’t pose any dangers to the health of their occupants.

And maybe they were right. For years now, people have cloistered themselves in their houses, either living at work or working at home. Food no longer demanded one to step foot in the streets – for day found blistering heat from above, from the rays that had perforated the sky’s fine lining, while night felt that same heat come from cracked concrete skeletons and sticky tarmac. In truth, it had been like this even before the summers had gotten this bad. Ultraviolet showers gave you and your plants everything the sun could – the new normal, people called it. Sonya caressed the now visible bump that showed through her woolen sweater, looking at it. She wondered if her baby would ever get to see a first snow.

She whispered to Peter, “Hey, honey. I think I need to sit down somewhere for a bit.”

“S-should I come with?”

“You go on ahead.”

Sonya had only begun to walk away from the group when she felt Donna clasp her hands around her arm.

“Come on. Let’s you an’ me go together then, spend some girl time away from the boys, hmm?”

They found the display area for the recliner chairs and took their seats there. The store’s speaker systems were playing the amateur-ish voice of a young woman with a difficult accent repeating the deals they had on for the new pay-to-install insulant lining as they sat in silence for some time. Donna did so to give Sonya some rest. Sonya did so, having noticed that Donna already had her phone out with pictures of what she could only assume was yet another baby product. Those moments didn’t last for long, Donna shifting her chair closer to Sonya, and leaning in close to show her a photo of what looked like a small jar of cream.

“So what you’re gonna want to do is apply this over wh-”

Sonya snorted, and then began giggling, pulling her hand up to cover her mouth.

“Ah… I’m sorry dear. It is a bit weird for me to be showing you this he-”

“No… hahahah- No you’re perfectly good, Mrs Smith. And I’m sorry, Mrs Smith. It’s just you’re the first person whose gotten something for me, and not the baby.”

On her phone, she was showing an opaque white container of cream, labelled ‘Breastfeeding Ointment’, sealed with a metal lid.

“Ohh… so you were saying something about how to use it, is that right?”

“Yes, that’s right dear. So this is for after the pregnancy but I’d suggest stocking up now before things get too bad outside. What you’re gonna want to do is…”

They talked together about things, Donna sharing some stories Sonya hadn’t heard before during her own pregnancy with Peter.

“Y’know… I wish that you would just call me mum, after so many years.”

Sonya lets out a small hiss of air out of her nose, and smiled, staring down, “I know Peter does that for dad already but I think I’ve just gotten way to used to calling you and Mateo, Mr. and Mrs. Smith already.”

“Ahh know, ah know. Just sayin.”

The store hummed softly under fluorescent light, nearly empty now. Sonya was still staring at her shoes when she said, “You know you’re my mom, though.”

And this time, it was Donna’s turn to smile, letting out that sniffling laugh, nodding in response. And they let the moment hang for a bit there, before Donna spoke again, “How’s Greg holding up these days at home?”

“Oh… well I think he’s still doing fine. He helps around the house quite a bit still, though I am glad we made him close up shop when he did. He forgets the names of people he sees on television a lot of the time now though.”

Donna opened her mouth to say something but closed it, placing her hand on Sonya’s lap instead, rubbing it.

“You’re being very strong about all of this business y’know?”

“Yeah. Maybe not dad’s ex-wife but I do wish a lot of the time that he would have someone who connects with him better to accompany him on his worse days.”

“Ah know darling. Ah know.”

The three men came back not long after this. They’d done everything they came to the store to settle that day and were just about ready to head back home.

They pushed open the door to the airlock connected to the building. It smelt flatly of sweat and warehouse, Peter pulling open the locker to place the radiation poncho on Sonya as it was harder to fit on with the baby. She put on the mask and goggles on herself just fine. And then they left the building to the sheer temperature outside – to streets of barren trees of late fall.

They stepped out into the late evening. Though it wasn’t light that touched them anymore, no, it was something closer to memory. The Third Trimester

The three – Sonya, Grigor and Peter – sat at their couch in the living room. They waited, breaths bated, while they listened to snippets of the conversation the visiting Mateo was having with Donna on the phone. They could only hear his side of it all, and he had done a good job to hide the worry in it.

“I- I see. Yes, I still have my key to it. Have you checked the garage door? It’s closed right? You’re certain it’s closed… Alright then.”

The bunker had a rather minimalistic Scandinavian design. Light wooded browns complemented blue fabric furniture and curtains – ones that covered the false sunlight from the outside. It was only a little smaller than Grigor’s house. This was the house Sonya, Peter, and Grigor would live in and prepare for the baby boy that was soon to come a month from then. Mateo and Donna lived in a separate bunker, not too far from theirs, in case anything happened to any one of them, so they could help each other out.

Peter didn’t say the first words, for he’d already gone to his room. The folks in the living room heard him ruffling through the clothes on hangers in the wardrobe, no doubt looking for his radiation poncho. So Sonya was the first to speak, “Wh- What did she say? Is she fine right now?”

Mateo’s voice hung grim and low, the kind of gravel that filled the room, “She’s safe, Sonya. She’s in the garage of our bunker and well… It’s still night out.”

At this, some relief washed over Sonya’s face, her pupils no longer pinpricks. Her sigh was followed by Mateo continuing on, “But she let some young kid, a girl wearing a jacket I think… The girl asked for shelter from Donna when Donna was heading back to the bunker. Donna said all she did was ask her where her parents were. That sent the young girl into all sorts of panic, locking herself inside of the bunker, screaming that she didn’t want to be taken back to her father. She took Donna’s key inside with her.”

Sonya nodded, her mouth open, “O-okay. If Peter can’t make it back here from your place safely before dawn, please just tell him to stay at your place, okay? Grigor and I will be fine here for a day.”

Mateo nodded. His poncho was on the coat rack, and began to wear it. Peter came out of the room soon after, already in the silvery coat that reflected the yellow lights of the house in every direction. Sonya saw him packing items in his duffel bag, looking for that one thing he always misplaced somewhere in the house. Sonya saw herself moving to find it – the water bottle that was always in the top cabinet of the kitchen, and always somehow invisible to Peter – handing it to him. Sonya saw an opportunity for her to touch his hands with hers. Peter held it back. Her skin was smooth, and his skin soft with hair. Peter was the one to move his hand away first this time, a rare first, continuing to finish packing everything up for the excursion.

Sharp and red – alarms rang in dragged high notes as the button was pushed by Mateo to open the doors to the garage.

“Use the landline at their place to call me when you get there okay?”

“I will honey.”

“What are you gonna do with the girl?”

“Maybe nothing at all. Hopefully, she would’ve let Mom in by the time we get there.”

“Maybe.”

Peter hung close to Sonya, pressing himself against her belly as he kissed her for a good few seconds. He said something about them having more than four times the amount of time needed to get to the bunker, only an hour and a half away, and not to worry so much. The car engine started, its sporadic bursts of activity heard loud and clearly from the living room. The young father was about to leave, until he stopped at the door, hanging on the door frame.

“Hey, dad! Greg!”

At this, the man that sat in a grooved and stretchy singlet that sat on the sofa became lucid again, staring up to look at Peter. His face painted with a coat of confusion.

“You’ll take care of your daughter just fine until I get back, yeah?”

Nobody said anything for a few seconds. The car the only one that didn’t hold their breaths under the heavy air.

“I will, son. That I will.”

Peter’s face turned into a smile for the first time in an hour as he gave the wall of the living room two last smacks for good luck, “We’ll be off then. See you guys!”

“Remember to take your boots off before you get into their place! You always forget!”

And they were gone.

Sonya found herself pacing around the living room after taking out a book to read initially. The sound of the television could be heard behind her, the deep voice of an old and British knight narrating the hunt of the giant cats of the Serengeti – residents of an old house of cards, folded, waterlogged and burnt now all the same. They were made vagrants, doomed to humble artificial abodes, or made docile to “preserve biodiversity” in bunkers with hairless aliens.

These were the young days of a new kind of Summer. Tar and varnished wooding are made fuel under the daylight, and signals that combat the surface radiation come and go distorted and warped. Fall, Winter and Autumn are events as the Woolly Mammoth, Dodo and whales are – they all were – things made antiques. People were advised to weather the first five decades of the new era until all the major sources of “difficult fuel” have dried up, enabling folks to reinhabit the surface assuming scientists finish up their discovery of a machine that would stop radioactive decay. This, this and certainly nothing more, had to be the new normal. All things considered, it wasn’t that bad, because they still could be so much worse. The friendly and honeyed words that men on the cable television said that they’d actually been lucky to have been afforded the luxuries of a nuclear energy generator that could be fitted into a storeroom. They were lucky that the miracle tonics and tisanes of the future could save them from the slew of new monsters that emerged from the ice-caps and tiny plastic knives that laced every water source. It might have just been indulgence then, that Sonya found herself wondering if her child would ever grow to see the blue sky of day in his entire life.

Sonya didn’t know how long she’d been ruminating to herself, the still stagnant nighttime lighting of the bunker giving no indicator. She was only snapped out of it when she had heard her father start to reminisce again, for the first time in weeks at this point, “I served in the Annexation War of Mongolia… before I settled down and had a daughter in the United States.”

Sonya knew about this one already. He set it up this same specific way each time, leading into the story about how he learned to make milk tea the same way the Mongols did – mixing tea leaves with ox milk, instead of water. She liked it though, and so she listened. He continued, voice interrupted by his phlegm-ruined throat.

“We came in… from the northern border near Baikal. It took some time before we saw it, but we saw it- it-... all of it was beautiful.”

The story was different.

“Golden stalks of grass that carpeted rolling hills and flats as far as the eye could see. All with no tree, nor sea in sight. And above it, lied the clearest, and bluest sky any man could have ever laid their eyes on. It was midday, and so the sun was up high but it didn’t make light of that deepness. There were no oceans there, but the sky still held the reflection of one. Blue skies! As far as my eyes could take me.”

He recalled all of this, his dried eyes wetting with tears – hands rubbing the fabric of the sofa as if it were a map he was reading. Sonya was the first to speak next.

“Sir?”

“Yeah?”

“May I have your name again? I must have forgotten it.”

“It’s uhh…”

Grigor paused there, his voice trailing off as he stared into the distance that didn’t exist – straight into the wooden floor. He looked up again, some shock in his eyes now as he said, “W-wh- why are you crying young lady?”

“I-it’s nothing. Uhh… You were telling me about your daughter before I think.. Maybe we could continue with that?”

“No, nonsense. I’ll tell you all about her later. Maybe we could talk about what’s bothering you first, young lady.”

Sonya knew she shouldn’t try this line of talk right now. Her mouth said differently.

“I’m… I’m going to become a mother soon, you see? And things are kind of scary right now.”

“You seem like a perfectly capable young lady. I mean… looking at your place, it looks like you’re doing quite well for yourself.”

“I was, I- I really was. I worked in a law firm before, and it fetched good money I suppose. I don’t think any of what I learnt translated over here at home though. That’s more of my husband’s thing.”

“Well! Well there you have it. It sounds like you have yourself a nice husband right? Good family too?”

“Only the best I could hope for. But I have to take care of my dad as well… And he’s sick.”

“I can’t speak for you, but it sounds like you’re going to be okay then, right? Your dad raised a fine young lady. I trust you’ll do a fine job taking care of him with your family.”

“Mmhm.”

“O-oh no… You’re crying again. Did I say something wrong?”

“No, no you didn’t. I think I’m just being unreasonably worried right now… my husband’s gone on a trip and I’m worried something will happen to him on the way there. I don’t know what I’m gonna do then.”

“Mother? Siblings?”

“It’ll just be me and my dad..”

The tears couldn’t stop then. They came, choked and interrupted only by stiff inhales through her mucus-caked nostrils. The old man just sat there, the tightest pang of pity in his heart. He didn’t know what he could do to help this nice stranger. This went on for several minutes.

“I’m just being stupid. He should be reaching there in less than an hour. I-”

She stopped, and quickly turned to hold her breath and wipe the tears off her face. Grigor’s face had blanked out again at that time. He was staring into a wall this time.

An hour and a half had passed, then two. Eventually, it was only two hours till dawn. Then the call finally came. The exhausted woman drifted off in her recliner, woken up by the thin strip of red light that flashed urgently from the wall, signalling an incoming call. She’d tripped over the coffee table, almost waking up Grigor in the process trying to get to the button. She pressed the button, and heard nothing but heavy breathing for the first few seconds. Her smile vanished.

“H-hey did we manage to connect to you guys?”

“Peter?”

He sounded muffled and somewhat tired, though it was happiness that Sonya heard cut through, if only for one moment.

“Sonya, you have to listen to me okay. S-stay where you are. We’re going to be okay, you hear? We’ve contacted the local search and rescue guys and they’re saying they’re gonna make it here so-”

“Wait… What the fuck happened, Peter?”

Only his breathing punctuated the silence.

“... We ran across a patch of melted tarmac. Our truck got stuck, and I don’t think we’re able to make the jump to the side of the freeway. You have to li-”

“Bring Mateo on the line.”

Her voice cut off what was bound to be another round of rambling. Hers was a tone so quick and clinical. Details were the only cure for her condition then, breaths hastening, every hair on her body raising all too discernably.

“Wh- What?”

“Bring your dad on the line, Peter,” She repeated herself, this time a little more firmly.

The line clacked and crackled, the device being passed over to the other man there.

“Hey, is thi-”

“Mr. Smith, where are you and Peter? I need the precise location shown on your car’s GPS.”

“GPS’ broken, Sonya. Has been for months now.”

“DAMN IT, YOU WERE ABLE TO REACH ME RIGHT? J-”

Sonya wiped the tiny rivulets of sweat off her face and started pacing again, more awake that she had ever been in her entire life. Sicker than she’d ever felt in the mornings so far.

“Mr. Smith… try. It. Again. And keep me on the line.”

“I-I will Sonya.”

Sonya already didn’t waste any time searching for her belongings, taking with her only what she needed for what would be a very fast drive to this freeway. A rustling could be heard from the speakers, Peter on the call now.

“Sonya, please. We will be fine, the search and rescue will be here before you even get here. What will you do then? How are you even going to reach us? The road is still sticky and actual tar right now. Stay pu-”

“SHUT THE FUCK UP… Alright? You don’t get to tell me what to do right now. You don’t know if they’ll even reach you in time and there’s more than enough time for me to reach wherever you are and back… Besides, your dad’s truck doesn’t have very good radiation shielding, only ours does.”

“Sonya… Even with that, it’ll still be at least five hundred x-rays of radiation when day comes. I don’t think Max could handle that.”

Sonya froze. Max. He’d used the name they’d whispered to each other in the dark, the name no one else knew. The sound of it on his lips now, as a weapon to stop her, made her see white.

“You don’t ge- You don’t get to use that to tell me not to come! Alright? How fucking dare you use him to make me stay here?! H-”

Nobody said a word for a while.

“Mateo. What’s your coordinates? Where are you guys at?”

“The GPS isn’t working… And the city’s become a fair bit different since the surface closed up. I don’t think you’ll know the way he-”

“Try me.”

It was the freeway they’d usually take to pass through the central business district. There were two voices fighting for her attention to get her not to leave but they were silenced with a single button. She was already in a radiation poncho, nearly out the door.

“Sonya?”

The voice was weak and sleepy. And it came from the physical space in the living room. A ghost had said them.

“Dad?”

“Sonya… where am I?”

“Dad, you’re home alright. Just stay put. And don’t go anywhere, I have to go no-”

“Sonya, where are you going?”

“Outside! Okay?! I have to go fast or else.”

“Sonya… Please stay. I don’t want to be alone.”

The words were glass and steel tempered well at the same time; the words were a father’s last sword and shield. One he held rubbing the fabric of the couch in trembling hands – like a soldier that traced the contours of a map.

Sonya was suddenly aware of everything besides the sights around the bunker. It smelt like piss-soaked diapers, the sound of documentary reruns on the television. And all of this before Max had even been born.

Day came. Only Sonya and Grigor remained.

September, the twenty-eighth was Sonya’s original due date; but as Autumn had, Max came early. His first cries punctured the solemnity.

Epilogue

Scissors snipped at strips of meat, a woman preparing the bird and laying it on plates for a drooling man and herself. In the background, was only the humming of the microwave that warmed a bottle of milk. It dinged as dinner began.

The woman had to lift both hands of the two boys that sat before their carer then. She said grace – and it was said well.

Dinner began with a kiss to both cheeks of the men left in the room, Sonya whispering to Max just two words.

Hey... uh, hi. You're... Yeah, you're already here. I thought I was early or something. Haha. Um yeah, this place looked nice online, right? I've never actually been here before though. The pictures made it look... cozy I guess.

You found it okay though? That's good. I was kinda worried you'd get lost or something. You said you're bad with directions, haha.

\[sips drink\]

Oh my god this is... wow that's really sweet. Like drinking candy. I probably should've asked for less syrup, ugh...

\[sound of phone unlocking\]

Sorry, I just... I told my friend I'd text her when I got here. She's like.. checking in on me. Just in case this turns into a murder or something, haha. No offense.

Anyway. Sooo... you said you were really into isekai stuff, right? You mentioned that in your messages...

Haha yeah, I used to watch anime a lot when I was younger... Like... a lot a lot. It was kinda my whole personality for a while, honestly. I don't really have the time anymore though...

\[awkward pause\]

It's kinda cold in here. I should've brought a hoodie or something.

\[long silence\]

So, um... what do you usually do on weekends?

Ohh, that's cool. Yeah. That's cool. I used to do stuff like that too...

\[long pause\]

You talked a lot more online, you know? I mean, that's not a bad thing. It's just... you seemed more confident I guess?

Hah, I get it though. In person is different.

\[longer pause, briefly checks phone\]

Sorry, I was just checking something. My mom texted... she's being annoying. She always thinks I'm out doing drugs or something stupid like that. I told her I was just meeting someone for coffee but she still freaks out.

\[another pause\]

Sooo, umm... how long have you been into anime?

Oh wow, that long? Damn, that's some dedication.

I used to be obsessed with Elfen Lied. Like, totally obsessed. That one was insane, haha. I think the last one I watched was... mmm... actually I don't even remember...

\[pause\]

Sooo... do you do this a lot? Like... messaging girls on Discord until they agree to meet up in person? Heh.

Oh, uh, yeah, I did see that one you sent last night. It was cute. Like stupid cute.

\[short silence, background chatter more noticeable for a moment\]

You're quieter than I expected. I mean, online you were always sending these like... giant paragraphs and stuff, haha. You don't have to be nervous or anything.

No, it's fine. I just noticed.

\[taps nails against cup\]

So hey... why did you DM me back then anyway?

\[light laugh, then silence that is slightly too long\]

Yeah...

\[short silence, sound of a phone unlocking\]

Sorry, I was just...

\[locks it again\]

...checking the time.

\[sets phone down\]

Anyway, you mentioned you write fanfics? Like on Reddit or whatever?

That's cool. I used to write a lot when I was like twelve. Like, dumb stories, haha. Super embarrassing stuff.

You ever go back and read your old stuff and just like... want to die from cringe? Like, 'wow, I really thought this was deep'...

Yeah, same.

\[another pause, sips drink again\]

Ughh, I think I ordered the wrong thing. This is like pure syrup, it's way too sweet.

You okay drinking yours? Mine tastes like melted candy...

\[pause\]

Anyway ummm, what were we talking about again? Oh, right... anime, yeah.

So you said you liked Chainsaw Man right? I remember because I used to be really into it when it first came out. Like, I had a Makima keychain and everything. Haha, don't judge me.

You were talking about that one where the guy gets hit by a truck and turns into slime? Yeah. I watched like a couple of episodes of that one. It was fine.

\[brief silence, background noise becomes more noticeable\]

You can be really quiet, you know. I mean, it's fine. It's just... when it gets quiet like this I never know what to say...

Oh. Okay.

\[pause\]

Sorry, I'm just... I don't know. I thought it'd be easier to talk.

You said you liked texting better right? Yeah... I get that. I'm kinda bad at texting though. Like, I forget to reply all the time.

You probably noticed already.

\[soft pause, checks phone again, this time longer\]

Sorry. I just... yeah.

\[quietly, almost to herself\]

You really did message a lot...

\[buzzing sound, glances down at phone again\]

Ah, that's my friend. She's done already.

She's just waiting outside...

\[soft pause, forces a small smile\]

Anyway, um... it was nice meeting you. Really.

\[pause\]

I'll text you later okay? Just... don't take it personally if I forget or whatever... I'm really bad at texting...

Thanks for the drink...

Take care alright?

“Yeah… I’m glad too, dad.”

The bride wore a ball-gown – patterned white, a long train, and the one she had her eyes on since she was in high school. She’d saved it for someone special, her one and only. And right now, it was only him that she saw in her eyes, standing at the altar. Curly dark hair and clean shaven, he wore a bright tuxedo, with that smile to boot. The violins played Wedding March and the guests – family and friends all stood with big smiles; they gave this couple their silent blessing, as the bride’s father had too.

It was an indoor venue. The windows are sealed well, with little sign left behind of ever being ones there. No expense was spared, it did well to stave off that heat from the outside with little noise.

The father's boots landed heavy and slow up the marble steps, the old man that held the hands of his daughter adjusting his leg to find surer footing on the ground. Bride and groom now faced each other – childhood friends, to highschool sweethearts, and soon to be husband and wife.

Deep and gruff, his voice tried hard to carry a weight of authority as he pulled himself close to the groom, “You take ca- You make sure you and Sonya live a happy life… You hear me, Peter?”

But no words came. None yet, anyways. The old man looked up and saw the man biting his lips, trying to push up a smile, eyes glossed over with tears. Peter gave a single sniff, then said, “That I will, sir. You take care of your own daughter just fine, yeah?”

And this time, tears welled up in the old man’s eyes. He couldn’t bear to let this young man see him cry then, and pulled him in closer, hugging him.

“I will, son… I will.”

It was the picture-perfect wedding. Young love triumphed, and none would object. None possibly could. They kissed, now spouses two in the month of March – under the first Autumn leaves that fell in Spring.

The sun was dipping now behind the distant buildings. Still, when the rooftop door opened to Sonya, a blast of prickling heat followed, with that glow of red in the sky. She pushed open the door with her shoulders, cake in one hand and an open umbrella in the other. She saw the young man sitting near the edge of the roof staring at that setting sun, unburdened by its rays. Speechless, both from the stunning beauty of the star of day, and the fact that Peter was sitting there without any protection, eating a slice of cake. He turned around, seeing the look on her face.

“Cooler today, ain’t it? Don’t even need an umbrella.”

“Mmhm.”

Sonya uses her feet to drag a brick to hold the door open, before propping her umbrella against the entrance there and entering with wine in her left hand. She takes a seat, leaning against the man. His hair felt nice – the softest and most comfortable.

“Is that all supposed to be for me?”

“Mmhm.”

“Cause you know you can’t drink with th-”

“I know. I know, it’s not that strong. And at least one of us should be drinking the wine we bought for this>’

She presses up against the cork, thumbing it open with a loud pop. Peter accepts the bottled red from her, taking his first sip. It was sweet like grape juice, and just how he liked it.

“I-is something wrong honey?”

Sonya moved a piece of cake around her plate without having taken a single bite out of it. She only snapped back to that present moment after hearing her husband’s words.

“Yeah… sorry Peter hah… It’s just the same thing I talked to you about the night we found out about the baby. I’m just a lil’ worried about some stuff, that’s all.”

“We’re gonna be just fine, Sonya. The state mandates that your employer has to give you paid maternity leave later on, even if you’re quite a new hire. Plus, we’ve got your dad, my dad, my mom, my sister… Point is, we’ll be just fine-”

“I know, I know,” she turns away just enough to hide the slight annoyance in her eyes. Sometimes, he didn’t know how exactly to help, “I guess… It’s just that I don’t know if I’m gonna be a good mother, is all. Some friends tell me that they feel this inexplicable joy and… I don’t think I’ve felt it, y’know?”

Peter pulls her in closer, resting his head on hers now before turning his torso to give her a small hug, which turned into him holding both her shoulders, “Well I’m scared too. Dunno how much it’s worth but I think I get less scared that I’m gonna be a father of a child that’s gonna have you as a mom. And you gotta know that I’m gonna be there, aight? Throughout the entire way. You know that, right?”

Sonya turns back. Some other times, he knew exactly what to say.

“I know.”

Sonya feels his hand come to rest on her belly. Hers follow suit. She wondered if the baby, even then, could feel the odd stillness in the air – like the world holding its breath.

“So… how drunk’s dad right now?”

“Oh,” Sonya says, blowing a raspberry, and making a drinking motion with her hand, “Already showing my uncles photos of his past camping trips.”

Peter laughed. And things would be good for a while.

The First Trimester

“Scientists are now saying that the early Autumn is actually a sign of warmer Summers to come. Let’s hear more fro- Psshhhhat- I voted for you because I thought you could stop the fires, Mr. President. I thought we’d finally get permanent homes.. WHERE ARE OUR HOMES MR- Psshhhhat- Kyrieee, Eleisooon. Let us join our hands in prayer, and pray for all of those stricken by the new droughts around the world. May God sa- Pssssheu- zzz”

The front door opens and Sonya turns the television off. She turns around from the sofa, “Did’ja manage to fit the crib in the car, Peter?”

He pokes his head in, from the side of the living room entrance, the box filled with planks and screws rattling around as he gives that goofy smile. Unsurprisingly, his light grey stubble gives it a goofier quality of sorts.

“You betcha. Got you those donuts you like so much too.”

“Thanks, Pete. Just leave them in the kitchen for now.”

A coat, a sweater, then scarf and beanie were tossed onto the other chair in the living room. Peter sits himself down on the chair with a tired sigh. He was soaked with sweat, and thus adjusted his seating to the edge of the leather.

“Where’s your dad?” Peter says, cracking open a can of Fanta, and taking a few sips from it, “didn’t see him in his room.”

“He’s closing shop downtown right now. Not exactly the best time to be running a sauna with… everything that’s happening.”

“Good on him. The guy could’ve retired a good while back. Poor man deserves a break.”

“Hey could you also get me o-”

Peter waves his hands in front of him, and takes out another cold can of soda with a silent ‘tadaa!’

“Thanks,” Sonya responds flatly, taking the can and cracking it open to drink, “I bet the kids in the Kindergarten love it when you do stuff like that, huh? Are your parents able to make it today?”

“My mom had to cancel because of some work stuff. Says she’ll come during the later half of dad’s trip though. Dad says he’ll be coming a bit later on tonight. The radiation keeps messing with his GPS or something.”

“I see.”

They both take a sip from their cans of drink. Their blinds and curtains were drawn open, allowing filtered light to pour in through the windows. The weather wasn’t hot per se. It was standard for autumn, and perhaps the freshest and cleanest air the two had breathed their entire life – clean as water in the ice caps. But the light was becoming poison. It distilled slower where the two lived, but still it grew in toxicity, day-by-day. Already, they’d given up on painting the walls outside, the paint discolouring under the afternoon sun.

“Hey, I’ll just put something on the telly while I go whip up something for us to eat, alright?”

“N-nah, that won’t be necessary I think. Just tune the old radio to something nice for yourself. I haven’t showered yet.”

The front door opens again, this time, slower steps enter. A voice called out from the entrance, “Finished up at the old place. Found some old photos as well… I think.” His voice was strained, and so Sonya rushed to the door, offering to help him carry his things. It’d only been two months, but not many would’ve guessed, looking at the guy.

His skin, still bronzed from days of work under the sun, now shone more clearly with the gloss of old age and splotches of white and purple that came with no real reason. The stocky and built frame he had on the day of the wedding had withered away into less meat, and just… less.

“This is why… dad.. I’ve told you many times to just… bring Peter along with you.”

The weight turns light as a third person takes the load off for both of them, carrying the box to the other room.

“W-when did you tell me that, now? You never said anything about that.”

“Just this morning, dad. I thought you were going to call him after you were done cleaning up the stall.”

“A-ah…”

The silence lasted for a few seconds before Sonya turned on the TV and changed the channel from the religious one, “Which one do you want to watch Pa?”

“The documentary one. My favourite program should be over already but the one that runs at six is pretty good. They’re showing reruns of Ocean Planet around this time I think.”

The screen flashed to a shot of a marine mammal – one of many that existed before the surface waters got too hot. This one grew bigger than the many large beasts of land and even the giant squid that emerged since those times before, drawn to the warmer waters above. Narrating it all was a deep and accented man’s voice, carrying with it the awe and reverence the world should have warranted from man. These things were enough already to set the old man into a comfortable haze, slouching back into the couch and watching the drifting currents on the screen. It was left to Sonya to take off the many layers of clothing he still kept on.

He uttered a small and perfunctory thank you to his daughter before continuing, “I usually hate these broadcasting services. All no-good peddlers of their agenda, fearmongers and the fakest shit you’ve had ever seen in your life. And I’ve lived for my fair share of those. But one thing these guys did right was stopping this show after the honourable man who voiced it all passed on. Hats off to them I say.”

“Hats off to them,” Sonya agrees.

The evening ran quick after Peter’s father came. He arrived in his jeep and emerged from the garage.

“Howdy! Is that Greg watching that show again?”

“Hey. All goes well, Mateo,” replied Grigor, to his neighbour of many years, from times passed, “Catch anything today?”

Mateo raises up a blue and white cooler box, “Squid again.”

They were friends in high school, friends in the military, and then friends again as fathers to the married couple. It was a small world in a big city. And it helped that half the apartments were left derelict and abandoned. They ate, talked and then reminisced for a while longer. The night held the day’s warmth and vigour well. The alcohol helped the two old men much to do this. The heat helped make it difficult for much rest to be found until some hours past midnight.

And then it was two in the morning. Sonya couldn’t sleep. She just found herself reviewing her case notes in bed. Paying clients paid their lawyers well to do a good job; they paid top dollar to warrant attorneys like Sonya just to simplify and shorten documents for them to read. Patience and attention were rare commodities today — they said it depended on whose parents had switched early from plastic to glass. Most men were stripped of finer intellectual faculties but really, it had been a whole fiasco overblown. There had even been people that warned of the bioaccumulation of microplastics to lead to the extinction of man. No, no, man didn’t go extinct, so things were still good.

Then it was three in the morning. Sonya shuts her laptop off, feeling her eyelids heavy at last. She had to stop herself from continuing. It was only the coughs of the old men in the other room that stirred her from her nods off.

She kept the glossy black device under her desk, catching sight of the glow that burnt into the night sky. It was a pretty glow, embers thrown into the atmosphere from the forests and fires of midtown. Sonya smiled. Really, dread was something only afforded to a people that were running out of time to fix a problem. Only tranquility was left to the people of this time. The Second Trimester

“Oh my god! Sonya! You’re still so thin, darling! You have got… to eat more,” the lady, equally tall and loud in a floral blouse with naturally curly hair dyed a light brown, started, “Is it him? Is it because Peter starves you? Just tell, m’kay? B’cause I’ve whooped his ass before and I’ll do it again. Lemme te-”

She trailed on for a good while. And she was certainly a very talkative woman. Her name was Donna. Everyone has that one aunt whom your mother takes you to shop with once or twice a year. Everyone but Peter. That aunt was his mother.

It was at the tail-end of Autumn now. The leaves that fell were gray and translucent. So was the dirty glass that hid the interior of the showrooms of rows upon rows of bunkers. They varied from the more affordable and functional one-room types that would protect you from the sun unveiled, to the slightly less dull mansionettes that ran for two or three floors, luxury where it could be found these days.

“How’s about this one now? Looks kind of like the old house, doesn’t it, son?”

The house Mateo pointed to had a concrete exterior, though it kept a thin lining of wood plastered on the inside. It looked quite homely. It even had a sloped ceiling and those open-layout built-in furniture. It made it look larger than it actually was.

“It does, pa. I don’t think rustic’s what we’re looking for though.”

Sonya was clinging to Peter’s side. Maybe it was just her, but she didn’t fancy shopping for housing nowadays. The National Department of Housing and Development and realtors assure the people that such enclosed layouts didn’t pose any dangers to the health of their occupants.

And maybe they were right. For years now, people have cloistered themselves in their houses, either living at work or working at home. Food no longer demanded one to step foot in the streets – for day found blistering heat from above, from the rays that had perforated the sky’s fine lining, while night felt that same heat come from cracked concrete skeletons and sticky tarmac. In truth, it had been like this even before the summers had gotten this bad. Ultraviolet showers gave you and your plants everything the sun could – the new normal, people called it. Sonya caressed the now visible bump that showed through her woolen sweater, looking at it. She wondered if her baby would ever get to see a first snow.

She whispered to Peter, “Hey, honey. I think I need to sit down somewhere for a bit.”

“S-should I come with?”

“You go on ahead.”

Sonya had only begun to walk away from the group when she felt Donna clasp her hands around her arm.

“Come on. Let’s you an’ me go together then, spend some girl time away from the boys, hmm?”

They found the display area for the recliner chairs and took their seats there. The store’s speaker systems were playing the amateur-ish voice of a young woman with a difficult accent repeating the deals they had on for the new pay-to-install insulant lining as they sat in silence for some time. Donna did so to give Sonya some rest. Sonya did so, having noticed that Donna already had her phone out with pictures of what she could only assume was yet another baby product. Those moments didn’t last for long, Donna shifting her chair closer to Sonya, and leaning in close to show her a photo of what looked like a small jar of cream.

“So what you’re gonna want to do is apply this over wh-”

Sonya snorted, and then began giggling, pulling her hand up to cover her mouth.

“Ah… I’m sorry dear. It is a bit weird for me to be showing you this he-”

“No… hahahah- No you’re perfectly good, Mrs Smith. And I’m sorry, Mrs Smith. It’s just you’re the first person whose gotten something for me, and not the baby.”

On her phone, she was showing an opaque white container of cream, labelled ‘Breastfeeding Ointment’, sealed with a metal lid.

“Ohh… so you were saying something about how to use it, is that right?”

“Yes, that’s right dear. So this is for after the pregnancy but I’d suggest stocking up now before things get too bad outside. What you’re gonna want to do is…”

They talked together about things, Donna sharing some stories Sonya hadn’t heard before during her own pregnancy with Peter.

“Y’know… I wish that you would just call me mum, after so many years.”

Sonya lets out a small hiss of air out of her nose, and smiled, staring down, “I know Peter does that for dad already but I think I’ve just gotten way to used to calling you and Mateo, Mr. and Mrs. Smith already.”

“Ahh know, ah know. Just sayin.”

The store hummed softly under fluorescent light, nearly empty now. Sonya was still staring at her shoes when she said, “You know you’re my mom, though.”

And this time, it was Donna’s turn to smile, letting out that sniffling laugh, nodding in response. And they let the moment hang for a bit there, before Donna spoke again, “How’s Greg holding up these days at home?”

“Oh… well I think he’s still doing fine. He helps around the house quite a bit still, though I am glad we made him close up shop when he did. He forgets the names of people he sees on television a lot of the time now though.”

Donna opened her mouth to say something but closed it, placing her hand on Sonya’s lap instead, rubbing it.

“You’re being very strong about all of this business y’know?”

“Yeah. Maybe not dad’s ex-wife but I do wish a lot of the time that he would have someone who connects with him better to accompany him on his worse days.”

“Ah know darling. Ah know.”

The three men came back not long after this. They’d done everything they came to the store to settle that day and were just about ready to head back home.

They pushed open the door to the airlock connected to the building. It smelt flatly of sweat and warehouse, Peter pulling open the locker to place the radiation poncho on Sonya as it was harder to fit on with the baby. She put on the mask and goggles on herself just fine. And then they left the building to the sheer temperature outside – to streets of barren trees of late fall.

They stepped out into the late evening. Though it wasn’t light that touched them anymore, no, it was something closer to memory. The Third Trimester

The three – Sonya, Grigor and Peter – sat at their couch in the living room. They waited, breaths bated, while they listened to snippets of the conversation the visiting Mateo was having with Donna on the phone. They could only hear his side of it all, and he had done a good job to hide the worry in it.

“I- I see. Yes, I still have my key to it. Have you checked the garage door? It’s closed right? You’re certain it’s closed… Alright then.”

The bunker had a rather minimalistic Scandinavian design. Light wooded browns complemented blue fabric furniture and curtains – ones that covered the false sunlight from the outside. It was only a little smaller than Grigor’s house. This was the house Sonya, Peter, and Grigor would live in and prepare for the baby boy that was soon to come a month from then. Mateo and Donna lived in a separate bunker, not too far from theirs, in case anything happened to any one of them, so they could help each other out.

Peter didn’t say the first words, for he’d already gone to his room. The folks in the living room heard him ruffling through the clothes on hangers in the wardrobe, no doubt looking for his radiation poncho. So Sonya was the first to speak, “Wh- What did she say? Is she fine right now?”

Mateo’s voice hung grim and low, the kind of gravel that filled the room, “She’s safe, Sonya. She’s in the garage of our bunker and well… It’s still night out.”

At this, some relief washed over Sonya’s face, her pupils no longer pinpricks. Her sigh was followed by Mateo continuing on, “But she let some young kid, a girl wearing a jacket I think… The girl asked for shelter from Donna when Donna was heading back to the bunker. Donna said all she did was ask her where her parents were. That sent the young girl into all sorts of panic, locking herself inside of the bunker, screaming that she didn’t want to be taken back to her father. She took Donna’s key inside with her.”

Sonya nodded, her mouth open, “O-okay. If Peter can’t make it back here from your place safely before dawn, please just tell him to stay at your place, okay? Grigor and I will be fine here for a day.”

Mateo nodded. His poncho was on the coat rack, and began to wear it. Peter came out of the room soon after, already in the silvery coat that reflected the yellow lights of the house in every direction. Sonya saw him packing items in his duffel bag, looking for that one thing he always misplaced somewhere in the house. Sonya saw herself moving to find it – the water bottle that was always in the top cabinet of the kitchen, and always somehow invisible to Peter – handing it to him. Sonya saw an opportunity for her to touch his hands with hers. Peter held it back. Her skin was smooth, and his skin soft with hair. Peter was the one to move his hand away first this time, a rare first, continuing to finish packing everything up for the excursion.

Sharp and red – alarms rang in dragged high notes as the button was pushed by Mateo to open the doors to the garage.

“Use the landline at their place to call me when you get there okay?”

“I will honey.”

“What are you gonna do with the girl?”

“Maybe nothing at all. Hopefully, she would’ve let Mom in by the time we get there.”

“Maybe.”

Peter hung close to Sonya, pressing himself against her belly as he kissed her for a good few seconds. He said something about them having more than four times the amount of time needed to get to the bunker, only an hour and a half away, and not to worry so much. The car engine started, its sporadic bursts of activity heard loud and clearly from the living room. The young father was about to leave, until he stopped at the door, hanging on the door frame.

“Hey, dad! Greg!”

At this, the man that sat in a grooved and stretchy singlet that sat on the sofa became lucid again, staring up to look at Peter. His face painted with a coat of confusion.

“You’ll take care of your daughter just fine until I get back, yeah?”

Nobody said anything for a few seconds. The car the only one that didn’t hold their breaths under the heavy air.

“I will, son. That I will.”

Peter’s face turned into a smile for the first time in an hour as he gave the wall of the living room two last smacks for good luck, “We’ll be off then. See you guys!”

“Remember to take your boots off before you get into their place! You always forget!”

And they were gone.

Sonya found herself pacing around the living room after taking out a book to read initially. The sound of the television could be heard behind her, the deep voice of an old and British knight narrating the hunt of the giant cats of the Serengeti – residents of an old house of cards, folded, waterlogged and burnt now all the same. They were made vagrants, doomed to humble artificial abodes, or made docile to “preserve biodiversity” in bunkers with hairless aliens.

These were the young days of a new kind of Summer. Tar and varnished wooding are made fuel under the daylight, and signals that combat the surface radiation come and go distorted and warped. Fall, Winter and Autumn are events as the Woolly Mammoth, Dodo and whales are – they all were – things made antiques. People were advised to weather the first five decades of the new era until all the major sources of “difficult fuel” have dried up, enabling folks to reinhabit the surface assuming scientists finish up their discovery of a machine that would stop radioactive decay. This, this and certainly nothing more, had to be the new normal. All things considered, it wasn’t that bad, because they still could be so much worse. The friendly and honeyed words that men on the cable television said that they’d actually been lucky to have been afforded the luxuries of a nuclear energy generator that could be fitted into a storeroom. They were lucky that the miracle tonics and tisanes of the future could save them from the slew of new monsters that emerged from the ice-caps and tiny plastic knives that laced every water source. It might have just been indulgence then, that Sonya found herself wondering if her child would ever grow to see the blue sky of day in his entire life.

Sonya didn’t know how long she’d been ruminating to herself, the still stagnant nighttime lighting of the bunker giving no indicator. She was only snapped out of it when she had heard her father start to reminisce again, for the first time in weeks at this point, “I served in the Annexation War of Mongolia… before I settled down and had a daughter in the United States.”

Sonya knew about this one already. He set it up this same specific way each time, leading into the story about how he learned to make milk tea the same way the Mongols did – mixing tea leaves with ox milk, instead of water. She liked it though, and so she listened. He continued, voice interrupted by his phlegm-ruined throat.

“We came in… from the northern border near Baikal. It took some time before we saw it, but we saw it- it-... all of it was beautiful.”

The story was different.

“Golden stalks of grass that carpeted rolling hills and flats as far as the eye could see. All with no tree, nor sea in sight. And above it, lied the clearest, and bluest sky any man could have ever laid their eyes on. It was midday, and so the sun was up high but it didn’t make light of that deepness. There were no oceans there, but the sky still held the reflection of one. Blue skies! As far as my eyes could take me.”

He recalled all of this, his dried eyes wetting with tears – hands rubbing the fabric of the sofa as if it were a map he was reading. Sonya was the first to speak next.

“Sir?”

“Yeah?”

“May I have your name again? I must have forgotten it.”

“It’s uhh…”

Grigor paused there, his voice trailing off as he stared into the distance that didn’t exist – straight into the wooden floor. He looked up again, some shock in his eyes now as he said, “W-wh- why are you crying young lady?”

“I-it’s nothing. Uhh… You were telling me about your daughter before I think.. Maybe we could continue with that?”

“No, nonsense. I’ll tell you all about her later. Maybe we could talk about what’s bothering you first, young lady.”

Sonya knew she shouldn’t try this line of talk right now. Her mouth said differently.

“I’m… I’m going to become a mother soon, you see? And things are kind of scary right now.”

“You seem like a perfectly capable young lady. I mean… looking at your place, it looks like you’re doing quite well for yourself.”

“I was, I- I really was. I worked in a law firm before, and it fetched good money I suppose. I don’t think any of what I learnt translated over here at home though. That’s more of my husband’s thing.”

“Well! Well there you have it. It sounds like you have yourself a nice husband right? Good family too?”

“Only the best I could hope for. But I have to take care of my dad as well… And he’s sick.”

“I can’t speak for you, but it sounds like you’re going to be okay then, right? Your dad raised a fine young lady. I trust you’ll do a fine job taking care of him with your family.”

“Mmhm.”

“O-oh no… You’re crying again. Did I say something wrong?”

“No, no you didn’t. I think I’m just being unreasonably worried right now… my husband’s gone on a trip and I’m worried something will happen to him on the way there. I don’t know what I’m gonna do then.”

“Mother? Siblings?”

“It’ll just be me and my dad..”

The tears couldn’t stop then. They came, choked and interrupted only by stiff inhales through her mucus-caked nostrils. The old man just sat there, the tightest pang of pity in his heart. He didn’t know what he could do to help this nice stranger. This went on for several minutes.

“I’m just being stupid. He should be reaching there in less than an hour. I-”

She stopped, and quickly turned to hold her breath and wipe the tears off her face. Grigor’s face had blanked out again at that time. He was staring into a wall this time.

An hour and a half had passed, then two. Eventually, it was only two hours till dawn. Then the call finally came. The exhausted woman drifted off in her recliner, woken up by the thin strip of red light that flashed urgently from the wall, signalling an incoming call. She’d tripped over the coffee table, almost waking up Grigor in the process trying to get to the button. She pressed the button, and heard nothing but heavy breathing for the first few seconds. Her smile vanished.

“H-hey did we manage to connect to you guys?”

“Peter?”

He sounded muffled and somewhat tired, though it was happiness that Sonya heard cut through, if only for one moment.

“Sonya, you have to listen to me okay. S-stay where you are. We’re going to be okay, you hear? We’ve contacted the local search and rescue guys and they’re saying they’re gonna make it here so-”

“Wait… What the fuck happened, Peter?”

Only his breathing punctuated the silence.

“... We ran across a patch of melted tarmac. Our truck got stuck, and I don’t think we’re able to make the jump to the side of the freeway. You have to li-”

“Bring Mateo on the line.”

Her voice cut off what was bound to be another round of rambling. Hers was a tone so quick and clinical. Details were the only cure for her condition then, breaths hastening, every hair on her body raising all too discernably.

“Wh- What?”

“Bring your dad on the line, Peter,” She repeated herself, this time a little more firmly.

The line clacked and crackled, the device being passed over to the other man there.

“Hey, is thi-”

“Mr. Smith, where are you and Peter? I need the precise location shown on your car’s GPS.”

“GPS’ broken, Sonya. Has been for months now.”

“DAMN IT, YOU WERE ABLE TO REACH ME RIGHT? J-”

Sonya wiped the tiny rivulets of sweat off her face and started pacing again, more awake that she had ever been in her entire life. Sicker than she’d ever felt in the mornings so far.

“Mr. Smith… try. It. Again. And keep me on the line.”

“I-I will Sonya.”

Sonya already didn’t waste any time searching for her belongings, taking with her only what she needed for what would be a very fast drive to this freeway. A rustling could be heard from the speakers, Peter on the call now.

“Sonya, please. We will be fine, the search and rescue will be here before you even get here. What will you do then? How are you even going to reach us? The road is still sticky and actual tar right now. Stay pu-”

“SHUT THE FUCK UP… Alright? You don’t get to tell me what to do right now. You don’t know if they’ll even reach you in time and there’s more than enough time for me to reach wherever you are and back… Besides, your dad’s truck doesn’t have very good radiation shielding, only ours does.”

“Sonya… Even with that, it’ll still be at least five hundred x-rays of radiation when day comes. I don’t think Max could handle that.”

Sonya froze. Max. He’d used the name they’d whispered to each other in the dark, the name no one else knew. The sound of it on his lips now, as a weapon to stop her, made her see white.

“You don’t ge- You don’t get to use that to tell me not to come! Alright? How fucking dare you use him to make me stay here?! H-”

Nobody said a word for a while.

“Mateo. What’s your coordinates? Where are you guys at?”

“The GPS isn’t working… And the city’s become a fair bit different since the surface closed up. I don’t think you’ll know the way he-”

“Try me.”

It was the freeway they’d usually take to pass through the central business district. There were two voices fighting for her attention to get her not to leave but they were silenced with a single button. She was already in a radiation poncho, nearly out the door.

“Sonya?”

The voice was weak and sleepy. And it came from the physical space in the living room. A ghost had said them.

“Dad?”

“Sonya… where am I?”

“Dad, you’re home alright. Just stay put. And don’t go anywhere, I have to go no-”

“Sonya, where are you going?”

“Outside! Okay?! I have to go fast or else.”

“Sonya… Please stay. I don’t want to be alone.”

The words were glass and steel tempered well at the same time; the words were a father’s last sword and shield. One he held rubbing the fabric of the couch in trembling hands – like a soldier that traced the contours of a map.

Sonya was suddenly aware of everything besides the sights around the bunker. It smelt like piss-soaked diapers, the sound of documentary reruns on the television. And all of this before Max had even been born.

Day came. Only Sonya and Grigor remained.

September, the twenty-eighth was Sonya’s original due date; but as Autumn had, Max came early. His first cries punctured the solemnity.

Epilogue

Scissors snipped at strips of meat, a woman preparing the bird and laying it on plates for a drooling man and herself. In the background, was only the humming of the microwave that warmed a bottle of milk. It dinged as dinner began.

The woman had to lift both hands of the two boys that sat before their carer then. She said grace – and it was said well.

Dinner began with a kiss to both cheeks of the men left in the room, Sonya whispering to Max just two words.

1ot0wp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkArchive/comments/1ot0wp5/a_missing_hiker_call_changed_how_i_take_night/,A Missing Hiker Call Changed How I Take Night Shifts Forever.,"I don’t take solo night calls anymore.

On paper, I’m still a ranger with the state parks department. My badge says “Senior Ranger,” my contract says backcountry specialist, but after what happened last October I started volunteering for every maintenance shift that keeps me within sight of a road and a crowd.

There’s an incident report for it. It’s in a binder behind the front desk, third shelf down, page for October 19th. If you flipped to it, this is what you’d see:

“Ranger Carson Hale responded to an overdue hiker call from the Cottonwood Wash Trailhead, returned at 07:12 hours, report of possible animal activity, ongoing missing persons case.”

That’s the neat version. The version for supervisors and lawyers and anyone who needs closure that fits on a line.

Everything else I’m putting here because I can’t sleep when it’s quiet anymore.

That day started like every other shoulder-season Thursday.

I was at the station doing the usual nonsense: answering the same questions about whether we have bears (“Yes”), whether we have wolves (“No”), and whether their dog can be off-leash (“Also no, I don’t care how friendly he is”). I filled out a maintenance request for the busted faucet by the campground, dug through the lost and found for a kid’s left sandal, and tried not to think too hard about how much of my job is being an underpaid hall monitor with a radio.

We’re a small park wedged between national forest and reservation land—a chunk of canyons and piñon, dry creekbeds and sandstone ledges. You drive east from town, past the Family Dollar and the last Circle K, hit the brown sign for COTTONWOOD WASH STATE PARK, and then it’s seven more miles on a two-lane that turns to washboard dirt if you miss the turn.

October’s our almost-quiet month. Cool days, cold nights, tourists thinning out but not gone. Enough people to keep the lights on, not enough to justify overtime.

Around 6:30 p.m., I’d just poured the last of the coffee from the station pot into my dented stainless thermos. It was already lukewarm and tasted like metal and burnt beans, but I’m not picky. I screwed the lid on, told myself I’d reheat it later, and we both know I wasn’t going to.

I was halfway through the shift-change checklist when dispatch crackled over the base station.

“Unit Three, you still at the station?”

I thumbed my handheld. “Yeah, go ahead.”

“Got a call from county sheriff. Overdue hiker. Vehicle registered to a Matthew Klein, age thirty-four. Parked at Cottonwood Wash trailhead since 09:17 this morning. No contact. Girlfriend called it in about twenty minutes ago.”

I glanced at the wall clock. 19:42. Outside the office window the sky was a strip of dull purple over the ridge, sun already gone. Morales—night shift—was still tied up on a poaching complaint up in the north sector. She’d told me over the radio an hour earlier she was “knee-deep in camo idiots and shell casings.”

“All right,” I said. “I’ll check the lot, see if he signed in. Maybe he just took the loop slow.”

“You sure?” Dispatch sounded tired but concerned. “You’d be solo out there, Three.”

“Just a quick sweep to the first marker,” I said. “I won’t go stupid deep.”

The lie came out easy. It always does when you tell yourself you’re just checking.

I keep my pack under the desk, half out of habit and half because if I put it away somewhere “proper” I’ll forget something. First aid kit, trauma shears, SAM splint, extra water, tarp, a coil of paracord I always call a bowline when I show the junior ranger kids, even though it’s not. I know it’s not. My brain grabs the wrong knot every single time I’ve got an audience.

I slung the pack over one shoulder, grabbed the SAR radio and a printed map from the rack even though I can draw the trails from memory, and signed myself out on the board:

CARSON – COTTONWOOD WASH – OVERDUE HIKER – 19:50

The drive out felt longer than usual.

Headlights carved through sage and rabbitbrush, catching the odd jackrabbit frozen in the beam before it bolted. The pavement gave up about four miles out; the truck bounced as tires hit hard-packed washboard. I passed the old CCC bathhouse ruins on the left—a crumbling line of stone and a rusted interpretive sign. I always think it’s WPA work until I kneel down and see the nail head stamped “1937 CCC” and remember I’ve had that exact thought before.

Nobody else was out there. No other vehicles. No porch lights on the distant ranch houses. No campfire glow. Just the road and the dark shapes of mesas hemming it in.

The handheld rode on the passenger seat by my thermos, volume low, dispatch chatter a tinny murmur. The coffee had gone from lukewarm to cold; I took a swallow anyway out of habit and grimaced.

I pulled into the Cottonwood Wash trailhead lot at 20:03.

One vehicle sat there: a blue Subaru Outback with a rental barcode sticker on the rear window. Thin coat of dust, no tracks behind the tires. Hood cold when I put my hand on it.

I swung the truck so the headlights washed over the bulletin board and trailhead sign. The board was the usual mess—faded fire danger meter, “WATCH FOR RATTLESNAKES” poster, a missing-dog flyer someone had taped up three months ago. The wind barely moved. The cottonwoods along the dry creekbed might as well have been painted on.

I grabbed my flashlight, clicked it on, and walked over to the sign-in box. We don’t force people to log in and out, but we encourage it. Sometimes it saves hours. Sometimes it doesn’t help at all.

The sheet inside was almost full. I flipped past the earlier entries until I saw it.

NAME: MATTHEW KLEIN
TIME OUT: 09:30
DESTINATION: LOOP TO RIDGE OVERLOOK
EXPECTED RETURN: BY 5

I don’t know why that “BY 5” snagged in my head. People usually scribble “afternoon” or don’t bother. The way he wrote it made it look like a promise. Like he’d told someone, I’ll be out by five, I swear.

“Unit Three at Cottonwood trailhead,” I said into the radio. “Subject’s vehicle present, name matches sign-in. No sign of subject at lot.”

“Copy, Three,” dispatch answered. “You requesting secondary unit?”

I looked out at the trail sign, the dark mouth of the path dropping into the wash. The part of my brain that likes checklists and procedures whispered you should wait. The other part—that loud SAR part that starts writing worst-case scenarios the second a hiker is late—was already picturing a broken ankle at the first switchback, a guy sitting in the dark slowly getting hypothermic because I didn’t want to lose sleep.

“Negative for now,” I said. “I’ll hike to first mile marker, see if I pick up his tracks. If he went out at nine, he should’ve been back before dark.”

“Copy. Check in every thirty.”

I clipped the radio back to my vest, tightened my pack straps. The air had that in-between temperature where you know the real cold is waiting just out of sight.

The trail into Cottonwood Wash starts as a gentle slope of packed sand and loose rock, then drops into the creekbed after a quarter mile. In daylight it’s a casual stroll. At night, even with a good light, your world shrinks to a tunnel—the circle in front of your boots, and then nothing.

I stepped past the trailhead sign and felt that shift I always do. The parking lot behind me became a rectangle of lesser darkness. Ahead was just the beam and the unknown.

I picked up his tracks before the first switchback.

Decent hiking boots, not fashion ones. Deep tread, maybe size ten. The sandy stretches between rock patches held his prints like ink. You get used to reading people in their tracks—whether they walked or jogged, how heavy their pack might’ve been, whether they were sightseeing or marching.

For the first half mile, Matthew Klein read like a normal guy out for a long loop. Center of the trail, steady stride, no dragging, no weird pauses. Nothing that said panic. Nothing that said intoxicated or injured.

The canyon was colder than the lot. The rock walls held the cool and let heat bleed off fast. My breath fogged in the beam in short bursts. Somewhere up on the rim, a coyote yipped once and then shut up. I waited to hear the others answer. They didn’t.

At the first mile marker—a battered wooden post with “1” carved into it and a strip of reflective tape peeling away—I checked my watch. 20:26.

“Unit Three,” I said into the radio. “At mile marker one. Subject’s trail still visible and consistent. Continuing toward Ridge Overlook.”

Static hissed. Then dispatch’s voice slid through, muffled and thin.

“—opy, Three. Signal’s get—ing spotty. Check—n at Ridge.”

“Say again?” I turned the volume up.

More static. For a second, I heard my own voice loop back at me, tinny and warped:

“—ridge… ridge—”

That happens sometimes in the canyons too—radios bouncing off rock faces, catching their own echo. I told myself that’s all it was, thumbed the side of the radio like that would make a difference, and kept going.

Half a mile past the marker, the story in the dirt changed.

It started small: a single step off the packed center of the trail, a deeper imprint like he’d stumbled and caught himself. Then another. Then a run of short, choppy steps that veered toward the right, toward the darker line of brush hugging the wash wall.

I swept my light ahead, slowly. The beam caught on a long scuff where something heavy had slid sideways, gouging a shallow trench in the sand.

Matthew’s boot print overlapped the end of it. Toes dug in like he’d pushed, hard.

I crouched, fingers brushing the disturbed sand. The trench went both ways—as if something had been dragged, stopped, and then dragged again.

Beside it, half softened by wind, was another print.

My first thought was coyote. Then big dog. Then… something gave up.

It was a bare foot.

It wasn’t right, though. The toes were too long, with an odd curve to them. The arch of the foot dipped narrow and deep, like it belonged to someone who’d never worn shoes in their life, but the heel print was wrong too, set in a way that didn’t match the weight distribution I’m used to seeing. The deepest point wasn’t at the ball or heel, but along the outer edge, as if whoever it belonged to rolled their weight there.

I felt my stomach tighten.

People hike barefoot. I’ve seen older locals do it, and I’ve seen social media idiots do it so they can say they did. But you don’t see bare human feet out here at 11 p.m. in October.

My light found a second bare footprint farther along, cutting across the trail at an angle. Then a third, half on rock, half in sand. They moved with a strange, loping stride, parallel to Matthew’s for a while, then angling closer.

I swallowed.

“Could be… could be nothing,” I said out loud, which is dumb, but people talk to themselves alone in the field more than they admit. “Could be some kid messing around. Could be erosion. Could be me reading shadows.”

The wind at my back shifted. For a second, just a second, it brought a smell with it that didn’t belong out here: sour and coppery and hot, like a butcher shop that hadn’t been cleaned right. Then it was gone.

The hair on my arms rose under my sleeves.

I swept my light around: canyon walls, brush, the path behind me. Nothing but rock and dark.

“Matthew,” I called, voice louder than before. “Ranger service! If you can hear me, yell or bang on something!”

My words traveled up and out, bounced back thinner, shredded by distance. No other sound answered.

I followed the tracks.

They left the main trail at a break in the rock wall I’ve walked past a hundred times without thinking. The wash narrows there, and there’s a slope of loose rock leading up to a gap between two big sandstone blocks. You can see it on the topo map as a little side drainage, but nobody puts it on the brochures.

Matthew’s boots had climbed it in a hurry—slips, slides, toe digs like he was scrambling. The bare prints followed with a steadier, almost lazy step, each toe splayed in the gravel like they were gripping.

Protocol says: don’t leave the marked trail on a solo night search unless there’s imminent danger. That sentence was in the back of my head. So was the DA’s voice from a training video about “unnecessary exposure to risk.”

But walking away when the tracks clearly went up that slope would mean if he was lying broken twenty yards beyond it, I’d chosen my own safety over his life. Try clocking out with that in your chest.

So I went.

The scree rolled under my boots with every step, tiny rockfalls rattling downslope. Dust got in my teeth. I kept my light low, checking each place I planned to put my weight.

At the top, the gap funneled into a narrow side canyon I’d only ever glanced at in daylight. A vertical slit of shadow between red walls, choked with scrub oak, fallen branches, and old flood debris.

At night, it felt… wrong is the only word that fits.

The air changed as soon as I stepped through. The faint breeze from the main wash died. The temperature dropped a couple degrees. Even the starlight thinned out; the walls leaned over just enough to box it in.

Matthew’s boots and the bare prints ran nearly side by side now, sometimes overlapping. Here and there, small darker spots dotted the sand. I knew what they were before I reached down and touched one with a gloved fingertip.

Blood looks almost black in flashlight beams.

“Matthew!” I yelled again, throat tighter this time. “If you’re hurt, shout! I’m here to help you!”

Something answered me.

Not words. Not quite.

It rose up from somewhere ahead and above, a thin keening that sounded like it had been fed through too many speakers in a row and come out damaged. It wasn’t a coyote. It wasn’t the wind. It had the cadence of a sob but none of the shape.

It bounced off the canyon walls and came back in fragments. My skin crawled.

I told myself it could be wind tearing past a crack in the rock. Could be an injured animal. Could be anything besides the thing my brain was edging toward.

My body didn’t care what label I put on it. My feet were already moving toward the sound.

I don’t know how far that side canyon goes in daylight. At night, distance just stops meaning anything. My watch said I walked another ten minutes. My lungs and legs said thirty.

Around a bend, the walls peeled back into a bowl-shaped clearing, maybe thirty yards across. The floor was a mess of scrub, deadfall, and old flood lines. In the center, half-collapsed and furred with lichen, was a ring of stone.

It wasn’t one of our fire rings. Too big, too tall, too deliberate. Knee to chest high slabs of rock, set in a near-perfect circle, all leaning inward just a little, like they’d been shoved and decided not to fall after all. Some had shallow marks carved into them, so worn you couldn’t tell if they’d ever meant anything.

I stopped on the edge of it, pulse thudding in my throat.

My light picked up a bright slash of color against one upright stone. For a second, my brain said trash. Then it clicked.

A torn scrap of neon orange fabric. High-vis nylon, the kind every REI mannequin wears in October. It was stuck to the rough rock with something dried and dark. The edges were ragged, as if it had been chewed or shredded by hand.

Near it, at the base of the stone, the sand showed a wide smear, as if something heavy had been dragged and pivoted there. Matthew’s boot prints walked up to that spot and ended.

The bare prints didn’t. They were everywhere. In the dust, on the flat stones, circling the ring, doubling back over themselves. Some were deeper, the toes clawed in like whatever had made them had pushed hard, maybe to leap.

That broken keening sound rose again.

This time it came from above me.

I tilted my head back, lifting the light.

At first my brain tried to make it a tree branch. A human shadow. Anything.

Something clung to a narrow ledge maybe ten feet above the ring. Pale limbs bent at angles that made my joints ache just looking. It was pressed flat to the rock in a way that didn’t seem like it should be possible. My beam slid over it once, twice, before the details assembled into the idea of a body.

Its head turned before the rest of it did, jerking around quick and then stopping too suddenly. The eyes caught my light and reflected it back, flat and bright, like marbles.

It wore part of a jacket. Neon orange, ripped almost in half down the center. One sleeve hung empty and shredded.

The torso under it was narrow. Too narrow. Ribs showed under skin that looked too tight, but in other places the skin bunched and folded like it had extra it didn’t know what to do with.

The face—

I still can’t quite hold the face in my head. When I try, I get pieces.

There was a jaw. Eye sockets. Cheekbones. But everything was a little off, like someone had assembled a face from memory and gotten the spacing wrong. The nose sat too high. One eye socket was wider than the other. The mouth sloped—higher on one side, lower on the other—as if whoever had cut it hadn’t drawn the line straight.

Its lips moved.

That thin, wrong sobbing noise came out, but the mouth barely opened. The sound didn’t match the shape.

For a few seconds we just stared at each other: my light pinning it on the ledge, it staring back with its head tilted at the same angle as mine.

Then it let go.

It dropped straight down into the stone circle. No scramble, no preparing for impact. It just released and hit in a crouch. I waited for the thump, for gravel scattering.

Nothing. Or if there was a sound, I didn’t hear it through the thudding in my ears.

Up close, the smell hit me like a wall. Wet fur, copper, and something else—old earth maybe, the way a cellar smells when it’s been shut up for too long.

I don’t remember deciding to unclasp my holster, but suddenly my handgun was in my hand, my fingers slick on the grip.

Training says you back away slowly, keep your weapon up, keep your voice calm. You don’t talk to unknown animals like they’re people.

I heard myself say, “Matthew?” anyway.

The thing’s head twitched to the side. The movement was too sharp, like someone had cut a frame out of its animation. Its eyes flicked down to the gun, then back to my face.

Its mouth worked. The sound coming out changed. Less like a broken sob, more like… someone trying to push air through a throat that wasn’t built right.

“Matt—” it said.

The word came out crushed and stretched, like someone had taken a recording and pulled the waveform. The “t” was barely there; the vowel dragged too long. It sounded like someone trying to talk underwater.

“I… I can help you,” I heard myself stammer. My voice sounded like it belonged to someone else. “Just… just stay where you are.”

I took a step back.

It took one forward.

The bare feet left clean prints in the dust between the stones. Up close, the skin there looked wrong too. Too thin and shiny in some spots, thick and almost scaly in others. On one ankle there was a faint line, a seam where the texture changed abruptly from something smooth and human to something rougher, like animal hide.

My flashlight beam shook. The stones cast hard-edged shadows over its body, hiding pieces of it and then showing them again in a stuttering rhythm as I tried to keep the light steady.

Somewhere behind me, far out in the main wash, the wind started up again. It slid around the corner of the canyon and over the bowl, cold and thin on the sweat at the back of my neck.

“Stop,” I said, raising the gun. “Don’t come any closer. I’m not kidding.”

The thing’s jaw flexed. Its lips peeled back a fraction too far, exposing teeth that were mostly the right shape and size but sat just a little off, one turned, one slightly higher than the rest. The skin at the corners of its mouth tore as it stretched, hairline cracks opening and leaking something dark that wasn’t the bright fresh red I expected.

The keening cut off.

The silence that dropped in its place was heavy in a way air shouldn’t be.

Then, very clearly, it said:

“Help.”

Not like someone begging.

Like someone testing a word they’d practiced.

I’d love to tell you I fired.

That I put two rounds center mass, that it dropped, that we hauled a body out and tagged it and sent it off to a lab and now I can point to a report and say “This is what that was.”

Instead, the part of me that has nothing to do with training—the old part, the prey-animal part—took over.

I turned and ran.

The next few minutes exist in my memory like a series of still photos. My boots hitting the canyon floor. My pack slamming between my shoulders. My flashlight beam jerking over rocks and dead branches and the mouths of side cracks.

Behind me, something moved. At first there was a noise like someone pulling themselves free from deep mud, a wet suction sound. Then the patter of feet.

More than two. Faster than I wanted to believe anything on two legs could move on that terrain.

I didn’t look back. I knew if I did my brain would freeze and my body would follow.

The narrow part of the side canyon came up too fast. I clipped my shoulder on one wall, bounced off the other, skinning my knuckles. Pain flared bright and stupid and somehow helped, because it made everything feel real again.

The main wash opened ahead in a slice of slightly lighter dark. The strip of sky above got wider. Stars were just pinpricks between canyon rims, but they were there.

My radio exploded with static against my chest.

“—son? Carson, you copy? We lost you on three, are you—”

“Three!” I yelled, no call-sign discipline left. “Unit Three, I am in Cottonwood side canyon, I’ve encountered—” I had to swallow to get the next words out. “Encountered something, possible subject, unknown animal, I am retreating, requesting immediate—”

Static swallowed the rest. The radio screeched in my ear. For a second, under the noise, I heard another voice—my own, or something mimicking it—repeat “unknown” back at me, stretched and warped.

Behind me, closer than I wanted to know, that broken voice called out.

“Help—help—Car—”

It said my name like it was chewing it.

I don’t remember deciding to slow down. I do remember my knee blowing up with pain as I misjudged a step and my right foot skidded on loose gravel. I went down hard. Something in my knee popped and the world went white around the edges.

I grabbed a juniper branch and used it to haul myself up. My leg screamed. The smart move would’ve been to stop, get my bearings, maybe find cover.

I kept moving.

You can’t sprint blind through a canyon and expect to survive. Every instinct screamed run as fast as you can. The rest of me knew if I broke into a full panicked scramble, I’d miss a turn and go off into a side ravine or over a ledge.

So I forced myself to do the thing I always tell new rangers in training: “Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.” Or however that saying actually goes. It feels like garbage when something is chasing you, but it keeps you alive.

“Watch the trail,” I muttered, breath ragged. “Landmarks. You know this place. You’ve been here a hundred times.”

The first mile marker came into view like a hallucination, reflective tape winking in my beam. If I’d had spare oxygen I probably would’ve laughed.

“Halfway,” I told myself. “Just halfway. Keep going.”

Something moved at the edge of my light, up on the slope.

I swung the beam toward it.

For a second I thought the juniper trunks were playing tricks on me. Then it stepped out from behind one.

It stood on the slope above the trail, maybe twenty yards away. The torn orange of the jacket glowed faintly against its chest. Its limbs looked longer than they had in the stone circle, joints set at slightly different angles, like the act of moving had rearranged them.

Its head was cocked. Its eyes didn’t glow like an animal’s this time. They just… absorbed the light. Too still. Too intent.

We stared at each other for one, two heartbeats.

Then it moved.

Not toward me.

Parallel.

It began to walk the contour line, up on the slope, matching my position as I started down-trail again. Same pace, same distance. Every time I flicked the light that way, it was there, just outside the center of the beam.

I’ve watched mountain lions shadow people before. I’ve seen coyotes trot along a ridge, keeping a hunter in sight. This was like that, and not like that at all. There was no curious tilt, no animal caution. It felt… clinical. Like it was observing.

Like it’d decided running me down wasn’t as interesting as seeing what I’d do.

I kept my eyes mostly on the trail, checking every few seconds that it was still there and not suddenly closer. My heart hammered. My knee ached with every step. The urge to bolt full-out almost shook my teeth.

Morales’s voice came back to me out of nowhere—us at the picnic table behind the station on a dead afternoon, her rolling a cigarette between her fingers, talking about the stories her grandmother used to tell.

“Stuff out there that walks on two legs and four, and you don’t say the name,” she’d said. “You don’t look at it if you can help it. You sure as hell don’t talk to it. If it knows you know, that’s when you’ve got a problem.”

I’d made some dumb joke about already having enough to worry about with tourists.

I didn’t feel like laughing now.

I didn’t talk. I didn’t raise the radio again. I didn’t shoot.

The trail curved left, then right. The rectangle of open sky that meant the trailhead lot was close crept into view in front of me, pale compared to the canyon.

Above me, the thing stopped.

I looked up before I could stop myself.

It stood at the very edge of the slope, toes almost over the drop. In my light, its eyes had gone reflective again, picking up just enough glow to look wrong.

Its chest rose and fell once.

Then it opened its mouth.

The sound that came out wasn’t a scream the way you think of a scream. It was a steady, high, piercing tone, a sound so sharp it made the fillings in my molars ache. It didn’t rise or fall; it just held, like a test tone in your inner ear.

Underneath it, I heard something else.

Layered. Fainter. A murmur that might have been voices stacked on top of each other, like a crowd recorded from too far away. Some sounded like they were crying, some like they were laughing, but none of the emotion matched the tone. It was all wrong.

The world narrowed to that noise and the rectangle of the trailhead lot ahead.

My legs did the choosing for me. I ran.

The tone cut off midstream, like someone had yanked a cable. The sudden silence was almost a physical hit.

I sprinted the last stretch, my knee protesting with every jolt. Adrenaline did what ibuprofen can’t.

Then I was out.

I burst into the parking lot like I’d stepped through a door. The truck, the pit toilet, the bullet-riddled “NO SHOOTING” sign—everything ordinary and stupid and real—appeared all at once.

My flashlight beam slammed into the side of the blue Subaru, bounced to the bulletin board, swung over the hood of my truck.

My thermos was still on the seat where I’d left it, silver catching the light. For some reason that almost undid me more than anything else.

The radio at my shoulder clicked.

“Three? Carson? You copy? We lost you for a good ten minutes there.”

My knees finally gave out.

I dropped onto the dirt by the truck, one hand catching the bumper to keep myself from faceplanting. The radio dug into my chest where the harness had shifted, the antenna jabbing under my jaw. My boot knocked the thermos off the seat when I leaned in; it hit the floorboard with a dull thunk I felt in my teeth.

“Three,” I gasped. “At trailhead. I am at the lot. Subject not found. Unknown animal in area. I repeat, unknown animal, aggressive behavior. Request backup. Lots of backup.”

I wasn’t proud of how that last bit came out.

“Copy, Three,” dispatch said, clearly exhaling into the mic. “Morales is en route. County deputies notified. ETA twenty to twenty-five. Stay in your vehicle. Do not re-enter the trail.”

“Affirmative,” I said, and it came out more like a wheeze than a word.

I hauled myself upright, using the truck’s side mirror. My reflection looked worse than I felt—sweat plastered dark hair to my forehead, a smear of blood on one knuckle, dust all up my pants, eyes wide.

The Subaru sat silent and patient.

For reasons I didn’t examine too closely right then, I walked over to the driver’s side and cupped my hands to peer inside. The door was locked. Through the glass I could see a rental agreement on the passenger seat with the logo from a Phoenix airport rental place, a half-empty Arrowhead water bottle, and a dog-eared Rand McNally atlas folded open to northern Arizona.

On the back seat was an orange jacket. Or what was left of it.

The main body of it had been stuffed in there in a hurry, still zipped. Both sleeves were shredded, long diagonal tears running from cuff to shoulder. The nylon was stiff and dark in patches. Someone had tried to wipe it off and given up. The drying made it pucker.

I stared at it for long enough that Morales’s headlights coming up the road made me jump.

I didn’t tell Morales everything that night.

I told her I’d followed the subject’s tracks to an unmarked side canyon, heard what I thought was an injured person, found blood and torn clothing and signs of a struggle. I told her something large had shadowed me on the way out, that I hadn’t seen it clearly, that it might have been a mountain lion acting strange.

She looked at my face for a second longer than was comfortable, then nodded once.

“Okay,” she said. “Animal. Fine. You’re limping. You’re not going back in.”

The deputies pulled in behind her, doors slamming, radios chirping. Their floodlights turned the trailhead into a stage. I watched them fan out with rifles and spotlights, young, confident, joking under their breath because that’s how you keep nerves down.

We ran a full search the next day. Dogs, volunteers, every ranger we could spare. The sun was bright, the sky cloudless. The side canyon looked smaller in daylight, its shadows shallow.

We found the stone ring. We found the blood. We found more of the jacket jammed into a rock crack like someone had tried to hide it.

We didn’t find Matthew.

The dogs didn’t like the circle. They’d approach to about ten feet, then balk and whine, hackles up. One of the deputies joked about “bad vibes.” Morales didn’t laugh.

The official story settled on “probable animal predation.” The report lists cougar as the likely culprit with one of those cover-your-ass lines: “Though no conclusive physical evidence of the animal was recovered, behavior and sign are consistent with known predation events.”

If you read the report, it sounds tidy. Guy goes hiking, meets big cat, doesn’t come home. Happens more than people think.

The messy parts stayed in my head.

His girlfriend came out twice over the next month.

The first time, she met with the sheriff, nodded through all the phrases—“ongoing investigation,” “low probability,” “we’ll keep you updated.” The second time, she drove out alone in a dusty Corolla and stood at the trailhead for a long time, just looking at the sign.

I was coming off a patrol and didn’t want to bother her. She came over to me instead.

“Were you the ranger on call?” she asked.

“Yeah,” I said. “Carson.”

She shook my hand. Grip tight, like it was the only thing keeping her upright.

“Matt’s… he likes to push things,” she said, staring at the bulletin board. “Always has. But he’s not stupid. He told me he’d be out before dark. He texted me from the lot.”

“He signed out ‘by five,’” I said, then wished I hadn’t. It sounded petty out loud.

She nodded once like that hurt. “That’s him. Little promises.”

She pulled something from her bag—a scrap of paper, folded small—and pinned it to the corner of the corkboard with a thumbtack she’d brought. Her hands were shaking.

Later, after she drove off, I went to see what it said.

Three words, in uneven handwriting:

IT SPARED ME. UNDERSTAND?

For a second my brain just shrugged. Then it sorted through its filing cabinet and pulled out a memory from months before.

A different call. Different landscape. Central Idaho, snowmelt below a slide path. We found a man standing in water up to his waist, lips almost blue, pants shredded, no boots. He refused food, refused to give a name, just stared at the tent wall and repeated the same line over and over.

“It spared me. It spared me. It spared me.”

He might have added something else—I can’t remember the exact order now. Shock scrambles people. Either way, that phrase stuck.

I’d chalked it up to hypothermia. People say weird things when they’re that cold. Now, staring at that note with the tack barely holding it, my skin crawled.

I didn’t tell her any of that. What was I going to do—say “Hey, your boyfriend and some half-frozen stranger might’ve met the same thing, congratulations”?

I took the note down two weeks later when it started to curl and bleed ink from the weather. I put it in my desk drawer. It’s still there.

Sometimes I knock my thermos against that drawer by accident in the mornings and the sound makes my shoulders tense before I remember why.

There’s one more part I haven’t told anyone.

About a week after we officially called the search and shifted the documentation over to “recovery unlikely,” I went back to Cottonwood Wash on a day off.

Middle of the day. Blue sky, no clouds. Temperatures in the high sixties. Nothing creepy about it on paper.

I didn’t sign in on the sheet. I know, I know. Practice what you preach. I told myself if anyone asked I’d say I forgot.

I walked the main trail with just my daypack, no radio. My knee ached halfway to the mile marker, a deep dull throb that still flares when the weather changes. I told myself that was why I was breathing harder, not nerves.

When I reached the point where Matthew’s prints had left the trail, I stopped.

The side canyon entrance looked smaller in daylight. Just another scruffy cut in the rock, choked with scrub oak and old flood trash. If you didn’t know, you’d walk right past it forever.

I didn’t go in.

I stood at the mouth of it and listened.

At first, nothing. Just wind moving through the main wash, a couple of scrub jays arguing upcanyon. My heart ticking in my ears.

Then, from somewhere deeper in, far enough that it couldn’t be an echo from the main trail, I heard a sound I’d been waiting for without admitting it.

A thin, strangled call.

“Help.”

Almost clear this time. The consonants hit in the right places. The vowel didn’t drag as much.

It didn’t sound like begging.

It sounded like someone practicing a word until they liked how it felt.

I left. I didn’t run, but it was a close thing.

People online love to argue about labels. Skinwalker, wendigo, crawler, “fleshgait,” whatever the latest YouTube channel calls it. They want a name so they can categorize it, put it in a box with lore and rules and bullet points.

You’re probably wondering what I think it was.

I’m not Navajo. I didn’t grow up with those stories in a way I have the right to explain them. Morales did. I’ve seen her face tighten when tourists throw the S-word around like it’s a mascot.

I won’t call it that. That’s not my word.

I’ll tell you what I know.

I’ve worked around mountain lions, black bears, feral hogs. I’ve seen what coyotes do to calves. I know the difference between an animal hunting because it’s hungry and something toying with you.

What watched me in that canyon wasn’t just thinking about eating.

It was studying.

It moved like it was still figuring out how to wear what it was wearing. Like it had put on a skin—maybe more than one—and the seams didn’t quite match. The voice it used didn’t belong to a single throat. It sounded like it was made out of pieces.

And when it said my name, I’m sure of one thing:

It wasn’t repeating it back blindly. It was trying it on.

These days, when an overdue hiker call comes in near dusk and dispatch says “Cottonwood” and “trailhead” in the same sentence, I suddenly remember paperwork I’ve been putting off, or a training module I promised to finish, or my knee starts acting up.

The younger rangers roll their eyes. They tell me I’m getting soft. Morales just gives me a look like she’s not sure if she wants to know why.

On the nights I can’t duck it and I find myself driving past the COTTONWOOD WASH STATE PARK sign, past the CCC ruins, past the bulletin board with a fresh stack of sign-in sheets, I keep my eyes on the road.

I don’t look at the gap in the rock wall where the side canyon starts. I don’t glance at the slope where something once walked parallel to me, matching my pace.

And when the radio crackles in that stretch, picking up half a word or my own voice delayed and warbling, I turn the volume up just enough to drown out anything else that might be trying to learn how to say my name.",0,1762738235.0,TheDarkArchive,0,0.5,False
1ot0wje,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1ot0wje/the_long_and_final_autumn/,The Long and Final Autumn,"“I’m glad that I’m able to walk you down the aisle, Sonya.”

“Yeah… I’m glad too, dad.”

The bride wore a ball-gown – patterned white, a long train, and the one she had her eyes on since she was in high school. She’d saved it for someone special, her one and only. And right now, it was only him that she saw in her eyes, standing at the altar. Curly dark hair and clean shaven, he wore a bright tuxedo, with that smile to boot. The violins played Wedding March and the guests – family and friends all stood with big smiles; they gave this couple their silent blessing, as the bride’s father had too.

It was an indoor venue. The windows are sealed well, with little sign left behind of ever being ones there. No expense was spared, it did well to stave off that heat from the outside with little noise.

The father's boots landed heavy and slow up the marble steps, the old man that held the hands of his daughter adjusting his leg to find surer footing on the ground. Bride and groom now faced each other – childhood friends, to highschool sweethearts, and soon to be husband and wife.

Deep and gruff, his voice tried hard to carry a weight of authority as he pulled himself close to the groom, “You take ca- You make sure you and Sonya live a happy life… You hear me, Peter?”

But no words came. None yet, anyways. The old man looked up and saw the man biting his lips, trying to push up a smile, eyes glossed over with tears. Peter gave a single sniff, then said, “That I will, sir. You take care of your own daughter just fine, yeah?”

And this time, tears welled up in the old man’s eyes. He couldn’t bear to let this young man see him cry then, and pulled him in closer, hugging him.

“I will, son… I will.”

It was the picture-perfect wedding. Young love triumphed, and none would object. None possibly could. They kissed, now spouses two in the month of March – under the first Autumn leaves that fell in Spring.

The sun was dipping now behind the distant buildings. Still, when the rooftop door opened to Sonya, a blast of prickling heat followed, with that glow of red in the sky. She pushed open the door with her shoulders, cake in one hand and an open umbrella in the other. She saw the young man sitting near the edge of the roof staring at that setting sun, unburdened by its rays. Speechless, both from the stunning beauty of the star of day, and the fact that Peter was sitting there without any protection, eating a slice of cake. He turned around, seeing the look on her face.

“Cooler today, ain’t it? Don’t even need an umbrella.”

“Mmhm.”

Sonya uses her feet to drag a brick to hold the door open, before propping her umbrella against the entrance there and entering with wine in her left hand. She takes a seat, leaning against the man. His hair felt nice – the softest and most comfortable.

“Is that all supposed to be for me?”

“Mmhm.”

“Cause you know you can’t drink with th-”

“I know. I know, it’s not that strong. And at least one of us should be drinking the wine we bought for this>’

She presses up against the cork, thumbing it open with a loud pop. Peter accepts the bottled red from her, taking his first sip. It was sweet like grape juice, and just how he liked it.

“I-is something wrong honey?”

Sonya moved a piece of cake around her plate without having taken a single bite out of it. She only snapped back to that present moment after hearing her husband’s words.

“Yeah… sorry Peter hah… It’s just the same thing I talked to you about the night we found out about the baby. I’m just a lil’ worried about some stuff, that’s all.”

“We’re gonna be just fine, Sonya. The state mandates that your employer has to give you paid maternity leave later on, even if you’re quite a new hire. Plus, we’ve got your dad, my dad, my mom, my sister… Point is, we’ll be just fine-”

“I know, I know,” she turns away just enough to hide the slight annoyance in her eyes. Sometimes, he didn’t know how exactly to help, “I guess… It’s just that I don’t know if I’m gonna be a good mother, is all. Some friends tell me that they feel this inexplicable joy and… I don’t think I’ve felt it, y’know?”

Peter pulls her in closer, resting his head on hers now before turning his torso to give her a small hug, which turned into him holding both her shoulders, “Well I’m scared too. Dunno how much it’s worth but I think I get less scared that I’m gonna be a father of a child that’s gonna have you as a mom. And you gotta know that I’m gonna be there, aight? Throughout the entire way. You know that, right?”

Sonya turns back. Some other times, he knew exactly what to say.

“I know.”

Sonya feels his hand come to rest on her belly. Hers follow suit. She wondered if the baby, even then, could feel the odd stillness in the air – like the world holding its breath.

“So… how drunk’s dad right now?”

“Oh,” Sonya says, blowing a raspberry, and making a drinking motion with her hand, “Already showing my uncles photos of his past camping trips.”

Peter laughed. And things would be good for a while.

The First Trimester

“Scientists are now saying that the early Autumn is actually a sign of warmer Summers to come. Let’s hear more fro- Psshhhhat- I voted for you because I thought you could stop the fires, Mr. President. I thought we’d finally get permanent homes.. WHERE ARE OUR HOMES MR- Psshhhhat- Kyrieee, Eleisooon. Let us join our hands in prayer, and pray for all of those stricken by the new droughts around the world. May God sa- Pssssheu- zzz”

The front door opens and Sonya turns the television off. She turns around from the sofa, “Did’ja manage to fit the crib in the car, Peter?”

He pokes his head in, from the side of the living room entrance, the box filled with planks and screws rattling around as he gives that goofy smile. Unsurprisingly, his light grey stubble gives it a goofier quality of sorts.

“You betcha. Got you those donuts you like so much too.”

“Thanks, Pete. Just leave them in the kitchen for now.”

A coat, a sweater, then scarf and beanie were tossed onto the other chair in the living room. Peter sits himself down on the chair with a tired sigh. He was soaked with sweat, and thus adjusted his seating to the edge of the leather.

“Where’s your dad?” Peter says, cracking open a can of Fanta, and taking a few sips from it, “didn’t see him in his room.”

“He’s closing shop downtown right now. Not exactly the best time to be running a sauna with… everything that’s happening.”

“Good on him. The guy could’ve retired a good while back. Poor man deserves a break.”

“Hey could you also get me o-”

Peter waves his hands in front of him, and takes out another cold can of soda with a silent ‘tadaa!’

“Thanks,” Sonya responds flatly, taking the can and cracking it open to drink, “I bet the kids in the Kindergarten love it when you do stuff like that, huh? Are your parents able to make it today?”

“My mom had to cancel because of some work stuff. Says she’ll come during the later half of dad’s trip though. Dad says he’ll be coming a bit later on tonight. The radiation keeps messing with his GPS or something.”

“I see.”

They both take a sip from their cans of drink. Their blinds and curtains were drawn open, allowing filtered light to pour in through the windows. The weather wasn’t hot per se. It was standard for autumn, and perhaps the freshest and cleanest air the two had breathed their entire life – clean as water in the ice caps. But the light was becoming poison. It distilled slower where the two lived, but still it grew in toxicity, day-by-day. Already, they’d given up on painting the walls outside, the paint discolouring under the afternoon sun.

“Hey, I’ll just put something on the telly while I go whip up something for us to eat, alright?”

“N-nah, that won’t be necessary I think. Just tune the old radio to something nice for yourself. I haven’t showered yet.”

The front door opens again, this time, slower steps enter. A voice called out from the entrance, “Finished up at the old place. Found some old photos as well… I think.” His voice was strained, and so Sonya rushed to the door, offering to help him carry his things. It’d only been two months, but not many would’ve guessed, looking at the guy.

His skin, still bronzed from days of work under the sun, now shone more clearly with the gloss of old age and splotches of white and purple that came with no real reason. The stocky and built frame he had on the day of the wedding had withered away into less meat, and just… less.

“This is why… dad.. I’ve told you many times to just… bring Peter along with you.”

The weight turns light as a third person takes the load off for both of them, carrying the box to the other room.

“W-when did you tell me that, now? You never said anything about that.”

“Just this morning, dad. I thought you were going to call him after you were done cleaning up the stall.”

“A-ah…”

The silence lasted for a few seconds before Sonya turned on the TV and changed the channel from the religious one, “Which one do you want to watch Pa?”

“The documentary one. My favourite program should be over already but the one that runs at six is pretty good. They’re showing reruns of Ocean Planet around this time I think.”

The screen flashed to a shot of a marine mammal – one of many that existed before the surface waters got too hot. This one grew bigger than the many large beasts of land and even the giant squid that emerged since those times before, drawn to the warmer waters above. Narrating it all was a deep and accented man’s voice, carrying with it the awe and reverence the world should have warranted from man. These things were enough already to set the old man into a comfortable haze, slouching back into the couch and watching the drifting currents on the screen. It was left to Sonya to take off the many layers of clothing he still kept on.

He uttered a small and perfunctory thank you to his daughter before continuing, “I usually hate these broadcasting services. All no-good peddlers of their agenda, fearmongers and the fakest shit you’ve had ever seen in your life. And I’ve lived for my fair share of those. But one thing these guys did right was stopping this show after the honourable man who voiced it all passed on. Hats off to them I say.”

“Hats off to them,” Sonya agrees.

The evening ran quick after Peter’s father came. He arrived in his jeep and emerged from the garage.

“Howdy! Is that Greg watching that show again?”

“Hey. All goes well, Mateo,” replied Grigor, to his neighbour of many years, from times passed, “Catch anything today?”

Mateo raises up a blue and white cooler box, “Squid again.”

They were friends in high school, friends in the military, and then friends again as fathers to the married couple. It was a small world in a big city. And it helped that half the apartments were left derelict and abandoned. They ate, talked and then reminisced for a while longer. The night held the day’s warmth and vigour well. The alcohol helped the two old men much to do this. The heat helped make it difficult for much rest to be found until some hours past midnight.

And then it was two in the morning. Sonya couldn’t sleep. She just found herself reviewing her case notes in bed. Paying clients paid their lawyers well to do a good job; they paid top dollar to warrant attorneys like Sonya just to simplify and shorten documents for them to read. Patience and attention were rare commodities today — they said it depended on whose parents had switched early from plastic to glass. Most men were stripped of finer intellectual faculties but really, it had been a whole fiasco overblown. There had even been people that warned of the bioaccumulation of microplastics to lead to the extinction of man. No, no, man didn’t go extinct, so things were still good.

Then it was three in the morning. Sonya shuts her laptop off, feeling her eyelids heavy at last. She had to stop herself from continuing. It was only the coughs of the old men in the other room that stirred her from her nods off.

She kept the glossy black device under her desk, catching sight of the glow that burnt into the night sky. It was a pretty glow, embers thrown into the atmosphere from the forests and fires of midtown. Sonya smiled. Really, dread was something only afforded to a people that were running out of time to fix a problem. Only tranquility was left to the people of this time. The Second Trimester

“Oh my god! Sonya! You’re still so thin, darling! You have got… to eat more,” the lady, equally tall and loud in a floral blouse with naturally curly hair dyed a light brown, started, “Is it him? Is it because Peter starves you? Just tell, m’kay? B’cause I’ve whooped his ass before and I’ll do it again. Lemme te-”

She trailed on for a good while. And she was certainly a very talkative woman. Her name was Donna. Everyone has that one aunt whom your mother takes you to shop with once or twice a year. Everyone but Peter. That aunt was his mother.

It was at the tail-end of Autumn now. The leaves that fell were gray and translucent. So was the dirty glass that hid the interior of the showrooms of rows upon rows of bunkers. They varied from the more affordable and functional one-room types that would protect you from the sun unveiled, to the slightly less dull mansionettes that ran for two or three floors, luxury where it could be found these days.

“How’s about this one now? Looks kind of like the old house, doesn’t it, son?”

The house Mateo pointed to had a concrete exterior, though it kept a thin lining of wood plastered on the inside. It looked quite homely. It even had a sloped ceiling and those open-layout built-in furniture. It made it look larger than it actually was.

“It does, pa. I don’t think rustic’s what we’re looking for though.”

Sonya was clinging to Peter’s side. Maybe it was just her, but she didn’t fancy shopping for housing nowadays. The National Department of Housing and Development and realtors assure the people that such enclosed layouts didn’t pose any dangers to the health of their occupants.

And maybe they were right. For years now, people have cloistered themselves in their houses, either living at work or working at home. Food no longer demanded one to step foot in the streets – for day found blistering heat from above, from the rays that had perforated the sky’s fine lining, while night felt that same heat come from cracked concrete skeletons and sticky tarmac. In truth, it had been like this even before the summers had gotten this bad. Ultraviolet showers gave you and your plants everything the sun could – the new normal, people called it. Sonya caressed the now visible bump that showed through her woolen sweater, looking at it. She wondered if her baby would ever get to see a first snow.

She whispered to Peter, “Hey, honey. I think I need to sit down somewhere for a bit.”

“S-should I come with?”

“You go on ahead.”

Sonya had only begun to walk away from the group when she felt Donna clasp her hands around her arm.

“Come on. Let’s you an’ me go together then, spend some girl time away from the boys, hmm?”

They found the display area for the recliner chairs and took their seats there. The store’s speaker systems were playing the amateur-ish voice of a young woman with a difficult accent repeating the deals they had on for the new pay-to-install insulant lining as they sat in silence for some time. Donna did so to give Sonya some rest. Sonya did so, having noticed that Donna already had her phone out with pictures of what she could only assume was yet another baby product. Those moments didn’t last for long, Donna shifting her chair closer to Sonya, and leaning in close to show her a photo of what looked like a small jar of cream.

“So what you’re gonna want to do is apply this over wh-”

Sonya snorted, and then began giggling, pulling her hand up to cover her mouth.

“Ah… I’m sorry dear. It is a bit weird for me to be showing you this he-”

“No… hahahah- No you’re perfectly good, Mrs Smith. And I’m sorry, Mrs Smith. It’s just you’re the first person whose gotten something for me, and not the baby.”

On her phone, she was showing an opaque white container of cream, labelled ‘Breastfeeding Ointment’, sealed with a metal lid.

“Ohh… so you were saying something about how to use it, is that right?”

“Yes, that’s right dear. So this is for after the pregnancy but I’d suggest stocking up now before things get too bad outside. What you’re gonna want to do is…”

They talked together about things, Donna sharing some stories Sonya hadn’t heard before during her own pregnancy with Peter.

“Y’know… I wish that you would just call me mum, after so many years.”

Sonya lets out a small hiss of air out of her nose, and smiled, staring down, “I know Peter does that for dad already but I think I’ve just gotten way to used to calling you and Mateo, Mr. and Mrs. Smith already.”

“Ahh know, ah know. Just sayin.”

The store hummed softly under fluorescent light, nearly empty now. Sonya was still staring at her shoes when she said, “You know you’re my mom, though.”

And this time, it was Donna’s turn to smile, letting out that sniffling laugh, nodding in response. And they let the moment hang for a bit there, before Donna spoke again, “How’s Greg holding up these days at home?”

“Oh… well I think he’s still doing fine. He helps around the house quite a bit still, though I am glad we made him close up shop when he did. He forgets the names of people he sees on television a lot of the time now though.”

Donna opened her mouth to say something but closed it, placing her hand on Sonya’s lap instead, rubbing it.

“You’re being very strong about all of this business y’know?”

“Yeah. Maybe not dad’s ex-wife but I do wish a lot of the time that he would have someone who connects with him better to accompany him on his worse days.”

“Ah know darling. Ah know.”

The three men came back not long after this. They’d done everything they came to the store to settle that day and were just about ready to head back home.

They pushed open the door to the airlock connected to the building. It smelt flatly of sweat and warehouse, Peter pulling open the locker to place the radiation poncho on Sonya as it was harder to fit on with the baby. She put on the mask and goggles on herself just fine. And then they left the building to the sheer temperature outside – to streets of barren trees of late fall.

They stepped out into the late evening. Though it wasn’t light that touched them anymore, no, it was something closer to memory. The Third Trimester

The three – Sonya, Grigor and Peter – sat at their couch in the living room. They waited, breaths bated, while they listened to snippets of the conversation the visiting Mateo was having with Donna on the phone. They could only hear his side of it all, and he had done a good job to hide the worry in it.

“I- I see. Yes, I still have my key to it. Have you checked the garage door? It’s closed right? You’re certain it’s closed… Alright then.”

The bunker had a rather minimalistic Scandinavian design. Light wooded browns complemented blue fabric furniture and curtains – ones that covered the false sunlight from the outside. It was only a little smaller than Grigor’s house. This was the house Sonya, Peter, and Grigor would live in and prepare for the baby boy that was soon to come a month from then. Mateo and Donna lived in a separate bunker, not too far from theirs, in case anything happened to any one of them, so they could help each other out.

Peter didn’t say the first words, for he’d already gone to his room. The folks in the living room heard him ruffling through the clothes on hangers in the wardrobe, no doubt looking for his radiation poncho. So Sonya was the first to speak, “Wh- What did she say? Is she fine right now?”

Mateo’s voice hung grim and low, the kind of gravel that filled the room, “She’s safe, Sonya. She’s in the garage of our bunker and well… It’s still night out.”

At this, some relief washed over Sonya’s face, her pupils no longer pinpricks. Her sigh was followed by Mateo continuing on, “But she let some young kid, a girl wearing a jacket I think… The girl asked for shelter from Donna when Donna was heading back to the bunker. Donna said all she did was ask her where her parents were. That sent the young girl into all sorts of panic, locking herself inside of the bunker, screaming that she didn’t want to be taken back to her father. She took Donna’s key inside with her.”

Sonya nodded, her mouth open, “O-okay. If Peter can’t make it back here from your place safely before dawn, please just tell him to stay at your place, okay? Grigor and I will be fine here for a day.”

Mateo nodded. His poncho was on the coat rack, and began to wear it. Peter came out of the room soon after, already in the silvery coat that reflected the yellow lights of the house in every direction. Sonya saw him packing items in his duffel bag, looking for that one thing he always misplaced somewhere in the house. Sonya saw herself moving to find it – the water bottle that was always in the top cabinet of the kitchen, and always somehow invisible to Peter – handing it to him. Sonya saw an opportunity for her to touch his hands with hers. Peter held it back. Her skin was smooth, and his skin soft with hair. Peter was the one to move his hand away first this time, a rare first, continuing to finish packing everything up for the excursion.

Sharp and red – alarms rang in dragged high notes as the button was pushed by Mateo to open the doors to the garage.

“Use the landline at their place to call me when you get there okay?”

“I will honey.”

“What are you gonna do with the girl?”

“Maybe nothing at all. Hopefully, she would’ve let Mom in by the time we get there.”

“Maybe.”

Peter hung close to Sonya, pressing himself against her belly as he kissed her for a good few seconds. He said something about them having more than four times the amount of time needed to get to the bunker, only an hour and a half away, and not to worry so much. The car engine started, its sporadic bursts of activity heard loud and clearly from the living room. The young father was about to leave, until he stopped at the door, hanging on the door frame.

“Hey, dad! Greg!”

At this, the man that sat in a grooved and stretchy singlet that sat on the sofa became lucid again, staring up to look at Peter. His face painted with a coat of confusion.

“You’ll take care of your daughter just fine until I get back, yeah?”

Nobody said anything for a few seconds. The car the only one that didn’t hold their breaths under the heavy air.

“I will, son. That I will.”

Peter’s face turned into a smile for the first time in an hour as he gave the wall of the living room two last smacks for good luck, “We’ll be off then. See you guys!”

“Remember to take your boots off before you get into their place! You always forget!”

And they were gone.

Sonya found herself pacing around the living room after taking out a book to read initially. The sound of the television could be heard behind her, the deep voice of an old and British knight narrating the hunt of the giant cats of the Serengeti – residents of an old house of cards, folded, waterlogged and burnt now all the same. They were made vagrants, doomed to humble artificial abodes, or made docile to “preserve biodiversity” in bunkers with hairless aliens.

These were the young days of a new kind of Summer. Tar and varnished wooding are made fuel under the daylight, and signals that combat the surface radiation come and go distorted and warped. Fall, Winter and Autumn are events as the Woolly Mammoth, Dodo and whales are – they all were – things made antiques. People were advised to weather the first five decades of the new era until all the major sources of “difficult fuel” have dried up, enabling folks to reinhabit the surface assuming scientists finish up their discovery of a machine that would stop radioactive decay. This, this and certainly nothing more, had to be the new normal. All things considered, it wasn’t that bad, because they still could be so much worse. The friendly and honeyed words that men on the cable television said that they’d actually been lucky to have been afforded the luxuries of a nuclear energy generator that could be fitted into a storeroom. They were lucky that the miracle tonics and tisanes of the future could save them from the slew of new monsters that emerged from the ice-caps and tiny plastic knives that laced every water source. It might have just been indulgence then, that Sonya found herself wondering if her child would ever grow to see the blue sky of day in his entire life.

Sonya didn’t know how long she’d been ruminating to herself, the still stagnant nighttime lighting of the bunker giving no indicator. She was only snapped out of it when she had heard her father start to reminisce again, for the first time in weeks at this point, “I served in the Annexation War of Mongolia… before I settled down and had a daughter in the United States.”

Sonya knew about this one already. He set it up this same specific way each time, leading into the story about how he learned to make milk tea the same way the Mongols did – mixing tea leaves with ox milk, instead of water. She liked it though, and so she listened. He continued, voice interrupted by his phlegm-ruined throat.

“We came in… from the northern border near Baikal. It took some time before we saw it, but we saw it- it-... all of it was beautiful.”

The story was different.

“Golden stalks of grass that carpeted rolling hills and flats as far as the eye could see. All with no tree, nor sea in sight. And above it, lied the clearest, and bluest sky any man could have ever laid their eyes on. It was midday, and so the sun was up high but it didn’t make light of that deepness. There were no oceans there, but the sky still held the reflection of one. Blue skies! As far as my eyes could take me.”

He recalled all of this, his dried eyes wetting with tears – hands rubbing the fabric of the sofa as if it were a map he was reading. Sonya was the first to speak next.

“Sir?”

“Yeah?”

“May I have your name again? I must have forgotten it.”

“It’s uhh…”

Grigor paused there, his voice trailing off as he stared into the distance that didn’t exist – straight into the wooden floor. He looked up again, some shock in his eyes now as he said, “W-wh- why are you crying young lady?”

“I-it’s nothing. Uhh… You were telling me about your daughter before I think.. Maybe we could continue with that?”

“No, nonsense. I’ll tell you all about her later. Maybe we could talk about what’s bothering you first, young lady.”

Sonya knew she shouldn’t try this line of talk right now. Her mouth said differently.

“I’m… I’m going to become a mother soon, you see? And things are kind of scary right now.”

“You seem like a perfectly capable young lady. I mean… looking at your place, it looks like you’re doing quite well for yourself.”

“I was, I- I really was. I worked in a law firm before, and it fetched good money I suppose. I don’t think any of what I learnt translated over here at home though. That’s more of my husband’s thing.”

“Well! Well there you have it. It sounds like you have yourself a nice husband right? Good family too?”

“Only the best I could hope for. But I have to take care of my dad as well… And he’s sick.”

“I can’t speak for you, but it sounds like you’re going to be okay then, right? Your dad raised a fine young lady. I trust you’ll do a fine job taking care of him with your family.”

“Mmhm.”

“O-oh no… You’re crying again. Did I say something wrong?”

“No, no you didn’t. I think I’m just being unreasonably worried right now… my husband’s gone on a trip and I’m worried something will happen to him on the way there. I don’t know what I’m gonna do then.”

“Mother? Siblings?”

“It’ll just be me and my dad..”

The tears couldn’t stop then. They came, choked and interrupted only by stiff inhales through her mucus-caked nostrils. The old man just sat there, the tightest pang of pity in his heart. He didn’t know what he could do to help this nice stranger. This went on for several minutes.

“I’m just being stupid. He should be reaching there in less than an hour. I-”

She stopped, and quickly turned to hold her breath and wipe the tears off her face. Grigor’s face had blanked out again at that time. He was staring into a wall this time.

An hour and a half had passed, then two. Eventually, it was only two hours till dawn. Then the call finally came. The exhausted woman drifted off in her recliner, woken up by the thin strip of red light that flashed urgently from the wall, signalling an incoming call. She’d tripped over the coffee table, almost waking up Grigor in the process trying to get to the button. She pressed the button, and heard nothing but heavy breathing for the first few seconds. Her smile vanished.

“H-hey did we manage to connect to you guys?”

“Peter?”

He sounded muffled and somewhat tired, though it was happiness that Sonya heard cut through, if only for one moment.

“Sonya, you have to listen to me okay. S-stay where you are. We’re going to be okay, you hear? We’ve contacted the local search and rescue guys and they’re saying they’re gonna make it here so-”

“Wait… What the fuck happened, Peter?”

Only his breathing punctuated the silence.

“... We ran across a patch of melted tarmac. Our truck got stuck, and I don’t think we’re able to make the jump to the side of the freeway. You have to li-”

“Bring Mateo on the line.”

Her voice cut off what was bound to be another round of rambling. Hers was a tone so quick and clinical. Details were the only cure for her condition then, breaths hastening, every hair on her body raising all too discernably.

“Wh- What?”

“Bring your dad on the line, Peter,” She repeated herself, this time a little more firmly.

The line clacked and crackled, the device being passed over to the other man there.

“Hey, is thi-”

“Mr. Smith, where are you and Peter? I need the precise location shown on your car’s GPS.”

“GPS’ broken, Sonya. Has been for months now.”

“DAMN IT, YOU WERE ABLE TO REACH ME RIGHT? J-”

Sonya wiped the tiny rivulets of sweat off her face and started pacing again, more awake that she had ever been in her entire life. Sicker than she’d ever felt in the mornings so far.

“Mr. Smith… try. It. Again. And keep me on the line.”

“I-I will Sonya.”

Sonya already didn’t waste any time searching for her belongings, taking with her only what she needed for what would be a very fast drive to this freeway. A rustling could be heard from the speakers, Peter on the call now.

“Sonya, please. We will be fine, the search and rescue will be here before you even get here. What will you do then? How are you even going to reach us? The road is still sticky and actual tar right now. Stay pu-”

“SHUT THE FUCK UP… Alright? You don’t get to tell me what to do right now. You don’t know if they’ll even reach you in time and there’s more than enough time for me to reach wherever you are and back… Besides, your dad’s truck doesn’t have very good radiation shielding, only ours does.”

“Sonya… Even with that, it’ll still be at least five hundred x-rays of radiation when day comes. I don’t think Max could handle that.”

Sonya froze. Max. He’d used the name they’d whispered to each other in the dark, the name no one else knew. The sound of it on his lips now, as a weapon to stop her, made her see white.

“You don’t ge- You don’t get to use that to tell me not to come! Alright? How fucking dare you use him to make me stay here?! H-”

Nobody said a word for a while.

“Mateo. What’s your coordinates? Where are you guys at?”

“The GPS isn’t working… And the city’s become a fair bit different since the surface closed up. I don’t think you’ll know the way he-”

“Try me.”

It was the freeway they’d usually take to pass through the central business district. There were two voices fighting for her attention to get her not to leave but they were silenced with a single button. She was already in a radiation poncho, nearly out the door.

“Sonya?”

The voice was weak and sleepy. And it came from the physical space in the living room. A ghost had said them.

“Dad?”

“Sonya… where am I?”

“Dad, you’re home alright. Just stay put. And don’t go anywhere, I have to go no-”

“Sonya, where are you going?”

“Outside! Okay?! I have to go fast or else.”

“Sonya… Please stay. I don’t want to be alone.”

The words were glass and steel tempered well at the same time; the words were a father’s last sword and shield. One he held rubbing the fabric of the couch in trembling hands – like a soldier that traced the contours of a map.

Sonya was suddenly aware of everything besides the sights around the bunker. It smelt like piss-soaked diapers, the sound of documentary reruns on the television. And all of this before Max had even been born.

Day came. Only Sonya and Grigor remained.

September, the twenty-eighth was Sonya’s original due date; but as Autumn had, Max came early. His first cries punctured the solemnity.

Epilogue

Scissors snipped at strips of meat, a woman preparing the bird and laying it on plates for a drooling man and herself. In the background, was only the humming of the microwave that warmed a bottle of milk. It dinged as dinner began.

The woman had to lift both hands of the two boys that sat before their carer then. She said grace – and it was said well.

Dinner began with a kiss to both cheeks of the men left in the room, Sonya whispering to Max just two words.

And that jinx gets like worse each time.

1 First was a grocery cashier in high school, where I randomly almost fainted. Never figured out why, my Mom just assumed I needed more red meat, and the rest of my work there was fine.
2 Second was a fancy restaurant in college I worked at shortly, and though I didn't get physically ill, it was so demanding that I had nightmares for months from working there.
3 Third was the job I finally got after thinking that the pandemic was over, and literally a week before it I got COVID for the first time. It was awful anyway, prevented anyone from ever having a life, and I quit after a week.
4 Fourth was at a coffee shop, much more low-key and only part time, and I was happy. But, my body wasn't quite right after having COVID, and lo and behold I developed Long COVID! I got POTS and dysautonomia!

Chronic illness has been devastating. It's been about 3 years (?) and I haven't had any serious job since the coffee shop, as my symptoms get in the way of my everyday life, as well as sometimes flare and debilitate me for varying lengths of time (hours to even days).

Currently, I help out at my church for a few hours once a week, and I get some money from it, but I also felt awful starting that because it was only meant to be temporary relief for the person who did it before, but then she died and I still almost feel like it was somehow my fault, my jinx or something.

The economy and job market have been so awful and I was so excited to hear back from literally anyone after nothing for months. The only issue is that my interview is for a particularly stressful position. My parents have even tried talking me out of it, concerned that it'll have an incredibly negative impact on my mental health, potentially even affecting my physical health due to my chronic illness. And I don't necessarily disagree, but I really need to make money. 

I want to do the interview at least for practice, but I'm still terrified. I keep telling myself it's only an interview, not actual work, but I'm still terrified. I'm scared of my ""jinx"", I'm scared of any potential negative health things happening. I wish I knew how to at least manage my chronic illness better. I sometimes wonder if I have an actual curse on me and I need to find a witch or someone to lift it.

I feel silly even typing this. Like I know I don't have good mental health, but I feel somewhat justified in my fear.",1,1762738131.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.67,False
1ot0v9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ot0v9e/my_shadow_wont_get_up/,My Shadow Wont Get Up,"The day began like any other. The alarm clock bleated out its dull chime early that morning. I arose to greet a beautiful new dawn filtering through half-drawn curtains. I threw them open and greeted the day. Golden light streaked into my bedroom, warming weary bones. A gentle zephyr caressed the trees, eliciting delicate whispers from yellowing oak leaves. Birds sang their morning melodies with enthusiasm and cheer. I smiled to myself, and after soaking in that glorious, autumnal scene, I headed into the kitchen to fix myself a little something for breakfast. I spent maybe an hour there in the dining room, enjoying coffee over the weekend paper’s news and crossword puzzles. When at long last I glanced at my watch, I saw that I had spent a bit longer reading deciphering word clues than I intended, but that’s okay. I’m self-employed, and I make my own hours. Since I live alone, the only person to which I’m ultimately beholden is myself. A late start only meant I would have to work a little later. I folded the paper and set it upon the table, stood up and pushed in my seat, and headed for the stairs. Upon my ascent, I reached the landing at the edge of the hall and headed into my office to scan countless lines of code for errors. Maybe four or five hours into my shift I had to get up and use the restroom. On my way to the bathroom at the end of the hall, something gave me pause. I cast an uneasy glance into my once welcoming bedroom. There, upon my bed, lay my shadow.



So what? I saw my shadow on my bed. What of it? Well, it was not cast from the frame of the door where I stood as one might expect. It did not elongate across the threshold and floor to subsequently distort over the vertical incline of the furniture. It did not stretch laterally across the sheets in relation to the angle from which it ought to have been cast. No, it was laid out, cozy and comfortable, disconnected and free from my corporeal person, loose atop those sheets.



I had to do a double take. I closed my eyes, whispering assuring words to myself that I was seeing things. A hallucination brought on by too many nights working late, or a trick of the light. It has to be that. There was no way my shadow could be lying there in my bed while I stood over in the hall. Shadows have to be attached to something. My shadow is attached to me. That’s the rules and that’s how it has always worked. Maybe I had gone cross-eyed from staring into the computer screen or maybe the glow of the monitor was burning a hole in my retina and it had created this illusion on my bed. I told myself that when I opened them again, my bed would be empty, as it ought to be. I wish that were the case.



My first inclination was to deny that it was actually my shadow of course. I mused that maybe I had rolled in some grime and tracked it into the bed, but that idea quickly discarded itself. I kept my house well enough, nor did I work on cars or tend livestock or dig in the dirt all day. I wrote code. That silhouette wasn’t deposited filth. I had to tell myself that even though it lay there in the same spot I had always laid before, in the same way that I had always laid, and that it was just as big as I was, it was anything but my shadow. This delirium, this… psychosis which had precipitated itself early this afternoon was just that, and I was going to prove it wrong. There was a logical reason for such a shape to occupy my bed, and I was going to find it, but first, I had to calm myself. So, naturally, I checked to make sure that my shadow was actually still attached to me. My eyes darted to the floor, looking for the familiar I once took for granted. The light shone behind me, but beyond me, no shadow was projected, save for one, and it rested soundly where I slept last night. Muttering quiet curses and disbelieved explanations, I retreated back to my office and stared blankly at the wall from my computer chair.



It took me almost two hours to pluck up my courage and cross the threshold into my room. That whole time, my shadow had not moved. I knew this because it never came to join me in my office, and when I finally returned to that loathsome bedroom, it still remained, as if it had been seared into the sheets, a black pattern now stained upon an otherwise blistering white fabric. I approached the bedside to examine this mysterious runaway, this rogue straggler, this aberrant umbra of mine. Overriding primal revulsion, I seized the covers by the nearest corner and tore them from the bed, expecting my shadow to come flying off with it. I was still coping at this time. If I didn’t believe that someone had broken into my house and painted my silhouette onto my sheets, I wouldn’t have made it through that morning as well as I had. Now, with the afternoon waning, with the white blur of flying fabric no longer obscuring my view, and my shadow still lying there in the bed despite the fact that I had torn the covers out from underneath it, I was confronted with cold reality. That was my shadow laying there in my bed and it had not moved all day.



Of course, the coping didn’t end here. My sleuthing led me then to look out the window and stare into the oak tree right outside of the glass. With my courage failing me, I pleaded with any god that might listen that I would find some prankster hiding in its limbs, casting his shadow through my window and onto my bed, but I found no such thing. With the sun setting through the branches, beaming its crimson and orange sprays through the leaves, I thought for a moment that maybe it was an effect of the afternoon light and so I closed the curtains. With only my lamps lighting the room, I turned around again, hoping it would be gone. My shadow still laid there. I was getting desperate.



“Get up.” It didn’t stir. “I said get. Up.” It just laid there. “GET THE HELL UP!” I began to shout. I screamed at it and I beat my fists against where it lay and I cursed it and I threw things at it, and when it didn’t move, I begged and pleaded and wailed and wept until I collapsed on the floor beside it. Nothing.



With tears distorting my vision, I stood up and walked out of the room feeling defeated. I paused at the door before shutting off the light. With the room now bathing in darkness, I wondered if maybe my shadow could move again. It’s a silly thought, I know, but with the lights off, my shadow blended in with the rest of the darkness. Perhaps that would break the surreal and unnatural chains that bound it to the mattress where it lay and it could roam again, and by that roaming, roam back to me. My eyes strained to see into the darkness, and when they finally adjusted, I shuddered. Despite the black room, I could still see it there upon the bed. Unmoved. Unyielding. My shadow, laying in my damn bed without me.



I didn’t sleep in my bed that night. To be honest, I didn’t sleep at all. I spent the night in front of the TV downstairs while my bed remained occupied. Me lying beside that thing in my bed repulsed me on an instinctual level. Instead, I watched late night television until the sun came up.



With dawn I was still exhausted, but I couldn’t bring myself to go upstairs and sleep in my bed. I brewed extra coffee that morning to help me power through the day. When I finally made my way to the top of the landing, I paused at the hall. With a heavy sigh I stared at the door to the bedroom that I had left ajar. It was an invitation, left in hopes that maybe my shadow might decide to get up in the middle of the night and come down to reunite with its owner. I couldn’t bring myself to look inside, though. Call it a hunch, but I knew what waited for me in there. Instead, I went to my office and did my best to do my job.



It was difficult to focus. Despite my best efforts to lose myself in my work, every thought I had bent itself towards the odd circumstances which I now faced. After a few hours, my attentions waned from the tasks of the day. I started to search the internet to see if anyone had perhaps experienced this phenomena before. My search brought up nothing relevant. What I did find was a bunch of ghost videos about shadow people, but it was not the presence of new shadows that troubled me. It was the absence of one all too familiar. It couldn’t help me answer the question at hand. It seemed as if nobody had ever “lost” their shadow but me.



I cradled my head in my hands and took a deep, shuddering breath, pushing myself to think of some solution. Somehow, my shadow and I had disconnected. Now it lingered in my bed without an owner. A perverse thought crossed my mind. I wondered if maybe my shadow was waiting for me to return to it. I don’t know how we could have become disconnected from each other, but disconnected we had become, and now it lay there alone. It was wild conjecture, but considering the strange circumstances, maybe that wild conjecture offered the bizarre solution that I needed.



When I got to my bedroom, I pushed the door open and gazed inside. There lay that fetid stain upon my life, a motionless reflection of its owner curled up in my bed. It took all of my strength and determination to walk into that room, and when I reached the bedside I gazed at it long and hard. There it was, cold and unyielding and obstinate in its persistence to rest on those sheets. I hated it and I wanted it gone. Better to never have a shadow at all, I thought, but if a shadow I must have, then surely it is better for it to be attached. Out of spite I climbed back into the bed and laid down on top of it. The sheets were cold to the touch and I shuddered as I pressed my body against its separated silhouette.



I hadn’t realized just how tired I was. I opened my eyes to a dark room. When I touched my head against the pillow I must have passed out from exhaustion. At first I stretched languidly, coming out of a blissful respite that I had desperately needed before my faculties returned in full force and I sat up. One question pressed its way to the forefront of my mind. Did it work?



I was terrified to get up, but I knew that I could not linger there forever. With a heavy heart I stepped onto the floor and turned around to face the bed. That bastard was still there, curled up in a blissful and serene sleep from which I could not stir him.



The dam was breaking. I laughed maniacally at my plight, wondering then if I had finally lost it and gone insane, or if this was actually happening to me. The laughter quickly subsided and gave way instead to bitter lamentation. I collapsed in a heap on the floor, staring at an orphaned specter that refused to come home.



It was some time before I collected myself. It had come to me with abundant clarity now that whatever I was dealing with was out of my league. I was just a coder. I wrote computer programs for a living. Attaching wayward shadows back to their hysteric owners was something I had never engaged in before. I needed expertise in the strange and unusual. I needed someone who wouldn’t flinch at the sight of someone’s shadow laying in their bed like it fucking owned it.



I went to my computer and began to look into priests and psychics and paranormal investigators and exorcists. To my surprise, a fair few called our city home and I began to rattle off emails. It was hard writing those letters, speaking about all the bizarre experiments I had undertaken while trying to assess the nature of that shade in my bed and whether or not it was actually mine. I felt sheepish as I explained away everything I had done to try and get it to come back home, and I wondered if I would find a sympathetic ear or be dismissed as some kind of crackpot lunatic wasting their time. I had to remind myself that these people professed to be experts in the unusual, that this was their field of research and expertise, and that someone would be interested in the suffering of some poor fool who couldn’t reattach his shadow to his body.



I didn’t sleep the rest of the night. Compulsively, I pressed the refresh button on my inbox. Hours melted off the clock as I sat there by the dim glow of the screen, waiting for someone who might even try to rectify this odd state of affairs. A wide net is bound to catch a fish, however, and sometime after 3 in the morning, a single reply trickled in to my inbox. One Madame Chantelle, professing to be a medium of some sort, had taken great interest in the details of my now detached shadow laying in my bed without a care in the world. She remarked that she was not far and would be willing to come over immediately if I could make time for her. My heart skipped a beat as I rattled off a response. I told her I’d leave the door unlocked and I sent her my address. Her reply came back in short order telling me she could be over within the hour.



I remained in my office upstairs, unwilling to return to the room where my shadow lay without this new ally who brought the promise of reunion. When at last I heard the door downstairs open up, I was elated. I could hear the Madame yell “hello?” into the house. I called back cheerily “I’m upstairs!” The door shut behind her and the wood began to creak as she ascended the flight, calling out again, “hello?” “I’m in the office,” I replied.



I got up from where I sat and opened the door to see a very surprised Madame Chantelle before me. Overflowing with excitement, I brushed her shock aside and said, “come on, it’s in here.” I maneuvered past her and opened the door to where my shadow still shamelessly lay upon my bed. I turned on the lights and motioned for her to follow. Slowly, cautiously, she came around the corner. “Well, what do you think, Madame? Can you help me?”



She stood there with her mouth agape, staring at the bed where my shadow lay as still as ever, unwilling to get up from the blankets that cocooned it. “Madame?” I probed for a response, her focus unwilling to shift from the bed before her, driven to a silence as complete and uncompromising as the presence of my shade. Then, without so much as a word, she stepped out of the room and headed for the flight of stairs.



I didn’t say anything. My first thought was that maybe she was headed down to her car to get some supplies for whatever she had planned. Salt, or crystals, or whatever the hell these people work with. Simultaneously, a sinking feeling in my stomach suggested that maybe this internet psychic was a bit too far out of her depth and she didn’t come to help but ultimately, to experience a novelty about which she could brag. Now, that being fulfilled, her purpose here had ended. I slumped down against the wall as I heard the front door bang shut. Madame Chantelle had seen herself out. The tears came back hot and wretched and they streaked down my face as I curled up into a ball on the carpet. I just wanted to be whole again.



I didn’t weep for long, however. Maybe 15 or 20 minutes after I had curled into fetal position and bemoaned my fate, I heard the door bang open again. I could hear Chantelle’s voice coming from the living room over a flurry of footsteps. In moments they were storming up the stairs. “Yeah, it’s up there at the end of the hall in the bedroom.” I perked up. Maybe the Madame had opted to call for a few people to assist in reconnecting my shadow to me. As I staggered to my feet, I saw this new help come into my bedroom.

1ot0un9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ot0un9/confused_about_how_to_a_very_complex_situation/,Confused about how to a very complex situation,"**TL;DR:** I (M, mid-20s) confessed feelings to my friend ""K"" (F, mid-20s) who has a long-distance boyfriend. We tried to stay friends, but the chemistry and flirting only escalated. She now gets ""cranky"" and acts like a jealous girlfriend when I distance myself or don't meet her expectations, but refuses to address her relationship or her feelings for me. I’m exhausted and need clarity.

K and I met at work two years ago. The chemistry was instant and intense; everyone noticed it. We used to spend a ton of time together—pool, coffee, long talks. A year ago, she moved cities and during that time, casually posted a picture with her LDR boyfriend. We were all shocked because she had never mentioned him.

When she returned, the chemistry was still there, maybe even stronger. Our mutual friends constantly commented on how well we fit together. Things got incredibly flirtatious. We’d hang out late at her place playing Switch, having deep talks, and doing karaoke.

# The First Confession and Fallout

Earlier this year, the guilt of having these feelings for an unavailable person became too much. I was obsessed. I confessed that I really liked her, but out of respect for her boyfriend, I needed us to stop talking, and I left.

She pulled me back, asked when I started feeling this way, and confirmed she greatly valued my friendship, not wanting to lose it. She never reciprocated my feelings, but I felt relief just having said it. I agreed to take a short break, thinking I was over it. Later, she reached out to my female best friend, confused, asking why I confessed if I was immediately ""over"" the feelings.

**A Crucial Personality Trait:** K is highly non-confrontational. She won't address problems; she lets them simmer until the breaking point before acting. I believe this is key to everything she's doing.

# The Vacation and The Second Fallout

A couple of months later, we went on a group vacation. Due to travel issues, K and I were alone for the first day. We had a great time—amusement park, drinks, very flirtatious energy.

The next night, I was drunk, but I distinctly remember her moving closer, letting her hand linger against mine, and even pressing her hip against my arm. We were smiling and flirting intensely. However, when our other friends started noticing and whispering about us ""going at it again,"" K visibly stiffened up and became distant.

The next morning, she was cold. Later, I found out she had told the group that she **only** sees me as a friend and claimed I had misinterpreted our first solo day as a ""date."" I felt  disrespected, cut her off completely at work, and ignored her.

Eventually, a good friend convinced me to talk to her, saying she was genuinely sad. We patched things up, agreeing to remain strictly friends. At this point, I truly thought my romantic feelings were gone.

# The Current, Confusing Dynamic

Fast forward a few months to now. We're texting more than ever, growing a deep, intimate connection. We joke about me being her ""favorite"" and her knowing I asked her out. She brings it up very often and laughs about the situation. The flirtation has returned, though physical contact is limited to playful punches and kicks. When it's just us talking, she get's very excited and tries to play around with me in a way my ex used to lol

Recently, she sent me a picture of her Halloween costume (not posted publicly, which I thought was slightly weird and out there) and seemed upset when I didn't come see her at a bar because I was hanging out with my friends. For two days, she was short, cranky, and used typical ""girlfriend"" one-word responses (""fine,"" ""i'm always the problem,"" ""whatever""). When I finally saw her the next day, she couldn't stop smiling and admitted, ""I can do whatever I want :P, I always get what I want.""

She admitted that she always tells me the truth, but **""omits"" details** because they aren't ""necessary"" for me to know. When I ask her to be explicit about what she wants, she gives cryptic answers like: ""if you know you know but you dont know...""

No one texts their best friend this much; I know everything about her life, except her actual relationship. She keeps hinting that something is bothering her but she is unwilling to make a change, putting it off until the ""breaking point."" Last night she mentioned that she will deal with it early next year, because she has a lot of things going on in life right now (fair)

We are planning to get coffee this week to work together, and I am leaning back into the infatuation loop.

1. Does she actually like me romantically, or is she just addicted to the attention and emotional intimacy?
2. Is she using me as a backup, keeping me close so that when she hits her LDR ""breaking point,"" she has a soft landing?

I know this dynamic is wrong and draining. I want to start seeing other people, but I can't shake the feeling she might be ""the one"" if she were only available. I'm struggling to pull away because the moment I do, she senses it and flips into this needy, girlfriend-like persona to reel me back in. I feel like I value her as a friend a lot, but there is no reality in which we can continue the same way.

1ot0tte,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZakBabyTV_Stories/comments/1ot0tte/a_missing_hiker_call_changed_how_i_take_night/,A Missing Hiker Call Changed How I Take Night Shifts Forever.,"I don’t take solo night calls anymore.

On paper, I’m still a ranger with the state parks department. My badge says “Senior Ranger,” my contract says backcountry specialist, but after what happened last October I started volunteering for every maintenance shift that keeps me within sight of a road and a crowd.

There’s an incident report for it. It’s in a binder behind the front desk, third shelf down, page for October 19th. If you flipped to it, this is what you’d see:

“Ranger Carson Hale responded to an overdue hiker call from the Cottonwood Wash Trailhead, returned at 07:12 hours, report of possible animal activity, ongoing missing persons case.”

That’s the neat version. The version for supervisors and lawyers and anyone who needs closure that fits on a line.

Everything else I’m putting here because I can’t sleep when it’s quiet anymore.

That day started like every other shoulder-season Thursday.

I was at the station doing the usual nonsense: answering the same questions about whether we have bears (“Yes”), whether we have wolves (“No”), and whether their dog can be off-leash (“Also no, I don’t care how friendly he is”). I filled out a maintenance request for the busted faucet by the campground, dug through the lost and found for a kid’s left sandal, and tried not to think too hard about how much of my job is being an underpaid hall monitor with a radio.

We’re a small park wedged between national forest and reservation land—a chunk of canyons and piñon, dry creekbeds and sandstone ledges. You drive east from town, past the Family Dollar and the last Circle K, hit the brown sign for COTTONWOOD WASH STATE PARK, and then it’s seven more miles on a two-lane that turns to washboard dirt if you miss the turn.

October’s our almost-quiet month. Cool days, cold nights, tourists thinning out but not gone. Enough people to keep the lights on, not enough to justify overtime.

Around 6:30 p.m., I’d just poured the last of the coffee from the station pot into my dented stainless thermos. It was already lukewarm and tasted like metal and burnt beans, but I’m not picky. I screwed the lid on, told myself I’d reheat it later, and we both know I wasn’t going to.

I was halfway through the shift-change checklist when dispatch crackled over the base station.

“Unit Three, you still at the station?”

I thumbed my handheld. “Yeah, go ahead.”

“Got a call from county sheriff. Overdue hiker. Vehicle registered to a Matthew Klein, age thirty-four. Parked at Cottonwood Wash trailhead since 09:17 this morning. No contact. Girlfriend called it in about twenty minutes ago.”

I glanced at the wall clock. 19:42. Outside the office window the sky was a strip of dull purple over the ridge, sun already gone. Morales—night shift—was still tied up on a poaching complaint up in the north sector. She’d told me over the radio an hour earlier she was “knee-deep in camo idiots and shell casings.”

“All right,” I said. “I’ll check the lot, see if he signed in. Maybe he just took the loop slow.”

“You sure?” Dispatch sounded tired but concerned. “You’d be solo out there, Three.”

“Just a quick sweep to the first marker,” I said. “I won’t go stupid deep.”

The lie came out easy. It always does when you tell yourself you’re just checking.

I keep my pack under the desk, half out of habit and half because if I put it away somewhere “proper” I’ll forget something. First aid kit, trauma shears, SAM splint, extra water, tarp, a coil of paracord I always call a bowline when I show the junior ranger kids, even though it’s not. I know it’s not. My brain grabs the wrong knot every single time I’ve got an audience.

I slung the pack over one shoulder, grabbed the SAR radio and a printed map from the rack even though I can draw the trails from memory, and signed myself out on the board:

CARSON – COTTONWOOD WASH – OVERDUE HIKER – 19:50

The drive out felt longer than usual.

Headlights carved through sage and rabbitbrush, catching the odd jackrabbit frozen in the beam before it bolted. The pavement gave up about four miles out; the truck bounced as tires hit hard-packed washboard. I passed the old CCC bathhouse ruins on the left—a crumbling line of stone and a rusted interpretive sign. I always think it’s WPA work until I kneel down and see the nail head stamped “1937 CCC” and remember I’ve had that exact thought before.

Nobody else was out there. No other vehicles. No porch lights on the distant ranch houses. No campfire glow. Just the road and the dark shapes of mesas hemming it in.

The handheld rode on the passenger seat by my thermos, volume low, dispatch chatter a tinny murmur. The coffee had gone from lukewarm to cold; I took a swallow anyway out of habit and grimaced.

I pulled into the Cottonwood Wash trailhead lot at 20:03.

One vehicle sat there: a blue Subaru Outback with a rental barcode sticker on the rear window. Thin coat of dust, no tracks behind the tires. Hood cold when I put my hand on it.

I swung the truck so the headlights washed over the bulletin board and trailhead sign. The board was the usual mess—faded fire danger meter, “WATCH FOR RATTLESNAKES” poster, a missing-dog flyer someone had taped up three months ago. The wind barely moved. The cottonwoods along the dry creekbed might as well have been painted on.

I grabbed my flashlight, clicked it on, and walked over to the sign-in box. We don’t force people to log in and out, but we encourage it. Sometimes it saves hours. Sometimes it doesn’t help at all.

The sheet inside was almost full. I flipped past the earlier entries until I saw it.

NAME: MATTHEW KLEIN
TIME OUT: 09:30
DESTINATION: LOOP TO RIDGE OVERLOOK
EXPECTED RETURN: BY 5

I don’t know why that “BY 5” snagged in my head. People usually scribble “afternoon” or don’t bother. The way he wrote it made it look like a promise. Like he’d told someone, I’ll be out by five, I swear.

“Unit Three at Cottonwood trailhead,” I said into the radio. “Subject’s vehicle present, name matches sign-in. No sign of subject at lot.”

“Copy, Three,” dispatch answered. “You requesting secondary unit?”

I looked out at the trail sign, the dark mouth of the path dropping into the wash. The part of my brain that likes checklists and procedures whispered you should wait. The other part—that loud SAR part that starts writing worst-case scenarios the second a hiker is late—was already picturing a broken ankle at the first switchback, a guy sitting in the dark slowly getting hypothermic because I didn’t want to lose sleep.

“Negative for now,” I said. “I’ll hike to first mile marker, see if I pick up his tracks. If he went out at nine, he should’ve been back before dark.”

“Copy. Check in every thirty.”

I clipped the radio back to my vest, tightened my pack straps. The air had that in-between temperature where you know the real cold is waiting just out of sight.

The trail into Cottonwood Wash starts as a gentle slope of packed sand and loose rock, then drops into the creekbed after a quarter mile. In daylight it’s a casual stroll. At night, even with a good light, your world shrinks to a tunnel—the circle in front of your boots, and then nothing.

I stepped past the trailhead sign and felt that shift I always do. The parking lot behind me became a rectangle of lesser darkness. Ahead was just the beam and the unknown.

I picked up his tracks before the first switchback.

Decent hiking boots, not fashion ones. Deep tread, maybe size ten. The sandy stretches between rock patches held his prints like ink. You get used to reading people in their tracks—whether they walked or jogged, how heavy their pack might’ve been, whether they were sightseeing or marching.

For the first half mile, Matthew Klein read like a normal guy out for a long loop. Center of the trail, steady stride, no dragging, no weird pauses. Nothing that said panic. Nothing that said intoxicated or injured.

The canyon was colder than the lot. The rock walls held the cool and let heat bleed off fast. My breath fogged in the beam in short bursts. Somewhere up on the rim, a coyote yipped once and then shut up. I waited to hear the others answer. They didn’t.

At the first mile marker—a battered wooden post with “1” carved into it and a strip of reflective tape peeling away—I checked my watch. 20:26.

“Unit Three,” I said into the radio. “At mile marker one. Subject’s trail still visible and consistent. Continuing toward Ridge Overlook.”

Static hissed. Then dispatch’s voice slid through, muffled and thin.

“—opy, Three. Signal’s get—ing spotty. Check—n at Ridge.”

“Say again?” I turned the volume up.

More static. For a second, I heard my own voice loop back at me, tinny and warped:

“—ridge… ridge—”

That happens sometimes in the canyons too—radios bouncing off rock faces, catching their own echo. I told myself that’s all it was, thumbed the side of the radio like that would make a difference, and kept going.

Half a mile past the marker, the story in the dirt changed.

It started small: a single step off the packed center of the trail, a deeper imprint like he’d stumbled and caught himself. Then another. Then a run of short, choppy steps that veered toward the right, toward the darker line of brush hugging the wash wall.

I swept my light ahead, slowly. The beam caught on a long scuff where something heavy had slid sideways, gouging a shallow trench in the sand.

Matthew’s boot print overlapped the end of it. Toes dug in like he’d pushed, hard.

I crouched, fingers brushing the disturbed sand. The trench went both ways—as if something had been dragged, stopped, and then dragged again.

Beside it, half softened by wind, was another print.

My first thought was coyote. Then big dog. Then… something gave up.

It was a bare foot.

It wasn’t right, though. The toes were too long, with an odd curve to them. The arch of the foot dipped narrow and deep, like it belonged to someone who’d never worn shoes in their life, but the heel print was wrong too, set in a way that didn’t match the weight distribution I’m used to seeing. The deepest point wasn’t at the ball or heel, but along the outer edge, as if whoever it belonged to rolled their weight there.

I felt my stomach tighten.

People hike barefoot. I’ve seen older locals do it, and I’ve seen social media idiots do it so they can say they did. But you don’t see bare human feet out here at 11 p.m. in October.

My light found a second bare footprint farther along, cutting across the trail at an angle. Then a third, half on rock, half in sand. They moved with a strange, loping stride, parallel to Matthew’s for a while, then angling closer.

I swallowed.

“Could be… could be nothing,” I said out loud, which is dumb, but people talk to themselves alone in the field more than they admit. “Could be some kid messing around. Could be erosion. Could be me reading shadows.”

The wind at my back shifted. For a second, just a second, it brought a smell with it that didn’t belong out here: sour and coppery and hot, like a butcher shop that hadn’t been cleaned right. Then it was gone.

The hair on my arms rose under my sleeves.

I swept my light around: canyon walls, brush, the path behind me. Nothing but rock and dark.

“Matthew,” I called, voice louder than before. “Ranger service! If you can hear me, yell or bang on something!”

My words traveled up and out, bounced back thinner, shredded by distance. No other sound answered.

I followed the tracks.

They left the main trail at a break in the rock wall I’ve walked past a hundred times without thinking. The wash narrows there, and there’s a slope of loose rock leading up to a gap between two big sandstone blocks. You can see it on the topo map as a little side drainage, but nobody puts it on the brochures.

Matthew’s boots had climbed it in a hurry—slips, slides, toe digs like he was scrambling. The bare prints followed with a steadier, almost lazy step, each toe splayed in the gravel like they were gripping.

Protocol says: don’t leave the marked trail on a solo night search unless there’s imminent danger. That sentence was in the back of my head. So was the DA’s voice from a training video about “unnecessary exposure to risk.”

But walking away when the tracks clearly went up that slope would mean if he was lying broken twenty yards beyond it, I’d chosen my own safety over his life. Try clocking out with that in your chest.

So I went.

The scree rolled under my boots with every step, tiny rockfalls rattling downslope. Dust got in my teeth. I kept my light low, checking each place I planned to put my weight.

At the top, the gap funneled into a narrow side canyon I’d only ever glanced at in daylight. A vertical slit of shadow between red walls, choked with scrub oak, fallen branches, and old flood debris.

At night, it felt… wrong is the only word that fits.

The air changed as soon as I stepped through. The faint breeze from the main wash died. The temperature dropped a couple degrees. Even the starlight thinned out; the walls leaned over just enough to box it in.

Matthew’s boots and the bare prints ran nearly side by side now, sometimes overlapping. Here and there, small darker spots dotted the sand. I knew what they were before I reached down and touched one with a gloved fingertip.

Blood looks almost black in flashlight beams.

“Matthew!” I yelled again, throat tighter this time. “If you’re hurt, shout! I’m here to help you!”

Something answered me.

Not words. Not quite.

It rose up from somewhere ahead and above, a thin keening that sounded like it had been fed through too many speakers in a row and come out damaged. It wasn’t a coyote. It wasn’t the wind. It had the cadence of a sob but none of the shape.

It bounced off the canyon walls and came back in fragments. My skin crawled.

I told myself it could be wind tearing past a crack in the rock. Could be an injured animal. Could be anything besides the thing my brain was edging toward.

My body didn’t care what label I put on it. My feet were already moving toward the sound.

I don’t know how far that side canyon goes in daylight. At night, distance just stops meaning anything. My watch said I walked another ten minutes. My lungs and legs said thirty.

Around a bend, the walls peeled back into a bowl-shaped clearing, maybe thirty yards across. The floor was a mess of scrub, deadfall, and old flood lines. In the center, half-collapsed and furred with lichen, was a ring of stone.

It wasn’t one of our fire rings. Too big, too tall, too deliberate. Knee to chest high slabs of rock, set in a near-perfect circle, all leaning inward just a little, like they’d been shoved and decided not to fall after all. Some had shallow marks carved into them, so worn you couldn’t tell if they’d ever meant anything.

I stopped on the edge of it, pulse thudding in my throat.

My light picked up a bright slash of color against one upright stone. For a second, my brain said trash. Then it clicked.

A torn scrap of neon orange fabric. High-vis nylon, the kind every REI mannequin wears in October. It was stuck to the rough rock with something dried and dark. The edges were ragged, as if it had been chewed or shredded by hand.

Near it, at the base of the stone, the sand showed a wide smear, as if something heavy had been dragged and pivoted there. Matthew’s boot prints walked up to that spot and ended.

The bare prints didn’t. They were everywhere. In the dust, on the flat stones, circling the ring, doubling back over themselves. Some were deeper, the toes clawed in like whatever had made them had pushed hard, maybe to leap.

That broken keening sound rose again.

This time it came from above me.

I tilted my head back, lifting the light.

At first my brain tried to make it a tree branch. A human shadow. Anything.

Something clung to a narrow ledge maybe ten feet above the ring. Pale limbs bent at angles that made my joints ache just looking. It was pressed flat to the rock in a way that didn’t seem like it should be possible. My beam slid over it once, twice, before the details assembled into the idea of a body.

Its head turned before the rest of it did, jerking around quick and then stopping too suddenly. The eyes caught my light and reflected it back, flat and bright, like marbles.

It wore part of a jacket. Neon orange, ripped almost in half down the center. One sleeve hung empty and shredded.

The torso under it was narrow. Too narrow. Ribs showed under skin that looked too tight, but in other places the skin bunched and folded like it had extra it didn’t know what to do with.

The face—

I still can’t quite hold the face in my head. When I try, I get pieces.

There was a jaw. Eye sockets. Cheekbones. But everything was a little off, like someone had assembled a face from memory and gotten the spacing wrong. The nose sat too high. One eye socket was wider than the other. The mouth sloped—higher on one side, lower on the other—as if whoever had cut it hadn’t drawn the line straight.

Its lips moved.

That thin, wrong sobbing noise came out, but the mouth barely opened. The sound didn’t match the shape.

For a few seconds we just stared at each other: my light pinning it on the ledge, it staring back with its head tilted at the same angle as mine.

Then it let go.

It dropped straight down into the stone circle. No scramble, no preparing for impact. It just released and hit in a crouch. I waited for the thump, for gravel scattering.

Nothing. Or if there was a sound, I didn’t hear it through the thudding in my ears.

Up close, the smell hit me like a wall. Wet fur, copper, and something else—old earth maybe, the way a cellar smells when it’s been shut up for too long.

I don’t remember deciding to unclasp my holster, but suddenly my handgun was in my hand, my fingers slick on the grip.

Training says you back away slowly, keep your weapon up, keep your voice calm. You don’t talk to unknown animals like they’re people.

I heard myself say, “Matthew?” anyway.

The thing’s head twitched to the side. The movement was too sharp, like someone had cut a frame out of its animation. Its eyes flicked down to the gun, then back to my face.

Its mouth worked. The sound coming out changed. Less like a broken sob, more like… someone trying to push air through a throat that wasn’t built right.

“Matt—” it said.

The word came out crushed and stretched, like someone had taken a recording and pulled the waveform. The “t” was barely there; the vowel dragged too long. It sounded like someone trying to talk underwater.

“I… I can help you,” I heard myself stammer. My voice sounded like it belonged to someone else. “Just… just stay where you are.”

I took a step back.

It took one forward.

The bare feet left clean prints in the dust between the stones. Up close, the skin there looked wrong too. Too thin and shiny in some spots, thick and almost scaly in others. On one ankle there was a faint line, a seam where the texture changed abruptly from something smooth and human to something rougher, like animal hide.

My flashlight beam shook. The stones cast hard-edged shadows over its body, hiding pieces of it and then showing them again in a stuttering rhythm as I tried to keep the light steady.

Somewhere behind me, far out in the main wash, the wind started up again. It slid around the corner of the canyon and over the bowl, cold and thin on the sweat at the back of my neck.

“Stop,” I said, raising the gun. “Don’t come any closer. I’m not kidding.”

The thing’s jaw flexed. Its lips peeled back a fraction too far, exposing teeth that were mostly the right shape and size but sat just a little off, one turned, one slightly higher than the rest. The skin at the corners of its mouth tore as it stretched, hairline cracks opening and leaking something dark that wasn’t the bright fresh red I expected.

The keening cut off.

The silence that dropped in its place was heavy in a way air shouldn’t be.

Then, very clearly, it said:

“Help.”

Not like someone begging.

Like someone testing a word they’d practiced.

I’d love to tell you I fired.

That I put two rounds center mass, that it dropped, that we hauled a body out and tagged it and sent it off to a lab and now I can point to a report and say “This is what that was.”

Instead, the part of me that has nothing to do with training—the old part, the prey-animal part—took over.

I turned and ran.

The next few minutes exist in my memory like a series of still photos. My boots hitting the canyon floor. My pack slamming between my shoulders. My flashlight beam jerking over rocks and dead branches and the mouths of side cracks.

Behind me, something moved. At first there was a noise like someone pulling themselves free from deep mud, a wet suction sound. Then the patter of feet.

More than two. Faster than I wanted to believe anything on two legs could move on that terrain.

I didn’t look back. I knew if I did my brain would freeze and my body would follow.

The narrow part of the side canyon came up too fast. I clipped my shoulder on one wall, bounced off the other, skinning my knuckles. Pain flared bright and stupid and somehow helped, because it made everything feel real again.

The main wash opened ahead in a slice of slightly lighter dark. The strip of sky above got wider. Stars were just pinpricks between canyon rims, but they were there.

My radio exploded with static against my chest.

“—son? Carson, you copy? We lost you on three, are you—”

“Three!” I yelled, no call-sign discipline left. “Unit Three, I am in Cottonwood side canyon, I’ve encountered—” I had to swallow to get the next words out. “Encountered something, possible subject, unknown animal, I am retreating, requesting immediate—”

Static swallowed the rest. The radio screeched in my ear. For a second, under the noise, I heard another voice—my own, or something mimicking it—repeat “unknown” back at me, stretched and warped.

Behind me, closer than I wanted to know, that broken voice called out.

“Help—help—Car—”

It said my name like it was chewing it.

I don’t remember deciding to slow down. I do remember my knee blowing up with pain as I misjudged a step and my right foot skidded on loose gravel. I went down hard. Something in my knee popped and the world went white around the edges.

I grabbed a juniper branch and used it to haul myself up. My leg screamed. The smart move would’ve been to stop, get my bearings, maybe find cover.

I kept moving.

You can’t sprint blind through a canyon and expect to survive. Every instinct screamed run as fast as you can. The rest of me knew if I broke into a full panicked scramble, I’d miss a turn and go off into a side ravine or over a ledge.

So I forced myself to do the thing I always tell new rangers in training: “Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.” Or however that saying actually goes. It feels like garbage when something is chasing you, but it keeps you alive.

“Watch the trail,” I muttered, breath ragged. “Landmarks. You know this place. You’ve been here a hundred times.”

The first mile marker came into view like a hallucination, reflective tape winking in my beam. If I’d had spare oxygen I probably would’ve laughed.

“Halfway,” I told myself. “Just halfway. Keep going.”

Something moved at the edge of my light, up on the slope.

I swung the beam toward it.

For a second I thought the juniper trunks were playing tricks on me. Then it stepped out from behind one.

It stood on the slope above the trail, maybe twenty yards away. The torn orange of the jacket glowed faintly against its chest. Its limbs looked longer than they had in the stone circle, joints set at slightly different angles, like the act of moving had rearranged them.

Its head was cocked. Its eyes didn’t glow like an animal’s this time. They just… absorbed the light. Too still. Too intent.

We stared at each other for one, two heartbeats.

Then it moved.

Not toward me.

Parallel.

It began to walk the contour line, up on the slope, matching my position as I started down-trail again. Same pace, same distance. Every time I flicked the light that way, it was there, just outside the center of the beam.

I’ve watched mountain lions shadow people before. I’ve seen coyotes trot along a ridge, keeping a hunter in sight. This was like that, and not like that at all. There was no curious tilt, no animal caution. It felt… clinical. Like it was observing.

Like it’d decided running me down wasn’t as interesting as seeing what I’d do.

I kept my eyes mostly on the trail, checking every few seconds that it was still there and not suddenly closer. My heart hammered. My knee ached with every step. The urge to bolt full-out almost shook my teeth.

Morales’s voice came back to me out of nowhere—us at the picnic table behind the station on a dead afternoon, her rolling a cigarette between her fingers, talking about the stories her grandmother used to tell.

“Stuff out there that walks on two legs and four, and you don’t say the name,” she’d said. “You don’t look at it if you can help it. You sure as hell don’t talk to it. If it knows you know, that’s when you’ve got a problem.”

I’d made some dumb joke about already having enough to worry about with tourists.

I didn’t feel like laughing now.

I didn’t talk. I didn’t raise the radio again. I didn’t shoot.

The trail curved left, then right. The rectangle of open sky that meant the trailhead lot was close crept into view in front of me, pale compared to the canyon.

Above me, the thing stopped.

I looked up before I could stop myself.

It stood at the very edge of the slope, toes almost over the drop. In my light, its eyes had gone reflective again, picking up just enough glow to look wrong.

Its chest rose and fell once.

Then it opened its mouth.

The sound that came out wasn’t a scream the way you think of a scream. It was a steady, high, piercing tone, a sound so sharp it made the fillings in my molars ache. It didn’t rise or fall; it just held, like a test tone in your inner ear.

Underneath it, I heard something else.

Layered. Fainter. A murmur that might have been voices stacked on top of each other, like a crowd recorded from too far away. Some sounded like they were crying, some like they were laughing, but none of the emotion matched the tone. It was all wrong.

The world narrowed to that noise and the rectangle of the trailhead lot ahead.

My legs did the choosing for me. I ran.

The tone cut off midstream, like someone had yanked a cable. The sudden silence was almost a physical hit.

I sprinted the last stretch, my knee protesting with every jolt. Adrenaline did what ibuprofen can’t.

Then I was out.

I burst into the parking lot like I’d stepped through a door. The truck, the pit toilet, the bullet-riddled “NO SHOOTING” sign—everything ordinary and stupid and real—appeared all at once.

My flashlight beam slammed into the side of the blue Subaru, bounced to the bulletin board, swung over the hood of my truck.

My thermos was still on the seat where I’d left it, silver catching the light. For some reason that almost undid me more than anything else.

The radio at my shoulder clicked.

“Three? Carson? You copy? We lost you for a good ten minutes there.”

My knees finally gave out.

I dropped onto the dirt by the truck, one hand catching the bumper to keep myself from faceplanting. The radio dug into my chest where the harness had shifted, the antenna jabbing under my jaw. My boot knocked the thermos off the seat when I leaned in; it hit the floorboard with a dull thunk I felt in my teeth.

“Three,” I gasped. “At trailhead. I am at the lot. Subject not found. Unknown animal in area. I repeat, unknown animal, aggressive behavior. Request backup. Lots of backup.”

I wasn’t proud of how that last bit came out.

“Copy, Three,” dispatch said, clearly exhaling into the mic. “Morales is en route. County deputies notified. ETA twenty to twenty-five. Stay in your vehicle. Do not re-enter the trail.”

“Affirmative,” I said, and it came out more like a wheeze than a word.

I hauled myself upright, using the truck’s side mirror. My reflection looked worse than I felt—sweat plastered dark hair to my forehead, a smear of blood on one knuckle, dust all up my pants, eyes wide.

The Subaru sat silent and patient.

For reasons I didn’t examine too closely right then, I walked over to the driver’s side and cupped my hands to peer inside. The door was locked. Through the glass I could see a rental agreement on the passenger seat with the logo from a Phoenix airport rental place, a half-empty Arrowhead water bottle, and a dog-eared Rand McNally atlas folded open to northern Arizona.

On the back seat was an orange jacket. Or what was left of it.

The main body of it had been stuffed in there in a hurry, still zipped. Both sleeves were shredded, long diagonal tears running from cuff to shoulder. The nylon was stiff and dark in patches. Someone had tried to wipe it off and given up. The drying made it pucker.

I stared at it for long enough that Morales’s headlights coming up the road made me jump.

I didn’t tell Morales everything that night.

I told her I’d followed the subject’s tracks to an unmarked side canyon, heard what I thought was an injured person, found blood and torn clothing and signs of a struggle. I told her something large had shadowed me on the way out, that I hadn’t seen it clearly, that it might have been a mountain lion acting strange.

She looked at my face for a second longer than was comfortable, then nodded once.

“Okay,” she said. “Animal. Fine. You’re limping. You’re not going back in.”

The deputies pulled in behind her, doors slamming, radios chirping. Their floodlights turned the trailhead into a stage. I watched them fan out with rifles and spotlights, young, confident, joking under their breath because that’s how you keep nerves down.

We ran a full search the next day. Dogs, volunteers, every ranger we could spare. The sun was bright, the sky cloudless. The side canyon looked smaller in daylight, its shadows shallow.

We found the stone ring. We found the blood. We found more of the jacket jammed into a rock crack like someone had tried to hide it.

We didn’t find Matthew.

The dogs didn’t like the circle. They’d approach to about ten feet, then balk and whine, hackles up. One of the deputies joked about “bad vibes.” Morales didn’t laugh.

The official story settled on “probable animal predation.” The report lists cougar as the likely culprit with one of those cover-your-ass lines: “Though no conclusive physical evidence of the animal was recovered, behavior and sign are consistent with known predation events.”

If you read the report, it sounds tidy. Guy goes hiking, meets big cat, doesn’t come home. Happens more than people think.

The messy parts stayed in my head.

His girlfriend came out twice over the next month.

The first time, she met with the sheriff, nodded through all the phrases—“ongoing investigation,” “low probability,” “we’ll keep you updated.” The second time, she drove out alone in a dusty Corolla and stood at the trailhead for a long time, just looking at the sign.

I was coming off a patrol and didn’t want to bother her. She came over to me instead.

“Were you the ranger on call?” she asked.

“Yeah,” I said. “Carson.”

She shook my hand. Grip tight, like it was the only thing keeping her upright.

“Matt’s… he likes to push things,” she said, staring at the bulletin board. “Always has. But he’s not stupid. He told me he’d be out before dark. He texted me from the lot.”

“He signed out ‘by five,’” I said, then wished I hadn’t. It sounded petty out loud.

She nodded once like that hurt. “That’s him. Little promises.”

She pulled something from her bag—a scrap of paper, folded small—and pinned it to the corner of the corkboard with a thumbtack she’d brought. Her hands were shaking.

Later, after she drove off, I went to see what it said.

Three words, in uneven handwriting:

IT SPARED ME. UNDERSTAND?

For a second my brain just shrugged. Then it sorted through its filing cabinet and pulled out a memory from months before.

A different call. Different landscape. Central Idaho, snowmelt below a slide path. We found a man standing in water up to his waist, lips almost blue, pants shredded, no boots. He refused food, refused to give a name, just stared at the tent wall and repeated the same line over and over.

“It spared me. It spared me. It spared me.”

He might have added something else—I can’t remember the exact order now. Shock scrambles people. Either way, that phrase stuck.

I’d chalked it up to hypothermia. People say weird things when they’re that cold. Now, staring at that note with the tack barely holding it, my skin crawled.

I didn’t tell her any of that. What was I going to do—say “Hey, your boyfriend and some half-frozen stranger might’ve met the same thing, congratulations”?

I took the note down two weeks later when it started to curl and bleed ink from the weather. I put it in my desk drawer. It’s still there.

Sometimes I knock my thermos against that drawer by accident in the mornings and the sound makes my shoulders tense before I remember why.

There’s one more part I haven’t told anyone.

About a week after we officially called the search and shifted the documentation over to “recovery unlikely,” I went back to Cottonwood Wash on a day off.

Middle of the day. Blue sky, no clouds. Temperatures in the high sixties. Nothing creepy about it on paper.

I didn’t sign in on the sheet. I know, I know. Practice what you preach. I told myself if anyone asked I’d say I forgot.

I walked the main trail with just my daypack, no radio. My knee ached halfway to the mile marker, a deep dull throb that still flares when the weather changes. I told myself that was why I was breathing harder, not nerves.

When I reached the point where Matthew’s prints had left the trail, I stopped.

The side canyon entrance looked smaller in daylight. Just another scruffy cut in the rock, choked with scrub oak and old flood trash. If you didn’t know, you’d walk right past it forever.

I didn’t go in.

I stood at the mouth of it and listened.

At first, nothing. Just wind moving through the main wash, a couple of scrub jays arguing upcanyon. My heart ticking in my ears.

Then, from somewhere deeper in, far enough that it couldn’t be an echo from the main trail, I heard a sound I’d been waiting for without admitting it.

A thin, strangled call.

“Help.”

Almost clear this time. The consonants hit in the right places. The vowel didn’t drag as much.

It didn’t sound like begging.

It sounded like someone practicing a word until they liked how it felt.

I left. I didn’t run, but it was a close thing.

People online love to argue about labels. Skinwalker, wendigo, crawler, “fleshgait,” whatever the latest YouTube channel calls it. They want a name so they can categorize it, put it in a box with lore and rules and bullet points.

You’re probably wondering what I think it was.

I’m not Navajo. I didn’t grow up with those stories in a way I have the right to explain them. Morales did. I’ve seen her face tighten when tourists throw the S-word around like it’s a mascot.

I won’t call it that. That’s not my word.

I’ll tell you what I know.

I’ve worked around mountain lions, black bears, feral hogs. I’ve seen what coyotes do to calves. I know the difference between an animal hunting because it’s hungry and something toying with you.

What watched me in that canyon wasn’t just thinking about eating.

It was studying.

It moved like it was still figuring out how to wear what it was wearing. Like it had put on a skin—maybe more than one—and the seams didn’t quite match. The voice it used didn’t belong to a single throat. It sounded like it was made out of pieces.

And when it said my name, I’m sure of one thing:

It wasn’t repeating it back blindly. It was trying it on.

These days, when an overdue hiker call comes in near dusk and dispatch says “Cottonwood” and “trailhead” in the same sentence, I suddenly remember paperwork I’ve been putting off, or a training module I promised to finish, or my knee starts acting up.

The younger rangers roll their eyes. They tell me I’m getting soft. Morales just gives me a look like she’s not sure if she wants to know why.

On the nights I can’t duck it and I find myself driving past the COTTONWOOD WASH STATE PARK sign, past the CCC ruins, past the bulletin board with a fresh stack of sign-in sheets, I keep my eyes on the road.

I don’t look at the gap in the rock wall where the side canyon starts. I don’t glance at the slope where something once walked parallel to me, matching my pace.

And when the radio crackles in that stretch, picking up half a word or my own voice delayed and warbling, I turn the volume up just enough to drown out anything else that might be trying to learn how to say my name.",0,1762738001.0,ZakBabyTV_Stories,0,0.5,False

Anyway, I had a great time! I really wish I would have taken more pictures because the place was so cute and cozy. I don’t have a plushie yet or any physical representation on him besides my bracelet, so I mostly just tried to improvise and spend time with him in other ways. I mostly “talked” to him through his game for a little bit and listened to his voice lines while I ate and did some yume templates.

On paper, I’m still a ranger with the state parks department. My badge says “Senior Ranger,” my contract says backcountry specialist, but after what happened last October I started volunteering for every maintenance shift that keeps me within sight of a road and a crowd.

There’s an incident report for it. It’s in a binder behind the front desk, third shelf down, page for October 19th. If you flipped to it, this is what you’d see:

“Ranger Carson Hale responded to an overdue hiker call from the Cottonwood Wash Trailhead, returned at 07:12 hours, report of possible animal activity, ongoing missing persons case.”

That’s the neat version. The version for supervisors and lawyers and anyone who needs closure that fits on a line.

Everything else I’m putting here because I can’t sleep when it’s quiet anymore.

That day started like every other shoulder-season Thursday.

I was at the station doing the usual nonsense: answering the same questions about whether we have bears (“Yes”), whether we have wolves (“No”), and whether their dog can be off-leash (“Also no, I don’t care how friendly he is”). I filled out a maintenance request for the busted faucet by the campground, dug through the lost and found for a kid’s left sandal, and tried not to think too hard about how much of my job is being an underpaid hall monitor with a radio.

We’re a small park wedged between national forest and reservation land—a chunk of canyons and piñon, dry creekbeds and sandstone ledges. You drive east from town, past the Family Dollar and the last Circle K, hit the brown sign for COTTONWOOD WASH STATE PARK, and then it’s seven more miles on a two-lane that turns to washboard dirt if you miss the turn.

October’s our almost-quiet month. Cool days, cold nights, tourists thinning out but not gone. Enough people to keep the lights on, not enough to justify overtime.

Around 6:30 p.m., I’d just poured the last of the coffee from the station pot into my dented stainless thermos. It was already lukewarm and tasted like metal and burnt beans, but I’m not picky. I screwed the lid on, told myself I’d reheat it later, and we both know I wasn’t going to.

I was halfway through the shift-change checklist when dispatch crackled over the base station.

“Unit Three, you still at the station?”

I thumbed my handheld. “Yeah, go ahead.”

“Got a call from county sheriff. Overdue hiker. Vehicle registered to a Matthew Klein, age thirty-four. Parked at Cottonwood Wash trailhead since 09:17 this morning. No contact. Girlfriend called it in about twenty minutes ago.”

I glanced at the wall clock. 19:42. Outside the office window the sky was a strip of dull purple over the ridge, sun already gone. Morales—night shift—was still tied up on a poaching complaint up in the north sector. She’d told me over the radio an hour earlier she was “knee-deep in camo idiots and shell casings.”

“All right,” I said. “I’ll check the lot, see if he signed in. Maybe he just took the loop slow.”

“You sure?” Dispatch sounded tired but concerned. “You’d be solo out there, Three.”

“Just a quick sweep to the first marker,” I said. “I won’t go stupid deep.”

The lie came out easy. It always does when you tell yourself you’re just checking.

I keep my pack under the desk, half out of habit and half because if I put it away somewhere “proper” I’ll forget something. First aid kit, trauma shears, SAM splint, extra water, tarp, a coil of paracord I always call a bowline when I show the junior ranger kids, even though it’s not. I know it’s not. My brain grabs the wrong knot every single time I’ve got an audience.

I slung the pack over one shoulder, grabbed the SAR radio and a printed map from the rack even though I can draw the trails from memory, and signed myself out on the board:

CARSON – COTTONWOOD WASH – OVERDUE HIKER – 19:50

The drive out felt longer than usual.

Headlights carved through sage and rabbitbrush, catching the odd jackrabbit frozen in the beam before it bolted. The pavement gave up about four miles out; the truck bounced as tires hit hard-packed washboard. I passed the old CCC bathhouse ruins on the left—a crumbling line of stone and a rusted interpretive sign. I always think it’s WPA work until I kneel down and see the nail head stamped “1937 CCC” and remember I’ve had that exact thought before.

Nobody else was out there. No other vehicles. No porch lights on the distant ranch houses. No campfire glow. Just the road and the dark shapes of mesas hemming it in.

The handheld rode on the passenger seat by my thermos, volume low, dispatch chatter a tinny murmur. The coffee had gone from lukewarm to cold; I took a swallow anyway out of habit and grimaced.

I pulled into the Cottonwood Wash trailhead lot at 20:03.

One vehicle sat there: a blue Subaru Outback with a rental barcode sticker on the rear window. Thin coat of dust, no tracks behind the tires. Hood cold when I put my hand on it.

I swung the truck so the headlights washed over the bulletin board and trailhead sign. The board was the usual mess—faded fire danger meter, “WATCH FOR RATTLESNAKES” poster, a missing-dog flyer someone had taped up three months ago. The wind barely moved. The cottonwoods along the dry creekbed might as well have been painted on.

I grabbed my flashlight, clicked it on, and walked over to the sign-in box. We don’t force people to log in and out, but we encourage it. Sometimes it saves hours. Sometimes it doesn’t help at all.

The sheet inside was almost full. I flipped past the earlier entries until I saw it.

NAME: MATTHEW KLEIN
TIME OUT: 09:30
DESTINATION: LOOP TO RIDGE OVERLOOK
EXPECTED RETURN: BY 5

I don’t know why that “BY 5” snagged in my head. People usually scribble “afternoon” or don’t bother. The way he wrote it made it look like a promise. Like he’d told someone, I’ll be out by five, I swear.

“Unit Three at Cottonwood trailhead,” I said into the radio. “Subject’s vehicle present, name matches sign-in. No sign of subject at lot.”

“Copy, Three,” dispatch answered. “You requesting secondary unit?”

I looked out at the trail sign, the dark mouth of the path dropping into the wash. The part of my brain that likes checklists and procedures whispered you should wait. The other part—that loud SAR part that starts writing worst-case scenarios the second a hiker is late—was already picturing a broken ankle at the first switchback, a guy sitting in the dark slowly getting hypothermic because I didn’t want to lose sleep.

“Negative for now,” I said. “I’ll hike to first mile marker, see if I pick up his tracks. If he went out at nine, he should’ve been back before dark.”

“Copy. Check in every thirty.”

I clipped the radio back to my vest, tightened my pack straps. The air had that in-between temperature where you know the real cold is waiting just out of sight.

The trail into Cottonwood Wash starts as a gentle slope of packed sand and loose rock, then drops into the creekbed after a quarter mile. In daylight it’s a casual stroll. At night, even with a good light, your world shrinks to a tunnel—the circle in front of your boots, and then nothing.

I stepped past the trailhead sign and felt that shift I always do. The parking lot behind me became a rectangle of lesser darkness. Ahead was just the beam and the unknown.

I picked up his tracks before the first switchback.

Decent hiking boots, not fashion ones. Deep tread, maybe size ten. The sandy stretches between rock patches held his prints like ink. You get used to reading people in their tracks—whether they walked or jogged, how heavy their pack might’ve been, whether they were sightseeing or marching.

For the first half mile, Matthew Klein read like a normal guy out for a long loop. Center of the trail, steady stride, no dragging, no weird pauses. Nothing that said panic. Nothing that said intoxicated or injured.

The canyon was colder than the lot. The rock walls held the cool and let heat bleed off fast. My breath fogged in the beam in short bursts. Somewhere up on the rim, a coyote yipped once and then shut up. I waited to hear the others answer. They didn’t.

At the first mile marker—a battered wooden post with “1” carved into it and a strip of reflective tape peeling away—I checked my watch. 20:26.

“Unit Three,” I said into the radio. “At mile marker one. Subject’s trail still visible and consistent. Continuing toward Ridge Overlook.”

Static hissed. Then dispatch’s voice slid through, muffled and thin.

“—opy, Three. Signal’s get—ing spotty. Check—n at Ridge.”

“Say again?” I turned the volume up.

More static. For a second, I heard my own voice loop back at me, tinny and warped:

“—ridge… ridge—”

That happens sometimes in the canyons too—radios bouncing off rock faces, catching their own echo. I told myself that’s all it was, thumbed the side of the radio like that would make a difference, and kept going.

Half a mile past the marker, the story in the dirt changed.

It started small: a single step off the packed center of the trail, a deeper imprint like he’d stumbled and caught himself. Then another. Then a run of short, choppy steps that veered toward the right, toward the darker line of brush hugging the wash wall.

I swept my light ahead, slowly. The beam caught on a long scuff where something heavy had slid sideways, gouging a shallow trench in the sand.

Matthew’s boot print overlapped the end of it. Toes dug in like he’d pushed, hard.

I crouched, fingers brushing the disturbed sand. The trench went both ways—as if something had been dragged, stopped, and then dragged again.

Beside it, half softened by wind, was another print.

My first thought was coyote. Then big dog. Then… something gave up.

It was a bare foot.

It wasn’t right, though. The toes were too long, with an odd curve to them. The arch of the foot dipped narrow and deep, like it belonged to someone who’d never worn shoes in their life, but the heel print was wrong too, set in a way that didn’t match the weight distribution I’m used to seeing. The deepest point wasn’t at the ball or heel, but along the outer edge, as if whoever it belonged to rolled their weight there.

I felt my stomach tighten.

People hike barefoot. I’ve seen older locals do it, and I’ve seen social media idiots do it so they can say they did. But you don’t see bare human feet out here at 11 p.m. in October.

My light found a second bare footprint farther along, cutting across the trail at an angle. Then a third, half on rock, half in sand. They moved with a strange, loping stride, parallel to Matthew’s for a while, then angling closer.

I swallowed.

“Could be… could be nothing,” I said out loud, which is dumb, but people talk to themselves alone in the field more than they admit. “Could be some kid messing around. Could be erosion. Could be me reading shadows.”

The wind at my back shifted. For a second, just a second, it brought a smell with it that didn’t belong out here: sour and coppery and hot, like a butcher shop that hadn’t been cleaned right. Then it was gone.

The hair on my arms rose under my sleeves.

I swept my light around: canyon walls, brush, the path behind me. Nothing but rock and dark.

“Matthew,” I called, voice louder than before. “Ranger service! If you can hear me, yell or bang on something!”

My words traveled up and out, bounced back thinner, shredded by distance. No other sound answered.

I followed the tracks.

They left the main trail at a break in the rock wall I’ve walked past a hundred times without thinking. The wash narrows there, and there’s a slope of loose rock leading up to a gap between two big sandstone blocks. You can see it on the topo map as a little side drainage, but nobody puts it on the brochures.

Matthew’s boots had climbed it in a hurry—slips, slides, toe digs like he was scrambling. The bare prints followed with a steadier, almost lazy step, each toe splayed in the gravel like they were gripping.

Protocol says: don’t leave the marked trail on a solo night search unless there’s imminent danger. That sentence was in the back of my head. So was the DA’s voice from a training video about “unnecessary exposure to risk.”

But walking away when the tracks clearly went up that slope would mean if he was lying broken twenty yards beyond it, I’d chosen my own safety over his life. Try clocking out with that in your chest.

So I went.

The scree rolled under my boots with every step, tiny rockfalls rattling downslope. Dust got in my teeth. I kept my light low, checking each place I planned to put my weight.

At the top, the gap funneled into a narrow side canyon I’d only ever glanced at in daylight. A vertical slit of shadow between red walls, choked with scrub oak, fallen branches, and old flood debris.

At night, it felt… wrong is the only word that fits.

The air changed as soon as I stepped through. The faint breeze from the main wash died. The temperature dropped a couple degrees. Even the starlight thinned out; the walls leaned over just enough to box it in.

Matthew’s boots and the bare prints ran nearly side by side now, sometimes overlapping. Here and there, small darker spots dotted the sand. I knew what they were before I reached down and touched one with a gloved fingertip.

Blood looks almost black in flashlight beams.

“Matthew!” I yelled again, throat tighter this time. “If you’re hurt, shout! I’m here to help you!”

Something answered me.

Not words. Not quite.

It rose up from somewhere ahead and above, a thin keening that sounded like it had been fed through too many speakers in a row and come out damaged. It wasn’t a coyote. It wasn’t the wind. It had the cadence of a sob but none of the shape.

It bounced off the canyon walls and came back in fragments. My skin crawled.

I told myself it could be wind tearing past a crack in the rock. Could be an injured animal. Could be anything besides the thing my brain was edging toward.

My body didn’t care what label I put on it. My feet were already moving toward the sound.

I don’t know how far that side canyon goes in daylight. At night, distance just stops meaning anything. My watch said I walked another ten minutes. My lungs and legs said thirty.

Around a bend, the walls peeled back into a bowl-shaped clearing, maybe thirty yards across. The floor was a mess of scrub, deadfall, and old flood lines. In the center, half-collapsed and furred with lichen, was a ring of stone.

It wasn’t one of our fire rings. Too big, too tall, too deliberate. Knee to chest high slabs of rock, set in a near-perfect circle, all leaning inward just a little, like they’d been shoved and decided not to fall after all. Some had shallow marks carved into them, so worn you couldn’t tell if they’d ever meant anything.

I stopped on the edge of it, pulse thudding in my throat.

My light picked up a bright slash of color against one upright stone. For a second, my brain said trash. Then it clicked.

A torn scrap of neon orange fabric. High-vis nylon, the kind every REI mannequin wears in October. It was stuck to the rough rock with something dried and dark. The edges were ragged, as if it had been chewed or shredded by hand.

Near it, at the base of the stone, the sand showed a wide smear, as if something heavy had been dragged and pivoted there. Matthew’s boot prints walked up to that spot and ended.

The bare prints didn’t. They were everywhere. In the dust, on the flat stones, circling the ring, doubling back over themselves. Some were deeper, the toes clawed in like whatever had made them had pushed hard, maybe to leap.

That broken keening sound rose again.

This time it came from above me.

I tilted my head back, lifting the light.

At first my brain tried to make it a tree branch. A human shadow. Anything.

Something clung to a narrow ledge maybe ten feet above the ring. Pale limbs bent at angles that made my joints ache just looking. It was pressed flat to the rock in a way that didn’t seem like it should be possible. My beam slid over it once, twice, before the details assembled into the idea of a body.

Its head turned before the rest of it did, jerking around quick and then stopping too suddenly. The eyes caught my light and reflected it back, flat and bright, like marbles.

It wore part of a jacket. Neon orange, ripped almost in half down the center. One sleeve hung empty and shredded.

The torso under it was narrow. Too narrow. Ribs showed under skin that looked too tight, but in other places the skin bunched and folded like it had extra it didn’t know what to do with.

The face—

I still can’t quite hold the face in my head. When I try, I get pieces.

There was a jaw. Eye sockets. Cheekbones. But everything was a little off, like someone had assembled a face from memory and gotten the spacing wrong. The nose sat too high. One eye socket was wider than the other. The mouth sloped—higher on one side, lower on the other—as if whoever had cut it hadn’t drawn the line straight.

Its lips moved.

That thin, wrong sobbing noise came out, but the mouth barely opened. The sound didn’t match the shape.

For a few seconds we just stared at each other: my light pinning it on the ledge, it staring back with its head tilted at the same angle as mine.

Then it let go.

It dropped straight down into the stone circle. No scramble, no preparing for impact. It just released and hit in a crouch. I waited for the thump, for gravel scattering.

Nothing. Or if there was a sound, I didn’t hear it through the thudding in my ears.

Up close, the smell hit me like a wall. Wet fur, copper, and something else—old earth maybe, the way a cellar smells when it’s been shut up for too long.

I don’t remember deciding to unclasp my holster, but suddenly my handgun was in my hand, my fingers slick on the grip.

Training says you back away slowly, keep your weapon up, keep your voice calm. You don’t talk to unknown animals like they’re people.

I heard myself say, “Matthew?” anyway.

The thing’s head twitched to the side. The movement was too sharp, like someone had cut a frame out of its animation. Its eyes flicked down to the gun, then back to my face.

Its mouth worked. The sound coming out changed. Less like a broken sob, more like… someone trying to push air through a throat that wasn’t built right.

“Matt—” it said.

The word came out crushed and stretched, like someone had taken a recording and pulled the waveform. The “t” was barely there; the vowel dragged too long. It sounded like someone trying to talk underwater.

“I… I can help you,” I heard myself stammer. My voice sounded like it belonged to someone else. “Just… just stay where you are.”

I took a step back.

It took one forward.

The bare feet left clean prints in the dust between the stones. Up close, the skin there looked wrong too. Too thin and shiny in some spots, thick and almost scaly in others. On one ankle there was a faint line, a seam where the texture changed abruptly from something smooth and human to something rougher, like animal hide.

My flashlight beam shook. The stones cast hard-edged shadows over its body, hiding pieces of it and then showing them again in a stuttering rhythm as I tried to keep the light steady.

Somewhere behind me, far out in the main wash, the wind started up again. It slid around the corner of the canyon and over the bowl, cold and thin on the sweat at the back of my neck.

“Stop,” I said, raising the gun. “Don’t come any closer. I’m not kidding.”

The thing’s jaw flexed. Its lips peeled back a fraction too far, exposing teeth that were mostly the right shape and size but sat just a little off, one turned, one slightly higher than the rest. The skin at the corners of its mouth tore as it stretched, hairline cracks opening and leaking something dark that wasn’t the bright fresh red I expected.

The keening cut off.

The silence that dropped in its place was heavy in a way air shouldn’t be.

Then, very clearly, it said:

“Help.”

Not like someone begging.

Like someone testing a word they’d practiced.

I’d love to tell you I fired.

That I put two rounds center mass, that it dropped, that we hauled a body out and tagged it and sent it off to a lab and now I can point to a report and say “This is what that was.”

Instead, the part of me that has nothing to do with training—the old part, the prey-animal part—took over.

I turned and ran.

The next few minutes exist in my memory like a series of still photos. My boots hitting the canyon floor. My pack slamming between my shoulders. My flashlight beam jerking over rocks and dead branches and the mouths of side cracks.

Behind me, something moved. At first there was a noise like someone pulling themselves free from deep mud, a wet suction sound. Then the patter of feet.

More than two. Faster than I wanted to believe anything on two legs could move on that terrain.

I didn’t look back. I knew if I did my brain would freeze and my body would follow.

The narrow part of the side canyon came up too fast. I clipped my shoulder on one wall, bounced off the other, skinning my knuckles. Pain flared bright and stupid and somehow helped, because it made everything feel real again.

The main wash opened ahead in a slice of slightly lighter dark. The strip of sky above got wider. Stars were just pinpricks between canyon rims, but they were there.

My radio exploded with static against my chest.

“—son? Carson, you copy? We lost you on three, are you—”

“Three!” I yelled, no call-sign discipline left. “Unit Three, I am in Cottonwood side canyon, I’ve encountered—” I had to swallow to get the next words out. “Encountered something, possible subject, unknown animal, I am retreating, requesting immediate—”

Static swallowed the rest. The radio screeched in my ear. For a second, under the noise, I heard another voice—my own, or something mimicking it—repeat “unknown” back at me, stretched and warped.

Behind me, closer than I wanted to know, that broken voice called out.

“Help—help—Car—”

It said my name like it was chewing it.

I don’t remember deciding to slow down. I do remember my knee blowing up with pain as I misjudged a step and my right foot skidded on loose gravel. I went down hard. Something in my knee popped and the world went white around the edges.

I grabbed a juniper branch and used it to haul myself up. My leg screamed. The smart move would’ve been to stop, get my bearings, maybe find cover.

I kept moving.

You can’t sprint blind through a canyon and expect to survive. Every instinct screamed run as fast as you can. The rest of me knew if I broke into a full panicked scramble, I’d miss a turn and go off into a side ravine or over a ledge.

So I forced myself to do the thing I always tell new rangers in training: “Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.” Or however that saying actually goes. It feels like garbage when something is chasing you, but it keeps you alive.

“Watch the trail,” I muttered, breath ragged. “Landmarks. You know this place. You’ve been here a hundred times.”

The first mile marker came into view like a hallucination, reflective tape winking in my beam. If I’d had spare oxygen I probably would’ve laughed.

“Halfway,” I told myself. “Just halfway. Keep going.”

Something moved at the edge of my light, up on the slope.

I swung the beam toward it.

For a second I thought the juniper trunks were playing tricks on me. Then it stepped out from behind one.

It stood on the slope above the trail, maybe twenty yards away. The torn orange of the jacket glowed faintly against its chest. Its limbs looked longer than they had in the stone circle, joints set at slightly different angles, like the act of moving had rearranged them.

Its head was cocked. Its eyes didn’t glow like an animal’s this time. They just… absorbed the light. Too still. Too intent.

We stared at each other for one, two heartbeats.

Then it moved.

Not toward me.

Parallel.

It began to walk the contour line, up on the slope, matching my position as I started down-trail again. Same pace, same distance. Every time I flicked the light that way, it was there, just outside the center of the beam.

I’ve watched mountain lions shadow people before. I’ve seen coyotes trot along a ridge, keeping a hunter in sight. This was like that, and not like that at all. There was no curious tilt, no animal caution. It felt… clinical. Like it was observing.

Like it’d decided running me down wasn’t as interesting as seeing what I’d do.

I kept my eyes mostly on the trail, checking every few seconds that it was still there and not suddenly closer. My heart hammered. My knee ached with every step. The urge to bolt full-out almost shook my teeth.

Morales’s voice came back to me out of nowhere—us at the picnic table behind the station on a dead afternoon, her rolling a cigarette between her fingers, talking about the stories her grandmother used to tell.

“Stuff out there that walks on two legs and four, and you don’t say the name,” she’d said. “You don’t look at it if you can help it. You sure as hell don’t talk to it. If it knows you know, that’s when you’ve got a problem.”

I’d made some dumb joke about already having enough to worry about with tourists.

I didn’t feel like laughing now.

I didn’t talk. I didn’t raise the radio again. I didn’t shoot.

The trail curved left, then right. The rectangle of open sky that meant the trailhead lot was close crept into view in front of me, pale compared to the canyon.

Above me, the thing stopped.

I looked up before I could stop myself.

It stood at the very edge of the slope, toes almost over the drop. In my light, its eyes had gone reflective again, picking up just enough glow to look wrong.

Its chest rose and fell once.

Then it opened its mouth.

The sound that came out wasn’t a scream the way you think of a scream. It was a steady, high, piercing tone, a sound so sharp it made the fillings in my molars ache. It didn’t rise or fall; it just held, like a test tone in your inner ear.

Underneath it, I heard something else.

Layered. Fainter. A murmur that might have been voices stacked on top of each other, like a crowd recorded from too far away. Some sounded like they were crying, some like they were laughing, but none of the emotion matched the tone. It was all wrong.

The world narrowed to that noise and the rectangle of the trailhead lot ahead.

My legs did the choosing for me. I ran.

The tone cut off midstream, like someone had yanked a cable. The sudden silence was almost a physical hit.

I sprinted the last stretch, my knee protesting with every jolt. Adrenaline did what ibuprofen can’t.

Then I was out.

I burst into the parking lot like I’d stepped through a door. The truck, the pit toilet, the bullet-riddled “NO SHOOTING” sign—everything ordinary and stupid and real—appeared all at once.

My flashlight beam slammed into the side of the blue Subaru, bounced to the bulletin board, swung over the hood of my truck.

My thermos was still on the seat where I’d left it, silver catching the light. For some reason that almost undid me more than anything else.

The radio at my shoulder clicked.

“Three? Carson? You copy? We lost you for a good ten minutes there.”

My knees finally gave out.

I dropped onto the dirt by the truck, one hand catching the bumper to keep myself from faceplanting. The radio dug into my chest where the harness had shifted, the antenna jabbing under my jaw. My boot knocked the thermos off the seat when I leaned in; it hit the floorboard with a dull thunk I felt in my teeth.

“Three,” I gasped. “At trailhead. I am at the lot. Subject not found. Unknown animal in area. I repeat, unknown animal, aggressive behavior. Request backup. Lots of backup.”

I wasn’t proud of how that last bit came out.

“Copy, Three,” dispatch said, clearly exhaling into the mic. “Morales is en route. County deputies notified. ETA twenty to twenty-five. Stay in your vehicle. Do not re-enter the trail.”

“Affirmative,” I said, and it came out more like a wheeze than a word.

I hauled myself upright, using the truck’s side mirror. My reflection looked worse than I felt—sweat plastered dark hair to my forehead, a smear of blood on one knuckle, dust all up my pants, eyes wide.

The Subaru sat silent and patient.

For reasons I didn’t examine too closely right then, I walked over to the driver’s side and cupped my hands to peer inside. The door was locked. Through the glass I could see a rental agreement on the passenger seat with the logo from a Phoenix airport rental place, a half-empty Arrowhead water bottle, and a dog-eared Rand McNally atlas folded open to northern Arizona.

On the back seat was an orange jacket. Or what was left of it.

The main body of it had been stuffed in there in a hurry, still zipped. Both sleeves were shredded, long diagonal tears running from cuff to shoulder. The nylon was stiff and dark in patches. Someone had tried to wipe it off and given up. The drying made it pucker.

I stared at it for long enough that Morales’s headlights coming up the road made me jump.

I didn’t tell Morales everything that night.

I told her I’d followed the subject’s tracks to an unmarked side canyon, heard what I thought was an injured person, found blood and torn clothing and signs of a struggle. I told her something large had shadowed me on the way out, that I hadn’t seen it clearly, that it might have been a mountain lion acting strange.

She looked at my face for a second longer than was comfortable, then nodded once.

“Okay,” she said. “Animal. Fine. You’re limping. You’re not going back in.”

The deputies pulled in behind her, doors slamming, radios chirping. Their floodlights turned the trailhead into a stage. I watched them fan out with rifles and spotlights, young, confident, joking under their breath because that’s how you keep nerves down.

We ran a full search the next day. Dogs, volunteers, every ranger we could spare. The sun was bright, the sky cloudless. The side canyon looked smaller in daylight, its shadows shallow.

We found the stone ring. We found the blood. We found more of the jacket jammed into a rock crack like someone had tried to hide it.

We didn’t find Matthew.

The dogs didn’t like the circle. They’d approach to about ten feet, then balk and whine, hackles up. One of the deputies joked about “bad vibes.” Morales didn’t laugh.

The official story settled on “probable animal predation.” The report lists cougar as the likely culprit with one of those cover-your-ass lines: “Though no conclusive physical evidence of the animal was recovered, behavior and sign are consistent with known predation events.”

If you read the report, it sounds tidy. Guy goes hiking, meets big cat, doesn’t come home. Happens more than people think.

The messy parts stayed in my head.

His girlfriend came out twice over the next month.

The first time, she met with the sheriff, nodded through all the phrases—“ongoing investigation,” “low probability,” “we’ll keep you updated.” The second time, she drove out alone in a dusty Corolla and stood at the trailhead for a long time, just looking at the sign.

I was coming off a patrol and didn’t want to bother her. She came over to me instead.

“Were you the ranger on call?” she asked.

“Yeah,” I said. “Carson.”

She shook my hand. Grip tight, like it was the only thing keeping her upright.

“Matt’s… he likes to push things,” she said, staring at the bulletin board. “Always has. But he’s not stupid. He told me he’d be out before dark. He texted me from the lot.”

“He signed out ‘by five,’” I said, then wished I hadn’t. It sounded petty out loud.

She nodded once like that hurt. “That’s him. Little promises.”

She pulled something from her bag—a scrap of paper, folded small—and pinned it to the corner of the corkboard with a thumbtack she’d brought. Her hands were shaking.

Later, after she drove off, I went to see what it said.

Three words, in uneven handwriting:

IT SPARED ME. UNDERSTAND?

For a second my brain just shrugged. Then it sorted through its filing cabinet and pulled out a memory from months before.

A different call. Different landscape. Central Idaho, snowmelt below a slide path. We found a man standing in water up to his waist, lips almost blue, pants shredded, no boots. He refused food, refused to give a name, just stared at the tent wall and repeated the same line over and over.

“It spared me. It spared me. It spared me.”

He might have added something else—I can’t remember the exact order now. Shock scrambles people. Either way, that phrase stuck.

I’d chalked it up to hypothermia. People say weird things when they’re that cold. Now, staring at that note with the tack barely holding it, my skin crawled.

I didn’t tell her any of that. What was I going to do—say “Hey, your boyfriend and some half-frozen stranger might’ve met the same thing, congratulations”?

I took the note down two weeks later when it started to curl and bleed ink from the weather. I put it in my desk drawer. It’s still there.

Sometimes I knock my thermos against that drawer by accident in the mornings and the sound makes my shoulders tense before I remember why.

There’s one more part I haven’t told anyone.

About a week after we officially called the search and shifted the documentation over to “recovery unlikely,” I went back to Cottonwood Wash on a day off.

Middle of the day. Blue sky, no clouds. Temperatures in the high sixties. Nothing creepy about it on paper.

I didn’t sign in on the sheet. I know, I know. Practice what you preach. I told myself if anyone asked I’d say I forgot.

I walked the main trail with just my daypack, no radio. My knee ached halfway to the mile marker, a deep dull throb that still flares when the weather changes. I told myself that was why I was breathing harder, not nerves.

When I reached the point where Matthew’s prints had left the trail, I stopped.

The side canyon entrance looked smaller in daylight. Just another scruffy cut in the rock, choked with scrub oak and old flood trash. If you didn’t know, you’d walk right past it forever.

I didn’t go in.

I stood at the mouth of it and listened.

At first, nothing. Just wind moving through the main wash, a couple of scrub jays arguing upcanyon. My heart ticking in my ears.

Then, from somewhere deeper in, far enough that it couldn’t be an echo from the main trail, I heard a sound I’d been waiting for without admitting it.

A thin, strangled call.

“Help.”

Almost clear this time. The consonants hit in the right places. The vowel didn’t drag as much.

It didn’t sound like begging.

It sounded like someone practicing a word until they liked how it felt.

I left. I didn’t run, but it was a close thing.

People online love to argue about labels. Skinwalker, wendigo, crawler, “fleshgait,” whatever the latest YouTube channel calls it. They want a name so they can categorize it, put it in a box with lore and rules and bullet points.

You’re probably wondering what I think it was.

I’m not Navajo. I didn’t grow up with those stories in a way I have the right to explain them. Morales did. I’ve seen her face tighten when tourists throw the S-word around like it’s a mascot.

I won’t call it that. That’s not my word.

I’ll tell you what I know.

I’ve worked around mountain lions, black bears, feral hogs. I’ve seen what coyotes do to calves. I know the difference between an animal hunting because it’s hungry and something toying with you.

What watched me in that canyon wasn’t just thinking about eating.

It was studying.

It moved like it was still figuring out how to wear what it was wearing. Like it had put on a skin—maybe more than one—and the seams didn’t quite match. The voice it used didn’t belong to a single throat. It sounded like it was made out of pieces.

And when it said my name, I’m sure of one thing:

It wasn’t repeating it back blindly. It was trying it on.

These days, when an overdue hiker call comes in near dusk and dispatch says “Cottonwood” and “trailhead” in the same sentence, I suddenly remember paperwork I’ve been putting off, or a training module I promised to finish, or my knee starts acting up.

The younger rangers roll their eyes. They tell me I’m getting soft. Morales just gives me a look like she’s not sure if she wants to know why.

On the nights I can’t duck it and I find myself driving past the COTTONWOOD WASH STATE PARK sign, past the CCC ruins, past the bulletin board with a fresh stack of sign-in sheets, I keep my eyes on the road.

I don’t look at the gap in the rock wall where the side canyon starts. I don’t glance at the slope where something once walked parallel to me, matching my pace.

And when the radio crackles in that stretch, picking up half a word or my own voice delayed and warbling, I turn the volume up just enough to drown out anything else that might be trying to learn how to say my name.",17,1762737761.0,nosleep,2,0.91,False

I like kids, but in doses. I couldn’t imagine being a full time parent. Nobody talks about how exhausting it is being a parent - ESPECIALLY IF THE CHILD HAS SPECIAL NEEDS.

Now, I am not ableist. Every child deserves love and deserves to be treated fairly However, people often don’t see what happens when things don’t happen as planned.

Often, when parents have kids with severe disabilities, all the people that promise to show up disappear. This is especially true as the child grows older and is no longer ‘cute’. 
I see so many parents with adolescent children with severe autism - often to the point where they are combative, and the parents have to stick though it every. single. day. I literally see parents that are scared of their own children. 

One parent that I worked with had THREE SEVERELY AUTISTIC CHILDREN. THREEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!! They all kept screeching at once and bouncing off the wall and of course, she was stressed, overwhelmed and totally over it. 

Even parents that have ‘healthy’ children are stressed out. The constant crying, screaming, whining… shall I go on? Often moms that I work with beg us to watch their kids for five minutes while they get a coffee. 

Why would I want my life to revolve around a human being that is irrational, immature and owes me nothing? 

Honestly, instead of having children I would much rather fill my life with other things that bring me joy. And if I ever did want to experience the ~joy of children~ I would just volunteer for an hour or two a week.

My hat goes off to these parents. They do what I could never.

1ot0lqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhR4Friends/comments/1ot0lqo/22f4m_looking_for_a_match/,22[F4M] Looking for a match,"Even if finding a love that lasts “forever” might feel like a dream, I believe the pursuit itself can still be meaningful. Ideally, the foundation is learning to love and accept yourself first because whether someone comes along or not, your life is still full. But sometimes, the heart still urges us to search. So here I am, honestly presenting what I hope for in a partner and in a relationship. I know perfection doesn’t exist, neither in me nor in anyone else, and that’s okay.

**A Little About Me:**

* Lifestyle: I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs. I enjoy a health-conscious and simple lifestyle, with occasional indulgences. I like quiet evenings, exploring nature, reading, journaling, and trying new experiences that make life meaningful
* Personality: Thoughtful, reflective, honest, and emotionally aware. I value kindness, patience, and meaningful conversation
* Style: Minimalist and natural. Makeup is occasional (cause Idk how to); fashion is casual and comfortable but presentable when needed
* Food: Kaldereta, sinigang, and kare-kare are my top 3 fave ulam
* Coffee: iced > hot
* Height: 5'1
* Fresh grad. Currently staying in the province, but I studied in Manila and plan to review for the board exams next year
* Not a gamer but occasionally playing wild rift for fun

**What I’m Looking For:**

* Age: 22 - 29 yo
* Height: 5'5+
* Someone kind, empathetic, and socially aware. I value people who think deeply about the world and strive to make a positive impact
* A partner with self-awareness and accountability. Growth is important, and I’d love someone who shares that mindset
* Someone who enjoys good conversations about life, hobbies, or meaningful things
* A person who values quality time, whether exploring new places, trying activities, or relaxing with a good movie or playlist
* Physical attraction is important, so swapping pics early is fine
* A healthy, active lifestyle is a plus. I’m working on my own fitness goals and would love a partner who shares or supports that
* Not a smoker

**Relationship Goals:**

* Built on trust, loyalty, and communication. Clear, honest, respectful conversations matter
* Support each other’s growth while maintaining independence and personal interests
* Mutual respect, honesty, and transparency especially when things get tricky
* Make each other feel acknowledged, appreciated, loved, safe, and secure as often as possible

**Other Notes:**

* Tattoos are fine, but I prefer someone with no or minimal ones
* Only reach out if you’re comfortable with persistent messaging

Start by telling me a bit about yourself. Don’t just message me your ASL.",0,1762737346.0,PhR4Friends,0,0.46,False
