I actually should reduce my cleaning routine as I think it’s giving me headaches. Anyways, I brought inside a piece of furniture (a wooden table with slightly misconfigured but nothing too egregious) from outside. I watched from my window as the people set it down onto the street in the hot sun. Not fifteen minutes later I went out and grabbed it, elated. I had it in my room for three days. Last night, I’m drinking coffee and watching a show on my laptop using the table, when I notice a light brown inscent crawling across the top. I work in a nursing home in a big city, so immediately I was able to identity it was a cockroach. My roommate confirmed. Strangely, however, it had wings. We concluded it is probably a wood cockroach. Fine. One never hurt anyone. But then I am sitting again and notice ANOTHER one, and then another, and then another, and then another on this table, all of various sizes though none frighteningly large enough like the German (?) cockroach. All either smallish-medium size or plain old small, microscopic. I am crying and killing them as best as I can while my roommate disposes of the offending table. 

What I can deduce is I do believe these are wood cockroaches. I have never had a cockroach in my house my entirety of my stay. All of these cockroaches populated the table and strayed not far after discovery. However, I am completely fucking neurotic when it comes to cockroaches as I have an irrational fear of them. So my question is will RAID work to eliminate the possibility of more that I may have missed? I understand these creatures don’t thrive well without access to decaying wood, but I’m not a cockroach analyst so I don’t want to forgo proper precautions at prevention, especially considering if I made a miscalculation in species identification. Should I put traps out as well? I’m going to clean my room top to bottom. Luckily, there are no signs in other areas of the house. 

 What other preventive measures can I take to protect my room? What is the best roach killing remedy out there that is also safe for humans AND cats? Thanks in advance ",1,1758435240.0,cockroaches,2,1.0,False

1nmkbem,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1nmkbem/best_meta_quest_vpns/,Best Meta Quest VPNs:,"A recent study by the University of Chicago revealed a shocking vulnerability: researchers successfully injected malicious code into Meta Quest VR systems, allowing them to **spy on users, record everything they did, and manipulate their virtual interactions**. Even more alarming, only one out of 27 test subjects noticed anything suspicious during the attack.

This isn't an isolated incident. Rutgers University researchers discovered that VR headsets leak sensitive information through motion sensors, enabling ""Face-Mic"" attacks that can **extract speech, passwords, and credit card numbers from facial vibrations**. With the VR market projected to grow from $16 billion in 2024 to over $18 billion by 2025, cybercriminals are increasingly targeting virtual reality platforms.

If you own a Meta Quest 2, Quest 3, or Quest Pro, your device faces unique cybersecurity challenges that traditional computer security doesn't address. Here's everything you need to know about protecting your VR experience with the best VPNs for Meta Quest devices.

# Why Meta Quest Devices Face Unique Security Risks

# VR-Specific Attack Vectors You Need to Know

Unlike traditional devices, VR headsets create multiple attack surfaces that cybercriminals can exploit:

**Motion Sensor Exploitation**: Research from Rutgers University demonstrates that built-in accelerometers and gyroscopes in Meta Quest devices can capture speech-associated facial movements. Attackers can derive sensitive information including credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, and passwords from these vibrations—without requiring microphone permissions.

**Ransomware Through Social Engineering**: Security researcher Harish Santhanalakshmi Ganesan successfully installed CovidLock ransomware on a Meta Quest 3 without enabling developer mode, proving that social engineering attacks can trick users into installing malicious APK files that completely lock the device.

**Screen Recording Malware**: The ""Big Brother"" attack, identified by ReasonLabs, allows cybercriminals to remotely record VR headset screens from Android-based devices like the Meta Quest. The malware stays dormant on your computer until your VR headset connects to the same Wi-Fi network.

**DDoS Gaming Attacks**: Competitive VR gamers face targeted Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that flood their IP addresses with traffic, causing lag spikes or complete disconnections during crucial gaming moments.

# Meta's Extensive Data Collection Practices

Meta Quest devices collect unprecedented amounts of personal data through their array of sensors:

* **16 cameras on Quest Pro** track your environment, hand movements, and facial expressions
* **Eye tracking data** reveals what content captures your attention and for how long
* **Voice recognition** processes your speech for commands and social interactions
* **Biometric data** including movement patterns, reaction times, and spatial behavior

This data creates detailed psychological and behavioral profiles that could be exploited for targeted advertising manipulation or sold to third parties in case of a data breach.

# Network-Level Vulnerabilities

Meta Quest devices run on a modified Android Open Source Project (AOSP), making them vulnerable to:

* **Android-specific malware** that can be sideloaded through APK files
* **Network monitoring** by ISPs who can see your VR activity and throttle bandwidth during peak usage
* **Public Wi-Fi risks** when using your headset in hotels, coffee shops, or other shared networks
* **Geo-restrictions** that limit access to VR content based on your location

# How VPNs Protect Your VR Experience

1nmkb5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1nmkb5j/i_hate_my_job/,I hate my job,"I know this is going to sound stupid and whiny, as I’m only 19 and work at a Starbucks and don’t have a ‘real’ job, but I need to vent so here I go.

I’ve recently started working at a grocery store Starbucks after a long job hunt after quitting my last job. I got burnt out of that job and hated it, so I felt a break would be nice. However, with my break led to having so much free time I ended up feeling pretty crappy all the time, and not to mention my impulsive spending drained my savings. 

Thus, I felt I should look for a new job, and that this time it’ll finally be something I like and that’ll make me happy. So fast forward to recently, I got this job. Every time I come in I feel totally stupid as I don’t know much about coffee and yet they hired me anyway. I feel like a burden to my coworkers and like I don’t contribute anything. And today, a woman came in and asked for a ton of drinks while I was alone and I didn’t know how to make some of them. I tried my best and got them wrong, and then she got angry at me and I tried explaining that I was stop practicing. Anyways, she told on me to my manager and I got chewed out, making me feel like shit. 

I just don’t know what to do. Every job I get makes me miserable and I feel like this is indicative of my life to come. Always moving from thing to thing trying to find happiness, and always failing and moving to the next thing. I can’t make myself happy, and I feel like I can’t even make others like me either.

I just don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I should quit and look for something my speed, or just force myself to suffer to avoid people hating me for not having a job. I don’t know.",2,1758434840.0,BorderlinePDisorder,1,1.0,False
1nmkart,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nmkart/nf_screen_deep/,[NF] Screen Deep,"My first job sitting in front of a computer screen was in the year 2000. 

Now, I’ve heard it said somewhere that nothing magical or transcendent is going to happen to you in your life by looking at a screen. And while I mostly agree with this sentiment, life can surprise us sometimes. 

In the last few decades or so we started experiencing everything through screens. In our living rooms, then later through the ones on our desks, then more recently the little ones in our pockets. Hell, you’re probably reading this on one of them right now…  

But I digress. I’m gonna try to tell a story. 

I was twenty years old and struggling to escape my small town after the death of my best friend and the subsequent 2-year bender I’d been on. I convinced my then-girlfriend that we needed to get out… somewhere far away. As luck would have it, around the same time her brother came down to visit from Boston and expressed that he might be able to get me an interview for some low-level position in a software company where he worked. I jumped at the chance, aced the interview and was packing my things for Boston in no time. 

In my world and especially at this time, having a “computer job” felt exhilarating. Not only could I learn a lot, but also could chat with people and fuck around on the internet while doing my job. Back before social media destroyed basic human decency, people used to meet strangers this way. I talked to everyone, dozens of people from all over the world. ICQ was an international chat messenger that could randomly link you up with any user and I was a junky. Bookish and quiet as I was in real life, the internet was the one place where I had some game. 

One day, upon coming back from my lunch break, I was met with three words.

“Talk to us”

“Who are you?”, I typed. 

“2 girls from Poland”

“You know what they say about Polish girls, don’t you?”

I can’t even remember what I followed it up with. It didn't matter. They were instantly intrigued. 
Ewa (Eva) and Ania were just some high school girls looking to improve their English, and so I indulged them. I was a proficient online flirt. Ewa, just the right mix of intelligent and demure, cracked me up. We chatted almost every day.

Eventually things in Boston, and thus my computer job and my relationship with my girlfriend, didn’t pan out. I wanted to stay, build a new life up there despite the insane cost of everything and she missed home. 

And so little more than a year after I left, I found myself back at my uncle’s construction company in New Jersey, tail between my legs, lifting heavy shit all day and coming home in dirty clothes. There I was, warming a barstool in my hometown and wondering if I’d ever get out again. All around me, the clutches of small town life… the local watering hole with all the usual suspects… made me feel like the walls were closing in on me. My chat sessions with Ewa had dwindled down into 2 or 3 emails a month; I logged on every so often to check in with her. Things felt bleak.

At about the same time, I started working with Grover. 

Now, to go into all the details of how exquisitely weird he is would take many pages and a whole story, so suffice it to say that he was a disruptor of things. The year previous, while I was trying on a buttoned-up, business-casual lifestyle in Boston, he’d schlepped his gangly ass across Europe all by himself… staying in hostels and hanging out with expat trust-fund babies. He filled my head with all kinds of stories. We’d spend all day in a truck working alongside each other, and every day he goaded me. 

“Europe, bro! Europe! We gotta go! Sleep in hostels! Meet some European girls… see some amazing shit!” 

The teenage bookworm in me had read about and romanticised the idea of visiting Europe for years, but such things seemed above my station in life. In my mind, it was a place for people who “did a semester abroad” or whose parents belonged to a country club. This was my chance to finally see it. While I didn’t exactly have all the money, Momma raised me with enough good sense to pay my bills and develop a good credit history… so I could put it on my card. But was it worth the debt? 

Whatever reservations I might have had about the whole thing were washed away in an instant by Grover’s sage advice: 

“Look man, I know it’s easier said than done… that’s true… but trust me… it’s easier done than regretted (later in life).” 

Ok not exactly grammatically correct, but the man had a point.

So we worked, we planned, saved a bit of cash, eventually bought a rail pass and flights… all the while hyping each other up for it. I told Ewa about our plans and she invited us to come to Poland, but that wasn’t on the agenda. Poland? Maybe someday, but we had better and more important destinations in mind. Hell, at that time I’m not sure I could have found it on a map.

April arrived. Go time.

First stop - Amsterdam. 

To say that it was everything I’d imagined would be understating it. Amsterdam is a gem. Spring had arrived and the buds on the trees were glowing a pale green that seemed to complement every canal-lined avenue. The buildings and streets and coffee shops were, to my American mind, something straight out of a movie. I must have looked like a total geek. 

Four middle-aged women sitting in a cafe on their lunch break, smoking a spliff… Beautiful girls pedalling past us on old, junky bicycles… Walking through the red-light district at night, looking down a narrow alleyway, wondering what the soft, red glow of those windows might reveal once you were standing directly in front of them… tripping on mushrooms in the park... the cold realization that it’s completely obvious to the entire world that you’re a tourist, and an American one at that. 

These vignettes exist, somewhere in the old shoebox of my memory, as blurry snapshots… far more of them than can be recounted here, so I’ll keep this relatively short.

After three or four revelrous days, it was onward to Paris.

The sheer size of it was overwhelming. Arriving by train, we had to trudge across the entire city to find the hostel we were looking for from the Frommer’s Europe on 70$ a day guidebook - the ‘backpacker’s bible'. Any romantic notions I’d had about the city were rapidly fading. Unlike Amsterdam, it wasn’t very walkable. Apart from the child-like wonder of seeing the Eiffel Tower in the distance, I remember almost nothing about that day, just that we were exhausted when we finally settled into our little hostel.

At around midnight, still awake and reading my book and excited for the following day, Grover walked up to me. 

“Hey, I gotta get the fuck out of here.”, he said.

At first I thought he was already sick of France or something and wanted to move on to Barcelona, step three. 

I muttered something along the lines of - “but we just got here today…?” 

“No.”, he interrupted, “I’m going home.” 

While I was reading, he had called his mother and found out that she’d just decided to sell his childhood home in the next two weeks. We had three weeks left in our trip. 

“Whaaaat… the fuck dude?” 

Panic washed over me like a cold shower. The prospect of being there alone was something I wasn’t at all prepared for. I mean… yeah… I was technically an adult, but not speaking the language in a strange land makes you feel like a lost child. Truth be told, at that moment I wanted to leave with him. It was my first time outside of my country and I was terrified. What I said next is lost to my memory. I’m sure I was sputtering justifications about why I should also leave, but was cut off by my friend - 

“You should stay.” 
“Here - ”, he said, shoving the ‘bible’ into my chest, “ - take it.  Have your own adventure.” 

What is one to do in this situation? 

That night, sleep didn’t come easy. The upside to traveling alone is that you have no one to answer to. There are no debates about what to eat, what to see or where to go, but it's incredibly lonely. The plan we had outlined was to see Paris then go on to Barcelona, then Rome.. then home. I could change the plan to whatever I wanted. I wish I could tell you that at this moment I let go of all my inhibitions and leaned into the possibilities and plotted a fearless journey into the ether, engaging every smiling face and shaking every hand. That certainly crossed my mind. But this ain't no fairy tale. I wasn’t that guy. 

Was it fear of being alone that kept me thinking about the only person on the entire continent that I knew? Was it a sense of adventure? Something else?

I woke up the next morning with a few clear goals in my head. First was to find an internet cafe and make contact with Ewa. I told her what had happened. 

“Does this mean that you’re coming to Poland?”

“I don’t know.”, I replied. “I need time to think about it. Is the invitation still open?”

“Of course.”

Let’s back up a bit. A few years prior to this whole story, my mother had walked into a casino in Atlantic City and won a ‘door prize’ - an all-expenses paid trip for two to Munich, Germany. The trip of a lifetime for my mom, who had hardly traveled beyond New Jersey.  She’d spent the time afterward regaling me with stories of how magical and fairy-tale-like it all was. “You have to see it!!” 

Munich was in the right direction, after all. Right?  

More blurry snapshots. A French toddler riding his scooter up to me and asking me something, my reply “Je ne comprends pas le français”, and the scrunched up look on his face … thinking to myself “THAT is the Mona Lisa?! It’s the size of a fucking stamp!” … getting lost in the Metro and asking for help from a woman who could barely contain her chuckling at my horrible French. She was warm, nonetheless… the elevator ride through the massive, imposing guts of the Eiffel Tower… a train ride through Bavaria which, indeed, is like a fairy tale.

Munich.

As the train pulled in it was getting dark and I had no idea where I was going to sleep. Panicking, I found a tourist info center to ask where the nearest hostel was. I would have killed for the little pocket screen to tell me where to go. That world hadn’t been invented yet.

A mid-40s German woman greeted me as I walked into her little office. The nearest hostel? Two blocks away. I then asked her how I might get to Prague, another waypoint between me and Ewa. Looking back, I may not remember what this woman looked like, but I’ll always remember what she said. 

“Where are you going?” ... “What’s your final destination?”

“Well, I’m not sure. I’ve got this invitation from a person I met online to stay with them in Poland. Like, a regular Polish family.”

“And you’re not sure if you want to go?”

I shrugged … 

“Why not?”

“Well, I don't really know this person. It’s not something I’m sure I would offer them if they were coming to me in America. Ya know? It feels a little weird.”

There was something in the way she looked at me. Was she smirking? Was she sizing me up? 

“I think you should go.”, she said, after a heavy silence. 
“I think you’ll be surprised.”

“Really?”

Her smile and nod were all the confirmation I needed.

And that was it. I was in. 

At the hostel, the clerk told me that he was all booked up, but that if his reservation didn’t arrive in the next twenty minutes then I could have a bed. 

I waited and silently prayed. In hindsight, it was funny… but at the time I must have looked like a frightened rabbit. Unable to speak the language and not knowing where you are going to lay your head at night can be pretty intense. But they never came, so I got the bed. Giddy, I threw my backpack on top of it and went straight down to the bar. 

Walking into the crowded pub area, the only available seat was at a small table where a cute girl was sitting. 

“Do you mind if I sit here?” 

“No… please.”, she motioned for me to sit. 

After an agonizingly long time “reading my book” I mustered up the courage to talk to her. 

“So… where are you from?”

“New Jersey. What about you?” 

“Get the fuck outta here… I'm from New Jersey!”

Serendipity is a funny thing. We decided to stick together and do touristy stuff. Bike trips and museums and eating out. Evenings in the pub with the beautiful Danish bartender and the old Eurotrash dude who’s far too old to be hanging out here but unable to stay away from the college backpacker girls. Some sisters from Australia. A cast of characters as colorful as any circus, or maybe that’s just what my booze-addled brain kept telling me. I had a blast. I was finding my feet. 

A moment of clarity in my drunken pub haze, a feeling of being untethered, young, alive, a stranger in a strange land and relishing it…   “Up ahead we’re going to see a nude beach on the riverbank. But don’t worry, you won’t see anything too risque. You’re more likely to see reasons why you shouldn’t drink beer and eat sausages for 60 years”… the stark outline of the letters ARBEIT MACHT FREI relieved against the overcast sky at Dachau, and the devastating sound of the choir of Israeli students singing at the incinerators… the seating area at the Hofbrau house, just pick a seat and strike up conversation with whoever is there, the way the world should be… someone giving me a little card with the name of a Prague hostel on it, The Clown and what?

Arriving in Prague was a bit of a shock, like I had traveled back in time another 20 years or more. It lacked the pastel, Bavarian quaintness of Munich. It seemed far more brutalist and dingy to me. This was Eastern Europe. I couldn’t escape the thought that only a dozen years or so had passed since Communism had collapsed. 

It began downpouring as soon as my train pulled into the city. Heavy, sideways rain. 

Briskly walking out of the train station and trying to find a taxi, I caught a glimpse of something in the corner of my eye. Was someone following me? … Uh huh. 
I began shucking and jiving through the kiosks outside the train station to throw him off. A young gypsy perhaps? He was right behind me every step of the way and gaining on me. Seeing the glass doors of the train station up ahead, I immediately ducked back inside the station and spun around to look through the glass and lock eyes with him. He jumped back like something had bit him. I pointed my finger at him as he snapped his head away and tried to look innocent. 

Crossing the station to the other side, I ran to a parked taxi. “The Clown and Bard?”, I said as I handed the card to the driver. 

At this point in the trip the combination of the non-stop rain, the close call with a thief at the train station and the loneliness of solo travel had started to catch up with me. I was feeling tired and just a bit depressed. 

The entrance to the place was on the street, but you had to walk down into a basement pub area, check-in, then go upstairs to find a bed. I seemed to be the only person in the whole place for a while, until early in the evening the bar began to fill up. As I sat reading my book, a few guys walked up to my table and asked if they could sit with me. 

“Ok.”  

They were black, which was something that seemed out of place in eastern Europe. They seemed a bit shady, didn’t say much to me or each other, so I ignored them. After a short while, one of them leans over to me and says, 

“Hey man… you smoke?” and gives me the international gesture for smoking a joint.

“Yeah, sure.”, I hadn’t smoked since Amsterdam. 

“You wanna go outside and smoke with us?” 

My mind raced… ‘here we go’, I thought ‘I’ll go outside and the first thing I’ll feel is a sucker-punch to my ear.’  But I didn’t want to be rude, and a joint sounded like just what I needed. 

“Give me a second.”, I said, and instantly ran up the stairs to my bed and put away all my money and my passport. I came back.

“Ready?” 

“Sure.” 

I braced for a scuffle as I walked outside, literally held my breath… but… nothing. The guy lit up a joint and passed it to me, cool as can be. Turns out he lived there. He and his boys were in a reggae band and his wife was Czech. They’d come there for movie night, when all the locals pile in and hang out with the backpackers to watch a movie on the giant pull-down projector screen. That night was the first time in my life I’d ever seen Monty Python’s Meaning of Life, and it was truly a gift to get to watch it with a group of complete strangers, laughing our asses off in unison. 

All this time, I’d been keeping a rough correspondence with my Polish friend, updating her on what I was doing and the progress I was making. She’d agreed to meet me after Prague. Somehow, I managed to buy tickets to her small city in Poland. I say somehow because the language barrier was pretty insurmountable and the trip wasn't exactly easy to plot out.  After two days, I decided Prague was a wash… the rain wouldn’t stop and the idea of sloshing around through it all day just seemed like it would make me even more depressed. I just wanted to get on to my destination. I’ll see it another day, I thought. On my last night I went out to a shitty club with a few people that mostly bored me. Or maybe I bored them? 

The trains looked like something straight out of 1984, Slavic graffiti all over the outside, upholstered seats that were clearly older than I was… a disturbing 2-hour delay at the border, German shepherds sniffing through the baggage… a stopover in Katowice, rushing around asking everyone “Do you speak English?”, every single person shaking their head and shrugging… holding up a little hand-drawn note with Gliwice on it… aha! I’m saying it wrong! It’s Glee-vee-tsuh… Is this the right train?

I finally arrived in Gliwice. 

When I walked out of the train station, it was getting dark and nobody was waiting to meet me. 

Surely something was wrong. Ewa had agreed to meet me when my train arrived. Where was she?

It was then that I realized that I hadn't gotten her phone number or address. Our sole form of communication had been through email. What kind of an idiot travels across a continent to meet someone and doesn’t have their phone number or address? 

Yep... Me.

I scanned the area outside the train station looking for any sign of an internet cafe, but the likelihood of finding one seemed impossible. This was a small city, a town really, in my mind. I noticed a girl sitting there on a bench and pantomimed my way through an explanation about what I was doing there and how royally fucked I was. She could do little more than politely smile at me before she left. I decided to wait. 

After what felt like an eternity, a car pulled up in the parking lot, and a familiar face stepped out of the passenger side. 

We hugged. 

Upon entering the car, her older sister Ola immediately asked.

“What kind of an idiot travels across a continent to meet someone and doesn’t have their phone number or address?

It turned out that the delay at the border made my train late. They had already been to the train station and waited for me and left. They decided to come back to check again. The Fates were looking out for me. 

What can I say about those first awkward days in this place? Ewa proved to be much quieter and more reserved than I ever imagined. The girl on the screen was nowhere to be found, she’d been replaced by a mousy introvert who was extremely difficult to read. Thank the gods for her sister, who never seemed to shut up. 

They made me feel welcome in their home and fed me. It was a big and lovely house, and I soon realized that her family probably had more money than mine, but the culture shock was substantial. This place lacked all of the luster of my previous destinations. Everything seemed gray and a bit dilapidated, as if the Second World War had only recently ended. This was real Poland, real people. No backpackers or trust fund kids or tourists. 

If I'm being honest, I wanted to go home. The girl I’d come to meet wasn't at all what I had expected. I was convinced that she didn’t like the person I was beyond the screen, but we’d made a few plans already and would see them through.

She showed me her city and I met a few of her friends… we took the train to Krakow, another absolute gem. We walked through its Baroque beauty, fumbled through conversations, discovering more and more about each other. No more screens to hide behind.

I started to do this thing each day, where I said - “I think I have to leave tomorrow.”

And she’d say - “Do you have to?”

And I’d look into her eyes and ask - “Do you want me to stay?”

“Yes”

So I stayed… another day. Then another. 

I’ll spare you, dear reader, the extremely awkward details, but suffice it to say that I was falling hard for this girl. 

And since this was my time… my adventure… the transmutation of a criminally shy boy into a man unafraid… I told her so. 

It’s been the defining moment of my life. 

Two decades later, here I am plugging away, plotting it all out on a different screen… in my home… in Poland… and yelling at my kids to get off of their screens. 

So… If you think that you’ll never have a transcendent experience by looking at a screen… well… 

Never say “never”.

1nmk651,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1nmk651/this_one_trick_helped_me_make_friends_as_a/,This one trick helped me make friends as a socially awkward person,"I used to panic in every social situation. I’d stand there overthinking my face, my hands, my voice. At work, I’d hide in the bathroom between meetings. At parties, I’d pretend to text someone just to avoid standing alone. I wasn’t shy, I just didn’t know how to connect. But something changed a couple years ago. I started building little “identities” for myself in different contexts. Not fake personas, just props that gave people a reason to talk to me. Like bringing a deck of cards to a bar. Or being “the tea person” at the office. I didn’t realize it then, but this weird little hack gave me social gravity. And it rewired how I thought about conversations.

I started reading everything I could about human connection. Harvard research showed that people who ask more follow-up questions are liked way more. Not because they’re charming, but because they come off as responsive. You ask, they answer, you follow up. That’s it. A study from Harvard Business School found this to be one of the top predictors of likability, even in speed dating. Pair that with the “liking gap” (PubMed), which shows we all underestimate how much people liked us after a chat, and you’ve got a killer combo: ask more questions, and stop assuming you were awkward.

But the real game changer for me was hearing Andrew Huberman explain the social homeostasis system in our brain. He says our nervous system literally needs the right amount of connection to function, just like sleep or water. No wonder silence in the breakroom feels painful. I stopped seeing it as a personal flaw. I saw it as undertraining.

Another one that stuck with me: mere exposure effect. We like people more the more we see them. That’s why I started wearing my local baseball cap every time I hit the coffee shop. Same time, same place. Made it easier for strangers to become regulars. Same goes for the tea box I carry at work. These tiny cues became my “social cues.” Easy, low pressure, and they work.

“Captivate” by Vanessa Van Edwards cracked the code on likability for me. She’s a behavioral scientist who studies first impressions, and this book showed me how to build warmth before trying to prove myself. Turns out, you don’t need to “perform”, you just need a repeatable framework. Vanessa’s breakdowns made socializing feel less random and more like a game I could learn.

“The Good Life” by Robert Waldinger (Harvard’s 80-year happiness study) made me rethink what really matters. It’s not success. It’s not hustle. It’s relationships. This book helped me see that connection is health. And it made me appreciate every micro-interaction, even awkward ones, in a whole new way. Insanely good read.

I used to roll my eyes at “How to Win Friends and Influence People,” but it’s one of the few timeless ones that holds up. This isn’t a business manual, it’s a human manual. Carnegie just gets how people work. Ask questions. Remember names. Be genuinely interested. Obvious? Maybe. But when you’re spiraling with social anxiety, it helps to be reminded.

One of my favorite podcast hosts recommended this app called BeFreed, and honestly it changed the game for me. It’s a personalized AI learning app built by a team from Columbia U. It turns expert talks, research, and bestselling books into podcast-style episodes tailored to your goals. You get to pick your host’s tone, I picked a smoky, sassy one that sounds like Samantha from Her. It even updates your learning roadmap as you listen. One episode blended insights from Captivate, Dale Carnegie, and Huberman to explain why I freeze in convos, and how to fix it. Felt like the personalized cheat code I’d been waiting for.

The Huberman Lab episode on “Social Bonding” is a must. It covers the biology of eye contact, voice tone, and why synchronized movement (like walking while talking) instantly builds connection. I started suggesting “walk and talks” with coworkers and it changed the vibe completely. Less pressure, more flow.

Charisma on Command is a YouTube channel I used to binge at 2 a.m. before awkward social events. They break down real interactions, from celeb interviews to speeches, and explain what works and what doesn’t. Helped me stop trying to be funny and start focusing on being present. And likable. And human.

I also gave Meetup another shot. I used to think it was for boomers, but I found a couple low-key writing and game nights through it. It helped me get reps in when I was still scared of “small talk.” Zero pressure, just vibes and mutual awkwardness.

I don’t think I magically became “social.” I just stopped seeing socializing as a test and started treating it like a habit I could build. The science helped. The stories helped. But most of all, reading daily helped. Knowledge rewires your mind. The more I read, the less I judged myself. The more I understood others, the more I liked people again. And that’s when the real friendships started.

1nmk2my,https://i.redd.it/eytk3v2vigqf1.jpeg,Sanremo Vintage Font Duo by Nicky Laatz: Your New Secret Weapon for Authentic Retro Design,"Finding a truly authentic vintage font is a challenge. Many typefaces try to capture retro charm. However, they often feel too clean or digitally perfected. They miss the essential human touch. The [Sanremo vintage font duo](https://weandthecolor.com/sanremo-vintage-font-duo-nicky-laatz/205795), created by Nicky Laatz, solves this problem beautifully. This font pairing channels the imperfect, hand-printed style of 1940s and 1950s signage. Its inspiration comes directly from old matchbook covers and classic advertisements. Consequently, Sanremo delivers genuine mid-century character for today’s design projects.

This duo is more than just a font; it is a complete typographic toolkit. It provides the perfect balance of bold confidence and handwritten warmth. Ultimately, it gives designers a shortcut to an era defined by personality and flair.

# Breaking Down the Perfect Pair

The magic of the **Sanremo vintage font duo** lies in its two complementary styles. Each font can stand alone. Together, however, they create a powerful visual harmony.

# The All-Caps Sans: A Bold Statement

The first part of the duo is a commanding, all-caps sans serif. Its letterforms feel hand-drawn. They possess a subtle unevenness that suggests a real artist’s hand. This font is designed for headlines and powerful statements. Furthermore, it includes several height variations. This allows you to mix and match characters for a truly custom, hand-set appearance. It grabs attention without ever feeling cold or impersonal.

# The Handwritten Script: Effortless Charm

The second font is a fluid, handwritten script. It provides a necessary touch of warmth and personality. The script flows with an easy confidence, adding a cheeky wink to any design. Additionally, Nicky Laatz included slanted versions for extra energy. There is also a lighter variant specifically designed for better readability on dark backgrounds. This script is perfect for taglines, descriptions, or any place you need a more personal connection.

# The Sanremo Vintage Font Duo: Why Texture is Everything

Digital fonts often lack the grit of their analog ancestors. Sanremo addresses this directly. Both the sans and the script styles come in two distinct versions: smooth and slightly rough.

The smooth version offers a clean, crisp look suitable for any application. The slightly rough version, however, is where the real magic happens. It introduces subtle texture and distressing to the edges of the letters. This detail mimics the look of ink bleeding slightly into paper over time. It is a small feature that makes a massive difference in achieving an authentic vintage aesthetic. This is how the **Sanremo vintage font duo** avoids looking like a cheap imitation.

# Putting the Duo to Work: Practical Inspiration

This font duo’s versatility makes it a valuable asset for a wide range of projects. Its retro vibe is perfectly suited for brands that want to feel both timeless and approachable.

# For Memorable Branding and Logos

Are you developing a brand identity for a café, a barbershop, or an artisanal goods company? The **Sanremo vintage font duo for logo design** is an excellent choice. Use the bold sans for the company name. Then, use the script for the supporting tagline. This combination immediately communicates quality and character. It helps a new brand feel established and trustworthy.

# For Eye-Catching Packaging and Menus

Imagine a cocktail menu designed with this duo. The sans serif clearly presents the drink titles. Meanwhile, the script artfully lists the unique ingredients. This typographic pairing elevates the entire experience. It works just as effectively on product packaging for everything from coffee beans to craft beer. It makes the product feel special and hand-crafted.

# A Design Critic’s Perspective

I see countless new fonts every month. Very few have the immediate, practical appeal of the **Sanremo vintage font duo**. Nicky Laatz has demonstrated a keen understanding of what designers need. The balance between the bold sans and the friendly script is perfectly executed. The inclusion of texture and alternate characters shows a deep commitment to quality.

What I appreciate most is its restraint. The ""rough"" effect is subtle. It adds character without overpowering the design. This typeface doesn't shout ""I'm a retro font!"" Instead, it effortlessly embodies a vintage spirit. It is a sophisticated tool for any designer looking to add a touch of nostalgic class to their work.

# Global Versatility

A great design tool should be accessible. The font duo includes extensive language support, ensuring its usability for a global market. Supported languages include Danish, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, and many more. This makes Sanremo a reliable choice for international branding projects.

However, we’ve been having issues with how much attention I need, for the past two years. I’ve tried getting over it but my neediness just keeps coming back. I have a million hobbies, I love watching tv, exercising, going shopping, and I’m content doing all of this by myself. 

Even though I have these things, I still keep wanting to hangout with him whenever I can. I intentionally and unintentionally bug him about a few times a day. “Can we hangout?” “Hiii…” “ do you want to do something today?” Some days I don’t bother him at all even though I’m home with him, but in days like today I’ve come talk to him at least 8 times already(it’s midnight) and he hates it. He hates expressing that he doesn’t like it, so he just gets upset. 

I just hate how much I want his attention. How badly I wish he could come to bed with me or stay with me for a while. I don’t enjoy asking for him for things. Whenever we do something together such as making and eating dinner, he uses it as an excuse when he doesn’t want to hangout later. Is this normal?

I know it’s normal to want attention, but I feel it’s getting out of hand for me. I don’t know. I want to be good for him but nothing is working.

He loves me, but he loves being alone. We’ve been living together for about a year and a few months, and I don’t think he’s used to me being in his space yet.

Online platforms reward outrage and extremes, and without those small, daily face-to-face interactions (coffee at work, chats at school pick-ups, even random talks in a café), we lose the practice of nuance. Everything becomes “my view vs. your view,” instead of “what can we agree on?”

This last week, I was on an overnight business trip. It was in-state, but far enough away (I'm mostly remote) that the company got me a room because I had two full days of meetings and a dinner/happy hour on the first day. It went well but was taxing and honestly when I got back to my hotel I just wanted a fruity mixed drink and then to go up to my room, do a face mask, and relax before sleeping.


I went into the hotel bar and once everything started happening it occurred to me that I don't believe I've ever actually sat at a bar unaccompanied before even though I'm 33 years old. I've been with my husband for 15 years and when I've gone out without him I've always been with friends. Any time I've been alone at a bar someone was coming back to me within several minutes at least. I don't know that I ever want to sit at a bar alone again. And it makes me sad and it makes me so angry that I can't just have a fucking drink alone.


I ordered one drink and the bartender wandered away so I couldn't pay fast and get out. While I was there I was constantly harassed by 3 very intoxicated men the entire time. I just wanted to sit quietly with a drink and breathe and I wasn't allowed to do that. I have issues with fawning due to my abusive upbringing but I was honestly not friendly in response to them constantly hollering at me, which I'm at least a bit proud of me for. And I tried not to respond but when they kept yelling at me I got nervous and replied with something short and in a disinterested way. (As many of you know, fully ignoring men who can't take a hint often ends up in them getting aggressive and nasty, so I just couldn't bring myself to totally ignore men yelling at the only female person in the room who was not an employee.)


I ended up throwing cash behind the bar so I could leave, meaning the bartender got a 100% tip because they were so bad at their job that I had to run away when they never came back. And I spent hours in my room in anxiety, feeling very tense and upset, and couldn't sleep even though I take medication for chronic insomnia. I was just so upset that I couldn't calm down. And I was upset that I was so upset that these shitty assholes dudes made me feel scared to just exist in a public space in the evening. It's been a few days and I'm just fucking angry. But I also feel naïve and almost embarrassed about it, because I guess when I went in to the hotel bar I thought I'd have a coffee shop kind of experience where I'm allowed to get an expensive drink and just enjoy my own company in a public place while grown ass adults entertain themselves. 


And I know it's not my fault that this happened. I know that those guys were assholes. And the bartender was an asshole for continuing to serve alcohol to beligerent dickheads. But I just want to be allowed to exist and feel safe like a normal human being. This shouldn't have happened. We should be allowed to exist in peace and safety in public places, and it's not fucking fair that we can't.",5,1758433181.0,TwoXChromosomes,0,0.86,False

Before testing, I cleaned out both grinders and checked alignment and made a few adjustments to each to ensure they’re in prime working order. 

The brewer I used for each grinder was a plastic UFO dripper with UFO papers and a hario drip assist placed on top of the brewer.

The coffee I used is from the roastery I work for: B3 coffee located in SA, Australia. The coffee itself was roasted on the 9th of September and is a Washed Pink Burbon grown by Luz Helena Salazar who owns Maracay farm in Armenia Quindio, Colombia. 

On the cupping table we collectively enjoy this coffee. It’s simple, clean, we get notes of  yuzu, currents, finger lime, balanced acidity and sweetness with a medium/light weight, and lingering aftertaste.

I’ve attached my messy notes but in summary here’s what I tasted: 

- Pre 2015 ‘A’ burrs: 

Taste - medium acidity (citric) finger lime, lime, brown sugar, yuzu, bergamot, honey, jasmine florals

Mouthfeel - full, lingering 

Aroma: mandarin, lime, sweet


- SSP HU burrs: 

Taste - high acidity (citric) orange, bergamot, brown sugar sweetness, caramelised, chamomile.

Mouthfeel - thin, tea like, quick finish

Aroma - mandarin, sweet.


To summarise above, both coffees tasted very similar, however the expression of each was quite different. I’m very used to what the HU burrs taste like and know that they provide very high clarity brews. The Mahlkonig burrs were much more balanced and provided more perceptible sweetness and texture. 


Ps this was my brew recipe for the coffee:

Mahlkonig A burrs:

Dose: 15g
Temp: 94 Celsius
Total water weight: 280g (1:18.6 ratio) 
Yield: 243.5g
Brew time: 4:00

SSP burrs:

Dose: 15g 
Temp: 94 Celsius 
Total water weight: 280g
Yield: 241.9g
Brew time: 3:50

1nmjl8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1nmjl8f/this_one_trick_helped_me_make_friends_as_a/,This one trick helped me make friends as a socially awkward person,"I used to panic in every social situation. I’d stand there overthinking my face, my hands, my voice. At work, I’d hide in the bathroom between meetings. At parties, I’d pretend to text someone just to avoid standing alone. I wasn’t shy, I just didn’t know how to connect. But something changed a couple years ago. I started building little “identities” for myself in different contexts. Not fake personas, just props that gave people a reason to talk to me. Like bringing a deck of cards to a bar. Or being “the tea person” at the office. I didn’t realize it then, but this weird little hack gave me social gravity. And it rewired how I thought about conversations.

I started reading everything I could about human connection. Harvard research showed that people who ask more follow-up questions are liked way more. Not because they’re charming, but because they come off as responsive. You ask, they answer, you follow up. That’s it. A study from Harvard Business School found this to be one of the top predictors of likability, even in speed dating. Pair that with the “liking gap” (PubMed), which shows we all underestimate how much people liked us after a chat, and you’ve got a killer combo: ask more questions, and stop assuming you were awkward.

But the real game changer for me was hearing Andrew Huberman explain the social homeostasis system in our brain. He says our nervous system literally needs the right amount of connection to function, just like sleep or water. No wonder silence in the breakroom feels painful. I stopped seeing it as a personal flaw. I saw it as undertraining.

Another one that stuck with me: mere exposure effect. We like people more the more we see them. That’s why I started wearing my local baseball cap every time I hit the coffee shop. Same time, same place. Made it easier for strangers to become regulars. Same goes for the tea box I carry at work. These tiny cues became my “social cues.” Easy, low pressure, and they work.

“Captivate” by Vanessa Van Edwards cracked the code on likability for me. She’s a behavioral scientist who studies first impressions, and this book showed me how to build warmth before trying to prove myself. Turns out, you don’t need to “perform”, you just need a repeatable framework. Vanessa’s breakdowns made socializing feel less random and more like a game I could learn.

“The Good Life” by Robert Waldinger (Harvard’s 80-year happiness study) made me rethink what really matters. It’s not success. It’s not hustle. It’s relationships. This book helped me see that connection is health. And it made me appreciate every micro-interaction, even awkward ones, in a whole new way. Insanely good read.

I used to roll my eyes at “How to Win Friends and Influence People,” but it’s one of the few timeless ones that holds up. This isn’t a business manual, it’s a human manual. Carnegie just gets how people work. Ask questions. Remember names. Be genuinely interested. Obvious? Maybe. But when you’re spiraling with social anxiety, it helps to be reminded.

One of my favorite podcast hosts recommended this app called BeFreed, and honestly it changed the game for me. It’s a personalized AI learning app built by a team from Columbia U. It turns expert talks, research, and bestselling books into podcast-style episodes tailored to your goals. You get to pick your host’s tone, I picked a smoky, sassy one that sounds like Samantha from Her. It even updates your learning roadmap as you listen. One episode blended insights from Captivate, Dale Carnegie, and Huberman to explain why I freeze in convos, and how to fix it. Felt like the personalized cheat code I’d been waiting for.

The Huberman Lab episode on “Social Bonding” is a must. It covers the biology of eye contact, voice tone, and why synchronized movement (like walking while talking) instantly builds connection. I started suggesting “walk and talks” with coworkers and it changed the vibe completely. Less pressure, more flow.

Charisma on Command is a YouTube channel I used to binge at 2 a.m. before awkward social events. They break down real interactions, from celeb interviews to speeches, and explain what works and what doesn’t. Helped me stop trying to be funny and start focusing on being present. And likable. And human.

I also gave Meetup another shot. I used to think it was for boomers, but I found a couple low-key writing and game nights through it. It helped me get reps in when I was still scared of “small talk.” Zero pressure, just vibes and mutual awkwardness.

I don’t think I magically became “social.” I just stopped seeing socializing as a test and started treating it like a habit I could build. The science helped. The stories helped.

The sweetness of the coffee truly comes out and is not masked by the bitterness that comes the CO2. 

Based on everything I read, I would only rest beans for a week… yeah, extractions are good and taste well; but after experiencing the generosity of some folks who gifted me more coffee than the one that I can consume in a couple of weeks, I found that day extractions on days 20-30 (I use Beanconqueror to track) were mindblowing. I might step down one number on my grinding (using a DF64), but other than that, using the same recipe that is used when i forst dialed the coffee. 

There are many posts that say this, but there are 5x amou t of posts saying that beans peak at a week or two. I wish i had found more posts of people contrasting freshly roasted vs. properly rested beans. 

BTW, I rest the beans on the original bag, if unopened, or in an airscape container. These things are brilliant.

“Excuse me, sir! Your father is approaching!” Archie said, and Chris looked at Miri. He didn’t want to let go, and neither did she, but father. It hit them, and they both stepped out of the embrace as they blushed. They hadn’t even noticed that the big man/android had approached. Chris looked around and saw a Scisya man sitting in the back. He simply nodded and vanished. God damn shadows. Miri saw it too, and looked back at him.

“He was there the whole time?”

He nodded in reply, as she covered her mouth in shock. Then they noticed a group approaching the restaurant, and they both looked at each other. Chris took her hand, and she smiled, trying to appear brave, then they turned worriedly towards the adults approaching. Archie moved aside.

.

Adam looked at his son and the girl. They already looked like a couple, he glanced quickly at Evelyn, who smiled and approached them first, taking control of the situation.

“Miri right? I’m so glad to meet you. I’m Evelyn, that grumpy man is Adam, and the other one is High priestess Swuna D’asha.  They both want to talk to you, but I just want to get to know you.” Then she looked at Chris. “She is cute.”

“Mom!” Chris said as he looked at Miri, who was confused, then giggled at Chris's reaction.

“Yes he is,” she replied, then realized who Evelyn was and immediately started to kneel as “Your majesty” came up. But Chris stopped her.

“No, you don’t bow to any of us. Dad doesn’t like it.”

She stood up, confused, and looked at him, then Evelyn, who nodded and said, “Just Evelyn.” And then finally, at Adam.  He smiled at her. He knew Chris had made a good choice, she seemed to be quick on the uptake.  He watched as Evelyn made them sit and asked for a menu.  A menu appeared from a hologram projector, and she started to order while talking to the two teenagers.  Adam nodded to Swuna, and they joined quietly.

Miri didn’t even seem to notice how Evelyn interrogated her about her life. It appeared as just a simple conversation with the mother of her boyfriend. Adam tried to block that part out, but the more he looked at them, the clearer it became. They acted like puppies in love, trying desperately to hide their feelings for each other from the adults and failing miserably. Even Archie could notice it.

Swuna tried very hard to hide her joy of seeing it, but she seemed to almost gloat in the revelation of their relationship. Adam was more interested in her home world, Arcus, which was the one that had joined them a few years back, and when she mentioned her mother, it suddenly snapped into place.

“You’re Shiadi's daughter?” Adam suddenly asked, surprised, and Miri looked at him, even more surprised.

“Yes? How do you know?” She replied, and Adam smiled, remembering the shy woman who had been the administrator when Arcus had joined. She had died a year later in a transporter accident. She had been a good one, and there was something she had asked. A private request.

“I met here, well, we had several holographic meetings and one quick meeting at the hub. She mentioned you.” That made everybody turn to look at him.

“What? But she?” Miri said.

“She was the administrator of Arcus when she passed, right? It was she who applied for Arcus to join the kingdom. We were sad to hear about her passing.” Adam replied. “We would have been to the funeral, but since your customs do not allow foreigners at the funeral, I had to send Arus. Anyway, she asked for you to join the academy on Dirt, I agreed and told her to send a request. It should still be in the system.”

“I was supposed to go to school on Dirt?”

“Same school is actually like Chris's,” he replied, and then it hit him, the universe would not allow them to meet before, just as it had broken him and Evelyn up since they met too early. Miri didn’t see his expression change as she was looking at Chris with shock, but Evelyn noticed and squeezed his hand under the table.

“Can I join now?” she looked at him, and Adam looked at Sweuna and she turned to her. “Please? I behave, no more kissing.. oops..  I… we didn’t..” she started to panic, and Swuna just chuckled.  Chris seemed just as embarrassed and blushed as he tried not to look at his parents. His brothers and sisters will make his life a living hell now.

“If I stopped you from ever speak to him again, the universe would strike me down, but you cannot join his school yet. You have duties here on Skia-An. You have to be crowned and take your place as the heir and princess of the Sciaya realm. The return of the royal line might unify us and bring back many of the colonies and reunite the realm. As well as your education, and am I sorry to say, lacking. If you join the academy now, you will surely fail every subject. I will help you, make sure you will have tutors to help you reach the level that is expected, and then I will personally escort you to the academy or university of your choice.”

“Can I visit her right?” Chris said, and Miri nodded.

“He can, right?” she almost begged, and the adults chuckled.

“I don’t think ten wild horses would be able to stop him and knowing my friends, they will help him.” Adam said with a chuckle as he wondered if Jork had already a ship ready for the prince stashed away.

“Well, it seems we have found a solution for this. We will announce it to the realm tonight. You should get some rest because tomorrow will be a big day.” Swuna said to Miri.

“Can we stay, Dad? I want to see the coronation.” Chris said, and all Adam saw was a five-year-old with big eyes asking for a favor.

“Of course, son, of course we can stay. But you have to behave!” Then he looked at the adults.  “Maybe we should retreat and let the kids talk. Archie can stay and keep an eye out. One more hour?” Adam said as he looked at Swuna and Evelyn who didn’t seem that eager to leave to teenager alone at a beach restaurant with soft music and dimmed lights.

“I mean, what can go wrong? What kind of trouble can they get into here?” He continued, and both women looked at the teenagers and back at Adam, wondering just how dense he was, then nodded and both looked at the couple with a “behave” comment, then followed Adam out.

.

.

“She needs a lot of help,” Swuna said. “If what she said is correct, then she has lived a very poor life.” As they sat in the royal transport waiting for them.

“Yes, let us know if there is anything you need to help her. I’m afraid she might have some traumas she has to work through.” Evelyn said, and Swuna smiled.

“Luckily, our people have the trance-walk, so we don’t have to worry so much about her mental state. I’m worried more about her opinions about her people. The nobility can have a... how to say it... a very poor view of commoners, and her red hair will be a problem. They will view that as her being a half breed.”

“Strange considering the royal line seemed to have just that trait,” Adam replied, and Arus, who had joined them in the shuttle,  pulled up a pad and showed historical files about the old royal family.

The street was silent around them as the shuttle was parked near the restaurant, and the city had been shut down in a ten-block radius around the restaurant. Roks was out there somewhere making sure the kids were safe.

“Your own files might have been tampered with, but all other files from Wossir, Haran, and Tufons, among others, describe them the same way: red or reddish hair, golden skin, and violet eyes,” Arus said as pictures of the kings and queens were shown, all with the same trait.

“What? How did you get hold of these files?” Swuna said, confused as she looked at the files.

“My wife Monori. Her paladins of the lost word have been very skilled at uncovering historical facts. If you allow me, I will begin sharing these facts with the public, and then you can delay her revelation until King's Day. By then, I will have them expecting her to have red hair and violet eyes. It’s just four days away, and it’s the birthday of King Gansahu, the founder of the realm,” Arus said, and Swuna looked at him.

“Not many celebrate that day, but yes, it would fit, after all.. never mind,” she replied as she looked at Adam. She didn’t want to remind him that Chris was supposed to be the reincarnation of that King, but it would not be ignored by the masses. “It will give us a few days to prepare her, and the rumors are already out. I need to hide her somewhere.”

“Camelot,” Evelyn said, and Adam looked at her.

“You sure?”

“No, but it’s the safest place, we just have to have Archie walk behind them at all times with a cold water hose.”

“We can ask Wei to help.”

“NO! I don’t want to be a grandmother yet!” Evelyn said, and Swuna laughed as Adam suddenly got it and looked towards the restaurant.

“Shit!”

.

.

“You already met Wei, Mai, and Cleo, and these are the rest of my siblings,” Chris said as they stood in the private lounge, getting ready for breakfast. Miri could not believe it. The apartment they had put her in was enormous, and it had a huge, soft bed with a large holographic screen that she could use to watch movies, as well as a holo phone to call Chris. They had been talking the whole night until she fell asleep. She felt like she was dreaming until now. Chris was next to her, and she felt safe there because she had all their eyes on her.

“This is Sam and Sarah, and those cute little ones are Rohan, Saka, and Jasmine; they just turned four.”

“She is pretty!” Jasmine said

“Of course she is, she is supposed to be the prettiest in the galaxy.” Sam said, and Sarah tilted her head, looking at her. Miri blushed and wanted to hide as Wei slapped the back of Sam's head.

“Hey! It's what the books say.” Sam blurred out.

“Yeah, and Dad's supposed to be a god and Chris the king of kings. It’s just stories. Let’s eat. I’m starving, and I promised to take Kiki to the pool afterwards.”

“Can we join?”  And Wei halfway agreed as he walked over to sit down.

Adam and Evelyn watched them as Miker called him up, and he excused himself to talk to it. “What's up, son?”

“Not much, Dad, just Daddy is down in the lab again with one of his good ideas, something about the Nanoplanet’s atmospheric program. You've got to tell him to hold back. I’m looking over the blueprints. It will work, but the planet has to have no atmosphere first, or it will burn it up in an attempt to change the atmosphere.”

“Okay, put me through. And thanks for the warning.”

“No problem, Dad. Did Chris find a girlfriend?”

“Yep, she seems to be a nice girl too.”

“Yes! My boy just won me 10 K in credits. Kuntar should not bet against the universe.” Miker said as he changed the channel and Jork came into view, deep in concentration. Adam sighted.

“Jork!” No reaction, so Adam turned on a sound filter and spoke louder. “JORK!”

He sat up, looked around, then saw the holoprojector. “That bastard… yeah?”

“He is our son, and he kinda likes his atmosphere as it is,” Adam replied, and Jork looked at him as he tilted his head.

“What are you talking about?”

“Nanoplanet’s atmospheric program! He said there is a flaw in the program. Something about it burning up any existing atmosphere in the process.”

“No..” he grabbed the pad, searched through it, stopped, and cursed before turning back to Adam. “Yeah, I see that.. now.. hmm yeah I will work on that,” Jork said as he checked the blueprint. “Did he find a girlfriend?”

“Yeah, he did. She seems nice.”

“Good, that boy just won me 50 K,” Jork said, and Adam shook his head as he chuckled.  

“Who didn’t bet?”

“Hyd-Drin. Only because he didn’t know he was heading there. He is going to be so pissed when he finds out.”

“Ha ha. Funny, well, if Chris asks you for a ship or a personal gate to Skia-An, then you have to tell him no. Got it?”

“Hmm, that is doable. Okay, I’m on it.” Then Jork cut the line as Adam cursed as he turned back to the table. He saw Chris blushing as all his siblings were trying to tell Miri the most embarrassing thing about him. When he sat down next to Evelyn, she leaned over and whispered, “She is going to fit in well. Even Sarah likes her, and you know how protective she is of Chris.”

“I’m surprised Sam hasn’t tried to get them married.”

“He tried, and they both blushed.” She said and chuckled as Adam lifted Jasmine up on his lap.

“So, what's that about?” She asked, and he shrugged.

“Oh, just Jork almost accidentally burning up the atmosphere in his new Nanoplanet’s atmospheric program. Miker spotted the mistake, but he had locked him out. You know how lost in his work he gets.”

“Yeah, I’m glad he keeps an eye on him.” She replied.

“Yeah, and they all bet on Chris finding a girlfriend on this trip.”

“I know, I lost 150k on him. But I’m happy for him.” She replied as she looked at Miri, “Damn, she is beautiful.”

Adam just looked at her, stunned. “You bet against him?”

“And you didn’t?”

“I didn’t bet?” Then he had to help Jasmine down, as she found her parents boring and went to find someone more interesting.

“Well, he didn’t look at any girls, not even other Scisya girls at Dirt. I thought it was a safe bet.” She replied.

“Was it now?” he said, and she just looked back at Miri.

“Damn, why did he find such a beauty, and she is so nice. I can't even be jealous.” Evelyn muttered as she drank her coffee.

\-four days later-

Miri An stood inside the castle, looking nervously at the balcony she was going to walk out on. She looked at Chris, who smiled.  Just looking at him made her tummy feel weird and happy.  He was dressed up in nice clothes, but had been told he was not to show his face on the balcony. They might force them to marry there and then if he did. She bit her lips, then kissed him quickly,

“For good luck.” He smiled, and her old friend Hil Ma covered her mouth in shock at just how brazen she had become. Hil ma had not believed it when she had been summoned to the palace and saw her. They had been crying and screaming in joy in her new room. She was now a court lady.

Out on the balcony, she heard High priestess Swuna D’asha.

“The crown was found by the Prince, and he gave it to his future queen.” As she spoke, a hologram showing the meeting and him handing her the crown was shown.  They had forgotten the droids had, of course, recorded everything happening.

“And like a true fairytale princess, she ran away with her prince.” The hologram changed to her and Chris sharing an ice cream, staring deeply at each other. “But not only does she fulfill the prophecies, she is also a direct descendant of the royal line. This has been discovered through testing her DNA against the royal tombs.”

Miri took a deep breath. Those pirates who wanted to breed scisya with natural red hair had accidentally kept the royal line alive, it was ironic how that had worked out. Outside, the crowd was growing wild. And after a few more lines, she saw the soft green light and walked out to meet the crowd, not as Miri An, former slave and orphan, but as Miri An, a royal princess and future queen of Skia-An. She looked down at her people and waved.

Beet juice, derived from the beetroot ( Beta vulgaris), is a vibrant crimson liquid packed with nutrients beneficial for overall health. While often enjoyed as a refreshing drink, it's increasingly recognized for its potential health-boosting properties. Beetroots are an excellent source of dietary nitrates, vitamins (including folate and vitamin C), minerals (like potassium and iron), and antioxidants. A 100ml serving provides a significant amount of these vital nutrients, as detailed in the nutritional breakdown below, although the exact composition can vary based on factors like growing conditions and processing methods. This rich nutritional profile contributes to the many health benefits associated with beet juice. What are the benefits of drinking beetroot juice?

# Understanding Daily Consumption of Beet Juice

The question, ""Can I drink beet juice every day?"", is frequently asked. The answer is nuanced: for most healthy individuals, moderate daily consumption is likely safe and may offer several benefits. However, it's crucial to be mindful of quantity and potential side effects. While some sources suggest potential benefits from daily intake, it's not universally recommended to consume large quantities.

>The benefits of incorporating beet juice into your daily routine could include improved blood pressure, enhanced athletic performance, and increased energy levels due to the high nitrate content.

However, excessive intake might lead to gastrointestinal issues, potential kidney stone formation in susceptible individuals due to the high oxalate content, and blood sugar fluctuations in people with diabetes. Therefore, moderation is key. A good starting point might be a small glass (around 8 ounces) per day. Always consult your doctor before making significant dietary changes, particularly if you have pre-existing health conditions like kidney problems or diabetes. For pregnant women, it's especially important to consult their physician before adding beet juice to their diet. can i drink beet juice while pregnant Remember that beet juice should complement a healthy lifestyle, not replace necessary medical treatments or dietary guidelines. The question of whether you should drink beet juice every day is ultimately a personal one, guided by your individual health needs and preferences. 

# Can I Drink Beet Juice Everyday? Key Considerations

The short answer is: yes, for most people, but moderation is key. While What are the benefits of drinking beetroot juice? are numerous, including improved blood pressure and athletic performance thanks to its nitrate content, overconsumption can lead to certain issues. One person might find they can easily incorporate a daily serving of beetroot juice into their routine, while another might experience digestive issues. It's all about listening to your body and finding what works best for you.

Think of it like any other healthy addition to your diet. You wouldn't necessarily eat an entire head of broccoli in one sitting! The same principle applies here. It's best to start slowly, perhaps with half a glass daily, and gradually increase your intake as tolerated. Many individuals find that incorporating beet juice into their afternoon routine provides a natural energy boost, acting as a healthier alternative to an afternoon coffee or sugary snack.

I noticed today that their tip jar has a little sign that stated that all “tips” would become a donation to the Christian mission non profit that the owners of the coffee shop are involved with. I have no problem with them being a faith based business and I could care less that all proceeds benefit their mission. I just think it’s insane and unethical to take your barista’s tips. 

I paid with a card and the tip screen on their point of sale has absolutely no mention that the tip money isn’t going to the baristas. I only noticed on the physical cash tip jar. I asked if they get to keep their credit card tips or do they go to the mission. And with a defeated, or possibly annoyed look (they probably get asked about this routinely) they said that it all goes to the mission. I chose to then not tip because as an atheist I’m not comfortable supporting a Christian mission. If I want to use my money to make an impact in my community there are plenty of ways to do so without dealing with a religion that is constantly used to harm people I care about. 

My only question is that with them being a non profit I don’t know if this changes anything or if there’s some loophole or what, but aren’t the baristas legally entitled to their tips? Isn’t taking their tips wage theft???",24,1758431692.0,antiwork,9,0.88,False

- **Privacy:** Keep your life yours! No need to share your breakfast every morning or what you’re binging on Netflix. 
- **Focus on Value:** Without the distractions of personal branding, you can truly focus on delivering value and quality content.
- **Less Burnout:** No cameras! Just pure strategy and creativity. Plus, throwing on sweatpants and a hoodie is a win in my book!

### **Faceless Growth Strategies to Consider:**
1. **Content Creation Without the Face**: 
   - Ever listen to a podcast? Exactly! Use your voice or even create engaging videos using animation, slides, or stock footage. 
   - *Pro tip:* You can also repurpose the same content for different platforms to reach wider audiences!

2. **Automated Marketing**: 
   - Tools are your best friends! Set up email campaigns, social media scheduling, and use SEO tools to drive traffic without lifting a finger.
   - Check out this **[handy guide](https://www.checkout-ds24.com/redir/540531/maximizeme/)** to maximize your growth with automation. It takes the stress out of the equation!

3. **Affiliate Marketing**: 
   - Why not promote products that align with your audience without showing your face? It’s like sharing your favorite snacks without ever having to take a selfie with them. 
   - You get commissions without needing to be the star of the show. Win-win!

4. **Leverage Community Engagement**:
   - Start niche forums or groups! People love sharing, and it doesn’t require you to be in the limelight. 
   - Just imagine: you can build a thriving community while sipping your coffee in your PJs. Blissful, right?

### **The Bottom Line**
You’re not just ditching the face; you’re keeping the pace! 🚀 There’s power in anonymity, and a whole new world of opportunities awaiting you. It’s about working smarter, not harder, and leveraging tools and strategies that truly drive results.

So, what’s holding you back from embracing your faceless adventure? Have you tried any of these strategies, or have any to add? Share your secrets, and let’s dive into the conversation! 😊",1,1758431632.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

1nmjes0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1nmjes0/this_one_trick_helped_me_make_friends_as_a/,This one trick helped me make friends as a socially awkward person,"I used to panic in every social situation. I’d stand there overthinking my face, my hands, my voice. At work, I’d hide in the bathroom between meetings. At parties, I’d pretend to text someone just to avoid standing alone. I wasn’t shy, I just didn’t know how to connect. But something changed a couple years ago. I started building little “identities” for myself in different contexts. Not fake personas, just props that gave people a reason to talk to me. Like bringing a deck of cards to a bar. Or being “the tea person” at the office. I didn’t realize it then, but this weird little hack gave me social gravity. And it rewired how I thought about conversations.

I started reading everything I could about human connection. Harvard research showed that people who ask more follow-up questions are liked way more. Not because they’re charming, but because they come off as responsive. You ask, they answer, you follow up. That’s it. A study from Harvard Business School found this to be one of the top predictors of likability, even in speed dating. Pair that with the “liking gap” (PubMed), which shows we all underestimate how much people liked us after a chat, and you’ve got a killer combo: ask more questions, and stop assuming you were awkward.

But the real game changer for me was hearing Andrew Huberman explain the social homeostasis system in our brain. He says our nervous system literally needs the right amount of connection to function, just like sleep or water. No wonder silence in the breakroom feels painful. I stopped seeing it as a personal flaw. I saw it as undertraining.

Another one that stuck with me: mere exposure effect. We like people more the more we see them. That’s why I started wearing my local baseball cap every time I hit the coffee shop. Same time, same place. Made it easier for strangers to become regulars. Same goes for the tea box I carry at work. These tiny cues became my “social cues.” Easy, low pressure, and they work.

“Captivate” by Vanessa Van Edwards cracked the code on likability for me. She’s a behavioral scientist who studies first impressions, and this book showed me how to build warmth before trying to prove myself. Turns out, you don’t need to “perform”, you just need a repeatable framework. Vanessa’s breakdowns made socializing feel less random and more like a game I could learn.

“The Good Life” by Robert Waldinger (Harvard’s 80-year happiness study) made me rethink what really matters. It’s not success. It’s not hustle. It’s relationships. This book helped me see that connection is health. And it made me appreciate every micro-interaction, even awkward ones, in a whole new way. Insanely good read.

I used to roll my eyes at “How to Win Friends and Influence People,” but it’s one of the few timeless ones that holds up. This isn’t a business manual, it’s a human manual. Carnegie just gets how people work. Ask questions. Remember names. Be genuinely interested. Obvious? Maybe. But when you’re spiraling with social anxiety, it helps to be reminded.

One of my favorite podcast hosts recommended this app called BeFreed, and honestly it changed the game for me. It’s a personalized AI learning app built by a team from Columbia U. It turns expert talks, research, and bestselling books into podcast-style episodes tailored to your goals. You get to pick your host’s tone, I picked a smoky, sassy one that sounds like Samantha from Her. It even updates your learning roadmap as you listen. One episode blended insights from Captivate, Dale Carnegie, and Huberman to explain why I freeze in convos, and how to fix it. Felt like the personalized cheat code I’d been waiting for.

The Huberman Lab episode on “Social Bonding” is a must. It covers the biology of eye contact, voice tone, and why synchronized movement (like walking while talking) instantly builds connection. I started suggesting “walk and talks” with coworkers and it changed the vibe completely. Less pressure, more flow.

Charisma on Command is a YouTube channel I used to binge at 2 a.m. before awkward social events. They break down real interactions, from celeb interviews to speeches, and explain what works and what doesn’t. Helped me stop trying to be funny and start focusing on being present. And likable. And human.

I also gave Meetup another shot. I used to think it was for boomers, but I found a couple low-key writing and game nights through it. It helped me get reps in when I was still scared of “small talk.” Zero pressure, just vibes and mutual awkwardness.

I don’t think I magically became “social.” I just stopped seeing socializing as a test and started treating it like a habit I could build. The science helped. The stories helped. But most of all, reading daily helped. Knowledge rewires your mind. The more I read, the less I judged myself. The more I understood others, the more I liked people again. And that’s when the real friendships started.",12,1758431598.0,bodylanguage,1,0.83,False

(Spoiler: It's Unexpected!),"Are you feeling a bit like a tin man these days? 🌼 You know, stiff and creaky, like you just need a little oil to get moving? Trust me, you’re not alone! As we inch past the big 5-0, our bodies like to remind us that we aren’t as spry as we used to be. But here’s the kicker: Turns out, those little morning stretches or a casual stroll in the afternoon can work wonders. The real question is *which one* packs a bigger punch?

I recently decided to do an experiment (aka my nerdy way of finding answers). I tried gentle morning stretches and then compared that to afternoon walks. Curious what I found? Spoiler alert: it’s not what you might think! 

**AM Stretches: The Gentle Wake-Up Call**  
Starting the day with some light stretches has its perks:
- **Increased Flexibility:** My shoulder didn’t feel like it was stuck in concrete after a few simple stretches.
- **Mood Booster:** Who knew a good morning twist could perk up my mood quicker than coffee?
- **Energizing:** Stretching definitely got the blood flowing, which felt awesome!

But there’s something about the afternoon stroll that just hits differently.

**Afternoon Walks: The Secret Sauce**  
Here’s what I noticed after my post-lunch wanders:
- **Nature’s Chill Pill:** Being outside, even just for a short spell, instantly elevated my stress level from *crazy* to *chill*.
- **Creative Spark:** A sudden burst of ideas often popped into my head as I strolled! Walking seems to unlock the imagination.
- **Feel-Good Endorphins:** Nothing like a relaxed walk to remind you that you can, in fact, feel young at heart. 

**So which one should you pick?**  
Here’s where it gets interesting—both have their merits, but the afternoon walks edged ahead in terms of overall energy and mood lift. Who would’ve thought? 

Maybe it’s the combo of movement and fresh air, or perhaps the mid-day break pulls you away from the daily grind. Either way, I can safely say that both practices contributed significantly to my energy levels—and it feels great not to be a stiff, rusty version of myself.

Let’s not forget—staying active after 50 is key to feeling your best! Remember, it’s not just about the stretches or those steps; it’s about *finding what makes you feel strongest*. If you want to join in on the vibe of being stronger and more energized, we believe in strongest people. Check out this resource for some cool motivation.

Here's a little reminder: your body is like a fabulous car—keep it in good condition, and it’ll take you places. 🚗✨

1nmje2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/GermanKitchenCabinet/comments/1nmje2m/highend_kitchens_the_premium_features_you_should/,High-End Kitchens: The Premium Features You Should Know About,"

Luxury kitchens are more than just a place to prepare meals—they're a fusion of style, function, and opulence. Homeowners today are investing in high-end kitchen designs that reflect their personal tastes while maximizing efficiency. From sleek modern aesthetics to timeless classic layouts, luxury kitchens serve as the heart of the home, where style meets substance.

## Open Layouts and Flow

A hallmark of luxury kitchen design is a spacious, open layout. These kitchens are crafted to encourage movement, conversation, and functionality. Gone are the days of walled-in spaces; now, seamless transitions between kitchen, dining, and living areas define the modern luxury aesthetic. The result? A more inviting atmosphere perfect for entertaining or spending quality time with family.

## Bespoke Cabinetry and Storage

Custom cabinetry is a defining feature of luxury kitchens. Whether it’s floor-to-ceiling units or under-counter drawers, bespoke storage solutions offer both elegance and practicality. Rich wood finishes, soft-close mechanisms, and clever organizational systems make a significant difference. Tailored to fit unique needs and tastes, this level of customization truly elevates a kitchen space.

## High-End Appliances and Professional Planning

In a luxury kitchen, appliances aren't just tools—they're showpieces. Homeowners invest in brands known for performance and style, such as Sub-Zero, Wolf, or Miele. Built-in refrigerators, professional-grade ranges, and smart ovens are common. These features are seamlessly integrated into the design, offering the ultimate in cooking precision and aesthetic appeal. Creating a luxury kitchen involves more than just choosing premium materials—it requires a well-thought-out process guided by professionals. For homeowners seeking exceptional [kitchen remodeling in Westchester](https://www.leichtwestchester.com/design/process), collaborating with experienced designers ensures every detail is meticulously planned and executed to perfection.

## Premium Countertops and Finishes

Countertops in luxury kitchens often feature natural stones like marble, granite, or quartzite. These surfaces add a tactile elegance and are as durable as they are beautiful. Complementary backsplashes, statement hoods, and brushed metal hardware enhance the overall visual impact. Texture, color, and finish choices play a huge role in achieving a cohesive and striking look.

## Showroom Inspiration and Lighting Design

Many homeowners start their luxury kitchen journey by exploring inspirational spaces. Visiting a well-curated [luxury kitchen showroom](https://www.leichtwestchester.com/showrooms/greenwich) can provide invaluable insight into current trends, layout ideas, and material combinations. These showrooms allow you to see, touch, and experience the potential of your future kitchen before making final decisions. Lighting can make or break a luxury kitchen. Task lighting under cabinets, pendant lights over islands, and recessed fixtures create layered illumination that is both functional and atmospheric. Modern smart lighting systems allow for mood control, color temperature adjustment, and automated schedules, offering both convenience and flair.

## Statement Islands and Smart Technology

Luxury kitchens often revolve around a statement island. These central features are not just additional workspaces but design anchors. Islands may incorporate seating, storage, prep sinks, or even wine fridges. Their design often contrasts with or complements the rest of the kitchen, adding a bold visual element. Technology is also at the forefront of modern luxury kitchen design. From voice-activated faucets to refrigerators that track grocery lists, smart integration enhances usability. Hidden charging stations, automated blinds, and app-controlled lighting are common features that add ease to daily life while maintaining a sleek aesthetic.

## Indoor-Outdoor Living and Artisan Touches

In many upscale homes, luxury kitchens are designed with outdoor integration in mind. Retractable doors, outdoor kitchen extensions, and garden views help blur the lines between interior and exterior. This connection with nature creates a sense of openness and expands the usability of kitchen spaces. What truly sets a luxury kitchen apart are the personal touches. Handcrafted tiles, custom range hoods, and one-of-a-kind hardware pieces offer a bespoke element that standard designs can’t match. These artisan features add character, charm, and a sense of individuality to the space.

## Energy Efficiency and High-End Displays

Luxury and sustainability are no longer mutually exclusive. Many high-end kitchens incorporate energy-efficient appliances and eco-friendly materials without compromising on style. LED lighting, water-saving faucets, and responsibly sourced cabinetry are just a few examples of how luxury design embraces environmental responsibility. One of the best ways to finalize your kitchen design is by visiting displays that showcase the highest levels of craftsmanship. A visit to a luxury kitchen showroom in Greenwich can expose you to innovative design concepts, cutting-edge technology, and unique material pairings that spark creativity and refine your vision.

## The Power of Personalization

Every luxury kitchen should reflect the homeowner’s lifestyle and taste. Whether it's a built-in espresso machine for the coffee enthusiast or a spice drawer tailored for a home chef, customization is key. Designers now prioritize personalization over trend-following, ensuring that each kitchen is as unique as its owner.

## Conclusion

A luxury kitchen is more than just a space—it’s a statement. From layout to lighting, appliances to artisan details, each element contributes to a harmonious blend of function and finesse. With thoughtful planning, expert guidance, and a touch of inspiration, your dream kitchen can become a stunning reality that enhances both your home and your daily life.

New here - not much of a Reddit user, but like Joey walking into an audition with confidence (even when he forgets the lines), I figured - why not? And now I’m hoping to maybe find my lobster?

So, who am I? Well, think of me as a mashup of all six FRIENDS:

* **Ross**: I’m 28, CF by choice, living in Delhi, and yes, I have my life together (minus the divorces). Also, I like thinking deeply, sometimes too much, but emotional maturity counts!
* **Rachel**: Independent, financially stable, and working at an MNC. I worked my way up with long hours and sacrifices, and now I’m all about personal growth and building the good life.
* **Chandler**: I am the guy who believes in commitment, but without the traditional marriage strings attached. I want loyalty and devotion, not societal “scripts”.
* **Monica**: Mature, organized, love cooking, and value honesty. I have done the inner work, healed, and created a happy, stable place for myself. Now I am ready to share it with someone who can match my energy.
* **Joey**: I love good food (vegetarian), OTT binges, music, traveling, and meeting fun people. I am not the biggest party animal, but I can totally charm my way through one. And don’t worry, I do share food!
* **Phoebe**: I believe life is meant to be lived freely and fully, not just following what society says. That’s why I’m CF by choice. Also, I love volunteering - spreading good vibes where I can.

**Who I’m looking for:** Someone who’s also CF, financially stable, logical, open-minded, vegetarian, non-smoker, and can make me laugh (if you can handle Chandler’s sarcasm, Ross’s rambling, and Phoebe’s randomness, you’ll do just fine). Bonus if you hate summers, love monsoons, and adore winters.

**Deal breakers:** Dry texters (only a “Hi” - it is the Gunther of conversation starters), negativity, extremist views, or people stuck in their past. Basically, please don’t be Janice (I don't mind the annoying laughs though!)

1nmjbkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1nmjbkg/demonic_attachmentspiritual_warfare/,Demonic Attachment/Spiritual Warfare,"How do I protect my mother from a man who I believe may be under demonic influence?

Shortly after divorcing my father in 2020, My mother began talking to a man she met on a dating app. They’ve been dating off and on for the past five years. She decided to move in with him in February of this year and immediately moved out in March after discovering that he was drinking. He has consistently struggled with alcoholism for the past 20 years and was not supposed to touch alcohol after his trip to rehab in 2023.

Today when I visited my mother, she revealed to me that she has been in contact with the man despite the events of March and proceeded to tell me about an interesting event that occurred last week. She said that on Wednesday, she asked him to come over her house and drop off a toolbox that she left with him after moving out. He came over and when my mother opened the door for him, a fly came inside the house. After he entered the house and my mother shut the door, she began to notice that the fly seemed as though it multiplied multiple times in a minute. The new flies were not common house flies; they were the kind of flies that buzz around animal poop. She genuinely could not pinpoint where they were coming from. They covered the ceiling, the walls, and were flying around just about every room in the house. Once ex boyfriend dropped off the toolbox and left, the flies were gone. She described it as “almost biblical”. On top of this, she mentioned that immediately following the times he has come over the past few months, she, without fail, has found a live roach somewhere in her house even though she keeps her house immaculately clean.

What worried me the most was another event that took place just yesterday. Ex boyfriend called my mom and asked her to fill out a Word document that he did not have the patience to do himself. My mother told him she wasn’t going to secretary work for him and hung up the phone. He called back and began to get violent and verbally abusive which was extremely unusual considering that he always maintained a very melancholy temperament regardless if he was drunk or sober. My mom hung up and blocked/deleted him on everything. Since then she has gone through a series of unfortunate events including, but not limited to, having her car windows smashed out in a business parking garage, and tripping over a raised part of flooring at her friend’s house and falling on a glass coffee table.

Is this man practicing Santeria? Is he demonically possessed? His home was once saged and the people doing the saging asked if they could sage him individually because they felt a sort of demonic energy around him. Maybe I am just reading into all of this a little too much.

If any of you do believe my mother could be in a spiritually dangerous place right now, please let me know how I can help her. Are there any prayers I can pray over her/her house? She is a lukewarm Christian and will not pray for herself.",1,1758431271.0,TrueChristian,2,1.0,False

Luxury kitchens are more than just a place to prepare meals—they're a fusion of style, function, and opulence. Homeowners today are investing in high-end kitchen designs that reflect their personal tastes while maximizing efficiency. From sleek modern aesthetics to timeless classic layouts, luxury kitchens serve as the heart of the home, where style meets substance.

## Open Layouts and Flow

A hallmark of luxury kitchen design is a spacious, open layout. These kitchens are crafted to encourage movement, conversation, and functionality. Gone are the days of walled-in spaces; now, seamless transitions between kitchen, dining, and living areas define the modern luxury aesthetic. The result? A more inviting atmosphere perfect for entertaining or spending quality time with family.

## Bespoke Cabinetry and Storage

Custom cabinetry is a defining feature of luxury kitchens. Whether it’s floor-to-ceiling units or under-counter drawers, bespoke storage solutions offer both elegance and practicality. Rich wood finishes, soft-close mechanisms, and clever organizational systems make a significant difference. Tailored to fit unique needs and tastes, this level of customization truly elevates a kitchen space.

## High-End Appliances and Professional Planning

In a luxury kitchen, appliances aren't just tools—they're showpieces. Homeowners invest in brands known for performance and style, such as Sub-Zero, Wolf, or Miele. Built-in refrigerators, professional-grade ranges, and smart ovens are common. These features are seamlessly integrated into the design, offering the ultimate in cooking precision and aesthetic appeal. Creating a luxury kitchen involves more than just choosing premium materials—it requires a well-thought-out process guided by professionals. For homeowners seeking exceptional [kitchen remodeling in Westchester](https://www.leichtwestchester.com/design/process), collaborating with experienced designers ensures every detail is meticulously planned and executed to perfection.

## Premium Countertops and Finishes

Countertops in luxury kitchens often feature natural stones like marble, granite, or quartzite. These surfaces add a tactile elegance and are as durable as they are beautiful. Complementary backsplashes, statement hoods, and brushed metal hardware enhance the overall visual impact. Texture, color, and finish choices play a huge role in achieving a cohesive and striking look.

## Showroom Inspiration and Lighting Design

Many homeowners start their luxury kitchen journey by exploring inspirational spaces. Visiting a well-curated [luxury kitchen showroom](https://www.leichtwestchester.com/showrooms/greenwich) can provide invaluable insight into current trends, layout ideas, and material combinations. These showrooms allow you to see, touch, and experience the potential of your future kitchen before making final decisions. Lighting can make or break a luxury kitchen. Task lighting under cabinets, pendant lights over islands, and recessed fixtures create layered illumination that is both functional and atmospheric. Modern smart lighting systems allow for mood control, color temperature adjustment, and automated schedules, offering both convenience and flair.

## Statement Islands and Smart Technology

Luxury kitchens often revolve around a statement island. These central features are not just additional workspaces but design anchors. Islands may incorporate seating, storage, prep sinks, or even wine fridges. Their design often contrasts with or complements the rest of the kitchen, adding a bold visual element. Technology is also at the forefront of modern luxury kitchen design. From voice-activated faucets to refrigerators that track grocery lists, smart integration enhances usability. Hidden charging stations, automated blinds, and app-controlled lighting are common features that add ease to daily life while maintaining a sleek aesthetic.

## Indoor-Outdoor Living and Artisan Touches

In many upscale homes, luxury kitchens are designed with outdoor integration in mind. Retractable doors, outdoor kitchen extensions, and garden views help blur the lines between interior and exterior. This connection with nature creates a sense of openness and expands the usability of kitchen spaces. What truly sets a luxury kitchen apart are the personal touches. Handcrafted tiles, custom range hoods, and one-of-a-kind hardware pieces offer a bespoke element that standard designs can’t match. These artisan features add character, charm, and a sense of individuality to the space.

## Energy Efficiency and High-End Displays

Luxury and sustainability are no longer mutually exclusive. Many high-end kitchens incorporate energy-efficient appliances and eco-friendly materials without compromising on style. LED lighting, water-saving faucets, and responsibly sourced cabinetry are just a few examples of how luxury design embraces environmental responsibility. One of the best ways to finalize your kitchen design is by visiting displays that showcase the highest levels of craftsmanship. A visit to a luxury kitchen showroom in Greenwich can expose you to innovative design concepts, cutting-edge technology, and unique material pairings that spark creativity and refine your vision.

## The Power of Personalization

Every luxury kitchen should reflect the homeowner’s lifestyle and taste. Whether it's a built-in espresso machine for the coffee enthusiast or a spice drawer tailored for a home chef, customization is key. Designers now prioritize personalization over trend-following, ensuring that each kitchen is as unique as its owner.

## Conclusion

A luxury kitchen is more than just a space—it’s a statement. From layout to lighting, appliances to artisan details, each element contributes to a harmonious blend of function and finesse. With thoughtful planning, expert guidance, and a touch of inspiration, your dream kitchen can become a stunning reality that enhances both your home and your daily life.

We hit it off and we had a great friendship. We were coworkers, they even gave me Covid for sharing chicken wings 😂. We grew apart for a bit and started hanging out maybe last November to study for our undergrad. 

December to April, I was in a really rough patch of my life. I lost my job, and I was trying hard to find one, and having to manage being the SAHD. My family was getting really mentally and emotionally abusing, and I really really was not okay. This friend was there for me and was so kind, they would buy me coffee and show me places (I’m a foodie) knowing I had no money. I told them I’d repay them or I’d figure out ways to cover the bill. I felt bad at times, but we made it work. (I know I’m an asshole for this) they were having love life issues, and I did my best to listen, give advice, and just talk.

May comes along, I found a job, and they were graduating and going on a trip for their birthday. I wanted to do something special and take them to a fancy restaurant. I wanted to have their best friends come and celebrate with us. So it was gonna be 4. They left on vacation, came back and didn’t tell me when they would return. Come to find out they had an actual party, and I wasn’t invited. No biggie. It’s all good. As long as they had fun and happy, I’m solid. Their graduation comes along, I was so excited and again no invitation. I ended up making them a grad bouquet that I made. Again no biggie. As long as they are happy. After that, communication starts going dark. I did continue texting and hyping them up. Willing to offer to help them move out of their house. But I’d hit dead ends. I understood and gave them space. 

June comes along, they have a loss in their life. And I immediately reach out and try to talk. They responded well, and they just needed space. Understood. I did my best to do that. 

August, I reached out and asked if they were okay. And seeing when we could hang out. I got a text with the words: “let me check my work schedule, it’s messed up. I’ll let you know.” I have been waiting ever since. I’ve seen them on my social media, being out with other people. Seeing them at places I wish I could be. I’ll post on social media and there’s no activity on my end from them. Understandable. I’ll interact with their stuff and get left on seen. 

Am I overreacting when I say, it’s time to end the friendship? ",1,1758430986.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

Shortly after divorcing my father in 2020, My mother began talking to a man she met on a dating app. They’ve been dating off and on for the past five years. She decided to move in with him in February of this year and immediately moved out in March after discovering that he was drinking. He has consistently struggled with alcoholism for the past 20 years and was not supposed to touch alcohol after his trip to rehab in 2023. 

Today when I visited my mother, she revealed to me that she has been in contact with the man despite the events of March and proceeded to tell me about an interesting event that occurred last week. She said that on Wednesday, she asked him to come over her house and drop off a toolbox that she left with him after moving out. He came over and when my mother opened the door for him, a fly came inside the house. After he entered the house and my mother shut the door, she began to notice that the fly seemed as though it multiplied multiple times in a minute. The new flies were not common house flies; they were the kind of flies that buzz around animal poop. She genuinely could not pinpoint where they were coming from. They covered the ceiling, the walls, and were flying around just about every room in the house. Once ex boyfriend dropped off the toolbox and left, the flies were gone. She described it as “almost biblical”. On top of this, she mentioned that immediately following the times he has come over the past few months, she, without fail, has found a live roach somewhere in her house even though she keeps her house immaculately clean. 

What worried me the most was another event that took place just yesterday. Ex boyfriend called my mom and asked her to fill out a Word document that he did not have the patience to do himself. My mother told him she wasn’t going to secretary work for him and hung up the phone. He called back and began to get violent and verbally abusive which was extremely unusual considering that he always maintained a very melancholy temperament regardless if he was drunk or sober. My mom hung up and blocked/deleted him on everything. Since then she has gone through a series of unfortunate events including, but not limited to, having her car windows smashed out in a business parking garage, and tripping over a raised part of flooring at her friend’s house and falling on a glass coffee table. 

Is this man practicing Santeria? Is he demonically possessed? His home was once saged and the people doing the saging asked if they could sage him individually because they felt a sort of demonic energy around him. Maybe I am just reading into all of this a little too much. 

If any of you do believe my mother could be in a spiritually dangerous place right now, please let me know how I can help her. Are there any prayers I can pray over her/her house? She is a lukewarm Christian and will not pray for herself. ",4,1758430518.0,Catholicism,1,1.0,False

The first entry wasn’t mine.

You’ll spill coffee on your shirt at 8:12 a.m.

The handwriting wasn’t familiar. Neat, deliberate, nothing like my rushed scrawl. I figured maybe the store sold used ones, and someone had scribbled a leftover note.

The next morning, at exactly 8:12, my cup slipped. Coffee down the front of my shirt.

I laughed it off. Coincidence.

But the following night, another line appeared:
You’ll forget to lock the door when you leave.

The next day, I came home to find my keys still in the lock.

By the third entry, I stopped laughing.
You’ll re-read that text thread you promised to delete.

And I did. At midnight, guilty, scrolling through messages I swore I’d moved past. The diary knew.

I tried to break the pattern. Took a different bus, skipped breakfast, left the lights on. The diary shifted with me.
You’ll decide not to eat, then regret the dizziness.
You’ll stand on the bus, pretending it’s by choice.

It wasn’t predicting anymore;it was narrating.

The entries grew cruel.
You’ll check the mirror again, wishing you looked different.
You’ll wonder if anyone would even notice if you disappeared.

Things I never said aloud. Things I barely let myself think.

Then it started bleeding into the real world. A coworker repeated a sentence from the page as if she’d read it herself. Strangers glanced at me like they knew my secrets. Every word in the diary was tightening around me, pulling me into its script.

Tonight, I opened it with trembling hands. The final page was already filled in:

Tonight, you’ll write your last page. After this, the diary won’t need you anymore.

On their website, they clearly mention that it is a ""universal"" 58 mm commercial grade portafilter. They do not, however, clearly mention that the lugs are not meant for ""universal"" use. When a newbie, like me, buys an equipment or a mod, terms like ""universal"" are comforting but what I did not realise were that the lug placement was very different from the stock portafilter that comes with the Gaggia. If you look at the last picture, the portafilter tightens toward the right of the machine as opposed to being almost perpendicular or protruding outside. This renders my steam wand useless if the portafilter is plugged in.

Sure, it is also my fault that I wasn't mindful about the lugs but why call it ""universal""? We all know the portafilters and baskets already come in universal sizes like 58mm and 51mm.

I wanted to buy a beginner setup and after lurking on this subreddit for a few weeks had decided to either get Breville Bambino (standard) or Bambino Plus. Most places have the plus model for $399, which seemed too steep as a beginner and the standard one for $299. 
I was set on buying the standard for 299 and found on this group that they go on sale in TJMaxx/Homegoods/Marshalls for $249 and Plus for $349. 
On calling Homegoods to check for availability of Bambino, they mentioned Plus was on clearance for $299. 

Really happy with the purchase and loved the first latte it made.

Now, I need to buy a decent coffee grinder. I have heard Baratza Encore goes well with the Bambino.

But then… I’m also not a drinker or a smoker (not cigarette or weed) and queer gatherings tend to be in spaces where these two are paired together.

I want to be able to go to a coffee shop and yap without my friend having to constantly bring up a joint or their vape… I try to be flexible with my current friends and I love them but that is the main reason I try not to hang out with them too often. I’m not used to the smoke because I’m not a smoker so it honestly makes me uncomfortable.

Same with alcohol, if you don’t drink you are not in the same mindset the rest of the group is. And I can drink but my max is 2 drinks because I don’t like getting drunk or taking care of drunk people which is what happens when I go out with my current friends, I end up being the designated driver.

In any case I do have a couple of friends who aren’t into it either but my bff is married to his husband and they are busy most of the time and my other chill friend group is kind of growing apart because some found jobs further and life just happens.

I just feel like I really want to find community and new friends with who I can hang out with without having to always put my comfort to the side to accommodate them…

1nmiwax,https://i.redd.it/mobh333n6gqf1.jpeg,Amy’s Diary – Sunday at the Park,"When I woke up this morning, I was still giggling about my Oktoberfest dream with Vanessa Knightwalker. I rushed to the kitchen, where Mom and my sisters were having breakfast, and shouted, “Guess what! My belly squished with Vanessa Knightwalker’s belly last night!”

The room went silent for two seconds… then exploded in laughter.

Jennifer almost spit out her coffee. Vicky covered her face, muttering, “Only you, Amy.” Melissa and Heather laughed so hard they leaned on each other. Gillian pushed up her glasses, trying to sound serious, “Amy, are you sure your subconscious isn’t just obsessed with belly collisions?” Linda and Nina rolled on the floor, and Shelley teased, “Vanessa Knightwalker will quit journalism if she hears about this!”

Even Mom chuckled, shaking her head while patting my back, “Amy, your imagination is going to outgrow even your belly one day.”

Later, since it was still school break, I went out to meet my friends at the park. The sun was shining, and the air felt so fresh. Carmen had just finished her model photoshoot, Kira brought along her sketchbook, Penny carried snacks from her aunt’s trip, Winfrey waved with her big smile, and Siu Ling and Monique came straight after their little weekend jobs.

We all sat together on the park benches, and of course, I couldn’t keep my mouth shut. “Guys, you won’t believe this—I dreamed Vanessa Knightwalker reported at Oktoberfest with me! And our bellies smushed together!”

Their reactions were priceless. Carmen gasped dramatically like it was the cover of a magazine. Kira dropped her pencil, shaking with laughter. Penny nearly choked on her cookie. Winfrey’s cheeks went pink as she covered her mouth, giggling. Siu Ling said, “Amy, you’re ridiculous,” and Monique added, “I swear, one day your belly is going to have its own fan club.”

I plopped back on the grass, my belly wobbling, and laughed with them until my sides hurt. It felt so good—like my dream had turned into a real celebration, just with my friends instead of Vanessa.",1,1758429814.0,u_FunRestaurant3384,0,1.0,False

1nmirpr,https://i.redd.it/us9cwjbz1gqf1.jpeg,Some thoughts on Kilian's Narcotics & Liquors (& Dupes!),"Rankings are out of five. Kilian samples came from the company site and Mercari, some dupe samples from OverSprayMe and Decantika. These were all tested on skin.

**General observations:** Most Kilian scents have good longevity but sillage is so-so. This is fine for me because I just want to smell myself or for people to get a whiff if they get close. Hugging friends often yields compliments.

The prices are a lot - Princess is semi-reasonable but most of the others are $$$$. That said, there are tons of affordable decants and dupes, and the company sells travel sizes (mostly $50/7.5ml, Princess is $37/10ml).

# The Narcotics

* **Princess - 5/5** \- The one that turned me on to gourmands. The green tea/matcha/marshmallow is so gorgeous with just a hint of ginger. Very mellow and understated, the compliment I get is 'you smell so lovely and feminine but not like you're wearing perfume.' It's a perfect year-round day or night scent and an absolute comfort.
* **Princess Eau Fraiche - 2/5** \- Very heavy on the bergamot with a dash of green tea/ginger and minimal marshmallow. It softens some in the drydown, though it's still much more citrus than sweet. Bergamot is one of my favorite notes but here it felt overpowering and unbalanced. I blind bought a bottle because I couldn't find a sample or decant anywhere and ended up returning it. If the original is too heavy for you for summer, or if you're looking for a more masc take, this might be worth checking out.
* **Love, Don't Be Shy - 1.5/5** \- Mostly has notes I enjoy so I don't know what happened here. I get the draw of the floral/fruity marshmallow vibe but there's something unpleasant about the way it's mixed with spice and citrus. It mellows out after an hour or so, turning into straight up bubblegum, and at that point I scrubbed it. (The way the whole adds up to more than the sum of its parts would be impressive if that sum weren't 100% bubblegum.) Gorgeous for someone else but definitely not for me.
* **Love, Don't Be Shy Eau Fraiche - 3.5/5** \- I like the opening of this better than the original - orange blossom and petitgrain are amazing, and the floral middle notes are beautifully blended. The drydown is much softer and less bubblegum. I'm not the biggest fan of labdanum but it's not overwhelming - the white musk/vanilla/marshmallow is a fantastic combo. Makes me want to try the other flankers!
* **Good Girl Gone Bad - 3.5/5** \- Enjoyed this!! The floral/fruit/wood combo is SO GOOD, especially the peach, mandarin, and bergamot. I'm apparently a tuberose girl. I also adore the osmanthus and May rose (and that the rose isn't overwhelming).

# The Liquors

* **Angels' Share - 4.5/5** \- Love this so much. It's boozy apples, cinnamon, smoke, and wood, although the cinnamon apple vibe takes over everything else in the drydown. I'm shocked there's not an actual apple note in it.
* **Angels' Share Paradis - 4/5** \- A fun fact about me is I'm six years sober. I was more into drugs than alcohol but needed to quit everything. I still LOVE boozy scents though, so I'm looking for perfumes that can weave those notes in tastefully without making me smell like I've relapsed. This toes that line a little too close for me because there's the cognac of the original but with an additional liquor top note that comes across strongly. I ADORE the raspberry/rose/caramel, though. The drydown is similar to the original.
* **Angels' Share on the Rocks - 5/5** \- This is it, THIS is the one. The bergamot/grapefruit/cognac combo is the perfect blend of citrus and booze. It's not spicy/cinnamon-y at all. The myrrh and tonka add some amazing, long-lasting incense/earthy notes. I'm so in love with this and bought a travel size.
* **Apple Brandy on the Rocks - 5/5** \- LOVEEEE. The bergamot, apple, pineapple is such an iconic combo, especially when mixed with the rum/brandy and cardamom. Such a fresh, juicy scent with just enough booze to make things interesting.
* **Old Fashioned - 2.5/5** \- 'Dead dove, do not eat,' EXACTLY what it says on the tin. This is a photorealistic old fashioned. There's a slight citrus scent in the opening that fades quickly on skin and then it's a total booze bomb. It's nice but I wouldn't wear it. I think it might be good layered with something more fruity. Definitely leans masc.
* **Roses on Ice - 4.5/5** \- This is supposed to be 'gin on the rocks with a splash of lime' and I get maybe a splash of gin, but mostly a beautiful aquatic green/fresh fragrance. The cucumber, rose, lime, and ozonic notes are EXQUISITE. Beautifully blended and a perfect spring/summer pick. I've never smelled another perfume that does cucumber this well, especially with this kind of longevity.

# Dupes

* **Princess**
   * **Julianna's Perfumes Miss Independent - 5/5** \- 90% close to the original, but I like the changes even better. It's a little greener - it has lemon, peach, hedione, jasmine, and apple notes, but they're very subtle and well-blended, to the point that it smells like the original with just a touch of citrus and oomph to the green tea/matcha/ginger. The marshmallow and vanilla are gorgeous early on and gain center stage in the drydown, along with a touch of musk. It's an extrait with phenomenal longevity and sillage. This is my go-to now.
   * **Brown Sugar Babe Princess Treatment Body Oil - 2/5** \- Love the ginger/tea notes. Something (maybe the marshmallow note or carrier oil) smells strongly of baby powder which ruins the effect. I layer with Julianna's because the strength of that one + vanilla lotion can overcome the baby powder, but I would not layer with the OG or rebuy. However, it has high reviews (and I've had good luck with other BSB oils like Sweet Smoke) so your mileage may vary.
   * **Dua Princeless Princess - 1/5** \- Smells like a cousin, not an actual dupe. There's an overpowering almond cookie scent in the opening and the rest is a cacophony. It chills out to something more reminiscent of the original but on the green and muddled end :\\ May give it another shot down the line as I've heard it's better after it sits, I've only had it a few weeks.
   * Plan to try Andromeda's Moon's version.
* **Good Girl Gone Bad**
   * **Yom & Layl Gossip Girl - 3.5/5** \- Side by side, I can't tell a single difference from the OG. I'm new to Y&L but between this and their take on Le Labo Thé Matcha 26, I'm a fan.
* **Angels' Share**
   * **B&BW Inner Angel - 4/5** \- I have the body mist and cream and LOVE them. I feel like they're 80-90% close to the original but very one-note, no evolution. Good for layering for longevity/projection, but the complexity of the OG will be lost. However if you want to smell like Angels' Share without the price tag (or without using yours as frequently) this is such a good option.
   * **Julianna's Perfumes Kissed by an Angel - 4/5** \- Also an 80-90% match.  The opening is muted, creamier, and less boozy. The drydown is nearly identical to the OG - very apple/cinnamon - with a touch more caramel/vanilla.
   * **Fragrance World Cocktail Intense - 3.75/5** \- Very boozy, a touch more than the OG - it nails that light, fruity cognac opening that Julianna's lacks. However it holds that scent all the way through and there's not much evolution in the drydown.
   * **Lattafa Khamrah/Khamrah Qahwa - 3/5 -** These are amazing gourmands in their own right, but they are not dupes of Angels' Share, more like distant cousins. I'm enjoying working my way through the samples (Qahwa even more so, love the coffee and floral notes), not sure if I'd buy.
   * Plan to try Alexandria's Fragrances' version.
* **Angels' Share Paradis**
   * **Lattafa Fire on Ice - 3.75/5** \- I'd put it at a 80%ish match to the OG but if I wasn't doing a side by side I probably wouldn't notice the differences. The moss is promoted to a middle note and it comes through quickly, making it earthier than the OG. The raspberry and rose are heavy-hitters and not as delicately blended. If you like those notes, you'll probably enjoy this. Great longevity/projection and the drydown is virtually identical.
   * Plan to try Julianna's versions.
* **Apple Brandy on the Rocks**
   * **Julianna's Miss Independent with Rum-Drizzled Apples - 5/5** \- Billed as a blend of Princess and Apple Brandy on the Rocks and it does NOT disappoint. I haven't tried their inspiration of Apple Brandy on the Rocks yet (Apple Rum Delight), but side by side the opening of this is a 95% match to the OG, only brighter and stronger. This mellows into something still very citrus/apple/rum but soft and creamy with the marshmallow of Princess. Loved and will definitely buy.",11,1758429371.0,FemFragLab,6,1.0,False
1nmirnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1nmirnn/how_to_mitigate_damage_of_fight_between_wife_and/,How to mitigate damage of fight between wife and my mom.,"I [35M], got married to my wife[36F] about 3 years ago. We are renting in a house along with my 3 siblings.

The house has 3 rooms. Me and my wife took 1 room, and my 3 siblings shared the other. 

The 3rd room is smaller than the 2 others and we normally used as a stock room where we put extra supplies like shampoo, detergent, bleach bottles, extra suitcase, my hardware tools, etc.... But we occasionally have visiting family members use it either to crash on or keep their personal things secure.

There is issue with that room however. It would leak/take in water during heavy rain. Leak is small and would run along the wall. Multiple attempts to working eith landlord to apply some sort of water proof agent on it did not solve issue. Perhaps we did not place it on the right spot.

In any case, my mom[58F] stayed with us for a while to plan my child's bday. So we have her use the 3rd room for her things, but she slept in the living room.

The period she stayed with us is the rainy season when it rained constantly for a week. So with no surprise, that room looked and my mom placed a couple of rags to soak in the water. This occured during the first few days of her stay. My mom stayed with us for 2 weeks.

A week after my mom left, my wife went to get something in the 3rd room and noticed a large puddle of water on the floor. It has not rained for at least a week and the puddle on the floor now has some mosquito larvae swimming in it. She cleaned it up grumbling why my mom did not do anything about it when she was there.

My wife has a tendency of taking action immediately if there are things that needs cleaning. She understood that during the week where it rained constantly, thebpuddle is not cleaned. But it should have been taken care of when it stopped raining. And she has a sort of philosophy, that if you were the one who normally go or use something, it should be your responsibility to care for it. And for her, my mom should have taken care of it, or told any one of us in the house about the puddle when she left.

After a few weeks, my mom came back to stay with us again. My wife is already holding a grudge about that puddle and mentions that her blood still boils thinking about it. 

Yesterday, my wife is cleaning some stuff in the washing area and noticed a dustpan and plastic broom is dirty. She needs to do additional tasks and have informed my mom to have any of my siblings take care of the broom.

Come today, the wife is cooking and my mom is in the kitchen table drinking coffee. I came down carrying our child[1M]. The conversation went to the dirty broom which is still not cleaned. And my wife left some scathing remarks about my siblings being lazy. My mom made some statement that my siblings will be going out today which implied the broom and dustpan will remain dirty. 

Wife made scathing remarks again and my mom stood up and voices were raised. Their short shouting match has something to do with why we took in my siblings in the same house if she thinks they are lazy.

My mom stood up near my wife and is kind of like pointing her finger aggressively at my wife. Although very near to my wife, i dont think the finger touched her. But it all happened so fast and im not sure if it touched her. Suffice to say, the action is aggressive.

My wife swatted the finger away and im also uncertain if its the finger that got hit or my mom's body. Or both.

I just stood there holding our child stunned.

My mom left the house in anger afterwards and texted me to never take my wife to our hometown.

I admit I should have done something before this happened since I knew my wife is angry with my mom about the puddle.

I wanted to share something that’s been a big part of my routine recently. Over the past year, I’ve had on-and-off issues with digestion — bloating, irregular energy, and just that heavy feeling after meals. I’ve tried different things like adjusting my diet, drinking more water, and even cutting down on coffee (which was *hard* 😅). Some of it helped, but I still felt like my gut needed more support.

A friend mentioned **Finessa**, which is supposed to focus on digestive balance and gut health. I was skeptical at first (because let’s be real, there are *so many* supplements out there that overpromise), but I decided to give it a shot.

Here’s what I noticed after a few weeks:

* **Less bloating:** Meals don’t leave me feeling as heavy or sluggish.
* **More regular digestion:** Without getting into TMI territory, things feel more “on track.”
* **Energy levels:** I feel lighter and less drained throughout the day.

I’m not saying it’s a magic pill — I’ve also been paying more attention to eating balanced meals and staying hydrated — but adding this into my routine made a difference for me.

That said, I know everyone’s body responds differently, which is why I’m curious: **Has anyone else here tried Finessa or other gut-support supplements?** Did you notice real changes, or was it more placebo for you?

I think these discussions are helpful because digestive health is so often overlooked until it becomes a real problem.

I have Bipolar 2 disorder and unfortunately I have fallen into a pretty intense depressive episode. I've gotten myself back into a safe place, and I sort of feel like I am on the mend, but there are some lingering effects. Namely, a complete loss of appetite. I go throughout my day not eating until maybe 7pm, although sometimes it extends until 10-11pm. It's not intentional, at least I don't think it is. But all food just seems repulsive and impossible for me to crave. I tried drinking my calories through protein shakes, but I can hardly stomach those. Right now coffee and water seem to be the only options for me until I finally get hungry enough for a small meal at the end of the day.

I don't know what to do. I know the answer is to just try to eat, but it's not that simple. Even eating a little bit of food makes me feel nauseous for hours. I'm getting nervous that I am going down a destructive path depriving myself of food like this, but I don't know how to stop. I am currently not in a place where I can afford therapy, so I don't have anyone who I can really talk to about this, which is why I am coming here.

**Editor's note:** There are a few background posts that help paint a better picture of OOP's life, so I have included them as well. I replaced letters with names.

**Background** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ep62gl/aita_for_calling_my_mil_a_liar/) **1: August 10, 2024**

**Title:** AITA for calling my MIL a liar?

Background : My sister (33f) and I (30f) are not close. We always catch up on birthdays, weddings and similar family events but we are not friends. This is partially because we are very different and partially because she doesn't approve of my marriage (my husband is 12 years older than me and we started dating when I was 18). My husband and his family don't like my sister because she is openly feminist and doesn't care about gender norms in marriage.

Now, the problem : We hosted a birthday party for my son a few days ago, I had a headache so I was upstairs when I heard my MIL and husband arguing inside. He stormed in our room, said that MIL says that my sister called my SIL a whore, said that she is ugly and fat and then left. I said that my sister haven't said that, because she would never called another woman those type of derogatory words and husband said that MIL was there and heard everything and I wasn't, to which I said that than MIL is lying and that would be out of character for my sister to say something like that. He called me an a-hole and says that I don't even like my sister and that I get along better with MIL anyway, so how I can call her a liar?

He has been on the phone with MIL and SIL whole day and I have been made to be this huge jerk.

Reason why I said that is that those type of words sound like something that my SIL and MIL would use, not my sister.

Later, I talked with sister and she says that she was helping put together a swing in backyard when SIL said that she is again in men business and that she should be helping with food, to which my sister told her to f off already, took her keys and left with her husband.

But, I didn't know that when I said that my MIl lied, so am I TA?

***OOP's Comment:***

Top Commenter: INFO: So, just to be clear - it seems like you’re saying that your MIL did lie, from the sound of things? Your sister swore at SIL, but didn’t drop the gendered insults that your SIL and MIL claimed she said?

>**OOP:** Hi. My MIL is now downplaying everything, says that maybe she didn't understand everything since she wasn't that close and my SIL cried when my sister left, so she wasn't that coherent. My theory is that MIL didn't actually heard anything and that she believed what SIL have told, but I dont know that for sure.

*Because of the top comment, the post is voted as ""needs more info""*

**Background** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1f7yxtm/i_am_envious_of_my_sister/) **2: September 3, 2024 (a bit less than 1 month later)**

**Title:** I am envious of my sister

This is going to be long, I apologise. So, I (30f) have a sister, lets call her Madison (33f). We grow up very poor in a unstable family (father left when I was a baby, mother whas abusive) but we had each other and we were both very supportive of each other. We somehow managed to grow up in very different people. I always wanted a husband, a lot of kids, white picket fence, whole thing and she was more if it happens - happens type.

I got married young (18) and now have to kids with my husband, Madison got pregnant with then boyfriend, who abandoned her while she was pregnant. She kept the pregnancy and father is not in the picture nor is he on the birth certificate. I know she went through hell, raising kid on her own, in between daycare, jobs, keeping house clean, cooking etc... When her son was 6, she met a great guy and after dating for a year, she got married. That was almost two years ago.

Now, Madison is openly a feminist and so is her husband. They both work, both take care of the house, they go clubbing, both together and separately, same with vacations. Her husband is raising her son as his own and even wanted to adopt him legally (which my sister refused).

My husband is more traditional.

I catch myself being resentful of my sister. If she is tired, her husband will make her a coffee and clean their house. Mine says thats my job and wont lift a finger even when I'm sick. When she is sick, she gets homemade soup in bed, medicine, he dots on her and is very loving. When they are both in a mood, they order food, make pilow fortress and watch movies with her son. I am expected to make all meals, no matter how was my day or how I feel. He takes her son to soccer practise, goes to his games, takes him to movies, ice cream, you name it (so does she, this depends on work schedule). I have to beg my husband to occasionally show up in school, for his own children.

My husband makes comment how my sister takes better care of herself than I do (sometimes he criticise her for that, too), which she does. She goes to the gym, runs in the morning, always has nails and regularly goes to get her hair done. I cant do any of that. Who is going to take care of kids? House? She can do it cause her husband helps her.

When Madison had altercation with my SIL, her husband was immediately on her side. He doesn't care was she right or wrong. My husband would probably told me to stop being a child and apologise.

I know my sister doesn't deserve this, but I am starting to hate her. She was nothing but supportive (except for my marriage, she doesn't like my husband, but even there, she is still civil with him and his family because of me) and I just want to cry when I see how different are lives are.

I hate that I'm like this. I hate how I feel. I feel like I'm the worst person in the world.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: This is a husband problem. What you could do is tell him in the morning that you will be at the gym when he gets home from work, since he wants you to take better care of yourself. He is a grown man, he can pop something in the microwave. This does of course require someone to watch the kids. Would your sister be able to do that occasionally?

>**OOP:** Ii is a husband problem, I know. Even if I try and find childcare, then he would be angry that I'm not with the kids.

Commenter: why are u hating ur sister instead of hating ur husband?

>**OOP:** I dont know. I feel if I start to disect my marriage, then a divorce is on the way and that scares me.

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1htnwiy/aita_for_telling_my_husband_that_i_dont_want_to/)**: January 4, 2025 (4 months later, just under 5 from first post)**

So, my husband (42m) and me (31f) have been married for 12 years. We have two kids (8m and 4f).

Our marriage is not great. His mother and sister often give unsolicited advice on my parenting, our marriage and life in general. It is better in last few months, since I sit down my husband (multiple times), we talked and this time he listened, so they backed of. Not completely but it is better.

In last few weeks, husband started mentioning having a third child, which feels me with dread. I love children, always wanted a big family, but it would be too much. I cook, clean, take care of kids and work part time from home.

He doesn't really helps with house (which I am fine with) nor with kids (which is a problem). I changed all diapers, woke up at night, I take care of fevers, doctor appointments, school, playdates, everything. Mere thought of now going through another pregnancy, than taking care of a baby makes me want to cry. I know I would have to do it all practically alone, because my husband ""provides and women have been doing it for centuries, i should pull my weight and not be spoiled"".

It all culminated last night. After another of his ""I take great care of you and kids and we should have a third"" monologues I snapped. I told him that he really doesn't. That kids barely know him, when he comes home from work, he doesn't pay attention to them, except to snap on our daughter when she is too loud. He doesn't know anything about our days because he doesn't ask, and I stopped telling him, because he wasn't listening anyway. He is not great father nor husband as he likes to preaches, and I have no desire to be a single mom of a third child, two are quite enough, thank you.

He starred at me dumbfounded, that called me a c word, delusional and ungrateful then stormed out to his mother house.

So, AITA?

**Mini Update in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1htnvs4/comment/m5g3zmg/)**: 5 hours later**

Hi to everyone. I don't know how to update, so I'm doing it in the comments.

For clarification - We dated for 9 months and married when I was 18. I turned 31 few days ago and can't imagine being attracted to 18 year old, let alone marrying one, but I didn't think like that back then.

Whatever happens with my marriage, I AM NOT HAVING ANOTHER CHILD, I won't change my mind when it comes to that. I am on birth control, but I also have no desire to have sex with my husband after how he reacted and treated me.

I don't have parents and I really don't want to go to friends with this.

I called my sister (Madison) and told her everything . A lot of things that you guys said in the comments, she has been saying for years. She showed up with food, wine and her husband. BIL took my kids to their house for a sleepover and Madison stayed with me.

My husband is still with his parents, didn't call or text. My MIL called, but I didn't pick up, I'm to angry and sad to have a conversation with her.

Thank you everyone for commenting and giving me advice, it really means a lot.

I will update when I talk with my husband and when I know how to proceed (and when I figure out how to update 😅)

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1hvx9ri/update_to_aita_for_telling_my_husband_that_i_dont/)**: January 7, 2025 (3 days later, 5 months from first post)**

Hello to everyone. I wanted to update since a lot of people were worried about me and a lot has happened.

For ones who don't want to read a long post -Things turned ugly but I am safe and I decided to get a divorce since husband and I couldn't agree in how a marriage should look like.

Now for a long update - Morning after I made this post, my MIL and SIL showed up at my house (at this point there was still no word from my husband (lets call him Ray)). It was obvious that they expected me to be alone (my kids were with BIL at my sister (Madison's) house, she was with me). So we all sat down to have a conversation. I know I was being annoying but I kept repeating that I dont see a point of that, conversation should happen between Ray and me, we are grown ups and married, i didn't see a reason for them to meddle. They took great offense to that. My MIL at one point said that she doesn't understand what happened to me, I am not the girl her son married anymore. I said of course Im not, he married a teenager and Im now a grown woman. She turned beat red and started screaming at me, to which Madison said she is going to call police if she doesn't calm down. After a few insults (mostly how Im abusing her son and how bad of a mother I am) they left.

Ray showed up a few hours latter. Not to ask about our children or to see how I am but to berate me on how I treated his mother. Again, I think Madison being there changed his plan, since he tone it down when she came downstairs. He demanded for her to leave, she refused and said that she is going to go upstairs so we can have a conversation but she is not going anywhere until I ask her to, which I didn't.

He started with basically saying that I am bad wife, that I don't love him since I dont want more kids and I blamed him for it, I shouldn't be speaking with him like that, he is a great father to our kids etc... I asked which kids? Kids he hasn't seen in 3 days and didn't ask how or where are they? He then freaked out when I told him they are at BIl and Madison's house, calling them both vile names that I don't want to repeat.

Our conversation lasted an hour and nothing productive came out of it, we were going in circles. I was scared because he multiple times started grinding his teeth and putting his hands in fists but he would calm down after few seconds.

I said if he is not willing to work on our marriage and thinks that he is completely in the right, we should get a divorce. He, at first said fine, if that's what I what, I should pack my stuff and leave. I started packing, he ranted how Im going to live without him, how he cant wait for me to explain to kids why they are moving and similar. I said that kids are not moving anywhere. They are staying in the house, and which parent stays here is taking care of them. He really couldn't comprehend what Im saying. I am not turning our kids lives upside down, divorce is enough of a change - they are not going anywhere.

Then his tune changed - he was willing ""to hear me out"", I swear i thought Im going to pop a blood vessel from rage. I said I don't care anymore - we ARE getting a divorce, only questions are about logistics and our kids.

To not makes this post even longer - this also went in circles, then he grabed my shoulders and started shaking me, Madison got involved, they started pushing each other, I called the police. We managed to puch him through the door and locked it. He left before police came, we gave statements and I stayed at the house. I am fine but Madison has a few scratches. Currently Im bombarded with text from his family, again not a peep from him.

I am filling for divorce. I don't know why I thought that this can end any differently, but Im also glad that I tried.

For people who found mine previous posts - I am ashamed of how I was speaking about Madison - but I was envious until I realised that I was projecting my unhappiness with my life onto her. She didn't deserved it - she was and still is amazing sister and even better person.

Thank you all, I got amazing advice and words of encouragement, Internet can also be full of wonderful people and Im grateful for each and every one of you.

# New Updates

**\*\*\*\*\*Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/Icy_Memory1247/comments/1l3ctff/update2_to_aita_for_telling_my_husband_that_i/) **2: June 4, 2025 (6 months later, 10 months from Background post)\*\*\*\*\***

Hi everyone. It's been a while since I posted and probably not a lot of people remember my post, but people were messaging me to see if I was ok, so I wanted to update.

I am officially divorced as of this morning. We signed the papers few days ago, but today I got divorce sertificate.

So much has happened, I don't think people would believe me if I tried to type it all, so I'm going to do just most important stuff.

In the weeks after I made my post, my ex Ray decided that he wants to work on our marriage, that he will try to be a better husband and win me back. That mostly consisted of him harassing me, calling me constantly from multiple numbers, sending me flowers, chocolates and candy (I don't even eat sweets!!!!) and showing up randomly at places where I regularly go.

We leave in a small town (around 15k people) so it became towns gossip. It felt like everyone was talking about me.

My ex MIL tried really hard to paint me as some mentally unstable, nasty person who just one day decided to destroy a family. She attacked me at a childs birthday party when I was dropping off my son ( SILs child birthday). Then she tried to say bad things about me to my kids (luckily Ray put a stop to that). She did everything and anything to make me feel like shit, whilst saying that she would like nothing more that for Ray and me to be back together. I didn't want to keep her from my kids so I let them spend time with her, FIL, SIL and her kids. She took my kids to the park, that she knows I think is unsafe (it is unsafe, old and rusty). She also took them to buy them shoes. I know this is a weird thing to be angry and hurt about, but I have some childhood trauma and I NEED to know that they shoes fit right and are not too small. It's not a big thing overall, but she did it intentionally to hurt me.

I lost it when I came to pick them up and was told they bought new shoes. Everyone was there (MIL, FIL, SIL, BIL, Ray) so I just screamed at everyone. I called MIL names that I didn't even know I knew,, told Ray that he is spineless, worthless excuse for a man, called FIL a houseplant (it makes more sense in my language, basically I called him useless) and told SIL that she is very brave when she gossips but is a doormat to her husband and mother. Luckily, kids were outside so they know we were fighting but didn't hear what was said. Nobody said anything to me, they were shocked. I had to call my sister on my way home cause I didn't think I could drive, so I parked and waited. She picked me up, we put kids to bed and I just cried.

I think I cried for 5 hours straight. I hated who I become, I was sad or angry all the time, everyone annoyed me, it was just awful.

It did get better. Next time Ray cornered me in a grocery store, I threatened to call the police. And when he kept calling, I actually did. Police told me that they will give him a warning. They told him that next time he tries to speak to me and is not directly about children, he will spend the night in jail and he would get harassment charges. Police officer also gave me his personal number if I want clarification on what can be reported (again, small place, we went to the same school).

I joined a group that my sister started, where we do things in a community (like we would get together and pick trash from parks, paint fences or benches, get older people to appointments or get them groceries, things like that). I started cleaning a house of a older lady with cancer who lives alone. She insisted to start paying me and combined with my part time job and rent (me and my sister inherited a house from our mother that we rent out and split the money) now I have a decent income.

After many, many awful, exhausting weeks, Ray agreed to divorce me. I agreed to not get alimony if I get to stay in the house with kids, only child support.

I don't want my kids to suffer but it did make me sad that they didn't seem to miss they father. School therapist talked with them and they are fine, they accept the divorce (as much as they understand, due to their age). We had a lot of conversations about what this means for them, me and Ray. They are good, well adjusted children. Buy it made me feel stupid and incompetent. What I was doing all this years? Doing everything for a man that was such a bad parent that his kids don't even miss him? How dumb am I?

I started going outside more, spend more time with people and it's great. Turns out that no matter how much MIL tried, it's hard to convince people that I am a bad person, since a lot of them know me since I was a child and they also know my ex husbands family. So there's that.

Thank you all. I was very confused and very scared when I posted but I'm so, so glad that I did. A lot of you helped me and make me see things clearly and I am forever going to be grateful.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: I’m so glad for this update. You said the children have seen a therapist—awesome. Can you get therapy for yourself as well, if you haven’t? You got married at 18 to a much older man, and from how you talk about yourself at the end of your post, you need support to also heal from this. Please do it for your children. For what’s it’s worth, this internet stranger is so proud of you and your strength.

>**OOP:** Hi, thank you so much. I did thought about starting therapy (mostly because of the shoes thing) but life happens and I delayed it many times. I will try in the near future.

Commenter: From what you have posted about your inlaws I doubt that you've seen the last of them

>**OOP:**  left out a lot in this update, didn't want for it to be a novel, but I know for a fact they would not live me alone any time soon. If they harass me, I will report it, that is the only thing I can do.

Commenter: Are you perhaps French OP ? I ask that because as a French myself your comment about your FIL would make sense. Anyway, I'm so glad to have seen your update. From now on, make a request to only communicate with your ex husband using an app that records conversations and provided by the court. Tell him that only discussions regarding the children will be allowed.

>**OOP:** Hi! Not French but I am European. Glad that it works in multiple languages 😁

**Side** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1mmmio8/am_i_overreacting_to_seeing_my_exmil_in_my_dress/)**: August 10, 2025 (2 months later, 1 year from first post)**

**Title:** Am I overreacting to seeing my exMIL in my dress?

Little backstory - I married young and was married for 12 years. My exMIL was always very critical of me, nothing I did was right. My ex and I separated 7 months ago, officially divorced 2 months ago and we have two kids. She was a menace the whole time.

She never had anything nice to say about my body, first I was too skinny, then too fat when I was pregnant, then she acused me of having ED, because I lost the weight while breastfeeding. Then repeat all that for second child.

She also didn't like my wardrobe, luckily, that was one of the rare things my ex stopped her from criticising and she can take my dresses from my cold, dead hands.

Yesterday I saw her (we live in a small town, we randomly see each other often) IN MY FUCKING DRESS. Yes, some of my things stayed in her house, in a closet in my exes room, from when we used to visit. I didn't asked for them back, but I didn't expect her to wear it???

I know I sound petty, but this woman called ME immature for wearing this things, while I was in my late twenties. She is in her sixties. She NEVER dressed like that before. It's creepy and disturbing.

I am so angry. Yes, it is just a dress, yes, I didn't even asked for my stuff back, no, I don't need it. I don't know how to describe what I feel.

I send my ex text that basically said ""What an actual fuck, did your mother lost her mind"". My sister says that it is creepy but my friend says that it's a dress, I shouldn't care, and that maybe she did it on purpose, so I'm giving her what she wants. (I don't see how it could be on purpose, she didn't know that I'm going to see her).

Just wanted to drop a lil' note of encouragement amidst this whirlwind we call life. You know, those tiny, everyday things we sometimes overlook can actually be the magic we need. Like the way sunlight sneaks through tree branches, casting those beautiful patters on the ground... or the smell of coffee brewing in the morning, giving you that first cozy hello. 

I think it's kinda wild how thwse smlal things can carrry a sene of wonder, reminding us to breathe and stay present. So, whenever you’re feelling down or like life’s just getting too much, remember that in between the chaos, there's beauty waiting to lift you up. You’re never alone in feeling overwheled, and it's okay to pause and soak in those quiet wonders around you. 

Keep seeing the little thinngs, and may they bring you peace when you need it most. Take care ❤️.",8,1758428499.0,LettersToStrangers,2,0.91,False

Dose 15g of coffee

Using the bottomless basket 

I have done a range of ratio from 1:2-1:4

I've ground so fine that I jammed the brew, and so coarse that it was a hurricane

Most of the coffees have been a light roast-light/medium roast

Puck prep consists of wetting the coffee before grinding, grinding, in the portafilter, distribute, wdt tool it, and then tap till no longer squishy

If anyone has the same grinder and espresso maker (don't think i can call it a machine) with any tips that would be amazing! If not I will still take all the help I can",2,1758428467.0,espresso,4,1.0,False
