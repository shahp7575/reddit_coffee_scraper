Anyone want to pretend to enjoy the cold, rainy morning with me?","I kind of like gloomy mornings like this, especially when I don‚Äôt have to go anywhere. I‚Äôve been stuck in my own head with job hunting and everything that‚Äôs going on in the world right now, and I feel like I‚Äôm too burned out to enjoy the holiday season. The rain is comforting to me. It‚Äôs like the weather is giving me permission to step back and rest.

Anyway. What can I get you for breakfast? I‚Äôve got eggs, bacon, and muffins, and I could probably whip up some pancakes for us if you want. As for beverages, I just got some of the good coffee‚Äîyou know, the *good* stuff, that‚Äôs not too sweet and not too bitter. Feels like today‚Äôs a day for the good stuff. I also have a few different teas, if that‚Äôs more your thing, as well as juices. There‚Äôs a table by the window, so we can eat and watch the rain together.

Lexi would also acknowledge Derek for owning up to his mistakes at service. Josiah believed that maybe the blue team could finally ease up and finish some services. On the patio, Priya and Garrett were talking about how well the charity service was last night, and the fact that both Hayley and Marcus did so well, almost too well. Priya then mentioned to Garrett that the other two red team members might be too strong to beat in the end. And coincidentally in the other room, Marcus and Hayley were connecting over the fact that culinary was a last ditch effort for a job at the time. Hayley said that she never thought that Marcus would be that guy to be close with, as she thought that one of the ‚ÄúOG‚Äù red team members would be otherwise. Marcus said to himself that he‚Äôs happy at where he is and doesn‚Äôt regret his last minute decision to be a chef, and the fact that he and Hayley get to connect on that was really positive.

The next morning, Lexi was the first to get up. But when she went to get coffee, she was greeted with Sous Chefs Christina and Jon at a dinner table that wasn‚Äôt in the dorms the night before. They told her to wake up the others and get dressed. Everyone was shocked and confused at the sudden appearance. Garrett saying that it is early in the morning, they had just woken up, and Ramsay already has plans today? It makes him wonder what might be in store. After getting ready and sitting down, the Sous Chefs discussed the proud and strong talent that were among the seven remaining chefs, despite the lack of experience from each of them. It was a wholesome moment which felt like a cross team relationship that made the chefs understand why they were each so passionate about culinary. While the contestants were asking the sous chefs about their time on Hell‚Äôs Kitchen, Josiah happened to notice that each of them were eating the exact same dish, down to the last detail. A red fish with a multi-colored hash, and a yellow puree. This prompted him to wonder what was up and began looking through the dish, just in case a certain challenge comes up. Others notice this but don‚Äôt comment or bother.

After finishing the talk and the meal, the chefs were left in the dorms and prepared for the challenge later that day. Once the chefs later entered the dining room where Ramsay and the sous chefs were, they were met with a single domed platter. Garrett was nervous because this season brought in a bunch of surprising challenge entrances. From big tables, to flair bartenders, to an entire fire department raiding the building. So seeing the only thing sticking out in the room being a single platter, worries her. Ramsay asked if they enjoyed their special meal with the sous chefs, with positive responses from each of them. Ramsay then told them that they better have paid attention to what they were eating, before opening the platter to reveal one more plate with the same fish dish from earlier. Ramsay revealed the challenge to be the infamous Taste It Now Make It challenge. Many chefs were shocked and were in dread from encountering the challenge. Derek said that this challenge needed exact precision and perfection with the dish, he‚Äôs just glad that he was able to do good in the Blind Taste test the other day or he would be screwed. All the chefs felt nervous except Josiah, who said that he knew this was coming and knew what his plan was. Ramsay wanted them to taste the protein, the hash, and the puree one more time before cooking. Each chef had 40 minutes to recreate the dish, and the chef who was the closest to the original would win for their team.¬†

As each chef went to the kitchen, Garrett admitted that this was the one of the times he was most nervous in the competition as he felt that the pur√©es was some velvety green vegetable, but couldn‚Äôt tell what it was. Derek, Hayley, and Priya used artichoke for the pur√©e, while Garrett and Marcus used kale, Lexi used brussel sprouts, and Josiah used avocado. For the hash, Hayley (along with everyone else) knew potatoes here in it, but was stumped by the sweet orange chunks and the red root flavoring chunks. Everyone was using red bell peppers, but Priya, Josiah, and Garrett used mango, while Lexi, Derek, Marcus, and Hayley used pineapple. With only 10 minutes left, the chefs began cooking the fish protein, as Marcus was sure it was wahoo based on the level of salty flavor in the fish, while Lexi thought it was tuna due to the consistency of the fish. Garrett used tuna as well, while Derek, Hayley, and Josiah cooked wahoo. However, Priya was deciding between the two and started to get nervous. With time running out, Priya decided to go with wahoo. Eventually, the chefs had their dishes cooked and plated on time.

Once everything was plated, Ramsay asked if he could each taste and inspect each dish Lexi presented her dish but got really nervous as she looked at Derek and Josiah‚Äôs dishes and saw wahoo and not tuna. Marcus was excited to have Ramsay taste his¬† dish, as this was a first this season where one person could win it all for everyone on their team, however when he saw that his team was split 2-2 on everything except the red hash, he thought they were fucked.¬†

After tasting the dishes, Ramsay said it was a nice plethora of dishes that each made sense in their own way. But only 1 out of the seven chefs got it nailed. Ramsay started with the hash, and said that everyone got it that it had red bell peppers in it, but the orange hash was revealed to be mango. Meaning that Derek, Hayley, Lexi, Marcus were out. Next was the actual protein itself, as Ramsay revealed it to be a wahoo fillet, eliminating Garrett from the challenge. It all came down to Priya, who did artichoke, and Josiah, who did avocado, for the puree. Both purees were so close to the original demo dish, but Ramsay declared a very happy Josiah as the winner for identifying the puree as avocado. Him and the blue team were ecstatic as they didn‚Äôt have to have their third punishment in a row.

||Result|
|:-|:-|
|**Derek**|2/4|
|**Garrett**|2/4|
|**Hayley**|2/4|
|**Josiah**|4/4|
|**Lexi**|1/4|
|**Marcus**|2/4|
|**Priya**|3/4|

The blue team got to ride on a helicopter to see over New York City, Lexi said it was awesome and was happy that her team pulled through, especially for Josiah. Derek said he's happy his team gets to have a day out of Hell's Kitchen, but more happy that this might be the time for the blue team to finally advance as the powerhouses now. The red team had to clean and prep more fish for tonight's service, with Priya saying she was bummed of not going on the reward. Marcus had said that he gained newfound respect for all fishmongers all over the nation because trying to fillet different fish, making precision cuts, and working with the awful smells, was something he could never do. He compared fishermen to surgical doctors because of it. Garrett had a talk with his team and wanted to say thank you for believing in him for so long, especially since he had a lot of bumps in his road. Hayley comforted him and said not to worry about it, as long as they stay composed throughout services from now on.

As the chefs returned from their reward/punishment and prepped for service, Ramsay lined them up at the pass. Ramsay told the remaining seven chefs that he did consider each of them to be amazing chefs in their own way. Frontrunner kept their head high and others bounced back and rose to the top. Ramsay was equally proud of each and every chef remaining, but with the endgame in sight, every single detail is going to matter. Derek said that some mistakes aren‚Äôt going to cut it from here on out. Ramsay then told Marino to open Hell‚Äôs Kitchen.

|Stations|Red Team|Blue Team|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Appetizers**|Hayley|Josiah|
|**Meat**|Garrett|Derek|
|**Fish**|Priya|Lexi|
|**Garnish**|Marcus|Josiah|

As dinner service began the blue team were the first to receive their appetizers, Josiah said he's working two stations and he needs to step up and show himself to be the best in the blue team. His risottos were perfectly cooked as it went with Lexi‚Äôs scallops and Derek‚Äôs tartare, which made the blue team push out appetizers and a nice pace.¬†

In the red kitchen, Hayley‚Äôs carbonara was on point and was ready to serve, however Priya‚Äôs scallops were under, which was told to get back in the pan. Thankfully, on the second attempt, the scallops were sent out and appetizers went at a smooth pace. Both kitchens got through appetizers without that many problems and seemed to be doing well as entrees started. Ramsay called a good job so far and urged to keep this at a steady pace. Priya seemed satisfied and hoped that the light stays green for the rest of the service.

The red team started with their entrees. Garrett said he was on meat and said that if there‚Äôs any time to step up and show that he deserves to stay any longer. Priya's salmon and cod were cooked perfectly, but Garrett had to hold back the filet mignon because he said it was still under, making Ramsay impatient. Two minutes later, Garrett brought up the mignon‚Ä¶ but was overcooked. Prompting Ramsay to do it again. Marcus was shown saying now was not the time to fuck up and Garrett needs to fix this. After the next attempt was accepted, Ramsay then turned his attention to the blue kitchen.

Lexi said that she‚Äôs happy working at a station alone, especially on meat, because of the confidence that she is one of the better ones that were ever on this blue team. The chefs could also tell that Derek was finally in the groove of things. The blue team got off to a strong start with Josiah leading the kitchen from the garnish and was able to fire both meat and fish. However, Lexi sent up overcooked bass, with Ramsay describing it like being buried for years. Luckily she got it on the second attempt.

Back in the red kitchen, Garrett got consistent and finally got his act together, but started to fall once Priya sent up one extra fish than needed. Ramsay prompted Marino to playfully catch it as they didn‚Äôt need it, which Marino went along with. Marcus was embarrassed that his teammate had to be humiliated like that and hopes that it doesn‚Äôt happen like that again. Priya was able to work the fish station better with Hayley‚Äôs help, with the latter saying that being the mentor feels good as that‚Äôs what a head chef is. However, Garrett once again needed more time on pork, which held the kitchen up again. Ramsay told Garrett to communicate sooner rather than just guessing along the way, which he agreed with. After waiting that few couple minutes, Garrett was able to send that pork to the window.

Back in the blue, they were on their last ticket of the night. Lexi and Josiah were up to send their stuff to the window, but when Derek cut into the wellington, it was under, which made it go into the oven. Ramsay asked where the wellington was and egged Derek to keep it moving and catch up. After getting the wellington to the plate, Ramsay called Derek over and asked him what was wrong with the wellington. He replied, confused as nothing was wrong, and Ramsay agreed. This made Derek and the rest of the blue relieved it wasn‚Äôt something bad. Both kitchens were able to finish their tickets and service was finished for the night.

With the chefs lined up in the kitchen, Ramsay praised them for a strong service and actually called it the best service they‚Äôve had in the competition by far. However, the show must go on and Ramsay asked both teams to come up with one nominee for elimination, before telling them to get out.

Back in the dorms the red team were considering either Garrett or Priya for nomination. Marcus was first to say they both did a good job, but believed that Garrett should go up because he held back the team and not saying before that he needed more time. Garrett said that he‚Äôs not willing to go down without a fight, while saying that Priya should go for just randomly cooking an unnecessary fish, which Priya took in as constructive criticism. Hayley was pretty worried because she respects everyone on the red team, and if one of them went home, it would suck. Meanwhile, the blue team was agreeing that Lexi was the nominee. Josiah was comforting her, saying this isn‚Äôt a team up of sorts, but Lexi actually agreed to having her as the nominee. As she said she didn‚Äôt suck, it was that Josiah and Derek were better at the service. Derek praised Lexi for her maturity and willingness to do that, but it did scare him on how willing she was to put herself up.

As the chefs line up in the dining room, Ramsay asked if they'd made a decision, which all replied yes to. Ramsay surprised the chefs by saying that it was pretty obvious who the two would be based on the mistakes made in service, that being Garrett for his mistiming and miscommunication on meat and Lexi, for blunders on fish, which prompted him to ask the two to step forward. Ramsay first asked Garrett why he should stay in Hell's Kitchen, to which the latter replied that he was being honest and didn‚Äôt want to send up over or undercooked meat and that once he can shine, he can keep shining to the end. Ramsay then asked Lexi why she should stay in Hell's Kitchen, to which the latter replied she knows she's made mistakes, but she doesn't feel that she shouldn‚Äôt go home because of them because it didn‚Äôt hold the kitchen back, it was just a minor error. Ramsay admitted that he didn‚Äôt want to send someone home after such a good service but in the end, eliminated Garrett. Ramsay said that he‚Äôs just not the leader he‚Äôs looking for, but praised him for his growth and drive throughout the competition, also saying that he moved him to the red team to improve himself, which he did. After Ramsay took Garrett‚Äôs jacket, Hayley stopped them and the red team gave Garrett one last group hug before leaving. Garrett commented that one of the red members needed to win this, while also wishing luck to the blue team. As Garrett left, he said Hell's Kitchen was a kick in the ass, but found so much of his strength in cooking despite not working culinary for so long. Garrett said that his Hell‚Äôs Kitchen door may have closed, but so many others had opened, thanking Ramsay.

As he looked over the final six chefs, Ramsay stated that the endgame is in sight. The best of the best are still standing and he needs to see a rise out of the few who are ready to be the cream of the crop. The chefs were dismissed. Priya was sad that a chef with so much improvement had to leave , but was happy that she was able to keep it kicking and Priya would be the next head chef. Derek said that each of them have a one-in-six shot of having their life change forever, and he needs to keep up or things will get messy soon

-----------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening treatments in San Diego, CA, have gained immense popularity for those looking to enhance their smiles. A bright, white smile can make a significant difference in your self-esteem and overall appearance. Here are some compelling benefits of teeth whitening treatments that you might want to consider.

### Boosts Confidence

One of the most notable benefits of teeth whitening is its ability to boost your confidence. When your teeth are white and bright, you are likely to smile more often. This simple act can lead to more positive interactions in both personal and professional settings. A radiant smile can create a lasting impression, making you feel more open and approachable.

### Enhances Appearance

A whiter smile can noticeably enhance your overall appearance. Stained or discolored teeth can make you look older or less appealing. Teeth whitening treatments help remove these stains, giving you a fresher and more youthful look. Whether it‚Äôs for a special event, a job interview, or just everyday life, a bright smile can elevate your appearance.

### Fast and Effective Results

In San Diego, numerous dental clinics offer teeth whitening solutions that deliver fast and effective results. Many treatments can brighten your teeth by several shades in just one visit.

If you‚Äôre short on time but desire a bright smile, professional teeth whitening can be the answer.

### Long-Lasting Effects

Teeth whitening treatments typically provide long-lasting effects when cared for properly. While individuals may experience some fading over time, maintaining good oral hygiene and following aftercare instructions can extend the longevity of your results.

Comparing At-Home vs. Professional Teeth Whitening Options in San Diego, CA
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to achieving a brighter smile, people often wonder about the best teeth whitening options available in San Diego, CA. With a variety of choices, you might be considering the benefits of at-home kits versus professional treatments. Here‚Äôs a closer look at both approaches to help you make an informed decision.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Understanding At-Home Teeth Whitening

At-home teeth whitening products are an appealing option for many. They often include whitening strips, trays, or gels that you can use at your convenience. Here are some key points about at-home whitening:

- **Cost-Effective:** Generally, at-home products are less expensive than professional treatments. You can find kits ranging from $20 to $150.
- **Convenience:** You can use these products whenever it suits you, making them easy to fit into your daily routine.
- **Gradual Results:** Many at-home options offer gradual whitening, which can be gentle on your teeth and allow for less sensitivity.
- **Variety of Choices:** There is a wide variety of products available in stores or online, so you can choose one that best fits your needs.

However, there are also some downsides to consider. Many at-home whitening products may not deliver the dramatic results that professional options can provide. Additionally, there is a risk of improper application or overuse, which can result in tooth sensitivity or gum irritation.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Exploring Professional Teeth Whitening

Professional teeth whitening in San Diego, CA, typically takes place in a dental office and utilizes stronger whitening agents. Here‚Äôs what to keep in mind about this option:

- **Immediate, Noticeable Results:** Professional treatments can brighten your teeth several shades in just one session, providing quick results.
- **Expert Guidance:** A dentist will evaluate your dental health and customize the treatment to your needs, ensuring safety and effectiveness.
- **Advanced Techniques:** Dentists often use advanced technologies, such as laser whitening, that can enhance the whitening process.
- **Longer-Lasting Effects:** With proper care, the results from professional whitening can last longer than at-home methods.

On the flip side, professional treatments usually come with a higher price tag, often ranging from $300 to $1,000 depending on the method and the provider. Some people may also experience temporary sensitivity following treatment, which is typically short-lived.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Which Option is Right for You?

Your choice between at-home and professional teeth whitening in San Diego, CA, will depend on several factors:

- **Your Budget:** Determine how much you‚Äôre willing to spend on whitening. At-home kits are more affordable, while professional treatments are an investment.
- **Your Time:** If you need immediate results, professional whitening is likely the better option. For gradual improvements, at-home kits may suffice.
- **Dental Health:** Consult with your dentist to understand your dental health and whether at-home options are suitable for you.
- **Desired Level of Whiteness:** If you‚Äôre aiming for dramatically white teeth, professional whitening will likely give you better results.

Regardless of which option you choose, maintaining good oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups will help keep your smile bright. After whitening, avoiding food and drinks that stain your teeth, such as coffee and red wine, will also prolong your results.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Ultimately, both at-home and professional teeth whitening options have their merits. Understanding your needs and preferences will guide you in choosing the right path to a brighter smile in sunny San Diego, CA.

### Conclusion

Achieving a brighter smile can significantly boost your confidence and improve your overall appearance. In San Diego, CA, teeth whitening treatments offer a variety of benefits that go beyond aesthetics. Whether you choose professional treatments or at-home options, the results can be remarkable. Professional whitening services can provide quicker and more dramatic changes, often utilizing advanced technology that goes beyond what over-the-counter products can accomplish. On the other hand, at-home treatments offer convenience and flexibility, allowing you to maintain a bright smile on your own schedule.

However, it‚Äôs important to consider the potential drawbacks of each method. While at-home options might seem appealing, they often require consistent effort and can sometimes lead to uneven results. Professional whitening, while more expensive, may be worth the investment if you‚Äôre looking for immediate and noticeable effects.

Ultimately, the choice between professional and at-home teeth whitening in San Diego, CA, depends on your individual needs, budget, and desired results. Regardless of your choice, the key is to maintain good oral hygiene practices to ensure your newly whitened teeth stay bright for as long as possible.

A radiant smile is within your reach, whether through the cutting-edge treatments offered by local dental professionals or the convenience of at-home kits. Embrace the journey toward a whiter smile, and enjoy the confidence that comes with it.

I have no intention of brewing anything else but pour over.

My ideal flavor profile and goal would be sweetness, clarity. 

This has been beat dozens of not hundreds of times but this is what I can surmise from ChatGPT:

When deciding between the ZP6 and the K-Ultra for brewing sweeter cups with Geisha beans through pour-over, here‚Äôs how they compare based on performance and design:

ZP6
	‚Ä¢	Burr Design: The ZP6 has a more traditional burr set that leans towards clarity and sweetness. It emphasizes separation of flavors, making it excellent for showcasing the nuanced fruity and floral notes of Geisha coffee.
	‚Ä¢	Grind Consistency: Known for its consistency in medium-fine grind sizes, ideal for pour-over methods like V60 or Chemex.
	‚Ä¢	Sweetness Profile: Tends to highlight brighter and sweeter flavor notes, making it a strong contender for Geisha coffees.
	‚Ä¢	Ease of Use: The ZP6 is manual, which can provide greater control during grinding but requires effort and time.
	‚Ä¢	Portability: Compact and travel-friendly for manual brewing setups.

K-Ultra
	‚Ä¢	Burr Design: The K-Ultra features high-end, modern burr geometry optimized for a balanced flavor profile. It excels at delivering clean and complex cups but may lean slightly towards body and balance rather than sheer sweetness.
	‚Ä¢	Grind Consistency: Extremely consistent at a wide range of grind sizes, including the medium-fine settings needed for pour-over.
	‚Ä¢	Sweetness Profile: Offers sweetness but balances it with body and depth, which may slightly mask the delicate floral and fruity notes of Geisha compared to the ZP6.
	‚Ä¢	Ease of Use: Often an electric or semi-automatic grinder, making it more convenient but less hands-on.
	‚Ä¢	Portability: Bulkier, better suited for stationary setups.

Recommendation

For brewing sweeter cups with Geisha beans:
	‚Ä¢	Go with the ZP6 if you prioritize maximizing sweetness and want to highlight the floral and fruity complexities of Geisha. It‚Äôs ideal for those who appreciate manual precision and don‚Äôt mind the extra effort.
	‚Ä¢	Choose the K-Ultra if you want a balance of sweetness and body, prioritize convenience, or have a larger variety of coffee profiles in your brewing rotation.

If sweetness and clarity are your top priorities, the ZP6 edges out as the better option for Geisha pour-overs.

I wanted to get one more round of eyes on this and see if it's any better. Thanks for the help.

\---

Dear (Agent),

I am seeking representation for my queer, contemporary fantasy novel, DARK ROAST, complete at 100,000 words. Based on (personalization), I believe we would be a good fit. DARK ROAST will appeal to readers who enjoyed the themes of life and death in *Under the Whispering Door* by TJ Klune and the supernatural, steamy lesbian romance of *An Education in Malice* by S.T. Gibson.

Danny is too eager to start over after the death of her girlfriend, Astrid, despite being haunted by her literal, ever-present, and silent ghost. All Danny wants is to find a job and keep Astrid‚Äôs ghost from ruining her new future. But a chance encounter at a coffee shop where the living can speak with the dead reveals that Danny‚Äôs grief is keeping Astrid‚Äôs spirit from moving on. The alluring coffee shop owner, Nora, offers Danny a way forward in her life by working through the memories that keep Astrid‚Äôs spirit trapped. Danny is reluctant to participate, believing she has grieved enough. But after Astrid nearly kills Danny in a house fire, she accepts Nora‚Äôs help to break the spiritual tethers that keep her former girlfriend bound to her.

In addition to freeing Astrid, Danny takes on the role of Nora‚Äôs apprentice, learning to help other patrons communicate with their own tethered spirits. Through training sessions with others like Nora, Danny finds fulfillment in her work. Even more than that, a romance quickly blossoms with Nora, complicating Danny‚Äôs remaining connection with Astrid. However, Nora makes it clear that Danny must resolve the connection with Astrid before they can truly be together.

Throughout all of this, Danny participates in rituals requiring her to physically re-live the painful months leading up to Astrid‚Äôs death from cancer. She walks through memories of chemo treatments and hateful attacks from Astrid‚Äôs religious family, all while avoiding the inevitable memory of Astrid‚Äôs death. With a growing attraction to Nora, Danny struggles with the connection that ties Astrid to her while also aching to move on. To free Astrid, Danny must come to terms with her alleged part in Astrid‚Äôs death, but guilt and grief may prove to be too powerful of a force to overcome, even with the potential for a future with Nora.

Danny's story answers the question: what would you say to people you lost if you met them over coffee? My own experience with my queer identity and the loss of loved ones from cancer are what gives life to Danny‚Äôs story. I‚Äôve spent ten years in copywriting and marketing and hope to debut in the creative writing world. When I‚Äôm not writing, I enjoy time with my partner and our two kids, with a sliver of time devoted to throwing pottery at my local clay guild.

The sibstrate is a mix of older tanks‚Äô sand and soil, aquasoil, and new black soil capped with a good inch of a mixture of silica sand and the smallest grade of pebbles I could get.

It‚Äôs stocked with ramshorn and bladder snails, who knows how many of each, 11 black neon tetras, and, initially, 6 dwarf neon rainbows. Three got dropsy a few days into getting them into the tank, and did not make it sadly, so I‚Äôm waiting on my lfs to quarantine the ones they have to get more company for the three who are left.

I‚Äôve tried 3 types of beans so far (first from the supermarket, then two different freshly roasted ones from a specialty coffee store), but I need to set the grind size to finest (size 1 on the side of the machine) to get even a remotely okay cup of espresso. This was the same for all of the beans. If I‚Äôm lucky, I get 22 sec (including pre-infusion) but nothing above that. Pressure gauge shows the right amount of pressure. 

The inner burr setting is set to default 6. At my local coffee store they said I shouldn‚Äôt have to change that setting and that a grind size of 5 or 6 on the side of the machine should be more than okay to get a good extraction. Yet it isn‚Äôt. What to do?

His dad, however, has been extremely clingy the whole time I was here. On the first day when we met for the first time, my boyfriend‚Äôs dad came with him to meet me even after telling my boyfriend I‚Äôd like to meet him one on one first. After we met, his dad wanted to take us to the mall which we did.

His dad has called either me or my boyfriend every morning around 8-9am asking what our plans were for the day. If we don‚Äôt respond because we‚Äôre sleeping, he‚Äôll text us. Throughout the day when it‚Äôs just my boyfriend and I, he‚Äôll call my boyfriend asking what we‚Äôre up to. The 2nd day I was there, we spent basically the whole day with his dad. The third day, we attended his family‚Äôs Christmas party with his dad. On the 4th day, my boyfriend‚Äôs dad called him again in the morning and asked what our plans were for the day. My boyfriend told him we‚Äôre just gonna hang out around the town for a bit and his dad kind of started to guilt trip him by saying ‚Äúoh okay, well i‚Äôll figure out what to do here then.‚Äù My boyfriend felt guilty and asked if I wanted to go to Dunkin so we can bring his dad coffee. I asked him if we could just spend the day together since we haven‚Äôt spent one day just he and I. His dad called him two additional times throughout the day to see what was going on. Towards the evening, my boyfriend felt guilty and asked if I wanted to stop by his house to see his dad. At that point, I was just upset because I felt his the whole trip, his dads been a chaperone. I was kind of huffy about it and he said he wanted to stop by because his dad‚Äôs lonely but we didn‚Äôt have to go.

How can I bring this up to my boyfriend without upsetting him or hurting his feelings? His dad‚Äôs a very nice guy and I‚Äôm sure he just wants me to have a good time but we‚Äôre adults and I just feel like he‚Äôs been way too involved in what we do. I came here to meet my boyfriend, not to spend everyday with his dad. I didn‚Äôt mind hanging out with him for a day or two but he‚Äôs wanted to basically everyday.

1hkqfb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1hkqfb5/postpartum_weight_loss_help/,Postpartum weight loss help,"TW: discussed pregnancy loss 

Hello! Im a FTM to an incredibly adorable 6 month old who is struggling to drop the remaining baby weight and I was hoping this community would be more helpful than my doctor / google (whose main recommendation was to get ‚Äúgood enough quality sleep‚Äù). 

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and I weighed 152 when I got pregnant which was already a bit heavy. I should weigh 135 but the last few years have been tough - I gained all the way up to 162, was able to drop down to 148 by 2022, but then went through a series of pregnancy losses (one at 6w, one at 20w), then did ivf which between the stress and hormones made my body refuse to lose weight and instead gain a few pounds. I had a healthy pregnancy, gained up to 175 and by the time I was six weeks postpartum I had dropped down to 157. The problem is that no matter what I do the scale (and the measurements) isn‚Äôt budging. 

I started walking as soon as I was home from the hospital, starting out with short walks and now average 3-4 one hour walks a week. I also started going to barre 3-4 time a week once I was 3 months postpartum. I do a mix of their classic classes and HIITs. I try to go to the gym for a lifting session but it‚Äôs pretty hit or miss - sometimes I‚Äôll go 3 times a week and then I‚Äôll go a month without stepping into the gym. From a diet perspective, definetly room for improvement but it‚Äôs not horrible - I don‚Äôt drink, the only calories I drink are a coffee in the morning, and I try to get >60 grams of protein a day. Breakfast is oatmeal, snacks are yogurt with fruit, lunch is cheese and crackers, but dinner is difficult and can either be great or a calorie bomb. We don‚Äôt do takeout or go out too often, it tends to come in waves with some weeks we don‚Äôt do it at all and then other weeks we‚Äôll get food 3 times that week. I‚Äôm trying to cut that out but I‚Äôm also realistic. We have a baby and there‚Äôs a million things that come before cooking a healthy dinner. 

I did see my doctor at the 5 month mark and she basically told me not to expect to lose any weight until I‚Äôm at the year mark. One nurse actually congratulated me for losing any weight so far, and another told me I‚Äôm amazing for working out. I know they‚Äôre the professionals but that just felt horrible to hear. I‚Äôm healthy - barre has helped my core, my resting heart rate is low, I can lift heavier, and I know I have the energy to keep up with my kid once they start walking - but I hate the number on the scale, how clothes fit me, and how I look in the mirror. 10-20lbs on some isn‚Äôt much, but on my small body it‚Äôs a lot and it‚Äôs disheartening doing 85% of the right things only to be told ‚Äúsorry, hormones‚Äù. 

So‚Ä¶I was wondering if anyone had some tips to share or can just commiserate. Did you have to do some extreme diet to lose the weight or did you find that once your kid hit a year you dropped it all? Was there a diet or exercise you found that helped you?

When I was a kid and only with my two cousins, grandma usually went to shopping and came back with two expensive popsicles and one cheap (for me). During xmas evening, they both got toys or perfumes, clothes etc, and I got socks, notepad, or secondhand scarf (unwearable). Teatime, I had to do the dishes with cold water on poor flow, small amount of dish soap. Every time. I was forbidden to have a cake, because it's for coffee drinkers. We are a larger family so the dishes started at 30. When I refused to do it, I was called spoiled brat. I used to sleep under the stairs, with heater turned off, because gas is expensive, wood is also expensive for heating. 
Now my mom (her side of family) is wondering why I avoid them as much as I can.

He asked me where I am from and he also told me about his birthplace.... Later he asked me about some good places to roam around and where I usually go for coffee... Then I gave him the location  After that he said Can you take me there and let's have a cup of coffee I said No I have to go back to my room  it's pretty late.

I checked the time and it was 9:15am. I looked around and no one else was in the room. I wonder where they went? Usually, those two don't mind sleeping in during weekends. I get out of bed and follow my usual morning routine. Once I'm all refreshed, I check around to see if they are home.

Living room, empty. Balcony, empty. Kitchen, empty. Every room, empty. Where were they? I checked my phone and I saw 3 messages in our group chat.

""Hey sweetheart, Elaine and I are just at the library. She asked me to help her with some Bracer paperwork.""

The second was a picture of them taking a selfie with Claire smiling and Elaine winking.

The third message was a voice note and when it played, I could hear Elaine's voice.

""Hey honey, hope you slept well after yesterday üòä. Can't wait to see your face later. You were so obedient last ni- Ok Elaine that's enough. Talk to you later sweetheart, make sure you don't do anything bad... Ok?""

I guess Claire took the phone off her haha.... Well since they're both out, I'll just go to a cafe for breakfast.

I headed to the nice little cafe which was near our place and not far from the library that those two were at. I decided to order a cappuccino and a slice of cheesecake. The cafe was surprisingly empty. I guess I was one of the first customers.

My order arrived and I took a picture of it so that I could send it to our group chat. Claire reacted to it with a üòã emoji while Elaine sent a message.

""Looks delicious honey. I'm surprised you decided to go out alone though... Make sure you behave yourself, ok? üòâ""

A small shiver ran down my spine as I realized what Elaine was trying to say. How did she know I was at a cafe anyway? It's not like I wasn't capable of baking myself. Probably just a lucky guess from her part. Not like she could track my location or anything haha...

Before I could get deeper into that train of thought, a voice called my name. I looked up and a familiar face was at the entrance of the cafe. Alisa Reinford. She was in her office attire so she was probably going to order a coffee or something before leaving for work.

""O-Oh hello Alisa. It's been a while haha.""

She walked up to me and smiled. She was a kind and intelligent lady. Claire had always spoken highly of her. 

""It sure has been a while! I think the last time I saw you was when you were with Claire, during an evening walk around here right?""

Alisa didn't live far from where we did so it wasn't that uncommon to see her in the area every now and then. 

""You're right! You look well. Were you on the way to work or something? I notice you've got your office clothes on.""

Alisa chuckled and nodded.

""Keen eye you've got there. Yes sadly I have some small jobs that I need to do at the office, even if it's a weekend. The life of a manager am I right? Where are Claire and Elaine by the way? Not with you?""

""Oh they are actually at the library right now. Something about Lainey's bracer paperwork haha. I thought I'd enjoy breakfast here since they were out.""

Alisa looked like she was thinking, until she spoke.

""Oh well in that case, how about I join you for a bit? It'd be nice to have some company before I head off to my amazingly fun office.""

A few words ran through my head. Surely it would be fine right? I didn't see Alisa in THAT way and it would be really rude of me to say no. ""Make sure you don't do anything bad... Ok"". ""Make sure you behave yourself, ok?"". Well it would be bad if I was rude to Alisa right?

""Sure thing Alisa! Feel free to join.""

Alisa smiled and then ordered a coffee. We talked about what was going on in our lives. She was clearly a workaholic with the way she was so absorbed in her occupation. I couldn't help but respect her hard work. Around 30 minutes passed by before Alisa said that she needed to go.

""I enjoyed talking to you! It's always good to catch up! Well I've got to go to work now so tell Claire and Elaine that I said hi. See you!""

I waved her goodbye and finished my meal. During our conversation, the cafe had apparently filled up without me realizing. I had mostly been paying attention to what Alisa was saying so that I could keep a conversation going. What I didn't notice was that at the opposite side of the cafe, at a table that was barely outside of my viewpoint, there were 2 girls seated. 

There were 2 coffees on their table that were untouched. My heart started to beat faster and faster. Their eyes were locked onto mine. How long had they been there? Did they... Did they see me talking to Alisa? They drank their coffees extremely quickly which meant that they were probably cold. Those coffees had been there for a while.... The 2 girls had been there for a while.

They walked over to me and I was unable to move. The blue haired girl spoke first.

""Looks like you had fun chatting with someone.""

Her expression was blunt and unamused. The blonde girl then leaned into me and whispered in my ear. 

""You look like you were having the time of your life. I guess Ms.Reinford had you excited hmm? Are we not good enough for you? You enjoy sneaking around behind our backs?""

Before I could speak she grabbed my hand and pulled me. All 3 of us exited to the cafe and her grip was not loosening. 

""Um guys? I think there's a misunderstanding here. It was just a-""

Claire spoke first.

""Stop it.""

Then Elaine.

""How many times do we need to do this... Honey? Just keep your mouth shut until we're back home.""

Why does Aidios have it out for me?

Really, these games were one of the only things that kept me sane in this house. That, my phone, and drawing. My parents didn't know I had the gaming console of course. There would be all sorts of questions, as we, let alone I, could never afford such a thing. I had been really good though which meant I might be able to ask‚Äì

A sudden knock at my bedroom door made my blood freeze. My scared reflex caused me to throw the console under my bed and stand in a breath. I heard the console hit something hard, and the sound it made had my eyes widening.

That was when my door opened.

‚ÄúAbby? Dinner's ready, hun,‚Äù My Mom paused when she took in my distress. ‚ÄúWhat's that look? Is everything okay in here?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Äì it's nothing. You just surprised me. I bumped my foot.‚Äù

Mom studied me as I made an attempt at fake pain.

‚ÄúWere you just sitting on the floor all afternoon in your cat pajamas?‚Äù She said.

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ kind of.‚Äù

Mom shook her head and sighed.

‚ÄúWell, come on then.‚Äù

I followed her out of the room, hoping to God that I hadn't broken anything. I only just remembered to give myself a slight limp.

Our beige living room/open kitchen smelled like oven-baked leftovers. Our house was simple. All of our furniture items were hand-me-downs, including our somewhat small Christmas tree that sagged with the weight of its dangerously jagged topper. 

There were a few presents under the tree, as Mom and Dad no longer bothered to wait until tomorrow night to sneak them out. That's okay though. I knew Santa's helper would be bringing even more presents then. The night of Christmas Eve.

Some of my friends at school made fun of me for still believing in Santa and his helpers. They said I was way too old to think that. I made the mistake of telling them when we went to the mall last week. 

How could I not believe though? I'd met his helpers with my own eyes, seen great happiness come from their gifts. I know that some presents come from my parents, just not all of them.

My dad sat on our throw-up colored corduroy couch in the living room, watching a news segment on our decade-behind television.

*‚Äú...The ‚ÄòChristmas Crook‚Äô as they've been called in previous years. Police ready themselves for yet another round of thefts, as tomorrow is the anniversary of the first two incidents. Two different malls hit in the same way, missing toys and other gifts, but no cash ever taken. Regina is currently at the Sheriff's Department where Sheriff Johnson has some advice for worried citizens. Regina?‚Äù*

‚ÄúTch. Why can't they just catch the guy already if it's such a problem?‚Äù My dad mumbled at the TV. The screen shifted to a different scene.

*‚ÄúThat's right, Roger. I'm here now with our lovely Sheriff. Sheriff Johnson, what precautions does the Police Force recommend our viewers take this holiday season?‚Äù*

The Sheriff leaned awkwardly to reach Regina's height of the mic.

*‚ÄúIn regards to this dangerous criminal, we hope anyone with a tip will call in. We're doing our best to catch them red handed this year. The rules are simple really. Keep your doors locked, report any strange activity, but most importantly, have happy holidays.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúThank you, Sheriff Johnson. If this theft occurs again, this will be the third year in a row that this criminal has run free. How has such a dangerous criminal managed to evade police capture for so long? Why not get help from outside officials?‚Äù*

The Sheriff eyed the reporter and sighed.

*‚ÄúLook, we're a smaller town, as you well know, Ms. Jensen. Jurisdiction is a thing we have to consider. In the grand scope of the law, this is seen as a pretty trivial matter. The Christmas season is just a time where several types of crime rise nationwide. That's the fact. Taking advice is one thing, but we've‚Ä¶‚Äù*

‚ÄúJames, can you turn that off? Abby's here for dinner.‚Äù Mom said.

Dad lowered his newspaper and glanced backwards, seeing where we stood. He seemed unsure, but eventually got up from the couch with visible reluctance. I'm surprised the deteriorating fabric didn't reach out to pull him back down.

We all walked to the scratched dining table.

‚ÄúHave you seen all this, Sarah? I don't know why everyone's so upset honestly,‚Äù Dad began. ‚ÄúThis ‚ÄòChristmas Crook‚Äô seems to just steal from those big mall stores. Who cares if ‚Äòmillion-dollar-incorporated‚Äô loses a few hundred a year? The audacity is just‚Ä¶‚Äù

Dad trailed off when he saw Mom's look. He huffed and sat.

‚ÄúDo they know where the Christmas Crook will hit this year? I'd bet it's the Cornerspark Mall.‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúThey were thinking that‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's nothing a kid needs to worry about, right Dad?‚Äù Mom interjected. Dad rolled his eyes.

‚ÄúSure. Whatever your Mom says.‚Äù

I took my seat at the table. Grandma's old clock clicked methodically on the wall as the oven timer went off. Mom brought a steaming baking dish to the table, and put a hot pad under it.

‚ÄúSpaghetti casserole again?‚Äù Dad moaned. Mom only glared in reply.

‚ÄúWell, we can't afford much else right now, right? It's okay.‚Äù I said. Both of my parents looked at me.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, hun?‚Äù Mom with suspicion.

‚ÄúI heard you two talking. I know we have more hard times than most people. It's why we don't get as good of a Christmas either.‚Äù

‚ÄúSee? Abby's a smart kid for her age. We don't need to coddle her like you insist on.‚Äù Dad said.

Mom said nothing, and placed a plate aggressively in front of Dad.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù He said indignantly. 

I laid my head on the table with a quiet sigh.

Dinner was as it usually was. Tense, and somewhat bland of flavor. Not that I'm complaining too much. I knew Dad and Mom both worked very hard at their jobs. The worst part was seeing their faces as they glared at one another. They would probably fight when they thought I was asleep.

After dinner, I went to my room. Their arguing did eventually start. To distract myself, I pulled the console from under my bed and inspected it with a wince.

As was always my luck, it was bad. The console had hit a dumbbell I'd stowed under my bed, which made me curse my strange workout phase in 6th grade. Luckily it didn't completely shatter the screen, but combine that with one of the controllers being jammed? The whole thing was unplayable.

I sighed again, hid the broken console, and listened to the yelling as I drew cats in my journal. 

Christmas season was always a high-tension time. It would be even worse after we came home from Grandma's. My comfort though is that it would be better after that. Santa's helper always made sure of it.

I couldn't help but wonder what gifts Santa's helper leaves for Mom and Dad. These mystery gifts seem to make them happier the following year. At least for a while.

I managed to fall asleep an hour later, and woke up the next morning to a rich smell. Bacon. This was always Mom's way of trying to clear the air after a hard day, making a special breakfast, but I knew this would likely be our last one until we were able to go shopping again. Likely not our last hard day however.

I rubbed my eyes as I walked out into the living room.

‚ÄúMorning, sweetie.‚Äù Mom called from the kitchen. Dad's news segment soon spoke over her.

*‚ÄúPolice have concluded that the break-in happened just last night, but at a currently unknown time frame due to security camera malfunctions. This time, the Cornerspark Mall on 4th avenue fell victim. Our reporter is on the scene. Regina, I'm having a bit of deja vu here‚Ä¶‚Äù*

A cheesy transition effect brought up a second screen next to the first. It showed the coat-bundled reporter standing in front of a snowy Cornerspark mall. The main entrance was marked off by yellow tape and surrounded by patrol vehicles.

*‚ÄúDeja vu indeed, Roger. Police have said that the calculated damages are likely to add up to several thousand dollars. That includes damaged security systems, and missing merchandise. They say it's like the thief had a perfect map of the mall for how little of a trace they left behind.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúWhat went missing this year, Regina?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúA very similar stock to last year, Roger. Toys, games, and even expensive video game consoles.‚Äù*

Roger chuckled to himself.

*‚ÄúWe may as well turn the day before Christmas Eve into ‚ÄòCrook Day‚Äô,‚Äù* Vanilla laughter rolled through the studio. *‚ÄúAnd yet there was still no physical money taken? Just like previous years?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúNone at all, Roger. Not a dollar bill or dime. The store managers have shown police one hundred dollar bills left untouched in registers. It truly makes one wonder‚Äì‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI'll tell you what I'm wondering,‚Äù* Roger interrupted. *‚ÄúI'm wondering just what strange urges this Christmas Crook has to find this amusing. Maybe he's just an excited kid at heart, huh? Some ‚ÄòJames Bond‚Äô type? Hell, maybe he's even named James too.‚Äù*

More scripted television laughter.

‚ÄúCan't you turn that off?‚Äù Mom said.

‚ÄúWhat? I want to hear about the Christmas Crook. I wish he'd bring some of those gifts to our house,‚Äù My dad leaned over the coach. ‚ÄúSpeaking of gifts, pass me a beer would you, Abbs?‚Äù

Mom stared at him severely. Before I could react, she snatched a beer from the fridge herself, and plopped that and a plate of breakfast on the coffee table in front of him. 

‚ÄúHey, careful! You'll fiz the beer up, Sarah.‚Äù Dad said.

Mom stormed back to the kitchen and handed me a fixed plate of my own.

‚ÄúEat up, sweetie.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, Mom. When are we going to Grandma's again?‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúTomorrow morning like always. Probably around nine. We'll open up our own presents when we get home.‚Äù

Once she had a plate of her own, Mom moved to leave, going to take her breakfast in the sitting room. She always did in a bad mood.

‚ÄúMaybe we should open our gifts first, Sarah? That way we don't get shamed by your mother again. It'd be quite anticlimactic.‚Äù Dad called between bites. Mom left the kitchen without a reply.

*‚ÄúIt's naturally all anyone talks about,‚Äù* Roger of the news station continued. *‚ÄúI mean, how can the police know that this guy is coming and still miss him every year? It really is a tradition now.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI guess the third time's the charm, Roger.‚Äù* Regina interjected.

*‚ÄúReally? I guess I'll have to ask you out for a third time eh? So how about that coffee, Regina?‚Äù* Regina stared blankly as the studio laughed. Dad laughed with them. *‚ÄúBrrr that frigid air must be contagious. Speaking of which, let's get to Jim with the weather segment already. We'll see the Christmas Crook next year I'm sure. December twenty-third on the dot. Don't disappoint us now.‚Äù*

The screen swiped to show a different man.

*‚ÄúThanks, Roger. Well folks, it's gonna continue to be a cold one here in our little town. As you can see, we're expecting a white Christmas again this year. More snowfall all down the valley following this big northern cold front. If you were planning on visiting family tomorrow, then pack a shovel. Or bundle up and grab some cocoa like me. The storm's supposed to start around midnight and continue throughout the rest of Christmas day.‚Äù*

‚ÄúWon't have to deal with a certain witch for a little while longer.‚Äù Dad mumbled. He must have forgotten I was there.

By the time sports came on, I had finished my breakfast and went back to my room. I could smell the cigarette mom had lit.

Despite it being Christmas Eve, it was quite the boring day. My console was indeed as good as broken. That left me to, how did Mom say it? ‚ÄòSit on the floor all day in my cat pajamas‚Äô. 

In truth, the day went even slower because I was excited. I knew Santa's helper was going to come tonight. For three years, he had always come on the night of Christmas Eve. I knew what I was going to ask Santa's helper for. I didn't really have a choice now since I broke it.

I hoped he wouldn't be too mad at me for breaking it. I had managed to hide it from my parents for the entire year like he asked, making sure that Mom and Dad didn't know that I had it. Maybe that would smooth over any offense.

We had casserole leftovers for lunch and dinner that day. Mom and Dad stayed away from each other, but that was easy for Mom to do since Dad was always in the living room.

My bedroom door opened around eight.

‚ÄúHey, Ab. Are you all ready and excited for tomorrow?‚Äù Mom said, but her smile was more tired than excited. She smelled like tobacco.

‚ÄúYep, all ready.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Just make sure to pack enough clothes, and don't stay up on your phone too late, okay? Early morning tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure thing, Mom.‚Äù

I got ready for bed soon, though Dad did stay up super late. He always did when he had time off. I eventually did hear his clomping steps though while I laid in bed.

By midnight, all of the sound and lights throughout the house were quiet. 

I snuck out of my room and sat where Dad usually sits on the couch. 

The Christmas tree was on. I kept the rest of the lights off, as I didn't want to wake my parents. All that kept me company was the ticking of Grandma's clock while I waited with a smile.

Pretty soon, that storm the news mentioned started up. Breezy wind and flaky snow. 

Almost exactly when Grandma's clock chimed one in the morning, I heard soft thuds on the roof above me. Footsteps. They trailed slowly across the living room until they reached the rain gutter at the front of the house.

I dashed to the Christmas tree. I took the plug out, turning off the rainbow lights, then plugged it back in. It flashed on and off in a slow rhythm. 

I saw a dark lump fall from the rooftop, then, after another moment of the lights flashing, a soft knock on window glass.

I dashed to the front door. It clicked quietly as I opened it, and a cold wind brushed my cat pajamas.

A tall, imposing figure dressed in black. Heavy breathing from behind a plastic Santa mask. Santa's helper stepped in silently as a cat, snow falling from his boots. He carried a heavy sack over his shoulder. He set it down near the tree.

‚ÄúAbby,‚Äù His voice growled, low and muffled. ‚ÄúIt is good to see you again. What is it you want for Christmas this year? You have been very good. Very helpful.‚Äù

My smile turned into a wince. I walked to the couch and brought my broken console to him. 

‚ÄúI accidentally broke it. Only yesterday. I threw it to hide it from my parents.‚Äù

Santa's helper nodded, and reached into the bag. He pulled out a brand new handheld video game console, the newest version even, with several games added on top.

‚ÄúI didn't have time to wrap this year. Police have been hot on the trail. Merry Christmas.‚Äù

I gave him a big hug.

‚ÄúThat's okay. I'm sure you and Santa are super busy anyway.‚Äù

A glimmer in the darkness of the mask eyeholes.

‚ÄúThat we are.‚Äù

I set the consoles down on the couch.

‚ÄúDo you need to leave my parents their gift now?‚Äù

Santa's helper nodded.

‚ÄúYes. I think it will last longer this year. The serum is more refined.‚Äù

Santa's helper walked methodically down the hall, leaving snow behind as he lumbered towards my parents‚Äô room.

I inspected the new console while I waited. I was really surprised. A whole new one, just like that? He wasn't even mad that I accidentally broke the other one? 

Since it was technically Christmas day, I began to set up the new console. I doubted I'd have much time to do this until later. It was a bit of a pain with my other one broken, but I managed to transfer the data.

Eventually I heard the thumping steps come back down the hall. I turned to behold the black-clad helper.

‚ÄúAll done?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù The helper said. ‚ÄúThere is one more thing. You've been good, Abby. Very good. Done all Santa and I have asked of you these past three years. The map you drew for me was perfect. Because of that, we want to award you. You may request another gift.‚Äù

My eyes went wide.

‚ÄúAnother gift?‚Äù

Santa's helper nodded.

‚ÄúThere are several good children overlooked in this town, and Santa wants me to show those children appreciation.‚Äù

I thought for a moment.

‚ÄúHonestly, I'd love to say ‚Äòa new phone‚Äô or something like that, but I was actually thinking about this earlier. Is there another gift we can give my parents? They've been having a really hard time lately, and I think something more would help them.‚Äù

Santa's helper only stood there for a moment.

‚ÄúUsually, that is against the rules, but I think I have just the thing. Tell me something, Abby. Your parents fight a lot, yes?‚Äù

I nodded.

‚ÄúWhom to you is innocent? Whom to you could learn a lesson?‚Äù

I frowned.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

Santa's helper knelt down.

‚ÄúHave you ever heard the story of Krampus? It's an old tale from old books.‚Äù

I shook my head.

‚ÄúKrampus was a nasty being. An entity that would give bad children harsh punishments instead of presents. A dark mirror to Saint Nicholas. Those punishments seemed cruel at first, but as those children grew, they came to understand that it was the greatest gift of all. Do you understand?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think so. Sometimes you have to hurt to feel better.‚Äù

A groaning creak like smiling tendons.

‚ÄúExactly, Abby. You are a smart girl. Their greatest gift is still in this sack, but its reward is less material. Do you trust me?‚Äù

I nodded. Santa's helper pulled another sack from inside the first, and left it where my dad always sat. Several toys and games spilled from it.

‚ÄúGood. Now, call the police after I'm gone. Tell them you woke up to catch Santa, and found that console and this bag in the house.‚Äù

My brows crimped in thought.

‚ÄúYou want me to set him up? But you're‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúYour father would benefit from some time away from home, don't you think? Learn to value what he has. It is the best gift I can give him. Hurt, then growth. Or should your mother receive it instead?‚Äù

I didn't know who was more innocent between my parents, but Mom always said it takes two to fight. Still, my Dad had initiated arguments a lot more than she had. Sometimes, Mom wore long sleeves on a hot day, or a turtle neck and jeans. Wincing like she was hurt. 

They had both had such rough lives. Maybe this would be best.

‚ÄúIf we lost my dad's money though, we'd be in trouble,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúMy mom does have a job, but I don't know if it would be enough to support both of us.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will make sure it is. Part of my gift. I would bet that the store will also let you keep the console as a reward for cracking the Christmas Crook. You have earned it.‚Äù

Santa's helper stood and made his way to the door.

The more I thought about it, the more it made sense. If I did this, we probably wouldn't be able to go to Grandma's for a while, especially Dad. That, at least, would make Dad happy.

I pulled out my phone and pressed the emergency dial. Santa's helper smiled.

How should I safely and effectively dose the following supplements for cognitive focus and brain fog removal, considering I drink coffee daily. Supplements I have:

* Ashwagandha KSM66 (200mg extract with 10mg Withanolides),
* Geratam (1200mg per tablet),
* Choline + Inositol (300mg each per tablet),
* N-acetylcysteine (500mg per tablet),
* Acetyl L-carnitine (1000mg per tablet)
* Noopept (10g powder)?

That's how I use it now:

# Morning Dose with coffee:

1. **Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALCAR)**: 1000mg
2. **Noopept**: 10-20mg
3. **Choline + Inositol**: 300mg each

# Evening Dose:

1. **Ashwagandha KSM66**: 200mg
2. **Geratam (Piracetam)**: 1200mg
3. **Choline + Inositol**: 300mg each

I am a healthy male, 190 cm tall and 86 kg in weight. I am not taking any other medication. My goal is mainly to improve my memory and concentration to work more and focus more. I drink 2x350ml coffee a day. I used noopept before for a bit. A dose of 10mg and I felt I was more focused than usual and better at avoiding distractions.

Ever since then I‚Äôve grown in love with the game. Not going to lie, it was difficult at first to adjust my mindset from that of a gamer to a role player. I still have a desire to create mechanically strong and coherent characters. But I‚Äôve really embraced the art of creating interesting thematic characters with clear strengths and clear weaknesses. 

One of my current characters has been an absolute treat to play. During COVID I got really into anime again and watched the Fate series. For those who are familiar, I don‚Äôt have to explain how beautiful the art style is and how great the characters/story is. One character that I loved, as does many others, is Gilgamesh. 

His aesthetic, combat style, and arrogant attitude mixed with banter is always enjoyable and no one can deny he keeps you engaged when he‚Äôs on screen. I wanted to create a character that drew from the idea of Gilgamesh and I‚Äôm surprised I haven‚Äôt seen more people talk about it. 

The build was extremely easy and basically begging to be played this way, a Sorlock. There are many ways to go but I thought genie warlock was the most fitting, with Gilgamesh being my patron. It just made sense that my eldritch blast was flavored as holy phantasm as Gilgamesh gives my character access to his arsenal of every weapon. 

I‚Äôm going a very standard sorlock build with 2 levels in warlock and rest in sorcerer. Note I have considered maybe adding Paladin as that can fit nicely into the theme. But for the time being it‚Äôs just the two classes. Quickening EB is similar to opening more portals. I have plans to do a massive upcast magic missile at some point for the iconic scene of a ton of portals opening up at once. 

My DM is allowing a pseudo coffee lock type build. Albeit we aren‚Äôt going too broken with it and I have clear constraints. I‚Äôm only allowed to do the multiple short rest cheese to get more slots when I enter my genie vessel as Gilgamesh is providing me a gift for coming to worship him in his domain. 

I love the character and he‚Äôs such a treat to narrate and explore. I‚Äôm excited to see him at higher levels and how the dynamic grows!",0,1734967575.0,DnD,0,0.5,False

There was a woman in line about two people ahead of me. She was taking something from her wallet when a few coins fell to the ground. What would most people do? Pick them up, right? But no, she didn‚Äôt do that. Instead, she stepped on the coins and dragged them toward her, still standing on them.   
  
She then pulled out her phone, and I noticed her signaling to someone‚Äîprobably her boyfriend (based on their body language). What did she do next? She asked him to pick up the coins. I looked around, wondering if maybe she was injured or something, but no, she seemed totally okay. I also checked if her clothes were an issue‚Äîshe was wearing a long, loose skirt, so she could have easily bent down to pick them up herself. She looked to be in her late teens or early twenties, so I doubt she had any physical limitations that would make getting the coins difficult.   
  
After her boyfriend picked up the coins, it was like nothing had happened. I honestly couldn‚Äôt believe what I just saw. In all my life, I‚Äôve never met anyone like this‚Äîwhether family, friends, or even acquaintances. Is this what 'princess treatment' really means? Is it about feeling entitled to have others do everything for you, no matter how trivial?   
  
I literally facepalmed when I saw that. Has anyone else witnessed something like this? What are your thoughts?",3,1734967412.0,CasualPH,4,0.8,False

1hkpyfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/chickenandeggsdiet/comments/1hkpyfz/read_this_guideline_i_wrote_on_the_best_way_to/,Read this guideline i wrote on the best way to lose weight !!,"Hi all, I was born fat, i have a slow metabolism, i come from a family with slow metabolisms, weight gain problems, diabetes 2, glaucoma and other weight-gain related problems.  I have 3 sisters and they are all overweight, and they are also trying to lose weight.

I am not overweight, but how ever i am artificially thin (meaning that if i quit dieting and exercising my body naturally would try to gain weight (that's according to the bodyweight thermostat theory)

So i have many years on a diet,  Since i was 14 years old, i am 29 years old now, i've been on a weght loss diet for many years.  Because i have always hated being overweight, chubby and bloated.

So from my own personal experience with my own battle against gaining weight, and all the reading i have done on great low-carb books, fasting books, great diet books like ""Why we get fat"" by Dr. Gary Taubes, great weight loss books by Dr. Eric Berg, Dr. Akins, Dr. Jason Fung, Dr. Shawn Baker, Dr. Jockers, Dr. Mercola and other great dieting books, weight loss and exercise books, this low-carb, (keto # 2). system of losing weight that i have written here, with about 30 to 50 grams of carbohdrates per day coming from green vegetables and some fruits.  But if you prefer just get your carbohydrate sources from only green vegetables.  Because fruits are considered according to some doctors as ""nature's candy"" because of their high sugar levesl which raise insulin levels.  And the main objective of losing fat and losing weight is not only to be in a calorie deficit until we reach our ideal body-weight.   But also other requirements are to keep the insulin levels low, the ghrelin hormone lelves low and leptin levels balanced and high.

I think this system it is best for most people who have very slow metabolisms and who have trouble losing weight

NOTE: You will need a decent amount of money, a good kitchen and a gym membership, but if you don't have access to a gym, a good pair of walking-running shoes will be enough.  Because fast-walking is enough for weight loss objectives

First of all, go to Walmart or any other supermarket and buy these ingredients:

1- 2 Whole chickens, and 1 bag of chicken leg quarters

2- 3 dozens of Eggs

3- Beef

4-Green Cabbage

5- Broccoli

6- Carrots

7- Diet Coke, Diet Sevenup, or any other Diet Soft drink flavor

8- Nutrasweet or Splenda Calorie free sugar

9- Black coffee (Bustelo is a good brand)

10- Apples, pears, pineapples.  You don't really need fruits, this is optional.  If you want just get your carbohydrates from the green vegetables.  (And remember no starchy carbohydrates are allowed in this system)

11- Seasonings to season the chicken and the meat: Seasoning mix powder, garlic, oregano, Soy Sauce, Vinager

12- Pam Cooking Spray

13- If you have a high-income buy some fish, buy tuna fish as well

14- Calorie-free Jello (gelating diet desserts) they are pretty good, taste good and do not have calories

Get into a low-carb, low calorie diet (you can try a low-carb, low calorie diet), get most of your calories from eggs, chicken and meat and get most of your carbs from green vegetables like green cabbage, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, brussel sprouts, broccoli, and a moderate small amount of fruits (apples, pineapple etc)

Do not eat starchy carbohydrates (bread, potatoes, rice, pasta etc

Calculate your cooked food by ounces so that you would like to lose weight and lost fat, i don't really know your calorie intake, you would have to calculate that by your own self

Plan your calorie intake of the whole day  to be at around between 1200 to 1700 calories ( depending on your metabolism).   You have to set-up the right calorie intake (by trial and error) by your own self, in a way that your weight loss calorie-deficit intake for a whole day would make you lose weight without starving to death.  Because it is possible to follow a very low calorie diet with a large calorie-deficit but with the second adverse effect of generating throughout the day extreme feelings of hunger.   So get a good calorie intake that would make you lose weight in a comfortalbe way in which you would feel hunger feelings in the day but not too extreme

Do not eat more than 40 grams of carbs per day (coming from the green vegetables and the fruits).

You have to weigh the green vegetables and the fruits by ounces as well in a food scale

If you don't have a weigh food scale, try to get a digital food scale at Walmarts or at any other supermarket grocery store

Do some fast walking like 40 to 60 minutes of fast walking (3 to 6 days a week), and some moderate basic weight training if you have access to any gym.  If not the fast walking is fine

Only drink coffee, tea with calorie free sweetener (aspartame or splenda) and diet coke, diet seven up between meals.

Hope these tips will help you



Merry Weight-Loss Christmas !!

There was a woman in line about two people ahead of me. She was taking something from her wallet when a few coins fell to the ground. What would most people do? Pick them up, right? But no, she didn‚Äôt do that. Instead, she stepped on the coins and dragged them toward her, still standing on them.   
  
She then pulled out her phone, and I noticed her signaling to someone‚Äîprobably her boyfriend (based on their body language). What did she do next? She asked him to pick up the coins. I looked around, wondering if maybe she was injured or something, but no, she seemed totally okay. I also checked if her clothes were an issue‚Äîshe was wearing a long, loose skirt, so she could have easily bent down to pick them up herself. She looked to be in her late teens or early twenties, so I doubt she had any physical limitations that would make getting the coins difficult.   
  
After her boyfriend picked up the coins, it was like nothing had happened. I honestly couldn‚Äôt believe what I just saw. In all my life, I‚Äôve never met anyone like this‚Äîwhether family, friends, or even acquaintances. Is this what 'princess treatment' really means? Is it about feeling entitled to have others do everything for you, no matter how trivial?   
  
I literally facepalmed when I saw that.",2,1734967221.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

As I'm pouring the water over in how many ever stages, some of that water will be absorbed by the beans or the filter and maybe get 250mL that goes through.

**Platform(s):**¬†I downloaded the game in my Ipad from the Appstore for free. But it's possible that it was also released on other platforms as Android.

**Genre:**¬†The game was about a miner exploring the underground, I think the goal of the game is just exploring but I'm not really sure.

**Estimated year of release:**¬†Unfortunately, I don't know when was this game released, but I can say that I was playing it between 2016-2017 (hope this is helpful).

**Graphics/art style:**¬†The game graphics were similar to those from Super Mario Maker, the gameplay was in 2D but with 3D models (character, animations, background... )

**Notable characters:**¬†The only character I had was a miner with a blue shirt (or a coat I'm not sure), and he was one block tall and he could jump one block high (when I say block I say the blocks from the game), I also remember the sound effect when he jumps, it was some sort of ""ughh"" which resonates if you were undergound, but the biggest notable detail was that he looks a lot like the guy from Jetpack Joyride  
Note: The game in not from HalfBrick co. I verified)

**Notable gameplay mechanics:**¬†The game has the same mechanic as Terraria, the deeper you explore the underground the darker it goes, you could also use torches if necessary, I'm pretty sure that there was some other items to break blocks but I don't remember them.

**Other details:**  
\_The blocks of the undergound were colored, most of the time with pink and blue but there was other colors for sure.  
\_The game has a day/night cycle.  
\_There was a money counter on the top left of the screen, and the number were written in a very medieval writing style, the number 2 was written as Z and 3 looked like a side reversed M.  
\_The money counter was colored in coffee like brown.

I hope this post will help you finding my game, sorry if some of the infomations are incorrect and I wish it's not going to be a problem in your researches, and if you have any questions I am open for answering it.

Jake Jr was a fun build because she‚Äôs so colorful- I was starting to get worried though because the LEGO color I had the least of was the one I was going to be using for all 3 of Jake‚Äôs daughters‚Äô hair‚Ä¶ so I had to ration it out and make it last.   Not only did I have very little of the color, but I had a very limited variety of pieces, so aside from frugal, I‚Äôd need to be creative to make it work‚Ä¶. Bright light yellow is really hard to come by!

It‚Äôs so nice enjoying the holidays with you here at Jake and Lady‚Äôs place!  Family gatherings are the best part of the holidays!  I wonder which Pup will walk through the door next!?  We‚Äôll find out tomorrow for sure ;). See you then!",31,1734966781.0,adventuretime,0,1.0,False

I would have loved to stretch it to 40 hrs but my parents won't let me + I'm sleepy too after a tiring day. 

I ate butter and bread and little bit of sandwich in morning and then 2 cup of shikran(banana milkshake (I love it)) and a Frankie that I get to eat only near clg and since it's a dummy clg n I go rarely so I eat it whenever I go. I don't think I can do dinner, I'll just sleep.

There seems to be a lot of positive buzz over the KF8, with some folks picking that over a Z10 regardless of the price.

""What did you say it was, Prop... what?"" he asked, handing her a warm cup of coffee before sitting down beside her on the carpet under the dark, starry sky.

""Propamnesia,"" she replied. ""I can't recall faces.""

""So, you don't know what I look like?"" he sounded confused and rather hurt.

""No, I know your face, and I can recognize you in a crowd of a million people,"" she explained calmly, looking into his eyes. ""I just cannot imagine your face when I close my eyes.""

""So... you can never tell what I look like to the police if I get kidnapped?"" he asked a unique question.

""Well... first of all, I won't need to explain because I have tons of your selfies you took with my phone,"" she chuckled at the innocence of his question. ""But you still cannot explain my face or what I look like if you didn't have a picture of mine... can you?"" he insisted, with a sulky look on his face, fidgeting with his coffee cup.

""Right, I admit I won't be able to do that,"" she said, taking the empty cup from his hands calmly. ""I can't describe your facial features if I close my eyes right now, even though I was looking at you the whole time."" She admitted with a bittersweet smile, while holding his cold hand.

""Oh... then, I just need to stay in front of you the whole time,"" he made a silly face, poking her dimples that were playing hide and seek in her bittersweet smile.

""Right..."" Her laughter filled the room. ""That solution took you a minute,"" she teased him.

""So, what do you remember about people when you close your eyes?"" he asked another question, his curiosity lighting up his eyes, even under the dark skies.

""Umm... I don't know if it will make sense, but I see vibes of people and not their facial features,"" she replied.

""Vibes...? Like red, green, blue, or happy, sad, angry vibes?"" he asked, with a confused look.

""No, like their souls and ghosts around them,"" she said, pretending to scare him with a dark expression. ""Really?"" He looked concerned, glancing around. ""I meant... haha, you are so silly, I was just messing with you."" She tried to suppress the urge to tease him and continued. ""I see gazes and not eyes, smiles and not lips when I close my eyes. That's what I meant by vibes."" She paused, waiting to see a glimpse of understanding in his face. ""I see your silly expressions and not facial features, and what I felt when I saw them... all those memories come flooding like a nostalgia attack, but only emotions, vibes, and memories of those moments distilled into plain emotions. Do you get it now?"" she asked, with a playful look on her face, expecting another question.

""Yeah... I get it,"" he said gently, playing with both their rings, stacking them up like a tower. ""That means you never fell in love with my face."" He looked up suddenly, making another silly remark.

""Pffttt, how did you even infer that... from this?"" She laughed out loud at his assumption.

""I adore you, everything about you... from the way you hold a cup with your pinky sticking out... to the way you mess with your bangs, trying to fix them up, only to mess them up more,"" she said, messing his bangs with her fingers, looking determined to prove herself. ""I love you and everything about you."" She smiled gently at him, waiting for his reply.

His eyes shone with subtle tears as he looked up and nodded at her words, feeling a sense of warmth even on a cold fall night. He could only see her, smiling brighter than the blanket of stars they were sitting under.

""Don't worry, I will always stay right here in front of you, to the point you get sick of me,"" he said, rubbing her cold hands to warm them up.

""Okay, mister hopeless romantic,"" she chuckled. ""Although I highly doubt I will get sick of it."" She smiled gently and shook her head, gazing lovingly at him, distracted by the fire dying down.

1hkpoau,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectors/comments/1hkpoau/egg_on_my_face_ust_alr_screen_coming_but_no_ust/,"Egg on my face: UST ALR screen coming, but no UST projector","Hey folks,

Being in my cave alone with Christmas deals does a number on my brain. After too much coffee and YouTube I decided I wanted a Nothing Projector motorized ALR UST screen and a Nexigo Aurora Pro UST. I went and ordered the screen AND I was JUST about to order an Aurora Pro, when I noticed that the MKII was open for preorder.

HURRAY, I thought. I get to save a little money for a little longer! The MKII is awesome, I‚Äôll just wait. I dropped the Aurora Pro out of my cart.

But. I had already ordered the screen. And unfortunately for me, my cancellation request was not noticed in time, and the screen is shipped as of 1AM this morning.

SO. I would love to know from y‚Äôall what option makes the most sense:

1. Keep the screen until I get the MKII.
2. Keep the screen but get a cheapo (or as cheap as makes sense) projector in the short-term so that I can at least use it
3. Return the screen and eat the restocking fee

What would you guys do in my situation? Is there an option that I‚Äôm not considering? 2 sounds the most tempting to me, but I‚Äôm not sure a cheapo projector would be all that compatible with a UST-designed ALR screen. 1 will ‚Äúfuture-proof‚Äù me (lol) but feels really silly in the meanwhile. 3 eliminates risk but leaves my wallet scarred.

So, I wanted to see what people‚Äôs favorite ways to repurpose or reuse things from the holiday season. This way instead of focusing on what‚Äôs out of our control we can see what we can do to help reduce the waste. I‚Äôll go first

I like to of course reuse the tissue paper and gift bags over the years. I also will save the ribbon on gifts and I can use it as string for homemade ornaments or I can turn it into hair bows. Cut scraps of wrapping paper I will use to make bookmarks or as picture frame backgrounds for the too small photos I pull out during the holiday season to switch out my frames. 

I‚Äôm a big coffee drinker and because of that I will get mugs as gifts. I like to use my mugs as pencil holders, paint brush holders, makeup brush holders etc to help me organize stuff in my apartment. The wider types of mugs I use as pet water bowls throughout my apartment because my cats always try to drink out of my cups anyways. 

If I get cheaper socks I will wear them until they get holes. Then I will turn those hole-y socks into cat toys by cutting them into strips and tying them together. I will also use the longer ones as reusable dusters for my fans and other hard to reach places. 

When I get a cute candle I do burn it (I don‚Äôt really buy them normally). I will then empty out the remaining wax after it‚Äôs done and reuse the candle jar as storage container or if you really like candles you can buy refillable ones. 

Gift tags I turned into a garlands and ornaments to hang around my apartment. I always pull out the Christmas cards I get as decor around my house. 

I know at a certain point you can have too much to potentially reuse but I‚Äôd like to think that there‚Äôs definitely ways to repurpose stuff so it‚Äôs not a total waste. ",7,1734966316.0,Anticonsumption,4,1.0,False

1hkpl7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopnoir/comments/1hkpl7j/some_final_thoughts_revelations_lessons_i_learned/,"Some final thoughts, revelations, & lessons I learned from Kpop this year","2024 has been very eventful, in both a good & bad way. A lot has happened & I wanted to share some of my final thoughts & mini-rants about this year, especially regarding Kpop. Most of these points aren't anything new, but I still want to talk about them anyway.

1. **Stop stanning companies & CEOs:**¬†This is mostly¬†in reference to¬†the hybe-ador drama, but the recent KG-JYPE situation backs it up even more. When I had to take a break from Kpop last year, I¬†started to realize¬†how weird the dynamic between fans & companies is & the past year has just made it worse. I've said this so many times this year, but I'll repeat it: companies are not people & we don't owe them our sympathy. Companies, both big & small, have been exposing themselves & the greed-driven underbelly of the industry. Even the companies that present themselves as ""more caring"" or ""different"" from the rest are still guilty of upholding these norms because the industry is too deep into late-stage capitalism. Things may change, but I don't see it happening soon.
2. **We need to acknowledge nuance:**¬†This is mainly related to NWJNs/Hybe-Ador. As cheesy as it sounds, two things can be true at once & I don't think we should apply black-and-white thinking to a¬†situation this complex. It's been exhausting watching company stans & outsiders try to assign Hybe/Bang PD & ador/MHJ a ""good guy"" or ""bad guy"" role in this ordeal when in actuality, both parties are at fault (in both a legal & ethical sense) & aren't worth the time. Also, it just overshadows the actual problems occurring on both sides (grooming, toxic work environment, etc). As for Nwjns, people need to stop using the perfect victim mentality; I don't agree with everything they've said or done, but that doesn't change the fact that they are victims of both MHJ & Hybe.¬† ¬†
3. **Some fans don't know how to act normal & need to dial it back when it comes to controversies & accountability:**¬†This is¬†in reference to¬†the Jennie smoking debacle, the many LSF controversies, & other incidents throughout the year. I think it's important to point out if an influential figure (which extends to celebrities) said/did something screwed up. However, some fans do not know how to make a critique or contribute to the discussion without resorting to bullying & harassment. Sending death threats & racism/xenophobia only creates more harm & contributes nothing to the conversation. Ik people love to pitch in & join the conversation¬†but¬†(as harsh as it sounds), keep it to yourself if you don't know how not to act vile (or learn how to make a valid argument).
4. **People are allowed to call out celebrities/idols when they screw up or do something problematic/inappropriate:**¬†This is jumping off the previous point. Fans must understand that not everyone with a ""not so positive"" thing to say about your faves is trying to ""cancel"" them or end their careers. While they may not be as influential as political figures or business people, celebrities do hold a tremendous amount of power & influence, hence why it's essential for them to be conscious & mindful of it. If people feel that a celebrity has misused or abused this power/influence, they are allowed to bring it up (IMO, it's kinda similar to calling out a friend or family member when they say or do something screwed up).¬†
5. **Some fans don't know what constructive criticism is or how to make a proper argument:**¬†this is re-iterating the previous points concerning art (it didn't feel appropriate to group it into conversations about racism, misogyny, etc.). Over the past year, I realized how nonexistent art & music criticism is in Kpop; the most we get is one or two articles & a couple of YouTubers making monthly roundups. But it's hard to find actual, in-depth critiques that break everything down, provide an analysis, & delve into what did/didn't work & why. Ik criticism in the arts & mainstream media has come under fire in recent years for various reasons ([iykyk](https://www.artefactmagazine.com/2024/11/20/halseys-new-album-the-hysterical-woman-and-medical-misogyny/)), but it's still essential & it's something Kpop might need. Sometimes, there'll be occasions when a group/artist's work comes under scrutiny & it results in a similar reaction mentioned before (""critics"" don't know how to make critiques & fans are overprotective). From experience as a creative writing student, criticism & feedback can help develop our work. Hence, ""critics"" need to learn how to properly critique without resorting to insults, xenophobia/racism,¬†etc¬†& fans also need to understand that not every critique is trying to undermine someone's work or end their career (rather, some of these people are also fans of these specific artists & want to see growth & improve).
6. **K-pop companies are not as professional as I thought:**¬†this refers to how certain companies (cough cough hybe & SM) handled certain situations & the use of AI. All this obvious (& frankly poor) use of AI & the conversations about bad English made me realize how often such tiny mistakes slip through the cracks in K-pop. How does a million-dollar company somehow miss a hand with [6 fingers](https://www.koreaboo.com/news/anticipated-comeback-billlie-ai-covers-backlash-artist/)?! This went through several people before getting approved & none of them noticed such an obvious flaw?!
7. **While the industry is making some progress with representation fans, fans need to listen & stop talking over minorities:**¬†this is mostly¬†in reference to¬†the Easy album & the Love Wins All controversy. I appreciate representation & diversity as much as the next, but, as the saying goes, not all representation is good. Sometimes, things meant to ""spread awareness"" can cause more harm & when that happens, people (especially those affected) have the right to bring it up. Yet there are still people (usually kids & teens) who, as I've mentioned before, take the criticism as an attack or proceed to spew controversial/invalid talking points that could border on discrimination. Instead of jumping to conclusions, listen. If you don't understand, then do research or ask questions. To be clear, this isn't to say you must agree every single time, but at least try to understand what you're talking about first.¬†
8. **We need to advocate more for staff:**¬†This is¬†in reference to¬†Employee B's lawsuit, the Nation Assembly (specifically the death of a hybe employee), & the backlash LSF's stylist got for criticizing Love Wins All. I'm guilty of complaining about stylists & staff as much as the next person, but some controversies exposed how bad things are behind the scenes for these people. When we talk about mistreatment in the industry, it is usually just about idols but not staff (even tho most of them hold very little power in comparison). Of course, some misuse their positions & inflict harm (like the staff that leak private photos & info about idols), but that doesn't excuse the way higher-ups &, in some cases, idols may use their power over them. This also extends to fans & how they sometimes bully staff (it's lowkey giving Karen vibes).¬†
9. **I-fans have a xenophobia issue:**¬†This is concerning how some fans were talking about Koreans/Asians following the Seunghan situation. (some) K-fans have done some very controversial & down-right horrendous things in the past & it has been normalized to some extent, but we need to stop treating them & the Korean public as a monolith. I highly doubt that every single briize from Korea wanted Seunghan kicked out & I-fans (as well as non-kpop western fans in general) can be just as guilty of feeding into this behaviour. This isn't to say that we shouldn't discuss these behaviours or how environmental factors, social norms, etc., could contribute to them. Still, it's also essential to remember how skewed our knowledge of Korean fans & society is & the role of language barriers in maintaining that disconnect.
10. **K-pop journalism (specifically news sites) is garbage &**¬†**needs to step up:**¬†this ties back to the previous point. The amount of poorly written articles & mishandling of¬†certain¬†topics is truly astounding & it's not just one site but nearly all of them. I've also seen people talk about how certain websites depict the Korean public, especially regarding certain controversies like the Seunghan situation. At this point, I'm questioning the credentials of these websites & their staff (I'm an ex-journalism student) because of how they report. How are publications that have nothing to do with¬†Kpop¬†doing a better job at reporting than the websites dedicated to the genre? These publications have a responsibility not just to report but to inform readers & be mindful about how they talk about specific topics (especially since Western media loves to exoticize Asia & make Asian countries appear weird/backward compared to ""the more civilized"" West).
11. **People/fans are way more self-centred than I¬†thought:**¬†This is probably the most significant ""lesson"" I learned this year. With everything¬†that happened¬†this year, you'd think people would become more compassionate, but that's not what happened. Whether it be fans manipulating narratives to fit their¬†fanwar-driven¬†perspectives, people who can't boycott companies that support genocide bc they ""can't live without"" their so-called coffee that's 90% sugar, people who voted for an orange bc they cared more about their gripes than the people in their lives who'll be affected or the people who began blaming people who couldn't even vote. Maybe I was a bit too optimistic¬†I¬†thought we were better than this. When did people start becoming so self-absorbed & disconnected from reality?¬†

The ‚ÄúAI Mode‚Äù tab will show up near the existing tabs like ‚ÄúAll,‚Äù ‚ÄúImages,‚Äù and ‚ÄúVideos.‚Äù So next time you search on Google, just look to the left-hand side. In AI Mode, you‚Äôll get more than just standard links. Google plans to serve up conversational answers powered by¬†[Gemini AI](https://gemini.google.com/?is_sa=1&is_sa=1&android-min-version=301356232&ios-min-version=322.0&campaign_id=bkws&utm_source=sem&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid-media&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=bkws&utm_campaign=2024enIN_gemfeb&pt=9008&mt=8&ct=p-growth-sem-bkws&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAyJS7BhBiEiwAyS9uNcpDb_gkNr5o14txQuHIEQ2zSE_gNo_r9zbUfLWN240xX7VdcNjuhBoCEKwQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds). But don‚Äôt worry; you‚Äôll also get helpful links to related webpages right below the AI-generated response.

# How AI Mode is Already Taking Shape

This isn‚Äôt just an experiment‚ÄîAI Mode is already being tested. Earlier this month, Android Authority discovered the feature in a beta version of the Google app. And 9to5Google found that you might even be able to use AI Mode to search with your voice or upload pictures for more visual searches. Imagine asking, ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù while pointing your camera at something, and AI Mode giving you an answer. It‚Äôs like having an AI-powered sidekick every time you search for on Google!

# Why Now? A Big Race in AI-Powered Search

This move makes sense‚ÄîGoogle‚Äôs rivals are stepping up their game too. ChatGPT, from OpenAI, now lets all users, including those on free plans, use its AI for searching the web. Microsoft‚Äôs Copilot and services like¬†[Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/)¬†and¬†[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)¬†are also pushing similar AI-powered search features.

To stay ahead, Google has already rolled out AI summaries in search results for some queries. For instance, if you‚Äôre trying to figure out ‚Äúhow to make glue for pizza sauce‚Äù (yes, that‚Äôs real), you might see an ‚ÄúAI Overview‚Äù at the top of your results. Now, AI Mode takes this even further by offering interactive, conversational answers‚Äîall without leaving Google.

# Why You Should Be Excited

This is more than just ‚ÄúGoogle with a twist.‚Äù Think of it as blending the simplicity of typing ‚Äúsearch for on Google‚Äù with the intelligent conversation of a chatbot like ChatGPT. With AI Mode, Google aims to make searching faster, smarter, and way more intuitive. It‚Äôs your ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù for everything from casual questions to in-depth research.

# AI Mode in Action: What It Means for You



* **Get Instant Insights:**¬†Ask complex questions like, ‚ÄúHow does this scientific theory work?‚Äù and receive easy-to-understand answers right on the Google search page.
* **Enjoy Seamless Interaction:**¬†Have a chat-like experience for those moments when ‚Äúyou are AI‚Äù just feels easier than clicking through dozens of links.
* **Search Smarter with Visuals:**¬†Use your voice or photos to get personalized and context-aware answers. No typing required!
* **Stay in the Loop:**¬†Track conversation history within your searches, making it easy to revisit important info whenever needed.

Google is betting big on this feature‚Äîand for good reason. By making Gemini AI accessible directly from the search results page, it could bring the best of both worlds: the familiarity of Google Search and the innovation of AI chatbots like ChatGPT.

# Final Thoughts

With ‚ÄúAI Mode‚Äù just around the corner, we‚Äôre stepping into a future where searching is smarter and more conversational than ever. Whether it‚Äôs about finding the nearest coffee shop, learning new skills, or solving complex problems, Google‚Äôs AI-powered upgrade is set to make things a whole lot easier.

So, keep an eye out for the new search-to-Google experience. When Google adds AI to its core search, it‚Äôs more than just a feature‚Äîit‚Äôs the start of a whole new search engine era. Are you ready to try it? We sure are!",1,1734965930.0,u_Green_Volume_2447,0,1.0,False

""What did you say it was, Prop... what?"" he asked, handing her a warm cup of coffee before sitting down beside her on the carpet under the dark, starry sky.

""Propamnesia,"" she replied. ""I can't recall faces.""

""So, you don't know what I look like?"" he sounded confused and rather hurt.

""No, I know your face, and I can recognize you in a crowd of a million people,"" she explained calmly, looking into his eyes. ""I just cannot imagine your face when I close my eyes.""

""So... you can never tell what I look like to the police if I get kidnapped?"" he asked a unique question.

""Well... first of all, I won't need to explain because I have tons of your selfies you took with my phone,"" she chuckled at the innocence of his question. ""But you still cannot explain my face or what I look like if you didn't have a picture of mine... can you?"" he insisted, with a sulky look on his face, fidgeting with his coffee cup.

""Right, I admit I won't be able to do that,"" she said, taking the empty cup from his hands calmly. ""I can't describe your facial features if I close my eyes right now, even though I was looking at you the whole time."" She admitted with a bittersweet smile, while holding his cold hand.

""Oh... then, I just need to stay in front of you the whole time,"" he made a silly face, poking her dimples that were playing hide and seek in her bittersweet smile.

""Right..."" Her laughter filled the room. ""That solution took you a minute,"" she teased him.

""So, what do you remember about people when you close your eyes?"" he asked another question, his curiosity lighting up his eyes, even under the dark skies.

""Umm... I don't know if it will make sense, but I see vibes of people and not their facial features,"" she replied.

""Vibes...? Like red, green, blue, or happy, sad, angry vibes?"" he asked, with a confused look.

""No, like their souls and ghosts around them,"" she said, pretending to scare him with a dark expression. ""Really?"" He looked concerned, glancing around. ""I meant... haha, you are so silly, I was just messing with you."" She tried to suppress the urge to tease him and continued. ""I see gazes and not eyes, smiles and not lips when I close my eyes. That's what I meant by vibes."" She paused, waiting to see a glimpse of understanding in his face. ""I see your silly expressions and not facial features, and what I felt when I saw them... all those memories come flooding like a nostalgia attack, but only emotions, vibes, and memories of those moments distilled into plain emotions. Do you get it now?"" she asked, with a playful look on her face, expecting another question.

""Yeah... I get it,"" he said gently, playing with both their rings, stacking them up like a tower. ""That means you never fell in love with my face."" He looked up suddenly, making another silly remark.

""Pffttt, how did you even infer that... from this?"" She laughed out loud at his assumption.

""I adore you, everything about you... from the way you hold a cup with your pinky sticking out... to the way you mess with your bangs, trying to fix them up, only to mess them up more,"" she said, messing his bangs with her fingers, looking determined to prove herself.

His eyes shone with subtle tears as he looked up and nodded at her words, feeling a sense of warmth even on a cold fall night. He could only see her, smiling brighter than the blanket of stars they were sitting under.

""Don't worry, I will always stay right here in front of you, to the point you get sick of me,"" he said, rubbing her cold hands to warm them up.

""Okay, mister hopeless romantic,"" she chuckled. ""Although I highly doubt I will get sick of it."" She smiled gently and shook her head, gazing lovingly at him, distracted by the fire dying down.

Last time I went to India I saw a few people and a friend of mine told me to go and see a priest of the village... after about 30 minutes drive we saw his house - painted completely white with a silver gate - surrounded by wide fields of farmlands and gardens.

As we entered we saw a brand new car parked inside the gate and a guy who was a helper greeted us and asked us to wait while he called the priest. I noticed that this place was spotless - we roamed around a little and saw that every room is polished and dusted and clean with white furniture. The floor is white marble.

The priest came and asked some general things about how life is going and all the rest. My friend always donates a large amount of money to this priest and they knew each other very well. So the priest said - ""Do you want some coffee?"" and I could not refuse. He went inside his kitchen and we saw once again how clean and organised it was and made the coffee by himself - while his helper did some other stuff. As he served the coffee he realised that we appreciated his place and how clean it is - he then read our mind and said that ""I have a helper, but I do the cleaning myself because I can't trust anyone else!""

The whole place had a very calm and peaceful vibration and I have never tasted coffee like that before ...

Later we went to the roof where they usually have the ceremonies - and I noticed that the 360 degree view of green fields all around was a sight to behold with the orange setting Sun.

And that is the result of a higher consciousness - the purer Satvik type - the one of the priest and the sage and the saint - that which makes life a little tolerable on earth. It flowed out to this guy's house - it shows how organised his being is - everything is clean on the inside and out! There is

My children came into the kitchen this morning with a serious look on their faces. I was standing by the counter, in my robe, making coffee. My wife was seated at the kitchen table, reading the paper.

The kids had been up for a while playing in my daughter‚Äôs room. It seems they had been discussing something.

The boy, age 8, had been appointed the spokesman. He is the more gullible and trusting of the two, and had been goaded to the conversation by his sister, age 7.

‚ÄúDad,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwe need to talk.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwe were talking about Santa Clause, and we have some problems with the whole thing. It doesn‚Äôt really make sense to us, and we want to know if it is true?‚Äù He went on to elaborate the traditional list of Yuletide improbabilities.

I set down my coffee on the counter. Considering my options carefully, I turned to face him full on. I looked him in the eye and said:

>‚ÄúIt is true. Your mother and I have been lying to you. And, you know how we feel about lying - we hate it. But this is something that adults everywhere have decided we need to lie about. You see, Santa - this idea of a fat jolly old man living with elves - is sweet and safe. The truth is much more strange and¬†bizarre.

>It started with an old¬†Buddhist¬†monk named Santu Ha, who lived several thousand years ago in the mountains which divide Mongolia from China. Like all Buddhist monks, Santu spent her life practicing the disciplines of non-attachment to material things and compassion for others.¬†

>Santu spent her winters sitting quietly and meditating ‚Äì hoping to achieve a state of being called ‚ÄòNirvana.‚Äô Nirvana is kind of like heaven or paradise, but it occurs when the person loses his or her individuality and becomes one with the universe. It is supposed to be the best thing ever, but it is kind of hard to explain.

>Anyway, when she was not meditating ‚Äì in the spring and summer especially - she would work very hard. She had a large field of gardens near her hermitage, and she tended them carefully in¬† order to grow huge numbers of fruits and vegetables. Then, when fall came, she would make the long, long trip down the mountains with her trusty Yak, Sabu. She would give away all that she had grown and made during the year to the villagers, leaving behind barely enough to get her through the winter.

>The villagers were always very¬†grateful, and they would offer her many gifts. But she had no need for things, so she encouraged the villagers to give the gifts to one another instead. After a few years her arrival became a great festival in the village of thanks and gift giving to one another. She enjoyed it each year, and when the festival was over, she would take Sabu‚Äôs lead, and head back into the mountains to start the cycle again.

>For a long while she was content living like this. But then one year, as she packed her vegetables to bring them down the mountain, she realized that she really was no closer to Nirvana. Santu thought to herself that perhaps since she had not given it \*all\* away - since she had saved some for¬†herself¬†- she was being selfish. So, when she and Sabu walked down the mountains, every bit of what she had was strapped to Sabu‚Äôs back. There was a great festival, and, of course, the villagers had no idea she had saved nothing for herself.

>At the end of the festival, she turned to Sabu and said ""I have a gift for you too, loyal servant. I give you your freedom.‚Äù And she took off Sabu‚Äôs halter and walked back into the mountains, without owning even one thing hereself. But, Sabu loved Santu Ha very much, and so even though he knew he was free, he followed her back into the hills. This made her happy, and she hugged him and rubbed his nose¬†occasionally¬†as they climbed higher and the winds grew.

>When they reached her cave and her farming field, she went inside, sat on a stone and began to mediate - watching the shadows play on the cave wall. Sabu wandered off snuffling the ground for the few remaining dry grasses he might eat.

>For many days, she sat in complete stillness meditating. Her body grew hungrier and hungrier, but there was no food, so she did not stir and break her concentration. Sabu snuffled outside the cave -¬†occasionally¬†he wandered to the spring on the far side of the field for water - and at night he blocked the entrance to the cave with his body to keep the coldest winds at bay.

>Sabu was concerned for Santu, but he would never disturb her while she was sitting in meditation. Still, her skin was turning¬†gray, and she looked frail and very ill.¬†After¬†some time, it was clear she was nearing death. For several weeks the only sound that came from the cave was the steady, slow breathing of the monk. After a while, even that sound became intermittent and more drawn out.

>Sabu was scared and sad. One day, he resolved to enter the cave. He looked carefully at her sitting figure, and was about to cross into the cave, when he heard a happy sound. The monk spoke.¬† She said: ‚ÄúAh! It is a forest! The shadows of the forest of the dreams of children!‚Äù

>She stood quickly ‚Äì not with the stiffness you would expect from someone who had sat still for a long time. She was smiling broadly and there was a tear in her eye. Most strangely, she seemed to be radiating a miraculous warm white light. Little sparkles jumped from her and lit the cave. She began to stride purposefully toward him, and she did not look ill at all.

>As she passed him, she reached one hand unconsciously and rubbed Sabu‚Äôs nose as she always did in greeting him. His nose sprung alive with delight and a deep warmth, and his breath turned to sparkles, like those that wreathed her. He was perplexed ‚Äì this had never happened before when she touched him!

>She walked past him briskly though. She was making her way toward the field - ‚Äúwater, must, thirsty, toward, be‚Äù Sabu thought in the way that a Yak does - which is not at all like you or me. But as he turned to follow, he saw that their field was now covered in a twinkling pine forest. ¬†

>Now, pine trees don‚Äôt grow in that part of the world, so even more than their sudden appearance, Sabu was scared because he simply did not know what they were. His newly awakened nose was filled with the scent of spruce - which, while pleasing, was scary because it was unknown to him.

>However, as he watched, she plunged in among the trees. And because he loved her more than himself, he quickly trotted in after her.  
The forest was dense and dark, but Sabu could see her trail by the sparkles that she had left on the trees that she passed. He followed that trail for hours, but he never seemed to catch up to¬† her. Then, finally, it¬†disappeared. And there, deep in the wood, he stood bewildered.

>After a while, Sabu began to snuffle around, snorting his sparkly breath into the pine boughs, hoping he could find scent of her.

>Now, what Sabu did not know - and will never understand - is that Santu Ha had glimpsed the edge of the world that exists beyond the space and time you and I can see. And he had followed¬†her into the¬†*Forest of the Dreams of Children*. There, the dreams of children ‚Äì things that are not now, but which might be someday ‚Äì take root and wait for the children (and those that trust and believe in them) to bring them into reality in our world.

>And, passing into the Forest of the Dreams of Children, she had given herself freely to it. Each of the sparkles that had jumped off of her was a little bit of her. Each of the trees was a dream¬† waiting to be a reality. And she had nourished each dream as she passed it, until the Forest had consumed all there was of her. And she had now found her Nirvana - because giving yourself¬† fully to nourish the dreams of children is one of the many paths by which to arrive there.

>There is not, of course, enough life in any one person to make all of the dreams of all of the children come true. (In fact, the children whose dreams she touched, long ago grew old and passed from this Earth.) And so the Forest still stands, and Sabu still wanders in it.

>However, she had also given a little bit of her pure self to Sabu ‚Äì through that final loving pat on the nose. And so as he still snuffles trees throughout the Forest, looking for her, he carries on her magic. His love for her combines¬†with her one pure compassionate touch to produce the magic sparkles in each of his breaths. And those sparkles nourish the dreams of children everywhere today!

>The final thing you need to know is that December 24th is the night of the year when the material world in which we live touches most closely with the forest beyond time where Sabu wanders. And, for what seems like only a few minutes here ‚Äì but what is a very, very, very long time over there, the worlds overlap. ¬†Sabu, ever vigilant, comes and tries to snuffle every pine tree he can find in our world while they are linked.

>The funny thing is, if you have a pine tree on which children have¬†focused¬†their dreams, Sabu‚Äôs breath can make just a few of them come true. So we grown-ups put up a pine tree, and we decorate it and light it so he is sure to find it. We encourage you to dream of presents by telling you the silly story of Santa and the elves - because, seriously, would you ever believe us if we told you a¬† magic yak could make presents appear from nowhere?‚Äú

My son looked at me stunned, thought for a moment and said: ‚Äúbut, but‚Ä¶ I have never seen any yak tracks in the house!‚Äù

>‚ÄúWell, if you leave a door open, Sabu will come in. But he‚Äôs not like Santa ‚Äì he doesn‚Äôt come down chimneys. And, frankly, I don‚Äôt think he is housetrained. It is another reason we don‚Äôt tell kids about it, you know. Wouldn‚Äôt you be a little weirded out by the idea that an other-worldly yak was wandering around the living room in the dark of night?

>Anyway, the good news is, if you put the tree by a window, he does not need to get in. The magic from his breath is strong enough that mostly he just comes up to the window, looks at the tree and snuffles. If it is cold enough, his breath might freeze on the window for a moment, but as the heat from the house evaporates it, gifts appear under the tree.‚Äù

Now, my children are used to the fact that I am the¬†consummate liar and always happy to make up a tall tale on the spot. But this was such a detailed fantasy that they were taken aback, and their mouths hung open.

Finally, the girl turned to my wife and asked the question ""Wait?! Is all that true?!‚Äù

The children trust my wife who always busts my stories with ‚ÄúNo, your dad is just being your dad again,‚Äù but this time she looked at me, looked at the kids, and said ‚ÄúEvery word of it dear. Now, what do you want for breakfast?‚Äù

I have been there 2 years my coworker 15 years. There are 3 full time guards and 2 part time. No supervisor so we all have the same job just a different shift. Last Christmas I noticed there were no gifts from residents for Guards to share. This is very unusual as residents normally drop off gift baskets, chocolates and tins of cookies.  I personally was handed a few boxes of chocolates which I left for staff to share. They disappeared. This year the same thing happened. I found out from the other guards that the afternoon shift guard takes everything home for himself.  EVERYTHING.   Five coffee gift cards left , 1 for each guard. Gone. Bottles of wine. Gone.  I have worked condo security for 10 years and I have never experienced anything like this.  I complained to HR and they will not do anything. They said the guard is long term and well liked. I politely confronted the guard and he just plays dumb.  There are no cameras in the gatehouse but there is one outside and in parking. We can see residents pull up and hand the guard gifts through the window and him bring them to his car a few hours later. This is a low wage . no benefits, boring job. Guards look forward to Christmas for treats and gift cards. Everyone on site is  in their 60ties. The thief is 74.  Nothing is off limits to this guy.  Bottles of wine from residents to the superintendents have disappeared. People just ignore it. . I opened 1 box of chocolates and shared them and he flipped out. He counted how many candies were gone. Oh and he does not celebrate Christmas . He is Jewish and gets personal gifts from our Jewish residents. Has anyone ever dealt with anything like this.

My (40m) and my wife (40f) had birthdays and our 15 year anniversary in the last few months.  Both her birthday and our anniversary came first, and I did what I could to make her day special. 

For her birthday, she woke up to a special breakfast with birthday candles and coffee. I bought her some of her favorite candy and a few different bottles of wine that she likes. I had Crumbl delivered to her entire office for their morning break, and that evening I arranged for the kids to stay with grandparents for the night while we had a nice dinner and surprised her with a few of her  friends joining for a night out after. Fun was had by all.  

For our anniversary, we went to a local winery and I bought her a nice watch. 

A few weeks later, out of the blue she told me that she wasn‚Äôt going to do anything for my 40th but she felt bad about it. I didn‚Äôt push much since I didn‚Äôt know if she was actually planning something or not because who says that? 

When my birthday came, she told me happy birthday but the morning went on like normal. Leading up to it, she asked if I wanted to do anything and I said going out for dinner or doing something with friends would be nice.  She mentioned that we didn‚Äôt need to do anything and we have been going out quite a lot lately -  I think we ate out 2-3 times in the last 6-8  weeks including the occasions mentioned above. I think she was attempting to not add stress to a busy schedule, but she mentioned it at least 4 or 5 times.  This basically ended up feeling like she didn‚Äôt want to do anything at all and going out was an inconvenience. 

After a relatively bad day at work she gave me a gift from her and the kids. It was 2 bars of chocolate, almonds, a pill organizer (i don‚Äôt take medication), a small box of chocolate covered cashews and a card - all inside of a reusable shopping bag. Not that I‚Äôm picky, but nothing was wrapped, in a gift bag, or anything special. It was in the same bag that we normally use to bring home groceries.   

After opening the gift we went to dinner at what I would call a nice food court + brewery with many local options. Since it was a weekday, other restaurants were closed, and I wanted plenty of options for picky kids.  Timing of the food wasn‚Äôt great.  It took a while to pay and in the meantime, the food came out.  By the time I got back to the table, everything was cold and they were pretty much done with their meal. 
 
I feel like she put the extreme minimal effort into this. There were plenty of opportunities to have a nice dinner with or without kids over the weekend. We also have an obscene amount of gift wrapping so it‚Äôs not like she needed to buy anything to make it seem a little more like a birthday gift instead of something she just brought home from the store.

I tried talking to her about how things seem unbalanced but she told me that if I wanted her to do something for my birthday, I should have told her - my fault I guess.  She also said she didn‚Äôt realize that we were doing anything for our birthdays, so she didn‚Äôt know anything was expected.  

Before and after, she has seemed completely normal. We typically don‚Äôt go crazy for birthdays or anniversaries, but I thought with our 40th and our 15 year anniversary, it would be a little more special.  We have had a great relationship, but this has made me feel completely unappreciated and dumped water on the spark that we had. I no longer have the urge to make her day special or go out of my way to do extra things for her.

1hkoyu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1hkoyu6/better_understanding_author_notes/,Better Understanding Author notes,"Hey guys,

I-uh. Don‚Äôt really know how to start this, I wanted to do a sort of how I developed the story, world building and the original ending for this thing. It definitely got out of hand. If you have any questions about the story, you can ask them and I'll answer to teh best of my ability.

Once again thank you to u/SpacePaladin15 for creating the NOP universe.

¬†

**Reading this isn‚Äôt necessary, it‚Äôll cover how I developed the story, and the changes made from the original and how they were changed.**

¬†

So, I think I‚Äôll start when I first came up with the idea. I was reading the few Krev fics on here like Krev and Trevor, human maid caf√© and love lessons. I became a little disgruntled that there weren‚Äôt many of them. (can you tell who my favourite species is?)

One day while I was working and a random thought occurred to me, if I were to write one of these what would the story be, I floated a few ideas in my head ranging from a business one, to an underground fight club. I knew I would never be able to match anyone in writing skill here, so I tried to come up with something more mundane or intriguing like world building. I put a few ideas through my Krev addled brain to see what would stick or how to do this.

And that was the start of me coming up with notes and writing them into a little notebook I had instead of putting them in a document cause I‚Äôm a little stupid.

Anyway, the ‚ÄòBetter Understanding‚Äô title wasn‚Äôt the original, it was actually ‚ÄòBetter Tomorrow‚Äô but I thought it was a little pretentious to use.

I‚Äôll write word for word what I wrote in my book 4 months ago about the stories premise and what would happen.

‚ÄúStory Ideas-

Exchange partner leaving and the other trying to find them again.

Information pertaining to the Krev gets out somehow from the exchange, they believe that they are in danger and tells the human, before the connection gets cut.

Human goes to find them, experiences the world. (world building)

The Krev gets threatened by others due to their jealousy. Corrupt police hold them for minor offense.

Human gets to the Krev‚Äôs house sometime later, Krev isn‚Äôt there, they start looking around town for them. i.e. Bars, hotels, inns, resorts, shops and finally the police station.

They find each other ‚Äì slice of life for a bit with travel mixed in ‚Äì experience the surrounding area/regions.‚Äù

And that was the whole planning for the story, I was thinking that I would come up with some concepts on the way, I literally had nothing planned out for world building for the worlding building fic. ( <-----Great thing right there wasn‚Äôt it.)

In my head I wanted the human that travelled to Avor move from town to town getting up to some shenanigans and meeting new people who he befriends along the way. They meet up with their Krev partner and they aren‚Äôt doing the best mentally and they help them by taking them on trips to experience the world with them. And that was as far as I got to an ending, I literally didn‚Äôt have anything wrote for an ending, but I think I had something to do with exposing the people that did this to him somehow.

So that was the premise of the story, and you can see that I was missing a few things from the final product, I ‚Äòll get to it. for now, though the only characters I had planned was Edward and Cruth.

Edward Hamilton: Age 27‚Äì Brawler type, confrontational, Mine worker and British Stoicism

Cruth: Age 22 ‚Äì Introverted, cautious, worried about dangerous things and consequences.

Cruth would eventually change and become more social through out the story and essentially becomes a brother to Edward.

I didn‚Äôt have anyone else planned out, not even the guy who would arrest Cruth. I had a few names and roles for those names to play but no real personality since I thought I would just wing it.

Exal ‚Äì Overseer for the Exchange program.

George ‚Äì mine receptionist.

Daniel Schmit ‚Äì Best friend.

Micheal ‚Äì Bartender.

Gary ‚Äì UN specialist.

Chern ‚Äì Alien Bartender.

Grusso ‚Äì Alien convenience store owner.

After this point I started to write the story.

It would start with Cruth contacting Edward getting to know each other while he tried holding back the cute reaction, Edward would be wearing a mask to hid that he had gotten into a fight originally, I didn‚Äôt think to hard about it, but it also hid the fact he was in the mine explosion. At this point I had no idea if Edward would have been in the mine or part of the rescue.

The story would progress to Cruth getting kicked out due to false allegations and Edward would go looking for him. I didn‚Äôt have Breeve planned at all, I was going to have him wandering Avor all alone moving from place to place. It was a comment by u/abrachoo that commented that he would need another partner for the culture exchange, and it got me thinking that I would do a character to see how that would turn out. And thus, Breeve was introduced.

Breeve: Age 25 ‚Äì Tour escort, knowledgeable.

Not a lot of detail because I was planning on Edward ditching her the moment he could citing that he would be faster on his own. Wrote a few chapters about it and sort like the dynamic of them, so I changed that so they would stick together. The rest of the story was just ‚Äúmake it up one the spot and roll with it.‚Äù

Like seriously, that was the furthest I had written into the note book the rest was just world building like I had planned, I had a few ideas in my head and a basic layout that changed again further on. (I‚Äôll list the world building stuff at the end.)

So Breeve and Edward get to Bulik and start looking for Cruth, Breeve and Edward would split up to look around town for Cruth. Edward would run into a few members of the syndicate such as Larens and Nerko instead of out on a walk. So, when they found Cruth I had written it that he would not be good at going anywhere for a bit and thought that I would do a slice of life before they would head to a major town to get a memory transcript to clear Cruth‚Äôs name. That was the ending I had planned, and the last chapter would have been Edward giving an interview about him taking about the people he met along his travels, how he felt knowing the Krev were obsessed with humans and what he thought the future would be like.

Instead, I had them meet Larens and Nerko.

Larens: age not written ‚Äì crime boss, can run an underground syndicate that Breeve‚Äôs father came to close to.

Nerko: age not written ‚Äì Enforcer for the syndicate, works for the police to lead them away from activities. (Told a friend about the story and he gave me the name for him.)

I got it in my head that Edward would be kidnapped but I wouldn‚Äôt write anything actually happening to him, it would be that Larens trusted him not to run of but he would. They would then leave town immediately and do the memory transcript and lead to the interview ending.

Instead, I had him get hurt and more or less retreat from the universe and now has a fear of Krev he doesn‚Äôt know.

Micheal was never intended to be going to Avor, he was supposed to be a bartender staying on Avor, I wanted to flesh him out a bit since he would be helping Edward, so I gave him a family and a short back story about how me met his wife and how his homelife was.

The ending to the story was almost down to a flip of a coin, I was thinking on how I would end it for literal days while I was working even. I had to consult a few people like SoldierLsnake and Julian skies to figure out what I wanted to do.

I‚Äôm glad I listened to them and had the hopeful ending.

Anyway, you can probably see that the original; premise was far different from the final product.

World building. ‚Äì

Regions that I listed where ‚Äì

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Sivren ‚Äì The region that most towns and rural areas were located due to the Krev government wanting to keep some natural beauty.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Kirn ‚Äì I never mentioned it since I had no way of adding it. I had a plan for this region being a major player in space travel, being the first to get to space and then becoming a major manufacturing hub for ships and new research and technologies.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Bartar ‚Äì As the name implies the city state of Bartar had expanded enough to encompass and entire region like a mega city.

Towns and cities

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Bulik ‚Äì It is the home of Cruth, the town was surrounded by forests and mountains. The town was original a mining town looking for precious metals‚Äô underneath Magriv (Mountain overlooking the town.) It was abandoned when the metals ran out until the unified Krev government decided to resettle it. The Krev consortium heavily regulated the town‚Äôs growth so it didn‚Äôt develop into a city or larger settlement ruining the forests near it.

¬†

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Saphern ‚Äì Is the hometown of Breeve, It‚Äôs located on the boarder of Bartar and Sivren. It‚Äôs a small town far from the city of Bartar out in the countryside with rolling fields and rills for as far as the eye could see. It was an outpost for one of the empires before the creation of Bartar as a town, it was meant to look out for raiders or a jumping off point for expeditions into uncharted territories.

¬†

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Winthome ‚Äì It was a major settlement on the orbital rings surrounding Avor, it was built on the most inner ring with a station and trains constantly running to ferry people to and from. It didn‚Äôt have an elevator to the surface, but it was proposed that it should have one considering its size.

¬†

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Bartar ‚Äì Bartar was one of the largest cities on Avor. When it was made it was under the control of an empire back in medieval days, that empire faded into collapse due to poor management and the empire collapsed leaving the towns and villages with out rule. Bartar was a small trading hub which capitalised on its trade routes and formed a small state. The other town and villages formed small empires and warred with each other over territories. Bartar traded goods, information and people growing its connections to these empires and effectively creating a buffer state around it until absorbing them into a republic and outlawing the trade of people but kept encroaching on their neighbours‚Äô territories. They came into contact with the Pervan empire and co-opted their story of needing a tithe to protect nations from a non ‚Äì existent threat to solidify power.

And that about does it for what I have wrote here in my little book of madness. Except for the first thing I wrote down 4 months ago.

‚ÄúIf we are going to do this we are going to need dates of when things transpire and how. i.e. Krev Exchange, mine explosion, agreement with negotiator‚Äù

Looking back on it, I was way unprepared for anything I wrote, and I‚Äôm honestly surprised that I was able to make it past chapter 5 let along 30. I think it has to do with you guys reading it, seeing comments and seeing that people actually liked what I had wrote made me feel great and to keep going with it. I can safely say that I accomplished what I wanted to do, I never missed a post day, and I kept a good rate of getting chapters out since I thought that if I stopped that I would lose focus on it.

I just wanted to say that.

Thank you for everything, it had been a fun time talking and theorising with you guys.

I‚Äôll stop rambling now and probably go back and check this thing for grammar, that was another thing, the first 3 chapters I never went back and checked if they made any sense or not. I‚Äôm amazed that it was barley legible.

Again, Thank you.

P.S. And Paladin if you ever read this, cheers mate. You made a great story and a community surrounding it that has taken up the better part of 2 years of my life reading the stories on here.

Thank you.

Yesterday, Sunday December 22, 2024, a buddy and I got together to install lowering springs and 20mm hub centric spacers on the 2022 WRX GT in below freezing temperatures due to lack of garage access in NJ.  We started working on the car at 3:30pm EST and finished around 12am EST next day, due to several breaks and much needed warmup sessions. Man, hot coffee is a godsend!

Let me begin by saying, I initially thought this project would take us 3 hours max, boy was I wrong. The first wheel, FR, took us quite a bit just figuring out how to safely go about disconnecting the active damping system from the strut/wheel-hub assembly. All online installation video references were based on the Manual trim without active damping system. We even lost a 14mm shallow socket in the engine bay disconnecting the strut tower; it was so cold I lost grip on it :D. Once we got the strut out from the wheel well, we spent a bit of time lining up the new spring on the strut, removing and repositioning several times to get it right. Reinstall was pretty straight forward, but had to spend a little while researching the torque specs and what have you. The front left went much smoother as a result although we had already lost sunlight by 5pm.

Moving to the rear of the car, it was already dark out and the air was even more frigid. The rear was a much simpler job for certain, but again, there was a small amount of time consumed figuring out the removal and install procedure. After about 3 hours, we had the back wheels mounted.

Once we dropped the car onto the ground, we saw a noticeable drop on the left side of the car, whereas the right side seemed to need assistance dropping a bit. We rolled the car around the neighborhood for a few miles and once we parked it back home, the drop set in. We cleaned up the site and parted ways.

I woke up this morning and felt like a kid on Christmas morning. I went outside and was super satisfied with the look of the car. I took pictures for you all to see. The wheels fit much better in the wheel-wells now. 10/10

All in all, I recommend everyone grab a buddy, use a true 4 point lift, delegate at least 8 hours, and stay warm doing this kind of installation. I really love this car!

1hkoovb,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/1hkoovb/the_case_for_bandersnatch_the_end_of_a_beginning/,The Case for Bandersnatch: The End of a Beginning,"For Context :

I‚Äôve been on a years-long journey filled with countless insights and discoveries. Along the way, I‚Äôve navigated a maze of existential possibilities‚Äîeach path converging to bring me to this platform, at this very moment. 

When I first encountered Bandersnatch, I was deep into my Master‚Äôs Degree in Business (a surprising contrast, perhaps, to the hacker/coder persona that emerges in my meta-cinematic crossover theories). Immersing myself in this new wave of Choose Your Own Adventure storytelling‚Äîsomething that shaped my childhood in the early 2000s, much like it did for Charlie Brooker and Stefan‚ÄîI realized I had nosedived into a life so unrecognizable that even if Death‚Äôs ghost had tried to steer me back on Christmas Eve, I‚Äôd have laughed and jumped through the window of my own Black Mirror episode.

As I began sharing my thoughts and‚Äîfor the first time‚Äîreceiving praise, Bandersnatch, like a minotaur lurking at the heart of my personal labyrinth, resurfaced. It called me to revisit the adventure I had abandoned six years ago. Now, it urges me to make it the centerpiece of the Self-Aware-Meta-Narrative-Puzzle theories I‚Äôve been unraveling (primarily through The OA, another Netflix enigma), as I uncover striking parallels between Stefan‚Äôs story and my own.

With Bandersnatch having been thoroughly dissected by the brilliant Black Mirror fanbase over the past six years, I won‚Äôt dwell on surface-level analysis. Instead, I want to explore what Bandersnatch signifies spiritually, beyond its mechanics. If I‚Äôve learned anything from this journey, it‚Äôs that in an era obsessed with speed and instant gratification, storytellers delight in feeding us red herrings‚Äîforcing us to look deeper and try again until exhaustion.


Things to Consider :

To truly complete Bandersnatch, three key objectives must be achieved:

1. Stefan Must Finish Developing the Game

At its core, Bandersnatch revolves around Stefan‚Äôs obsession with completing his game. This objective mirrors the player‚Äôs compulsion to pursue all possible paths, reinforcing the meta-narrative that Bandersnatch itself is a product of endless tinkering and recursion. Guiding Stefan toward completion forces us to confront the psychological toll of creative obsession and the existential dread that comes with realizing the goalpost continually shifts. Stefan‚Äôs descent highlights how the pursuit of perfection can become its own prison, reflecting not just his unraveling but our own fixation on finding the ‚Äúright‚Äù path.

2. Bandersnatch Must Receive a Perfect 5/5 Rating

The elusive 5/5 rating symbolizes the illusion of success and how external validation often drives creative endeavors. Stefan‚Äôs desperate need for acclaim reflects the audience‚Äôs desire for closure and narrative ‚Äúreward.‚Äù However, reaching this perfect score often at great personal cost for Stefan‚Äîunderscoring the idea that achieving perceived success may lead only to his emotional and psychological collapse. This objective forces us to question whether ‚Äúwinning‚Äù is truly desirable, or if the very act of chasing perfection is the trap that locks Stefan‚Äîand by extension, the player‚Äîin the loop.

3. The PACS Storyline Must Be Fully Explored

The PACS subplot represents the undercurrent of paranoia and surveillance culture, transforming Stefan‚Äôs personal journey into a broader commentary on the invisible forces that shape our decisions. PACS is the most explicit manifestation of control within the narrative, suggesting that Stefan‚Äôs actions‚Äîand ours‚Äîare predetermined by unseen hands. Fully exploring this path exposes the machinery behind the illusion of choice, forcing us to confront the uncomfortable reality that Stefan‚Äôs fate is largely out of his (or our) control.

By addressing these objectives, Bandersnatch transcends being just a branching narrative and evolves into a reflective experience that probes at the very foundations of interactive storytelling. Each path loops back into the question: are we players, or are we simply fulfilling the roles designed for us by forces we cannot see?




The Bandersnatch We Play Is Actually Colin‚Äôs NohzDyve :

If there‚Äôs one character who defines Bandersnatch, it‚Äôs Colin Ritman (played by Will Poulter). Mysterious, self-aware, and eccentric, Colin unlocks Stefan‚Äôs imagination‚Äîguiding him (and us) toward the unsettling realization that reality is more malleable than we think. Introduced as THE Colin Ritman by Stefan‚Äôs father and psychiatrist, Colin‚Äôs legend precedes him. His path isn‚Äôt optional; it‚Äôs inevitable, woven into the fabric of every critical fork in the narrative.

Colin dispenses knowledge whether Stefan‚Äîor the player‚Äîasks for it or not. His cryptic monologues blur the line between fiction and reality, pulling us deeper into the game‚Äôs recursive structure. With his awareness of time loops and fragmented memories, Colin is more than a side character‚Äîhe is the architect of descent, a figure who exists outside the linear flow of Stefan‚Äôs experience.

But here‚Äôs the twist‚ÄîBandersnatch isn‚Äôt the game we play. It‚Äôs the game Stefan is obsessed with finishing. The true game‚Äîthe one that ensnares us‚Äîis NohzDyve.

Bandersnatch is the end goal, but NohzDyve is the vehicle‚Äîthe plunge into Stefan‚Äôs mind, mirroring his unraveling. It is Colin‚Äôs game that draws us deeper, forcing us to fall repeatedly into infinite possibilities, just as Stefan spirals endlessly toward his doomed creation.

The fact that NohzDyve existed as a playable Easter egg outside of Bandersnatch reinforces this duality. While Stefan chases perfection in his project, we are locked in NohzDyve‚Äînavigating chaos, forced to dive until we learn to master the fall.


Complicity in the Loop: Pearl, Stefan, and Me

From the moment I press play, I become entangled in Stefan‚Äôs suffering. Each decision I make nudges him closer to madness, and the control I believe I wield begins to feel eerily similar to the grip PACS holds over him. It forces me to question‚Äîam I guiding the story, or am I simply another cog in Netflix‚Äôs machine?

I‚Äôve often felt compelled to help Stefan‚Äîto break through the screen and somehow reveal the truth of his condition. But every attempt leads to the same realization: I cannot reach him. What begins as a novel idea‚Äîcommunicating with a character trapped in fiction‚Äîbecomes deeply unsettling. The prospect of shattering Stefan‚Äôs fragile perception of reality mirrors the discomfort of recognizing that even if I could enlighten him, I would remain powerless to save him from the nightmare he inhabits.

This isn‚Äôt the path to freedom. The ‚Äúleap through the window‚Äù ending‚Äîreminiscent of The OA‚Äôs House on Nob Hill‚Äîproves that. In our pursuit of escape, we sacrifice Max, the actor, for a Stefan who emerges no closer to salvation. The narrative resets, but the underlying anguish persists.

Pearl Ritman‚Äôs post-credit coding scene drives this point further. Bandersnatch doesn‚Äôt conclude with Stefan; it lingers and bleeds into Pearl‚Äôs reality, as she picks up his work and carries it forward‚Äîjust as I return to the game six years later. Pearl inherits Stefan‚Äôs obsession, much like I inherit his fixation to tie loose ends after adding the P.A.C.S. storyline, which emerged with or without Collin.

It feels intentional‚Äîlike Bandersnatch is aware of my presence, quietly inviting me to continue the cycle. Perhaps this is the role I‚Äôve been given‚Äîthe privilege of closing the loop as I prepare to release my own Bandersnatch-like maze into the world.


Final Reflection: Closing the Loop and Opening the Gates

As Pearl sits at her computer, coding relentlessly, I see myself in her. The cursor blinks, indifferent to the endless loop of her reality‚Äîjust as mine flickers on the screen as I write this. We return to Bandersnatch not because we can‚Äôt leave, but because stopping feels like abandonment‚Äîleaving the puzzle unsolved, the code incomplete.

But maybe Bandersnatch isn‚Äôt meant to be escaped. Maybe the loop isn‚Äôt a trap at all. It‚Äôs a lesson concealed within the game‚Äîbound by cosmic limitations Colin hints at, waiting for someone in the audience to break them. To do so, that person must step forward and become the protagonist of their own Choose Your Own Adventure, hoping those who follow will hold as much empathy for them as we do for Stefan.

The Royal Game by Stefan Zweig lingers in my thoughts as I retrace the winding path that brought me here‚Äîa haunting parallel to Stefan Butler‚Äôs spiral. In Zweig‚Äôs novella, a prisoner plays endless mental chess against himself. What begins as refuge slowly turns to torment. With each move, the lines blur‚Äîthere is no opponent, only the mind consuming itself.

I think of Stefan, caught in recursion, and Zweig‚Äôs prisoner trapped within his own game. I realize I‚Äôm no different. Every restart feels like another move in a match I didn‚Äôt realize I was playing‚Äîagainst Netflix‚Äôs algorithm or the shadows of my own obsession. This is my move: The King‚Äôs Gambit.

Then Colin‚Äôs voice breaks through:
""There‚Äôs no right path. You just have to feel it out as you go.""

Colin, the ghost in Bandersnatch‚Äôs machine, feels like a transcended version of Zweig‚Äôs prisoner‚Äîboth aware of the fragility of perception and the peril of chasing a ‚Äúperfect game.‚Äù But while Zweig‚Äôs character fractures under obsession, Colin embraces the fall. He lingers as a guide, drifting between dimensions and gathering fragments of data as we play.

Maybe that‚Äôs why Bandersnatch called me back after six years. Like Pearl, I sit at the edge of unfinished work. But this time, the loop doesn‚Äôt feel like confinement‚Äîit feels like possibility.

Unlike Pearl, I won‚Äôt destroy the machine (though my Mac has probably survived more coffee spills than it should). I press forward, nudged by the faint whisper of a friend from the future‚Äîmost likely myself.

I hit Submit, knowing that by sharing this, I‚Äôm not closing the loop‚ÄîI‚Äôm expanding it.

As Matilda once recalibrated Zoolander‚Äôs words:
""You mean, if you pull the thread... the whole thing unravels?""

Maybe unraveling isn‚Äôt failure.
Maybe it‚Äôs how we finally see the bigger picture.

Yours truly,

T-Rex

I‚Äôm writing this guide while sipping on my overly sweetened coffee and dodging my ever-growing list of tasks. So, if you spot any typos or questionable grammar, just blame the caffeine overdose.

I‚Äôve noticed a lot of posts from people wanting to dive into API testing‚Äîwhether they‚Äôre fresh to QA or transitioning from manual testing. So, I decided to put together a beginner-friendly guide with practical tips and a pinch of real-world advice. Let‚Äôs jump in!

\-------------About Me (So You Know Who‚Äôs Rambling Here)-------------

I‚Äôm a QA Engineer with a passion for breaking things (intentionally) and making systems more robust. I started my career stumbling through UI tests before realizing that APIs are where the real action happens. Now, I spend my days writing, debugging, and optimizing API test suites.

Why API Testing? Because it‚Äôs the backbone of modern software. Also, UI tests are like divas‚Äîbeautiful but extremely high-maintenance.

\----------------------------------------------------What is API Testing?----------------------------------------------------

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the bridges that allow different software systems to communicate. Testing them ensures data flows correctly, security isn‚Äôt compromised, and everything behaves as expected.

Why is it important?

* Faster execution compared to UI tests
* Direct validation of core functionalities
* Better stability and fewer false positives

\----------------------------------------------------Getting Started with API Testing----------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Understand the Basics Before jumping into tools, you need to understand some key concepts:

* HTTP Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
* Status Codes: 200 (OK), 400 (Bad Request), 500 (Internal Server Error)
* Headers and Authorization: API keys, tokens
* JSON and XML: Common data formats

Step 2: Learn a Tool Pick one API testing tool and stick with it until you‚Äôre comfortable:

* **Postman** (Beginner-friendly, GUI-based, widely used)
* **Rest Assured** (Java-based, great for automation)
* **Supertest** (For Node.js lovers)
* **SoapUI** (For SOAP APIs, if you‚Äôre feeling retro)

Pro Tip: Start with Postman. Its GUI makes it super easy to understand how APIs work.

Step 3: Write Your First Test Here‚Äôs a simple example of an API test:

1. Send a GET request to an endpoint.
2. Validate the status code (e.g., 200).
3. Verify the response body contains the expected data.

Example in Postman:

    Request: GET 
    Expected Response:
    {
      ""id"": 1,
      ""name"": ""John Doe""
    }https://api.example.com/users

Step 4: Automate API Tests Once you understand the basics, move on to writing automated scripts using tools like **Rest Assured** (Java) or **Requests** (Python).

Python Example:

    import requests
    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/users')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()['name'] == 'John Doe'

\----------------------------------------------------Best Practices for API Testing----------------------------------------------------

1. Always Validate Responses: Status code, response time, and data integrity.
2. Use Assertions: Ensure test scripts validate expected outcomes.
3. Organize Tests: Group API tests logically (e.g., user APIs, order APIs).
4. Handle Edge Cases: Test invalid inputs, empty fields, and authorization failures.
5. Mock Responses: Use tools like **WireMock** to simulate API responses.

\----------------------------------------------------Going Advanced: API Test Automation Frameworks----------------------------------------------------

If you‚Äôre ready to level up, start exploring:

* **PyTest** with **Requests** (Python)
* **Rest Assured** (Java)
* **Supertest** (Node.js)

Learn CI/CD pipelines to integrate your API tests into build processes (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions).

\----------------------------------------------------Final Tips and Closure----------------------------------------------------

* Documentation is your best friend. Always read the API docs thoroughly.
* Learn about security testing (e.g., OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities).
* APIs are not just about testing responses; focus on performance too (try **JMeter** or **k6**).
* If you get stuck, ask questions, but do your homework first.

And most importantly, have fun breaking (and fixing) things. Happy testing!

So hear me out, cause I‚Äôm not in the mood to be in the office all day today‚Ä¶ we could‚Äôve had it off :( 

Wanna spend the holiday together, I mean virtually that is, cause I highly doubt anyone is from the golden state, or even close enough to wave hello in person! lol 

Any how! Wanna be my Xmas date? I suppose! I mean, aside from a few gifts üéÅ from my colleagues at the office, Santa hasn‚Äôt come through for me yet! What about you? Haha. 

Tell you what, let‚Äôs just chat a while, and see what happens, but I‚Äôm telling you right now; I‚Äôm 100% chill, humble, enthusiastic, try to keep optimistic, love my Italian coffee, humor and gratitude are life lol. Super attracted to intelligence, wit, good humor as well, and would love to get to know you! üòÜ 

Cheers and if I don‚Äôt catch you before the big day;

1hkolop,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1hkolop/start_with_gratitude/,Start with gratitude ,"Gratitude isn't something reserved for the big wins in life‚Äîthe promotions, the milestones, the extraordinary moments. Gratitude isn‚Äôt just about celebrating the highlight reel. It‚Äôs about finding magic in the mundane.

Life has a funny way of throwing curveballs. Some days, it feels like we‚Äôre in the middle of a storm we didn‚Äôt ask for. In those moments, the last thing we want to do is say ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù But that‚Äôs exactly when we need gratitude the most.

Gratitude doesn‚Äôt erase the hard stuff; it shifts our focus. It‚Äôs like a compass, pointing us toward the little glimmers of light we often overlook: the way the sun feels on your skin, the laughter in a stranger‚Äôs smile, or the fact that even on your toughest day, you‚Äôve made it through 100% of your worst moments so far.

Starting with gratitude isn‚Äôt about ignoring pain or pretending life is perfect. It‚Äôs about saying, ‚ÄúEven here, in this mess, there‚Äôs something good.‚Äù And when you start looking for the good, you find more of it. It grows.

Today, I challenge you to pause for just 30 seconds and name three things you‚Äôre grateful for‚Äîno matter how small. Maybe it‚Äôs the way your morning coffee tasted, the sound of rain on the window, or the simple fact that you‚Äôre here, reading this, still trying.

Gratitude is like planting seeds. Some days, it feels like nothing is happening. But one day, you‚Äôll look back and realize you‚Äôve grown a garden.

Start small. Start now. Start with gratitude.

What‚Äôs one thing you‚Äôre grateful for today? Let‚Äôs share and grow together. üå±
