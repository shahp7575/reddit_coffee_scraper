* Luke Murphy’s Attic Projects brings four-time Irish Times Theatre Award winner Volcano to ADF this summer. In a liminal space, a living room in disrepair, a room without a door, two exasperated characters recreate the greatest hits of old lives: a night at a rave, a favorite game show, an 80s music video, passing the time or quietly clinging to distant memories of a life out of reach. As the narrative unfolds the deeper precarity of their circumstances comes to focus leading the audience through a fever dream of questions and upended assumptions. Presented across four, forty-five-minute episodes, Volcano blurs the lines of experimental theater, contemporary dance, and a sci-fi thriller in live performance made for the Netflix era.

So when I’m with him, we always stop and get coffees because it’s my favorite coffee place! We always get iced carmelizers with soft top.

The last few times, they’ve tasted like the coffee is burnt? It makes me really sad because I quit bothering with Starbucks because of the same thing (plus inconsistency) and I’m going to be really upset if I have to quit on Dutch too 😭

Has something changed? Is it possibly an issue with that particular stand? I haven’t complained about it yet, we usually don’t take a drink until we’ve already left cause we mix the soft top in good first, and I feel bad going back and complaining.

But it taught me more than just project management principles. It taught me resilience, discipline, and the importance of faith, support, and mindset.

Here’s how it unfolded:

**1st Attempt (March 2025)**  
I took my first attempt during the last 10 days of Ramadan. Between fasting, late-night prayers, and poor sleep, I was mentally and physically drained. I hadn’t done many practice questions, didn’t watch any mindset videos, and was focused only on memorizing theory. Not surprisingly, I passed only the *Process* domain. 

**2nd Attempt (May 2025)**  
April slipped by in a fog of disappointment. I was demotivated after the first failure and didn’t study. On top of that, I was preparing for my parents' arrival from overseas - cleaning, furniture shopping, working long hours. I only began studying again in May, but even then, guilt weighed on me. My parents were home, alone, waiting to spend time with us. I was juggling full-time work, family obligations, and 2 hours of study each evening.

I did improve. I watched mindset videos, practiced Study Hall questions, and managed to pass *People* and *Business Environment*. But I scored below target in *Process*. Worse, the night before my exam, there was a family emergency that left me sleep deprived and anxious. I went into the exam distracted and emotionally exhausted, and it showed. I failed again.

After that, I gave myself a week to reset. I wasn’t ready to give up. Too much was riding on this. My wife was hoping I’d earn the credential soon so we could move toward a better future. I couldn’t let her down - or myself.

**3rd Attempt (June 2025)**  
This time, I approached things differently. I prioritized sleep, reviewed my weak areas, and prayed sincerely. 

I studied hard for two weeks leading up to the exam. No new material — just reinforced what I already knew and kept my focus on mindset. I got 8 hours of sleep the night before. During the test, it still got tiring toward the end, but I powered through. Coffee Crisp and water helped!

I’m proud to say I’m now a PMP®.

To those still studying: failure doesn’t define you — consistency and courage do. Keep pushing. Take care of your mental, physical, and spiritual health. Ask for help. And don’t give up when it gets hard.",1,1751292574.0,pmp,0,1.0,False

Reading helps me deal with the boring chores of my day . It puts a spring in my step, a smile on my face. It brightens my eyes and leaves a longing in my soul for something more .

1lo8fd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo8fd8/is_this_normal/,Is this normal?,"Over the course of my (28F) relationship of almost 4 years with my ex (28M) I have emotionally checked out. There were some red flags I kept ignoring because he was always a bit ""weird"" as people described him and I was convinced he is a bit autistic, or at least an introvert or something neurodivergent idk. 

Anyway, a few months prior to our breakup I started avoiding intimacy and wasnt excited about going out together or anything anymore. This made me feel incredibly guilty, especially since I couldnt wrap my mind around the fact that I cant even try anymore to feel something. Especially since it was time to plan our housing, we got steady jobs finally and potentially marriage and kids and so on.... 

I talked with him about how I feel. He dismissed it at first, then I said I should at least get my mind clear and I started going to therapy praying my therapist would just say Im afraid of conmitment or that I am anxious and anxiety is spilling all over my relationship and potential changes. Ofc, the therapist said nothing. Then I wanted to seperate, move out. He still didnt believe me until the day I said I have found a new place to stay, and then he wanted to talk about all of it, he listened to me and wanted me to stay, to give it one more try.

I explained, honestly, that I have lost feelings and its been bothering me for quite some time. And I was hoping therapy would help me find out the reason for that. I told him Im usually anxious, so it could be just fear of changes or it could be that I hold some resentment because of how rude he was to some of my friends and sister and how we never really resolve our fights because of his pettiness.
Whatever the reason, I couldnt bring myself to feel again and that we shouldnt stay together since it would just be wasting even more time. He should find someone who wont overthink the whole relationship for so long like I did.

He thinks he is not a petty person and that I love him, that Im just scared of commitment. He started saying that to all our friends when I moved out and when some of them wouldnt agree, he would insult them.We broke up with me saying I dont love him anymore and him saying Im wrong and that he knows me better than I do myself, and its all just anxiety, that he would like to be friends and also smthng like a therapist to me whenever I want. I cut off contact because it was all overwhelming all of a sudden but a week after he contacted me as a friend and asked for cup of coffee, when I refused, he told me I should just block his number since I have no intention of hanging out or talking. I refused because I thought he is just saying that out of spite and because he is hurting, but he insisted saying it would make things easier for him. So I blocked him. 

He started hanging out w our friends more and telling everyone how Im a coward and so on, started drinking, took a sick leave on his work for some time. He started having some heated arguments w friends who refused to find out for him how im doing and it got to a point where those friends came to me to cry about how he treated them when they were just trying to be there for him. Somehow, he also hacked my socials and found my diary from 5 years ago and my old photos and was spewing shit about me to everyone and making a case about who I actually am and how we r meant to be while also hating on me on some other occasions etc. Some friends advised to get the restraining order or smthng, but I convinced them thats just how he deals with stuff that he is not dangerous.

Now, I know he is hurting. I was his first long term relationship, he was and prolly still is - grieving. But.. Isnt all this behaviour just confirming that his red flags werent just him being inherently weird OR is it normal to behave like this when youre hurting too much? Im different and I cant understand this kind of behaviour, my sadness and my anger usually look aaalot different, im at my worst just self destructive, not an asshole. But I did hear about people having a horrible time doing horrible things after breakups and then after some time and healing, being completely different people. 

Its been a year since then, I bumped into him recently and he still gives that vibe like he is going to smash some walls any second or burn the whole town. 

He loved me and I couldnt love him back and I couldnt accept him the way he is. The more I learned about him, the less I felt. I would never want to have kids w him and would never trust him to not snap in front of our kids and I honestly think he is immature. But he NEVER treated ME the way he treated our friends and my sister. 

Im still failing to understand how he could be so golden to me and yet so snappy with others. After the breakup, the hell just broke loose.

 Is this his real self or is he just grieveing???
Is he just immature and will change or is he just an asshole?? Does he have mental issues or just bad at coping w emotions??? 

Its been really hard for me to tell which is which and the thought I ruined a good soul and stunted someones emotional growth is eating me inside. I feel the need to one more time try to tell him I do not love him and he should just let it go and stop torturing himself and everyone around him. He couldnt listen before cause he was hurting, but he would understand now?? Friends tell me not to contact him in any way. 

I think theyre right. But Im so anxious to the thought I might bump into him again and he just snaps at me or that he is gonna talk shit to some of my collegues as well just to get my attention. 

I would be at peace if I knew he is not going to come back at me somehow or do something insanely stupid or dangerous. 

Please, advice.

My last thought before I fell asleep at night was ‘oh goodie, I get to have coffee soon’. I’d have a cup or two with breakfast and maybe an iced coffee in the afternoon. Now, almost a month on Tirz I might have half a cup in the morning…and I miss it! I don’t miss it like crave it, but I miss the ritual of it. I miss thinking about myself as a coffee person. 
All this to say, the craving/addiction impact that GLP1s offer is probably the most fascinating thing to me about this journey.

1. Bruneians LOVE sweet stuff

Spanish Latte, Matcha Strawberry, Peach Tea, etc…I’d argue that these 3 drinks contribute to 20-40% of obesity in Brunei cuz it AMAZES me how many people ask for them…

Don’t blame the national obesity problem to the amount of cafes popping up when the USER is unable to control their own diet…

2. Bruneian LOVE free stuff

Was involved in the recent Consumer Fair event, the amount of people who was claiming free stuff is ABSURD. Just accept the free drink as it is, these people have the AUDACITY to haggle for an upgraded drink instead…wow

3. Parents needed to be educated more

Just because it’s free, doesn’t mean it’s okay. Don’t feed your 5-9 year old kids coffee or matcha please.

1lo8901,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealStories/comments/1lo8901/araceli_2/,Araceli 2,"Let's continue this story with Araceli and I.  She left for Kentucky but all that weekend she was in Pennsylvania. We were doing our normal daily things just chatting and I asked her to call me but she didn't. I wasn't thinking nothing of it, thinking she was busy with work or getting to make new friends. Then one Sunday, she finally told me that she was in Pennsylvania and she arrived on Saturday. I was thinking ""wait, what?"" I asked her why she didn't tell me and I thought you were in Kentucky. I thought she didn't want to see me or was hiding something. She said she was at a sex club hanging out with friends. I actually didn't mind that she was at that place because we're just friends. I was a little upset that she didn't tell me till a day after. I was pretty annoyed with that but I go over it and we continue to learn about each other. We video chat the next morning and she said her throat was getting sore, but we continue talking though out the day. I'm not sure how it got started but she was talking about the difference between making love and sex. She said making love is when you have sex with someone that you have feelings with and sex is just two people using each other. I asked her if and another woman took me home, have sex with me and wants to start a relationship with me, would you be okay with that? She didn't say much but shake her head like that was a no. She got sick over night with her sore throat, she call me that morning. I could tell she wasn't herself as she try to chat with me. Her roommate Joe give her some medicine and we made plans to hang out that next day. On that day, I asked her how she was feeling, her words was ""I feel like death."" I should had canceled our hang out but I really wanted to see her. I pick her up at the church parking lot because Joe doesn't want me to just pick her up at her house. She told me that she had to be back in an hour because her ex-wife was picking up the rest of her things and Joe will be gone. I told her why you have to be dealing with all of that, you're not getting the divorce. She didn't say anything but because she was living there rent free. I could tell that she wasn't feeling good so I just drive her to the store to get medicine and took her back. I don't know why but I asked her if she wanted to hang out more after his ex- wife pick up all her stuff. She agreed even if she was sick, I think we both just want to see each other because it been awhile. I waited a few hours and she messaged me that I can come pick her up. I arrived at the driveway because Joe was gone, she was sleeping while she was waiting for me. She got in the car and said she was hungry, I took her to a restaurant so we can have some lunch. We ordered and sit there and chatted away while waiting for our meal. She was telling me about the sex club as she been going on and off for years. I was interested in listening to this because I haven't been anywhere with that culture. I told her that she should take me there one night so I can experience that environment. We eat our meal as we talk about different things. 
We left the restaurant as she got in the car not looking very well, I should had took her home. But we decided to go to the park, she was surprised how good it looked, it had a public pool, trail walk. I park the car on the side and we got out. We took a little walk around the pond, there was turtles, lot of fishes. Though out our walk she started to breath heavily, we walk to a beach so she can rest and take a breath. She was holding her neck in pain, I just said I'll take you home. We got in the car and she said she needs a drink, so I stop by the local gas station and got her one. The whole way I was driving her home she feel asleep, I feel bad because I should had let her rest. I drop her home and told her that I had a great time even if she was sick. I went home and messaged her, she said that was a bad idea that we went out and she should have canceled. I didn't get upset because I knew she was just sick and she tried to do her best to hang out with me. Later that weekend I was house sitting for my brother for a week while his family and him was on vacation. Araceli and I made plans for ger to stay over so we can get to know each other better. That's Saturday morning, I woke up and we had a morning chat, she wasn't feeling well still. So I didn't try to push her into coming over. We talk about two hours till she had to leave to get some medicine for her sore throat. I went to my brother's house and just waited for her. He messaged me ""can I call?"" And I said of course. She called me and was speaking weird like a slow special kid with a speech problem. I made a joke about it and she just laughed so hard. We just talked and started singing songs that we both knew, it was so much fun. About 4 hours in our video chat, we decided to let each other go. When I hang up, I quickly said ""I love you"" and she messaged me ""did you think you could got away with that?"" I was thinking nothing about it and thought she was joking because we said it a few times and we just blush it off.  The reason she got mad in her words ""At this moment in my life I don't feel comfortable with them."" Then we start to fight, calling each other names and how we wish we didn't meet. It was going on for hours, it was my worst night with her and I thought we would never fight. I told her to go to sleep and we talk about it the morning, then I finally put my phone down and went to sleep. The next morning, I messaged her and she was still mad. I try to talk with her but she wasn't having it. She told me as soon as she can she was going block me. I got upset and started to beg, because this was our first fight and I really care for her. So I messaged her, blow her phone up and ask her to give it a very days. Then she finally blocked me and I was so heartbroken, upset because I lost my close friend that I talk with everyday and about everything.  I was freaking out because I didn't want to lose her. I remember that I had a second account and I login and messaged her ""hello."" She didn't answer me till the next morning. We started chatting as it was the first time and she was telling me about her life which I already knew. As we were chatting, I feel guilty because I didn't told her it was me. But I was thinking if I told her she would hate me forever and that would be the end. I try to chat differently but I wasn't thinking that I was on my second account, I was just talking with her like it was just us. She keeps asking me for a picture and I keep telling her why ruden something. I was grinding my teeth when she keeps asking me for a picture. I knew it was so wrong I should had stop it before it got too deep into the conversation. Later on that next weekend, I was talking with her on my second account and tell her I was going out to eat. She unblocked and messaged me on my main account, I didn't know what to think. She asked me how I was doing and everything. I told her i was fine and I'm hungry.  I said I was thinking about going out to eat and I don't know if i should ask her to go with me. She said ""why?"" I said because I didn't think you want to but she said we can start over. I was in joy but still feel guilty about not telling her it wasn't me that she been talking with all week. I told her I'll pick her up in an hour and we can eat and hang out. So I arrived and I got out of the car to greet her. She said she broke her foot because there's a shed in the kitchen in Joe's kitchen. But she didn't told me, she told me on my second account. I just noticed it on how she was walking, limping on her left foot. We got in the car and went out to eat. We were talking about our fight and we took each other that we were sorry. I still remember it because it was the wrost feeling ever and I never wanted to fight with her again. She meet some crazy people online, I think some of them have mental health issues. All these guys she been talking with have some crazy sex fantasies. For example, she was telling me awhile back, she meet a guy and went out on a few dates. The guy asked her to help him to become a woman, which she did and never try to talk to him again. Then awhile ago, the same guy messaged her and of course she has a big heart and answer back. He said he was a dog, I just looked at her and laughed. She was laughing too as she explained it to me. This guy wants to pay her about $400,000 for her to take care of him while he dress and acts like a dog. He will act like a dog all the time, he'll even will sleep on a dog bed. It was so crazy that he wants to have sex with a dog. He show her what type of dogs he likes. Apparently he told her that he had sex with a dog, she called the police and they arrested him in an alley with homeless dogs. He post bail and text her and said he knows that it her her that called the police on him. I was just shaking my head and laugh, I don't think she going take his offer. We finished our meal and ask her if she wanted to go back to my brother's house because there was nobody there, she agreed. We arrived there as we went in, I let the dogs outside and let them back in. I was kissing on her and everything. I try to have sex with her but she told me no and I stop because I respect her. She needed to go to the store and get so things and food, I don't mind driving her around as I enjoy being with her, laughing and talking. I asked her if she will ever block me and she said is there's a reason to. She grab everything that she needed from the store and we decided that she was ready to go home because she had cold food in the car. I drive by a creek with a bunch of ducks and gooses, she smiles as she lights up because I knew she would love that. She use to have a bunch of animals when she was married to her first husband. We were just talking each other ears off like nothing happened, we forgive each other as we heal from the fight. She told me to message her when I get home. I drop the car off at my brother's house as they got back from vacation and got a ride back home. I messaged Araceli and said I'm home and had a great time. She said she did too as she starts asking questions and tell me about this guy she been talking to and how he wasn't messaged her back. I knew she was talking about my second account but still didn't tell her it was me. She said her anxiety was up all week because so random guy just messaged her and didn't know who it was. It could be an crazy ex and I start to feel bad because I didn't want her anxiety to go up and stress her out. She flat out told me if it was me to tell her and she wasn't mad, again I was thinking she going hate me and not speak with me after she knows. She said she going call the cops and said she being harassed. I still didn't tell her the truth as she said the cops found the internet address and phone number. I was at my brother's house when I was on my second account and I didn't want him to get involved. So I finally broke down and told her, I explained to her I just did it because i didn't want to lose you at the moment. I was freaking out and she was just laughing the whole time. I beg her to not get me lock up and I'll leave her alone, she was still laughing, sending me videos of her laughing and giving me the middle finger. I didn't know what to do and think, she finally told me to settle down as she was still laughing and ""pee"" herself. ""I got you"" she said, I was still in stress as she told me ""now you know how i feel."" She explained that she knew it was me the whole time as she knows me, how I text and what I said at times. She knows what type of pizza I like as she likes the same thing as me. After awhile, I settled down as she still laughing. She knows why I didn't send her a picture and I told her that when we were sexting that I wasn't going show her a picture of my penis because she knows what it looks like and it would give it away. She understands why I did it and never lie to her again, I told Araceli that I was very sorry and I knew it was wrong but I had to take a chance. She understood but said that she might be mad over a fight and she just needed some time to think about it and she will return. I told I didn't know that because we never fight before and now I know. She said that she didn't want to have sex with me on that day because she didn't want to think it was okay and rewarded me, I understood. She was telling me about her week as she didn't ""talk to me"" and told me about somethings. She was telling me how she meet a super big, tall and muscular man. I just listen as he was telling her about a sex club in Vegas, there's a green and light green door. I was like okay? As she said he would go inside the light green door, what that means is he's bisexuality. I just started laughing and making joke. She thought it was funny to as he thought she didn't know. Araceli experience a lot of different things so she knows a lot, you can't trick her. She was also telling me about an another guy at the bar that she went with Joe. The guy was talking about how his ex wife cheated on him and ask Araceli if she would cut her legs off for a large amount of money and be his girlfriend or wife. I was thinking, that way you can run off on him. She tells me a lot of crazy things with people and I enjoy that she tells me these things because I found them interesting. The next day, she wasn't messaged me like how she normally does, I was just thinking joe probably making her do a bunch of house chores because she still live there rent free. Then she messaged me and told me to not to get mad. I just asked her what's wrong and just telling me, she said ""I'm married."" I thought she was just joking and start to laugh. She said she was serious and she asked me to not to go anywhere before she was talking with him. Apparently awhile ago, her ex-fanice now her husband went to Las Vegas and got married in a star trek wedding chapel. I was just in shock and laughing, making jokes and ask her if they was playing deep space nine, that's her favorite. She was just laughing as we all didn't know what to think. I asked her how did you find out, she said she was looking online at her last divorce and saw there was a marriage certificate with her ex-fanice and her. I just couldn't believe it as I know she doesn't want to get married again. She just said that they got drunk and thought the chapel was a joke. Her now husband is trying to get her to come back and live with him because he's in the marines and will get extra benefit. He even showed her the experience ring that he got for her before they broke up. The reason she doesn't want to be with him is he lie and cheat and give her a UTI. He has a secret that nobody knows, he's bisexuality and likes having sex with other men. She doesn't trust bisexuality as they lie to her. She been though a lot and want something different or maybe normal for one. I asked her what she was going to do, she said I want a divorce. I know she still has feelings for him and I was curious if she might change her mind. She called me the next morning, we start to laugh and all of sudden we got serious. ""I can't believe this happened Araceli"" she replied and said I know, I'm so mad. A few days later, I pick her up so we can hang out. I took her out for lunch and she ate it like she haven't eaten in days. Then we were talking and she was telling me how she was thinking about going live with her husband. He was having surgery and she wanted to help, I just told her if that what you want. She always been the type of person that doesn't hate on people, she tries to help them if she doesn't have anything. That's one of the reasons I adore her. We finished our meal and decided to go to the park for a swim. The pool was busy so we found a spot to sit and chat. She was telling me that she shows everyone my story. We were sitting and she was telling me how she might go help her husband and said that she will have a truck so she can come visit me on the weekends. I said that be great and I want to see your as much as I can as we just friends. We talk for awhile as the heat rise and we walk back to the car as we hold hands. She asked if we can go somewhere with air conditioning. I said yea, no problems.  We got a couple of drinks and went to the library. She loves books, she was walking around and looking at all of them. I just smiled and followed her around. She grab so cooking books as she went though them and took pictures of the recipe that she want to try. I just watch her as I took a picture of her. We were there for awhile as we were ready to go. I took her to the store as she needed some things, there's a bodywash that doesn't make her break out or something. She was disappointed that she didn't have enough money, I told her don't worry about it, I got it. She acted surprised that I would do that for her. I said if you need something like that, I don't mind helping you out as long as it makes you feel better. After we left the store, we got ice cream and she was telling me more stories about her Vegas drunk hitch. We still can't believe it as we laugh, I took her home after we were finished. As I was taking her home to Joe's house, we somehow have a conversation about her coming to my home and meet my mother. We decided that she will come on Friday. We still chat though out the night as everything was fine between us. I woke up the next morning and messaged her, I asked her how was her husband surgery. She said he was in there and with the hospital with Joe. I asked her when she got there, she said last night. I asked everything is okay and she said yes and her husband three kids was scared and she was conforming them. That was good that she was there in support of him, helping his family and kids. She was telling me about the room that it's looks like a fancy hotel. She went to the bathroom to send me a voice message as everyone as who she was talking to. She said just a friend. Joe bring the dog as the dog was happy to be there with air conditioning because he doesn't have it in his house. She told me that the dog was puking at his house and I said he mostly likely just hot. Which turns out to be true and Joe said he was going to get some windows air conditioners. Her husband sister told Araceli that her marriage might have been forced and she told me. We roll our eyes as her first marriage was forced because she was in jehovah witness. I was surprised that someone said that to her and annoyed. She was too as she remained calm. Her husband got out of surgery that early afternoon, everything went well as he was opening his eyes and talking. I said that good and she was going take the kids home as Joe goes home. She did his laundry and fold them up. Later that night, she went to the sex club to sit by the pool and relax as she was up all night. Joe was there and his face got really red as he was angry cause three guys was trying to get with her. I messaged her the next morning and she went off, she was telling me how Joe yell at her. She said her and her husband was talking and he said if you go back with him she going to be a heroine homeless whore. He told her he put a lot of work in her and she has no discipline and how her husband is her drug. She said people can work things out and he could have changed. She told me that they broke up a few times and she just told Joe that to make him mad. She was very angry at him as she went outside to mow the yard. She told me that she's sorry about bitching, I told her don't worry about it and you can tell me anything bad or good.  She was just keeping herself busy as she stays away from him. She call me later that night and I could tell she wasn't very tried and hot. She was just sitting there eating her chips and having a conversation with me. We ended the night and I told her that I'll see you tomorrow. I called my brother to make sure that I can have the car, he said no because his wife was using it. I got pretty upset so I asked my mother if I can borrow the car or she can take me to get Araceli and I'll put gas in the take. She agreed and that was a load off my mind as I told Araceli. For some reason, my parents don't want me, a grow man to drive there car every once in awhile. I get so frustrated because I feel trapped in this house as same as Araceli feels trapped. I give my mother gas money as I messaged Araceli that we were on the way. My anxiety was high because this is the first time anyone meet Araceli, the woman who I been talking with and went out a few times. Araceli was sitting, waiting for us at the small playground as we pulled in the church parking lot cause again Joe doesn't want anyone to know where he lives but I already know where his house is located. Araceli starts walking up to the car as I got out of the car to greet her, I told Araceli that I was nervous and she said it be okay. She got in the car, my mother and her start to talk about things that they both like to talk about. I ordered a pizza online as I told Araceli that we will get one, sausage and stuffed crust, we enjoyed that type of pizza. Araceli was telling my mother on how we met and the video chat. Araceli encourage me to do it ""video call with me or we're done."" I just made a joke saying that I just flipped a coin and it landed to call Araceli the first time. We all laughed as we make it to grab the pizza that I ordered and went to my home. Araceli and my mother was just chatting away as my anxiety went down and I was becoming more calm. We arrived at the house as I let her in. The day before she was coming, I made sure I cleaned everything and the bathroom. I made a joke to her that I don't want her to think I'm another Joe with a dirty house, she just laughed. She liked my little set up as a room as it looks comfortable. I turn the television on as we start eating our pizza. I was very happy that she was with me and just smiling. I have two dogs which won't stop barking for hours since Araceli was there. I was getting very annoyed, then my mother can downstairs to get the little dachshund to be friends with Araceli. It worked for a few minutes then the barking continues. Araceli made herself comfortable at the corner of the couch as I joke you don't want to sit by me. She just laughed as I started to kiss her and she does the same. She said we need to be good as I was kissing her. I was excited as she got hot. We were looking at each other and smiled. Then I start rubbing between her legs as she gots wet and then I pull down my shorts. She starts to suck my cock as she was rubbing herself. I want her badly, she got up and got on the bed and bend over. My cock was inside her as I blow my load inside her. We feel so relaxed after we had sex. She cleaned herself and went back to the corner of the couch. She feels so relaxed and stress free that she fell asleep. I just looked at her and glad she was with me. I let her nap for awhile till she woke up and got hungry. She asked for more pizza which I gladly got for her. We had the television on but wasn't watching it as we were just talking and enjoying each other company. My parents leave that evening to hang out with there friends. I asked my mother is Araceli can just stay a night and she agreed that she could. Araceli was happy and took her bra off and said i don't need to wear this, as we both laughed. Araceli had her middle finger up and try to put it up my ass hole while I was trying to kiss her. We were just playing around but she fell off the couch and landed in front of me. She got ahold of me but my reflex accidently kicked her in the virgin and we laugh for a hour over that. She was taking a bunch of pictures of me and the dogs, she was really enjoyed herself. I feed her each time she said she was hungry. She was worried that she was taking all my food, I told her don't worry about it. We just chatting, she told me about all the guys she was talking with and we watched short videos on our phones. Joe keeps messaging her and ask her when she's coming back. She said that she was staying a night. Joe thought she was with her husband, but she took a picture of me and sent it to him. We both think Joe want to keep her around to be his ""mom."" The little dachshund finally became her friend as Araceli was holding her like a baby. Later that night, I asked her if her husband was going to give her the divorce. She said yes, they kissed and there was nothing there. She explained it was like she was kissing her brother or a friend and he said the same thing about her. We continue talking about everything till we got tried. It's was about 9:30pm then we head to bed to watch something on the television. I made a joke that we are an old couple going to bed this early and I finally got a girl in my bed, she just laughed and smiled. We went in bed and I was on the right side as she was on the left. I asked her to switch sides as the dachshund was in the bed jumping around on us. We finally went to sleep as I woke up before her, i look at her as she looks peaceful and relaxed. I just drink my coffee as she finally woke up. I made us breakfast as we talk all morning. We share at each other at times in the eyes and I always ask ""what?"" She likes to reply and said ""i can't look at you?"" As she laughs. It was time for her to go as we both want her to stay. I wish she can stay as long as I want her to but it's my parents house. We hug each other as I told Araceli that I will miss her because I don't have a car that I can't borrow at the moment. My mother was waiting in the car for us, we walk out and got in. We told her some jokes about our night and we went to bed early. The conversation of online dating starts as we both know it can be scary and you don't know what might happen, it can go well or bad. Araceli made a joke that she was going ""kill me for my millions."" We all laughed at we made it to Joe's house and Araceli got out. It's was a great night as I feel like we get closer each time we get together. I don't feel stressed or freaking out when I'm with her. As she was at my house, I keep telling her she is beautiful but I understand that she hear all that before so those sweet words are kinda meaningless to her. But she doesn't realize I actually mean them with everything I know about her. She saved two people lives and her heart is purely goad. She will always be my friend and I hope we will be till last my last breath. I told her one time that what makes someone beautiful is what's inside them and you can be yourself. We can be ourselves when we are together, making fart jokes or making fun of my strong arm (I'm disabled where my left side is weaker than my right side) I don't mind she jokes about that because I joke with her with some things and we just laughed, that's a special friendship if you can't get mad at each other for anything. My mother and I was talking in car, she really likes Araceli and said she can come back. My mother thinks she is good for me. She was impressed with Araceli embracing my disability but Araceli doesn't believe in disability, she said it just limitations. Mom told me that she knows she makes me happy and said she was my girlfriend. I said no because we just friends and drop it. Joe sometimes thinks there something going on with us and she said the same thing, we just friends. I arrived back home and told her I already miss her and she said the same thing. I told her the little dachshund was looking for her and even look for her where Araceli was sitting on the couch. So I took a shower and ate some lunch as I waited for her to message me. She told me that she had to water the chickens and clean up the dog, Joe was still sleeping and never does anything anyways. I asked her if it he looked like he was drinking all night and she said that what it looks like. Some time went by and she messaged me, and was piss. Joe been online dating and he found this girl, Araceli calls her the gutter rat because she smells. The first time she can over, Araceli thought the dog shit on the floor but it turns out that it was this girl that Joe brought home. She asked him ""you can't smell that?"" He didn't know what smell she was talking about. So anyways this girl went into Araceli room where she was spending the night with me. Her night stand was open while her bedroom door was open. They keep the door shut because there two kittens and they like to pee everywhere. Araceli asked who was in her room and found out it was this girl. She asked who give her permission to go in there, she said Joe, as he shakes his head. She trying to figure out why she was in her room but didn't steal anything, she came up with an answer saying Araceli was abusing the kittens. I knew that was a lie because everytime I video chat her, she always kind to the kittens and love animals. Araceli got really mad when she said that, she grab her hair and make her got on her knees, naked. She grab her belt and spank her ass, she was treating her like a dog. Her dominatrix side switch on as she was in control of the conflict. Araceli was going let everything go but as soon as she said that she abuse the kittens, that was it. The girl asked Araceli if she was going fuck her, she said no! Araceli isn't bisexuality, she not into those things. She made this girl clean after the dog, Joe was so scared that he helped cleaning. I was just laughing and surprised because this was the first time I heard that she was fully in control. I asked her what happens if she calls the cops, she said she won't, plus her cop pal is coming over. I was just laughing as she told me what was going on. I actually was proud of her because I know a lot of people take advantage of her and she looks the other way. She finally took control of something and stood up for herself. I still couldn't believe it because I just drop her off awhile ago and all this happened. Araceli is a really sweet woman, I know what I did was wrong on my second account but she took it easy on me because she knows I'm a good guy. But if you cross her, she call turn to a dominatrix female quickly. It was pretty funny, I told her watch you are going to bring out the dominant out of me as we laugh. Araceli is my close friend and she makes me happy, I feel better when she around me as we talk. She is a very strong woman even if she breaks down and crys at times. I don't know where our story going but she knows I will always be there and she can always call me as I like see her face each day. I know there will be more to come as the days goes by and she's part of my everyday life and I feel blessed. I remember when I was talking with her on my second account she was talking about me and said I was talented. I don't see that in me but she does. She likes to see the good in people and bring the best out of them. I know i haven't told every single detail but there's so much to tell. You all probably wonder why I'm telling you things about our story and if I'm breaking her trust. The answer is no because she told me to share. She knows everything I'm writing and she loves it. She trust me as much as I do with her. Awhile back, I told her that I'll go anywhere with her even if it's a risk and that how much I trust her. You probably thinking why? We both experience different things, she has a more crazy and wild life as I'm more of on the boring side of life. The reason is we both don't have anything, no car, no money or our own place, we both live in a home where we have rules so I have nothing to lose, just like her. The story will continue and I can't see what happens next Araceli, I know you reading this. ",1,1751291961.0,RealStories,0,1.0,False

1lo87si,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1lo87si/its_honestly_depressing_how_little_people_value/,It’s honestly depressing how little people value games and game development,"I just saw a thread about the RoboCop game being on sale for something like $3.50, and people were still debating whether it’s worth grabbing or if they should wait for it to show up in a Humble Bundle.

I get that everyone wants a good deal, but it’s sad to see how little value people attach to the work that goes into making games. This is a title that took years of effort, and it’s less than the price of a cup of coffee right now. Yet people hesitate or feel the need to justify paying even that much.

Part of it, I think, is how different things are now compared to the past. When I was younger, you didn’t have hundreds of games available through subscriptions like Game Pass or endless sales. You’d buy a physical game, maybe a few in a year, and those games mattered. You played them, appreciated them, maybe even finished them multiple times. They weren’t just another icon in an endless backlog.

It’s the same reason everybody seems so upset at Nintendo right now because they rarely discount their games and they’re increased their prices a bit. The truth is, games used to cost the same or more 20–30 years ago and when you account for inflation, they’re actually cheaper now. People act like $70 or $80 is some outrageous scam, but adjusted for inflation, that’s basically the same or less than what N64 cartridges or SNES games used to cost.

As nice as it can be to see a game selling for $1, it’s honestly a race to the bottom. I actually support games being more expensive because it gives them more perceived worth. It feels like we’ve trained people to expect everything for nearly nothing, and then not only do they pay so little, they turn around and go on social media to call these games “mid” or “trash” even though games have never been bigger, better, and more technically impressive than they are right now.",29,1751291876.0,gamedev,18,0.85,False

1lo876p,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1lo876p/today_is_my_birthday/,Today is my birthday,"And it’s 129 days since he’s been gone. I have dreaded today. Our birthdays were always so special to each other. I would wake up on my birthday (or any holiday) and go to the kitchen and he’d have a surprise bouquet of flowers set up for me surrounded by my fave candy bars and a card. He always picked out the most beautiful cards even if he didn’t write a lot in them every time. I have every single one of the cards he’s given me though I don’t have the strength to read them. I got up this morning for coffee slowly and walked into my kitchen knowing there would be nothing there. And it still hurt all the same. He is really, REALLY gone. 

My husband was always singing stupid little songs around the house, teasing and playing around. He was always on board for any ideas I had. He let me lead. He let me have the remote every time. He was my other half. He was perfect in so many ways- FOR ME. He deserved the world, and was just ripped from it violently. ITS NOT FAIR AND IM SO PISSED. 

For the longest time, at least the first two months, I was making notes in my phone in anticipation of dying myself. I just didn’t want to live without him but had some responsibilities to take care of first. I’m grateful my mind has gotten a little healthier and I have chosen to stay here until my own natural finale but I’m still sad that I have to live without him. And that I’m forced to be alone. Forced. Because when you lose someone like this you can’t just go and fill that void with someone else, ever. I think it would only make a person crazy. Maybe it’s just me but no one could ever fill my husbands shoes. So again, I’m forced to heal and sit with this pain and sorrow until the day finally comes when I can look at another human being and imagine sharing a life with them too. I’m not sure the day will ever come, though I remain hopeful there is more to my life waiting for me someday. 

Maybe you can understand this feeling I struggle to put into words that relates to the above- I want to be a married person and always have. I found my person in my husband. We didn’t have a perfect marriage but had a good one and a true one where we could be ourselves with one another. Now my best friend is gone and I have two choices- stay loyal to him forever and be alone, or try to heal each day in anticipation of a new chapter and life. They both feel foreign. He should be here. I shouldn’t be thinking of any other partners. It’s a paradox when you still feel married. 

Anyway this turned into a book of sorts. I have dreaded seeing my birthday. I hope desperately for any sign from him today to comfort me. I’ve gotten signs since his death but I also feel I’m reaching. Nothing is quite what I hope for- him walking in the door suddenly saying something like, “Hear me out,” and some crazy story about what has been going on this past four months that isn’t him being dead. 

When will I be able to accept this? Right when I think I have, another dip is coming on this roller coaster ride and I can’t believe he’s gone again. It’s so exhausting. ",1,1751291834.0,widowers,4,1.0,False

Me 29f was in a “relationship” if you can call it that for years with a man who lied profusely from 18-25. It took a huge toll on my mental and played a great role in me not being interested in dating again. Fast forward a couple years and I give the apps a try. A couple little flings but nothing really sticks. Why? Well apparently I have a very physical reaction to inconsistencies or what anyone would consider to be red flags. I consider myself lucky because before I had been to naive and lost years of my life being mistreated. So I thought hey this is good we can see the red flags ! We will never be abused that way again! But now I’m beginning to question myself. 

Please be gentle with your comments because this is a very vulnerable topic and my ex used to use the “your crazy” line a lot and unfortunately if you hear something enough i guess you start to believe it. 

After the few attempts at dating I give it a break. Around may 2024  I match with a man (32). We hit it off immediately in the interest department. Literally enjoying similar activities in the same parts of the state at the same time but have never bumped into each other. For a few months we take it slow, when things got too serious I would distance myself. I was more looking for a friend and the time because I had a lot going on in my personal life. Fast forward he is consistently warm and friendly and supportive. I find comfort in his presence and start to trust his character based on what he has shown/ told me. I don’t forget he is a stranger I met on the internet and I truly don’t know him. I know what he shows me. But I let myself accept the love that he shows me because I feel I deserve to be treated well and I haven’t allowed myself genuinely trust a man in years. I know that sounds terrible. But in the time I dated since my ex unfortunately it was apparent how much people will lie to get their way. Man or woman. And I know that has everything to do with how I pick them but dating is hard these days lol

Back to the point. Me and we will call him Ed, get serious around November 24. He bought me diamond earrings for my birthday. Then a necklace soon after for Christmas. Got me tickets to an artist I love (amazing seats) and spoils me constantly. Carries my bags, drops coffee off at my work when I’m tired (we work opposite shifts). He is genuinely kind, supportive, and fun to be around. 

Something that I have been unsure how to feel about that didn’t set a bomb off in my chest or I’d have left but they sit at the back of my brain and make me think hmmm. He’s from a traditional family, he’s open that he wants marriage, he’s made comments that I could be a stay at home wife, and at first I’d laugh it off. But when we talk about it he still stands by that. It’s hard for me to tell what is him telling me his goals vs love bombing because our goals align? Can you hit it off with someone this well? Was his kind, supportive behavior love bombing?

The deodorant. 

Last weekend went to the next state over for a concert. He got me VIP to my favorite artist. It was amazing. Sunday we drove home on the backroads like we always do. Then it came up. He had mentioned he never wears deodorant because he isn’t very musky. But then why do I have a visceral memory of him using deodorant early on when we went camping while we were still friends. Granted my memory is not the best but I feel like I remember this. Even the kind. Because I remember him saying something particularly about the kind he was using. But now he is blatantly saying no. I have never worn deodorant. He says he doesn’t own any even. Okay but I have this memory. It came up jokingly a few times after and he dead pan said “If I said I used that deodorant I’d be a liar”. We are never serious, always joking around. It’s one of the things I love the most about our dynamic. I let it go but it sat at the bottom of my stomach the rest of the three hour drive home. We pull into my drive way and start grabbing my stuff from the truck to bring inside. I pop open the glove department to check for my wallet keys and what not and I find a stick of deodorant. I grabbed it and said what the fuck? Why are you gaslighting me? That makes me feel crazy. And he said “cause it’s funny”. I know he was joking about the “because it’s funny” but was he intentionally lying? Had he not used it for a long time and forgot? The uncertainty is enough to make me sick. 

He’s an interesting person. He has done a lot in his life and it has all checked out. So based on the information he has given me.  When odd things come up I sort of go yeah that seems like Ed. But have this memory of him using deodorant. And then I found deodorant. 

I am genuinely questioning everything I know about him now because of this.

I do not have time to be emotionally unregulated because I am being lied to. I have a job and a life that I need to focus on. It seems so small but feels huge. I feel sick thinking about what else he has lied about.

1lo84t8,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lo84t8/explore_the_best_espresso_machine_delonghi_dedica/,Explore the Best Espresso Machine DeLonghi Dedica Arte Worth It,"De'Longhi Dedica Arte EC885M found its way into my kitchen, and boy, do I have some thoughts to share. For someone like me, who starts every day with a cup (or three) of coffee, this sleek espresso machine quickly became a centerpiece of my countertop. Designed to pack a punch while saving space, it comes with a reputation for crafting café-worthy espresso, lattes, and cappuccinos. Naturally, I was excited to see if it lived up to the hype.

**Compact Yet Stylish Design**

Immediately, what stood out was the size. At just 6"" wide, this espresso machine fits snugly in my small kitchen, a feature I truly appreciated. Aesthetically, the stainless steel finish gives it a professional, contemporary vibe that classed up my counter effortlessly. Its slim profile doesn’t compromise its functionality either—a hard balance to strike with products this compact. Despite its stylish exterior, I noticed the machine does pick up fingerprints rather quickly, leading me to wipe it down more often than I’d like.

**Precision Brewing Like A Pro**

I've had my share of machines that leave you guessing when it comes to making espresso. This one features a 15-bar professional pressure, which guarantees consistency. It didn’t disappoint. The espresso I brewed tasted rich, strong, and exactly how I’d expect from a coffee shop. The professional tamper and large filter basket, capable of holding up to 18g of ground coffee, allowed me to chase that perfect crema with each pull. However, the learning curve for nailing the grind size and tamp pressure was real. Had a few lackluster shots before getting into the groove.

[Check De'Longhi EC885M price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b09hlb4dp4/)

**Steam Wand With Artistic Potential**

The My LatteArt Steam Wand is where things got fun. Creating café-quality froth with this has been a charm, and—even as someone not overly skilled in latte art—I managed to whip up impressive designs. It lends that creamy texture crucial for lattes and cappuccinos, and I started feeling like a barista after just a few uses. That said, it took a while to get used to cleaning the steam wand, as milk tends to cling to it if not addressed immediately after steaming. Minor nuisance, but worth noting.

**Ease of Use and Adjustability**

This espresso machine aims to simplify things with its Automatic Flow Stop feature, and I couldn’t agree more. It dispenses the right amount of espresso consistently, a relief for someone like me who can be impatient in the mornings. The adjustable double drip tray was another lifesaver—it fit my taller latte glasses seamlessly. That said, if you’re someone who loves experimenting with intricate brews, the limited setting adjustments could feel restrictive.

**Highlights**

- Compact design fits even tiny counters while maximizing functionality.
- Stainless steel exterior enhances the aesthetic appeal of any kitchen.
- Consistent 15-bar pressure ensures quality espresso every time.
- Efficient steam wand makes frothing milk easier for latte art enthusiasts.
- Automatic Flow Stop eliminates guesswork for espresso shots.

**Shortcomings**

- Steam wand cleaning requires immediate attention for fuss-free upkeep.
- Fingerprint-prone exterior may necessitate frequent wiping.
- Limited brew customization, which might not satisfy coffee perfectionists.

**Performance Compared To Product Rivals**

Compared to other machines in this price range, such as the Breville Bambino Plus, this unit holds its own. The Bambino Plus might edge it out with faster heat-up time and automated milk texturing, but what I liked about the EC885M was the manual frothing, which added a personal touch to making coffee. The Gaggia Classic Pro, another popular alternative, offers more metal components and a more durable build, but it lacks the space-saving design of the EC885M, which is crucial for tight kitchen setups.

That being said, if you value extreme precision or grinding options, the Breville grind-and-brew models are worth considering. However, these often come with a steeper price tag and require even more counter space.

**Price Performance**

This espresso machine falls in an affordable range amidst its competitors, especially given its premium design and versatile features. Is it perfect? Not quite. But the value it provides—with reliable shots, decent milk frothing capabilities, and user-friendly aspects—justifies the investment. For someone dipping their toe into the world of home espresso machines without wanting to splurge on professional-grade equipment, it strikes the sweet spot.

1lo83ed,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lo83ed/blood_noir_by_laurell_k_hamilton/,Blood Noir by Laurell K. Hamilton:,"Chapter 1  
  
  I CAME HOME to find two men sitting at my kitchen table. One of them was my live-in sweetie. The other was one of our best friends. One of them was a wereleopard; the other was a werewolf; both of them were strippers. At least once a month they took off more than just their clothes on stage. They changed shape on stage in front of a live audience. Those nights the club was standing room only. I mean, you can go to other clubs to see men take their clothes off, but their entire skin and bodywell, that was unique.  
  
  Nathaniel came to greet me with a kiss and a hug. I let my hands play in the long, thick auburn hair that trailed down his broad shoulders, the curve of his waist, the tightness of his ass, and the long muscular legs. He was five-seven now, an inch taller than when Id met him. In my three-inch heels I was still an inch shorter than him. At twenty-one he was finally growing into the promise of those shoulders. His face was less soft than it had been, and more masculine. He would always be beautiful rather than handsome, but the bone structure had changed minutely so he just suddenly looked his age, instead of like jailbait.  
  
  He blinked down at me with the soft lilac of his eyes. On his drivers license it said his eyes were blue, because they wouldnt let him put lavender, or purple. His eyes were different shades of color, depending on his mood, or whaTHE wore, but blue was never the color of his eyes.  
  
  His hands slid underneath the jacket of my suit, and a little lower to trace the top of my skirt. His hands hesitated a little at the Browning BDM in its shoulder holster. Guns do get in the way of cuddling.  
  
  I wrapped my arms around the bareness of his upper body, breathed in the scent of his skin. He was wearing whaTHE usually wore in his off time in the summer, little bitty jogging shorts. Most of the wereanimals would go around nude if you let them. I wasnt quite comfy with that, so he wore the shorts to save my delicate sensibilities. There were some who thought I didnt have any of those left, but they would be wrong, and they would be jealous.  
  
  Holding him, breathing in the warmth and sweet vanilla of his skin, I understood the jealousy. Though frankly, not all of it was about sex or even having found love at last. It was about power and them wanting it, and me and mine having it. It was about me being the human servant of Jean-Claude, the Master Vampire of St. Louis. It was about body count, and me having the highest kill count among the vampire executioners in the good ol U. S. of A.  
  
  I would give a less favored body part to have a woman greet me at the end of the day like that, Jasons voice said.  
  
  I had to peer around Nathaniels body to see Jason. He was still at the kitchen table nursing a coffee mug. It even smelled like coffee, buTHE huddled over it, as if it were something harder and more intoxicating.  
  
  Jason was two years older than Nathaniel, which made him twenty-three now. Strangely, Id met them both when they were nineteen. Jason was my height, give or take a half inch or so. His hair was that shade of yellow blond that movie stars are fond of, but his was real, and didnt have to come from a good salon. His hair was cut businessman short. I liked long hair, but I had to admit that Jasons face looked cleaner, better, more handsome even, without the hair to distract. He was wearing a blue T-shirt that made his eyes even bluer than they were. The color not of spring, but of summer skies, before the heat has gotten too hot, but you know its not May anymore.  
  
  The clothes hid what I knew, thaTHE looked even better out of them. It wasnt for lack of cuteness and desirability that Jason wasnt my sweetie. He was my friend, and I was his.  
  
  What about Perdita, Perdy? You and she are going steady, right?  
  
  He grinned at me. Going steady, youre so cute.  
  
  I frowned at him. What else do you call it?  
  
  Nathaniel kissed me on the forehead. You really are cute.  
  
  I moved away from him and scowled at them both. Im serious, what else do you call it? You arent just fuck buddies. She isnt a one-night stand. Shes a serious girlfriend. If its not going steady, what do you call it?  
  
  You make it sound like I gave her my class ring, Anita. Perdy and I were lovers, and she wanted it to be exclusive.  
  
  I thought you were exclusive.  
  
  Except for you, I was.  
  
  Wait, youre talking past tense. Are you saying you and Perdy broke up?  
  
  She gave him an ultimatum, Nathaniel said. He trailed his hand down my arm as he moved away. Ill get you coffee.  
  
  I went to the table and took the seat that Nathaniel had started in. What kind of ultimatum? I asked.  
  
  Jason stared into his coffee cup while he answered. She wanted me to stop having sex with Jean-Claude and Asher, and you.  
  
  Wait, you arent having sex with Jean-Claude and Asher, unless theres something I dont know.  
  
  He smiled at me. The look on your face, man. He raised his fingers in the Boy Scout salute. I am not now, nor have I ever been having sex with Jean-Claude or Asher.  
  
  Nathaniel set fresh coffee down in front of me and took a chair across the table on the other side of Jason, so wed both be able to look at him. It also meant we wouldnt be able to do more than hold hands, which was probably good; we tended to distract each other.  
  
  But she didnt believe you, I said.  
  
  Nope, she didnt. He took a sip of coffee.  
  
  Why wouldnt she believe you? I asked.  
  
  Im not sure.  
  
  If my feeding the ardeur off you through sex bugged your steady girl, you should have said something.  
  
  I am Jean-Claudes pomme de sang, his apple of blood. I am his blood donor, and I go where my master tells me to go. The ardeur is your version of a blood feed and youre his human servant. Jean-Claude shares me with Asher, his second-in-command, for blood and you for sex, and its his right to share me. I am his. I belong to him. Perdy knows that. She got kicked out of Cape Cod because she wanted to be more than just a blood donor to the master vampire there.  
  
  Samuel didnt say anything about that. In fact, his son, Sampson, said that Perdy was here to spy on him for his mother.  
  
  Yeah, but Sampson went home, and Perdy didnt.  
  
  Sampson had gone home because St. Louis got invaded by some of the scariest vampires in the world. Jean-Claude had thought it was a bad idea to risk getting the eldest son of his friend and ally killed. Besides, Sampson was a merman, and they arent big on offensive abilities, at least not this far inland. Perdy was a mermaid, too. Though Id never seen either of them turn all fishy. They just looked like people to me.  
  
  Perdy stayed for you, Nathaniel said.  
  
  Jason nodded. She wanted me to be hers. Shes very jealous, very possessive. Im just not into that.  
  
  So you have a woman who greets you like Anita greets me, but the rest doesnt work.  
  
  No, Nathaniel. She used to greet me sort of like that, but for weeks now its been, Where have you been? Who have you been with? You fucked the master again, didnt you? You fucked Asher, didnt you? You were with Anita again, werent you?  
  
  Ive put you on the back burner for feeding me, I said. I got the impression Perdy didnt want to share you that much, but I had no idea she thought you were doing more than just donating blood to the vampires.  
  
  Shes like crazy jealous, and she wont believe me when I tell her I havent been with anyone else. Its why I asked Jean-Claude to take me out of your feeding schedule for a while. I thought if I stopped having sex with the only other person I was really having sex with that Perdy would calm down.  
  
  Nathaniel and I exchanged glances across the table. He shrugged. I asked the question. Did it work?  
  
  No, he said. He took another drink of coffee, and it must have finished the cup because he got up and went for the French press beside the sink. He took the coffee cozy off of it, then put it back on without filling his cup. He set the cup in the sink.  
  
  I dont want more coffee.  
  
  You can never have too much coffee, I said.  
  
  He turned and smiled at me. You think so, but the rest of us get a little ODed on your level of caffeine.  
  
  What happened, Jason? I  
asked.  
  
  The smile slipped a little more. He was solemn when he turned to us. He leaned his back against the cabinets, crossed his arms across his chest, and again didnt quite meet our eyes.  
  
  She wanted me to marry her. Till death do us part and all that. Shes a mermaid, which means shell outlive me. She can live for hundreds of years, not immortal like a vampire, but close.  
  
  You didnt want to marry her, I said, softly.  
  
  He shook his head. Shes obsessed with me. She says she loves me, but it doesnt feel like love. It feels like Im smothering.  
  
  Shes not the right one, then.  
  
  He grinned, and it almost reached his eyes. Look whos talking about the right one. You cant pick just one either.  
  
  Thats different.  
  
  Why, because youre a living vampire who feeds off sex, so you have to have a bevy of lovers? The ardeur is like the perfect excuse to never have to say youre sorry.  
  
  Id change it if I could, you know that.  
  
  He came to me then, put his arms around my shoulders, and rested his cheek on the top of my head. I didnt mean to make you sad, Anita. God knows I didnt. Please, dont tell me youd change it if you could. You love Nathaniel, and Micah. They love you. You love Jean-Claude and Asher, and they love you. Youre still a little confused about what to do with Damian, but youll get there.  
  
  I shook my head and stood up, moving away from him. Dont forget Requiem, and London, and sometimes Richard. Oh, wait, and the swan king pops in now and then, no pun intended. It sounded angry and bitter, and I was glad.  
  
  I didnt mean to say the wrong thing. I didnt mean to make you feel bad, or to have another woman mad at me tonight. Please, Anita, please, dont be mad. Im upset. You have no idea how upset. Please, please, Im a bastard, but dont be mad.  
  
  He held his hand out to me. His face pleaded along with his words. Id never seen his eyes full of quite this kind of pain. The look in his eyes was more than just losing a girlfriend he didnt want anymore.  
  
  I held out my hand, but made him take the step to close our fingers around each other. His eyes glittered in the overhead lights.  
  
  I took his hand, held it. His breath came in a soft gasp, and I thought for a second he was going to cry, buTHE just looked at me. His eyes that had glistened a moment before were almost dead, as if whatever he was feeling hed locked away somewhere. In a way, to me, that was worse. I went to him, and he wrapped his arms around me as if he were at the edge of a cliff and I were his only handhold. That quiet holding on was somale. A woman would have cried, or talked more, but for a man, after a certain point this is their pain.  
  
  I held him back, tried to tell him it would be all right. I whispered it into his hair, against his cheek. Its all right, Jason. Its all right.  
  
  Nathaniel came up behind him and wrapped his arms around us both. He pressed his cheek against his friends hair and said, Were here, Jason. Were here for you.  
  
  Jason just held on wordless, motionless, the strength in his arms, shoulders, pressing against me, but it wasnt about sex. Id never been pressed so close to any man and thought only, God, whats wrong? Either he had loved Perdy and now he was regretting letting her go, or the other shoe hadnt dropped. What else could be wrong?  
  
  We ended up on the floor of the kitchen, simply sitting in a row with our backs to the kitchen island. He still hadnt said what else was wrong, or thaTHE was desperately in love with Perdy and how could he fix it? I kept waiting for him to share. If hed been a girl friend Id have asked by now, but guy friends are different. Sometimes you have to sneak up on them like some sort of wild animal, no wereanimal pun intended; all men are leery of their emotions, spook them and theyll shut down. If youre careful, quiet, not too eager, sometimes youll learn more. Of course, sometimes you have to club men over the head with some question to get any sense out of them, but they prefer to speak from a quiet place.  
  
  Jason had his head against Nathaniels shoulder, and a hand on my leg. At least he, like most of the men in my life, was cuddlier than most. I appreciated that.  
  
  Jasons voice came flat, empty, as if he were afraid to let his voice feel anything. My fathers dying of cancer. My mom called last night just after Perdy and I broke up.  
  
  I exchanged a glance with Nathaniel. His wide eyes let me know that it was news to him, too.  
  
  Jesus, Jason, Im sorry, I said.  
  
  We hate each other, of course, and now the cold bastards dying and I wont have time to forgive him before he dies.  
  
  What can we do? Nathaniel asked, softly.  
  
  He smiled, a little weak, a little watered down, buTHE managed it. I thought it was a good sign. I hoped it was. You really want to know?  
  
  Name it, I said.  
  
  He smiled again, but his eyes flinched, as if Id hit him instead of told him Id do anything he wanted if it would take the pain away.  
  
  Perdy isnt here to tell me dont, or to tell you dont. Im a free man again. He tried for a laugh, but it was a sound more like a sob.  
  
  I get it, Nathaniel said.  
  
  I frowned at him. Then explain it to me, because I dont.  
  
  He wants to have sex with you again.  
  
  What? I said.  
  
  Perdy cant tell him, or you, no anymore. You can be lovers again.  
  
  You mean now, like in right now?  
  
  Nathaniel gave a half-shrug. Jason moved his head off the other mans shoulder. He dropped his hand away from my leg.  
  
  Its okay, Anita, Ive fucked this up. I know this isnt the way to approach you. But my head is so ugly tonight; I just cant seem to think clearly.  
  
  He pushed to his feet and started for the doorway.  
  
  I opened my mouth to say dont go, and yes. I closed it without saying any of it out loud, and looked at Nathaniel. I frowned at him. He was more than just my sweetie. The ardeur made me a sort of living vampire who fed off sex, but with the downsides came some interesting upsides. Nathaniel was my animal to call, which meanTHE was like my familiar. We shared emotions, power, and sometimes thoughts. Youre projecting inside my head, arent you?  
  
  You can shut me out if you want, he said.  
  
  Jason hesitated just short of the doorway. He frowned at us both. Im missing something.  
  
  I looked into the face of a man that I loved. Is this really what you want?  
  
  Hes my friend.  
  
  You know, most guys dont want their girlfriends to sleep with their friends.  
  
  If youd never slept with Jason, that would be different, but you have. Why is it wrong to sleep with him tonight?  
  
  I opened my mouth to say something reasonable, then closed it, because for the life of me, I couldnt come up with a clearheaded answer. Why was it wrong to sleep with Jason tonight? Because I hadnt planned on it? Because it felt slutty? Were any of those reasons good reasons?  
  
  Jason stopped in the doorway, caught between the light of the kitchen and the darkness of the living room beyond. Ive made you feel sorry for me. Im not sure I want that to be your motivation for taking me to bed.  
  
  Once upon a time, you wouldnt have cared why you got to sleep with me.  
  
  I was a slut, I know.  
  
  I didnt mean that, Jason.  
  
  Stay here tonight, Nathaniel said.  
  
  He half-turned so he could see us, but his face was still mostly in shadow. Why? Why do you want me to stay?  
  
  I shrugged at Nathaniel, with a this-was-your-idea expression.  
  
  Because youre our friend. Because we care about you.  
  
  And you, Anita, whats your motivation?  
  
  I looked up at him. There was something defiant about the set of his shoulders, as if he expected me to hurt him. I tried very hard not to do that. It just seems wrong for you to walk out the door right now. Stay, if the sex is an issue, then just stay for a big puppy pile. We can actually just sleep.  
  
  He shook his head. You never want to make me just sleep, Anita.  
  
  That made me uncomfortable. I dont know what to say to that, Jason.  
  
  Say you want me.  
  
/>   I started to say something, but Nathaniel touched my hand. He needs the truth, Anita.  
  
  And what is the truth? I asked, taking my hand away from his.  
  
  Tell him how you feel, really feel about him.  
  
  I took a deep breath and thought about the truth; what was the truth? You are one of the best friends I have, Jason, and you shouldnt be alone tonight.  
  
  Jean-Claude would let me sleep with him.  
  
  But you wouldnt let him hold you while you feel miserable.  
  
  How do you know I wouldnt?  
  
  Call it a hunch.  
  
  He stood frozen in the doorway as if he couldnt decide, or as if part of him wanted to and part of him didnt. Id made him come to me to hold his hand. Now I went to him.  
  
  I wrapped my arms around him. He stayed stiff and unyielding. I pressed my head to his shoulder. Stay with us tonight, Jason, please.  
  
  He whispered against my hair, Why?  
  
  Because you want to.  
  
  Not good enough, he whispered.  
  
  Because I can feel how much it would hurt Nathaniel to see you leave tonight, and know that you didnt have anyone to hold you while you slept.  
  
  Its not sleep I want, Anita. Im afraid to sleep. Im afraid Ill dream. Last night wasbad.  
  
  I lifted my face up to look at him. You found all this out last night?  
  
  He nodded.  
  
  Bad dreams? I made it a question.  
  
  The worst; something about the news about my dad just raked a lot of shit up.  
  
  Nathaniels need pushed at me, almost staggering in his desire to have Jason stay. I tried to shield against him, but realized that one of the reasons I couldnt shield was that I agreed with him. A large part of me felt Jason should stay. Nathaniel was right; Jason was already on my list of lovers. Why was it wrong for me to admit that it was fun to sleep with Jason? Why was it always wrong for me to admit that I simply wanted to be with someone? Not because I had no choice, but because for once, I did?  
  
  He kissed my forehead. Ill go home.  
  
  I hugged him tighter, kept him in the doorway. It would be lovely if you stayed.  
  
  He looked startled. You sound like you mean that.  
  
  I nodded. I do.  
  
  He smiled, and it was a shadow of his usual one. Somewhere in there did you actually say please?  
  
  I smiled at him. I think I did.  
  
  Ive never heard you ask a man to please stay with you.  
  
  I dont usually have to.  
  
  Stay with us tonight, Nathaniel said.  
  
  I nodded. Stay.  
  
  The bed will be a little crowded when Micah gets home.  
  
  Hes out of town, I said.  
  
  A new wereleopard wanted to join our pard. Hes off interviewing, Nathaniel said.  
  
  Jason nodded. I like Micah, you know that.  
  
  But hes not your best friend like Nathaniel is, and hes not a girl, I said.  
  
  Jason nodded again. Tonight, I dont really want an audience.  
  
  Damian is even sleeping over with his latest vampire lover, Nathaniel said. We have the house to ourselves.  
  
  Some tension I hadnt been aware of slid away from Jason. I love everybody, but sometimes the group thing gets a little old. It was one of the things I liked about Perdy, at first.  
  
  You dont want a group orgy every night, but you dont want to be monogamous either, Nathaniel said.  
  
  Jason nodded. I am so fucked.  
  
  Not yet, I said, hugging him, but we can fix that.  
  
  He grinned at me, and it reached his eyes. Bedroom, bathroom, living room, or kitchen?  
  
  The kitchen floor is hard and the tile is cold. Why not just go to the nice soft bed? I asked.  
  
  Jason looked at Nathaniel.  
  
  Nathaniel answered the question. Jason has made love in a bed and only a bed since he started being with Perdy.  
  
  I frowned, then looked at Jason, still in a loose hug with me. I understand no shower or bath sex. Mermaids have trouble retaining human form in water, but nothing but the bed?  
  
  He shook his head.  
  
  Standard positions, too? I made it a question.  
  
  He nodded.  
  
  My eyes widened. Oh, Jason, Im sorry, I didnt know. I hugged him tighter.  
  
  He moved back so he could see my face. With all the bad news Ive had today, and you look that stricken that my girlfriend would only do standard bed sex?  
  
  I tried to put into words what I was thinking, not always my best thing. You love sex. Youre good at it.  
  
  Why, gee, thanks. He grinned.  
  
  I gave him a look, but kept talking. I was going to finish this thought, damn it. Sex is one of the most personal things we do as people. To have someone who says she loves you limit how you express yourself in the bedroom is like a small death. It kills the soul.  
  
  The grin left his face, then his eyes. He stared at me, and there Jason was, that part of him thaTHE hid from most people. Heck, thaTHE hid most of the time. He let me see that there was a good mind and a deep thinker inside those usually smiling blue eyes. It made him look sad, and older, but I valued that look. I valued thaTHE let me see him all the way down.  
  
  How did you get to be so smart? he said, softly.  
  
  I have smart friends who give me good advice sometimes. I smiled. Sometimes I even take it.  
  
  He smiled back and ran his hands down my back. So, youd really let me pick where we make love?  
  
  I nodded.  
  
  Just because I havent had a choice in a while.  
  
  Yes.  
  
  What if I want something too freaky?  
  
  Then Ill say no, and you can back it down a little.  
  
  His eyes had that solemn look again. He searched my face. You mean it.  
  
  I put my hands on either side of his face and nodded. I try not to say things I dont mean, Jason. I put a soft kiss at the end of the sentence.  
  
  He moved his hand lower on my back to press us closer together. Close enough that I could feel that his body was already happier than when we hugged last.  
  
  He closed his eyes and took a breath. He looked at Nathaniel. Do you have a preference?  
  
  Youre the guest.  
  
  Jason lifted me off the floor with a hug. We were both short enough that I was in no danger of hitting the doorjamb. I love you guys; you make me feel less weird about myself.  
  
  Why, because were weirder? I asked.  
  
  No, he said, laughing up at me, because your relationship works. It just flat works for you guys. You make me feel that out there somewhere is someone weird enough to make me happy.  
  
  Id rather not do the bathroom, Nathaniel said, it takes forever to dry my hair.  
  
  Jason let me down, so I was standing on the floor again. Im leaning toward the living room.  
  
  There are chairs, and the couch has a back and arms, Nathaniel said.  
  
  How sturdy is the coffee table?  
  
  Not that sturdy, Nathaniel said.  
  
  Id caught on. No, not sturdy enough to have sex on.  
  
  Start in the living room, move to the bedroom? Jason said, making it a question.  
  
  I looked at Nathaniel. He nodded, and gave a little shrug.  
  
  Deal, I said.  
Chapter 2  
  
  THEY HAD A disagreement on whether I should leave my heels on or take them off. Nathaniel voted for on; Jason wanted off. Jasons point was, I want to go down on her, and the heels will hurt.  
  
  Nathaniels point was, Yeah, the heels hurt, whats your point?  
  
  I settled the argument this way. Whoever is doing the oral sex on me gets his preference on the shoes.  
  
  Lose the shoes, Jason said, and there was a look in his face that tightened things low in my body without him touching me at all.  
  
  I lost the shoes. They lay on their side in the dimness of the living room. The only light was what spilled in from the kitchen doorway. I stood in front of the couch, while they moved the coffee table far to one side of the room.  
  
  Jason came back and dropped to his knees in front of me. He gazed up at me with one half of his face lit, the other in darkness. The look in the one eye I could clearly see made me shiver.  
  
  Nathaniel came to the end of the couch and took his shorts off in one smooth motion. My pulse was in my throat at the sight of him nude in the darkened room. He let the shorts fall to the floor.  
  
  Jasons hands slid up my legs, underneath my skirt, and I was back to staring down at him. His hands caressed the hose up to my thighs, went up, oh, so gently, until he found the lace tops of the thigh highs. He traced the very top of the lace, trailing fingertips over the rise and fall of the fabric. He rolled fingers back and forth where the hose elastic had rolled down in back. No matter how careful you were, if you had any thighs at all, the hose always did that. BuTHE treated it like what it was, not an imperfection, but something different to play with.  
  
  His fingers slid around that edge, brushing the very upper edges of my thighs. He rubbed his thumbs on that warm inside hollow that frames a womans groin. He massaged my thighs, but it was the pressure of his thumbs that helped draw my legs farther apart. So he could reach whaTHE wanted, and what I wanted him to reach.  
  
  Nathaniel came in behind me. Without the coffee table there was room enough between me and the couch. His arms wrapped around me, pinning my arms against my upper body. The feel of his nakedness pressed against the back of my skirt was amazing. Then he let me feel the strength in his body, as he held me, held me so tight. It sped my pulse faster, caught my breath in my throat.  
  
  So strong, I whispered.  
  
  So trapped, he breathed against my face. He squeezed harder, just this side of bruising my arms against me. But I didnt tell him to stop. I loved knowing that I was trapped. If he had meant me harm, I couldnt have stopped him. My gun was trapped under my arm, digging into my body. All it would take was Jason to grab my legs and I was trapped.  
  
  I hadnt much liked that I enjoyed things like this. In fact, Id hated it. But lately, thanks in part to sharing emotions with Nathaniel, who loved bondage and submission, I was acknowledging that fantasy was okay. That I didnt need to analyze why in real life being trapped made me fight like hell and do all in my power to destroy the ones trapping me, but in sexual fantasy I liked being trapped, a little. In a safe place, with people I trusted, it was more than just exciting.  
  
  What are you doing up there to make her react like that? Jason asked. His hands had gone still against my thighs.  
  
  Holding her, very, very, tightly, Nathaniel said in a voice that showed the strain of holding me tight.  
  
  Jasons fingers suddenly dug into my flesh, from gentle to bruising in an instant.  
  
  I whispered, Yes.  
  
  Is that the game we want to play? he asked, and his voice had changed, too, deeper, darker, for lack of a better word.  
  
  I do, Nathaniel said.  
  
  Jasons fingers pressed harder into my thighs, so that I cried out, and told him, Enough, enough.  
  
  Thats her safe word, Nathaniel said.  
  
  Ive already stopped, Jason said.  
  
  But I havent stopped, have I? Nathaniel whispered.  
  
  No, I said, voice breathy. He was holding tight enough to be trapped, but not quite tight enough to hurt. It was a fine edge to walk, but Nathaniel knew how to walk it.  
  
  Do I rip the panties off, or take them off? Jason asked.  
  
  Rip, Nathaniel said, and it was almost a growl.  
  
  I said, Please.  
  
  Please what? Jason asked.  
  
  Off, I whispered.  
  
  He ripped the satin panties in one harsh move that jerked my body. Nathaniel tightened his grip on me, until it was hard to breathe.  
  
  I whispered, Ease up.  
  
  He eased until he was back where hed been. Tight, but not too tight. Trapped, but not hurt. Of all forms of sex that Id found, BDSM took the most trust, the most communication.  
  
  Jason pushed my skirt up until he bared me to the light from the kitchen. How rough can I be? There was no sex in the tone of his voice; he was truly asking.  
  
  Start easy, Nathaniel said, shell let you know.  
  
  I realized that Jason had never given me oral sex before. Id gone down on him, but hed never had a chance to return the favor. He used his hands to spread my thighs wider. He let me feel the strength in his hands, but not as hard as hed been when I told him to ease up. The sensation of being bound by the sheer strength of him was amazing. There was no need of ropes or chains when you could feel how terribly strong they both were.  
  
  Jasons hands were harsh, buTHE leaned in toward me as if he were going to give the gentlest of kisses. The juxtaposition of the harsh and the gentle left my mind not knowing how to react. Then his tongue slid across me, and there was no conflict, there was only sensation.  
  
  He dug his fingers into that space inside my thighs, so harsh, I cried out. He forced my legs farther apart. Nathaniel lifted me. I could feel his shoulders and chest flex until I was suddenly off the ground. It allowed Jason to spread my legs more, use the strength of his fingers to force me wider.  
  
  Jason plunged his tongue inside me, sudden and abrupt. I cried out for him, and he leaned back enough to gaze up the line of my body.  
  
  It was as if I could feel the weight of his gaze, because it made me look down at the same time he looked up.  
  
  God, he said, that look.  
  
  What look? I managed to say before Nathaniel squeezed harder and I had no breath to talk.  
  
  That look, Jason whispered, and lowered his mouth to my body. He kissed there as he had kissed my mouth, maybe a dozen times before. Most men dont kiss between your legs the same way they kiss your mouth, but Jason did. He kissed me just as thoroughly, as completely, as expertly. Then he began to do things that you couldnt do when you kiss a mouth. He licked and explored, trying different things, judging his progress by the sounds I made, and how much I writhed.  
  
  He didnt just find the spot and stay on it like it was a button; he explored every inch of me, biting the inside of my thighs between attentions.  
  
  Nathaniel held me through it all, sometimes so tight I couldnt breathe, sometimes just tight enough to let me feel his strength, and then he squeezed hard enough that my gun cut into me, and it felt as if he were trying to crush me. I cried out while I had breath, then all I could do was writhe.  
  
  Jason drew back enough to ask, Am I doing that, or you?  
  
  Me, Nathaniel said, and eased up so my breath came in a ragged gasp.  
  
  I managed to say, So strong.  
  
  I need to try harder, Jason said. He pulled down my hose and bit me, not a love bite, but bit me on the thigh.  
  
  I screamed for him.  
  
  He plunged his mouth between my legs, rougher this time. I writhed and cried out. He pressed teeth into the most intimate part of me. When I didnt tell him to stop, he worried at me with his mouth, his teeth, pulling and biting and licking. The pleasure began to build between my legs, like heat and pressure and the beginning flickers of orgasm like previews of the pleasure to come.  
  
  Nathaniel tightened his grip just as Jason pushed me over that last edge. The orgasm was one of those that came in waves, one after another as if as long as he kept sucking I would keep going. I shuddered and  
danced in their hands, cried out when Nathaniel let me, or gasped in breathless silence when he held me too tight for words.  
  
  Jason finished with a lick from front to back that made me cry out all over again. Still on his knees he said, That was fun.  
  
  Nathaniel braced, changing positions just a little. Fuck her.  
  
  Jason, still on his knees, said, While you hold her?  
  
  Yes, Nathaniel said, and it held an edge of bass growl that wasnt his normal voice.  
  
  Jason looked at me, the light from the kitchen glistening on his chin and mouth. Seeing him wet from me tightened things low in my body that had just had their fun, so it started a new wave of writhing.  
  
  Jason held my thighs while Nathaniel held the rest of me. When my body quieted, Jason laughed, that sound that is all male. Anita, are you okay with this?  
  
  Do it, I said, please, please  
  
  No, Nathaniel said, Im topping her tonight, its my permission you need.  
  
  Jason hesitated as if waiting for me to protest. There was a time when I would have, but Id been working at understanding Nathaniels idea of sex. Id found that some of the bondage and submission worked just dandy for me.  
  
  Jason said, You top us both?  
  
  We top Anita.  
  
  Jason smiled, but his eyes held something more serious than a smile. I always thought it would take at least two of us. Tell me what you want me to do.  
  
  Nathaniel said, Get a condom.  
Chapter 3  
  
  JASON PRESSED HIS fingers into the backs of my thighs, spreading my legs wider. Nathaniel squeezed me tight at the same time, as if hed crush my arms against my body. I made small, helpless noises for him. Jason lifted me minutely, getting the angle he wanted, then shoved himself inside me. There was nothing gentle about it, and I was wet enough I didnt need gentle.  
  
  The feel of him shoving himself into me, as hard and fast as he could, drove a sound from my mouth, but not the sound he wanted. He said, in a low, breathy voice, I cant get the angle I want.  
  
  What do you need? Nathaniel asked, from behind me. His voice wasnt breathy, but just deep.  
  
  Jason had stopped moving inside me, so I could think again. A new position, I said, my voice breathy, too.  
  
  Oh, Jason said, I am not doing my job if you can still talk. He put action to word and started moving, slowly, in and out of me.  
  
  It felt wonderful, but Jason was right, he needed a different angle to push me over that edge. I looked him in the eyes and said, in a clear voice, Youre right, this position isnt going to do it.  
  
  Jason laughed. He kissed me, and if he hadnt still been wet with my juices, I might have called it a friendly kiss. Some men would be insulted.  
  
  You arent some men. You like feedback, I said.  
  
  Nathaniel had stopped squeezing me, and was more just holding me. That helped me think, too. Do you want a new position? and he wasnt asking me.  
  
  Yes, Jason said.  
  
  I want to do one thing before we change, Nathaniel said.

1lo82wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/RetirementReady/comments/1lo82wc/market_crashproof_your_portfolio_lessons_from/,Market Crash-Proof Your Portfolio: Lessons from 2025’s Volatility,"**Hey, RetirementReady fam!** 🌟

Can we take a moment to talk about **2025's financial rollercoaster**? *I mean, who didn’t look at their phone one morning and gasp as the market took a tumble?* One minute you're riding high, sipping on that iced coffee, and the next—BOOM—your portfolio feels like it's in a free-fall. 😅

But here’s the kicker: while it felt like chaos, it also served up some solid lessons on how we can **market crash-proof our portfolios**. Let’s dig into what we learned from this crazy ride.

**1. Diversification is your best friend.**   
Imagine going to an ice cream shop with only one flavor (yikes!). Now, picture standing in front of **20** different flavors! 🎉 Diversifying your investments helps balance the risks. 
   - Stocks? Sure.
   - Bonds? Why not?
   - Maybe even a sprinkle of *some solid REITs*? (Real Estate Investment Trusts for the newbies in the back! 😂)

**2. Keep cash on hand.**  
There’s beauty in having some cash reserves. Think of it like keeping a spare tire in your car. You hope to never use it, but if you blow a tire on the highway—yikes, you’re glad you have it! *Having cash gives you the freedom to jump on opportunities when prices drop!* (Think of the sales we all love, am I right?)

**3. It’s not personal.**  
The market doesn’t secretly hate you (even though it might feel that way sometimes). The ups and downs are just part of the game. Remember that time when our portfolios dipped and we all panicked? Yeah, that was a collective “Yikes” moment. But one dip doesn’t define our long-term goals or success.

**4. Automate and forget.**  
If you're not reviewing your investments daily (which, let’s be real, is impossible!), consider automating contributions to your favorite accounts. Think of it like setting a reminder to take your vitamins each day. Out of sight, out of mind, but you’ll still reap the benefits when you need them!

**5. Learn from the pros (without getting overwhelmed).**  
There are countless ways to *stay informed* without going into full-on panic mode. Check out interesting resources, podcasts, or even friendly financial planners who can break things down. Seriously, how cool would it be to explain compound interest at a dinner party? 

While we’re diving into all things financial, let’s not forget our ultimate goal: **to empower ourselves to choose how we live as we age!** It’s all about building a future that lets us enjoy life to the fullest. If you're curious about more ways to achieve financial freedom, give this a glance [here](https://mavely.app.link/e/TuANm4vQCSb) – just sharing a little something that might help!

1lo82jg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1lo82jg/the_house_on_31st_street/,The House on 31st Street,">Rules to Survive (or disappear with dignity)

They say the house on 31st Street is a living thing. Not quite a creature, not quite a place — but a presence. A ritual with windows, which devours people one at a time.

The last person to enter left a note written in what appears to be dried blood mixed with blue paint. The paper was nailed down with a torn off nail.

Below were the rules.


---

Rule #1: Don't enter after 10pm.

The house sleeps during the day. But at night, she watches. If you cross the threshold after this time, you are accepting the rules of the game. And the game never ends well.

> ""AHHHHHHH! HELP!
SOMEONE HELP ME!”
Dull knocks and booms echo from the basement. No one should be there. And yet...




---

Rule #2: Lock the door three times — and only three times.

Once and it opens. Twice and she hesitates. Three times and it closes. Four times... and she invites the one on the other side to enter.


---

Rule #3: If you hear voices coming from the bathroom, don't respond.

It doesn't matter if the voice is similar to your mother's. Or with yours. They imitate. And if you respond, they will know the tone of your soul.

> ""AAAAAAH! HELP!
PLEASE SOMEONE SAVE ME!”
The words reverberate behind the mirror. But the mirror is empty.




---

Rule #4: Don't eat anything offered inside the house.

Not apples, not coffee, not tap water. Food there doesn't feed — it replaces. Every bite takes something from you and gives something from the house in return.


---

Rule #5: Ignore the room with the door ajar.

Yes, the one with the blinking light and the soaked carpet. If you look for more than three seconds, something on the other side will see you too.


---

Rule #6: If you hear rhythmic beats like a war drum, hide.

Don't breathe loudly. Don't move.
Wait for the three BANG, BADAMUB, BANG!
If you hear a fourth sound, close your eyes.
If you don't hear anything else...

> ""NOW DON'T YOU CRY ANYMORE?""
The whispered phrase cuts through the silence like a blade.
Finally, the noise stops.




---

Rule #7: Never try to leave through the front door.

She takes him to the same place... but with everything wrong. His reflection on the other side smiles, but his teeth don't chatter. The eyes are at impossible angles.


---

Rule #8: If you find another version of yourself, kill it.

She already tried to do the same to you yesterday.


---

Rule #9: The stairs change after midnight.

You go up three steps and go down five floors. The handrail bleeds. Sometimes you breathe. Never touch it with both hands.


---

Rule #10: If you hear an engine starting, run.

It doesn't matter where.
The sound is slow, organic, like something spinning inside flesh.
Anyone who listens to the engine up close never screams again.

> Stagnation. Panting.
Silence.
An engine starts.




---

Rule #11: When leaving, don't look back.

Even if you hear footsteps. Even if they call your name in the perfect voice of someone who has already died.
If you look... the house invites you to stay.


---

Final note, written with the deformed fingers of someone who tried to crawl out:

""The rules kept me alive for three nights. The eighth was broken and now I am two.
One of me still screams at the ceiling.
The other writes it with his teeth.""

1lo81k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lo81k3/112263_by_stephen_king/,11/22/63 by Stephen King:,"CHAPTER 1  
  
  1  
  
  Harry Dunning graduated with flying colors. I went to the little GED ceremony in the LHS gym, at his invitation. He really had no one else, and I was happy to do it.  
  
  After the benediction (spoken by Father Bandy, who rarely missed an LHS function), I made my way through the milling friends and relatives to where Harry was standing alone in his billowy black gown, holding his diploma in one hand and his rented mortarboard in the other. I took his hat so I could shake his hand. He grinned, exposing a set of teeth with many gaps and several leaners. But a sunny and engaging grin, for all that.  
  
  ""Thanks for coming, Mr. Epping. Thanks so much.""  
  
  ""It was my pleasure. And you can call me Jake. It's a little perk I accord to students who are old enough to be my father.""  
  
  He looked puzzled for a minute, then laughed. ""I guess I am, ain't I? Sheesh!"" I laughed, too. Lots of people were laughing all around us. And there were tears, of course. What's hard for me comes easily to a great many people.  
  
  ""And that A-plus! Sheesh! I never got an A-plus in my whole life! Never expected one, either!""  
  
  ""You deserved it, Harry. So what's the first thing you're going to do as a high school graduate?""  
  
  His smile dimmed for a second--this was a prospect he hadn't considered. ""I guess I'll go back home. I got a little house I rent on Goddard Street, you know."" He raised the diploma, holding it carefully by the fingertips, as if the ink might smear. ""I'll frame this and hang it on the wall. Then I guess I'll pour myself a glass of wine and sit on the couch and just admire it until bedtime.""  
  
  ""Sounds like a plan,"" I said, ""but would you like to have a burger and some fries with me first? We could go down to Al's.""  
  
  I expected a wince at that, but of course I was judging Harry by my colleagues. Not to mention most of the kids we taught; they avoided Al's like the plague and tended to patronize either the Dairy Queen across from the school or the Hi-Hat out on 196, near where the old Lisbon Drive-In used to be.  
  
  ""That'd be great, Mr. Epping. Thanks!""  
  
  ""Jake, remember?""  
  
  ""Jake, you bet.""  
  
  So I took Harry to Al's, where I was the only faculty regular, and although he actually had a waitress that summer, Al served us himself. As usual, a cigarette (illegal in public eating establishments, but that never stopped Al) smoldered in one corner of his mouth and the eye on that side squinted against the smoke. When he saw the folded-up graduation robe and realized what the occasion was, he insisted on picking up the check (what check there was; the meals at Al's were always remarkably cheap, which had given rise to rumors about the fate of certain stray animals in the vicinity). He also took a picture of us, which he later hung on what he called the Town Wall of Celebrity. Other ""celebrities"" represented included the late Albert Dunton, founder of Dunton Jewelry; Earl Higgins, a former LHS principal; John Crafts, founder of John Crafts Auto Sales; and, of course, Father Bandy of St. Cyril's. (The Father was paired with Pope John XXIII--the latter not local, but revered by Al Templeton, who called himself ""a good Catlick."") The picture Al took that day showed Harry Dunning with a big smile on his face. I was standing next to him, and we were both holding his diploma. His tie was pulled slightly askew. I remember that because it made me think of those little squiggles he put on the ends of his lower-case y's. I remember it all. I remember it very well.  
  
  2  
  
  Two years later, on the last day of the school year, I was sitting in that very same teachers' room and reading my way through a batch of final essays my American Poetry honors seminar had written. The kids themselves had already left, turned loose for another summer,  
and soon I would do the same. But for the time being I was happy enough where I was, enjoying the unaccustomed quiet. I thought I might even clean out the snack cupboard before I left. Someone ought to do it, I thought.  
  
  Earlier that day, Harry Dunning had limped up to me after homeroom period (which had been particularly screechy, as all homerooms and study halls tend to be on the last day of school) and offered me his hand.  
  
  ""I just want to thank you for everything,"" he said.  
  
  I grinned. ""You already did that, as I remember.""  
  
  ""Yeah, but this is my last day. I'm retiring. So I wanted to make sure and thank you again.""  
  
  As I shook his hand, a kid cruising by--no more than a sophomore, judging by the fresh crop of pimples and the serio-comic straggle on his chin that aspired to goateehood--muttered, ""Hoptoad Harry, hoppin down the av-a-new.""  
  
  I grabbed for him, my intention to make him apologize, but Harry stopped me. His smile was easy and unoffended. ""Nah, don't bother. I'm used to it. They're just kids.""  
  
  ""That's right,"" I said. ""And it's our job to teach them.""  
  
  ""I know, and you're good at it. But it's not my job to be anybody's whatchacallit--teachable moment. Especially not today. I hope you'll take care of yourself, Mr. Epping."" He might be old enough to be my father, but Jake was apparently always going to be beyond him.  
  
  ""You too, Harry.""  
  
  ""I'll never forget that A-plus. I framed that, too. Got it right up beside my diploma.""  
  
  ""Good for you.""  
  
  And it was. It was all good. His essay had been primitive art, but every bit as powerful and true as any painting by Grandma Moses. It was certainly better than the stuff I was currently reading. The spelling in the honors essays was mostly correct, and the diction was clear (although my cautious college-bound don't-take-a-chancers had an irritating tendency to fall back on the passive voice), but the writing was pallid. Boring. My honors kids were juniors--Mac Steadman, the department head, awarded the seniors to himself--but they wrote like little old men and little old ladies, all pursey-mouthed and ooo, don't slip on that icy patch, Mildred. In spite of his grammatical lapses and painstaking cursive, Harry Dunning had written like a hero. On one occasion, at least.

  
As I was musing on the difference between offensive and defensive writing, the intercom on the wall cleared its throat. ""Is Mr. Epping in the west wing teachers' room? You by any chance still there, Jake?""  
  
  I got up, thumbed the button, and said: ""Still here, Gloria. For my sins. Can I help you?""  
  
  ""You have a phone call. Guy named Al Templeton? I can transfer it, if you want. Or I can tell him you left for the day.""  
  
  Al Templeton, owner and operator of Al's Diner, where all LHS faculty save for yours truly refused to go. Even my esteemed department head--who tried to talk like a Cambridge don and was approaching retirement age himself--had been known to refer to the specialty of the house as Al's Famous Catburger instead of Al's Famous Fatburger.  
  
  Well of course it's not really cat, people would say, or probably not cat, but it can't be beef, not at a dollar-nineteen.  
  
  ""Jake? Did you fall asleep on me?""  
  
  ""Nope, wide awake."" Also curious as to why Al would call me at school. Why he'd call me at all, for that matter. Ours had always been strictly a cook-and-client relationship. I appreciated his chow, and he appreciated my patronage. ""Go on and put him through.""  
  
  ""Why are you still here, anyway?""  
  
  ""I'm flagellating myself.""  
  
  ""Ooo!"" Gloria said, and I could imagine her fluttering her long lashes. ""I love it when you talk dirty. Hold on and wait for the ringy-dingy.""  
  
  She clicked off. The extension rang and I picked it up.  
  
  ""Jake? You on there, buddy?""  
  
  At first I thought Gloria must have gotten the name wrong. That voice couldn't belong to Al. Not even the world's worst cold could have produced such a croak.  
  
  ""Who is this?""  
  
  ""Al Templeton, didn't she tellya? Christ, that hold music really sucks. Whatever happened to Connie Francis?"" He began to ratchet coughs loud enough to make me hold the phone away from my ear a little.  
  
  ""You sound like you got the flu.""  
  
  He laughed. He also kept coughing. The combination was fairly gruesome. ""I got something, all right.""  
  
  ""It must have hit you fast."" I had been in just yesterday, to grab an early supper. A Fatburger, fries, and a strawberry milkshake. I believe it's important for a guy living on his own to hit all the major food groups.  
  
  ""You could say that. Or you could say it took awhile. Either one would be right.""  
  
  I didn't know how to respond to that. I'd had a lot of conversations with Al in the six or seven years I'd been going to the diner, and he could be odd--insisted on referring to the New England Patriots as the Boston Patriots, for instance, and talked about Ted Williams as if he'd known him like a brudda--but I'd never had a conversation as weird as this.  
  
  ""Jake, I need to see you. It's important.""  
  
  ""Can I ask--""  
  
  ""I expect you to ask plenty, and I'll answer, but not over the phone.""  
  
  I didn't know how many answers he'd be able to give before his voice gave out, but I promised I'd come down in an hour or so.  
  
  ""Thanks. Make it even sooner, if you can. Time is, as they say, of the essence."" And he hung up, just like that, without even a goodbye.  
  
  I worked my way through two more of the honors essays, and there were only four more in the stack, but it was no good. I'd lost my groove. So I swept the stack into my briefcase and left. It crossed my mind to go upstairs to the office and wish Gloria a good summer, but I didn't bother. She'd be in all next week, closing the books on another school year, and I was going to come in on Monday and clean out the snack cupboard--that was a promise I'd made to myself. Otherwise the teachers who used the west wing teachers' room during summer session would find it crawling with bugs.  
  
  If I'd known what the future held for me, I certainly would have gone up to see her. I might even have given her the kiss that had been flirting in the air between us for the last couple of months. But of course I didn't know. Life turns on a dime.  
  
  3  
  
  Al's Diner was housed in a silver trailer across the tracks from Main Street, in the shadow of the old Worumbo mill. Places like that can look tacky, but Al had disguised the concrete blocks upon which his establishment stood with pretty beds of flowers. There was even a neat square of lawn, which he barbered himself with an old push-type lawn mower. The lawn mower was as well tended as the flowers and the lawn; not a speck of rust on the whirring, brightly painted blades. It might have been purchased at the local Western Auto store the week before . . . if there had still been a Western Auto in The Falls, that was. There was once, but it fell victim to the big-box stores back around the turn of the century.  
  
  I went up the paved walk, up the steps, then paused, frowning. The sign reading WELCOME TO AL'S DINER, HOME OF THE FATBURGER! was gone. In its place was a square of cardboard reading CLOSED & WILL NOT REOPEN DUE TO ILLNESS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR BUSINESS OVER THE YEARS & GOD BLESS.  
  
  I had not yet entered the fog of unreality that would soon swallow me, but the first tendrils were seeping around me, and I felt them. It wasn't a summer cold that had caused the hoarseness I'd heard in Al's voice, nor the croaking cough. Not the flu, either. Judging by the sign, it was something more serious. But what kind of serious illness came on in a mere twenty-four hours? Less than that, really. It was two-thirty. I had left Al's last night at five forty-five, and he'd been fine. Almost manic, in fact. I remembered asking him if he'd been drinking too much of his own coffee, and he said no, he was just thinking about taking a vacation. Do people who are getting sick--sick enough to close the businesses they've run single-handed for over twenty years--talk about taking vacations? Some, maybe, but probably not many.  
  
  The door opened while I was still reaching for the handle, and Al stood there looking at me, not smiling. I looked back, feeling that fog of unreality thicken around me. The day was warm but the fog was cold. At that point I still could have turned and walked out of it, back into the June sunshine, and part of me wanted to do that. Mostly, though, I was frozen by wonder and dismay. Also horror, I might as well admit it. Because serious illness does horrify us, doesn't it, and Al was seriously ill. I could see that in a single glance. And mortally was probably more like it.  
  
  It wasn't just that his normally ruddy cheeks had gone slack and sallow. It wasn't the rheum that coated his blue eyes, which now looked washed-out and nearsightedly peering. It wasn't even his hair, formerly almost all black, and now almost all white--after all, he might have been using one of those vanity products and decided on the spur of the moment to shampoo it out and go natural.  
  
  The impossible part was that in the twenty-two hours since I'd last seen him, Al Templeton appeared to have lost at least thirty pounds. Maybe even forty, which would have been a quarter of his previous body weight. Nobody loses thirty or forty pounds in less than a day, nobody. But I was looking at it. And this, I think, is where that fog of unreality swallowed me whole.  
  
  Al smiled, and I saw he had lost teeth as well as weight. His gums looked pale and unhealthy. ""How do you like the new me, Jake?"" And he began to cough, thick chaining sounds that came from deep inside him.  
  
  I opened my mouth. No words came out. The idea of flight again came to some craven, disgusted part of my mind, but even if that part had been in control, I couldn't have done it. I was rooted to the spot.  
  
  Al got the coughing under control and pulled a handkerchief from his back pocket. He wiped first his mouth and then the palm of his hand with it. Before he put it back, I saw it was streaked with red.  
  
  ""Come in,"" he said. ""I've got a lot to talk about, and I think you're the only one who might listen. Will you listen?""  
  
  ""Al,"" I said. My voice was so low and strengthless I could hardly hear it myself. ""What's happened to you?""  
  
  ""Will you listen?""  
  
  ""Of course.""  
  
  ""You'll have questions, and I'll answer as many as I can, but try to keep them to a minimum. I don't have much voice left. Hell, I don't have much strength left. Come on in here.""  
  
  I came in. The diner was dark and cool and empty. The counter was polished and crumbless; the c  
hrome on the stools gleamed; the coffee urn was polished to a high gloss; the sign reading IF YOU DON'T LIKE OUR TOWN, LOOK FOR A TIMETABLE was in its accustomed place by the Sweda register. The only thing missing was the customers.  
  
  Well, and the cook-proprietor, of course. Al Templeton had been replaced by an elderly, ailing ghost. When he turned the door's thumb-latch, locking us in, the sound was very loud.  
  
  4  
  
  ""Lung cancer,"" he said matter-of-factly, after leading us to a booth at the far end of the diner. He tapped the pocket of his shirt, and I saw it was empty. The ever-present pack of Camel straights was gone. ""No big surprise. I started when I was eleven, and smoked right up to the day I got the diagnosis. Over fifty damn years. Three packs a day until the price went way up in '07. Then I made a sacrifice and cut back to two a day."" He laughed wheezily.  
  
  I thought of telling him that his math had to be wrong, because I knew his actual age. When I'd come in one day in the late winter and asked him why he was working the grill with a kid's birthday hat on, he'd said Because today I'm fifty-seven, buddy. Which makes me an official Heinz. But he'd asked me not to ask questions unless I absolutely had to, and I assumed the request included not butting in to make corrections.  
  
  ""If I were you--and I wish I was, although I'd never wish being me on you, not in my current situation--I'd be thinking, 'Something's screwy here, nobody gets advanced lung cancer overnight.' Is that about right?""  
  
  I nodded. That was exactly right.  
  
  ""The answer is simple enough. It wasn't overnight. I started coughing my brains out about seven months ago, back in May.""  
  
  This was news to me; if he'd been doing any coughing, it hadn't been while I was around. Also, he was doing that bad-math thing again. ""Al, hello? It's June. Seven months ago it was December.""  
  
  He waved a hand at me--the fingers thin, his Marine Corps ring hanging on a digit that used to clasp it cozily--as if to say Pass that by for now, just pass it.  
  
  ""At first I thought I just had a bad cold. But there was no fever, and instead of going away, the cough got worse. Then I started losing weight. Well, I ain't stupid, buddy, and I always knew the big C might be in the cards for me . . . although my father and mother smoked like goddam chimneys and lived into their eighties. I guess we always find excuses to keep on with our bad habits, don't we?""  
  
  He started coughing again, and pulled out the handkerchief. When the hacking subsided, he said: ""I can't get off on a sidetrack, but I've been doing it my whole life and it's hard to stop. Harder than stopping with the cigarettes, actually. Next time I start wandering off-course, just kind of saw a finger across your throat, would you?""  
  
  ""Okay,"" I said, agreeably enough. It had occurred to me by then that I was dreaming all of this. If so, it was an extremely vivid dream, right down to the shadows thrown by the revolving ceiling fan, marching across the place mats reading OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSET IS YOU!  
  
  ""Long story short, I went to a doctor and got an X-ray, and there they were, big as billy-be-damned. Two tumors. Advanced necrosis. Inoperable.""  
  
  An X-ray, I thought--did they still use those to diagnose cancer?  
  
  ""I hung in for awhile, but in the end I had to come back.""  
  
  ""From where? Lewiston? Central Maine General?""  
  
  ""From my vacation."" His eyes looked fixedly at me from the dark hollows into which they were disappearing. ""Except it was no vacation.""  
  
  ""Al, none of this makes any sense to me. Yesterday you were here and you were fine.""  
  
  ""Take a good close look at my face. Start with my hair and work your way down. Try to ignore what the cancer's doing to me--it plays hell with a person's looks, no doubt about that--and then tell me I'm the same man you saw yesterday.""  
  
  ""Well, you obviously washed the dye out--""  
  
  ""Never used any. I won't bother directing your attention to the teeth I lost while I was . . . away. I know you saw those. You think an X-ray machine did that? Or strontium-90 in the milk? I don't even drink milk, except for a splash in my last cup of coffee of the day.""  
  
  ""Strontium what?""  
  
  ""Never mind. Get in touch with your, you know, feminine side. Look at me the way women look at other women when they're judging age.""  
  
  I tried to do what he said, and while what I observed would never have stood up in court, it convinced me. There were webworks of lines spraying out from the corners of his eyes, and the lids had the tiny, delicately ruffled wrinkles you see on people who no longer have to flash their Senior Discount Cards when they step up to the multiplex box office. Skin-grooves that hadn't been there yesterday evening now made sine-waves across Al's brow. Two more lines--much deeper ones--bracketed his mouth. His chin was sharper, and the skin on his neck had grown loose. The sharp chin and wattled throat could have been caused by Al's catastrophic weight loss, but those lines . . . and if he wasn't lying about his hair . . .  
  
  He was smiling a little. It was a grim smile, but not without actual humor. Which somehow made it worse. ""Remember my birthday last March? 'Don't worry, Al,' you said, 'if that stupid party hat catches on fire while you're hanging over the grill, I'll grab the fire extinguisher and put you out.' Remember that?""  
  
  I did. ""You said you were an official Heinz.""  
  
  ""So I did. And now I'm sixty-two. I know the cancer makes me look even older, but these . . . and these . . ."" He touched his forehead, then the corner of one eye. ""These are authentic age-tattoos. Badges of honor, in a way.""  
  
  ""Al . . . can I have a glass of water?""  
  
  ""Of course. Shock, isn't it?"" He looked at me sympathetically. ""You're thinking, 'Either I'm crazy, he's crazy, or we both are.' I know. I've been there.""  
  
  He levered himself out of the booth with an effort, his right hand going up beneath his left armpit, as if he were trying to hold himself together, somehow. Then he led me around the counter. As he did so, I put my finger on another element of this unreal encounter: except for the occasions when I shared a pew with him at St. Cyril's (these were rare; although I was raised in the faith, I'm not much of a Catlick) or happened to meet him on the street, I'd never seen Al out of his cook's apron.  
  
  He took a sparkling glass down and drew me a glass of water from a sparkling chrome-plated tap. I thanked him and turned to go back to the booth, but he tapped me on the shoulder. I wish he hadn't done that. It was like being tapped by Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, who stoppeth one of three.  
  
  ""I want you to see something before we sit down again. It'll be quicker that way. Only seeing isn't the right word. I guess experiencing is a lot closer. Drink up, buddy.""  
  
  I drank half the water. It was cool and good, but I never took my eye off him. That craven part of me was expecting to be jumped, like the first unwitting victim in one of those maniac-on-the-loose movies that always seem to have numbers in their titles. But Al only stood there with one hand propped on the counter. The hand was wrinkled, the knuckles big. It didn't look like the hand of a man in his fifties, even one with cancer, and--  
  
  ""Did the radiation do that?"" I asked suddenly.  
  
  ""Do what?""  
  
  ""You have a tan. Not to mention those dark spots on the backs of your hands. You get those either from radiation or too much sun.""  
  
  ""Well, since I haven't had any radiation treatments, that leaves the sun. I've gotten quite a lot of it over the last four years.""  
  
  So far as I knew, Al had spent most of the last four years flipping burgers and making milkshakes under fluorescent lights, but I didn't say so. I just drank the rest of my water. When I set the glass down on the Formica counter, I noticed my hand was shaking slightly.  
  
  ""Okay, what is it you want me to see? Or to experience?""  
  
  ""Come this way.""  
  
  He led me down the long, narrow galley area, past the double grill, the Fry-O-Lators, the sink, the FrostKing fridge, and the humming waist-high freezer. He stopped in front of the silent dishwasher and pointed to the door at the far end of the kitchen. It was low; Al would have to duck his head going through it, and he was only five-seven or so. I'm six-four--some of the kids  
called me Helicopter Epping.  
  
  ""That's it,"" he said. ""Through that door.""  
  
  ""Isn't that your pantry?"" Strictly a rhetorical question; I'd seen him bring out enough cans, sacks of potatoes, and bags of dry goods over the years to know damn well what it was.  
  
  Al seemed not to have heard. ""Did you know I originally opened this joint in Auburn?""  
  
  ""No.""  
  
  He nodded, and just that was enough to kick off another bout of coughing. He stifled it with the increasingly gruesome handkerchief. When the latest fit finally tapered off, he tossed the handkerchief into a handy trash can, then grabbed a swatch of napkins from a dispenser on the counter.  
  
  ""It's an Aluminaire, made in the thirties and as art deco as they come. Wanted one ever since my dad took me to the Chat 'N Chew in Bloomington, back when I was a kid. Bought it fully outfitted and opened up on Pine Street. I was at that location for almost a year, and I saw that if I stayed, I'd be bankrupt in another year. There were too many other quick-bite joints in the neighborhood, some good, some not so good, all of em with their regulars. I was like a kid fresh out of law school who hangs out his shingle in a town that already has a dozen well-established shysters. Also, in those days Al's Famous Fatburger sold for two-fifty. Even back in 1990 two and a half was the best I could do.""  
  
  ""Then how in hell do you sell it for less than half that now? Unless it really is cat.""  
  
  He snorted, a sound that produced a phlegmy echo of itself deep in his chest. ""Buddy, what I sell is a hundred percent pure American beef, the best in the world. Do I know what people say? Sure. I shrug it off. What else can you do? Stop people from talking? You might as well try to stop the wind from blowing.""  
  
  I ran a finger across my throat. Al smiled.  
  
  ""Yeah, gettin off on one of those sidetracks, I know, but at least this one's part of the story.  
  
  ""I could have kept beating my head against the wall on Pine Street, but Yvonne Templeton didn't raise any fools. 'Better to run away and fight again some other day,' she used to tell us kids. I took the last of my capital, wheedled the bank into loaning me another five grand--don't ask me how--and moved here to The Falls. Business still hasn't been great, not with the economy the way it is and not with all that stupid talk about Al's Cat burgers or Dog burgers or Skunk burgers or whatever tickles people's fancy, but it turns out I'm no longer tied to the economy the way other people are. And it's all because of what's behind that pantry door. It wasn't there when I was set up in Auburn, I'd swear to that on a stack of Bibles ten feet high. It only showed up here.""

1lo80pa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricVehiclesUK/comments/1lo80pa/strictly_public_charging_it_is_possible/,Strictly public charging - it is possible?,"Hi there, I'm in a position where I might be able to get a VW id3 for a low cost. My current car is, to be honest, on its last legs and I don't particularly enjoy driving it (or any other manual). I am renting a house so no home charging available - it's quite an old place and I don't think I'd feel comfortable using a 3-pin charger.

I do however have a 150 kW public charger <5 mins from my house, at a shopping centre where I can do my grocery shopping or have a coffee, though the charge is 55p per kWhr (off-peak).

I appreciate this kind of thread gets posted a lot, but I've read a lot of them and none seem particularly similar to my situation. So my questions are:

1) It is worth it economically given the higher charging fees, but also taking into account the repairs on my old ICE and fuel costs?
2) If not, how safe is using a granny cable to charge? Could I leave it overnight without worrying about burning the house down?

I'm pretty set on getting the car, especially with such a good deal, but I am concerned about the charging situation. It's worth noting I don't drive much, maybe 2 twenty minute trips?

I prefer to plan my charitable giving by researching exactly whom I'm giving to, what it's used for, and also do so in a tax advantaged way - which means I can give more. I also run a nonprofit and I wouldn't solicit donations in random coffee shops. (We don't solicit at all and only work with a donor if they explicitly approach us first.)

A more honest tip prompt would have a donation screen that says ""Do you want to donate to the owners of this business? Donations will be used to facilitate paying our employees lower wages.""",3,1751291274.0,EndTipping,0,1.0,False
1lo7yue,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1lo7yue/ms_alfred/,[MS] Alfred,"What is a story? 

Okay.  Pre googling its words and paragraphs in order to convey events or telling facts through an engaging medium.  

A series of thoughts told or written down to create a story.

Here's what Googles definition is in its summary 

A story is a narrative, either true or fictional, that recounts a series of related events. It can be presented through words, images, or a combination of both. Stories are a fundamental part of human culture, used for entertainment, education, and cultural preservation.

The part that stood out are the why's. 

Here's more stuff from the internet. 

A well-crafted story can evoke emotions, create connections, and offer insights into the human experience. 

I have failed to engage in fiction stories in these manners myself. Rarely do I read a story and look at it from emotions or creating connections or offer insights into the human experience.

So.  What stories are literature do I enjoy consuming. 

The first question is what is the difference between literature and stories 

Okay googling that hurt my head.

So now. 

Okay its a collection of writings that is to be considered art and also recently it expanded to oral literature 

So now, all of that aside.  

We have two paths.  The first one is to attempt to create a story to attempt to see how hard it is to make something. 

There is a man named Alfred. Alfred you see is a particular type of man.  He only eats oatmeal when the sun is rising, he likes he's coffee exactly 89 degrees and he must blink twice before drinking anything. 

So I could have done a lot with this paragraph. 

I could have give it some more flare.  I could have gone down the route of more interesting particular items. But eight now my own emotional safety was to keep it kosher.   Like salt.  

The real interesting thing is that I thought the most interesting fact was about him eating oatmeal.

My brain has this want to create something different and exciting. Plot twists.  But this story is going to be boring. 

Alfred enjoys a specific brand you see. The same brand he's been eating for 200 years.  Its called Laker Crumb Toast. On this morning he created his laker crumb toast in the same way he's always done. 


Well now you see as the author I want to go ahead and describe this process to you ignoring the fact that Alfred is 200 years old. 

Heres the interesting part.  When reading this story it's meant to keep the direction everywhere. You see as a pretty standard reader I expect you to have already form a conclusion and all im doing is providing details you might already know.   But you see im in control and what ways will this turn out.  As the story of Alfred in my mind is already gone. 

We never really wonder the pictures in our minds when we are dopamine starved.  We don't have time to engage with the words when we have adhd. We just consume. 

Well Alfred was anti consumption in his bones, you see, well maybe except for this same oatmeal he's eaten now everyday.  For, what, the last 200 years?  As you see Alfred cannot comprehend the sunrise going down, he's never thought about eating his oatmeal when the sun has risen. 

Well you see now. Consuming would have made us state the obvious.  What if its because the sun only rises.  But as soon as we know this information, stated by me, Alfred cat, then we would just know that as fact.

As a cat I would like to know this information ahead of time. As it helps build emotions safety and I would like you, the author, to spell it out for me.  For once of course I miss the connection. 

Why do we assume our connection is not unique.  That your understanding of the story about you feel about is the as every sunrise. Why does it need to get validated through a lense of commonality. 

Coming back to another sunrise. Alfred and his cat, which is me; the story teller but not the author, are here. Not questioning our oatmeal choice, eating the third bite without words needed to be processed.   But what is Alfred thinking?  Does he think?  

Today something is a bit off though.  I cannot put my finger on it.

Breville Barista Touch to Lelit Anna.,"Some years ago I got a Sage/Breville Barista Touch as my first setup. I thought the integrated grinder and touchscreen with instructions would be a great help as a newbie. For the first espresso it was nice to have the instructions on screen but having them on my phone would have been equally helpful. And now it’s lacking the options to have a manual workflow. It’s just turn on, select espresso, grind and puck prep and press start. Way too r/superautomatic in my opinion. It’s boring.

Would you call getting the Lelit Anna PL41TEM + Eureka Mignon Specialita a downgrade or an upgrade? The Lelit Anna is often called a ""beginner"" machine but I don’t see the benefits of a more expensive one. 

- I don’t want to spend a fortune on my setup
- I don’t need a dual boiler (no milk, mostly Espresso or Long Black)
- I don’t need fast heat up
- I don’t need to pull multiple shots back to back (only one to drink coffee in my household)
- Breville/Sage has a 54mm basket so I need new accessories anyway
- I think the pressure gauge is a neat addition

What’s the benefit of buying a more expensive machine in my case? Or do you see any other machine which would fit my use case?

I’m an artistic, soft-hearted, and very open-minded person. I love photography, cozy conversations, girly energy, emotional support friendships, and deep talks. My vibe is a mix of emotionally unstable virgo moments, Taylor Swift lyrics, and spontaneous dancing in the kitchen😂 I’m also a ""gamer"" (Valorant girlie) and I'm trying to learn german bit by bit so I can fit in better. I’m currently unemployed because I recently quit from a very toxic company I worked for, but planning to work on my dreams and build my life slowly there with love and care. I’m really looking to meet some wonderful women around my age who want to build real friendships-the kind where you text each other when you see something funny, go for walks, try cute coffee shops, or just chill in silence when the world gets too loud. If you’ve ever felt like the “emotional one” in your friend group or like you just want a small, meaningful circle... then we’ll probably click really well. Drop a message or comment if you’d like to connect🫶 Whether you’re also new there or a longtime local, I’d love to hear from you. Thank you for reading, and I'm sending love from my little corner of Serbia for now🥰

In connection with the fact that in Russia state bodies do not protect the rights of the convicted person, and my rights, when for the protection of the rights of convicted persons, convicted persons slander me in court, I believe that, on the orders of officials, in order to intimidate me and so that I stop protecting the rights of prisoners, I appeal to you to protect my rights and the rights of Vladislav Yuryevich Shlykov, to involve the media and a human rights organization, since it is dangerous to live in Russia, and it is impossible to achieve fair justice.**Crime report Shlykov Vladislav Yuryevich**

Serving a life sentence in FKU IK No. 6 UGFSIN of Russia Khabarovsk Krai, Elban settlement, Amursky District, Khabarovsk Krai. 682610.

**Crime scene: FKU IK No. 2 OUHD GUFSIN of Russia Perm Krai, Solikamsk.**

**Dear defense attorney, Demin Yuri Nikolaevich!**

I am reporting the hellish conditions in which I was held in the Federal Penitentiary Institution No. 2 of the Main Directorate of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia for the Perm Territory, (AM-244/3-14, VK-240/02-02, UT-389/02-02, Federal Penitentiary Institution OIK-2 IK-2 of the Main Directorate of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia for the Perm Territory – you see, behind how many numerous names the “White Swan” was hiding, but the essence is one – torture and violation of the rights of prisoners.

In fact, from the very arrival at this institution in 2001 until 2004 – we were beaten weekly, with a rubber truncheon on the buttocks, when the prisoner was bent at the waist and his head was pressed against the wall, below waist level, his hands were handcuffed, in a position behind his back, tortured up to three times a week, for any invented violation, for example, closed your eyes – you are sleeping, spilled water on floor, started cleaning at the wrong time, talking loudly, boxes for two cells, communication between cells....

Until 2006, all movements outside the cell in a bent position, only, according to the decision of the ECHR (Zakharkin v. Russia), was it recognized as a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on Human Rights, and then everyone was given a questionnaire: Is such a position of movement uncomfortable, does it matter, is it humiliating?

Until 2005, they did not feed in the punishment cell, or rather, they gave bread, and three times a day, 3-5 grains of porridge, a fish bone, the convict must wipe it off, from a cup with a piece of bread, say ""Thank you"", and give the dishes. Refusal to accept this food - was considered an illegal hunger strike, there is a violation, and an addition to the punishment cell. Until 2005, in the punishment cell without underwear, only trousers and a jacket, without socks, is not allowed.  
Reason?

You take the elastic out of your underwear and do a loop, unravel socks and weave a rope.... SUICIDE! From bedding, a thin mattress, a window open even in winter, torture through beatings, hunger, cold. For the first time, in 2005, I was allowed to take the Bible, and each shift of controllers were surprised, ""Why can't you sit like this, they stopped beating, they feed you, you sit, read a book."" Until 2005, every time you leave the punishment cell, treatment, blows with a rubber truncheon when you get a mattress, or hand it over in the morning, lights out at 23-00, wake up at 05 00. 

Every time you go to the bathhouse, they find fault with why there is dust in the cell, and infliction of bodily harm, not only with a rubber truncheon, but also a ""mallet"", a wooden hammer with a wide side, a 1.5 meter long handle on the buttocks, some of the panties burst, it was like a blow to the bottom of a bottle to knock out the cork, and all the organs inside shake, and interrupt the sciatic nerve, the color of the buttock, brown-black blue.

Complaints were not released from the institution, and complainants were beaten, convicted Zakharkin Valery dictated to the lawyer at a meeting, and in 2014 he was sent by stage, transfer to ""Polar Owl"", and there he was killed, on the instructions of the operatives, another convict beat him to death.

Shutov Yuri Titovich (2016) - sent all complaints through a lawyer, did not provide assistance in time, died in the cell - these are those who had defenders, and how many like me, without protection ... Only those who are tired of being afraid, considering themselves dead, there is nothing to fear anymore, stepped over fear and decided not to remain silent anymore, began to appeal to the ECHR, the UN.

**PRACTICE OF PRESSURE:**  
They transfer a mentally ill person to a cell, provoking a fight, everything is covered up like this: insults, threats, convicts Pischikov Denis, Aganyan Ashot, defecate in their pants, and rub everything on the walls, urinate in the middle of the cell, and they make claims to me, why is there a stench in the cell, and immediately put me in a punishment cell.

Convict Gvasalia Pavel Yuryevich, former boxer, master of sports of international class, mentally ill at the post office of false accusations, the psyche moved, rushed to fight me when I wrote a letter in 2010, yes, he wrote a statement, transfer, or put someone third, there was no reaction, they expected a conflict, but in the neighboring cell everyone heard, and declared my innocence. In 2014 - after solitary confinement, 14 days, did not say hello when reporting, transferred to cell #31, to a mentally ill person, a recognized pedophile, raped and killed 4 boys, convicted Kolotushkin, and the operatives ordered him to provoke me, he refused, was beaten, and you know, there is no one among us who survived the death sentence, and waited for years for execution, mentally normal, and having overcome fear, decided to remain sane, preserving all human, and I began to seek protection of my rights, and without God's protection, I would have been killed long ago, but I am still alive.......

A certified employee, I believe, a maniac, Shvetsov Andrey Sergeevich, and Lieutenant Colonel Savin, they tortured convicts who were handcuffed with particular cruelty. In the period from 2001 to 2004, they recruited people for service like this: (While undergoing training, the convict was taken out of the cell to the security office, for violations committed, for an appointment with an explanatory note, and he was forced to beat the convict, whoever refused was fired, and many were beaten, that is, the management checked the employees for loyalty, so that no one had the desire to report torture in the ""White Swan"".

\]Some officers entering the service, realizing what was happening, that they could not change anything, were transferred to other institutions, and the management raised those employees who were involved in bloodshed, torture, beatings, namely, Andrei Shvetsov, who came as a sergeant in 2001, was already a lieutenant, and in 2013 he became a Lieutenant Colonel, Head of the Security Department.

The convicts were forbidden to laugh, the viewing window opened, they stood facing the wall, the window closed, again we sit down, and then the viewing window opens again, and the laughter immediately passes..... When the shift is handed over to another shift, the employees laugh, today we took 80 explanatory notes, another shift competed to cover their testimony with explanatory notes.

And the fact that because of these explanatory notes, on the day of washing, these convicts are beaten, is very pleasing, because they will also beat these maniacs, and at the end of the quarter, for conscientious work, they accrue a bonus, this is how they praised themselves.

Of course, not all are like that, there were those who kept silent, not taking part in this, and those who turned away from depression, during such shifts, I rested from repression, but there are only a few of them, and in 2013, when the question of removing the handcuffs arose, many of the old controllers said: (If they remove the handcuffs from them, I will quit), they remembered how they tortured the convicts, and within a month, the entire colony, like a conveyor belt, was put through The Administrative Commission, having put everyone on profuchet without reason (Inclined to attack representatives of the Administration), they remembered that for many years they had tortured convicts.

They even came up with commands, broadcast on the radio (Cemetery, lights out or, Cemetery, rise), and at the entrance to the territory of building No. 3, dormitory No. 9, to the left of the local, a smoking area, stylized as a stop ""Station Lebedinskaya, final"", that is, only further, Cemetery Misharino.

All the changes in the penal system were not liked by the captain of the internal service Buksman Robert Viktorovich, who came to the position of Head of the Security Department in 2014.  
Complaints of convicts, Decisions of the ECHR on FKU IK-2, complainants are transferred from the colony:  
Magomedov Akhmed, Vasiliev Vladimir, Zakharkin Valery, all have complaints to the ECHR, they are sent to the settlement of Kharp (Polar Owl), a commission has started to visit the colony more often, even from the ECHR, and the incidence of torture of convicts has decreased, not so aggressively, openly and brazenly.

But, weekly, when washing in the shower, the Inspector loudly gives the command to the entire floor, ""Get ready for washing"", after which all convicts, 32 cells on the underground floor, three to a cell, are required to undress to their underwear, wrap up a mattress, and wait their turn from 30 minutes to 3 hours, washing was carried out from 09-00 to 12-00, at any low temperature.

The slightest disobedience, or any reason to find fault, and this will be repression against the convicted person, and every search in the cell, the command ""Prepare for a search"" is, strip down to your underwear, wrap up the mattress, and when you approach the door bars on command, put your hands in the feeder, they will put on handcuffs (since October 2020, they will take you out of the cell dressed, except for days when you wash in the shower). After leaving the cell, the convict faces the wall and is searched, while washing in the shower, exactly like this, only in his underwear, also or from the office, and each time the viewing window is opened, the convict is obliged to stand against the opposite wall, raise his hands up (Order of 05/14/2019 No. 312 on FKU OIK - 2 IK No. 2.

Walk 2-3 times a week, for the first time in August 2001, on the roof, attic, now these premises have been converted into workshops (sewing production cells), Building No. 3, dormitory No. 9, day and night shift...., only since 2018 the walk has become daily. After they took you into the exercise yard, closed the door, and removed the handcuffs, you stand facing the wall for 15 minutes and wait for the command ""Start walk"", you need to go and ask to do physical exercises, they may not allow it, and at the end of the walk, you stand for 15 minutes.

Exercise yards, you saw them, Yuri Nikolaevich, in the photo in the materials of the objections to the ECHR, 2.5 by 3.5 meters in size, three convicts go out, only in 2021 they built 6 large courtyards. Until 2008, when Colonel Vasilenko V.V. became the Chief, everyone in the corridor shouted, insulted convicts.

Yes, and what kind of politeness could we talk about, (Article 12 of the Criminal Executive Code of the Russian Federation, paragraph 13, paragraph 2 of the Penal Regulations of the Correctional Institution), if officials do not consider convicts to be people, (You are not a person, but a convict) - such are the realities ...

Sleeping places are wooden bunks in a metal frame.  
In addition, for many years - the beginning of the 2000s, insults towards convicts are the norm of thinking of officials persons, and addressing them as ""You"", but convicts were required to address officials as ""Citizen Chief"", and despite the explanations of the PVR of the penal institution, to address them by position or rank (previously), the Head of the Institution is one, the rest are senior inspector, inspector, citizen captain, but not the chief. Citizen Chief - came from criminal vocabulary, now the PVR of the penal institution requires addressing by name and patronymic, great, but they answer us, (I am not obliged to introduce myself to you), and what  then do, appealed not in the form, violation of the regime of detention - this is the corpus delicti of officials. Toilet cabins were installed since 2017, earlier, brick fence, Joe 2008 on the upper floors, until 2014 in the basement, which are hidden facts of detention in the underground floor, basement, according to the cadastral passport of the building - a requirement to name, the first floor, and since 2022, when everything was revealed in court, they began to indicate, basement false floor. In accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation of 2006 No. 47, paragraph 2.23 states, (It is not allowed to place living quarters in the basement and ground floors of buildings, but we were not considered people, we are not people, but non-humans, so we were kept like rats.....

When the viewing window opens and the convict is in the toilet, he must stick out his hand with an open palm and shout ""One in the toilet"", and by order of an official, you must urgently leave the toilet - so we are considered not people, not individuals....

Since 2011, when I was transferred to normal conditions of detention, all weekends and holidays, during the day from 14-00 to 17-00 they showed video films, but since 2013 on New Year's 2014, weekends, only three days, and only red dates, February 23, May 01, May 09, July 12 became days off, turning on the TV during the day on Saturday - cancelled.

TV viewing for those held under strict conditions was reduced to 30 minutes, and only after an appeal to the prosecutor, viewing was increased to 60 minutes. Once a day, in the evening, personal time, under normal conditions 2.5 hours, the formation of the Russian Anthem every morning since 2014. Since 2022, when the PVR of the penal institution was tightened, and all convicts, ignoring Articles 3, 8, 10, 87 of the Criminal Executive Code of the Russian Federation, introduced discrimination and without taking into account differentiation, life-sentenced prisoners decided to be held under disciplinary punishment, as those serving SHIZO, PKT, EPKT, for violations.

\]Tea, coffee, all food products were removed from the cells, issuing them only upon written request, and only three times a day, for 40 minutes, during meals, electric kettles were removed, electric kettles permitted - permitted by the PVR of the penal institution, this is not for you, you are not people to have them, but also it is impossible to have a radio receiver authorized.

The management of the torture institution ""White Swan"" highly appreciates that it violates the norms of constitutional, international law, and reacts aggressively to those who decided to defend their rights, and therefore, immediately make convicts violators, artificially creating violations, transferring them to a cell with the mentally ill, creating the hardships of daily detention, transferring them to a cell with convicts who, on the orders of officials, beat and insult, then, SHIZO.

When taken out for a walk in winter, the convict can only put on mittens in the exercise yard, when the handcuffs are removed, at the end of the walk, you need to remove the mittens, put on ice handcuffs, the temperature is below 30 degrees.

Telephone calls under normal conditions since 2017 - once a month, before 2016 - once a week, and Lieutenant Colonel Robert Viktorovich Buksman declares (Head of the Security Department of the Federal State Institution Correctional Colony No. 2 of the OUHD GUFSIN of Russia Perm edges), ""my employees have already knocked their legs out to take you out"", and the conversation time of 15 minutes goes from the beginning of the set of numbers.

Officers of the institution, former controllers, brought up on the principles of hatred towards convicts, and in the cells of strict detention since 2020, three searches a week are carried out, when washing in the shower, all things were thrown into a pile, my documents to the prosecutor's office disappeared, until 2017 - bed linen was given for washing once a week, a window measuring 50 by 70 cm, in a concrete wall, and as soon as I sought protection of my rights, there was a reaction ...

Only with the mentally ill I was repeatedly kept (Federchenko A.), 2001-2002, New Year, in a punishment cell - 7 days, Semenov I. - 2003, Melehin S. (2004, 2016), Mychelkin I. (2006) - due to appeals regarding illegal detention, after Mychelkina had already been transferred,

I was illegally locked in a punishment cell for 12 days, Pasaliya P.Yu., (beat me in 2010), Dimasov (2011, 2016), Krapivin G. (2011-2012), was transferred to solitary confinement, went on a hunger strike, Ermilyev V., (they couldn’t provoke me to fight, they found fault with me for not saying hello) - 14 days in a punishment cell, Vasiliev (2020-2021), Soldatov (2019, 2020, 2021), Galimov F. (2022), Oganyan (2015, 2016) - these are real mentally ill people, and they are documented. Galimov, Aganyan - the consequences of stress, stroke, but the aggression that they turned on me, although I supported them morally, understanding that they were sick, they were turned against me, I'm not even talking about people like Rykhlov, who was several times in strict conditions of detention for 10 years, decided to commit crimes of officials, I think he is mentally ill.

The head of the Federal State Institution IK No. 2 OUHD GUFSIN of Russia Perm Krai, devotes all his time to the work of the sewing production, which he organized, and is in charge of everything Lieutenant Colonel Buksman Robert Viktorovich, under his command both the operational department and the security department. Very cunning and vindictive, smiles, but does things his own way, neither the operatives, no one wants to mess with him, go against him - he is the organizer of the torture of convicts. In the operational department: Nosov, Sultanov, former inspectors, their curator is Buksman R.V., and the Head of the Security Department Lieutenant Colonel Yaburov V.P., and look at the statistics of the ECHR Decision on ""White Swan"", except for Valery Zakharkin, Magomedov, Vasiliev, Yuri Shutov, Shlykov.

The former Minister of Justice of France said: ""Society is assessed by the state of its prison"", either tomorrow's justice or violence takes place in them. In the Russian Federation, the punitive, not the criminal-executive system, officials who are given the authority to manage a correctional institution, use this against convicts based not on the law, but on their desires to torture convicts, and do not want supervising prosecutors to interfere in their affairs. In his work: ""Long Walk to Freedom"" Nelson Mandela writes: ""In reality, no one knows a people until they are in prison, a nation should be judged not by how it treats its most prominent citizens, but by how it treats those at the bottom."" In the Russian Federation, the Constitution of Russia, the norms of international law are proclaimed, but in reality, the by-laws of the PVR of the penal colony and the internal orders of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia violate the laws, ignoring the concept of justice.

Each employee of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia, the prosecutor's office, conducting inspections, remaining in personal communication with the leadership of the colony, demand a tougher regime, violation of the rights of convicts, additional means of isolation, bars, locks, convicts with life imprisonment in their opinion, animals, and not a person, only when they themselves are held accountable for their crimes, feel the torture of the guards on themselves, and then, if they are officials who stole. They are classified for crimes not theft, but an increase to it, using official position, but embezzlement, negligence, for them and the laws are different, they have nothing to fear.

In relation to those convicted with life imprisonment, pardoned after the death penalty, convicted were subjected to decades of humiliation, then we, in fact, hostages in the Russian Federation before the world community, who never fulfilled the obligations under Protocol No. 6, having refused the convention and all obligations, we, serving life imprisonment, were taken outside the framework of all laws.

After all, we were tried under the Criminal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code of the RSFSR, the composition of the court: a judge, and two people's assessors, in fact alone, which is recognized as unconstitutional, in 1999, and everyone is waiting for them all to die, such is the reality.

All those who raised their voices in our defense have always been discriminated against, killed, intimidated, this is exactly what is happening to you, my defender, Yuri Nikolaevich, and in order to push you away from defending my rights, to embitter you, they use other convicts, whom you tried to defend, everyone has their own level of strength, and someone is crushed by fear.

Only those who are tired of being afraid, who have died, stop being afraid of torture, pressure, and the dead have nothing to fear, and there is discrimination against me in everything, and the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation does not review my sentence, those who have served more than 30 years, and were deprived of the right to serve in the SVO, although those who have serious crimes were called up from prisons to serve - this confirms that I am outside the law. Hence, the content of Chapter 36 of the PVR of the IU (Order No. 110) from 2022 - equalized for life, as those held in SHIZO, PKT, EPKT for violations, but this is temporary, and a life sentence is eternal, where is the law, the constitution, the right in relation to me, as a life convict?

**Dear defense attorney, Demin Yuri Nikolaevich!**

I hope that now, having other stated facts, to see a complete and clear picture of what will happen in the FKU IK No. 2 OUHD GUFSIN of Russia Perm Territory, Solikamsk (""White Swan""), and in general in relation to those whose death penalty was replaced by life imprisonment, or better to say, to die alive within the walls of the executive system

1)**Does the brew time start from the moment you pour hot water into the chamber or does it start when you put the plunger in to create an air tight seal?**

  
Some recipe's ask to brew for 90 seconds, but sometimes pouring gradually from the kettle can take around 30 seconds alone. I just wanted clarification because some tutorials on youtube say brew time starts when the lid is on and its fully sealed.

  
2)**When the coffee is loaded into the brew chamber do you leave an air gap (between the coffee/water and plunger) or do you press all the air out before you leave it to brew?**

I ask this because in the last month of owning an Aeropress I have always pushed all the air out before leaving it to brew. But in the last couple of days I've left a gap of air and plunging the coffee out and find that there's more crema  (or fake crema). I just wanted to know if there's any logic to this method or if I'm just imagining it (I may just be getting better at making coffee).

# Review:

This white summer set is exactly what I needed. The shorts are super light and breathable, perfect for hot days, and they fit really well without being too tight or too loose. The polo tee is soft, sits nicely on the shoulders, and keeps a clean shape even after washing.

Honestly, the whole vibe of this set is chill but still sharp—great for walks, coffee runs, or casual evenings. I’ve been wearing it pretty often and both pieces still look fresh.

So I've been working on this thing for about a month and a half now and figured it's time to share it with you all.

# How it started

My company's engineering lead dropped a link to Active Storage Dashboard gem in our Slack. I was bored so I clicked through to check out the code. Turns out the entire Rails engine was like 10 lines. I'm sitting there thinking ""no way this actually works"" so I kept digging.

Ended up reading Rails engine docs for way too long and thought - you know what, I should build something myself. Maybe a database viewer so I don't have to keep opening DBeaver every time I want to check what's in my tables.

# The build process

Started with GitHub Copilot because why not learn while building, right? I gave it my rough idea and let it go nuts. First couple hours were great, AI was pumping out code and everything looked good. Then it started changing random stuff and breaking things it had no business touching.

That's when I realized I needed to actually understand what I was building. Spent a bunch of evenings (and weekends when my friends weren't demanding I hop on Discord for games) cleaning up the mess and refactoring everything properly.

# What I ended up with

It's called DBViewer and it basically gives you a web interface for browsing your database. Read-only obviously, I'm not trying to build the next phpMyAdmin disaster.

Main features:

* Dashboard with table stats and overview
* Browse tables with pagination and search
* View schema details, indexes, all that stuff
* ERD visualization
* Run safe SQL queries with built-in validation
* Works with multiple database connections
* Has security stuff like PII masking and access controls

The security part was important to me since this thing touches your actual data. Everything's read-only, has SQL injection protection, you can set up basic auth, whitelist/blacklist tables, mask sensitive columns, or just disable it completely in production.

# Testing it out

I've been using it on one of our work projects (locally) and honestly it's pretty handy. Quick way to find data without switching tools, easy to follow relationships between tables.

There's a demo up at [https://dbviewer-demo.wailantirajoh.tech/](https://dbviewer-demo.wailantirajoh.tech/) if you want to poke around.

# Installation

    ruby
    gem ""dbviewer""

Mount it in routes:

    ruby
    mount Dbviewer::Engine, at: ""/dbviewer""

That's it.

# Why I'm posting this

I'm still relatively new to Rails so I wanted to get the community's take on this. Specifically wondering:

* Does this solve a problem you actually have?
* Any obvious security issues I missed?
* Performance thoughts for bigger databases?
* Features that would make this more useful?

The whole thing taught me a ton about Rails engines (they're way more powerful than I expected), database introspection, and how to work with AI tools without letting them take over completely.

If anyone tries it out I'd love to hear what you think. Always down to chat about Rails stuff too. The github repository for the project located here: [https://github.com/WailanTirajoh/dbviewer](https://github.com/WailanTirajoh/dbviewer)

1lo7sm6,https://i.redd.it/so6vy2hzf2af1.png,[Rum Review #156] Diplomático Single Vintage 1997,"In the life of every smoker and spirits lover, there are certain ""unicorns"" or products one aspires to, whose availability is more or less difficult, but never impossible. In my case, and without going into too much detail, there's always been one of Diplomático's Single Vintage 1997. While the other Single Vintages are relatively easier to come by, the 1997 is the *unicorn* of it. This week, while talking to a friend on the phone, he asked me to come over to his house to try something.

In 1997, part of the rum reserves intended to create Diplomático rums were stored for further aging. Much to the delight of master rum maker Tito Cordero, he discovered that some of these reserves had developed in a particularly exceptional manner at the bottom of the cellars located at the foot of the Andean Mountains.

Single Vintage 1997 is the product of a perfect blend of 1997 rums aged in American white oak barrels and then further aged in sherry casks, resulting in a vintage rum bottled at 43% alcohol in 2010. Supply and demand has driven the price of this particular bottling to upwards of $2000 in auctions, and though some stores also sell it at those prices, when it came out the price wasn't above $100.

Made by: Destilerías Unidas, S.A. (DUSA)  
Name of the rum: Single Vintage 1997  
Brand: Diplomático  
Origin: Venezuela  
Age: 13 years  
Price: Varies

**Nose:** For a moment I know exactly what the food critic in Ratatouille felt when he tasted the dish of the same name in the film. This aroma immediately transports me, though I'm not entirely sure where, but I don't want to leave that place. There isn't a strong alcohol kick, but enough to keep my nose from lingering for too long. Initially, there are strong notes of sherry, almonds, and vanilla, followed by milder notes of chocolate and coffee, and that's about it. I'm sure I could find more notes given more time, though.

**Palate:** The palate offers an alcoholic note that isn't entirely consistent with the 43% alcohol content, as the rum's inherent flavors overpower any alcoholic punch. The flavors are rich and immensely complex, starting with a sweet note, but unlike many of the brand's rums, it's not intensely sweet. Notes include roasted almonds, coffee beans, dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla, oak, dark tobacco, and a timeless finish.

**Retrohale/Finish:** Orange peel, oak, figs, raisins, peanuts, nuts and red fruits.

**Rating:** 10 on the t8ke 

**Conclusion:** I often recommend pairing options, including the pairing chronicles I will usually post around the cigar-related subs. But mixing anything, even ice, with this rum I think would be sacrilege. A cigar is certainly possible, but the fact that the rum isn't so sweet as to overpower the cigar and the smoke I paired it with made the experience as good as it was unforgettable.

I don't include the price in the spec sheet because it's particularly variable. In Venezuela, I've seen it priced between $500 and $2500, but on international websites, I've seen it range from $120 to $3000.



English is not my first language and most of my reviews have been posted originally in Spanish, and later translated into English, so I apologize if they sometimes sound mechanical. On reddit I'm aiming to review mostly Venezuelan rums, but I post a bit of everything. You can check out the rest of my reviews (in Spanish) on [my blog,](https://humoytabaco.com/) including rum, whisk(e)y, agave, gin and cigars. I also have an Instagram account [in Spanish](https://www.instagram.com/robleytabaco) as well and another one [in English](https://www.instagram.com/oaknsmokes/), where I'll regularly update video reviews.

I’m currently managing a restau-café in sousse, Tunisia , on a test basis for 2 weeks before potentially signing a management contract. The café is fully equipped with a kitchen, seating area, and a strong location near administrations, schools, and residential buildings.


---

📋 The Situation:

Monthly rent: 7k TND (for Management contract) 

Owner also demands: 2-month cash deposit

No current capital to launch full operations

I work a full-time job during the day, available from 4:00 PM to midnight

Morning shift is currently managed by the owners



---

🎯 Short-Term Goal:

> Build a lean system that generates at least 1200 TND/day, especially on 4–5 strong days per week.



I'm focusing on:
Morning branches - mid-day lunch

Evening food  (e.g., Baguette, Makloub,Pizza, spaghettis and a wide range of pasta mojito, waffle + smoothies )


WhatsApp recommendations & Instagram paid ads

Setting up a basic tracking + delegation system

Main Constraints:

No investment capital from the owner now

Owner is also considering selling the whole business( fond de commerce)

Current staff is not well-trained — may need replacement i recently repleced the barista with an experienced one i am still looking for a chef 

I must handle operations around my full-time job

Client base is there, but not yet activated ( chweya trafic)



---

✅ What I'm going to Test:

High-margin combo meals in the evening

Daily deals printed + posted for morning team

WhatsApp group campaigns in nearby schools and clinics

Simple Excel-based sales tracking and staff task sheets

Building visibility through IG stories and short videos



---

❓ I’d Really Appreciate Input On:

How to build daily foot traffic with no cash

Ways to motivate staff when I’m not there (especially mornings)

How to convince the owner to trust me long-term
and lower the rental fee?
Strategies to attract a local micro-investor or silent partner

  …Minus 100 and COUNTING…  
  
  She was squinting at the thermometer in the white light coming through the window. Beyond her, in the drizzle, the other highrises in Co-Op City rose like the gray turrets of a penitentiary. Below, in the airshaft, clotheslines flapped with ragged wash. Rats and plump alley cats circulated through the garbage.  
  
  She looked at her husband. He was seated at the table, staring up at the Free-Vee with steady, vacant concentration. He had been watching it for weeks now. It wasn’t like him. He hated it, always had. Of course, every Development apartment had one—it was the law—but it was still legal to turn them off. The Compulsory Benefit Bill of 2021 had failed to get the required two-thirds majority by six votes. Ordinarily they never watched it. But ever since Cathy had gotten sick, he had been watching the big-money giveaways. It filled her with sick fear.  
  
  Behind the compulsive shrieking of the half-time announcer narrating the latest newsie flick, Cathy’s flu-hoarsened wailing went on and on.  
  
  “How bad is it?” Richards asked.  
  
  “Not so bad.”  
  
  “Don’t shit me.”  
  
  “It’s a hundred and four.”  
  
  He brought both fists down on the table. A plastic dish jumped into the air and clattered down.  
  
  “We’ll get a doctor. Try not to worry so much. Listen—” She began to babble frantically to distract him; he had turned around and was watching the Free-Vee again. Half-time was over, and the game was on again. This wasn’t one of the big ones, of course, just a cheap daytime come-on called Treadmill to Bucks. They accepted only chronic heart, liver, or lung patients, sometimes throwing in a crip for comic relief. Every minute the contestant could stay on the treadmill (keeping up a steady flow of chatter with the emcee), he won ten dollars. Every two minutes the emcee asked a Bonus Question in the contestant’s category (the current pal, a heart-murmur from Hackensack, was an American history buff) which was worth fifty dollars. If the contestant, dizzy, out of breath, heart doing fantastic rubber acrobatics in his chest, missed the question, fifty dollars was deducted from his winnings and the treadmill was speeded up.  
  
  “We’ll get along. Ben. We will. Really. I…I’ll…”  
  
  “You’ll what?” He looked at her brutally. “Hustle? No more, Sheila. She’s got to have a real doctor. No more block midwife with dirty hands and whiskey breath. All the modern equipment. I’m going to see to it.”  
  
  He crossed the room, eyes swiveling hypnotically to the Free-Vee bolted into one peeling wall above the sink. He took his cheap denim jacket off its hook and pulled it on with fretful gestures.  
  
  “No! No, I won’t…won’t allow it. You’re not going to—”  
  
  “Why not? At worst you can get a few oldbucks as the head of a fatherless house. One way or the other you’ll have to see her through this.”  
  
  She had never really been a handsome woman, and in the years since her husband had not worked she had grown scrawny, but in this moment she looked beautiful…imperious. “I won’t take it. I’d rather sell the govie a two-dollar piece of tail when he comes to the door and send him back with his dirty blood money in his pocket. Should I take a bounty on my man?”  
  
  He turned on her, grim and humorless, clutching something that set him apart, an invisible something for which the Network had ruthlessly calculated. He was a dinosaur in this time. Not a big one, but still a throwback, an embarrassment. Perhaps a danger. Big clouds condense around small particles.  
  
  He gestured at the bedroom. “How about her in an unmarked pauper’s grave? Does that appeal to you?”  
  
  It left her with only the argument of insensate sorrow. Her face cracked and dissolved into tears.  
  
  “Ben, this is just what they want, for people like us, like you—”  
  
  “Maybe they won’t take me,” he said, opening the door. “Maybe I don’t have whatever it is they look for.”  
  
  “If you go now, they’ll kill you. And I’ll be here watching it. Do you want me watching that with her in the next room?” She was hardly coherent through her tears.  
  
  “I want her to go on living.” He tried to close the door, but she put her body in the way.  
  
  “Give me a kiss before you go, then.”  
  
  He kissed her. Down the hall, Mrs. Jenner opened her door and peered out. The rich odor of corned beef and cabbage, tantalizing, maddeni  
ng, drifted to them. Mrs. Jenner did well—she helped out at the local discount drug and had an almost uncanny eye for illegal-card carriers.  
  
  “You’ll take the money?” Richards asked. “You won’t do anything stupid?”  
  
  “I’ll take it,” she whispered. “You know I’ll take it.”  
  
  He clutched her awkwardly, then turned away quickly, with no grace, and plunged down the crazily slanting, ill-lighted stairwell.  
  
  She stood in the doorway, shaken by soundless sobs, until she heard the door slam hollowly five flights down, and then she put her apron up to her face. She was still clutching the thermometer she had used to take the baby’s temperature.  
  
  Mrs. Jenner crept up softly and twitched the apron. “Dearie,” she whispered, “I can put you onto black market penicillin when the money gets here…real cheap…good quality—”  
  
  “Get out!” she screamed at her.  
  
  Mrs. Jenner recoiled, her upper lip rising instinctively away from the blackened stumps of her teeth. “Just trying to help,” she muttered, and scurried back to her room.  
  
  Barely muffled by the thin plastiwood, Cathy’s wails continued. Mrs. Jenner’s Free-Vee blared and hooted. The contestant on Treadmill to Bucks had just missed a Bonus Question and had had a heart attack simultaneously. He was being carried off on a rubber stretcher while the audience applauded.  
  
  Upper lip arising and falling metronomically, Mrs. Jenner wrote Sheila Richards’s name down in her notebook. “We’ll see,” she said to no one. “We’ll just see, Mrs. Smell-So-Sweet.”  
  
  She closed the notebook with a vicious snap and settled down to watch the next game.  
  
  …Minus 099 and COUNTING…  
  
  The drizzle had deepened into a steady rain by the time Richards hit the street. The big Smoke Dokes for Hallucinogenic Jokes thermometer across the street stood at fifty-one degrees. (Just the Right Temp to Stoke Up a Doke—High to the Nth Degree!) That might make it sixty in their apartment. And Cathy had the flu.  
  
  A rat trotted lazily, lousily, across the cracked and blistered cement of the street. Across the way, the ancient and rusted skeleton of a 2013 Humber stood on decayed axles. It had been completely stripped, even to the wheel bearings and motor mounts, but the cops didn’t take it away. The cops rarely ventured south of the Canal anymore. Co-Op City stood in a radiating rat warren of parking lots, deserted shops, Urban Centers, and paved playgrounds. The cycle gangs were the law here, and all those newsie items about the intrepid Block Police of South City were nothing but a pile of warm crap. The streets were ghostly, silent. If you went out, you took the pneumo bus or you carried a gas cylinder.  
  
  He walked fast, not looking around, not thinking. The air was sulphurous and thick. Four cycles roared past and someone threw a ragged hunk of asphalt paving. Richards ducked easily. Two pneumo buses passed him, buffeting him with air, but he did not flag them. The week’s twenty-dollar unemployment allotment (oldbucks) had been spent. There was no money to buy a token. He supposed the roving packs could sense his poverty. He was not molested.  
  
  Highrises, Developments, chain-link fences, parking lots empty except for stripped derelicts, obscenities scrawled on the pavement in soft chalk and now blurring with the rain. Crashed-out windows, rats, wet bags of garbage splashed over the sidewalks and into the gutters. Graffiti written jaggedly on crumbling gray walls: HONKY DON’T LET THE SUN SET ON YOU HEAR. HOME FOLKS BLOW DOKES. YOUR MOMMY ITCHES. SKIN YOUR BANANA. TOMMY’S PUSHING. HITLER WAS COOL. MARY. SID. KILL ALL KIKES. The old G.A. sodium lights put up in the 70s busted with rocks and hunks of paving. No technico was going to replace them down here; they were on the New Credit Dollar. Technicos stay uptown, baby. Uptown’s cool. Everything silent except for the rising-then-descending whoosh of the pneumo buses and the echoing clack of Richards’s footfalls. This battlefield only lights up at night. In the day it is a deserted gray silence which contains no movement but the cats and rats and fat white maggots trundling across the garbage. No smell but the decaying reek of this brave year 2025. The Free-Vee cables are safely buried under the streets and no one but an idiot or a revolutionary would want to vandalize them. Free-Vee is the stuff of dreams, the bread of life. Scag is twelve oldbucks a bag, Frisco Push goes for twenty a tab, but the Free-Vee will freak you for nothing. Farther along, on the other side of the Canal, the dream machine runs twenty-four hours a day…but it runs on New Dollars, and only employed people have any. There are four million others, almost all of them unemployed, south of the Canal in Co-Op City.  
  
  Richards walked three miles and the occasional liquor stores and smoke shops, at first heavily grilled, became more numerous. Then the X-Houses (!!24 Perversions—Count ’Em 24!!), the Hockeries, the Blood Emporiums. Greasers sitting on cycles at every corner, the gutters buried in snowdrifts of roach ends. Rich Blokes Smoke Dokes.  
  
  He could see the skyscrapers rising into the clouds now, high and clean. The highest of all was the Network Games Building, one hundred stories, the top half buried in cloud and smog cover. He fixed his eyes on it and walked another mile. Now the more expensive movie houses, and smoke shops with no grills (but Rent-A-Pigs stood outside, electric move-alongs hanging from their Sam Browne belts). A city cop on every corner. The People’s Fountain Park: Admission 75¢. Well-dressed mothers watching their children as they frolicked on the astroturf behind chain-link fencing. A cop on either side of the gate. A tiny, pathetic glimpse of the fountain.  
  
  He crossed the Canal.  
  
  As he got closer to the Games Building it grew taller, more and more improbable with its impersonal tiers of rising office windows, its polished stonework. Cops watching him, ready to hustle him along or bust him if he tried to commit loitering. Uptown there was only one function for a man in baggy gray pants and a cheap bowl haircut and sunken eyes. That purpose was the Games.  
  
  The qualifying examinations began promptly at noon, and when Ben Richards stepped behind the last man in line, he was almost in the umbra of the Games Building. But the building was still nine blocks and over a mile away. The line stretched before him like an eternal snake. Soon others joined it behind him. The police watched them, hands on either gun butts or move-alongs. They smiled anonymous, contemptuous smiles.  
  
  —That one look like a half-wit to you, Frank? Looks like one to me.  
  
  —Guy down there ast me if there was a place where he could go to the bathroom. Canya magine it?  
  
  —Sons of bitches ain’t—  
  
  —Kill their own mothers for a—  
  
  —Smelled like he didn’t have a bath for—  
  
  —Ain’t nothin like a freak show I always—  
  
  Heads down against the rain, they shuffled aimlessly, and after a while the line began to move.  
  
  …Minus 098 and COUNTING…  
  
  It was after four when Ben Richards got to the main desk and was routed to Desk 9 (Q-R). The woman sitting at the rumbling plastipunch looked tired and cruel and impersonal. She looked at him and saw no one.  
  
  “Name, last-first-middle.”  
  
  “Richards, Benjamin Stuart.”  
  
  Her fingers raced over the keys. Clitter-clitter-clitter went the machine.  
  
  “Age-height-weight.”  
  
  “Twenty-eight, six-two, one-sixty-five.”  
  
  Clitter-clitter-clitter  
  
  The huge lobby was an echoing, rebounding tomb of sound. Questions being asked and answered. People were being led out weeping. People were being thrown out. Hoarse voices were raised in protest. A scream or two. Questions. Always questions.  
  
  “Last school attended?”  
  
  “Manual Trades.”  
  
  “Did you graduate?”  
  
  “No.”  
  
  “How many years, and at what age did you leave?”  
  
  “Two years. Sixteen years old.”  
  
  “Reasons for leaving?”  
  
  “I got married.”  
  
  Clitter-clitter-clitter  
  
  “Name and age of spouse if any.”  
  
  “Sheila Catherine Richards, twenty-six.”  
  
  “Names and ages of children, if any.�  
�  
  
  “Catherine Sarah Richards, eighteen months.”  
  
  Clitter-clitter-clitter  
  
  “Last question, mister. Don’t bother lying; they’ll pick it up during the physical and disqualify you there. Have you ever used heroin or the synthetic-amphetamine hallucinogen called San Francisco Push?”  
  
  “No.”  
  
  Clitter.  
  
  A plastic card popped out and she handed it to him. “Don’t lose this, big fella. If you do, you have to start back at go next week.” She was looking at him now, seeing his face, the angry eyes, lanky body. Not bad looking. At least some intelligence. Good stats.  
  
  She took his card back abruptly and punched off the upper right-hand corner, giving it an odd milled appearance.  
  
  “What was that for?”  
  
  “Never mind. Somebody will tell you later. Maybe.” She pointed over his shoulder at a long hall which led toward a bank of elevators. Dozens of men fresh from the desks were being stopped, showing their plastic I.D.s and moving on. As Richards watched, a trembling, sallow-faced Push freak was stopped by a cop and shown the door. The freak began to cry. But he went.  
  
  “Tough old world, big fella,” the woman behind the desk said without sympathy. “Move along.”  
  
  Richards moved along. Behind him, the litany was already beginning again.  
  
  …Minus 097 and COUNTING…  
  
  A hard, callused hand slapped his shoulder at the head of the hall beyond the desks. “Card, buddy.”  
  
  Richards showed it. The cop relaxed, his face subtle and Chinese with disappointment.  
  
  “You like turning them back, don’t you?” Richards asked. “It really gives you a charge, doesn’t it?”  
  
  “You want to go downtown, maggot?”  
  
  Richards walked past him, and the cop made no move.  
  
  He stopped halfway to the bank of elevators and looked back. “Hey. Cop.

The cop looked at him truculently.  
  
  “Got a family? It could be you next week.”  
  
  “Move on!” the cop shouted furiously.  
  
  With a smile, Richards moved on.  
  
  There was a line of perhaps twenty applicants waiting at the elevators. Richards showed one of the cops on duty his card and the cop looked at him closely. “You a hardass, sonny?”  
  
  “Just about as smart as you talk without that gun on your leg and your pants down around your ankles,” Richards said, still smiling. “Want to try it?”  
  
  For a moment he thought the cop was going to swing at him. “They’ll fix you,” the cop said. “You’ll do some walking on your knees before you’re done.”  
  
  The cop swaggered over to three new arrivals and demanded to see their cards.  
  
  The man ahead of Richards turned around. He had a nervous, unhappy face and curly hair that came down in a widow’s peak. “Say, you don’t want to antagonize them, fella. They’ve got a grapevine.”  
  
  “Is that so?” Richards asked, looking at him mildly.  
  
  The man turned away.  
  
  Abruptly the elevator doors snapped open. A black cop with a huge gut stood protecting the bank of push buttons. Another cop sat on a small stool reading a 3-D Pervert Mag in a small bulletproof cubicle the size of a telephone booth at the rear of the large car. A sawed-off shotgun rested between his knees. Shells were lined up beside him within easy reach.  
  
  “Step to the rear!” the fat cop cried with bored importance. “Step to the rear! Step to the rear!”  
  
  They crowded in to a depth where a deep breath was impossible. Sad flesh walled Richards on every side. They went up to the second floor. The doors snapped open. Richards, who stood a head taller than anyone else in the car, saw a huge waiting room with many chairs dominated by a huge Free-Vee. A cigarette dispenser stood in one corner.  
  
  “Step out! Step out! Show I.D. cards to your left!”  
  
  They stepped out, holding out their I.D. cards to the impersonal lens of a camera. Three cops stood close by. For some reason, a buzzer went off at the sight of some dozen cards, and the holders were jerked out of line and hustled away.  
  
  Richards showed his card and was waved on. He went to the cigarette machine, got a package of Blams and sat down as far from the Free-Vee as possible. He lit up a smoke and exhaled, coughing. He hadn’t had a cigarette in almost six months.  
  
  …Minus 096 and COUNTING…  
  
  They called the A’s for the physical almost immediately, and about two dozen men got up and filed through a door beyond the Free-Vee. A large sign tacked over the door read THIS WAY. There was an arrow below the legend, pointing at the door. The literacy of Games applicants was notoriously low.  
  
  They were taking a new letter every fifteen minutes or so. Ben Richards had sat down at about five, and so he estimated it would be quarter of nine before they got to him. He wished he had brought a book, but he supposed things were just as well as they were. Books were regarded with suspicion at best, especially when carried by someone from south of the Canal. Pervert Mags were safer.  
  
  He watched the six o’clock newsie restlessly (the fighting in Ecuador was worse, new cannibal riots had broken out in India, the Detroit Tigers had taken the Harding Catamounts by a score of 6–2 in an afternoon game), and when the first of the evening’s big-money games came on at six-thirty, he went restlessly to the window and looked out. Now that his mind was made up, the Games bored him again. Most of the others, however, were watching Fun Guns with a dreadful fascination. Next week it might be them.  
  
  Outside, daylight was bleeding slowly toward dusk. The els were slamming at high speed through the power rings above the second-floor window, their powerful headlights searching the gray air. On the sidewalks below, crowds of men and women (most of them, of course, technicos or Network bureaucrats) were beginning their evening’s prowl in search of entertainment. A Certified Pusher was hawking his wares on the corner across the street. A man with a sabled dolly on each arm passed below him; the trio was laughing about something.  
  
  He had a sudden awful wave of homesickness for Sheila and Cathy, and wished he could call them. He didn’t think it was allowed. He could still walk out, of course; several men already had. They walked across the room, grinning obscurely at nothing, to use the door marked TO STREET. Back to the flat with his daughter glowing fever-bright in the other room? No. Couldn’t. Couldn’t.  
  
  He stood at the window a little while longer, then went back and sat down. The new game, Dig Your Grave, was beginning.  
  
  The fellow sitting next to Richards twitched his arm anxiously. “Is it true that they wash out over thirty percent just on the physicals?”  
  
  “I don’t know,” Richards said.  
  
  “Jesus,” the fellow said. “I got bronchitis. Maybe Treadmill to Bucks…”  
  
  Richards could think of nothing to say. The pal’s respiration sounded like a faraway truck trying to climb a steep hill.  
  
  “I got a fambly,” the man said with soft desperation.  
  
  Richards looked at the Free-Vee as if it interested him.  
  
  The fellow was quiet for a long time. When the program changed again at seven-thirty, Richards heard him asking the man on his other side about the physical.  
  
  It was full dark outside now. Richards wondered if it was still raining. It seemed like a very long evening.  
  
  …Minus 095 and COUNTING…  
  
  When the R’s went through the door under the red arrow and into the examination room it was just a few minutes after nine-thirty. A lot of the initial excitement had worn off, and people were either watching the Free-Vee avidly, with none of their prior dread, or dozing. The man with the noisy chest had a name that began with L and had been called over an hour before. Richards wondered idly if he had been cut.  
  
  The examination room was long and tiled, lit with fluorescent tubes. It looked like an assembly line, with bored doctors standing at various stations along the way.  
  
  Would any of you like to check my little girl? Richards thought bitterly.  
  
  The applicants showed their cards to another camera eye embedded in the wall and were ordered to stop by a row of clotheshooks. A doctor in a long white lab coat walked over to them, clipboard tucked under one arm.  
  
  “Strip,” he said. “Hang your clothes on the hooks. Remember the number over your hook and give the number to the orderly at the far end. Don’t worry about your valuables. Nobody here wants them.”  
  
  Valuables. That was a hot one, Richards thought, unbuttoning his shirt. He had an empty wallet with a few pictures of Sheila and Cathy, a receipt for a shoe sole he had had replaced at the local cobbler’s six months ago, a keyring with no keys on it except for the doorkey, a baby sock that he did not remember putting in there, and the package of Blams he had gotten from the machine.  
  
  He was wearing tattered skivvies because Sheila was too stubborn to let him go without, but many of the men were buck under their pants. Soon they all stood stripped and anonymous, penises dangling between their legs like forgotten war-clubs. Everyone held his card in one hand. Some shuffled their feet as if the floor were cold, although it was not. The faint, impersonally nostalgic odor of alcohol drifted through.  
  
  “Stay in line,” the doctor with the clipboard was instructing. “Always show your card. Follow instructions.”  
  
  The line moved forward. Richards saw there was a cop with each doctor along the way. He dropped his eyes and waited passively.  
  
  “Card.”  
  
  He gave his card over. The first doctor noted the number, then said: “Open your mouth.”  
  
  Richards opened it. His tongue was depressed.  
  
  The next doctor peered into his pupils with a tiny bright light, and then stared in his ears.  
  
  The next placed the cold circle of a stethoscope on his chest. “Cough.”  
  
  Richards coughed. Down the line a man was being hauled away. He needed the money, they couldn’t do it, he’d get his lawyer on them.  
  
  The doctor moved his stethoscope. “Cough.”<  
br />  
  Richards coughed. The doctor turned him around and put the stethoscope on his back.  
  
  “Take a deep breath and hold it.” The stethoscope moved.  
  
  “Exhale.”  
  
  Richards exhaled.  
  
  “Move along.”  
  
  His blood pressure was taken by a grinning doctor with an eyepatch. He was given a short-arm inspection by a bald medico who had several large brown freckles, like liverspots, on his pate. The doctor placed a cool hand between the sac of his scrotum and his upper thigh.  
  
  “Cough.”  
  
  Richards coughed.  
  
  “Move along.”  
  
  His temperature was taken. He was asked to spit in a cup. Halfway, now. Halfway down the hall. Two or three men had already finished up, and an orderly with a pasty face and rabbit teeth was bringing them their clothes in wire baskets. Half a dozen more had been pulled out of the line and shown the stairs.  
  
  “Bend over and spread your cheeks.”  
  
  Richards bent and spread. A finger coated with plastic invaded his rectal channel, explored, retreated.  
  
  “Move along.”  
  
  He stepped into a booth with curtains on three sides, like the old voting booths—voting booths had been done away with by computer election eleven years ago—and urinated in a blue beaker. The doctor took it and put it in a wire rack.  
  
  At the next stop he looked at an eye-chart. “Read,” the doctor said.  
  
  “E—A, L—D, M, F—S, P, M, Z—K, L, A, C, D—U, S, G, A—”  
  
  “That’s enough. Move along.”  
  
  He entered another pseudo voting booth and put earphones over his head. He was told to push the white button when he heard something and the red button when he didn’t hear it anymore. The sound was very high and faint—like a dog whistle that had been pitch-lowered into just audible human range. Richards pushed buttons until he was told to stop.  
  
  He was weighed. His arches were examined. He stood in front of a fluoroscope and put on a lead apron. A doctor, chewing gum and singing something tunelessly under his breath, took several pictures and noted his card number.  
  
  Richards had come in with a group of about thirty. Twelve had made it to the far end of the room. Some were dressed and waiting for the elevator. About a dozen more had been hauled out of line. One of them tried to attack the doctor that had cut him and was felled by a policeman wielding a move-along at full charge. The pal fell as if poleaxed.  
  
  Richards stood at a low table and was asked if he had had some fifty different diseases. Most of them were respiratory in nature. The doctor looked up sharply when Richards said there was a case of influenza in the family.  
  
  “Wife?”  
  
  “No. My daughter.”  
  
  “Age?”  
  
  “A year and a half.”  
  
  “Have you been immunized? Don’t try to lie!” the doctor shouted suddenly, as if Richards had already tried to lie. “We’ll check your health stats.”  
  
  “Immunized July 2023. Booster September 2023. Block health clinic.”  
  
  “Move along.”  
  
  Richards had a sudden urge to reach over the table and pop the maggot’s neck. Instead, he moved along.  
  
  At the last stop, a severe-looking woman doctor with close-cropped hair and an Electric Juicer plugged into one ear asked him if he was a homosexual.  
  
  “No.”  
  
  “Have you ever been arrested on a felony charge?”  
  
  “No.”  
  
  “Do you have any severe phobias? By that I mean—”  
  
  “No.”  
  
  “You better listen to the definition,” she said with a faint touch of condescension. “I mean—”  
  
  “Do I have any unusual and compulsive fears, such as acrophobia or claustrophobia. I don’t.”  
  
  Her lips pressed tightly together, and for a moment she seemed on the verge of sharp comment.  
  
  “Do you use or have you used any hallucinogenic or addictive drugs?”  
  
  “No.”  
  
  “Do you have any relatives who have been arrested on charges of crimes against the government or against the government or against the Network?”  
  
  “No.”  
  
  “Sign this loyalty oath and this Games Commission release form, Mr., uh, Richards.”  
  
  He scratched his signature.  
  
  “Show the orderly your card and tell him the number—”  
  
  He left her in midsentence and gestured at the buck-toothed orderly with his thumb. “Number twenty-six, Bugs.” The orderly brought his things. Richards dressed slowly and went over by the elevator. His anus felt hot and embarrassed, violated, a little slippery with the lubricant the doctor had used.  
  
  When they were all bunched together, the elevator door opened. The bulletproof Judas hole was empty this time. The cop was a skinny man with a large wen beside his nose. “Step to the rear,” he chanted. “Please step to the rear.”  
  
  As the door closed, Richards could see the S’s coming in at the far end of the hall. The doctor with the clipboard was approaching them. Then the doors clicked together, cutting off the view.  
  
  They rode up to the third floor, and the doors opened on a huge, semilit dormitory. Rows and rows of narrow iron-and-canvas cots seemed to stretch out to infinity.  
  
  Two cops began to check them out of the elevator, giving them bed numbers. Richards’s was 940. The cot had one brown blanket and a very flat pillow. Richards lay down on the cot and let his shoes drop to the floor. His feet dangled over the end; there was nothing to be done about it.  
  
  He crossed his arms under his head and stared at the ceiling.  
  
  …Minus 094 and COUNTING…  
  
  He was awakened promptly at six the following morning by a very loud buzzer. For a moment he was foggy, disoriented, wondering if Sheila had bought an alarm clock or what. Then it came to him and he sat up.  
  
  They were led by groups of fifty into a large industrial bathroom where they showed their cards to a camera guarded by a policeman. Richards went to a blue-tiled booth that contained a mirror, a basin, a shower, a toilet. On the shelf above the basin was a row of toothbrushes wrapped in cellophane, an electric razor, a bar of soap, and a half-used tube of toothpaste. A sign tucked into the corner of the mirror read: RESPECT THIS PROPERTY! Beneath it, someone had scrawled: I ONLY RESPECT MY ASS!  
  
  Richards showered, dried with a towel that topped a pile on the toilet tank, shaved, and brushed.  
  
  They were let into a cafeteria where they showed their I.D. cards again. Richards took a tray and pushed it down a stainless steel ledge. He was given a box of cornflakes, a greasy dish of home fries, a scoop of scrambled eggs, a piece of toast as cold and hard as a marble gravestone, a halfpint of milk, a cup of muddy coffee (no cream), an envelope of sugar, an envelope of salt, and a pat of fake butter on a tiny square of oily paper.  
  
  He wolfed the meal; they all did. For Richards it was the first real food, other than greasy pizza wedges and government pill-commodities, that he had eaten in God knew how long. Yet it was oddly bland, as if some vampire chef in the kitchen had sucked all the taste out of it and left only brute nutrients.  
  
  What were they eating this morning? Help pills. Fake milk for the baby. A sudden feeling of desperation swelled over him. Christ when would they start seeing money? Today? Tomorrow? Next week?  
  
  Or maybe that was just a gimmick too, a flashy come-on. Maybe there wasn’t even any rainbow, let alone a pot of gold.  
  
  He sat staring at his empty plate until the seven o’clock buzzer went and they were moved on to the elevators.  
  
  …Minus 093 and COUNTING…  
  
  On the fourth floor Richards’s group of fifty was herded first into a large, furnitureless room ringed with what looked like letter slots. They showed their cards again, and the elevator doors whooshed closed behind them.  
  
  A gaunt man with receding hair with the Games emblem (the silhouette of a human head superimposed over a torch) on his lab coat came into the room.  
  
  “Please undress and remove all valuables from your clothes,” he said. “Then drop your clothes into one of the incinerator slots. You’ll be i  
ssued Games coveralls.” He smiled magnanimously. “You may keep the overalls no matter what your personal Games resolution may be.”  
  
  There was some grumbling, but everyone complied.  
  
  “Hurry, please,” the gaunt man said. He clapped his hands together twice, like a first-grade teacher signaling the end of playtime. “We have lots ahead of us.”  
  
  “Are you going to be a contestant, too?” Richards asked.  
  
  The gaunt man favored him with a puzzled expression. Somebody in the back snickered.  
  
  “Never mind,” Richards said, and stepped out of his trousers.  
  
  He removed his unvaluable valuables and dumped his shirt, pants, and skivvies into a letter slot. There was a brief, hungry flash of flame from somewhere far below.  
  
  The door at the other end opened (there was always a door at the other end; they were like rats in a huge, upward-tending maze: an American maze, Richards reflected), and men trundled in large baskets on wheels, labeled S, M, L, and XL. Richards selected an XL for its length and expected it to hang baggily on his frame, but it fit quite well. The material was soft, clingy, almost like silk, but tougher than silk. A single nylon zipper ran up the front. They were all dark blue, and they all had the Games emblem on the right breast pocket. When the entire group was wearing them, Ben Richards felt as if he had lost his face.  
  
  “This way, please,” the gaunt man said, and ushered them into another waiting room. The inevitable Free-Vee blared and cackled. “You’ll be called in groups of ten.”  
  
  The door beyond the Free-Vee was topped by another sign reading THIS WAY, complete with arrow.  
  
  They sat down. After a while, Richards got up and went to the window and looked out. They were higher up, but it was still raining. The streets were slick and black and wet. He wondered what Sheila was doing.  
  
  …Minus 092 and COUNTING…  
  
  He went through the door, one of a group of ten now, at quarter past ten. They went through single file. Their cards were scanned. There were ten three-sided booths, but these were more substantial. The sides were constructed of drilled soundproof cork paneling. The overhead lighting was soft and indirect. Muzak was emanating from hidden speakers. There was a plush carpet on the floor; Richards’s feet felt startled by something that wasn’t cement.

I don’t dress up much when I’m at home. Like… why would I? I’m literally just in our living room half the day, folding laundry or feeding the dog or catching up on work in my pambahay shorts and a tank top. Nothing wild. Nothing see through. Just… comfortable. But my husband’s sister moved in a few weeks ago while her condo gets renovated. And ever since she got here, she’s been acting like my closet is her business. The comments started small. “Wow, that’s what you wear when your husband’s home?” Or, “I wouldn’t be caught dead in that.” She even made a joke to him like, “If my brother cheated on you, I’d understand.” LIKE???? I let it go the first few times because okay, maybe she’s just being passive-aggressive and I don’t wanna fight. But it didn’t stop. Every other day it’s something. Always about my shorts being too short or my shirt being “sleepware.” She even said I should “have more pride as a wife.” One morning I snapped. I’d just woken up, had coffee, hadn’t even brushed my hair, and she had the nerve to say, “You’re really comfortable looking like that around other people?”

I said, “Yes, because I’m at home. And if my outfit offends you, you’re free to look somewhere else.”She acted so shocked. Went quiet for like a full minute and then said I was being disrespectful and defensive and that all she was doing was trying to help me look more ""presentable"" like she’s doing me some favor. Now my husband says I could’ve handled it better and that I didn’t have to “humiliate” her in our own house. But I’m sorry I live here. I don’t comment on what she wears to sleep or how she leaves her bras hanging in the bathroom. But the second I show skin in my own living room, I’m the problem? I’m starting to feel like I’m going crazy. Like… am I just being sensitive? Or was I right to finally tell her off? I’ve been feeling guilty ever since. She hasn’t talked to me in two days.

1lo7phm,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipping/comments/1lo7phm/tipping_creep_from_its_origins_to_present_day/,Tipping creep from its origins to present day?,"The entire premise of tipping was that the customer wants to give extra money to a specific person for doing specific extra things for them. For example, a waiter checks on you multiple times while you eat dinner, brings fresh rolls, keeps your water glass full, clears off dirty plates as you finish, and suggests a delicious dessert to go with your coffee, which he brings with a pitcher of extra cream bc that’s how you like it. Which yes, is considered now to be a waiter’s job not “extra” but originally this attention was above and beyond just entering and carrying out your order. Another example is giving a bagboy a tip for not only bagging but also carrying and loading your bags for you. 

How did we get where we are now, wherein a tip is asked for when absolutely nothing extra is done for the customer by anyone? Like to go orders and counter service and sandwich lines? 

People need to remember that tipping is based on the customer’s experience, not based on the employee’s actions. Yes I know you made that sandwich, yes I know you put the salad in a box with dressing on the side, yes I know you poured that hot water into a cup and fetched the correct teabag. But none of those things “enhanced” my experience of buying the product, warranting “extra” as a thank you.  

How and when were the decisions made to pay servers less than min wage, because they sometimes got tips? It’s such a huge leap it’s hard to wrap my head around. ",2,1751290572.0,tipping,1,0.75,False

I spent the last two weeks before starting in full-on interview mode: writing STAR stories, second-guessing my answers, tweaking my resume wording daily. I actually used Beyz interview helper to run mock behavioral rounds and prep with the 90s prep which helped take the panic out of “Tell me about a time…” questions.  

Now that I’m in, the contrast is wild.  
No traffic. No freezing office. No awkward small talk while waiting for the microwave.  
I log on in soft clothes with my coffee, open my tasks, and just... work.  
No sensory overload. No performance anxiety (well, not yet). No one watching if I blink weird during meetings.  

I thought I might feel isolated, but honestly I feel more focused than I ever did during on-site internships.  
Slack convos are concise, async check-ins are respectful, and the expectations are way clearer than I feared.

I know this is just week one, and I’m probably still in the “honeymoon phase,” but it’s been a relief after months of pressure just to *get in the door*.

1lo7kuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lo7kuu/the_passage_by_justin_cronin/,The Passage by Justin Cronin:,"ONE  
  
  Before she became the Girl from Nowhere—the One Who Walked In, the First and Last and Only, who lived a thousand years—she was just a little girl in Iowa, named Amy. Amy Harper Bellafonte.  
  
  The day Amy was born, her mother, Jeanette, was nineteen years old. Jeanette named her baby Amy for her own mother, who’d died when Jeanette was little, and gave her the middle name Harper for Harper Lee, the lady who’d written To Kill a Mockingbird, Jeanette’s favorite book—truth be told, the only book she’d made it all the way through in high school. She might have named her Scout, after the little girl in the story, because she wanted her little girl to grow up like that, tough and funny and wise, in a way that she, Jeanette, had never managed to be. But Scout was a name for a boy, and she didn’t want her daughter to have to go around her whole life explaining something like that.  
  
  Amy’s father was a man who came in one day to the restaurant where Jeanette had waited tables since she turned sixteen, a diner everyone called the Box, because it looked like one: like a big chrome shoe box sitting off the county road, backed by fields of corn and beans, nothing else around for miles except a self-serve car wash, the kind where you had to put coins into the machine and do all the work yourself. The man, whose name was Bill Reynolds, sold combines and harvesters, big things like that, and he was a sweet talker who told Jeanette as she poured his coffee and then later, again and again, how pretty she was, how he liked her coal-black hair and hazel eyes and slender wrists, said it all in a way that sounded like he meant it, not the way boys in school had, as if the words were just something that needed to get sa  
id along the way to her letting them do as they liked. He had a big car, a new Pontiac, with a dashboard that glowed like a spaceship and leather seats creamy as butter. She could have loved that man, she thought, really and truly loved him. But he stayed in town only a few days, and then went on his way. When she told her father what had happened, he said he wanted to go looking for him, make him live up to his responsibilities. But what Jeanette knew and didn’t say was that Bill Reynolds was married, a married man; he had a family in Lincoln, all the way clean over in Nebraska. He’d even showed her the pictures in his wallet of his kids, two little boys in baseball uniforms, Bobby and Billy. So no matter how many times her father asked who the man was that had done this to her, she didn’t say. She didn’t even tell him the man’s name.  
  
  And the truth was, she didn’t mind any of it, not really: not the being pregnant, which was easy right until the end, nor the delivery itself, which was bad but fast, nor, especially, having a baby, her little Amy. To tell Jeanette he’d decided to forgive her, her father had done up her brother’s old bedroom as a nursery, carried down the old baby crib from the attic, the one Jeanette herself had slept in, years ago; he’d gone with Jeanette, in the last months before Amy came, to the Walmart to pick out some things she’d need, like pajamas and a little plastic tub and a wind-up mobile to hang over the crib. He’d read a book that said that babies needed things like that, things to look at so their little brains would turn on and begin to work properly. From the start Jeanette always thought of the baby as “her,” because in her heart she wanted a girl, but she knew that wasn’t the sort of thing you should say to anyone, not even to yourself. She’d had a scan at the hospital over in Cedar Falls and asked the woman, a lady in a flowered smock who was running the little plastic paddle over Jeanette’s stomach, if she could tell which it was; but the woman laughed, looking at the pictures on the TV of Jeanette’s baby, sleeping away inside her, and said, Hon, this baby’s shy. Sometimes you can tell and others you can’t, and this is one of those times. So Jeanette didn’t know, which she decided was fine with her, and after she and her father had emptied out her brother’s room and taken down his old pennants and posters—Jose Canseco, a music group called Killer Picnic, the Bud Girls—and seen how faded and banged up the walls were, they painted it a color the label on the can called “Dreamtime,” which somehow was both pink and blue at once—good whatever the baby turned out to be. Her father hung a wallpaper border along the edge of the ceiling, a repeating pattern of ducks splashing in a puddle, and cleaned up an old maple rocking chair he’d found at the auction hall, so that when Jeanette brought the baby home, she’d have a place to sit and hold her.  
  
  The baby came in summer, the girl she’d wanted and named Amy Harper Bellafonte; there seemed no point in using the name Reynolds, the last name of a man Jeanette guessed she’d never see again and, now that Amy was here, no longer wanted to. And Bellafonte: you couldn’t do better than a name like that. It meant “beautiful fountain,” and that’s what Amy was. Jeanette fed and rocked and changed her, and when Amy cried in the middle of the night because she was wet or hungry or didn’t like the dark, Jeanette stumbled down the hall to her room, no matter what the hour was or how tired she felt from working at the Box, to pick her up and tell her she was there, she would always be there, you cry and I’ll come running, that’s a deal between us, you and me, forever and ever, my little Amy Harper Bellafonte. And she would hold and rock her until dawn began to pale the window shades and she could hear birds singing in the branches of the trees outside.  
  
  Then Amy was three and Jeanette was alone. Her father had died, a heart attack they told her, or else a stroke. It wasn’t the kind of thing anyone needed to check. Whatever it was, it hit him early one winter morning as he was walking to his truck to drive to work at the elevator; he had just enough time to put down his coffee on the fender before he fell over and died, never spilling a drop. She still had her job at the Box, but the money wasn’t enough now, not for Amy or any of it, and her brother, in the Navy somewhere, didn’t answer her letters. God invented Iowa, he always said, so people could leave it and never come back. She wondered what she would do.  
  
  Then one day a man came into the diner. It was Bill Reynolds. He was different, somehow, and the change was no good. The Bill Reynolds she remembered—and she had to admit she still thought of him from time to time, about little things mostly, like the way his sandy hair flopped over his forehead when he talked, or how he blew over his coffee before he sipped it, even when it wasn’t hot anymore—there was something about him, a kind of warm light from inside that you wanted to be near. It reminded her of those little plastic sticks that you snapped so the liquid inside made them glow. This was the same man, but the glow was gone. He looked older, thinner. She saw he hadn’t shaved or combed his hair, which was greasy and standing all whichaway, and he wasn’t wearing a pressed polo like before but just an ordinary work shirt like the ones her father had worn, untucked and stained under the arms. He looked like he’d spent all night out in the weather, or in a car somewhere. He caught her eye at the door and she followed him to a booth in back.  
  
  —What are you doing here?  
  
  —I left her, he said, and as he looked at where she stood, she smelled beer on his breath, and sweat, and dirty clothes. I’ve gone and done it, Jeanette. I left my wife. I’m a free man.  
  
  —You drove all this way to tell me that?  
  
  —I’ve thought about you. He cleared his throat. A lot. I’ve thought about us.  
  
  —What us? There ain’t no us. You can’t come in like you’re doing and say you’ve been thinking about us.  
  
  He sat up straight. —Well, I’m doing it. I’m doing it right now.  
  
  —It’s busy in here, can’t you see that? I can’t be talking to you like this. You’ll have to order something.  
  
  —Fine, he answered, but he didn’t look at the menu on the wall, just kept his eyes on her. I’ll have a cheeseburger. A cheeseburger and a Coke.  
  
  As she wrote down the order and the words swam in her vision, she realized she had started to cry. She felt like she hadn’t slept in a month, a year. The weight of exhaustion was held up only by the thinnest sliver of her will. There was a time when she’d wanted to do something with her life—cut hair, maybe, get her certificate, open a little shop, move to a real city, like Chicago or Des Moines, rent an apartment, have friends. She’d always held in her mind a picture of herself sitting in a restaurant, a coffee shop but nice; it was fall, and cold outside, and she was alone at a small table by the window, reading a book. On her table was a steaming mug of tea. She would look up to the window to see the people on the street of the city she was in, hustling to and fro in their heavy coats and hats, and see her own face there, too, reflected in the window, hovering over the image of all the people outside. But as she stood there, these ideas seemed like they belonged to a different person entirely. Now there was Amy, sick half the time with a cold or a stomach thing she’d gotten at the ratty day care where she spent the days while Jeanette was working at the Box, and her father dead just like that, so fast it was as if he’d fallen through a trapdoor on the surface of the earth, and Bill Reynolds sitting at the table like he’d just stepped out for a second, not four years.  
  
  —Why are you doing this to me?  
  
  He held her eyes with his own a long moment and touched the top of her hand.—Meet me later. Please.  
  
  He ended up living in the house with her and Amy. She couldn’t say if she had invited him to do this or if it had just somehow happened. Either way, she was instantly sorry. This Bill Reynolds: who was he really? He’d left his wife and boys, Bobby and Billy in their baseball suits, all of it behind in Nebraska. The Pontiac was gone, and he had no job either; that had ended, too. The economy the way it was, he explained, nobody was buying a goddamn thing. He said he had a plan, but the only plan that she could see seemed to be him sitting in the house doing nothing for Amy or even cleaning up the breakfast dishes, while she worked all day at th  
e Box. He hit her the first time after he’d been living there three months; he was drunk, and once he did it, he burst out crying and said, over and over, how sorry he was. He was on his knees, blubbering, like she’d done something to him. She had to understand, he was saying, how hard it all was, all the changes in his life, it was more than a man, any man, could take. He loved her, he was sorry, nothing like that would happen again, ever. He swore it. Not to her and not to Amy. And in the end, she heard herself saying she was sorry too.  
  
  He’d hit her over money; when winter came, and she didn’t have enough money in her checking account to pay the heating oil man, he hit her again.  
  
  —Goddamnit, woman. Can’t you see I’m in a situation here?  
  
  She was on the kitchen floor, holding the side of her head. He’d hit her hard enough to lift her off her feet. Funny, now that she was down there she saw how dirty the floor was, filthy and stained, with clumps of dust and who-knew-what all rowed against the base of the cabinets where you couldn’t usually see. Half her mind was noticing this while the other half said, You aren’t thinking straight, Jeanette; Bill hit you and knocked a wire loose, so now you’re worrying over the dust. Something funny was happening with the way the world sounded, too. Amy was watching television upstairs, on the little set in her room, but Jeanette could hear it like it was playing inside her head, Barney the purple dinosaur and a song about brushing your teeth; and then from far away, she heard the sound of the oil truck pulling away, its engine grinding as it turned out of the drive and headed down the county road.  
  
  —It ain’t your house, she said.  
  
  —You’re right about that. Bill took a bottle of Old Crow from over the sink and poured some in a jelly jar, though it was only ten o’clock in the morning. He sat at the table but didn’t cross his legs like he meant to get comfortable. Ain’t my oil, either.  
  
  Jeanette rolled over and tried to stand but couldn’t. She watched him drink for a minute.  
  
  —Get out.  
  
  He laughed, shaking his head, and took a sip of whiskey.  
  
  —That’s funny, he said. You telling me that from the floor like you are.  
  
  —I mean what I say. Get out.  
  
  Amy came into the room. She was holding the stuffed bunny she still carried everywhere, and wearing a pair of overalls, the good ones Jeanette had bought her at the outlet mall, the OshKosh B’Gosh, with the strawberries embroidered on the bib. One of the straps had come undone and was flopping at her waist. Jeanette realized Amy must have done this herself, because she had to go to the bathroom.  
You’re on the floor, Mama.  
  
  —I’m okay, honey. She got to her feet to show her. Her left ear was ringing a little, like in a cartoon, birds flying around her head. She saw there was a little blood, too, on her hand; she didn’t know where this had come from. She picked Amy up and did her best to smile. See? Mama just took a spill, that’s all. You need to go, honey? You need to use the potty?  
  
  —Look at you, Bill was saying. Will you look at yourself? He shook his head again and drank. You stupid twat. She probably ain’t even mine.  
  
  —Mama, the girl said and pointed, you cut yourself. Your nose is cut.  
  
  And whether it was what she’d heard or the blood, the little girl began to cry.  
  
  —See what you done? Bill said, and to Amy, Come on now. Ain’t no big thing, sometimes folks argue, that’s just how it is.  
  
  —I’m telling you again, just leave.  
  
  —Then what would you do, tell me that. You can’t even fill the oil tank.  
  
  —You think I don’t know that? I sure as by God don’t need you to tell me that.  
  
  Amy had begun to wail. Holding her, Jeanette felt the spread of hot moisture across her waist as the little girl released her bladder.  
  
  —For Pete’s sake, shut that kid up.  
  
  She held Amy tight against her chest. —You’re right. She ain’t yours. She ain’t yours and never will be. You leave or I’m calling the sheriff, I swear  
  
  —Don’t you do me like this, Jean. I mean it.  
  
  —Well, I’m doing it. That’s just what I’m doing.  
  
  Then he was up and slamming through the house, taking his things, tossing them back into the cardboard cartons he’d used to carry them into the house, months ago. Why hadn’t she thought it right then, how strange it was that he didn’t even have a proper suitcase? She sat at the kitchen table holding Amy on her lap, watching the clock over the stove and counting off the minutes until he returned to the kitchen to hit her again.  
  
  But then she heard the front door swing open, and his heavy footsteps on the porch. He went in and out awhile, carrying the boxes, leaving the front door open so cold air spilled through the house. Finally he came into the kitchen, tracking snow, leaving little patches of it waffled to the floor with the soles of his boots.  
  
  —Fine. Fine. You want me to leave? You watch me. He took the bottle of Old Crow from the table. Last chance, he said.  
  
  Jeanette said nothing, didn’t even look at him.  
  
  —So that’s how it is. Fine. You mind I have one for the road?  
  
  Which was when Jeanette reached out and swatted his glass across the kitchen, smacked it with her open hand like a ping-pong ball with a paddle. She knew she was going to do this for about half a second before she did, knowing it wasn’t the best idea she’d ever had, but by then it was too late. The glass hit the wall with a hollow thud and fell to the floor, unbroken. She closed her eyes, holding Amy tight, knowing what would come. For a moment the sound of the glass rolling on the floor seemed to be the only thing in the room. She could feel Bill’s anger rising off him like waves of heat.  
  
  —You just see what the world has in store for you, Jeanette. You remember I said that.  
  
  Then his footsteps carried him out of the room and he was gone.  
  
  She paid the oil man what she could and turned the thermostat down to fifty, to make it last. See, Amy honey, it’s like a big camping trip we’re on, she said as she stuffed the little girl’s hands into mittens and wedged a hat onto her head. There now, it’s not so cold, not really. It’s like an adventure. They slept together under a pile of old quilts, the room so icy their breath fogged the air over their faces. She took a job at night, cleaning up at the high school, leaving Amy with a neighbor lady, but when the woman took sick and had to go into the hospital, Jeanette had to leave Amy alone. She explained to Amy what to do: stay in bed, don’t answer the door, just close your eyes and I’ll be home before you know it. She’d make sure Amy was asleep before creeping out the door, then stride quickly down the snow-crusted drive to where she’d parked her car, away from the house, so Amy wouldn’t hear it turning over.  
  
  But then she made the mistake one night of telling someone about this, another woman on the work crew, when the two of them had stepped out for a smoke. Jeanette had never liked smoking at all and didn’t want to spend the money, but the cigarettes helped her stay awake, and without a smoke break there was nothing to look forward to, just more toilets to scrub and halls to be mopped. She told the woman, whose name was Alice, not to tell anyone, she knew she could get in trouble leaving Amy alone like that, but of course that’s just what Alice did; she went straight to the superintendent, who fired Jeanette on the spot. Leaving a child like that ain’t right, he told her in his office by the boilers, a room no bigger than ten feet square with a dented metal desk and an old easy chair with the plush popping out and a calendar on the wall that wasn’t even the right year; the air was always so hot and close in there Jeanette could barely breathe. He said, You count your lucky stars I’m not calling the county on you. She wondered when she’d become someone a person could say this to and not be wrong. He’d been nice enough to her until then, and maybe she could have made him understand the situation, that without the money from cleaning she didn’t know what she’d do, but she was too tired to find the words. She took her last check and drove home in her crappy old car, the Kia she’d bought in high school when it was already six years old and falling apart so fast she could practically see the nuts and bolts bouncing on the pavement in her rearview mirror; and when she stopped at the Quick Mart to buy a pack of Capris and then the engine wouldn’t start up again, she started to cry. She couldn’t make herself stop crying for half an hour.  
  
  The problem was the battery; a new one cost her eighty-three dollars at Sears, but by then she’d missed a week of work and lost her job at the Box, too. She had just enough money left to leave, packing up their things in a couple of grocery sacks and the cartons Bill had left behind.  
  
  No one ever knew what became of them. The house sat empty; the pipes froze and split like bursting fruit. When spring came, the water poured from them for days and days until the utility company, realizing nobody was paying the bill, sent a couple of men to turn it off. The mice moved in, and when an upstairs window was broken in a summer thunderstorm, the swallows; they built their nests in the bedroom where Jeanette and Amy had slept in the cold, and soon the house was filled with the sound and smell of birds.  
  
  In Dubuque, Jeanette worked the night shift at a gas station, Amy sleeping on the sofa in the back room, until the owner found out and sent her packing. It was summer, they were living in the Kia, using the washroom behind the station to clean up, so leaving was just a matter of driving away. For a time they stayed with a friend of Jeanette’s in Rochester, a girl she’d known in school who’d gone up there for a nursing degree; Jeanette took a job mopping floors at the same hospital where the friend worked, but the pay was just minimum wage, and the friend’s apartment was too small for them to stay; she moved into a motel, but there was no one to look after Amy, the friend couldn’t do it and didn’t know anyone who could, and they ended up living in the Kia again. It was September; already a chill was in the air. The radio spoke all day of war. She drove south, getting as far as Memphis before the Kia gave out for good.  
  
  The man who picked them up in the Mercedes said his name was John—a lie, she guessed, from the way he said it, like a child telling a story about who broke the lamp, sizing her up for a second before he spoke. My name is … John. She guessed he was fifty, but she wasn’t a good judge of these things. He had a well-trimmed beard and was wearing a tight dark suit, like a funeral director. While he drove he kept glancing at Amy in the rearview mirror, adjusting himself in his seat, asking Jeanette questions about herself, where she was going, the kinds of things she liked to do, what had brought her to the Great State of Tennessee. The car reminded her of Bill Reynolds’s Grand Prix, only nicer. With the windows closed you could barely hear anythin  
g outside, and the seats were so soft she felt like she was sitting in a dish of ice cream. She felt like falling asleep. By the time they pulled into the motel she hardly cared what was going to happen. It seemed inevitable. They were near the airport; the land was flat, like Iowa, and in the twilight she could see the lights of the planes circling the field, moving in slow, sleepy arcs like targets in a shooting gallery.  
  
  Amy, honey, Mama’s going to go inside with this nice man for a minute, okay? You just look at your picture book, honey.  
  
  He was polite enough, going about his business, calling her baby and such, and before he left he put fifty dollars on the nightstand—enough for Jeanette to buy a room for the night for her and Amy.  
  
  But others weren’t as nice.  
  
  During the night, she’d lock Amy in the room with the TV on to make some noise and walk out to the highway in front of the motel and just kind of stand there, and it didn’t take long. Somebody would stop, always a man, and once they’d worked things out, she’d take him back to the motel. Before she let the man inside she’d go into the room by herself and carry Amy to the bathroom, where she’d made a bed for her in the tub out of some extra blankets and pillows.  
  
  Amy was six. She was quiet, barely talked most of the time, but she’d taught herself to read some, from looking at the same books over and over, and could do her numbers. One time they were watching Wheel of Fortune, and when the time came for the woman to spend the money she’d won, the little girl knew just what she could buy, that she couldn’t afford the vacation to Cancún but could have the living room set with enough money left over for the his-and-her golf clubs. Jeanette thought it was probably smart of Amy to figure this out, maybe more than smart, and she guessed she should probably be in school, but Jeanette didn’t know where there were any schools around there. It was all auto-body-repair and pawn shops and motels like the one they lived in, the SuperSix. The owner was a man who looked a lot like Elvis Presley, not the handsome young one but the old fat one with the sweaty hair and chunky gold glasses that made his eyes look like fish swimming in a tank, and he wore a satin jacket with a lightning bolt down the back, just like Elvis had. Mostly he just sat at his desk behind the counter, playing solitaire and smoking a little cigar with a plastic tip. Jeanette paid him in cash each week for the room and if she threw in an extra fifty he didn’t bother her any. One day he asked her if she had anything for protection, if maybe she wanted to buy a gun from him. She said sure, how much, and he told her another hundred. He showed her a rusty-looking little revolver, a .22, and when she put it in her hand right there in the office it didn’t seem like much at all, let alone something that could shoot a person. But it was small enough to fit in the purse she carried out to the highway and she didn’t think it would be a bad thing to have around. —Careful where you point that, the manager said, and Jeanette said, Okay, if you’re afraid of it, it must work. You sold yourself a gun.  
  
  And she was glad she had it. Just knowing it was in her purse made her realize she’d been afraid before and now wasn’t, or at least not so much. The gun was like a secret, the secret of who she was, like she was carrying the last bit of herself in her purse. The other Jeanette, the one who stood on the highway in her stretchy top and skirt, who cocked her hip and smiled and said, What you want, baby? There something I can help you with tonight?—that Jeanette was a made-up person, like a woman in a story she wasn’t sure she wanted to know the end of.  
  
  The man who picked her up the night it happened wasn’t the one she would have thought. The bad ones you could usually tell right off, and sometimes she said no thanks and just kept walking. But this one looked nice, a college boy she guessed, or at least young enough to go to college, and nicely dressed, wearing crisp khaki pants and one of those shirts with the little man on the horse swinging the hammer. He looked like someone going on a date, which made her laugh to herself when she got into the car, a big Ford Expo with a rack on the top for a bike or something else.  
  
  But then a funny thing happened. He wouldn’t drive to the motel. Some men wanted her to do them right there, in the car, not even bothering to pull over, but when she started in on this, thinking that was what he wanted, he pushed her gently away. He wanted to take her out, he said. She asked, What do you mean, out?  
  
  —Someplace nice, he explained. Wouldn’t you rather go someplace nice? I’ll pay you more than whatever you usually get.  
  
  She thought about Amy sleeping back in the room and guessed it wouldn’t make much difference, one way or the other. As long as it ain’t more than an hour, she said. Then you got to take me back.  
  
  But it was more than an hour, a lot more; by the time they got where they were going, Jeanette was afraid. He pulled up to a house with a big sign over the porch showing three shapes that looked almost like letters but not quite, and Jeanette knew what it was: a fraternity. Some place a bunch of rich boys lived and got drunk on their daddy’s money, pretending to go to school to become doctors and lawyers.  
  
  —You’ll like my friends, he said. Come on, I want you to meet them.  
  
  —I ain’t going in there, she said. You take me back now.  
  
  He paused, both hands on the wheel, and when she saw his face and what was in his eyes, the slow mad hunger, he suddenly didn’t look like such a nice boy anymore.  
  
  —That, he said, is not an option. I’d have to say that’s not on the menu just now.  
  
  —The hell it ain’t.  
  
  She threw the door of the truck open and made to walk away, never mind she didn’t know where she was, but then he was out too, and he grabbed her by the arm. It was pretty clear now what was waiting inside the house, what he wanted, how everything was going to shape up. It was her fault for not understanding this before—long before, maybe as far back as the Box on the day Bill Reynolds had come in. She realized the boy was afraid, too—that somebody was making him do this, the friends inside the house, or it felt like it to him, anyway. But she didn’t care. He got behind her and tried to get his arm around her neck to lock her with his elbow, and she hit him, hard, where it counted, with the back of her fist, which made him yell, calling her bitch and whore and all the rest, and strike her across the face. She lost her balance and fell backward, and then he was on top of her, his legs astride her waist like a jockey riding a horse, slapping and hitting, trying to pin her arms. Once he did this it would all be over. He probably wouldn’t care if she was conscious or not, she thought, when he did it; none of them would. She reached into her purse where it lay on the grass. Her life was so strange to her it didn’t seem like it was even her own anymore, if it had ever been hers to begin with. But everything made sense to a gun. A gun knew what it was, and she felt the cool metal of the revolver slide into her palm, like it wanted to be there. Her mind said, Don’t think, Jeanette, and she pushed the barrel against the side of the boy’s head, feeling the skin and bone where it pressed against him, figuring that was close enough she couldn’t miss, and then she pulled the trigger.  
  
  It took her the rest of the night to get home. After the boy had fallen off her, she’d run as fast as she could to the biggest road she could see, a wide boulevard glowing under streetlights, just in time to grab a bus. She didn’t know if there was blood on her clothes or what, but the driver hardly looked at her as he explained how to get back to the airport, and she sat in the back where no one could see. In any case, the bus was almost empty. She had no idea where she was; the bus inched along through neighborhoods of houses and stores, all dark, past a big church and then signs for the zoo, and finally entered downtown, where she stood in a Plexiglas shelter, shivering in the damp, and waited for a second bus. She’d lost her watch somehow and didn’t know the time. Maybe it had come off somehow when they were fighting and the police could use it as a clue. But it was just a Timex she’d bought at Walgreens, and she thought it couldn’t tell them much. The gun was what would do it; she’d tossed it on the lawn, or so she remembered. Her hand was still a little numb from the force of it going off in her fist, the  
bones chiming like a tuning fork that wouldn’t stop.  
  
  By the time she reached the motel the sun was rising; she felt the city waking up. Under the ashy light, she let herself into the room. Amy was asleep with the television still on, an infomercial for some kind of exercise machine. A muscled man with a ponytail and huge, doglike mouth was barking silently out of the screen. Jeanette figured she didn’t have much more than a couple of hours before somebody came. That was dumb of her, leaving the gun behind, but there wasn’t any point worrying over that now. She splashed some water on her face and brushed her teeth, not looking at herself in the mirror, then changed into jeans and a T-shirt and took her old clothes, the little skirt and stretchy top and fringed jacket she’d worn to the highway, streaked with blood and bits of things she didn’t want to know about, behind the motel to the reeking dumpster, where she shoved them in.  
  
  It seemed as if time had compressed somehow, like an accordion; all the years she had lived and everything that had happened to her were suddenly squeezed below the weight of this one moment. She remembered the early mornings when Amy was just a baby, how she’d held and rocked her by the window, often falling asleep herself. Those had been good mornings, something she’d always remember. She packed a few things into Amy’s Power puff Girls knapsack and some clothing and money into a grocery sack for herself. Then she turned off the television and gently shook Amy awake.  
  
  “Come on, honey. Wake up now. We got to go.”  
  
  The little girl was half asleep but allowed Jeanette to dress her. She was always like this in the morning, dazed and sort of out of it, and Jeanette was glad it wasn’t some other time of day, when she’d have to do more coaxing and explaining. She gave the girl a cereal bar and a can of warm grape pop to drink, and then the two of them went out to the highway where the bus had let Jeanette off.

Life throws battles at us every day—small frustrations, like spilling coffee on your shirt, or bigger fights, like navigating stress, loss, or uncertainty. Some days, it feels like the universe is testing your limits. Yet, in the thick of it, there’s power in finding the courage to be grateful anyway.
Gratitude isn’t about ignoring the struggle. It’s about staring it down and choosing to see the glimmers of good that still exist. Maybe it’s the warmth of that coffee before it spilled, a kind word from a friend, or just the fact that you’re still here, fighting. It takes guts to pause in the chaos and say, “I’m thankful for something, even now.”
Today, I’m grateful for the strength to keep going, for the lessons in the mess, and for the tiny wins that remind me I’m not alone in this. What’s your daily battle, and what’s one thing you’re finding the courage to be grateful for?

• Travel dates: June 20-27 (but stayed in Paris a week June 13-20)  
Link to the Paris travel guide: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1lnetx6/our\_paris\_trip\_report\_with\_two\_kids\_ages\_8\_4\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1lnetx6/our_paris_trip_report_with_two_kids_ages_8_4_for/)  
• Trip length: 1 week in London - 2 weeks in Europe  
• Who traveled: 2 adults, 2 kids (8 and 4)  
• Travel style: We leaned into some of the touristy spots since it was our kids’ first time in London. That said, we usually prefer to experience places more like locals—seeking out everyday life over big attractions.  
• Approx. budget: We didn't have a budget per say but coming from Canada, it was VERY expensive.  
• Countries / cities visited:  
Paris  
London

**Flights/Train + Taxi**  
• Airport info: I can't comment on the airport experience since we arrived in London via Eurostar from Paris.

• Eurostar prices: We booked several months in advance and paid about $150 USD per person. Since then, others have recommended booking as early as six months ahead to find fares closer to €65/£.

•Arrival at St Pancras: St Pancras is huge and was packed when we arrived—especially on a Friday evening. It took us around 10 minutes to reach the taxi queue, followed by a 30-minute wait for a black cab.

•Taxis from St Pancras: Taxi fares vary depending on your destination. We stayed near the Chelsea/Fulham border, away from the main tourist areas. The ride took about an hour and cost £56 on a Friday evening. We were too tired and overloaded to take the metro, but in retrospect, we should have.

Thanks to u/onecheesecake1516 for pointing this link out about fares: [https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/taxis-and-minicabs/taxi-fares](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/taxis-and-minicabs/taxi-fares)

• Return via Eurostar: We used St Pancras again for our return to Paris. It was busy and a bit chaotic, but still easy to navigate. Eurostar is fast and reliable, with a smooth setup at the station—even with kids. It’s a bit like an airport, with security and passport checks.

**Local transit - Metro + Taxis**  
• Metro: The London metro isn’t the easiest to use, but it’s convenient—when it works. Unfortunately, during our week there, there were constant “severe” or “critical” delays (their words), which really slowed things down. A couple of times, we even left the station after staff told us it would take too long to get where we were going. We can’t speak for how it usually runs, but during our stay, it was a bit of a mess. On the positive side, it covers most of the places you’ll want to visit. Just be sure to check the front of the train for the final destination—multiple lines run through the same stations, so it’s easy to hop on the wrong one if you’re not paying attention.

The metro felt safe and got us across the city quickly, which was great—London is a *big* city. Coming from Paris, we really noticed just how massive it is. As with any big city, stay aware of your surroundings: keep backpacks in front or use a chest bag like I did—it’s much harder for anyone to access without you noticing. Just use common sense and stay alert. That said, we never felt unsafe or threatened at any point during our trip.

• Red bus: Now we're talking! We quickly discovered that buses were our favorite way to get around London. They're everywhere, cover a huge part of the city, run frequently, and are affordable. In most cases, the bus dropped us off exactly where we wanted to go. They're also roomy enough for strollers, and the kids loved sitting on the upper deck to enjoy the view.

• Payment: One of our favorite things about London’s transit system was how easy it is to pay. Just tap your phone (Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc.) on the card reader at the entrance—super quick and no need to buy tickets in advance. Even better, there’s a daily fare cap: once you reach the maximum charge for the day, you can keep riding without paying more.

Also, kids under 11 travel free on buses, the Tube, and other Transport for London (TfL) services when accompanied by an adult. You don’t need to do anything special—just bring them through the wide gate with you.

• National Rail services: We only used it once, but it’s worth noting that it operates a bit differently from the Tube. It's part of the broader rail network and not always covered by the same fare system, depending on where you're going. For our trip, we took the Southern line and booked tickets in advance through their website. We picked them up at the station using the self-service machine. Important detail: you’ll need the physical credit card you used to book online, since the machine requires it to validate and release your tickets.

Also, make sure to plan your journey carefully—our train only ran once per hour, so missing it would’ve meant a long wait.

• Taxis: We used the Gett app once to book a taxi—it worked well and got us a cab in a few minutes. That said, I really recommend taking the bus or the metro instead. Traffic in London is constant, so taxis take a long time and can get expensive quickly.

**Accommodations**  
•Airbnb  
•Price: Around 2500$ for a week  
•Location: Fulham

For our family, staying in Airbnbs has worked best when we travel. We know this choice isn’t for everyone and can be controversial in some places, but having an entire apartment to ourselves—where we can cook, move around freely, and maintain a routine similar to home—really helps our kids feel more comfortable and settled. A single hotel room for a week just doesn’t work for us.  
London has a lot of Airbnb options, so it’s worth taking the time to explore. Our Airbnb was amazing—spacious and open, with a separate room just for the kids that had two single beds. We honestly could have stayed there forever!

As for where to stay: I can’t speak for all of London since one week isn’t enough to explore everything, but generally, areas within zones 1, 2, and 3 feel very safe and are conveniently located near most attractions. London is a large city with lots of diverse neighborhoods, but these zones cover central and inner areas where you’ll find good transport connections and plenty of restaurants, shops, and things to do.

In terms of safety, London is overall quite safe, especially in these central zones, though like any big city, it’s wise to stay aware of your surroundings, especially at night. Popular and well-connected areas to consider include Kensington, Chelsea, Southbank, Covent Garden, and Camden. These neighborhoods offer a good mix of convenience, safety, and atmosphere for visitors.

That said, if you really want to stay close to central London and all the main tourist spots, Fulham might feel a bit far. We usually had to travel between 30 and 45 minutes to get around. On the plus side, we absolutely loved where we stayed—it was a quiet, cozy neighborhood with a very local and peaceful vibe.

**Food & Restaurants**  
• Food & Dining:  
We mixed and matched between groceries, quick grabs from street spots, and dining out at pubs.

•Groceries:  
We shopped at Sainsbury's, a local supermarket chain that had everything we needed to keep our apartment stocked with snacks and essentials. Prices were reasonable, and we always made sure to have bars, fruit, and water handy wherever we went.

•On the go:  
London is full of diverse coffee spots and street food on every corner, making it super easy to grab something while walking.

•Restaurants:  
Our rule of thumb: if the menu has pictures, we usually skip it. Tourist traps rarely serve great food, so we prefer local pubs where kids are welcome—yes! Kids are very welcome in pubs, and many even offer kids’ menus, so don’t feel out of place. For dinner, we alternated between eating out in our neighborhood and cooking at the apartment. London’s diversity means you can enjoy everything from Middle Eastern cuisine to traditional English roast. However, not every place is a hit, so it’s a good idea to choose your restaurants carefully in advance. We found that some spots were disappointing, especially given the high prices due to the currency exchange.

**Traveling with Kids**  
• What the kids loved:  
The European vibe of the city—something totally new for them.  
The food: so diversified, they loved to try everything.  
The sheer number of things to do.  
The red buses.  
Frequent stops at playgrounds and parks.

• Activities That Worked Really Well:  
Paddington Experience  
Harry Potter Studio Tour  
Diana's memorial playground + Hyde park  
Football stadium visit

• Tips for a Smoother Experience:  
Always keep snacks in the stroller—familiar ones like fruit, bars, applesauce, and water kept our kids happy and energized.

Our 4-year-old usually doesn’t use the stroller much anymore, but in London he spent a LOT of time in it. A lightweight, foldable stroller was a lifesaver.  
Plan your route with playgrounds and parks in mind—we stopped at one nearly every two hours to let them burn off some energy.  
Leave space in the schedule for downtime. London has a lot to offer, but kids need breaks.  
When possible, book tickets and make reservations in advance—it saves time and avoids disappointment.

• What Was Harder Than Expected:  
It wasn’t necessarily hard, but we walked all day—leaving the apartment around 9–10 a.m. and returning by 6–7 p.m. Our 8-year-old kept up like a champ, but was definitely wiped out by the end of the day. It’s easy to forget that even older kids aren’t adults, and they need rest.  
On the upside, there are parks and green spaces everywhere so it was easy for us to take breaks and play around, let the kids have some freedom.

**Activities & Attractions**  
Here goes the list of everything we did during our 6 days in London:

Day 1: Train + Fulham discovery  
Route: St Pancras -> Fulham  
We were pretty tired from all the moving around in Paris, the train ride, the cab ride, and everything else. The kids needed a break from all the grown-up stuff and were getting a bit grumpy and restless. Once we dropped off our bags at our (amazing) Airbnb, we headed out for a walk to explore the neighborhood where we’d be staying for the week. Fulham’s a pretty chill spot in southwest London — kinda like a quiet little village in the city. Lots of green spaces, cozy pubs, and local shops. It’s great if you want somewhere calm and more local but still not too far from downtown. Perfect for families or anyone who wants to get away from the usual tourist buzz.

We found a great spot called the Fulham Arms (shoutout!) and stopped there for dinner and a few drinks. The kids had their own menu and even got crayons and coloring books from the waiter, making it a perfect first pub experience in London. After that, we headed back to get a good night’s rest.

Day 2: NHM + Science Museum  
Route: Fulham → South Kensington → Both museums → Hyde Park → Diana’s Memorial Playground

We started the day visiting two (FREE!) museums right next to each other—the Natural History Museum and the Science Museum. We kicked things off at the Science Museum, which has tons of free exhibits for all ages. It was really interesting, and most exhibits were amazing. Our 4-year-old loved the big, shiny vehicles but got a bit bored after about an hour and a half of looking at displays behind glass. The older kid was more engaged.

Next, we crossed over to the Natural History Museum. They had a fantastic dinosaur exhibit and an interactive section about planet Earth, earthquakes, and more. We spent about two hours there, but it was VERY crowded and a bit tricky to navigate with kids and a stroller, so be prepared.

After that, we walked about 15 minutes to Hyde Park, a massive green space with a big lake in the middle. The kids loved running around and exploring. Our final stop was Diana’s Memorial Playground, which might just be the best free playground I’ve ever seen. There’s a pirate ship, slides, parkour areas in what my son called the “forest,” a water play feature, a small river (perfect for a hot 30+ degree day), swings, games, toilets, a small café, ice cream—the list goes on. Like everywhere in London, it was crowded, but we all really loved it. We spent a good chunk of the afternoon there before facing another severe metro delay on the way back. Luckily, the bus saved us, even though it turned into an hour-long ride.

Day 3: City of London + the tourist spots  
Route: Metro to Monument → The Garden at 120 → Tower of London → Tower Bridge → Borough Market → Tate → Barbican

My wife knows me well—I’m not a fan of big touristy spots, and this was the day I was dreading. But hey, when in London, you kind of have to see the classics, so we packed them all into one big day. We started with a metro ride into the City of London, which is basically London’s financial district and historic core. If you’re thinking of going to the Sky Garden, this is where it is—just make sure to book ahead, because we didn’t and missed out. Instead, we went to The Garden at 120, just a couple of blocks away. It’s a smaller, lesser-known rooftop garden, completely free, with a great 360° view of the city. We waited about five minutes to get in and spent half an hour enjoying the view.

Next, we walked south to the famous Tower of London. We didn’t go inside (the day was already packed), but walked around the outside of this incredible historic site before crossing Tower Bridge. The view from the bridge is amazing, and it’s a proper bucket list landmark—just be warned, it’s *very* crowded, and people lose all sense of personal space.

Once across the Thames, we headed west along the river toward Borough Market. We had skipped breakfast to leave room for all the food we knew was waiting for us, as seen all over Instagram. The market is legendary, and the food didn’t disappoint—we tried seven different things and loved it all. That said, the crowds were absolutely overwhelming. It was honestly one of the most chaotic places I’ve ever been: influencers blocking walkways for selfies, families shouting for lost kids, and no one understanding how a queue works. The setting under the bridge with train sounds above is incredible, but the crowd made it hard to enjoy. Avoid weekends if you can—try a weekday morning instead.

After stuffing ourselves, we walked about 10 minutes further west to the Tate Modern—one of the world’s most famous contemporary art museums. There was a short five-minute queue, and we were in. With young kids, we kept it simple and visited just the second floor, where we saw works by Matisse, Pollock, and more. Quick bathroom break, and then we crossed the Millennium Bridge heading north to our final stop of the day: the Barbican.

The Barbican is a fascinating spot—part brutalist architectural wonder, part arts and culture hub. It’s a mix of residential buildings, performance venues, and public spaces, all connected by elevated walkways, gardens, and quiet courtyards. It feels like a concrete maze at first, but once you’re in it, there’s something peaceful and almost futuristic about the atmosphere. It's a cool place to explore if you're into architecture, or just want to wander somewhere off the typical tourist path.

Day 4: Paddington + Soho  
Route: Taxi to London Eye → Paddington Experience → Westminster Abbey → Chinatown → Soho

We started our day walking to the metro, headed to our timed tickets for the Paddington Experience—but surprise! The metro was down. We were suddenly in a rush and ended up hopping into a £30 cab, aiming straight for the London Eye area to make it on time. Our family loves Paddington, and the experience definitely didn’t disappoint.

The Paddington Experience is a super charming, interactive attraction for families and fans of the bear. You move through beautifully designed rooms that recreate iconic scenes from the books and movies—like Paddington’s home, Paddington Station, and even a small “train ride.” It’s super well done, very kid-friendly (though adults will enjoy it too), and includes lots of cute surprises along the way. There's storytelling, interactive displays, themed snacks, and of course, plenty of photo ops. A really sweet stop if you have kids or just love the character.

Afterwards, we crossed the bridge to get a close-up look at Big Ben, which is right across the river. From there, we made our way north to Trafalgar Square, but weren’t able to explore it fully because there was a protest happening, and police had cordoned off a lot of the area.

We grabbed lunch nearby and continued north into Chinatown, which is a great little stretch packed with restaurants, lanterns, and street energy. We stopped for amazing donuts at Donutelier and grabbed some unusual and fun treats at Mamasons Dirty Ice Cream.

We kept wandering with no fixed plan through Soho, which is a really fun shopping neighborhood. It’s packed with shops, big and small, and has that classic London mix of cool, grungy, and stylish. We browsed for a while, picked up a few things, and eventually ended our day just a little east at Outernet.

Outernet is a newer digital entertainment and shopping district near Tottenham Court Road. It's a mix of immersive LED screens, live music spaces, and creative experiences—feels a bit like London’s version of Times Square, but indoors. The massive floor-to-ceiling video displays are seriously impressive and the whole area has a futuristic vibe. Great place to cool off, take a break from walking, or just soak in a little bit of digital madness before heading home.

Day 5: Notting Hill + Chelsea Stadium  
Route: Metro to Notting Hill Gate → Metro to Fulham Broadway

We started the day in Notting Hill, one of London’s most picturesque neighborhoods. It’s famous for its colorful houses, leafy streets, and relaxed vibe. We wandered around the area, checking out the pastel homes and popping into a few shops and cafés. The main attraction is Portobello Road Market, a long street filled with vintage finds, antiques, local food stalls, and clothes. It gets busy, especially on weekends, but it’s a really fun area to stroll through with lots to see and plenty of snacks to grab along the way.

In the afternoon, we took the metro to Fulham Broadway for our Chelsea Stadium tour—perfect for our sports-loving family. Chelsea Football Club, founded in 1905, is one of England’s most successful and well-known clubs. They've won numerous titles including multiple Premier Leagues, FA Cups, and even the UEFA Champions League (most recently in 2021). The club’s home ground, Stamford Bridge, is located right in the heart of West London and has a rich history.

The stadium tour itself was awesome. You get to explore the stands, the press room, the home and away dressing rooms, the tunnel, and even walk pitchside. The guides shared a lot of fun stories and history about the club, and there’s a museum filled with trophies, memorabilia, and interactive displays. Whether you’re a Chelsea fan or just enjoy football, it’s a really cool experience—well organized, fun for kids, and definitely worth a stop if you’re into sports.

Day 6: Harry Potter Studios Tour  
Route: Southern Line (or sometimes West Midlands Trains or London Northwestern) → Watford Junction → Free shuttle to the studios

This was the big one for us in London—the main attraction. We're huge Harry Potter fans, so this was a must-see. One very important tip: book your tickets well in advance. I’m talking months ahead. We booked ours three months early and still only managed to get a 4 PM slot on a Wednesday, which threw off the rest of our day. We ended up spending most of the morning wandering around, taking it slow, playing in the park, and grabbing brunch. It was a nice break from all the running around, but still—not ideal. So again, book ahead.

The journey to the Warner Bros. Studios in Leavesden (north of London) takes a bit of planning. Depending on where you're staying, you’ll either need the Overground, West Midlands Trains, or London Northwestern Railway to get to Watford Junction. From there, a free themed Harry Potter shuttle bus takes you to the studio in about 15 minutes. Our ride from London took about 40 minutes by train, and the whole connection went pretty smoothly.

The tour itself was amazing. It’s a self-guided walk through the actual sets, props, and costumes used in the films. You start with a short intro video, then enter the Great Hall—it really feels like stepping into Hogwarts. After that, you move through all sorts of sets and spaces: the Gryffindor common room, Dumbledore’s office, the Potions classroom, the Burrow, Hagrid’s hut, the Forbidden Forest, Diagon Alley, and more. There are tons of interactive elements too, like flying a broom on a green screen, trying Butterbeer, or walking through the Hogwarts Express.

The scale and detail are incredible. It’s designed so fans of any age can enjoy it—there’s enough to keep both kids and adults engaged. The tour can take anywhere from 3 to 5 hours depending on your pace.

And of course, there’s the gift shop at the end, which is massive. From wands to robes to chocolate frogs, they have it all. Prices are high, but the selection is huge, and if you’re into Harry Potter, it’s pretty hard to leave empty-handed.

We loved every second of it—it was hands down one of the best experiences we've ever had as a family. Whether you're a casual fan or full-on obsessed, it's an absolute must-see. As far as exhibits or studio tours go, nothing else we’ve done even comes close.

**Tips for Future Travelers**  
Book Ahead:  
Anything that requires a ticket—museums, attractions, —should be booked in advance. London is very busy year-round, and spots fill up fast.

Don’t Stick Only to Tourist Zones:  
The big sights are popular for a reason—they’re beautiful and worth seeing. But they’re also crowded and hectic. Visit them, but don’t make them your whole trip. Take time to live like a local: stroll through quieter neighborhoods, eat at corner cafés, and explore parks and markets off the beaten path.

Toilet Tip (Especially with Kids!):  
One thing to note—London doesn’t have a ton of public bathrooms, especially compared to some other big cities. You’ll usually need to rely on museums, restaurants, or larger train stations, so plan your breaks accordingly (especially with kids).

Free Water Everywhere:  
One thing to note—there aren’t many public water fountains in London, so it’s a good idea to bring a reusable bottle and fill it up whenever you get the chance, like at museums, cafés, or your accommodation. Especially important if you’re out all day with kids. Some supermarkets (like Tesco or Sainsbury’s) also often have water refill points or self-checkout areas with sinks. Good trick when you’re in a bind.

Multi-city flying:  
Our original plan was to stay only in Paris and France, so we booked flights in and out of Paris. We added London to the trip later and would have preferred to fly out of London if that had been possible.

Tired but restless. Lonely but full of love. Idealistic but a little bruised from trying too hard in a world that often doesn’t meet you halfway. Because me too

I'm 25, based in Italy, and quietly hoping this message reaches someone who knows that life’s not just about chasing milestones but about finding someone whose soul feels like a safe place. 

Someone who won’t just get me, but who’s also walking through life with open eyes and an even more open heart.

I volunteer when I can, because if I want the world to be softer, more just, more kind, I have to help make it that way. I believe in showing up, not just with words but with action. 

If you're indifferent to oppression or proudly neutral in the face of injustice, we won't click. I believe being kind doesn't mean being passive. I stand with Palestine, and if human rights aren’t a priority for you, we’re not meant for each other.

But this post isn’t just about politics. It’s about wanting to build something gentle and real with someone who's aware. 

Someone who knows that empathy is a muscle  one we grow by being present, listening deeply, and not turning away when things get hard.

About me:

- 6ft, slim build, dark eyes & darker humor (when sleep-deprived)

- Emotionally literate, sometimes overly so. I feel a lot. But I also care a lot.

- Deep thinker. Coffee lover on slow mornings. Volunteering makes me feel less helpless.

- I crave intimacy in the little things like shared playlists, lazy dinners, voice notes that go “so I was just thinking...”

Currently working and studying. Life is chaotic, but there’s beauty in the mess they say.


About you (maybe):

You believe love isn’t found in grand gestures but in consistency. Maybe you cry at movies and care about more than just your own world. You like vulnerable conversations, even the ones with no neat endings. You are thoughtful, curious, and want to grow with someone, not just date them.

Bonus if:

- You find bookstores romantic

- You speak your mind, but always with heart

- You hate bigots and refuse to normalize cruelty

- You love those quiet, late-night “what even is happiness?” kind of talks


What I want:

Not perfection. Just someone sincere. A person I can be soft with who’ll meet me in the middle of all this trying. Maybe we find comfort in each other’s chaos. Maybe we just keep each other company in this strange, beautiful journey of figuring life out.

This week I was writing a simple recursive function. Thought I’d nailed it — elegant, concise, full of handcrafted developer pride.

Out of curiosity (okay, ego), I asked Blackbox AI to write the same function.

Guess what?
* Same logic.
* Fewer lines.
* Better variable names.
* Edge case handling I didn’t even consider.
* And the kicker: it had a clearer comment block than mine.

At first I was like, “Alright, AI, chill.” But honestly? Respect.

This isn’t me giving up control — it’s me admitting I don’t have to reinvent the wheel every time.

Now I use Blackbox like I use Stack Overflow:
* Not always right.
* Sometimes weird.
* But when it is right, it saves hours of my life.

Fellow devs:
* Be honest — has AI ever “out-coded” you?
* Do you refactor AI’s output out of pride, or leave it because… well, it just works?
* Anyone else catch themselves learning from its suggestions?

Coding isn’t a competition. But when the AI starts writing cleaner code than me before I finish my coffee… it’s hard not to be humbled. 😅",1,1751289593.0,BlackboxAI_,1,1.0,False

I just graduated a while ago and started doing this as a part time gig for some extra money. So be me, doing your usual security stuff; watch out for sus looking people, making sure there isn't any disturbances to the public, all that. Now as I was standing there infront of the Costa Coffee, I see a group of 4 girls, just standing around and having conversations. I recall one of them just getting out of the Costa Coffee with something that looked like a cup of coffee or boost or something, and then, for some reason, they all start squealing...

The sounds they made were so loud that people around them were staring at them, some even startled. The girl with the drink in her hand screamed... like actually screamed; and dropped her drink. I looked over to where they were all facing, and they were looking upstairs to the upper floor, towards this guy. Now, me being a good security guy, decided to go towards them and check up on them, making sure they were safe.

But by the time I saw the drink drop and called in for some cleaners to come clean it, I look back at them to see they were gone; just vanished. I think I saw them getting on the escalator to go to the upper floor towards the guy; but who knows??? 

Apparently some of the customers around them thought extremely negative about this, going as far as to complain to our manager about the nuisance these kids were causing for the families that were there to enjoy their day. I was called in by Yusuff Ali himself for a scolding later that day; as I heard in the walkie. 

  
While I was walking towards his room (it's hidden in the mall itself; people don't know about it, only staff knows of his secret room), I quickly had to go to the washroom. I ran to the washroom there, but someone was already in there. I thought it would take me more time to run to the other side of the mall to go to the washroom and come back and then make it to Ali sir's room so I thought i'll just wait for the person in the washroom to get out. 5 minutes... 10 minutes... 20 minutes... this person, whoever it was, took FOREVER to get out. I saw that I was late to meeting him; so I held it in and ran to his office. 

  
By the time I got there, he was super pissed at me, and proceeded to give me an absolute berating that took my eardrums off, and then fired me directly on the spot; for not maintaining the peace and quiet in the mall and enabling random teenagers to cause a scene and mess up the floor, and for being late.

In the planning of our trip, this board was a tremendous help.  So now, I will attempt to repay the favor with my reviews and ratings of the places we stayed, things we did and food we ate.  Thank you all!

  
ITALY 3 WEEK TRIP REPORT

We flew into Rome on the Wednesday before Easter, and spent a week there.  Took the train up to Chiusi where we rented a car and went on to Cortona for another week.  Day tripped to Sienna, Montepulciano and Montalcino while there.  Took a cooking class.  Then train on to Florence for 5 days.  Finally, train to Venice for 3 days before heading home.  Here are my quick thoughts on lodging, restaurants and attractions that we visited.  All rankings out of 10.



ROME

Hotel

**Antica Dimora delle Cinque Lune** \- 6.5 - Great location, clean but dark and cramped room.  3rd floor room overlooked the street and was noisy in the evening.  Didnt spend much time there, so it was fine.



Attractions

**The Colosseum** \- 10 - Amazing!  Just awestruck that this is still standing.  The scale and design are incredible.  Only downside was we paid for a tour of the entire site including the underground, but were denied entry to the underground because JD Vance and family were supposedly there.

**The Vatican** \- 8 - Just so much to see.  So much art, it was fatiguing.  4 hour tour on Good Friday was a lot.  Crowds were terrible.  But we knew that going in.  Hot take? Sistine Chapel as an experience was just meh.  Wouldnt make my top ten of things we saw.  St Peter’s?  They didnt know when to stop.  Too much.

**Borghese Gallery** \- 8 - Wonderful sculptures, audio tour was perfect.

**The Pantheon** \- 9 - Scale, design and age are all awe inspiring.  A quick tour, 20 minutes was perfect.

**The city overall** \- 8 - wonderful despite crowds.  Wandering around, visiting incredibly ornate churches was amazing.



Restaurants

**La Matricianella** \- 7 - Old skool italian, intimidating wine list.  Got a tour of the impressive cellar.  Food was solid, nothing spectacular.  Grappa to close the evening was fantastic but probably a mistake. 😂

**Seu Pizza Illuminati** \- 6.5 - Top 50 pizza place in the world.  Too experimental for me.  Crust was great, but overall flavor combinations were not there.

**Ristorante Pinseria Da Massi** \- 8 - Neighborhood spot with friendly service.  Lots of families and older couples.  Food was very good.  I tried the Ossobuco alla Romana, which I’d never had before and was delicious!

**Gregory’s Jazz Club** \- 9 - rating for vibe, setting and music.  Food was nothing special.

**Vitti Osteria & Cantina** \- 4 - Bad food. No other way to put it.  Just bad. If I didnt know I was in Rome, I would’ve believed the food came directly off the Sysco delivery truck.  I trusted reviews on The Fork for this one.  Never again.

**Osteria del Sostegno** \- 10 - Tucked away down an alley.  Looking for simple lunch, we grabbed an outside table in the alleyway.  We split a salad and cacio e pepe.  OMG, they were both amazing.  House white was perfect.  Tried to go back for dinner, but they weren’t open our last night in Rome.  Best C&P I had the entire trip. Still dream about that pasta.

**Antico Forno Roscioli** \- 10 - Tiny place, just get in line with the crowd.  But thankfully it moved fast.  When we got up front we were unsure how to order, as pizzas were whole and they we just hacking off chunks,  So we pointed and made hand gestures to indicate how much. And it worked just fine.   Asked for a birra ala spina and left the glass on the shelf out front. Stood just outside eating amazing pizza.  Love that crust!

**All'Antico Vinaio**  \-  10 -  Yes, overhyped and crowded.  But honestly this was another very fast line and the sandwich lived up the hype.  Il’ Paradiso sandwich with mortadella, straciatella and pistachio cream.  Let me tell you, that pistachio cream is no joke.  Could’ve ate this for lunch every day we were in Rome.

**Pinsitaly Trevi** \-  8 - Casual lunch spot, great sandwiches.

  


CORTONA

Lodging

**Cortona Skyline Retreat** [https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/cortona-skyline-retreat.html#tab-main](https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/cortona-skyline-retreat.html#tab-main) \- 9 - Clean, modern and roomy.  Was a perfect base for our stay in Tuscany.  Allesandro and Federico were terrific hosts.  Beds were comfy and the terrace was great for sunsets and happy hours.



Attractions

**Argiano Winery** \- 10 - Amazing wines, a fantastic tour and tasting.  Wines arent cheap but definitely best we had.

**Poggio Sorbello winery** \- 10 - We had a tour, tasting and lunch at their gazebo.  Wonderful friendly staff, great wines, and tasty food.  

**De’Ricci winery** \- 8  - Tour was fun, though a bit campy.  You could tell our guide had delivered these lines hundreds of times before.  Wine tasting was surprisingly good.  Very enjoyable.

**La Braccesca** \- 7 - Beautifully designed, large tasting room.  Pretty good wines.  Overpriced tour and tasting.  And the only place we went to that didnt comp the tasting fee with our wine purchase.

**Montepulciano, Montalcino, Sienna day trips** \- 9 - Each town was unique, and we had a great time at each location.  Definitely worth the drive.

**Cortona** \- 10 - Just a delightful little town, though everywhere you walked seemed uphill!  Wonderful little sidewalk cafes for happy hour.  Didn’t seem crowded with tourists.  And the group of old men who sit on the church steps every evening at the same time, watching and commenting on the passersby were hilarious to watch.



Restaurants

**Trattoria Dardano** \- 8.5 - Charming little restaurant.

**Sartu** \- 9 - Innovative and delightful cuisine. The gentlemen who serviced all tables was so attentive and helpful.

**La Bucaccia Da Romano** \- 9 - Everything was amazing.  Great wine by the glass.  Lovely setting.

**Ristorante La Loggetta** \- 10 - Our best meal of our stay in Cortona.  Everything was delicious.  And again, a fabulous grappa to close the evening.

**Osteria del Teatro** \- 10 - Stopped here for a lunch after we hiked to the Convent de Celle.  Lasagna special was incredible.  And outdoor seating was just perfect.

**Osteria Del Conte Montepulciano** \- 10 - Stopped here for lunch after exploring Montepulciano.  Just a delightful spot.  Swordfish carpaccio was a big hit.  But everything we had was wonderful  Mixed seafood special was great.

**Tigella Emilia** \- 9 - Casual spot on one of the many side streets in Siena.  Husband and wife team. She makes the pasta every morning, he’s out front. Not much for ambience, but we had a delicious, simple lunch here.



FLORENCE

Lodging

**B&B Florence Cathedral -** 6 - The smallest and most cramped of all the places we stayed.   Only place I regretted booking.  We’ve stayed in many tiny rooms that were designed well, with spaces for your luggage, where things make sense and daily living can still be comfortable.  That wasnt here.  But, big marks for location.  Just a couple blocks off the Piazza del Duomo.  While the room was bad, the overall experience was amazing.  Stayed close to Central Florence all week.  Just wandered to breakfast spots, sidewalk trattorias for lunch and the best was happy hour around the piazza.  Yes packed with tourists.  But you’re sitting at an outdoor table with amazing weather, maybe a sweater to throw on as the sun goes down, drinking wine or an aperol spritz, and enjoying the view, and the street life discussing the day and dinner plans.  I mean, nothing better.  Loved our little coffee shop just across the street, and the woman who opened in the morning.  She quickly got used to the site of me as she opened the roller door to her cafe, and would just nod in recognition of my usual order, as a sign that I could continue my walk and stop back to pick up the hot coffees and an almond croissant.  She seemed genuinely disappointed when I told her of our departure on our last morning.



Attractions

**Santa Maria del Fiore** \- 8 - We did a 30 minute skip the line express tour and it was great.  We got the highlights and were able to spend some time on our own exploring the church.  Scale was impressive.

**Secret Food Tour** \- 10 - We enjoyed this morning tour a lot.  The guide was friendly and knowledgeable, and the food samples we tried were great.  I’m a new fan of the lampredotto!

**Galleria dell’Accademia di Firenze and Michaelangelo’s David** \- 10 - Probably my favorite of all the museums/galleries we saw in Italy.  David and it’s placement in the galleria is simply perfect.  We spent a good amount of time here, despite the crowds.

**Uffizi Gallery** \- 8 - Researching guided tours for this site, I discovered Rick Steves downloadable audio tours.  And it was perfect for this location.  It helped us move through the crowds to see the best sites.  The tour was easy to follow and the pace was perfect.  I appreciated the variety of art here.

**Ponte Vecchio** \- 5 - Ugh.  I guess you have to see it, but the crowds were oppressive.

**Boboli Gardens** \- 9 - Great break from the crowds.  Beautiful gardens 



Restaurants

**Cibreo Cafe** \- 8 - Fascinating people watching!  Seems to be very popular among the young studying abroad crowd obliviously spending daddy’s money.  Food was good, but nothing special.  Service was poor.

**Cantinetta Antinori** \- 9 - Fantastic food, wonderful wine list.  Started with a flight of Tuscan whites, all were great.  Ossobucco was outstanding.  Only disappointment was service was very cold.

**Gusta Pizza** \- 10 - I know Florence is not the place for neapolitan pizza.  But it was what we wanted and Gusta did not disappoint.  Just delicious.

**Coquinarius** \- 9 - A charming little bistro with great food.  The swordfish carpaccio and the cheese and pear ravioli were standouts.

  


VENICE

Lodging

**Residenza San Marco “La Padrona”** \- 8 - Very nice room in a great location.  Only downside was the AC.  It was pretty warm in Venice and the AC wasnt working well.  They brought in a repairman the first day we were there, and supposedly fixed it.  But it still barely made a dent in the heat.  Fortunately, our neighborhood was quiet and it was cool enough with the windows open.



Attractions

**Gondola Tour** \- 4 - Literally every thing I read and everyone I talked to, advised us not to bother with a gondola tour.  Expensive, crowded and unimpressive was the word.  Well, they were right.  The wife wanted this and she usually gets what she wants.  So booked a 30 minute semi-private gondola with a serenade. Ride was only 21 minutes long. The gondolier was on his cell phone the entire time and was perturbed when we asked questions. So we had no idea what we saw or where we were.  We were supposed to receive a “romantic serenade” on our ride. But the accordionist/singer was on another boat. And we were told last minute that the boats would be side by side, so that we could enjoy the music. Most of the time the boat with the music trailed well behind, often by 20 or 30 yards. We couldn’t hear the music and the experience was definitely not romantic. Very disappointing.

**St Marks and Doge’s Palace** \- 8 - Doge’s Palace was our favorite.  The rooms and paintings were really gorgeous.  The prison and Bridge of Sighs were fascinating.  We were on our own, no audio guide.  But we had no trouble following the signage and understanding what we were seeing.  St Mark’s was impressive, but we preferred Doge.  

**Murano & Burano Day Trip** \- 9 - Maybe our favorite thing we did in Venice.  It was a cool and overcast day but we really enjoyed our entire experience.  We went to a glass blowing demonstration in Murano that was really fascinating, and despite warnings, we were never hounded to buy glass.  We did but a couple of small things to take home.  When we got to Burano, the clouds cleared and the colorful buildings were quite beautiful.  



Restaurants

**Antico Dolo** \- 9 - Charming little place.  We were welcomed by the friendly third generation owner and enjoyed our dinner immensely.  The grilled calamari with parsley sauce and the tiramisu ala minute were stars.

**Ostaria Boccadoro** \- 10 - Another charming little bistro.  We made it here despite the long walk from our apartment in the middle of a rainstorm, and were glad we did.  Service was friendly and helpful.  Me having order fatigue, we put ourselves in the hands of our waiter and he didnt steer us wrong.  A grilled seafood appetizer and crab salad were outstanding.  Then we split the pasta special that was just as good.  A grappa and a chocolate mousse were the perfect ending.  The rains had stopped and we had a very pleasant walk back.  Highly recommend.

**El Magazen** \- 10 - on our second day in Venice we stumbled across a little restaurant and stopped for lunch.  The food, the wine, the setting, the service were all spectacular.  Probably our best meal of the entire trip.  A true mom and pop operation with the husband a frenchman out front and his wife, of Indian descent, in the kitchen.  The melding of the cuisines and flavors was magical.  And the wine by the glass available, all recommended by the husband were outstanding.  My spaghetti in chili and garlic oil with breadcrumbs and marinated mackerel was unlike any pasta I have had before.  My wife had the sea bass, and it was fantastic too.  Before we left lunch, we made a reservation for the next night.

I had a freelance project due the next morning. A payment gateway integration in PHP (yes, PHP 😭) started throwing errors right before deployment. The docs were vague. Stack Overflow had conflicting answers. I was out of brainpower.

A few very ""apparent"" mistakes especially in a medical job, overshadow everything else you put your heart into successfully. It won't get recognized.
So now I got fired from my part time job at the dialysis center because last week I arrived 4 hours late as I was oblivious about me having to work - I looked at the shift plan of the wrong month and I had no excuse, I just admitted that I was in the lib studying and checked the wrong plan... I also once forgot to close the clip on a needle and you can guess how that went. My authority-signed checklist for acquired skills necessary for bureaucracy had coffee stains and creases. They were in disbelief. No boss cares about how fast and well you did everything else with stuff like that. Not how much the patients liked you and some even preferred to be taken care of by you instead of the others, telling me they missed me when I wasn't on duty. 

I'm without money, gotta get further into debt as I'm standing just before the German equivalent of the USMLE. No financial help from family as they are struggling month to month themselves.

I don't know how to explain it to the other med students who worked there. How to tell my family and friends. I feel ashamed. My childhood and teenage bullies voices in my head fight for my audience again. It's hard to keep the confidence I tried to build with so much pain and effort. I can tell I did a good job, but I still feel the heaviness, the shame and feelings of inadequacy creep back in way more strongly again.

This year, Charis is proud to mark its 15th anniversary of providing vital support to individuals and families affected by cancer.

To celebrate this milestone and look to the future, we’re delighted to have charity ambassador, Jenny Bristow BEM help them launch their ‘Comfort in a Cup’ fundraising campaign – and they’re inviting local communities to join them in making a difference.

The charity’s goal is to raise £100,000 to continue offering comfort, care and hope to those who need it most.

Nestled on the banks of Lough Fea, Charis Cancer Care is a beacon of hope, dedicated to supporting the emotional, psychological and physical wellbeing of people affected by cancer.

Last year, the charity supported over 1,000 clients with almost half of these people coming from the [Mid Ulster](https://www.northernirelandworld.com/topic/mid-ulster) area. They offered 6,278 sessions of counselling, complementary treatments, nutritional advice, financial guidance and a listening ear – because they believe everyone deserves compassion and understanding.

Speaking about her involvement with the campaign, Jenny Bristow said: “I’m delighted to be supporting Charis Cancer Care’s Comfort in a Cup campaign and encourage everyone to get together with friends, family or work colleagues, host an afternoon tea party or coffee morning and raise vital funds so Charis can continue to support people affected by cancer across Northern Ireland.”

At Charis, a simple cup of tea isn’t just a beverage – it’s a symbol of comfort and connection as the charity’s Income generation manager, Arlene McEvoy said: “There’s something truly special about sharing a cuppa. It’s a small act that can bring warmth and reassurance to someone facing tough times. Every year, we serve around 20,000 cups of tea or coffee, creating moments of calm and community. However, to keep this going, we need your help.”

By hosting a ‘Comfort in a Cup’ coffee morning or afternoon tea, the public can help Charis raise vital funds to continue their work.

Getting involved is easy. Simply visit the website at [https://chariscancercare.org/comfort-in-](https://chariscancercare.org/comfort-in-) a-cup/ to register your event and download a fundraising pack.

No one’s perfect (he’s not, I’m not) but something about him is that if I want something and he can do it he will. If he has enough money to buy it (or sometimes if he doesn’t quite) he will. I like having a boyfriend who loves me so much that he would spend his money on me. What’s important here is that he WOULD not that he does, as I don’t let him. And if he couldn’t pay that would be different. He paid for our first date. 

I like dating a guy who would do it, and because I love him I obviously don’t want him to do it. I don’t let him, but the fact that he wants to is attractive. I’ve refunded him, paid him back, snuck money in his pocket and had him return things that I thought were too expensive. But I won’t lie that my type is definitely the kind of guy who’s willing to, over the kind of guy who wouldn’t. So if a guy is admittedly suggesting splitting on a first date I would pay my half and probably lose his number. The kind of guy that’s supposedly interested in me, but doesn’t even want to buy me a coffee ( key word want to, not that he needs to) just isn’t my preference. I’m sure everyone’s preferences are different though. I’m bisexual and on a first date I wanted to buy a girl her drink. The next date was a boba date and she bought us boba because she genuinely wanted to get me something. If I like someone I want to get them things. Also I think if either person is too broke to cover the tab of a reasonable priced first date they shouldn’t be focused on dating.

Okay so here’s the tea.

I (33F) had two friends, let’s call them B1 and B2. We were what you’d call the work besties. One team, everyday chika, trauma-bonding, support system - you name it. We were even godparents to our friend’s baby, so yeah, we were close-close.

But then I resigned. And suddenly, I guess my subscription to their friendship expired.

At first, I understood. Life gets busy. But the seen zones became more frequent. Conversations became dry. I still showed up; emotionally, virtually, even when they barely responded.

Our birthdays are all in the same month. We planned a Cebu trip (2023) before I resigned, and still pushed through. Everything seemed fine. But surprise! On my birthday, crickets. No message. No greeting. Nada.

I kept it classy and didn’t bring it up to avoid awkward vibes. Then B1’s birthday came, B2 posted her on stories. I do the same. Same thing with B2. They hyped each other up and I still made the effort… kahit pa medyo nasasaktan na ako.

Then post-trip, they kept hanging out. Coffee here, dinner there. Just the two of them. No invite. Not even a heads-up. I stopped initiating conversations, but I still replied when they did. Until they just… didn’t anymore.

Fast forward to last year. Another birthday month came, again, I was invisible. No “HBD.” Nothing. Then I found out B2 threw a party in BGC and mutuals were asking me if I was going. Sis, I wasn’t even told about it.

That was my cue to exit stage left, gracefully. I stopped reaching out. They didn’t seem to notice or care.

So yeah. I’m still sitting with the question: Did I walk away, or did they just quietly leave me behind the moment I stopped being useful or convenient?

I own a Niche Zero, V60, Chemex 3cup and an E61 espresso machine.

For espresso I really love the Niche, but my pour over really is not good. The filter always clogs up after a minute or two and water takes forever to completely run through. I wondered about it and learnt that the Niche produces a lot of fines, which means it is not great for pour over.

So now I think about adding a grinder exclusively for filter coffees to my equipment. I really don't care if it is electrically powered or manual and the price of the Pietro (350€) is the absolute upper limit.

I know that the Commandante can do both, espresso and pour over while the other two are specific for pour over, so I would assume that they produce somewhat better tasting filter coffees.

I appreciate the swivel base that allows a full 360-degree rotation because it made handling so effortless during chaotic mornings when every minute counts. Though the design shines, fingerprints can be a minor nuisance, requiring frequent wiping to maintain its polished appearance.  

**Performance and Heating Speed**  
This kettle doesn’t just sit pretty; it gets things done. Its double-wall insulation is one of my favorite aspects, and during real-world use, it retained heat remarkably well. The water stayed piping hot much longer than what I was accustomed to with standard single-wall kettles. Heating speed is efficient, shaving significant time off morning chores. However, I wouldn’t call it the quickest kettle I’ve used, losing narrowly to my friend’s ultra-modern model with advanced heat technology.  

**Advantages**  
- Sleek, modern design complements most kitchen aesthetics.  
- Heat-retaining double-wall construction ensures long-term use and energy efficiency.   
- Swivel base for convenient handling from any angle.

**Safety Features**  
Safety is clearly a priority with this kettle. I tested the dry boil protection by trying to operate it without enough water, and it turned off promptly, avoiding potential hazards. Similarly, the non-drip spout makes serving hot liquids mess-free and reduces the risk of spills—a blessing when there are kids or pets scuttling around. The smooth-opening lid was another understated yet handy feature, preventing splashes and burns while adding to the user-friendly experience.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Fingerprints and smudges on the steel surface require regular cleaning.  
- It is slightly heavier compared to plastic counterparts, which might not suit everyone.  

**Target Audience**  
This kettle isn’t bulky, making it ideal for apartments, single households, or small kitchens where space is at a premium. The upscale design suggests that it’s meant for a customer searching for elegance and efficiency in one package without resorting to an overwhelming size or unnecessary complexity. Casual tea drinkers or coffee lovers tired of waiting endlessly for their water to heat will find this product particularly satisfying.  

**Challengers**  
Compared to big players like the Breville or Cuisinart electric kettles, Aarke’s model offers enviable energy savings, doubling down on its environmental credibility. Nevertheless, Breville might edge ahead with features like customizable temperature settings that are absent in the Aarke. On the other hand, the Aarke kettle’s whisper-quiet operation is leagues ahead of noisier models, winning favor during early morning or late-night use. For those focused solely on luxury, brands like Alessi offer extraordinary designs, but they tend to sacrifice functional features that the Aarke doesn’t overlook.  

**Value Proposition**  
Coming down to cost efficiency, this kettle finds a sweet spot. It feels like a premium product without being astronomically priced, justifying what you’re paying with its durable construction and safety features. Balancing affordability with high performance is tricky, but the Aarke model handles this artfully. Would I say it’s an inexpensive kettle? No, but the experience it offers makes it worth considering.

1lo6jkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskParents/comments/1lo6jkr/nephew_is_staying_with_me_for_several_weeks_but/,Nephew is staying with me for several weeks but alreasy damaged stuff. How should I handle the situation going forward?,"My 12 year old nephew is visiting for the first time and staying for 5 weeks. There are 4 more weeks to go and I'm struggling. There was an incident today I don't know if I overreacted or not. I don't have children so please be kind.

Due to distance I visit their household once a year but I wasn't aware he needs a lot more help than expected. There are too many issues to list but I understand he comes from a different household, did not have a great start in life, and was bullied at school for hygiene issues. He is careless about property, has extensive food adversions, lacks basic hygiene and can't admit to problems. We have been communicating each other's boundaries, and I try to mentor and give different perspectives.

Today I noticed the paint on one of his toy cars rubbed off onto my brand new coffee table. I've repeatedly told him to be careful with my property. He knew the paint on this toy rubs off but now says ""it wasn't rubbing off anymore so I thought it was ok"" (truth or not, I dont know. He tends to find the most convenient reasons his kid brain can come up with). I could not get the markings off. 

Nephew wanted to try fix the marking but I was seeing red. I said "" I know you didn't do it on purpose but I am so upset I can't talk to you anymore today. Just finish your milk and get ready for bed yourself. I don't want to see that toy in my sight again. "" I explained the table was bought the day before his visit because he is staying in the living room and I wanted him to be comfortable in there. This was a table I've been eyeing since last year. Yes call me naive for thinking a kid could treat a new table well. I wasn't yelling but this was clearly the most really upset he has ever seen me.

I've told his mom but she basically just said he must face the consequences, but didn't offer anything. There is no way she will offer or have money to pay for my table because she still owes me money.

I've asked the furniture company for their advice and will try cleaning it again, but my table is likely permanently marked. If I just let this go will it make me seem too weak? What else can I do to appropriately communicate this? It is not just about the table but his behaviours/ our relationship. Advice appreciated. 

(Nephew has also caused both toilets to malfunction and blocked the bathroom drain, but admittedly plumbings are old so I just let it go. He also broke a cup from throwing it around but he is treating the next cup with care. It seems he is one of those kids who must damage something before he understands).

[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/14485862/1/Himiko-Toga-everywhere](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/14485862/1/Himiko-Toga-everywhere)

Himiko Toga wanted two thing in life: cute boys and bloody fights. The red liquid tasted the best when it was boiling from adrenaline. Her parents were rich snobs who despised the sight of blood and the fighting of any kind. They wouldn’t even let her apply for tae kwon do lessons. At some point, the girl decided this life is not worth living and ran away from her. Whatever, her younger sister could do all the rich people things their mom and dad want so much.

Himiko has been living her best life as street fighter. She would battle people and drink their blood afterwards. Of course, sometimes the opposition was a little too strong, so she had to run away. One day, little vampire found this cute boy Midoriya, and she wanted to suck him dry, but he is too weak to fight properly. Sloppy movements, no sense of balance, noddle arms. He fell down like a puppet without strings after she did 4-5 measly punches on him. The boy was now lying in the puddle of his blood and tears.

No problem, Himiko could train him, whether he liked it or not. She pulled out a first aid kit from her backpack and helped treat his wounds. After that, they sat down and ate sandwiched at a bench.

""Why? Why did you hurt me?"" Midoriya asked. ""Is this because I’m weak?""

""No, silly."" Toga giggled. ""It’s because you are cute. But yeah, you are weak as hell. We’ll have to change that.""

""Kacchan will be mad if I start training.""

""I don’t know who Kacchan is, but I will be mad if you don’t. And trust, you DO NOT want to see me mad."" Himiko pulled out a knife and inspected it.

Izuku gulped as he awaited her next words.

""I think the best way to train someone is practical experience. I’m going to periodically attack you, and you will do your best to fight back. I’ll go easy first, but every subsequent encounter will be harder and harder. This way, we will have the best kind of fight in the end!""

""N-no."" He weakly replied. ""I don’t want to fight you.""

""HA HA HA!"" Himiko laughed as he grabbed his face with one hand and put the knife near his throat with another. ""You don’t want to fight me? Then you better get to the gym and beat me a bloody pulp! Because I’m not leaving you alone until..."" She sniffed the air. ""Damn it, did you pee yourself?""

Toga had to give him her spare underwear and jeans to not embarrass him further. Izuku didn’t know what was more humiliating: being beaten by a girl or wearing pink panties. In any case, she told him he needs to train. His first thought was going to police, but none of them took him seriously. Was it because female on male violence isn’t treated with respect?

—

Izuku’s life had been turned upside down ever since he met that crazy girl. Midoriya had no choice but to ask his mom for a dojo membership. A nice girl with red ponytail taught him karate. He also had to lift, do cardio and other types of exercises to stay in top shape. Every few days she could appear from anywhere: raise her head from a trash can or a man hole, jump at him from the second floor, get involved in a fight with Kacchan, come out of an elevator when he was walking past it, hand him over new toilet paper in a public restroom etc. Sometimes she was fighting with bare hands, but other times she used baseball bats or knives. Luckily, Kacchan would always help him beat her whenever he nearby, as he found her a ’creepy freak’. Same with Kendou girl, although she felt very sympathetic to Izuku’s peril. Toga would always run away after confirming Izuku was making progress.

Even when Himiko was caught by police (heroes were useless cause she wasn’t using her quirk), she returned after a week tops. When asked how, she joked about cleaning up their guns. The girl is totally jobbing for the first month, but ever so slightly less afterwards, which forces Midoriya to train and learn martial arts, and add techniques that deal with knife wielders.

—

At some point, Toga started to incorporate her quirk to catch Izuku-chan even he least expected it. The first time was a female classmate he was crushing on. She asked him to meet her in the empty classroom, asked him to close his eyes and move lips forward. Instead of a kiss, she immediately punched him in the gut and dropped her disguise. He had to fight with emotional damage and embarrassment as she was completely naked!

It kept going! So far she’s been a waiter at a restaurant, taxi driver, his favorite idol (he should have known a private concert would be a scam), his friend Kacchan (Izuku couldn’t see the difference as she was disguised the entire time), karate instructor Itsuka Kendou, his mother Inko and many more. He managed to figure out that she needs blood to use her quirk, which partially explained her fascination.

All the fights made him beefier and more confident. He could finally confront Kacchan whenever he tried bullying him or other kids. This made other Aldera students respect him a lot more, although he wished the rumors about him ’dating’ that crazy chick weren’t so widespread.

—

During Izuku’s birthday, Himiko came to his home with a rare All Might statue. She said she understands that the boy needs a bit of downtime and reassurance every once in a while, so they could make a truce for weekends or holidays. Considering Midoriya wasn’t very good in friends department, this was perhaps as good as it could get. Toga even stayed when Kendou of all people arrived with a coffee machine.

Izuku was unsure how to feel. On one hand, Himiko made him a total paranoic and she tried to kill him, but on the other hand, she was perhaps his best friend all along. The little vampire motivated him to work out and never lose his fighting spirit. She even procured the thing he wanted his birthday party, played bowling on Sundays and took care of him when he was sick. The green head even begged her to become a hero like him, but she didn’t like the idea. Heroes couldn’t fight whenever they wanted.

—

After a certain Sludge incident, Izuku caught attention of All Might and became his successor. The first few months of getting used to the power were pretty rough. Thankfully, Himiko saw that he was injured and didn’t prey on him. After a bit more focused training, the green head could safely use 20 percent of One For All. Himiko disappeared for months, which made him worried. Noone, not even the police could tell where she was. He could only hope she was okay.

—

Months has passed, Izuku got into UA and his class was going to USJ. The villains attacked! The leader seemed to be... Himiko? She ordered a weird mist man to scatter the students and distract the teachers. Izuku was hers to battle.

Midoriya ran to her as fast as he could, hoping to talk her out of this.

""Himiko, what’s the meaning of this?"" He asked. ""Who are these people?""

""You’re not going to ask how I’ve been doing?"" She sounded disappointed. ""FYI, I’ve joined the organization called League of Villains. Me and Handjob had some disagreements, so I killed him. Then I convinced his sensei to let me be his successor instead. These people are my little helpers?""

""What? Why?"" Izuku was still confused.

""I’ve always been good at hiding in plan sight. I knew that you somehow inherited All Might’s power. You hanged out with him and did a smash comparable to his. It was pretty obvious that I needed a power-up to keep our rivalry in tact. I told sensei that I know how to approach future All Might. Sensei let me be his successor because I know you, and because I want you to bleed for me.""

""Toga, please, don’t do this. I’ll do anything, but you need to stop.""

""Anything?"" She had a wicked grin. ""Than fight me with all your heart!""

The girl rushed at Midoriya. He thought Toga would be outclassed now, but no. She had new quirks! Some kind of regeneration and shock absorption. It took Izuku going plus ultra and breaking his arms to overcome her and send her flying. While she was in the air, Himiko savored the taste of desperate Izu-kun blood.

All Might and Izuku were both shocked by that day’s revelation. Himiko, on the other hand, was more making further plans.

—

Fast forward to Hosu. Toga tried recruiting Mr Stainy, but he told her that mindless blood lust is despicable. They parted ways after she prevented all of his attacks and told him to leave while he was still breathing.

—

Izuku was running through narrow alleyways in hopes of finding Iida. He had to engage in a fight with Stain to save his friend. Everyone got surprised when Himiko walded in, caught one of the knives with her teeth, then grabbed it by the handle and assumed a fighting stance. Stain targeted her first as filthy adrenaline junkie, even paralyzing her in the process, but then Shouto’s backup made him lose to the heroes. Stain and Toga have been apprehended by police, but the girl spit out a weird gray goo and teleported them out. She really liked Mr Stainy’s fighting style, so he was going to appropriate it for herself.

—

Months later, Himiko disguised herself as one of Wolfram’s henchmen. Izuku couldn’t even tell that is was her! Just kicked her to the side as he and another girl hurried to lift the security lockdown. He was progressing so fast.

—

It was supposed to be a nice training session in Wild Wild Pussycats’ forest. Instead, he was running to save the kid who punched him in the balls. When the boy finally got to the Mountain, he saw Mandalay and her nephew running towards him. Except...

Shino Sousaki was just another disguise. Underneath it was Himiko is Mandalay cosplay. She told the boy to the hide so she could have another fight. Despite his pleads to let him get the child to safety, she was adamant about fighting. The first time she landed a bite, Izuku got paralyzed. He was hit by a familiar quirk. Toga stood over his motionless body, a sadistic grin on her face and the tail on her costume playfully moving around.

Kouta Izumi sprayed her with water from behind out of desperation. She turned around and moved towards the little guy.

""No! Don’t hurt him."" Izuku begged.

""You are in over your head, kid."" Himiko said to shaking Kouta. ""A different villain might have killed you for it. The blood curl quirk is so boring! Izu-kun, I’m going to wait until it wears off and then we fight for real. And you better not pretend to be paralyzed for long!""

Midoriya could move, so Toga unleashed Muscular quirk to look less like Mandalay and more like Tiger. This was a tough barrier to overcome, so the boy had to use 1 million percent OFA, shattering his arms and her skull yet again. He moved Kouta back to safety as Himiko had to crawl to extraction point.

—

LOV kidnapped Katsuki to covert him, at least on paper. In reality, Himiko wanted bait Izuku into coming to her lair. Her plans were a bit ruined when AFO and heroes intervened. Her sensei’s old body has been completely destroyed, and her base of operations was no more. On the plus side, she now had Explosion and Search to play with.

League had to make a temporary alliance with Overhaul. Toga decided to squeeze the yakuzas for all they are worth and have another excuse to fight her beloved. She tipped of Sir Nighteye about the whereabouts of the base and the little girl. On the day of the raid, she kidnapped Kai and made Dr Garaki give her a full copy of his quirk. Dressed as Plague Doctor, she made Izuku fight her in exchange for letting Eri go. The healing properties of Overhaul were incredibly potent, so Midoriya had to use Eri’s rewind to keep up. Eventually, he overpowered her and she had to teleport away. Kai’s quirkless but definitely alive body was found shortly afterwards.

—

Himiko and her team were ambushed in Deika City. Luckily, almost all of them were chumps who weren’t able to fight properly. That reporter lady was very insistent on blowing her up, so she had to eat knives for breakfast. It was a tough battle, but the League prevailed.

—

With AFO’s body gone, his minion Doctor Garaki used yakuza’s stolen funds and his vast medical knowledge to perform hos greatest feat. He would use genetic material left by All For One to insert his master’s mind and quirk into the little girl, as well as make the body on par with prime All Might. The idea was for All For One to take over the body, but Himiko wasn’t so simple. Her sheer willpower let her remain in control by attacking and defeating the villain’s vestige in her own mind.

Toga was the peak of humanity’s evolution! This meant she could finally have one final showdown with Izuku! She tied up Dr Garaki and told other League members that they are on their own from now on. Some of them complied, others tried to kill her (poor Dabi), and some begged her to not leave them. She ’cured’ Twice by removing the source of his paranoia, gave him and Spinner disguise quirks so they could leave Japan together. Or not, she wasn’t going to order them around. The girl practiced her quirks for a bit, then put on a nice business suit to cosplay as her late sensei.

—

Himiko appeared in front of UA with all of her power. She demanded one last fight with Izuku. In exchange, she promised to give heroes all the information about remnants of AFO’s influence. When Midoriya got close, she forcefully teleported them into a remote location. There, they could let loose and fight to their hearts’ content. The persuasions failed as usual. Given how strong and filled with quirks Himiko was, Izuku had no choice but to go for a clean hit with his full power.

Himiko had a gaping hole in her chest. Her mouth was filled with a combination of their hot blood. The taste was divine! This was what she always wanted to live for. The girl gave him a usb drive and promised that the world would follow Izuku’s wishes, as he was the best fighter ever...

—

Years later, Izuku was at the altar about to marry a girl he had met in Provisional License Exam. As soon as the bride was asked if she agreed to marriage, Himiko dropped her disguise and called her backup clones from cake, the officiant and some of the guests. Izuku kicked kicked their butts as a sign that he never got any weaker. Then he took the original girl and slipped the ring on her finger anyway. The ceremony concluded as Himiko and her naked clones were kissing Izuku all over his body.",2,1751286889.0,MyHeroAcadamia,0,1.0,False

They paid me.

No one ever tells you how surreal it is to get *paid* after your first brush with supernatural death. Like, yeah—your reality cracked open, a claw machine tried to seduce you, and a demon janitor knows your face now. But here's $118.42 (after taxes), direct deposit, memo line: **""Overnight Support - Hollow Pines""**

Thanks, I guess?

When I showed up for my second shift, the mall was just as lifeless and looming, but there was one change:  
**My booth had been upgraded.** New chair. A mini-fridge stocked with water and canned cold brew. Even the overhead bulb had been swapped out for a warm Edison-style one. For a second, I thought: *Maybe they appreciate me.*

Then I saw **Envelope #2** taped to the fridge.

It was thicker than the first. The paper was yellowed, water-damaged, and smelled faintly of burnt plastic.

# RULES FOR NIGHT SECURITY – HOLLOW PINES MALL

**(SECOND SHIFT – Extended Protocol Access Granted)**

**Failure to comply will result in... rediscovery.**

**1. Clock in using the punch-card labeled “Shift B.” Do not use “Shift C” unless specifically instructed. That card is not for humans.**

**2. Begin patrol as usual at 12:10 AM. However, you may now use the upper floor escalators, which are deemed “mostly stable.” Step lightly. If a step feels soft, skip it. Something below the mechanism is feeding.**

**3. At 12:33 AM, the Orange Julius sign will flicker. A woman missing her face will sit alone at a nearby table. DO NOT SPEAK TO HER. If she offers you a drink, respond with: “I’ve already had my fill.” Walk away slowly. If she stands, break into a sprint.**

**4. The Sunglass Hut mirror will function as a door between 1:00 and 1:04 AM. It only opens inward. DO NOT look inside unless absolutely necessary. If you hear crying from within, ignore it. The voice belongs to something eyeless and persuasive.**

**5. The mannequins in the shuttered Macy’s will rotate 13 degrees every time you blink near them. Keep track. If one begins to sweat, leave immediately. If two begin to sweat, start reciting anything you remember from high school math. It confuses them.**

**6. At 2:22 AM, a group of elderly mall walkers will shuffle through the corridor near the bath shop. Do not impede their path. Do not offer assistance. They are not ghosts. They are** ***leftovers*****. If one asks where their families are, respond, “Still shopping.” Repeat until they vanish.**

**7. From 3:00 to 3:15 AM, the temperature will plummet. You will smell gasoline. This is the Burning Hour. Go to the security booth. Lock the door. DO NOT LOOK OUTSIDE. Do not answer any knocks unless they are in a pattern of 3-2-3. Even then… consider ignoring it.**

**8. If you hear mall music stop suddenly, it means something is listening. Stop moving. Count backward from 23. If the music resumes on “13,” you’ve been marked. Finish your shift without blinking near electronics. You may find faces in your devices if you fail.**

**9. At 4:44 AM, a hatch near the service elevator will groan. That is the sealed entrance to Basement 1. It is currently restricted. If you hear scratching from beneath it, do not respond. Do not speak its name—especially if you don’t know what it is.**

**10. At 5:11 AM, the intercom will announce your name. This is not the mall’s system. Cover your ears and hum “Bohemian Rhapsody” until the lights flicker blue. Do NOT respond. Do NOT answer it back. Your real name is a key. They want it.**

**11. At exactly 6:01 AM, you will hear a second tone. This means the shift has formally ended and the mall has gone dormant. If you hear the tone before 6:01, leave immediately and do not return for three nights. That is not your exit signal.**

I followed the rules.

Almost all of them.

At 4:44 AM, I was finishing a cold brew when I heard the metal groan.

Not a knock. Not a scratch. A **groan**—like steel exhaling. I found myself drawn to it. The service corridor was darker than it should’ve been, lights barely alive, like they knew what was underneath.

The hatch was sealed with a thick iron lock... but there were **handprints** on the walls. Some human-sized. Some not.

One of them matched mine exactly. Even had the old burn scar from when I dropped my coffee maker last year.

I didn’t open it.

But I **knelt**, and I listened.

Something whispered from the other side, barely audible through the layers of rusted steel.

**“See you soon, Old Man.”**

I’m not sure why I’m going back tomorrow. The smart thing would be to run. But I’m tired of running from every job, every decision, every moment where fear tells me I’m not built for this.

They gave me a raise.

The booth now has **a radio** that only plays static unless I hold it upside-down.

I think that’s a gift.

Tomorrow night, I’m bringing bolt cutters.

I’m going into **Basement 1**.

And whatever’s waiting down there?

I feel weird around my chest after eating and I don't know why. It's not painful but it's uncomfortable because I know I shouldn't feel this way. I don't feel breathless. After drinking coffee and eating anything fried,I feel this way. And I have trouble swallowing and always get food stuck up to my nose.

Then, masturbating in bed at night. I was tense, tight, and constipated to the point where I was severely backed up, my pelvic floor perpetually tensed, and I'd even lost a real urge to poop. Tried fiber, pre- and prebiotics, laxatives,  smooth move teas. Only reel reliefs were big glasses of prune juice, raw garlic cloves, and magnesium citrate, but the diarrhea from those wasn't something I wanted to make a regular occurrence. Self-diangosed with all the hits, all the classics. IBS, SIBO, Gastritis, colon cancer, hemorrhoids, etc.

Coffee and tension/stress were the common denominators or precursors to most of these, so I figured let's stop drinking my morning coffee and the pre-workout in the afternoon; and also lay off the nightly gooning. 

And it worked, surprisingly fast. I was passing gas by the next day and regular bowel movements not long after. Feeling is back. No distension, I can completely empty myself. Now I have Ginger Tumeric tea in place of coffee, which produces a movement almost as efficiently, and I can go unassisted at the slightest urge any other time. Ashwagandha may have helped as well, in the de-stressing aspect

Hey folks!

Just a heads-up that I’m running a Warhammer 40K tournament on Friday 2nd August at my new shop, Red October Games in Newcastle – and it’d be awesome to get some local players involved.

It’s a 2000pt matched play event with 3 games across the day.
	•	Kick-off is at 9:00 AM
	•	Each round is 2.5 hours
	•	We’ll have a 1 hour lunch break
	•	Entry is £15, and you can grab tickets here: www.redoctobergames.com

The venue has food and drink available, so you won’t have to wander off between rounds to find a sandwich or a coffee.

Whether you’re a regular on the tournament scene or just fancy a fun day of rolling dice and meeting fellow hobbyists, come along! We’ve got proper terrain, good vibes, and a growing little community.

If you’ve got any questions, just drop a comment or shoot me a message. Hope to see a few of you there!",9,1751286798.0,NewcastleUponTyne,7,0.92,False

I’ll admit I drank too much liquor yesterday (had company over and we’re having a good time) which caused me to fall asleep super early (thankfully in my bed and didn’t do anything stupid yesterday like drunk driving). Woke up this morning not hungover surprisingly but very tired.

Am having my morning coffee to try and wake myself up when nostalgia hit me like a ton of bricks. I remembered how I was happy as a child. I remembered how I looked towards the future and it didn’t seem so downtrodden and scary. I remembered how I felt like my life actually mattered. I look at where I am today and I feel utterly worthless and genuinely scared of the future. It’s been well over a decade and a half since I felt true happiness. I don’t really feel like a person, more like a consistent burden to those around me and feel like if I’m not a mindless robot that just works and does nothing fun that I’m a failure.

We've been together for going on 5 years but we're at a place now where we're not sure how to move forward. 

There have been a few big fights over the years about the same things: finances, intimacy, and time spent together. I'll admit i dont have my shit in order with my finances but it feels like I cant catch up. He likes to go out for supper and do things on weekends that is hard for me to afford. But I feel guilty saying no because he's home working all the time and he wants to leave the house and spend time with me. But then this leads to him paying for more things and becoming resentful of me towards that. I'll admit I dont pay for a lot but I do try and treat him when I can. We've communicated about this but it feels like an endless circle. He's upset that he pays for most, I explain that I cant afford the lifestyle he wants us to live, he feels its because I waste my money (partly true but I also do have more bills than him). What I ""waste"" my money on is often food or coffee. 

In regards to intimacy this one has become really complicated for me. Ive never had a huge sex drive, he does. If we go so long without sex he will confront me about it. This only makes me feel a lot of pressure to have sex. Its come to the point that sometimes when he initiates I cant really get into it because I feel there's pressure for me to say yes. 

We have different schedules. I work early mornings and come home mid afternoon, he starts his workday around 12 and may not end until after dinner time which is when Im winding down from the day. 

Our conflict styles are vastly different. I like to only approach issues when I've had time to think about them and I try to avoid conversations when im highly emotional. He only feels we can talk about these issues when we're feeling certain emotions about it. To me, he comes off as angry and I get defensive when I feel like he's attacking me. 

Our complaints is that we dont feel connected and often feel like roommates. He said he feels like my ""credit card"" because i will pay him back on high ticket items over time (trips, huge grocery haul). 

I just don't know when to know something just cant be fixed. I feel like if we just communicated more in a calmer headspace with goals in mind we can work through this. But its hard to initiate that conversation because we always end up in a spiral where we talk about the same issues ans things. It feels like it becomes a tit for tat instead of a productive conversation. 

Does anyone have any tips for moving forward? Or is this too broken to fix?

Norwalk, specifically South Norwalk, seems like it could be a great fit. Checks all our boxes, and the coastal access, aquarium, and children’s museum are big pluses. 

Please tell me what I might be missing (or tell me that I’m spot-on and should move to Norwalk!). 

FWIW, I know the school ratings aren’t the absolute best relative to some surrounding towns, but they seem good enough at least for elementary school. Not hugely concerned about high school because that’s such a long way off for us. We are also open to Catholic schools if public school doesn’t work out. 

And for context, we also like Rye, Bronxville, Greenwich, and Larchmont, but they seem too expensive and potentially too snooty for us.

[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/14485862/1/Himiko-Toga-everywhere](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/14485862/1/Himiko-Toga-everywhere)

Himiko Toga wanted two thing in life: cute boys and bloody fights. The red liquid tasted the best when it was boiling from adrenaline. Her parents were rich snobs who despised the sight of blood and the fighting of any kind. They wouldn’t even let her apply for tae kwon do lessons. At some point, the girl decided this life is not worth living and ran away from her. Whatever, her younger sister could do all the rich people things their mom and dad want so much.

Himiko has been living her best life as street fighter. She would battle people and drink their blood afterwards. Of course, sometimes the opposition was a little too strong, so she had to run away. One day, little vampire found this cute boy Midoriya, and she wanted to suck him dry, but he is too weak to fight properly. Sloppy movements, no sense of balance, noddle arms. He fell down like a puppet without strings after she did 4-5 measly punches on him. The boy was now lying in the puddle of his blood and tears.

No problem, Himiko could train him, whether he liked it or not. She pulled out a first aid kit from her backpack and helped treat his wounds. After that, they sat down and ate sandwiched at a bench.

""Why? Why did you hurt me?"" Midoriya asked. ""Is this because I’m weak?""

""No, silly."" Toga giggled. ""It’s because you are cute. But yeah, you are weak as hell. We’ll have to change that.""

""Kacchan will be mad if I start training.""

""I don’t know who Kacchan is, but I will be mad if you don’t. And trust, you DO NOT want to see me mad."" Himiko pulled out a knife and inspected it.

Izuku gulped as he awaited her next words.

""I think the best way to train someone is practical experience. I’m going to periodically attack you, and you will do your best to fight back. I’ll go easy first, but every subsequent encounter will be harder and harder. This way, we will have the best kind of fight in the end!""

""N-no."" He weakly replied. ""I don’t want to fight you.""

""HA HA HA!"" Himiko laughed as he grabbed his face with one hand and put the knife near his throat with another. ""You don’t want to fight me? Then you better get to the gym and beat me a bloody pulp! Because I’m not leaving you alone until..."" She sniffed the air. ""Damn it, did you pee yourself?""

Toga had to give him her spare underwear and jeans to not embarrass him further. Izuku didn’t know what was more humiliating: being beaten by a girl or wearing pink panties. In any case, she told him he needs to train. His first thought was going to police, but none of them took him seriously. Was it because female on male violence isn’t treated with respect?

—

Izuku’s life had been turned upside down ever since he met that crazy girl. Midoriya had no choice but to ask his mom for a dojo membership. A nice girl with red ponytail taught him karate. He also had to lift, do cardio and other types of exercises to stay in top shape. Every few days she could appear from anywhere: raise her head from a trash can or a man hole, jump at him from the second floor, get involved in a fight with Kacchan, come out of an elevator when he was walking past it, hand him over new toilet paper in a public restroom etc. Sometimes she was fighting with bare hands, but other times she used baseball bats or knives. Luckily, Kacchan would always help him beat her whenever he nearby, as he found her a ’creepy freak’. Same with Kendou girl, although she felt very sympathetic to Izuku’s peril. Toga would always run away after confirming Izuku was making progress.

Even when Himiko was caught by police (heroes were useless cause she wasn’t using her quirk), she returned after a week tops. When asked how, she joked about cleaning up their guns. The girl is totally jobbing for the first month, but ever so slightly less afterwards, which forces Midoriya to train and learn martial arts, and add techniques that deal with knife wielders.

—

At some point, Toga started to incorporate her quirk to catch Izuku-chan even he least expected it. The first time was a female classmate he was crushing on. She asked him to meet her in the empty classroom, asked him to close his eyes and move lips forward. Instead of a kiss, she immediately punched him in the gut and dropped her disguise. He had to fight with emotional damage and embarrassment as she was completely naked!

It kept going! So far she’s been a waiter at a restaurant, taxi driver, his favorite idol (he should have known a private concert would be a scam), his friend Kacchan (Izuku couldn’t see the difference as she was disguised the entire time), karate instructor Itsuka Kendou, his mother Inko and many more. He managed to figure out that she needs blood to use her quirk, which partially explained her fascination.

All the fights made him beefier and more confident. He could finally confront Kacchan whenever he tried bullying him or other kids. This made other Aldera students respect him a lot more, although he wished the rumors about him ’dating’ that crazy chick weren’t so widespread.

—

During Izuku’s birthday, Himiko came to his home with a rare All Might statue. She said she understands that the boy needs a bit of downtime and reassurance every once in a while, so they could make a truce for weekends or holidays. Considering Midoriya wasn’t very good in friends department, this was perhaps as good as it could get. Toga even stayed when Kendou of all people arrived with a coffee machine.

Izuku was unsure how to feel. On one hand, Himiko made him a total paranoic and she tried to kill him, but on the other hand, she was perhaps his best friend all along. The little vampire motivated him to work out and never lose his fighting spirit. She even procured the thing he wanted his birthday party, played bowling on Sundays and took care of him when he was sick. The green head even begged her to become a hero like him, but she didn’t like the idea. Heroes couldn’t fight whenever they wanted.

—

After a certain Sludge incident, Izuku caught attention of All Might and became his successor. The first few months of getting used to the power were pretty rough. Thankfully, Himiko saw that he was injured and didn’t prey on him. After a bit more focused training, the green head could safely use 20 percent of One For All. Himiko disappeared for months, which made him worried. Noone, not even the police could tell where she was. He could only hope she was okay.

—

Months has passed, Izuku got into UA and his class was going to USJ. The villains attacked! The leader seemed to be... Himiko? She ordered a weird mist man to scatter the students and distract the teachers. Izuku was hers to battle.

Midoriya ran to her as fast as he could, hoping to talk her out of this.

""Himiko, what’s the meaning of this?"" He asked. ""Who are these people?""

""You’re not going to ask how I’ve been doing?"" She sounded disappointed. ""FYI, I’ve joined the organization called League of Villains. Me and Handjob had some disagreements, so I killed him. Then I convinced his sensei to let me be his successor instead. These people are my little helpers?""

""What? Why?"" Izuku was still confused.

""I’ve always been good at hiding in plan sight. I knew that you somehow inherited All Might’s power. You hanged out with him and did a smash comparable to his. It was pretty obvious that I needed a power-up to keep our rivalry in tact. I told sensei that I know how to approach future All Might. Sensei let me be his successor because I know you, and because I want you to bleed for me.""

""Toga, please, don’t do this. I’ll do anything, but you need to stop.""

""Anything?"" She had a wicked grin. ""Than fight me with all your heart!""

The girl rushed at Midoriya. He thought Toga would be outclassed now, but no. She had new quirks! Some kind of regeneration and shock absorption. It took Izuku going plus ultra and breaking his arms to overcome her and send her flying. While she was in the air, Himiko savored the taste of desperate Izu-kun blood.

All Might and Izuku were both shocked by that day’s revelation. Himiko, on the other hand, was more making further plans.

—

Fast forward to Hosu. Toga tried recruiting Mr Stainy, but he told her that mindless blood lust is despicable. They parted ways after she prevented all of his attacks and told him to leave while he was still breathing.

—

Izuku was running through narrow alleyways in hopes of finding Iida. He had to engage in a fight with Stain to save his friend. Everyone got surprised when Himiko walded in, caught one of the knives with her teeth, then grabbed it by the handle and assumed a fighting stance. Stain targeted her first as filthy adrenaline junkie, even paralyzing her in the process, but then Shouto’s backup made him lose to the heroes. Stain and Toga have been apprehended by police, but the girl spit out a weird gray goo and teleported them out. She really liked Mr Stainy’s fighting style, so he was going to appropriate it for herself.

—

Months later, Himiko disguised herself as one of Wolfram’s henchmen. Izuku couldn’t even tell that is was her! Just kicked her to the side as he and another girl hurried to lift the security lockdown. He was progressing so fast.

—

It was supposed to be a nice training session in Wild Wild Pussycats’ forest. Instead, he was running to save the kid who punched him in the balls. When the boy finally got to the Mountain, he saw Mandalay and her nephew running towards him. Except...

Shino Sousaki was just another disguise. Underneath it was Himiko is Mandalay cosplay. She told the boy to the hide so she could have another fight. Despite his pleads to let him get the child to safety, she was adamant about fighting. The first time she landed a bite, Izuku got paralyzed. He was hit by a familiar quirk. Toga stood over his motionless body, a sadistic grin on her face and the tail on her costume playfully moving around.

Kouta Izumi sprayed her with water from behind out of desperation. She turned around and moved towards the little guy.

""No! Don’t hurt him."" Izuku begged.

""You are in over your head, kid."" Himiko said to shaking Kouta. ""A different villain might have killed you for it. The blood curl quirk is so boring! Izu-kun, I’m going to wait until it wears off and then we fight for real. And you better not pretend to be paralyzed for long!""

Midoriya could move, so Toga unleashed Muscular quirk to look less like Mandalay and more like Tiger. This was a tough barrier to overcome, so the boy had to use 1 million percent OFA, shattering his arms and her skull yet again. He moved Kouta back to safety as Himiko had to crawl to extraction point.

—

LOV kidnapped Katsuki to covert him, at least on paper. In reality, Himiko wanted bait Izuku into coming to her lair. Her plans were a bit ruined when AFO and heroes intervened. Her sensei’s old body has been completely destroyed, and her base of operations was no more. On the plus side, she now had Explosion and Search to play with.

League had to make a temporary alliance with Overhaul. Toga decided to squeeze the yakuzas for all they are worth and have another excuse to fight her beloved. She tipped of Sir Nighteye about the whereabouts of the base and the little girl. On the day of the raid, she kidnapped Kai and made Dr Garaki give her a full copy of his quirk. Dressed as Plague Doctor, she made Izuku fight her in exchange for letting Eri go. The healing properties of Overhaul were incredibly potent, so Midoriya had to use Eri’s rewind to keep up. Eventually, he overpowered her and she had to teleport away. Kai’s quirkless but definitely alive body was found shortly afterwards.

—

Himiko and her team were ambushed in Deika City. Luckily, almost all of them were chumps who weren’t able to fight properly. That reporter lady was very insistent on blowing her up, so she had to eat knives for breakfast. It was a tough battle, but the League prevailed.

—

With AFO’s body gone, his minion Doctor Garaki used yakuza’s stolen funds and his vast medical knowledge to perform hos greatest feat. He would use genetic material left by All For One to insert his master’s mind and quirk into the little girl, as well as make the body on par with prime All Might. The idea was for All For One to take over the body, but Himiko wasn’t so simple. Her sheer willpower let her remain in control by attacking and defeating the villain’s vestige in her own mind.

Toga was the peak of humanity’s evolution! This meant she could finally have one final showdown with Izuku! She tied up Dr Garaki and told other League members that they are on their own from now on. Some of them complied, others tried to kill her (poor Dabi), and some begged her to not leave them. She ’cured’ Twice by removing the source of his paranoia, gave him and Spinner disguise quirks so they could leave Japan together. Or not, she wasn’t going to order them around. The girl practiced her quirks for a bit, then put on a nice business suit to cosplay as her late sensei.

—

Himiko appeared in front of UA with all of her power. She demanded one last fight with Izuku. In exchange, she promised to give heroes all the information about remnants of AFO’s influence. When Midoriya got close, she forcefully teleported them into a remote location. There, they could let loose and fight to their hearts’ content. The persuasions failed as usual. Given how strong and filled with quirks Himiko was, Izuku had no choice but to go for a clean hit with his full power.

Himiko had a gaping hole in her chest. Her mouth was filled with a combination of their hot blood. The taste was divine! This was what she always wanted to live for. The girl gave him a usb drive and promised that the world would follow Izuku’s wishes, as he was the best fighter ever...

—

Years later, Izuku was at the altar about to marry a girl he had met in Provisional License Exam. As soon as the bride was asked if she agreed to marriage, Himiko dropped her disguise and called her backup clones from cake, the officiant and some of the guests. Izuku kicked kicked their butts as a sign that he never got any weaker. Then he took the original girl and slipped the ring on her finger anyway. The ceremony concluded as Himiko and her naked clones were kissing Izuku all over his body.",2,1751285763.0,BokunoheroFanfiction,0,0.75,False

But this **MSI Katana 15 HX** with the new **RTX 5070** and **Intel Core i9-14900HX**? It's actually making me question everything I thought I knew about mid-range gaming laptops.

## Why This Laptop Caught My Attention (And Why It Should Catch Yours)

**Ever wondered what happens when MSI decides to stop playing it safe?** Well, the Katana 15 HX B14WGK-016US is their answer. This isn't your typical ""budget gaming laptop with compromises"" – it's more like someone took a premium machine and made it accessible without gutting the good stuff.

The **Intel Core i9-14900HX** processor is the real MVP here. We're talking about a 14th-gen HX-series chip that doesn't mess around – **24 cores, 32 threads, and boost speeds up to 5.8GHz**. For context, this thing makes my old laptop look like it's running on steam power.

But here's where it gets interesting – they paired it with **NVIDIA's brand-new GeForce RTX 5070**. Now, I know what you're thinking: ""Another RTX launch, another disappointment."" But hold up, this one's different.

## The RTX 5070: More Than Just Marketing Hype

**The RTX 5070 in this Katana isn't your typical laptop GPU compromise.** After spending weeks with it, I can honestly say it's the sweet spot NVIDIA has been trying to hit for years. **Ray tracing performance that doesn't tank your framerate?** Check. **DLSS 4 that actually makes a difference?** Double check.

Here's what blew my mind – running **Cyberpunk 2077 at QHD+ with ray tracing enabled**, I was consistently hitting **60-75 FPS** with DLSS Quality mode. That's territory that used to require desktop RTX 4080s, and here we are on a laptop that costs significantly less.

## That QHD+ 165Hz Display: Finally, A Screen Worth Gaming On

**Can we talk about this display for a hot second?** The **15.6"" QHD+ panel running at 165Hz** is what every gaming laptop should have shipped with from day one. The pixel density jump from standard 1080p is immediately noticeable – text is crisp, games look detailed without being demanding on your eyes.

But here's the kicker – **MSI actually tuned this panel properly**. Color accuracy is on point, brightness levels work in various lighting conditions, and the 165Hz refresh rate isn't just a marketing number. In competitive shooters like **Valorant or CS2**, the difference between this and a standard 60Hz panel is night and day.

**Pro tip:** If you're coming from a 60Hz display, prepare to never want to go back. It's one of those ""you can't unsee it"" upgrades.

## Performance That Actually Backs Up The Specs

Let's get real about performance numbers because specs on paper don't mean much if the laptop can't deliver:

**Gaming Performance Highlights:**
- **Cyberpunk 2077 (QHD+, RT Ultra):** 65-72 FPS with DLSS Quality
- **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III (QHD+, High):** 120-140 FPS
- **Baldur's Gate 3 (QHD+, Ultra):** 80-95 FPS
- **Fortnite (QHD+, Epic settings):** 140+ FPS consistently
- **Apex Legends (QHD+, Max settings):** 130-150 FPS

**The i9-14900HX handles everything I throw at it** without breaking a sweat. Video editing in DaVinci Resolve, streaming while gaming, running multiple Chrome tabs (because we all do it) – this processor just doesn't care.

## Cooling: Cooler Boost 5 Actually Works (Shocking, I Know)

**MSI's Cooler Boost 5 system is legit.** I was skeptical because, let's face it, most laptop cooling solutions are more marketing than substance. But after running stress tests and extended gaming sessions, the thermal management actually holds up.

**Temperature readings during heavy gaming:**
- **CPU:** Peaks around 78-82°C (totally acceptable)
- **GPU:** Stays between 72-76°C (impressive for laptop standards)
- **Fan noise:** Noticeable but not ear-piercing

**The best part?** No thermal throttling during extended sessions. I had a 6-hour Baldur's Gate 3 marathon, and performance stayed consistent throughout.

## Memory and Storage: 32GB DDR5 + 1TB NVMe Done Right

**32GB of DDR5 RAM is overkill for gaming today, but future-proofing for tomorrow.** Current games max out around 16GB, but having that extra headroom means multitasking doesn't slow you down. Streaming, Discord, browser tabs, background apps – everything just works smoothly.

The **1TB NVMe SSD** loads games fast enough that I actually stopped checking my phone during loading screens. **Boot times are under 15 seconds**, and transferring large files doesn't make me want to grab coffee.

## Build Quality: Surprisingly Solid for the Price Point

**MSI didn't cheap out on construction.** The chassis feels substantial without being unnecessarily heavy. The **RGB keyboard** isn't just for show – key travel and responsiveness are genuinely good for both gaming and typing.

**Build highlights:**
- **Sturdy hinge mechanism** (no wobble during typing)
- **Decent port selection** (USB-A, USB-C, HDMI 2.1, Ethernet)
- **Keyboard backlighting** that's actually useful, not just flashy
- **Trackpad** that doesn't suck (rare for gaming laptops)

## Windows 11 Home: The Good, The Meh, and The Fixable

**Windows 11 Home does the job**, though MSI's recommendation for Windows 11 Pro in business environments makes sense. The gaming-focused features like DirectStorage and Auto HDR work well with this hardware combo.

**Quick setup tip:** Disable some of the pre-installed bloatware during first boot. Takes 10 minutes and makes everything snappier.

## Real-World Gaming Experience: Where It Shines

**This laptop excels in scenarios where other mid-range options fall short:**

**Competitive Gaming:** The 165Hz display + RTX 5070 combo delivers the high framerates competitive players need. Input lag is minimal, and frame pacing is consistent.

**AAA Single-Player Games:** Ray tracing performance that doesn't require constant setting compromises. You can actually use the pretty graphics options.

**Content Creation:** The i9-14900HX handles video editing, streaming, and rendering tasks that would choke lesser processors.

**Multitasking:** 32GB RAM means you can have everything open without performance anxiety.

## The Few Things That Could Be Better

**Look, nothing's perfect, and honesty matters:**

- **Battery life during gaming** is what you'd expect from a performance laptop (1-2 hours max)
- **Weight** isn't ultrabook territory, but it's reasonable for the performance class
- **Price point** puts it in premium mid-range territory (not budget-friendly)
- **Fan noise under load** is present but manageable

**But here's the thing** – these aren't dealbreakers, they're just reality checks for what this type of machine delivers.

## Who Should Actually Buy This Thing?

**This laptop makes sense for:**
- **Serious gamers** who want high-refresh QHD+ gaming without desktop complexity
- **Content creators** who need powerful hardware in portable form
- **Students/professionals** who game hard but also need legitimate computing power
- **Anyone upgrading** from older gaming laptops ready for a significant performance jump

**This probably isn't for you if:**
- You're primarily gaming at 1080p and don't care about upgrading
- Battery life is your top priority
- You're strictly budget-shopping under $1500
- You already have a recent RTX 4070+ laptop and are happy with it

## Final Thoughts: Actually Worth Your Money?

**After weeks of real-world use, this MSI Katana 15 HX delivers on its promises.** The RTX 5070 + i9-14900HX combo provides genuine high-end gaming performance, the QHD+ 165Hz display enhances every game, and the build quality justifies the price point.

**Is it perfect?** Nah. **Is it the best gaming laptop value in its price range right now?** Pretty damn close.

**The bottom line:** If you're in the market for a gaming laptop that can handle today's demanding games at high settings while being reasonably future-proof, this Katana 15 HX deserves serious consideration. It's one of those rare laptops that performs better than its price suggests it should.

**IMO, MSI finally nailed the balance between performance, features, and price** with this one. Worth checking out if you're serious about your gaming setup.
