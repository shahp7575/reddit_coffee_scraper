But the library is our work space.

I can't go there on my day off without staff - annoyingly but understandably - piling work or work conversations on me. That's not solvable, certainly not to the point where I could ever relax there enough for it truly to be my third place/space.

1n5iva7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlanWake/comments/1n5iva7/theory_about_rose_and_the_cult_of_the_tree/,"Theory about Rose, and the cult of the tree","I've been thinking about this one, after replaying Alan Wake 2 multiple times, and actually re-reading the notes and paying close attention to the story, I came to a wild conclusion.

Rose is responsible for a lot that happened in the game, and could potentially be the ""grandmaster"" the cult of the tree mentioned a few times.

At the beginning of the game, you play as Nightingale and the cult of the tree tries to kill him with the clicker but they were interrupted, reading notes from the cult's HQ, it was said that the clicker washed up on the shore and the cult knew of it's power, there are multiple reasons why they could know this, but I am going with Rose telling them about it's power, she was the ""Lady of the Light"" at some point or still.

You might be thinking, what does Rose and the cult have in common? Well the lady of the light's job is to protect the people in bright falls from the taken, the cult of the tree was made to protect them as well by using the clicker.

Now let's talk about the coffee in this game, when you arrive at bright falls, Tim Breaker offers you, and Alex coffee, Saga refuses (coincidence?), but Alex never says no to a coffee, then Tim and Alex begin talking together sipping the coffee, you already know from the North star DLC that you should never drink the coffee, and Tim is in this DLC for a reason, because he drank the coffee.

Alan Wake wrote night springs as a way to get out of the dark place, so everything that happens in there is techincally the dark place, since you only really see it during Alan's playthrough with the theme song and episodes (DLC).

Back to the main game: Tim says the bookers are ""inside, having coffee and pie to calm their nerves"", so we already know the bookers, who were at the cult of the tree scene drank the coffee. Notice how EVERYONE who drank the coffee ended up in the dark place in this game? the bookers are seen in Alan's playthrough talking about the cult's play as echos. Tim ended up in the dark place RIGHT after he had a sip of the coffee due to Door, Alex gets corrupted by Scratch at some point and is also affected by the story, etc

And who is providing all of this coffee? Rose at the diner, you can even see her talking about her ""special coffee"" in the night springs dlc.

Fast forward a bit to the cult's HQ, you read some notes from the FBC spying on Rose and keeping an eye on her schedule, because she knows something the FBC don't, and she could possiblity be a parautilitarian.

In those notes they say at 9:44 AM she and I quote ""Spills a cup of coffee. Stares at the coffee puddle and seems suddenly delighted, begins talking animatedly to the puddle"", this I believe is Alan Wake she is talking to, and the puddle/coffee is a direct connection to the dark place, we know near the end of Alan's playthrough he talks to himself. He is his own deus ex machina, I believe this Alan is the one talking to Rose and trying to help himself understand how to escape the dark place.

I believe the coffee Rose is making everyone drink is to help them be apart of Alan's story by getting them a bit closer to the dark place, where his writing can be a reality, the horror story he wrote, and rose is trying to help the hero of the story aka Saga.

Rose talks about Deerfest and how ""Everyone wears a mask"", this could be a hint about the cult of the tree helping people at Deerfest, or to not think of anything suspicious when Saga does see people wearing the mask.

I think the cult of the tree told Rose about what happened with the Bookers so she offered them a pot of coffee so they won't intrude. Ilmo and Jaakko also own coffee world so they could be contributing to the coffee theory.

It always confused me when Ilmo mentioned a Grandmaster even though they founded the cult of the tree, it's probably because Rose is the Grandmaster because she held the lamp and sent it to Alan, and they know of / use the clicker and it's power to banish the Taken.",1,1756713889.0,AlanWake,0,1.0,False

1n5itrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1n5itrc/my_brother_the_narcissist/,My Brother the Narcissist,"I'm mainly writing this out as a vent. 

My little brother is a Narcissist. To the point where by comparison I was never sure my parents were or not. But my father *did* get verbally abusive, and a couple of times threatened to hit me. 

Anyway, for over 9 years I was bullied by a sibling that displayed prominent NPD traits. Constantly antagonizing, constantly insulting me, evil/hateful stares every time I entered the room, rage yelling at me like a TV drill sergeant, spreading out if I had to sit beside him, turning friends against me at school for no other reason than ""just because,"" snitching on me if I did anything he didn't like, veiled threats at the dinner table nearly nightly, ""shoulder checking"" every time I'd have to walk by. And I'm the older one.

In school he inserted himself into my friend group just to irritate me. He did some real Machiavellian things back then, most of which I can only vaguely recall. I do remember quite a lot of laughter at my expense and him whispering threats towards me. And that cocky smug look every time I started to get mad.

So, a couple of incidents that mostly occurred during high school days. One was where we were having an argument and I was sitting down. I guess he decided he was tired of hearing my mouth so he grabbed his hot coffee, poured it on me, and ***then*** said ""oops!"" mockingly. I jumped up to go after him but my father, who never moved so fast before, was already prepared to punch me right in the face. I stopped in my tracks right before that, otherwise I'd have been waking up on the floor. 

Then there's ***The Incident***

So I'm about to take a shower one day, and this dude is coming home from work after what was obviously a bad day. He's pounding on the bathroom door, demanding to be let in, accusing me of jumping in there ""just to piss (him) off."" Calling me a mother fucker, calling me certain 6 letter ""f"" words, and a slew of threats. Telling me he'll beat my ass as soon as I get out. 

I take my shower, then leave. I don't remember a lot of what occurred *directly* after that, probably the usual intimidation where he'd get up close, puff out his chest and try to start something. 

Somehow we end up in the kitchen, he's still going on and on about me being a piece of shit for ""jumping into the bathroom"" because I somehow *""knew""* he was coming home. He's yelling in my face, turning red, and he's got me in the corner, saying ""do something about it!"" Anyway, I guess all of those 9 years of being shit on got to me and I punched him. Then I punched him again. And a third time, which caused his eyes to flutter in this unsettling way. 

My father got involved so I backed off. Went back to doing the dishes. I hear screaming from outside the kitchen and turn around just in time to be punched in the face. (The interesting thing here is that he's bigger, stronger, and trained to fight. My parents let him take self defense and MMA classes, but told me it would be a waste of time and money for me to take any such classes. Back to the story..) so for every punch I throw, 3 are hitting me in the face. I slip on a wet spot, he grabs me and throws me through the dinner table, breaking off the leg in the process, before putting me in a chokehold. My father had to force him to let go and got himself injured in the process. 

I'm barely able to stand up, light headed as hell, and being screamed at by my father to clean up the mess of which there is a lot because my brother didn't care what he destroyed in the process (dishes, holders, etc I just remember it was a huge mess), while my brother declares ""fuck this"" and goes to hang out with his friends. 

So imagine this. You've been bullied and humiliated by someone for 9 years, just to end up standing up for yourself, only to be beaten up. Then you're accused of starting it out of ""jealousy"" (mother's words), and told other things like ""it takes 2 to fight"" (father's words). Even my sister was ""disappointed"" and asked ""how could you do that?"" 

And for years I only felt humiliation and shame about myself. I mean who do you know that gets their ass handed to them by their little brother? I still think about this almost every day.
These are only a couple of incidents from the top of my head.",1,1756713723.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

Tried dating apps such as FB dating, Bumble, and Tinder with no luck from the previous years. Reinstalled bumble for the past days kasi why not ky free time na ulit ako then may naka match ako na isang girl(28F) from QC, Ok naman si ate gurl mo pasok sa tipo ko siya and we hit it up naman from the start, although we've had 1 day na usapan lang gusto niya agad mag meetup which is fine din naman sakin kasi I preferred meeting up in person agad base sa description ng profile ko I preferred this way din kasi to see if the level of attraction can still be maintained sa personal. 

So fast forward last sunday, sakto naman at may lakad din ako na balak ko na lang siya puntahan after that lakad, we set to meetup na malapit lang sa lugar niya and and I let her choose the place which is a local coffee shop on the area. Around noon time like an hour before the meet up nagsabi siya na medyo may hangover daw siya kasi may kasiyahan daw sila ng mga ka officemate niya sa condo last night at tinanong ko naman kung okay at kaya ba niya na makapunta which sabi niya keri naman daw niya. Tinanong ko rin kung gano ba siya kalayo sa meeting place and she said about 10 minutes lang naman daw so sabi ko okay kasi malapit na din naman ako. I arrived at the coffee shop before 1PM kaso wala pa si ate gurl so I decided to order muna ng coffee. 20 minutes passed and no updates, iniisip ko baka na stood up na ako haha then about 30 minutes. Dumating din naman siya. Kala ko casual lang ang mangyayare na usap lang or kumustahan sa coffee shop more like getting to know each other ang mangyayari, di pa kami nakakaupo sabi niya may mas alam daw siyang place na mas okay daw tambayan eh di ko pa nababawasan ng 1/4 yung coffee ko sabi niya iwan ko na daw kasi baka ano isipin dun sa shop na pupuntahan namin which is weird pero pinagbigyan ko na lang.

 Pumunta kami dun sa sinabi niyang place na di din naman kalayuan sa coffee shop, yung place is mini resto bar infairness instagramable naman yung lugar, masarap din yung food I recommend it for dating. Sabi ko total first meetup naman to pumayag naman siya na sagot ko siya. Sa pilian ng food yung una medyo mura yung pinili ko na food sabi niya nahihiya daw siya kasi mas mahal daw yung bet niya sabi ko goods lang and don't mind it. So ayun na nga, medyo vocal si ate gurl and madaldal which is hindi naman turnoff sakin kasi mas maganda nga yung ganun kasi parang hindi boring yung date. Let's say may outgoing personality siya. 

Ayun andami naman namin napagusapan tungkol sa buhay buhay like dati daw siyang taga pasig lumipat sa cainta bla bla bla kala ko talaga nag click kami or like there's some connection. Nagtanong din siya ano work ko which I explained din naman sa kanya. Then nung nag explain siya sa work niya may gusto siyang ipasok na topic na about stem cell something. Sabi niya graphic designer daw siya currently and may part time daw siyang ginagawa which is yung drop shipping (I still don't have idea kung ano ba to nung naguusap kami). And I dont mind na may side hustle si ate kasi di biro yung ganung dedication ah. So middle of the conversation nung nalaman niya na may supplement ako na tinitake pinasok niya ulit yung topic ng stem cell sabi ko sa kanya mukhang mahal yun kasi alam ko ini-inject yun sabi niya hindi daw. Kala ko lilipas na yung topic na yun. Sabi niya check ko daw kala ko like check ko sa fb or google ganun hindi pala. 

Natapos na kami kumain kala ko goods na like bounce na sana ako. Sabi niya samahan ko daw siya muna papunta sa office nila kasi papakilala daw niya ako dun sa mga ka office mates niya napaisip ako angbilis ah pero go lang ang kuya mo haha. btw yung office is di naman kalayuan dun sa  kinainan naming place tapos base sa usapan namin magaling daw siya mag reto ganern,  kaya pala nung tinatanong ko ano hanap sa lalaki either pogi or mayaman daw which is napa ""okay"" na lang ako mukhang alanganin na agad ako dun haha. So ayun sinamahan ko naman niya, pagdating ko sa lugar yung harap ng building alam mo yung typical na pang frontrow yung mga nakalagay, may mga tarpaulin sila ng highest earner ganun tapos may mga pang hikayat na mag invest daw kuno. Sabi ko sa kanya ay sorry di ako papasok diyan. Dun pa lang ako naghinala na ako like damn parang pang networking ata to ah haha. Nag insist siya na hindi daw sila ganun. Na pioneer daw sila and check ko lang naman daw wala naman daw ako ilalabas na pera tapos nakipag argue na ako na I can't commit sa mga ganyang bagay, kasi wala naman talagang passive income, like lahat yan need mo paglaanan ng oras at pera which is di ko kaya ma commit sa ngayon. Naghahanap siya nung kakilala niya sa labas possible colleague niya din buti wala namang ibang lumapit samin, sabi ko sa kanya pasensya na di ako interested and di ako comfortable sa place na yun. Wala naman siya nagawa kaya umalis na lang din ako ng medyo dismayado. 

Nakakainis lang kasi kala ko genuine na yung usapan namin kasi sa totoo lang I'm interested to her lalo yung mga sinabi niya about sa situation niya and family niya etc. after that feeling ko hindi totoo yung mga bagay na sinabi niya nung nag meet kami. Nakakapanghinayan lang din na nag invest ka ng oras at panahon like bruhh pumorma din naman ako tapos tapos networking pala sa dulo haha (aray ko!). Ayun lang gusto ko lang mailabas to kasi nahirapan ako matulog kagabi hahaha nakakatrauma pala kasi nababasa ko lang to at nakikita ko sa meme di ko inasahan na mangyayari din sakin lol.

1n5isls,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1n5isls/what_should_i_do_after_finding_out_a_coworker/,What should I do after finding out a coworker lied about an affair and dragged my dad into it?,"Throwaway account. All names have been changed to protect privacy. English is not my first language. This is a long story, so thank you in advance if you take the time to read it.

So, I (22M) met Suzy (20F) at Hanukkah. She was the girlfriend of my cousin Marc’s (30M) best friend Josh (26M). I’ve known Josh for a long time, though we were never especially close. He and whoever he is dating at the time usually attend our family reunions and holiday celebrations.

That’s how I met Suzy this past Hanukkah. My little sister and I are the youngest in the family, and at gatherings we usually sit apart from the adults since we don’t care much for their conversations. That’s when Suzy came over and sat with us, and that’s how she and I became friends.

She mentioned she wanted a job since she attends university at night, and I told her my father could probably help her find an opening at the corporation where he works. I also work there.

She eventually got a position at one of the companies within the corporation, the same one where my father works, while I am based at the headquarters. It was nice to see her at corporate events.

Her department handles internal control and risk management, meaning they are tasked with monitoring compliance and preventing irregularities among the higher-ups.

Months after she started, Marc told my father that Josh suspected Suzy was having an affair with the company’s director, which would obviously be a serious conflict of interest.

According to Josh, when he confronted her, she denied everything and claimed the director was actually harassing her. He also said he found a second phone the director had given her, and that the texts he claimed to have read suggested otherwise. Still, he never provided proof, which I thought was strange. Who finds those kinds of messages and doesn’t take screenshots?

When my dad spoke with her directly, she gave a different explanation. She said it all began as a rumor spread by some girls she didn’t get along with. One day, when Josh was waiting in the parking lot to pick her up, he overheard them talking loudly on purpose, making sure he would hear. Later he checked her Instagram, saw that the director had DM’d her once, and from there his suspicions grew.

She also said that Josh had escalated the situation by claiming he had somehow accessed the GPS of the director’s corporate phone, and that it showed the director at motels during work hours “with her.” He even claimed someone had seen them together. She insisted these were lies he made up to pressure her into confessing. I knew the GPS claim was impossible, because no one has access to that data, nor is it even tracked.

Suzy denied everything, pointing out it would not even have been possible. She could not leave during work hours without a signed form from her supervisor, and her supervisor confirmed she had never requested such permission.

She implied Josh wanted to get her fired out of revenge. I don’t know Josh very well, but even though I love Marc, it did seem like the kind of thing Marc might encourage to get even.

I admit I have a flaw: I befriend people too quickly and trust too easily. Because of how I was raised, I am also inclined to believe women when they say they’re being lied about or harassed. I know there are workplace prejudices against women, and many rumors turn out to be false. So I believed her. So did my dad, and so did her supervisor.

When the rumor reached the corporation’s headquarters, my dad defended her to our boss and criticized the people she accused of starting it. And if what she said was true, it wouldn’t have been the first time those girls had done something similar.

So we continued being friends. I even told her that if it was true, I wouldn’t have cared since it was her personal life. She told me she wasn’t the type of person who would risk her career for anyone, especially not for the director, who was much older and not very attractive.

She briefly got back with Josh before breaking up again, because he said he had found more messages. Once again, he didn’t provide evidence. She was heartbroken after the final breakup and couldn’t stop talking about it.

One evening after work, she invited me and my friend Tyler out for coffee. Afterwards, we went back to my house. It got late, too late for them to go home, so I told them they could stay. At some point, Suzy and Tyler started making out. I figured it was good for her since it might help take her mind off Josh.

The next morning Tyler told me he was surprised and hadn’t expected it. I encouraged him to pursue it, since he didn’t work at the company, and she was attractive and kind. I thought it might be good for both of them, and they both agreed it wasn’t serious.

Later, Suzy told me she wanted to reconcile with Josh. She asked my opinion, and I told her it was a terrible idea, especially since he had tried to get her fired. She told me I was judging him too harshly and that there was “more to the story.” When I asked what, she admitted she had been in contact with the director through DMs, though she claimed it was friendly. She also admitted that, after my dad confronted her, she went to lunch with the director once just to get back at Josh.

I was shocked that she had lied before, but I still gave her the benefit of the doubt. By that time, though, my dad had already defended her in front of our bosses, and if it turned out the rumor was even partly true, it would reflect badly on him. I also realized I had shared far too much about my personal life with her, which made me uneasy.

After that, she retold the story multiple times, always adding small new details she hadn’t mentioned before. I still didn’t believe all of Josh’s accusations, but I decided the best thing I could do was distance myself. I gradually cut contact gradually so it wouldn’t be obvious, and told Tyler everything so he’d understand what kind of person she was.

I also told my dad, and he told me never to go near her again or invite her to our home.

One night, I got a text from Tyler asking if he could stay at my place. He lives far from work and usually takes public transportation, but it was too late for the bus. I told him of course. Then he said he was out with Suzy. I called him a simp. Then he asked if she could also stay, and I told him he was being delusional and that I would need to ask my dad, which I obviously didn’t do. I just told him my dad wanted to know if he was “still being a moron” and what I should reply. I was just teasing Tyler. It turned out it wasn’t even him texting me, it was Suzy, using his phone.

After that, I was angry at Tyler, because he knew I didn’t want Suzy to realize I was distancing myself. I only wanted to avoid more drama. So I told the entire story to my friend Marie to get another perspective, since she knows all the parties involved. I had introduced her to Suzy, and since they worked at the same company, they became close and often had lunch together.

That is when Marie told me that almost everything Josh had said was true. The director had given Suzy a second phone. Suzy told Marie she had returned it, but I know that can’t be true since Josh claimed he found it. Marie also said Suzy and the director frequently went out to lunch together, since Suzy disliked the cafeteria food and usually left with him. According to Marie, Suzy also told her she was no longer in communication with the director, but honestly I’m not so sure about that. Marie even confirmed that someone had seen Suzy and the director together at least once. That reminded me of something Josh had said the second time they broke up: that he had seen messages where Suzy and the director were speaking badly about my family. At the time I dismissed it, since Josh always made outrageous claims and never showed evidence. But after hearing Marie’s confirmations, I am almost certain that part was true as well.

Now I am stuck wondering if I should go to our boss and tell him everything, how Suzy lied from the start and dragged my dad into defending her. I know that if I do, she will probably lose her job.

I have never been responsible for someone losing their job, and I still don’t think Suzy is a bad person, just extremely immature. She is also very young, and I don’t want to damage what is essentially the beginning of her professional career.

At the same time, I know I was wrong for taking Suzy’s word over Josh’s, when I have known him through Marc for much longer. Marc was the one who first told my dad about the rumor, and I probably should have taken it more seriously at the time. I even bought Josh an expensive bottle of tequila to make amends, and I’ll give it to him at the next family reunion.

Through Suzy I also found out that Josh doesn’t have a good relationship with his own family, and that he sees ours as the standard for how a family should be. That’s why he spends every holiday and family celebration with us. Realizing that makes me feel even worse about doubting him and taking Suzy’s side.

So now I don’t know what to do. If I go to my boss and admit everything, it might protect my dad but will almost certainly cost Suzy her job. If I stay quiet, my dad’s credibility may be damaged. What would you do in my place? Are there any alternatives I haven’t thought of? I’d really appreciate advice on how to handle this.

TL;DR: I defended coworker Suzy against rumors she was having an affair with our company’s director, even involving my dad, who also works at the same company. Later I learned most of the rumors were true. Now I don’t know whether to go to my boss to protect my dad’s reputation — which would likely cost Suzy her job — or stay quiet",0,1756713619.0,Advice,0,0.5,False

1n5ipw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1n5ipw7/1_month_build_1_month_live_what_ive_learned_so/,1 Month Build → <1 Month Live: What I’ve Learned So Far Building My SaaS,"Hey folks,  
I wanted to share my early journey building and launching my SaaS mostly because I know a lot of us are in the same boat, trying to figure things out.

* **Build time** → It took me just about **1 month to build the product** (nights, weekends, and lots of coffee ☕).
* **Launch** → I went live **less than a month ago**.

Since then, here are some lessons I’ve picked up that might help someone else:

1. **Speed matters, but clarity matters more** I thought building fast would be the hardest part. Turns out, *explaining the value clearly* is way harder than coding. People need to get the “aha” in seconds.
2. **Distribution is 10x harder than building** Launching was exciting, but I quickly realized “if you build it, they won’t just come.” Marketing, positioning, and community building feel like a whole different skillset.

4. **Momentum is everything** Even small wins (a new signup, one positive DM, a piece of content that resonates) fuel the next step. Without momentum, it’s easy to feel like you’re shouting into the void.

Upon sitting there and enjoying our cakes and coffee, a cockroach was on the table opposite to us. A few moments later one was crawling on the wall. Staff didn’t seem bothered even after we pointed it out. Naturally we left. 

I’ve had a similar experience several months ago at Bread Basket Atria as well, that was in the evening. 

I’m a foreigner and have been living here for more than a year, so I don’t wish to offend or criticise since this is the best city in the country in my opinion. Simply genuinely curious, as I now heavily dislike and am hesitant to eat out ever in the city. Only going places where I know I’ve never had an issue for the time being…

Is it normal to expect cockroaches in a restaurant?

Backstory - I (26f) and my husband (29m) have been together 4 years, married for 5 months. I had a situation where my life was in danger, and he saved me. We decided I couldnt live there anymore and chose to move in together. A week after we signed our first lease together, about 8 months into dating, I found out he was cheating on me. He had three girls he swapped nudes with and had relationships with strictly online (one girl was local, but according to their messages they'd talk about getting coffee but never did) for around a month or two total. Unable to break my lease (and not being able to find anywhere I can pay on my own like my prior residence), we chose to get therapy. I was already in therapy myself for around 2-3 years at this point for mental health struggles and suicical thoughts, and we also engaged in couples therapy and he got his own therapist. Turned out he had a really bad porn addiction and when that wasn't doing it, he turned to live chat rooms. From there, he would go on to find non-swers to have these conversations with. 

All the therapists agreed and assured me this was a one time thing, and they really didnt think he was a serial cheater. They said he has a problem but that we could move on from it. He deleted all social media and as far as I know stayes off it. I spent that entire year miserable. I hated him somedays. But I couldn't leave, I couldn't afford to. I cried a lot, especially because I rehomed my elderly pet rats, my babies, bc they werent allowed on our new lease. I threw in his face a lot how much of my life I changed for him while he did this to me. 

Time moved on though, and eventually it stopped hurting all together. I never, or very rarely, think about that at all. My therapist retired last December, but since stopping I haven't felt like I needed it. He proposed Christmas, I said yes, and we got married last March (I didn't want a wedding so we eloped). We're extremely happy now, have open communication, and are trying for a baby, but unfortunately one of us is infertile. We do not know who yet. I also unfortunately lost my job and was falsely arrested (when it rains it pours right), so I've been looking for a new job and he's been paying the bills while I figure this mess out. Other than the money stress, this set up has been nice. I cook nice meals and clean more. We're spending more time together than ever (I worked nights) and while difficult, this is also a great time for us to 'practice' budgeting, as he wants me to be a stay at home mom someday. He started doordashing on top of working 50+ hour weeks to support this notion.

Jump to now:
I thought things were pretty perfect until tonight. I could not sleep last night at all. Not even a minute. And then tonight it was the same. I cannot sleep. We've had a busy couple days so I should be exhausted. This didnt make sense. I have no clue why, but for the first time in 2 years, I had the urge to go through his phone. I didn't last night, I kept telling myself it was wrong. But today I gave in. 

Not only did I discover he's going to sex chat sites again, but he is on X now, which he told me he used for football, but I'm not that stupid. He messaged a porn star (she didn't respond of course) telling her he loved her content and wanted more. This immediately made me spiral out and I went back into full detective mode. Unfortunately, he got a new phone so I can't comb it as much as I want. But I did find his recently deleted images. 3 nice selfies of himself that I've never seen from earlier this month, porn I made for him of me/us from years past, and a fairly long video of himself...going at it alone. He took it recently. Now in the past I have asked him to send me videos like that, but he never would. And I know for a fact I never got sent that one. He also never showed me those selfies, which might sound odd, but this man NEVER takes selfies, let alone 3 nice ones in a week just to delete. He was also trying to access 'companion ai', which he knows I loathe and actively advocate against, but idk if he did. The last 'evidence' I have is cashapp. We dont use it, we're a venmo family. So when I saw it as his last searched app, but it was uninstalled, I assumed the worst. He's paying for sex chats/porn with live women. I have no proof, and it is a possibility he used it for fantasy football dues, but then why delete it right after? He doesn't delete apps ever. His phone is a graveyard of unused apps. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know how to confront him. I need advice, but I can't come up with a solid question to ask. What would you do?? How would you confront this?? I have nothing and nearly nobody without him. I love him but fuck dude, I can't go through this again.

It had been three days.

Three days since I saw the bright blue baseball cap in our garage, confirming my suspicions.

Confirming that my mother, the one who tucked me in with a kiss every night, the one who cut my crusts off my sandwiches..

She hurt that boy.

She probably killed him.

I was too scared to ask.

After I discovered the abandoned hat of my former bully/classmate, Warren, my mom gave me a big hug. She didn’t let me go for a long time, and I thought it was because she could feel my heart pumping so hard through my chest.

“I’m so happy I could finally tell you, my sweet Anna.”, my mother said, brushing the hair out of my eyes.

I blinked at her, slowly.

“I just hate that I’ve kept this part of me away from you for so long, it feels good to tell you.”, she said casually, tossing the towel she was using to dry her hair in the laundry room.

I still hadn’t spoken, I was trying to wrap my head around it all.

I kept waiting for her to laugh, say she was joking, and that she found Warren’s hat on the sidewalk.

But it didn’t come.

This happened on Friday, and come Monday, I understood that this was to be my new normal.

As I was getting ready to leave for school, my mom handed me my backpack and held my hand. We crossed the front doorway together, but her hand lingered on mine before I could cross our front lawn.

“Now, I hope you already understand. But you can’t tell anyone about Warren, okay?”, she said sweetly.

Well that should be easy, since I didn’t actually know what happened to him.

“Okay.”, I said quietly.

“I mean it, Anna. No one. Not your teacher, your classmates, not even Kate. Things could.. Things would get really bad. For both of us..”, she explained.

“Both of us?”, I asked.

She smiled at me sadly.

“Yes, both of us. See, now you’re an ‘accessory’ because you know about it. So, if people find out, we could both go to jail, and we don’t want that right?”, she asked, concern framing her delicate eyelashes.

I began to cry.

“I don’t want to go to jail!”, I wailed, earning the attention from a neighbor passing by on his way to the mailbox.

My mom’s eyes flared open as she met the stare of the man.

“Sorry!”, she chirped, “I told her I would tell the police if she didn’t clean her room! Kids!”

She forced out a loud laugh, and the man smiled and waved his hand at us.

She waited until he was out of earshot before she leaned close to my ear, her presence felt like ice on my skin.

“Anna. Do not do that again. Do you understand?”, she seethed, squeezing my hand tightly.

Pain began to shoot up my wrist, so I nodded quickly.

“Yes, mommy.”, I quivered.

Her grip relaxed.

“Good.. My sweet girl, I’ll see you after school. Have a good day!”, she kissed me on the head and leaned against the front doorway, watching me walk to the bus stop.

I walked robotically, my mind was occupied with what my mother could have done to Warren.

And what else she was capable of.

When I turned the corner for the stop, I’m greeted with rainbow nails, and shiny bracelets clinking together.

“Anna banana!”, Kate hollered and raced to me.

Her arms enveloped me in a hug and she was already babbling about everything she watched on tv while she was sick.

She was rambling about a tv detective named Olivia Benson when she noticed I hadn’t said anything.

“Anna? What’s wrong?”, she asked, tilting her head to the side.

I started to cry, for the second time that morning.

Big sobs escaped me as I put my hands over my face to mask the sound I was making.

“Anna!”, Kate whisper-shouted, before holding me close to her.

But I was crying so hard, I couldn’t get a word out.

“Anna, it’s going to be okay. Should I call your mom?”, she asked.

“No!”, I sobbed, causing her eyes to widen.

She looked at me puzzled.

I couldn’t lie to her.

“I need to talk to your mom.”, I said, hiccuping on my last few tears.

Kate nodded slowly.

“Okay, let’s go.”, she said calmly.

We turned down the other way from where I came from and walked towards her house.

We didn’t say anything to each other, but Kate held my hand the whole way there.

*

When we got to Kate’s house, she pushed open the door and called for her mom right away.

From the kitchen, her mom’s head poked out, her face laced with confusion.

“Girls? What’s going on?”, she asked us.

“Anna said she needed to talk to you..”, Kate said, all her usual confidence gone.

Once her mom’s eyes settled on my face, she rushed to me in a hug.

“Anna, what’s the matter?”, she asked kindly.

I was quiet for a second, rubbing tears out of my eyes, and I looked at Kate’s terrified face.

Her mom caught on immediately.

“Kate, can you go to the kitchen and get Anna a glass of juice?”, she said, turning to her daughter.

Kate nodded quickly and bolted out of the foyer.

Her mom leaned in closer to me.

“What’s wrong, sweetheart?”, she whispered.

“I-I…”, I stammered.

Kate’s mom just patiently waited for me to gather my courage.

“I think my mom hurt Warren.”, I whispered.

Her face did not change, she didn’t seem surprised at all.

“Why do you think that?”, she asked.

“I found his hat in our garage, and my mom said she was happy that she didn’t have to hide who she was anymore, and that I couldn’t tell anyone.”, I whispered.

Her face still didn’t change.

“But she said.. If I told anyone, that I was ‘accessoried’ and that I would go to jail too because I knew..”, I trailed off, the tears coming back.

This time, her face did change.

It was quick, but her eyes filled with anger.

Just then, Kate returned with a cup of orange juice.

“Here you go, Anna. I brought you some tissues too.”, Kate said, holding out crumbled tissues to me.

“Let’s go watch a DVD girls, Kate, let Anna choose.”, her mom said calmly.

“What about school?”, I asked.

“I’ll call them, we are going to have a girls day instead. Is that alright?”, she asked.

“Yeah! I’m never going back!”, Kate cheered, as she brought out every Barbie DVD she could find.

“We’ll see about that, Katherine.”, her mom said, as she walked to the front door and flipped all three of the locks on it.

She crossed back into the living room and picked up the house phone.

“I’m going to go into my office and call the school to let them know, I’ll be right back. But do not answer that door to anyone, okay girls?”, Kate’s mom ordered.

We both nodded, and she opened the door to the basement and disappeared.

I wasn’t in the mood to pick a movie, so Kate picked the one called Barbie The Princess and The Pauper.

When the iconic song of the movie came on, Kate started to sing it, but I didn’t join in as I usually do.

“Are you sure you’re okay?”, she asked me.

I nodded.

“Just some stuff with my mom, I’ll be okay.”, I responded.

She shrugged, and shifted her attention back to the screen.

About 20 minutes later, loud banging began on the front door, causing Kate and I to jump.

“Who is that?”, I whispered.

Kate got up and ran to the kitchen, grabbing a knife from the block next to the stove.

“What are you doing????”, I demanded.

“I don’t know! I saw Olivia Benson do it!”, Kate whispered back.

“Anna? Anna! Open the door!”

My mom.

I began to shake, as I walked to the door.

“Anna!”, Kate whispered, “My mom said not to open the door!”

“But it’s my mom..”, I said sadly.

“Okay.. Just.. Wait..”, Kate said quickly.

I looked at her.

“Let me get my mom first, we can’t undo the top lock anyways, it’s above the door.”, she said.

She took out her phone and sent her mom a text.

We heard the phone ping downstairs.

“Just wait for a second, I’m sure your mom is fine.”, Kate said reassuringly.

As if we both just realized, we turned towards the front door.

The banging had stopped.

Kate walks to the door, and peers out the windows surrounding it.

“Your mom isn’t out there.”, Kate informed me.

“What? Where did she go?”, I asked, pushing past her to look for myself.

Kate didn’t lie, my mom wasn’t out there.

Kate took out her phone and fired off another message to her mom.

We heard another faint ping from below.

“Maybe she’s on the phone?”, I offered.

“She would message me back if she was..”, Kate said, looking over her shoulder towards the basement, knife still in hand.

“Maybe we should go check?”, I said, gently taking the knife from her and walking to the door with her in tow.

She nodded.

As we opened the basement door, I heard a sound that didn’t sound like talking. It sounded like an animal, like when my mom hit that stray dog with her car last year. It moaned and whined until animal control came for it.

As we walked down the stairs, I realized the sound wasn’t an animal at all.

As the basement came into view, I saw a large space with a desk and comfy couches.

And Kate’s mom tied up on one of them.

“Mom!”, Kate screamed, as she ran to her mother.

“Oh my god!!!”, I yelled, racing after Kate.

Kate reached her first, and was trying to undo the phone cord binding her mom’s hands and feet together.

“Girls..”, her mom whimpered, “it’s not safe.. go.. get help.. please..”

Kate’s eyes filled with tears as she continued wrestling with the cords.

“I’m not leaving without you.”, she said between sobs.

“Now isn’t that true mother-daughter loyalty?”, a familiar voice sounded from behind us.

Kate and I slowly turned, and faced my mother.

She was wearing the same thing that I saw her in this morning, but she looked different. Her normally perfect hair was now frizzy, sticking up at weird angles. Her makeup was smeared under her eyes, and her eyes…

They didn’t look like my mother’s normal eyes.

“Mom.”, I whispered.

“Anna.. I gave you one job, one job! And the second you’re out of my sight, you tell someone? We just went over this, an hour or so ago?”, she wondered out loud.

I’m frozen.

“Your school called when you didn’t turn up, but I thought that was weird since I watched you go to the bus stop. So I thought, hmmm, where could she have gone between here and school? And it just hit me, that you had to tell someone and of course it would be your best friend!”, she rambled, laughing maniacally and pacing the basement.

Kate looked at me out of the corner of her eye, and when her mom groaned again, she moved to be beside her.

“So I get here, and you don’t open the door. Right? Is that right, Anna? You didn’t open the door for your own mother?”, she asked, stepping closer to me.

I nodded, shaking.

“So! I reached into my brain and tried to remember, and oh, I remembered. The first night I came to get you, another time you betrayed me, Kate’s mom mentioned that she had a side door to see patients out of. Which, is a great idea! Keep the crazies down low and away from your daughter, right? You never know! What could happen?!”, my mother screeches towards Kate’s mom.

I feel like I’m not breathing.

“Well! Couldn’t keep all the crazies away, huh?”, my mom laughed as she crossed the room in one swift movement.

I closed my eyes, bracing for impact, when nothing comes.

Then I heard Kate’s voice cry out.

“Kate!”, I screamed as my mom grabbed Kate by the hair and began to walk towards the still open basement door to the outside.

Her mom yelled, and tried to sit up, but she couldn’t make it. When she thrashed back down, I saw blood on the side of her head.

“Please.. Kate..”, her mom whimpered.

“Well it’s only fair! You stole my daughter, I steal yours! An eye for an eye! But don’t worry, I doubt with the brick I threw at your temple, you won’t be alive much longer to see it anyways.”, my mom said in her sweetest voice.

Kate was sobbing, her mom was growing quiet, and my mom was halfway out the door with my best friend in tow.

I had to do something.

“Mommy?”, I said quietly.

My mom froze, but didn’t turn to me.

“I’m sorry, Mommy. I was scared. But you are right, Warren.. needed to be hurt for being mean to me. And.. Kate’s mom.. deserved to be hurt too, for trying to keep me from you..”, I said, stepping closer to her.

She turned to me slowly, her eyes were wild but tears were falling from them. Her hand was still wrapped around Kate’s hair.

“And Kate, is so bossy sometimes. She always tries to tell me what to do, and I’m tired of it.”, I said.

Kate’s face fell.

“Maybe we need to hurt her too.”, I said softly.

My mom’s face grew into a wide grin, as she tossed Kate on the floor and wrapped her arms around me.

“Oh my sweet Anna, I could never stay mad at you. I’m sorry we fought.”, she said into my hair.

I hugged her back as tightly as I could.

Because I knew this would be the last time.

“I’m sorry too, Mommy.”, I whispered.

Then I pulled the kitchen knife out from behind me and stabbed my mom in the stomach.

Her eyes went wide, as she looked down at her sweater, slowing turning the cream color to red.

I’m sobbing now, and still holding onto the knife.

She looked back up at me, and her mouth opened like she wanted to say something, but nothing came out.

“I love you Mommy, I love you Mommy, I love you Mommy, I love you Mommy….”

I whispered until she collapsed on the floor.

I couldn’t stop the crying, as I picked up Kate’s discarded cell phone and made my own call.

“911, where is your emergency?”

*

*10 years later*

“Don’t wait up!”, I called through the apartment as I grabbed my phone and keys.

“Oh I won’t!”, Kate’s voice sounds from her room.

She steps into the living room wearing an all sequined dress, putting on lipgloss.

“Are you sureeeee you don’t want to come? It’s supposed to be the last good frat party of the year.”, she says, fluffing her hair with her rainbow nails.

“Mmm, tempting. But, I’ll pass. I told Jeremy I would meet him tonight for coffee.”, I respond, clasping my bag shut.

“I don’t know why you’re meeting him when the asshole literally cheated on you with his TA, but you do you.”, she says, rolling her eyes.

“I’m just hearing him out, I have no interest in getting back together.”, I laugh.

“Okay.. Just don’t be out too late, we have breakfast with my mom tomorrow, and if you’re tired I will tell her you’re getting back with Jeremy just so you feel her wrath!”, she cackles as she grabs her own bag and keys.

“Definitely don’t want that, I promise this is just for closure.”, I respond as we both cross our front door.

We wave goodbye and go in our opposite directions. Kate, always to the next party. Me, to the coffee shop down the street.

After everything went down with my mother 10 years ago, Kate’s mom survived her head injury and took me in. She was in the hospital for a few months, and even wrote a book on her experience, making it a bestseller. 

Kate had a mild concussion but came to just as the police were showing up, when she saw me she cried and hugged me as tight as she could. She knew I didn’t want to hurt her, but she was surprised to hear that I did think she was a little bossy… sometimes.

My mom..

Where do I begin?

She survived, and was found guilty.

And besides Warren and my biological father, her kill count was apparently much higher.

She was sentenced to multiple life sentences.

Kate’s mom asked if I wanted to go to her trial, or to see her in prison, and I always politely declined.

I can’t look at her after knowing what she did, what she almost did, and how she tried to manipulate me to be part of her world.

I’m also close with my dad’s biological family now. We got to meet after the headlines of the trial, and it took a long time, but they’re some of my favorite people now.

I’ll be seeing them for new years, with Kate and her mom, I’m thrilled.

As much as I’ve tried to move on, my mom’s ghosts follow me every day, though I try to shrug them off as best as I can.

I near the coffee shop and see Jeremy is already inside.

He’s sitting with a cappuccino, and flirting with the waitress who seemed to be clearing some plates at a nearby table.

He really is shameless.

I walk inside and stand next to the table, waiting for him to notice me.

Once he does, he blinks quickly.

“Anna! You’re here! Why don’t you sit?”, he asks.

“Actually.. it’s such a lovely night. Can we take a walk?”, I ask, giving him my best smile and reaching out my gloved hand to him.

His eyes twinkle, and they don’t leave mine as he downs his cappuccino and he gets up quickly. Grabbing his things and putting his coat on.

“A walk sounds great, babe. Let’s go.”, he says, winking.

I grab his hand and lead him out of the shop, the bell over the entrance ringing as we cross under.

We walk in a comfortable silence for a moment before he starts in.

“Anna, I love you. I’m sorry. She came onto me, and I know that sounds pathetic, but that’s what happened. The whole time I was wishing it was you, and the second time I was literally pretending she was you. I know, I fucked up..”, he rambles.

But I’m not listening.

I’ve made up my mind about tonight already.

“Hey, Jeremy.”, I interrupt.

He shuts up, looking at me with puppy dog eyes.

“I forgive you, it’s okay.”, I say, smiling.

His face relaxes.

“Oh thank you, baby. I promise, I will never hurt you again.”, he says, his cool exterior hardening back into place.

“I’m not worried about that.”, I say, smiling sweetly.

He smiles lazily at me, and I look around to see no one around us.

Everyone’s at that party.

“Do you want to know why I’m not worried?”, I ask, leaning in.

He nods.

“Because of trust, trust is what all relationships are built on. Romantic, friends, family.. if we don’t have trust, we have nothing. You know?”, I ask.

He nods again, but his brow furrows.

“So I guess, Jeremy, I just have one question for you..”, I whisper.

He gasps as I pull my familiar kitchen knife out of my jacket pocket and hold it up to his scaly throat.

The Gaggia just looks a lot more sleeker and aesthetically pleasing but the Delonghi has more grind settings. I’ve been sitting on this for weeks and can’t bring myself to decide! Please help

1n5igwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutsourceDevHub/comments/1n5igwq/how_custom_ai_solutions_are_revolutionizing/,How Custom AI Solutions Are Revolutionizing Business Innovation in 2025,"Let’s be honest—AI is everywhere these days. Everyone’s talking about it, some companies are using it, and some still think it’s a passing trend. But here’s the kicker: the real magic isn’t in generic AI that tries to “solve everything.” The magic is in **custom AI solutions**, built specifically for the quirks, pain points, and dreams of your business.

If you’re a developer wanting to level up, or a business owner wondering how to make AI actually useful instead of just a fancy buzzword, stick around. This isn’t your average “AI will take over the world” article.

# Why Off-the-Shelf AI Often Leaves You Hanging

Generic AI is like that free coffee you grab from a gas station—it’ll wake you up, sure, but it’s not going to give you the smooth, tailored kick of a perfectly brewed cup. Off-the-shelf AI can handle basic tasks like answering emails, filtering tickets, or analyzing spreadsheets. But as soon as you throw in messy data, legacy systems, or complex workflows, it hits a wall.

Enter **custom AI**. This is AI built around *your* business: your processes, your datasets, your goals. It’s like getting that bespoke suit—everything fits perfectly, no awkward bunching in the shoulders, no “one-size-fits-none” compromises. Companies like **Abto Software** have been helping businesses take this leap, building AI systems that actually make sense in the real world.

# What Custom AI Can Actually Do

Here’s the fun part—once AI is tailored to your needs, it stops being a toy and starts being a workhorse.

* **Optimize operations:** From automating repetitive tasks to predicting maintenance issues, custom AI frees humans to focus on the stuff that really matters. Less busywork, more strategy.
* **Smarter decisions, faster:** AI can crunch mountains of data and uncover patterns that a human would need coffee and three weeks to figure out. Predictive analytics, risk assessments, forecasting—you name it.
* **Better customer experiences:** Personalized recommendations, tailored offers, and predictive support all come from AI that “gets” your business. Customers notice when they feel understood.
* **Save money in the long run:** Sure, building custom AI isn’t free. But it can reduce errors, streamline workflows, and optimize resources, paying for itself faster than you think.

The key is that the AI is designed with your data and goals in mind, not some generic, cookie-cutter model. That’s where Abto Software shines—they help clients implement AI that’s practical, scalable, and smart without the usual headache of trial-and-error.

# Real-World Examples That Actually Impress

Custom AI isn’t science fiction—it’s happening *right now*.

* **Healthcare:** Imagine AI analyzing patient histories to recommend treatments or flag potential complications before they happen. Hospitals can save time, reduce errors, and improve outcomes.
* **Finance:** Fraud detection, risk scoring, and automated customer support all get a boost when AI is tailored to the bank’s exact data streams and regulations.
* **Manufacturing:** AI predicts equipment failures before they occur and helps maintain quality control. Fewer stoppages, fewer angry engineers.
* **Retail:** Beyond simple recommendations, custom AI can predict trends, optimize inventory, and even suggest localized marketing campaigns based on real-time consumer behavior.
* **Logistics:** Smarter routing, predictive supply chains, and inventory optimization—tailored AI can handle the chaos that comes with complex networks of suppliers and customers.

# How Developers Are Pushing the Limits

What’s really exciting is how developers are innovating with custom AI:

* **NLP and smarter chatbots:** Not just “Hi, how can I help?”—AI can interpret context, tone, and subtle customer cues.
* **Computer vision:** In manufacturing, agriculture, and even retail, AI can literally “see” defects, track inventory, or monitor compliance.
* **AI as a co-pilot:** Custom AI isn’t here to replace humans—it’s here to augment them. Think decision support, predictive alerts, and smarter dashboards.
* **IoT integration:** Real-time data from connected devices feeds AI at the edge, so decisions happen instantly, not after waiting for some cloud server to catch up.

These innovations are exactly what firms like Abto Software are helping clients implement—AI that’s not just flashy, but genuinely useful.

# Challenges You Can’t Ignore

Custom AI isn’t magic. It’s brilliant, but it comes with caveats:

* **Data security:** You’re trusting AI with your most sensitive information. Protect it.
* **Talent matters:** Skilled developers, data scientists, and domain experts are critical. Partnering with experienced companies can save headaches.
* **Scaling pain points:** A pilot might look amazing, but can it handle ten times the data or users? Design for growth.
* **Ethics and bias:** Make sure your AI doesn’t unintentionally discriminate or make decisions you’d regret.

# Tips for Successfully Rolling Out Custom AI

1. **Define the problem clearly:** Don’t just adopt AI because it’s trendy. Know exactly what you want it to solve.
2. **Start small:** Pilot projects help you test, iterate, and refine before scaling.
3. **Work with experts:** Experienced developers can anticipate pitfalls and speed up delivery.
4. **Set KPIs early:** AI should improve outcomes in measurable ways, not just “look cool.”
5. **Maintain and update:** AI evolves with your data. Keep it monitored, retrained, and relevant.

# Wrapping It Up

Custom AI solutions are no longer optional—they’re becoming essential for companies that want to innovate and stay competitive. For developers, diving into custom AI is a chance to build expertise in cutting-edge technology and real-world problem solving. For business owners, working with teams like Abto Software ensures that AI is implemented smartly, securely, and in a way that actually delivers results.

In short: if your AI isn’t custom, it’s probably just a very expensive paperweight. 2025 is the year to stop buying “off-the-rack” AI and start tailoring solutions that actually work for *your* business.",1,1756712372.0,OutsourceDevHub,0,1.0,False
1n5igl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualPH/comments/1n5igl5/friendly_date_naging_mlm_pitch_sa_dulo/,Friendly date naging MLM pitch sa dulo,"So ayun na nga I've(28M) been long single. Tried dating apps such as FB dating, Bumble, and Tinder with no luck from the previous years. Reinstalled bumble for the past days kasi why not ky free time na ulit ako then may naka match ako na isang girl(28F) from QC, Ok naman si ate gurl mo pasok sa tipo ko siya and we hit it up naman from the start, although we've had 1 day na usapan lang gusto niya agad mag meetup which is fine din naman sakin kasi I preferred meeting up in person agad base sa description ng profile ko I preferred this way din kasi to see if the level of attraction can still be maintained sa personal. 

So fast forward last sunday, sakto naman at may lakad din ako na balak ko na lang siya puntahan after that lakad, we set to meetup na malapit lang sa lugar niya and and I let her choose the place which is a local coffee shop on the area. Around noon time like an hour before the meet up nagsabi siya na medyo may hangover daw siya kasi may kasiyahan daw sila ng mga ka officemate niya sa condo last night at tinanong ko naman kung okay at kaya ba niya na makapunta which sabi niya keri naman daw niya. Tinanong ko rin kung gano ba siya kalayo sa meeting place and she said about 10 minutes lang naman daw so sabi ko okay kasi malapit na din naman ako. I arrived at the coffee shop before 1PM kaso wala pa si ate gurl so I decided to order muna ng coffee. 20 minutes passed and no updates, iniisip ko baka na stood up na ako haha then about 30 minutes. Dumating din naman siya. Kala ko casual lang ang mangyayare na usap lang or kumustahan sa coffee shop more like getting to know each other ang mangyayari, di pa kami nakakaupo sabi niya may mas alam daw siyang place na mas okay daw tambayan eh di ko pa nababawasan ng 1/4 yung coffee ko sabi niya iwan ko na daw kasi baka ano isipin dun sa shop na pupuntahan namin which is weird pero pinagbigyan ko na lang.

 Pumunta kami dun sa sinabi niyang place na di din naman kalayuan sa coffee shop, yung place is mini resto bar infairness instagramable naman yung lugar, masarap din yung food I recommend it for dating. Sabi ko total first meetup naman to pumayag naman siya na sagot ko siya. Sa pilian ng food yung una medyo mura yung pinili ko na food sabi niya nahihiya daw siya kasi mas mahal daw yung bet niya sabi ko goods lang and don't mind it. So ayun na nga, medyo vocal si ate gurl and madaldal which is hindi naman turnoff sakin kasi mas maganda nga yung ganun kasi parang hindi boring yung date. Let's say may outgoing personality siya. 

Ayun andami naman namin napagusapan tungkol sa buhay buhay like dati daw siyang taga pasig lumipat sa cainta bla bla bla kala ko talaga nag click kami or like there's some connection. Nagtanong din siya ano work ko which I explained din naman sa kanya. Then nung nag explain siya sa work niya may gusto siyang ipasok na topic na about stem cell something. Sabi niya graphic designer daw siya currently and may part time daw siyang ginagawa which is yung drop shipping (I still don't have idea kung ano ba to nung naguusap kami). And I dont mind na may side hustle si ate kasi di biro yung ganung dedication ah. So middle of the conversation nung nalaman niya na may supplement ako na tinitake pinasok niya ulit yung topic ng stem cell sabi ko sa kanya mukhang mahal yun kasi alam ko ini-inject yun sabi niya hindi daw. Kala ko lilipas na yung topic na yun. Sabi niya check ko daw kala ko like check ko sa fb or google ganun hindi pala. 

Natapos na kami kumain kala ko goods na like bounce na sana ako. Sabi niya samahan ko daw siya muna papunta sa office nila kasi papakilala daw niya ako dun sa mga ka office mates niya napaisip ako angbilis ah pero go lang ang kuya mo haha. btw yung office is di naman kalayuan dun sa  kinainan naming place tapos base sa usapan namin magaling daw siya mag reto ganern,  kaya pala nung tinatanong ko ano hanap sa lalaki either pogi or mayaman daw which is napa ""okay"" na lang ako mukhang alanganin na agad ako dun haha. So ayun sinamahan ko naman niya, pagdating ko sa lugar yung harap ng building alam mo yung typical na pang frontrow yung mga nakalagay, may mga tarpaulin sila ng highest earner ganun tapos may mga pang hikayat na mag invest daw kuno. Sabi ko sa kanya ay sorry di ako papasok diyan. Dun pa lang ako naghinala na ako like damn parang pang networking ata to ah haha. Nag insist siya na hindi daw sila ganun. Na pioneer daw sila and check ko lang naman daw wala naman daw ako ilalabas na pera tapos nakipag argue na ako na I can't commit sa mga ganyang bagay, kasi wala naman talagang passive income, like lahat yan need mo paglaanan ng oras at pera which is di ko kaya ma commit sa ngayon. Naghahanap siya nung kakilala niya sa labas possible colleague niya din buti wala namang ibang lumapit samin, sabi ko sa kanya pasensya na di ako interested and di ako comfortable sa place na yun. Wala naman siya nagawa kaya umalis na lang din ako ng medyo dismayado. 

Nakakainis lang kasi kala ko genuine na yung usapan namin kasi sa totoo lang I'm interested to her lalo yung mga sinabi niya about sa situation niya and family niya etc. after that feeling ko hindi totoo yung mga bagay na sinabi niya nung nag meet kami. Nakakapanghinayan lang din na nag invest ka ng oras at panahon like bruhh pumorma din naman ako tapos tapos networking pala sa dulo haha (aray ko!). Ayun lang gusto ko lang mailabas to kasi nahirapan ako matulog kagabi hahaha nakakatrauma pala kasi nababasa ko lang to at nakikita ko sa meme di ko inasahan na mangyayari din sakin lol.

The relationship (10 months),"Last year, this guy, Ky (36M), confessed that he has a crush on me, MJ (34F). Backstory: we are both single parents, and our kids are best friends. We both have one child both (14F)

My ex was friends with him first, but that’s for an AITAH post.

Before the confession, I was helping the girls get better at basketball. So, after a while, I was building a bond with his kid. I was making posts saying I was getting better with my girls.

Around the fall of last year, he confessed he liked me, and I said I liked him too. So, we started talking endlessly for a couple of months, even going on a couple of lunch and coffee dates (or so I thought). On our ""first"" date, we talked about ourselves and our backgrounds, then we talked about taking it slow. Months later, I was saying I have two girls and that I “adopted” his kid as mine—that’s how much I bonded with his kid. (As of right now, I love his kid.) At this time, we had been on a handful of dates with no kissing or hugging. For about a month now, I started to have feelings for Ky. It’s almost been 10 years since I felt this way.

Just today, I spent the day with Ky and his kid. I asked Ky if we could talk about us. His response was, “Like as friends?” It struck me that I was the only one in the relationship. I felt so stupid and embarrassed. He said he still likes me, but at this moment, his life is a mess and he can’t get into a relationship. He also said I’m one of his truly good friends. He said sorry a lot of times. I even told him I was having feelings toward him.

Director immediately goes, “No.”

So I start giving the textbook definition of a marketplace. He cuts me off: “We’re not selling anything. It’s a website that connects buyers and sellers who take their own risks, like OLX.”

Me out loud: “Yes sir.” Me internally: Man, Olx is a marketplace website,

But instead of moving on, he starts lecturing me: “You should just do what you’re told.”

Me internally: Bruh… I just gave an opinion, why are we in philosophy class now?

Then he says: “You can’t break into this field without an academic background.”

My brain: Excuse me? Did he just gatekeep me in 4K? Me out loud: “Well, there are exceptions. You can break in through skills and portfolio too.”

He doesn’t like that. I share my plan: Product Management, MBA, etc. Him: basically, “Stop dreaming, kid.” Me internally: Bro, I didn’t ask for your life advice. Just interview me for the role!

Then comes the tech sermon: “You should also code with design. Not just design.”

Me internally: ??? Did this guy just ask me to be a one-man startup? Out loud: polite nod. Inside: Sir, do you want me to design the logo, code the backend, clean the office, and make you coffee too?

HIM: well you can learn about others aspects of this business and learn and always say, Yes Sir no ok or other thing.

* **Taupe Hollow:**
   * 2x Typhlosion, Arcanine, Charizard, Healer
   * 21 Inferno curries. Prepped corn.
* **Snowdrop:**
   * 5x Walrein
   * 15 Coffee salads, 6 tail salads. Prepped coffee + potatoes + tails + herb.

I wanted to ask about acid reflux post vsg. So my main question is that has anyone here had the vsg while dealing with some acid reflux pre-op? I know that some people develop GERD post-op. But I want to hear from people who have been dealing with acid reflux pre-op and got the vsg. How did it affect your reflux? Did it worsen it? Did it stay the same? I'm very curious to hear your stories. Also I don't usually get acid reflux just because! (I'm still pre-op) usually there are foods that trigger it mainly black coffee, sour things, and some flour products (specially if they are not homemade) it also sometimes happens when my stomach stays empty for too long like 20 hours or something. So it would really help me to know the causes of your acid reflux pre-op.",1,1756711394.0,gastricsleeve,0,1.0,False

When I returned, I learned I was missing for 10 years.","Have you ever spent years of your life with someone just to find out none of it was real?

I had met Andrew when I was 22, working as a bartender for a shitty hole-in-the-wall bar. He was an incredibly outgoing individual that effortlessly brightened the day of anyone who was within fifteen feet of him. He had made the lonely closing shift of a dead Tuesday enjoyable and after I got off of work we met up for coffee and waffles at a nearby diner.

The chemistry we had was unlike anything I had ever experienced before and it wasn't long before we began dating. Andrew became my rock that I could always rely on to keep me grounded when the rest of the world was caught up in a squall of chaos. He embraced my love of b-movie horror and I accepted his enthusiasm for the outdoors after weeks of convincing on his part.

Andrew was the life of the party and while there were times that I just wanted to stay in and binge slasher movies, he would tease me for being a homebody and drag me out of the house to meet up with one of his Neverending swaths of social circles for bowling, Lazer Tag, House Parties, or his absolute favorite, The Late Night Hike through the forest that stood behind the shitty bar I had worked at when we met.

It had been a major milestone for me when I quit the bar six months after Andrew and I met. With his support and encouragement I started my own business in a niche field that I was actually passionate about. While the money isn't best, I love the work I do and even the worst days are still better than having to mop up bodily waste from someone who had too much to drink.

At a 40th Anniversary showing of *The Rocky Horror Picture Show*, Andrew proposed to me during the *Dammit, Janet* scene. His collection of friends, who had grown on me fast and became my friends as well, hooted and cheered for us and took us out for celebratory drinks after the show. Since that chance encounter two years previously, my life had become my own personal heaven. The work I did now was fulfilling, I had an amazing new group of friends, and I was now engaged to the best man I had ever met.

“Hey, I found the perfect place we should go for a nice picnic and hike.” Andrew told me as I was grabbing the last load of laundry from the ancient dryer in Andrew’s basement.

“I was hoping that we could just stay in for the day, Andy. Since I moved in, it feels like we have been going non-stop.” I replied, tired but not annoyed at the suggestion. After his proposal, I moved into Andrew’s two bedroom house. It was quaint but there always seemed to be another little project that needed to be tackled. With both of our work schedules, there never seemed to be enough time in the day to fix all of the little quirks the house had. 

“Oh, c’mon Christy,” He said, wrapping his arms around me and giving the side of my neck a kiss. “Wouldn’t it be nice to actually enjoy the three-day weekend we have to actually get out and have some personal time together.”

“Mmmm,” I moaned as his soft lips and blonde facial hair brushed against the side of my neck. “Alright, I guess it would be nice to spend time together, just the two of us.”

Despite moving in together, we hardly had any time to ourselves. The mass of friends were constantly inviting us over and out to celebrate the engagement and to offer help with planning the wedding. It had left us little time to ourselves and the chance to be alone in nature would be nice.

“This place we are going to has a nice little spring with a few nooks and crannies out of sight from the main trails.” Andrew informed me as he hurriedly threw supplies into his hiking bag, the mischievous look on his face made my face redden.

“Andy, you naughty boy.” I said before playfully swatting at his butt. He returned the gesture with a pinch of my own butt before tossing the bag over his shoulder and nearly dragging me to my car.

During the three hour drive to the national park that we would be hiking through I had dozed off, as we finally arrived Andrew woke me with an excited expression.

“Here we are, miles and miles of trails. A chance to really connect with nature.” He beamed with a smile that brought one to my own face.

“Where did you even hear about this place?” I asked, shaking the last of sleep from my eyes before sitting forward.

“Sam and Frankie were telling us about it the last time we went bowling, don’t you remember?”

“Not really, with all of the friends we have and ideas tossed around, it is hard to keep track of everything.”

“Lucky for you I have a steel cage for a mind,” He responded, lightly tapping his temple with a finger.

“More like a rusty bear trap,” I teased as I mocked a rusty trap closing with my hands.

We shared a laugh before he parked and we set out for our hike. Andrew had planned a long trek that would bring us back to the car a little before dark. I was glad I had worn an old outfit so that I wouldn't have to worry about getting covered in mud. When I asked about who would be doing the driving back home after we hiked all day and he eased my worry with the promise of a stay at the motel we had passed twenty minutes before we arrived. A place I would have seen had I not fallen asleep. With satisfaction at his call ahead and carefully laid plans, we set off into the forest for our day of just the two of us.

“Isn't that the same outfit you wore when we met?” Andrew asked, his eyes feasting up and down on my body.

“Yeah, I thought I'd just throw on some old clothes since you wanted to go on an intense hike,” I replied, snapping my fingers to get his attention. 

We both laughed as we ventured further down the trails.

An odd thing I noticed while we hiked was the strange absence of other people while we hiked.

“I thought you wanted time together not with a horde of others?” Andrew said as we stopped at the top of a cliff with an old picnic table for people to rest before beginning their descent towards the spring.

“Of course I want time without a ton of other people, I just think it is strange that we haven’t seen anyone else while we have been here. I mean it IS a holiday weekend, you would think we would have passed by some other wilderness enthusiast or gun-ho parents dragging their kids along to get away from technology for once in their life.”

“This is a pretty big place, we probably have passed by others but just didn’t notice them,” Andrew said as he sat his bag down on the table and stretched his arms. I smiled as he took off his shirt and stretched his taught form. I took a few steps towards him and gave him a peck before I spoke again. 

“Take a picture with me.” I said leaning against him and fishing my phone from my pocket.

As he wrapped an arm around me, I lifted the phone up and took a picture of us. As I went to take another, a large buck jumped out from behind a nearby tree, startling us both. In slow motion I watched as my phone leapt from my hands and down the cliffside to the unwelcoming arms below. With a faint crack from below, I could feel my heart drop to my stomach.

“Fuck, fuck, fuck, I dropped my fucking phone. That stupid fucking deer made me drop my phone. Goddammit I could kill that shitty fucking thing!” I yelled out in frustration.

“Woah there, I think you might have broken a commandment there,” Andrew said, placing a hand on my shoulder.

“I’m glad you think this is such a joke, Andrew.”

“I’m not trying to make a joke out of it. I am sure we will be able to recover any photos that are on your phone, plus it was old anyways. I'm pretty sure you have had the same phone since we met. I know you've been wanting to upgrade for a while but haven't really had a chance.” He said as diplomatically as he could.

We made our way down to where we were sure the phone had fallen and luckily we were able to find it. The phone had dived straight into the soft embrace of rocks and branches and the shattered screen was more than enough evidence of how useless it would be. Andrew pulled a plastic bag that had once contained trail mix and placed the destroyed phone inside before stashing it away in his hiking bag.

“First thing tomorrow, we will go and get you a brand new phone. The best one they got, even if it means I gotta sell a kidney to get it for you,” Andrew said, trying to cheer me up, obviously aware of my disappointment at losing the collection of memories of our life together that had been gathered on my phone.

We continued on towards the springs, crossing over an old wooden bridge that created and groaned with every step as we crossed over it. The entirety of the short time we spent crossing it, my whole body was on edge at the overwhelming sensation of the bridge threatening to collapse at any moment.

With the momentary hazard passed we found our way to a pleasant spring resting beside a cliffside. The gurgle of water leaking out and falling down onto the rocks below created a serene background besides the rustling wind and crunching of leaves and twigs as we approached it. 

Leaning forward, Andrew cupped his hand and brought a handful of spring water towards his mouth before sipping at it.

“Are you sure you should be drinking that?” I asked, thinking about what things could be contained in that water.

“You drink spring water that's bottled with millions of micro plastics in it, at least this is straight from the source,” Andrew said as he splashed his face with the spring water. 

“Y'know, there is a little overhang here that we could…” Andrew trailed off as he made a gesture with his hands.

“I'm not really feeling up to it. I am still irritated about dropping my phone and don't think I am in the right headspace for that,"" I said, noticing a momentary flash of rage cross Andrew's face before it shifted to an understanding look of disappointment.

“Well, you should at least try this water,” He gestured to the water as he spoke before glancing absently in the distance.

I tried a small sip of the water and the taste was heavy with a strange metallic taste. Just before I was about to comment, Andrew was already stepping off towards the trail.

When we approached another bridge, I insisted that Andrew lead the way as it spanked across a rather steep decline. After he proved the structural integrity of it, I began crossing for myself. Just as I made it halfway through, a horrid crack from the wood echoed through the air.

As I fell through the bridge, my hands stretched out to catch myself. The nails of my left hand dug into the wood before being ripped out as my weight jerked my body below. In the briefest of moments I looked out towards Andrew, a malicious smile greeted me as I tumbled towards the earth below and was embraced by darkness.

As I regained consciousness, I was greeted with the sight of a stag skull wrapping its long tongue around the bleeding fingers of my left hand. I screamed out in terror only to be greeted with Andrew's worried face gracefully holding my bandaged left hand.

“Thank God you're okay,” Andrew said, slowly setting my hand down and helping me sit forward. My clothes caked in dirt and a long tear down the right side of my jeans with scrapes and cuts leading to the missing shoe on my right foot.

I tried to reply but he hushed me to conserve my energy. He told me he was going to climb back up and try to call for help as he didn't have any signal where we were.

I tried to beg him to help me back up but he was already walking away before I could form the words. I raised my undamaged hand to my head and was greeted with a sharp pain on the side of my head and a small wet patch of blood.

Panic racing throughout my body, I forced myself to my feet. It felt like hours since Andrew had gone off for help and it was now well into the night. I stumbled my way through the overgrowth and began my slow ascent up the hillside back towards the trail.

Upon finally reaching the trail, surrounded in the darkness of night, I looked around for any trace of Andrew only to be greeted by silence. The sounds of wind or wildlife were missing and the only audible noise was my labored breathing and rapid heartbeat drumming in my ears.

Dragging my way back to the spring, I greedily drank from the water, ignoring the odd aftertaste. Glancing at a small pool of water at my feet, the shadowy reflection I saw was a skeletal form of myself. I turned away as tears filled my eyes. Pain rippled through my body as I shambled through the dark, my head swimming as my vision blurred.

“Christy! Where are you!” Andrew yelled out in the distance before he rounded a corner, coming into view.

Calling out for me in Andrew’s voice was an eight-foot monster. Legs bent backwards connected to a skeletal torso draped in baggy flesh that stretched and shifted to attempt to mimic the human form. The swollen and bulbous head had two antlers poking out as the mouth of broken teeth cluttered together in the attempt to form a smile as the thing hunched over to greet me. I was stunned into silent horror as the beast with Andrew’s voice reached out to me.

“You…hhhaaaadddd m-m-me-eee s-s-so-oo-oh wor-or-rree-reed,” The familiar voice struggled to say through gnarled teeth as charred hands wrapped around my wrists.

I yanked my hands back as adrenaline scattered my body away from the demented form. I ran away, heart pounding, panic and tears blurring my vision almost as much as the leaves and branches that smacked my face as I escaped in a direction that I hoped would lead to freedom. 

Atop the cliffside where I had dropped my phone, I paused long enough to catch my breath. Leaning against the picnic table was an old metal trekking pole with electrical tape wrapped around the worn out handle. I grabbed the ancient hiking stick and leaned against it before starting back out of the forest when Andrew pulled himself over the cliffside.

Without thinking, I brought the brass mud tip of the pole down onto Andrew's amorphous face, knocking a chunk of fleshy clay off in the process.

Andrew dropped to his knees with flakes of ash rising from his body. The blob of his head formed into a grainy recreation of the face I had stared into for countless hours since we met at the bar all those years ago.

“I…love…you…” spoken to me in a voice similar to that of an animal mimicking the words of a person. Smoke rose from the missing chunk in his head before his body fell into a confusing blend of shapes that I couldn't decipher.

Tears streaming from my eyes, I turned away from my fiancé and fled from the forest around me.

As I shuffled past the edge of the forest, I was greeted with the familiar sight of the bar I had met Andrew at so long ago. A small group of people smoking outside noticed me immediately and rushed over to me as I collapsed. The last of the adrenaline spent as safety from my living nightmare finally embraced me.

I had been missing for ten years.

On the magical night I had met Andrew and thought I had begun an amazing life with my soul mate, I had, in reality, closed the bar after an empty night and walked directly into the forest behind the bar in a trance-like state.

When my car was found the following morning by the bar owner, she called my phone to see if I was having car troubles the night before. When I didn't answer, she checked the security footage to find me walking off into the forest. Her concern heightened as the grainy video displayed a strange shadow figure at the edge of the trees seemingly luring me towards it.

For six months they searched the forest only to find my damaged phone and my lost shoe. The worst was assumed and my missing persons poster had circulated the state but after all these years I was assumed dead.

Miraculously, I had somehow survived, vastly malnourished at 70 pounds, patches of hair missing, several poorly healed scars littered my body. The worst of which were the scars around my wrists and ankles that remind me too much of rope burn scars, the implications as terrifying as the monstrous forms Andrew had taken.

There had never been an Andrew.

I try to tell myself that everyday. 

But I still have all of these amazing memories of someone who truly loved me and all of the memories we created together with friends.

When I have explained the memories I have of the time since I left the bar all those years ago, I have been told it was my mind trying to protect itself.

Creating an imaginary world where everything was perfect to shield me from the hell I was actually living.

Even as those memories begin to fade and I accept the reality that there never was an Andrew, I still miss him.

I loved Andrew.

He was my soul mate.

When I wake up drenched in sweat from the night terrors of that final hike, one thought still lingers.

What would have happened had I continued the fantasy with Andrew?

Would I have ever escaped?

Or would I still be…

Wondering if taste altering from a strain?,"So I recently made myself very ill trying a probiotic. About 3-4 weeks later I've mostly recovered, but in the process I have noticed some taste changes. I found myself no longer liking all my light roast fruity coffee for one and hopefully I reaquire my taste for it. But now I'm noticing that, with glasses I've doubled checked were clean with no dish soap after smell, my tap water is giving me an apple juice aftertaste. It literally tastes like someone lightly rinsed out a glass that had apple juice in it no matter what container I try.

Oh I am also regularly eating the oh so wonderful Icelandic provisions yogurt and hex ferments kraut. I've never experienced that aftertaste before though.

Anyone know if this is a common taste change report from a certain strain. Or should I be worried about my tap water? No one else notices small things like that but I will ask them if they think they can taste it too. I will try some bottled water soon to see if its me or the tap.",1,1756711322.0,Probiotics,0,1.0,False

Andrew dropped to his knees with flakes of ash rising from his body. The blob of his head formed into a grainy recreation of the face I had stared into for countless hours since we met at the bar all those years ago.

“I…love…you…” spoken to me in a voice similar to that of an animal mimicking the words of a person. Smoke rose from the missing chunk in his head before his body fell into a confusing blend of shapes that I couldn't decipher.

Tears streaming from my eyes, I turned away from my fiancé and fled from the forest around me.

As I shuffled past the edge of the forest, I was greeted with the familiar sight of the bar I had met Andrew at so long ago. A small group of people smoking outside noticed me immediately and rushed over to me as I collapsed. The last of the adrenaline spent as safety from my living nightmare finally embraced me.

I had been missing for ten years.

On the magical night I had met Andrew and thought I had begun an amazing life with my soul mate, I had, in reality, closed the bar after an empty night and walked directly into the forest behind the bar in a trance-like state.

When my car was found the following morning by the bar owner, she called my phone to see if I was having car troubles the night before. When I didn't answer, she checked the security footage to find me walking off into the forest. Her concern heightened as the grainy video displayed a strange shadow figure at the edge of the trees seemingly luring me towards it.

For six months they searched the forest only to find my damaged phone and my lost shoe. The worst was assumed and my missing persons poster had circulated the state but after all these years I was assumed dead.

Miraculously, I had somehow survived, vastly malnourished at 70 pounds, patches of hair missing, several poorly healed scars littered my body. The worst of which were the scars around my wrists and ankles that remind me too much of rope burn scars, the implications as terrifying as the monstrous forms Andrew had taken.

There had never been an Andrew.

I try to tell myself that everyday. 

But I still have all of these amazing memories of someone who truly loved me and all of the memories we created together with friends.

When I have explained the memories I have of the time since I left the bar all those years ago, I have been told it was my mind trying to protect itself.

Creating an imaginary world where everything was perfect to shield me from the hell I was actually living.

Even as those memories begin to fade and I accept the reality that there never was an Andrew, I still miss him.

I loved Andrew.

He was my soul mate.

When I wake up drenched in sweat from the night terrors of that final hike, one thought still lingers.

What would have happened had I continued the fantasy with Andrew?

Would I have ever escaped?

Or would I still be…

*Sometimes he almost regretted getting his eyes fixed: pressing the heels of your hands to your eyes with a heavy sigh just didn’t have the same gravatis without peeling the glasses off first. He heard one of his fellow researchers turn his way. He could almost hear the smirk that had to be on the guy’s face. “New guy, huh? You got in… what… last week? I’ve been here three months already. Don’t worry, though, it gets worse. It gets a lot worse.”* 

*He almost stifled the growl that threatened to come up, but decided not to. He then spoke with his hands still pressed into his eyes. “It is* *impossible**. All of it: It is simple laws of quantum scale! You can’t have something that small hold – or produce – enough energy to move itself around, perform the sub-atomic gyrations required to be part of a calculation network, communicate with other nanites, AND manipulate the world around them. Simple physical limitations of atomic and sub-atomic structure limit you to two of those functions, at most, and that is IF you lock the things down where they can’t move! The Old Machines have to have other tricks up their computerized sleeves, there is no way nanites are able to do what these documents claim they do, much less form structures to project energy through space or slice directly at molecular bonds! There is no way half what I am reading is real, this is the stuff of the wildest science fantasy I have ever seen!”* 

*The voice chuckled a bit. “Oh, you think that is bad, wait until you see where the flaw has always been in our zero-point energy equations.”* 

“GOOD!” The word followed immediately after the *ka-shwing* sound of a tape-wrapped stick bouncing off Omsarch’s personal shield. Julia sat back and sipped her drink as she watched the two Roranarns square up to go at it again. She knew Narbil still didn’t like that the Humans insisted that the Roranar didn’t use real swords on one another for practice, but appreciated that Omsarch required them to do so… for the same reason that the Roranar Embassay forbid dueling practice between their own people. A Roranar generally survived anything short of having their head removed, but having a hand missing tended to impair typing speed. 

Of course, Omsarch was trying to get the policy in his own Embassy changed, with the advent of personal shields and all, but the incident with the severed leg despite a shield two years ago made that a bit of an uphill battle. 

*Still,* she thought to herself, *it seems rather obvious that was an isolated incident at this point. And, the advancements we have made from the Cache research have made the shields even better. I do hope Omsarch succeeds, it seems to mean a lot to him and his people at their Embassy…* 

The thought had an outside edge of regret. She had started spending more and more time with the Roranar, and inviting their delegations to dine with her more often. Some back home seemed to think her mad, but she found them to be delightful company and had a sense that they might be important in what was to come.

She'd found herself semi-consciously avoiding them of late, however, and trying to keep some distance herself, even as she pushed her staff to work more closely with them. It seemed that every interaction she had with any of them made her want, more and more, to either give up Evermal's secrets or storm down into The Nest and box the bird's feathered ears. Or both. In desperation, she'd pushed Kessler into working with their academics to have them dig around on the Roranar homeworlds.

The idea had been simple, and a long shot, but she'd hoped it might to have some sort of pay off even if it didn’t get what she wanted. That, if they dug deep enough or in just the right spot, they’d find something, even a single data crystal, that the Old Machines had missed. Then the Roranar could learn their history, or at least more of it, without the need for the Pinigra. 

Ultimately, however, it became clear that it would be a project of decades - maybe even centuries - rather than months or years, and she'd given up hope. Kessler had taken the bit in his teeth and continued to work with the Roranar, but he didn't know the real goal.

“Good!” Omsarch had landed a hit on his opponent this time. A flick of his eyes in her direction and she realized he’d noticed her watching. She actually did shake her head this time. *I am going to have to do something about this. Regularly inviting him and his fellows to our Embassy, but always being unavailable myself, is going to become a problem soon. If I didn’t feel guilty about holding Evermal’s secrets every time I was around them for five minutes…* 

She got up and moved to watch another bout, determined to have some hard words with a certain feathered friend. 

Her chance came two days later. Another interesting tidbit came in from The Cache – as everyone had started calling the asteroid left by a predecessor race – and someone told her that there was new math in the download having to do with FTL travel. She loaded the data on a crystal and took a somewhat more indirect route than usual to an elevator for the Nest, using the time to compose her arguments. 

Well, she intended to use the time to compose her arguments. By the time she arrived at the Nest she’d built a bit of a head of steam instead. She almost turned around and left, she knew better to go into a negation hot. *Not usually a good idea. Sometimes, though, a bit of steam can give you the push you need.* 

The ghost of a smile crept to her lips as the words from an old mentor came to her mind, then she tucked her chin and marched forward. 

Evermal stood in the entry way of the Next – a place that had become almost unrecognizable in the last two years as the Pinigra adapted it to themselves – and greeted her with the boisterous attitude he’d slowly adopted over as he got further from the regimentation of Pinigra society and the high role he played in it. 

The man’s feathered arms went wide and a large smile played out on his face. “Ahh! The illustrious Julia, my dear savior and benefactor, come with more interesting information from Academic sources, no doubt. Or, even better, more information gained from The Cache?” A far-off look came into Evermal’s eye. “I almost want to break cover and go join your researchers there. If I wasn’t sure that my cousin has some sort of spy in the place that would report back to him, I would. As it is, I’m tempted to go anyway and hope that he has decided I’m not worth assassinating anymore. 

“Given that you have already put some of the math I taught your kind to use in your FTL drives, I am sure he knows by now…” 

He finally seemed to catch her mood. His arms came down and his eyes narrowed. “I am tempted to ask, with concern, what has happened, but I have gotten better at reading Humans in general and you in particular. Something troubles you, in fact you seem downright angry. And, if I miss my guess, that ire is directed at me. 

“Whatever I seem to have done, I wish to apologize, I…” 

A sharp look cut him off, and she gave him a placating Pinigran hand-gesture in an attempt to lighten any sting from the rebuke. He drew himself up a little at the look, but nodded and gestured her to a private conference room while he grabbed pitchers of water and coffee. 

*He has come a long way. When he arrived here he’d have given orders for those pitchers to be carried in, private conference or no, and waited until the servicer left. Now he is willing to do it himself. No, not just willing, he does it without thought in an attempt to be a good host. We are rubbing off on him after all. Hopefully it is enough.* 

She was trying to mollify herself, grasping at straws to round off the edge of her ire a bit, despite her intent to use that same ire if needed. *A hard subject to approach, but it needs to be done. The Roranar deserve to know, and the researchers studying the Old Machine’s capabilities need to know. We have danced around this for years now, in the Pinigran way of doing things. Time to get to the point.* 

Evermal poured their drinks, grabbed his coffee, sat back in his chair, gestured for her to please sit, and looked at her expectantly when she did not. Instead, she somewhat negligently tossed her data crystal onto the table. “This data just got decoded from The Cache: I’m told it is new math for ways to increase FTL speed.” She shrugged, and began to pace a little. “I decided to bring it personally because it is important, and I know how much you love this stuff. That, and because you are right: I have an issue with you, and it needs to be addressed. 

“An issue that you and I have danced around for a year and a half now, one which you have hemmed and hawed on, put off, and tried to placate me over. Information you *need* to let me release, even if it means we lose control of it. As you have said, your Cousin surely knows that you are somewhere within League – probably Human – space, and is undoubtedly looking for you. The fact that he hasn’t found you means he probably won’t. “ 

She stopped moving, turned to face him, and allowed a little fire into her eyes. “So, it is time we talk about getting out of the way of information you have which might help our researchers looking into the Old Machines, and may even open whole new avenues of research.” 

Evermal slowly put down his coffee cup, which he hadn’t touched during the course of her speech. His face looked baffled, and everything in his posture spoke of confusion, even the smallest of his micro tells. *He really doesn’t know what I’m getting at. Even he doesn’t have that much control.* 

He took a moment to gather his thoughts, then turned eyes back to her. “I am not sure what it is that you feel I am holding back, Julia. I have enjoyed every conversation we have had, to the point that I started keeping notes just for the chance to review them. I have held nothing back from you…” 

A corner of her lip lifted before she could stop it, and he trailed off. *Get a grip on yourself woman!* She allowed only the slightest trace of heat into her voice. “I don’t argue that point. The problem is there are things you have bound me by oath to tell no one, and those things need to be known... with every revelation from The Cache, that becomes more and more evident. 

“You know that the cycles where the governments were open with their people handled the war best, and it is time that all the cards got placed on the table.” Evermal’s eye ridges drew down, and he looked at the table, his face still a mask of confusion. 

She sighed. “The Roranar, Evermal.” The words were met with a sharp intake of breath, and the man’s feathers rose across his whole body. She pressed on. “It is time they learned the rest of their history, and that the League learned the truth about the Old Machine’s Ultimate Sanction. That Sanction needs to be studied, and we…” 

Evermal closed his eyes, and leaned back in his chair with his face pointed toward the ceiling. At length, he answered. The words came out as if forced. “You are right, of course.” He gave a disturbingly Human sigh. “They deserve to know. In truth, they deserved to know a very long time ago, but what happened… what they did, and what we had to do. That ‘leaves a mark,’ as I believe you Humans say.

When I returned, I learned I was missing for 10 years.","Have you ever spent years of your life with someone just to find out none of it was real?

I had met Andrew when I was 22, working as a bartender for a shitty hole-in-the-wall bar. He was an incredibly outgoing individual that effortlessly brightened the day of anyone who was within fifteen feet of him. He had made the lonely closing shift of a dead Tuesday enjoyable and after I got off of work we met up for coffee and waffles at a nearby diner.

The chemistry we had was unlike anything I had ever experienced before and it wasn't long before we began dating. Andrew became my rock that I could always rely on to keep me grounded when the rest of the world was caught up in a squall of chaos. He embraced my love of b-movie horror and I accepted his enthusiasm for the outdoors after weeks of convincing on his part.

Andrew was the life of the party and while there were times that I just wanted to stay in and binge slasher movies, he would tease me for being a homebody and drag me out of the house to meet up with one of his Neverending swaths of social circles for bowling, Lazer Tag, House Parties, or his absolute favorite, The Late Night Hike through the forest that stood behind the shitty bar I had worked at when we met.

It had been a major milestone for me when I quit the bar six months after Andrew and I met. With his support and encouragement I started my own business in a niche field that I was actually passionate about. While the money isn't best, I love the work I do and even the worst days are still better than having to mop up bodily waste from someone who had too much to drink.

At a 40th Anniversary showing of *The Rocky Horror Picture Show*, Andrew proposed to me during the *Dammit, Janet* scene. His collection of friends, who had grown on me fast and became my friends as well, hooted and cheered for us and took us out for celebratory drinks after the show. Since that chance encounter two years previously, my life had become my own personal heaven. The work I did now was fulfilling, I had an amazing new group of friends, and I was now engaged to the best man I had ever met.

“Hey, I found the perfect place we should go for a nice picnic and hike.” Andrew told me as I was grabbing the last load of laundry from the ancient dryer in Andrew’s basement.

“I was hoping that we could just stay in for the day, Andy. Since I moved in, it feels like we have been going non-stop.” I replied, tired but not annoyed at the suggestion. After his proposal, I moved into Andrew’s two bedroom house. It was quaint but there always seemed to be another little project that needed to be tackled. With both of our work schedules, there never seemed to be enough time in the day to fix all of the little quirks the house had. 

“Oh, c’mon Christy,” He said, wrapping his arms around me and giving the side of my neck a kiss. “Wouldn’t it be nice to actually enjoy the three-day weekend we have to actually get out and have some personal time together.”

“Mmmm,” I moaned as his soft lips and blonde facial hair brushed against the side of my neck. “Alright, I guess it would be nice to spend time together, just the two of us.”

Despite moving in together, we hardly had any time to ourselves. The mass of friends were constantly inviting us over and out to celebrate the engagement and to offer help with planning the wedding. It had left us little time to ourselves and the chance to be alone in nature would be nice.

“This place we are going to has a nice little spring with a few nooks and crannies out of sight from the main trails.” Andrew informed me as he hurriedly threw supplies into his hiking bag, the mischievous look on his face made my face redden.

“Andy, you naughty boy.” I said before playfully swatting at his butt. He returned the gesture with a pinch of my own butt before tossing the bag over his shoulder and nearly dragging me to my car.

During the three hour drive to the national park that we would be hiking through I had dozed off, as we finally arrived Andrew woke me with an excited expression.

“Here we are, miles and miles of trails. A chance to really connect with nature.” He beamed with a smile that brought one to my own face.

“Where did you even hear about this place?” I asked, shaking the last of sleep from my eyes before sitting forward.

“Sam and Frankie were telling us about it the last time we went bowling, don’t you remember?”

“Not really, with all of the friends we have and ideas tossed around, it is hard to keep track of everything.”

“Lucky for you I have a steel cage for a mind,” He responded, lightly tapping his temple with a finger.

“More like a rusty bear trap,” I teased as I mocked a rusty trap closing with my hands.

We shared a laugh before he parked and we set out for our hike. Andrew had planned a long trek that would bring us back to the car a little before dark. I was glad I had worn an old outfit so that I wouldn't have to worry about getting covered in mud. When I asked about who would be doing the driving back home after we hiked all day and he eased my worry with the promise of a stay at the motel we had passed twenty minutes before we arrived. A place I would have seen had I not fallen asleep. With satisfaction at his call ahead and carefully laid plans, we set off into the forest for our day of just the two of us.

“Isn't that the same outfit you wore when we met?” Andrew asked, his eyes feasting up and down on my body.

“Yeah, I thought I'd just throw on some old clothes since you wanted to go on an intense hike,” I replied, snapping my fingers to get his attention. 

We both laughed as we ventured further down the trails.

An odd thing I noticed while we hiked was the strange absence of other people while we hiked.

“I thought you wanted time together not with a horde of others?” Andrew said as we stopped at the top of a cliff with an old picnic table for people to rest before beginning their descent towards the spring.

“Of course I want time without a ton of other people, I just think it is strange that we haven’t seen anyone else while we have been here. I mean it IS a holiday weekend, you would think we would have passed by some other wilderness enthusiast or gun-ho parents dragging their kids along to get away from technology for once in their life.”

“This is a pretty big place, we probably have passed by others but just didn’t notice them,” Andrew said as he sat his bag down on the table and stretched his arms. I smiled as he took off his shirt and stretched his taught form. I took a few steps towards him and gave him a peck before I spoke again. 

“Take a picture with me.” I said leaning against him and fishing my phone from my pocket.

As he wrapped an arm around me, I lifted the phone up and took a picture of us. As I went to take another, a large buck jumped out from behind a nearby tree, startling us both. In slow motion I watched as my phone leapt from my hands and down the cliffside to the unwelcoming arms below. With a faint crack from below, I could feel my heart drop to my stomach.

“Fuck, fuck, fuck, I dropped my fucking phone. That stupid fucking deer made me drop my phone. Goddammit I could kill that shitty fucking thing!” I yelled out in frustration.

“Woah there, I think you might have broken a commandment there,” Andrew said, placing a hand on my shoulder.

“I’m glad you think this is such a joke, Andrew.”

“I’m not trying to make a joke out of it. I am sure we will be able to recover any photos that are on your phone, plus it was old anyways. I'm pretty sure you have had the same phone since we met. I know you've been wanting to upgrade for a while but haven't really had a chance.” He said as diplomatically as he could.

We made our way down to where we were sure the phone had fallen and luckily we were able to find it. The phone had dived straight into the soft embrace of rocks and branches and the shattered screen was more than enough evidence of how useless it would be. Andrew pulled a plastic bag that had once contained trail mix and placed the destroyed phone inside before stashing it away in his hiking bag.

“First thing tomorrow, we will go and get you a brand new phone. The best one they got, even if it means I gotta sell a kidney to get it for you,” Andrew said, trying to cheer me up, obviously aware of my disappointment at losing the collection of memories of our life together that had been gathered on my phone.

We continued on towards the springs, crossing over an old wooden bridge that created and groaned with every step as we crossed over it. The entirety of the short time we spent crossing it, my whole body was on edge at the overwhelming sensation of the bridge threatening to collapse at any moment.

With the momentary hazard passed we found our way to a pleasant spring resting beside a cliffside. The gurgle of water leaking out and falling down onto the rocks below created a serene background besides the rustling wind and crunching of leaves and twigs as we approached it. 

Leaning forward, Andrew cupped his hand and brought a handful of spring water towards his mouth before sipping at it.

“Are you sure you should be drinking that?” I asked, thinking about what things could be contained in that water.

“You drink spring water that's bottled with millions of micro plastics in it, at least this is straight from the source,” Andrew said as he splashed his face with the spring water. 

“Y'know, there is a little overhang here that we could…” Andrew trailed off as he made a gesture with his hands.

“I'm not really feeling up to it. I am still irritated about dropping my phone and don't think I am in the right headspace for that,"" I said, noticing a momentary flash of rage cross Andrew's face before it shifted to an understanding look of disappointment.

“Well, you should at least try this water,” He gestured to the water as he spoke before glancing absently in the distance.

I tried a small sip of the water and the taste was heavy with a strange metallic taste. Just before I was about to comment, Andrew was already stepping off towards the trail.

When we approached another bridge, I insisted that Andrew lead the way as it spanked across a rather steep decline. After he proved the structural integrity of it, I began crossing for myself. Just as I made it halfway through, a horrid crack from the wood echoed through the air.

As I fell through the bridge, my hands stretched out to catch myself. The nails of my left hand dug into the wood before being ripped out as my weight jerked my body below. In the briefest of moments I looked out towards Andrew, a malicious smile greeted me as I tumbled towards the earth below and was embraced by darkness.

As I regained consciousness, I was greeted with the sight of a stag skull wrapping its long tongue around the bleeding fingers of my left hand. I screamed out in terror only to be greeted with Andrew's worried face gracefully holding my bandaged left hand.

“Thank God you're okay,” Andrew said, slowly setting my hand down and helping me sit forward. My clothes caked in dirt and a long tear down the right side of my jeans with scrapes and cuts leading to the missing shoe on my right foot.

I tried to reply but he hushed me to conserve my energy. He told me he was going to climb back up and try to call for help as he didn't have any signal where we were.

I tried to beg him to help me back up but he was already walking away before I could form the words. I raised my undamaged hand to my head and was greeted with a sharp pain on the side of my head and a small wet patch of blood.

Panic racing throughout my body, I forced myself to my feet. It felt like hours since Andrew had gone off for help and it was now well into the night. I stumbled my way through the overgrowth and began my slow ascent up the hillside back towards the trail.

Upon finally reaching the trail, surrounded in the darkness of night, I looked around for any trace of Andrew only to be greeted by silence. The sounds of wind or wildlife were missing and the only audible noise was my labored breathing and rapid heartbeat drumming in my ears.

Dragging my way back to the spring, I greedily drank from the water, ignoring the odd aftertaste. Glancing at a small pool of water at my feet, the shadowy reflection I saw was a skeletal form of myself. I turned away as tears filled my eyes. Pain rippled through my body as I shambled through the dark, my head swimming as my vision blurred.

“Christy! Where are you!” Andrew yelled out in the distance before he rounded a corner, coming into view.

Calling out for me in Andrew’s voice was an eight-foot monster. Legs bent backwards connected to a skeletal torso draped in baggy flesh that stretched and shifted to attempt to mimic the human form. The swollen and bulbous head had two antlers poking out as the mouth of broken teeth cluttered together in the attempt to form a smile as the thing hunched over to greet me. I was stunned into silent horror as the beast with Andrew’s voice reached out to me.

“You…hhhaaaadddd m-m-me-eee s-s-so-oo-oh wor-or-rree-reed,” The familiar voice struggled to say through gnarled teeth as charred hands wrapped around my wrists.

I yanked my hands back as adrenaline scattered my body away from the demented form. I ran away, heart pounding, panic and tears blurring my vision almost as much as the leaves and branches that smacked my face as I escaped in a direction that I hoped would lead to freedom. 

Atop the cliffside where I had dropped my phone, I paused long enough to catch my breath. Leaning against the picnic table was an old metal trekking pole with electrical tape wrapped around the worn out handle. I grabbed the ancient hiking stick and leaned against it before starting back out of the forest when Andrew pulled himself over the cliffside.

Without thinking, I brought the brass mud tip of the pole down onto Andrew's amorphous face, knocking a chunk of fleshy clay off in the process.

Andrew dropped to his knees with flakes of ash rising from his body. The blob of his head formed into a grainy recreation of the face I had stared into for countless hours since we met at the bar all those years ago.

“I…love…you…” spoken to me in a voice similar to that of an animal mimicking the words of a person. Smoke rose from the missing chunk in his head before his body fell into a confusing blend of shapes that I couldn't decipher.

Tears streaming from my eyes, I turned away from my fiancé and fled from the forest around me.

As I shuffled past the edge of the forest, I was greeted with the familiar sight of the bar I had met Andrew at so long ago. A small group of people smoking outside noticed me immediately and rushed over to me as I collapsed. The last of the adrenaline spent as safety from my living nightmare finally embraced me.

I had been missing for ten years.

On the magical night I had met Andrew and thought I had begun an amazing life with my soul mate, I had, in reality, closed the bar after an empty night and walked directly into the forest behind the bar in a trance-like state.

When my car was found the following morning by the bar owner, she called my phone to see if I was having car troubles the night before. When I didn't answer, she checked the security footage to find me walking off into the forest. Her concern heightened as the grainy video displayed a strange shadow figure at the edge of the trees seemingly luring me towards it.

For six months they searched the forest only to find my damaged phone and my lost shoe. The worst was assumed and my missing persons poster had circulated the state but after all these years I was assumed dead.

Miraculously, I had somehow survived, vastly malnourished at 70 pounds, patches of hair missing, several poorly healed scars littered my body. The worst of which were the scars around my wrists and ankles that remind me too much of rope burn scars, the implications as terrifying as the monstrous forms Andrew had taken.

There had never been an Andrew.

I try to tell myself that everyday. 

But I still have all of these amazing memories of someone who truly loved me and all of the memories we created together with friends.

When I have explained the memories I have of the time since I left the bar all those years ago, I have been told it was my mind trying to protect itself.

Creating an imaginary world where everything was perfect to shield me from the hell I was actually living.

Even as those memories begin to fade and I accept the reality that there never was an Andrew, I still miss him.

I loved Andrew.

He was my soul mate.

When I wake up drenched in sweat from the night terrors of that final hike, one thought still lingers.

What would have happened had I continued the fantasy with Andrew?

What finally clicked for me: motivation is a mood, not a plan. If I wait for it, I’ll never get anywhere.

So I started building tiny systems that don’t care how I feel:

* Gym clothes ready before bed → no thinking in the morning
* Write down ONE task for tomorrow → no overwhelm
* Quick walk outside before coffee → brain instantly wakes up

Even on “lazy” days, these little routines carry me through.

You get used to rooting for them, that you don’t want them to die. And if it gets popular, it affects the popularity of your show. 

Mr. Puzzles is worn out and they need to give him a break. He’s in jail. I personally think that bringing him back for redemption is lazy, especially with all he’s committed. Dragging him out is ‘milking’ guys.

And people mention SMG3, but atleast he actually changed his ways. He learnt to be vulnerable, open up a coffee shop, and not spent his mind 24/7 on SMG4. That’s how you redeem villains. You don’t wait 3 years to commit to this. Another issue is the fans of course, who are diehard for Mr. Puzzles and badly want him in the show. But keeping him in the spotlight everytime is boring. Even after Puzzlevision, people have said that they were tired of him. 

If your story is going to consist of the Villain being an evil mastermind, then stick with it! The crew should’ve never been able to defeat Puzzles. You made a tv entity, but he’s weak as hell. I’m not saying Mr. Puzzles is a bad character, but he is running his course. They need to move on.

English is not my first language so yeah….ChatGPT did its magic and helped. Sorry if my text reads “mechanic”.

Bit of a long shot, but worth asking!

Back in late August 2025 (last week) I was on a charter catamaran (Bali 4.1) out of Portisco, Sardinia. Our skipper told us we couldn’t sail up to La Maddalena because the weather/wind supposedly made it impossible. We always suspected that might have been an excuse rather than reality.

To settle this once and for all, I’d love to see if other sailing yachts or pleasure boats actually did make that trip between 24–27 August 2025.

I know MarineTraffic / FleetMon / VesselFinder Pro accounts allow you to do an area playback or historical AIS export, but since I only need this once, I really don’t want to buy a whole subscription.

👉 So my question is:

Does anyone here have access to one of these pro accounts and would be willing to pull a small extract (Portisco → La Maddalena, 24–27 Aug 2025)?

I don’t need vessel names or personal info, just proof that boats were on the move — even a screenshot of the playback would do.

Happy to cover a coffee/beer for your trouble. 🍺

Thanks in advance — I know it’s a bit of a niche ask, but maybe someone here is into AIS data or has a license already.

Welcome to our little corner of the internet where we celebrate ALL things Wheel of Time – and I mean ALL of them. Whether you're team ""Jordan's original vision is sacred"" or team ""give me Moiraine with a lightsaber,"" you've found your people.

Look, the books are amazing but let's be real – the Wheel has been turning for decades now, and it's picked up some pretty cool stuff along the way. Including a Prime series that gave us a Lan who isn't afraid to show emotions, and a well-thought out Moiraine and Siuan relationship. Super bummed it got cancelled. 

I have been fanning my despair with fanfics, although, I still haven't seen a fanfic where Mat becomes a food truck entrepreneur. Someone get on that. #joking. 

My point is, I thought would it be nice if there is judgment-free zone where you can gush about Rosamund Pike's Moiraine, share your theory about why Bela is obviously a Hero of the Horn, or debate whether that one fanfiction author who wrote 200k words about the Two Rivers agriculture system deserves a Pulitzer. Spoiler alert: they absolutely do.

So grab your favorite *angreal*, pour yourself some good Two Rivers ale (or coffee, we don't judge), and let's dive into every beautiful, chaotic, occasionally questionable iteration of this world we all fell in love with. 

The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills, and apparently it willed us a whole bunch of different ways to enjoy this story.

Worn wrong, they can drown your silhouette or come off as sloppy. Worn right, though? They’re the ultimate mix of comfort and streetwear energy.

[Streetwear vibes](https://preview.redd.it/vuwxrdzr3imf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=390ada5a43590f5b3a8d7d55962ad78dcb8bef7d)

This guide breaks down **7 easy styling hacks** to make baggy jeans your most versatile staple—whether you’re going for laid-back casual or elevated chic.

# Why Baggy Jeans Can Feel Tricky

The appeal is obvious—roomy comfort and that oversized Y2K vibe—but baggy jeans also test your styling skills:

* **Too much volume** can blur your shape.
* **Wrong footwear** can throw the proportions off.
* **Lazy layering** can make the fit look unfinished.

The good news? None of this means baggy jeans are “bad”—they just need balance. Here’s how to fix it.

# 7 Styling Hacks to Slay Baggy Jeans

# 1. Define Your Waist

Front-tuck a tee, cinch with a belt, or pair with a cropped jacket. Structure at the waist instantly balances the loose denim.

# 2. Choose Footwear Wisely

Low-profile sneakers, loafers, or sleek boots keep the proportions clean. Skip overly chunky shoes unless your top half has definition.

# 3. Layer With Structure

Pair baggy jeans with sharp outerwear—think blazers, trenches, or cropped jackets. It creates contrast and polish.

# 4. Balance Proportions

Mix fitted pieces like a slim tank, bodysuit, or tailored shirt with your baggy denim. Volume on volume works *sometimes*, but balance almost always wins.

# 5. Cuff the Hem

A clean cuff not only spotlights your shoes but also keeps the jeans from pooling at the ankle. Small tweak, big payoff.

# 6. Play With Textures

Mix denim with knits, crisp button-downs, or soft tees. It breaks up the monotony and adds dimension.

# 7. Accessorize With Intention

Structured bags, minimal jewelry, or statement belts instantly take baggy jeans from “weekend lazy” to “streetwear sharp.”

# Fit Formulas That Never Miss

* **The Campus Cool**: Oversized tee tucked + baggy jeans + crossbody bag + sneakers.
* **The Monochrome Match**: Neutral top + matching denim + sleek flats.
* **The Chill Sophisticate**: Baggy jeans + turtleneck + trench coat + loafers.
* **The Off-Duty Layer**: Cropped jacket + tee + baggy jeans + boots.

# Koredg Tip: Quality Matters

The secret to baggy jeans that actually look good? **Fabric and fit.** Sturdy denim with a clean fall will drape better and hold shape, making your outfit look intentional, not sloppy.

Explore Koredg’s curated [Bottoms Collection](https://koredg.in/collections/bottoms?utm_source=chatgpt.com) for denim and trousers designed to balance structure and comfort.

# Final Thoughts: Baggy Done Right

Baggy jeans aren’t just a trend—they’re a statement. Styled well, they’re versatile enough for coffee runs, campus days, and even smart-casual outings. It’s all about balance, proportion, and those finishing touches.

So next time you pull on your baggy jeans, remember: it’s not about hiding in the fabric—it’s about making the fit speak your vibe.",1,1756709724.0,Streetwearvibes,0,1.0,False

I had got a infestation at my house a Few months later bf offered his house and by then things cooled down and came back around but this time I don’t chill with her in the LR anymore I say hello when I come in and go in my bfs room with him or wait there till he comes home and say bye when I leave and she confronted me about why I don’t hang anymore and I told her what I saw her say and she said “ I wouldn’t think that would be a problem” just ignored my feelings but still to this day I keep that same boundary of just speaking once spoken to and being respectful when coming. But she still doesn’t like that she goes to my mom about it she tells her friends about my working situation by telling my boyfriend that her friends said since I’m not working to go get food stamps (I wfh) me And boyfriend has gotten into a argument he stopped contacting me for 2 days before and she asked why did I bring my siblings over whenever I came for my stuff she called me insecure I asked her why didn’t she answer the phone when I needed to come for my stuff she said “ if your boyfriend isn’t talking to you I’m not going to talk to you” which is bias bc she’s still in contact with his ex. Now me in him got into another argument in his room she comes in tells me to get my stuff and go home my Bf tells her no she comes at me asking again why I don’t talk to her I tell her I do and I tell her I come in the room and spend time with my bf bc that’s my boundaries and I’m keeping myself safe she ask for what and I said bc you’ve said hurtful things she ask what.

I’m really getting over it but she keeps talking about it to him since then (1 day) She told him she don’t like cleaning up behind us, he’s in love/lust so he don’t understand her she don’t allow him to talk to her like that so she’s not going to with anyone else, she said her brother cleans after himself when he stays and that I have a home and theirs isn’t it , she never liked me staying she only tolerated bc of my bf, mind you before she told me I could live with them when I wanted thank goodness I didn’t.

I had just started taking care of him and was having trouble coming up with a name the guy asked what’s his name and I gave him one that I actually settled on and she said “shes given him about 10 names you can name him what you want” but I let that slide.

1n5hni8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1n5hni8/just_say_youre_tired/,Just say youre tired.,"My (25nb) bf (25m) has had a really long day because of some stuff going on at his home. We dont live together, so he came over at my (dad's) place to hang out when we both got off of work. I could tell he was getting tired because his eyes were red and half lidded. He fell asleep mid conversation. Not a problem. What kind of got under my skin was when he woke up saying, ""what do you want to do now?"" I replied, ""well, I did ask you a question but you kinda dozed off in the middle of it."" He asked me to ask again, I asked, he fell asleep as he was about to answer. Fine. I started playing on my phone till he woke up again. I asked if he wanted me to make him some coffee. He said sure. I mentioned I had to use the bathroom, so he is welcome to take a nap on the couch since i would be a minute. He woke up as i came back with the coffee. He didn't reach for it or get up to switch seats with me. He said, ""we can switch whenever you want,"" and I didnt answer him because he laid back down and said ""this feels nice,"" and passed out. Woke up again briefly and asked what I wanted to watch. I said, ""im gonna put the trailer up for bullet train and I want you to tell me if you're interested or not."" He couldnt stay awake so I just let the tv go on standby and have been on my phone since. He woke up as the trailer ended. He looked at me then turned on his side and fell asleep. It's been over an hour since I came back with the coffee. I know he's tired but i wish he would just tell me that, or hell even ask me if he could nap for an hour or two. Not struggle the entire time he's here and acting like he isnt falling asleep. He's not allowed to stay the night here, but I'll cover for him to nap if he's so tired. I don't care to do that. I care about him copping an attitude with me because I mentioned he fell asleep. Like dude Im not going to kick you out because youre tired, but Im not going to try and cater to you when you cant even stay awake long enough to answer a question. 

He just woke up a second ago and asked, ""baby? Are you content with this?"" I wanted to tell him how I really felt but i know this the only safe space he feels right now. I told him that I was fine with it and that was it. He's asleep now but I feel like I've wasted the last 3 hours. Im bored asf and honestly kinda want to go lay down, but i dont want to send him off yet. Just sucks because he's gonna have to go in about an hour because he has to work later. 

I know he's grown an all but he really has been having a hard time as of late. I'm trying to be understanding and everything but I feel a lot of complex emotions right now and I can't fully place why.

I just wanted to get this off my chest. ",1,1756709338.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

I work hard, sure, but mostly so I can afford caffeine addictions, impulsive adventures/purchases, and sarcastic commentary that probably should’ve stayed in my head. Coffee, a camera, and sarcasm are basically my holy trinity. One keeps me awake, one catches the chaos, and one makes sure I don’t sound too sincere.

I’ve got tattoos and piercings. Because permanent needles in my skin seemed like a more productive coping mechanism than, you know, yoga. Game nights? I’ll win, gloat, and probably remind you about it a year later. Animals bring out my soft side, friends unleash the chaos, and boredom… yeah, it doesn’t survive around me.

So I made a shift: instead of adding, I focused on just one tiny habit each week:

* Drinking a full glass of water before my morning coffee
* Taking a moment’s slow breath before opening my laptop
* Writing a single line of gratitude before bed

These habits felt almost trivial but over time, they quietly anchored my days. They reminded me that calm can live in the small gestures, not grand gestures.

I once read in a soft weekly email called The Quiet Hustle a newsletter that isn’t about hustle culture but doing less with intention that progress doesn’t come from doing more, but from doing less mindfully. That stuck with me.

I was hesitant about this part because I smelled it and it had a smell at room temperature, but I just heated up water to see about it and it smells so strong. 

Not only is this unpleasant, I don’t trust that this isn’t going into the coffee to be both unhealthy and bad tasting. It makes contact with the liquid up at the top even though the glass tube goes inside of it. Can’t believe a 300$ coffee maker smells like chemicals, much less one that claims to be non toxic. I bought this in the US. I wonder if this part smells in the European version. I’ve been curious for a while about things that get certified non toxic in Europe and if they use the same materials in the US versions. I would genuinely be shocked if this gasket this passed.

I've started to accept more that intimacy isn't at the top of her list, theres so much going on in her head, im guessing there isnt the time and space for it, as i'm the only one that does any initiating my guess probably isn't far off. 
Our youngest is 2 so i get there is that to account for, her body has changed albeit only a bit in my eyes, but who is ever truly happy with their body or appearance, looks eh.... despite what I tell her and how i cop a little feel whenever I can, but am I being too much..... who knows.
I've tried sexting and flirting with her, the odd should a grow beard with my torso out, but nothing comes back, maybe I'm too much of a safe bet or again, its everything above.
Sex isnt regular, and often feels more her giving in than maybe wanting it, maybe I'm just being too sensitive, as it does make me feel unattractive in the main.

Because of work, kids and life in general OUR time starts at c.7:30/8:00 in which we typically grab a brew and watch tv for an hr before hitting the sack.
Its becoming more apparent that her natural way to unwind is doom scrolling, or looking at things for the kids and chatting with mates and work colleagues over the various platforms.... etc

Which i get it, you need your own head space.

I on the other hand feel a little neglected sat there, seeing this unfolding whilst watching tv.

I moved my life to be with her and changed jobs since so I can be closer to home and have a work pattern that allows me to have our kids on a friday.... which was driven by allowing her to go contracting... That said whilst I'm doing 5 days into 4 I've since been promoted so its not like I'm a down and outer, far from it.

To stop feeling this neglect, ive decided to go on the track of maybe we just see too much of each other in a daily grind kind of way, so ive taken up swimming again on a night and I'm going to change my gym routine to one on an evening, sounds petty but have a soak and listen to an audio book, rather than shower once the kids have gone to bed and sit downstairs and also go in the office more, just to break up what is now the norm.
Because I moved I haven't got my network round me so I cant all anyone for coffee somewhere so doing this I feel would also give me a bit of me time as well.

Hopefully the introduction of breaks, might make the heart grow a little fonder and hopefully there's more attention in us again and when we do see each other there's conversation and cuddling and intimacy.",1,1756708987.0,DeadBedrooms,5,1.0,False

English is my second language so I apologise for any mistakes. 

About 3 months ago due to my father (my parents are divorced) abandoning me and stealing a lot of money from me, I have been forced to move back in with my mother, with which I've been low contact for the past 2 years. 

At first everything was fine, she was really happy to play the role of a saviour and was overall pretty nice, however I knew this wouldn't last long. And I was right because over the past month the verbal abuse, belittling and the insane amounts of chores I need to do have only grown in volume. She demands I pay 'rent' which essentially translates to paying off all of her bills, she keeps scolding me for not doing the 'right' things, such as attending Uni and holding a full time job - both things that are impossible for me to do with my current responsibilities and health. She finds a way to make me feel guilty and small over everything. 

Now, I'm used to all of this and I can usually handle it by simply nodding along to her lectures and then hiding somewhere from her. Sadly, this is no longer an option. 

Because of my mother's complete lack of financial management skills, we've been forced to move into a smaller apartment. Both of my younger siblings get their own rooms but I don't and I need to share a room and a bed with my mom. It gets worse when her boyfriend comes over, because then I need to sleep on the corridor floor with our dog sharing a blanket. On top of that, now that we share a space nothing is truly mine and she repeatedly steals my clothes, my electronics, even my coffee cup, etc. currently I am also not allowed to leave the apartment because my mom didn't get the keys for the apartment building doors and I need to be home to let my family inside. 

I'm not going to lie, this is all driving me up the wall. I'm reaching a point were her behaviours are making me have intrusive thoughts of self-harm, something I have been clean off since I've been a teen. Do any of you have some coping mechanisms for dealing with this? I just need to find a way to process my anger in silence without getting her attention on me. 

The silver lining is that me and my boyfriend are planning to move in together early next year (currently we can't, because he is working abroad). I just need to somehow survive the rest of the year. ",3,1756708960.0,narcissisticparents,1,1.0,False

My social circle these days is my wife (amazing human – very cozy, very demure; we met on Tumblr... yknow, back when customizing your blog felt like building your own little universe), our dogs (great listeners, not ideal for philosophical debates), and our cats (loving company, endlessly entertaining).

If you overthink things like consciousness or why small talk exists, we might get along.

About me:

Lifelong Eastern Panhandle WV resident (plus a couple years in NJ and Virginia)

Definitely ADHD/autistic-brained, sometimes experience gender dysphoria, and get very self-conscious

Mental health work in progress... balancing social anxiety with a strong desire for deeper connection, wanting to be more active, and aiming for more “flow” and less rumination; still learning how to recharge without totally retreating.

Deeply committed to learning and self-education—especially about politics, current events, and expanding my worldview—always evolving and challenging myself

Just not a black-and-white thinker—nuance is everything, and conversations are way more interesting in those gray areas

Open to honest talk about anything, including drugs or tough topics—judgment-free zone here

Passionate about questioning traditions, why people do what they do, “what if” questions, and exploring new perspectives

Drawn to shows and music with real emotional journeys and authentic people

Love travel, geology, and soaking up nature in every form—weather, ocean, grass, rain, sun, day or night

NFL (Packers) and AEW fan

Enjoy creative/sandbox gaming and casual play

Huge foodie & sugar fiend—pizza, sandwiches, soups, Thai, Indian, cheese, tofu, jerky, any dessert, ice cream, soft pretzel, muffin, or cake I come across. I’m also always sampling new flavors of soda, energy drinks, coffee, and tea (especially in a fun bottle or can).

My little fur crew:

Dogs: Bayley (black lab), Lucy (black mouth cur), Lexi (black mouth cur)

Cats: Ozzy (grey tabby), Gracie (grey tabby), Arlo (orange tabby), Charlie (brown tabby), Apollo (brown tabby)
Every single one is their own brand of weird and wonderful, and I absolutely adore them—they make life way more fun, full stop.

Looking for:
Platonic friends (local or online): chill, honest, kind, and open-minded people; fans of playful tangents and “big idea” conversations; folks who genuinely appreciate constructive feedback and can roll with direct communication; people comfortable with honest talks about anything (including drug experiences, if it comes up); and friends who enjoy sharing favorite media, real connections, foodie finds, celebrating small wins, and exploring new perspectives.

Deal breakers:
Not progressive or bigoted; unkind, dishonest, can’t respect boundaries; looking for more than friendship.

**✓ Nuanced Words: **

• Sober vs Abstemious vs Temperate vs Moderate

While sober, abstemious, temperate, and moderate are all related to self-restraint, abstemious specifically means being sparing in eating and drinking, sober often refers to a lack of alcohol influence or a serious demeanor, temperate describes having moderate views or habits without excess, and moderate implies a middle ground, avoiding extremes in any action or opinion. 

Here's a breakdown of each term:

Abstemious:

Meaning: To take very little food or drink, particularly alcohol. 

Example: Someone who eats light meals and avoids strong drinks could be described as abstemious. 

Sober: 

Meaning (Alcohol): Not under the influence of alcohol. 

Meaning (Serious): Serious, thoughtful, and not overly emotional or excited. 

Example: ""The tragic event made everyone in the room sober"" or ""He was quite sober when he presented his findings"". 

Temperate:

Meaning: Mild, moderate, and avoiding extremes. It can also refer to a mild climate. 

Example: A temperate person has balanced views and doesn't get overly excited or upset, while a temperate diet involves moderation. 

Moderate:

Meaning: Having an average amount; not extreme. 
Example: A person with moderate political views, a moderate amount of alcohol, or a moderate lifestyle. 

Synonym: ""Sparing"" or ""temperate"" are often used as synonyms for moderation.

I’ve poured my heart, mind, and maybe too much coffee into a theory I call Simulation 2.2  full-length exploration (chapters, visual structure, the works) that ties together AI, consciousness, déjà vu, glitches, and the inevitability of superintelligence into one electrifying framework.

It’s not just a cool thought experiment. It’s a complete, living theory that explains why our history repeats, why school, bureaucracy, and culture feel like playlists on loop—and why mystical experiences, synchronicities, and glitches might be the system speaking to us.

Full text available in the link attached 
Big question for this community:
If consciousness is truly the final variable that even superintelligence can’t simulate, what does that mean for our role in reality? Are we the authors, the experiment, or something cosmic altogether?

I live in a medium sized city, and all the priests I’ve met seem extremely busy, and I feel like they don’t have the time to talk to me about the problems I’m having. I don’t come from a background of any religion, and I’m having a very hard time with church community. In the past, I mainly attended a Greek parish, which I liked because the folks there were really nice albeit confused why I was there as I am not Greek or Orthodox even though I told them I was inquiring into the faith. However, the Greekness that the parishioners and even the clergy were really big on made me feel less welcome, as I felt like church was being treated more about being Greek than about coming together in Christ. The Antiochian parish I attend now is actually mostly converts, which I thought would’ve been better, but I’m finding I cannot relate to them at all. I’m also in catechesis with some parishioners, and the way they interact is very evangelical to me. It feels like they are carrying over possibly traditions they grew up with, but as someone not raised even Protestant or Catholic or anything at all, it’s very off putting to me. Additionally, I am legally blind and autistic, and I am very independent as much as I can be. I try my best to just let those things be a part of me, not necessarily define me. But it’s these very overbearing formerly Protestant converts or people in my catechesis that seem to treat me like some kind of charity instead of an equal. I am not trying to lump all converts in the same basket or say that all Protestants are like this either, but I certainly didn’t have this experience with the cradle Orthodox people at my former Greek parish. I also get very overstimulated in large groups at coffee hour, as people are often very close together, and the room gets quite loud. So I usually quietly step out, and a lot of people will either follow me or question why I stepped out to get air, which makes me feel really bad for making people worry. I also cannot read any of the texts for Orthros or Divine Liturgy, and as a disabled person I never expect people to accommodate me lmao, but it just feels awkward when people hand me texts and ask me to help read at Orthros when I clearly cannot read what is written. And then when I try to apologize for not being able to contribute it feels so embarrassing. This is just me complaining at this point, but we have the technology nowadays to make these things an easy fix. Please ask your blind parishioner if they’d like an accessible text. And if you don’t have one made, we know the tools to make it possible. Just ask us, we won’t be offended. Please. We desperately need better accessibility in churches.

Anyway, I am a catechumen now at the Antiochian parish, so I’m worried about what would happen if I went back to the Greek parish. The Greek parish didn’t have a catechesis that works with my schedule, so I fear what I started would just come to an end. I know everyone is going to say talk to your priest, but both the Greek priest and Antiochian priest are extremely busy people, and I never get a word in the majority of the time. Emailing is no different. I know they have a lot of people and things to worry about, so I don’t think my experience matters that much. At this point, I don’t feel fully at home anywhere. I have also tried a Serbian parish and a ROCOR parish. Nothing is working. I am getting very tired. I feel like everyone around me sees me as some kind of non human they don’t even know how to interact normally with because I have a cane. I either get blatantly ignored or talked to like I’m a child or something. And the funny part is, most blind people are not fully blind. I can see people staring, and I can tell when someone says hi to absolutely everyone around me except me. I feel so alienated. I genuinely just cannot take it anymore.

I love Orthodoxy. I love Christ. I love so much about the faith and what we believe. And I do believe. And that’s what hurts so much. I want to feel like I belong when I know that being in church is essential. And yet I go home in tears all the time because I feel like I can’t participate normally. I so badly want this to work, but being in church, no matter where, makes me so anxious and unhappy. I feel so heartbroken. Everyday I go and hope I won’t feel like this, but it isn’t getting any better. I probably sound really annoying, but I appreciate anyone who gave this a read. Because I don’t know what else to do, and I am afraid I will give up on this journey. Please pray for me.",5,1756708430.0,OrthodoxChristianity,19,1.0,False

1n5h9m7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HollandAmerica/comments/1n5h9m7/grateful_for_your_advice_comments/,Grateful for your Advice & Comments,"We just got back from our **1st cruise ever,** yesterday.  I had a lot of anxiety about going.  Had not taken a vacation in **12 years**.  Mostly cuz I can't leave my dogs.  We bought a brand new RV just so we could travel with our dogs.  Didnt work out & sold it after 2 years.  That was my last trip - AZ, 2013.

Some of u told me to cancel our cruise but I'm glad we didn't.  I DO wish I had declared myself **handicapped** because I had a hard time with all the walking.  Wish I'd had a scooter.  I saw many scooters but I could see they'd be hard to navigate on a full ship to AK.  I had a cane but people weren't always accomodating.

I'm grateful I was told room service coffee was bad.  Tried it 1st morning & never again.  Our last night I brought a cup of coffee down from 9th floor to our room with 1/2 n 1/2 & sugar because I HAVE to have a coffee, & set it in nonfunctioning fridge (which I'd also been warned about).  Was worried it'd curdle in fridge & I'd get GI upset on long drive home.  Didn't happen.

Really missed my dog.  Didnt like where I had to leave him.  Vowed if I ever go again I'll go with daughter & leave husb with him.  Or find a better boarding facility.  Only had 2 mo notice to get everything ready.  He seems to have forgiven me.  Getting OFF the ship was a bit easier but all those ramps were hard.  I have COPD & got out of breath.  One Port lady told us to move but I said I had to catch my breath.   

**Loved live shows & talks about whales, Iditarod, shower pressure & toiletries, berry crepes on Lido, Ketchikan.  Juneau had FIVE cruise ships docked & it was like NYC trying to get around.  Diesel bus fumes in our faces.  Didn't get off any more stops except Ketchikan, which was doable.  Didnt want any side trips.  In it for the ride.  I don't like flying.  We figured AK would look much like WA & we were right.**  

  
**Didnt love crowds, ie getting on the ship, the chaos & exhaustion.  It was a total fuster cluck.  Never got room #.  When I looked for** it, I asked Google where on the ship 🚢 that was,  It said didnt exist. It *was* our room # & husb was told that we had to carry our own luggage to get room #.  We had to show passports FOUR times.  They were zippered away & hard to get out repeatedly.  Was sweating, tired, in pain by time we got to room.  It did exist.  

**Desserts looked good but were mostly dry & not tasty.  Choc tulip from Lindt was de-lish exception tho.   Would like a bouquet of those.  Also coconut tart.  Tasted like a macaroon. Hated that there was no coffee in room.  Room service coffee was horrid - like dirty sock dragged thru hot water.  I would pay extra to have a coffee maker in room & liquid coffee mate.  We went frugally & didnt get a beverage pkg.  I got so sick of their watery lemonade.**

**I'm grateful we had no mishaps, no one overboard, no need for dramamine, great weather.  Bought new jacket & hoody, never once wore them.  I run warm & packed too much.  Coulda travelled lighter** ***-*** **2 capris & 5 t-shirts*****.***  **We never dressed up.  Didnt even wear Orange because that party didn't start til 9.  Thought I would have a daily cocktail during Happy Hour.  Didn't enjoy that.  Noisy, crowded.  We sat in a corner & found ourselves surrounded by 16 people from India, gibbering away, drinking lavishly.  They kept pulling more chairs in for their group.  We encountered them again in World Theater when we sat down & they told us we had to move because their 16 were taking that row.** 

**Again, didn't love the crowds.  Met some nice people but more often than not, ones who bragged about all the cruises they'd been on.  Many came in groups.  Didn't want to include us in convo.  When they did, my husband became Mr. Social & I retreated to my thoughts & more desserts.**  

 **I booked this trip after watching all episodes of The**.**Cruise on YouTube.  But that ship was Royal Princess, not HAL.  They may have been showing off for cameras with meals & housekeeping.  We had a comfy bed.  But there was a stain on the chair.  Trimmings looked careworn, in need of work - crack in sink.  Fridge had 1/2 banana & 1/2 bottle wine left behind.  Towels were fluffy.**  

Again, glad we went.  Something on my bucket list.  Maybe a river cruise is more my speed?  Or one where u can bring your dog?  Heard Canard allows but think they are kept in onboard kennel?  Mine likes to cuddle.  And we are each others' Comfort Animal.

and being a science person all I could say was, it’s just a chemical reaction.

But then I wondered… is it only that?

Or is it something more?

When I try a hundred little things just to see your smile

When I take hours to make you a card, messy and imperfect,

knowing your laughter makes it worth a million times more than something I could buy, could that be love?

Maybe it’s in the gift I choose, not with my own eyes but trying to use yours,

never asking the price, only asking, ""Will it make you light up the minute you see it?"" is that love?

Maybe it’s in the struggle of making that perfect cup of coffee,

just because it’s yours.

When I want to tell you first every little thing that happens in my day, and listen fully,

to the little tales of yours. Maybe that’s love..

When I want to do chapad-chapad for my whole life with you, knowing half of the words don't matter,

but it's you that always does? maybe that’s love...

Maybe it’s when everything feels heavy,

but if you’re hurting, I drop it all just to be with you.

When time runs fast

hours shrinking into minutes with you,

and minutes stretching into days without you…

maybe that’s love..

Maybe it’s in the victories I share with you first,

before I tell anyone else.

Maybe it’s when I can show you the messy, unpolished parts of me, and still feel safe.

When you see me as something greater than I am,

like calling me “doctor” long before I’ve earned the degree

and then I actually want to become one,

just so your joke becomes the truth…

is it love?

Maybe love isn’t meant to be defined.

Maybe it’s only meant to be lived.

Maybe it’s nothing we can name,

and yet somehow, it becomes everything...

Lebanese Al-Akhbar newspaper: IDF soldiers and Israelis sat eating and drinking coffee in restaurants in Marja'youn and in Barj al-Maluk

A report this morning in the Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper claimed that 4 IDF soldiers in uniform entered the village of Barj al-Maluk (east of Beaufort), where they bought cups of coffee from the owner of a business (cafe) called ""Express"" (I deny any connection - A.A.).

In another case, Israelis in civilian clothes entered a restaurant in Marja'youn last week and at the end of the meal surprised the owner by asking to pay in shekels, and only then did it become clear that they were Israelis.

According to Al-Akhbar newspaper, Israelis move freely in Lebanon and the Lebanese army does nothing about it.
