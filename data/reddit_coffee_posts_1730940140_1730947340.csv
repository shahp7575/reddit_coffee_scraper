The thing is that we recently moved back to her home country, and she‚Äôs met with about a dozen of her old friends from high school, but I‚Äôve never met any of them. 

I‚Äôve been searching online and it seems like the answers on this are very split. 

Since the question says ‚Äúhave you‚Ä¶‚Äùand not ‚Äúyou or your spouse,‚Äù and also their ‚Äúbonds of affection‚Äù are only high school friends who meet once a year or so, so I feel like I can put no, but I don‚Äôt want it to cause issues down the line. 

On one hand I would think just play it safe, but on the other hand idk if they‚Äôre close enough to be comfortable sharing all of their personal information (they aren‚Äôt super close, they meet at coffee/tea shops in public, not each others house, etc) so don‚Äôt want to be intrusive if it‚Äôs not necessary. 

The other option would be to just put what info my wife already knows and check a whole lot of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù boxes, not sure how frowned upon that would be either.

Lately I have been struggling with providing emotional support for my partner and seeing my relationship from an unbiased perspective, so any insight is truly appreciated. 

My boyfriend and I have a healthy relationship. We have a history of toxic behavior patterns but we worked together to grow and transform them into healthy ones. I am sure of his love for me, and I truly love him as well. He is very loyal, supportive and kind. 

Over the past couple of months, however, I have been dreading having a conversation with him. I sometimes avoid asking him about his day, and I feel really guilty about this. He has been going through a tough time. He lost a family member he loved and lived with. He has made an investment in something and every day is an anxious roller coaster of ‚Äúwill it work out‚Äù or ‚Äúwill I lose everything‚Äù. 

I have tried several ways of being supportive. I listen, I always let him know I believe in him, and I offer my views when I think they are useful. 

Thankfully, I am in a good place in life right now. I struggled for several years back, and I built myself up emotionally and came to a stable position. 

What I struggle with is constantly having to worry about something. I can‚Äôt share the good parts of my day with him, and I feel guilty when I do something for myself (like grabbing coffee with a friend or having a good time). I also believe that he does not have sufficient coping skills, and in tough times I worry about him a lot. He yells, kicks and punches things and this is really scary for me. I try not to make things about myself but I feel my arms and legs go numb on these occasions. 

I feel like a terrible, selfish and disloyal partner when saying this but I just can‚Äôt deal with this anymore. Sometimes I wish he would break up or do something that would make my breaking up valid. I also feel disloyal and I don‚Äôt want to he someone who leaves when things get hard. 

I am very conflicted about this situation. I know I am in a very judge-able position, but I am desperate for some advice.

I'm so angry.

I want to yell¬†

and scream¬†

and kick

and punch¬†

and delete and BLOCK and mute

and ""HOW COULD YOU?! HOW DARE YOU?!""¬†

I want to enter their buildings and turn over the tables.¬†

I want to grab them by their man buns out of their three-row SUVs and empty-bedded Tacomas and swing them around until they come crashing down into their shelves of single-origin coffee beans.

I want to tear down their light fixtures, their LED walls, their smoke machines...

their drums, their guitars, their skinny jeans for middle aged men...

I spit at their Instagram stories with their perfectly processed photographs they pretend they don't know are being taken.

I rebuke their calls for peace and unity, for it's their callousness I need to protect my peace from and their unity that has divided us so.

Ten years later, and I'm still tumbling in the air after the rug was yanked from below the soles of my soul.

""But that's not what you taught me?""

""Wait, that doesn't sound like Him?""

""Oh (wiping away the tears so they don't see the utter devastation)... you don't actually believe it like you said?""

""Oh wow. If you're not the person I thought you were, then what do I do with the words you said?""

And on some level, I empathize.

In the same way OCD has me battle intrusive thoughts - punching at thin air - adrenaline on overdrive - they battle the notion of persecution where there is none - terrified of their own shadow, believing it's actually the shadow of one less fortunate.

""They're taking away our freedoms!,"" as smoke rises from the embers of others' after the Living Water is dashed upon them.

""They hate us!,"" as their pitchfork pierces the hopes and dreams of the refugee.

""They're stifling free speech!,"" they speak freely.

But it's just your own shadow.

It's just

your own

shadow.

How we all long to be out of the darkness of your shadow - as if our own shadows aren't dark enough to contend with.

Trust in God, you said.

Trust in God, I say.

Preach what you practice - I dare you.

For guest wireless, they purchased two Unifi access points but no controller. They will not have a system suitable for running the software controller, and they are unlikely to want ongoing proactive support.  

I need the least expensive option to run these access points.  I assume something like the Unifi Express would be a good choice, but we rarely sell or support Ubiquiti products for a few reasons. Unfortunately, this puts me outside my comfort zone, and I don't have much time to get this wrong and revisit the issue.  They open on Monday.  

I was initially told they purchased TP-Link APs but were unavailable for me to verify.  It was a wonderful surprise to walk in today and see the Ubiquiti APs on the counter. Ugh

I would appreciate some assistance. Price is a significant consideration. If there isn't a cost-effective option, I will choose a completely different solution from a product line with better support options.

I purchased a colonial style hose. The kitchen and living room area have these dark ceiling beams. I like them a lot, I think they go with the house. The ceiling is only 8'. I believe they will have to stay with any sort of redesign, unless you have a better idea, but it makes the two rooms flow together.

The previous owner painted the cabinets non-professionally. They look very tired in person. Not really the clean look we like but not sure what to do here. We added some cheap similar cabs in the corners as you can see next to the window in order to enlarge the working counter space and cabinet storage. That really helped with the size of the kitchen. The house is 3K sqft. so we thought making that whole area a kitchen space was needed. The countertops are cheap laminate and will definitely be changed.

We cut down a massive black walnut out of the side yard and are drying it for the wood right now. We planned to use it for countertops, and matching floating shelves over the two side runs. We were thinking of doing all countertops with this because we have over 300 board feet of gorgeous black walnut heartwood. Additionally, with the dark beams, it should make it flow together nicely.

The cabinets we got don't perfectly match the ones that were in the kitchen and are a different shade of white. 

We are trying for an English Countryside design theme. Our house is on a fairly wooded acre and is a saltbox colonial for context. We planned to put a small 2 person ""patio table"" type table in front of the little window for a breakfast / coffee spot. It's very pretty outside in the mornings.

House value is about 500k and I'd spend up to 100K+ to fully redesign the kitchen if it could be amazing. I know I won't ""get"" the value back out if I sell the house, This expense is just for my family and I to enjoy.

**QUESTIONS AS FOLLOWS:** 

1. Should we redesign this kitchen further, going down to the studs and moving everything around?

2. Would you agree we need to leave the dark beams?

3. Would you agree that using the black walnut from the yard will be cool to install as the countertops / shelves for the kitchen? Would you use that wood for all the countertops, or perhaps two different types of countertops like we set it up currently? Is black walnut even very pretty for kitchen counters? It doesn't seem super common even in designer kitchens.

4. Do you think all the cabinets should be replaced? Or professionally refinished to make them match?

5. Assuming we do  the dark walnut throughout on counter tops and 1 or 2 floating shelves above each side of the windows; 

5A. What color floor should we go with, we were originally partial to this cool dark floor we found. It would look good in our entryway as well. [https://imgur.com/a/zVnNXyU](https://imgur.com/a/zVnNXyU)  We aren't really into the white ceramic tile that came with the house.

5B. What color cabinets would look good in combination with the floor?

6. What should we do about the backsplash? The way it's currently set up, the cabinet that is closest to the living room has about 3 inches all the way up to the ceiling that is painted. If we did a waterfall marble backsplash or something, not sure how we could even get such a sliver up that high. Above the window cabinets, would you do the same backsplash up to the first or second shelf?

He mocked Shrutika with Salman's Victim card remark and then Denied it to her face. He accepted it only after he was cornered for his Lie.

Now, his Chor Chugli gang hid regular Tea packet and Vivian lied that he kept it in store room and Bigg Boss took it.

In front of him, Bagga was not eating anything since morning for his Tea. Still, he didnt have the humanity to make his gang of Chors to give him Tea.

Avinash had stolen some coffee too which Vivian knew and he made coffee out of it secretly.

Then, only when he needed his special french press in the night, he asked Avinash to return back the Tea and again Lied that he went for medical n requested Bigg Boss to give Tea and they gave it at his request.

Kitna besharam aadmi hai.  It is another thing that Bagga and Sara both called out his Lies and said that it was the same Tea packet they stole and hid the previous day and not any new packet.

Itna bada Bhukkad Chor aur Choron ka sardar hokar bhi Classist attitude dekho saale ki. Chahat ko cheap, disgusting bol raha tha.

None of the other Housemates are Thieves. Except these Four persons. Within four days, he and Avinash hid coffee. Even when Avinash was in Jail, he and Vivian stole a coffee bag and hid it.

Sara and Chahat only retaliated that too openly after 1 month of their nonstop Chori and to force them to give them their Tea bag.

As per Livefeed, Avinash was caught stealing Sugar free Stevia from ration too yesterday by Shrutika and Sara.

Woh Rajat ko bol raha tha ki ""Jab tu Jail mein tha toh equal Khana kyun nahi diya"". Accha, Jab Avinash Jail mein tha, tab khud luxury khana khakar baaki sabko 2 apples mein bhukh mitane ki justification de raha tha.",7,1730945864.0,biggboss,0,0.73,False

Rewarded searches typically pay 4 cents to 6 cents each. I have personally earned money from these searches or seen them mentioned from other Qmee users. In the past years there has been a trend of rewarded searches moving to sites like Ebay and Walmart. And some users are struggling to get wins from Bing or Google. There is a maximum of two wins per day. If you get two wins in the same day you will likely trigger a cooldown period where you don't earn from searches. Remember to follow all the Qmee rules and don't abuse the system. It is best to search for terms you are actually interested in.

From what you've shared, it sounds like there are several positive signs that your crush might be interested in you. Here‚Äôs what stands out:

1. Her younger sister teases her about you ‚Äì siblings often tease about people they sense someone has a crush on, which could mean she talks about you at home.


2. She asks you personal questions ‚Äì asking if you‚Äôve ever liked anyone suggests she might be curious about your feelings and relationship status, which often shows a level of personal interest.


3. Shared eye contact ‚Äì making eye contact during and outside conversations can be a sign of interest, especially if it happens repeatedly.


4. Mutual book recommendations ‚Äì she was quick to engage with your interests and recommendations, which shows she values your opinions and likes having a reason to connect.


5. Her thoughtful response on Instagram ‚Äì even though it was just a ‚Äúhaha‚Äù message, her pausing to change it to ‚Äúhahaha‚Äù could mean she cares about how she‚Äôs coming across to you.



Overall, her actions suggest she's open to getting closer to you and is possibly interested. Since you two already have a good dynamic, it could help to continue finding ways to talk and spend time together‚Äîmaybe suggest doing something fun like getting coffee or studying together. You could also keep building on shared interests to see how she responds.

She mentions that she got out of a serious relationship (like she was literally engaged) and so she's probably not ready for something serious.

A week or so into hanging out, we hook up. I go down on her and get nervous putting the condom on and go soft.

After the first month, I come over we hang out. She says I probably shouldn't sleep over cuz she's tired. On my way home she texts me that she doesn't think see this as a romantic relationship but more of a friendship. 

A bit passes and she warms up to me. We hang out increasingly frequently. Kissing, cuddling, holding hands. She kinda reduces radio contact. We hang out and she mentions that she's needs physical fulfillment and that I'm a really good guy and she's sorry that I'm not toxic enough. I mention that maybe we need space while she figures things out.

The whole week I'm dreading the appointed hang out time after the break.

It goes super well. She talked with her therapist about us and her therapist told her it's possibly because she trauma bonds rather than forming real relationships.

The next few weeks are amazing. We have great sex, go on a few dates. I tell her I love her and she even asks if I'll be her boyfriend.

I went with her to a Halloween party and introduced her to a few members of my family as my gf.

We were super flirty but the party the night before, in conjunction with a long day at work wore her down. All night I was craving being with her and in the morning she gave me the green light. 

Since we've been seeing each other, sex has been weird. Initially I thought it was from condoms as my last situationship and I were exclusive, she was on the pill so we didn't use them.

I'm like mostly hard, and she says it's okay but I tell her I'm ready. I finish and like definitely not my best showing. Think nothing of it. We have coffee and go out separate ways.

She calls me after work and we just kinda chat about our days. She mentions something her ex-husband and coparent did that made her mad. I say she's valid in that she set a boundary and he crossed it. I bring up religion as not being categorically bad in what I felt like was not didactic (I'm also not religious to be clear). I hang up as I have to shower and have plans.

She tells me that she was sorry for being crabby but also that I told her how to feel. Also that we should debrief about sex.

We chat the next day and everything seems a bit off but fine. I go over after work. We debrief on the conversation and I tell her I sometimes offer advice or opinions or have discussions when people need to be heard or validated and it's something I try to work on. We get that sorted. 

She and I talk about the sex thing and she reiterates it's really important to have good sexual chemistry but I'm a great partner otherwise. I kind of explain that part of my problem is that I get nervous about trying to please her but I will work on it because I really care for her. 

We chill on her couch, I hold her we have some wine, kiss goodbye and I head to house sit. She calls me to make sure that I made it and proceeds to say that we're in different places and she's not ready for a relationship and I try with all my might not to bargain and say that I don't need to be in a relationship I just like being with her. She says she needs time and I offer to give her space too.

I am crushed and just weep on the kitchen floor. Head back to my place. My aunt that I love with seems distraught about the election but I don't have bandwidth for it. I game with a friend. Lay down and cry myself to sleep, waking every so often in anxious panic.

I called in to work partially due to the election but largely because I can't get her off my mind. I check in with some of my fellow black friends. Cry a whole lot. And take allergy meds to try and catch up on sleep.

I know I need to give her space to figure things out but I can't help but feel like she really and truly likes me (could be toxic empathy but it feels real) and I can't shake the feeling that I need to make sure I've done everything in my power to see this to the end. I've never in my life felt so seen and loved but I also don't want to get hurt again.

It‚Äôs been a couple of weeks after the event, I‚Äôve processed what happen and now I need to vent. (FYI English is not my first language, so I apologize in advance for the mistakes I might make).
I 34f matched with this guy 49m on the fb couples thing, I recognize him bc I know two of his sisters and have seen him in their IGs, so I slide right. By the way, my profile said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just here to talk‚Äù, I‚Äôm not into one night stands and stuff like that, so when he texted ‚Äúwe should try being friends‚Äù I agreed.
While texting he said that he had seen me on a dance performance (I‚Äôve been a contemporary dancer since 4th grade and I still dance as a hobby), I asked him which one and he described one that I did when I was in 8th grade, he said that I looked very professional and that he felt like I was looking at him. Btw when I dance I dissociate, I DO NOT LOOK AT ANYONE EVER not even my parents when I was a kid, I‚Äôm an introvert so that‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôve managed to stay focused and do a good job on stage, but when we do certain movements like turns i was taught to look straight forward for technical purposes, I explain all of this to him and told him that maybe he just happened to be seated in front of me and he felt like I was looking at him but I definitively wasn‚Äôt. He also said that he envied his married friends because they are ‚Äújoint by the hip‚Äù with their wives and he was looking for someone to be like that with, I told him ‚Äúgood for you, I could never do that, I‚Äôm very independent‚Äù to which he replied ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôve never fallen in love‚Äù. He also told me about his band and that he had been on TV and touring several countries (I have never heard of this band nor care about his supposed fame) and about how religious (catholic) he was, meanwhile I told him about a demon I have tattooed in my entire abdomen hahahah we were so obviously incompatible but it was like he didn‚Äôt care, he just talked a lot, didn‚Äôt make a lot of questions, I think he was just very lonely and happy that he was getting attention, while I was just being friendly.

Fast forward to the meeting/date (bc at this point I was getting the hint that he liked me and did not wanted to be my friend), it was a coffee date and, for security reasons, I texted my male best friend who is a mean looking guy who works 2 blocks from the place I was meeting the dude, I told my friend I just needed a place to go that it was safe just in case the date went wrong, he agreed. I was planning to remind the guy that I was just interested in a friendship and I didn‚Äôt know how he was going to react.

I meet the dude and I honestly was expecting someone tall, because of the way he talked about his height, he even said he wasn‚Äôt as tall as giraffe but he was ok. Turns out he is shorter than me (I‚Äôm 5,2) and VERY awkward. We go inside this coffee place which is a place that people go to ‚Äúbe seen‚Äù, something I really don‚Äôt like bc I‚Äôm very private so I choose a table that was away from the huge windows that face the street. We seat and order, and he starts talking on the phone, sooo fucking rude! After the call ended he started to talk about my dance performance again, I told him ‚Äúbut we already talked about that‚Äù and he said ‚Äúis just that I didn‚Äôt tell you everything, when you looked at me, I felt like you were seducing me, I felt so attracted to you‚Äù I was in shock!! I reply to him ‚Äúdude! I was in 8th grade, I wasn‚Äôt seducing you, I wasn‚Äôt even looking at you!!!‚Äù And he saids ‚Äúoh right! I remember I was there to see my son perform in something‚Äù OMFG I felt disgusting!! And his phone rang again and he started talking again‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt care about anything anymore, I needed to get out of there so I texted my friend, he was about to leave work so we decided to meet on the way and carpool. I have never been so eager to leave a place, I paid for my coffee (bc in my country some guys think that bc they pay the check they are entitle to something else) and said good bye. I meet my friend and leave.

The guy did not take the hint, and I didn‚Äôt told him that I wasn‚Äôt interested in him bc I felt like I didn‚Äôt had a chance to do it, he was on the phone trying to sound important or being so disgusting that I could barely speak, so he kept texting me after meeting!! Tbh I think I should have blocked him faster but I really thought that if I just stopped replying he would stop texting, but he didn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt want to be mean or emotionally irresponsible but I was kinda scared of him at that point so when he send me a meme that was kinda sexual, I blocked him everywhere.

I‚Äôm honestly scared of the dude bc what kind of an adult man (he must have been 28 when this happened) finds a 13 y/o attractive ???? Plus I‚Äôm a mom and im out with my daughter a lot, so I really don‚Äôt want to run into him.
I must add that he doesn‚Äôt know where I live or work (thank god I‚Äôm freelance and do a lot from home), but I‚Äôm still concerned bc I don‚Äôt know how he took the hole blocking situation.
So AITA for blocking him without explanation? ",2,1730944240.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,1.0,False

A strange man approached a tavern in the middle of Cocklefoster South. But the way he approached was entirely different. ‚Äòcause he crawled, innit 

‚ÄúWhat can I serve you?‚Äù asked the bartender without looking up from his frosty glass and fish cloth. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a fish cloth?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was a typo but I‚Äôm going with it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, so what is it? A cloth made from fish scales?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, don‚Äôt be absurd. It‚Äôs just a fish cloth with a pattern of fishes on it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWoof!‚Äù said the man. He didn‚Äôt actually say that, he made a noise like a woof.

‚ÄúComing right up,‚Äù said the bartender. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only two people who know what a woof drink is. Me, and-‚Äú

‚ÄúGod,‚Äù said the man.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù sighed the bartender, ‚Äúperhaps you‚Äôre right. But disregarding God, there‚Äôs only two people who have-‚Äú

‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs so strange about this man then?‚Äù asked my mind. It was worried because my break was almost up and shooting stars never happen on Thursdays

‚ÄúOh dear lord we are *doomed!*‚Äù yelled the bartender. ‚ÄúQuick,‚Äù he shouted, ‚ÄúRing the alarm! Tell Berlin! Cover the doors and windows! Release the hounds! Pray to Jesus and his ripped abs! Pat a monkey on its belly! Tell Dr Dre nobody has forgotten about him! Let‚Äôs go!‚Äù

    Patrick O'Connor, a burly man with a heart as warm as Irish coffee, strolled through the bustling Temple Bar, his laughter booming like the nearby river after a pint or two. He was a local, a fixture in the neighborhood, known for his jovial spirit and the occasional loud outburst.
    
    ""Top o' the mornin' to ya, Patrick!"" greeted his mate, Sean, from across the street.
    
    Patrick's response was a hearty laugh that seemed to shake the nearby windows. ""Sean, me lad! How's the world treatin' ya?""
    
    As Patrick engaged in banter with Sean, a pair of strangers observed with intrigue. They were French tourists, Fran√ßois and Pierre, fresh off the plane and eager to explore the famed Irish hospitality.
    
    ""Regarde, Fran√ßois,"" Pierre whispered, his eyes wide. ""That man, he is... how do you say... exuberant?""
    
    Fran√ßois, a slender man with a carefully trimmed beard, nodded. ""Oui, quite the character. I believe the Irish are known for their lively spirits.""
    
    Unbeknownst to them, their quiet observation was about to take a dramatic turn.
    
    Patrick, in the midst of a story, suddenly pointed at the two Frenchmen. ""Look there, Sean! Tourists, eh? Let's show 'em some Irish warmth!""
    
    Before Fran√ßois and Pierre could react, Patrick's robust voice filled the air. ""Welcome, lads! First time in Dublin, is it?""
    
    Pierre, startled, let out a surprised gasp, ""Eek!""
    
    Fran√ßois, more composed, replied, ""Indeed, monsieur. We are eager to explore your beautiful city.""
    
    ""Beautiful, eh? Well, it's the people that make it so!"" Patrick slapped Fran√ßois on the back, nearly knocking him forward. ""And we Irish know how to enjoy life, just like our French cousins! We're all cocksuckers for a good time, am I right?""
    
    The moment Patrick's words landed, he realized his mistake. The laughter that had been bubbling in his throat died abruptly.
    
    Fran√ßois's eyes widened, and a mix of emotions played across his face. ""Pardon?""
    
    Pierre, misunderstanding the term, leaned forward with a grin. ""Oui, we are always up for a good time! But we did not know this expression, 'cocksuckers.' It is very... colorful, non?""
    
    Sean, standing nearby, burst into a fit of laughter, his shoulders shaking. ""Oh, Patrick, you've done it now!""
    
    Patrick's face flushed a deep crimson. ""I... uh... didn't mean... that is...""
    
    The Frenchmen's confusion turned to amusement, and their laughter rang out, mingling with Sean's.
    
    ""It seems we have much to learn about Irish culture,"" Fran√ßois said between laughs.
    
    Patrick, despite his embarrassment, found himself chuckling. ""Aye, seems I've put me foot in me mouth this time. Apologies, lads. It's just an expression, but I used it wrong.""
    
    Pierre's laughter softened into a smile. ""No need for apologies, my friend. We understand. It is a funny mistake, no?""
    
    
    
    The group, now united by this comical blunder, made their way to a nearby pub, The Merry Goat, its sign swinging gently in the afternoon breeze.
    
    Over pints of dark stout, Patrick explained the nuances of Irish slang, his voice a mix of humility and humor.
    
    ""So, 'cocksucker' isn't about... well, what you might've thought. It's more like saying someone's a good sport, up for a laugh. But I got carried away, I suppose.""
    
    Fran√ßois nodded, his eyes sparkling with newfound knowledge. ""Language is fascinating, is it not? How a single word can carry such different meanings. We have similar expressions in French, but this one, it is unique.""
    
    ""It's all about context,"" Sean added, raising his glass. ""And we Irish do love our colorful language.""
    
    The laughter that filled the pub was infectious, drawing curious glances from other patrons.
    
    ""You know, lads,"" Patrick said, a hint of seriousness creeping into his voice, ""we Irish have a reputation for our tongues, but it's not always fair. We're not all brawlers and loudmouths.""
    
    Fran√ßois waved his hand dismissively. ""We understand, Patrick. Stereotypes rarely capture the essence of a people. Just as not all Frenchmen are romantic or surrender easily.""
    
    ""Exactly!"" Patrick exclaimed, thumping the table, making the glasses dance. ""It's these misunderstandings that can cause trouble, but they can also bring us together.""
    
    
    
    As the afternoon sun slanted through the pub's windows, casting long shadows, the conversation deepened.
    
    ""Tell us, Patrick,"" Fran√ßois inquired, his voice gentle, ""what are the Irish truly like beneath the stereotypes?""
    
    Patrick took a moment, his eyes reflecting the memories. ""We're a passionate bunch, no doubt. Fiercely loyal, too. Family and friends mean the world to us. And we've a rich history, filled with struggle and triumph.""
    
    Pierre, his eyes glistening with interest, leaned forward. ""And what of your famous Irish wit? Is it true you can find humor in even the darkest times?""
    
    ""Ah, that we can,"" Sean interjected. ""It's our way of coping, I suppose. A good joke can lighten the heaviest burden.""
    
    The pub's atmosphere, warm and inviting, seemed to encourage honesty and connection.
    
    ""You see, lads,"" Patrick began, his voice earnest, ""we may be known for our drinking and our brawls, but there's more to us. We're poets and dreamers, fighters and lovers. We cherish our land and our heritage.""
    
    Fran√ßois nodded, his expression thoughtful. ""It is the same with us French. We, too, have a rich culture, often misunderstood. We value our art, our cuisine, and the joy of life.""
    
    ""Then we have more in common than meets the eye,"" Pierre added, raising his glass. ""To friendship and understanding!""
    
    The clink of glasses filled the air, accompanied by murmurs of agreement.
    
    
    
    As the evening deepened, the laughter and conversation flowed freely. The initial misunderstanding had evolved into a bond, a shared experience that transcended language barriers.
    
    ""I must say, lads,"" Patrick declared, his voice carrying above the pub's din, ""I never thought I'd be having pints with a couple of Frenchmen, but here we are! It's a grand evening.""
    
    Fran√ßois and Pierre, their faces glowing from the drink and camaraderie, smiled widely.
    
    ""It's been an honor, Patrick, Sean,"" Fran√ßois said, his voice sincere. ""You've shown us a side of Ireland we would not have discovered on our own.""
    
    ""And we've learned that beneath our differences,"" Pierre added, ""we share a love for life, laughter, and a good story.""
    
    The pub's patrons, caught up in the spirit of the moment, cheered, their voices blending into a joyful chorus.
    
    In that moment, amidst the clinking glasses and roaring laughter, a friendship was forged, proving that misunderstandings could be bridges to connection rather than barriers.
    
    
    
    The following days saw Patrick, Sean, Fran√ßois, and Pierre exploring Dublin together, their laughter ringing through the streets. The initial misconception had become a running joke, a shared secret that only strengthened their bond.
    
    As the Frenchmen prepared to depart, they exchanged heartfelt farewells with their new Irish friends.
    
    ""We'll return, of that you can be sure,"" Fran√ßois promised, his voice thick with emotion.
    
    ""And we'll be here, ready for more adventures,"" Patrick replied, his eyes glistening.
    
    
    
    In the heart of Dublin, where the Liffey's murmur echoes through cobbled streets, a story of unexpected camaraderie was about to unfold, born from a simple yet explosive misconception.

1glfa65,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1glfa65/how_to_validate_any_business_idea_before_building/,How to validate ANY business idea before building (and wasting time and money on it),"**Experienced Founder/ CEO here.**

My team and I have bootstrapped an education company from 5k to nearly $1M revenue in 2 years.  
But I've had some other business ideas that¬†**failed BIG time**.

This is what this post is about and how to avoid that failure.

So, I did try SaaS, even Dropshipping, Amazon FBA, and more.¬†**ALL failed.**

And i hope this post helps you to not do the same mistakes that i did when i asked myself ""what online business can i start?""

I've failed not because these models or ideas of business don't work - but because I've never¬†actually¬†**VALIDATED if there is actually real demand for this.**

I call this the classic rookie mistake for first time founders.  
And I've fallen into the trap multiple times tbh.¬†**(5x to be exact!)**

I've never talked to real breathing human beings one-to-one if they¬†**really**¬†**needed**¬†**this and would spend money on it**.

So I've blew money that i did not have, a lot of time and energy into a thing that i've build - but - surprise, surprise -nobody wanted it.

If you are thinking about starting something new I truthfully hope this will not happen to you - its really feels bad and fucks with your ability to think clearly!   
  
Now you know the pitfall!

**So what can we learn from this?**  
Whatever business model or market you pick, make sure you¬†**validate first**.

Validation is just a fancy word for making sure people are¬†**interested**¬†in something(your product/service) -¬†**before**¬†your building your product/service.

Let me say this again:

**Validate First.**  
**Build Second**

And we want to validate¬†**CHEAP**¬†and¬†**FAST**.

ok, but how we do that?

**Here's what the smart people do:**

Before spending a single dollar, create what I call a ""*Smoke Test*""

When plumbers fix pipes, they pump smoke through them first.

If there's a leak, you'll see the smoke before any water damage happens. - Easy.

And in business, it's the same concept:

You're testing for ""leaks"" in your business idea before pouring in real money (water)

**Example:**  
Let's say you wanna do a premium coffee delivery subscription service. Ok Great.

Instead of buying inventory and spending your 5k right away, you create a simple landing page that says  
""*Rare Premium Coffee Beans Delivered Monthly¬†to you home*¬†*-*¬†***Join the Waitlist***¬†""

There are¬†**2 ways**¬†to do that:

***You Spend Money:***  
*Now run $50 worth of Facebook ads to your target audience. (paid)*

*If your don't want to spend any*¬†***money***¬†*- you have to spend*¬†***time***.

***You Spend Time:***  
find your people online and tell them something like ""*hi, i'm thinking about to start a monthly Rare Coffee Beans Delivery -- would you be interested -*¬†***join the waitinglist***""

If 100 people view your page and nobody signs up - you've saved yourself $4,950. - happy days - good for you.

If 30-40 people join your waitlist - you've got¬†**proof of interest - and a business.**

This is exactly what Dropbox did - they made a video showing their ""product"" before writing a single line of code. Or a more recent example is Elon Musk and his Cybertruck.

Dropbox collected 75,000+ email addresses overnight.¬†**(and they did not even wrote a single line of code yet)**

Elon Musk collected idk how many emails + 100millions deposits of people overnight. (and he did not build a sigle truck yet)

That's validation for¬†**true**¬†**demand**.

So all we do is simply and cheaply collect signs of interest before we get moving.

I was wondering if anyone had any advice for me. Sorry for the long post.

I have had pretty severe physical anxiety for around 10 years. At first, I would only experience it when I was performing as an actor. I would get very shaky, to the point where it felt like my whole body was vibrating, and I could not keep my head steady or breathe correctly. For the first 7 or so years, this would only happen during auditions when I felt a lot of pressure to do well. Throughout the entire 10 years I have felt a very tight feeling in my gut that sort of just hangs out with me, I‚Äôve gotten used to it for the most part. 

Things took a bit of a turn 3 years ago after some very stressful events in my life. I started to feel that shakiness from the moment I woke up to the time I went to sleep. I get these uncontrollable twicthes in my legs and hands, almost like a jolt. When I try to sleep, I often wake myself up by jolting awake due to the feeling of falling. I often kick and twitch in my sleep.

Doctors and psychiatrists have prescribed me various things ranging from weak to very strong to no avail. Psychologists and therapists reference the trauma that your body holds onto and needing to release it, but without clear guidance on how to do that. I am physically healthy, my blood tests come back fine. 

My approach has been to pull myself up by my bootstraps and try everything I can think of from daily meditation, to breathwork, yoga, journalling, quitting coffee, etc. but I am still stuck with whatever is going on. 

All of this has been slowly ruining my relationship, my self-confidence, and the sense that I am in control of my own body. 

Any advice, anecdotal or concrete would be so greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading üôèüèº",1,1730943804.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

1glf842,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1glf842/marriage_advice_42f_52m/,"Marriage Advice ? 42F, 52M","Hey, I am looking for feedback on whether my expectations are ridiculous or not.  After several bad relationships I am wondering if it is me.  My husband and I have been together 8 years.  We were both previously married with children in early 20‚Äôs as well as my 2 young teenagers. He has a history of lying to me, from serious things like cheating on his ex to inconsequential things like whether he went out to lunch or met his daughter for a coffee.  I explained that honesty and being upfront is very important to me in the very beginning because of past experiences.  Each time he cries and swears he will do better.  He says he doesn‚Äôt know why he does it and he just doesn‚Äôt want to upset me.  I am in no way a person who gets unnecessarily upset with him.  I want him to be happy and do what he pleases (so long as it doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone) so it‚Äôs not as if I get mad at him for doing the things he is dishonest about.  He does not just lie to me. He has lied to his child and pretended he was not on vacation with my children and I, although his kids were invited too.

Unfortunately, this is not the only issue.  He also pouts and is very passive aggressive, especially when we are doing something he doesn‚Äôt really want (i.e. go to a concert of my favorite band, visit my family for holidays, decorate the christmas tree, etc).  I am always suggesting he just doesn‚Äôt participate in the activities that clearly make him so miserable but he insists on going and taking the fun out of it.  He rolls his eyes, overreacts and acts like a victim when his family is around and I am over it.  I cannot communicate my feelings and thoughts any more clearly.  Seriously, a 3 year old would have understood by now.  I guess my question is Are there actually people out there that will  be open and honest and stick up for their partner in a relationship or is this as good as it gets?  I realize he is manipulating me but there are also good things about him (obviously, right?)  and divorce is terrible.  Do not recommend it.  How important is honesty to you guys and am I justified in feeling hurt by this happening consistently?  Like weekly that I know of.  I am not digging, just the things I run into‚Ä¶. Which begs the question, what lies aren‚Äôt I finding out about?

Thanks

I have an appointment scheduled for Friday morning. I cannot afford an emergency vet trip, I‚Äôve called around and asked about deposits/payment plans. I have to wait until I get paid* 

My (previously stray) new cat is vomiting blood. I woke up to a large amount of puked up food, soft and digested. I found a few spots of bile, then a puddle of light red, watery vomit shorty after. 
 
This cat has been hanging around outside of my apartment building for months. This weekend, we had an onslaught of storms/tornadoes in my area and I worried about him the entire time. I found him Monday night soaking wet from the rain and temps outside were finally dropping, so I scooped him up and brought him inside. 

I fed him a can of wet food that night. I‚Äôve been feeding him this wet food whenever I see him outside for weeks now (I‚Äôve been planning on taking him in for awhile lol)

1 - the only difference this time, I drizzled salmon oil for cats on one half of the food
2 - he typically inhales the food on the spot when I give it to him outside, but inside he was a bit more peckish. Considering the circumstances, I didn‚Äôt think much of it. 

I have a cat of my own already but the two have not interacted in any way. They briefly saw each other when I brought the new one in, but I quickly moved my guy and his food & water bowls into my room. New cat was cool for the first night. He‚Äôs super vocal, but he acted like that while outside as well. He pooped and peed in the litter box overnight. I scooped it out before moving the box to my room for my other cat to use. After that, I got a new, temporary litter box for him to use until they meet. 

First full day of having him - I gave him another plate of wet food, half drizzled with salmon oil, and a bowl of dry food. I wanted him to have options lol. Once again, he ate but not that much. He seemed fine, he slept on my couch and floor out in the open all day. I did use Burt‚Äôs Bees sensitive cat wipes to wipe him off for my own sanity, but nothing else. I did not clean or use any other chemicals that could have affected him this day either. 


The next morning, I woke up to the vomit. Like I said, a very large pile of digested food, followed by bile and a puddle of watery red vomit. Because he‚Äôs new, I can‚Äôt really say what‚Äôs normal or abnormal behavior. But he never hid or cowered away like I‚Äôve seen sick cats do before. He puked a few more times, the results going from light red and watery to darker red (not coffee grounds dark) and slightly thicker. Most happened that morning, but he puked once more this evening. He‚Äôs been sleeping all day otherwise. 

I checked his gums. His breathing seems normal, maybe a bit fast if anything. The last blood vomit smelled terrible. I hadn‚Äôt noticed that before.  He‚Äôs now asleep on my desk directly in front of me.

I know he needs a vet and I‚Äôve made the appt, but I simply cannot afford going in until I get paid on Friday. I‚Äôve called around, I‚Äôve talked to multiple vets near me about costs. That‚Äôs just that. If anyone has experienced this, has any advice, any tips on what to do to make him more comfortable in the meantime, literally anything, etc. Please let me know.

My team and I have bootstrapped an education company from 5k to nearly $1M revenue in 2 years.  
But I've had some other business ideas that **failed BIG time**.   
  
This is what this post is about and how to avoid that failure.  
  
So, I did try SaaS, even Dropshipping, Amazon FBA, and more. **ALL failed.**

And i hope this post helps you to not do the same mistakes that i did when i asked myself ""what online business can i start?""

I've failed not because these models or ideas of business don't work - but because I've never¬†actually **VALIDATED if there is actually real demand for this.**

I call this the classic rookie mistake for first time founders.   
And I've fallen into the trap multiple times tbh. **(5x to be exact!)**

I've never talked to real breathing human beings one-to-one if they¬†**really**¬†**needed**¬†**this and would spend money on it**.

So I've blew money that i did not have, a lot of time and energy into a thing that i've build - but - surprise, surprise -nobody wanted it.   
  
However is reading this thinking about starting something new I truthfully hope this will not happen to you - now you know this pitfall!

**So what can we learn from this?**  
Whatever business model or market you pick, make sure you¬†**validate first**.

Validation is just a fancy word for making sure people are¬†**interested**¬†in something(your product/service) -¬†**before**¬†your building your product/service.

Let me say this again:

**Validate First.**  
**Build Second**

And we want to validate¬†**CHEAP**¬†and¬†**FAST**.

ok, but how we do that?

**Here's what the smart people do:**

Before spending a single dollar, create what I call a ""*Smoke Test*""

When plumbers fix pipes, they pump smoke through them first.

If there's a leak, you'll see the smoke before any water damage happens. - Easy. 

And in business, it's the same concept:

You're testing for ""leaks"" in your business idea before pouring in real money (water)

**Example:**  
Let's say you wanna do a premium coffee delivery subscription service. Ok Great.

Instead of buying inventory and spending your 5k right away, you create a simple landing page that says  
""*Rare Premium Coffee Beans Delivered Monthly¬†to you home* *-*¬†***Join the Waitlist*** ""

There are¬†**2 ways**¬†to do that:

***You Spend Money:***  
*Now run $50 worth of Facebook ads to your target audience. (paid)*  
  
*If your don't want to spend any*¬†***money***¬†*- you have to spend*¬†***time***.

***You Spend Time:***  
find your people online and tell them something like ""*hi, i'm thinking about to start a monthly Rare Coffee Beans Delivery -- would you be interested -* ***join the waitinglist***""

If 100 people view your page and nobody signs up - you've saved yourself $4,950. - happy days -  good for you.

If 30-40 people join your waitlist - you've got¬†**proof of interest - and a business.**

This is exactly what Dropbox did - they made a video showing their ""product"" before writing a single line of code. Or a more recent example is Elon Musk and his Cybertruck.

Dropbox collected 75,000+ email addresses overnight. **(and they did not even wrote a single line of code yet)**

Elon Musk collected idk how many emails + 100millions deposits of people overnight. (and he did not build a sigle truck yet)

That's validation for¬†**true**¬†**demand**.

So all we do is simply and cheaply collect signs of interest before we get moving.

I feel like a lot pf people are missing this step.

Emma nodded, feeling a mix of relief and curiosity. They listed out everything they both managed‚Äîfrom laundry to meal prep, from grocery shopping to managing finances‚Äîand realized that splitting up the workload could help them support each other better.

The cracked pavement and graffiti on the walls hint at the sinister vibe of the area, but you take it all in stride. It‚Äôs not like you have a choice.

2. **RC Retention Issues**: I keep forgetting info by the end of each paragraph, so I have to re-read after each question constantly. Highlighting distracts me. Any tips to retain info without getting sidetracked and  to not go back to the passage after each question?

3. **Getting Unstuck**: I often lose time getting stuck on tough questions (LR and RC passages). Should I shift time from easier sections to harder ones, or keep a strict time limit? 

4. **Energy + Focus**: I‚Äôll have snacks and Red Bull/coffee, but any snack or stamina tips? What helped you stay sharp and fight off mental fatigue during the exam?",4,1730943276.0,LSAT,4,1.0,False

I recently discovered Mounjaro and I'm more interested in it than other similar medications. I understand it's not a silver bullet and won't work miracles. I'm hoping to get your views or advice on my specific case, or for you to correct me if I'm wrong.

As far as I understand, all of these medications basically reduce appetite, making it easier to eat less. People say they can forget about thinking about food, so it's easy to lose weight. I get that, but what if my eating habits are quite unusual and I already usually forget to eat during the daytime?

I work from home, sitting at my PC for 12-16hrs a day, have 3-7 coffees a day, and spend my afternoons and evenings with my child.  I usually don't eat my first meal of the day until they go to bed, around 7-9 PM. Some quick, cooked food or sandwich, followed by some snacks ‚Äî not always healthy ‚Äî but I don't eat anything after 10 PM and go to bed around 2-3 AM. I should lose around 30-35kg of my weight.

Here's the thing: I don't feel hungry before late evening. I've never been a breakfast person in my life, and even if I wanted to start now, I couldn't. I tried. :) Always had late lunches, so my eating schedule just gradually shifted later and later until it's reached this point.

My dilemma is that a medication that affects my appetite, based on my reading, might not make much difference.  
So, I'm asking for your thoughts and views. What do you think? Should I give it a chance?",1,1730943214.0,mounjarouk,0,1.0,False

I also have Ulcerative Colitis so sometimes I am just not hungry because my system is inflamed and doesn't send signals for food. 

My question is: can I do this coffee in the morning to lose weight and consider it ""dirty fasting"" since I am having Silk almond creamer in my coffee which has 25 cals per teaspoon?  Then I won't eat until dinner since I have no appetite all day? 

I know this takes me out of ""Fat burning zone/autophagy"" and all that(Yes i've read all the books about IF), but if my overall calories are lower due to the lack of other food in that window, can I still get to my goal? Or does the sugar in the creamer just ruin it all for me? And no, I'm not going to black coffee. Tried it and hate it and will not be pursuing it again. 

I do know how to track calories and am trying to be more consistent with that now. 

Thanks for any advice!

It started after a night of drinking and since then my life has been such a whirl wind.
Multiple doctor visits. Emergency room visits. Changes in diet. Internet searches. Everything. 
Lots of blood tests and urine tests and scopes. 
Nothing was found.



I reached out to a close friend who had stomach issues his whole life. He told me I had to heal my gut. So I changed to a low fodmap diet. It did wonders for me. It literally fixed me. 
I was normal. Finally. Still sticking to the diet. But normal! And no cheating. No coffee, chocolate, alcohol. Literally nothing. Just eating tons of protein. And I got back to my normal weight and was feeling great again. I was so thankful.

Until now,
Since 5 days ago it started coming on slowly and now it‚Äôs like pretty much back and I‚Äôm so defeated. The burning in my abdomen is back every time I eat. Even after my protein shakes I feel it. I‚Äôve made an appointment to see my doctor for Monday which I plan on asking for an ultrasound. 

Even when I was getting better I was still not satisfied because nobody put a name to what I was feeling. It just seemed to have subsided. Which I thought was due to my diet changes and eating habits I‚Äôd adopted.
But those don‚Äôt matter. Cus they‚Äôre happening now even with all the things I‚Äôve eliminated. 
So I‚Äôm at a loss now. And it‚Äôs been progressive.

1glesmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDmeds/comments/1glesmg/low_dose_ritalin_the_sweet_spot_for_me/,Low dose Ritalin = the sweet spot for me ,"Hi Lovelies. This is my first post (that‚Äôs not a comment) so bear with me! I guess this is for people, like me, who have had issues with emotional blunting, zoning out and loss of motivation on ADHD meds (in my case Ritalin). I am a late diagnosed female on my fifties. My psychiatrist gave me a script for a hundred Ritalin IR 10mg tablets and suggested a titration path to eventually 60mg - with a 3x daily schedule - and  from that choose a ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù where benefits were good and any side effects tolerable. I kept experimenting, but every time I went higher than a 10mg dose at a time, I found large parts of my day I felt floaty, and no longer in touch with any enthusiasm or energy in my body. Not depressed, just out of it. Everything felt like it was in slow motion and while I could focus, what happened was hyper-focus was amplified. Like I was transfixed. So I would spend way too long on a single task and have a ‚Äúloss of time‚Äù period that was actually quite distressing and disorienting. The qualities I value about myself are my vibrancy, zest, humour and empathy and at those higher dose , each time I tried to titrate up, these totally got wiped from me. Those qualities are what drive the creative work I do (I play to all my ADHD strengths) Obviously I asked myself whether this is a dosage or meds issue, and I am seeing my psych again in a few weeks. However I am a very embodied person and I wanted to see what would happen if I went with my gut feeling that having a small dose more often would provide the optimal effect - enhanced executive functioning, deal with the impulsivity and distractibility and feeling of overwhelm over all the possible things I might do in this one moment (!) and an adult- long problem with daytime sleepiness (linked to a chronic condition). I have found that by cutting the tablets into halves and quarters, and adding medicinal coffee shots, I can have an even flow of clear energy all day, get things done with a new feeling of confidence and self trust, and stay completely awake.  No more brain fog. Great nights sleep.  No side effects at all and I have got my vibe and lust for life back. So basically I am doing increments of either 5mg or 2.5mg every few hours (guided by my body and demands of the day, whether I am going out in the evening and need a boost etc). My auditory sensory issues disappear when medicated at this dose too. I still have energy and adrenaline - whereas on the higher doses I couldn‚Äôt even do an effective workout. Just low energy. A stoned, ‚Äútoo calm‚Äù feeling. Looking back I realise I have always been medicine-sensitive across all medicines ever taken. I guess I am posting this for people who may be struggling with the same issues or to find out whether there are others thriving on micro-dosing Ritalin IR? Btw, it is no issue to me to remember to take it. I work from home. It‚Äôs right there on my desk next to my numerous water bottles! ",4,1730942421.0,ADHDmeds,0,1.0,False

    In the heart of Dublin, where the Liffey's murmur echoes through cobbled streets, a story of unexpected camaraderie was about to unfold, born from a simple yet explosive misconception.
    
    
    
    Patrick O'Connor, a burly man with a heart as warm as Irish coffee, strolled through the bustling Temple Bar, his laughter booming like the nearby river after a pint or two. He was a local, a fixture in the neighborhood, known for his jovial spirit and the occasional loud outburst.
    
    ""Top o' the mornin' to ya, Patrick!"" greeted his mate, Sean, from across the street.
    
    Patrick's response was a hearty laugh that seemed to shake the nearby windows. ""Sean, me lad! How's the world treatin' ya?""
    
    As Patrick engaged in banter with Sean, a pair of strangers observed with intrigue. They were French tourists, Fran√ßois and Pierre, fresh off the plane and eager to explore the famed Irish hospitality.
    
    ""Regarde, Fran√ßois,"" Pierre whispered, his eyes wide. ""That man, he is... how do you say... exuberant?""
    
    Fran√ßois, a slender man with a carefully trimmed beard, nodded. ""Oui, quite the character. I believe the Irish are known for their lively spirits.""
    
    Unbeknownst to them, their quiet observation was about to take a dramatic turn.
    
    Patrick, in the midst of a story, suddenly pointed at the two Frenchmen. ""Look there, Sean! Tourists, eh? Let's show 'em some Irish warmth!""
    
    Before Fran√ßois and Pierre could react, Patrick's robust voice filled the air. ""Welcome, lads! First time in Dublin, is it?""
    
    Pierre, startled, let out a surprised gasp, ""Eek!""
    
    Fran√ßois, more composed, replied, ""Indeed, monsieur. We are eager to explore your beautiful city.""
    
    ""Beautiful, eh? Well, it's the people that make it so!"" Patrick slapped Fran√ßois on the back, nearly knocking him forward. ""And we Irish know how to enjoy life, just like our French cousins! We're all cocksuckers for a good time, am I right?""
    
    The moment Patrick's words landed, he realized his mistake. The laughter that had been bubbling in his throat died abruptly.
    
    Fran√ßois's eyes widened, and a mix of emotions played across his face. ""Pardon?""
    
    Pierre, misunderstanding the term, leaned forward with a grin. ""Oui, we are always up for a good time! But we did not know this expression, 'cocksuckers.' It is very... colorful, non?""
    
    Sean, standing nearby, burst into a fit of laughter, his shoulders shaking. ""Oh, Patrick, you've done it now!""
    
    Patrick's face flushed a deep crimson. ""I... uh... didn't mean... that is...""
    
    The Frenchmen's confusion turned to amusement, and their laughter rang out, mingling with Sean's.
    
    ""It seems we have much to learn about Irish culture,"" Fran√ßois said between laughs.
    
    Patrick, despite his embarrassment, found himself chuckling. ""Aye, seems I've put me foot in me mouth this time. Apologies, lads. It's just an expression, but I used it wrong.""
    
    Pierre's laughter softened into a smile. ""No need for apologies, my friend. We understand. It is a funny mistake, no?""
    
    
    
    The group, now united by this comical blunder, made their way to a nearby pub, The Merry Goat, its sign swinging gently in the afternoon breeze.
    
    Over pints of dark stout, Patrick explained the nuances of Irish slang, his voice a mix of humility and humor.
    
    ""So, 'cocksucker' isn't about... well, what you might've thought. It's more like saying someone's a good sport, up for a laugh. But I got carried away, I suppose.""
    
    Fran√ßois nodded, his eyes sparkling with newfound knowledge. ""Language is fascinating, is it not? How a single word can carry such different meanings. We have similar expressions in French, but this one, it is unique.""
    
    ""It's all about context,"" Sean added, raising his glass. ""And we Irish do love our colorful language.""
    
    The laughter that filled the pub was infectious, drawing curious glances from other patrons.
    
    ""You know, lads,"" Patrick said, a hint of seriousness creeping into his voice, ""we Irish have a reputation for our tongues, but it's not always fair. We're not all brawlers and loudmouths.""
    
    Fran√ßois waved his hand dismissively. ""We understand, Patrick. Stereotypes rarely capture the essence of a people. Just as not all Frenchmen are romantic or surrender easily.""
    
    ""Exactly!"" Patrick exclaimed, thumping the table, making the glasses dance. ""It's these misunderstandings that can cause trouble, but they can also bring us together.""
    
    
    
    As the afternoon sun slanted through the pub's windows, casting long shadows, the conversation deepened.
    
    ""Tell us, Patrick,"" Fran√ßois inquired, his voice gentle, ""what are the Irish truly like beneath the stereotypes?""
    
    Patrick took a moment, his eyes reflecting the memories. ""We're a passionate bunch, no doubt. Fiercely loyal, too. Family and friends mean the world to us. And we've a rich history, filled with struggle and triumph.""
    
    Pierre, his eyes glistening with interest, leaned forward. ""And what of your famous Irish wit? Is it true you can find humor in even the darkest times?""
    
    ""Ah, that we can,"" Sean interjected. ""It's our way of coping, I suppose. A good joke can lighten the heaviest burden.""
    
    The pub's atmosphere, warm and inviting, seemed to encourage honesty and connection.
    
    ""You see, lads,"" Patrick began, his voice earnest, ""we may be known for our drinking and our brawls, but there's more to us. We're poets and dreamers, fighters and lovers. We cherish our land and our heritage.""
    
    Fran√ßois nodded, his expression thoughtful. ""It is the same with us French. We, too, have a rich culture, often misunderstood. We value our art, our cuisine, and the joy of life.""
    
    ""Then we have more in common than meets the eye,"" Pierre added, raising his glass. ""To friendship and understanding!""
    
    The clink of glasses filled the air, accompanied by murmurs of agreement.
    
    
    
    As the evening deepened, the laughter and conversation flowed freely. The initial misunderstanding had evolved into a bond, a shared experience that transcended language barriers.
    
    ""I must say, lads,"" Patrick declared, his voice carrying above the pub's din, ""I never thought I'd be having pints with a couple of Frenchmen, but here we are! It's a grand evening.""
    
    Fran√ßois and Pierre, their faces glowing from the drink and camaraderie, smiled widely.
    
    ""It's been an honor, Patrick, Sean,"" Fran√ßois said, his voice sincere. ""You've shown us a side of Ireland we would not have discovered on our own.""
    
    ""And we've learned that beneath our differences,"" Pierre added, ""we share a love for life, laughter, and a good story.""
    
    The pub's patrons, caught up in the spirit of the moment, cheered, their voices blending into a joyful chorus.
    
    In that moment, amidst the clinking glasses and roaring laughter, a friendship was forged, proving that misunderstandings could be bridges to connection rather than barriers.
    
    
    
    The following days saw Patrick, Sean, Fran√ßois, and Pierre exploring Dublin together, their laughter ringing through the streets. The initial misconception had become a running joke, a shared secret that only strengthened their bond.
    
    As the Frenchmen prepared to depart, they exchanged heartfelt farewells with their new Irish friends.
    
    ""We'll return, of that you can be sure,"" Fran√ßois promised, his voice thick with emotion.
    
    ""And we'll be here, ready for more adventures,"" Patrick replied, his eyes glistening.
    
    
    
    In the heart of Dublin, where the Liffey's murmur echoes through cobbled streets, a story of unexpected camaraderie was about to unfold, born from a simple yet explosive misconception.
    
    
    
    Patrick O'Connor, a burly man with a heart as warm as Irish coffee, strolled through the bustling Temple Bar, his laughter booming like the nearby river after a pint or two. He was a local, a fixture in the neighborhood, known for his jovial spirit and the occasional loud outburst.
    
    ""Top o' the mornin' to ya, Patrick!"" greeted his mate, Sean, from across the street.
    
    Patrick's response was a hearty laugh that seemed to shake the nearby windows. ""Sean, me lad! How's the world treatin' ya?""
    
    As Patrick engaged in banter with Sean, a pair of strangers observed with intrigue. They were French tourists, Fran√ßois and Pierre, fresh off the plane and eager to explore the famed Irish hospitality.
    
    ""Regarde, Fran√ßois,"" Pierre whispered, his eyes wide. ""That man, he is... how do you say... exuberant?""
    
    Fran√ßois, a slender man with a carefully trimmed beard, nodded. ""Oui, quite the character. I believe the Irish are known for their lively spirits.""
    
    Unbeknownst to them, their quiet observation was about to take a dramatic turn.
    
    Patrick, in the midst of a story, suddenly pointed at the two Frenchmen. ""Look there, Sean! Tourists, eh? Let's show 'em some Irish warmth!""
    
    Before Fran√ßois and Pierre could react, Patrick's robust voice filled the air. ""Welcome, lads! First time in Dublin, is it?""
    
    Pierre, startled, let out a surprised gasp, ""Eek!""
    
    Fran√ßois, more composed, replied, ""Indeed, monsieur. We are eager to explore your beautiful city.""
    
    ""Beautiful, eh? Well, it's the people that make it so!"" Patrick slapped Fran√ßois on the back, nearly knocking him forward. ""And we Irish know how to enjoy life, just like our French cousins! We're all cocksuckers for a good time, am I right?""
    
    The moment Patrick's words landed, he realized his mistake. The laughter that had been bubbling in his throat died abruptly.
    
    Fran√ßois's eyes widened, and a mix of emotions played across his face. ""Pardon?""
    
    Pierre, misunderstanding the term, leaned forward with a grin. ""Oui, we are always up for a good time! But we did not know this expression, 'cocksuckers.' It is very... colorful, non?""
    
    Sean, standing nearby, burst into a fit of laughter, his shoulders shaking. ""Oh, Patrick, you've done it now!""
    
    Patrick's face flushed a deep crimson. ""I... uh... didn't mean... that is...""
    
    The Frenchmen's confusion turned to amusement, and their laughter rang out, mingling with Sean's.
    
    ""It seems we have much to learn about Irish culture,"" Fran√ßois said between laughs.

1gleqam,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1gleqam/32_m4f_tx_looking_for_her/,32 [M4F] TX - Looking for Her,"Hello, I‚Äôm a 32 year old Hispanic male living in TX. I currently work as an engineer for a major refinery in the area, so my time outside of work can be fairly limited and I find it hard to make new connections outside of just work colleagues who sometimes go out for drinks. 

To give some history, I recently moved back to Texas late last year. Before that, I was moving around the country for work for about 3 years. First in Oregon, a few months in Iowa, and then in Chicago before making my way back to Texas on a job offer I just couldn‚Äôt turn down. Throughout that time, I‚Äôve found it hard to make connections outside of my current (mostly online) friend group. At first I blamed it on moving around so much. But I had over a year in most places I stayed to go out, get to know the area, and maybe find some connections. So that can‚Äôt be it, right?

I find myself feeling lonely, more now than ever since I‚Äôve decided to stick it out with this company for the long term and make the most of my career that I can here. But even with that loneliness in mind, how do I go about making friends, let along finding a partner now? I don‚Äôt really go out to clubs or party anymore. I go to the gym and a few coffee shops when I have the time, but I doubt you want to be approached by a random man while you‚Äôre doing your workout or working and enjoying your drink. Maybe I‚Äôm too in my own head, I‚Äôm not sure.

So what am I looking for? I‚Äôm looking for a companion to spend time with. Someone I can have plans for dinner with, someone to just mindlessly do nothing in the same vicinity with, to send bad memes to while we sit feet apart. I‚Äôm not looking to have a codependent relationship, been there done that, but to find someone who is stable in their life and knows what a healthy relationship is like. Age isn‚Äôt too much of a factor, to a certain degree, though I would prefer someone who isn‚Äôt going to need me to guide them through early adulthood. 

I am stable enough in my income to be able to support a stay at home partner and be able to fund their hobbies and give us a comfortable life. So if you‚Äôd rather be a homemaker, that‚Äôs fine with me. If you want to work, that‚Äôs fine as well. I don‚Äôt aim to take anyone‚Äôs autonomy away, simply to find someone to share life‚Äôs joys with. I would just ask that if you choose to stay home, please help with some organization and potential cooking when I‚Äôm running a bit too late at the office. 

I want to clarify that children aren't for me. Please don't try to change that, you won't. And it'll just be a really awkward conversation if you try to. 

Do I have physical preferences? Of course I do, I think we all do. My preferences are more with how someone presents themselves and takes care of their appearance more so than specific physical characteristics. My job has certain social functions that I sometimes have to attend and showing up well dressed and well put together can be a big factor in terms of image and perception. And you know what they say? ‚ÄúPerception is reality‚Äù, at least in the corporate world. I want to clarify, I‚Äôm not trying to find a model to date, I just want someone who can clean up nicely when necessary. I know it‚Äôs a vain ask, but sometimes you have to play the corporate game in order to be able to get to where you want to make a difference. 

I want to go ahead and give a disclaimer so that you don‚Äôt waste your time. I am in the larger side at the moment and am working on losing the weight for both aesthetic and health reasons. To give you an idea, I currently weight 260 and my end goal weight is 175. I am working with my doctor, a nutritionist, and a trainer to reach this and have already made progress. But if this isn‚Äôt something you‚Äôd want to be around for, or I‚Äôm just not your type that‚Äôs fine. Please don‚Äôt waste both of our time by making fun of my weight or mocking my efforts to become a better me. I know how easy that can be done through a screen and a keyboard. 

If you actually read all of this rambling mess and any of it resonated with you, shoot me a message and we can chat. No expectations, just a friendly exchanging of words. ",1,1730942226.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False
1glep7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1glep7w/nothing_like_this/,Nothing like this,"Hayden is on his way to watch Arcane with me so I‚Äôd better make this quick. A year ago around this time I focused on making myself beautiful and cooking a Friendsgiving meal with my partner and never really participated in  the group watch of the show. It was the most involved I was with blended house of friends in a long while. When that ended I thought I messed something up. Messed up what I put so much effort into. So much work.

But the fact of the matter is. It doesn‚Äôt take any effort at all to feel at home with you. And we already have started to build our own group and merge friends. It was effortless to feel so close to you. We are both in the practice of meditation and knowing the importance of gratitude and being present. It shows. The other day you said video games were for people who couldn‚Äôt play the game of life properly and they want to waste time. You‚Äôre about self maxing, self improvement, spirituality, family and business. Your work ethic is not like my cousins, but, you sure have a talent. 

So far you have told me to go get ready for bed and you‚Äôd put our left overs away, you get up and lock my doors, you investigate noises, and you have surprised me with breakfast and brought me coffee. It really is the little things. I never feel like it‚Äôs something you wanted and I was there to tag along - you genuinely show you care and how much you think about me. You crawl in and cuddle me if you‚Äôre up before me just so I wake up next to you. That is something I haven‚Äôt had in a while‚Ä¶or really ever. The way I feel when you hold me is different. I‚Äôve never been so excited to have these blessings in my life. 

I was manifesting love and friendship last year and I finally got it all. It cost nothing, we‚Äôre all in the trenches but I feel truely loved and wanted. 

How do I see people for years on end and you already want me to marry me?

1glenos,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1glenos/saving_saskatoon_r18_aus_m_uscanada_18_jp/,"""Saving Saskatoon"" (R18+ AUS, M US/Canada, 18 JP) Upcoming Triple A open world game offers a playable area of 300km2 and is a 1:1 map of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Set in an alternate present, with a customisable character, you have to save the city from mobsters and biker gangs who have invaded","""Saving Saskatoon""

A Triple A upcoming open world game with a playable area of 300km^2, with an impressive 1:1 scale map of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, offering dozens of driveable vehicles and motorbikes as well as a handful of aircraft.

With a blockbuster story mode campaign, you can either play as one of two stock characters - Tristan Delaney or Lana Lewis - or play as a customisable character (the character creator is impressive and offers the choice of multiple hairstyles, facial feature types, skin tones and body types as well, so you can be muscular or skinny or fat and you can also modulate height, with a maximum height of 2 meters or minimum of 1.55m).

Playing as your chosen character, you are a former drifter who has moved back to your home town of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan after being fired from your job as a paid intern at an advertising firm over in Sacramento, California after accidentally walking in on your boss - an advertising executive - cheating on his wife with his secretary (the cinematic flashback for this is hilaruous to say the least).

Following your return back home to beautiful Canada, it becomes clear that Saskatoon has been invaded by mobsters and biker gangs and you are inadvertently forced to take out the invaders neighborhood by neighborhood after being drawn into a war.

Play the blockbuster story campaign or just enjoy some freedom and explore the sights and sounds of Saskatoon. The environment of ""Saving Saskatoon"" offers the bustle and crowded NPC appearances of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 (2023) and Watch Dogs 2 (2016), the expanse of Star Citizen and the open interiors of Ghost Recon: Wildlands, the sandbox qualities of GTA V and the fast-paced action of many top-rated RPGs in the video game industry. 240km^2 of the playable area is the actual city itself, Saskatoon as it is in 2025, with a rich history dating back to the late 19th century and the remaining 60km^2 is of the surrounding area near the city. Multiple side missions will also keep you busy and open up new activities. Although gun stores require you to have a permit, you can simply go to 1 of 3 underground gun shops in the city or complete 3 ""CCW permit"" or 4 ""Open-Carry permit"" missions in order to shop freely at any of the city's 8 licensed gun stores. Both permits confer different advantages; e.g. would-be muggers and attackers will hesitate or flee if you've got an OC but some NPCs may become uncomfortable (or belligerent) if you brandish a firearm without an OC.

Although cops won't immediately pursue you and arrest you whilst you're ""taking back control"" of Saskatoon fron the invaders, they will however pursue you if you attack random civilians...or attack the cops themselves or respond to calls from bystanders and liquor store or mall owners if you decide to ""play dirty"".

Talking of stores, there are also accessible grocery stores on the map and three large main malls with two-storey parking structures (no loading screens when entering most buidings on the map). These are not just cosmetic as the game's health system means you can replenish health by purchasing and consuming food and drink which you can buy in store. For extra added effect, many buildings are populated and you can either queue like in real life or just use a self-service machines. Coffee shops are also accessible and offer hot beverages and food and medpacks. Luckily - phew! - these technicalities don't appear to apply to vehicles as you always have unlimited gas (or power if you have an EV) and don't need to fill up at gas stations, although there are numerous accessible gas stations dotted around the map.

Unfortunately, there is a hydration and hunger bar, so you will need to consume beverages and food regularly even if your health bar is full. There are also three accessible gyms on the map and you can also purchase and use exercise machines inside your home(s) or motel or hotel rooms and build or lose muscle or get fat or thinner. Muscle loss also increases over time if you don't regularly workout, although you are able to purchase illicit drugs from street dealers dotted across the map to maintain your physique, but the more dealers you kill theoughout the story mode, the less likely you are to find a dealer, let alone a dealer who will sell drugs to you.

Even with the blockbuster campaign, you are able to complete two other blockbuster side story campaign modes should you wish to and you are able to cancel these at any time: one is ""The Reporter"", where you have to complete 2 (dangerous) missions in order to unlock an interview at the fictional Saskatchewan Broadcasting Corporation building and the other is ""Private Eye"" where you can set up your own missing persons agency investigating disappearances. 

Unfortunately, ""Private Eye"" is only unlocked after you A) Purchase an apartment or house and/or B) have an in-game net worth of over CA$500,000 and also C) Clear out the chosen area where you wish to set up your agency. Requirement C requires you to make your chosen area safe and this will involve shootouts with the gangs which may have control of your chosen area.

Currency in *Saving Saskatoon* is indeed Canadian Dollars and an early cinematic shows your character (in the trailer, it's Tristan Delaney) exchanging a few hundred US dollars for Canadian dollars. The exchange rate shown in the cinematic was 1USD/1.39CAD

Runours that ""Saving Saskatoon"" was going to have Ubisoft or Rockstar Games as the final official publisher are unfounded and neither Ubisoft nor Rockstar as publishers nor their affiliated developer studios were involved in any aspect of this game.

...and yes, Burger King is indeed ostensibly advertised in the game as Burger King's parent company, RBI, is said to have paid the Saving Saskatoon's developer studio an undisclosed sum to do so in anticipation that ""Saving Saskatoon"" would fetch at least 300,000 unique purchases within its first six months of release and thus hundreds of thousands of players, so there are Burger King restaurants as well as digital dynamic adverts and billboards.

Whilst all versions of *Saving Saskatoon* are mostly the same, there is a slight difference with the Japanese version of *Saving Saskatoon* sold in territories in Japan; players (in Japan or those who have purchased/imported the Japanese version) may sometimes see tobacco adverts on billboards, on phones, on vehicles and inside stores, given that tobacco marketing in mass media is not prohibited in Japan abd businesses are free to advertise. These commercials and ads have however been removed from all other versions of *Saving Saskatoon* in order to adhere to laws in those jurisdictions, including the Canadian and US versions given that official tobacco advertising is prohibited in both of these jurisdictions. Some international tobacco companies have however paid the studio undisclosed amouunts to advertise products for copies of *Saving Saskatoon* aimed at the Japanese market/customers in Japan.",1,1730942015.0,stories,0,1.0,False

**Scenario: Tipanis Towers Hotel, Mist City ‚Äî 3:43 PM**

‚ÄúFor the last time, Dhule, I won‚Äôt be able to come into the office today!‚Äù an agitated voice rang out from behind the bedroom door. The door shot open, revealing a woman in a professional, mauve suit jacket. Her long, brown hair was tied back into a neat ponytail, with sleek black glasses framing her violet eyes. In her hands was a laundry basket, full of soft, clean fabrics. Everything else from the waist down was sweatpants and striped socks. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm in RƒÅkin this week,‚Äú Jyoti Marwa scowled into her bluetooth earpiece. ‚ÄúYes, I already told you that. Yes, I‚Äôll be back in time for our meeting with the Sharma‚Äôs.‚Äù As the real estate agent walked across the wooden penthouse floors, she masterfully sidestepped a few errant toys and pillows scattered across her path. She rolled her eyes as she set down the basket onto the nearest chair. 

‚ÄúHow‚Äôre things going with the Thackur family? I heard the husband is giving you a hard time about‚Äì Oh hold on a second.‚Äù

She pressed her finger against her earpiece as her eyes locked onto the living room. ‚ÄúDin, sweety, please don‚Äôt jump on the couch like that. You‚Äôll break something!‚Äù The mother sighed as she returned to her prior conversation, making her way over to the kitchen table, where an open laptop surrounded by an unorganized pile of papers sat idly. 

‚Äú‚ÄìRight, where were we? Oh, the sale, yes. How‚Äôs that going, again?‚Äù Jyoti sat down at the kitchen table, dragging her finger in a jagged pattern along the touchpad to wake the laptop up. Her eyes darted between about eleven open tabs on her browser, some bearing important documents and files, with a few dedicated to local takeout menus and ‚Äòthings to do around assam in post-monsoon season‚Äô on the last Google search. A ding alerted Jyoti to one of the former tabs, an email. She held her breath as selected the tab, her eyelids lowering at the header: ‚ÄúIn Regards to the Estate‚Äù, accompanied with the PDF of another lengthy legal document. She released her captive breath, rubbing her temples as her co-worker droned on inside of her ear.

‚ÄúHey, yeah, I‚Äôm going to have to call you back, Dhule. Good luck with that Mr. Thacker. Okay, bye.‚Äù She tapped her earpiece with a final nod as she reached for her mug of black coffee. She took a long sip, only for her face to sour. It had gone cold. ‚ÄòOh well‚Äô, she thought as she dragged her mouse over to the PDF, steeling herself for the amount of reading she was about to do.

From behind the couch, a sneaky Din peered at his mother. A toothy grin was plastered onto his face as he Inched his way towards the kitchen. He ducked low, trying to use the kitchen table as a hiding spot as he passed it. Making sure that the coast was clear, he tip-toed over to the cabinet just above the counter, knowing full well that a golden syrup spiral was a mere breath away. Though, given his stature, he was unable to reach anything beyond the counter, but that wouldn‚Äôt be quite enough to stop the boy.

With a muffled grunt, Din hoisted his foot onto the handle of a floor-level cupboard. And soon after, his other foot had made purchase, as well. He lifted himself onto the counter, opening the cabinet to find a myriad of snacks, among them his most sought after prize: a big jalebi disc wrapped in clear plastic. Din giggled as he reached for his treasure, only to halt in his tracks at the sound of his name.

‚ÄúDin Jwala Marwa! Get down from there,‚Äù his mother chastised, pinching the bridge of her nose. Though her eyes were still glued to the monitor, she radiated a knowing aura. Din frowned. She was always one step ahead of him. With a huff, the boy leapt from the counter, making a notable thud throughout the room. Jyoti winced, before letting out an exhausted sigh. ‚ÄúPlease, we have neighbors, Din.‚Äù 

The boy nodded as he immediately started moving in another direction. Jyoti took this moment to tear her eyes away from the screen for but a moment. She raised an eyebrow, as she seemed to have lost the little bugger. Where could he have gone in such a short amount of time? Hell, the penthouse wasn‚Äôt that big. Jyoti wasn‚Äôt too worried, he couldn‚Äôt have gotten that far-

The real estate agent nearly jumped out of her seat upon turning to find her son standing right beside her, sifting through the already unorganized sea of documents. She lowered her eyelids. How did he always do that? Before she could grab a single page from his little, thieving hands, the boy held one of them in her face.

‚ÄúWhat does this say?‚Äù he said, pointing to a particular word.

‚ÄúI believe that would be ‚ÄòEstate‚Äô‚Äù, Jyoti replied. ‚ÄúIt's that large piece of land our family owns here.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike the one Grandma‚Äôs living at?‚Äù Din questioned.

Jyoti coughed. ‚ÄúYes, that is where your grandmother is staying currently.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen will I get to see her again?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell-,‚Äù Jyoti started, a genuine lump stopping the rest of that sentence from leaving her throat. She looked into the eyes of her young, clever, but gentle little boy. She soon after closed her own eyes shut, taking a deep breath in to clear the way.

‚Äú-she‚Äôs‚Ä¶ ah‚Ä¶ still recovering, sweet pea. You wouldn‚Äôt want to bother her while she‚Äôs resting, would you?‚Äù

‚ÄúBut she was recovering the last time you came here. She‚Äôs probably been lonely all this time.‚Äù Din bore a look of genuine concern. He hadn‚Äôt seen his grandmother in a few weeks, and he was so used to seeing her while in the city. Jyoti went to speak, but held her tongue once more. She put a hand onto her son‚Äôs shoulder, a warm, though pained look on her own face. 

‚ÄúShe might have to wait just a bit longer.‚Äù

In another room, a girl walks in, holding a basket of clothes in both arms. She wore dull, but comfortable clothes, with a white towel wrapped around her head. Chandi sat the basket onto her bed, wasting no time in emptying it. As the teenager folded a pair of trousers, she held them out to her side, where a young man would grab them and put them into an open drawer. The two worked in silence, much to Chandi‚Äôs preference. Though he could keep up fine enough with her quick folding techniques, Vasil would‚Äôve preferred a little instruction, as he had mainly been acting on vibes alone. But he wasn‚Äôt here to complain. Chandi said she had needed some help around the penthouse today, and so here he was, even if she wasn‚Äôt in a chatty mood.

The sculptor slotted another folded shirt into a dresser. As he worked, he took a glance around the room. Everything was neat and tidy. The sheets were folded snug, the floor devoid of clutter. A citrus smell wafted throughout the hotel suite. It was incredibly clean, and that was even before he got here. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve sure been busy, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù Vasil remarked.

‚ÄúYou could say that‚Äù, Chandi replied.

‚ÄúI would,‚Äù Vasil cocked an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the occasion?‚Äù

Though Chandi had seemed otherwise occupied for the past few hours, her focus shifted onto the sculptor for a moment, a look of intensity in her eye.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know? It‚Äôs Kati Bihu!‚Äù Chandi put down the cloth she was working on to show her phone to Vasil, revealing a checklist. She had already done more than half.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been forever since I‚Äôve been able to celebrate. They only really celebrate here in Assam, so I haven‚Äôt been able to do any of the celebrations since I was a young girl.‚Äù

Her eyelids lowered, her brief smile melting into a pensive frown. ‚ÄúWe, uh, used to go with my grandmother‚Ä¶‚Äù

Vasil lowered his head in kind. A picture was starting to form in his head, with each new piece making it clearer and clearer. It had only been a couple of weeks since Shalin‚Äôs exposure to the city, but it seemed to have taken no time at all for the ripples of that action to spread throughout her family. It was important that Shalin was finally stopped, but he still couldn‚Äôt help but feel responsible. There were consequences for Shalin‚Äôs double life. And now that the veil had been lifted, it was only a matter of time before everyone involved would be swept up into them.

‚ÄúChandi, I‚Äôm so sorry-‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be. Please,‚Äù she said with a small smile. Vasil could tell she was straining, something was being left unsaid. The sculptor had enough tact to keep it that way.

‚ÄúSo, what exactly goes into these sorts of celebrations, anyways?‚Äù Vasil said, rubbing the back of his neck. Chandi perked back up, if only slightly.

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôve already tended to the Tulsi plant here at the hotel. I even said a few prayers. But I haven‚Äôt been able to light the Akash Banti yet,‚Äù Chandi said with a sigh. ‚ÄúMom said we could go out once she was done working, but it will probably be a little later than that, given we have to get the whole family ready.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see, that sounds like a lot of fun,‚Äù Vasil grinned, folding a shirt himself as she talked.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a beautiful experience,‚Äù Chandi said. ‚ÄúWould you like to come with us?‚Äù

 Vasil‚Äôs eyes widened. ‚ÄúOh, are you sure? I really wouldn‚Äôt want to intrude on a family outing.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh but you have to!‚Äù Chandi insisted. ‚ÄúEspecially if this is your first Kati Bihu.‚Äù

Vasil closed his eyes for a moment. He didn‚Äôt know if he‚Äôd be overstepping. After all, this was bound to be a rough time for the whole family. He could feel the tension in the hotel. It was quiet, but it swelled with every new letter from the Marwa‚Äôs law firm, everytime the woman was forced to be summoned from one of their lips. But perhaps this was the very reason he couldn't just leave them to suffer alone. This was a part of the healing process. And he did promise to help her out, didn‚Äôt he? He opened his eyes, looking back over to Chandi with a warm smile. 

‚ÄúWell then, how can I refuse?‚Äù

**Scenario: Runstorm Farm, Northern Floodplains ‚Äì 7:52 PM**

The Metropolis Suite had been buried, and despite the rhetoric and worries of its members, Rakinnagarh still persisted. There remained harms to be addressed, justice to be served, and work to be done. Some of that work was social, political, investigative, efforts to restructure the city and build something new. But there was other kinds of work, the upkeep of the old, the preservation of cycles. 

In the midst of a flurry of chaos and change, you still had to work for next year‚Äôs harvest.

This truth is what had drawn Vasant Bulsara to the Northern Floodplains. The Old City gained a reputation as the heart of the Rakin City Protests, giving them a stage on which to speak. Bedtown‚Äôs own notoriety had gained it some attention as well. These were areas with problems to be addressed‚Äìand it was true, Vasant respected his friends‚Äô work in both those areas. But still, the rice and sugar needed to be picked, and the farmers on the outskirts of Rakin were not being fairly compensated for such vital work.

Vasant knew from the Old City protests that these movements could always use supplies, donations, helping hands. He had taken up any task that he was given: driving water and food to and from each protest, doing postering and outreach‚Äìhe even acted as a safety marshal for a couple of actions. All the while he engaged with people, asked them questions, and listened as they spoke of their varied concerns. 

There was discussion about a lack of infrastructure, storage, transportation, access to local and statewide markets. Various crops meant various needs, some at odds with one another. Often, farm owners wanted more labor and cheaper costs, while laborers who didn‚Äôt own farms demanded fairer wages and better working conditions. Occasionally someone, usually a laborer, threw around mentions of the Assam branch of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, wondering if they should join the farmworkers union. This tended to get an equal amount of support and derision. 

But as the month went on, Vasant kept hearing the same words sneak into conversations over and over. *Kati Bihu.* Eventually he had asked one of the farmers who brought it up, a rice farmer named Vineet Singh. They struck up a conversation, which ended in Vineet inviting Vasant to his farm to witness the festivities himself.

But when Vasant showed up to the rice paddy‚Ä¶he was not alone. While most members of Evergreen had plans that couldn‚Äôt be changed on such short notice, one member *insisted* on tagging along. 

While the ride to the farm had been spent in comfortable quiet, as Vasant parked the bike, he turned to his friend, and spoke. 

‚ÄúHave you been to one of these festivals before?‚Äù

Leaning himself against the Silver Dollar, Muuru Saviragowda shot Vasant a brilliant grin.

‚ÄúYouuuuu know it! My parent used to take me to all of ‚Äòem~ Bohag and Magh are more of a party, I‚Äôve still kept up with those buuuut, I‚Äôve been branching out! It‚Äôs important to help the dead, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúMm,‚Äù Vasant nodded, turning to gaze up at the silhouette of Mount Parapollah, shadowed against a sky of dusty lavender. Was the [„ÄåSoul Train„Äç](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1fpj5v7/jojos_bizarre_oc_tournament_7_r4m9_vasant_bulsara/) still running through its endless tunnels? Were its souls freed by the performance that he and Chase put on, or had they still been denied their chance to reincarnate once again?

‚ÄúVineet didn‚Äôt tell me much about the festival, beyond the fact that it‚Äôs set mainly in the rice paddies.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Vineet for ya! Always light on de~tails, that guy. Well to get into the spirit, I‚Äôve already taken my bath in the river and cleaned up the streets a bit‚Äìplus, everyone eeeelse puts the Tulasi on its little pedestals, so I just talk to those!‚Äù

Having parked his bike next to Vineet‚Äôs farm, he walked with Muuru deeper into the rice paddy, where he could see lights start to blink on in the distance, several feet above the field.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt offered them any prayers myself,‚Äù Vasant spoke, watching the silhouettes in the field continue their works‚Äìsetting up bamboo poles, pouring mustard oil into lanterns, and setting them alight to hang there. ‚ÄúBut I remember my neighbors used to have some growing by their house. It‚Äôs a holy plant, I‚Äôve heard.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe holiest,‚Äù a voice chimed in. Vineet stood there at the edge of the field, twisting a bamboo pole until it buried itself in the earth. He raised his brows as he saw Muuru there with Vasant, as the teenager gave him a grin in return. The man chuckled in response. ‚ÄúI should have known you two were friends.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe insisted on attending,‚Äù Vasant nodded, before looking over at the pole. ‚ÄúDo you need any help preparing for the festivities?‚Äù


‚ÄúMy family is out there setting up the other akaxh banti,‚Äù he said, before gesturing at the lantern he was about to set up on his own pole. ‚ÄúBut if you‚Äôre offering, we wouldn‚Äôt mind the help,‚Äù he continued, before his eyes glimmered with a quiet, somber light. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre short a pair of hands, this year.‚Äù

Vasant, seeing the look in the man‚Äôs eyes, nodded quietly and said nothing more. But Muuru, curious as ever, piped up with an ‚ÄúOhhhhh?‚Äù

The man heaved a sigh, smiling sadly as he watched each lantern blink on one by one. ‚ÄúIt was my eldest, Niyaan. He always had problems with his heart, but‚Ä¶he wouldn‚Äôt let it slow him down.‚Äù The man‚Äôs body was tense as he spoke, hand clutching at the bamboo like a lifeline. ‚ÄúHe never wanted to sit idly while we worked‚Äìhe knew that if we wanted to harvest enough rice to stay afloat‚Ä¶we needed all the help we could get.‚Äù

Both Muuru and Vasant had fallen silent at this point, listening solemnly to the man and his grief. It was a familiar sorrow‚ÄìMuuru had seen it etched into his father, into *so many people* all across this city. Vasant‚Äôs own travels had revealed that grief stretched near and far, through Uttar Pradesh, through Assam, through the whole of India and far beyond. To live was to die, this was a truth that could unite all living things, until at last they all attained nirvana. 

‚ÄúHe was getting treatment at Showtek, he was going to risk a surgery and everything, he was always sure that this would be the fix, that he would join us in the field and work like ten men until we started living comfortably. But‚Ä¶ [I don‚Äôt know what happened to the hospital,](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1djxytw/jojos_bizarre_oc_tournament_7_r2e3_moonchild/) suddenly everything was pushed back. It would have been years, unless we went to one of the private hospitals, and Niyaan refused to put us in more debt‚Ä¶‚Äù

Vineet looked out to the field, and Vasant followed his gaze as he did. Looking out to the lanterns, he remembered the light of the Soul Train. To pass from this life into the next was no tragedy. But to have your life severed before you could truly cultivate yourself, to leave others behind with the ghost of all that could have been‚Ä¶that is one of life‚Äôs great sorrows.

Turning back Vineet, Vasant strode forward, opening his hand. ‚ÄúOnly tell us as much or as little as you wish. Right now, we are here to help you, just tell us what you need.‚Äù

Vineet blinked, staring at the two of them, before his body began to tremble‚Äìracked with a quiet chuckle. *‚ÄùThank you, Tulasi,‚Äù* he mumbled under his breath, before shooting them a grin to rival Muuru‚Äôs. ‚ÄúVery well! Niyaan will be glad to know someone else is taking up his task‚Äìlet‚Äôs make this field so bright that no spirit could ever lose their way!‚Äù

With a laugh, Muuru shot the man a thumbs up, giving Vasant a light punch on his side. The biker just nodded once, letting his resolve speak for itself. But as he let Muuru light the next lantern, just like he once did with his mother, the glow illuminated his stoic expression as it shifted to a softer smile.

---

Though the Akshayas had no rice paddy of their own, a family friend of theirs allowed anyone to visit his field and help pay their respects. That was what brought the family to Runstorm Farm, Vasil striding ahead as he glanced around, looking out for anything suspicious. Jyoti and Chandi had both expressed worry that Shalin‚Äôs actions would lead to people taking revenge on her family. While nothing had happened yet, Vasil could at least give them a sense of safety.

Just as they were about to enter the farm, his eyes caught on distant silhouettes, lantern-light gleaming off a motorbike. He could hear Chandi sharply inhaling behind him, their footsteps stopping suddenly. But as he gazed at the figures, Vasil‚Äôs own posture quickly relaxed.

‚ÄúOh hey- don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs Muuru!‚Äù he called out, his apprehension having turned into a grin as the tension dissipated into this air. He gestured to the teen, who spotted them, perked up, and sped over. Vasil got an enthusiastic salute, before he spotted Chandi and stopped in his tracks. There was a moment‚Äôs pause, the slightest shade of blush across his face. 

‚ÄúOh- uh- hi Chandi!‚Äù he sputtered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs- nice to see you!‚Äù

‚ÄúNice to see you too!‚Äù Chandi responded, motioning him over to speak with her mother as Vasil looked back to the second person idling by the bike.

Vasant looked at the sculptor, giving him a quiet smile. ‚ÄúAh, you must be Vasil. I‚Äôve heard a lot about you,‚Äù he held his hand out for a handshake, ‚Äúso it‚Äôs nice to have a face to the name. I‚Äôm Vasant, by the way. A friend of Muuru‚Äôs.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, uh,‚Äù Vasil grabbed the man‚Äôs hand to return the shake. ‚ÄúNice to meet you as well, Vasant. So, you heard about‚Ä¶‚Äù he glanced over to see if he could spot Din. ‚Äú...about *that?‚Äù*

The man nodded, his attention shifting towards the boy‚Äî he had heard that Shalin had two grandchildren, so he assumed that one or both were being kept in the dark. ‚ÄúMm. Fortunately, that group is gone. However, there‚Äôs still the question of what comes next‚Äìwe‚Äôll all have a part in finding the answer.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Pick up the pieces, make sure nobody tries to recreate *the group,* help those involved‚Ä¶those are some good starting points. I think.‚Äù Vasil looked over at Chandi, watching as she curiously approached the two of them. ‚ÄúOh, Chandi‚Äîthis is Vasant-‚Äù

‚ÄúA friend of mine!‚Äù Muuru chimed in from beside her.

‚ÄúHello,‚Äù Chandi spoke. There was something terse beneath the veil of her voice‚ÄìVasant could *hear* it. What could be bothering her‚Äîdid *she* not know about Shalin? No, from what Muuru explained, she must have been aware. Regardless, she didn‚Äôt seem ready to open up about it. Vasant could respect that, but he could tell the young woman needed some comfort. 

Yet, before he could speak, a tearful cry filled the house:

**‚ÄúI-I CAN‚ÄôT CELEBRATE WITHOUT GRANDMA!!!‚Äù**

Everyone turned to the source of the yell‚ÄìDin quaked and sobbed in the field, damp earth clinging up to his knees, before he started ripping up the mud and tossing it about in a tearful fury. Chandi flinched, holding her jacket up to try and catch the clumps of soil, while Vasil and Vasant turned to Muuru, their faces sharing the same solemn agreement. The three of them couldn‚Äôt *tell* him why Shalin wasn‚Äôt being invited, that wasn‚Äôt their choice to make.

Jyoti was staring at her son with quiet horror, her grief shining in the lantern-light. She couldn‚Äôt force herself to move, she didn‚Äôt know what words could comfort her boy after being gone so often, she didn‚Äôt know what words could make it all make sense, everything her mother did, the loss, the pain, the knowledge that she couldn‚Äôt hide from him forever. Vasant watched her, frozen there, cold and still as the soil itself.

Vasil looked to Chandi, watching her swallow her own tears, trying to be strong for her mother, for her brother, as she always was when her caregivers were gone. She would not let them see her cry. She would not become an extra burden. She would not hurt people as her aaita had. She would *never* let them see her pain.

Vasil and Vasant‚Äôs eyes met‚Äìknowing then what needed to be done. Vasil strode down to the field‚Äôs edge, talking to Din in soft tones as he extended a hand to help the boy pull himself out of the mire.

Slowly, Vasant placed a hand on Jyoti‚Äôs and Chandi‚Äôs shoulders, grounding them both.

‚ÄúIt seems like you two need some time to talk,‚Äù his voice was slow, his breathing steady.

Jyoti‚Äôs brow creased, Chandi tried to keep her own inhale from shaking. ‚ÄúI- talk about what?‚Äù The young woman began.

‚ÄúWhatever you need to discuss, amongst family. Because you are here for each other now.‚Äù

Jyoti looked over at Chandi for a moment, feeling her hurt in an instant, striking to her very heart. She had to wonder how long her poor daughter had been carrying such a pain‚Äìand how long she had carried it herself.

‚ÄúWhat about Din‚Ä¶?‚Äù

Vasil turned to them both, smiling as he guided the boy back onto the path, letting Din hold onto his jacket like a blanket.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got him here! We‚Äôll take care of him for a bit, don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù

There was a moment‚Äôs quiet, a resistance, before the two sighed and finally relented.

The teen perked to attention, taking his gaze off Chandi and loosening his grip on his upper arm. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget me!‚Äù Muuru marched over to the group. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be ha~ppy to come join you two!‚Äù

Jyoti glanced at Muuru. ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù

‚ÄúAbsolutely!‚Äù He nodded, leading Vasant to sigh. It looked like he was adamant about this.

Chandi nodded to the both of them, heading to the door with Muuru as her mother turned to the other two in the room. ‚ÄúWhile we‚Äôre out, could you try and calm down Din? I don‚Äôt mean to push a screaming boy at you, but-‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be at two places at once, I understand,‚Äù Vasil interrupted. He looked at Vasant, who gave a brief nod before the two turned back to Jyoti. ‚ÄúI definitely think we can do that,‚Äù the artist replied, causing the woman to grow a faint smile.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she said plainly. ‚ÄúThank you so much. If he wants to join us let me know‚Äîyou did get my phone number, right Vasil?‚Äù

The sculptor gave another nod, satisfying Jyoti before she took Chandi and Muuru out, leaving the two alone with Din. As they checked on him, he had stopped tossing stuff and instead resorted to faintly sobbing on the floor. This was their chance.

Vasant turned to his fellow babysitter. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶how should we calm him down? What does he like?‚Äù

Vasil put a hand onto his chin, tapping his foot to think. ‚ÄúWell, Din really likes action films‚Äîhe‚Äôs been obsessed with them lately. Chandi tells me he‚Äôs been like this since he found out about his grandmother‚Äôs ‚Äòglory days‚Äò.‚Äù

Vasant looked around the field, slapping his hands against his pants. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm not exactly seeing anywhere we could plug in a DVD player.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou come up with something then!‚Äù Vasil scowled.

The biker nodded, thinking over their options. Suddenly, an idea popped into his head‚ÄîVasil noticed this and gave an inquisitive look. ‚Äú...perhaps *we* could be the action.‚Äù

*Shit*, Vasil thought. ‚ÄúI hate that that would work,‚Äù he groaned. He turned fully over to Vasant, crossing his arms. ‚ÄúBut are you sure this is a good spot for it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see why not‚Äù Vasant mused. ‚ÄúThere shouldn‚Äôt be anyone who could get caught in our fight, nor to [mistake our intentions](https://old.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1ehvw8r/).‚Äù

At that the artist shrugged. ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù he replied, briefly smirking to himself. ‚ÄúMay the best artist win.‚Äù

Vasant chuckled, as the two began to figure out the specifics. Once everything was settled, the biker turned towards Din, who was already starting to stir. ‚ÄúHey, little man! Watch this!‚Äù

Vasant struck a pose, not too dissimilar from that of a fighting game character. Vasil followed suit, shooting a playful glare at his impromptu opponent. Din started to sniffle, but the two could tell he was locked in. With a nod from both combatants, they both let out a mighty cry:

**‚ÄúOpen the Game!‚Äù**

**Location:** [A field of rice paddies](https://imgur.com/zuIAKaq). Where the north half contains the actual paddies themselves (teal areas), the southern half contains a wooden shack acting as a tool shed (brown rectangle) for tending said paddies. The water in each rice paddy is 10cm deep. The road (gray) bisecting the map is a gravel path but for the purposes of ÔΩ¢Kaycee SharpÔΩ£ the gravel can be considered continuous terrain. The map is 18x18 tiles with each tile being 2x2 meters.

Vasil and Vasant stand in the northwest and northeast corners of the grid respectively, each in their own paddy. Vasant‚Äôs motorcycle starts on a grass ridge between two paddies (the small Evergreen rectangle). Each rice paddy is lined with lanterns and effectively separates the paddies. While traversing from the path to a paddy is trivial, these paths effectively segment Vasil's area of control: Kaycee can only manipulate the ground of the paddy it stabs its sword into.

**Goal:** RETIRE your opponent!

Best poem of the month: CHRIS FORHAN Atonal Breakdown (Rating: 5/5)



ADRIAN MATEJKA

Editor‚Äôs Note, May 2024 (Rating: 1/5)

As mentioned by Karolina, the group is now going to put a great deal of emphasis on utilizing the POETRY app to review the audio versions of each poem. I couldn‚Äôt agree more with Karolina that poetry is intended to be a spoken word medium, and I sincerely thank POETRY magazine and each poet for taking the time to share their poems in their own words as they are intended to be read and understood.



Unlike politics, social media, and so many other aspects of contemporary western society, poetry is a place where wildly different cultures, opinions, and world views can palaver rationally and respectfully.



That said, I will let Karolina‚Äôs words speak for me regarding the beauty which spring delivers and the hope inspired by summer just around the bend. Karolina is a softer, more thoughtful person than I. It is wiser for me to adopt her words about the beauty of May rather than create my own words, as my words would never compare to the softness and thoughtfulness of hers.



Adrian Matejka‚Äôs commentary on mythology and her hometown in Indiana is certainly whimsical, and it jogged several similar memories of my own; however, a glaring contradiction was slipped in amongst Adrian‚Äôs flowery, spring prose ‚Äì ‚Äúanarchist collective.‚Äù



‚ÄúAnarchist collective‚Äù is the most ironic phrase in all of politics. The irony of anarchy is that it can only exist in a handful of the most stable societies. We can see this blatant irony in the recent university campus protests where students demanded to be fed, watered, and protected by their universities (the vast majority of which are taxpayer subsidized). This is manufactured anger caused by the extreme safety and prosperity of society in the United States. In other words, anarchists are nothing more than bored people with so little strife in their lives that they feel a need to manufacture problems where none exist.



Anarchy is war, famine, starvation, rape, disease, dehydration, brutality, tribalism, and autocracy

Let us consider what an ‚Äúanarchist collective‚Äù looks like outside of stable, law-and-justice countries ‚Äì Haiti, Mexican border towns, Gaza, eastern Ukraine, Congo, Rwanda, Somalia. Do you know who suffers the most in anarchist societies? Women. There are no female drug lords, no female dictators, no female cartel bosses. How many women have died crossing the US border so that the smuggler can ensure the more valuable clients, men, can reach the safety of our law-and-justice society? How many women have died in the stifling, oxygen-deprived trunks of cars? How many women have had their faces and genitals mutilated in Africa by machete-wielding, cocaine-infused gang members? You think you will attend college, have a career, and raise a family amongst such chaos? How many nuns, nurses, and female NGO employees have been kidnapped and sold into sex slavery while just trying follow their hearts to improve the lives of victims in anarchist-controlled societies? Try asking a child born of genocidal rape how they feel about anarchy. Better yet, ask the child‚Äôs mother how she feels about anarchy.



And perhaps that is the message of anarchists ‚Äì that anarchists have nothing thus they fear nothing. They feel they have been victimized by capitalist society. But think rationally about the chaos of anarchy; who dies first? The weakest! The children, the women, the elderly, the sick, the poor, the spineless men ‚Äì the very types of people who anarchists claim to help.



Anarchists hate masochist patriarchy more than anyone, yet their ignorance blinds them to the fact that anarchy is the perfection of masochistic patriarchy. At best, anarchy is oppression through violence, and at worst, unimaginable suffering and death.



I will never understand why artistic and intelligent people like Adrian Matejka promote anarchy as a paragon of virtuous supremacy.



Why would anyone wish for such a future for their lovers, children, family, and friends?

Per usual, I try my best to give writing an objective score rather than allowing my personal views to overshadow high quality writing; however, I am deeply troubled by the flippant admiration of anarchy, and it will be difficult for me to get over the knowledge that the editor of the most important poetry magazine in the world is an anarchist sympathizer. Anarchy is not politics ‚Äì anarchy is outside of politics and lacks rationality. Anarchy has nothing to do with social justice, liberalism, or left-wing theory.



Anarchy is evil incarnate, and despite the handful of amazing poems that appear in this issue, I cannot in good conscious rate anarchist sympathies anything other than 1/5 stars.



Imagine being a poet who is excited to tell their friends and family that their work was selected by POETRY magazine, only to have their hard work posted in an issue dedicated to the ironic and hypocritical ‚Äúanarchist collective‚Äù.



How fucking embarrassing it must be for these brilliant poets to show this issue to their friends and family.



Does the entire Poetry Foundation board of directors support anarchy, or is this unilaterally Adrian Matejka‚Äôs editorial discretion?





CATHERINE BARNETT

Restricted Fragile Materials (Rating: 4/5)

Catherine‚Äôs voice is soft but deep and serious. Her voice adds gravity to this poem, however, the latter half of the poem and specifically the ending are highly cryptic. There is nothing wrong with this in principle, but the risk is that readers will not grasp the meaning. I don‚Äôt think reader understanding is necessarily a requirement for poetry, but it‚Äôs always going to be hard to award a 5/5 to cryptic poetry. The imagery is beautiful, but the last stanza is confusing ‚Äì by all accounts this is a negative, regretful poem yet Catherine wants her son to have the same experiences she has? ‚ÄúHow will I tell him the river I feared to drink from has come to drink from me?‚Äù I loved this powerful line, but without context it loses its power.



Ars Poetica (Rating: 3.5/5)

Again, Catherine‚Äôs voice is lovely and contributes to the beaty of the poem ‚Äì but the vagueness and cryptic nature of the poem is a bit of a turn off for me personally.



‚ÄúHave You Ever Written a Poem about Death?‚Äù My Mother Asks (Rating: 5/5)

What I found most interesting about this poem is the title. Catherine‚Äôs mother is questioning her, yet Catherine does not mention her mother at all in the poem. It is as if Catherine is so overcome with thoughts of death that her mother (who presumably sits at her side) is completely forgotten. Death is the most common subject in poetry, one that grows boring very quickly; however, Catherine has written a beautiful poem that is creative enough to make me forget about how trope-y and generic death poems can be. I especially liked the line, ‚Äú‚Ä¶and drank his coffee black to avoid the inconvenience of milk.‚Äù Wow, that really gave me a good laugh! It is so annoying to prepare coffee only to realize I am out of milk. It is a crushing blow to the spirit that threatens the very stability of my entire morning. Inconvenient, indeed!





ABDULKAREEM ABDULKAREEM

Enchanted Beach with Three Fluid Graces (Rating: 3/5)

I find myself torn about this poem. On one hand, I enjoyed the wordplay and imagery; on the other hand, I am confused by the epigraph of Salvador Dali. I reviewed all of Dali‚Äôs paintings and failed to find any relevance to this poem. The only solution I could think of is that Abdulkareem is not speaking about a particular Dali painting, but rather about Dali‚Äôs unconventional approach of using oil paint on canvas. As previously mentioned, gimmicks like epigraphs are a risk. The risk did not pay off, and it distracts from an otherwise solid poem.





ANDREA COHEN

Matinee (Rating: 4/5)

Karolina ‚Äì This is a subtle and tricky poem, but it is thought provoking. A matinee is a play or performance held during the day or specifically the afternoon. I‚Äôm struggling to understand the relevance of a matinee as opposed to an evening play. Perhaps Andrea Cohen is using matinee as simile for middle age? Most of the poem is self-explanatory until we reach the final line, ‚ÄúThere will be no intermission.‚Äù I believe this line is a subtle way of describing the non-stop onslaught of problems we must deal with in middle age.



Fable (Rating: 3.5/5)

Karolina ‚Äì I agree that this is a weak poem in terms of its complexity and depth, but sometimes the poetry reader just wants something fun and light-hearted. I am fairly certain that Fable refers to The Jungle Books, which of course are adolescent books. Fable is a bit sinister if you read between the lines, but in the end, I find it simply to be a fun little poem that achieves its intended goal.





JODIE HOLLANDER

Avenue of Plane Trees (Rating: 2/5)

The idea and intent of the poem is interesting, but the execution is misguided. The first half of the poem is solid but devolves into generic lines about weather. If I were beta reading or editing this poem, I would advise the poet to delete everything after, ‚ÄúPerhaps Van Gogh should have left us out entirely.‚Äù Avoid using lame weather tropes as a crutch and stick to the interesting, unique ideas that were already working. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm getting major first-draft vibes from this poem. With refinement and rethinking, it could be a 4/5.





STELLA WONG

dramatic monologue as Beatriz Ferreyra (Rating: 0/5)

Karolina ‚Äì Agreed. I don‚Äôt know who Beatriz Ferreyra is, and after some Googling, I concur that this is probably for the best. I rarely rate a poem 0/5, but I feel compelled. I wish we could get an explanation from the Editor as to why this poem was selected. Silly, pointless, and meaningless - nothing redeeming here.





CHRIS FORHAN

Atonal Breakdown (Rating: 5/5)

Karlonia ‚Äì I‚Äôm not sure if you intended to make a joke, but I had a laugh at your review: ‚ÄúA very contemporary poem, but in a positive way.‚Äù Contemporary writing is often the tip-of-the-spear of revolutionary social justice, often resulting in low ratings and upset readers. Contemporary writing isn‚Äôt inherently bad writing, but I did find it humorous that you associate contemporary writing exclusively with negativity ‚Äì and I think you are correct. Atonal Breakdown is one of my favorite poems of 2024 so far. I was preparing to quote a few of my favorite lines, but I love every single line! Maybe this is a feeling we all face as we age, but lately I have been overcome with the idea of silent accusations by nature about future crimes I have yet to commit. It is wildly uncanny to read this poem and have my recent emotions so perfectly described. Atonal Breakdown is Exhibit A of why I continue to slog through one bad poem after another ‚Äì finding that single, incredible, life-altering poem is worth the effort.





DAVID BAKER

Small Weathers (Rating: 5/5)

Poetry stands alone as the only artform that doesn‚Äôt suffer from plagiarism. Paintings, novels, songs, photography ‚Äì they are all ripe with fraud. Poets are a proud but selfless breed; we freely give pieces of our hearts and minds to strangers. Small Weathers is an example of how poets do not plagiarize, but instead utilize the pieces of hearts and minds of other poets to build upon their ideas with our own ideas. Poets are like bricks ‚Äì we build walls, borrowing from one other and strengthening one other. No other artform can say this.

  
GERARD BEIRNE  
Elegy for a Marriage (Rating: 4.5/5)  
Karolina ‚Äì This is an elegiac couplet, not a haiku. This is a difficult form of poetry, and I applaud Gerard Beirne for his efforts; however, I am a bit perplexed about the meaning of the poem. We are mourning both the death of a marriage, presumably by divorce, and the death of children. The common theme here is the ‚Äúunknown‚Äù ‚Äì what could have been that never had a chance. It feels like a stretch to compare a divorce to the death of a child, but perhaps the poem could be inferring that this divorce was the symbolic death of unborn children who will now not have an opportunity to exist.  
  
  
KUSH THOMPSON  
M A S H (Rating: 4/5)  
I struggled to find a connection to this poem. Sometimes we as poetry readers come across a poem that is so alien to us that it causes the poem to completely lack meaning, and because of this, I will just mirror Karolina‚Äôs rating.  
I bled through the entire month of April (Rating: 5/5)  
Wow ‚Äì that was hardcore. This is definitely on my short list for the best poem of 2024. The imagery of the ‚Äúpetals packed in plastic tubs on a shelf‚Äù is heartbreaking. It is bizarre to feel excited about such a sad poem, but this poem deserves praise.

\[Untitled\] (Rating: 1/5)  
This poem is fucked up, but not in an interesting or clever way. Frankly, it‚Äôs just sick and gross. I‚Äôll give one point for developing a concrete poem in the shape of an embryo, but this is about as close to a 0/5 as I get. Please seek therapy. You clearly have something seriously screwed up going on in your head.  
  
Meta-Ekphrasis I: Plasmata (Rating: 0/5)  
This author‚Äôs obsession with embryo ‚Äúpoetry‚Äù is very disturbing. And don‚Äôt give me the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a man so you can‚Äôt understand.‚Äù This author is straight up sick and disturbed, and I‚Äôm shocked this writing was published.  
Worst ‚Äúpoetry‚Äù of 2024; worst poet of 2024.

Bei Dao ‚Äì There are some interesting lines and thought-provoking images, but this is wildly over-the-top in terms of existentialist nonsense. Some of this may be due to translating from Chinese to English. It‚Äôs interesting writing because of the cultural differences with the western world, but is that enough to give the poems a strong rating? Bei Dao is a challenge to rate because this type of delirium induced stream-of-consciousness writing, regardless of which language, is always going to be extremely subjective. I think a 2.5/5 is a fair rating.  
  
COLE SWENSEN  
Story Problem (Rating: 5/5)  
‚Äú‚Ä¶a visio-kinetic echo connected to the viewer.‚Äù Magnificent wordplay and vocabulary mastery! The topic of the prose poem is basic and trope-y, but the wordplay is so incredibly unique and playful that I must award a perfect rating. I physically felt vertigo and got slightly dizzy for a moment while mentally visualizing the illusion of the trains moving.  
  
Birds on Statues (Rating: 5/5)  
‚Äú‚Ä¶but, determined to assert their alterity, they make sure that they‚Äôre always facing backward.‚Äù A clever and humorous prose poem! It‚Äôs very rare that I laugh out loud while reading poetry, but this was comedic gold!

LISA JARNOT  
Abandon the creeping Meatball: An Anarcho-Spiritual Treatise (Rating 0/5)  
Regardless that the piece is well-written and grammatically sound, I cannot in good conscious rate anarchist propaganda as anything other than a zero. Only in America amongst the safety, security, justice, and prosperity of capitalism can anarchist collectives survive. The irony and hypocrisy are too blatant to ignore. I am happy to listen to political debates from any point in the left to right spectrum, but anarchy is a complete disconnect from politics, civility, social stability, and rational thinking. Anarchy is not political ‚Äì it is literally suicidal and homicidal when put into action. I am shocked and appalled that POETRY magazine is supporting anarchy, and I really don‚Äôt think this is just a subjective opinion.  
  
  
MICHAEL FRAZIER  
It's Not a Mask if You Wear it Right (Rating 3/5)  
At church, I Tell My Mom She's Singing Of-Key and She Says, (Rating 3/5)  
This is not a particularly elegant poem, but I did find it rather humorous and relatable. Dialog is quite difficult to pull off in poetry, but this poem does it reasonably well. I have always found it funny that a church full of terrible singers always somehow manages to sound beautiful when all of the voices meld into one.

Where do I even begin. I lost my best friend of 14 years for good a few months ago and I'm still reeling in it. Tbh, it was a long time coming but in hindsight, could I have gone about it in a better way? Probably. We'd been having issues since around 2020, as we were both just navigating our new teenage years. I remember we were fighting over a boy, who just happened to express more interest in me, and she would not drop it for the life of her. Nothing ever came out of it for either of us, but she would constantly bring him up in arguments as I did not tell her I liked him until she started to get suspicions from another friend I had told. I knew in my 14 year old brain that telling her would cause more grief than anything else as regardless of how much me and this boy liked eachother I was not allowed to date at that time so what was the point? She would also speak to me about this boy before she knew I liked him too in an extremely sexual manner for a 14 year old, which made me see her in somewhat of a different light. Around that time as well we had made a new friend. We would go on calls together with this girl and a few of her friends and I remember it actually being such a peak time in my life. Best friend did not like it however as she felt as if she was never ""clued in"" on any of the conversations and that we speak too much about politics?? (Believe me I barely know what the government does, I wouldn't dream of speaking about that sort of thing). It basically seemed she was constantly mad at me for things out of my control.

It was fine for a while, we got back on track and moved on. I invited her on my family holiday for 3 weeks which was honestly the worst mistake of my entire life. Firstly, my dad paid for everything for her, including travel insurance and a nice expensive perfume, and she still had the audacity to bitch about him to me. I remember one time after dinner I was annoyed at him as he had been taking the piss out of me over something stupid, and best friend went off about how he was a terrible father... there was no need for that kind of extremity. She would also pick fights with me over the most minor things, and then blame it on the fact she had past ""trauma"" from her old friend group. (They were basically a group of typical teenage girls that sort of excluded her, but what on earth has that got to do with me). A stand out fight I remember left us both in tears, and my cousin had been sitting near us and was like OP, why are you letting this happen. At the time I had a new friendship with this other girl who we'll call Elena. I also confided in Elena about it, and she was equally shocked at best friend's behaviour considering they were friends too. The day I got home I scheduled a session with my therapist and got everything out in the open, and essentially concluded that she was no longer benefitting my life in a positive way, and that I could definitely live without her. I made the decision to cut her off, not lightly, and started distancing myself from her at the start of that school year. It didn't really work, but me and Elena still began to get closer. This will become important later. I gave up my distancing plans when the most traumatising thing that's ever happened to me happened in my personal life. I will be scarred for life by this, but won't go into detail as it is still painful. Elena did her very best to support me through this, best friend thought it would be tasteful to make a joke about it in front of my entire family less than 2 weeks after... go figure.

When I started to recover from this incident I began my life as normal. I did normal teenage girl things. I went to houseparties, drank, started going out with boys etc. Best friend did not want to do this, I respected her decisions. But she always had some holier than thou complex. Whenever she would ask about an encounter with a boy I would get somewhat of a disgusted look after I told her or I was told ""I would never have done that in front of that many people"" etc etc. In her eyes I had basically become a whore lol. That summer I remember she had gone away for a few weeks and me and Elena ofc became even closer as I wasn't gonna sit at home waiting for best friend to get back. Then, best friend and I had a miscommunication. I honestly don't remember what it was over, it was so insignificant, but we went no contact for nearly a month. I came back from my vacation and we both had a sit down conversation over coffee, and she basically accused me of everything under the sun. She said I was destroying my life, and that I wasn't coping with the traumatic incident well, (basically accused me of turning to alcohol, but I hadn't drank in about 3 months I'd say). Also revealed she had been stalking my location and was hurt that I was with Elena a lot, but I found it unsettling she was stalking my location anyway. She's always hated when I have had other friends. Somehow we resumed our ""friendship"" after this but as you can imagine it was starting to crumble. I think by November we were pretty much not speaking, on and off maybe but it was rare. Nothing happened other than her self righteousness was actually pissing a lot of people off, not just me, so I had more people to stand in solidarity with me sort of. We barely have had interaction since. She made a few snide remarks about me here and there, and she also made a joke about SH that was actually vile. We also got eachother birthday presents for inexplicable reasons, and she was invited to my birthday but declined the invite.

Honestly I do feel guilty sometimes. She did want to keep up the friendship, but at what cost? My mental health? Hers? This was always going be the outcome, but I thought we would naturally drift after we graduated, I guess not. She's also been spreading lies about me regarding a situation that happened with a mutual friend of ours that could genuinely ruin my reputation. I don't hate anyone, but I can honestly say I really strongly dislike her as a person. I never thought I'd see the day that would've happened but here we are. She enrages me on another level, and I cannot fathom how she could treat me of all people this way.

For anyone who made it this far and is wondering, me and Elena are best friends. She is genuinely my platonic soulmate and I love her with my whole heart, something I could never have said about ex best friend. At least I'm being treated well now, but I still get angry over this situation often.",1,1730940689.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

Another note is I've been dealing with anxiety related to work and spiraling alot the last year and that's been consistent but the last 2 days have been good from an anxiety standpoint. 

Anyways wondering some other people's experiences when starting medication, specifically with Vivanse! ",1,1730940525.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

1gle3e4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyperhidrosis/comments/1gle3e4/what_is_causing_this_odd_case_for_me/,What is causing this? Odd case for me,"19 year old male, I suffer from primarily a sweaty back, face, chest, and butt-region.

Used to run a lot in high school, still run occasionally, but not so much anymore. I would get quite sweaty in HS running, but it never impacted me outside of running. Issue got worse during my freshman year of college, and has reached an absolute breaking point now:

Any sort of walking outside triggers it. I used to think it was anxiety related, and definitely it does happen with that sometimes, but the walking is the big issue with this one. It's like I get a hot flash or feeling in my body and I can tell that I'm going to pour sweat.

Also, if I'm walking and then have to stop and stand still (e.g. in line), then I will absolutely pour once I stop, oddly enough.

I can go to the gym, which is air conditioned, and have a workout with lifting weights where I get far less sweaty than walking around a city for a half-hour.

It's not localized to any one area, rather it is my entire body that sweats (minus hands, feet). I'm a healthy weight and workout a lot, don't eat the best diet since I'm at college but it isn't terrible.

I tried cutting out coffee, it didn't help much. Exercise in the morning doesn't really help me for the rest of the day.   
It is also incredibly variable from day to day -- I can have a warm day where its 70 degrees and I'm doing a lot better walking around than on a 40 degree day with a strong breeze.

Went to the doctor, all my levels were fine and they just told me to go to a dermatologist.

  
What could help me with this? I'm confident that its solvable because it wasn't always like this for me. Also, primary hyperhidrosis usually is localized to one area, while this is really my entire body that sweats. If I'm sitting down its fine typically (no sweat)

It feels like a temperature regulation issue, and I find it so odd that some days are arbitrarily much better than others while some days are awful.

Things like iontophoresis and wipes are not an option for me given that it is my entire body.

Someone please help and let me know what I could do to solve this? Elimination diet? Supplements? ",1,1730940389.0,Hyperhidrosis,1,1.0,False
