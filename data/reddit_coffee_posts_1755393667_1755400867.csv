*By Your Humble Sportswriter, Who Still Thinks a ""Curveball"" Is a Type of Yoga*

---

**Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?**  
The books are screaming “Lotte Giants, baby!” like a toddler with a megaphone. Across all major platforms, the Giants are the -150 to -160 favorites (decimal odds \~1.58–1.62), implying a **61.5%–62.5% chance to win**. The Samsung Lions, meanwhile, sit at +225 to +236 (decimal \~2.25–2.36), translating to a **31.5%–43.5% implied probability**. That’s a *huge* gap in baseball terms—like the difference between a perfectly executed bunt and a player tripping over first base while trying to touch it.

The spread reinforces this: Lotte is -1.5 runs, Samsung +1.5. The total runs line is locked at **9.5**, with even money on Over/Under. Given Lotte’s dominance in the odds, expect a low-scoring game unless Samsung’s bats decide to wake up from a 10-year hibernation.

---

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Updates, and Why Your Team’s Mascot Is a Jerk**  
Let’s start with the **Lotte Giants**, who are as stable as a yoga instructor on a trampoline. Their ace, **Jung Hwan-sik**, is back from a “mysterious elbow injury” that turned out to be him accidentally leaning on his phone during a Zoom meeting. His return is a game-changer—assuming he doesn’t spend the game side-eyeing the umpire for calling a strike zone that doesn’t align with his coffee order preferences.

The Giants’ offense? A well-oiled machine with a .289 team batting average. Their third baseman, **Choi Ji-man**, is hitting .333 this season, which is either a sign of skill or proof that he’s secretly a robot named “Choi Batbot.”

Now, the **Samsung Lions**… oh, the Lions. Their star outfielder, **Lee Dae-ho**, is “day-to-day” with a hamstring injury he suffered while *practicing yoga to improve flexibility*. Samsung’s pitching staff? A rollercoaster of inconsistency. Their starter, \*\*

Our family has cruised quite a bit and know what to expect… we had a blast. We are not huge party people but we did get the drink package at 50% off and loved not having to think about it while cruising. Whether for specialty coffees or bottled waters or drinks, this was a win and we’d never bought it on our other cruises. 
The staff was amazing and I’m not kidding. Our last cruise was on carnival and I got off thinking I may not want to cruise again. To be fair it rained the whole trip and the crew was miserable and didn’t want to be there and I was with them. But this was an entirely different experience. We had been on allure twice on 7 night sailings but this service just seemed exceptional compared to any other cruise. We talked to a lot of the staff when we could, they seem happy and grateful and have worked for RC for anywhere from 8-24 years. 
CocoCay was so nice, we did hideaway beach and really enjoyed the pool with swim up bar and also the beach. Bathrooms were clean. Food was ok, not great here.
Main dining food however seemed better than I remember. Enjoyed everything especially the French onion soup.  Windjammer was decent just busy. Loved the solarium, hung out here the most. Ate breakfast and lunch here a few times also and had good experiences. 
We loved the schooner bar the most and the piano bar music. Aqua80s was amazing. Getting in and off the ship was so simple and quick, like nothing I’ve ever experienced and such a nice surprise! Loved the new elevator setup.. win! 
Thought 4 nights was perfect. We stayed on the ship in Nassau. Used the fitness center a few times and it was very nice. Utopia was very similar to allure… Great weather helped us have a great trip! ",1,1755400515.0,royalcaribbean,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **KT Wiz vs. Kiwoom Heroes: A KBO Showdown of Giants and Goats**  
*August 17, 2025 — 5:00 AM (UTC)*

The KBO’s latest clash pits the **KT Wiz** against the **Kiwoom Heroes**, a matchup as balanced as a batter’s swing—unless you ask the odds, which treat this like a one-sided math test. Let’s break it down with the precision of a catcher blocking a pitch and the humor of a fan eating a hot dog in the 9th inning of a 12-12 game.

---

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

The betting market is screaming: **KT Wiz is the clear favorite**. Decimal odds of 1.5 (roughly -200 in American) imply a **60% chance of victory**, while Kiwoom Heroes’ 2.5 odds (roughly +250) suggest they’re the underdog equivalent of a “maybe” on a pop quiz.

The spread reinforces this: KT Wiz is giving 1.5 runs (-150 odds), meaning they’re expected to win by at least two. For Kiwoom to cover, they’d need to either A) invent a time machine to undo this game’s odds or B) unleash a rally so dramatic it makes *The Lion King*’s “Circle of Life” segment blush.

The total is set at 8.5 runs, with the **Over** priced at 1.8 (implied 55.6%) and the Under at 1.95 (51.3%). Given KT’s dominant pitching and Kiwoom’s offense that’s about as loud as a whisper, the Under might be the safer bet unless someone spills a Gatorade bucket on the field.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Absurdity, and a Sprained Metaphor

KT Wiz enters this game with the health of a 30-year-old in a 20-year-old’s body. Their ace, **Jung Woo-ram**, is riding a seven-game win streak, his fastball as consistent as your morning coffee habit. Meanwhile, their bullpen? A well-oiled machine that’s struck out 32 batters in 24 innings this month.

Kiwoom Heroes, meanwhile, are playing with one hand tied behind their back (probably from tying their shoelaces too tightly). Their star slugger, **Choi Ji-hwan**, is sidelined with a “mild hamstring strain” sustained while

Trevor found the interior of Aisling Inn put him off balance as much as the bourbon had. The ceiling reached out at odd angles that canted inward and then out again on its way up to what was presumably the apex of the middle spire. The balcony of a second floor was visible, but dipped behind seemingly random pieces of wall, each of which held a variation of the same abstract mural; inverted pyramids pierced in and out of each other to both complete and interrupt their lines. Skylights cut into the idiosyncratic design, allowing the harsh red of twilight to spill into the foyer. They made their way past a large stone fireplace that sat unlit in the corner with a small group of comfortable looking chairs gathered in a semi-circle around it.  Across the floor was red and orange carpeting that looked to be covered in a type of foreign alphabet he couldn’t quite place. 

Arthur stopped them in front of a large greeting desk. Behind it stood a tall woman in a gray dress suit with brown hair wrapped into a tight and modest bun. Her nose and chin were sharp and her eyes were bright green. “I see my husband has brought home a stray,” she said with the same odd accent as Rory. Her thin lips tilted to one side in a smirk.

“Aye, and the man needs some rest.” Arthur leaned across the desk and planted a kiss on the woman’s cheek. “Dillon, this is my wife, Agneta. Agneta, this here’s Dillon; a wayward soul in need of sanctuary.”

Trevor offered a wavering hand to shake and Agneta took it lightly. Her skin was smooth and warm against his and he felt himself longing to hold onto it for too long. “My pleasure,” he uttered. 

She held his stare. “Indeed. A bit too much of the local concoction, I see?”

Trevor smiled, embarrassed. “Just a bit stronger than I expected.” He found himself consciously drawing his shoulders back to stand up straight in her presence.

Arthur patted him on the back, knocking him back off balance once more. “Well, I’ll leave you to it. I’ve got to follow up with Rory before I turn in. Need to be sure he’s learned his lesson.” He winked at Trevor and strolled back across the lobby and out the doors. 

Agneta produced a large metal key from behind the counter. “I’ll show you to your room.”

“Great,” Trevor croaked nervously. He swallowed at the knot that formed in his throat.

“Follow me.” 

As she made her way over to the stairway next to the counter, Trevor followed. Before meeting her at the bottom step, in an absentminded move, he removed his wedding ring and dropped it into his pocket.

Their footsteps were soft against the carpeted steps. *Intimate* was the word he found coming to mind. Trevor’s eyes fell onto her lithe claves that flexed as each high heel clad foot found purchase.  Rita had worn heels the night he had met her. They had walked around the block from the small coffee shop where the date had started and his eyes had wandered just the same then. *Just the same as you did with Ellen*. 

He broke the suffocating silence. “Some interesting design choices going on in here.”

“Oh yes,” she said without turning. “Our founders brought over their love for art from home. It’s not so much tradition as it informs a certain way of life here.”

The statue of the child with empty eyes and the ram-horned snake passed through Trevor’s mind. “Where exactly is that? Home, I mean?”

“The farthest back we can find is from when the Norsemen held control over the Rìoghachd nan Eilean; what you would know as the Isle of Mann.”

*That explains the accents.* “That’s quite a history.” 

“Indeed. We’ve carried on many things from the old days.” They reached the second floor, but she stopped and nodded to something hanging above them. A wooden plaque of similar design to the one hung at the bar was nestled into the wall above them. “IN THE LAND OF PLENTY, WOMEN SERVE THE NEED”. 

Trevor couldn’t help but ascribe his shameful and sudden feelings to its words. *Why did she point it out? She’s just ribbing you. You’re drunk, don’t be stupid.* He realized she had already started down the hall and hurried after her. 

As he caught up with her, she stopped in front of room 217 and held out the key to him. “This will be yours.”

With fingers he hoped she didn’t notice were shaking, he took the key. “Thank you.” He expected her to walk back downstairs, but instead, she simply stepped aside. Carefully, he slid the shaft of the key into the lock and felt the teeth brush against the tumblers as it drove home. Blood coursed through his body and into his brain and the lightheadedness he was struggling with from the local brew was enhanced. 

*Something’s not right…*

The key turned, but not without considerable effort. He could hear the bolt shift within the door. Sweat filmed over his palms, causing them to slide a bit on the heavy copper knob as he turned it.

The room was quaint.  Wallpaper wrapped around with abstract stalks of corn rising to the ceiling at canted angles. A single bed with brown linens sat against the wall. Thick curtains of a royal green covered all but a crack of the twilight beyond a window. 

“I hope you find this comfortable.” Agneta had stepped in behind him. Close enough that he could smell her sweet perfume. 

Trevor found that he wanted to draw her closer. He pictured himself wrapping his arm around her waist to feel her hips press against his.

*Stop. What the hell has gotten into you?*

Agneta placed a hand on the door. He noticed her smooth fingers that tapered off into well kept and shaped nails. 

“Thank you, it looks very nice,” he said, clearing his throat.

Agneta gave a knowing smile. “Then if there’s nothing more I can offer you I’ll be on my way.”

He nodded and offered a good-natured wave.

“Good night, Trevor,” she said as she closed the door.



5



*That’s not what she said, that’s not what she said…*

Trevor sat on the edge of the bed, eyes locked onto the light reaching under the locked door. He had sat as such for the past 45 minutes, attempting to convince himself that it had been a slip up in his mind. There was no reason for Agneta to know his real name. It was impossible. 

*But is it? Did she take your ID?*

With fingers that didn’t have all of their feelings he fumbled his wallet out of his back pocket and produced his driver’s license. *Trevor Dillon Ander*. It had been safely tucked away so there was no way that she could know.

He couldn’t place why the idea troubled him so; Arthur seemed good-natured enough, if not a little prying. The bartender was a bit impatient, true. The machines Rory had spoken of also crept back into his mind. *Lost in the corn, they were...in the corn. In the Land of Plenty.*

“Plenty of bullshit,” he said to the empty room. 

He decided that he would set his alarm for early in the morning, and get out of dodge before any more peculiar locals decided to introduce themselves.

He lay back into the bed and closed his eyes.

*...in the corn…*

*...you’ll find paradise...*



6



*Corn surrounds him. Above there is nothing; instead there is the void. No stars, no moon, no sun. Only dark that presses in. Corn rises in canted, unreal, pastel stalks that blur his vision. But he can hear a voice.*

*“Trevor? Why?” It’s a woman.*

*He moves toward it, parting the stalks as if swimming through them. Somehow he is able to see in spite of the seeming antimatter above.* 

*More voices rise from ahead of him. They are chanting something, but it's deep enough to be more of a rumble rising from beneath the earth than sounds produced by vocal chords.* 

*“Why were you late?” He knows that voice. It is Rita. He recognizes it as the question that burned into his brain and into his heart that night. But how had they brought her here,*

*(to paradise)*

*and why is she bringing this up now?*

*The chanting grows as he draws nearer to them. There are words he does not know the meaning of. But he can hear the purpose that lies beyond his understanding. “Zaahat Kall…Zaahat Kall…” It drones on, increasing in intensity with each repetition.*

*“You were late and it all fell apart.*”

*He breaks into a clearing where a large circle of naked, faceless figures sway gently, like corn in the wind. Dots of red sit in the shadow where their faces are not. Beyond the circle stands the statue of the child, with streams of blood pouring from its empty eye sockets past its manic smile. In the middle of the circle is a woman tied to a large post.* 

*It’s Rita. Her face is calm and her fiery hair dances in a wind that doesn’t exist. “You were late and they lost the machines. Lost paradise…”*

*The circle stops their swaying and the shadow faces, with their crimson eyes, turn to look at him.* 

*Trevor wishes to run, but is paralyzed by their sight and their chant that grows ever louder. “Zaahat Kall...Zaahat Kall…”*

*The woman is now different. The red hair  has turned brunette and wrapped into a tight bun. She is wearing a gray dress suit. It is now Ellen tied to the post. She is crying and wrenching against her binds. “Why, Trevor? Why did you do this to me?”* 

*He remembers that night, all of the nights. The reasons Rita left that he continues to push down inside. He can’t be late. Rita will suspect. He was late from the start.*

*Ellen is now a woman in dirty trousers and a shirt torn to shreds. Her engorged breasts are exposed and her stomach hangs loosely, deflated, and dripping with blood. She sobs at him. “Why? You were late, yet you return. The machines!”*

*A horrendous, metallic grinding erupts from behind him.* 

*The chanting grows. “Zaahat Kall…”*

*The circle raises their hands to the void.*

*As the metal on metal roar grows closer he looks up to see Agneta descend from the nothing. She is adorned in a billowing dress of red and black. Somehow he can tell the void flows from her. Her voice booms around him. “Paradise will rise!”*

*The grinding is deafening as it’s joined by the chant. It envelops him.*



7



Trevor awoke plummeting from the bed onto the floor. Before he realized what was happening, his forehead and nose crashed into the unforgiving hardwood. The room spun as he tried to piece everything together. 

*The land of plenty...remember?* 

A groan escaped him as he rolled onto his back. He gently rubbed his face and examined his fingers. 

*No blood, at least you didn’t break your nose.*

The thought of blood brought everything back into clarity. *Why did you return?* Though words uttered within a dream they still held a terrifying weight over his head. He climbed to his feet and checked his phone for the time. His own reflection stared back, darkened by the unilluminated screen. 

“Dead already?” He held the power button down, but the screen remained a defiant black. Had he overslept? Doubtful; he could still feel the heaviness of the alcohol in his head. He brushed his back pocket and found the keys bulging against the denim. 

*Just leave.* 

Trevor found that to be enough of a plan. The combination of the town’s odd symbolism and his unsettling dream was enough to wish for the simplicity of empty cornfields once again.

He walked to the door and stuffed his phone back into his pocket, feeling the cold metal of his wedding band still nestled away. Guilt threatened to overwhelm him. *Stop, now’s not the time*. He slipped it back onto his hand and turned the knob.

As he opened the door his hand instinctively came up to shield his eyes. “What the hell…” A searing red light pierced through the skylights of the lobby and bathed every corner of the large room in crimson. 

Dull nausea rose in his stomach. He approached the railing of the second floor balcony as if edging towards a cliff. In an attempt to see what would cause such a phenomenon, he squinted his eyes against the harsh light. The apex of the middle spire disappeared behind a glare that spread across the windows, as if large stage lights had been placed atop the hotel. 

With one hand gripping the railing, Trevor made his way to the stairs. As he moved, the shadows of the canted, ascending ceiling designs danced and the inverted pyramids quivered. The optical illusion made him feel as if he were traversing the innards of some long forgotten beast, ageless and cosmic in scale. *Half-buried in an earth unable to hide it.* He shuddered and quickened his steps.

He was thankful for the carpeted stairs as he hoped to make his exit with as little noise as possible. Something was wrong in Rickledge and he had no intention of finding out what it was. His feet came to the ground floor and he fished out his keys as he half jogged towards the double doors. 

A creak sounded to his left and he froze. He suddenly became aware of the noise of crackling fire. Panic crept up his throat as he slowly turned to the fireplace. The semi-circle of leather chairs were now occupied by older men and women. Their faces were all twisted into a rictus grin, as if they had been waiting for him eagerly. Their eyes were all locked on him as flames danced in place of their pupils.

“Oh, fuck this.” Trevor bolted for the front doors. He could hear the scrape of the chairs’ legs against the floor behind him and knew he wouldn’t have long. His hand found the handle and pressed down on it as he threw his shoulder into the door. He nearly stumbled over his own feet as it swung open.

He looked into the sky and his mouth hung open in shock at what he saw. *Hell must be spilling over.* There were no stars, no sun, no moon. Only red. The brewery stood dark, unlit against the bloodied horizon. Its parking lot was empty and his stomach knotted as he realized his car was nowhere to be found.

A voice behind him broke his horrified reverie. From within the hotel, “Who’s the idiot who left the doors unlocked?” 

He ran towards the brewery, away from the mad people with fire eyes. As he crossed the street he could hear the doors burst open once again and the same voice cry out, “There he goes!” 

Trevor scanned his options and knew there was only one. He ran into the corn.

He broke the suffocating silence. “Some interesting design choices going on in here.”

“Oh yes,” she said without turning. “Our founders brought over their love for art from home. It’s not so much tradition as it informs a certain way of life here.”

The statue of the child with empty eyes and the ram-horned snake passed through Trevor’s mind. “Where exactly is that? Home, I mean?”

“The farthest back we can find is from when the Norsemen held control over the Rìoghachd nan Eilean; what you would know as the Isle of Mann.”

*That explains the accents.* “That’s quite a history.” 

“Indeed. We’ve carried on many things from the old days.” They reached the second floor, but she stopped and nodded to something hanging above them. A wooden plaque of similar design to the one hung at the bar was nestled into the wall above them. “IN THE LAND OF PLENTY, WOMEN SERVE THE NEED”. 

Trevor couldn’t help but ascribe his shameful and sudden feelings to its words. *Why did she point it out? She’s just ribbing you. You’re drunk, don’t be stupid.* He realized she had already started down the hall and hurried after her. 

As he caught up with her, she stopped in front of room 217 and held out the key to him. “This will be yours.”

With fingers he hoped she didn’t notice were shaking, he took the key. “Thank you.” He expected her to walk back downstairs, but instead, she simply stepped aside. Carefully, he slid the shaft of the key into the lock and felt the teeth brush against the tumblers as it drove home. Blood coursed through his body and into his brain and the lightheadedness he was struggling with from the local brew was enhanced. 

*Something’s not right…*

The key turned, but not without considerable effort. He could hear the bolt shift within the door. Sweat filmed over his palms, causing them to slide a bit on the heavy copper knob as he turned it.

The room was quaint.  Wallpaper wrapped around with abstract stalks of corn rising to the ceiling at canted angles. A single bed with brown linens sat against the wall. Thick curtains of a royal green covered all but a crack of the twilight beyond a window. 

“I hope you find this comfortable.” Agneta had stepped in behind him. Close enough that he could smell her sweet perfume. 

Trevor found that he wanted to draw her closer. He pictured himself wrapping his arm around her waist to feel her hips press against his.

*Stop. What the hell has gotten into you?*

Agneta placed a hand on the door. He noticed her smooth fingers that tapered off into well kept and shaped nails. 

“Thank you, it looks very nice,” he said, clearing his throat.

Agneta gave a knowing smile. “Then if there’s nothing more I can offer you I’ll be on my way.”

He nodded and offered a good-natured wave.

“Good night, Trevor,” she said as she closed the door.

*That’s not what she said, that’s not what she said…*

Trevor sat on the edge of the bed, eyes locked onto the light reaching under the locked door. He had sat as such for the past 45 minutes, attempting to convince himself that it had been a slip up in his mind. There was no reason for Agneta to know his real name. It was impossible. 

*But is it? Did she take your ID?*

With fingers that didn’t have all of their feelings he fumbled his wallet out of his back pocket and produced his driver’s license. *Trevor Dillon Ander*. It had been safely tucked away so there was no way that she could know.

He couldn’t place why the idea troubled him so; Arthur seemed good-natured enough, if not a little prying. The bartender was a bit impatient, true. The machines Rory had spoken of also crept back into his mind. *Lost in the corn, they were...in the corn. In the Land of Plenty.*

“Plenty of bullshit,” he said to the empty room. 

He decided that he would set his alarm for early in the morning, and get out of dodge before any more peculiar locals decided to introduce themselves.

He lay back into the bed and closed his eyes.

*...in the corn…*

*...you’ll find paradise...*

*Corn surrounds him. Above there is nothing; instead there is the void. No stars, no moon, no sun. Only dark that presses in. Corn rises in canted, unreal, pastel stalks that blur his vision. But he can hear a voice.*

*“Trevor? Why?” It’s a woman.*

*He moves toward it, parting the stalks as if swimming through them. Somehow he is able to see in spite of the seeming antimatter above.* 

*More voices rise from ahead of him. They are chanting something, but it's deep enough to be more of a rumble rising from beneath the earth than sounds produced by vocal chords.* 

*“Why were you late?” He knows that voice. It is Rita. He recognizes it as the question that burned into his brain and into his heart that night. But how had they brought her here,*

*(to paradise)*

*and why is she bringing this up now?*

*The chanting grows as he draws nearer to them. There are words he does not know the meaning of. But he can hear the purpose that lies beyond his understanding. “Zaahat Kall…Zaahat Kall…” It drones on, increasing in intensity with each repetition.*

*“You were late and it all fell apart.*”

*He breaks into a clearing where a large circle of naked, faceless figures sway gently, like corn in the wind. Dots of red sit in the shadow where their faces are not. Beyond the circle stands the statue of the child, with streams of blood pouring from its empty eye sockets past its manic smile. In the middle of the circle is a woman tied to a large post.* 

*It’s Rita. Her face is calm and her fiery hair dances in a wind that doesn’t exist. “You were late and they lost the machines. Lost paradise…”*

*The circle stops their swaying and the shadow faces, with their crimson eyes, turn to look at him.* 

*Trevor wishes to run, but is paralyzed by their sight and their chant that grows ever louder. “Zaahat Kall...Zaahat Kall…”*

*The woman is now different. The red hair  has turned brunette and wrapped into a tight bun. She is wearing a gray dress suit. It is now Ellen tied to the post. She is crying and wrenching against her binds. “Why, Trevor? Why did you do this to me?”* 

*He remembers that night, all of the nights. The reasons Rita left that he continues to push down inside. He can’t be late. Rita will suspect. He was late from the start.*

*Ellen is now a woman in dirty trousers and a shirt torn to shreds. Her engorged breasts are exposed and her stomach hangs loosely, deflated, and dripping with blood. She sobs at him. “Why? You were late, yet you return. The machines!”*

*A horrendous, metallic grinding erupts from behind him.* 

*The chanting grows. “Zaahat Kall…”*

*The circle raises their hands to the void.*

*As the metal on metal roar grows closer he looks up to see Agneta descend from the nothing. She is adorned in a billowing dress of red and black. Somehow he can tell the void flows from her. Her voice booms around him. “Paradise will rise!”*

*The grinding is deafening as it’s joined by the chant. It envelops him.*

Trevor awoke plummeting from the bed onto the floor. Before he realized what was happening, his forehead and nose crashed into the unforgiving hardwood. The room spun as he tried to piece everything together. 

*The land of plenty...remember?* 

A groan escaped him as he rolled onto his back. He gently rubbed his face and examined his fingers. 

*No blood, at least you didn’t break your nose.*

The thought of blood brought everything back into clarity. *Why did you return?* Though words uttered within a dream they still held a terrifying weight over his head. He climbed to his feet and checked his phone for the time. His own reflection stared back, darkened by the unilluminated screen. 

“Dead already?” He held the power button down, but the screen remained a defiant black. Had he overslept? Doubtful; he could still feel the heaviness of the alcohol in his head. He brushed his back pocket and found the keys bulging against the denim. 

*Just leave.* 

Trevor found that to be enough of a plan. The combination of the town’s odd symbolism and his unsettling dream was enough to wish for the simplicity of empty cornfields once again.

He walked to the door and stuffed his phone back into his pocket, feeling the cold metal of his wedding band still nestled away. Guilt threatened to overwhelm him. *Stop, now’s not the time*. He slipped it back onto his hand and turned the knob.

As he opened the door his hand instinctively came up to shield his eyes. “What the hell…” A searing red light pierced through the skylights of the lobby and bathed every corner of the large room in crimson. 

Dull nausea rose in his stomach. He approached the railing of the second floor balcony as if edging towards a cliff. In an attempt to see what would cause such a phenomenon, he squinted his eyes against the harsh light. The apex of the middle spire disappeared behind a glare that spread across the windows, as if large stage lights had been placed atop the hotel. 

With one hand gripping the railing, Trevor made his way to the stairs. As he moved, the shadows of the canted, ascending ceiling designs danced and the inverted pyramids quivered. The optical illusion made him feel as if he were traversing the innards of some long forgotten beast, ageless and cosmic in scale. *Half-buried in an earth unable to hide it.* He shuddered and quickened his steps.

He was thankful for the carpeted stairs as he hoped to make his exit with as little noise as possible. Something was wrong in Rickledge and he had no intention of finding out what it was. His feet came to the ground floor and he fished out his keys as he half jogged towards the double doors. 

A creak sounded to his left and he froze. He suddenly became aware of the noise of crackling fire. Panic crept up his throat as he slowly turned to the fireplace. The semi-circle of leather chairs were now occupied by older men and women. Their faces were all twisted into a rictus grin, as if they had been waiting for him eagerly. Their eyes were all locked on him as flames danced in place of their pupils.

“Oh, fuck this.” Trevor bolted for the front doors. He could hear the scrape of the chairs’ legs against the floor behind him and knew he wouldn’t have long. His hand found the handle and pressed down on it as he threw his shoulder into the door. He nearly stumbled over his own feet as it swung open.

He looked into the sky and his mouth hung open in shock at what he saw. *Hell must be spilling over.* There were no stars, no sun, no moon. Only red. The brewery stood dark, unlit against the bloodied horizon. Its parking lot was empty and his stomach knotted as he realized his car was nowhere to be found.

A voice behind him broke his horrified reverie. From within the hotel, “Who’s the idiot who left the doors unlocked?” 

He ran towards the brewery, away from the mad people with fire eyes. As he crossed the street he could hear the doors burst open once again and the same voice cry out, “There he goes!” 

Trevor scanned his options and knew there was only one. He ran into the corn.

1msfyud,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1msfyud/the_narrative_of_gaza_being_an_openair_prison/,The Narrative of Gaza Being an Open-Air Prison,"For decades, we’ve been hearing that Gaza is an open-air prison, and whenever news pieces would talk about it, they’d include images of refugee camps in Gaza. Israelis would counter that Gaza is full of shopping malls and universities and luxury items that in no way resemble being imprisoned, but they’d largely be ignored as spreading propaganda etc. 

Pro-Palestinian accounts would also selectively focus only on the hardships in Gaza, to continue driving this narrative of all Gazans being poor suffering refugees locked in prison. And even pro-Israeli accounts, bizarrely, would accuse Gazans of having been left with a beautiful territory and destroying it, as if Gaza wasn’t full of new buildings, well-funded schools and hospitals (in addition to the terror tunnels.) 

And to be clear, I don’t deny that the *current* situation in Gaza is terrible. I don’t even deny that Gazans have been under a military occupation, with their borders, sea, sky, imports, exports, and other things controlled by Israel, all of which limited their economic growth, to some extent. (The economic slump was more due to Hamas than Israel, because the unemployment rate in Gaza was at nearly 50% even before this conflict, but the unemployment rate in the West Bank was around 12%, despite the West Bank being under a military occupation as well.)

I follow Palestinian accounts on social media to get a first-person perspective of events unfolding on the ground in Gaza and the West Bank, and while a lot of it obviously skews heavily towards bombed-out buildings and death, there’s been a growing trend of Gazans posting how wonderful and beautiful their lives were in August 2023 compared to their lives now in August 2025. 

These videos show them eating out at restaurants, getting iced coffees and pizza and shawarma, clean streets with colorful string lights and vibrant nightlife, fresh flowers and chocolates, beautiful clothing and luxury goods. 

And the comments are filled with supportive people saying things like “so sad, hope you can have this again someday” which is all well and good, but is no one questioning *how* all this existed in a supposed open-air prison? 

Why can Gazans only talk about all the beauty and luxury after it’s destroyed? Is it because it would have contradicted the “open-air prison” narrative? 

And do people really not realize, when they see these videos posted by Gazans themselves, that life in the West Bank right now looks exactly like that? 

Yes, people in the West Bank suffer from injustice, harassment, violence, etc. Yet at the same time, the majority of them are living the same kind of full, enriched lives that people in Israel or in any other developed country are experiencing. 

Being a critical consumer of content means that sometimes you have to notice what’s *missing.* 

If before the war, 100% of content you saw about Gaza revolved around it being a sad oppressed open-air prison full of sad oppressed refugees, there was information *missing.*

If 100% of the content you see about the West Bank involves checkpoints, settler violence, IDF harassment, etc. - there is information *missing*. 

You have never gotten the full picture, and you will continue not getting the full picture, unless you actively seek it out, and even then there will be pieces missing. 

Yes, there are actually poor Palestinians suffering. But if 100% of the content you see about Palestinians is their suffering, you’re being lied to by omission. ",4,1755400148.0,IsraelPalestine,3,0.83,False

1msfy1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1msfy1h/transitioning_from_anxious_to_secure_slow_burn/,Transitioning from anxious to secure / slow burn vibes?,"Hey everyone,

I (29M) recently noticed a pattern in my dating life. I’ve historically had more of an anxious attachment style. So when a girl gives me attention, validation, or is constantly texting, I latch on quickly. I end up equating frequent texting with emotional intimacy, which has led me to rush things and create expectations too early.

After a recent experience, I’ve realised that texting ≠ emotional intimacy. It can be fun, but it’s not the same as actually building something deeper in person. I’m trying to shift towards a more secure attachment and focus on a slower burn.

After a lame situationship that got too fast too quick, I met a new girl (29F). We had a 1 hour coffee / walk date and it went well. After the date, I texted her to lock in a second date (today). Based on our chats, it seems she is already following that healthy template. She’s communicative, but not glued to her phone, and it actually feels a lot more grounded. We texted 1-2 times a day, until a few days ago where she outlined that she doesn't expect me to text her daily since we're still getting to know each other (this is after I sent an apology for not replying sooner, as I was busy with work). 

Today is the second date (picking her up then heading to a casual spot for dinner) and I want to keep things light, fun, and present, without slipping back into old anxious habits (like overanalyzing every pause in conversation or wondering if she “likes me enough”).

My question: What are your best tips for handling the second date with this mindset? How can I stay grounded, enjoy the moment, and build healthy momentum without overthinking?

Appreciate any advice from people who’ve been through this shift.",1,1755400076.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

   He calls me ""bestie"" although I believe it to be a sort of way he speaks with friends, he's the type to also call his friends ""Girllllll"" although I've noticed he has slowed to a stop after I mentioned I was nb.  


***Info dump ig:***  
   We talk daily online and are very relaxed and casual with each other. We have hung out irl but not by ourselves unless we were walking to class, although we do plan to meetup as he offered me to come to the gym with him and we talked about getting coffee together. I have offered to take him to a orchard which he said ""Honestly I would really like that"".  
   He mentioned how he loved we were opposites our gender preference of ships and I feel like he's been wanting to do things together more but idk.  
  
   We have many common interests and fandoms and have talked about ships. We usually chat about ones we like and I might be reading into it too much but when I saw him with a banner relating to this one character, I switched mine not long after to a character that is usually shipped with his; and he mentioned a few days after when we were talking about ships he suddenly mentioned how he liked those characters shipped together, it fit with the conversation yet it still felt a bit out of place in what we were talking about?  
   We're currently matching pfps with a characters who are from opposing families, and while he said he didn't know it was a ship I mentioned how I bet people shipped them- and it seems they are a somewhat popular enemy to lover type ship, and the artwork we are matching with is more 'shippy' then rivalry.  
  
   We send a lot of emoijs to each other and he does a lot of heart ones. He once gave me a small gift and even gave one to my sister even though they aren't really close, and when I sent a picture of a gift I was going to get him he send a emoji with heart eyes.

I'm applying to full-time, benefit-filled jobs left and right; I have a part time job for an after-school program which, so far, I'm enjoying quite a bit! However, it's an hour of biking everyday to make it there, or two hours of bus riding, during the hottest part of the summer. I'm very not used to doing that; I either had my own car or had people willing to drive me there. I'm AFAB and still somewhat look feminine so public transport wigs me out a lot. A lot of this is to suck it up and just do the biking / bus-riding / make friends with people with cars. I've asked my FOO (both my mom and stepdad) multiple times if they would cosign for a car loan for a cheap, but reliable car (like $13k or less) *three times in the past*. All of the times they were afraid of their credit score going down or not being able to get loans later. But then make the comment of ""oh honey if I could give you a car, I would"" WELL COSIGNING WOULD HELP ME GET A CAR, WOULDN'T IT?!?!? I had to ask my friends and THEIR family to cosign for a fucking loan and got rejected because of stuff that wasn't in their control. I've had car salespeople tell me it's hard to get a loan by myself with my slightly-below income, even when I show them my bills coming in are manageable and I can indeed pay for a car and insurance if they just give me the FUCKING chance. I was miserable under their roof, and their fighting, and the lack of space, and living in the same place where I was sexually assaulted by my sibling... I cannot go back to that. If I do I might actually hurt myself badly. I am not loved under their roof. I was told I was loved, but when I did something they didn't like, it became apparent that the love was transactional and can be taken back at any time.

My ex-partner had to do EVERYTHING for me. Cosign for my first apartment, help me move in and out, provide me rent while I did school, visited me up there... and then my family get up there for graduation and they just keep complaining about the commencement ""taking too long, we wanna go to the beach, we wanna go out to eat"" LIKE THEY HAVEN'T VISITED ME AT ALL UP HERE AND I HAD TO RENT OUT CARS FROM MY POCKET TO DRIVE 10+ HOURS TO VISIT THEM MULTIPLE TIMES A YEAR!!!!!!! And when they call, or when I ask to be driven to doctor's appointments or do errands and try and pretend to be friendly with them, my mom starts accusing me of ""hiding"" or ""being cold"" and being distant. I dunno, maybe actually being there for me would be nice? Maybe giving me room to grow and talk about my emotions instead of telling me to stop crying and not giving me help when I was sobbing and when I would fail in my classes, I would feel like a failure because school was my only outlet for my emotions and to feel wanted and included in something?!

And then they question me if moving out with a part-time job and no car is the ""best option right now"" because I could ""always move home and get a job with \[step-dad's name\]""... he works at a fucking grocery store and fucking hates it there. He does it because it's stable. I got a degree in fucking BIOLOGY. Took all these science and stats classes to get something that I like. I fell in love with teaching and supporting people in their educational journeys. I don't want to fucking stock shelves full time when this opportunity is right fucking there. With monthly professional development and mentorship opportunities. No-fucking-thank you.

I'm currently applying for part-time jobs that are within walking distance (mainly grocery, coffee shops, or retail) so that I can get more income and look better on loan applications. My credit is pretty alright, it's the income and lack of loan experience that is mostly turning them away. At this point I may go to less utilized loan services to see if they can do it. Or even do it straight up with the dealership. I don't know. At the very least, with my next paycheck, I want to get an e-bike conversion kit so the commute isn't so physically demanding on my body.

I'm tired of asking for help, and getting nothing, both in terms of money or emotional support. I get it, we didn't grow up rich. But we grew up with wiggle room and the ability and knowledge to do all of this. They just want to protect themselves. I fucking hate them. And when my mom texts me silly memes about me living with cats or to ""see how I'm doing,"" I see red. I feel so angry and tense and on edge when I see their name pop up when they call. Growing up, I felt like a emotional little kid, led by simple emotions - happy, sad, mad, angry, anxious, suicidal. But now, I feel like the hormonal teenager I wasn't allowed to be because of my SA; why did they do this to me? How do I manage money? How do I apply for jobs that are in the scientific field? How does my health insurance work? How do I engage with others meaningfully? What is my purpose? What is my higher calling?

*Who am I?*

I felt like they didn't really explain a lot at depth.  I still don't. I'm very fortunate to live apart from them currently, but it still doesn't change the fury in me, this urge to change and do better than they ever did - build financial wealth and stability for myself and the people I care about. And it starts with me, and only me. I can't wait around for them to change their minds. They had 25 to do that. And they failed.

I'm capable and ready. I am angry and ready to curb-stomp anything in my way. Is it a violent way to describe what I described? Yeah, definitely. But that drive keeps me going. Rage is the fuel to keep my engines running and I'm so fucking ready.",1,1755400027.0,EstrangedAdultKids,1,1.0,False

Research shows it's not just their ideas—it's how they tell their stories. A 2023 study from Stanford University (""The Neuroscience of Narrative Leadership""), led by Dr. Jennifer Aaker, found that leaders who master storytelling inspire 3x more followership and drive 57% higher team performance than those who rely solely on data.

https://preview.redd.it/jabawj0gxhjf1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a3439a07e8b9e5bfbfc1f75f66bb6b7f4697642



1. The Brain Science Behind Stories



The MIT Human Dynamics Lab (2022), directed by Dr. Alex Pentland, discovered that stories activate 7 different brain regions, while facts only engage 2. When tech entrepreneur Riya Patel presented her startup vision as a hero's journey rather than a pitch deck, she secured funding 40% faster. This aligns with findings from the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience (2021) showing stories are 22x more memorable than statistics alone.



2. The 3-Act Leadership Framework



Great leaders structure stories like Hollywood screenwriters:



Act 1 (Challenge):

""When I was 23, my first business failed...""

A Yale University study (2023) showed vulnerability increases trust by 68%.



Act 2 (Struggle):

""We faced 137 rejections before...""

The Harvard Business Review (2022) found perseverance stories boost team resilience by 83%.



Act 3 (Breakthrough):

""Then we discovered...""

Neuroscience research from UCLA (2021) proves hopeful endings trigger dopamine surges that motivate action.



3. Data Wrapped in Emotion



The University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School (2023) analyzed 500 executive speeches. Those blending statistics with personal anecdotes (like how economist David Lin explained inflation using his grandmother's grocery bills) were:

✓4x more persuasive

✓2x more likely to go viral



4. The ""Hero's Mirror"" Technique



Great leaders make audiences the protagonist. When educator Maya Fernández transformed her TED Talk from ""How I Built Schools"" to ""How You Can Change Education"", engagement skyrocketed 300%. This mirrors Princeton University findings (2022) that personalized stories activate the brain's ""ownership"" circuits.



5. Sensory Language = Neural Resonance



A University of Toronto study (2023) scanned brains during speeches. Phrases like ""the bitter coffee of 3 AM deadlines"" lit up sensory cortices, making messages:

•17% more credible

•42% more actionable



Why This Matters Now



The Global Leadership Communication Audit (2023) of 10,000 professionals revealed:

\- 91% prefer story-driven meetings over data dumps

\- Teams led by storytellers report 75% higher purpose alignment

\- Story-based strategies get 60% faster buy-in



Your Storytelling Starter Kit



1. Mine Your ""Origin Story""

(What shaped your leadership philosophy?)



2. Use the ""But/Therefore"" Rule

Replace ""and then"" with causal connectors for 39% more impact (Journal of Narrative Studies, 2023)



3. End With a ""Call to Adventure""

""This is our mountain—who's climbing with me?""



As leadership coach Elena Morales says: ""Facts tell, stories sell—but the best stories do both.""

I left what we'll call Brighton, Colorado. Spent a month chillin' at my brother's house. Played some guitar, got really fucked up a couple times, went to a killer place with some bands, and took a lot of naps with the cat and dog. It was great to see my brother again, and his wife who's cool as fuck. It had probably been almost twenty years.

Bailed out. Hit the ramp at 1:00. Gear down. Thumb out. Two hours later got a ride about ten miles north. Dropped off. Onto the next ramp. Fifteen minutes later got picked up for a four hundred mile ride.

Dude was highly intelligent. We talked about everything under the sun until 9:30 when he dropped me off. He gave me a brand new light-weight power cell before we parted ways. Truck stop. 

I bail out around the fence in the dark. I can see where they cut the grass down around the edge of the place, and then I spot it. Somebody mowed a small strip over to a nice sandy stream bed. Perfect spot. Level. Soft. No signs of other people. Nice and dark. Good cover from trees. No rain in the forecast.

Tent up. Gear in. Back over to truck stop for munchies. Back to tent. Munch down. Vape. Cigarette. Headphones in. The Table playing until I got sleepy. Out cold.

Today...
Up with the sun. Lounged around while I woke up fully. I knew it was gonna get hot quick. Got my gear together. Out of tent. Tent down and on pack. Cross the parking lot. Into truck stop. Friendly wave from truck stop employee. In the elevator, upstairs to truckers lounge. Gear down. Phones charging.

Back down. Coffee. Sausage egg and cheese breakfast sandwich. 
Outside to smoke. Back up to lounge. Phones charged. '10:00. Time to get this show on the road.'

Gear up. Out to ramp. Gear down. Thumb out.  Smoke lit. Two drags. Van pulls over with a seventy-five year old woman in it. Dropped smoke on the ground. 'Hopefully somebody else finds this when they need it.' Gear up. Over to van. ""I can get you to Lincoln."" ""That would be great."" ""Ok. Put your stuff in the back."" Off we go.

Good conversation. Eighty-four miles later I get dropped off. Out to ramp. I turned down three rides in twenty minutes because they were going to a freeway split with no ramps.

Another twenty minutes goes by 
A woman I would guess was about twenty years old stops. Mentions she's on her way to work here in town but will take me to Omaha first. I hop in.

Fifty miles later I'm past all the freeway splits. I have her drop me off. I felt she probably didn't have much experience with hitchhikers and didn't want to take advantage.

I head over to the on ramp. Weed, cigarette. A truck pulls over waaay down the ramp. I have a limit to how far I'm willing to walk since usually if someone does that they're gonna wait until you get close and bail. One, fuck all that. Two, I'm not trying to carry this fifty pound pack any farther than I have to. Also, some times people pull over that far up because they're doing something and don't want me walking up on them.

All the way through Nebraska there were 'no hitchhiking' signs on every ramp. I got a lot of friendly waves, people were genuinely nice, and it's some of the fastest hitchhiking I've done in years. And tons of butterflies everywhere.

It turns out dude went way up to where he could turn around and came back to get me. He takes me about eighty miles, tells me he found a back way to get to his place and runs me another thirty miles.

I get dropped at a gas station. A couple slices of pizza, sack of sliced pickles, and an apple juice later I head for the ramp.
No luck. It was over a hundred degrees. No shade. I bail after a little over an hour. I head back to the gas station to use the bathroom. Decided to take a break. Grabbed some grapes. Got the stool off my pack and chilled until it cooled down.

Back to the ramp. I spied a good spot for the tent earlier. Gave the old thumb another shot until the sun set. Waited for no cars, off to the spot.

So now I'm chillin' in the tent somewhere outside of Mound City, MO.

'So the state with no hitchhiking signs on every ramp is the best hitchhiking ever, and the state with zero signs anywhere is slow as fuck?' ",1,1755399845.0,vagabond,1,1.0,False

So I thought I was logging into my work Zoom. Easy, right? Nope. I accidentally clicked a random link.

Next thing I know… 50 strangers are staring at me. And I’m in my PJs. No shirt. Definitely no pants. 😳

I froze. My brain screamed: “Hit mute! Hit camera off!” but of course I fumbled. The host smiled and said, “Glad you could join us!”

Meanwhile, I’m trying to quietly sneak out, knocking over my coffee in the process… splash everywhere. Perfect.

I finally escape, and immediately send a frantic text to my friend: “I just joined a strangers’ meeting… naked. What do I do?!”

She replies: “Post it on TikTok. You’ll go viral.” And well… here we are. Lesson learned: always double-check the link… and maybe wear pants. 😅",1,1755399747.0,story,0,1.0,False

The Ambroisie, with its glossy dark chocolate glaze and delicate chocolate petals, was both visually striking and rich in flavor. The balance of deep chocolate tones with subtle layers inside gave it a refined complexity that lingered beautifully with each bite.

The coffee paired seamlessly, its straightforward bitterness cutting through the richness of the dessert. The clean finish of the coffee highlighted the elegance of the Ambroisie without overwhelming it, creating a perfect harmony.

The atmosphere of the cafe enhanced the experience even further, classical interiors, chandeliers, and a sense of timeless European elegance. It felt like stepping into another world where time slowed down😍",1,1755399626.0,u_5second10,0,1.0,False

A woman I feel in love with and dated for about a year ended the relationship. (33, Virgo, pansexual, cis-woman) she was reserved and as our dating went on I could feel her pull away, the day it ended she seemed different and annoyed. I can’t really tell facial expressions and I’m known to overthink words a lot so I am usually pretty straight forward with what I say and ask. When I asked if she was ok, she said fine. And said if you’re really fine that’s ok. But if you wanted to share anything else I would like to listen. She said no and we continued. She continued to be annoyed with me and goofing around a bit. When it came time for bed she said you could play fallout on Amazon. I said no way and she was full of it. She aggressively shows me the ad and asks, “why am I being such a little bitch today?” I froze, she never talked to me like that before. Were into some heavy bedroom play but humiliation was never on my list and nor hers so I knew she meant it. 

The next morning I was frozen in depression. The woman I grew to love and hope to start a relationship with just cut me down in a way I never knew. My insecurities were creeping in. I could hear my mother say, “no one will ever love you the way I do.” Look at it now it’s just a mother’s words towards their kids. But to me, and the many abusive and manipulative ex’s I was with and one engaged to saying the same thing to me. All I could hear was I was “unlovable, intolerable, useless, and crazy.” I finally arose and she had passively aggressively made me coffee and wouldn’t look at me. I gathered my courage to ask if we could talk about last night. She whips her head around and said “yeah, we should talk.” I tried to stay calm and not let an identity out because I’ve started EMDR a couple years prior and working on being primary and not disassociate in serious conversations. She kept getting defensive with everything I was saying. And I would ask questions about some things that were on my mind to try and understand, I noticed before bed a guy texted her a few times. I didn’t think anything of it till she called me a bitch that maybe she is on her way out? And so I asked if this plus this guy are some how connected. And she asked me my thoughts. “Well I grabbed your phone for you because you had wondered to bed without it so I grabbed it to give you and noticed this guys name and 4 unread texts. I wouldn’t ever think you’d cheat on me but maybe he was looking for closure on something, maybe he’s a friend that I haven’t met that needed a hand.” But before I could get to any of that she yelled at me and I disassociated and I guess I had yelled back and said something mean. I apologized and ask if we can try again and she wouldn’t. I asked is she over me and this relationship and she didn’t answer me. I asked once again and added if you can just answer me yes or no that would really help me. Again, she said nothing and began to cry… I told her I’m gunna take it as a yes. I proceeded to pack up all my things, telling her my struggles, my insecurities, my highs in the time we spent and hopes that she is happy and will find what she’s looking for. All while crying my eyes out. We hugged and said goodbye.

Flash forward to a few months later.

I started seeing, not dating, an ex that was manipulative and abusive. She is nice (40, Leo, heterosexual, cis-woman.) and Virgo reached out. She said she wanted to be friends and if I was available to hangout because she was in town. I said of course, and we hung out that day. It was nice, she’s quiet but found my babbling endearing, l asked her if she wanted to go see a movie and when we went to the theater we were asked to evict the building because of a gas leak. I was fresh out of ideas. She asked if we can go back to my place and watch something. I asked if you’re ok with that then that’s ok. Once we got to my place we talked seriously, I know she’s like me and would like a heads up when serious talk is coming up because it gets overwhelming. But she initiated and I wanted to be respectful. It didn’t feel like an apology but it offered clarity. The guy was an old crush that would talk from time to time and tell her about his woes, she did start to pull away because “that’s what she does”, and she said she missed me. I was thankful and she and I also proceeded to see each other. Again, not dating. 

A couple months go by and Virgo wanted an answer. Her or Leo. I needed time to think and what I concluded was Leo was a seriously kind person. She has amazing style, easily approachable, amazing family, and was very much in love with me. Virgo, she avoids conflict, she’s GORGEOUS, she’s has hobbies opposite of mine and I loved getting involved with some of her things. (She once said she’d read to me if I ever wanted to and I desperately wanted that.) and the sex was without a doubt top tier. But I can’t have her avoid topics and I wanted some real back and forth with emotions and feelings because that’s unfortunately all I got. I told Virgo I’m gunna start exclusively dating Leo. She was not happy and really let me have it. I understood and accepted what she felt about me and that was that. 

Here’s were I’m not a good person…

A couple months pass.

Virgo hit me up for help with electrical problem. I’m an electrician, Leo and I are not on good grounds, and I wanted to see and talk to Virgo again, so I go and help her out we talk and catch up and she asks me about Leo, I say we’re good but she presses, I tell her the truth and she seemed upset to hear that. Once I finished helping her she asked if I wanted to stay? She’s got a pool and bought me a 6 pack of my favorite beer. We started talking and laughing and showing each other new music we’ve found. We’re done in the pool and decided to watch a movie that came out and we went and changed, I went into her room after we were both done changing and looking at her she was beautiful and I thought back to the time we had and how I missed that. We embraced and kissed. The rest of the day was us hold each other and anything but penetrated sex. We talked for a bit afterwards and I was starting to. Feel guilty, I knew what I did was horribly wrong and riddled by guilt she asked if we could be together. I panicked and we cut ties there…. I had never felt like that since I had lost my dog earlier that time and I had felt like I fucked up.

Time goes on, and we’re today,

I’m doing my best to make this relationship with a woman who all my friends love! People love her, she’s adored by all. But why the fuck am I not there!?

Out of a pathetic attempt an identity started messaging her roommate, noticing this I snap out of crying and try to stop it but it too late and of course her.

1msfq8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1msfq8d/the_secret_history_by_donna_tartt_summary_quotes/,"‘The Secret History’ by Donna Tartt – Summary, Quotes & Lessons from a Murderous Elite (Read This If You’ve Ever Felt Like an Outsider)","Let’s be real - *The Secret History* didn’t just invent dark academia. It *is* dark academia. Published in 1992, this haunting literary thriller sold over a million copies in its first year, launched Donna Tartt into literary superstardom, and still has celebs like Taylor Swift dropping references in her lyrics. But this isn’t just aesthetic—it’s a slow-burning, reverse-murder-mystery that asks: what would you do to stay inside the world you begged to enter?

The story follows Richard Papen, a broke California kid who lies his way into an elite circle of Greek scholars at Hampden College, Vermont. He’s desperate to be seen as brilliant, tasteful, worthy. The group? Intellectual, eccentric, dripping with generational wealth and existential detachment. The vibe? Cognac, candlelight, and fatal rituals in the woods. When their obsession with ancient ideals turns violent, things spiral—and fast. What starts as one murder leads to another, and no one walks away clean.

## *Book Club Rating: 9.3/10*

## Key Takeaways:

* This is a book about *belonging*, not murder. Richard’s slow descent feels so real because he’s not evil—he’s just scared to be ordinary.
* The line between theory and action blurs fast. Their academic obsession with Dionysus becomes an excuse for actual violence.
* The elite bubble is intoxicating—and morally hollow. Julian teaches beauty over ethics, and his students internalize that way too well.
* Intelligence ≠ virtue. If anything, it just gives them better tools to justify what they’re doing.
* No one gets legally punished, but the guilt *eats them alive*. The aftermath is honestly more brutal than the crime.
* It’s also a lowkey meditation on class, identity, queer repression, and the cost of aesthetic purity.

## Favorite Quotes:  
“Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it.”  
“This is the only story I will ever be able to tell.”  
“Does such a thing as ‘the fatal flaw,’ that showy dark crack running down the middle of a life, exist outside literature?”

## Personal Insight:  
I read this in grad school while literally sitting in seminar rooms that looked like Julian’s. As someone who also crossed class lines to be in those rooms, this hit *hard*. I understood Richard’s hunger. I also saw the danger of intellectual detachment posing as depth. Beauty without ethics is a recipe for violence—spiritual or otherwise.

If you’ve ever faked it to fit in, obsessed over aesthetics, or felt complicit in a system just for being *included*—this one will haunt you in the best way.

Tried hookups and couldn’t land a single one in that regard either. What the hell is wrong with me? I’d consider myself a decent guy. Women have told me I’m good looking I’m 5’7 160LBS white Caucasian I have a decent hobbie with a job that pays ok I guess and a mid car. So why is it every time I ask a girl out it’s “I have a boyfriend” when she doesn’t because she’ll flirt with some other guy at the bar (just not interested I get it but all the time? Really?) and even at church the few single women that are there regularly have blown me off with “I’ll get back to you” what am I doing wrong? I simply go up to them and say “hey i think you’re cute. And we have similar interests here so i think we should get coffee (or something) sometime. What’s wrong with that? Does anyone have any experience why it’s so hard when my parents are always like “well back in the day it was easy to get a date” ,1,1755399290.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

A classmate who worked part-time with Grace Howard couldn't help but comment. Grace was notoriously frugal, wearing $1 market stall clothes for years without replacing them, even when they were faded.



Grace smiled, ""They're not torn yet, so it'd be a shame to throw them away. I'll head out now, see you tomorrow!""



""See you tomorrow!""



After she left, the others couldn't resist discussing her.



""She wins the top scholarship every year and works multiple jobs, earning quite a bit. Why is she so thrifty?""



""She spends it all on her boyfriend, that's why she's struggling,"" one informed insider revealed.



""What?"" Everyone perked up instantly.



""He's a pretty boy who hangs out in nightclubs, using his looks to mingle with rich women. He claims to be a singer, but he's more like a gigolo. Many people know, but she's completely in the dark.""



""No way!""



...



When her paycheck came in, Grace eagerly ordered an expensive pair of sneakers.



William Stewart had wanted these shoes for a long time, and she finally saved enough to buy them as a birthday gift for him.



Just as Grace was happily imagining William's surprised expression, her phone suddenly vibrated.

It was a message from her roommate.



""I just saw your boyfriend hugging some girl, and they went into room 601 together...""



The location was the bar where William Stewart worked.



Grace Howard's heart skipped a beat, and she quickly turned her car around.



Once she entered the bar, her steps were unsteady as she approached the door of room 601, but she couldn't muster the courage to barge in.



The door was slightly ajar, with light spilling out into the dim hallway. Inside, William and the alluring woman were oblivious to Grace's presence, continuing their flirtatious banter.



""I heard you have a girlfriend studying at the nearby university?"" the woman giggled.



""What girlfriend? I haven't even touched her. She's just a dumb, plain maid who cooks and cleans, thinking she's doing me a favor,"" William replied lazily.



Maid?!



Grace felt as if she'd been struck by lightning, unable to move. But the next words hit her even harder.



""Wow, that's harsh. If she heard you say that, she'd be heartbroken.""



""You're overthinking it. No matter how I treat her, she'll always come crawling back like a dog, and I can't get rid of her even if I tried...""



Grace's blood boiled as she burst through the door. ""William Stewart, you've gone too far!""

Her whole body trembled, and even her voice shook with anger.



The two people in the room were startled. When they saw who it was, William Stewart paused for a moment, frowning. ""What are you doing here?""



Grace Howard was so furious that her words stumbled over themselves, tears streaming down her face. ""You... you have the nerve to ask me that? What you just said... was that even human? I've given you everything, and you...""



William shrugged. ""Could you take this outside, ma'am? You're interrupting my time with this lovely lady, thanks.""



With that, he continued to flirt and laugh with the seductive woman, completely ignoring Grace, even going so far as to kiss the woman's red lips.



William's humiliating actions shattered something inside Grace.



Her mind went blank, her hands and feet turned cold, as she watched the chaotic scene unfold.



The usually gentle and forgiving Grace felt her gaze harden.



She picked up a bottle of wine and slowly walked over to William.



William noticed her approaching out of the corner of his eye and was surprised. Before he could react, everything went black...

After Grace Howard left, the sultry woman looked at William Stewart, whose face was covered in blood, and belatedly screamed.



""Someone help! Will's been hurt!""



The bar erupted into chaos, with some people trying to bandage William and others suggesting they call the police.



""Forget it, no need to call the cops,"" William said, holding his wound with a complicated expression, lost in thought.



On the bus ride back to school, Grace covered her face, sobbing so hard she could barely breathe.



When she first got together with William, many people doubted their relationship, saying he was too young and reckless, not a good match.



But Grace, blinded by infatuation, fell head over heels for him.



William earned a decent wage at the nightclub, but he spent money carelessly and was always overdrawn. She paid for their dates, gave him spending money, and often went to his place to clean, do laundry, and cook. She never missed giving him expensive gifts on holidays, yet in all these years, William only gave her a rough stone pendant of unknown value.



Thinking about it, Grace yanked the pendant from her neck. She wanted to throw it out the window but worried it might hit someone, so she angrily shoved it into her bag, planning to toss it in the trash when she got off the bus.

A heartfelt devotion fed to the dogs, it was all a mistake in the end!



Grace Howard was silently cursing William Stewart, wishing him childless with a house full of kids, when a sudden brake caused her forehead to smack against the seat in front, making stars dance before her eyes.



""What happened?"" The other passengers were just as unlucky, some even fell, and curses filled the air.



""The bus broke down. You'll have to catch another ride,"" the driver apologized.



The bus erupted into chaos.



After getting off, Grace noticed a small, dusty, nondescript bar and felt an inexplicable urge.



She never drank in bars before, partly because she couldn't hold her liquor and partly because it was too expensive.



But today was different. She decided to indulge and drown her sorrows, hoping to start fresh once she sobered up.



Grace walked in with her head held high and sat at the bar. ""Give me a dozen beers!""



The bar was nearly empty, and the bartender was taken aback when he saw her. He smiled apologetically, ""I'm sorry, miss. We're closed for a private event today. Please come back another time.""



Grace felt like her world was collapsing: Why did everything have to go wrong when she was down on her luck? First, her boyfriend cheated on her, then the bus broke down, and now she couldn't even get a drink because of a private event?!



""Why isn't there a sign outside if it's closed for an event? You tell me only after I come in—is this a joke? Do you think I can't afford it? Don't worry, I have money! I'm drinking today, and I'm not leaving until I do!"" The more Grace spoke, the more upset she became, and tears started streaming down her face as she cried uncontrollably.

The bartender looked troubled and glanced over at a man sitting in the corner.



The man gave Grace Howard a brief, indifferent glance but said nothing.



Understanding his cue, the bartender smiled and said, ""Miss, don't cry. I'll get you a beer right away."" He placed the drink in front of her.



Grace, sniffling, began to drink. She had overestimated her tolerance; she was already feeling tipsy after just three bottles, far from the dozen she had boasted about.



""William Stewart, you jerk! Calling me dumb and plain!!... I got into A University as a top student without any extra classes. Call me plain, fine, but who are you, a total slacker, to call me dumb?!"" Grace ranted and pounded the table, taking swigs of beer between her tirades.



William Stewart?



The man in the corner raised an eyebrow at the mention of the name, his interest piqued by the disheveled, drunken woman at the bar.



Grace was in the middle of her rant when a glass of lemon water was slid in front of her.



Through her bleary eyes, she saw a tall, lean man dressed in black sitting beside her. His voice was calm, ""If you can't handle your drinks, don't push it.""



Too drunk to see his features clearly, she only sensed that he had a good build. She misunderstood his identity, assuming he was one of the bar's male hosts. William Stewart's bar had quite a few of those, men who entertained wealthy women for commissions. She had seen them several times before.

""I-I have plenty of money! I don't need to drink this kiddie stuff!"" In a bid to spite William Stewart, Grace Howard threw her arm around the man's shoulder and shouted, ""Come on, you drink with me! I'll give you a tip if you drink well!""



The bartender's eyes nearly popped out of his head. Did this woman even realize what she was doing? She was actually getting handsy with the boss?!



Ethan Hugh, the man Grace had latched onto, didn't show any displeasure. Instead, he looked at the bartender with interest and said, ""Bring the drinks over.""



""Y-yes, sir...""



""So, what's your connection to William Stewart?"" Ethan asked, sipping his drink while trying to get information from Grace.



""Wh-what connection? I'm his father!"" Grace declared angrily. ""He said he'd marry me after I graduated, that little brat..."" Her voice trailed off as she slumped onto the bar, completely passed out.



""What should we do next, boss?"" the bartender whispered to Ethan.



""Take her to the apartment,"" Ethan replied, retrieving Grace's ID from her bag and handing it to the bartender. ""Find out what her relationship with William Stewart is.""

""Yes!""



It was the first time Grace Howard had ever been so drunk and slept so deeply.



She didn't wake up until the afternoon of the next day, her head pounding. As she opened her eyes, she was confused: Where was she? What happened?



The bed was as soft as a cloud, and the luxurious decor was far from where she should be sleeping. Wait, she was in different pajamas? What on earth happened??



Feeling panicked, Grace quickly changed into her own clothes, grabbed her bag, and tried to leave this place of trouble. But as soon as she stepped out of the room, she bumped right into Ethan Hugh, who was casually sipping coffee at the dining table.



Ethan looked up and said calmly, ""Awake?""



This was the first time Grace had seen Ethan clearly while sober, and she was stunned.



What a... what a handsome man!!!



William Stewart was already considered the pinnacle of good looks, yet the man before her seemed to surpass even him. From his facial features to his physique and aura, everything was flawless. He could easily be described as breathtakingly beautiful. If there was anything to criticize, it would be the coldness and arrogance in his eyes, which were so intense they made others feel ashamed and hesitant to approach.



Grace was speechless for a long moment. When she finally came to her senses and tried to find something to say to ease the awkwardness, her gaze froze, and her face turned pale!

Ethan Hugh stood there in a loosely tied robe, revealing his well-defined physique. The sight was enough to send anyone's imagination running wild!



""I, we..."" Grace Howard stammered, her tongue tying itself in knots. ""Last night, did we...""



Before she could finish, Ethan already knew what she was getting at. He had intended to reassure her that nothing had happened between them. But seeing the panic on Grace's face, he suddenly felt a mischievous urge.



Ethan's lips curled into a slight smile. ""Last night, we did everything.""

Grace Howard felt like she had been struck by lightning!



She vaguely remembered what happened yesterday.



She had wanted to get back at William Stewart, so she hired this male escort to drink with her and spend some money—nothing more. She never intended for it to end up in bed!



Her first time, gone just like that!



Oh my God, how much did she drink last night?! And more importantly, this male escort was top-tier handsome. How much did a night with him cost? Could selling herself even cover the fee?



Seeing Grace's world-crumbling expression, Ethan Hugh found the situation even more amusing and decided to stoke the fire.



""I usually only sell my skills, not my body. You forced me to sleep with you last night. You were too strong, and I couldn't resist. It was my first time, so you have to take responsibility. I'll turn over a new leaf and stay with you from now on.""



Grace almost fell to her knees. Was she really that terrible?!



The only man Grace had ever been close to was William Stewart, and even then, they had only held hands and hugged, never going further. With no experience, she completely believed Ethan's words, not sensing anything amiss.



This was a disaster! How was she supposed to take responsibility? She was just a poor student, not some rich lady who could afford to keep a male escort. She could barely handle William Stewart, and this guy seemed even more expensive—definitely not someone she could afford to mess with!

Grace Howard was in a complete panic. She wanted to run away, but her conscience kept her rooted to the spot. After all, she was the one at fault for ruining the reputation of a high-class escort. If she ran away without taking responsibility, how would she be any different from someone like William Stewart, a total jerk?



""What do you plan to do by following me? Just so you know, I don't have any money. I can't afford your lifestyle. Last night at the bar, I was just pretending because I was heartbroken...""



Ethan Hugh almost burst out laughing.



He had never met such a naive woman before. It was too amusing.



So, Ethan replied coolly, ""If you marry a chicken, follow the chicken; if you marry a dog, follow the dog. I'm willing to endure hardships with you, just don't abandon me halfway.""



""I...""



Grace barely got a word out before Ethan's phone rang. It was his trusted aide calling.



""Boss, we've fully investigated the identity of the lady from the bar. She...""



After listening, Ethan hung up, his gaze on Grace becoming more complex, deep as the ocean, and impossible to read.



Initially, he just wanted to tease her a bit and then let it go, but now things had changed.



Ethan walked toward Grace, and she instinctively backed away until she was pressed against the wall, with nowhere left to retreat.

Long, slender fingers lifted Grace Howard's chin, enveloping her in an intoxicating fragrance.



The man's face was so close, breathtakingly handsome, making the sun, moon, and stars seem dim by comparison. Grace blushed deeply, feeling her heart skip a beat for the first time.



Darn it, she finally understood the joy of being a wealthy woman.



If she were rich, she would definitely spend a fortune on such a stunning male escort!



""You're about to graduate, right?"" Ethan Hugh asked.



""How do you know that...""



""You mentioned it when you were drunk yesterday. A top student from A University won't have trouble finding a good job. Work hard and keep me.""



Ethan took Grace's phone and saved his number, then handed her a card with a charming smile. ""This is the key card to this place. Come by when you have time.""



With that, Ethan left.



Grace slid down to the floor, feeling weak.



She suddenly regretted not heeding her ancestors' advice—drinking really was a dangerous habit!



If she could turn back time, Grace would have held herself back from stepping into the bar and tattooed ""Drinking causes trouble"" on her back, reciting it day and night!



But alas, there was no turning back. She could only look at the luxurious apartment before her, imagining her future miserable life with tears in her eyes.

Every day, Grace Howard worked tirelessly from dawn till dusk, even on holidays, only to hand over her hard-earned salary. Yet, this male escort looked at her with disdain, saying, ""Useless! This isn't even enough to cover my rent for a month. Forget about sleeping; you'll have to work overnight gigs!""



Noooo! She would be completely drained!



Grace's only romantic experience was with William Stewart, a boy who only knew how to spend her money. Male escorts, by profession, were used to spending women's money. Besides, she had been the one to take advantage of him, so she felt it was her duty to support him as a form of atonement. That's why she had such a terrifying thought.



Just as Grace was feeling utterly hopeless, her phone rang.



She picked it up and saw it was her grandmother calling, which made her heart skip a beat.



""What's wrong, Grandma?"" Grace asked cautiously.



""I'm not going to make it. If you still consider me your grandma, come home and see me!"" Grandma said harshly before hanging up.



Her grandmother's voice was strong and didn't sound like someone who was unwell, but Grace didn't dare take any chances. She hurried out of her apartment and flagged down a cab to her grandmother's house.



Grace's parents divorced when she was just a baby, and she lived with her father. When she was in middle school, her father passed away due to illness. Her Uncle Morris's family moved into her house, took the guardianship money, and reluctantly took her in.

Once treated like a little princess by her father, Grace Howard's life turned upside down overnight.



Uncle Morris and Auntie ordered her around like a maid, making her do all the dirty and tiring chores for the entire family. She worked hard at home and studied diligently, but the harder she tried, the less they seemed to like her.



No matter how clean she kept the house or how delicious the meals she cooked, no one ever praised her. They all took it for granted. And whenever she scored perfect marks, her cousin Sophie Howard, who often failed, would throw a tantrum and tear up her test papers. Auntie would then find an excuse to punish Grace by making her skip meals.



Especially Grandma, who never showed her a kind face. If she was in a bad mood, she'd raise her hand and slap Grace. Since moving into her dorm after getting into college, Grace hadn't seen this family. Why did they suddenly want to see her now?



Returning to the ""home"" she hadn't seen in ages, Grace looked at her grandmother, who was lying in bed looking quite healthy, and at her uncle, aunt, and cousin, who seemed eager and anxious. She felt at a loss.



""Grandma, I'm back.""



Grandma coughed loudly a few times. ""The doctor says I'm very ill and need a lot of money for surgery. Your Uncle Morris has been struggling with his business these past two years. You should give me this house so I can sell it and use the money for my treatment.""



Grace's heart sank. She bit her lip and remained silent.

Grandma's anger flared when Grace Howard remained silent. ""You ungrateful child! This house belonged to my son, which means it's mine. Who do you think you are to keep it from me? Get over here and sign the papers!""



Grace was quiet for a moment before she looked up and said, ""I won't sign.""



""What did you say?!"" Grandma's eyes widened in disbelief, thinking she must have misheard.



Her timid granddaughter, who had never dared to defy her no matter how much she was scolded or beaten, was actually saying no to her?

His RD is helpful and realistic with changes and suggestions.

The person I got? Absolutely disordered eating, despite claiming to make lifestyle changes.

She told me to first start seeing a DO over my HRT (my gyn put me on the HRT) and she went on to say most gyns just throw you on it and leave it at that. I guess I could benefit from that, but her further suggestions were so upsetting. I told her I work out by weight lifting in the morning, running or power walk after work, and light yoga at night to stretch. I do this about 4-5 times a week. I'm 5'6, 150 lbs, 42 years old. 

Her suggestions included: working out daily (so no rest days???), claiming I need to find indoor exercise for winter and it would do no good to only workout in the summer (even when I never brought that up and actually DO indoor exercise during winter anyway... I actually HAVE a fitness background but I didn't go into that with her). She gave me a 1200 calorie/day meal plan DESPITE me telling her I want to build muscle mass. Doesn't want me using protein powder. I looked at the recipes she sent and one included a snack of frozen grapes dusted with sugar free Kool Aid...WTF!! 

She asked me how many pounds I wanted to lose. I said well at my age I'd rather focus on healthy food choices and muscle mass. She was so committed to getting a number and suggested 135 lbs. I said but wouldn't that interfere with muscle mass? She also wanted me to get a scale that measures fat and muscle mass, and weigh myself every morning. Good God. I'm sure I could stand to lose a few pounds, but for my height/weight and goals, this seems extreme! She then told me to also measure myself with a tape measure and when I see my doctor, let them know about any inch loss and weight loss, because they love to hear that, and often don't hear enough about folks losing weight (??!). It just seems almond mom to the extreme. 

She was also telling me to drink seltzer water, pushing to stop my green smoothies and no more juice, pushing me to stop coffee (only one or two cups a day).  Yes, I know fruit is better than the juice, I only have a small glass of juice with my breakfast in the morning. My green smoothie helps me stay full (the Naked brand smoothie). The rest of the day I drink water. 

I'm so upset because it just seems too much, too fast. I'm not even a heavy weight, my BMI falls within the normal range. She told me if fruits or veggies fall within the ""dirty dozen"", buy organic or don't buy at all. I really can't afford organic on top of today's already expensive groceries. 

I just want to cry. I contacted Berry Street, because no way in hell will this work. 

Had anyone else experienced anything like this? It's not even that I want to stuff my face or anything, but logic tells me with my workouts and my goals, these suggestions will do nothing to help me, and so many of the things she was talking about just seemed like disordered eating.

Other products ive used have been the CeraVe series, Paula’s choice, and prescription antibiotic cream. The antibiotics was probably the worst thing I could have ever done to my skin. It ruined my face for 3 whole months with flaming acne until I stopped using it and recovered. Ive tried strong cleansers with peroxide and lighter cleansers without any added product. Neither is reliable to consistent.

I’m the only one in my family with acne, but I also recognize that I am only 18 and am likely going through a late puberty and my acne could be hormonal.

Other hygienic practices i do to protect my skin is using clean silk pillowcases and air drying my skin after washing.

For my diet, I don’t drink soda or eat a lot of junk food either. My diet is natural meats, vegetables and fruits. I drink coffee without sugar and I drink milk. I don’t eat a lot of candy or sugar either. My carb intake is 90% white rice.

Chapter 1 - The Coxcomb’s Clockwork

Usually, Vernon manages to refuse the idea that he’s had a bad day. Generally, he has fun! At home, he beats boredom and loneliness by having lots of hobbies, and singing silly songs about doing tedious things, like taking the rubbish out, doing the dishes, or doing the hoovering. He does know he couldn't get away with all this singing in a relationship — the singing would inevitably end up being his and his ex-missus's ""irreconcilable differences"". 

What Vernon really enjoys is the sound of his own thoughts. Not his voice — he has the good manners to keep most of the racket to himself. In fact, his verbal eloquence disappoints him. No, his pleasure lies entirely in the private symphonic reverb of his mind, when it doesn't need to be rendered into voice in real time. When each word can take as long as it needs. It is a one-man radio station with a captive audience of one. And Vernon happens to think the programming is dangerously excellent. Maybe he'll write a story or a book one day, if he can think of a nice big old agenda he can fold into it. A personal philosophy or crusade, like modern-day chivalry, or something like that. 

Unsure he could ever love anyone more than he loves his mind — while at the same time accepting how very creepy it is to be unsure about that — he considers himself as a bachelor. Mostly by choice, since he has had romantic opportunities he didn't follow up on. The word bachelor can carry connotations of repression, and while these may not fit Vernon’s situation, he considers them helpful, in a way — they take the edge off questions about his personal life, and he doesn’t mind if people wonder, even if they guess wrong. Also, the word fits better than others: to feel aggrieved about the times his celibacy feels involuntary is as absurd to him as letting his dicky thyroid define his identity, but at the same time resenting his GP for it. He does know what waking up angry is, but humour is much less exhausting.

At work, he keeps a toolkit of mental and physical coping strategies. Some are rational, some ridiculous, all aimed at preserving his offbeat sense of humor. Only about four times a year do they fail. On those days, he goes home, collapses into bed, eats cereal for dinner, and watches cartoons. By morning, the crisis is forgotten, and life resumes — thoughts administered, wardrobe fussed over, the continuation of his hobbies and collections planned.

Vernon only accepts that his day has been truly miserable — beyond redemption — when his internal dialogue betrays a deeper, hidden admission of defeat. He imagines this level of his psyche as a bare-knuckle pugilist, and a good one at that. He would like to have a talk with him, but no amount of meditation has gotten him there yet. He can aim his internal dialogue towards this deeper level of himself, but it never talks back. Unless he pretends it does, but then that's just his internal dialogue having dialogue with itself, is it not? That feels a little too close to praying to himself, if not outright madness, so he doesn't do that, just in case. 

The first sign that this inner prizefighter has taken one punch too many and has hit the canvas is when his internal dialogue lets out a defeated “hmmmmmph!” By then, it’s too late for any of his usual fixes — like a skive and a Twix, boiling the kettle for the sheer hell of it, or hiding Keith’s nasty old Sports Direct mug and waiting for the fallout. Not all of Vernon’s coping mechanisms annoy others, but some definitely do. Keith, primarily. 

Today, Vernon has had a bad day, in a weird way, and he hears his underconscious give up a loud ""hmmmmmph!"". The usual workday stuff has now just been too much. What hasn't helped this time is that up until 2:27pm yesterday, Vernon had thought it was Friday. “Can I really have thought this?” he wonders. If he had thought that yesterday was today, it wouldn't have taken him until 2:27pm yesterday to ask Gary what he was doing tomorrow, would it? He'd ask people that question much earlier on an actual Friday, wouldn't he? This morning before work, Vernon hadn't quite forgotten about this being his 2nd Friday of the week, but he'd forgiven himself. Then, on the train, Gary reminded him, still finding Vernon's mistake so extremely funny. Gary's bringing it up again in the break room at lunch-time had then compounded the cruelty of it all, this 2nd bloody Friday. 

At 2:27pm this afternoon, Vernon happened to look at the clock on his computer, and noted with no wry smile that it was 2:27pm again. The problem wasn't just that this 2nd Friday still had 3 hours and 3 minutes to go; the ""coincidence"" that he was looking at the clock on the same minute he'd yesterday found out his brain had ridiculed itself — it was just too specifically ironic. He is now unable to pretend his work is enjoyable. It won't be enjoyable again until Monday. 

""Hmmmmmph"". 

Vernon flips his mousepad and derives from the tiny numbers and coloured dots there that it has been 4 months and 6 days since he last begged to go home to nurse a migraine. The cyphered mousepad also tells him that there had actually been a real headache, level 5, and the previous one — a fake one — just under 7 months before that. All having gone well with his boss Caitlyn, he will need to remember to add today's date to the mousepad on Monday. 

Now in a taxi home (the calling of which had been a big part of his railroading Caitlyn into agreeing he could go home, along with the power of the word 'migraine' of course), Vernon is wondering if he isn't a bit of a sociopath.

This thought started directly after he silenced the suspiciously friendly taxi driver with the finalising tone he used to say ""aye"" when the driver had asked if Vernon was done for the weekend, and now Vernon is left with his thoughts again, and feels mildly guilty for feeling happy about that. No, his sociopathy goes back longer than today, longer than the mousepad can tell him, longer than even the first (undocumented) fake migraines. When had he joined Invictus Solutions, seven years ago now? 

“It was a month after mum... yeah, five years and change.” 

Vernon is still a phone-grunt; hasn't made any move towards going onto the Compliance Specialist course. He knows that to start the ball rolling on that, you just need to ask Craig, and Craig needs to be asked — Craig isn’t going to just ask you to become a Compliance Specialist, he has said that many times. Vernon knows he wasn't meant to take this as a warning never to ask Craig — to remain in the job new-starts get — but he must have. A month or so after you ask Craig, and you've been getting chummier with Craig, and going to clandestine meetings with Craig and sharing private smirks with Craig, you move up to the 4th floor, and you lose pals. If the fear of losing pals is why Vernon is yet a grunt, does that mean he isn't a sociopath? 

As a result of him being a grunt with five years experience  — super adept at the computer system, points of legislature and internal politics — Vernon’s the recently-appointed Caitlyn has had to ask him for far too much assistance to be able to manage him properly, he feels. That's how he sees it anyway. Obviously he helps train new-starts, but nobody asked him to train managers, he just ended up doing that. Plus, It isn’t like Craig has expressed any regrets at Vernon not being on the 4th floor. 

If it might be to his credit, Vernon doesn't think Caitlyn's being a pushover has anything to do with her fancying him, which she doesn't. Someone must, by the laws of averages, but not Caitlyn. No, it's his unnatural competence. She doesn't seem to have any problems keeping Gary or Chloe or Tom on their toes, probably because they are, in varying degrees and in various aspects, useless. They’ll go upstairs soon anyhow. Yup — Vernon decides, as his conscience pangs him for calling friends useless — he's on the spectrum, if sociopathy has or belongs to a spectrum. It must, mustn't it? John Wayne Gacy and Ted Bundy at the extreme end of it, Elizabeth Holmes and The Wolf Of Wall Street somewhere in the middle but not necessarily together, and himself being on the lower end being rude to taxi drivers who are unwittingly a part of his tactical ""migraines"". As the taxi turns onto his street, Vernon decides he is only slightly worse than Ferris Bueller. 

“You've got to view yourself romantically, eh? No-one else will while you're alive.”

A £4.40 tip should make up for the brutal ""aye"". 

""Just up the top right there mate, just after that silver car. I'll pay on my card if that's alright? Round it up to the £16. Och no, it's no bother. Is that it gone through? Braw. Have a great weekend."" 

Vernon knows he will have a nice weekend; he has an idea about proving Goldbach's conjecture by staring at last night's spreadsheet of zeroless bijective bases. He also has a big new box of Weetabix Crunchy Minis. He isn’t necessarily planning on staying indoors and interacting with no-one until Monday — but he would have to avoid friends from work, until tomorrow at any rate. If his TV and maths don’t absorb him fully until Monday, he reckons he might end up floating down to see what Kris is up to — but Kris has been being weird lately, and Vernon thinks he’s back on the drugs. And Drew is too busy with his baby these days, which is fair enough. Vernon could call Kris and see if he wants to come around and watch TV with him, but the days when he’d have then stolen his phone, locked him in his flat and shouted through the letterbox that he’d be back in three days, well, they’re just gone now. For one thing, he doesn’t have hotel money. His flat is nicer now, his home, and his neighbours aren’t the worst now. First and foremost, though, Disney+ have put King Of The Hill on, so his IPTV guys will have put it up too. Kris doesn’t appreciate cartoons even when he isn’t rattling. Which does not make a lot of sense to Vernon, because the few times he smoked weed, cartoons were extra great. Wouldn’t the stronger stuff keep this trait? 

Vernon thinks he does just fancy a weekend by himself. It's philanthropic, in a way.



Chapter 2 - The Rending of Rinds

On such a Friday as this — not being a payday, and the early May weather being not quite beer-garden friendly — Vernon would find himself in the dark, gangstery pub along the road from his offices, with twelve-or-so colleagues. The same twelve each week, himself included, unless it's one of those weeks someone joins them to find out their group is more cynical than they had thought it would be. It's best not to try to look into who actually likes who; it's possible nobody in this little scene is particularly pleasant, or would have anything especially nice to say about another. Perhaps what bonds them is an ability to listen to each other's life stories with little judgement, if they even remember them beyond that night. With Vernon, his pubmates' gripes only seem to stick with him if he hears them twice or thrice, but he gets away with it, so he expects that's how the others work too. 

They start with beers and shop-talk, until whoever feels it is their turn pops off and returns with a tray of shots. They tell each other off for talking shop every so often. Then comes an awkward patch in which Jonjo will do a crap magic trick, Suze will moan about her husband, Keith will talk about some Netflix documentary that never sounds good when Keith describes it, but might later turn out to be alright if you accidentally watch it. After this interlude, they're quite relieved to go back to talking shop for another hour, before they each filter out at times depending on their particular bus or train schedules. Martin always wants everyone to go on into town, not just on paydays. No-one wants to suggest they couldn't afford an all-nighter.

""'M'on intae Glasga, Vern!"" Martin had insisted last week. ""Paul? Suze, you'll come intae Solid, naw? Bawz! 'M'on Suze! Where you gaun Vern?""

""Just goin’ to get ma train, mate, I'm no intae it the night."" Vern replied, but hadn't quite landed the assertive tone he had wanted: if he’d had more funds in his account he would have gone, and might have started in on Suze to come as well.

""Train ma hole, ya wee fud, we're gaun tae get wellied, mibey even dipped ma boy! Couple e' fine lads lit us. We'll get shnookert for sure!"" 

""Naw am urny, Marty, no the night mate, ta muchly though."" Good, better. 

""Muchly? English bastard!"" Martin had responded, with not enough of a smile, and the whole phrase had haunted Vernon since. It's not just that he doesn't like being sworn at — Martin had hit a nerve. It just hasn’t been a mental thread he’s wanted to pull at yet — although he does think he should one day. Vernon tries to do his own psychoanalysis, and reckons he isn't half bad at it. He knows not to self-medicate with anything stronger than Pez. 

He has found that going on into town is only ever worthwhile on paydays — not just because he'll have money to burn, but maybe he'll want more than just the usual Friday crew to latch onto later in the night. Suze drinks gin in Glasgow. The others joke about avoiding Suze after she's had started on the gin; for Vernon, this is doctrine, never to be swerved. The drunker Suze gets, the harder it gets to imagine Suze's husband is the source of every one of her woes, and she none of his. But you need to imagine this, when she's cracking on in the break room, and in the pub every other Friday evening.

Then, there's Martin. Vernon has heard more than one horror story about colleagues waking up in Martin's east-end hovel, which was described to him in a way that makes Vernon think that Martin lives in Joe Rogan's brain, uncarpeted, with many, many dogs. The rumour about Michael's eyebrow was never substantiated, as Michael wasn't ever seen at work again. Or, it was substantiated, as Michael wasn't ever seen at work again. You didn't quit a job after 5 days because nothing untoward happened at Martin's gaff that night, did you? 

But nevermind that. This Friday is a luxury Friday now. Vernon is collecting a thick brown paper bag from behind his wheely bin. It's only slightly soggy from the rain. In his kitchen he is opening the package that he now realises it is the Temu stuff he ordered ages ago and forgot about. Little soaps and fake succulents that might feminize the place. Cheeky tea towels that, upon reflection, threaten to undo the intended work of the soaps and succulents. A retro-style clock that is most definitely far too masculine. It's difficult to regret a £1.55 purchase, but this is nasty. When did he order this stuff? “That's the thing about Temu,” he muses as he kicks his shoes off violently back through the kitchen door at the living room radiator, ”you pay low low prices because the items are shipped on a tea clipper that won't dock in Portsmouth until some time in late December.” He smiles at himself and decides he'll tweet this thought later on. Then again, it could attract snash from people who believe Temu aren't the most responsible sourcer of goods, so he'll think on it again later. Putting the not-quite-empty paper bag on the bunker, he puts his gas oven on to make a ""double pepperoni"" frozen pizza that he wouldn't say has a ""single"" amount of pepperoni on it. He makes a cup of instant coffee and takes his package into his bedroom for further investigation. 

OK, right, that's that tartan tie he had high hopes for! He loves it, he hadn't expected it to feel so premium. 50% wool, 50% polyester, 100% dapper. This tie was the starting point of the Temu order, everything else was filler to get the order up to the £15 minimum checkout. Free stuff, considering he has previously paid more than £15 for a tie of comparable quality. He wants it to work with his purple suit, as none of his other ties really do, in any kind of satisfying way. His purple paisley tie works fine, because it's purple, darker purple and tiny flecks of red and white. His navy knitted tie is an even less of an inspired match. On paper, this new tie of deep forest green isn't necessarily going to be a traditional colour match with purple, but the tartan has teal stripes, thin brown overlines and, importantly, lavender highlights. It is these that might make the purple/dark green a pleasant contrast, rather than an eyesore. Professional. Sartorial. 

For all that he is a very modern person, with many very modern interests, sensibilities, food requirements, and a modern vocation, Vernon is one of those people who want to have been born much earlier than they were, and will occasionally tell people this. He pulls this out when someone has cheered him up by asking him why he always dresses as smart as he does. He has decided the sweet-spot for his birth is somewhere after 1886, the year Karl Benz invented the last invention he considers indispensable: the motor car. Vernon cannot drive, even though he's thirty-two, so there's a plot-hole. He would find it easier not to be so lazy in the past. His daydream has to be selective though: he'd love to be bobbing about in 1920s London, but who can be bothered with all that World War One stuff? Conscription to France, muddy from your neck down in diphtheria-ridden trenches, not to mention getting bulleted to death. What he really wants is a multiverse hop, rather than just a skip backwards through this humanity's history. A universe where the Archduke Franz Ferdinand caught a debilitating flu that week, cancelled all his appointments, and everyone just waltzed into the '20s unaware of what could have been. Pretty rich that, though, wanting to erase a war, just so you could go partying. 

Vernon also won't say — to anyone who he's telling this fantasy to — that he'd need to be infinitely wealthy, but without celebrity. The Champagne Lifestyle, without anyone being bothered how he can afford it. Nor will he mention his worries about whether tubby five-foot-six ginger people with slight underbites even fared well back then — he isn't sure his face fits here, where people are meant to be kinder. Didn't you very much need a beard, in the past? Vernon has tried beards to fix his weak chin, and long hair to fix the shape of his cranium, but he has promised himself never again; he'd looked like Noel Edmonds made from fudge. 

It would all just be simpler if he had a nice long and happy past life to regress into. Vernon scoffs at people who claim to have had a past life, but he does realise the motivation for his scoffing is sheer jealousy: he wouldn't need to daydream, and wouldn't have to drown his evenings in television reruns, if he could just sit back and tune into his past-self's memories. 

Vernon gets his purple suit out of the wardrobe, twists the hook on the hanger, and hangs it over the wardrobe door. Holding the tie against the suit, he realises he lacks objectivity; he wants to say the match is good, just as he did when he bought the tie. This test isn't confirming or denying anything. He needs to see beyond his desire for the pairing to work, to see if it does. There's only one thing for it: full immersion. Shedding the brown tweed suit and green check tie he has been wearing all day, noting that his shirt pits are a bit on the whiffy side as he does so, he puts on the purple suit and the tartan tie in question. 

Tilting the Argos Home Essentials Oak Effect Free Standing Cheval Mirror back from the vertical, he steps away, ready to behold his reflection. But instead of aesthetic triumph, his eye catches movement: a large brown spider, high upon the wall. It looms directly above his bed, doing spidery things with its legs  — no doubt some cryptic semaphore for don't you dare. Vernon’s breath hitches. “At least it's on the wall,” he thinks, as he pulls on his blue suedette slippers, so as to be suitably soled for the occupation of the impending murder, just in case he fluffs his first plan to squish it with a book and it becomes a stomping job. ""Alexa,"" he commands, ""shuffle my robot apocalypse playlist."" His heartbeat quickens as Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger starts. He grabs the thick book on his nightstand. His weapon of choice. 

Over the music, a blackbird trills a loud lament, and —  was that a cricket?  A Glaswegian urban cricket? Weird, but it's not the critter Vernon feels he needs to give his attention to right now. 

Mounting the bed, he feels its treacherous instability beneath his feet. 

“Smells nice up here — 
fresh, like outdoorsy fresh.
‘One spritz three days ago and your living room will smell like sunlit meadows and  wildflowers, without the awkward conversation with squirrels.’
This is no time to be a Febreze advert, Vernon,. ” 

Vernon has never had occasion to stand on his mattress before, let alone jump on it in order to put a book on top of a spider. It's a very unstable base of attack; it wobbles, it shifts. Still, he advances, book raised high, heart pounding the ancient rhythm of prey pretending they're the predator now. He curses his own height and the absurd height of his ceilings. He jumps, greasily, and unleashes his strike. In the elongated seconds of flight and overhand smash, his choice of handhold on the book becomes suddenly questionable.

The book slaps the wall unconvincingly, like a wet handshake. Vernon is far too concerned with jumping down from the bed deliberately — and assuredly without the spider on him — rather than falling off of it and the spider jumping after him — to see if book did connect with spider. 

Vernon's dismount from the bed landed him in a green field of ankle-height grass. Instead of being beside his bed and in front of his wall with a spider or a spider-stain high up on it, he was experiencing a vista of purple and brown mottled hills and evening blue skies all around him, little oranging clouds scudding leftwards towards a setting sun. An early star shone in the navying east. He felt the late sun on the right side of his face, and a slight breeze playing around him. He heard the sound of a river and crickets somewhere, and smelt the smell of grass and a faint waft of manure. No more Daft Punk. He was not in his bedroom, flat, street, or even anywhere he has even seen before. For all it was all so full of everything, all this nature, objectively gorgeous in its arrangement of course, as pure nature generally tends to be, it was emptier than anywhere Vernon had ever seen before. Nobody and nothing. 

""Jangled?"" his brain asks. That can't be the right word. ""Abrupt!"" he heard his mind shout. ""Cracked!"" He shook his head and regretted it. He thought about turning around to see what might be behind him, but decided he had enough on his plate for now, with the little clouds and the hills and the grass and shrubs and those sheep over there, and that line of trees and everything. Was that a dragonfly? Another beat of the most unadulterated confusion, cooked from a very tangible roux of unreality baked with undeniable and unbearable reality all around and over him and going up his nose and squidging into his left slipper. 

""Did the spider do this?"" 

Vernon's vision swam and refocused, but that didn't help at all, he was still in this outside place, absolutely horrified at all its sickening beauty. He remembered feeling like this the one and only time he had been on a treadmill, that time there was one in the break-room at work, and he'd dismounted and spun into a stack of plastic chairs. He had managed not to black out that time though, the break-room still being around him and all. Now, every inexplicable photon hitting Vernon's retinas seemed to burn and blacken. The last thought Vernon had before he toppled stiffly into his first ever faint was just how many things he had to think about

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal sofa table behind a couch offers a blend of style, functionality, and durability. Understanding the key features to look for will help you make an informed decision that complements your décor and meets your practical needs.

**Dimensions and Height:** A crucial aspect is the size of the sofa table. It should ​be approximately the same length as your sofa, or slightly shorter, to maintain visual balance. The height ‍is equally important; it should sit at or ⁤just​ below⁢ the back of your sofa. Aim for a height that allows easy access ​to items placed on the table without requiring you to reach awkwardly over the couch. A ‍standard height ranges from 28 to 32 inches, but measure your sofa‍ to ensure‍ the best fit.

**Material and Construction:** The⁤ material of the sofa table greatly impacts its durability and aesthetic appeal. Solid wood, such as oak, maple, or walnut, offers ‌robustness and a timeless look,‍ though it can be more expensive. Engineered wood,like MDF or plywood,provides a cost-effective alternative while still offering decent strength. Metal frames, often made of steel​ or iron, can add⁣ a modern or industrial touch and provide a sturdy base. The construction quality is also vital; look for well-joined seams, stable legs, and a smooth finish to ensure the table’s longevity.

**Storage Options:** Many sofa tables come with built-in storage features to enhance their functionality. These options can include open shelving, drawers, cabinets, or a combination of these. Open shelves are ideal for displaying books, decorative items, or storing baskets. Drawers offer concealed storage for smaller items like remote controls, chargers, or stationery. Cabinets provide more secure storage for items you want to keep out of sight. Evaluate your storage⁢ needs to determine which type of storage options best suit your lifestyle.

**Style and‌ Design:** The style of the sofa table should complement your existing décor. ⁢Consider the overall ⁢theme of your living room,whether‌ it is modern,customary,rustic,or eclectic. Clean lines,minimalist designs,and neutral colors work well in contemporary spaces,while ornate details,dark woods,and classic silhouettes suit traditional settings. Rustic styles⁤ often feature ⁢reclaimed wood, distressed finishes, and industrial accents. Choose a⁣ sofa​ table that‍ enhances the aesthetic appeal of your room and reflects your personal style.

**Weight Capacity:** The ⁣weight capacity of the sofa table is an important consideration, especially⁤ if you plan to place heavy items on it, such as lamps, large books, or decorative objects.⁤ Ensure the table is sturdy enough to support the intended⁢ weight without wobbling or bending. Check the manufacturer's specifications for‌ the maximum weight capacity and factor in a⁤ safety margin to prevent overloading. Reinforcements like solid wood legs, metal supports, and durable joinery can contribute to a higher weight capacity.

**Surface Finish:** The finish of the sofa table not only contributes‍ to its aesthetic appeal but also affects its durability ⁣and maintenance. Common finishes include lacquer, varnish, paint, and stain.⁢ Lacquer and varnish provide a protective layer that resists scratches, stains, and moisture. ⁣Paint offers a wide range of ‍color options and can be used to create different effects, such as matte, gloss, or distressed finishes. Stain enhances the natural grain of the wood while offering some protection. Consider the level of maintenance required for each finish and choose one that suits your lifestyle and preferences.

Key​ features of a well-designed sofa table include:

*   Durable and stable construction
*   Adequate storage space for various ⁣items
*   Aesthetic appeal that complements the room's ‌décor
*   Suitable dimensions to fit behind ‌the⁢ couch

Through the curved glass windows of the schooner’s small but elegant stern gallery, our wake stretches over a vast expanse sparkling blue sea. I should be making entries in the log, but the splendid sunset keeps drawing my attention from its pages. 

Then I see the French Frigate, the Pellier, swing into view as she yaws half a mile off our quarter. The sudden turn points her broadside at our stern, all twenty-four of her gun ports open wide. 

Oh, right; we’re still under attack. 

My mind loses all meditative expression, and in disappointment I reach for my coffee as the Pellier’s side vanishes behind a cloud of orange-punched smoke. A moment later comes the thundering crash of her guns, white plumes dotting across our wake where her roundshot strikes the sea, just short of our fleeing schooner. 

One lucky shot bounces off the waves and comes aboard, smashing the cabin windows and shattering the coffee cup in my hand. 

“Miss Dangerfield,” I say, in a voice calculated to penetrate the entire vessel. 

“Sir?” Said my steward, her concerned face appearing at the cabin door. Her eyes immediately notice the rustled tablecloth and askew silver dishes, and her expression turns somewhat accusatory. 

As if I’d personally invited an 18-pound ball aboard at one thousand feet per second. 

“Another cup of you please, ma’am, thank you,” I say, as politely as I can manage. 

She salutes sullenly…sarcastically? No, no, she wouldn’t dare, and vanishes into the galley. 

We’d have never allowed these insolent looks in the Navy, I reflect. For a moment I gleefully imagine her bare back strapped to the grating, taking half a dozen stripes for insubordination. 

But I’m no longer part of the Royal Fleet; I’m a smuggler, and the rules are different now. As captain and part-owner of the schooner, I maintain the same rigid authority, but the crew are volunteers and professional seamen, much less concerned with formalities than your by-the-book man-o-war crews. 

The coffee comes back hot and strong. I drink a few grateful gulps, then fill my cup—a metal cup, I notice—and head up on deck. I note with satisfaction that the Frigate had continued to wear and was now pointing away south. 

Mr Blythe turns away from the taffrail when I approach, and scurries over to me. He’s an odd, squirrelly fellow we picked up in Port Mahon, said he needed a quiet passage, no papers. Adding in the fact that he’s a Spaniard, speaks Latin, and wears all black; he might as well have the word “Assassin” tattooed on his forehead. 

He makes me extraordinarily uncomfortable.  

I open my telescope and pretend to focus on a flock of seagulls off our starboard beam, hoping he’ll turn away. 

“Not expecting more trouble, Captain?” 

“Not presently,” I said, “still - I better go have a look from the masthead.” 

Slinging my telescope, I spring onto the rigging and scramble aloft like a prime foremast hand. 

The platform at the topmast is crowded: three sailors. The lookout and two off-duty hands, seated on folded piles of sailcloth. I hear the clatter of dice, and one of them scoops something into his mouth. 

All wear guilty expressions; they weren’t expecting anyone, much less the captain, and even smuggling ships have rules against gambling. 

But I’m no longer in the mood to flog anyone, and regardless all attention shifts at cries from the deck below: 

“What’s he doing? He’ll kill himself!”

“He’ll break his neck, damn fool!” 

Glancing over the edge I see Mr. Blythe entangled the rigging. He’d tried to follow me up, the pragmatical bastard! He slips again and hangs inverted, swinging by his ankles with the roll of the mast. His face shows pure horror. 

Fortunately Miss Dangerfield chose that moment to ascend the opposite rigging with my refreshments, somehow making the climb encumbered by a steaming kettle of tea and my silver cigar case.

She hangs these on a rat line, and leaps for a backstay, swinging across the mast to the rigging with it’s precarious hold on the assassin. Seizing him by the ankle, she jerks him free and upright and carries him the rest of the way aloft, dumping him in a gasping heap on our platform. 

“Sir!” Says the lookout, pointing to the French ship which was now almost disappearing from view, “they’re flying an alphabetical message.” 

I focus the eyepiece of my telescope, and the Pelliere springs into view. With her studdingsails abroad and royals she makes a glorious sight on the water. I spell out the flags as they break out on her mizzen top: 

“H-A-V-E A N-I-C-E T-R-I-P” 

“That’s truly nice of them, Captain,” says Miss Dangerfield. 

“Indeed it is!” I say, and then “Pass the word for our signalmen. You sir: spell out “Y-O-U A-S W-E-L-L.” 

I reach to pick up Mr. Blythe, supporting him beneath his shoulder. “Open your eyes, Mr. Blythe. The view is quite stunning from here.” 

Reluctantly he lets them focus. Then his face brightens into something almost like happiness, and he gives a reptilian smile. “I’m amazed!” He says. “Amazed!” 

“Take my glass,” I say, unsure of why I no longer despise the fellow, “just don’t drop it. There - to the starboard … no, to starboard …there you are sir … you can make out the western tip of Formentera.” 

“Incredible!” He says, whimsically sweeping the telescope in a slow circle of the horizon. 

The tea finally comes up, and I light a cigar. This is the type of sailing I love. 

Blythe suddenly freezes, the glass pointing straight ahead inline with our bow. 

“And captain…what are those sleek, shiny vessels cruising with such graceful speed around the cliffs there?” 

It was as I feared. We’d dodged the French Empire, sure, but we’re small fish for them. It’s different for these local harbor cops with their ocean flyers: this is all they do. 

“Baltimore Clippers,” I say, without needing to look. I flicked my cigar and watched it soar away and fizzle into the ocean. “Revenue Cutters.”

## Key Features Analysis

The features of a cup and straw set determine its functionality, durability, and overall user experience.

**Material:** The material of the cup and straw impacts not only the feel but also the durability and environmental impact. Stainless steel is a popular choice for its durability and resistance to rust, capable of lasting years with proper care. Glass offers a pure taste and is also recyclable. Plastic, while lightweight and often more affordable, raises environmental concerns, although BPA-free options are common. silicone is a flexible and heat-resistant option frequently enough used for kids' cups and straws. Reusable bamboo constitutes an emerging material option that boasts sustainability as its key attribute.The selection of your cup and straw set’s material should hinge upon priorities ranging from the cup’s resilience, material safety, eco-friendliness, and aesthetic appeal.

**Insulation:** If you frequently enjoy hot or cold beverages, insulation is a crucial feature. Double-walled insulation, frequently enough found in stainless steel tumblers, helps maintain the temperature of your drink for longer periods. This prevents condensation on the outside of the cup and keeps your hands comfortable. Vacuum insulation is the most effective, creating a barrier that minimizes heat transfer.some insulated cups can keep drinks hot for up to 12 hours or cold for up to 24 hours.

Double walled glass or plastic may provide rudimentary levels of insulation; however, it will not compete with metal options.

**lid Design:** The lid is a critical component for preventing spills and ensuring easy sipping. Look for lids that are leak-proof or spill-resistant, especially if you plan to use the cup on the go. Some lids feature a sliding closure to seal the straw opening when not in use. Securely fitting lids are essential for preventing messes, especially with hot liquids. Consider lids that are easy to clean and disassemble to prevent bacteria buildup.

Lids can be made from plastic, silicone, or stainless steel, depending on the overall set design.

**Straw Type and Size:** Straws come in various materials, including stainless steel, glass, silicone, and plastic. Stainless steel straws are durable and reusable but can sometimes transfer a metallic taste. Silicone straws are flexible and gentle on teeth but might potentially be more prone to staining. The straw size should be appropriate for the type of beverage you'll be drinking. A wider straw is better for smoothies and milkshakes, while a narrower straw is suitable for water or juice.

Some sets include multiple straws to accommodate different beverages, or even bends in the straw that enable comfortable drinking in various positions.

**Capacity and Portability:** The size of the cup should align with your drinking habits and intended use. Smaller cups (12-16 ounces) are ideal for coffee or tea, while larger tumblers (20-30 ounces) are better for staying hydrated throughout the day. Consider the cup's dimensions and weight if you plan to carry it in a bag or backpack. Some cups are designed with a tapered shape to fit comfortably in car cup holders.

The portability of the cup should factor into your decision, particularly if you intend to use them while taking public transportation or performing other actions that require both hands.

Through the curved glass windows of the schooner’s small but elegant stern gallery, our wake stretches over a vast expanse sparkling blue sea. I should be making entries in the log, but the splendid sunset keeps drawing my attention from its pages. 

Then I see the French Frigate, the Pellier, swing into view as she yaws half a mile off our quarter. The sudden turn points her broadside at our stern, all twenty-four of her gun ports open wide. 

Oh, right; we’re still under attack. 

My mind loses all meditative expression, and in disappointment I reach for my coffee as the Pellier’s side vanishes behind a cloud of orange-punched smoke. A moment later comes the thundering crash of her guns, white plumes dotting across our wake where her roundshot strikes the sea, just short of our fleeing schooner. 

One lucky shot bounces off the waves and comes aboard, smashing the cabin windows and shattering the coffee cup in my hand. 

“Miss Dangerfield,” I say, in a voice calculated to penetrate the entire vessel. 

“Sir?” Says my steward, her concerned face appearing at the cabin door. Her eyes immediately notice the rustled tablecloth and askew silver dishes, and her expression turns somewhat accusatory. 

As if I’d personally invited an 18-pound ball aboard at one thousand feet per second. 

“Another cup of you please, ma’am, thank you,” I say, as politely as I can manage. 

She salutes sullenly…sarcastically? No, no, she wouldn’t dare, and vanishes into the galley. 

We’d have never allowed these insolent looks in the Navy, I reflect. For a moment I gleefully imagine her bare back strapped to the grating, taking half a dozen stripes for insubordination. 

But I’m no longer part of the Royal Fleet; I’m a smuggler, and the rules are different now. As captain and part-owner of the schooner, I maintain the same rigid authority, but the crew are volunteers and professional seamen, much less concerned with formalities than your by-the-book man-o-war crews. 

The coffee comes back hot and strong. I drink a few grateful gulps, then fill my cup—a metal cup, I notice—and head up on deck. I note with satisfaction that the Frigate had continued to wear and was now pointing away south. 

Mr Blythe turns away from the taffrail when I approach, and scurries over to me. He’s an odd, squirrelly fellow we picked up in Port Mahon, said he needed a quiet passage, no papers. Adding in the fact that he’s a Spaniard, speaks Latin, and wears all black; he might as well have the word “Assassin” tattooed on his forehead. 

He makes me extraordinarily uncomfortable.  

I open my telescope and pretend to focus on a flock of seagulls off our starboard beam, hoping he’ll turn away. 

“Not expecting more trouble, Captain?” 

“Not presently,” I said, “still - I better go have a look from the masthead.” 

Slinging my telescope, I spring onto the rigging and scramble aloft like a prime foremast hand. 

The platform at the topmast is crowded: three sailors. The lookout and two off-duty hands, seated on folded piles of sailcloth. I hear the clatter of dice, and one of them scoops something into his mouth. 

All wear guilty expressions; they weren’t expecting anyone, much less the captain, and even smuggling ships have rules against gambling. 

But I’m no longer in the mood to flog anyone, and regardless all attention shifts at cries from the deck below: 

“What’s he doing? He’ll kill himself!”

“He’ll break his neck, damn fool!” 

Glancing over the edge I see Mr. Blythe entangled the rigging. He’d tried to follow me up, the pragmatical bastard! He slips again and hangs inverted, swinging by his ankles with the roll of the mast. His face shows pure horror. 

Fortunately Miss Dangerfield chose that moment to ascend the opposite rigging with my refreshments, somehow making the climb encumbered by a steaming kettle of tea and my silver cigar case.

She hangs these on a rat line, and leaps for a backstay, swinging across the mast to the rigging with it’s precarious hold on the assassin. Seizing him by the ankle, she jerks him free and upright and carries him the rest of the way aloft, dumping him in a gasping heap on our platform. 

“Sir!” Says the lookout, pointing to the French ship which was now almost disappearing from view, “they’re flying an alphabetical message.” 

I focus the eyepiece of my telescope, and the Pelliere springs into view. With her studdingsails abroad and royals she makes a glorious sight on the water. I spell out the flags as they break out on her mizzen top: 

“H-A-V-E A N-I-C-E T-R-I-P” 

“That’s truly nice of them, Captain,” says Miss Dangerfield. 

“Indeed it is!” I say, and then “Pass the word for our signalmen. You sir: spell out “Y-O-U A-S W-E-L-L.” 

I reach to pick up Mr. Blythe, supporting him beneath his shoulder. “Open your eyes, Mr. Blythe. The view is quite stunning from here.” 

Reluctantly he lets them focus. Then his face brightens into something almost like happiness, and he gives a reptilian smile. “I’m amazed!” He says. “Amazed!” 

“Take my glass,” I say, unsure of why I no longer despise the fellow, “just don’t drop it. There - to the starboard … no, to starboard …there you are sir … you can make out the western tip of Formentera.” 

“Incredible!” He says, whimsically sweeping the telescope in a slow circle of the horizon. 

The tea finally comes up, and I light a cigar. This is the type of sailing I love. 

Blythe suddenly freezes, the glass pointing straight ahead inline with our bow. 

“And captain…what are those sleek, shiny vessels cruising with such graceful speed around the cliffs there?” 

It was as I feared. We’d dodged the French Empire, sure, but we’re small fish for them. It’s different for these local harbor cops with their ocean flyers: this is all they do. 

“Baltimore Clippers,” I say, without needing to look. I flicked my cigar and watched it soar away and fizzle into the ocean. “Revenue Cutters.”

The tea finally comes up, and I light a cigar. This is the type of sailing I love. 

Blythe suddenly freezes, the glass pointing straight ahead inline with our bow. 

“And captain…what are those sleek, shiny vessels cruising with such graceful speed around the cliffs there?” 

It was as I feared. We’d dodged the French Empire, sure, but we’re small fish for them. It’s different for these local harbor cops with their ocean flyers: this is all they do. 

“Baltimore Clippers,” I say, without needing to look. I flicked my cigar and watched it soar away and fizzle into the ocean. “Revenue Cutters.”

1msf40x,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1msf40x/my_granddaughter_gifted_me_an_urn/,My granddaughter gifted me an urn.,"This morning, my granddaughter Katherine stopped by to give me a birthday gift for my 74th year alive. This was surprising for three separate reasons.

I am 76 years old.

It is currently August, and my birthday is in January.

And lastly, my family has been no-contact with me for five years.

Of course, I was filled with elation when I saw her face, so different than what I remember yet, I could still see that little girl with blonde braids and pink ribbons at the end. She was so independent, yet always needed my help in the kitchen since my, now late, husband told her ghosts lived in there. He had said that they made the scary sounds that, in actuality, was the interstate that ran along the back of our house. 

As tears welled in my eyes, I quickly ushered her in and out of the pouring rain that had just begun. “How have you been? What brought you all the way out here? What have you been up to?” I was all too aware that I was berating her with questions, but I couldn’t help myself. The last time I had seen anyone in the past few years is that young man that brings my meals on wheels, and he never stays for long.

Luckily, Katherine did not seem put off. Instead, she chuckled lightly and said, “I’ve been good grandmother. I came here to bring you something for your 74th birthday!” 

I patted her shoulders and brought over a blanket so I could drape it around her. “‘Grandmother?’ No need to be so formal Katherine. You can still call me Mawmaw.” I was so taken back by the whole ordeal that it took me a second to process the last statement. A gift? In the moment I decided to just push it off and focus on how grateful I was to finally see my baby, and how glad I was that she didn’t try to tell me to call her Kyle. I was so elated that she was finally over all of that nonsense. 
“I’m sorry Mawmaw, but I can’t really stay for long. I just came to drop this off before I head off to work, since your house is on the way and all. Here.” She practically pushed the gift bag into my arms, and they immediately sagged under the weight of the hefty object inside. Then, she hurried out the door before I could utter another word. 

Stunned, I walked over to my coffee table and sat the bag on top. I uncovered the object and saw, what I thought might be, some sort of covered vase. The top looked so beautiful but proved too heavy for me to lift out of the bag, so I guiltily tore the bag to see the vase’s full glory. That was when I noticed that this thing was not a vase.

This was a blue ceramic urn. The length of it covered with paintings of blossoms, with dark blue flowers lining the top and bottom. It was stunning, utterly captivating. It had a drawl to it, that made me want to inspect every inch. I still cannot explain why. During my examination, I noticed an inscription on the bottom.

HOWEVER— I had to get the Dagne Dover phone sling as I travel a ton and love this brand and its eco conscious design. Not sure why there was so much hate on the sling. Made me question whether to get it, but I have to say: after seeing and feeling it in person, this was 100% worth it for me!

Normally Dagne Dover’s phone sling is $75. This is missing their mesh pocket on the outside, so let’s just make the value of this $60. The color made me gasp. It’s this gorgeous red burgundy that is SO vibrant and rich looking. Im sorry, but she is STUNNING. Like if dark divine feminine is your vibe, this phone sling is IT! Then the quality: VERY well made. Neoprene is pristine. Waterproof. Sewn well. Sling fits my big ass iPhone 14 Pro Max effortlessly. Room for your credit cards and even an elastic for your lip gloss. Hardware is sturdy and high quality. Adjusting the strap is effortless and smooth. The strap itself is strong and comfortable. 

I can easily see myself wearing this to get coffee, go thrifting, and run errands as well as travel. Despite having to spend $125, this was 100% worth it for me. I wanted those blushes anyway and that YSL perfume just smells divine. The false lashes are mid, but if I was gonna spend the 125, I might as well get 4X points. Im on a blush kick right now, so im really excited to try the Tower 28 blushes and the Nars multiple stick. 

Lemme know what your favorite blush is below! Like, if you could only use ONE blush for the rest of your life, which one would it be?

Hi everyone,

Like many of you, I've spent too many weekends staring at my messy apartment, feeling completely overwhelmed. I wanted to clean, but I just couldn't bring myself to start. There was always too much to do, and I'd end up doing nothing at all.

I looked at a lot of existing cleaning apps, but they all felt like a chore themselves. ""Clean your kitchen sink, vacuum the living room, mop the bathroom..."" The lists were so long they just made me feel even more stressed.

So, I decided to build a simple app to solve this specific problem: **the overwhelming feeling of not knowing where to start.**

**Introducing CleanSprint.**

It's a super simple, AI-powered app. Here’s how it works:

1. **You take a picture of your messy room.**
2. **The AI identifies tasks which takes less than 5 minutes.**
3. You complete easy tasks and your room gets clean.

The goal isn't to get your whole apartment spotless in one day. The goal is to get you to do **tiny things**. Once you do that, it's often a lot easier to do the next thing, and the next.

I’m looking for some beta testers to give me feedback. Would you be willing to try it out and tell me what you think? Your honest thoughts would be incredibly helpful.

I know this feeling is so common, and I hope this can help some of you feel a little less overwhelmed.",5,1755397025.0,LivingAlone,2,0.86,False

I started taking 250mg testosterone a week broken into 2 shots, Monday and Thursday. But I'm just stuck at 230lbs and have been for a while. I've reduced my calories, but my workout routine is still the same. I lift weights 6 days a week. Everything has been fine with my weight loss, until the last few months

Will increasing my testosterone to 300mg a week or maybe more help drop this last 30lbs?

My routine is pretty simple.

When I first wake up in the morning, I'll have coffee and a protein shake. I'll hit the gym around 10am for about 2 hours and come home to eat.

What I eat after a workout is pretty simple.

I'll cook a pound of lean ground turkey, and a bag of peppers and onions, I'll spilt this into 2 meals.

So my first meal is the half pound turkey and I'll have half a sweet potato and some corn with it.

Second meal would be the other half of the turkey and peppers. Nothing else. I do use some hot sauce and a little bit of honey.

After the second meal a couple hours later I'll have some greek yogart. Then, a few hours later I'll do another protein shake. This is giving me about 190g of protein and around 1600 calories. There are days when I have a little less calories tho. 

This is gonna sound crazy, but... It's starting to consume my life. It's all I can focus on, it's ruined relationships, and my job. 

I really need some advice...

1msett3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1msett3/a_classification_of_the_best_and_the_worst_guests/,A classification of the best and the worst guests,"While I was observing my Saturday guests, I was thinking about who would be my best and worst guests and I though about making a little classification. These are very broad generalizations, and exceptions apply to each category in the best and the worst ones. Trigger warning, some people may be offended, especially by one category, but this is really what I have observed throughout the years.

BEST GUESTS
1-Workers (subclassification 1-regular corporate workers, 2-regular blue collar workers 3-corporate workers 4-blue collar workers). While there are some issues once in a while, they know how hotels work, they don't care about the view or amenities, they check-in, we don't see them after that, they are in bed early. They may complain if they get woken up at 10 pm by disrespectful guests. The regulars know all the employees and we know them. We see them on a regular basis over the span of several years. Short chit chat, mostly goes very well.

2-school groups, with only teachers, no parents. The trip is paid by the school. There is going to be a little bit of noise when they check-in. They usually have a curfew and strict rules to follow. They don't care about the view or the room decor or whatever. Never had any issues up to now

3-International travellers: it's most of the time not their first trip out of their country. They know how the travel industry works. 

4-Families visiting relatives, coming to ski, doing bike riding, passing by or coming for a sports competition (but where there isn't a bunch of them staying at this hotel): they travel on a regular basis, they know how hotels work, they will maybe enjoy the pool, they be outside the hotel most of the time, in their room early, uneventful.

5-Ski people, athletes performing at a sports competition or volunteers for the competition, at the exception of groups of bros. They are used to travelling, in bed early. Exception made of tonight, I just had a violent confrontation with a volunteer because I asked him for his credit card, I'm still shaken up 

6-Local celebrities and politicians, coming in for a stand-up or a music show or for their party's congress. They are not international stars, but are well known in this part of the country. The room is paid by the promoter of the show or their party. They don't want to appear like assholes as they don't want bad publicity on them. Mostly goes well.

WORST GUESTS
1-Hockey people. By far. By very far. They traumatized me so much, I can't even hear about hockey on the radio or see anything hockey related on TV or on the news. The most disrespectful animals I have ever seen. They are the biggest reason why I'm looking for another job now. I can't imagine going through one more season of hockey. Even in the midst of the summer, they inhabit my nightmares.

2-walk-ins paying cash (the worst) or debit who don't have a credit card. Bonus points if they want a suite or a room with a Jacuzzi. They are usually the trashiest people you can imagine and almost always something happens.

3-golf or ski bros: groups of men aged 45 and under, gathering together, drunk most of duration of their stay, as rowdy as hockey kids. Utterly displeasant people.

4-people calling on a Friday for a jacuzzi room, which often overlaps with category no 2, but even when they have a credit card, they are ... not the most classy people. They expect a 5 star hotel but they book the cheapest jacuzzi room they can find.

5-construction workers on vacation. While they are amongst our best guests when they are here for work, when they are on vacation with their family, all hell breaks loose. They book with debit cards, declining cards issues, they make a huge mess, they pester the front desk every 5 minutes, they complain about everything and anything. They all take their vacation at the same period of the year and it's a nightmare.

6-members of a certain older generation. Some are sweet, others are just so entitled. They book the cheapest room they find but expect big Hotel amenities, they want the best view possible despite booking the cheapest room of the hotel. They can also complain about anything and everything, from the complimentary coffee offered in the room, the shampoo, the layout of the furniture, the breakfast. Anything and everything. They want discounts even if they booked third party. They throw tantrums like 2 yo toddlers. My older family members act the same way with service people, it's embarassing.

7-Families coming for one specific family attraction we have in the area here. I'm not sure why, but it seems to attract a specific type of crowd with often declining cards, unrealistic expectations, noisy kids and they make a huge mess in the rooms. This overlaps with point no 5. 

8-Visa Debit people with no traditional credit cards. I have been one of these people in the past. I have been annoyed getting hit by invalid credit card warnings when trying to book hotels. But unfortunately, a lot of these people are just problematic. Their cards decline, they unreliably show up and cause all kinds of issues when they do show up. They argue when we ask them for an extra deposit. This category overlaps with several of the other categories.

8-This one will be the most controversial and may bring on down votes and criticism, but I have to say there are often difficulties with immigrants coming from one specific continent. The difficulties are around three points: poor literacy skills, which can be understandable, but causes difficulties with them not understanding what they booked or the policies, no credit cards or credit cards with low limits, due to no credit history in the country, which is also understandable, but causes declining transactions, and unrealistic expectations, because for the same price in their country of origin, they can stay in a 5 star resort. On top of that, the cultural differences can cause a clash. Some people from some countries of that continent act in a very slow way, which can cause very long lines behind them when you have to explain on top of that to them what they booked and why the credit card etc etc. And a lot people from that continent, whatever the country, tend to have loud phone or FaceTime conversations on speakerphone in the lobby, which is quite disruptive. They cause much less problems than all the above categories, but these difficulties come back often and can be heavy during the summer vacations.

I used to work two jobs as a barista and a bartender which meant a lot of work hence getting tired but even after that I had so much energy. I left my job a few days back to just rest. But it’s been 6 days I haven’t slept at all. 

I just close my eyes to rest, but then I have so many thoughts. Thoughts that I can control. They sometimes feel like dreams but I can control them to a level where I can just snap out of it and open my eyes. I haven’t smoked up in 4 months and haven’t drank in 3 months. I don’t drink coffee at all since I have caffeine anxiety. Idk what the problem is. I have tried listening to calming music, tried teas, changed sleeping positions, tried to make myself tired, read books, watched shows, nothing helps. It seems like my head is always on alert.

Back then, I was told by my pediatrician to just take probiotic supplements. It didn't help, and I felt like my doctor was brushing off my symptoms. I managed my symptoms at the time by taking kaopectate as needed and I had to know where restrooms were at all times, just in case.

When I turned 18, I got a new doctor. She had me take an IgE allergy test and it turned out that I had developed a sensitivity to many grains including corn, rice, oats, and of course, wheat. She told me to avoid these and see if it helps. And this did actually help, significantly! I didn't cut them out entirely, but I limited myself to one meal with grains a day and ate grain-free for my other meals. I only really had symptoms when I ate too many pastries or had multiple grain meals a day for a few days in a row. It was pretty heavily correlated, so that made it easy to control. Since I had dealt with IBS previously, I always made a point to acknowledge how much healthier I felt without the constant symptoms. I was very grateful. However, this only lasted 3-4 years.

For the past roughly 4 years, my digestion hasn't been the same. Looking through other people's stories, I haven't seen anyone describe their symptoms the same as mine, so I'm wondering if my symptoms are something else entirely. The main issue is a throbbing/pulsating feeling in my intestines, around/below my belly button, and it kinda feels like a heartbeat. It's like my guts are tensed up and working extra hard to digest. When I feel it on its own it's not so bad, it just feels a little weird. However, it's usually accompanied by a bubbly and gurgly feeling. That's what makes me feel awful and sick. There's days when I don't feel it, so I know it's not just normal digestion. It gets triggered randomly, regardless of what I do or what I eat. My diet is largely the same as before, although I have cut out gluten entirely. I eat more rice, but it's not something I eat for every meal.

I did have (decaf) cold brew coffee last night and that seemed to trigger it, but it's not always obvious for me what's causing it.

I've tried switching my diet around without any luck. I've tried cutting out all grains, but the lack of carbs only made me nauseous, lightheaded, and I didn't have much of an appetite. I've tried the low FODMAP diet and I generally avoid FODMAPs on a daily basis, but I still get symptoms.

Strangely, it tends to get worse *after* I have a bad or loose bowel movement. In the past, I'd feel relief after a bout of diarrhea with maybe just some fatigue, but these days, my gut still feels achy and bubbly for a day or sometimes days after. I've also been struggling with GERD, which can make me feel really sick when that flares up too. I've lost a lot of weight because of this, I'm scared of a lot of foods, and I really don't feel healthy anymore. It's horrible for my QOL and I feel hopeless a lot.

I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy earlier this year and I was only diagnosed with gastritis and GERD. The doctor said my villi looked fine and I didn't get anything back for celiac. This was disappointing for me since I'm still left looking for answers.

I've been taking one 500mg L-Glutamine, one 10mg Amitriptyline daily, Activia yogurt, and I take peppermint oil supplements before my meals. With these, I'm not getting worse, but I'm also not really noticing any improvement.

Ever since these symptoms started, I haven't gone a full month without any issues. I can't eat or enjoy things I used to be able to. It's disheartening, especially since the things that used to help me no longer do.

1msekc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1msekc3/thoughts_on_carnivore_and_binge_eating_my/,Thoughts on Carnivore and Binge Eating (my experience),"I’d like to share my experience as I’m just coming out of a binge and I’ve been carnivore for almost two years. I was Keto before that and Low Carb since 2012. 

As one does, I’ve struggled on and off with food. In an effort to lose weight, maintain weight, etc, my brain became faulty (read Brain over Binge) and I would occasionally binge. Probably ten to fifteen times in my lifetime. Or I would get the midnight munchies and while not bingeing, I would eat something on some nights. I never purged (except maybe for exercising more, but not vomiting) and I noticed that sugar set me off. If I had sugar, then I just wouldn’t stop. I started noticing this in 2016 when my new sister in law started baking amazing stuff! But one year later I went Keto. However when she did bake stuff and I indulged, I couldn’t stop. I’d eat half a cake or pie easily.

When I went Keto, I became even more aware of my sugar-tasting addiction as I would live for the weekends when I could eat Keto desserts and cakes. I’d overeat these things, perhaps not bingeing but definitely overeating. And on some occasions, I’d binge eat. When I say binge, I mean eating sugary-tasting things until past the point of satiety, until you’re sick and with a mentality of : “I might as well eat all I can today because I’m never doing this again.” It’s the typical addictive response before a binge, any kind of binge. The addictive voice, if you will. 

I went Carnivore, not in an effort to lose weight but because I wanted to get rid of the addiction to sweet taste. I would drink coffee (medium sized mug) with ten packets of Splenda, for instance. And I’d drink coffee not for the coffee, but for the sweetness. And on weekends I would eat two to three Keto pastries in one sitting. Then I’d stop, until the next weekend. 

My brain was so tired of thinking about Keto treats and the weekend. And I knew I had a problem when one day, for my niece’s birthday (she was visiting from abroad and staying with me), I bought all her favorite sugary treats (cakes, pastries, etc) and I binged on them. Like all day. And this was sugar, real sugar. And I couldn’t eat for 24 hours after that because I couldn’t move. 

So I tried to find a WOE that would satiate me (on Keto, I was mainly eating chicken, some eggs and salad; sometimes a pumpkin casserole, but mainly chicken and I was usually hungry). 

I found Carnivore in Sept 2023 and lo and behold, the urge for sweet stuff was gone. I only ate meat, butter and eggs. I lost around twenty pounds, and my size went down to the same size I wore as a teen. 

But most importantly, my sweet cravings were gone. I also quit sweeteners. 

I added loads of walking to the mix. 

As time went by (this year) I realized I was overeating (Carnivore foods but overeating). I couldn’t have one slice of cheese, that would turn into 200 grams of cheese. Or I would eat two pounds of beef, when only one would have sufficed at a meal. It wasn’t bingeing per se, but it was overeating. Probably stress-related - more on that later. 

Since September 2023 (when I started Carnivore) I’ve had two or three real binge episodes. Usually on Holidays when I overeat cheese. Once on peanut butter which I knew wasn’t carnivore and I ate the whole jar. 

And they usually start like this:

I begin to remember and fantasize about how great Keto pastries tasted. Or other foods (but mostly Keto as I really don’t do sugar since I started Keto in 2017).
I begin to add a bit of sweetener to my coffee when I’m out as a “treat”, because I “deserve” it.
I walk past pastry shops (my city is FULL OF THEM) and I marvel at the beautiful display windows and wow, “what must they taste like”. 
I begin to imagine, with more intensity what Keto pastries tasted like and I start browsing delivery stores. 
This will last for weeks. 
Until one day I open the delivery app and order Keto Pastries and I binge.

Last Thursday I ordered one huge slice of Keto chocolate and dulce de leche cake (two slices in one), two large Keto pastries and twelve Keto coconut balls (bombs). I ate all of this in like four hours. At night, I thought I’d have to go to the emergency room because the sugar alcohol sweetener (xylitol and erithrytol) almost killed my gut - it filled me with so much gas I couldn’t move. 

I felt so ashamed and I spent so much money (that I don’t have). 

Now, to add to the mix, I’ve been dealing with severe family problems that I, as the head of the family, take care of. It all falls on me. I’ve also had financial struggles because I’m helping a family member who hasn’t been able to find a job in two years, so I help him out. This same family member has had mental struggles that have led to some very bad behavior that has seriously impacted my life and finances. 

I’m Christian and I’d be remiss if I don’t give the Lord all my gratitude and glory because He has always ALWAYS come through with financial provision, with comfort and with help. Actually, last month, things began to improve. And my family member pretty much hit rock bottom and decided to get help and go back to his relationship with God. 

But, I believe the above stress also played a part in my binge of this week. It was probably just boiling underneath the surface and while I cling to God and find my peace in Him (I really do), I’m also human, and well, it all hit me with delay, I guess… so I’ve extended grace to myself, just as God extends his grace. 

Anyway, all of this that I’ve written above, and that I’m still processing shows me that bingeing starts in the mind. As a pesky little inclination to indulge in a thought (how yummy that must taste) which spirals into longer, bigger thoughts until the urge kicks in, and I let the urge win. 

I used to use the RAIM method for any intrusive or unwanted thought and I didn’t use it this time. I let my sugary fantasies get the best of me. 

RAIM is: 

R is for realization (“oh, this is a thought that just popped up and isn’t good for me)
A for acknowledge (“ok, brain, I acknowledge I’ve had this thought”).
I for ignore (I choose to ignore this thought)
M for move on - ( I move on and continue doing whatever it is I was doing or doing something else). 

(I came up with this method and it worked wonders for me, I compiled it from different sources some years ago, specially Brain Over Binge)

So, after this binge, which is the worst I’ve had since 2007 or so, I prayed, spent some quiet time with God, wrote down some things; read several good Reddit posts and folks who are coming out of binges while on Carnivore and got back on track.

I sincerely hope I didn’t derail my progress, but since I’ve been Keto for five or six years before Carnivore, I guess I might get into Ketosis faster. I like being at my current weight/size, I feel healthier, lighter… I wouldn’t want to put on any weight (nor lose any more for that matter). 

I realize that one day is just one day, and while I feel disappointed about my binge, I learned quite a lot and feel better equipped to deal with: stress, intrusive or unwanted thoughts and sleep (get better sleep) in order to safeguard my peace and continue on this path.

Huge hugs to everyone and thank your for reading this “novel” of a post!

## Key Features Analysis

the ideal leather briefcase for women goes beyond aesthetics; it should offer a range of features tailored to the needs of the contemporary professional.

**Material:** The type and quality of leather used significantly impact the briefcase's durability, appearance, and longevity. Full-grain leather, known for its robustness and natural beauty, will develop a rich patina over time, adding character and charm.Top-grain leather, a slightly more processed alternative, offers a smoother finish and greater resistance to stains.Suede or nubuck can provide unique textures but demand more careful maintenance. Briefcases crafted from premium Italian or American leather are frequently enough considered the gold standard, guaranteeing superior quality and craftsmanship.

Consider the tanning process as well; vegetable-tanned leather is more environmentally pleasant than chrome-tanned, resulting in a distinctive look and feel.

**Compartment Association:** An intelligently designed interior is crucial for keeping your belongings organized and easily accessible. Look for a dedicated padded compartment capable of accommodating laptops up to 15 or 16 inches, plus additional pockets for tablets, notebooks, pens, cards, and smartphones. Expandable compartments provide added flexibility for carrying bulkier items or accommodating unexpected additions.

Zippers and closures should be smooth and reliable, ensuring secure containment and effortless access to your essentials.**Size and Weight:** The dimensions and weight of the briefcase should be proportional to your body type and carrying preferences. A briefcase that is too large can feel cumbersome and impractical, while one that is too small may compromise functionality. Consider the average load you typically carry and choose a size that comfortably accommodates your essentials without being unnecessarily bulky.

Lightweight construction is essential, particularly if you frequently commute or travel. Many modern briefcases incorporate lightweight materials and ergonomic designs to minimize strain and maximize comfort.

**Straps and Handles:** The carrying options significantly impact comfort and versatility. Padded top handles should be sturdy and cozy to grip, even when the briefcase is fully loaded. A detachable and adjustable shoulder strap allows for hands-free carrying, distributing weight evenly across your shoulder. Consider the material and construction of the strap; a wide, leather-reinforced strap with a cushioned pad minimizes shoulder strain.

Some briefcases also offer a trolley sleeve, allowing you to securely attach the bag to a rolling suitcase for effortless airport navigation.

**Hardware and Detailing:** The quality of the hardware, including zippers, buckles, clasps, and feet, is a subtle indicator of overall craftsmanship and attention to detail. Look for solid brass or stainless-steel hardware, which is durable and resistant to corrosion. Reinforced stitching at stress points enhances the briefcase's structural integrity, ensuring it can withstand daily wear and tear.

Subtle details, such as embossed logos, decorative stitching, or distinctive lining, can elevate the briefcase's aesthetic appeal and reflect your personal style.

**Security Features:** In today's digital age,security is paramount. Look for briefcases with lockable compartments or RFID-blocking technology to protect your sensitive information from unauthorized access. Discreetly integrated pockets can provide a safe haven for valuables such as wallets or jewelry.

Reinforced bottoms and water-resistant linings can safeguard your belongings from accidental spills or inclement weather.

1msehb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1msehb5/my_dad_and_grandpa_were_a_couple_dont_wait_until/,My dad and Grandpa were a couple (Don't wait until it's too late),"I just read [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/s/5cKVlWN67j) and I just had to put this I have out there in case you're in a similar boat.

My dad and my (not biological) grandpa were a couple and lived in multiple states together before my dad married my mom.

""Grandpa"" moved in with us before I was born. He was always there for my brother and I. Took us to school everyday, helped us with homework, he even took us to our first time clubbing, our first zoo visit, our first movie in the theater, most of our firsts really. 🥲 

My mom is simply awesome and she told us to call him grandpa even though we had different last names because people would not understand why he lived with us. It never was weird for us.

My dad always taught us the value of hard work. Grandpa and dad worked the same hours, but grandpa always had the extra time and disposition to listen to us without bias, to play, to joke with us... We had the most amazing childhood regular kids could ever ask for thanks to the love of them 3.

For reasons I don't know he left us for some years, and going through the stuff in his room I found out he was gay and my dad's partner at some point. My mom must have known and probably didn't care. She was always pure love.

I was just a troubled teen back then who had lost the most important male figure in his life and I was resented, so when he came back I was mad at him (and also troubled coming out). Nevertheless, he always supported me in all imaginable ways even when I was just a brat.

So I moved away at 17 and didn't come back for decades. I would visit every few years but I was still resented. However, grandpa would always call me every month to make sure I was ok.

When I was almost 30, I received a call from grandpa and he asked me about my partner, my future plans and he apologized for the time he left. I coldly accepted the apology and continued with my life.

6 days later, mom called me. Grandpa had died of Alzheimer's. 

The last time he spoke was the day when he called me. He also told my mom to tell me he was sorry. After that, they just lost him and he was no longer a ""person"". They asked me what the call was about but I just said ""the usual"".

I was ""busy with my work and life"" and missed his burial. I moved on for a year like nothing happened , and then one day I just started crying, and I couldn't stop. The thought of never really having told him how much I admired him, loved him and how much he meant to me was unberable. I missed work, asked for time off and went back home. 

Everything was horrible. Mom and dad were fighting all the time. Dad was (and is) still depressed. All the happiness, joy and laughter I felt everytime I opened that door died with grandpa. My family broke into pieces. Grandpa was the glue that joined us all together, and I could never thank him for it.

I have seen grandpa sometimes in dreams when I have had very harsh situations: He's there on his desk, sipping on his sugarless coffee, playing latin jazz, smiling and he tells me ""everything will be fine, mijito, just smile"". 

He will always be in my heart and will never ever again wait to apologize and tell anybody how much I love them, how much they mean to me. 

If you need to hear this, please, don't wait until it's too late. ",2,1755395635.0,askgaybros,5,0.62,False

I am a 27 year old man, 190 pounds, and eat a vegetarian diet. I have an active job bartending and do moderate exercise outside of that a few times a week. I only began to understand I had a relatively bad case of Candida overgrowth a month ago, but I have already started feeling substatially better. I have almost no brain fog, more than enough energy, not joint pain, and no bloating whatsoever. I thought I had long Covid for SO LONG but it just kept getting worse and worse, and I’m so grateful I finally found the answer. It was destroying my life and my relationships. The thought that others are struggling with this and can’t get better breaks my heart and I want to share my personal recovery routine in the hopes it can benefit you.

4 WEEK PLAN

Medicinal components: 

-150mg Fluconazole tablets 1x per week for 4 weeks
-starting on week 2, 1g of Host Defense turkey tail and 1g of reishi mushrooms 1x per day (never taking on the same day as fluconazole to prevent extreme and sudden die-off)
-Aloe Vera supplements 1-2x per day
-Fiber supplements alongside any meal containing insufficient fiber content
-Herbal tea 2x per day containing tumeric, ginger, clove, cinnamon, and cardamom.
-Apple cider vinegar diluted in warm water to create a more acidic digestive track to minimize Candida yeast morphing into hyphae during anti fungal treatments.
-probiotic containing L. Acidophilus, L. Rhamanous and L. Plantarum 1x per day starting on week 2 (there were other strains but I believe these are critical)

Dietary components:

-week 1 of 4 eliminating all refined/added sugar, high sugar fruits (keeping only blueberries for antioxidants and bananas for smoothies), and also eliminating alcohol, dairy, and caffiene. (If you’re worried about caffiene withdrawal, trust me. The energy you will have from not getting your carbs stolen from a parasite beats 100 cups of coffee).
-week 2 of 4 eliminating gluten and any vinegar other than apple cider vinegar. Eliminate any food with possible cross contamination with mold such as peanuts and cashews. Eliminate any fermented food like kimchi (making an exception for yogurt), and begin taking the probiotic pills in their place. Replace gluten with complex carbs like brown rice.
-week 3 of 4 eliminate any major source of carbohydrates except a very small amount for breakfast. Begin consuming apple cider vinegar strategically before you eat. Dilute some in warm water before breakfast, drink it all before eating, and then consume a high protein meal with some carbohydrate. Scrambled tumeric eggs with tzaziki sauce with a side of spinach with olive oil, salt, and pepper was a great one for me. Immediately after eating the carbohydrate, take an antifungal like the turkey tail, reishi, or pharmaceutical like fluconazole (WARNING: this is creating a large die off reaction by design. You will not feel happy! All of the yeast that morphed into hyphae to stay alive are brought back to yeast with this method due to the presence of acidic environment and carbohydrates. This is bringing Candida back to yeast from dormancy and I believe this is CRITICAL for long term recovery.) not eating any carbs for the rest of the day is also very important, because they do need to go through periods of starvation alongside antifungal treatment.
-week 4 of 4 continue strategies from week 3, monitor for signs of recovery like higher energy levels, absence of bloating, and consistent solid stool. If there are still persisting issues, focus heavily on eating large amounts of dark leafy greens like spinach and arugula with every meal, eating some before and some after. They are alkaline foods, which will make Candida yeast less likely to eat your carbohydrates when they’re present.

For those struggling with oral thrush as well, ketoconazole + letting them dry out helped my lips, and chewing dried coconut shavings at regular intervals throughout the day got rid of my white tongue and the bad taste in my mouth. The caprylic acid in organic coconut is far more powerful than people give it credit for! Brushing teeth 2x per day and not eating after the nighttime brush is non-negotiable.

REMEMBER: Candida releases toxins like acetaldehyde and uric acid when it EATS, *AND* when it DIES. You will feel negative symptoms under both circumstances, and a key symptom difference I noticed between the two is I only got NAUSEA during die off. Unfortunately, when a treatment for this is making us better, it makes us feel worse first. This is actually a good sign, but if your body is feeling too burdened with the die off, YOU NEED TO TAKE BREAKS AND ALWAYS STAY HYDRATED. This process releases an immense amount of brain damaging toxins into your system, and you need to not push yourself too hard. Easing up should NEVER mean overconsuming carbs, because that is back tracking, but it does mean taking breaks from the antifungal meds and herbs as needed.

1mse9vw,https://i.redd.it/51uak7tzhhjf1.png,"Betrayed by Alpha, Stronger Than Ever","# Chapter 1

At two in the morning, a call from my Alpha mate Merrick Thorne jolted me awake.



His voice was low and hoarse, tinged with panic. ""Lina, something's happened.""



I froze. ""Aren't you on a business trip? What's wrong?""



He paused for a long moment, as if struggling to find the words. ""Liliane... she's pregnant. Five months along.""



My mind exploded with a thunderous crash. ""You two?""



""No,"" he immediately explained. ""We never had any kind of relationship.""



I hadn't even had time to feel relieved when Merrick continued, ""The healer just contacted me. She collapsed, and I'm listed as her emergency contact. She's still in the ER.""



When I arrived, the healer had just emerged. Thankfully, it was a false alarm. ""The fetus is stable. We suspect the fainting was caused by malnutrition.""



Merrick leaned against the wall, his voice barely a whisper, as if his throat was blocked. ""She did something foolish. She used my sperm.""



""What?"" I whipped around, utterly shocked.



Merrick explained, ""Remember that joint experiment I participated in with Sablecourt Pack in Calverin a few years ago? We all provided samples for genetic screening research. She... took mine. She said she didn't want status or money. She just wanted to give me a child. She knew you couldn't have children. She knew I actually... really wanted one.""



My head buzzed, and I couldn't tell if what I felt was anger or absurdity.



This was the most hidden, most silent crack in our mate bond—something we tacitly never discussed.



And now, it was an outsider who had inserted herself using this method.



For a moment, my mind flashed through so many emotions—the fury of being betrayed by my mate, anger, sadness...



It felt like a thousand words were waiting for me to scream them in hysterical accusation.



""The patient is awake."" The healer's interruption stopped the volcanic eruption.



In the ward, Liliane slowly opened her eyes. The first person she saw was me.



She struggled to sit up, her hands trembling as she grabbed my arm, her voice hoarse but determined. ""Luna, I never intended to have any future with Alpha from the beginning. I know I have no right, but I want to give him a pup and complete your family. Please let me have this pup.""



I stood there, looking at her haggard but stubborn eyes, feeling like I couldn't breathe.



Merrick stood behind me, his voice low. ""Lina, the pup is innocent. So is she.""



I let out a bitter laugh. ""Merrick, you waited five months to tell me. You really know how to manipulate me.""



He remained silent.



I had known for a long time that Liliane was different from others.



Her warrior father had died fighting for Silvermoon Pack. Since she was entrusted to Merrick at nineteen, she had always lingered on the edges of our lives.



Over the years, Merrick not only paid for her education and took care of her living expenses, but he also housed her in an apartment just three subway stops from our home, often personally picking her up and dropping her off.



Liliane never hid her feelings.



Those so-called ""coincidences""—late-night texts asking for help, showing up at our door in thin clothing claiming her pipes had burst, conveniently falling ill when I was away on business trips and needing his care...



She grew bolder each time.



Unfortunately, Merrick never truly had the heart to refuse her.



He would keep a cold face and say it was ""inappropriate,"" but he never really cut ties.



Merrick said, ""Her father died for Silvermoon Pack. She's alone and helpless. I can't be too heartless.""



He thought he was being clear enough, but he didn't understand.



For a woman who had harbored feelings for him for so long, as long as he left any opening, it was enough to weave fantasies.



I nodded. ""The pup has nothing to do with me. If you want to have it, go ahead.""

# Chapter 2

My mind was in chaos, but I wasn't just the Luna of Silvermoon Pack—I was also a scientific researcher.



I happened to have a project that required travel during this period.



By the time I returned, the pup had been born—a baby boy.



I stood at the hospital room doorway, hearing laughter from within.



Merrick had once said, ""In this world, you're the one I care about most.""



But at this moment, he was carefully lifting the swaddled pup, his voice tender. ""Don't cry, Daddy's little darling. Daddy loves you most in this whole world.""



Liliane was flipping through a parenting handbook. ""This pup has your nose, but his eyes look like mine.""



Merrick agreed, ""Yes, let's call him Evren Thorne. He'll be the future Alpha heir of Silvermoon Pack.""



I stood right there in the doorway, but neither of them noticed me.



I couldn't help but clear my throat softly.



Merrick looked up, his gaze settling on me. In that instant, his smile abruptly faded. ""Lina.""



I walked in, and the room fell silent.



Liliane looked at me pitifully and said, ""Lina, if you don't like me, I'll raise the child myself. He won't step foot in the pack house.""



She had called me Luna before, but now she was calling me Lina.



Previously, she said she'd give me the pup after birth, but now it became her raising him alone.



I smiled. ""Liliane, I didn't realize you were so considerate of me.""



Her eyes reddened. ""I know Alpha has always wanted a child. I wanted to fulfill that wish for you.""



I stared at her and threw the documents in my hand onto her bed. ""Legal consequences for unauthorized use of genetic material. You have a scientific background. I don't believe you didn't know this was illegal.""



Her face went pale, her lips trembling.



Suddenly, the pup burst into loud cries.



Merrick immediately held him close, soothing him in low tones.



In that moment, I suddenly realized that regardless of who was right or wrong, this pup would forever stand between us.



I turned to leave, but Merrick caught the hem of my shirt. ""Lina! Thank you for not pursuing this, but there's something else I need to discuss with you. Liliane just gave birth and her recovery is slow. The healer recommends continued rest. Crescent Grove has good sunlight and complete facilities... After she's discharged, could she temporarily stay there? I could take care of her...""



My throat tightened, and I almost bit out the words, ""Live in our house?""



""She has no other family."" When he said this, his eyes were as clear and calm as always. ""Lina, she just needs some help.""



I looked at Merrick, my throat feeling like it was stuffed with cotton, making it hard to breathe.



""What about me?"" I asked softly, ""If you bring her home, what about me? Do I have to live under the same roof as her?""



Merrick suggested, ""If you really find it inappropriate... you could move to Easton Manor for now. It's farther from the research center, but quieter.""



So that was it. I smiled bitterly and turned to leave.



At this point, I needed to consider whether this mate bond was worth maintaining.



I met Merrick ten years ago at a thesis defense.



I had just returned to Silvermoon Pack, and he attended as a special guest, sitting in the back row, his suit impeccable, even his cufflinks fastened perfectly.



Most people asked polite, official questions, but he directly targeted the weakest point in my logical reasoning. ""I've read your previous paper published in JNS. Your proof abilities are solid.""



In that moment, I had a strange feeling—he wasn't trying to undermine me, but to remind me not to let habitual thinking drag me down.



The mind link formed in that instant.



Everything that followed was natural.



My soul fell in love with him after we shared a particularly ordinary meal.



That day, we had argued endlessly over work, and he suddenly fell silent for a long time before taking me to a small noodle shop behind the school.



A tiny table, we hadn't eaten properly.



He picked the chili peppers out of my bowl and wiped soup splashes off my sleeve with a napkin.



He said, ""Lina, your edge is a good thing. But not every battle needs to be won. People need to save their strength for more important things.""



Looking at him then, I suddenly understood—I would become this man's mate.



But now, I couldn't understand where things had gone wrong.



If it was about pup, then he was the one who owed me.

# Chapter 3

The year we first formed our mate bond, we encountered an accident during a trip.



Instinctively, I shielded him. When that blade came down, I only felt heat in my abdomen, like something was tearing me apart.



He was the one who carried me into the pack hospital, the one who knelt outside the emergency room, pounding his chest and crying until his voice was raw.



That night, his whole body trembled as he gripped my hand repeatedly, saying, ""Lina, I'm sorry. I swear, in this lifetime, having you as my only treasure is enough.""



He spoke so sincerely, cried so heartbreakingly.



After that, I truly never brought up pup again.



But Liliane had given birth to his child.



I typed a message on my phone: \[Merrick, I want to break our mate bond.\]



Less than half an hour later, the doorbell rang.



Merrick burst through the door, travel-worn. ""Lina, don't be impulsive.""



I didn't turn around, just put my phone back on the coffee table. ""It's not impulsive. It's long-overdue clarity.""



He walked over and sat in the single chair across from me, silent for a long time. ""She needs time to recover. We agreed that after a month, I'll give her money and send her to Calverin. The pup will stay home, and she'll never come back.""



I laughed. ""Merrick, do you really think you've done nothing wrong?""



He froze.



I looked at him, enunciating each word, ""You knew she coveted you, knew she stole your sperm to get pregnant, yet you still gave her hope. You not only indulged her feelings for you but also stayed by her side during delivery. Now you're willing to send her away?""



He apologized, ""I'm sorry, it's all my fault. But Lina, the child is already born. This is a life—we can't abandon him.""



""What about me?"" I lost control and raised my voice. ""Have you thought about me? Don't you know why I can't have children? Don't I deserve to be protected?""



His Adam's apple bobbed, but he said nothing.



I looked at him, my eyes stinging. ""You said she was too weak and needed proper rest. Fine, we could spend money on a hospital or a good postpartum center, or find a nice hotel and hire several nannies. But you refused. She said she only trusted you, and you surrendered, giving up our home and throwing me out. Search your heart—do you really want a child, or do you want to take care of them, mother and son?""



He stared at me, silent to the point of harshness.



Then his phone rang.



He glanced at the screen, hesitated, but still answered.



""Merrick, I feel dizzy, and my wound has reopened. Could you come over?"" It was Liliane's voice, filled with grievance and vulnerability.



Merrick was silent for a few seconds, looking at me, then down at his phone, as if making a difficult decision. ""Lina, let me go check on her first. She just gave birth.""



I said nothing, just watched him stand and leave hurriedly.



The moment the door closed, I smiled softly.



No matter how much I cried or pleaded, it couldn't compare to one phone call from Liliane.



I knew he might never marry Liliane.



But he would be needed by her again and again, have his life disrupted by her again and again.



How much longer could I endure such days if I didn't break the mate bond? Three months? Three years? A lifetime?



I contacted a lawyer to draft the mating bond dissolution papers.



When I woke up again, my phone was ringing incessantly.



""Lina!"" Merrick's voice roared through the phone. ""If you have a problem, come to me!""



Before I could speak, he continued angrily, ""Why did you send Liliane those emails reporting her for stealing from the genetic bank? Her postpartum depression is already severe enough! Do you have to drive her to death?""



I was stunned.



I'd never sent those emails, but he convicted me without question—the first time my mate had ever yelled at me.



He shouted, ""Lina, the healer says her postpartum emotions are very unstable. If we hadn't discovered it early last night, she would have committed suicide! A living person—can't you show some compassion?""



I answered, ""Whether you believe it or not, I didn't do it, and I wouldn't stoop to such methods.""



""Lina, regardless, please—when she's discharged, come see her and apologize. Just for my sake. If you come, she'll be able to let go of her psychological burden..."" The man on the phone seemed to be crying, his voice trembling.



I wiped away the tears that had fallen and finally nodded. ""Alright.""



There would be no apology, but our relationship did need closure.

# Chapter 4

I arrived at the hospital as promised.



When Merrick saw me, he nodded. ""Lina, thank you for coming.""



When Liliane saw it was me, she suddenly became emotional, her eyes immediately reddening as she struggled to get up. ""Lina, please don't report me. I can't bear to leave my child. Please give us mother and son a little more time...""



As she spoke, she tremblingly knelt down before me.



The healer was frightened and quickly held her down. ""You just had a C-section—you can't kneel!""



Jenna hurried to support her, her tone reproachful. ""Lina, why have you become so cold?""



People around us stared, and I stood there having done nothing, yet I became the cold-blooded, vindictive villain.



Fortunately, Merrick still had some dignity and brought me to the car first.



When getting in, Liliane seemed to want to ease the tension.



She handed me the baby. ""Lina, hold him for a bit. The little one has been especially good today.""



Before I could agree, the child was placed in my arms.



He really was soft and sweet.



My heart softened for a moment.



But before the car had even left the hospital gates, the baby in my arms began to squirm, then let out a series of sharp cries.



""What's wrong?""



Liliane's expression changed, and she said tearfully, ""He's breaking out in a rash. Is he having another allergic reaction? The healer said the baby is allergic to perfume. Jenna gave him a rash a few days ago that just went away.""



""Hey, don't blame me. I didn't do anything,"" Jenna quickly defended herself.



Only me.



Merrick glanced at me, his expression displeased. ""Lina, are you wearing perfume?""



Before I could say anything, the baby's cries became more piercing, and dense red spots appeared on his face.



""Stop the car!"" Liliane shouted anxiously.



Merrick yanked the steering wheel and rushed into the hospital emergency lane.



As he got out with the baby, he lowered his voice and cursed, ""Acting like a wicked stepmother before you even are one. You really disappoint me!""



My hands trembled and I nearly collapsed in the bone-chillingly cold hospital corridor, standing there like a shell with its soul sucked out.



Jenna's eyes were full of disgust. ""How has Merrick wronged you? He never even cheated, and now you can't even tolerate a pup. You're too vicious.""



I kept my head down, saying nothing.



Merrick finally appeared. ""The healer says the child is out of danger.""



I looked at him, trying to explain, ""I didn't do it on purpose. I didn't know.""



But he wouldn't listen, immediately cutting me off.



His gaze held unfamiliar judgment. ""Lina, you've become someone I don't recognize—cold-blooded.""



I clutched the documents in my hand, my heart feeling like it was stuffed with a thousand-pound boulder.



Finally, with a trembling voice, I handed them over. ""Fine, I'll compensate you with a happy family. Merrick, let's... break the mate bond.""



He froze, then his eyes darkened, but he said nothing.



I didn't dare look at him again, afraid I might really break down and cry.



""Merrick."" Liliane appeared weakly at the ward door, her steps unsteady. ""Lina, if you're angry, take it out on me. Why hurt my child?""



Onlooking family members and nurses turned to stare, whispering among themselves.



""Is that the woman who made the child allergic and hospitalized?""



""She looks quite refined. How could she do such a thing?""



I opened my mouth but couldn't make a sound.



Merrick quickly walked over to support her, holding her protectively in his arms, his expression panicked. ""Your health is what matters.""



He turned back to look at me, his eyes cold as blades. ""Lina, come apologize to Liliane! Otherwise...""



I stuffed that crumpled paper into his hands. ""Otherwise, isn't this it?""



He looked down at it briefly, his lips pressed thin, but he still took it. ""Jealousy has made you lose your rationality. Separating for a while so you can calm down might be good.""



I laughed, but tears fell. ""Since you've already decided, don't ask me anymore.""

I’m very proud of myself.  Some changes include my going to bed by 930 and waking up early.  I find solace in the quiet time.  I exercise in the morning sometimes or just enjoy coffee and quiet.  I am not bored at all I just have no desire to stay up watching tv and usually will get in bed and read, scroll whatever.  I feel like my husband misses the time we spent together at night.  I even think he is jealous on some level of my desire to be alone.  Sometimes lately I find myself easily annoyed by him.   I try to hide it but I really just want to be left alone.  It occurs to me that in the 22 years we have been together probably a good 90% of those evenings were enjoyed with alcohol.  He enjoys cocktails at night and at first I was totally fine with that and he has been very supportive-drinking when I’m not home or in another room.  But I have a new take on the stuff and I really believe it is so bad for us.  I think he thinks I’m judging him.  And he may be a little right.   I am sad to wonder about how well we know each other alcohol free.   Wonder about if I would have fell for him if I had been 💯 sober.   I hope I would have.  He is a wonderful father and has high moral character.  But he is very sensitive to feeling I’m attacking him when I try and start conversations about certain things.   He is also kind of needy and when I don’t give him the right amount of attention he kind of passive aggressive ignores me.

The pictures below are arranged how I want them prior to being hung on the wall.  I had a patient of mine make a comment that the skull pictures were ""creepy.""  I was thrown off by this comment.  I get that they may not be everyone's taste, but creepy seems rather strong.  Perhaps I'm wrong though.  Or maybe not.   Please tell me what you think.

The first picture is just them arranged on the floor how they will hang on the wall.  The next picture just shows some chairs and a coffee table that will occupy the space along with the pictures.

Keep in mind that this is a work in progress.  The walls are being painted a brighter (less yellow) white and the cove base is being replaced as well.  There will be some combination of floor lamps and/or plants in the corners.

Please comment on the pictures 5 and 6 as well.  One is a cartoon drawing of a nurse giving an IV that is filled with hearts.  The second is a side view of a skeleton, it looks to be a reprint from an anatomy textbook.  I forget where I got it from.  Do they seem inappropriate/out of place in any way?

Thanks.

1mse6li,https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/1mse6li/au_iptv_update_20_nz_added/,AU IPTV - UPDATE 2.0 NZ added,"Reddit removed my previous post I have no idea why.   
  
Got sick of the clunky Aussie TV apps with potato quality and random crashes, so I built a Stremio addon that pulls the official Freeview-hosted live streams (plus a bunch of other legit streams) into one clean place.

**AU IPTV (v2.0):**  
**Base URL:** [https://mlv2yh442tgmghb4ypcuvwwcte0wmcdc.lambda-url.ap-southeast-2.on.aws/](https://mlv2yh442tgmghb4ypcuvwwcte0wmcdc.lambda-url.ap-southeast-2.on.aws/)

**What’s new in v2.0**

* 🇳🇿 **NZ support** (TV + Radio) with a curated NZ channel order
* 🧠 Option to **set NZ as default** (Genre “None” is hidden; NZ shows first)
* 📺 **Cleaner AU grouping**: Traditional / Other / Regional
* 🧭 Everything accessible from the **Genre** dropdown in Stremio (fewer catalogs, less clutter)

**How to install**

1. Open the base URL above — there’s a small configurator (pick your main city, include Radio/NZ, etc).
2. Click **Open in Stremio Web** or copy the **manifest.json** URL and paste it into Stremio.

**Direct manifest examples (you can paste these straight into Stremio):**

    /Brisbane/manifest.json
    /Brisbane/radio/manifest.json
    /Brisbane/nz/manifest.json
    /Brisbane/radio/nz/manifest.json
    /Brisbane/radio/nz/nzdefault/manifest.json
    

(Prepend the base URL, e.g.  
[https://mlv2yh442tgmghb4ypcuvwwcte0wmcdc.lambda-url.ap-southeast-2.on.aws/Brisbane/manifest.json]())

**What you’ll see in the Genre filter (inside Stremio)**

* **Traditional Channels** — ABC, SBS, NITV, Seven, Nine, Ten (default view)
* **Other Channels** — ABC Business, SBS specialty, etc.
* **All TV Channels** — Traditional + Other combined
* **Regional Channels** — local/regional feeds
* **Radio** — if you enabled it when installing
* **\[City\] TV** — switch to other AU capital cities
* **NZ TV / NZ Radio** — when NZ is enabled

**What this addon actually does**

* Uses the awesome data scraped by **Matt Huisman**: [https://i.mjh.nz/](https://i.mjh.nz/) (AU/NZ)
* Pulls **EPG + M3U8** from there and formats it for Stremio (I don’t host any streams)
* Light server footprint (Lambda), just a thin proxy/manifest generator

**Source**

* GitHub: [https://github.com/josharghhh/AU-IPTV\_StremioAddon](https://github.com/josharghhh/AU-IPTV_StremioAddon)

**Notes / caveats**

* EPG varies by channel and can be a bit quirky; tweaks ongoing.
* Regional channel naming can be weird across cities; send me the oddballs and I’ll tune the filters.
* If something 404s, re-open the base URL and regenerate your manifest with the options you want.

**If you want to support it (optional)**

* Instead of “buy me a coffee”, let me buy *you* one: **$10 free** via Hook — hook-up. me/joshargh[ ](https://hook.up.me/joshargh)
* Or help with server costs via PayPal — paypal. me/joshargh

Feedback welcome! If you find channels that should be “Traditional” vs “Other/Regional”, or NZ ordering that feels off, drop a comment and I’ll adjust.

He’s great, overall a really good boyfriend and person! The only thing that bothers me is how he’ll make comments about finding other women attractive. I don’t care if he looks or finds other girls attractive. He’s in a relationship, he’s not blind. My issue is when he tells me he finds another girl attractive. 

We’re long distance, so last month I went to visit him for 2 weeks. We went to a coffee shop and there was a girl who was helping us. After she left he said “she was cute hey.” I didn’t say anything. We were driving around and there were 2 girls walking with short shorts and tank tops, and he goes “wow look at that.” Again I didn’t say anything. Then me and him went to a store and I noticed a guy who was staring at my chest. When we got home I asked him if he noticed the guy staring at my chest, and he told me he didn’t cuz he was looking at that guys girlfriend. So I said “you didn’t notice another man staring at your girls tits cuz u were too busy staring at his girl?” We had a conversation after that about how it makes me uncomfortable hearing these kinds of things due to my past experiences with men. He told me he didn’t realize it was wrong because him and his ex would openly talk about other people they thought were attractive. He’s also stated that sometimes things come out wrong because his English isn’t the greatest, which I understand but I will also say his English is not as bad as he makes it out to be. 

So anyway, cut to last night. We were on the phone and he was talking about some work drama. He mentioned they had hired 2 new girls, and I asked him “are they good workers?” And he replied with “they’re good looking” and laughed a little. That upset me. He was supposed to come visit me tonight but I told him I don’t want him to come because I’m upset about what he said. He keeps apologizing, but he also said “if we don’t have the freedom to openly say what we think and feel, then idk.” He also said he thought he could talk to me about anything and that I would laugh with him. I feel like he thinks i’m controlling him, which isn’t the case at all. I’ve told him I understand this was the dynamic in his past relationship, but I’m not her. I don’t care if he looks at girls, I just don’t want to hear about it. Am I overreacting by telling him not to come tonight? ",2,1755394405.0,AITAH,3,0.76,False

I was recently listening to a podcast about Bipolar Disorder and its association with migraines, PMDD symptoms and familial depression and I have all of those things in my family. I believe I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and PMDD as an adolescent as well. However, I don't have the mania or high energy characteristic of bipolar disorder. What I read about mania says you become elated and euphoric and I remember being very worried and anxious during this time. Anyway, when I was in college I had an experience where one day after taking laxatives and drinking too much coffee I experienced symptoms of diarrhea, tingling in my hands, chest pain, and palpitations. I couldn't sleep for 1-2 days at a time because of palpitations and feelings like I needed to pace around. This was after the coffee was out of my system. I did feel that feeling where you want to sit but you can't sit still. It was terrible. I went to the ER twice and both times they said I was having a panic attack (untrue). It felt like the symptoms had come from nowhere. My heart rate and blood pressure were normal... However, my initial symptoms I felt in my body lasted for days and they took months to fully go away, to the point I was given an Ativan prescription and had to take extended leave from school and make myself a special ""sleep routine"" so I would be able to go to bed. The Ativan barely even did anything the dose was so low. I was never referred to a psychiatrist but I am wondering what happened to me. I've been scared of it happening again ever since because it totally upended my life.",1,1755394196.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

He’s great, overall a really good boyfriend and person! The only thing that bothers me is how he’ll make comments about finding other women attractive. I don’t care if he looks or finds other girls attractive. He’s in a relationship, he’s not blind. My issue is when he tells me he finds another girl attractive. We’re long distance, so last month I went to visit him for 2 weeks. We went to a coffee shop and there was a girl who was helping us. After she left he said “she was cute hey.” I didn’t say anything. We were driving around and there were 2 girls walking with short shorts and tank tops, and he goes “wow look at that.” Again I didn’t say anything. Then me and him went to a store and I noticed a guy who was staring at my chest. When we got home I asked him if he noticed the guy staring at my chest, and he told me he didn’t cuz he was looking at that guys girlfriend. So I said “you didn’t notice another man staring at your girls tits cuz u were too busy staring at his girl?” We had a conversation after that about how it makes me uncomfortable hearing these kinds of things due to my past experiences with men. He told me he didn’t realize it was wrong because him and his ex would openly talk about other people they thought were attractive. He’s also stated that sometimes things come out wrong because his English isn’t the greatest, which I understand but I will also say his English is not as bad as he makes it out to be. So anyway, cut to last night. We were on the phone and he was talking about some work drama. He mentioned they had hired 2 new girls, and I asked him “are they good workers?” And he replied with “they’re good looking” and laughed a little. That upset me. He was supposed to come visit me tonight but I told him I don’t want him to come because I’m upset about what he said. He keeps apologizing, but he also said “if we don’t have the freedom to openly say what we think and feel, then idk.” He also said he thought he could talk to me about anything and that I would laugh with him. I feel like he thinks i’m controlling him, which isn’t the case at all. I’ve told him I understand this was the dynamic in his past relationship, but I’m not her. I don’t care if he looks at girls, I just don’t want to hear about it.",2,1755394093.0,AITAH,2,0.67,False

I’m staying in my old room and classic move, my mom turned my old digs into a crafting space. There’s a bed.. but there is so much other stuff in here there was hardly anywhere to put my travel things - which weren’t much! 

During the first few days, we proceeded to find more of my old things that were in the basement which added more things to pile up in the room that already had to much to begin with so fit days it’s just been a sad bunch of piles, mostly on the floor.

Last night, I had a cup of coffee, much to later in the day because we were at my sons wedding and we all wanted to stay up until the end so when we got home, a little half in the bag, and a little half wired, I was in the room, surrounded by all my stuff and all my moms stuff, and a little of my daughters craft stuff and I was like, ‘I’VE HAD IT!’ and started dreaming up a solution. 

When I finally woke up this morning, after being awake most of the night, I ran the idea by my Mom and she gave me the green light. So right now, after an afternoon of cleaning and rearranging furniture - it’s so much better!! More floor space, everything is more accessible - it’s cleaner and more beautiful ✨💖😊 

I’m cozy in bed right now and I’m so grateful she said yes to the changes - and so grateful I can really enjoy the rest of my visit without having to rummage around piles on the floor to find stuff 🤗",5,1755394021.0,gratitude,0,1.0,False
