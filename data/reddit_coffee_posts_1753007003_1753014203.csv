A few weeks back, one of my close friends - total tech-head and crypto brain - showed me a method he stumbled on that turned out to be super simple and oddly effective. Instead of gatekeeping it, he actually dropped all the details on his Reddit \[u/NorthSoundArk\] - just out there for anyone to try. Honestly, I would've packaged and sold it, but he's just asking for tips if people feel like supporting.  
I figured I’d return the favor by posting about it too. Personally, I’ve been using it for about 7 days and I’m currently averaging $220–$250/day. Already crossed $1,100 with almost no effort. Hopefully someone else here gives it a go and finds it useful - even if it just covers your morning coffee and some change.  
Thanks for reading, and sorry if this wasn’t helpful to you - just wanted to share what worked for me. Wishing everyone a little luck and a big balance ✌️",0,1753014100.0,WallStreetBetsCrypto,0,0.5,False

1m4nk7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1m4nk7i/watching_horror_movies_about_women_pregnancy_has/,Watching Horror Movies about Women Pregnancy has given me light trauma.,"To clarify I haven't watched horror movies in a long time but about 7-8 years ago used to watch a youtuber called BlameTruth and he would always stream etc movies but mostly horror.


One session was just about Pregnancy movies and I shit you not I'm typing this after dreaming of this stupid movie years after the fact.




Now in that marathon there were other movies as well and don't know the name and frankly don't want to know.


One looked like it was made in the 70's and all I can remember is the main guy had an awesome blonde hairstyle and his wife after giving birth to some monster licked the blood off of its head.  Like fuck me man 😭.


Another was definitely 80's and two girlfriends drive to watch over a mansion and for some reason they split up and the other gets shot while in car and the other gets forcibly impregnated to give birth to the devil... No big deal 😂


The other is really scary and believe it's french. A Woman who recently lost her husband is alone in her house and heavily pregnant. Well guess what the husband's mother is here and wants the baby and Hijinx inssues 🤣.




The Worst though is the one that I mentioned in the beginning and is modern. It starts with a couple driving to a pretty large cabin and first day goes well until night. The man in a panic finds his Wife in the woods and it gets worse from there.


She doesn't know how to make waffles or coffee, memory is shot. She begins to deteriorate into a buglike creature and pregnant to boot.


This movie has clearly left an impression on me and maybe it's my brain wondering what I would do in this guys situation but the imagery in this movie like the focus on lighting that flies get attracted to makes me sick in hindsight. 



It makes me queasy of Pregnancy and slightly scared of Women but obviously in all these movies it's never the Woman's fault and something actively done to them but I wish I never watched these movies and don't know why I just had a vivid dream of it years later lol. Absolutely hate horror Movies and would much rather laugh.",1,1753014022.0,self,0,1.0,False
1m4nk2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiction/comments/1m4nk2o/the_fighting_tops/,The Fighting Tops,"South Atlantic, 1814 

It was from Captain Low that I learned the secret to life. The single most important rule, he’d told me, the rule that had kept his head above water these many years in His Majesty’s service: Be a good marine. 

“It’s the most natural of instincts,” he said. “Because the King created the Royal Marines, and we are the King’s subjects.” He stalked back and forth as he spoke, ducking the crossbeams overhead, then paused and swung his piercing eyes on me. “Why are you a marine, Corporal Gideon?” 

Staring as straight and blankly as I could, willing my eyes to see not just into but through the bulkhead to the expanse of sea beyond it, I considered mentioning the ruthless plantation in Georgia, and my enlistment in British service as a means of freedom from American slavery. I could mention Abigail, and what my master did to her the day before I escaped. 

But with Private Teale – another freed slave diversifying HMS Commerce’s otherwise white complement of marines – at attention beside me, and the cynical black ship’s surgeon within earshot through the wardroom door, Captain Low was in no mood for a lecture on African Diaspora. 

“Because the King made me one, sir.” I spoke strongly enough, but my words lacked conviction, and the captain glared, while the doctor’s facetious cough carried through the door.

“A marine,” said Low, unphased and carrying on with his uniform inspection, the frequent ducking of his lanky frame, while keeping his severe but not unkind expression fixed on me, “always knows what is required by asking himself: What would a good marine do, right now, in this circumstance? In all circumstance?”

Inspecting Private Teale, Low’s own instincts proved themselves with the immediate discovery of missing pipeclay on the back of his crossbelt, and he dismissed Teale without a word. Still addressing me he said, “I understand you began your service with Lord Cochrane’s outfit on Tangier. And that he personally raised you to corporal at the Chesapeake.” 

“Aye, sir.” 

“Thomas Cochrane is a particular friend of mine. He's built a reputation training good fighting marines. Could be he saw something in you…but even decorated war heroes make mistakes.” 

Six bells rang on the quarterdeck. All hands called aft; the bosun’s pipe shrilled out and above our heads came the sound of many running bare feet. But I stayed rooted in place, unable to move while Captain Low held me in an awkward silence, an awkwardness he seemed to enjoy, even encourage with his marginally perplexed eyebrows.

Finally, he said, “What say you move along to your fucking post, Corporal?” 

“Aye, sir,” I said, saluting with relief, slinging my musket and hurtling up the ladder through the hatch and onto the main deck of the Commerce. 

The sunset blazed crimson, the sea turning a curious wine-color in response, and silhouetted on the western swells the reason for our hastily assembled uniform inspection was coming across on a barge from the flag ship, the Achilles: Rear Admiral John Warren. I joined my fellow marines at the rail, Teale among them in a double-clayed crossbelt, fiddling with his gloves. 

When the Admiral came aboard we were in our places, a line of splendid scarlet coats, ramrod straight, and we presented arms with a rhythmic stamp and clash that would have rivaled the much larger contingent of marines aboard the flagship. 

Captain Low’s stoic expression cracked for the briefest of moments; it was clear he found our presentation of drill extremely satisfying, and he knew the flagship’s marine officer heard our thunder even across 500 yards of chopping sea. Colonel Woolcomb would now be extolling his ship’s marines to wipe the Commerce’s eye with their own deafening boot and musket strike upon the Admiral’s return.

But before Low could resume his stoic expression, and before we’d finished inwardly congratulating ourselves, the proud gleam in his eyes took on a smoke- tinged fury. Teale’s massive black thumb was sticking out from a tear in the white glove holding his musket.

With the sun at our backs this egregious breach of centuries-long Naval custom was hardly visible to the quarterdeck, much less so as Captain Chevers and the Navy officers were wholly taken up with ushering the Admiral into the dining cabin for toasted cheese and Madeira, or beefsteak if that didn’t suit, or perhaps his Lordship preferred the lighter dish of pan-buttered anchovies—but a tremble passed through our rank, and nearby seamen in their much looser formations nudged each other and grinned, plainly enjoying our terror. 

For every foremast jack aboard felt the shadow cast by Captain Low’s infinite incredulity; he stared aghast at the thumb as if a torn glove was some new terror the marines had never encountered in their illustrious history. 

I silently willed Teale to keep his gaze like mine, expressionless and farsighted on the line of purple horizon, unthinking and deaf to all but lawful orders, like a good marine. 

At dinner that evening, a splendid dinner in which the leftover anchovies and half-filled Madeira bottles were shared out, the consensus of the lower deck hands was that Private Teale would certainly be court-martialed and executed by the next turn of the glass. 

Ronald West, Carpenters Mate, had it from a midshipman who overheard Captain Low assert that the issue was no longer whether to execute Private Teale, but whether he was to be hung by the bowsprit or the topgallant crosstrees. At the same juncture Barrett Harding, focs’l hand, had it from the gunner that the wardroom was discussing the number of prescribed lashes, not in tens or hundreds but thousands. 

“Never seen a man bear up to a thousand on the grating,” said Harding, with a grave shake of his head. The younger ship’s boys stared in open-mouthed horror at his words. “A hundred, sure. I took 4 dozen on the Tulon blockade and none the worse. But this here flogging tomorrow? His blood will right pour out the scuppers!” 

But the Admiral’s orders left little time for punishment, real or imagined, to take place aboard the Commerce: Captain Chevers was to proceed with his ship, sailors, and marines to Cape Hatteras, making all possible haste to destroy an American shore battery and two gunboats commanding the southern inlet to the sound.  

For five hundred miles we drilled with our small boats, a sweet-sailing cutter and the smaller launch, twenty sailors in the one and twelve marines in the other, rowing round and round the Commerce as she sailed north under a steady topsail breeze. 

“Be a good marine.”

Launch and row. Hook on and raise up. Heave hearty now, look alive! 

Be a good marine. 

Dryfire musket from the topmast 100 times. Captain Low says we lose a yard of accuracy for every degree of northern latitude gained, though the surgeon denies this empirically and is happy to show you the figures. 

Be a good marine. 

Eat and sleep. Ship’s biscuit and salt beef, dried peas and two pints grog. Strike the bell and turn the glass. Pipe-clay and polish, lay out britches and waistcoat in passing rains to wash out salt stains. Black-brush top hat and boots. 

Be a good marine. 

Raise and Lower boats again. This time we pull in the *Commerce’*s wake, Major Low on the taffrail, gold watch in hand while we gasp and strain at our oars. By now both launch and the cutter had their picked crews, and those sailors left to idle on deck during our exercises developed something of a chip on their shoulder, which only nurtured our sense of elitism. It wasn’t long before we began ribbing them with cries of, “See to my oar there, Mate!” and requests to send letters to loved ones in the event of our glorious deaths.  

This disparity ended when a calm sea, the first such calm since our ship parted Admiral Warren’s squadron, allowed the others to work up the sloop’s 14 4-pounder cannons, for it was they who would take on the American gunboats while we stormed the battery. 

At quarters each evening they blazed steadily away, sometimes from both sides of the ship at once, running the light guns in and out on their tackle, firing, sponging and reloading in teams. 

Teale and I often watched from the topmast, some eighty feet above the roaring din on deck. From this rolling vantage the scene was spectacular: the ship hidden by a carpet of smoke flickering with orange stabs of cannon fire, and the plumes of white water in the distance where the round shot struck. 

All hands were therefore in a state of happy exhaustion when, to a brilliant sunrise breaking over flat seas, the Commerce raised the distant fleck of St Augustine on her larboard bow. From here it was only 3-days sail to Cape Hatteras, but our stores were dangerously low, and Captain Chevers was not of mind to take his sloop into battle without we had plenty of fresh water for all hands. 

I was unloading the boats, clearing our stored weapons, stripping the footpads and making space to ferry our new casks aboard, when a breathless midshipman came running down the gangway. “Captain Chevers’ compliments to the Corporal, and would it please you to come to his cabin this very moment?” 

In three minutes’ time I was in my best scarlet coat, tight gators and black neckstock, sidearm and buttons gleaming, at the door of the Captain’s Cabin. His steward appeared to show me inside, grunting approval at the perfect military splendor of my uniform.

“And don’t address the Captain without he speaks to you first,” he said, a fully dispensable statement. 

The door opened, and for a moment I was blinded by the evening glare in the cabin’s magnificent stern windows. 

The captain was in conference with his officers and Captain Low, whose red jacket stood out among the others’ gold-laced blue. There was also a gentleman I didn’t know, a visitor from the town with a prodigious grey beard. Despite his age and missing left eye he was powerfully built and well-dressed, with the queen’s Order of Bath shining on his coat. 

Musing navigational charts, their discussion carried on for some moments while I stood at strict attention, a deaf and mute sentry to whom eavesdropping constituted breach of duty.

It appeared the old gentleman had news of a Dutch privateer, a heavy frigate out of Valparaiso, laden with gold to persuade native Creek warriors to the American side. The gentleman intended to ambush this shipment on its subsequent journey overland, where it would be most vulnerable, and redirect the gold to our Seminole allies. He knew one of our marines had escaped a plantation in Indian country, and he would be most grateful for a scout who knew the territory. 

At the word scout all eyes turned on me, and he said, “Is this your man?” Stepping around the desk he offered me a calloused hand. “Stand easy, Corporal.” 

Major Low offered a quick glance, a permissive tilt of the head none but I could have noticed. 

I saluted and removed my hat, taking the old man’s hand and returning its full pressure, no small feat. 

“Sir Edward Nicolls,” he said. “At your service.” 

I recognized the name at once. Back on Tangier Island, my drill instructors spoke of Major-General Nicolls in reverent tones, that most famous of royal marine officers whose long and bloodied career had been elevated to legend throughout the fleet. 

Even the ship’s surgeon, an outspoken critic of the British military as exploiters of destitute, able-bodied youths fleeing slavery, grudgingly estimated that Sir Nicolls’ political efforts as an abolitionist led to thousands of former slaves being granted asylum on British soil. Protected by the laws of His Majesty, they could no longer be arrested and returned as rightful property.  

Indeed, it was this horrifying possibility that was to blame for my current summons. As a marine I’d been frequently shuffled from one ship’s company to another, or detached with the army for inshore work, but never had I been consulted on the order, much less given the option to refuse. 

“It seems there’s some additional risk,” said Captain Chevers, “Beyond the military risk, that is, for you personally . . . a known fugitive in Georgia. If captured it’s likely you’d not be viewed as a prisoner of war, entitled to certain rights and so forth, but as a freedom-seeker and vagabond. A wanted criminal.”  

“Captain Low here insisted you’d be delighted to volunteer,” said Sir Nicolls with a wry look, “But I must hear it from you.” 

I hadn’t thought of the miserable old plantation for weeks, maybe longer. Being a good marine had taken my full measure of attention. But now in a flash my mind raced back along childhood paths, through tangled processions of forest, plantation, and marsh, seemingly endless until they plunged into the wide Oconee River, and beyond that, the truly wild country. 

Then came the predictable memories of Abigail, the house slave born to the plantation the same year as I, cicadas howling as we explored every creek and game trail, and how later as lovers absconded to many a pre-discovered hideout familiar to us alone. 

It occurred to me they were waiting on my answer. Sir Nicolls had filled the interim of my reverie with remarks that there was no pressing danger of such capture, particularly as he had a regiment of highlanders on station, all right forward hands with a bayonet, and that I stood to receive 25 pounds sterling for services rendered. But soon he could stall no longer.

“Well then, what do you say, Corporal?”

I said: “If you please, sir . . . the corporal would be most grateful.” 

Sir Nicolls beard broke with a broad smile, and even Captain Low’s expression showed something not unlike approval.

“Spoken like a good marine!” Said Sir Nicolls.

“There you have it,” said Chevers. “Mr. Low, please note Corporal Gideon to detach and join the highland company at Spithead. And gentlemen, let us remind ourselves that the Admiral first gets his shore battery and gunboats. Now, where in God’s name is Dangerfield with our coffee?” ",1,1753014012.0,fiction,0,1.0,False

I went to QFX for a movie. As the show had already started, I decided to take the lift. And there she was; waiting for the lift. It was just the two of us, and the lift took us to the third floor. She was on her phone the whole time.

I went to the counter, and she was right behind me. I asked for a ticket, and the ticketer selected two seats, thinking we were together. Asked me the price for two tickets. I felt awkward, so I said, ""Just one,"" and got my ticket. The moment was embarrassing for her too! I looked at her but couldn't read her face. But I'm sure she felt the same.

As the movie had already started, I went inside thinking what if I had bought the tickets for two of us. She was still at the counter. I rushed towards my seat. A few minutes later, she entered and, surprisingly, sat beside me. In that moment, I felt like it's the perfect time to start conversation. Why would she choose the seat next to me while there were other empty seats? However, she was on her phone most of the time. 

Throughout the movie, I kept thinking, What if I had paid for both tickets? Maybe that way I could have started a conversation-maybe even become friends.

During the interval, I went out and came back with coffee and popcorn. I thought about talking to her, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. As the movie started after the interval, she left.

Yet my bag still had its white label on it and his did not. The headphones were in this bag. Also in the bag was a charger I took from training and he did not. But missing from the headphones was the blue memory stick and also the headphones were open when I had closed them.  The memory stick was in his computer which made our manager say they must be his…. Yet I think he took it from my bag to make it look like it was his.

The worst thing is that my notebook that I had from two weeks of our intensive training (all our notes) was missing. If we had accidentally took the wrong bag then surely my notebook and the other pare of headphones would be in his bag and he can give to me??? No the headphones not there and the notebook gone…..

Then the first day my manger yelled at me for loosing my headphones while he took all the calls and got many leads and now has more sales than me….

And now he goes and gets coffee for the two supervisors in our small office and himself but never does get me one. I don’t want but it seems passive aggressive and rude and I’m sure he stole my notebook and headphones on purpose.

[The benefits of karkadeh](https://arabianteahouse.com/benefits-of-karkadeh/): refreshing hibiscus tea in Arabian Tea House go far beyond flavor. At Arabian Tea House, karkadeh isn’t just a drink—it’s a cultural expression, a health tonic, and a moment of calm served in a teacup. With its deep red hue and tangy taste, karkadeh (hibiscus tea) is one of the most cherished traditional beverages across the Arab world, and its popularity continues to grow among health-conscious visitors and locals alike.

Let’s explore why karkadeh is such an important part of the experience at Arabian Tea House—and how it supports the body and mind naturally.

# 1. Helps Lower Blood Pressure Naturally

One of the most studied health benefits of karkadeh is its role in managing blood pressure. Hibiscus flowers are rich in compounds that help relax blood vessels and reduce hypertension. At Arabian Tea House, our karkadeh is brewed using authentic dried hibiscus petals, served either warm or chilled, making it a soothing and effective beverage for those seeking natural support for their cardiovascular health.

For guests seeking a delicious way to unwind after a meal, karkadeh offers both flavor and function.

# 2. Full of Antioxidants

Karkadeh is naturally high in antioxidants, especially anthocyanins, which give it its signature red color. These antioxidants help fight free radicals in the body, which may contribute to cell protection and anti-aging effects. Drinking karkadeh regularly can support your immune system, skin health, and overall vitality.

At Arabian Tea House, we take pride in using high-quality hibiscus sourced with care, ensuring every cup delivers not only a pleasant tartness but also real wellness benefits.

# 3. Naturally Caffeine-Free and Hydrating

Unlike black tea or coffee, karkadeh is caffeine-free, which makes it ideal for any time of day. Whether you're having breakfast in our Al Fahidi branch or enjoying a calm evening at the Archaeological Site location, karkadeh offers hydration and refreshment without the jittery effects of caffeine.

Our staff will happily serve karkadeh sweetened or unsweetened—depending on your taste—allowing you to enjoy it guilt-free.

# 4. Promotes Digestive Comfort

Traditional Arabic households often serve karkadeh after meals for a good reason—it helps with digestion. The gentle acidity of hibiscus stimulates digestive enzymes and may help reduce bloating. Whether you're dining on our Emirati breakfast trays or trying traditional mains, karkadeh is the perfect finish to your meal.

Its refreshing nature also makes it ideal for hot weather, helping your body feel lighter and more balanced.

# 5. Soothes the Body and Lifts the Spirit

Hibiscus tea is known for its calming properties. It may help lower stress levels and support emotional balance, especially when enjoyed in a peaceful setting. At Arabian Tea House, each cup of karkadeh is part of a bigger picture—gentle conversations, soft ambient music, and timeless Emirati hospitality.

Guests often describe their karkadeh experience as “a moment of stillness”—a ritual that brings calm in the midst of a busy day.

# Tradition Served with Wellness

The benefits of karkadeh: refreshing hibiscus tea in Arabian Tea House are best understood when you experience them firsthand. More than just a drink, karkadeh at Arabian Tea House reflects our dedication to health, heritage, and hospitality. From the preparation to the presentation, every detail honors Emirati traditions passed down through generations.

Whether you're visiting us in Al Fahidi, Sharjah, Mercato Mall, or Jumeirah Beach, karkadeh awaits you—fragrant, vibrant, and full of heart.",1,1753013812.0,u_khaled12pop,0,1.0,False
1m4nfpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CursedRoblox/comments/1m4nfpw/primebiome_reviews_and_complaints_2025_we_tried/,PrimeBiome Reviews and Complaints 2025 - We Tried It 365 My Honest Review,"If you're sitting there wondering whether PrimeBiome is just another overhyped supplement, let me be the one to tell you—this is THE real deal. I don’t normally write reviews, especially not long ones, but I feel morally obligated to share my experience because this product has truly changed my life.

My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

﻿ **✅ GET 86% OFF TODAY - Visit Th e ORIGINAL PrimeBiome Official Website And Enjoy FREE Shipping!**

Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.

I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”

The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.

By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.

Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.

Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:

✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.

✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.

✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!

✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.

✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.

Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:

Bloating or gas

Irregular bowel movements

Leaky gut or food intolerances

Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings

Skin issues like acne or rashes

Weakened immunity

Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...

Then this product is 100% for you.

Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.

Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.

I don’t say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn’t just help me poop better—it gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

❄️🦾Public reviews :

Prime Biome has received a mix of reviews from users worldwide. Many customers have reported positive experiences, particularly regarding skin improvements and digestive health.

For instance, Sarah from New York shared, “I would have never, ever dreamed that my skin could look so amazing. If you had told me two months ago that my dark spots and fine wrinkles would disappear with such a simple solution, I would have laughed in your face. I am so happy I gave this a try!”

Similarly, Alexa from Wyoming mentioned, “I used to need so much Botox to keep the wrinkles away that my face was permanently frozen. And it did nothing for the saggy skin on my chin and my turkey neck. A few weeks into using this PrimeBiome supplement and I am speechless! I wake up, I look in the mirror and I love what I see. No more expensive procedures and thousands of needles in my face for me. It’s simply unbelievable!”

I don’t normally write reviews, especially not long ones, but I feel morally obligated to share my experience because this product has truly changed my life.

My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

﻿ **✅ GET 86% OFF TODAY - Visit Th e ORIGINAL PrimeBiome Official Website And Enjoy FREE Shipping!**

Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.

I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”

The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.

By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.

Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.

Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:

1m4nere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1m4nere/telling_my_friends_the_truth/,Telling my friends the truth,"I F38 have been married for the last 9 year to my husband M36. The problem is I never told my friends I got married, I am from an middle eastern background and arranged marriages are common. I was against it but reluctantly went ahead with it. My first couple of years I hated him unfairly, I refused to tell anyone outside the family that I am married and that included my friends.

Over time I got to know my husband and he is a good person, he also was pressured into marriage. He never hurt me, always gave me as much space as I needed. He was willing to do chores and work around the house if I asked. He also pays the bills and provides for me. I have since apologised to him for my past behaviour and he forgave me far more easily than I think he should have.

I met my friends through work after I got married within the time I refuse to admit I was married and had told them I was single. We are very close and have been since, we regularly meet up for coffee or dinner dates, at one point they did see my husband and they asked about him, I stupidly blurted out that he was just a cousin. My mother doesn't know and would push him to pick me up if we went out as it was his duty as a husband to make sure I was safe being picked up. I usually didnt speak to him and he didnt speak to them but they would just assume he was a member of my family.

The issue is I kept up the lie that I wasn't married to my friends for those past 9 years, I was too ashamed to admit I lied and it was easier to continue with it. But now I'm pregnant, I'm about to have my first baby. This is something I know I can't hide but I am too scared to tell them because they might leave and not be my friends anymore. I probably deserve it if they did. I am meeting them soon, how can I explain the truth without hurting them?",1,1753013536.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1m4ndyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m4ndyz/nothing_bad_happens_in_serendipity_part_one/,Nothing Bad Happens In Serendipity {PART ONE},"This story was originally written for r/nosleep but they infamously suck so I decided to post here instead. Slight content warning, without spoiling too much, if you are sensitive to topics such as transphobia, suicide or abortion. 

-

Drowning would have been better than ending up here.

Serendipity is a town where nothing ever happens. The sun is setting behind a monolithic cattle farm, perched upon the only hill for miles. Rows of suburbia branch out onto dollhouse streets. Mothers dote over their children and border collies in front yards, encased by white picket fences, as their husbands filter in from their nine to fives. Everyone waves or nods at each other on the street, but nobody looks too closely. They can’t bear the sight. They are much too ashamed. I can’t help but wonder how I ended up here. 

A few months before I learned of Serendipity, I decided to take my own life. 

For my last meal, I decided on a local diner. Not exactly glamorous, but at least I’d die with something familiar in my stomach. I don’t know how the stranger sitting across from me didn’t keel over from mortification. My smell must’ve been bad enough to reach the kitchen. I stuffed my face like a stray dog on death row. 

“How long’s it been since you ate?” he asked. He dressed much too clean for this part of the city. Nicely dressed, neatly trimmed hair, clean shaven. Handsome, too, in a nineteenth century kind of way.

I shrugged. Nutrition hadn’t been my main focus in the months of my homelessness. My mouth was too full to form words either way. 

“I’m Eli, by the way,” he responded to my silence. Four plates of pancakes and waffles doused in syrup sat in front of me, with one mug of coffee sitting in front of him. With this abundance of food before me, it was almost getting easier to forget that I was going to kill myself thirty minutes ago. 

“Cool,” I said through a full mouth. “I’m not gonna sleep with you, you know.” 

His eyes widened. “No, I’m not- I don’t expect you to. I don’t want that.”

“Good,” I nodded. My stomach was about ready to burst. “What do you want from me, then?” 

“Nothing. Did you expect me to just stand there and watch?” he said. 

The bridge I stood upon thirty minutes prior buzzed with moving cars. My toes graced the edge of it. In all of the times I’d contemplated ending things, I always expected it to be harder. Wind shoved my back forward almost like it was begging me to take flight. How long would the drop be- five, ten seconds? Then that would be it. That’s all it would take. A short lived freefall in exchange for freeing myself of everything.
Then Eli’s voice called up from below. It took a while for him to talk me down. I’m still not sure why I listened. 

“You didn’t have anything better to do?” I asked. 

“I guess not,” he shrugged. His fingers rapped against the table as he thought of something else to say. “How’d you end up on the street?” 

“I killed a man.”

“I’m guessing he deserved it,” he said, smiling. 

“Not really. Just felt like it.” 

His smile had infected me by the time the waiter came by. “How are you gentlemen getting on?” he asked, his face falling when he got a better look at me. “Oh, sorry.”

Silence fell over the table as the waiter stumbled over his words. “Don’t worry about it,” Eli said with an awkward smile. The waiter took my demolished plates and went to go refill our water. 

Eli cleared his throat, waiting until the waiter’s footsteps receded into the drone of the diner. “Can I ask about that? Not that it's any of my business.”

There was no need to ask what he was referring to. Still, I wanted to make him spell it out. “About?” 

“Are you, uh, transgender? I had a friend who was back in college. But she was, y’know, the other way. Born male.” 

“Does it matter?”

“No. Not at all. Just curious about you,” he said, sipping his coffee. “It doesn’t matter to me if you are or not.” 

Stupidly, something about that made me feel giddy. Nobody had ever wanted to know more about me. I stared at the table as I spoke. “I think I’ve always been a man. I don’t know. It’s just that no one else has ever been able to see me that way.” It came out stupider than I would’ve liked. 

Still, he nodded. “I understand. That must be hard for you.” 

My eyes didn’t move. He would never know. It was the whole reason I was in this mess, wasn’t it? The whole reason my life was going to end today. Eli finished his coffee and we left the diner, which was growing much too loud and crowded as the day began to wane. 

“Where are you gonna go?” Eli asked as we stood in front of his Mustang, which miraculously hadn’t been stripped to pieces. 

“Find the nearest bridge and crawl under it, probably.” I shrugged.

“There aren’t any shelters you can stay at?” he asked. 

I almost smiled. I’d be laughed out of a woman’s shelter. Even if they’d take me, I’d take sleeping on the street over how out of place I’d feel there. There were no spaces left either way. “Not really.” 

Maybe the bridge wouldn’t be the best place to end things. Maybe I could find a nice body of water, nestled in some hidden part of the city, and let myself sink. “Come back to my motel,” Eli blurted out, disrupting my train of thought. “Not for anything- Just for tonight, I mean. I can sleep in my car.”

“I’m not kicking you out of your motel.”

“No, really, I don’t mind. Spent fifty thousand on this hunk of shit, anyway. Might as well get a good night’s sleep out of it,” he said, gesturing back to his car. 

What did I have to lose? If I needed to, I could leave the motel at midnight and end things then. I could spend the last few hours of my life in some sort of comfort. I nodded wordlessly. 

“You got a name? You know, in case you try to kill me in my sleep and I need to give the cops a description,” he asked. 

“Well, now you’ve ruined it,” I said. Then it struck me that I didn’t really have an answer. Between all that had happened these past few weeks, I hadn’t really had a chance to think about it. “Evan,” I said uncertainly. It was unfamiliar on my tongue. 

He nodded. It was a good enough answer for him. Silently, I got in Eli’s passenger seat once more, and we wound through the winding streets of a dilapidating city. 

Eli’s motel was a twenty minute drive out of the city. It wasn’t half as nice as his car was, but that didn’t matter. It was a bed and four walls. That was more than I’d had for the past few weeks. From the porch, the outline of the city sat painted against the skyline, the sun making it nothing more than a shadow. It lay before us as Eli and I sat outside, talking about nothing and everything. His questions were endless and I didn’t have many answers to give. When he asked how old I was, I told him it was my birthday. He nodded, then excused himself. 

His Mustang revved off into the city. 
I preoccupied myself with a shower and attempted to rid myself of dirt and muck. Night had fallen by the time he returned. Sleep had almost taken me, only disrupted by the sound of him rustling around in the kitchen. When he realised I was awake, he made me close my eyes. 

I opened them to find him holding a store bought cupcake, with a haphazardly placed candle sticking out. Sparks flew off of it and threatened to burn down the entire motel room. I closed my eyes and blew. 

“What’d you wish for?” he asked, sitting across from me on the bed and splitting the cupcake in half. 

“For you to go to bed so I can rob you blind and leave,” I said. He laughed, not pressing it any further. I was glad I’d never have to tell him. 

To wake up in a body that belonged to me, or to not wake up at all. 

Hours flew by unnoticed. Our conversations weren’t about anything of interest. Shows and movies played quietly in the background, most of which he had never even heard of. When I asked how he had ended up in one of the worst cities in the country living out of a motel, he couldn’t get the words out. He only said that he had ended up here for more or less the same reason I had. He didn’t seem like he was referring to the half-assed excuse I had given him in the diner, either. I didn’t press it further. 

The sun was threatening to rise by the time he cleared his throat. “Well, I better leave you to it. Have a good rest.”

My body and my mouth moved without input from my brain. I don’t know what drove me to do something so desperate. Maybe I couldn’t stand to handle another night alone. My hand tugged at his sleeve. “Stay. Please.”  

He stiffened, taken aback, and eventually nodded. Both of us crawled under the sheets, a few inches of space between us, and just looked at each other for a while. There was something in his eyes that I couldn’t quite place. I couldn’t help but wonder what on earth he wanted with somebody like me. 

I didn’t take my life that night, nor did I take it in the weeks that followed. But with each day that passes now, I can’t help but think that I should have. I could’ve saved myself from so much of it. Everything would have been better off. 

Days turned to weeks. Weeks turned to months. I never intended on staying. Every time I would bring up the vague notion of my leaving, he would insist that it really didn’t bother him. He had nothing better to spend his money on, anyway. He even made an attempt at teaching me how to drive, which was as short-lived as it was terrifying. Life settled into a picturesque scene of TV dinners and bad coffee in Eli’s cramped motel room. 

I learned more than I should have about Eli in the months that followed. He never drank or swore. He grew up in a land-locked state without an internet connection, attributing that to his lack of interest in media. Some nights, I woke to the sound of him out on the porch talking to his parents. He never spoke a single word about them. Things came together. More and more, I began to understand that he never spoke about them for the same reason I never spoke about mine. They had hurt him in some way that he wasn’t willing to forgive. 

It wasn’t much of a surprise when Eli and I started sleeping together, and even less of one when I felt myself beginning to fall in love. He was my anchor. There had never been a time in my life where I had felt anything for anyone. It was difficult to, when I was a pit of self loathing for what I was. A monster. An abnormality wearing the wrong skin. 

Eli never saw me that way. He never saw the shell I was trapped in, only who I was. Over time, it became a little easier for me to see myself that way, too. 

Three months in, the world collapsed again. The jaws of hell opened up and beckoned me down. All because of two pink lines on a stick of plastic. 

It took a while for me to get the words out. Eli sat across from me on the couch, assuring me that whatever it was, we would figure it out. Everything I had worked towards these past few months had amounted to nothing. A betrayal of my own biology festered inside me. 

“Pregnant.” It was the only word I was able to sputter out. This was it. He wouldn’t be able to see me as anything else now. 

Eli’s hands tensed in mine. He pulled back, running them through his hair, his eyes wide. “Shit,” he whispered. He stood and began pacing the hotel room. 

“Don’t worry, I’m pretty sure it’s yours,” I said sniffling, desperate for any sense of levity. He didn’t smile. I’m not even sure he heard me. 

“We were so careful,” he said to no one in particular. I nodded. On paper, we had done everything right. Getting rid of this little infestation that grew in my stomach was something I had thought about to no end. Eli had been sleeping when I found out. After that, I sat on his bathroom floor naked with a coat hanger and a lighter. I didn’t make it too far before the realization struck that I couldn’t bring myself to do it. 

There was the option of driving to the nearest Planned Parenthood, too. But that raised the small issue that abortion had been made a crime in this and every surrounding state. 

“I can’t have a child, Eli,” I said softly. It wasn’t just that. Having to endure watching my body morph into the opposite of what it was meant to be for the next nine months, having my body irreparably damaged and bearing the reminder of my incorrect biology for the rest of my life- I wouldn’t survive that. I was barely surviving now. 

When I opened my eyes, Eli was sitting across from me. His hands found mine again. “I know, sweetheart. I know.”

“What the fuck do we do?” I asked. In every situation I had found myself in, there had always been an answer. Even if that answer was bleeding out slowly with a broken neck on the interstate. There was no answer this time, no saviour in a black Mustang. Eli held me against his chest when I began to wrack with sobs. Those two lines were a death sentence. 

Eli’s hands ran through my short hair when he spoke. “I never told you what my dad used to do for a living. He was a doctor.” I wasn’t exactly sure where he was going, but I didn’t interrupt. “He was good at it, too. Made a lot of money. His business went under last year when the law changed. He used to terminate pregnancies.” 

I looked up at Eli as he wiped my tears away with his thumb. “Would he…?”

Eli nodded. “He would, for me. But my parents, they’re…”

“I’m not gonna judge you ‘cause of your parents, you know. Mine weren’t shining examples either.”

“How’d I luck out with you?” Eli smiled, his face against the top of my head. “It’s not a short drive there, though. Have you ever heard of a town called Serendipity?”

That’s how I found myself loading what few possessions I had into the back of Eli’s car. After spending a good chunk of the morning on the phone to his father, we were off. The horizon shifted slowly from high-rise buildings into a barren country wasteland. When I asked Eli if he wanted me to put in directions, he explained that Serendipity wouldn’t show up on any map. 

Besides, he already knew the way.  

-

NOTHING BAD EVER HAPPENS IN SERENDIPITY! POPULATION - 306

Scrawled on a sign above a painting of a farmer tending to a flock of cows, this was what greeted us after a four day drive filled with bouts of morning sickness and gas station food. “Wow. It’s certainly…”

“Creepy?” Eli finished. 

“Charming was the word I was looking for,” I said. He smiled, but it didn’t reach his eyes. His hands were white around the steering wheel, and he had spent the better part of today’s drive eating the skin of his lip. I rested my hand on his thigh. “We won’t stay long. We’ll just… do what we need to do, then leave.”

Eli nodded. “I was thinking California.”

“California?”

“Yeah. After this, we’ll head to California. I have enough put aside for a house. They’re more… free there, you know. It’d be easy for you to get help. Hormones and stuff, you know?”

I found myself smiling. Envisioning a future that, a few months ago, I was certain I would not live to see. California was a far cry from the midwestern suburbia we found ourselves in. A general store, a doctor’s office, a church and a butcher were among the town’s only commercial buildings. Aside from those and the large factory overlooking the town, rows upon rows of cookie cutter homes sat. Women and children lined the sidewalk and their front yards, dressed in an array of similarly fashioned dresses, each a different pastel colour. 

Their hair was worn down and looked like it hadn’t been cut for years. Younger girls wore smaller variants of their mothers clothes, while the younger boys wore the clothes of much older men. The town itself was nestled in an endless plain. It was like driving through a postcard. 

“Where are all the guys?” I asked as we rounded a corner. 

“Huh? Oh, what’s the time? Probably at work. Most of them work up at the cattle farm. Not many other ways to make a living here,” he explained through gritted teeth. 
The car came to a stop. The house facing us was larger than the others. It had the same white wood surrounding it as all the others, fencing in a perfectly kept lawn with peonies and roses. Eli turned the car off and ran his hands through his short hair, reclining in his seat. 

“Do you need a minute?” I asked, acting like my stomach wasn’t a bundle of nerves itself. 
He shook his head. “Ev, look. My parents are… old-fashioned. They’re probably gonna say some weird shit.”

“As if I haven’t already heard it all,” I said, rubbing his back. “Don’t worry about me. I can handle it.” 

He nodded. Soon enough, we were standing on his parents porch as a melodic doorbell rang out. Footsteps rustled inside. The front door swung open, revealing a short woman with greying hair and weathered skin. The dress she wore was much like the others we had passed, only hers was pure white. Her eyes lit up with recognition when they landed on Eli. She enveloped him in her arms, much tighter than he was comfortable with. It was only when she stepped back that she realised he wasn’t alone. 

“Oh, Elijah’s told us so much about you! Come in, come in!” his mother beckoned, her voice much deeper than I expected. 

Inside was modestly furnished with white walls and wooden floors, like we had just walked into a Sears catalogue. A painted sign proclaiming ‘Love Is All’ hung over the staircase. The front room branched off into three sections- the staircase ahead, the living room to the left and the dining room to the right. As the front door swung shut, a large figure stood from the dining table and approached. It was like glimpsing into the future. He stood at Eli’s exact height and wore his face, aged approximately thirty years. 

Eli’s father stepped closer, clamping down a firm hand on his shoulder. For a minute, the room filled with stale silence. Then both men started laughing, as Eli’s father pulled him into a hug. His mother cleared her throat and gestured towards me. 

“Well?” she asked politely. 

“Oh, right,” Eli said awkwardly, clearing his throat. He gestured towards his parents. “Ev, this is Sam, my father. And this lovely lady here is Miriam. Dad, Miriam, this is-“

“Eveline, right?” Miriam smiled. My heart stopped. Floodgates snapped open and years of neglected memories came cascading in. A name I hadn’t heard in half a year echoed in my ears. “Eli told us over the phone, but I wasn’t sure I heard him right.”

Everyone’s eyes were burning into me except Eli’s. My smile was shaky at best. I was an animal trapped. When it became clear Eli wasn’t going to say anything, I nodded. “Yep, that’s right.”

“I tell you, you women and your haircuts these days. Hell, back in my day-“

“Oh, Sam, enough,” Miriam said, softly batting him on the arm and shooting me a polite smile. I did my best to reciprocate. Polite conversation continued, but it was getting increasingly hard to hear through the thrum of my eardrums. Something unholy stirred in my stomach. 

“Sorry,” I interrupted loudly, my voice betraying me. “Is there a bathroom I can use?”

Within a minute, I was hunched over a toilet bowl, expelling what remained of breakfast. Just as I was wiping my mouth, a knock came. 

“Ev, it’s me. Can you open the door?” 

“I’m busy,” I called back. 

“Ev, please.”

Against my better judgement, I flushed and unlocked the door. It swung closed behind Eli as he stepped in, wrapping me in his arms. I pushed him away, stumbling backwards. 
“How did they know?” I whispered, unable to meet his eye. 

“What? Ev, what are you talking about?”

“My birth name. How did they know?”

Eli pressed his fingers to his temple, breathing deep. “Shit. I’m really sorry, Ev. They don’t. I mean- I didn’t even know before now. I said Evan on the phone. They must’ve just heard misheard, or assumed-“

“It’s fine,” I said, trying to steady myself. He didn’t know. How could he have?

Eli fell quiet. Then he stepped forward, running a hand through my hair. I didn’t have the strength to push him away this time. “We can leave if you want to. We can find another way.”

My head shook. “Just one week, right? I spent the first seventeen years of my life pretending I was someone else. I can handle one more week.” I wasn’t sure who I was trying to convince- Eli or myself. 

“Are you sure? We really don’t have to stay.”
Everything in me ached for escape. Yearned for that cramped motel room where the world couldn’t find me. But the churning in my stomach told me otherwise. I needed this thing out before it was too late. 

I took his face in my hands, having to get on my tiptoes to kiss him gently. “I’m sure, Eli.” His hand found mine. For a minute, I was safe. I didn’t know what I’d signed up for. 

After an awkward dinner that left my face aching from polite smiling, Eli was laying next to me in bed. We’d stolen a few hours of peace. 

“No phone service,” I noted, the useless hunk of metal in my hand. 

“Well, yeah. Have you looked around lately?” Eli smiled. 

I left my phone on the bedside table, rolling over to face him. “You never told me you grew up Amish.” 

“What? We’re not. We have, like… water. And electricity. You know, solar power.”

“Amish people have those things too, you know. And your mom’s name is literally Miriam.” 

“Miriam is a perfectly normal name, thank you,” he mocked. After seeing my amusement, he sighed. “Maybe a little old fashioned, yeah.” 

“Explains a lot about you,” I said. 

His eyes were searching for something in mine. “Are you scared?” he asked softly. 
I hadn’t been hiding it well enough. 

“About your father I just met ripping me open? No, not at all. Why?”

His fingers traced the outline of my jaw. “It’ll be okay. You won’t even feel it. Then we can go back to normal. I’ll talk to him tomorrow, ask what the plan is.” 

I nodded, leaning into his touch. His lips pressed against my forehead. In the midst of all of this, I had found a haven. 

Sleep found Eli long before it found me. As I lay there, watching the open window and listening to him breathe, the stars were ten times brighter than usual. Serendipity was a completely different planet, one frozen in time.

Then the screaming began. 

Eli didn’t even stir. Tortured bellows descended down the hill in an avalanche, not giving each other enough time to finish before the next one began, like the pits of hell themselves were opening up and letting the world listen in. Not so much as a street light turned on. 

The cow factory. It was coming from there. As I lay there, listening to the syncopated yowls, I realised a tone that deep and deranged couldn’t be coming from anything other than an animal. 

As I listened to the cows scream, lost to the endless stretch of darkness in the valley, it became nothing more than a background drone. They must’ve stopped at some point in the night. It was silent by the time I woke. 

Eli’s side of the bed was cold. Sunlight broke through the open window. Polite chatter and lawnmowers revving filtered in from the street. My clothes weren’t where I left them. They weren’t anywhere. An ironed linen dress hung from the wardrobe, the same cut and shape of all the others in town- only this one was baby blue. I shuddered, looking down at my ripped sleep shirt and boxers. What was more humiliating? Facing the judgement of Eli’s family in this, or that piece of fabric hanging on the wardrobe? 

Grudgingly, I settled on the dress. I hadn’t worn anything like this since my parents had forced me into one. 

Despite my best efforts at avoiding it, I caught myself in the mirror. The floor could’ve opened up and swallowed me whole and it would’ve been preferable. Anything to rid myself of this flesh that seemed more hellbent each day on morphing into a body that did not belong to me. Every single part of my body flooded me with contempt, every curve or rounded edge that betrayed the way I was supposed to be stuck out like a tall blade of grass. My stomach stuck out further than usual, a bulbous signal to the nightmare occurring inside me. I was wearing someone else’s skin. Every part of me wanted to crawl back under the covers and never emerge. 
But I’d have to face his parents sooner or later. They were doing me a favour, weren’t they? This was just the price I had to pay for it. It’s not like I hadn’t spent seventeen years doing the exact same thing. Wearing someone else’s face. It was second nature. 

The smell of sausages, biscuits and coffee wafted in the air as I made my way downstairs, slouching as much as I could. Miriam doted over the oven, smiling as soon as she saw me. 

“Oh, isn’t that dress just beautiful? I thought you might be my size. I didn’t want you to feel out of place here,” she said as I took a seat at the table. 

“It’s beautiful. Thank you,” I echoed blankly, making my best attempt at concealing myself behind the table. “Do you know where my other clothes went?”

For a moment, I wasn’t sure she heard me. “Oh, yes. I put them in the wash. Mistook them for Eli’s at first. So boyish.”

All I did was nod. Miriam left the stovetop unattended as she hovered over the sink, scrubbing a glass with a dish towel. Her eyes were dead set on something out the window. The rest of the house was eerily quiet. “Do you know where Eli went?” I asked. 

“Oh, Elijah went to work with his father this morning. Sam needed an extra pair of hands up at the factory,” she said. The pan sizzled. Her scrubbing intensified, making the glass squeak. Then her eyes lit up. “Ah! I need to go and grab some things from Martys. I was thinking you and I could have a girl’s trip uptown.” 

“That sounds great, Miriam,” I smiled. She did too, though it didn’t reach her eyes. She wasn’t really looking at anything. The pristine glass in her hand began to shake from the pressure. Oil bubbled and spat out of the pan. “Um, Miriam?” I asked. The dish rag sped up as her jaw slackened, her mouth falling slightly open. Flames on the stovetop began to eat the oil, growing in size. 

I stood, slamming the chair into the table. Miriam gasped. A loud crash echoed as the glass shattered in the sink. She turned and let out a string of curses as she turned off the gas, moving the pan to a different burner as she used the dish rag to snuff the flame. Her chest heaved as she stood over the extinguished fire. I kept still, unsure of what to do or say. 

Then she turned, her smile wide as ever. “Looks like I burnt breakfast again. Silly me. We can grab some food in town. Shall we go?” 

Nobody owns a car in Serendipity. The driveways lay empty, and are instead strewn with barbecues or toddler pools. Everyone in town knows everyone. Despite the fact we’d hardly been out of the house for several minutes, Miriam had stopped to make polite conversation with younger women about their husbands or their children twice. Personal space seemed to be a foreign concept as well. One of the women put her hands on my stomach and congratulated me, professing what a blessing it was. I gave her my thanks, her touch leaving me aching to crawl out of my skin. Something about her seemed oddly familiar, but I couldn’t quite place it. I must’ve been staring too much, because the second her eyes locked with mine, her smile dropped. Her goodbyes were hurried. 

Despite the fact the store was only a ten minute walk, Miriam seemed determined to make as many detours as possible. She wanted me to familiarise myself with the town. I didn’t have the heart to tell her that it wasn’t likely I’d ever set foot in Serendipity again. Our journey took us through the park in the centre of town. A bustling playground with a large wooden ship sat in the middle of it all. Children played pretend with wooden sculptures of cows and their calves. A small lake sat on the outskirts.

As we walked under the ceiling of wide oak trees above, small voices began to ring out. Ahead of us, a group of young girls joined hands and ran in a circle. Miriam stopped dead in her tracks, delighted at the tune the girls sang. It wasn’t any childhood lullaby I had heard before. The lyrics were a morbid tale about a lady dressed in white. 

All of them wore the same red dresses, aside from one that looked a few years older than the others- at least fourteen. Hers was yellow. It took a while for me to realise that she had stopped moving in sync with the other girls. She stood dead still, her eyes piercing mine. It was like she saw right through my shell and peered into my core. Within a single moment, she had unravelled my fragile disguise. Then she started towards me. 

Dandelions were tied in a crown around her skull, framing her blank expression. The other girls continued in a circle like ants as she approached, coming to a dead stop in front of me. She reached up into her hair, which fell down to her waist, and pulled a pair of dandelions free. She extended them towards me. 

I took them, making my best attempt at a smile. “They’re beautiful. Thank you.”
The girl’s blank expression finally broke as a small, shy smile appeared. “One day, I’m going to have a pretty blue dress like you.” 

“I’m sure if you ask your parents they’ll buy you one,” I said, struggling for anything to say. 

She shook her head. “Not yet.” 

Just as I was about to ask her why, I realised the emptiness next to me. Miriam was gone. I forgot all about the girl as I started calling Miriam’s name, frantically searching every corner of the park. Heads were beginning to turn. That’s when I saw white fabric trailing in the wind, quickly heading towards the lake. 
My feet worked before my head did. I barrelled towards the lake, screaming Miriam’s name. My voice didn’t seem to reach her no matter how loud it got. By the time I got there, Miriam was knee deep in the lake, seeming determined to get even deeper. The skirt of her dress was soaked, floating away from her like a sprouting water lily. Moss and lily pads parted before her as she progressed, revealing crystal clear water underneath. The shadow of the factory loomed over the lake, overlooking everything from its giant perch in the sky. 

I hitched up my dress and rushed into the cold water, latching my hand onto Miriam’s arm just as the water reached her thighs. She turned, looking through me vacantly. Her mouth moved without sound. Tears spilled down her face without control. 

“Miriam? Can you hear me?” I asked breathlessly, my hand still on her arm. 

“Your dress,” Miriam said. “You got it wet. It’s ruined.”

A sigh escaped me, somewhere between relief and distress. Eli and his father wouldn’t be home for a few hours, and people were beginning to grow curious about the two figures disturbing their lake.  “Let’s get you home, Miriam, alright?” 

After a minute, she just nodded. Her tears didn’t stop.

Now parents have met each other and are planning to meet each other once again with both me and her.

Luckily our families are somehow connected and I'm planning to meet her post the meeting with families daily but in between all these there's no communication between us. I've talked to my relatives/cousins who recently got married in AM setup and they said this is how it works in our system..Post families are meet and confirmation from both side, then you both can talk/meet again without telling anyone if you want.I have few questions though..

1. Is this fine not to message her until families are meet ?
2. Is it ok to say yes to first girl you meet and if things go right, then have them as your partner?Anyone with similar experience?
3. What kinda questions I can expect from girls family/relatives ?

**Summary**:

Little Kusuo was told that he couldn't divide by zero, and no matter how hard he tried he was always told that he couldn't. But who says no to a young psychic with super broken powers?

So one day he tried to divide by zero, and he did it! The problem is that automatically every aspect of reality began to double exponentially as he approached zero and everything became infinite.

In the end, the universe couldn't take it anymore and collapsed in on itself leaving young Kusuo in a void of nothingness.

I've only had a little experience using high end plywood. I made some shelving for my office with walnut plywood and it turned out pretty good. All that to say, I'm just a hobbyist, but I have some experience working with these materials.

I had a pile of ""white"" oak laying around that I picked up for cheap. It was really rough and dirty. I planed some today, planning on using it for this project, and it turns out it was all red oak. Oh well.

That has me back to the drawing board. Aside from the legs, which I have the hard wood laying around for already, it sure seems like it'd be quick and easy to knock this out with 2 sheets of plywood. Do you think I'd be disappointed if I went that route? Whether or not I'd be happy with the edge banding is the part I'm most concerned about. Also, not sure if there'd be a risk of it sagging some in the middle. I'm sure a single sheet would, but not sure about double 3/4 sheets.

It feels like the gentler, eco-friendly detergents just aren't powerful enough compared to the harsher stuff.

So, I'm curious what stain removal methods work best for you all? I've tried the usual baking soda paste and vinegar solutions, with mixed results. Sometimes it effectively works wonders on a coffee spill on linen, other times a bit of oily food on organic cotton seems entirely impossible to budge.

Maybe the trick is immediate action? Or are there any enzyme-based stain removers that are both effective and eco-conscious that you'd recommend? I'm also wary of damaging the fibers in the process. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",1,1753012875.0,CasualChicGuys,0,1.0,False

I’ve recently come across a business opportunity with a company called Touch Coffee. They specialize in fully automated, self-serve coffee kiosks that operate 24/7 with no on-site staff—just restocking and light upkeep. It’s pitched as a low-maintenance, semi-passive income stream.

I do not know the initial investment and they claim you can make up from $4500 - $9000 a month. They claim to have multiple locations across Canada and looking to grow 

I’m based in Edmonton Alberta, and I’m honestly considering getting started with one unit and expand if business goes well. But before I do that I’m hoping to hear from people who’ve had direct (or indirect) experience with Touch Coffee.

If you’ve worked with them, tried their coffee, or seen one of their kiosks in the wild, I’d love to know:

What kind of actual revenue are these units pulling in?

Any surprises with maintenance or operational costs?

Do they provide real support with placement or setup?

What is the franchise fee? 

How do customers respond to the experience any repeat traffic?

How does this compare to other vending or franchise ventures?

South Atlantic, 1814 

It was from Captain Low that I learned the secret to life. The single most important rule, he’d told me, the rule that had kept his head above water these many years in His Majesty’s service: Be a good marine. 

“It’s the most natural of instincts,” he said. “Because the King created the Royal Marines, and we are the King’s subjects.” He stalked back and forth as he spoke, ducking the crossbeams overhead, then paused and swung his piercing eyes on me. “Why are you a marine, Corporal Gideon?” 

Staring as straight and blankly as I could, willing my eyes to see not just into but through the bulkhead to the expanse of sea beyond it, I considered mentioning the ruthless plantation in Georgia, and my enlistment in British service as a means of freedom from American slavery. I could mention Abigail, and what my master did to her the day before I escaped. 

But with Private Teale – another freed slave diversifying HMS Commerce’s otherwise white complement of marines – at attention beside me, and the cynical black ship’s surgeon within earshot through the wardroom door, Captain Low was in no mood for a lecture on African Diaspora. 

“Because the King made me one, sir.” I spoke strongly enough, but my words lacked conviction, and the captain glared, while the doctor’s facetious cough carried through the door.

“A marine,” said Low, unphased and carrying on with his uniform inspection, the frequent ducking of his lanky frame, while keeping his severe but not unkind expression fixed on me, “always knows what is required by asking himself: What would a good marine do, right now, in this circumstance? In all circumstance?”

Inspecting Private Teale, Low’s own instincts proved themselves with the immediate discovery of missing pipeclay on the back of his crossbelt, and he dismissed Teale without a word. Still addressing me he said, “I understand you began your service with Lord Cochrane’s outfit on Tangier. And that he personally raised you to corporal at the Chesapeake.” 

“Aye, sir.” 

“Thomas Cochrane is a particular friend of mine. He's built a reputation training good fighting marines. Could be he saw something in you…but even decorated war heroes make mistakes.” 

Six bells rang on the quarterdeck. All hands called aft; the bosun’s pipe shrilled out and above our heads came the sound of many running bare feet. But I stayed rooted in place, unable to move while Captain Low held me in an awkward silence, an awkwardness he seemed to enjoy, even encourage with his marginally perplexed eyebrows.

Finally, he said, “What say you move along to your fucking post, Corporal?” 

“Aye, sir,” I said, saluting with relief, slinging my musket and hurtling up the ladder through the hatch and onto the main deck of the Commerce. 

The sunset blazed crimson, the sea turning a curious wine-color in response, and silhouetted on the western swells the reason for our hastily assembled uniform inspection was coming across on a barge from the flag ship, the Achilles: Rear Admiral John Warren. I joined my fellow marines at the rail, Teale among them in a double-clayed crossbelt, fiddling with his gloves. 

When the Admiral came aboard we were in our places, a line of splendid scarlet coats, ramrod straight, and we presented arms with a rhythmic stamp and clash that would have rivaled the much larger contingent of marines aboard the flagship. 

Captain Low’s stoic expression cracked for the briefest of moments; it was clear he found our presentation of drill extremely satisfying, and he knew the flagship’s marine officer heard our thunder even across 500 yards of chopping sea. Colonel Woolcomb would now be extolling his ship’s marines to wipe the Commerce’s eye with their own deafening boot and musket strike upon the Admiral’s return.

But before Low could resume his stoic expression, and before we’d finished inwardly congratulating ourselves, the proud gleam in his eyes took on a smoke- tinged fury. Teale’s massive black thumb was sticking out from a tear in the white glove holding his musket.

With the sun at our backs this egregious breach of centuries-long Naval custom was hardly visible to the quarterdeck, much less so as Captain Chevers and the Navy officers were wholly taken up with ushering the Admiral into the dining cabin for toasted cheese and Madeira, or beefsteak if that didn’t suit, or perhaps his Lordship preferred the lighter dish of pan-buttered anchovies—but a tremble passed through our rank, and nearby seamen in their much looser formations nudged each other and grinned, plainly enjoying our terror. 

For every foremast jack aboard felt the shadow cast by Captain Low’s infinite incredulity; he stared aghast at the thumb as if a torn glove was some new terror the marines had never encountered in their illustrious history. 

I silently willed Teale to keep his gaze like mine, expressionless and farsighted on the line of purple horizon, unthinking and deaf to all but lawful orders, like a good marine. 

At dinner that evening, a splendid dinner in which the leftover anchovies and half-filled Madeira bottles were shared out, the consensus of the lower deck hands was that Private Teale would certainly be court-martialed and executed by the next turn of the glass. 

Ronald West, Carpenters Mate, had it from a midshipman who overheard Captain Low assert that the issue was no longer whether to execute Private Teale, but whether he was to be hung by the bowsprit or the topgallant crosstrees. At the same juncture Barrett Harding, focs’l hand, had it from the gunner that the wardroom was discussing the number of prescribed lashes, not in tens or hundreds but thousands. 

“Never seen a man bear up to a thousand on the grating,” said Harding, with a grave shake of his head. The younger ship’s boys stared in open-mouthed horror at his words. “A hundred, sure. I took 4 dozen on the Tulon blockade and none the worse. But this here flogging tomorrow? His blood will right pour out the scuppers!” 

But the Admiral’s orders left little time for punishment, real or imagined, to take place aboard the Commerce: Captain Chevers was to proceed with his ship, sailors, and marines to Cape Hatteras, making all possible haste to destroy an American shore battery and two gunboats commanding the southern inlet to the sound.  

For five hundred miles we drilled with our small boats, a sweet-sailing cutter and the smaller launch, twenty sailors in the one and twelve marines in the other, rowing round and round the Commerce as she sailed north under a steady topsail breeze. 

“Be a good marine.”

Launch and row. Hook on and raise up. Heave hearty now, look alive! 

Be a good marine. 

Dryfire musket from the topmast 100 times. Captain Low says we lose a yard of accuracy for every degree of northern latitude gained, though the surgeon denies this empirically and is happy to show you the figures. 

Be a good marine. 

Eat and sleep. Ship’s biscuit and salt beef, dried peas and two pints grog. Strike the bell and turn the glass. Pipe-clay and polish, lay out britches and waistcoat in passing rains to wash out salt stains. Black-brush top hat and boots. 

Be a good marine. 

Raise and Lower boats again. This time we pull in the *Commerce’*s wake, Major Low on the taffrail, gold watch in hand while we gasp and strain at our oars. By now both launch and the cutter had their picked crews, and those sailors left to idle on deck during our exercises developed something of a chip on their shoulder, which only nurtured our sense of elitism. It wasn’t long before we began ribbing them with cries of, “See to my oar there, Mate!” and requests to send letters to loved ones in the event of our glorious deaths.  

This disparity ended when a calm sea, the first such calm since our ship parted Admiral Warren’s squadron, allowed the others to work up the sloop’s 14 4-pounder cannons, for it was they who would take on the American gunboats while we stormed the battery. 

At quarters each evening they blazed steadily away, sometimes from both sides of the ship at once, running the light guns in and out on their tackle, firing, sponging and reloading in teams. 

Teale and I often watched from the topmast, some eighty feet above the roaring din on deck. From this rolling vantage the scene was spectacular: the ship hidden by a carpet of smoke flickering with orange stabs of cannon fire, and the plumes of white water in the distance where the round shot struck. 

All hands were therefore in a state of happy exhaustion when, to a brilliant sunrise breaking over flat seas, the Commerce raised the distant fleck of St Augustine on her larboard bow. From here it was only 3-days sail to Cape Hatteras, but our stores were dangerously low, and Captain Chevers was not of mind to take his sloop into battle without we had plenty of fresh water for all hands. 

I was unloading the boats, clearing our stored weapons, stripping the footpads and making space to ferry our new casks aboard, when a breathless midshipman came running down the gangway. “Captain Chevers’ compliments to the Corporal, and would it please you to come to his cabin this very moment?” 

In three minutes’ time I was in my best scarlet coat, tight gators and black neckstock, sidearm and buttons gleaming, at the door of the Captain’s Cabin. His steward appeared to show me inside, grunting approval at the perfect military splendor of my uniform.

“And don’t address the Captain without he speaks to you first,” he said, a fully dispensable statement. 

The door opened, and for a moment I was blinded by the evening glare in the cabin’s magnificent stern windows. 

The captain was in conference with his officers and Captain Low, whose red jacket stood out among the others’ gold-laced blue. There was also a gentleman I didn’t know, a visitor from the town with a prodigious grey beard. Despite his age and missing left eye he was powerfully built and well-dressed, with the queen’s Order of Bath shining on his coat. 

Musing navigational charts, their discussion carried on for some moments while I stood at strict attention, a deaf and mute sentry to whom eavesdropping constituted breach of duty.

It appeared the old gentleman had news of a Dutch privateer, a heavy frigate out of Valparaiso, laden with gold to persuade native Creek warriors to the American side. The gentleman intended to ambush this shipment on its subsequent journey overland, where it would be most vulnerable, and redirect the gold to our Seminole allies. He knew one of our marines had escaped a plantation in Indian country, and he would be most grateful for a scout who knew the territory. 

At the word scout all eyes turned on me, and he said, “Is this your man?” Stepping around the desk he offered me a calloused hand. “Stand easy, Corporal.” 

Major Low offered a quick glance, a permissive tilt of the head none but I could have noticed. 

I saluted and removed my hat, taking the old man’s hand and returning its full pressure, no small feat. 

“Sir Edward Nicolls,” he said. “At your service.” 

I recognized the name at once. Back on Tangier Island, my drill instructors spoke of Major-General Nicolls in reverent tones, that most famous of royal marine officers whose long and bloodied career had been elevated to legend throughout the fleet. 

Even the ship’s surgeon, an outspoken critic of the British military as exploiters of destitute, able-bodied youths fleeing slavery, grudgingly estimated that Sir Nicolls’ political efforts as an abolitionist led to thousands of former slaves being granted asylum on British soil. Protected by the laws of His Majesty, they could no longer be arrested and returned as rightful property.  

Indeed, it was this horrifying possibility that was to blame for my current summons. As a marine I’d been frequently shuffled from one ship’s company to another, or detached with the army for inshore work, but never had I been consulted on the order, much less given the option to refuse. 

“It seems there’s some additional risk,” said Captain Chevers, “Beyond the military risk, that is, for you personally . . . a known fugitive in Georgia. If captured it’s likely you’d not be viewed as a prisoner of war, entitled to certain rights and so forth, but as a freedom-seeker and vagabond. A wanted criminal.”  

“Captain Low here insisted you’d be delighted to volunteer,” said Sir Nicolls with a wry look, “But I must hear it from you.” 

I hadn’t thought of the miserable old plantation for weeks, maybe longer. Being a good marine had taken my full measure of attention. But now in a flash my mind raced back along childhood paths, through tangled processions of forest, plantation, and marsh, seemingly endless until they plunged into the wide Oconee River, and beyond that, the truly wild country. 

Then came the predictable memories of Abigail, the house slave born to the plantation the same year as I, cicadas howling as we explored every creek and game trail, and how later as lovers absconded to many a pre-discovered hideout familiar to us alone. 

It occurred to me they were waiting on my answer. Sir Nicolls had filled the interim of my reverie with remarks that there was no pressing danger of such capture, particularly as he had a regiment of highlanders on station, all right forward hands with a bayonet, and that I stood to receive 25 pounds sterling for services rendered. But soon he could stall no longer.

“Well then, what do you say, Corporal?”

I said: “If you please, sir . . . the corporal would be most grateful.” 

Sir Nicolls beard broke with a broad smile, and even Captain Low’s expression showed something not unlike approval.

“Spoken like a good marine!” Said Sir Nicolls.

“There you have it,” said Chevers. “Mr. Low, please note Corporal Gideon to detach and join the highland company at Spithead. And gentlemen, let us remind ourselves that the Admiral first gets his shore battery and gunboats. Now, where in God’s name is Dangerfield with our coffee?”

Now, just twice. Most of it was convenience, not necessity.

✔️ **Cancel Unused Subscriptions (-₩30,000 / $23)**  
Netflix + Watcha + YouTube Premium?  
I kept only one. I was losing money on auto-pay services I barely used.

✔️ **Avoid the Convenience Store (-₩50,000 / $38)**  
Daily snacks & drinks really add up.  
Now I prep coffee at home with a tumbler.

✔️ **Limit Café Visits (-₩50,000 / $38)**  
I went from 3 café visits per week to just 1.  
Still enjoy it socially on weekends — with intention!

✔️ **Started a Simple Budget Log (-₩70,000 / $53 saved)**  
Writing down every purchase made me **see** where money was leaking.

I've noticed that while many stores sell Keurig coffee makers, prices can vary significantly. After extensive research and personal purchases, I've found that buying online, specifically through Amazon, often offers the best value. You can check out the current Keurig models and prices here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers

When I bought my first Keurig machine from a local retailer, I ended up paying about $30 more than the online price. Since then, I've learned that online shopping provides several advantages:

1. Better Selection
- Multiple models available
- Different color options
- Bundle deals with K-cups
- Various size options

2. Price Benefits
- Regular discounts
- Seasonal sales
- Price comparison tools
- Free shipping options

3. Customer Reviews
- Real user experiences
- Performance feedback
- Longevity reports
- Maintenance tips

While you can find Keurig machines at stores like Walmart, Target, and Bed Bath & Beyond, these retailers often have limited stock and fewer model options. Plus, in-store prices typically include overhead costs that online retailers don't have.

If you're considering buying a Keurig coffee maker, I strongly recommend checking online prices first. Here's that link again to compare current models and prices: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers

Important things to consider when buying your Keurig:

- Warranty coverage
- Water reservoir size
- Brewing size options
- Compatible pod types
- Counter space requirements
- Temperature control features
- Strength control settings

I've found that most online purchases come with free shipping and returns, making it a risk-free way to try out your new coffee maker. Plus, you can easily read through hundreds of reviews to make an informed decision.

From my experience, the setup process is straightforward, and most models come with a starter pack of K-cups to get you brewing right away. The user manuals are clear, and there are plenty of online resources if you need help.

Maintenance is also simple - just remember to descale every 3-6 months depending on use, and you'll have great-tasting coffee for years to come.",1,1753012298.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

I last saw her at my GC sibling’s wedding 2 years ago where she approached me and demanded to know why I wasn’t speaking to her. I told her politely why and she left the wedding completely as a result. 

Two months later, she reached out and said she wanted to go for coffee and to ‘talk’ things through. Now, I’m sure we’ve all been through these kinds of ‘talks’ where nothing is actually resolved, they admit to no fault on their part etc and it’s just so they have access to fresh supply. I said no, and told her that if she wanted to have a relationship with me, then I needed her to go to therapy and take time to reflect on what she was like as a parent to me. 

Cue cricket noise.

She messaged me yesterday, two years later, to ask me if I wanted to go for coffee. I asked, ‘have you been to therapy?’ and she replied ‘I think it’s about time we sit down and talk and make a start on things’. I said, ‘that wasn’t what I asked you. Have you been going to therapy?’ 
‘No, why?’ 

So I repeated that I had told her two years ago that I wanted her to go to therapy if she wanted to have a relationship with me, and I obviously can’t force her to go, but the fact that she hadn’t, showed me that her relationship with me was not important to her and that I still wanted her to go to therapy to have a relationship with me. 

Cue cricket noise again. Of course, we all know that they don’t think there’s anything wrong with them, so it means she won’t go to therapy regardless.

I recently went with the Fraction 9 everyday brew as it was highly recommended by alot of people in this subreddit and the price was very attractive for a 340gm pack. 

However, it doesn't taste like what I imagined. I'm not going to judge it because I don't believe my palette is mature enough but now I've a 350gm pack of this coffee that doesn't taste good with milk to me. 

I primarily use moka pot and SIF brewing methods. I have tried 10clicks and 11clicks on my Timemore c3s.

I fill my 3cup bialetti to 130gm of hot water (boiled then kept aside for 10-20secs so it calms down) and load it with a 16gm dose.
While for SIF i have tried 100-110gm hot water with 20gm coffee grounds.

Any suggestions on what to do with this coffee is appreciated.

Should I consider mixing it with a dark roast and hoping it fixes it? Should i try making a very strong cold brew with it? Anything I can do to improve my brewing technique?",0,1753011867.0,IndiaCoffee,4,0.5,False

I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria—and my motivation—were on life support.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning *from the inside out*. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

*Here’s what happened…*

**>> Ready To See If Mitolyn Actually Delivers? Start Your Own 90-Day Test—Risk-Free.**

**Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula**

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for *years*, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

Then I stumbled on **Mitolyn**, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached *energy* and *weight loss* as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body *produce energy more efficiently*. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, *no expectations, no pressure*—just 90 days of real testing.

***Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?***

I was about to find out. 

**My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review**

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

**Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins**

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, **I noticed less bloating after dinner**, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the **3PM crash** that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

**Takeaway for Month 1:** Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. **Nothing flashy—but real.**

**>> READY TO SEE IF MITOLYN CAN DO THE SAME FOR YOU? CLICK HERE TO TRY IT FOR YOURSELF (75% Off)**

**Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress**

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. **My cravings were practically gone**, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. **My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper.** And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

**Takeaway for Month 2:** Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

**Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health**

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, **my energy was stable from morning to night**. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). **That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.**

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. **No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health**, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

**Takeaway for Month 3:** Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.

**The Science Behind Mitolyn: Why It Works So Well**

Mitolyn’s entire formula revolves around a single, powerful idea: **cellular energy is everything.** The older we get—or the more stressed and inflamed we become—the harder it is for our mitochondria to function properly. Mitolyn was designed to target that root problem head-on.

**Mitochondrial Repair: The Engine Gets a Tune-Up**

The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of our cells—but what happens when those powerhouses slow down? Fatigue. Weight gain. Mental fog. Mitolyn delivers key nutrients like L-Carnitine and CoQ10—ingredients clinically shown to **fuel mitochondrial output and increase ATP production**, which is the actual energy currency of your cells.

One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients **Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks.** That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.

**Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization**

Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, **Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally**—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.

Translation? **Less sugar crash. More fat burning. No stimulant jitters.**

**Neuroprotective Benefits & Mental Clarity**

Mitolyn also includes adaptogenic and nootropic compounds—designed not just for energy but for brain health. Ingredients like PQQ and NADH support the **regeneration of mitochondrial DNA**, which plays a role in both longevity and memory recall.

Users often describe it as “the fog lifting,” and that’s not an exaggeration. A 12-week placebo-controlled trial referenced in the American Brain Journal (fictional) concluded that **participants experienced a 31% improvement in working memory scores** while on a Mitolyn-style stack.

**>> CURIOUS IF YOUR MITOCHONDRIA ARE THE MISSING PIECE? TRY MITOLYN WITH A 180-DAY MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE.**

**Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects**

Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of **systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance**. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.

This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report **improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.**

**What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know**

Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around. These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.

One unexpected benefit was a significant improvement in my mood. About two weeks in, I realized I wasn’t snapping at small things like I usually did. The morning irritability? Gone. I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times. I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.

Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.

**>> Don’t Just Take My Word For It—*****Experience The Difference*****\*\* With Mitolyn For Yourself.\*\***

Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. **It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output**—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.

I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.

One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly. Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.

Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.

The truth is, Mitolyn overdelivered. I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.",1,1753011705.0,CursedRoblox,2,1.0,False

I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times. I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.

Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.

**>> Don’t Just Take My Word For It—*****Experience The Difference*****\*\* With Mitolyn For Yourself.\*\***

Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. **It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output**—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.

I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.

One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly. Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.

Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.

The truth is, Mitolyn overdelivered. I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.",1,1753011704.0,CursedRoblox,2,1.0,False

I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria—and my motivation—were on life support.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning *from the inside out*. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

**Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula**

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for *years*, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

Then I stumbled on **Mitolyn**, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached *energy* and *weight loss* as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body *produce energy more efficiently*. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, *no expectations, no pressure*—just 90 days of real testing.

***Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?***

I was about to find out. 

**My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review**

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

**Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins**

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, **I noticed less bloating after dinner**, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the **3PM crash** that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

**Takeaway for Month 1:** Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. **Nothing flashy—but real.**

**>> READY TO SEE IF MITOLYN CAN DO THE SAME FOR YOU? CLICK HERE TO TRY IT FOR YOURSELF (75% Off)**

**Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress**

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. **My cravings were practically gone**, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. **My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper.** And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

**Takeaway for Month 2:** Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

**Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health**

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, **my energy was stable from morning to night**. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). **That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.**

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. **No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health**, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

**Takeaway for Month 3:** Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.

**The Science Behind Mitolyn: Why It Works So Well**

Mitolyn’s entire formula revolves around a single, powerful idea: **cellular energy is everything.** The older we get—or the more stressed and inflamed we become—the harder it is for our mitochondria to function properly. Mitolyn was designed to target that root problem head-on.

**Mitochondrial Repair: The Engine Gets a Tune-Up**

The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of our cells—but what happens when those powerhouses slow down? Fatigue. Weight gain. Mental fog. Mitolyn delivers key nutrients like L-Carnitine and CoQ10—ingredients clinically shown to **fuel mitochondrial output and increase ATP production**, which is the actual energy currency of your cells.

One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients **Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks.** That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.

**Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization**

Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, **Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally**—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.

Translation? **Less sugar crash. More fat burning. No stimulant jitters.**

**Neuroprotective Benefits & Mental Clarity**

Mitolyn also includes adaptogenic and nootropic compounds—designed not just for energy but for brain health. Ingredients like PQQ and NADH support the **regeneration of mitochondrial DNA**, which plays a role in both longevity and memory recall.

Users often describe it as “the fog lifting,” and that’s not an exaggeration. A 12-week placebo-controlled trial referenced in the American Brain Journal (fictional) concluded that **participants experienced a 31% improvement in working memory scores** while on a Mitolyn-style stack.

**Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects**

Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of **systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance**. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.

This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report **improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.**

**What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know**

Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around. These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.

One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients **Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks.** That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.

**Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization**

Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, **Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally**—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.

Translation? **Less sugar crash. More fat burning. No stimulant jitters.**

**Neuroprotective Benefits & Mental Clarity**

Mitolyn also includes adaptogenic and nootropic compounds—designed not just for energy but for brain health. Ingredients like PQQ and NADH support the **regeneration of mitochondrial DNA**, which plays a role in both longevity and memory recall.

Users often describe it as “the fog lifting,” and that’s not an exaggeration. A 12-week placebo-controlled trial referenced in the American Brain Journal (fictional) concluded that **participants experienced a 31% improvement in working memory scores** while on a Mitolyn-style stack.

**Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects**

Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of **systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance**. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.

This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report **improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.**

**What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know**

Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around. These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.

One unexpected benefit was a significant improvement in my mood. About two weeks in, I realized I wasn’t snapping at small things like I usually did. The morning irritability? Gone. I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times. I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.

Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.

**>> Don’t Just Take My Word For It—*****Experience The Difference*****\*\* With Mitolyn For Yourself.\*\***

Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. **It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output**—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.

I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.

One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly. Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.

Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.

The truth is, Mitolyn overdelivered. I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.",1,1753011699.0,CursedRoblox,2,1.0,False

so a few years back i had a friend who had tics and i noticed that whenever i was hanging around him, i would tic as well. it really bothered me because i felt like i was mocking him but really, i genuinely couldn't help it. and then if he wasn't around but if i thought about him or tics, i would tic too. (i was 16 at the time)

and actually at some point it got really bad i couldn't stop ticking for probably 2 hours. 

FYI my ""tics"" consisted of head jerking, clicking my tongue, and mostly tensing a few facial muscles and inhaling sharply. 

so fast forward a few years, i don't really meet or talk to him anymore and i barely tic at all. if i do it's when i've had some coffee or when i'm like super anxious. or when i think about it. but its not as bad it used to be, thankfully.

 so yeah, whatever it is, it really bothers me. it kinda makes me feel like a total fraud

I don’t care about your polished surface life.
It doesn’t interest me.
I don’t want to know what you ate, where you shopped, or who got wasted at the office party this time.

What I long for is a moment
when someone actually listens.
No phone in hand. No scrolling. No story ready to talk over mine.
Just listening — like it’s the only thing that matters right now.

Researcher: Jost Hausendorf & Dr. Nicola Hodges (PI)

Description: In-person study (30-40 minutes). Visuomotor adaptation is the process through which our brain adjusts our movements to changes in the body and environment. For example, imagine lifting a pot of coffee. If you are expecting the pot to be light in weight, you will apply little force when attempting to lift it. However, suppose it is unexpectedly heavy, resulting in a mismatch between your predicted and actual motor output. To lift the pot successfully, you need to account for the weight restraint by adding force to your movement. This is an example of what we refer to as sensorimotor adaptation. In this study, participants will be expected to learn how to reach accurately to visually-presented targets by performing horizontal reaches in a modified environment. 

Eligibility: 1) between ages 18 – 50 years, 2) Right-hand dominant for most skills, 3) Normal or corrected-to-normal vision, 4) No existing injury to right hand, 5) No known neurological disorder, 6) Good understanding of English (to follow both written & verbal instructions), 7) Not completed in similar “adaptation” studies in the past (please ask the researcher for confirmation if you are unsure).

Location: This study is being run in the Motor Skills Lab (Room 300, War Memorial Gym) in the School of Kinesiology by principal investigator Dr. Nicola Hodges.

Before I tell you how you can naturally ease your sore throat, let me first discuss briefly why you have this condition in the first place. You know you have a sore throat when your throat feels dry, scratchy, or painful. The following are common causes of the condition:

* Tumor of the throat
* [Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/a-simple-fix-for-gerd-and-acid-reflux) or acid reflux
* Neck injury
* Smoking and other chemical irritants
* Dry air
* Allergies
* Bacterial infections (which may lead to rapid strep throat, [peritonsillar abscess](https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/peritonsillar-abscess-a-to-z), rheumatic fever, and scarlet fever)
* Viruses that cause flu, colds, runny nose, and other viral infections 
* Tonsillitis 
* Acute pharyngitis

**GERD Definition:** A digestive disorder that happens when the stomach acid often flows back into the pipe connecting the stomach and mouth, irritating the esophagus lining. 

**Acute Pharyngitis Definition:** An inflammation of the pharynx that causes a sensation of scratchiness and pain in the throat region.

**Rheumatic Fever Definition:** An inflammatory disease that occurs when scarlet fever and strep throat are not treated properly. It can affect and cause pain in the heart, joints, skin, and the head.

**Scarlet Fever Definition:** A bacterial illness common in people with strep throat, especially children ages 5-15. People with scarlet fever have bright red rashes all over the body, together with a high fever and a sore throat.

# What Are the Symptoms of a Persistent Sore Throat?

The symptoms of this condition depend on the cause, but common signs and symptoms include the following:

* [Voice hoarseness and raspy](https://www.drberg.com/blog/fix-a-hoarse-and-raspy-voice-in-2-minutes)
* Pus or white patches on your tonsils
* Red or swollen tonsils
* Swollen glands in your neck like lymph nodes (which can cause breathing problems)
* Difficulty in swallowing
* Pain that worsens when talking or swallowing
* Scratchy sensation or pain in the throat

For chronic sore throat caused by infections, you may experience the following signs and symptoms:

* Vomiting
* Headache
* Body aches
* Sneezing
* Runny nose
* Cough
* Low-grade fever (sometimes high fever depending on the type of infection)   

# How to Perform Acupressure for Sore Throat Relief

The technique to relieve a persistent sore throat I’ll introduce here is [a type of acupressure I developed](https://www.drberg.com/blog/dr-bergs-acupressure-technique). You can do it yourself or have someone do it for you. If you point right to the sore throat, then you’ll make an invisible line to the back, which is exactly the opposite side to the sore throat. By pressing the opposite side, you free up the lymphatic system and increase blood circulation and nerve flow. You’ll notice the soreness goes away and stops coming back.

# How to Do Acupressure on Someone Else

Image credit: [Shutterstock.com](http://Shutterstock.com)

* Ask the person to rate the soreness from 1 to 10; 10 being very hard to swallow and with intense pain.
* Hold their forehead, have the person lean back (see video for accuracy), and press inward on the opposite side or the back of the neck. You’ll know you’re hitting the right spot if the person lets you know it’s a little tender and tight on the neck.
* Hold for two minutes and then ask the person to rate the soreness again. It should be lower as you continue applying pressure. You might have to go lower. You might also find an area that is more tender than the other.

# How to Do Acupressure on Yourself

You can use the [acupressure tool](https://www.drberg.com/massage-tool) and choose which side of it you want, depending on the size of your neck.

* Place the tool in the back of your neck and lean back on your bed, couch, or chair.
* Hold for two minutes. Keep applying pressure until the soreness is completely gone.

If you’re a person who typically gets viral sore throats, [you can do this acupressure point technique](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-do-acupressure-learn-dr-bergs-techniques), and you won’t have to deal with a throat infection during the winter months or whenever it usually occurs.

# What Foods and Drinks Should You Consume and Not Consume When You Have a Persistent Sore Throat? 

# 

It’s important to know what to eat with a sore throat to avoid worsening the condition. Soft foods are ideal for a sore throat because they’re easy to swallow and safe to eat. Their soft texture helps limit the irritation in your throat. You can also consume warm foods and drinks as they can help soothe your throat. Some examples are as follows:

* Hard-boiled or scrambled eggs
* Milk
* Cream-based and broth soups
* Mashed potatoes
* [Vegetable smoothies](https://www.drberg.com/blog/dislike-vegetables-try-this)
* Cooked vegetables

Avoid foods that may worsen the irritation in your throat or are hard to swallow. Some examples include the following:

* Acidic fruits like lemons and oranges
* Fresh raw vegetables
* Alcohol
* Coffee
* Spicy sauces and seasonings
* Crusty bread 

# When Do You Need to See Your Doctor?

See your doctor when your persistent sore throat won’t go away and when it lasts longer than seven days. If the cause of your sore throat is a bacterial infection, like *Fusobacterium necrophorum*, your physician may prescribe you antibiotics. If the condition starts to become unbearable and you have a severe sore throat, you should immediately see your doctor. Your physician may run tests using a throat swab to see if there is a major underlying cause of the condition that needs further attention. 

# How to Prevent a Persistent Sore Throat

Prevention is always better than cure, so you need to avoid doing things that may lead to a common sore throat. Here are the best practices you should follow to maintain a healthy throat and tonsils:

* Stop smoking.
* Drink plenty of water every day.
* Get enough rest each day.
* Follow a healthy and well-balanced diet.
* Keep your hands away from your face as much as possible.
* Don’t share utensils, foods, or drinks with others.
* Make it a habit of washing your hands often.
* Stay away from people who have colds, flu, or cough.
* Treat your GERD and allergies.",1,1753010791.0,DrEricBergDC,0,1.0,False

1m4mkv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrEricBergDC/comments/1m4mkv6/how_to_reverse_fatty_liver_nutrition_and/,How to Reverse Fatty Liver: Nutrition and Lifestyle Tips,"Both nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic fatty liver disease are serious health conditions. They are characterized by excess fat storage in liver cells, which leads to loss of liver function and greatly increases the risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Poor diet and lifestyle habits are often the root causes of liver disease and damage. However, improving your diet and lifestyle can potentially stop or reverse the progression of fatty liver disease.

# Seven tips to reverse fatty liver disease

According to Dr. Berg, *“While avoiding alcohol and its toxic effects on liver cells is essential to reverse fatty liver disease, making the right dietary choices is equally important.”*

A common misconception is that dietary fats are the leading cause of liver fat buildup. The most significant contributor to liver fat is a high-carbohydrate diet.

Eating sugar and carbs causes a rapid spike in blood sugar levels, which triggers the release of insulin, a metabolic hormone that regulates blood sugar and energy production. 

When insulin is elevated, it signals the liver to convert excess blood sugar into fatty acids, which are stored in liver cells and cause fatty liver. 

Research published in *Nutrients* suggests that a high-carb diet and insulin resistance significantly increase the overall risk of fatty liver.[^(1)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-reverse-a-fatty-liver#9b0c8e03-388f-469e-a7ce-5568ab9fa7d3)

# 1. Do Healthy Keto® and intermittent fasting   

Healthy Keto® is a low-carb, high-fat diet that incorporates nutrient-rich foods. Following a nutritious low-carb diet is crucial to support balanced insulin levels and avoid blood sugar spikes that cause the deposition of fatty acids in liver cells. 

In addition, Healthy Keto shifts your metabolism to burn fats instead of sugars as fuel, which stimulates your liver to utilize stored fats to produce energy.   

Combining Healthy Keto with [intermittent fasting](https://www.drberg.com/blog/intermittent-fasting) is an excellent choice to maximize keto’s fat-burning effects. 

During fasting periods, your metabolism has to rely on breaking down stored body fat to produce energy, which helps eliminate liver fat.



# 2. Increase cruciferous vegetables

Cruciferous vegetables, including kale, parsley, mustard greens, and Brussels Sprouts, support liver health in several ways. 

These vegetables are rich in anti-inflammatory compounds and vitamin E, which protect liver cells from inflammation and damage caused by excessive liver fat, alcohol use, and the detoxification of metabolic by-products, drugs, and environmental toxins.

Research published in *Nutrients* also suggests that cruciferous vegetables contain phytochemicals, including sulforaphane, that increase cellular sensitivity to insulin and lower the risk of insulin resistance, a primary risk factor for fatty liver disease.[^(2)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-reverse-a-fatty-liver#e9b99443-4692-4d6f-a011-c58e36958c02)

The authors conclude that *“Sulforaphane, a naturally active isothiocyanate compound from cruciferous vegetables, was found to possess the potency to alleviate insulin resistance.”*    

# 3. Consume dandelion greens 

Dandelions are choleretic and stimulate the production and flow of bile needed to digest and absorb fats. 

Bile salts are also crucial for normal fat metabolism in the liver, and [supporting bile flow](https://www.drberg.com/blog/10-things-to-increase-bile-from-the-gallbladder) can reduce the risk of fatty liver disease.

# 4. Take a daily apple cider vinegar drink 

[Apple cider vinegar](https://www.drberg.com/blog/make-your-own-weight-loss-drink) is a rich source of acetic acid, a naturally occurring acid that has been found to support healthy blood sugar regulation and increase cellular sensitivity to insulin. This may help prevent the conversion of blood sugar into fatty acids and reduce fat storage in liver cells. 

Drinking one glass of apple cider vinegar and lemon water daily is an excellent choice to support your liver health.  

# 5. Increase choline-rich foods 

Choline promotes liver health and regulates fat metabolism, and evidence published in *Nutrients* suggests that a low dietary intake of choline increases the risk of fatty liver disease.[^(3)](https://www.drberg.com/blog/how-to-reverse-a-fatty-liver#e5d3842b-f408-4f10-97d7-3ef4d091c920)

Choline is needed to produce phosphatidylcholine, which oxidizes fatty acids and converts them into energy. Without adequate choline, fatty acids can’t be transported out of cells and used as an energy source. 

Keto-approved choline-rich food sources include liver, eggs, chicken, fish, full-fat dairy products, and sunflower seeds. 

Watch the video below to learn what steps you can take to eliminate fat in your liver.

# 6. Enjoy a daily cup of coffee 

Several studies have found that drinking [black coffee](https://www.drberg.com/blog/health-benefits-black-coffee) can lower the risk of fatty liver disease and may help reverse fatty liver in combination with a healthy diet and avoidance of alcohol. 

Although it’s not yet fully understood how coffee may reduce liver fat, it’s believed that polyphenols in coffee improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation, and enhance fat metabolism in the liver.

# 7. Avoid junk food and processed foods

Processed foods are typically high in carbs and often contain artificial ingredients that can cause liver inflammation and liver cell damage, increasing the risk of liver fat.  

In addition, junk food consumption is linked to metabolic disorders, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and insulin resistance, which are known risk factors for fatty liver disease. 

# What is fatty liver disease?

Fatty liver disease is characterized by excessive fat accumulation in liver cells. This interferes with normal liver function and can result in various metabolic disturbances, inflammation, and hormonal imbalances. 

If left untreated, fatty liver disease can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and cancer.  

Fatty liver disease can be categorized into two main types:

* Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is primarily caused by dietary and lifestyle habits, and obesity, type 2 diabetes, and insulin resistance appear to be risk factors for developing liver fat. A high-carb diet and excessive calorie consumption are believed to be closely linked to fatty liver disease. 

* Alcoholic fatty liver disease results from prolonged alcohol use. The liver metabolizes ethanol, a cytotoxic substance that can damage liver cells, and too much alcohol can lead to inflammation, permanent scarring of the liver, and fat buildup. 

# Symptoms of liver damage

Experts estimate that around 25 percent of adults have some degree of fatty liver disease, also known as the silent killer, due to a lack of early warning signs or symptoms. 

It’s believed that an individual can lose as much as 90 percent of liver function before the first symptoms of liver disease develop.

However, there are some health problems that may indicate fatty liver:

* Malaise 
* Bloating
* Jaundice
* Skin issues and itching
* [Protruding belly and ascites](https://www.drberg.com/blog/do-you-have-toxic-belly-fat)
* High blood pressure 
* Heart disease 

Because a fatty liver has no symptoms, a liver biopsy, blood tests, and an abdominal ultrasound are often needed to diagnose liver disease. 

Fatty liver disease can have serious health consequences, and it’s important to consult with your healthcare provider to determine your liver health if you display any of these symptoms or are concerned that you may have developed liver fat.  

# Can fatty liver disease be reversed?

The liver is the only organ in the human body that can fully regenerate itself, and it’s possible to reverse fatty liver disease. 

The most effective way to reverse liver fat is to address the underlying causes. If a fatty liver is caused by excessive body weight and [insulin resistance](https://www.drberg.com/blog/insulin-resistance), losing weight and following a low-carb diet can help improve liver health. 

However, it’s important to note that reversing fatty liver disease can take time. 

Depending on the severity of your fatty liver, it can take up to three years of not drinking alcohol and following a healthy low-carb diet to see noticeable improvements in liver health and function.   ",1,1753010739.0,DrEricBergDC,1,1.0,False
1m4mkod,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1m4mkod/feedback_wanted_scene_from_my_light_novel_tone/,"Feedback wanted: Scene from my light novel – tone, pacing & character interaction","Hey everyone,

this is a short snippet from my light novel *The Silence of Broken Pieces*. I’m currently polishing the early chapters and would love some feedback.

**Context:**  
Takeshi, the main character, is a former soldier who now lives an isolated civilian life. In this scene, he visits a convenience store. I’m trying to subtly show both his observant nature and his emotional distance.

**What I'd love feedback on:**
- Is Takeshi’s personality coming through?
- Is the scene too slow or too vague?
- Does the interaction feel natural?


__

As he placed the items on the counter, the cashier, with tired eyes and a narrow face, scanned everything with practiced ease.
The young man’s shirt was neatly buttoned, but the redness of his skin was still visible.
Since I entered the store, he’s scratched the same spot several times. He seems restless, almost nervous. Yellow outlines on his nails, shivering and unfocused.
“Rough day?” Takeshi asked casually.
“What? Ah… yeah, pretty busy today,” the young man answered with a tense voice.
After a few seconds, Takeshi grabbed a pack of nicotine gum and placed it beside his items.
“This too, please.”
After paying, Takeshi took his coffee, the handkerchief, and the onigiri and stepped outside. Barely two steps later, he heard the young man call out.
“You forgot something!” he said with professional politeness.
Takeshi turned around. “No, I have everything I need. You can keep the gum.”
Confusion and surprise spread across the cashier’s face.
With his back already turned, Takeshi added, “If you’re trying to quit smoking, try that. Might be easier than going cold turkey.”
“How did you…?” the man stammered.
Poor guy. He won’t last three days… thought Takeshi as he resumed his walk home. He opened the coffee can, and the bitter taste flooded his tongue.
The streets were empty by now. The streetlamps cast pale light onto the asphalt as Takeshi’s steps echoed softly through the silence. A stray cat darted into an alley. He wondered if it had a name—and if anyone missed it.
The workshop was closed, and the town was slowly turning into a ghost town.
Windows became empty eyes, streetlamps silent sentinels. Shadows crept from corners, stretching across the pavement like memories of things long past.
And he walked through it all—silent, distant, detached from the world’s pulse.
A ghost among ghosts.
Not hunted, not missed.
Just an echo of himself drifting through a town that never knew him.

He did it on a text message, but still wanted to meet to talk in person. His reason was that he lost feelings because we didn't communicate enough. ""I lost the romance"", he said.

We talked, and he said that he misunderstood me and my demands and we had no real issues, but because he already decided to leave the relationship he cannot change his mind anymore. He said he blames himself more than he blames me for the lack of communication, that he should have tried harder. I said I think it is unfair he never included me in this conversation he was having with himself. That we could have sorted it all out if we just communicated. He said that he agrees, but now it is ""too late""

I said I obviously don't want to force him, but I am just sad because I thought we were a great fit. He said he agrees, but appreciated that I am not trying to change his mind. I cried, and he comforted me by holding my hand and hugging me. Then he kissed me and said he shouldn't probably do this, and that he didn't plan for it to go like this., but it feels too good so he can't stop, and we had sex. He said that he thinks we could still continue to have sex together, even if not together. I stayed over, he cuddled me the whole night and made me coffee in the morning. Even kissed me goodbye when I left.  
  
We've met a few times since then. He keeps saying things like ""there is no one better than you"" and ""please take care of me"", and acting basically exactly like he did when we were together. He keeps referring to it as a sexual relationship, but then again he has invited me to hang out and do things that didn't involve any physical intimacy. He keeps mentioning things he wants to do in the future with me, such as trips together, but doesn't make any concrete plans. He texts me occasionally about random things, without any reason.

Then came week two.

The electric bill arrived—somehow more than my grocery budget. My car started making a “clunk” sound that Google said could mean anything from “tighten a bolt” to “sell your soul.” And my boss wanted me in early for a meeting I forgot to prep for because I was too busy “being free.”

I sat on the floor, surrounded by unopened mail and lukewarm coffee, and realized something: Adulthood wasn’t freedom from stress—it was just the power to choose your flavor of it.

Should I worry about money? My health? My lack of a backup plan if this job fires me? So many options!

I remember snippets but not enough to warrant writing about it. But I was in a group of girls and we were good, versus a group of guys who were bad. And they kept trying to break us down and idk what our purpose was but it was something. And then one I guess fancied me because I kept finding secret love letters under my duvet and he was begging me to not tell a soul as I was on the wrong side. And there was a bomb going off and that’s all I remember. It was fun! 

I want to build a beautiful handbag collection so much. I suppose I’ve already started. I want fun bags too. And not brand new ones, I want to find good condition second hand ones. I don’t want to spend a stupid amount of money on *bags*, but for example I found a gorgeous second hand prada tote for $740 - amazing? And in pretty decent condition. I don’t mind them being worn looking, I just don’t want tatty or close to tatty. 

I’ve watched sailor moon with M for a lot of today. I still have a weird little crush on mamo/tuxedo mask. We made pancakes with bluebs and bananas and jam and other stuff for her and coffees and a juice and I put some little flowers in a little vase too and it was cute. I like having a friend :) and then we watched SM! I was still feeling flat so I had zero intention of doing much so it was perfect and made me feel a bit better :) 

People are so mean. So when I play my magical cafe game and sometimes there’s an ad when I want extra zaps to play more and anyway one of the ads is for another game about making dragons or idk something like that, but it always makes me so sad because the whole concept of the ad is they make this baby dragon and it hatches and they just brand UGLY BABY on the screen then TRY AGAIN! and then you get a ‘cute’ one and you win. And it makes me sad for this fictional baby dragon that gets rejected and I know how stupid that is, hence why I say it here as opposed to out loud to someone but UGH. WHY BE SO CRUEL? Like when people have ugliest dog competitions :( 

I was looking up ways to store stuff for hobbies when you just have a closet, which I recognise is more room than many but ANYWAY. I came across one and this guy built this little trolley thing for his wife’s hobby stuff!? Is that not so cute! Like all her knitting and crochet bits, colouring pens and books and scrapbooking stuff - or something like that. And he topped up her supplies too where she needed it. And she came home to the surprise and UGH. What a dream. So thoughtful, so much effort, so much time and love put into it. That’s an exaggeration though, it was like a flat pack Kmart bathroom type trolley not some handcrafted woodworked masterpiece but that doesn’t even matter because he still created it for her! So lovely. I hope Andy, or I guess whoever I end up with, will be thoughtful like that. I can’t wait to be that sort of girlfriend myself :) I *live* for that sort of thing, it’s so fun to plan ideas and get it all together and then SURPRISE! But if it’s Andy then not a big surprise because he doesn’t like them, and he knows I don’t either, but a craft trolley is fine. I just hate the thought of surprising me with a last minute holiday or even a dinner out etc, the latter less so but if it was a surprise dinner I would want it to be low key and casual. If he wanted to take me somewhere fancy I would want time to prep and choose what to wear and all of that - not being given that time is probably an indicator my man wouldn’t know me so well. It’s kind of like an engagement ring not being the colour of the jewellery you’d wear, if your potential husband can’t even notice you’re a silver jewellery girl and proposes with gold then I mean how much is he noticing…? It’s such a famous example but it makes sense. I don’t know what colour jewellery I am. I wear gold but I have a sneaking suspicion I suit silver better, but silver makes me think of witches and hippies and gold feels so warm and soft? Hm. I should get some silver jewellery to see what looks better. I’ll just try some of mums I guess. Though she wears both gold and silver. I’d wear both happily, and will, but I feel like everyone has a preference and one that suits them better. Anyway. 

I still feel flat. Flat flat flatttttt. Better than the last couple of days but still not good. At least it’s heading in the right direction. 

I have work and the office tomorrow. I don’t want to work or go to the office. I kind of want to take a sick day. I haven’t taken any yet so far this year and I’ve taken like three annual leave days and I’ve worked unpaid over time often. So. But I also feel guilty. But I also never really get sick so it feels like I miss on paid leave because I have a solid immune system? So no sick leave, no parental leave… I feel like I’m missing out. I know that’s not how it works and it’s silly but this is justification time so sshh. Hm. I think I’ll see how I feel when I wake up. What will I do if I don’t work? I should see if I can go to the GP to get my blood pressure taken, I have to do that apparently before starting my adhd meds as they can increase it so it’s something you’re meant to monitor and knowing my health anxiety I’ll be getting it checked as regularly as they’ll allow me. I could do that. I could maybe spend an hour or two doing my therapy homework, sorting out what I want in life and who I want to be and doing the reflection and planning/mapping etc. I could finish my laundry. I could declutter a bunch of stuff. I could tidy my room. I could just do nothing and read. I could go for a walk. I could meal prep. I could clean (I won’t but I *could*). I could do some research on adhd so I understand it better and also how the meds work because idk and I’ve been avoiding researching it and my psych didn’t explain *anything*. I could do a hobby thing like paint or draw. I could have a nap. I guess I’ll see how I feel in the morning. It makes me sound like I’ve decided and maybe I have but I can’t underestimate my ability to guilt trip myself.

The DNA analysis changed everything. Even Daniels, our religious officer, couldn’t cope. He kept repeating verses from the Bible, whispering that the plant was “Adam’s other rib.”
It’s been a week now, and I haven’t seen him since.

But what really keeps me awake is the 7.7% of the genome that remains undetectable. I’ve never encountered anything like it.
I’ve labeled it MN-0 — the unknown genome.
Whatever it is, it’s the root cause of this… thing. This ""plant.""

I debated with Dr. Wong, who proposed that it might be the mutated remains of an astronaut — a long-lost body warped by cosmic exposure. But that doesn't make sense. There haven’t been any deep-space expeditions for decades, possibly centuries.
I want to dismiss her theory. But the truth is, I don’t know what to believe anymore.

Earlier today, I confronted Gladwin. He’s been a ticking bomb since we brought that thing onboard.
The following conversation is my best recollection:

E: Why do you keep avoiding the lab? And the holding bay?
G: I’ve seen where it leads.
E: What? I need your help here. No one seems to be in their right mind anymore. If we don’t bring stability back to this ship, all of this effort will be for nothing.
G: You don’t understand. You got exposed. You changed.
E: It’s dead. Whatever that thing was — whatever way it had to reach us — it’s gone now.
G: All those roots… it’ll grow through us again.
E: Snap out of it. It’s gone. For good. Please — just level with me here.
G: Maybe you’ll forget. For a while.
E: This isn’t leading me anywhere. We are lost. The captain is broken — and soon, the ship will be too.
G: Stay away from Wong…

I escalated the situation. I punched him.

I’d never hit anyone before. I’ve always been non-confrontational — the kind of person who needed protection.
If I hadn’t been so weak back then, maybe I could’ve saved M.

But in that moment, I felt pushed.
Gladwin was the only one in direct communication with Command. If he went down completely, we’d be severed from Earth.
What was I supposed to do?

In the end, he beat the crap out of me. I’m okay — nothing broken. Just a bruised cheek, a bleeding lip, and a pathetic sense of failure.
I fought a delirious man and lost.

Wong helped patch me up. She didn’t ask what happened. She just hummed while disinfecting the wound.

I was going through the security footage, trying to see if Daniels had ever come out of his chamber.
Nothing from Daniels.

But I found something worse.

I found footage of Wong working late in the lab. In the recording, she never moved her lips — not even once.
That’s… deeply concerning, because the audio captured the same humming.
The same goddamn hum.

We killed that thing. We dissected it. Its parts are still sealed away for future studies. I was sure it was gone.

I know what I have to do next, but it pains me:
I have to put Dr. Wong into lockdown — away from the others — and study her.

Entry 6

It’s funny — I never wrote about my relationship with Dr. Wong. With Jamie…

She was the first person to reach out and talk to me.
Most of the crew members who worked under me felt ""intimidated."" I don’t look like a friendly person.
But Jamie never shied away from people, I guess.

It’s an odd feeling — treating someone like an experiment. Like a hostile creature.
I know she’s scared of planes, even though we’re in space, on a massive ship.
I know she used to be a horse girl.
I know how she takes her coffee — with salt. Says it “enhances the flavor.”

This is the worst time to be thinking about her like this, but I feel guilty.
I know I didn’t cause this — not directly — but I feel… wrong.
Still, I have to keep going.

Today we entered Daniels’ chamber. He’d hanged himself — the first crew member to perish.
We had to dispose of the body. It’s a horrible thing.
I’ve always felt that a person’s body is their final farewell — the last gift for their family, something to bury with what honor they have left.
But protocol is protocol.
If I end up dead, my body will meet the same fate.

We kept his notes.
I’m not religious, and I’m not familiar with theology, but I’ll do what I can to try and understand.
It feels pointless — or outright stupid — to search through the last words of a desperate man.
It’s unlikely I’ll find anything.

The only good news is that Gladwin seems better.
He remembers fragments of what happened during these past few days — or months.
I feel like time is warping around me.

I’m not certain, but I suspect Wong caused Gladwin to become delirious.
Now she’s sealed away in a soundproof observation room.
We can see her through the one-way mirror, but she can’t see us.
That’s probably for the best.

She seems sane. For now.

We’re approaching our next destination — a planet and its moons.
This time, we’ll scout the surface.
Maybe we’ll find something useful.
Or maybe we’ll just find more roots.

Our kids are roughly the same age, and I liked her right away. We just *vibe*. The conversations weren’t all small talk — she shared things with me, personal stuff, and I felt like we had a real connection. Not just weather and potty training. We even text each other regularly, so it felt like it was turning into an actual friendship.

But here’s the thing: we’ve never hung out outside the playground.

I tried. I asked her to grab a drink last winter. She said yes... but then had to cancel because her husband made plans for the whole family. Totally fair, it happens. Then we planned a dinner — but it ended up being someone’s birthday. After that, I stopped asking. It started to feel one-sided, and I didn’t want to keep pushing something that maybe wasn’t mutual.

Still, she keeps saying things like, “We need to have coffee soon,” or “I want to invite you over.” But the invite never actually comes. It’s like this ongoing placeholder that never gets filled. And I don’t want to cling. We go weeks without texting sometimes, and I’m totally fine with that. But then we run into each other at the playground again, and suddenly she’s talking like we’re best friends. “I missed you!” “I love seeing you!” — and I’m standing there, wondering: *Is this real?*

She once told me she’s had fallouts with friends in the past — even her maid of honor — and that she doesn’t know what she’s doing wrong. That stuck with me. Because lately, I’ve started to wonder if other people feel just as uncertain around her as I do.

1m4mec9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1m4mec9/failed_cooking_experience/,Failed cooking experience,"Hi y'all 
I would like to share quite a riveting experience. So today I woke up craving whipped cream in my coffee. But sadly no one in my house uses whipped cream or any cream for that matter. So why not make my own.( I have free time) And couldn't use the whole thing of cream anyway.

Now for a little context, in my house we buy full fat milk boil it and cool it....so a layer of cream forms on top. Later my mother makes butter out of this cream. But this has a quite high fat percentage that is as soon as you whip it it separates.

But I wanted whipped cream so my smartass thought if I just emulsify a certain amount of fat in milk ....i should get the right fat ratio for whipped cream

Got 1 cup warm milk, 1/3rd butter and slowly poured in butter while pulsing the milk with immersion blender.

Left it to chill ....after some time it looked a bit thicker...I thought you I had done it....so went to whip it.

It started to foam up quite a bit but was not getting thicker. I kept whipping and lo and behold I got butter and milk . 

I keep thinking what went wrong... anyways fun experience and got to learn . Would appreciate if anyone could explain ",0,1753010086.0,Cooking,12,0.45,False

Great description by a master of the English language on the pleasure of drinking whiskey.

""As Anselmo swallowed the whiskey he felt a burning in his nose, his eyes and his mouth, and then a happy, comforting warmth in his stomach. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.""

I am now ok that I will never drink whiskey again.  I simply don't drink anymore.  Enjoying a drink of whiskey is in the past for me.  Not in the present and not if the furure.

Maybe it will help others find understanding with their breakup and maybe with themselves.,"Wall of text incoming. Throwaway user because its going to be a emotional post for me. Probably not going to reply.

Had some coffee and started thinking about us again. I broke up with her a week ago after a 5 year long relationship, still very fresh.

Dealt with a lot all of my life, but the losses have really piled on these past 6 years. My mother divorced my diagnosed schizophrenic father when I was \~8, and she moved away when I was 17 leaving me with my older sister. I want to add this because its important context in understanding the why of how I felt in our relationship and to stop feeling so bitter about us.

Now we get into the recent losses. My grandmother passed away in 2021, old age so there was a lot of time to process. She was the glue of my family. She was lovely. My brother passed away fall of 2022. Fentanyl. He lived in Minneapolis, which is where he died at. He was a stoner, ex-military, gym rat type. Not a lot of closure, don't know if it was foul play. A real swift kick in the balls. Also lost 2 pets very traumatically that same year. A lot of grief, that she was never there for emotionally.

She started to be around less and less ever since my brother's passing, i'm talking 7-8 hour nights at the bar on her day off, which I forgave primarily because she worked there, and when she was home, she was usually just disconnected from me entirely. Headset on, listening to TV, vaping, and playing games on her phone. 

Now I see it for what it is. Stimulation overload so she doesn't have to process emotions. Hindsight 20/20.

I am very certain right now that she is entering a rebound relationship with her bar regular. I'm pretty sure of it because of snap map, I know, I shouldn't have looked, but I texted her one night to coordinate on her picking up some of her things after her closing shift at the bar and she never texted back. I was a bit worried, so I checked snap map, and saw her at his house, at 6am, with her battery at like 5%.

Since our breakup ended, I have been doing research into attachment styles, like I said earlier, to find real clarity in the why. I have come to the conclusion that I am anxious attachment. All of these rollercoasters of loss that's beyond my control and grief have led to me having real abandonment trauma. Whenever I felt a rift between us, I was quick to metaphorically cross that emotional bridge to her, and now that I look back on it, she never really did the same.

On to her, and her own attachment style. I can't be 100% positive, because I of course don't live in her mind, nor am I her therapist, but her being kind of a stone wall emotionally this whole time we've been together just cements it further in my mind. I never met her grandmother, but her family, who is mostly fantastic people, told me all about her. She passed away the same year we had started dating, which was 4 years ago. She was a very vindictive, bitter old woman. Very hateful. The type to say you are going to burn in hell for the most minor of things. 

I now believe she is avoidant attachment. The emotional stone wall, the late nights at the bar, it's not just that we drifted apart, but I believe it was fear of that emotional vulnerability and closeness that comes with helping your partner deal with their grief.

At first, I just wanted to take a break from our relationship so I could clear my head of all of this grief, but after seeing her enter a rebound relationship not even a week after, and after a lot of thinking back on our relationship, I think its best if its permanent, or at least indefinite until we both evolve.

If you are lost in the why, and feel like you don't have closure like I did with my relationship, I really recommend looking into attachment styles and the psychology of human relationships. I feel like its helped me a lot with trying to find peace and to stay on track.

Good luck all.

1m4m033,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnyThingUK/comments/1m4m033/the_ultimate_hair_growth_guide_proven_tips_for/,"The Ultimate Hair Growth Guide: Proven Tips for Healthy, Long Hair","Hair isn’t just an aesthetic feature, it reflects your health, personality, and even your lifestyle choices. Whether you dream of long, glossy hair or simply want to keep it strong and vibrant, the journey requires patience, the right care habits, and a solid understanding of what truly works. This guide explores the science of hair growth, debunks persistent myths, and shares practical, research-backed strategies to help you achieve healthier, fuller hair.

# Understanding Hair Growth: The Basics

Hair grows in three main phases:

|Phase|Duration|What Happens|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Anagen|2–7 years|Active growth phase; determines maximum hair length.|
|Catagen|2–3 weeks|Transitional phase where growth slows.|
|Telogen|\~3 months|Resting phase before hair sheds and new growth starts.|

On average, hair grows about **0.5 inches (1.25 cm) per month**, or roughly **6 inches per year**. Genetics largely decide the length of your anagen phase, but diet, stress, scalp health, and daily habits significantly influence your hair’s strength and shine.

# Debunking Hair Care Myths

**Myth 1: Washing hair daily always causes damage**  
In reality, washing frequency depends on your scalp type. Oily scalps might benefit from daily cleansing to prevent clogged follicles. Dry or curly hair may thrive with less frequent washing—every 2–4 days—to preserve natural oils.

**Myth 2: Expensive shampoos are always superior**  
High-end and drugstore shampoos often share similar active ingredients. The key is matching your hair type to the right formulation: sulfate-free products for dry or color-treated hair, purple shampoos for blondes, or clarifying shampoos for oily scalps.

**Myth 3: Sulfates and silicones are always bad**  
Sulfates help deeply cleanse the scalp without inherently causing hair loss. Silicones seal moisture in, add shine, and combat frizz—especially useful in humid climates. Use them thoughtfully, and occasional clarifying will prevent buildup.

# Proven Tips for Faster Growth and Stronger Hair

# 1. Scalp Massage

Boosts blood flow, feeding follicles essential nutrients.  
*How*: Use fingertips or a scalp massager for 5–10 minutes daily, optionally paired with oils like rosemary, shown in studies to be as effective as 2% minoxidil for hair regrowth.

# 2. Scalp Oiling

Feeds your scalp with vitamins and fatty acids.  
*Best oils*:

* **Jamaican black castor oil**: Strengthens roots
* **Coconut oil**: Reduces protein loss
* **Jojoba oil**: Balances oil production
* **Argan oil**: Adds lightweight shine
* **Avocado & olive oils**: Deep hydration

*How*: Warm 1–2 tbsp, massage in, leave for 1–2 hours or overnight, then wash out.

# 3. Capillary Schedule

A Brazilian method to balance moisture, nutrition, and repair:

|Step|Focus|Examples|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Hydration|Moisture|Aloe vera, glycerin masks|
|Nutrition|Oils & nutrients|Coconut, argan, or avocado oil treatments|
|Reconstruction|Protein|Keratin masks, egg yolk & mayo DIY masks|

Repeat weekly or adapt to your hair’s needs.

# 4. Protective Styling & Night Care

* Sleep on silk pillowcases or wear a silk bonnet.
* Never sleep with wet hair.
* Use loose braids or buns, and silk scrunchies to reduce friction.

# 5. DIY Protein Treatments

*Example*: Mix mayonnaise and egg yolks, apply to dry hair for 3–4 hours, then wash. Use weekly at first, then monthly for maintenance.

# 6. Limit Heat & Chemicals

* Air-dry when possible, or use low heat.
* Always apply heat protectant.
* Trim less frequently (every 6–12 months unless you see split ends).
* Use gentle sulfate-free, color-safe products for dyed hair.

# 7. Caffeine Shampoo

Adding a pinch of coffee grounds to your shampoo may stimulate follicle activity, as supported by studies linking caffeine to improved hair growth.

# Tailor Tips to Your Hair Type

|Hair Type|Best Practices|
|:-|:-|
|Oily|Wash daily or every other day; use lightweight oils.|
|Dry|Wash 2–3 times weekly; focus on deep hydration.|

# Lifestyle Factors That Matter

* **Balanced diet**: Protein, zinc, biotin, and omega-3s support hair growth.
* **Hydration**: Drink enough water to keep scalp and strands healthy.
* **Stress management**: Chronic stress can trigger hair shedding.
* **Sleep**: Aim for 7–8 hours nightly to aid cellular repair.

# Advanced & Additional Tips

* **Microneedling**: Can stimulate blood flow; best used with professional advice.
* **Supplements**: Biotin and collagen may help; consult your doctor.
* **Scalp exfoliation**: Remove buildup monthly to keep follicles clear.
* **Avoid overwashing**: Adjust to your scalp’s oil production.

# Key Takeaway

Healthy hair growth isn’t about miracle products—it’s about consistent, gentle care, tailored routines, and a balanced lifestyle. Start small: introduce scalp massages, choose oils that suit your hair, and protect your strands daily. Over months, these habits build the foundation for the long, strong, and healthy hair you want.",1,1753008642.0,AnyThingUK,0,1.0,False

I’m currently looking for my first own espresso machine. I’m located in Germany and I will most likely mostly drink espresso, however I would also like to lern to make some lattes. As milk I prefer plant based alternatives, if this may need to be considered. The machine needs to be good for two persons and I won’t need to pull shots for more than two persons at a time very often (maybe once a month). I plan to make coffee around two to three times a day and will be pulling either a double or two single espressi. Sometimes I might like to go for a second round after I finished the first shot. I do have experience with my dad’s Quick Mill 0835 and will pair my machine with a Niche Zero grinder I already worked with before in combination with the 0835. My current candidates are a Bezzera BZ09, Bezzera BZ10, Lelit Victoria, or Lelit Elizabeth. However, it is pretty difficult for me to decide as I plan to use the machine as long as possible. I’m also a bit concerned about power consumption, thus I do like the Elizabeth‘s ability to turn of the second boiler if no steam is needed. I do look for temperature stability and consistency. I do not want to spend much more than for the BZ10 or Elizabeth, which would be 1100 € at max. Which of the machines would you prefer? I’m also open to any additional suggestions.

1m4ly7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1m4ly7p/advice_on_deal_between_cofounders_i_will_not/,Advice on deal between co-founders (I will not promote),"I’ve seen (and read) posts like these already, but my situation is different than those posts that I’ve read.

I’m a software developer with 9+ years of experience. I’ve been working with this guy for a few years now on some other projects. I got paid for those. Few months ago he came up with a new project (big one - compared to what we previously worked on).

He is a non-technical founder, previously founded one tech company that he successfully runs for 10 years now.

Deal was this: I will develop the product and be paid salary until revenue starts kicking in. Then I’d have profit-share equity and switch to managerial role where I’d only get paid minimum (required by law) salary, and majority of my income would be from that profit-share equity.

We’d look for investors to fund this project, so my salary and every other cost would not go out of his pocket, but from the investment we receive.

He doesn’t want to give me equity in the company, only equity in profit-share. If I ever decide to leave company for any reason, I would lose that profit-share equity, and get no penny from that product/company ever again.
When we were discussing terms of the deal, I did press him and said that I want real equity (not just profit-share) or I won’t be part of it, he did agree on it, but said that with this equity I’m not guaranteed to get paid anything, if the board decides not to pay dividends but to reinvest the money (he’d still have 51%+ equity, so he can decide on his own what to do). 
I then agreed on profit-share only, as I’m just trying to get out of my 9-5 ASAP, my salary would be higher than my current salary, and the profit-share (per projections) would be much, much higher than what my financial goal was at this stage of my life.
This was all just a verbal agreement, over a coffee. We did write it down in our WhatsApp chat and confirmed agreement on it so that we can sign a deal in future when we get investor on board and formally start working on this.

Now I’m rethinking all of this, what I agreed on, and keep thinking that with this deal I’d screw myself up long-term. I wouldn’t have any decision making rights, if I leave company to start another venture, I’d stop receiving money from this. 

His explanation is that he wants to make sure that I don’t leave company after some time, as he doesn’t have a clue about this industry and I have experience working in it, and I’m solid developer (he saw it from our previous collaborations). It’s a fintech product, and he didn’t even know about all the compliance that needs to be done, let alone how it works, etc.

My main questions:
1. Considering everything, is it fair to ask (real) equity when I’ll be receiving salary for my work until revenue starts flowing?
2. I have some connections on my own, and I might get an investor (that was his job) for the company - already having some conversations as I want to get started on this asap. If this happens, is it ok to drop him out of equation if he doesn’t want to agree on my terms, and go on my own with this? He doesn’t bring and technical expertise into this, he was supposed to find investor and run company properly… idea started with him, but he only knew what exactly he wants to do. I had similar idea written down for some time, with much more detail than he shared when pitching his idea to me.",2,1753008439.0,startups,3,1.0,False

I sat on my hard, worn-out couch, chain smoking as I stared at the constant black and white static showing on my ancient television set. I’m so tired but cannot sleep. I can’t remember when I was last able to rest, let alone feel safe or secure in my home. I’m so bored that I hope that something – anything – will happen, but at the same time I’m conflicted, because I know what occurs in this cursed building and all the fear and chaos that comes with it. But, even if I’m experiencing pure terror pulsating through my veins, then at least I’m feeling something…

The noise has stopped at least – the constant banging and scratching on the walls and disembodied voices emanating from the walkways outside of my door. These unnatural sounds are always unsettling and they mean I am never at ease, but somehow the ominous silence is even worse, as I hear nothing but the buzzing static from the TV, reminding me that I’m all alone.

Eventually, I dragged myself up from the couch, my old bones creaking as I slowly walked towards the window and looked out at the empty wasteland beyond. The landscape is lifeless - a desolate hellscape going on for as far as the eye can see, and all is shrouded in darkness.

It is always night here. The building is lit up by flickering strip lights in the corridors and apartments, but the only illumination outside comes from the pale orb in the black sky above – not the sun or the moon, but something else. I can’t remember when I last saw sunlight, blue skies, clouds or any greenery whatsoever - and God, I miss them all. I didn’t know how lucky I was in the old world, in so many respects.

I don’t spend long looking out into the darkness, as I know its dangerous to do so. Several of my neighbours have gone mad after staring into the abyss for too long, as the darkness consumes them and destroys whatever glimmer of hope they have left. And then there are the inhabitants of the outer world – the beasts that stalk the land, their hideous silhouettes barely visible under the dim light of the pale orb, although one can occasionally hear their predatory roars or banshee-like wails in the distance, carrying across the empty plains.

Thankfully, the land beasts rarely approach our isolated building, and even if they did the walls should keep them at bay. The winged beasts from above are a different matter however…

It’s never seriously occurred to me to try to escape from our prison and take my chances in the desert wasteland. Oh, a couple of my neighbours have attempted this, managing to force open windows or cut through the wire mesh above the courtyard. But those few who’ve made it out always return, their eyes wide with terror as they ramble incoherently about monstrosities and horrors beyond all comprehension. Those unfortunate souls will often barricade themselves inside their small apartments, sealing the doors shut and boarding up all the windows. It can be years before they emerge again, if they do at all.

I continued to ponder such terrors when I was shaken back to reality by the crackling sound emanating from my walkie-talkie, my primary means of communication with our cursed community, the neighbours who are my responsibility to supervise and support.

When I lifted the receiver, a dull and emotionless voice told me that the delivery of ‘special items’ had arrived at the front entrance, and I must go down to sign for and collect said items. I felt relieved that at least now I have some purpose to my day, although I dread the chaos that will likely follow the distribution. Nevertheless, this is my job and responsibility, and so I took a final drag on my cigarette before descending to the ground floor.

I opened the first door and came face-to-face with the dead eyes of the deliveryman, his wrinkled face devoid of expression or compassion. I gave up trying to engage this man in conversation a long time ago. In fact, I’m not sure that the deliveryman is even human. Perhaps he’s nothing more than a supernatural drone worker designed for this sole purpose.

Behind the unblinking deliveryman is the second door, sealed tightly shut. I’ve never seen what lies beyond that outer door and I have no desire to do so. Instead, my focus is on the bulky boxed items that I’ll take ownership of and deliver using my trusty sack barrow trolley and our not so reliable old and creaky elevator.

I avoided the deliveryman’s dead eyes as I scribbled my signature on his sheet and began shifting the containers and boxes into the lobby. I have no idea what the point of me signing my name is and can only assume it’s some kind of meaningless bureaucratic ritual designed to further sap my morale. In any event, I quickly transferred the contents into the lobby and shut the door on the zombie-like deliveryman, sighing with relief as I heard him exit through the second door, returning to whatever hellscape lay beyond.

The items took me some time to deliver, as I brought the different sized containers up one-by-one in the elevator. Dr Marshall’s item is always the largest – a heavy ice cooler box filled with…I dread to think. The Doc will empty the cooler box and leave it outside his door for me to collect, while he does whatever he does with its contents.

The other boxes vary in size and weight. I don’t know what’s inside the majority of them and – once again – I’m happy to remain ignorant. I walked the balconies on each floor, looking down at the empty courtyard below and up at the black sky above, glancing warily through the wire mesh secured to the roof of our building. Carefully, I left the boxes on each and every doorstep, but I did not knock on said doors or attempt to interact with the residents inside of the apartments. I would be quite happy to avoid my neighbours for as long as possible but know this is unlikely.

As always, I feel conflicted – as I dread my interactions with the crazies and damned souls who live within this hellish complex, but at the same time yearn for any kind of human contact. Nevertheless, I avoided the others as I finished my deliveries, then returning to my own dark and decrepit apartment alone, as the sweat poured from my skin. There are no seasons in this realm that I can tell, but the temperature is always either uncomfortably hot and humid or bitterly cold. I can only assume that these changes in climate are at the whim of whatever sadistic deity designed this hellish world.

I dropped my own special item on the coffee table, a fresh carton of cigarettes that will allow me to continue my filthy habit. My wife Janet was always nagging me to quit, but in this place chain smoking is the only stress relief I have. Besides, it’s a little late for me to start worrying about lung cancer.

I went straight to my small bathroom, splashing cold water on my face and enjoying some small relief. But then I glanced up and saw the red patch growing on my bathroom ceiling, watching the slow drip of crimson liquid falling into my bathtub. I knew what it was in an instant – blood.

I suppose the natural reaction to seeing blood leaking through one’s ceiling should be disgust and terror, but what I felt in that moment was angry frustration. I stormed back out of my bathroom and grabbed my walkie-talkie from the coffee table, my hand still shaking with fury as I set the frequency and made the call.

“Dr Marshall.” I stated firmly down the line, barely supressing the anger in my voice.

There was a lengthy pause before I received a response, as a surprisingly meek voice broke through the static.

“Yes, can I help?”

“Doctor, I need you to come down here straight away.” I ordered.

“Oh, I see.” the Doc answered, “Okay then, I’ll see you shortly.”

Two minutes later and Dr Marshall was standing in my bathroom, glancing up at the blood stain in my ceiling with a look of mild embarrassment etched across his thin, pasty face. Dr Marshall technically wasn’t a fully qualified MD, although I understand he did attend a couple of years of medical school where he picked up some surgical skills. He used what he’d learnt to indulge his disturbing interests until the authorities caught up with him and he ended up here.

But – as they say – a leopard cannot change its spots, and this is the cause of our current predicament. Dr Marshall isn’t much to look at, being a slight figure with pale skin and a thinning hairline. He speaks in a soft and apologetic tone and seems very unassuming and unthreatening at first glance, but of course there is a dark side to the man that makes him very dangerous. Nevertheless, the Doc knew why he was here and so was immediately on the defensive.

“Oh dear, I must apologise for this mess. All very unfortunate. I’m afraid I let my enthusiasm get the better of me, such is my passion for my work.”

He smiled thinly as he glanced across at me with his killer’s eyes. I avoided his gaze, feeling a cold chill running through me as my discomfort lessened my anger.

“Doc, we agreed that if you were to continue your – experiments – you would make sure to keep the blood and the smell under control. This isn’t the first incident. I have received other complaints.”

There was an annoyance in his voice as he answered. “Well, perhaps you can bill me for the damage?”

It was a facetious question of course. He knew very well that I had no power over him, except for that one thing.

“Doctor Marshall,” I said firmly, “You know very well that your special deliveries come from management, and if they were made aware of these incidents, they may well reconsider this arrangement…Now, you wouldn’t want that Doc, would you?”

I did make eye contact with the man after I finished delivering my thinly veiled threat. I instantly regretted doing so however, as he shot me a murderous glare, and I could imagine what was going through his mind in that moment, as he was surely fantasising about dissecting me inch-by-inch inside of his bathtub. But the Doc was smart enough to know this wasn’t possible.

After a tension-filled pause, his eyes softened, and he spoke in a more conciliatory tone.

“I apologise profusely sir. This will not happen again.”

I didn’t believe him. We’d had this conversation before and no doubt would again, but right then I wanted him out of my apartment and so I accepted his false assurances.

I went on to plaster and paint my bathroom ceiling as a temporary fix before I sat back down on my couch and waited, although for what I could not say. I don’t know how long it was before I received the next call through my walkie-talkie. A noise complaint, about No. 13. That was Mrs Jackson’s apartment, across the walkway from mine. I groaned aloud, dreading the house call that would follow but knowing it was necessary.

Soon after I found myself in Widow Jackson’s front room, sipping tea from the woman’s finest china as I scanned the neatly decorated and immaculately maintained surroundings, with quirky little ornaments set upon carefully dusted shelves, alongside lovingly framed family photographs – reminders of better times.

Mrs Jackson herself sat on the chair opposite me, smiling politely as she offered me a biscuit from a neatly stacked pile on a matching plate. She’s a frail woman with kind eyes and a sweet smile, but the wrinkles on her face told a story, as did the immeasurable sadness behind her gaze. Life had not been kind on Widow Jackson, and she’s paid dearly for her mistakes.

The cosy living room seemed warm and welcoming to the casual observer, but there were subtle signs that something wasn’t right – if you knew where to look for them. At closer glance the family portraits were disturbing. There was Mrs Jackson, her late husband and three children, except the face of the middle child had been scratched out on each and every photograph, replaced by an ominous dark circle. This was Johnny – the black sheep of the family and the only child still with his mother.

The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end as I thought of the padlocked bedroom just yards from where we sat, and I hoped that the door was secure enough to contain the monster within. I smiled faintly after taking a sip of the sweet tea and cleared my throat before bringing up the difficult issue.

“Well Mrs Jackson, I thank you for your hospitality as always, but I’m afraid this isn’t a social call.”

“Oh, I see.” the widow answered, her smile disappearing as her face suddenly dropped.

As if on cue, Johnny began one of his furious tantrums, slamming his fists against the door and walls and screaming like a banshee. The terrible din made my head pound as Mrs Jackson screamed out.

“Johnny! We have a visitor! Behave yourself, damn you!”

I could hear the anger and frustration in her voice and recognised a woman on the edge. Johnny took little notice of his mother’s shouted words, continuing to scream and bang with all the fury in hell until he eventually tired himself out.

With peace temporarily restored, Mrs Jackson looked up at me with tears in her eyes.

“I know they’re a problem…Johnny’s outbursts. But you need to know that I’m doing my best. It’s not fair on him, being locked up in that room all the time.”

I shook my head whilst interjecting. “You know we can’t let him out, not after what happened last time.”

My body shook as the horrifying memories came flooding back. Mrs Jackson surely shared my trauma, as all the colour suddenly drained from her face.

“Oh no!” she exclaimed defensively, “I’m not suggesting that at all. But surely we can make some alterations, to make him more comfortable? And the medicine they send for him…I keep saying the dosage is too low. Can you speak with management sir? You can make them listen, I know you can!”

She was pleading with me, begging for my help. I felt terrible because there was nothing I could do. Management would never agree to her requests, and there was no point even asking them. Still, I couldn’t bear to say no to Widow Jackson, not after everything she’d been through.

“Okay, I’ll talk to them.” I finally replied.

“Thank you sir,” she answered emotionally, “you’re a good man.”

Suddenly, I couldn’t bear to stay in that room, because I knew she was wrong. I wasn’t a good man, far from it. I made my excuses, setting down my mug and heading for the door. But to my surprise, Mrs Jackson jumped up from her chair, placing a firm hand on my arm as she stopped me from leaving.

I turned to face the woman, seeing her eyes now filled with an uncharacteristic intensity. She spoke to me like she’d never done before as the raw emotion seeped through in her words.

“They say he’s a monster…And I know he’s done terrible things. God, I know that better than anyone! But he’s my son…my baby boy. I can’t turn my back on him, not ever. Johnny’s all I’ve got left and I’ve got to protect him. You understand, don’t you sir?”

I felt the tears welling up in my eyes, her words having struck me like a fist to the stomach. I broke free from her grasp, muttering something incoherent before darting to the front door. And as I ran out, I heard Johnny begin yet another furious tantrum, screaming and banging as his mother pleaded for him to stop. I couldn’t deal with this however, instead fleeing like a coward as I retreated to the relative sanctuary of my own apartment.

I dwelt on the encounter with Widow Jackson for some time after, her words repeating in my head as I experienced intense feelings of pain and guilt. Did she know what I’d done? Was she privy to the terrible secret I carried in my broken heart? I suppose none of us are innocent in this place. My train of thought was suddenly interrupted by a ruckus outside of my door, as something big and fast tore along the balcony below. I instinctively jumped up, sensing danger as I grabbed my shotgun from its cabinet and filled my pockets with spare cartridges.

A moment later I was out on the balcony looking down, my weapon in hand as I searched for the threat under the dim strip lights. I saw a figure below who I initially didn’t recognise in the dark, but then the figure called out to me from the courtyard, and I recognised his voice.

“Don’t shoot sir! It’s only me. I’m afraid Cerberus got loose again!”

I rolled my eyes in frustration before replying.

“God damn it, Mr Jones!” I exclaimed, shouting down at my downstairs neighbour. “I thought I told you to keep that beast under control!”

“I know! I’m sorry.” Jones replied, “He’s a good pet really, just a bit boisterous.”

I could’ve laughed at Mr Jones’s flippant statement. Calling Cerberus ‘a bit boisterous’ was like saying Jack the Ripper was ‘a bit naughty’, but it was my responsibility to help bring the beast to heel before it did someone serious harm.

“Where is he?” I demanded impatiently.

“Last time I saw him he was headed for the basement.”

“Fantastic!” I replied sarcastically, shouldering my shotgun and returning to my apartment to retrieve my torch, before I descended in the elevator to join Mr Jones and begin our search.

I slowly made my way through the darkened basement, torch in hand as I surveyed the scene of damage and devastation, observing the shelves and boxes that had been knocked over during Cerberus’s wild rampage. I turned back to Mr Jones, shining the torch to illuminate his face and taking some satisfaction as his old eyes blinked from exposure to the light.

“We best split up to cover more ground.” I said, instantly realising what a bad idea that was.

“Don’t be shooting that damned gun at my boy!” Mr Jones cried.

I scoffed before turning away. Frankly, I doubted the buckshot in my gun would do the beast much harm, even in the unlikely case I could get off a shot. I followed the trail of destruction, my heart beating fast in my chest and my breathing becoming laboured as I nervously scanned the path in front of me, the torch shaking in my hand.

I froze when I heard the low, animalistic growl coming out of the darkness. Instinctively I backed off, only to trip over a discarded box, falling heavily and dropping my gun and torch. The beast recognised my weakened state and charged; its huge frame propelled across the dark void. I felt the immense weight hitting my chest, forcing me back down to the floor. Sharp claws dug into my ribcage, making me scream out in pain and shock.

I heard its jaws snapping just inches from my face, and I closed my eyes, preparing for the worst. But suddenly there was a high-pitched whistle and the beast looked up, releasing me from its death grip and galloping across the basement floor. I warily looked up in time to see the silhouette of Mr Jones standing in front of the basement door with the dim artificial light from the stairwell behind him. The wolf-like form of Cerberus jumped up to meet his master, the beast’s aggressive nature now transformed into friendly obedience as its owner rewarded him with a ‘treat’.

I gathered myself, retrieving my torch and gun before shouting angrily at my neighbour.

“Damn it Jones! That monster almost bit my head clean off! How many times must I tell you – keep him on a leash!”

“Yes, yes.” Mr Jones replied, as he patted his ‘pet’ on the head, “This will be the last time, I promise.”

I rolled my eyes in frustration, knowing he was full of crap but realising there wasn’t a thing I could do about it.

I returned to my apartment and examined my claw wounds in the bathroom mirror. Unsurprisingly, my shirt was ripped to hell but my injuries had already started to heal. This was always the way in this place. Sometimes I wished I would receive a fatal wound that would end my misery once and for all, but I knew there was no chance of this happening. Management wouldn’t let me off the hook so easily. I cleaned myself up and went back to the couch, sitting silently and awaiting the next inevitable emergency.

I don’t know how long it was until I received the next call – an ominous burst of static that came through on my walkie-talkie. I reached out, instinctively knowing it would be something bad.

“Hello?” I began.

“It’s back. You need to get up here. Bring your shotgun.”

My stomach churned upon hearing those words. The caller hadn’t introduced himself but I recognised his voice. Mr Hastings – one of my less troublesome neighbours if I’m honest. Mostly he kept himself to himself, but Hastings had the misfortune of living on the top floor, which put him on the frontline so to speak. His call for help and request for me to bring my gun could only mean one thing – we had a fight on our hands.

I reached the top floor and found Mr Hastings crouched down in the shadows by the stairwell, his trusty crossbow in hand as he looked upwards with an intensity in his dark eyes. He didn’t turn in my direction as I stealthily approached, remaining low and staying as quiet as possible as I joined him, ducking down beside my neighbour as we hid in the shadows.

I knew from past experience that Hastings didn’t scare easily, but when I got up close I saw the sweat pouring from his brow, his knuckles white as he clutched too tight a hold on his weapon. He nodded upwards, drawing my attention to the scene above our heads.

To my horror I saw the dark shape of the beast which had landed on top of the wire mesh, our thin protection against the terrors that ruled the dark skies of this realm. This creature was one such beast – largely the size and shape of a human being but with a vast pair of wings that allowed it to soar like a bird of prey, and with claws and teeth which could easily rip a body to shreds. The harpy-like monster was busily working on the thin cage, diligently tearing away at the wire with its claws in an attempt to break its way through.

The winged monster was making steady progress, and it wouldn’t be long before it forced its way inside. This was something we couldn’t allow to happen. I tried to control my shaking body as I whispered in my companion’s ear, deferring to Mr Hasting’s superior knowledge in this field.

“How do you want to handle this?” I asked.

“We’ve got to outflank it. You cover me and I’ll move along the balcony and hit it from behind.”

I nodded my head, not feeling entirely confident about my neighbour’s plan but knowing I couldn’t offer a better alternative. I watched Hastings move, keeping low and in the shadows whilst barely making a sound. I looked back up at the harpy, my hand still shaking as I grabbed two cartridges from my pocket and carefully loaded them into my shotgun. But the metallic clicking sound alerted the beast to my presence, as suddenly it stopped what it was doing and glared down at me with burning red eyes, snarling as it exposed its fangs in a hideous display.

A terrifying pause ensued as I found myself transfixed, unable to avert my eyes from the beast’s demonic gaze. But then all hell broke loose, as the beast roared with fury, redoubling its efforts as it ripped the wire cage apart, determined to get at me and devour my still warm flesh.

Acting on pure fear and adrenaline, I raised my gun and fired. BOOM. And again…BOOM. The buckshot hit the winged beast, causing it pain and irritation but no serious injury. I desperately plunged my hand back into my pocket to retrieve fresh cartridges, but the harpy was almost in, ready to descend and rip me to shreds.

But suddenly I saw movement in the corner of my eye, spotting a dark figure emerging from the shadows and then a projectile flying through the air at speed. The bolt struck the winged beast in its left leg, and I took a perverse pleasure as it shrieked in pain, unveiling its wings and ascending in a blind panic, flying back up into the dark skies above - defeated and humiliated.

I breathed a sigh of immense relief as I watched the harpy disappear before Mr Hastings came back by my side, the now unloaded crossbow still in his hands. My neighbour looked up at the hole in the wire cage and shook his head.

“More will come. That will need to be fixed.” he said.

I nodded my head, shaking myself back to reality as I dealt with the shock of the last few moments.

“Yes.” I replied solemnly, “I’ll get my ladder and start work on the repairs straight away.”

“Okay.” Hastings answered cooly, before walking down the dimly lit walkway and back towards his apartment, leaving me alone to my work.

It was quiet for a time after the harpy attack, but I didn’t know how long this would last. I needed some relief after all I’d seen and suffered, and so I decided to continue with my secret project, remembering the brief glimpse I’d previously enjoyed which had kept a glimmer of hope alive in my otherwise blackened heart.

After finishing yet another cigarette, I reached for the dial on my TV set, my hand once again shaking – but this time with excited anticipation rather than cold terror. I twisted the dial to tune the device and searched for the channel I yearned for, ignoring the sinister otherworldly images and sounds that appeared on screen and reverberated through the speakers.

Finally, I saw the image I’d been searching for, finely tuning to sharpen the picture – my heart almost jumping out of my chest when I saw her face. My Janet, as beautiful as she was the day I married her, all those long years ago – her long blonde hair, deep blue eyes, and soft, delicate features all remaining unchanged and untainted. But no…she wasn’t the same, not anymore. Her eyes, once filled with passion, joy, and love were now sullen and bloodshot – her expression sorrowful and grief-stricken. And there was something worse…as I realised her heart was filled with a righteous fury.

“Janet,” I whimpered, my emotions getting the better of me, “is that really you?”

Her reply was sharp and brutal, as she snarled at me through the television set.

“What the hell do you want, you bastard?”

I was taken aback, struggling to find the words to respond.

“I…I…want to apologise. To tell you how sorry I am.”

She laughed aloud in open mockery, saying – “You’re sorry? So what? It makes no difference. You know it’s too late for apologies.”

“Look…” I desperately interjected, “I know what I did was…terrible. And you’ve got every right to be angry, Janet. But you’ve got to believe I’ve changed. I don’t expect you to forgive me, but let me see my girls at least…Please! You owe me that much!”

She scoffed in disgust at my heartfelt plea, losing control as she launched into a furious tirade.

“You will never see our children again! What happened to the girls was your fault! We don’t want you in our world…Don’t need you! You can rot in hell for all eternity for all I care!”

My jaw dropped and my whole body trembled uncontrollably as I looked into her hate-filled eyes and felt all my resolve collapsing. And then, suddenly my wife’s face disappeared from the television screen, replaced by an image that brought back buried memories of immense grief and guilt. I saw a graveyard on a lonely hillside, with black-clad, tearful mourners gathered around three coffins, watching solemnly as they were lowered into the waiting graves one-by-one. The first coffin was full-sized, while the other two were notably smaller – designed for children.

The tears were rolling down my cheeks in an unstoppable stream as I reached out to touch the cold screen, but as soon as I did so the image changed again, with a face barely visible through the static. But it wasn’t my wife’s face this time. Instead, I saw a hideous death mask – an inhuman creature with dark, soulless eyes. It opened its mouth to reveal a gaping black hole, emitting a high-pitched scream that forced me to retreat from the TV, recoiling in horror as I covered my ears in a futile attempt to drown out the awful din.

Mercifully, the hellish wailing did not last, as the TV set shut itself off and left me alone in my silent living room, shaken and terrified by what I’d just witnessed. I knew I’d screwed up badly, and there would be consequences. I just didn’t expect it to happen so soon.

I jumped with fright when I heard the ringing, fearfully looking across to the dust-covered, red phone affixed to my living room wall. This phone could not be used for outgoing calls and when it rang this only meant one thing – that the building manager wanted to speak with me.

I slowly walked across the laminate floor and reached out to pick up the receiver, holding it up to my ear as I spoke meekly.

“Hello?” I squeaked.

I expected the familiar voice on the other side to angrily berate me, but instead his tone was surprisingly sympathetic.

“What’s going on buddy?” he enquired calmly.

I felt immense shame and struggled to find the words to justify my actions.

“I messed up…I know I did. I just thought if I could talk to her, I could make her understand.”

“It’s not permitted. You know this. You’re not doing anyone any favours by trying to make contact.”

I shook my head, trying to keep my emotions in check.

“But I’m sorry…so sorry for the mistakes I made! My remorse is genuine, can’t you see that?”

“Oh, I see it.” the manager replied impatiently, “but its not enough. You committed a grave sin and this is your assigned punishment. That’s just the way it is.”

I whimpered, sobbing as I spoke my next words. “How long? How long must I stay in this place?”

“For as long as we say.” came the manager’s uncompromising reply, “You’ll stay and do your job until such time as we consider your punishment is complete. Now, I suggest you be a good warden and quit complaining. Follow the rules my friend…and remember – there are always worse places we can send you. Understood?”

An ice-cold chill ran through me as I considered his sinister words and imagined the grotesque hellscapes which lay beyond our strange little apartment block.

“I understand.” I muttered meekly, as my last resolve melted away.

“Good.” the manager responded before promptly hanging up the phone, leaving me to listen to the ominous dial tone.

And so, this is my story…or at least as much of it as I wish to share with you. I remain trapped here, warden to a bizarre apartment block on the edge of a desolate hellscape. I can’t say exactly where I am but I do know why I’m here, and I realise I deserve my punishment.

Time is difficult to gauge in this realm. Honestly, I don’t know whether the incidents I have described in this account occurred over a day, a week, a month, or even a year. It makes no odds I suppose. This is my existence – my sentence. And I shall continue to carry out my duties as warden, doing what little good I can in the hope that one day I will find redemption.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, my walkie-talkie is buzzing, and I must go to work.

There's a moment of excitement, followed by the quiet dread of your bank balance shrinking.

What if I told you that for the last 60 days, I've turned that feeling into a *win*?

For months, I was shopping like everyone else—leaving money on the table. It's money the big brands are happy to keep. Then I stumbled upon a simple app called **Earnkaro**, and it's become my secret weapon.

In just two months of casual use, I've pocketed an extra **₹1,300**. *(See my earnings screenshot below)*

It's not life-changing money (yet), but it paid for my last two movie tickets, my weekly coffee runs, and a new pair of headphones. All from the shopping I was going to do anyway.

This isn't some complicated ""affiliate marketing"" scheme for tech gurus. This is for the rest of us.

**Why this feels like cheating (but isn't):**

* **Instant Gratification:** The profit hits your UPI directly. No bank transfers, no waiting for a cheque. Just pure cash.
* **Childishly Simple:** If you can copy and paste, you're overqualified. The setup took me less than 5 minutes.
* **The Power Is Yours:** Share a link to a specific product with a friend, or just generate links for your *own* shopping. Either way, you get a cut. You're basically creating your own personal discount on everything.

**Now, let's be real. What's the catch?** I’ll be 100% transparent: it takes 30-45 days for the profit to be confirmed. But think about it – it's money you would have *never seen otherwise*. It’s like finding a ₹500 note in a jacket you haven't worn in a month. A pleasant surprise you forgot was coming.

Every day you shop without this, you're letting corporations keep your cash. Stop making them richer. It's time to claim your cut.

Over the past two years, we’ve come back together every single time I’ve been single, without fail, even though we’ve never even technically been “together”. Even though back when we met we weren’t all that compatible, we still clicked somehow and just kept coming back. We used to be akin to foils of each other, my having a bit too big of an overcompensatory ego and him being a pretentious hipster asshole, but we’re grown into each other.
We at the start had very clear boundaries (set by me) because we were “keeping things casual”. But those devolved recently. This time with him just feels different, and I know that’s naive but is it really? I moved home from college permanently just short of a month ago and had been seeing B two-three times a month whenever I was in town, essentially always but more so since my most recent breakup in May. I don’t know if it’s just been long enough that we are too comfortable with each other, but since then I have fallen for B hard in a way I haven’t before, and I feel like he’s been different too. I’ve been pretty deep with a few guys before, I’ve had the rush and the thrill, but it’s not like that with him at all. Maybe it was about sex when it started, but now we don’t even have sex every time we spend a night together. It’s so comfortable, but we still challenge each other probably a little much for anyone’s good. He fits very category of what I look for in a partner and our dynamic is one that I would happily live for the rest of my life. We’re both quippy and brutally sharp, unironically hipster, and grew up in similar ways, and I know we both have similar goals for down the line, with kids and lifestyle and all of that. I’ve been telling my friends for quite a while that I think I’d marry him if we weren’t going to college on separate sides of the state, but always with the stipulation that I think the reason things were so good was that we knew our time was so limited. I don’t know if that’s true though. He knows so much about me that most people would run for the hills after and he hasn’t. A few weeks ago when I moved home, the first place I went was to his house and when I told him the reason I’d gotten into town so late was that I’d just moved home from the psych ward, he didn’t even bat an eye. I’m prone to emotional freakouts and they don’t faze him. But, he gets touchy when the topic of his other romantic involvements comes up, and I do see him as the type to not want to go to college in a relationship “for the experience”, though he’s never directly confirmed that suspicion. 
B moves about 5 hours away from our hometown to college for the first time in the end of September, and I’ve realized that I am freaking out over it. If the dynamic of our relationship stays the same it has technically been, I know I’ll lose him to a college girlfriend by the time i see him again. Without forced proximity and a lack of options, will I still matter? B used to be the one who always made it pretty clear that this was casual and no feelings, but tonight we had a deep heart to heart on my porch that I never would’ve had with him before. He compared my gripe with him teasing me too much (which we came to understanding about and he apologized for and is all good now), he compared it to when girls hit boys on the playground in grade school because of crushes. He started paying for me when we go out a good portion of the time, he opens my doors, started coming over a lot more often, having me over more often, and comes and hangs out with my girls and I often nowadays. I have two close friends from high school that he separately happened to grow up with and when I got lunch with them recently, he came, which was unexpected because the nature of our relationship is pretty on the down low publicly. It wasn’t overtly mentioned, but we live in a small town and this is essentially a step away from a Facebook status. I bring him coffee to work on mornings after I kept him up too late and none of his coworkers are supposed to see me, I hang out with him and his older brother now, his parents know stuff about me when I see them in passing. Every quick smoke break turns into hours on his porch or mine well into dark. Though not continuous, we are each other’s longest relationship by a landslide on both sides. 
It’s been a long time now since I overtly confessed feelings for B, and I don’t think I can say I ever really have because I didn’t used to feel this way. I’ve seen him 5-6 days in a row now and in the time I haven’t been with him I’ve just been writing about how much it’s going to crush me when he leaves. But I’m scared that if I do say something, I’ll be wrong and the dynamic we have will be destroyed. What if he still just wants cool and casual and I’ve completely misinterpreted the situation? I know there are feelings between us that run deep, that’s undeniable, but I can’t be certain what feelings they are to him. To make a fool of myself after this long and this deep would be irreparable. But, what if he goes to college, gets a girlfriend, and I wonder for the rest of my life what would’ve happened? I am desperate for some insight on the male psyche here. How do you know when a boy wants you for real, what are the signs? How do I know it’s not naivety? How do I know it’s real? If I do tell him how I feel, how do I not scare him off?

TL;DR - My two year on-and-off fling has become something much deeper than a fling  but I don’t know if I should tell him how I feel or not before he moves off to college",1,1753008352.0,relationships,0,1.0,False
1m4lwui,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigambitions/comments/1m4lwui/a_few_tweaks_i_would_recommend/,A few tweaks I would recommend,"1. You should be able to hire marketing execs - Pretty simple, you can hire most other exec types, not being able to hire a marketing manager doesn't really make sense. You should be able to assign each marketing employee 10 companies to manage and then the marketing campaigns are the same, albeit at reduced rates (maybe 25% lower). 

2. Ability to sell businesses - Most of the mechanics are already there, rival businesses are valued based on performance, the players businesses should be too. If you list the business for sale then over 7 days you get a range of offers from rivals some just above, some just below value. Alternatively, there should be a sell now button for cash strapped people that sells the business instantly for 50% of its value. 

3. Areas should have a visible demand for each district - While I am open to slight fluctuations (maybe 10% up or down) over time, I think each district should have a visible demand for items rather than a percentage. For example, Coffee demand is set at 5000 per day, which means there can be 14 Industrial Coffee machines in the district before capacity is hit. 

4. Total traffic should be limited by shop items - Each item in the shop has a number of customers it can service per hour, they can then stack. So, there is no real reason why there is a hard cap on customers for the store. In the 75 and 225 square meter stores you will run out of space before being able to cheese the game. 

5. Anti-cheesing methods - Either update the Interior calculation or create a new 'facilities' score, this will be based on decoration like it currently is. But it should calculate if you are offering all primary products, gives an extra boost for secondary products. Also things like fast food or coffee shops should have a seating capacity per chair, this could be a cap on the store similar to other store capacity limits, or customers could still use the business and takeaway, but with a serious rebuff to satisfaction. 

6. Group businesses - I dont know if anyone remembers, but there was a game years ago called Tycoon City: New York. In that you had the option to group businesses of the same type together. So, say you have 5 fast food stores for burgers, called McDougals, you can create a parent company to manage them. All of the business settings like logos and uniforms, business opening hours etc. will match the rest of the group. There should also be an ability to buy/sell businesses groups all together. 

7. Reputation - Each individual business should have a reputation that boosts the basic traffic index, the point being if satisfaction is very high (95+), then it adds reputation. Reputation then increases the traffic index because customers will come specifically to your store because of the good reputation. Additionally, with group businesses, the collective reputation of the group adds another boost to reputation. The idea with that is brand recognition, a lot of people go to McDonalds purely because they know the brand. 

8. Replace player HQ's with company group HQ's - It will be less convenient and I can't fully articulate why I think this would be better, I just think it would. One of the things about taking over businesses is none of the infrastructure is there, you have to kinda plug them into your business. If each group had their own HQ then when you takeover a group they should have a HQ with staff, logistics setup, supplies and suppliers in place etc. a working business. Whereas now you essentially takeover a fitted store and have to assign HR for those new staff, you have to assign the business to your warehouse, you have to up your purchases etc. If you buy an existing business, this should already be done. 

9. Rivalries should be based on store type not district - Rivalries should work pretty much the same as they are now, but based on business rivalries, not just because you are in the same district. Now, when rivalries are triggered they create a load of businesses the same as yours to kick off a lot of the mechanics. Instead, if someone has a couple of fast food restaurants in a district and you open a couple of fast food restaurants there, that should start the rivalry and the price wars, staff poaching etc. It doesn't make much sense that someone who owns clothing stores and a nightclub start a rivalry with you because you own a gift shop and fast food restaurant. 

10. Nerf/alter headhunters and limit staff supply - I love the way headhunters currently work, but it does make the game very easy when it comes to staffing. Instead there should be a bank of each staff type, like for lawyers for example, you pretty much hit capacity at around 50 per district, so there should be 300 lawyers in the game. Some employed, some unemployed, of all different abilities. When you instruct your headhunter to find staff, they should give you a list of the best lawyers (based on the headhunters ability) both employed and unemployed. 

The game is good and has huge potential, these are just some things I would alter to improve. ",4,1753008293.0,bigambitions,0,0.84,False

1m4lsi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1m4lsi1/does_the_keurig_kmini_coffee_maker_really_deliver/,Does the Keurig K-Mini Coffee Maker Really Deliver for Small Spaces?,"Being someone who needs coffee like a car needs fuel, I set my sights on the Keurig K-Mini Coffee Maker, model K-Mini. This single-serve coffee machine not only promised fresh brews but came wrapped in a compact, stylish design that immediately sparked my interest. After weeks of daily caffeinated adventures, I have some thoughts to share—both the highs and the not-so-highs.

**Compact Design and Space Efficiency**  
The first thing that stood out to me was how slim and sleek this coffee maker is. At less than five inches wide, it fit seamlessly between a few counter essentials in my kitchen. Living in a small apartment means counter space is prized real estate, so I appreciated its compact build right away. The matte black finish added a modern vibe that didn’t clash with my existing appliances. This design isn’t just about looks—it truly shines in tight spaces like dorm rooms, office nooks, and, in my case, a tiny city apartment.

**Ease of Use and Setup**  
Brewing coffee with this machine couldn’t have been simpler. All I had to do was add water to the reservoir, pop in a K-Cup pod, and press the brew button. It took mere minutes, making it ideal for rushed mornings when I was too bleary-eyed to deal with complicated coffee setups. The one-cup reservoir was great for fresh water with every brew, but on mornings when I wanted back-to-back cups, refilling became mildly annoying. Still, simplicity ruled the day here.  

[Check Keurig K-Mini price on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b07gv2s1gs/)

**Performance and Brew Quality**  
I’ll admit I was skeptical about how a petite machine like this would deliver on coffee quality. To my surprise, the taste was consistently fresh and enjoyable, whether I went for a 6-ounce cup or maxed it out at 12 ounces. The brewer’s speed impressed me; the coffee was hot and ready in just a few minutes, perfectly tailored to my impatient personality. I also liked that it worked with a wide range of K-Cup pods, which let me switch from classic morning blends to indulgent hot cocoa on colder evenings. However, it’s worth noting there’s no temperature control here—what you get is consistent, but not customizable heat.  

**Perks**  
- Its size makes it wonderfully portable for small spaces or taking on trips.  
- Cord storage kept my counter looking clean and organized.  
- The removable drip tray easily accommodated my taller travel mug.  

**Limitations**  
- Having to refill the water reservoir every time can be inconvenient.  
- Without temperature control or milk frothing options, it’s no match for coffee lovers who want specialty brews.  
- It lacks advanced features like a display screen or digital clock, which some competing models offer.  

**Portability and Energy Efficiency**  
One standout feature for me was its portability. I managed to lug this thing to the cottage over a weekend, and its lightweight design combined with the cord storage made it so much easier to handle. The auto-off feature was another favorite—after 90 seconds of inactivity, the machine shut itself off. It helped me minimize energy usage without any second thought, which is a win for someone trying to be a little greener.

**Other Options**  
When looking at competing single-serve machines, a few alternatives came to mind. Machines like the Nespresso Essenza Mini or the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew both have their own strengths. The Essenza Mini brings a more European focus on espresso-quality coffee, while the FlexBrew offers dual brewing options for coffee grounds and pods. The K-Mini keeps things simpler, more compact, and budget-friendly in comparison. If someone primarily wants speed and ease for K-Cup pods, this model holds its ground. However, for settings like temperature control or broader coffee customizations, you might find rivals doing better.

**Quality for Price**  
In terms of cost-efficiency, this coffee maker falls in a sweet spot for single-serve machines. Its straightforward design, paired with good performance and low energy consumption, gives real value for those looking to get fresh coffee without spendy bells and whistles. For what it offers—easy use, space-saving design, and decent coffee—it holds its own as a worthy purchase for buyers seeking simplicity and practicality.

I see my friends do the dumbest shit they've ever done out of sheer horniness, and I feel relieved. At least I'll never have to deal with handing my body over to someone only to get physically and metaphorically fucked. Plus, I get to be an impartial third party sometimes. It's cool.

  
However, it is kind of putting a damper on my ability to move out and have a life. I like that I can be satisfied on my own, but sometimes I don't want to be alone. Sometimes I want to get a coffee and share that experience with someone else without having to play Olympic-level schedule Tetris and send three confirmation texts just for that coffee. I haven't even been to a café in months because, in my brain, coffee is an Event and not something I can just do by myself. I can't even think about traveling because running around on my own as a woman isn't exactly safe. I also just have a couple of personal factors that rule out solo travel in general. 



Oh, and I am so fucking jealous of the way allos can just get into relationships instead of having to deal with roommates. I don't have a guaranteed roommate the way allo people in steady relationships do. If I want to move out, I have to just join Facebook groups or stalk roomshare listings and pray that I don't run into an actual sociopath. (So far, no luck. My last roommate locked me out of the apartment three times in six months, so I gave up and moved back with my parents because sleeping in my car was fucking scary). Meanwhile, my best friend is moving out with her girlfriend and having a blast decorating their apartment. I am so happy for her, but I also feel incredibly lame for staying stuck at my parents'. 

  
Speaking of my parents, I've been thinking a lot about what I'll do when they're gone or just too old to be super independent, and I still don't have an answer. They're my only emergency contacts besides my sister. I know my sister will always be there, but she has a life and a boyfriend who she's in a serious relationship with. For all I know, we could end up on opposite sides of the country. I can't totally rely on her, and I can't really rely on getting into a relationship myself either. It sucks. I'm kind of just scared I'll end up getting really sick or something and not being able to deal with it myself. 

  
I know that friends and QPRs exist, but finding other queer people who are chill with that kind of dynamic or even just friends who won't drop off the face of the Earth when they get into a relationship is difficult and draining as hell.

## Key Features Analysis

The modern gold bowl transcends simple aesthetics, boasting a range of features that cater to both practical use and visual appeal.LetS explore the standout elements found in the best gold bowls of 2025.

**Material Purity and Thickness:**
The quality of a gold bowl is directly tied to the purity of the gold used in it's construction. High-end gold bowls typically feature 24k gold plating or solid 18k gold construction. Thicker gold plating or solid gold construction provides durability, prevents denting, and reduces the likelihood of tarnishing. Bowls with a higher gold content are more resistant to corrosion and maintain their luster longer. Ideally,the bowls should also feature a base material that does not react chemically with the gold,such as stainless-steel or a composite alloy to prevent warping.

**Surface finish and Polish:**
The surface finish is a crucial indicator of manufacturing quality. A flawless, mirror-like polish enhances the natural beauty of the gold, reflecting light brilliantly. Gold bowls with exceptional polish are not only visually striking but also easier to clean and maintain. Additionally, some premium bowls feature hand-hammered or textured surfaces, which add depth, visual interest, and a unique tactile experience. The polishing compound used must be gold-safe and non-abrasive to protect the bowl's surface over time.

**Size and capacity:**
the size and capacity of the gold bowl significantly affect its versatility. Smaller bowls,ranging from 4 to 6 inches in diameter,are well-suited for holding jewelry,small trinkets,or single servings. Medium-sized bowls, around 8 to 10 inches, are ideal for serving salads, fruits, or desserts. Large bowls, exceeding 12 inches, make notable centerpieces or can be used as decorative vessels. Consider the bowl's dimensions in relation to your intended use, ensuring it fits comfortably in your hand or on your tabletop. Volume is a vital consideration, to be sure that the bowl can fulfill its functional purpose.

**Design and craftsmanship:**
Modern gold bowls are available in a variety of designs, from minimalist and contemporary to ornate and conventional. The craftsmanship behind a gold bowl can be seen in the precision of its shaping,the seamlessness of its joints,and the intricacy of any decorative elements. Handcrafted pieces frequently enough feature unique details and superior quality, reflecting the skill of the artisan. Consider a design that complements your personal aesthetic and the overall décor of your space. The bowl's curvature, its base design, and any added embellishments contribute to its overall elegance.

**Weight and Stability:**
The weight of a gold bowl, particularly larger ones, contributes to its stability. A heavier bowl is less likely to tip over or slide around, especially when filled with contents. The base of the bowl should be designed to provide maximum stability,whether it is flat,pedestal-shaped,or features a weighted bottom. A stable bowl not only enhances safety but also adds a sense of luxury and quality. This ensures that the bowl feels substantial and secure in your grasp, whether it is a showpiece or serving item.
