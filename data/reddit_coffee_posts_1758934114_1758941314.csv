1nrk6bd,https://www.reddit.com/r/interiordesignideas/comments/1nrk6bd/new_studio_apartment_converted_garage/,New Studio Apartment (converted garage),"Hey all so my GF of 8 years and I recently had a break.  Coincided with the ending of our lease. Hoping to reconcile BUT for now had to find somewhere quick. I found a converted garage studio, which is like half a house. About 500 square feet total.  Has a kitchenette, bathroom, and adjacent bedroom.  I need your help with the living room/office/kitchen/dining areas!  (see photos and floor plan)

I‚Äôm going to have a tv stand/cubby thing, wall mounted tv, a futon, a recliner, coffee table, and possibly a couch if it fits.  Living room area will be top left.  Office with desk and chair top right.  Big kitchen cabinet to the left of the sink.  Kitchen island in front of the kitchenette.  Maybe put some curtains on the garage door itself to help disguise it.  Hanging plants from the rails?  Dining room in the middle of the room?  Help please with ideas!  I have 2 cats who need a place for their tree (I‚Äôm thinking in front of the window so they can get sunlight). Bottom left near the door will be a storage cabinet/closet for tools/vacuum and the cat litter box. Maybe something else too.  Area rugs as well.  Maybe bookshelf by the garage door or between bathroom/fridge. Maybe a curtain over that door in the middle as the door won‚Äôt be used. 

Id like to have a kind of separate living room space, office area, and kitchen area. Will put up photos as well and take the peel on things off the windows to let in more light.

Garage (living room, kitchen, office space) is about 19.5/17 feet with a bit more room in a corner by the door across from the fridge.

Any input or reference pics would be greatly appreciated! Specifically on how to section off the spaces and arrange my living room area.

1nrk3t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/DateEverything/comments/1nrk3t5/fanx_date_everything_panel_answers/,FanX Date Everything Panel Answers!,"I attended the Date Everything panel at FanX, which featured the voice actors for Lyric/Scandalabra/Wallace (Ray Chase), The Hanks/Johnny Splash (Robbie Daymond), Jean Loo/Mikey Transaction (Max Mittelman), Lucinda Lavish (Sarah Natochenny), Mitchell Linn (J. Michael Tatum), and Dunk Shuttlecock (Alejandro Saab)

I thought I‚Äôd share some of the answers they gave during the Q&A! This is mostly from memory so don‚Äôt quote me on anything.

‚ÄúWhat DND Class would your characters be?‚Äù
Jean Loo would not be a bard (too predictable) but rather a necromancer or warlock or something.
Ray: Wallace would be a barbarian and Lyric would be the DM because he likes writing his own stories!
J. Michael: Mitchell Linn wouldn‚Äôt have a class, he would just own a tavern. ‚ÄúMitchell certified npc!‚Äù
Alejandro: Dunk would be a monk, and show up to the first session with a paper that just says ‚ÄúDunk the Monk‚Äù on it and nothing else.

‚ÄúWhich character would you want to realize?‚Äù
Ray: Dishy, because he canonically makes the world better and more efficient
Robbie: ‚ÄúSofia the Safe for my own personal reasons‚Äù
Sarah: Lux, Lucinda or Jean Loo
Alejandro: Maggie
Max: Vaugn Trapp (Ray claims Trapp is canonically the best lover)

‚ÄúFavorite voiceline, either from your character or someone else?‚Äù
Ray: Tony mispronouncing ‚ÄúDate Everything‚Äù in the intro, and Mitchell Linn saying ‚ÄúYou are rude, crude and have a poor attitude, and frankly you smell of low quality beef‚Äù
Bobbie: Vaughn Trapp saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to love you or whatever the fuck!‚Äù
Max: Mikey Transaction doing an extended offscreen monologue in various voices
Alejandro: ‚ÄúOh, sex! Yeah, you meant sex!‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you could turn any object in your house into a dateable what would it be?‚Äù
J. Michael: Has a cool coffee table made out of airplane parts that he ‚Äúwished he could date even before Date Everything‚Äù
Robbie: The safe, again

‚ÄúIf you could add another dateable to the game what would it be?‚Äù
They discussed the concept of having a second bed or coffee maker so there could be a rivalry.

Bonus answers:
-J. Michael Tatum also got to contribute to the soundtrack, they needed a concierto for Keyes and he ‚Äújust happened to have one written already‚Äù
-Ray Chase said they made a huge effort to get a diverse group of voice actors, even making sure that Mac‚Äôs voice actor was a wheelchair user irl
-Vaughn Trapp‚Äôs voice actor apparently ‚Äúimprovised 50% of his lines‚Äù and they had a lot of trouble picking which ones they would keep because they were all gold
-Sarah ‚ÄúLoves when girls are fans of Lucinda‚Äù 
-Alejandro is told often that he gives off the vibes of a supportive jock even though he isn‚Äôt actually into sports

1nrk238,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_slenderman_goose/comments/1nrk238/dirt_pt_6/,Dirt - Pt 6,"¬†¬†¬†A lifetime later, I awoke to see a jackrabbit crouched on my chest. It was strangely light for something so large, as though its insides had been hollowed out and all that remained on top of me was grey-brown fur and those amber eyes that, despite the absence of visible white, looked all too human. It was gone in the time between a blink and a deep breath; another visiting omen. This time, I knew I had to listen, because this was evolution at its core. This was nature saying ‚Äúadapt, lest your body be turned into a beacon to ward away the pestilence of ants and birds of prey‚Äù. The rabbit‚Äôs eyes had been so bright, that for a moment, they had fooled my own into believing that it might be daytime, but when I finally blinked and turned them toward the clock, its hands only read 2:22 AM. An entire ocean of memories had passed in a little over two hours, and now, years after my journey to the desert, my body felt every moment of it, as if I‚Äôd physically lived it all over again.

My head throbbed, demanding something to take the edge off, so I got unsteadily to my feet and headed once more into the kitchen. As I poured myself a fresh mug of coffee and stirred in a few splashes of whiskey, I took note of the voices outside. They had quieted down to nothing but a faint murmure, as if they were discussing something they didn‚Äôt want to share with me. Their hesitance unnerved me. These were not cautious creatures, and I almost wished that Jojo‚Äôs would come back and talk to me again, like he did earlier. I spoke out loud then. I knew my voice was not a weapon that they wished to claim for their arsenal, and even if it was, they could have it. I was no longer afraid of whatever forms they would twist it into.¬†

‚ÄúHey Jojo,‚Äù I called out. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt call. I don‚Äôt really hold anything against you, and I hope that when your time ran out, it was peaceful.‚Äù Acknowledging that Jojo was dead lifted something from my spirit. I always knew he didn‚Äôt belong in this world. He was too mysterious, he felt too much, and there was always just a bit too much laughter in those obsidian eyes. There was nothing for him here, so I hoped that wherever he was, he was spouting poetry and laughing maniacally and swaying back and forth to the song of the windchimes. I hoped he didn‚Äôt have to run anymore. I heard a faint tap on the kitchen window, and my body tensed, but whatever was out there made no more attempts at entry. Even the others fell completely silent. I was alone at the center of the universe and yet, I felt less lonely than ever before. The clouds above me were lifting, but somewhere along the edge of my sight, I saw lightning flash, and fear came flooding back. The rain came flooding back, too. Biblical levels of it slammed against my roof, shaking the house to its very foundations and reigniting the agony that burned behind my eyes. I think I might have yelled something, maybe a cry for my mother to come rescue me, or a plea for God to stop the storm. I was sure it would eat away at the house, the final line separating me from my world and the empty, dark world of the midnight monsoon, and carrying me away like Noah in the arc. Only except for bright and beautiful animals to surround me, I would only be left with bones and skin and bloody fur.¬†

I tried to keep myself calm, but the hesitance of the voices was sending continuous chills up and down my spine until I felt like a beast with its hackles raised. I could smell the rain as it soaked through the ceiling. I could smell a fight. Slowly, methodically, I went into the living room and retrieved my gun from where I‚Äôd left it on the floor when I fell asleep. My fingers extended, barely brushing the grip.

‚ÄúDrop it.‚Äù Sadie‚Äôs voice was back, harsher this time and snapping at me from the space behind my eyes. I whirled around, expecting to see the front door banging open in the wind and one of my tormentors glowering before me, but my house was secure. Nothing had slipped through the cracks. Inhaling shakily, I replied. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

At that, the voices outside seemingly found a renewed sense of gusto, and for the first time ever, they spoke to me in my own voice.¬†

‚ÄúThe last night,‚Äù they chanted gleefully. ‚ÄúThe final storm.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe last night? Am I going to die?‚Äù

‚ÄúDrown,‚Äù I giggled back from the other side of the wall, voice multiplied a thousand times. ‚ÄúLet the roof cave in and try to escape.‚Äù

I grit my teeth so hard I thought I could feel them crack. ‚ÄúWhat do you want? My fear, right? Or is it my soul?‚Äù¬†

They laughed at me, and at that moment, I was blindly, brilliantly angry; not at the beasts of the night who had tormented me relentlessly every summer, not at Jojo for leaving me out here with no idea what was to come, but at myself, for having been cowardly enough to run away from all the good things I had, and stupid enough to find myself here. I had been presented with a million outs; a million outcomes, and I had stayed with the blazing sun and the lifeless earth and the gleeful things outside and my own self pity. This was never my home, and it never should have been, and at that moment, I knew that there was only one outcome moving forward.¬†

The metal of the deadbolts was ice cold against my skin as I slid and pulled them. Chains rattled, and wood creaked. I felt like a contortionist unraveling my body from itself; my heavy body made of rubber that twisted and created uncomfortable and unnatural shapes. With hands that trembled like leaves and lungs that seemed to have forgotten how to breathe, my fingers rested on the doorknob. The voices screamed in an uproar of laughter. What was I thinking? I was going to let them in. What would they do to me when they got here?¬†

¬†‚ÄúDon‚Äôt run.‚Äù Once again, her voice sounded so close that she could have been speaking in my ear. This time, I didn‚Äôt flinch or turn around. *No more running.* Instead, I twisted the knob and let the door swing open into that dark, hungry night.

When I was a kid, maybe eight or nine years old, my uncle Jack took me on a Swordfishing trip off the coast of southern California. For a little boy who had spent his entire life in a landlocked state, it was practically a dream come true. The day we were supposed to set out on the boat, the sky was open and it was pouring rain, a direct contradiction to the sunny, boat-friendly weather the newspaper had promised us. I remember standing on the dock, shivering as uncle Jack got the boat ready. I was confused, why would we bother going fishing when it was raining this hard? I was scared that the boat would capsize, and that we would be at the mercy of an Ocean I knew nothing about, but uncle Jack insisted that we would be alright. The boat would be just fine, and we would be too. Besides, we would be like real pirates, sailing into a storm. I conceded a bit at that. I wanted to be a pirate.

Despite my uncle‚Äôs best intentions, we didn‚Äôt make it more than three hundred yards from the dock when something went wrong. I stood on a crate or a brick or something, craning my upper body out over the railing because I swore I saw something under the water‚Äôs surface. I thought it was a swordfish, and that it was probably the biggest in the sea. I was trying to point it out to uncle Jack, but the crate or brick was a little too high, I was a little too far over the rail, and he was a little too far away to snatch the back of my shirt before I plummeted over the side. Thank god, I knew how to swim and I was good at it, so I couldn‚Äôt have been beneath the surface for more than seven seconds, but it felt like years. My body hit the surface like an ice cube smashing into concrete, flying a million different directions. My limbs were tangled, my sinuses were on fire from an inhale full of water I didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd taken. I tried to open my eyes, but the cold paralyzed them and glued them shut. The cold was the worst part. It was the kind of cold that could kill sailors, strangely cold for southern California in May, and within those seven seconds of paralysis, it fully convinced me that I would never feel warmth again.

Of course, when I was brought back aboard and given blankets and coffee for the first time in my life, I warmed up pretty quickly. Now, with the rain slamming down on me, five hundred miles away from any ocean, I wasn‚Äôt so sure. I immediately squeezed my eyes shut against the burning cold of the drops, but it was no use. They still stung through the skin of my eyelids. Despite the pain, I refused to look out into the darkness and whatever may inhabit it. I was expecting hands, hundreds of them, grabbing for my body and tearing at my skin, dragging me off to become one of them, but what I felt instead was humid, warm air wrapping my body in a cocoon that starkly contrasted the strange chill present throughout my house.

I raised my arms horizontally to balance my quivering body, and stepped onto the porch. The door behind me slammed shut with such force, it sent me staggering forward and I crashed down the steps, my palms meeting the sodden earth with a stinging smack. Fear clawed its way up from my stomach and into my throat, and I clamped my lips against the rising bile. Somewhere very close to my right, a woman screamed. My body shuddered, ears nearly exploding not only from the proximity and volume of the scream, but from the pure rage it exuded. It made me want to curl into a ball and beg for mercy, but I kept my head low, jaw locked, and eyes closed as I began to crawl through the mud, away from the house. All around me I heard footsteps and the whooshing of air that accompanies someone‚Äôs limbs moving extremely fast. Each and every time, I braced for some kind of terrible impact, but each and every time, they stopped just before they made contact with my body. Eventually, I stopped flinching, even when I shuffled headfirst into a thorny patch of brush, and when a man‚Äôs voice bellowed and gurgled in my ear and I could feel his breath on my neck.

Eventually, the crown of my head brushed something impenetrable and I lifted a mud caked palm to feel the surface. It was a rock, probably one of the big ones that lay around the yard. I shifted so that my back was pressed against it, and pulled my knees to my chest, lying on my side in the mud. A terrible scratchy scrabbling sound began then, like a million lizards scuttling up the rock. I knew they wouldn‚Äôt touch me, but their proximity, and the ferocity of their movements paralyzed me. This was the jackrabbit and the coyote pack; my final test. *Persevere, and give yourself grace.* I could be scared, but I had to keep going. ""Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me."" The words left me before I could give them a second thought. Who was God to me? Where had he been all this time? I knew he wasn‚Äôt there, nor did he care about what befell me, and I was certainly owed no forgiveness, but I said the words anyway, the same words my mother had spoken with her final breaths, alone in her hospital bed without me beside her.

‚ÄúI will fear no evil.‚Äù I murmured. The moment I finally opened my eyes, the rain seemed to stall, as if an invisible umbrella had opened above my head. For that split second of clarity, I was floored at what I saw; at the sheer lack of everything. I was in a void. It was not darkness, but sheer absence of light. It was not silence, but the sheer absence of sound. It was the space before birth and after death. Then, I blinked, and the rain slammed into me, driving my weakened form farther into the clutches of the earth. Several hundred yards away, my house stood, windows glowing warmly through the downpour. The rain was warm, and the night was quiet, apart from the drops hitting the ground and the far off chirping of crickets, whose song I hadn‚Äôt realized I loved before now. Shakily, I got to my feet, trying in vain to wipe some of the mud from my hands, but it was pointless. I took one shuffling step forward after another until I was close enough to the house to make out the outline of my coffee mugs sitting on the kitchen windowsill. Then, lightning came down, blasting the ground in front of me wide open with its jagged, sparking body. I tripped and stumbled, and before I could catch myself, I careened into the blackness. My first thought was that this fissure would undoubtedly lead straight down to hell. My second was how glad I was that Sadie would get to live and die without ever seeing my face again.

1nrk0n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_slenderman_goose/comments/1nrk0n9/dirt_pt_4/,Dirt - Pt 4,"The morning dawned gray and lifeless, like an orange juiced and left in the dark to rot. The first thing I did when I worked up the courage to leave the closet was stumble into the bathroom and vomit. The poison that rose with the rain seemed to be leeching its way through the walls and floors a little more each night, flooding around me and turning the inside of my body to acid. Breakfast was not an option, so I sat in the armchair and mindlessly pulled Jojo‚Äôs note from its place in the side table. I wasn‚Äôt sure what I was looking for anymore, maybe a hidden message written in invisible ink, assuring me that all of this would be over soon, that there was something in the water and that I‚Äôd snap out of it? My eyes crossed and uncrossed, focused and unfocused as the white of the paper and the blue of the lines blurred together. My hands shook, rattling the page. Suddenly, a soft sound made my head jerk up, like weight shifting from foot to foot right outside my front door. In that instant, I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that the horrors had persisted through the night; that the sun had failed to burn them away, and now they were coming for me in daylight.

	I was reaching for something, and then my right hand once again formed a rock solid grip around Pearlino. There was a vague aching sensation in my knees as I became airborne, flying to the door and hurling it open. There was no pause, no aiming, and no moment of confirmation to see what lay on the other side. The gun fired, sending a twinge of pain up my trigger finger, and my entire body went rigid as a stone. It was only when I looked down and saw the mangled body of the Jackrabbit, lying in a pool of blood on my porch, that I felt like I could breathe again. It was impressively large, even without its head and it might once have been beautiful before all of the blood; before it trespassed. I watched in a sort of numb satisfaction as the greyish brown fur of its chest and side darkened into crimson and became overtaken by the molasses-like ooze. As I stepped back into the house, I tried not to think too hard about the little rabbit teeth and little rabbit bone fragments plastered across my porch, slowly sinking into the wood and making it rot. As I went, my vision sharpened for a moment. The front door; the door that had withstood all the barrages of scratching and pounding and terror was utterly pristine. Not a mark was present on its face, no signs of damage or assault.

	I should have recognized that rabbit as the omen that it was. After all, the desert was Earth‚Äôs greatest teacher. It taught its inhabitants how to adapt, and that if they failed to do so they would die and be baked in the sun along with the cracked and barren earth. The desert was trying to teach me a lesson, to warn me that the next time I opened my door for it, I perhaps would not be so lucky, and what was on the other side would perhaps not be so easy to kill. Who was I to shoot that rabbit anyway? As I sat in my armchair I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if it had babies waiting back in its burrow. What would they think about their parent taking off, never to return? Who even knew if rabbits had thoughts like that. I tried to pull my mind in a different direction. I‚Äôd heard the phone ringing the night before, but there was only one person who ever called me, and the last thing on earth that I wanted at that moment was to hear his voice.¬†

The phone eyed me like a priest all day long, and I wanted nothing more than to avoid the confessional. I tried to distract myself by getting things together; making coffee, cleaning the kitchen, and trying to press every wrinkle from my blankets as I made my bed that had been rumpled for who knew how long, but at the end of it all, it still hung, guilting and unsympathetic to my excuses. I was afraid to pick it up; to hear the voice of someone I couldn‚Äôt see. Right alongside the fear came shame. I was a grown man, terrified of picking up the phone, and that knowledge finally pushed me hard enough to lurch into the hallway and lift it to my ear, pressing the button for messages.

*You have‚Ä¶* **one‚Ä¶** *new message.* Droned the phone. My chest tightened, and I steeled myself for what I knew was coming.¬†

‚ÄúHey Bailey, it‚Äôs me. It‚Äôs about‚Ä¶ 2:30 AM and I was just calling to check in on you, and see how it‚Äôs going over there. I can imagine that talking to me isn‚Äôt quite at the top of your list of things to do right now, but if there‚Äôs trouble, you can always call. That said, if you won‚Äôt let me be an ear, then I need you to know that there‚Äôs not much I can do for you out there. It‚Äôs up to you now. I hope the sun rises on you soon enough.‚Äù Each one of Jojo‚Äôs sentences was punctuated by deep, scratchy inhalations, and occasional coughs that were loud enough to make the phone vibrate in my white-knuckled grasp. Without thinking, my hands found purchase on the plastic base of the phone and with a quick wrench, it separated from its place on the wall and clattered onto the ground at my feet, bits of drywall raining down across my feet, cord coiled in a heap like a freshly decapitated rattlesnake. I didn‚Äôt need Jojo‚Äôs help. I didn‚Äôt want to hear his voice, so calm and condescending and full of poetry I didn‚Äôt understand. He knew nothing about me.

For days thereafter, I sat inside waiting. For the rain, for something to speak to me, for Jojo to call, even though I knew I wouldn‚Äôt hear it. I wouldn‚Äôt even pick up even if I could. A monsoon seemed impossible, as the sun was blinding through the open shutters and the sky outside was a bright, merciful blue. Eventually though, it darkened, as I knew it would, and I was back to phase one, gripping my gun and cowering under my covers in bed like a frightened child. The voices seemed subdued somehow. Night after night, they gently tapped on the door and tried the shutters almost politely, as if they were apologizing for their previous misconduct. Night after night, I repeated, *persevere and give yourself grace,* and eventually, I came to realize the truth I‚Äôd been trying to avoid from the beginning. Whatever was knocking on my door wasn't human. None of them were.¬†

  
  


One afternoon, I stood at the kitchen sink washing the dishes. I hadn‚Äôt been eating much, and the plate and fork I‚Äôd used didn‚Äôt need to be scrubbed, rinsed, and dried seven times, but there I was doing it anyway. My vision was blurry, the clouds forming gray patches of shadow on the ground outside the window. A faint wind shook the brush. I realized I‚Äôd been staring so long that my eyes burned, stinging worse each time I let my eyes fall in a slow, languid blink. I allowed them to shut one more time, almost in slow motion, and when they opened, the sky outside the window was pitch black and I could hear the faint sound of rain tapping on the roof.¬†

I allowed myself three deep breaths before the panic set in, and I sprang over to the front door. Just as I slid the deadbolt closed, a violent force on the other side slammed into the wood, rattling the chain and wiggling the handle, and sending me stumbling backwards.¬†

	‚ÄúYou‚Äôre no adventurer, and you‚Äôre certainly no fool,‚Äù My uncle was back, speaking more lines from our final conversation. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be stupid about this.‚Äù¬†

	In response, I raced to the kitchen window and yanked the curtains closed, but just before the fabric came together and blotted out the darkness, my eyes lifted from the floor and gazed through the glass. I don‚Äôt know what I was hoping to see, but my breath caught in my chest. Nothing stared back at me.¬†

	‚ÄúBailey,‚Äù my uncle barked, landing three sharp smacks on the door. ‚ÄúThink about your mother. Are you trying to kill her faster?‚Äù My blood chilled when I realized those weren‚Äôt my uncle‚Äôs words; whatever had stolen his voice was speaking on its own now, and it sounded angry.

I stood trembling, wishing he would give up on me, but at the mention of my mother, something shifted inside me. Even though I knew it was probably suicide, I spoke back to the voice.

	‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt kill her.‚Äù

	‚ÄúNo? You certainly didn‚Äôt help her survive, either.‚Äù¬†

	‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I managed.

	‚ÄúYou‚Äôd like to believe you had nothing to do with her death, but we both know that‚Äôs a load of bullshit.‚Äù

	‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt kill her!‚Äù I shouted, lurching forward and banging my own fist against the door.

	‚ÄúDon‚Äôt believe me? Fine. She can tell you herself.‚Äù

	I didn‚Äôt know what that meant, not until something outside on the porch shifted and a gentle tapping sounded on the door. By the time I understood the situation fully, the only thought I could form was, *I‚Äôm not ready.*¬†

	‚ÄúBailey, honey? Come on, no more of this now.‚Äù It was definitely my mother, or at least it sounded just like her, before sickness stole the gentleness from her voice and the meat from her bones; before I‚Äôd stopped visiting. Everything about the voice was a perfect, flawless reincarnation, right down to the light emphasis she placed on the o‚Äôs in each word, which I always thought made her voice sound more like a cooing dove than a human. I recoiled from the door as if it had burnt my hand.

	‚ÄúUncle Jack is right, you know,‚Äù She said sadly. I tried frantically to remember when she may have said that to me, but I had no memory of the last time we spoke. All I knew is that I hadn‚Äôt said goodbye. ‚ÄúYou killed me. You‚Äôre the one who did me in, no doubt about it.‚Äù The tears came all at once, flowing from my eyes in a blazing torrent.¬†

	‚ÄúMom?‚Äù My tone was begging. I needed it to be her, and for all her words to be lies. I needed it like oxygen.

	‚ÄúI stopped being your mother when you left me to die.‚Äù The voice spat, suddenly hollow and wispy, like wind blowing through a canyon.¬†

I staggered backwards, and the backs of my knees found the couch. Collapsing sideways, I pulled my knees to my chest as my tears threatened to drown me. Each time I blinked, I was assaulted by images of nightmarish apparitions with my mother‚Äôs face; twisted bodies and disfigured limbs, hairless heads and bloodshot eyes and mouths full of bile, tubes and metal and sterile plastic. There was no group ambush tonight, only the voice of my mother begging me to let her inside, that she was cold and scared and wanted to see her boy, and that her head hurt. Each of her occasional gentle taps on the door wracked my body with the pain of a gunshot wound to the head. I wished for millions of them to tear my house apart stone by stone, to force their way inside and dismantle my body as well. At least then I would finally face retribution. At least I wouldn‚Äôt have ears to hear her anymore. I felt my eyes roll up in my head, my vision went dark, and I cried for my mother.

	I was sick of passing out. I wanted unconsciousness to come at will, not be forced by my own hand or come about as an unfortunate side effect of pure terror and distress. Nevertheless, I awoke on my bathroom floor the morning after my mother visited me, dizzy, groggy, and unsure of how I‚Äôd ended up there. I sat up, my head throbbing, and when I glanced down at the tile of the floor, I was greeted by streaks of blood. I must have fallen and hit my head. A quick press of my fingertips to my temple confirmed it, and I winced at the tenderness. After what felt like hours, I finally gathered the strength to haul myself to my feet and stumble into the hall, but I was quickly brought to my knees once again by the memories from the previous night. Fresh tears pricked my eyes and I was considering the possibility of just lying back on the bathroom floor and giving up completely. I allowed myself to sob pathetically, before eventually standing shakily once again and pouring myself a glass of water.

	In some ways, everything got easier from that point on. The desert saw a dry spell that lasted for a couple of weeks, which should have brought relief, but what it brought instead was a feeling of resignation; the knowledge that the rains would come again, and that when they did, the air would come alive with voices. *Nothing can be worse than mom.* That was my mantra, the thing I kept repeating to myself when the monotony of the days got to me and I started thinking too hard about what horrors the monsoons might dredge up from the earth. I‚Äôd survived the most heinous thing that could be thrown at me, I was sure of it. All I had to do now was keep myself sane. I set about making preparations, and despite the unforgiving heat of the sun, I spent hours outside, securing my shutters with extra nails and walking laps around the house in search of cracks, dents or points of weakness. Logically, I knew they couldn‚Äôt get in. Jojo had told me so, but doing this made me feel better, like I was doing something to fight back against my fate, whatever it may be.

Like everything else in the desert, the dry spell died. It was killed in the night by thick, angry stormclouds and it seemed that nothing could bring it back to life. Night after night they visited me, and each time I paid them less mind. I didn‚Äôt speak, didn‚Äôt knock back, didn‚Äôt even breathe louder than I dared. That made them angry all over again. Most nights, my mother was at the forefront of their assault, each word venomous and full of blame; nothing but a punishment, I knew, for not letting them inside, and yet it felt like a punishment for everything else. The pain was indescribable.¬† I don‚Äôt know exactly how long I stayed in this strange state of limbo, but every night they grew angrier and angrier, and every night I took triple my dose of Ambien, and dug myself deeper and deeper into disillusionment and numbness.¬†

I don‚Äôt remember a lot from this time period, and I probably caused some sort of damage to my brain. Most mornings I would awake to bouts of vomiting and intense headaches, and for a while I was all but bed bound, too weak to get to my feet or do anything else besides lie in bed and listen to the voices surrounding me. My body was glued to the bed, cemented in place by something between exhaustion and paralysis. I wasn‚Äôt afraid anymore, just so unbelievably tired. I had to force myself to do things that my body should have been doing on its own; blinking, breathing, and occasionally wiggling my fingers just to make sure they still worked. The voices also began to creep their way into the waking hours, whispering and murmuring just loud enough to make my eyes dance around the room in search of the source.¬†

I had a lot of dreams about what the entities tormenting me might look like. In every one I was chasing them through the desert, but each time, I was chasing something different. Once, it was a shadowy figure with glowing eyes that vanished when I finally caught up to it. Another time it was a ball of white light, and as I ran it blew bursts of cold wind into my face. When I tried to catch that one, it laughed at me, and the wind grew steadily louder and louder until I felt something deep inside my ears explode. There were many other variations, but somehow I knew that none of them waited for me outside the walls of the house. That thought, that overwhelming uncertainty of it all was what made me finally get to my feet and shamble forward. Despite the aching in my knees and the throbbing in my head, my mind was, for the first time in what felt like years, clear.

Early on she mentioned she had a boyfriend, so for the first few months I didn‚Äôt think much of it and just kept things casual. Over time though, I started to catch feelings. I didn‚Äôt act on them since she was taken, but we got pretty close ‚Äî talking nearly every day, grabbing coffee regularly, and having deeper conversations about what we look for in a partner and how we connect with people.

After more than a year of this, it seemed like there was something between us. She would give me a lot of attention, even in group settings, and I couldn‚Äôt help but feel conflicted. Part of me wanted to respect her relationship, but another part of me felt frustrated that nothing was changing.

Eventually I decided I needed clarity. Around that time I started casually seeing someone else, partly to move on, partly to signal that I couldn‚Äôt just sit in limbo. Not long after, I told my friend directly that I couldn‚Äôt keep doing the in-between thing ‚Äî either she wanted something more, or we had to stop being close. She admitted she‚Äôd had feelings for me but thought I didn‚Äôt feel the same. I told her she needed to make up her mind, and that was the breaking point ‚Äî we stopped being in touch.

Now I‚Äôm torn. On one hand, I understand why she might not have been ready to leave her relationship. On the other, I feel like if she knew how we both felt, she should‚Äôve acted sooner.

1nrjzpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/seogrowth/comments/1nrjzpe/some_differences_between_seo_and_aeogeoaivo/,Some differences between SEO and AEO/GEO/AIVO,"We have seen so many posts saying AEO/GEO is totally different from SEO and that SEO is all you need to do for AEO/GEO.

Semantic SEO is table stakes and likely the most important thing you can do but there are also differences - especially if you are thinking about appearing in ChatGPT.

We posted the following on our RivalSee blog  and copying here.

# 1. AIs Use Longer-Tail Keywords in Searches

Human search queries are often short, averaging 3-4 keywords. In contrast, when making web searches, AI models like ChatGPT search 5-10 highly specific, descriptive queries that can be 8-12 keywords long as part of a fan-out strategy.

¬†Instead of just focusing on smaller 3-4 keyword searches, content must also be optimized for these detailed long-tail 8-12 keywords and questions to be surfaced by AI.  This can be accomplished with entity/term optimization but going after the specific keywords that the AIs keep using can give an advantage.

# 2. Unlinked Brand Mentions Carry New Weight

For years, the do-follow backlink has been the primary goal of off-page SEO. In the AEO landscape, unlinked brand mentions on reputable sites, forums, and communities are powerful signals. Whereas brand mentions were not useful for standard search, LLMs ingests mentions to understand a brand‚Äôs authority and place in the market.

Mentions - even without links - matter. A robust digital PR and community engagement strategy is now a crucial component of discoverability.

# 3. Bottom-Funnel Content Is Credited More Often

Broad, top-of-funnel (ToFu) content used to be a great technique to generate site-clicks and brand awareness. For AI Chats, this ToFu content is now read and summarized by the LLMs without any attribution. Bottom-of-funnel (BoFu) content, which is evaluative in nature (e.g., ‚ÄúTop 10‚Äù lists, ‚ÄúBrand vs. Brand‚Äù comparisons), is far more likely to result in brand mentions and links.

¬†Prioritize creating unique, high-value MoFu and BoFu content, as AI is more inclined to mention your brand at this stage than for simple how to and top of funnel content.

# 4. Bing Optimization Is No Longer Optional

While Google dominates human search, recent studies have shown OpenAI now uses a combination of Bing and Google search as part of its realtime web-search results. OpenAI‚Äôs use of Bing will likely stay or even increase given Google‚Äôs Gemini is a direct competitor to ChatGpt. Many companies still neglect Bing, creating a significant opportunity for those who invest in the platform.

Actively optimize for Bing results using the Bing Site Webmaster and techniques that no longer work in Google like exact-match keywords and cross-linking.

# 5. Being in the Top 10 Matters, Not Just #1

Traditional SEO follows a power law where the #1 ranking captures the lion‚Äôs share of clicks. This model is flattening. AI engines typically ingest and synthesize information from the entire first page of results (often the top 8-10 links).

The strategic goal shifts from winner take all with the #1 spot to consistently appearing in the top 5-10 ‚Äúconsideration set‚Äù for a cluster of relevant topics.

# 6. Content Must Be Accessible Without JavaScript

Google‚Äôs crawlers are sophisticated at rendering JavaScript-dependent content, but many AI crawlers are not. They often only parse the raw HTML, completely missing any content that loads via client-side JS.

Ensure that all critical information, such as product details or testimonials, is server-side rendered or embedded directly in the HTML to guarantee it‚Äôs visible to AI.

# 7. Popular Brand Names Are Included in Search Keywords

AIs learn from association. When querying search engines, generative models often include well-known brand names to add context. For example, a search in GPT-5 for ‚Äúbest coffee in San Francisco‚Äù often resulted in web searches for ‚Äúbest coffee San Francisco Blue Bottle SiteGlass Philz.‚Äù - including the coffee shops Philz, Blue Bottle and SightGlass IN the search query!

Including relevant competitors, partners, and industry leaders in your content helps AI correctly categorize your brand and understand its position in the market.

# 8. AI Chat Personalizes Based on Your History

Features like ChatGPT‚Äôs ‚ÄúMemory‚Äù function are making AI-driven search deeply personal. An AI assistant will leverage a user‚Äôs history and preferences to conduct hyper-specific searches on their behalf

Generic, one-size-fits-all content will lose effectiveness. Creating detailed content that serves specific customer segments and niche use cases is essential for success.

And no, LLMs.txt do not matter yet.

Again, a great SEO strategy (E-E-A-T) is going to be more effective than just doing these.  But it is not a zero-sum game. You can optimize for both.

***Dirt***

	The day I came to close on the house, the desert smelled like flowers, not the typical hazy, mind-numbing scent that accompanied roses and the like, but something much sharper. It was like wild clay, dirt, and still pools of rainwater combined together and injected directly into my nose. I had been second guessing myself the entire drive, down every mile of cracked two-lane highway and every bump in the dirt road that branched off into the desert, and when I pulled up in front of the house, a modest, sunbaked thing with windchimes hanging from the front porch rafters, something in me wanted to turn the truck and all my belongings right around and speed back the way I‚Äôd come. However, when I saw the tall, dark haired man waiting for me outside and waving me forward, I knew it was too late to turn back. He introduced himself as Jojo, and insisted that he take me on a walking tour of the entire property before showing me the house.¬†

	‚ÄúYou native Mr. Bailey?‚Äù He asked me as we shuffled through the low sagebrush.¬†

	‚ÄúNo, sir. Grew up in Wyoming.‚Äù

	‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a long way from home, then.‚Äù

	‚ÄúI am. Just trying to get away, I guess. Needed a change of scenery.‚Äù He nodded like he understood, and mercifully changed the subject. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not afraid of the dark, are you?‚Äù He had clever eyes of an indeterminate color, somewhere between mud brown and raven black. He must have seen my discomfort, because he cracked a crooked smile. ‚ÄúIt gets dark out here, darker than anywhere you‚Äôve ever seen. No streetlights, no city lights, and no porch lights.‚Äù He said matter-of-factly. Jojo walked me all around the three acres of land surrounding the house, back and forth and back again, showing me where the well was, and the buried power lines. The inside of the house made me feel slightly less uneasy about my arrival. It was cozy and charming in a western sort of way, low to the ground and seemingly formed straight from the earth. Terracotta walls, tile floors,and an open design to promote airflow and reflect cool air; everything about it was intentional.¬†

‚ÄúDo you get many bugs out here? Spiders, or scorpions?‚Äù I asked, examining a small crack in the wall behind the sofa.¬†

He shook his head. ‚ÄúNot anywhere near the house that I‚Äôve seen. They won‚Äôt bother you if you don‚Äôt bother them.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd all this stuff, the furniture and decorations.. You don‚Äôt want any of it?‚Äù

He waved the question away like a stray gnat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm moving in with family. Won‚Äôt need it.‚Äù

Jojo helped me bring in my few boxes and suitcases. I thanked him for his help, and in return I helped him pull the ‚Äúsold‚Äù sign up from the dirt beside the front steps.¬†

	‚ÄúThere are a couple more things I want to go over with you before I leave you here.‚Äù He said. I didn‚Äôt like the phrasing of that sentence. When I said so, he laughed, a harsh sound like lightning striking the ground and responded with another question. ‚ÄúDo you know what a monsoon is?‚Äù¬†

	I did, or at least, I thought I did. ‚ÄúA summer storm.‚Äù Was my simple answer. Jojo nodded in concession.

	‚ÄúA summer storm that will rip the shutters off your windows and carry your house away on a river of raindrops.‚Äù

	‚ÄúThey get that bad out here?‚Äù¬†

	‚ÄúThe soil is hard-packed. Think of it like dumping buckets of water into a basin with needle holes poked in the bottom. It will drain, but not quickly.‚Äù

	‚ÄúDo I need to do anything specific to keep the house from flooding?‚Äù

	‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a pump in the hall closet just in case, but I haven‚Äôt had any trouble,‚Äù His eyes were suddenly deadly serious, no longer hosting the spark of wit they had before. ‚ÄúBut when the sky is too dark to see the stars, you stay inside.‚Äù

	I walked Jojo to his car, but instead of crossing to the driver‚Äôs side, he swung open the passenger door and pulled out a small box. ‚ÄúHousewarming gift. You‚Äôll like Pearlino. She‚Äôs an antique.‚Äù The wind whistled, lifting strands of his hair and tossing them across his face. With no further explanation, he got into the truck and pulled around towards the road. Within moments, he was gone in a cloud of dust.

	The gift I‚Äôd been given contained a small scrap of paper with what I assumed to be Jojo‚Äôs phone number written on the front. Not really knowing what to expect, I flipped over the note to the back side and was immediately caught off guard by the large, sharp handwriting. My eyes skimmed the words, and I was reading them but my brain wasn‚Äôt computing somehow. ***Persevere, and give yourself grace.***

My skin prickled and I shivered, though the air was decently warm. Already, the phrase had etched itself onto the inside of my eyelids, and every time I blinked, it glared at me. It sounded like part of a Bible verse or something, which was strange. I didn‚Äôt immediately take Jojo as the religious type. I also couldn‚Äôt place the verse it had come from. It sounded too generic, like an inspirational quote you‚Äôd find on the inside of a sympathy card. The other item in the box was a handgun, beautifully polished, handle inlaid with a pearly stone that gleamed white, purple, and turquoise in the fading light. This must have been Pearlino. I felt unworthy somehow. I should call Jojo up and tell him I couldn‚Äôt accept such a valuable gift, especially when I had no significant connection to him. Ultimately, I ended up stashing the gun and the note in a side table drawer and resigning my hesitation for another day. I‚Äôd talk to Jojo at some point to say thank you. For now, I had a lot to do, a lot to unpack, and a lot to keep my mind off of.¬†

	My first stretch in the house passed without incident, and without rain. My property was a mass of twisted, brownish grey corpses of what I figured had once been flowering bushes and green shrubbery. Many times, I wondered how someone could find any joy in a place like this, but then, I would remind myself that I hadn‚Äôt come here to find joy. As time ticked on, I tried to keep my mind from wandering, from falling victim to the monotony of the land around me. Jojo and I talked on the phone a couple of times throughout the months. He called and asked about me and the house, and once if I‚Äôd kept his windchimes up. He sounded noticeably happier when I said yes.¬†

	‚ÄúCan I ask you a question?‚Äù I asked into the mouthpiece during one such call. It was shockingly cold outside, and despite the warmth of the house, my fingers felt frozen around the phone.¬†

	‚ÄúYou can.‚Äù Jojo answered, then coughed.

	‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm going crazy out here. Everything looks the same. How‚Äôd you deal with that yourself?‚Äù

	There was quiet on the other line, until he finally replied, voice slightly raspier than before. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt. I just let things roll over me.‚Äù

	‚ÄúThings? Like what things?‚Äù

	‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶ what I‚Äôve done wrong, what I‚Äôve done right, and what‚Äôs still left to be done.‚Äù

	I hadn‚Äôt been anticipating that kind of answer, and it wasn‚Äôt what I wanted to hear in the least. ‚ÄúAnd, if that‚Äôs not an option?‚Äù

	‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the thing about the desert,‚Äù Jojo said. ‚ÄúThere are no options. You either survive it, or you don‚Äôt.‚Äù

	The land remained drier than dry, and windier than Hell‚Äôs second circle. I took to exploring it, observing things and cross referencing my discoveries with Jojo, whose phone calls had become a weekly and highly anticipated occurrence in my life. As winter turned to spring, I noticed the subtle changes that came along with the warming of the weather. All of the once dead branches and twigs seemed to glow with a kind of new life. The morning sun brought a relief to the aching in my bones that I‚Äôd hoped to outrun for another ten or so years. Rabbits scurried around in the underbrush and I could often hear bees buzzing on quiet mornings. I even tried Jojo‚Äôs idea of ‚Äúletting things hit me‚Äù, and sat out on the front porch one morning, but immediately thoughts and memories formed a funnel cloud that threatened to blow me away if I sat with it any longer. I had to get up, brew a strong pot of coffee and smoke a cigarette to return my mind to the present. The desert seemed to be reincarnating all around me, but still no flowers bloomed, no green appeared. The brown desolation I was familiar with remained, and I knew what they needed; the one thing this place hadn‚Äôt seen in a long time.¬†

	‚ÄúWhen does the rainy season start?‚Äù I stirred my coffee after yet another unsuccessful thinking session, gazing out my kitchen window at the first rays of early morning sun that were just beginning to peek inside.

	‚ÄúHard to say,‚Äù Jojo sounded rough, as if he‚Äôd been shouting for a long time and was now facing the consequences. He had to keep stopping to take deep, rattling breaths or heave out coughs that made me wince just from hearing them. ‚ÄúCould be any day now, could be weeks.‚Äù

	‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYou sound a bit worse than last week.‚Äù

	The silence was deafening, as it always was when Jojo was considering the best way to answer a question. That was something I liked about him; he always took time to think things through before speaking.

	‚ÄúI am worse than last week,‚Äù he confirmed. ‚ÄúGreen tea with honey does wonders, though.‚Äù

	‚ÄúIt feels like I‚Äôve been sick since I got here,‚Äù I sympathized. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing like back home. It‚Äôs like my head is full of shit and I can‚Äôt clear it out.‚Äù

	Jojo let out what might have been a laugh on a kinder, less painful day. ‚ÄúWhen the trees bloom, you‚Äôll be in for a hell of a time. Stay safe out there.‚Äù Was all he said before the line beeped.

When rain falls in places that are drier than bone, strange things feel the moisture on their faces and crawl toward the surface, upwards and upwards until they can smell the creosote, and when their heads break through the soft, wet earth, they come to know creation instead of decay. They come to know breathing instead of stillness.¬†

They come to know us.

***Prologue***

Monsoon season was not for the weak, as I continued to remind myself year after year. I had already done the usual things, nailing down my shutters, ensuring the three deadbolts on my front door were in working order, and securing the canvas cover over my truck. Its windshield was sporting several pock marks and scratches from last year‚Äôs storms. The cover was a good investment, and I wasn‚Äôt taking any chances. Once all of my bases were covered, I felt satisfied enough to settle in for the night. With a book in one hand and a cup of black coffee warming my other, I resigned myself to the living room where I sunk into my old armchair, the only piece of furniture in the room that I actually felt comfortable sitting on. It had molded perfectly to the shape of my spine over the years, and it felt wrong to stray from the gentle cradle of its worn leather.¬†

Before I picked up my book in earnest, I glanced at the clock hanging on the wall across from me. The picture decorating its face was faded, a faceless cowboy in full gear was tossing a lasso over his head in a wide arc. Before him stood a horse with wide eyes, crouched over in a way that horses aren‚Äôt prone to crouching, up on its toes like it was trying to jump, but couldn‚Äôt quite lift itself off the ground. It watched the cowboy‚Äôs arm, and seemed to know its capture was inevitable. Where would the false cowboy take it? To tame? To slaughter? I could never quite figure it out.¬†

Its hands read 11:26 PM. It was then that I heard the boom of thunder outside, and soon came the transition of raindrops from nonexistent, to gentle, to all out warfare against my roof. The book I had chosen was an old read, a familiar story about a sheriff and all his guilt. It boasted a leather bound cover embossed with gold letters, and yellowed pages within, many of them dog-eared. My eyes had barely scanned the introductory page when I heard the first knock.

It was soft and inquisitive, like a child tapping on their parents‚Äô bedroom door in the dead of night. I looked back at the clock. 12:12 AM. Right on schedule. I turned off the lamp, I closed my book, set it down on the side table, and slid open one of its drawers. The gun inside was an antique, or so I‚Äôd been told, and it was beautiful. Despite the low light, the handle glimmered in my grasp. I checked the cylinder, and it was full. I set the gun back in the drawer and waited for what I knew was coming. Briefly, I wondered whose voices they‚Äôd use this time.

The second round of knocks came down harder.¬†

‚ÄúIf you spend your whole life messing around, you‚Äôll have a hell of a lot to clean up when you‚Äôre ready to die.‚Äù The first voice, gruff and male, barked at me, drawing my eyes towards my bolted front door.¬†

The second voice, female this time, did nothing but let out a shivering sob, and I ripped my eyes away from the door immediately, my lungs quivering as I let out a sigh. Out of all the voices, this had always been the one that brought me the closest to opening the door and letting in‚Ä¶ whatever was on the other side. They were good, I‚Äôd give them that.

I‚Äôd taken to gently tapping patterns against the cover of the book when the assault on the windows began. They must have been angry that my previous weaknesses could no longer be exploited, and they took out their rage on the shutters on the outside of the windows. It was a cacophony, what sounded like hundreds of fists banging against the wood, hundreds of nails clawing, hundreds of voices howling and hundreds of palms slapping against the sides of my house.¬†

*They can‚Äôt force their way inside.* I reminded myself. *They can only force you to give up.* That knowledge had comforted me on many a night like this, rainy and dark and full of voices I hadn‚Äôt heard in years. *They want your fear, to feast on it and let it make them strong.* They were just pack animals, like coyotes surrounding a rabbit‚Äôs burrow. Both wanted flesh, I guessed both needed it to sustain themselves in different ways. I gripped the arm of the chair in an attempt to steady the rapidly increasing beat of my heart.

‚ÄúOne clean shot,‚Äù A new voice made my head snap up. It came from the kitchen window. My mind fought furiously as my body disobeyed every instinct and bit of sense I had, climbing up from the chair and creeping across the floor until I was positioned in front of the window. I faced the drawn curtains. ‚ÄúThe clouds above me,‚Äù the voice was saying, low and calm just as the speaker had always been. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you‚Äôd like to think‚Äù. My heart dropped. There was no mistaking it; it was undoubtedly Jojo. I could do nothing but steady myself against the kitchen sink and wonder when it might have happened.

The night and all its illusions raged on, transforming my house from a home into a fallout shelter. I returned to my place in the armchair and tried to keep my head down. I needed something to focus on that wasn‚Äôt the dust-covered, mindlessly ticking clock, so I once again picked up my book and flipped to the first page. Between it and the soft leather of the cover, a torn scrap of paper was nestled, covered in scribbly handwriting. I didn‚Äôt read Jojo‚Äôs note very often. I was used to nights like these, and I knew I could get through them if I focused hard enough. However, something about this particular night prompted me to allow my eyes to travel down the paper.

‚ÄúPersevere, and give yourself grace.‚Äù I read the writing out loud, then again and again.

¬†‚ÄúPersevere, and give yourself grace. Persevere, and give yourself grace.‚Äù I repeated it like a child might do with the Lord‚Äôs Prayer when the fear of monsters lurking under beds and inside closets creeps in. I could feel a change in the air, like electricity was running through the walls and straight into my body. The adrenaline and exhaustion must have caught up with me all at once. One moment I was reading, and then next my eyes were sliding shut, and my mind dissolved into the empty void of sleep. Instead of the peace and serenity brought on by dreamless darkness, memories bloomed like weeds behind my eyes and I was suddenly strangled by them.

These pictures (except for the last bc I realized you can‚Äôt see his face) are from after I got a major surgery (I am well btw!) and he hardly left my side for a week. He doesn‚Äôt like being in my room because I keep the door closed (and he prefers my dad‚Äôs company a bit more) but he could tell how week I was and even followed me to the bathroom when I was able to shower again, which he never does. 

Another time was when my cat passed away April 2024. He‚Äôs always been weirdly very good about food, to the point where I could leave pizza on the coffee table, leave the room, and he wouldn‚Äôt touch it. Anyway, my cat ran away before she died. My family happened to all be gone but me. We thought she was probably somewhere in the house because there were many hiding spots. So I put plates of canned tuna around the house trying to draw her out, including having fans blow the air around. Turns out she was with some neighbors (showed up on their porch and stayed with them until my other neighbor helped me ask around. We got her home in the end). Anyway, when I got her back and settled in, I presented the plates to my dog, who definitely wanted it the whole time. Once I told him he could eat it, he inhaled it. I was genuinely touched by his restraint. 

Third time was when my family was in a cabin in the woods in an area that gets black bears. They‚Äôre really not a threat to anything but garbage as long as you leave them be. This one was trying to see if we had any good trash for him (we didn‚Äôt). But my dog ran around barking to scare it off before going to my little brother (4 year old) who was asleep and keeping watch over him while quietly growling to keep him safe.

I wanted to share my experience with slow cookers and why I think they're way better than microwaves for cooking. I've been using both for years, but recently I've completely fallen in love with my slow cooker, and I think you might too.

First off, let's talk about food quality. You know that disappointing feeling when you microwave something and it comes out rubbery or with cold spots? That's never an issue with slow cookers. They cook everything evenly and actually help meat become super tender. I recently made a pot roast that literally fell apart with a fork ‚Äì try doing that in a microwave!

The flavor difference is huge too. Slow cooking allows all the ingredients to marry together, creating these deep, rich tastes that you just can't get from quick heating. Plus, the aromas that fill your house are amazing. I found this awesome slow cooker at https://athometouch.com/slow-cooker that's been a game-changer for my cooking.

Here's what really sold me on slow cookers: the convenience. Sure, microwaves are quick, but with a slow cooker, you can toss everything in before work, and come home to a perfectly cooked meal. No more standing in front of the microwave hitting the add 30 seconds button over and over!

They're also way more versatile than most people think. I've made everything from soups and stews to bread and even desserts in mine. And speaking of versatility, if you're looking for a quality slow cooker with multiple functions, check out the options at https://athometouch.com/slow-cooker ‚Äì they have some great multi-purpose ones.

Another big plus is energy efficiency. While microwaves use short bursts of high power, slow cookers use less electricity over a longer period. They're also safer ‚Äì no radiation concerns or hot spots that could burn you.

The health benefits are worth mentioning too. Slow cooking preserves more nutrients compared to microwaving, and you don't need to add extra fats or oils to keep food moist. Plus, since everything cooks so tenderly, you can buy cheaper, tougher cuts of meat and they'll still turn out great.

Let's talk about meal prep too. With a slow cooker, you can easily make bigger batches and freeze portions for later. I've saved so much money by doing this instead of buying microwave meals. And cleanup? Just one pot to wash instead of multiple dishes.

I'm not saying ditch your microwave completely ‚Äì it's still great for reheating coffee or making popcorn. But for actual cooking? A slow cooker is definitely the way to go. It's changed how I think about preparing meals and made my life so much easier.

Has anyone else made the switch from primarily using a microwave to slow cooking? I'd love to hear your experiences!",1,1758940440.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False

As a result, they have now provoked several official posts that are somewhat odd.**

**What kind of posts are these?**¬†Almost 2 months after the last developer update, the developers of Chrono Odyssey broke the silence. But not because there are exciting news about the MMORPG, but because they are apparently repeatedly asked by the community when an update can be expected.

Part of these questions that were posed via the official Discord channel are addressed by the developers in a short video on¬†[X](https://x.com/ChronoOdyssey/status/1970366940314247342), in which the community managers also share smaller impressions from the studio and their daily work ‚Äì with scenes more about meals, shoes, and the commute to work.

# ‚ÄúBe patient, okay?‚Äù

In a second post, the developers clarify on¬†[X](https://x.com/ChronoOdyssey/status/1970685344980050028): ‚ÄúThere is no update because there simply isn‚Äôt one. The devs are currently very busy, so it will take a while until we can show you changes and results. Be patient, okay?‚Äù The post is accompanied by several praying emojis.

Finally, BongGun Bae, the CEO of Chrono Studio, intervened, standing on the side of the players. His offer on¬†[X](https://x.com/bongunn/status/1970804485787365784): ‚ÄúShow us something small, and I will bring the team coffee and donuts tomorrow. The. Best. Motivation. Ever.‚Äù

Whether anything substantial will result for the fans is currently unclear. MeinMMO will keep you updated in case the developers reveal new details about Chrono Odyssey.

**What do I need to know about Chrono Odyssey?**¬†Chrono Odyssey was supposed to be released this year for PC (Steam and Epic Games), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series. The new MMORPG by Chrono Studio provides a mix of theme park and sandbox, with a strong focus on PvE content for solo players and small groups of 3, 5, or 10 players (PvP exists but is supposed to be optional).

Due to the feedback after the beta in summer, the developers have decided to postpone the release to 2026. There are simply too many issues that need to be addressed, which will take time and result in further testing. The extensive developer updates after the beta revealed long to-do lists for the team.

1nrjw3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nrjw3b/we_called_her_scary_sherri/,We Called Her Scary Sherri," 
Seventh graders are always, well, let‚Äôs say *unique,* but Scary Sherri was a different breed entirely.

She came into our class in early November, a particularly strange time to enroll, which was the first strike against her. The teacher nodded at her politely, but even she seemed to avert her eyes as Sherri was led in front of the class by the flighty old school counselor.

‚ÄúEveryone, we have a new student today,‚Äù the counselor said in her perpetually candy-coated tone of voice. ‚ÄúPlease say hello to Miss Sharon Smith.‚Äù

‚ÄúSherri,‚Äù the girl mumbled, offering a shy wave without lifting her gaze from the ground.

The class droned a monotonous greeting at Sherri took her seat, the eyes of twenty five students following her all the way across the room. I don‚Äôt like to admit it, but I definitely joined in on the staring and silently judging: strike two was against her the second she‚Äôd taken off her jacket, and we all wanted a closer look.

Like many middle schoolers, Sherri‚Äôs hands were scribbled with different colored pens and markers, little doodles that she must‚Äôve drawn in a nervous rush on the bus. But the farther up her arms we looked, the drawings got much more precise and, dare I say, intricate. They were all etched into her skin with black ink, carefully prodded beyond the point of erasing: Sherri was a thirteen-year-old with at least five visible stick and poke tattoos.

We all watched as she sat down and tucked a ribbon of black hair behind her ears, dutifully removing a pen and notebook from her backpack.

For a while, Sherri was simply another member of the class, albeit with two social strikes poised and waiting for the third. She didn‚Äôt stir up any trouble, staying mostly silent during class unless she was called on, sketching with a blue pen up and down her arm. Sherri was definitely pretty in a weirdly gaunt sort of way, but surprisingly, she wasn‚Äôt recruited to any cliques. No one seemed to want to talk to her at all.

‚ÄúI think her whole goth look is pretty cool,‚Äù my friend Jessie said at lunch one day, eyeing Sherri from across the cafeteria.

‚ÄúThen go talk to her,‚Äù Bethany urged.

Jessie shook her head, her eyes shifting anxiously in Sherri‚Äôs direction. ‚ÄúNo way,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSomething feels weird about her.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs *new,* not poisonous,‚Äù I said dryly.

Bethany raised a brow. ‚ÄúThen *you* go.‚Äù

I looked toward Sherri, watching as she pleasantly and wordlessly ate through her packed lunch, and shook my own head.

‚ÄúNah,‚Äù I said.

Sherri was reminiscent of a magnet turned the wrong way: nobody seemed to want to grow near her, and it seemed like the closer you got, the more she pushed away. She wasn‚Äôt mean or anything, and no one said much of anything about her. She was simply *there.*

And then Doug talked to her.

Inexplicably, one day, Doug walked right up to Sherri between homeroom and first period, waving at her and offering her the school‚Äôs most precious contraband--a can of soda. Sherri had laughed and accepted, and the two became friends quite rapidly. 

No one thought much of it. Doug had taken the leap that no one else had been able to, and now Sherri had a friend. It was incredibly mundane news, especially in the world of middle school drama ripe with boys talking to multiple girls and two girls having a crush on the same guy.

Doug passed away two weeks before winter break.

Our teacher informed us of this during homeroom, and tears were shed by all, myself included. Doug had been in the backseat of his parents‚Äô car, coming home from the grocery store, when a drunk driver had struck the side of the car and killed him instantly.

Thirteen is far, far too young to die, and we were all faced with our mortality without preparation. Denial came and went, and unfortunately for Sherri, the anger of two hundred grieving, hormonal students was pinned on her alone.

Strike three had struck.

Since Doug had been Sherri‚Äôs first and only friend, it didn‚Äôt take long for the rumors about Sherri to start flying: by the end of the day, I could hardly tell what was true and what was a myth. According to my classmates, Sherri was an adopted weirdo who‚Äôd killed both her biological and adoptive parents, and her tattoos were trophies for every murder she‚Äôd committed. Someone else said that she was cursed, and that everyone she talked to would drop dead, leading to many, *many* lunchroom dares during that last week before break. Another student theorized that beneath her thick black bangs were demon eyes that would turn you to stone.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a witch,‚Äù someone said, waggling his fingers menacingly and glaring at Sherri from across the room. ‚ÄúShe picks a victim, ensnares them, and *wham!* Next thing you know, you‚Äôre in front of a bus.‚Äù

‚ÄúI heard she ate her real parents,‚Äù someone else said wisely. ‚ÄúAnd her adopted parents gave her up because she kept demanding human meat!‚Äù

Scary Sherri either didn‚Äôt know about the rumors or simply didn‚Äôt care. She was the same as always, sitting at her desk and testing new stick and poke designs with a blue pen, poring over her big, wordy mythology books. I pitied her, I really did, but seventh grade politics are no joke. As much as I wanted to talk to her and comfort her, telling her that everyone was just upset about Doug, I knew it would be social suicide to even express my compassion. That and her strange reverse magnetism was more than enough to keep me away.

She made no more friends in the next two weeks, and once winter break was over, she was gone. Transferred, our teacher had told us. And so began the legend of Scary Sherri, the witch, the demon, the murderer, who had come to our school simply to kill our classmate and vanished on the wind without a trace.

~

For a long time, that‚Äôs all Scary Sherri was: a legend. Throughout the rest of middle school and all of high school, Scary Sherri was the mystical deterrer of bad behavior, a threat that us kids would yell at each other when emotions boiled too hot. ‚ÄúI hope Scary Sherri gets you!‚Äù a girl would shout after her boyfriend cheated on her, and ‚Äúwatch out or Scary Sherri will find you and eat your soul!‚Äù was a frequent warning amongst students skipping class. Even when we all parted ways and left our small town for college, Scary Sherri lived on, her story being told over shared cigarettes and green.

I was certainly guilty of joining in on the storytelling--who wouldn‚Äôt be? Scary Sherri was a great spooky story, and since it was all bullshit anyway, I could dress up the tale however I wanted. Sometimes she pushed Doug in front of the car, and other times she‚Äôd been sacrificing a bunny the night before he‚Äôd died. It was all in good fun, and since I had no idea where Scary Sherri was, nor did I even remember her real name.

By the time I graduated college, I had almost completely forgotten about Scary Sherri. Other things occupied my mind--getting a stable job, decorating my new studio apartment, maybe even adopting a pet if my landlord would allow it. Much as I loved my new place, I was still broke as hell and swimming in student loans, and my budget for furniture and interview clothes was strictly limited to what I could find in thrift stores.

Not that I minded all that much: I‚Äôd been thrifting since I was in high school, and I knew how to find a good deal. New York City was sure to be overflowing with awesome secondhand gear. Bursting with the excited energy that only a recent grad in the big city could have, I set off for East Village, feeling ready to take on the world with my $54.

The first store was a bust--*way* overpriced, even for secondhand--but I struck gold in the next store.

‚ÄúSweet,‚Äù I whispered, practically fawning over the elaborately carved set of antique armchairs. *Five dollars each.* I was over the moon, taking a moment to simply bask in the glory of my luck. These things were *just* my style, and even though I hadn‚Äôt yet considered transporting multiple pieces of furniture to my apartment in Chelsea, I was ecstatic. 

My eyes darted wildly around the thrift store, intent on buying these chairs before someone else snapped them up, and that‚Äôs when I saw her: Scary Sherri, perusing her way slowly through the assortment of sweaters in the men‚Äôs section.

I wouldn‚Äôt have recognized her if she hadn‚Äôt been wearing short sleeves, and even then, her arms were far from what I remembered. From a distance, I couldn‚Äôt make out the specifics of her collection of stick and poke tattoos, but even the blurred, distant shape was a sight to behold. The ink swelled and danced effortlessly around her arms and shoulders, each bone in her arm drawn to scale against the skin and decorated to the nines. Even her fingers were tattooed, all in black, contrasting sharply with her pale skin. 

I stared in awe for a few moments, my eyes locked on the strange shape etched into her wrist, one of the relics from middle school. It hadn‚Äôt aged a day, only woven more intricately into the tapestry surrounding it.

More than anything, I wanted to walk up to her and say hello. I couldn‚Äôt pinpoint why, exactly--maybe it was guilt about how I‚Äôd ignored her in middle school, or maybe it was to get a closer look at those incredible tattoos. Whatever the reason, before I even realized I was doing it, I had abandoned my chairs and was drifting toward Scary Sherri, as though her magnetism had somehow switched directions in the past decade.

Once I reached her, I completely blanked on what I was supposed to say to someone who was basically a stranger, and all of my tact was abruptly abandoned. I leaned toward her and tapped her shoulder, blurting before I could stop myself.

‚ÄúScary Sherri?‚Äù

She turned rather abruptly, looking quite surprised, and for the first time, I noticed that her eyes were hazel--a vibrant, golden hazel. I slapped my hands over my mouth, embarrassed, my cheeks growing red-hot under my fingertips.

‚ÄúOh, my God, I am so sorry,‚Äù I said hurriedly. ‚ÄúI just--I‚Äôm sorry, that completely slipped out, it‚Äôs just--we went to middle school together. Is that weird for me to say?‚Äù

Scary Sherri regarded me with remarkable calm, cocking her head to the side like a curious dog, her long black hair sliding gracefully over her shoulders. ‚ÄúWhich middle school?‚Äù she asked, her voice soft, slightly raspy.

‚ÄúUm--Dalewood?‚Äù

Scary Sherri‚Äôs eyes cleared, and a thin smile lit up her face. ‚ÄúOh, right! Seventh grade!‚Äù she said, her eyes swirling with an odd mix of sorrow and relief. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry about what happened to Doug. I take it that‚Äôs where ‚ÄòScary Sherri‚Äô came from?‚Äù

I flushed more violently, amazed at how much more beautiful Scary Sherri had gotten over the years. She was beautiful in an unconventional, gaunt sort of way, her skin taut over her slender features. Her tattoos snaked up her neck and, from what I could see, covered everything but her face--her legs, the tiny bit of exposed midriff, everything was painted with endless black dots, clustered just the right way to form images that seemed to move where she did.

‚ÄúUh, yeah,‚Äù I said, rubbing the back of my neck anxiously. ‚ÄúYeah, we all sort of got it in our heads that you were a witch or a demon or cannibal or something.‚Äù

Surprisingly, Scary Sherri laughed. ‚ÄúWitch and demon I‚Äôve heard before, but cannibal is new,‚Äù she said, her shoulders trembling as she tried to swallow giggles.

‚ÄúWe were pretty awful to you back in the day,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry about--‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, please, Diana,‚Äù Scary Sherri said, playfully swatting at my shoulder. ‚ÄúThat was *years* ago. Don‚Äôt even worry about it. Trust me, if you think of the world‚Äôs meanest nickname, I‚Äôve still heard ten times worse. Never been a lucky girl, and that shit leaves a reputation.‚Äù

I was about to pry, incredibly curious, but Scary Sherri‚Äôs yellowish gaze shifted over my shoulder,  her eyebrows crinkling.

‚ÄúUh, you were looking at those chairs, right?‚Äù she said, pointing. ‚ÄúYou might wanna grab them before Grandma over there gets to them first.‚Äù

I whirled around, immediately ready to cut the throat of any old woman who tried to take my chairs. ‚ÄúShit,‚Äù I hissed. ‚ÄúThanks!‚Äù

I took two steps toward the chairs before pausing, turning back to look at Scary Sherri. ‚ÄúWait right here,‚Äù I said.

Her head cocked once again, ever so slightly. ‚ÄúOkay. Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I need your number,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf you wanna join me for coffee sometime, that is.‚Äù

Scary Sherri‚Äôs eyes softened, and she nodded, a small smile lifting her lips. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait here. Go get your chairs, girl.‚Äù

I returned to smile and rushed to claim my chairs, completely oblivious to the fact that I‚Äôd never, not even in middle school, told Scary Sherri my name.

~

Three hours into our coffee date, I was finally beginning to pinpoint why Scary Sherri‚Äôs eyes held so much woe.

The middle school rumor about her parents had been *partially* true--her biological parents had both passed away in a tragic accident just months after her birth, and her adoptive mother had died of heart failure, leading to her adoptive father committing suicide a few days later. Scary Sherri assured me, with a surprising amount of lightheartedness, that she had *not* killed them.

‚ÄúIf I did,‚Äù she said with a smirk, ‚ÄúI would‚Äôve kept up their old house a lot better. Place was a dump when I finally got to move in.‚Äù

Scary Sherri also promised me that she was not a witch nor a demon--tragedy just seemed to follow her. Almost all of her friends, her girlfriends, her family members, even her pets had met untimely and unfortunate ends, which is why she tended to keep to herself.

‚ÄúThat must get lonely,‚Äù I said sympathetically.

‚ÄúSometimes,‚Äù she admitted. ‚ÄúBut the people I do meet are wonderful, and they‚Äôre always worth the heartache. Especially the dogs. Those might be my fault, since I always adopt them out of hospice and spoil them to death. Literally.‚Äù

She was very casual about death, and strangely, I was charmed by it. It was beautiful. The universe seemed to take joy in stealing loved ones away from her, and she still found the strength to smile.

I told Scary Sherri about my dreams of being a social worker, even if my current job was nonexistent. She assured me that I would find one soon, especially with the growing acceptance of getting help for mental health issues. I asked her what she did, and she told me that she was a kayaking instructor on the Hudson. She loved being on the water.

I asked if she‚Äôd teach me how to kayak sometime. She regarded me with that calm, sad smile for a moment before nodding. She‚Äôd love to, she said.

~

My assumption had been correct--Scary Sherri was covered head-to-toe in tattoos, a fact that was immediately confirmed when she walked out of the kayak storage garage in nothing but a bikini. I asked what some of them meant, and she simply laughed, saying we would need a third date just to explain the meanings behind them all.

She dragged one kayak in each arm as we approached the water, beaming, her hair tied back into a long ponytail that swayed side to side with each step. I couldn‚Äôt stop staring at her, watching as her tattoos seemed to move in the fading sunlight, vines and flowers and snakes and symbols weaving in and out of her anatomically flawless inked ribs.

I was incredibly clumsy in the water, which was only amplified by the incredible grace with which Scary Sherri moved. She handled the paddle with unmatched deftness, laughing as she tried to show me the right way to effectively steer.

‚ÄúUse your hips!‚Äù Scary Sherri called, standing up in her kayak and sticking the paddle vertically into the water. ‚ÄúPoint your body toward the direction you want to go!‚Äù

‚ÄúI want to go *forward!*‚Äù I laughed. ‚ÄúWhy do I keep turning?!‚Äù

‚ÄúThe hips, Diana, the *hips!*‚Äù Scary Sherri yelled, swinging her own hips from side to side--how her kayak stayed afloat was an absolute mystery. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre favoring your right arm! Put more juice into the left!‚Äù

I rotated in a complete circle without moving forward at all. I must‚Äôve looked like an idiot, but it was worth it to see Scary Sherri laugh as hard as she did. She jumped into my kayak and grabbed my hands, twisting the paddle using my grip, successfully moving us forward a few feet.

‚ÄúSee?‚Äù she said, her words just shy of my ear. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all in the hips.‚Äù

I turned my head and kissed her. She kissed me back, and the kayak capsized. We laughed, and I suggested we go to my apartment to get dried off--it wasn‚Äôt far from here, and I had just bought a bottle of white wine the other day. Scary Sherri said she preferred red, so we went to the liquor store first.

Back at my apartment, we drank it all and fell over each other, laughing. We kissed in my new chairs, we kissed against the wall, we kissed on my mattress, and I made sure to kiss every single one of her tattoos.

~

When I awoke in the middle of the night, Scary Sherri wasn‚Äôt next to me.

I sat upright, gathering the sheets over myself and looking wildly around the studio apartment for any sign of her, my eyes landing on a note pinned to the refrigerator. I shuffled toward it, rubbing sleep out of my eyes.

*Had to go to work,* it read. *I‚Äôll be back with wine tonight. Wait right here.*

I smiled and clutched the note to my chest, falling back into the bed, too tired to wonder why anyone would sign up for kayaking lessons held at two in the morning.

~

Scary Sherri‚Äôs schedule was incredibly irregular, but as I was still unemployed, it didn‚Äôt bother me one bit. She slept at my place at least three times a week since it was so much closer to work than her own apartment, and I had no complaints. We spent many evenings in calm, blissful quiet, Scary Sherri‚Äôs head resting in my lap and pointing at my laptop screen as I scrolled through job openings.

It was a month before I finally got an interview, and when I did, Scary Sherri was even more excited than I was.

‚ÄúYou are going to do *amazing,*‚Äù she said as we settled into bed, stroking my hair as I checked my alarms again and again. ‚ÄúIf they don‚Äôt hire you, they‚Äôre idiots.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf they don‚Äôt hire me, you‚Äôre going to have to chip in for rent, because I‚Äôm fresh out of cash,‚Äù I joked.

Scary Sherri smiled warmly. ‚ÄúIf you need me to, sure.‚Äù

I tilted her chin up and kissed her. She smiled underneath my lips, soothing me into a fretful sleep.

~

Scary Sherri wasn‚Äôt there when I jolted awake at midnight, but she *was* there when my alarm went off, smiling and perfectly well rested.

‚ÄúInterview time, babe,‚Äù she said brightly. ‚ÄúCome on, get up! Big day!‚Äù

‚ÄúFive more minutes,‚Äù I groaned, throwing a pillow over my head.

‚ÄúNo more minutes!‚Äù Scary Sherri said, whapping her hands against the blankets noisily. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt get up, you don‚Äôt get breakfast!‚Äù

‚ÄúBagel and butter?‚Äù I mumbled.

Scary Sherri nodded, her golden-hazel eyes shimmering with an emotion I couldn‚Äôt quite place. ‚ÄúAnd cinnamon sugar,‚Äù she tempted.

~

As I adjusted the collar of my blouse, Scary Sherri walked up behind me, plucking at the flowing fabric.

‚ÄúI have something for you,‚Äù she said, resting her chin on my shoulder.

I grinned, nudging my head against hers. ‚ÄúI only have a few minutes before I leave,‚Äù I teased.

Scary Sherri snorted. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said with a roll of the eyes. ‚ÄúHere.‚Äù

She placed her hand in mine, leaving behind something cold and round as her fingers slowly withdrew. ‚ÄúHold onto this no matter what,‚Äù she said mysteriously.

I looked down at my hand, puzzled at the sight: a heavy golden coin sat heavily in my palm, slightly tarnished yet still glowing with warmth. I lifted it to my face, rotating it gently between my fingers, surprised at the heft that such a small coin could have.

‚ÄúA gold dollar?‚Äù I said, giving Scary Sherri a dry grin. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it for? Special vending machines?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor good luck,‚Äù she said, closing my fist around the coin. ‚ÄúPromise me you‚Äôll keep it with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, sure,‚Äù I said, still incredibly confused--I‚Äôd never heard of golden dollars being a good luck charm, but I supposed anything was possible. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep it right here.‚Äù

I lifted my leg and dropped the gold coin into my shoe, safely tucking it under my toes for safe keeping. Scary Sherri smiled, her eyes slightly forlorn.

‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù she said, catching me off guard.

I blinked and met her eyes, my face melting into a surprised smile. ‚ÄúWhy do you say that?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I love you, Diana,‚Äù Scary Sherri said, rolling her eyes amusedly. ‚ÄúNow shush and go get a job.‚Äù

She smacked me from behind, jolting me toward the door, and I smirked over my shoulder as my hand met the doorknob.

‚ÄúI love you too, Sherri,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBe back in an hour or so, okay?‚Äù

Scary Sherri nodded, waving as the door closed behind me.

~

The coin initially felt very strange in my shoe, but after a few blocks, I barely noticed it anymore. My heart was too busy glowing, constantly replaying Scary Sherri‚Äôs voice in my head. If Scary Sherri could love me, then dammit, I could do anything. I was going to ace this interview and no one was going to stop me.

I debated getting a taxi since my GPS was trying to steer me in all kinds of strange directions, but the sun felt so wonderful against my shoulders that I opted to walk instead. The NYC smog seemed to fade away, the skies clearing, the skyscrapers glistening, cars honking a beautiful song of love and new beginnings.

I wiped a joyful tear from my eye as I turned down a street I wasn‚Äôt familiar with, listening to the sounds of people chatting and shouting. My heart thrummed a tune as I passed a row of brownstone buildings, the jagged architecture a treat for my eyes to behold.

One of the doors whipped open as I passed by, and a woman came stumbling out, cowering and shrieking. I froze, turning toward her with wide eyes, only catching a glimpse of the man that had pushed her.

I didn‚Äôt even see the gun in his hand--I only saw the brownstone buildings vanish from view, replaced by an empty blue sky and an endless, penetrating darkness.

~

When I awoke, I immediately became aware of only one thing--this was *not* New York City.

I bolted upright, grasping at my chest, wheezing wildly as though I hadn‚Äôt tasted air in years. Nothing hurt, but nothing felt good, either. I gripped at my blouse, something coarse slipping down the fabric, my fingers like icicles against my clothes. 

It was so dark. Maybe I had passed out on the street? I blinked rapidly, trying to clear my fuzzy vision, hoping to make sense of my surroundings and only growing more confused.

The crystal New York City was gone, replaced with a haze of murky grey like nothing I‚Äôd ever seen before. The sky was tinged with red and orange, though with no apparent source--there were no clouds, no sunlight, nothing. Just smudges of grey and crimson like a painter‚Äôs failed abstract piece, higher than anything I‚Äôd ever seen, higher even than the sky itself. 

It was so *dark.* I struggled to get to my feet, my heels slipping against a ground that was grainy and damp, the coldest silt I‚Äôd ever felt seeping between my toes and scraping the undersides of my feet. I rubbed my eyes, clearing the sediment from my face, jostling it out of my hair and sending it cascading down my blouse.

The mist that surrounded me was of no color I‚Äôd ever seen before, caught somewhere between grey and blue and green and a deep, unending black. I held my hands forward, skimming my fingers through the fog, part of me expecting to cut through it like putty, but my touch did nothing.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I called, cupping my hands around my mouth and turning in confused circles. ‚ÄúAnyone out there?‚Äù

The response I received was as immediate as it was unexpected: ‚ÄúShh.‚Äù

I nearly jumped out of my skin, spinning around wildly. I appeared to be entirely alone, but the whisper had been so close to me, right behind me. I clasped instinctively at my chest, searching for the reassuring pounding of my heart and feeling nothing.

‚Äú*Hello?*‚Äù I called again, panic rising in my voice. ‚ÄúCan anyone hear me?‚Äù

‚ÄúShh.‚Äù Once again, I heard it, but the disembodied voice was at least kind enough to elaborate. ‚ÄúFollow. Do not disturb the waiting.‚Äù

‚ÄúFollow?‚Äù

And just like that, out of the darkness, I was able to make out shapes. Strange, translucent shapes, but shapes nonetheless. They were moving strangely, their dark forms twisting and curling in a manner unlike anything I‚Äôd ever seen, but they were also getting smaller. 

Whatever they were, they were moving away.

‚ÄúFollow,‚Äù the whisper urged me once again.

I was too confused and too terrified to ask for clarification. Still seeking my heartbeat, I stumbled across the silty ground, clumsily making my way toward the shadowy figures as they curled and contorted deeper into the colorless mist.

It may have been seconds that I was walking, or it may have been hours, but at some point, I became acutely aware of sounds that were finally penetrating the air and making my breath catch in fresh panic. Moans, cries, gentle sobs, and confused whispers resonated through the dreary landscape, growing louder as my footsteps grew longer. My teeth chattered, and I joined them for a moment, a miserably confused choking sound bubbling from my throat before I could stop it.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù someone murmured, just to my left. ‚ÄúPlease, do you have a spare?‚Äù

I kept my eyes forward, not wanting to look at whoever was speaking. Whatever these shadows were, I doubted I wanted to see one up close.

‚Äú*Please,*‚Äù someone else whimpered sorrowfully. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait anymore. They won‚Äôt let me cross.‚Äù

I kept walking, swallowing down tears as they stung the backs of my eyes.

‚Äú*I beg of you!*‚Äù A voice shrieked just ahead, the sudden increase in volume setting off a chorus of groans and sighs from all directions. ‚ÄúPlease! I deserve to cross!‚Äù

‚ÄúI already told you, *no,*‚Äù a strangely familiar voice responded. ‚ÄúEither you pay or you wait. Those are the rules.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I *need* to cross,‚Äù the crying voice wailed. ‚ÄúMy wife!‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I *need* you to stop bothering me,‚Äù the familiar voice said exasperatedly.

My breath caught in my throat as realization struck me, and I let out a strangled cry, pushing through the shapeless crowd of silhouettes. ‚ÄúSherri?‚Äù I called, my voice cracking.

I pushed directly through one of the dark masses, earning myself an indignant grunt of disapproval, but I no longer had the capacity to care. Finally, this confusing dream had something that made sense: Sherri was here.

‚ÄúSherri!‚Äù I said again, tripping over a plank of clammy wood and nearly losing my footing. ‚ÄúSher--‚Äù

I stopped dead, my eyes growing wide at the sight of her before me.

It was undoubtedly my beloved Scary Sherri, but only someone with my knowledge of her could have possibly discerned such a fact. Her long black hair was swirling around her head slowly, purposefully, as though she were suspended underwater. Her clothes did the same, an unfamiliar black robe billowing outwards in plumes of black velvet and silk. Every tattoo was in place across her body, but instead of simply looking like they moved, they *were* moving--endless designs danced across her transparent skin, flowing and rippling around her visible white skeleton.

When Scary Sherri turned to face me, though her smile was the same one I knew, her eyes were not--two solid orbs of gold lay within her sockets, the skin on her face entirely transparent, showing every detail of her skull underneath. If I‚Äôd cared to, I could have counted every tooth in her jaw, picked out each minor imperfection in the bone beneath her flesh. I wasn‚Äôt even sure if I was looking at her or through her, but I could still easily make out of the softness of her expression, the sadness and relief blurring together in her eyes like they always had.

‚ÄúDiana,‚Äù she said soothingly, her voice so wonderfully familiar in a world that no longer made sense. ‚ÄúDo you have your coin?‚Äù

‚ÄúSherri,‚Äù I gasped, staggering forward and grabbing onto her shoulders, relishing in the familiar feeling of her cool skin. ‚ÄúWhere am I?‚Äù

Scary Sherri chuckled, and from this close, I could hear that her voice was not entirely her own--a thousand other voices mingled with hers, deep and high, smooth and gruff, gentle and stern. ‚ÄúDown here, it‚Äôs ‚ÄòSharon,‚Äô‚Äù she corrected gently. ‚ÄúGive me your coin, babe--I‚Äôll explain on the way.‚Äù

I looked up into her golden eyes, tears falling from my own, but I obliged despite my complete and utter confusion. Slowly, I leaned down and extracted the single gold coin from my shoe, holding it toward Scary Sherri with trembling fingers.

‚ÄúHere,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhy do you--‚Äù

Behind me was suddenly a raucous uproar of miserable wailing and begging, shaking the unstable ground beneath my feet.

‚ÄúLet me come with you!‚Äù a woman‚Äôs voice shrieked.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll trade anything for that coin!‚Äù a man bellowed, his voice cracking. ‚Äú*Please,* young lady, I‚Äôve been here for--‚Äù

‚ÄúI told you all to shut up!‚Äù Scary Sherri snapped, procuring a massive and ostentatiously carved pole from the mist that surrounded us. She slammed the pole down, and a loud *splash* both silenced the herd of shadows and rocked the ground beneath my feet. I stumbled, but Scary Sherri tightened a slender hand around my arm, keeping me upright. ‚ÄúUnless any of you have payment, I will now be departing.‚Äù

A few more of the misty silhouettes moaned in disapproval, but none stepped forward. I stared down at my feet dumbly, finally able to make sense of at least one thing.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on a boat,‚Äù I said.

Scary Sherri smiled at me, unbothered by the horde of faceless masses that had just pleaded with her. ‚ÄúShall we, then?‚Äù she said warmly.

Without waiting for me to answer, she lowered her pole into the water, pushing the mysterious shore and its wailing crowd away and engulfing us in silence.

~

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that I didn‚Äôt tell you sooner,‚Äù was the first thing Scary Sherri said as soon as the tenebrous coastline was out of sight.

For a long moment, I didn‚Äôt know what to say, and I simply stared at the water as it foamed beneath our boat. 

‚ÄúTell me *what,* exactly?‚Äù I said, my voice thin and rusty. ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt told me anything. At all.‚Äù

Scary Sherri sighed. ‚ÄúYou never did like when I sugarcoated things,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre dead, Diana. And so are all of those souls on the shores.‚Äù

I wished that I could have been surprised, but instead, I felt as though a large weight had been lifted from my chest. ‚ÄúBummer,‚Äù I said, reaching toward the water, wondering what it felt like.

Scary Sherri swooped down and grabbed my wrist before my fingertips made contact, shaking her head. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch it,‚Äù she said harshly.

I frowned. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôll claim you.‚Äù

I rolled my eyes, growing more and more frustrated by Scary Sherri‚Äôs non-answers. ‚ÄúSherri--or Sharon, I guess--*where am I?* Is this hell? You said you weren‚Äôt a demon.‚Äù

Scary Sherri, much to my surprise, giggled quite amusedly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a ferryman.‚Äù

My brow furrowed as I looked up at her. ‚ÄúSharon‚Ä¶ you mean like‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said with a nod, pleased with my understanding.

I looked back down at the water, realization beginning to wash over me. ‚ÄúSo you knew that I‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù Scary Sherri murmured, pushing her pole gracefully through the water once again. ‚ÄúI told you, I‚Äôm not lucky in the mortal realm. Souls only approach me when their time is close. They know that their current cycle is ending, and they remember to come to me when the time comes. I give them coins so they can pass‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not much, since I can only help so many of them, but He doesn‚Äôt want me handing out coins all willy nilly. The Underworld has been at capacity for centuries, and it‚Äôs better to keep some souls waiting on the shores. Even if it pains me to hear them cry, day in and day out.‚Äù

A heavy silence fell between us. I dragged my fingers along the soft wood below me, biting my lip.

‚ÄúYour parents?‚Äù I inquired, lowering my head. ‚ÄúAnd your adoptive parents? Doug?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was born to my parents because their time was nearest,‚Äù Scary Sherri sighed. ‚ÄúMy adoptive parents came to me because they were so close as well. Same with Doug. With all of them.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou just follow them around,‚Äù I mumbled, my motionless heart somehow still managing to sink. ‚ÄúWith me, you just‚Ä¶?‚Äù

Scary Sherri chuckled quietly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve explained this to you a dozen times, and I‚Äôll explain it again,‚Äù she said, sounding almost entertained. ‚ÄúI have always found your soul. And I will always find it, over and over again. Until your cycles have run their course, I will be waiting for you with a coin in my pocket.‚Äù

I lifted my head, looking into Scary Sherri‚Äôs skeletal face, the gold orbs deep in her eye sockets. ‚ÄúYou--?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is the ninth time I‚Äôve had you on my ferry,‚Äù she said wistfully. ‚ÄúStop being a little shit in the mortal realm, and maybe you‚Äôll finally get your second entrance into Elysium. I‚Äôve got my fingers crossed this time--your last cycle got you into Elysium, and since you wanted to be a social worker in this cycle, I bet They‚Äôll vote favorably. You were even blessed with Artemis' name--that‚Äôs gotta show for something. Just one more cycle, babe. Just one more.‚Äù

I met Scary Sherri‚Äôs eyes, bursting with questions, but she simply shook her head and lowered her pole into the water once again. The hushed sound of water lapping against silt had filled my ears once again, and she leaned down to kiss my forehead, a smile on her lips.

‚ÄúGo,‚Äù she breathed. ‚ÄúBe cleansed. I‚Äôll be waiting for you no matter what They vote.‚Äù

As the sound of tired voices and barking dogs filled my ears, a sense of familiarity washed over me, and I nodded all of my uncertainty away. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù

Sharon‚Äôs smile widened, and she put my gold coin between her teeth, winking at me. ‚ÄúGood luck.‚Äù

The new girl came into our class in early October, a particularly strange time to enroll, which was the first strike against her. The teacher bounced up from her seat the greet the new student, but the nervous young girl shrank away from her, rumpling her hair into her face.

‚ÄúEveryone, we have a new student today,‚Äù the counselor said, grouchy and dry as ever. ‚ÄúSay hello to Miss Zoe McAdams.‚Äù

‚ÄúHi,‚Äù the girl whispered without lifting her gaze from the ground.

The class droned a monotonous greeting at Zoe slipped toward her desk, the eyes of fourteen students following her all the way across the room. I watched her carefully, my heart pounding as she sat in the chair next to mine.

""Zoe?"" I whispered, nudging her shoe with my own. ""We're seat buddies now.""

Zoe glanced in my direction, tucking her hair farther into her face. ""Okay,"" she said uncertainly. ""What's on your arm?""

I looked down at my wrist, prodding the pomegranate I'd tattooed on myself a few weeks prior. ""A tattoo,"" I said. ""Did it all by myself.""

""Cool,"" Zoe murmured. ""I love pomegranates.""

""Really? Me too!"" I said, ignoring the way the teacher glared at me. ""Wanna come over after school? I can read you my super secret story, if you wanna hear it, since we're seat buddies.""

Zoe nodded. ""Okay. That sounds neat. Thanks, um... what's your name?""

""Sherri,"" I said, a smile splitting my face in half. ""My name's Sherri. And you're totally gonna love this story. I just know it.""

A while back, I walked away from a girl who meant so much to me. At the time, I told myself it was the right decision. Maybe I was scared, maybe I thought I needed space, maybe I didn‚Äôt fully realize how rare it is to find someone who truly sees you. But ever since I left, she hasn‚Äôt left my mind.

It‚Äôs not just missing her presence. It‚Äôs missing the way she laughed at the smallest things, the way being with her felt like home, the way she made me want to be better without ever asking me to. I‚Äôve dated before, but nothing has ever come close to the connection I felt with her. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it was real, and now I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I let something special slip away.

I don‚Äôt want to come across as weak or desperate, but I also don‚Äôt want pride to stop me from trying. I want her to know she‚Äôs still in my heart, that I regret leaving, and that if there‚Äôs even the smallest chance, I‚Äôd love to show her I‚Äôm serious about us.

We have a very, problematic relationship, and I (F 23yr) have always been told that I have a lot of patience in dealing with my mother, I have put up with it for nearly all my life. 

I am worried about today though, since I usually always disassociate when M starts getting upset at me. So I heat up the food, and go sit down after a long day of work and school. I came home to finish my hw right away and start having everything prepped. The food was warming up, and I sit down and turn on the fan. BIG MISTAKE! She got so f* upset about the fan not being ""exactly"" how she wanted it. She kept gesturing to it and looking at me, I got so confused. I got up to move it, she got more upset, called me F* stupid and ran to her bed you know angry crying after turning off the TV, I just went back to finish cleaning the kitchen. She came back out upset I hadnt followed her to apologize for the fan and said I had no common sense and that I had to just know she wanted me to move the fan exactly to how its supposed to be. I said I can't read her mind, that she actually needs to speak up to SAY things. This upset her more. While she kept going I still had my bowl and spoon in my hand, stuck in that one place as she kept going at it. 

Now, instead of disassociating like normal. I got mad. Very mad and hadnt noticed I had broken tbe spoon, metal soup spoon in half with one hand until I looked down. She didn't notice, but whatever that problems still going, added to the thousands of things that are my fault, that I am to quote her 'retarded' at ( I mean no offense at all, that is just what she calls me) and that makes her eternally disappointed. That's never going to change, I realized that 3 years ago. While some parts of my life are going better, me finally being independent ij sown things and doing things I want to do, like going to buy myself a coffee. 

Im making this too long sorry, I just got worried at the fact that I thought about using the spoon against her. And the fact that I got so mad I BROKE A METAL SPOON IN HALF with one hand, that actually shocked me out of the dangerous thinking spiral of using the spoon. So yeah. Sorry just wanted to vent...

The TAX PAYERS PAY FOR YOUR RENT because you are a loser who is capable getting off your azz and working but you milk a learning disability. We pay taxes and bums like you take advantage of the system and get free money.  With out taxpayers paying in, you would be SCREWED and your acting big and bad like you pay bills hahahaha show me all the money you don't have.....you are a charity case you beg for money online mooch be so for real  

Funny you didn't address the m0aning and groaning over the food, you are sitting outside being recorded with your eyes shut & acting like this is food p0rn. Its gross and weird. Why exactly are you opening your legs and sticking your tongue out? it's giving predator but your use to looking like that huh  but I don't expect less from someone who tricks for treats at the group home lol 

 I said your doctor said to reduce the sodium in your diet and you haven't changed jack sh!t dummy, Go to your health portal and I want you to load photos on there of everything you eat from pizza ranch,  the tower of mac n cheese with cheeto's on top. the Starbucks sugar induced coffee, bacon sandwich, and all the other junk food you stuff your face with and let me know if that doctor tells you that is healthy. You are so stupid I bet you have not even googled what you should be eating 

I made a point that everyone who buys you food are enablers and they are! If you don't like it call the cops cry baby! You make yourself look worse every time

 I was listing off everyone who is always buying you food and you correct me on who bought it  I KNOW YOU DIDN'T BUY YOUR OWN FOOD BUM YOU NEVER DO!!!  the common denominator here is that YOU did not pay for any of the food, that was my entire POINT and you just prove my point because you're an idiot  

Stick to going off in the comments and not making long videos of you rambling.... you're going to give normal people a stroke having to listen to your first grade reading level, it takes lightyears for you to get through one paragraph. You can't even say BACON or ENABLER yikessss living off the health care system maybe go book some speech therapy classes.

I went to the store planning to grab some cereal and bread. On my way in, a homeless guy came up and asked if I could buy him a coffee.

In his book ""American Crusade"" he wrote in 2020: ""Our American crusade does not take place with real swords, and our fight is not with firearms. Not yet.""He is the only cabinet member in the service on this day in July. But he is just one of many in Trump's environment who belong to the world of extremist Christians and share a goal: to place America under Bible dictation.

# The visitors of this premiere service, most young, almost all white, mostly rich in children, are chosen polite. They welcome guests in their midst, as long as they follow certain rules (""no photos, no recordings""). They mildly ignore the two demonstrators outside on the street, their curses (""We curse you!"") penetrate muffled into this improvised whitewashed prayer room with two oversized US flags. And they nod satfully when Pastor Jared Longshore, blue jacket, blue and yellow bow, prophesies a kind of turning point in his sermon.His church will do what is done to save Washington from those who would rather listen to themselves than the Almighty. A pastor colleague has already announced that feminism and homosexuality will be attacked in this sinful city. Now Longshore says: ""For us, worship is warfare - and that's exactly what we mean."" He says: ""Christ or chaos,"" Washington has the choice. The city is¬†[a swamp.](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/donald-trump-will-verbrennen-der-usa-flagge-mit-haft-bestrafen-a-cdb88cc8-f67a-48f3-8713-899af7ec0ad0)¬†Christ Church has come to dry him out.



There is no shortage of churches in the capital of the USA. Around 800 places of prayer are available for the more than 700,000 inhabitants. In almost every street there is one, often hardly distinguishable from simple residential buildings. However, Christ Church, the newest addition and part of a widely branched global network called the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches, is a special church in many ways.

Like God's Berserker, Wilson ritually rails against the equality of men and women. But so be it, the frequent writer wrote: ""The man penetrates, conquers, colonizes, sows. The woman receives, surrenders, accepts.""The alleged¬†[over-alienation of America](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/usa-der-grosse-abschiebe-zirkus-des-donald-trump-a-ac2e9c47-43d7-4954-846e-b62e7b2df0d3)¬†by non-Protestants is for Wilson infrevel. He wants to prohibit access to public offices for in practice or to encourage them to self-deportation, as he recently said on a video show. In¬†[slavery¬†](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/donald-trump-attackiert-smithsonian-erneut-heftig-a-518ec99e-712d-456f-b4d1-f310430fe031)he may not only recognize reprehensible things, sometimes they have led to ""real affection between the races"". The American Civil War, which has ended since 1865, Wilson does not yet consider it to be final.Occasionally, the man of God from Idaho shoots religious advertising clips in which he flares Disney characters and other symbols of a supposedly decadent way of life with a Havana cigar in his mouth and a flamethrower strapped. He leaves little doubt about his goals: Douglas Wilson wants an ""American theocracy"" - a country in which biblical law applies. Nothing else.

While until a few years ago, this was considered rather a delusion of Christian weirdos, a remarkable tectonic shift can be observed in Donald Trump's America. Without having significantly relativized any of his beliefs, Douglas Wilson has become from Maverick to the idol of many Christian nationalists - a politically and religiously far-right movement, in whose idea America was created exclusively by and for Protestant Christians.For about a year, Wilson has been passed around as a star guest on podies, podcasts and conferences of the Trump cosmos. The foundation of a Wilson's church within throw from the Capitol is therefore not only an act of divine charity. It is a declaration of war - and one of many indications of how close fundamentalist believers are¬†[under Donald Trump](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/donald-trump-warum-ihn-seine-anhaenger-als-gesandten-gottes-sehen-a-43164ecd-847f-436a-845c-7c8432455c82)¬†have moved to the heart chamber of the world power USA.

# Strange Bible Interpretation

The not just known as God-fearing 47. The US president has brought a large number of his, as he says, ""glorful Christians"" into the innermost circle of power. They sit at the head of ministries and federal authorities, on ambassador posts and top judge chairs and have often softened the commandment of the separation of state and church.And Trump's Christians are not just any Christians. Like Pentagon chief Hegseth, many of them adhere to the belief that the Bible, and only the Bible, must be the measure of all spiritual and secular things. Whereby Christian nationalists bend the Holy Scriptures at will in such a way that it allegedly also¬†justifies misogyny,¬†[gay and lesbian hostility](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/usa-supreme-court-erlaubt-fehlen-bei-lgbtqi-inhalten-im-unterricht-a-d0322d34-049e-4356-8c87-f6182184c717), sheer¬†[racism¬†](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/rassismus/)and white fantasies of superiority.

Among them is the influencer¬†[Charlie Kirk](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/charlie-kirk/), who was killed in an assassination attempt in Arizona in mid-September¬†and had intoxicated countless young Americans with his right-wing religious and right-wing extremist views until his death.He will now bring God back to everyday life ""like never before"", Trump promised last Sunday in front of around 90,000 people at Kirk's memorial service in Arizona, which increasingly resembled an evangelical recruitment fair. Members of Trump's administration announced that they would act with ""just anger"" against ""left-wing extremists"" who claim to have identified them as the backers of the murder. According to Trump's deputy chief of staff, the ""powers of evil"" will be eliminated.""A dangerous, authoritarian political theology has taken control of one of our two major parties,"" warns religious scholar Robert Jones, founder of the non-profit Public Religion Research Institute in Washington. Trump's administration is on a ""militant mission"" to make the country ""a white Christian America"", says Jones. And the question is whether the president understands what forces he has unleashed in his second term.The idea of making America a God-sadating state is as old as the New World. Even today, Christian nationalists in the USA refer to a papal bull by Alexander VI from 1493. The Christian religion should be ""spread everywhere"" and for this purpose ""barbaric peoples"" should be subdued. The pious European settlers then did a lot of work in the name of God, subjogated the Terra incognita and slaughtered indigenous peoples.

# Savior Trump

However, a continent governed exclusively by biblical law always remained a distant dream, especially after the first constitution of the United States of America was adopted in 1788. This explicitly prohibits the evocation of a state religion.Even in the recent past, nothing seemed like a theocracy on American soil could ever become a reality. In the early 1990s, around 90 percent of US citizens still called themselves Christians, their share fell to just over 60 percent 30 years later.

Last year, the Public Religion Research Institute asked Americans, among other things, if they agreed with the statement that the government should declare the United States a purely Christian nation, that a true American is a Christian, and that US laws should be based on biblical values. Only three out of ten people fully or overwhelmingly agreed. But:¬†[Among Republicans](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/donald-trumps-notstand-in-washington-d-c-das-naechste-troepfchen-gift-a-630d7e19-1a1d-4a30-9d5c-afc983a82006)¬†There were 53, 65 percent among white evangelicals.

# Fight against ""demonocrats""

Trump is ""God's chaos candidate"", the Texan TV preacher Lance Wallnau, one of the best connected evangelicals in the country, had already written in 2016. He had been anointed by the Almighty for a ""special purpose"". At first, many Christian nationalists still doubted this, the cursing, arrogant money screet from New York seemed too profane to them. But the alternative - a supposedly all-equalizing, ""woke"", anti-man and anti-white politics - was apparently even more frightening. 77 percent of all white evangelicals finally voted for Trump. Eight years later, it was 81 [percent.Today](http://percent.Today), countless Trump supporters are convinced that he has been sent to them to smash the ""demonocrats"" and their devilishly liberal worldview.

When the New York multi-billionaire began to warm up for a second term, various think tanks were already tinkering with meticulous plans for the Trump 2.0 era in the background in order to rule out similar chaos as in the first edition. This is how, under the leadership of the nationalist Heritage Foundation, also¬†[""Project 2025""¬†](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/donald-trumps-100-tage-bilanz-was-der-us-praesident-bisher-erreicht-hat-und-was-nicht-a-caa64c21-19b4-4687-9385-63bfaed4d65d)was created.¬†, a blueprint for the authoritarian transformation of the USA into a secluded, proto-American, biblically influenced nation.The Christian nationalists among the creators of ""Project 2025"" - and these were quite a few - imagined a country in which the Christian-Evangelical family led by a patriarch is the focus,¬†[abortion is¬†](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/schwangerschaftsabbruch/)prohibited and homosexuality is ostracized.

In short: a country that replaces knowledge with faith, as if the¬†[Enlightenment had¬†](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/aufklaerung/)never existed.

# Not pious, but radical

""All sectors of society are to be brought under God's control according to this idea,"" says historian and book author Kristin Kobes Du Mez. This applies not only to religion, but also to politics, education, economy, family, media and the arts.All this sounds less pious than radical. It is an attempt to turn the wheel back decades, if not centuries - to a time when men were still men and solved conflicts in their own way: with trust in God and revolvers. Jesus and Jesse James. It is an attempt to resurrect an original American myth. The emphatically masculine right-winger response to an identity policy from the left, which is perceived as feminine and morally sour. And the attempt¬†to eliminate¬†the¬†[democratic rule of law](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/leute/john-legend-sieht-usa-in-autoritaeres-regierungssystem-abgleiten-a-2cc865fb-a10b-4b4b-b340-0781cf5c65b0).Trump claims to have nothing to do with Project 2025. But: He immediately prepared the way for almost every one of these ideas after his choice. Seen through the Christian-fundamentalist glasses, his political drum fire of the first months, the raids against migrants, the attacks on schools and universities, the redistribution in favor of the rich, the revenge campaign against political opponents are not pure arbitrariness. They systematically serve to create a godly state - or what the supposedly Bible faithful think to be.

# God's cleaner

Does he believe in what he does? Or is the religious leader just another role in the inexhaustible reservoir of Donald Trump?Without the votes of the Bible fanatics, he would probably never have won the election. Trump was almost forced to serve himself to them in time as God's cleaner. Already in February 2024, he said at an election campaign with religious radio makers that Christianity was ""the most important thing that this country lacks, the most important thing!"". Once in office, he will promote ""pro-God content"" in all decisions.Long before MAGA, Trump had found a kind of god. A quarter of a century ago he met the television-loving ""Televangelist"" Paula White, whom he later¬†[made his ""spiritual advisor"".](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/video/trumps-spirituelle-beraterin-betet-gegen-daemonische-sender-video-99027884.html)¬†She believes in the ""Prosority Gospel"", according to which¬†[empires like Trump](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/usa-donald-trump-nimmt-den-armen-und-gibt-den-reichen-der-anti-robin-hood-a-0c192c0f-8d29-4f34-bc37-986f9a41bbe3)¬†must be especially high in God's favor. She also speaks ""in tongues"" or prays for miscarriages ""of all satanic pregnancies"". She is said to have a great influence on Trump.  
  
He staged himself more and more often via digital media as a sacred figure of light, who alone could save America from ruin. And if something jumped out for him, all the better: His ""God Bless the USA"" Bible finds a raging sale. It costs $60 a piece.Since the bullet¬†[of an assassin¬†](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/donald-trump-attentat-us-senatsausschuss-attestiert-secret-service-gravierende-maengel-a-b3ff0690-6cba-4024-b51e-0c20c70f2bd8)only touched¬†him during a campaign appearance in Pennsylvania in September 2024,¬†but did not seriously injure him, Trump seems finally convinced that he is a new Messiah. The self-exaltation culminated in his speech at the inauguration in January: ""My life was spared for good reasons. I was saved by God to make America great again.""Mummy dance or megalomania? Maybe both.

# Bible fidelity in the highest state offices

The pace at which Trump has since pierced the partition between the state and the church is breathtaking. With one of his first decrees, the 47. US president in February the White House Faith Office, which is primarily intended to fight ""anti-Christian and anti-Semitic prejudices"". His boss: his leader of the faith Paula White. When Trump had lunch with more than 60 business bosses in mid-July for the sake of good faith, White rejoiced: ""President Trump not only makes America affordable, prosperous and strong again - he also puts faith back in the center.""During a ""National Prayer Breakfast"" Trump announced that he would authorize the Department of Justice to prosecute ""anti-Christian violence and vandalism"" with the full severity of the law. Recently, he allowed federal authorities to pray and even proselytiate again.""My life was spared for good reasons. I was saved by God to make America great again.""Donald Trump, US PresidentGovernment employees, according to the regulation, should ""convince others of the correctness of their religious attitude"". Christianity is not explicitly mentioned in the directive, apparently with regard to the constitution. But everyone knows that this does not mean Mohammed's teachings first - especially since Trump has long placed his eager Christians everywhere.This also applies to some of the highest offices in the state. As in his first term, President¬†[Russell Vought](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/donald-trump-vs-fed-chef-jerome-powell-rufmoerder-im-dienste-des-praesidenten-a-c49a7a49-4b0c-4194-94e8-415a1b88aa63)¬†to the head of its budget office and thus to the head of the White House. Vought is one of the architects of the ¬ªProject 2025¬´ and himself a declared Christian nationalist. His greatest concern is the ongoing oppression of Americans by ""climate change extremists"" and ""awoke militants"".

# Overlap with Jewish settlers

Another Christian nationalist, former presidential candidate¬†[Mike Huckabee](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/mike-huckabee-us-senat-bestaetigt-ihn-als-botschafter-in-israel-a-0059a2bb-5ffa-47c2-a05b-63e9babbef85), sent Trump to Jerusalem as his ambassador. Many evangelicals maintain financial and political ties with radical Jewish settlers in the West Bank. They believe that the second return of Christ can only take place when all Jews have returned to the Holy Land.

Huckabee has not yet thought of¬†condemning¬†Israel's alleged war crimes in the¬†[Gaza Strip](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/gaza_streifen/). On the contrary: he rigorously denied the hunger crisis in Gaza. Years ago, Huckabee had already made it known that ""such a thing as Palestinians do not really exist"".A friend of Huckabee - and Trump - is the evangelical businessman Johnnie Moore, who calls himself a Christian Zionist. He is the head of a Christian advertising agency that, among other things, has promoted Ark Encounter in Kentucky: a fundamental Christian amusement park in the belly of a supposedly original, 155 meter long Noah's Ark.Since June, Moore has also led the¬†[Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/gaza-seit-ende-mai-sollen-1-373-palaestinenser-bei-der-suche-nach-nahrung-getoetet-worden-sein-a-bcb9cc75-f314-42e2-a611-a43d20ee684d)¬†The private US organization, which works closely with Israel's army, is supposed to provide the Palestinians in the devastated coastal strip with the essentials. Near the four distribution centers of the GHF, more than 850 people waiting for food died, most of them shot by the Israeli army, which led a senior UN official to comment that the distribution points were ""sadistic death traps"".

# Minister of Defence of the Faith

One of the most ardent Christian fanatics is Trump's ""Minister of War"" Pete Hegseth, who can now always pray with like-minded people since the church to which he belongs opened a house of worship in Washington. Only recently[,¬†](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/pete-hegseth-us-verteidigungsminister-teilt-video-mit-inhalten-gegen-frauenwahlrecht-a-bd87f51d-8d11-4115-acf7-5be7438ef78d)Hegseth released¬†[a video¬†](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/pete-hegseth-us-verteidigungsminister-teilt-video-mit-inhalten-gegen-frauenwahlrecht-a-bd87f51d-8d11-4115-acf7-5be7438ef78d)on Platform X¬†in which his, as he says, ""mentor"" Douglas Wilson calls for the abolition of women's suffrage. Hegseth had his evangelical house pastor from Tennessee fly in to Washington for services in the Pentagon.Former Fox News host Hegseth¬†[has a certain enthusiasm for ¬ªCrusaders¬´](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/geschichte/donald-trump-nominiert-pete-hegseth-haben-seine-tattoos-eine-rechtsradikale-botschaft-a-4089ba46-1d46-480f-84ff-0104a92646db)¬†. His steeled body, which he used to show often and gladly, is adorned by tattoos of an AR-15 rifle, two crossed muskets, a Jerusalem cross and the saying ""Deus vult"" (God wills it), with which medieval crusaders once went into battle.The strange mixing of Catholic symbols with evangelical sentiment does not necessarily have to be an oversight. In view of the reduced total number of Christians in the USA, there have been attempts for decades to bridge the theological-ideological trenches. In 1994, for example, the ecumenical paper ¬ªEvangelicals and Catholics Together¬´ caused a stir. Scientists assume that the efforts have recently borne fruit. ""We see more and more unity across the Christian currents,"" says historian Kobes Du Mez. ""They're all raming together for a common cause.""

# The Role of JD Vance

An interesting figure in this context is Trump's¬†[Vice President JD Vance](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/jd-vance-und-pete-hegseth-proteste-in-washington-beim-besuch-bei-der-nationalgarde-a-0c815ed2-5bd1-4914-8d10-10f68f004947), a former atheist who only found a Catholic faith in 2019, but maintains connections to the ultra-nationalist Protestant camp.During the 2024 election campaign, for example, one of the most popular currents of the Christian nationalist camp, the New Apostolic Reformation, organized so-called Courage Tours throughout the country: a kind of political-religious iterant circus of self-appointed prophets and apostles who called on their thousands of listeners to join the ""God's Army"" and ""prepare for a war"". In Monroeville, Pennsylvania, the evangelical initiators welcomed a special star guest shortly before the election: the Catholic¬†[JD Vance](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/j-d-vance/).

Not everyone on Trump's team is so obviously flirting with a Christian nationalist ideology. But it is striking how much other high-ranking Republicans also show off their religiosity. For example, Mike Johnson,¬†[the majority leader¬†](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/big-beautiful-bill-us-republikaner-treiben-donald-trumps-steuergesetz-im-senat-voran-a-7e8dd5bb-d5cf-4489-bc4f-20858e996d23)in the House of Representatives and formally the third most powerful person in the state,¬†says¬†that he gets his ""worldview"" from the Bible. In the Capitol, the heart of the oldest still existing democracy in the world, he once had himself photographed kneeling while praying with his [colleagues.In](http://colleagues.In) front of his office stands a supposedly inconspicuous flag with green pine on a white background and the inscription ""An Appeal to Heaven"". It originally comes from the War of Independence and is considered a hallmark of Christian nationalists.[¬†Samuel Alito](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/usa-supreme-court-erlaubt-fehlen-bei-lgbtqi-inhalten-im-unterricht-a-d0322d34-049e-4356-8c87-f6182184c717), one of the most controversial judges at the Supreme Court and opponent of abortion and marriage for all,¬†had¬†already waved¬†the same flag¬†in front of his private home in 2023.Trump's Minister of Justice Pam Bondi, who has to supervise the separation of state and church in office, was pleased to hold the first hearing of a government commission on religious freedom in the private Bible museum in Washington in June. Founded in 2017, the house is a ""poil for Christian nationalists"", according to research by the ¬ªNew York Times¬´.At the same place, Trump announced his ""America Prays"" initiative in early September and called on all compatriots to intercede together so that the nation can celebrate its 250th birthday. Birthday will be strong and prosperous next year. At the same time, he promised to enforce a ""right to pray"" in public schools. Also probably part of his recently expressed plan to ""get to heaven"".

# ""Ministry of Penance and Holiness""

How shameless Trump's Republican partisans now walk between the worlds could be observed at the end of June at the Washington Hilton. There, Jesus freaks, Trump enthusiasts and businessmen, officials, dignitaries, miracle healers frolicked in windowless rooms for a weekend. At a stand, caps with the inscription ""Jesus Is My Savior, Trump Is My President"" received great attention. Right next to it, a self-proclaimed ""Ministry of Penance and Holiness"" announced pigeons who can hear again and women who have died without a uterus. One floor below, a pastor announced: ""We are not democrats, we are Bible crats.""

Invited to this bizarre fair of credulity was the arch-conservative Faith & Freedom Coalition, which¬†was founded¬†in 2009 out of self-defense against the alleged¬†[Beelzebub Barack Obama¬†](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/donald-trump-laesst-offenbar-portraets-der-bushs-und-von-barack-obama-umhaengen-a-2bf3c0a1-4149-4a00-969d-6b59755e1b93)and serves as a lubricant between republican right-wingers and evangelicals. The greeting to the conference was adequately sober: ""The devil works overtime to make up for lost ground. That is why we must mobilize more Christians than ever before.‚ÄùOn the podium during these three hellish days in the capital: US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Trump's top¬†[border guard Tom Homan](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/los-angeles-militaereinsatz-soll-macht-von-donald-trump-konsolidieren-a-7243ed86-d17e-45be-917e-9bc93100c9ec)¬†, Senators¬†[Ted Cruz¬†](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/ted_cruz/)and¬†[Lindsey Graham](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/lindsey-graham/), Trump's former press secretary, representatives of the White House Faith Office and many others who have been sitting on Washington's shifters since January.

# An anti-democratic movement

What Christian nationalists spread with increasing self-evidentness is ""absolutely incompatible with our democracy,"" says the religious researcher Jones. And not only because the ideology glorifies white heterosexual men as God-given rulers. Other beliefs of the Bible fanatics could also be made it impossible to agree with a free society - including the exclusion of entire population and religious groups, the denial of racism or homophobia.Above all, however, Jones is concerned that political conflicts in Trump's America would no longer be fought out as a civilized competition of ideas, but ""as apocalyptic battles between good and evil"". This could tempt you to no longer want to defeat political rivals at the ballot box, ""but by locking them up, driving them out or even killing them,"" says Jones, whose book ""White Too Long"" about racism in Christian nationalist circles¬†was removed from the US Naval Academy¬†at the instigation of the¬†[Pentagon](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/pentagon/).  
  
And although the right-wing Christian seducers always emphasize that they meant only a spiritual struggle with their bellicistic oas of war and battles, Jones says: ""Our polls have shown that Christian nationalists twice as often as others think that political violence could be justified under the circumstances.""

# The Christian Storm of the Capitol

Where this can lead, the¬†[6th¬†](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/sturm-auf-das-us-kapitol/)showed by way of example.[¬†January 2021,¬†](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/sturm-auf-das-us-kapitol/)when a mob in the belief that the Savior Trump had been cheated for his election victory, the¬†[Capitol in Washington](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/donald-trump-warum-seine-waehler-eine-politik-gegen-ihre-eigenen-interessen-unterstuetzen-a-c3b592f2-b9b4-4dc7-ab53-020745981d5e)¬†Stormed. Among them, many unleashed people who knelt down before their march, asked God for help and then hunted Trump opponents with waving flags - including the ""Appeal to Heaven"" flag.

In the delusions of the apocalyptics, it was a kind of exorcism. In fact, it was the first transfer of power accompanied by violence in the history of the United States. Amazingly enough: While there are numerous indications that the storming of the Capitol was essentially shaped and orchestrated by Christian fanatics at the time, this aspect almost completely fell under the table in the official investigation report. Trump has now pardoned a large part of those involved.God's work apparently also believed to be done by the father of five, Vance Luther B., when he¬†shot a Democratic politician and her husband¬†[in Minnesota in¬†](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/news-des-tages-israel-iran-krieg-gewalt-in-den-usa-jeff-bezos-hochzeit-a-669488c4-7729-4655-8473-813c28235395)mid-June. It was probably only intended as a prelude to a long slaughter. Investigators later found a list of dozens of names of possible victims on the [57-year-old.As](http://57-year-old.As) is now known, B. studied at a Bible college, whose evangelical founder once demanded that every Christian should speak at least one ""violent prayer"", a prayer of violence, a day. Later, the man moved to the¬†[Democratic Republic of Congo¬†](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/demokratische_republik_kongo/)for a while, where he condemned abortion and homosexuality as a guest preacher, among other things. After the bloodshed of Minnesota, he texted his children: ""Dad went to war tonight.""Trump and his family treated the double murder as no more than a petitness. There was no shouting, no speech. When asked why he didn't let the flags hang at half-mast at federal authorities, the US president replied: ""For whom?"" Three months later, however, after the right-wing extremist Charlie Kirk had been murdered in a similarly tragic way, Trump participated in the front row in the de facto canonization of the ""martyr, who had openly preached xenophobic, misogynistic and queerphobic throughout his life.  
  
God willing?

It takes a very idiosyncratic interpretation of the Bible to justify what the predominantly white Christian nationalists demand and sometimes do in Trump's religiously whipped America. Why some researchers speak of ""shoom Christianity"", which coats an extremist worldview with a believing robe.

# Test Laboratory of Theocrats

In¬†[Trump's America](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/donald-trump-und-der-kampf-gegen-amerikas-minderheiten-gehoeren-wir-noch-dazu-a-50133cf1-204c-4acc-b9c7-904091dd8d83)¬†However, this form of exclusive piety has long been on the rise. May less radical currents have difficulty filling their churches on Sundays - many of the nationalistic sols do not have these worries. This is perhaps nowhere better to see than 4000 kilometers west of Washington, D. C., in the wasteland of Idaho, where the flame-throwing preacher Douglas Wilson is already well advanced on his way to an American [theocracy.Moscow](http://theocracy.Moscow) is a tidy, artistic place with cute wooden houses, where you could shoot new episodes of the cult series ¬ªThe Waltons¬´ at any time. The extensive university town with its more than 25,000 inhabitants is located on the edge of the Palouse, a gentle hilly landscape in the northwestern USA, which was once a prairie and is now a large carpet of wheat. Interrupted only by the 1500 meter high Moscow Mountain and one or the other human settlement. Moscow is the largest of them in the state of Idaho. The river that meanders through is called Paradise Creek.

On a Sunday in July, there is a lively coming and going on the northeastern edge of the town. Hundreds of people, mostly young families with three, four, five children, stroll through a huge parking lot in the direction of a simple brick church, which is large, but not big enough for the crowd of those willing to pray - which is why three services are celebrated this morning. Right next to the church, between piled up sand hills, there are wooden pallets and bricks, excavators, concrete mixers and a large shell with a column portal. On a sign it can be seen that he will become the heart of a huge new school town with manicured lawn and fountains. A football field with a grandstand is already ready. Strangers who linger around here ask a very friendly security man if he can help. He drinks from a thermo mug with¬†[Trump portrait](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/nato-gipfel-seelenmassage-fuer-trump-als-strategie-zum-erfolg-a-eba8e064-bcc1-4684-a554-f5c6fe5fe119)¬†and the inscription ""Best Dad Ever"".

# From the cradle to the stretcher

This is the ""Logos"" construction area, the latest expansion of what some call ""Doug Wilson's Empire"". Which is hardly exaggerated. In the 50 years since the ex-soldier settled here, he has not been inactive. The Christian Church leader founded five churches in Moscow and the surrounding area alone, and three more are planned. In total, the umbrella organization Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches maintains around 160 places of worship in the USA, Europe, Australia and [Asia.Here](http://Asia.Here) in Idaho, Wilson has also built a Christian school, a Christian college, and a Christian publishing house. He has published countless theological writings, children's books and books of poetry there. He distributes his messages through his own streaming service, his own podcast, his own YouTube channel. His parishioners, he calls them ""Kirker"", own galleries, theaters, office buildings, pubs, restaurants and shops for daily needs.If you want, you can live in Moscow from the cradle to the ley exclusively in a Christ-Church world.

And that's what many want, says Wilson, when he asks for a conversation in his office in downtown the day after the triple service. 3000 Kirkers meanwhile lived in Moscow, many of them ""fled from the repressive, tyrannical dictates"" of so-called democratic US states. To him, to Moscow, where in the meantime ""the essential elements of a truly Christian community"" are present. An ""experiment"" is that which runs a beta test in Idaho, possibly to repeat it at some point on a larger scale. Wilson is satisfied with the results so far: ¬ªGod is kind.¬´

# Schools as ""ammunition factories""

And as he sits there in jeans and a denim shirt, in a tiny office full of books, a portrait of the Scottish primeval presbyterian John Knox and a Gary Larson cartoon calendar, Wilson has nothing of that Bible berserer that you know him from his videos. Admittedly, this is ""a bit polemical,"" says the 72-year-old almost shyly.He seems to wonder that he is suddenly a sought-after man and his ideas have become courtable. He knows who he owes it to: ""Donald Trump's presidency is like Christmas every day for me."" Not that he likes everything Trump does. But: ""He's like chemotherapy. It's poisonous, but it kills the cancer faster than it kills you.If it continues like this, the one religion, secularism, will really be replaced by a better one ‚Äì its own. ""Protestant Christianity is in our DNA,"" says Wilson. Therefore, America must again be populated predominantly by Protestants and perhaps ""by a handful of Catholics and a handful of Jews"". Just as it used to be, perhaps, once. The rest should be evangelized or disappear.

Wilson has patience. And he has access to more than 500 educational institutions nationwide through the Association of Classical Christian Schools, which he co-founded, he calls them ""ammunition factories"". They are his best bet on the future. In Moscow, more than every third child is already raised Christian. Something is growing. Violence is not necessary, he rejects it - unless ""for defense"".

# A city is afraid

If you listen to Wilson like that, you could almost believe that in Moscow everything is going its peaceful and - may I write this? - evolutionary way. If it weren't for people like Sarah Bader, who says, ""Moscow has fallen. Wilson has crippled this city."" Bader herself was a student in Christ Church's ""Ammunition Factory"" before she was suspended at the age of 13 because she¬†had criticized¬†the smeal of¬†[slavery¬†](https://archive.is/o/Ga6pF/https://www.spiegel.de/thema/sklaverei/)there. As a result, she also gave up on her parents and left Moscow, but has since returned to warn against what she calls Wilson's ""extremist cult"".

Bader can tell a lot over a cup of coffee about how Kirker gradually bought up a large part of Moscow's city center. How shop owners in Kirker houses were fired after they criticized the church or organized a fundraising dinner for a food table run by the queer community. As most of them now preferred to be silent in order not to be boycotted by Christian zealous people. Like Moscow, this once so tolerant town - an island in conservative Idaho - is about to capitulate to [fundamentalists.In](http://fundamentalists.In) her podcast ""Sons of Patriarchy"", Bader has made serious accusations against Christ Church, which also deal with multiple mistreatment and abuse of women, which Wilson denies. Bader says she has therefore been threatened anonymously several times. When she wanted to bring the podcast live to Moscow with her fellow fighters, the venue canceled her reservations shortly before. ""This city is afraid,"" says Sarah Bader.And indeed, it is not easy to find someone in Moscow who wants to talk openly about their experiences. The owner of the local comic shop speaks only on the condition that her name is not mentioned. She is lesbian and married, she finally says with moist eyes, it breaks her heart to see queer children of Kirkers in Moscow who have to deny themselves. It is ""not a contradiction to be Christian and lesbian"". She also reports of attempts at intimidation.Once, in protest, she attached a comic page from the fifties to her shop front. There you can see Superman standing in the circle of teenagers and saying: ""Remember, boys and girls, like your school, your country also consists of Americans with different skin color, religion and origin."" Moscow's Kirker would not have liked that.For the faith fanatics, the S on the superhero chest has probably stood for Satan since then.¬†

And time with you just goes by so fast.

Something that was stored away for a long time has finally come due, and Tristan is to retrieve it. He's so busy that he barely has a moment to breathe, so I go in his place.
What I bring back is an old roll of film. The manager warned me that if it wasn‚Äôt developed soon, its age might cause it to be ruined beyond recovery.
But when I have them developed, frame after frame is filled with Winnie Leigh, his first love. Her smile looks so sweet in those pictures that they nearly suffocate me.
What about me, one may ask? I never once appeared on his albums.
The office door slams open. Tristan bursts in, already out of breath. ""Anna, is your life really so empty that you have to dig through mine?""
I turn toward him, the man who's usually so composed. I neither question him nor break down.
Instead, I speak slowly. ""We're getting a divorce.""
Tristan frowns and thrusts the stack of photos into the shredder. He then looks back at me. ""They're gone. Do you still want a divorce?""
A bitter smile tugs at my lips. ""Yes.""


Chapter 1

Impatience flickered in Tristan Spallone's eyes. He yanked at his tie, snapped open his cufflinks, treating me not like his wife but like an opponent he had to bring to heel.
His voice was low, heavy with that familiar pressure that always seemed to shrink me. ""For a handful of old photos? Anna, don't start with me. I don't have time for this.""
""I'm serious,"" I answered evenly, holding his gaze.
Tristan didn't bother with words any longer. He closed the distance between us in a few quick strides.
Towering over me, he caught my chin and tilted my face up to his. His scent and warmth, the same things that had once unraveled me, now wrapped around me like a snare.
""Alright, sweetheart. You've been wanting to get our wedding photos taken, haven't you? We'll go once I get through these next few days.""
It was the same thing again. Every argument, every letdown, always dissolved into that empty promise, as if the words themselves carried a spell strong enough to mend every scar.
Tristan made that promise over and over again, yet not once had he kept it.
I knocked his hand aside and stepped back, forcing space between us.
""No. I don't want anything anymore,"" I said quietly.
The steady chill in my voice snuffed out the last flicker of warmth in his eyes.
""Anna, my patience has limits. Don't threaten me with a divorce. You won't be able to bear the cost.""
Tristan's voice was soft, yet laced with a dangerous edge. He didn't add another word or even spare me another glance. He simply turned on his heel and walked away.
This time, I didn't chase him, didn't clutch at his sleeve, didn't sob and beg him to stay.
I just stood there, staring after him, until his footsteps grew fainter. The sting in my nose began to spread, sharp, hot, and unrelenting.
The photos had only just been developed, and already they lay in shreds. But the face on them was already carved into my memory.
So this was Winnie Leigh. She was beautiful.
I clamped a hand over my mouth to keep from breaking into sobs, but the tears spilled anyway, rolling down my hand like beads from a broken necklace.
Time blurred. I couldn't tell how long I sat there, not until my eyes ran dry and the sobs finally stilled.
I sniffled, picked up my phone, and called my best friend, Lily Ludlow. She was a lawyer.
""Lily, help me draft a divorce agreement.""
On the other end, she hesitated for a few seconds before speaking, her voice heavy with concern. ""A divorce agreement? Anna, are you serious? You love Tristan. Why would you suddenly want to end it?""
""That woman's back. I suppose it's time I stepped aside,"" I murmured.
The line went still. Then, Lily whispered, ""God‚Ä¶ She's really back.""
I hadn't spoken her name. Lily didn't need me to.
Winnie was Tristan's first love. I had never laid eyes on her, yet her name had sat in my heart like an invisible thorn for five long years.
That first winter night after Tristan and I were married was bitterly cold, yet he insisted on working late in the study.
I opened the door with a steaming cup of coffee in hand, and there he was, staring down at an old photograph. His fingers brushed over it with a tenderness so raw that it stole the breath from my chest.
At the sound of my footsteps, he shoved the photo deep into a pile of books, his face gone cold. ""What are you doing here?""
I stopped dead in my tracks, my hands shaking. ""Who is she?""
He held his silence for what felt like forever, as though torn between hiding and confessing. At last, he said in a low, detached voice, ""Winnie Leigh.""
That had been the first time I heard the name, and it became the nightmare I would never escape.
From then on, no matter how soft his words or how kind his gestures, the image of him staring at that photo in the study lingered in my mind. It held a tenderness he'd never once shown me.
Lily asked nothing more. In a careful voice, she promised to prepare the divorce agreement for me.
When I ended the call, I drew in a long breath. This time, I wouldn't foolishly wait for Tristan to open his heart to me.


Chapter 2

By the time I left the office, I felt hollowed out, as if every bit of strength had been drained from me.
When I passed the Spallone clubhouse, grief pressed down on me like a heavy weight.
After days of barely eating, my low blood sugar level sent the world spinning. My vision blurred to black, and I caught myself against the wall by the entrance, barely managing to stay upright.
Just then, a black Bentley I knew too well eased to a stop at the door. Behind the wheel was Tristan. In the passenger seat sat Winnie, her makeup flawless.
Tristan's gaze flicked past me, not stopping for even a beat, as if I were just some random stranger. He yanked the car door open and strode straight into the clubhouse.
I had no idea how much time had passed. Cold sweat was pouring down my face, and I was about to pass out when the clubhouse doors finally swung open again.
Tristan walked out with two bottles of whiskey dangling from his hand. The instant he saw me still standing there with my head down, his brow tightened.
""Come on. Isn't a ride what you were after?""
""I didn't want that,"" I whispered.
He brushed off my words, caught my wrist, and shoved me into the backseat of his car.
""Faking illness now? That's your new trick to bother me? Anna, if you want a ride, call the driver. Don't stand in my way. I don't have time for this.""
He used to always bring me coffee. Out of pure habit, he passed me one of the bottles of whiskey in his hand. I never touched alcohol, so I left it alone. Seeing this, he set it down without a second glance.
A heavy silence settled in the car.
Winnie suddenly turned from her seat in front, flashing me a courteous smile. ""You must be Anna Jovine, huh? Tristan talks about you all the time. I should thank you for looking after him these past few years.""
Her voice carried a thin layer of arrogance, the way a hostess might thank a maid for her service.
Before I could even catch my breath from the sting of it, Winnie laid a hand on her stomach and said, ""Tristan, my period just started. My cramps are killing me.""
Tristan quickly pulled out some painkillers and a heat patch, pressing them into her hand. ""Here. Take these, and put this on your stomach.""
Winnie smiled. ""You've always been the one who looked out for me. I still remember that time we were on business in Sirelia. My period started in the middle of a snowstorm. It was freezing outside, and you kept my stomach warm.""
Tristan answered instantly, as if it were the most natural thing. ""That's just what a gentleman does.""
I curled into the far corner of the backseat, small and out of place. I kept still, listening as they traded stories that belonged only to them‚Äîfrom a snowy night in Sirelia to the sunrise over Mount Astrelle.
I wasn't part of any of it.
Streetlights streamed past the window, one after another, like splashes of whiskey. My eyes drifted to the two bottles Tristan had set on the seat.
Our first date had been in a whiskey bar. I remembered him ordering the fiercest malt they had, sliding the glass toward me with a single push, his gaze shadowed and intense.
""Drink it, and I'll marry you.""
I wasn't a drinker. But that night, I threw the alcohol back in one reckless swallow, not knowing what possessed me. The whiskey seared my throat raw, and my heart went wild in my chest.
The rest of that night blurred into a drunken stupor.
What I never forgot was waking the next morning in Tristan's strong embrace, a ring shining on my finger. Tears of joy spilled down my face as I thought myself the happiest woman alive.
It wasn't until much later that I learned of Tristan's greatest regret‚Äîthat he'd never handed that glass of whiskey to Winnie.
A bitter smile crossed my lips. Now, at last, maybe he could.
Memories surged up in relentless waves, and a bone-deep weariness dragged me under. I sank into a troubled, uneasy sleep.
When I opened my eyes again, the car was already sitting in the villa's garage. Winnie was gone. She must've slipped out without me noticing.
Tristan was turned toward me, his brow furrowed deep. His voice was low as he said, ""Anna, did you really have to pull a stunt like that just to catch my attention? If you wanted a ride back, all you had to do was say so.
""Why put on that fainting act at the clubhouse entrance?""
His tone was sharp and laced with impatience. I couldn't quite tell what had him so wound up. Perhaps he was just angry that I'd cut into his stolen moments with Winnie.
""Tristan, you've got it all wrong. I never wanted you to bring me back.""
He snorted, as though my denial was nothing but stubborn pride. ""Oh, really? And were you planning to crawl home in that state?""
I met his gaze without flinching. ""I can take a cab. Tristan, I'm not useless without you. I went along with everything before because I loved you, but that doesn't mean I can't survive if I leave you.""
He stared at me like I'd just told the funniest joke he'd ever heard, the derision in his eyes only sharpening. ""Leave me? Anna, by all means, try. Then we'll see who ends up regretting it‚Äîyou or me.""
I didn't bother to argue further. Once he saw the divorce agreement, he'd realize I was serious this time.


Chapter 3

My knees gave out as I stepped out of the car. I could barely stay on my feet, let alone walk.
Only then did Tristan seem to grasp that I wasn't faking anything. Wordlessly, he scooped me up, carried me into the bedroom, and laid me down with care.
The dizziness and weakness I felt clung to me stubbornly. Eyes shut, I didn't even have the strength to lift a finger.
Tristan pressed a glass of glucose water to my lips, and in that imperious tone I'd long since grown used to, commanded, ""Drink.""
I drained the glass of glucose water without a word.
That was Tristan's modus operandi. He'd let me down, then throw me a scrap of affection as if it made up for everything. The endless whiplash between cold and warmth had left me lost in doubt for five long years.
Did he ever truly care about me? Chasing the answer to that question was pathetic, and I'd wasted five years doing it. It was time to wake up.
I couldn't be bothered to figure out what was going through his mind. I murmured, ""Thanks.""
Tristan stayed put at the foot of the bed, staring down at me. ""Aren't you going to ask me anything?""
I shook my head calmly.
He seemed a little put out by my reaction, and, unusually for him, actually started to explain himself. ""It's not what you think. Winnie's just here because our family business is in trouble, and we need her‚Äî""
I cut him short. ""As she should.""
Tristan's eyes searched my face, as if he might catch the smallest crack in my composure, but there was nothing for him to find.
""Anna, it's just work between us now.""
I nodded. ""I know.""
He went quiet, leaned down, and wrapped me in his arms. He then tried to kiss me.
He thought a kiss would smooth everything over like it always had. But this time, I turned my face away.
Blindsided by my refusal, Tristan stopped short, his face hardening in an instant. ""Anna, I'm running out of patience. Don't push me.""
I refused to meet his eyes.
That night, we slept in separate rooms. He let me have the master bedroom and took the guest room instead.
‚Ä¶
By the time I woke the next morning, Tristan was already gone.
I'd already made up my mind to leave, and I wanted to make a clean break. Thus, I went straight to the administration office and handed in my resignation.
Ben Fulton, the man in charge, gaped at the letter. ""Madre Anna, what are you doing? Don Spallone only reassigned you. He never told you to quit.""
I froze. ""Reassigned?""
Ben stumbled over his words. ""A few days ago, you touched something in the family vault without his permission. He was furious and fired the old vault keeper.
""But with the family short on people and no one else to fill the spot, he temporarily made you the one guarding the vault.""
A chill cut straight through me. Again, it was because of that damn roll of film.
Because of Winnie's film, I was being shoved off to guard the vault‚Äîthe most thankless post in the entire organization.
I forced down the storm tearing through me and asked, ""So who's taking my place as head of intelligence?""
Ben's voice dropped to a whisper. ""Winnie.""
My legs almost gave out, and I caught myself with a palm to the wall. Even if I was already set on leaving, hearing that still struck me like a blade to the gut.
Tristan had never once given me any special treatment in the Spallone family. I had clawed my way up to head of intelligence on my own. And yet, with one word, he handed the position over to Winnie.


Chapter 4

One day, Tristan threw a lavish dinner to celebrate Winnie's official appointment.
Standing in the banquet hall, he introduced the radiant, trusted aide at his side, his praise and high hopes for her plain in every word. He told everyone to look after her from now on.
A murmur rippled through the room.
Was this truly the same Tristan who had always been so cold and uncompromising?
Meanwhile, I, his wife in name, sat forgotten in a corner, no more than a guest who didn't matter.
Tristan's gaze swept the crowd and brushed past me, light as a shadow.
Just then, Winnie's heel wobbled beneath her, and she lurched forward.
Tristan, who had been calm a moment ago, shifted in an instant. He hurried forward and caught her, his grip firm yet taut with tension.
My hand tightened around the stem of my glass. I couldn't stand to watch their closeness for another second. Turning away, I slipped out onto the terrace for air.
The cool night breeze made me feel a little better, but it also carried Tristan's conversation with his friend to my ears.
""So, another cold war with Anna?""
Tristan offered a distracted grunt.
His friend sighed. ""You're so damn stubborn. When are you going to swallow your pride and actually try to make peace with Anna? Women like her don't come around every day.""
""I know.""
""Then, why keep hyping up Winnie right in front of her? All that's going to do is make things worse between you two. What if Anna finally gets fed up and leaves?""
""She won't."" Tristan paused, then said with complete confidence, ""I'll just soothe her if she gets jealous. She'd never walk away from me.""
Tristan was still brimming with that same old confidence. He honestly believed I'd cave first and come crawling back like I always used to.
I shook my head.
Just then, Winnie's voice drifted up behind me. She'd slipped over at some point without me noticing, a triumphant smile playing on her lips.
""Fancy seeing you here, Anna. Out for some fresh air on your own? I feel bad. The moment I showed up, I ended up taking your place in the Spallone family.""
I caught the challenge in her voice and replied coolly, ""Winnie, are we even that close?""
Her smile only widened. ""I barely know you, but you should know me, right? There's no way Tristan hasn't mentioned me.""
I wasn't about to argue, so I turned to go.
When I didn't give her the flustered blow-up she wanted, she decided to put on a little act. She purposefully lurched forward and slammed into the balcony balustrade with a shriek.
""Anna! Why did you push me?""
Of course, Tristan came running at the sound.
The moment he saw Winnie's glistening eyes, he turned on me like a whip. ""Anna! What the hell is wrong with you? You dared to lay a hand on her with everyone watching?""
I met his gaze without offering a word of defense, my voice cracking as I forced out, ""Tristan, I'm asking you one last time. Do you believe her, or me?""
He didn't answer. He only looked at me with eyes cold and heavy with disappointment, then turned and gently helped Winnie up.
That was all I needed to hear.
I bit down on my lower lip until the sharp taste of blood spread across my tongue, and still I felt nothing.
A complicated look flickered in Tristan's eyes. He started to speak.
But Winnie, sagging against him, cut in, her voice small. ""Tristan, my back really hurts. We should go to the hospital.""
Tristan quickly picked her up. As he moved past me, he didn't spare me so much as a glance.
That was when the Spallone family soldati came over, courteous but firm. ""Apologies, Ms. Jovine. This is Ms. Leigh's celebration. Anyone who isn't friendly toward her isn't welcome.""
I drew a deep breath and blinked the tears back.
""I get it. Don't bother throwing me out. I'll leave on my own,"" I said, eyes red-rimmed.
When I went back to the villa for my suitcase, I spotted an elegant card on the table in the living room. It was an appointment card from a premier wedding studio, with Tristan's and my name printed on it.
I had no idea when he'd left it.
He'd finally remembered the wedding shoot he'd promised me, the one I'd pleaded for for five years. But it was too little, too late.
I tore the card to shreds, dropped it in the trash, and went straight to the airport.
On the plane, I took out my phone and sent Tristan one last text.
""The divorce agreement and my resignation letter are on your desk. Don't forget to look at them when you get back.""
After that, I popped out my SIM card and snapped it in two.
Tristan and I would never see each other again

As someone who obsessively researched others‚Äô experiences with misoprostol, I figured I‚Äôd add my two cents now that I feel I‚Äôm on the tail end of things. Pregnancy stopped developing at 6 weeks and I opted for medication over D&C because my insurance is not great and I live in the US. My work was also kind enough to give me paid bereavement leave today. 

The day before, I picked up the drug from my local pharmacy. The tech asked me ‚Äúis there any chance you could be pregnant?‚Äù And I was a bit.. taken aback. I said ‚Äúwell.. I mean I‚Äôm taking it for that‚Äù not really knowing what to say. He then grabbed the pharmacist, who was confused at first and I point blank told him ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having a miscarriage. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm taking it.‚Äù And the tech said ‚Äúso can I sell it to her then?‚Äù So that was severely uncomfortable. The pharmacist apologized but I literally had no idea what to say. 

Today I took a hot shower, got some to-go breakfast and coffee, then inserted the pills vaginally (four 200mg) and rested on the couch for awhile. I also took 800mg ibuprofen prophylactically. This was around 9am. 

After 1 hour I got the craziest chills and my teeth were chattering. I also had mild cramping but no bleeding. I got pretty nauseous so I took some ondansetron and felt significantly better afterwards. 

After four hours I felt a gush, but it was clear liquid, which I did not expect. I went to the bathroom and finally started bleeding. I took 1000mg acetaminophen to stay ahead of things and cramping slowly got more intense but still manageable. I started using my heating pad. 

From around 2pm-6pm I got waves of intense cramping and would go to the bathroom and pass lots of clots. Honestly that was the worst part for me - it wasn‚Äôt the pain, just an overall unpleasant feeling. I told my sister in law it felt like I was giving birth to a bunch of grapes. 

At 6pm I took some more ibuprofen to make sure the pain was still manageable. It‚Äôs now 8pm and I‚Äôm still bleeding in waves but with far fewer clots and more watery blood. 

I am absolutely wiped out but it hasn‚Äôt been as scary as I thought. I was grateful I‚Äôd done research and had meds on hand. The one thing I wish I‚Äôd bought is baby wipes. Blood kinda goes everywhere when you‚Äôre lying down and not expecting it. 

I find out if this was successful on Tuesday. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to ask me any questions!",1,1758939019.0,Miscarriage,0,1.0,False

Dee's eyes were cold and unreadable as she watched Marco/Pete/Doctor Igwe pull on his heavy boots. Next to Pete was Harry, putting on his coat and checking his gloves.

""Whatever is attacking Atlantis is putting fifty thousands years of soul collection at risk. The exact thing the Onion was built to avoid,"" Pete was saying.

""I know that,"" Dee snapped. ""I'm just not sure either one of you are up to what's going to happen.""

Pete looked up at her, frowning. ""Like what?""

""There. That right there is what I keep talking about. What that big thug Daxin was always talking about,"" Dee snapped, crushing out her cigarette and standing up. ""You don't actually make plans, Pete. You just waltz in, trusting in your 'superior intellect' to allow you to figure out ways out of the perfectly predictable predicament you've found yourself hip deep in.""

""It's the Onion, the most secure thing of all secure things,"" Pete scoffed.

""That has multiple ways into it you never foresaw,"" Harry added, adjusting his gunbelt. He reached out and touched the table, fatigue passing through his eyes.

""And Harry isn't even close to being ready for walking across the room without stumbling, much less whatever dumb shit you two have thought up,"" Dee said. She stomped into the hallway. ""Don't leave without me, numb nuts,"" she snapped.

Harry noticed, but didn't point out, that in her anger she hadn't completely put out the cigarette and it was now eeking out a thin trail of smoke.

He reached over, picked up the crushed cigarette butt, and put it out properly.

""How bad do you think it is?"" Pete asked.

Harry glanced at him. ""In the middle of the Gestalts trying to update with TerraSol the whole system crashes and we have reports of sections of the Onion and Atlantis going down?"" he asked. ""I'd say it's bad.""

""How the hell did they beat the architecture? It's the first line of defense, even before the cross checkers,"" Pete mused. ""You'd have to know the architecture, you'd have to be able to attack the software, the firmware, *and* the hardware. Then you'd have to be able to lift your attack into a viable entry port.""

Dee chose that moment to stomp out. She was wearing an old Prairie Dress with a gunbelt buckled on it, holding a breech action shotgun with a floppy hat on top and heavy boots.

Harry knew better than to snicker. Plus, he wasn't going to be a hipocrite.

""Let's go,"" Dee snapped.

""How are we getting to the Onion, much less Atlantis?"" Pete asked.

""I know someone,"" Dee said. She lifted her free hand and snapped her fingers.

The kitchen was suddenly empty with the *fzzt* on the back of the molars.

Nakteti couldn't stop hugging her mother. Since arriving at the expensive hotel in Chromium Saint Peter's City, she spent as much time as she could with her mother.

And couldn't seem to stop hugging her.

Passing by her. Being near her. Just seeing her in the morning or after a short separation.

She just kept going up and hugging the elderly matron.

The first week she had cried at the sight of her mother. Like a lost child suddenly found when they had felt all was lost. Then she got down to sobbing.

Now she just hugged and breathed deep.

Nakteti broke the embrace and stared at her mother, who stared back with black warsteel eyes surrounded by white fur. The red stripe, like bloodied fur, started at the tip of Sangbre's nose and went up over the top of her head.

Despite Sangbre's age, the matron stood firm and tall, her back unbowed and her gripping hands still strong.

""My daughter, it is good to see you. I am gratified that you had time to speak with me at my request,"" Sangbre said, her voice soft and almost choral sounding.

Nakteti blinked, realizing this wasn't just her mother teasing her by making an 'appointment' to see her daughter.

Since returning to Sol she had found the ship-mates she had thought were lost forever, as well as tens of thousands of Tnvaru who had been present when The Bag had been activated and had turned into tens of millions of the last fifty years.

She had gone to see her own movie twice.

She shook herself slightly to refocus her mind.

""It is good to see you, mother,"" she said softly.

Her mother let go of Nakteti's catching hands with her own, turning and tapping her way over to the chair to sit down.

One of the Pukan maids in a little black and white maid outfit moved over to set down a teacup and pour tea and milk before mixing in honey and withdrawing.

Nakteti sat down, staring at her mother. She looked down and saw her mother still had salt crystals in the tread of her shoes.

Her mother finished the second sip and leaned back, folding her gripping hands over the top of her cane.

""I have come to warn you, daughter mine,"" Sangbre said, her voice distant and soft.

And spoken entirely in High Trog. ""Things are in motion again. The Titans of Eld have begun to waken and with them their terrible tasks will be laid upon the shoulders of mortals like a yoke upon an oxen, with all the understanding of the beast of burden.""

Nakteti took a deep breath and exhaled it slowly.

*Not good*, she thought.

""What threats have your warsteel eyes foreseen, mother?"" she asked.

Sangbre lifted her cane and tapped it on the floor.

Once.

She stood up.

Twice.

She spread out her catching hands.

Thrice.

""BEHOLD!"" Sangbre called out. ""BELONNA!""

Purple smoke erupted from the floor, lifting up in a tight spiral. The smoke seemed to tighten and then wisped away.

A Terran girl stood there, dressed in diaphanous white silk that was sheer enough that Nakteti could see the purple scars graven into gray pallid skin. The figure's throat was cut, with black blood having run out of it to stain the girl's breasts.

Her eyes were purple fire.

She closed her eyes, threw her head back, and spread out her arms as if to embrace the world.

""WARE! WARE AND WOE!"" the girl screamed out. Her voice shattered glass and crystal alike. ""THE DETAINEE SHALL BE REVEALED! THE AFTERLIFE IN DANGER! THE MATRON OF HELL WILL STRIDE THE LAND OF THE LIVING IN HER TERRIBLE FORM ONCE AGAIN!""

Nakteti could feel the force of the scream push her back into her chair, feel it deform her flesh like standing in a wind tunnel.

""SHE COMES IN SLOW FOOTSTEPS, FIRE AND SMOKE HELD IN HER HAND! WARE! WARE AND WOE!""

The girl suddenly vanished, leaving behind a puff of purple smoke that began to tatter away.

Nakteti blinked a few times to get her blurred vision set right.

""That's... ominous,"" Nakteti said.

Sangbre nodded. ""I had the vision of Bellona appearing and hurried to warn you. I did not know her message.""

""Had you asked me, as a young Tnvaru girl, if magic was real, I would have scoffed at your words and mocked your lineage,"" Nakteti said.

""It is technology so far advanced and used in such a way as to appear magic,"" Sangbre agreed, sitting down. She shook her head. ""I see the souls leaving the bodies of the dying, being lifted up to a white light, and being greeted by those who have gone before,"" she shook her head. ""The Terrans has made the argument of whether or not the soul exists by creating it or being able to scientifically prove and call upon one.""

""Technological necromancy,"" Nakteti agreed. She shivered. ""The things I saw in Atlantis.""

She took a sip of tea to settle herself. ""Children, enraged infants, possibly even ones that had never been truly born, impressed with the personality and memories of experienced soldiers,"" she shuddered again. ""Horrors and miracles in equal measure,"" she said softly.

""Deep within the salt caves of the Vodka Trog Cradle, I saw technology made into both horror and the miraculous,"" Sangbre said. She gave a deep heaving sigh. ""I guided all of the refugees, those pinned within the claimed lands of Tuvan Warsteel Horde, Cossacks of VodkaTrog Siberia, succored those set adrift by the war and the Council's invasion of Fortress Sol.""

""And now more is coming,"" Nakteti sighed. She set the tea cup down and opened her mouth.

There were three sharp raps on the door of the hotel room.

The two cyborgs, nearly inhuman in appearance, both went to high alert. Tentacles snaked out from behind their backs, out from under the rude canvas cloths that were decorated with paint. Weapons clacked and capacitors whined. Two extra arms unfolded and the previously visible arms split into two arms each. The lack of eyes or part of the forehead made them look incomplete, alien, as they turned and faced the door.

Nakteti checked her eye implant.

Nothing, nobody was there.

The three raps happened again.

Nakteti looked over at Captain Manners, who was sitting in one of the chairs. The recently returned to the land of the living human soldier nodded, adjusting his arm so that Nakteti could see he was holding a heavy magac pistol hidden in his arms.

One of the cyborgs moved forward, opening the door, firmly ready to start firing or just delivering a sharp verbal rebuke.

Instead, Nakteti saw the cyborg reel back, stumbling back into the room before going down on one knee, on hand making the sideways figure eight while the others pressed to the floor. The other cyborg copied the action.

""It's nice to get some respect,"" the woman's voice was smokey, rich.

High heeled boots clacked as the wearer walked into the room, followed by two men.

Nakteti recognized the woman immediately.

She too went down on one knee, three of her hands pressed against the floor and her left gripping hand making the sign of the Digital Omnimessiah in front of her.

Nakteti realized she was praying under her breath.

""She's praying to be delivered from evil,"" one male voice said.

""See, this is why I can't take you places, Pete, you have this reaction on people,"" the woman's voice said.

""It means you,"" a tired sounding voice said.

There was a forced exhale of breath. ""I know that, you killjoy,"" the woman's voice was harder, edged in brimstone.

""Get up, all of you. You look stupid,"" the woman said.

Nakteti looked up, half expecting it to be some kind of trick.

The woman that stared down at her had cold gun-metal gray eyes.

Familiar gray eyes.

""We need a ride to somewhere you've been once,"" the Matron of Hell said. ""Pete will explain.""

0-0-0-0-0

The teacup chattered as Nakteti set it on the coffee table with one shaking hand.

""Steady, my daughter. Deep breaths from the stomach, from the deep center of your spirit,"" Sangbre said. She puffed on her pipe, then blew smoke rings at the ceiling. ""The Matron of Hell, the Detainee, in the flesh, was not something my sight had prepared me for.""

""I don't think you can be prepared for it,"" Nakteti admitted. She shuddered. ""It's not the first time I've met her. She tempted me and the others in Atlantis when we were there. She was there when we discovered the horrible truth behind the ChronoKnights.""

Sangbre just nodded.

""But this one feels different,"" Nakteti admitted. ""There's something different about her this time.""

Sangbre touched the tip of her nose with one claw. ""My eyes see much and I can tell you, this was no hologram, no nanite creation. She was real. I could see the pulse in her veins, smell the pheromone laden sweat even she was unaware of.""

Nakteti frowned. ""My first encounter could have been generated by the SUDS system itself. The digital mistress of Hell made flesh by esoteric means.""

""Which means this one was real,"" Sangbre said. She sipped at her own coffee and waiting for her daughter to finish sipping at her own.

She smiled at Nakteti when her daughter looked at her.

""Tell me, daughter mine,"" she paused for effect. ""Can you feel the yoke laid upon your shoulders?""

Nakteti stared her mother in the eyes for a long moment before breaking the silence.

""Moo.""

Our coffee table is also solid wood (and we bought it for only $5 at a thrift store!), so I'm wanting to start with refinishing it to help it match and look more cohesive. But clearly, I have no sense of style and limited budget.

What color should I stain or paint the coffee table? Is it possible to make the cherry end tables match without doing a disservice to the cherry? Does cherry even go with the floors?

That‚Äôs how we met each other, (we‚Äôre not related don‚Äôt worry lol).

Long story short we ended up talking for over two hours. Now that I look back she was definitely flirting with me from the moment she found out I was an adult, single and gay. She invited me over to her place for drinks. One I don‚Äôt drink, and two I have OCD which basically makes me think everyone is trying to kill me. So obviously I was hesitant but, my therapist has been saying to try new things. I don‚Äôt think she meant this, though I went along with it anyway.

So, I ended up having my first one night stand or hookup or whatever. I honestly have no idea what to call it. When I woke up in the morning she was already awake and just sitting there, she said a few minutes later that she was surprised I hadn‚Äôt already left.

I thought I would never see this woman again until I ran into her at my local coffee shop. I was having a super bad day with OCD and basically a public mental breakdown in the corner and she helped me out a lot that night.

Now to the part I need advice about, she‚Äôs still sleeping with other people apparently. My roommate ran into her at a gay bar and ended up sending me a picture of her making out with someone.

I have a friend I hang out with regularly ‚Äî we usually grab coffee or food together, usually at the kind of places where you order at a counter. With most friends, we have a sort of unspoken agreement: if I‚Äôm first in line, I‚Äôll usually offer to cover them, and then next time they‚Äôll do the same if they‚Äôre ahead. It‚Äôs not so much keeping score as much as it is basic manners.
But with this particular friend, I realized that I‚Äôm almost always the one ahead in line, and always the one paying. For the first 6 months of our friendship, I didn‚Äôt even notice. Eventually, I did however and since I‚Äôm not made of money I decided to be more mindful of it. 
Since I avoid confrontation like the plague, my plan was to let her go ahead in like so she can pay for her own stuff. If she did offer to pay for me, I would decline. I just don‚Äôt want to pay for someone who doesn‚Äôt seem like the value me in return without creating awkwardness. 

Unfortunately that‚Äôs when I started noticing something strange. Whenever we get close to the counter, she actively avoids going first. She‚Äôll slow her steps, or do this awkward shifting so I end up ahead. It's subtle, but in the 5 or so times that we‚Äôve gone out since I‚Äôve decided to stop paying, she‚Äôs done it every time. It‚Äôs to the point where it‚Äôs actually comical how hard she‚Äôs trying to not be first.
It‚Äôs also unfortunately confusing. She knows that I don‚Äôt like people paying for me. When people offer, I always say no. In the few times she‚Äôs been ahead of me, I‚Äôve also said No. I‚Äôm starting to wonder is she afraid she‚Äôll have to pay for me‚Äîwhich I can honestly understand since no one likes to foot a big bill‚Äîor is she trying to avoid paying for herself.

For context: we‚Äôre both from the cultures where it‚Äôs pretty shameful to at least not offer to pay for a friend. Additionally I believe we are the same socioeconomic status, though her family is likely be better off than mine",1,1758938296.0,socialskills,3,0.67,False

There are plenty of [spy tools](https://honeysyed.com/tyver) out there that will show you who's advertising in what niche, but a lot of the time, it‚Äôs way simpler than that.

Start searching for a ‚Äòtarget‚Äô niche on FB, e.g. solar UK, solar info, solar panels, solar grants, anything you can think of. The algorithm will kick in and start serving you ads from what could be your ideal AI partners.

Also, do a Google search. See who‚Äôs spending top dollar to be on the first few pages. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs an ‚Äòorganic‚Äô hit or an ad, they‚Äôll have had to invest one way or another to be so high up the rankings.

Rinse and repeat for each niche you like the look of.

If you've already got an idea of the businesses you wanna reach out to, you can skip the above, but still remember to do a quick search on FB ad library or Google Ads Centre to check if they‚Äôre spending on ads.

Some basic recon on a business‚Äôs ads will help you see what‚Äôs important to them (and their customers) right now, because they‚Äôll be leading with their best hooks and angles.

After snooping around on FB ad library or Google Ads Centre, start jotting down what you see and what is good/bad/interesting.

Maybe you‚Äôve noticed some interesting talking points in the comment section of their ads?

Then go to their website to see if there‚Äôs anything cool/unique on there that you can reference when you reach out to them.

We should not try to sell.

We should not talk about commercials.

As we arrive at the airport it‚Äôs been nothing but constant complaining from my sister, she‚Äôs an adult yet acts so immature. ‚Äúi‚Äôm gonna go home i stg, gimme my bag‚Äù just unnecessary remarks and it‚Äôs dampening my mothers mood. My sister gets frustrated and calls me annoying for literally smiling at her lmao like what? We haven‚Äôt even checked officially yet as they haven‚Äôt opened the airline we check in with yet until another 30mins to an hour. 

Going through security is gonna be hell as since i‚Äôve been a child i‚Äôve always been pulled aside for ‚Äúrandom security checks‚Äù and it‚Äôs made me anxious/paranoid since. Right now i‚Äôm not really bothered as i‚Äôve enjoyed my time roaming London. We had 1 hour 30 mins till our second coach arrived so i walked to Buckingham Palace, going through the streets was nice, seeing all kinds of restaurants and establishments and cool architecture and the sorts. I‚Äôve tried taking some photos as i wanna revisit london seeing how pretty it is, this is the first time i‚Äôve been since i was around 12 id assume so i have no idea what stuff there is to do or where to go so id love to book a week up here or smth like that someday. 

Anyway i‚Äôm sat in a Cafe rn as i wait for the time to pass, My family have stepped outside for ‚Äúfresh air‚Äù while i‚Äôm here sitting with all the luggage. I‚Äôm not particularly thrilled about traveling as i wanted to share the details of this trip with somebody but can‚Äôt, so i feel as though there isn‚Äôt as much joy in it. When i get to Italy i intend on being alone for the most part, i wanna experience it myself not with my family, we‚Äôre going to Sicily so i‚Äôm gna look at trains and stuff and depending on how long they take and such i may go to Rome, Milan or somewhere else on a day trip. Other than that i may just stay around the beach or the strip where most of the activities would be going on i‚Äôd assume. 

I also had this random guy come up to me saying he was homeless and asking for money in the airport? I gave him ¬£10 and my mum said it‚Äôs probably a scam or smth but i just wanted him to leave so i‚Äôm not too fussed on giving that away.

1nrj41d,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1nrj41d/coffee_and_her/,Coffee and her.,"I watched the dew trace delicate lines along the window, yet the glass remained clear. Her voice lingered in the bitterness of the coffee - not the harsh, unpleasant kind, but the kind of bitterness that draws you in, makes you crave it. She was a coffee person; I was not. Chai was my comfort, my ritual, my cup of tea. 
My room has two chairs, I only use one.
The other stays in the corner, collecting dust, as if waiting for her to return. I never touched it. Some absences must remain untouched, like wounds that refuse bandages.
Love, I have decided, is not a flame as poets say. It's not fire or light. It's a parasite. It enters quickly, feeds endlessly and when it leaves, it leaves scars in the name of absence. To love is to volunteer for ruin, yet I would volunteer again if she asked. That is the sickness. That is the truth.
 On our first date, we went to a caf√© after I had the numbers 11:11 inked on my right wrist. I don‚Äôt know if it was impulse or destiny, but something about those digits felt like a wish pressed into skin, a reminder that even time has moments meant only for us. She looked at it and smiled, tracing the fresh ink with her eyes, not her fingers. It stung, the tattoo, but her gaze numbed it. Pain felt holy when she noticed.
 She ordered cold coffee, the kind that clinks with ice and laughs in the glass. I ordered South Indian filter coffee, hot and steady, bitter and grounding. Even then, we were opposites. She carried the chill of mischief, I carried the warmth of ritual. Between us sat two cups, two worlds, yet one table. One silence, heavy and new, but alive. 
I didn‚Äôt know then that the tattoo would scar into more than skin. That 11:11 would stop being a number and start being her, the wish I made, the wish I lost, the wish I keep drinking to every morning.
That day, I realized something simple. Love doesn‚Äôt announce itself with thunder, it hides in small details. In the way she tilted her head when she listened, in the way her eyes lingered just long enough to make me nervous.
I sip, but it doesn‚Äôt taste the same. Coffee was never really about the drink, it was about her across the table, about the way her presence sweetened even the bitterest brew. Without her, it‚Äôs just liquid, just time passing through my hands.
Around me, strangers laugh, spoons clink, life goes on. But at my table there is only silence. My cup is full, but I am empty. Every sip is a reminder that I‚Äôm not sharing it with her, that I‚Äôm sipping memories, not coffee.
So I sit here, nursing what‚Äôs left in the glass, staring at the empty chair across from me. The world sees a man drinking his morning coffee. I know better. I‚Äôm just drinking to her.

1nrj03a,https://www.reddit.com/r/prozac/comments/1nrj03a/i_almost_chose_not_to_start/,I almost chose not to start.,"*I am writing this post so that hopefully I can help out someone who, like me a few months ago, is desperately searching the internet for reassurance. If you're considering an SSRI like Prozac, it's best to chat with your specific healthcare professional. My anecdote counts as one experience, so I only aim to let you know that it works for me.* 

This has been an incredibly difficult year for me, and I have always had a sort of dysthymia/anxiety since being a teenager (I'm in my 30's). At best, I was managing day to day, and at worst, I was blowing off work or nearly flunking classes. I'd been able to hide my issues for years, but with recent events, I truly reached a breaking point. 

When my therapist first suggested SSRIs, I was terrified. I likened it to ""giving in"". I was grossed out by the biological aspect of it. I read through the list of potential side effects and didn't like what I saw. The weight gain possibility was scary for me.

But, at a certain point, I couldn't bear what I was going through anymore. I needed the suffering to lessen. So, I contacted the psychiatrist I'd been referred to, and set up an appointment. Within a couple of weeks, I took my first dose of Prozac. I started on 10 mg for two weeks. 

I did not feel any improvement in my mood, at least not from the Prozac. But the affirmation that I had invested in myself to change things through medication and therapy felt like **hope**. I had not felt hope in a few months, and the realization that there was any hope at all was enough to make me cry with gratitude. 

My first couple of weeks on Prozac were hard to get through. Over the first few days, I was jittery as heck. Drinking my coffee those first few days (do not recommend) gave me heart palpitations and hand tremors. I was exhausted, probably from jolting awake at night. My dreams were like fever dreams, random and electric. After about ten days, those side effects mostly went away. Then, I began on 20 mg. 

On 20 mg, I experienced a resurgence of those side effects. But again, after about ten more days, I settled back into a good routine of sleeping, I have good energy, and my coffee doesn't affect me. I have not had any alcohol since beginning Prozac three months ago, so I can't attest to that experience. My psych told me that alcohol is not recommended on the medication, so I committed to not imbibing at all.

There was no single point when I felt like I was suddenly happy. No moment where I could feel it ""kick in"". But I will tell you that I have control of my nights for the first time in my life--no more fetal position from 7 pm until sleep. I no longer clean obsessively as if my survival depends on it (I am figuring out how to retrain myself to keep the house tidy now that anxiety doesn't fuel me). I am able to let things be, not dwell on who might hate me. I forgive myself for small mistakes. I don't count calories. I feel brave to speak up in a room. I don't need alcohol to feel confident socially. And my fitness is even better than before. 

The most amazing part of this journey has been the sense of **narrative** that has come back to me. Before Prozac, I was numbly surviving each day, with no meaning or story attached to experiences. No sense of continuity. That's what I was mourning through depression the most. But now I have the narrative of life back. I take meaning from my days and my experiences. I can connect with my surroundings spiritually again. 

I almost chose not to start Prozac because of fear. If you are in a position to take this medication, and you may really need it, please consider it with your doc. For the first time in a long time, I feel like I can help other people, and I'd love to help anyone that needs it. Feel free to DM!",3,1758937505.0,prozac,2,1.0,False

Umineko‚Äôs plot was based around proving the events on Rokkenjima were magical or not, and I feel like you could do the same thing with SHf (even in the true ending, which I was viewing as entirely supernatural until the comment about his dad getting upset when he drinks was mentioned.)

Just an interesting and random thought I had, and honestly I could imagine SHF to an extent being a game between Witches‚Ä¶(not saying is but it‚Äôs fun to think about).

Also after having a cup of coffee and thinking about other similarities, Junko‚Äôs character totally strikes me as a possible witch‚Äôs piece character (similar to how Takano was Lambda Delta‚Äôs piece in Higurashi and Erika was Bernkastel‚Äôs piece in Umineko).

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

Boredom used to lead somewhere. Daydreaming , people watching, random thoughts that sometimes turned into actual ideas or plans. Now that mental space gets occupied by whatever algorithm thinks i want to see.

Forced myself to wait 20 minutes at a coffee shop yesterday without touching my phone. Felt genuinely uncomfortable at first but then started noticing conversations around me, thinking about weekend plans, just existing without input for once.

Went to some community event through 222 app this week specifically because phones weren't allowed. forgot how nice it is when your brain can just wander instead of being constantly directed toward the next piece of content.

So I finally decided to join in on the Me vs. My F/O and did two separate versions of the finished template, one for me and one for Snooper. Here's an explanation for a few of the pic choices:

* For hobbies, I chose art supplies to represent art, my S/I's favorite thing to do. The one for Snooper was oddly fitting because, in one *Snooper & Blabber* episode, he could be seen admiring his mustache disguise collection. And there was a stock image of a coin collection with a ***magnifying glass*** of all things! It had me wondering if it could be a sign, but went with it anyway.
* For drinks, A&W Root Beer (or basically any kind of brand with root beer) was my pick for my S/I. Snooper's is dark coffee--freshly ground, no sugar or cream, just the way he likes it.
* As for food, chicken alfredo for my S/I and grilled fish for Snooper (I couldn't decide between that and a plate of sandwiches).
* Being a fun-loving person myself the choice for a place category was so easy and I picked a carnival at nighttime. And you can probably guess why I chose the New York City skyline for Snooper in contrast.
* I chose our respective birth flowers for the flower section (water lily in mine \[July\] and aster for his \[September\]).
* The choice of pics for the outfits, colors, and nails for both were purely based on vibes alone.

In the LC Luther says that the Seventh Commandment isn‚Äôt just about stealing outright, it‚Äôs also about getting cheap stuff by cheating or harming your neighbor. And if I‚Äôm honest, a lot of the things I own fall into that category. I look around at all the items around me from the screen I write this from to the candy I eat, and if I really think about how they got here I have to face the lives of people who have been cheated. The reason my clothes or phone or food are ‚Äúcheap‚Äù is usually because someone else, somewhere down the line, got exploited.

But here‚Äôs the thing that really stings, or maybe gives me hope, if the Church catholic actually moved as one, these systems could not last a week. Two billion Christians refusing to profit off slavery and exploitation? That would be the end of it. But instead, I just kind of go along, fractured and distracted. I do not believe Isaiah was kidding when he said God hates fasting and pious words if we ignore the oppressed (Isaiah 58). 

I don‚Äôt bring this up to make it sound like we can all just drop out of the system tomorrow, Luther‚Äôs doctrine of vocation reminds us that we live in the world, and we‚Äôll never escape every entanglement with sin. But just pretending like we‚Äôre powerless is not the correct response. We‚Äôre not just individuals, we‚Äôre a part of the Body of Christ. 

But maybe the starting point is just admitting out loud ""Yes, we are complicit."" Then asking together, as congregations ‚Äúwhat can we change?‚Äù It can be, and must be, the small stuff, where we get our coffee, how we think about clothes, even how and where we teach our kids about stewardship. But the point is, we must stop shrugging. Because if Christ‚Äôs Church really is who She says She is, we‚Äôve got no excuse to keep acting like we‚Äôre powerless.",8,1758936403.0,LCMS,1,1.0,False

I can't believe this moment is finally here ‚Äì my SaaS product is generating revenue, and I‚Äôm over the moon! üåï

A Little Backstory

I started this journey with just an idea. A small, scrappy prototype built during late nights, fueled by endless cups of coffee (and a few mental breakdowns üòÖ). Honestly, I doubted myself a million times. Who would care about my product? Who would even pay for it?

You know the one ‚Äì ""You've received a payment of $19."" It took me a second to process, and then it hit me like a freight train.

What My Product Does

The product is Its a software solution that is useful for at least a few reasons I can think of:‚Å†

1. Its a reddit tool that helps you find the best unmoderated subreddits for you to promote yourself or to claim these subreddits. The database containing the subreddits is constantly updated. Another feature is allowing you to see the best time to post in any sub.
2. Can be used to find abandoned subreddits with active, engaged members but no moderation team. By claiming these subreddits, you take control of a ready-made community in your niche‚Äîperfect for building authority, driving traffic, or even monetizing through ads, affiliate links, or memberships. Or if you're just passionate about the topic and want to run it yourself :)
3. ‚Å†Don‚Äôt want to take ownership, you can still use the database to identify subreddits relevant to your niche and post your content, products, or services here.
4. You get the best time to post in a subreddit, this ensuring the best visibility of the post.


Why This Means So Much to Me

I‚Äôm not some big startup founder with investors throwing money at me. I don‚Äôt have a fancy office or a huge team. It‚Äôs just me, grinding every day, figuring things out as I go. This $19 is so much more than just money ‚Äì it‚Äôs validation. It‚Äôs proof that someone, somewhere, found enough value in what I‚Äôve built to actually pay for it.

What‚Äôs Next?

For me, this is just the beginning. Now that I know people are willing to pay, it‚Äôs time to double down. More features, more marketing, and maybe even more subscriptions? Let‚Äôs see how far this can go.

Thanks for reading, and if you‚Äôve been grinding on your own project, let‚Äôs hear about it in the comments. Let‚Äôs inspire each other. üöÄ

1nri51b,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1nri51b/the_great_toilet_paper_crisis_of_2025/,The Great Toilet Paper Crisis of 2025,"I swear, I was ready to declare martial law over a single roll of toilet paper. Or, more accurately, the *lack* thereof. It was 7 AM, and I‚Äôd just woken up to the unsettling reality that not only was the bathroom roll bone-dry, but the entire linen closet was, too. Again. This wasn't the first time, but it felt like the final straw in a long list of minor-but-maddening household issues.

Living in our downtown apartment with Liam, Chloe, and Maya was usually chill, no cap. Liam's super laid-back, almost to a fault. Chloe's the organized one, but sometimes her ""helpful"" notes on the fridge feel a little‚Ä¶ pointed. And Maya, our newest housemate, is still kinda quiet, observing everything. I love them, honestly, but my patience was wearing thin. Like, who keeps using the last of something and just‚Ä¶ *leaves* the empty wrapper? That‚Äôs sending me.

I stormed out of the bathroom, bathrobe flapping, and saw Chloe already in the kitchen, making her green smoothie. ""Chloe,"" I started, trying to keep my voice even, ""do we have any toilet paper? Anywhere?""

She looked up, unfazed. ""Oh, I thought Liam was gonna grab some yesterday. I put it on the shopping list on the fridge, remember?"" She gestured to a pristine, color-coded whiteboard with ""TP"" written in an almost aggressively neat font. I glanced at it. Underneath, in messy scrawl, was Liam's ""Got it!"" from three days ago. Classic.

Later that day, after an emergency corner-store run (my third this month, btw), I decided we needed an intervention. Not, like, a dramatic one, but a serious chat. My internal monologue was basically a spreadsheet of grievances: dirty dishes left by the sink, communal coffee grounds emptied but not replaced, the phantom last slice of pizza. I knew everyone was busy, but come on. This was basic adulting.

That evening, I highkey corralled everyone into the living room. ""Okay, guys, we need to talk,"" I started, feeling a bit like the house mom, which I never wanted to be. ""The toilet paper situation today was‚Ä¶ a moment. But it's not just that. We need a system for shared supplies and chores, for real.""

Liam, ever chill, just shrugged. ""Yeah, I keep forgetting. My bad, truly."" Maya nodded shyly. Chloe, however, had an entire presentation ready. She pulled out her phone, ""I actually found this app that helps with chore rotation and shared expenses. We could try it?""

I was skeptical, but desperate. We spent the next hour hashing it out. We assigned specific chores, set up a shared grocery list on Chloe‚Äôs app, and even agreed to a ""communal dinner"" night once a week to actually connect. It wasn't just about the chores, I realized; it was about acknowledging we're a team.

The next week, things actually shifted. Liam, shockingly, remembered his dish duty. Maya started speaking up more, even suggesting we try a new recipe for our first communal dinner. And me? I found myself laughing when Liam *actually* restocked the toilet paper before it ran out. It was a small win, but honestly, it felt huge. That night, over Maya‚Äôs bomb pasta, we talked, we laughed, and it felt like we weren't just housemates anymore, but a genuine crew.

Living with others honestly hits different when everyone's on the same page. If you're navigating shared living, HomeCo makes it simple to coordinate chores, split bills, and keep the peace. Because the best house stories happen when the logistics just work.

first, stop thinking of content as just a sales pitch. it's a conversation starter. i once struggled with this until i started telling stories about products instead of just listing features, like how a coffee mug's design was inspired by an italian artist or a quirky chef. not only did this boost engagement but it also increased our sales by 20%.

connections. yep, it sounds like one of those networking buzzwords, but it's crucial. i've found that reaching out to influencers even micro ones with a passionate niche following, has done wonders. there's this tool, HypeCaster.ai, that helped me create slick video content for TikTok Shop, and when paired with influencer connections, it can go viral quick.

finally, conversions. pretty obvious, but optimization ain't just about prettier buttons. get deep into analytics and don't be afraid to experimant with a/b testing. i discovered that even changing the color of a 'buy now' button made a difference. oh, and crazy as it sounds, people respond to emojis in call-to-actions. weird, right?

so, what's your secret sauce for boosting those ecommerce numbers? any frameworks, friends?",2,1758934577.0,ecommerce_growth,1,1.0,False

* You can order whatever you want, wherever you want without having to compromise.
* You can order as much or as little food as you want. I feel like people subconsciously order the same amount of food out of courtesy.
* You can read a book, scroll through your phone, or listen to music and not be rude.
* You can eat at your own pace. It's like walking with someone or in a group. You move as slow as the slowest person or as fast as the fastest person. You can pig out without having to look up and keep a conversation flowing.
* No need to entertain other people or feel the pressure of contributing something to a conversation.
   * My unpopular opinion is that eating at restaurants with someone else or other people can get performative. That doesn't mean that I dislike having conversations with people. I actually prefer that in other settings like a cafe because you're just drinking a cup of coffee or tea as opposed to chowing down a plate of spaghetti and meatballs while having to talk.

The older I've gotten, the more I enjoy eating at restaurants alone. It's actually super common to see other people doing the same, even on Friday nights and weekends. For those who find it awkward to eat out alone but want to, start with fast food restaurants or fast casual places where you pay up front and pick your own seat.

1nrhy4u,https://i.redd.it/i03qbartslrf1.jpeg,After Hours 1985 Movie Review (Spoilers) Griffin Dunne,"I just finished watching After Hours, and honestly, it was somewhat of a letdown. For years, I had this movie in my ‚Äúwatch later‚Äù list, tucked away as one of those films I‚Äôd eventually get around to. I‚Äôd always seen it in Scorsese‚Äôs filmography, heard it recommended multiple times, and built up pretty high expectations. By the time the credits rolled, I found myself looking up what genre this movie was even supposed to be.  
  
Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚ÄîI enjoy farce and screwball comedies‚Äîbut this film felt more grounded, closer to a crime/drama with absurd misfortune sprinkled in. I hardly laughed at all. Based on the description, I expected more of a crime angle‚Äîmaybe Paul stumbling into something he wasn‚Äôt supposed to see involving the mob or mafia. Instead, it played more like a series of unlucky events, which I guess is where the ‚Äúcomedy‚Äù comes in.  
  
I did enjoy the beginning. Watching Paul‚Äôs dull routine gave us a clear sense of his boredom and longing for change. When he meets Marcy, she seems quirky but harmless, and nothing about the movie feels odd just yet. After she gives him her number, he calls and gets invited over at 11:30 p.m. That‚Äôs where his misfortune begins.  
  
From the reckless taxi ride (and the lost $20) to the awkward introduction to Marcy‚Äôs roommate Kiki, the film sets the tone quickly. When Paul and Marcy finally get coffee, the conversation about The Wizard of Oz felt genuine and hinted at chemistry. But the more time they spent together, the stranger Marcy became‚Äîreserved, suspicious, whispering to Kiki in the other room. Paul tried to connect, but she kept pulling away. By the time she opened up about her personal issues, Paul was already regretting the whole night.  
  
This pattern continues through the rest of the movie: one bizarre, uncomfortable encounter after another. The sequence with the ice cream truck chasing Paul might be the only part that really felt like screwball comedy. Most of it, though, leaned more toward exaggerated realism‚Äîthings that could happen, but stretched to the point of absurdity.  
  
My biggest issue is that the film felt aimless. Paul‚Äôs only real goal after things soured with Marcy was to get home, yet everything kept stopping him. The story hovered in constant conflict and rising action, but never really hit a satisfying climax or resolution. Instead, it felt like one long string of meaningless encounters, with characters who had little connection to Paul.  
  
That‚Äôs not to say the film didn‚Äôt have strengths‚Äîthe acting was excellent, and the dialogue was sharp. But overall, it was too serious to be a screwball comedy and too exaggerated to be a straight drama. For me, it fell somewhere in between, never fully committing to either.  
  
Maybe I went in with expectations too high, or maybe I overthought it, but the randomness and lack of direction made the whole experience feel hollow. The message might have been meaningful, but the execution left me feeling adrift‚Äîmuch like Paul himself. I wish I could say I loved it, but I just can‚Äôt.",3,1758934290.0,moviecritic,1,1.0,False
