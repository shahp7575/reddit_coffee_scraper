1pa51b1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RenogyCommunity/comments/1pa51b1/how_to_use_a_digital_multimeter/,How to Use a Digital Multimeter,"Do you often have to deal with electrical circuits, devices, and components? A digital multimeter will be your efficient partner in diagnosing, troubleshooting, and testing. It is an ideal device for DIY projects and electrical repairs.

# What is a digital multimeter?

An electrical tool designed to measure electricity and display the stats in digital form is called a digital multimeter. Sometimes, it is also called a multi-tester or volt-ohm meter.

If you want to know whether or not your wall plug is functioning properly, you can use a digital multimeter to check for voltage, current, power, and resistance. You can also use this tool to test your power supplies, batteries, surge protectors, and other electrical equipment.

The most common features of a digital multimeter are measuring the DC voltage for batteries, AC voltage for electrical plugs, resistance in ohms, and current in amperage. When using a digital multimeter, always start with a high range. Then, you can adjust its range according to your requirements.

[A digital multimeter](https://preview.redd.it/kwc6jejtgr3g1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3d1f8c2095aa9de47a3f68400b172811ae3ca79)

# Why does a digital multimeter matter?

If you are concerned about faults in your electrical systems, you can use a digital multimeter to locate anything unusual. Primarily, the faults are of three types: misconnected, disconnected, or shorted wires. They can be very dangerous if not fixed on time. These faults may result in fire, sparks, smoke, and other similar safety risks.

The best thing about a digital multimeter is that it has the ability to isolate the issue promptly before it becomes a matter of serious concern.

# How to measure DC voltage using a digital multimeter?

This section presents a complete step-by-step guide to measuring DC voltage.

Step 1: Disconnect the battery charger or anything else connected to your battery. Technicians mostly use this tool to measure the car battery voltage.

Step 2: Set your digital multimeter to DC voltage. If you have an auto-range unit, you don't need this setting.

Step 3: Now, adjust how many volts you want to measure. If you don't know the exact number of volts, you can simply start from the highest setting and adjust it according to your needs later. If the tool is auto-range, you don't need this setting, either.

Step 4: Put the red wire in the DC voltage jack. V– or VΩ.

Step 5: Put the black wire into the COM jack.

Step 6: Connect the red plug to the positive terminal of your car battery.

Step 7: Connect the black wire to the negative terminal of the battery.

Step 8: Note the reading displayed on the multimeter's screen.

Step 9: Disconnect the red probe first and then the black one.

Most cars use 12V batteries. If the voltage you see on your digital multimeter is below 10.5V, it indicates that the battery voltage is low and needs recharging. If you see the readings in the negative number, simply switch the red and black probes with each other. The answer will still be the same but without the negative sign.

[Example 1](https://preview.redd.it/jqsaqndygr3g1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bc229d3986e14473275f878db3260148115cb42)

# How to measure AC voltage?

This section provides a step-by-step guide to measuring AC voltage, which is common for testing home appliances.

Step 1: Set the digital multimeter parameters to read AC voltage. Start with the highest range and adjust it later.

Step 2: Make sure that your multimeter is set to a higher voltage than the one printed on your cord—120 volts for small two-prong and higher voltage for three-pron appliances.

Step 3: Put the black wire into the COM jack.

Step 4: Put the red probe into the AC voltage jack. It is usually labeled with V, VΩ, or VΩmA.

Step 5: Put the other side of the black probe into the neutral slot of an AC plug.

Step 6: Put the other side of the red wire into the hot or live slot of an AC plug.

Step 7: Check the reading on the display. The volts for a small hand mixer and a coffee grinder will be 120V and 300V, respectively.

Step 8: Once you have the reading you need, remove the red wire first and disconnect the black probe.

Note: If your digital multimeter offers an automatic feature, set the correct AC mode manually to get more precise results.

[Example 2](https://preview.redd.it/k29iyfc2hr3g1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e069767d7c5466d0ab1b430356ee97cc83bf139)

# How to measure resistance?

Measuring resistance is crucial for diagnosing circuit problems. A digital multimeter can quickly verify if a resistor is working properly, as follows.

Step 1: Disconnect the component you want to test with the multimeter. Ensure it is removed from batteries or other circuitries to make sure no current is flowing through it.

Step 2: Set your multimeter to read the resistance in ohms. Look for a number on the resistor if it is mentioned. If mentioned, set the multimeter to that particular value or number.

Note: If you are not sure about the resistor's range, start with 200Ω or even higher. Some multimeters show “1.” This means that your resistor has a higher capacity than the current setting.

Step 3: Plug the black wire into the COM jack and the red probe into VΩ.

Step 4: Touch the other sides of both red and black probes to both sides of the resistor. You don't need to take care of positive and negative wires here.

Step 5: Gradually reduce the Ω range on your digital multimeter. Once your setting matches the resistor's range, a specific number will be displayed on the meter.

Alligator probes are useful for measuring the resistance of multiple resistors. They make the whole process a lot easier than usual.

[Example 3](https://preview.redd.it/tura3ff6hr3g1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=94805610c5a0863f79954c28e29346b732c2551d)

# Safety tips for using a digital multimeter

Though a digital multimeter is an incredible device for measuring current voltage, and resistance, it can't always be entirely safe. To avoid any inconvenience, follow the tips below.

1. Check the meter's rating Ensure your digital multimeter is rated for the voltage you want to measure. If it is not, an arc flash may occur. In that case, electrical current will leave the path and travel from one conductor to the other. It may cause injuries and even death (in the worst cases). Though most multimeters are rated for 600V, you should always know the limits.
2. Check for the correct setting mode Never forget to ensure you're in the correct setting mode before connecting the meter's probes to any circuit or connection. If you set the multimeter to read the current value and start measuring voltage with it, the meter will get damaged in no time.
3. Don't mix probes Always keep both probes away from establishing wrong connections. One mistake can lead to several issues with your meter and electronics. The red probe is always connected to the voltage/resistance, and the black probe to the COM jacks. Putting it in the amp port may result in a short.
4. Avoid shorting out wires with probes The correct placement of probes requires your careful attention. If you touch a probe to a connector mistakenly, it can short out wires and circuit boards on devices. This may make your electronics worthless.",1,1764464450.0,RenogyCommunity,0,1.0,False
1pa50ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastroparesis/comments/1pa50ep/post_viral_delayed_gastric_emptying/,Post viral delayed gastric emptying,"Hey all. I've been browsing this sub for a while now, decided to make my own post to hopefully get some support. 

Back in May this year, I'm positive that I contracted norovirus or maybe food poisoning, and threw up more than ever in my life, 6 times in one night. Since then I've been struggling with bloating, early satiety, intermittent nausea, but thankfully I haven't thrown up since. 

I've had to make several lifestyle changes like cutting out soda, coffee, ice cream and the like. It was very unmanageable for me, I ended up requesting Reglan and took the doses for the next twelve weeks starting from the being of September. I'm now out and cannot get anymore since it has permanent side effects if I take it more than 12 weeks. I don't want to risk it. 

Due to work firing key team members, a lot of their responsibilities were shunted to me despite me never doing those parts of the job (for context, I'm in the authorizations dept for an ABA therapy company and after they fired the Intake Lead and the accounts receivable girl, they want me to now reach out to clients and families when they lose insurance, eligibility, etc). Because of all my other tasks and projects on top of these additional responsibilities I was never trained for, my stress has never been higher. 

I've reached out to my doctors for mental health therapy and they also believe that anxiety medications like Lexapro can help with my stress and also help my stomach as well as some wellness. I used to be able to lift weights, walk 10k steps a day, but without my medication and my bloating in the morning, I feel too unwell to workout and constantly nauseous or bloated. 

It's been 6 months that I've been struggling -- is there an end to this? Is this my life now? I've lost some weight, that's been a positive, but it's been so much harder to balance the rest of my life now. Are there other things I can try, other techniques, medications, hacks? I'll take anything at this point. Thank you all in advance.",1,1764464390.0,Gastroparesis,1,1.0,False

My neighbors missing kid was right there in my wife’s hands, my wife looked gigantic compared to the infants small body. My wife, she’d chewed through the lower half of its body, there was no way it could still be alive.

I didn’t sleep after I dragged her back home. Didn’t even pretend. I just sat on the couch in the dark, staring at her bedroom door, waiting for something to tear through it. The way she’d looked at me in the woods wasn’t hunger or madness. It was instinct. Like something else was piloting her body.

When the sun finally crawled up, I went to make coffee. The smell hit before I even touched the machine — that sweet, rotten tang of fermented fruit and dead meat. The sink overflowed with knives I didn’t recognize. Heavy ones. Serrated ones. Ones with bone dust caked in the grooves.

Footsteps behind me. Slow. Dragging.
“I cleaned,” she said.

I turned. She hadn’t cleaned a damn thing. She’d gutted the kitchen. Every cupboard emptied. Every dish gone. The table shoved aside so she could lay down a sheet of thick black tarp, the kind used in places where blood is basically a guarantee. The floor around it crackled with dried brown smears.

“What is this?” I asked.
She smiled like a puppet. “A workspace. It’s easier this way.”

My brain refused to process the rest.

The house didn’t change overnight. It decayed. First she dragged our chest freezer from the garage into the dining room and packed it with towel-wrapped shapes that dripped. Then she ripped the doors off the cabinets because “the smell gets trapped.” She hammered hooks into the walls and started hanging things. Limbs. Skins. Tiny ribcages like snapped umbrellas. Some were animals.

Some weren’t.

I forced myself to leave early, come home late, pretend everything was fine. But the house kept transforming into a butcher’s den, and she drifted through it like she’d been born to do it.

On the fourth night, she made dinner. Candles only. The air was thick with that metallic tang you taste when you hold a penny on your tongue. She slid a plate toward me — a dark, soft-edged slab of meat that looked…wrong.

I didn’t touch it.
“You don’t trust me,” she whispered.

Her jaw twitched under her skin like something tightening from the inside.
“I’m worried about you,” I said.

She repeated the word like she was testing it. Then she leaned in and pressed her forehead to mine. Her breath was warm and sour, like it came from somewhere deeper than lungs.

“They’re all worried about me,” she breathed. “They watch me. They whisper behind the walls. They tell me what to eat. What to *want*.”

Her voice trembled.
“I’m trying to be good, Jack. I’m trying so hard.”

Her eyes weren’t bloodshot anymore — they were glossy, sharp, polished like stones. I refused the meat. She didn’t argue. She just smiled and ate it herself, slow, savoring every tendon that snapped between her teeth.

That night I stopped researching help and started researching monsters. Folklore. Possession. Curses. Because no mental illness teaches someone to crave carrion. No breakdown gives you instincts. No psychosis changes your body.

So I searched one word: **Wendigo.**

The deeper I read, the worse it lined up — not perfectly, but close enough to make my skin crawl. A hunger that wasn’t human. A spirit that seeped into a person through grief or desperation. Not possession. Corruption. A soul-rotting disease.

And the pattern matched.
Roadkill wasn’t enough anymore.
Animals weren’t enough.
She needed freshness.

The thought hooked into me like a barb: she’s cursed. She’s sick. I’m the only one who can fix it.

The house kept mutating. The living room became a drying room — strips of meat dangling from the ceiling fan like prayer flags from hell. She kept the fireplace burning nonstop because “it helps with the smell.” The bathroom turned into a washing station. Towels in the hamper dried stiff and crunchy. The hall closet filled with jars containing things I won’t put into words.

The only untouched space was our bedroom. I knew why. She was saving it.

Last night, everything tipped. I came home at 2 a.m., after hours of driving just to avoid the place. The house was dark but alive — faint thumps, dragging sounds, soft humming like someone crooning in their sleep.

I followed it to the kitchen.
She was bent over the tarp table, cutting something, humming a lullaby my mother used to sing. Something small lay wrapped in a blanket. A blue one. Covered in cartoon planets.

The neighbor’s kid had that blanket.

The one who’d gone missing.

My chest caved in. She didn’t even notice me. She was too focused, too gentle with her blade, whispering, “I’m learning. I’m getting better. I’m almost perfect.”

I backed away, silent, my heartbeat shaking my ribs. And the entire time one thought pulsed through my skull:

If she’s cursed, she’s not responsible.
If she’s not responsible, she can be cured.
If she can be cured, I can save her.

By the time I reached the bedroom, I believed it completely.

So today, I bought chains. Real ones — the kind used to pin down engines. I bought heavy locks, industrial ones. A space heater for the crawl space. I sat in my truck afterward, staring at myself like a stranger.

I’m not doing this because she’s dangerous.
I’m doing it because she’s sick.
I’m her husband. I swore to take care of her.

Tonight, I’ll bring her into the crawl space. I’ll talk soft, hug her so she doesn’t suspect anything, then chain her down. Keep her warm. Feed her whatever she needs. Work on a cure.

I can fix this. I have to. I’m the only one who knows what she’s turning into. And the only one stupid enough to still believe she can come back.

The scratching above the ceiling just stopped.
She knows I’m awake.
She’s standing outside the door. Breathing. Slow. Hungry.

I’m opening the door now.

Wish me luck.

Please go check them out for context with this one and let me know what you think.

Episode Five:

We are in the meeting room and Robert is explaining the punishment he and Z-Team are facing after yet another situation where members of this team were taken, they investigated the matter themselves without the permitted authority, were also taken and needed saving outside of shift patterns and without following protocol. Clearly Z-Team can't be trusted to not make a big mess even on the night shift, so they will be working as support for Mandy's Angels. When they go fight kaijus, save buildings and save the city, your team saves cats from trees, fetches people coffee and even have to babysit.

Mandy's Angels are following the rules and starting to work together. The new boss sees them as a shining light of what he wants the Phoenix Program to be, whereas the Z-Team are arresting mob bosses and stopping ancient gods but are being reckless and irresponsible. The whole team is at risk of being cut, if we don't sort ourselves out. Robert asks the team to do their very best for their shift today and they all leave to prepare.

Well, all except Flambae and Prism, who remind Robert they have the day off today. Booked as holiday, so that they could go compete in a locally televised talent show called 'The Walk Of Shame'. Each show has five contestants who go on stage, perform for three judges and they decide if they qualify for the final round or are shamed and eliminated. After that, the audience at home decide who wins the show and takes home $100,000.

Robert has a choice. He can either wish them luck and let them know to contact him if they need anything. He can either request for them to stay because the team needs them right now. He can say he doesn't care and they can do what they want. Every choice ends with them still going but they will remember how Robert felt about them leaving.

During your shift, you start to get readings of a device similar to the freeze ray and heat ray somewhere in the city. This device can manipulate electronics and is very powerful. It starts to cause blackouts across the city and is putting a lot of people in danger. You are able to find the source is coming from the same building 'The Walk Of Shame' is being filmed. It turns out onw of the other woman Flambae and Prism are competing against is the same woman who bribed the judges to win a talent show, which caused Prism to react and was the cause of her powers to appear. Prism believes this woman got her hands on the device somehow and is using this powerful electronic tech to win another competition against her.

As you continue your shift, your screen is hacked and you can see 'The Walk Of Shame' being played, it is being shown on every screen in the city due to this device. This girl sings and is talented, so she goes through with the judges vote. The next person is a dancer and the technology around him starts to play up. Spotlights appear where he is not, the music starts to sound off and finally he is blasted in the face with a smoke machine and the judges shame his performance and kick him out. A stunt woman comes out next and starts up a couple of chainsaws but the technology causes them to stop working before she can start to juggle them. Lighting starts falling from the ceiling and one even hits her head, a medical team takes her away.

As Flambae enters the stage, he begins a stand-up routine. Robert hacks in (these next two hacks are the hardest hacks you will ever have to complete in a Dispatch game.) Flambae has three health bars, if you take too long or hit the wrong codes, he loses a life and there are sounds being played to embarrass him and put him off. If all of his health goes, the judges eliminate him from the competition and he blames you for not helping more.

As Prism enters the stage, she begins to sing about the woman who is cheating to win. Treating this moment like a roast to expose her and destroy her at the same time. The same type of complicated hacking task occurs but, if you fail, her performance is hampered by the screens going black and white, so the audience can't see Prism at her very best. The judges will put her through regardless but you need to succeed in order for Prism to win and have you to thank for it.

The woman wants to end Prism right here and now. She assembles technology from the studio to form robot type beings. Flambae has Prism's back and Robert goes to suit up as Mecha-Man. Royd stops Robert though, saying the suit is too damaged from the demon fight and you don't want a villain who can control technology to have access to Mecha-Man. Robert worries about getting there in time but realises the studio is just across the street. Your new boss stops you from leaving and orders you to stand down. Robert's shift is over and he should leave this to Mandy's Angels, who will take their time, come up with a plan and do the right thing. You can hear Flambae and Prism, in the headset which is still on your head, struggling and needing immediate assistance. You have a choice. You can either apologise to your new boss but this is something you have to do. You can state your team needs you and a hero is never off duty. You can tell your boss to go fuck himself, you will do what needs to be done. The whole office will hear you and remember that.

If you go after the woman, you are slowed down by the robots but Flambae and Prism got your back until you take the device away from her and the robots fall to pieces.

I am quite familiar with espresso and I love the body of it and all the things that come along with its preparation, but since I’m away from home I don’t have my espresso machine. Therefore I got myself a used grinder and a V60 to stay on a budget (or not waste money, since I have a machine at home, but I wanted to upgrade my Baratza ESP anyways) and at the same time learn the art of V60. 

I got some fantastic beans. Light to medium roast, fruity, fresh, just beautiful. But I can’t seem to get the hype of the V60. My pour overs taste very close to water. I’ve been doing 15g to 250g. 50g bloom for 30s then pours of 50g every 10s with 10s pauses until 250g. On the grinder I use a 50-60 grind. All in all it takes around 3m for the full extraction. 

And I’m wondering whether I just don’t really get the whole idea of a pour over or I’m missing something that will make me unveil a whole new world (which I’m really hoping to). In espresso the tastes are very obvious and clear, but in my V60 I taste slightly flavored water. But I want to taste these beautiful beans 🥲

Please help me understand what I can do to make it taste fantastically :)

PS. I’m not expecting the body of espresso or anything. I just want to have some coffee where I can taste all the notes and not water that kind of tastes like coffee. ",1,1764463989.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

You made it. Thirty days of showing up to write jokes, try new angles, surprise yourself, and occasionally scare me (some of you sent me some pretty messed up stuff). 

30 days is something to be proud of. Today is about looking back at the month and noticing what you’re genuinely grateful for. It could be a person, a tiny moment, a weird habit that kept you going, or even a joke that bombed in a way that secretly taught you something.

Let yourself enjoy the feeling of finishing. If you want to tie it all together, call back to something from earlier in the month and give it a final twist. Or keep it simple and sincere. You’ve earned the freedom to do this one your way.

If Jokevember brought you joy, helped your writing, or just became part of your routine this month, [you can buy me a coffee through the link](https://buymeacoffee.com/jokevember). Thank you for being part of this.

I love him so much I would literally give my kidney to him or take a bullet for him there are only 3 other people I would do that for. We traveled together and we had a long distance relationship for a year that went well and then we been living together for almost 2 years. The problem is me I have a fear of abandonment from a traumatic life, I’ve been having mental breakdowns because something will set off fight or flight. Last year was my first year living away from home and out of a damaging environment. I had 3 mental breakdowns and then this year we moved into another place I had another mental breakdown. Before that we had a problem with trust because he wasn’t transparent and I was hurt with what I found out and resulted in me going through his phone. We never used to yell at each other but after we went to Japan we did. We had a really bad fight and my jealousy came out and it resulted in him being over the convo and he went into the office. My fight or flight kicked in and I started crying I thought he was abandoning me and I just wanted comfort and love not to hurt him, ( I would never hurt him) he wouldn’t allow me inside so I tried to open the door I was scared and I wanted his comfort. Everything I thought was okay after because he and I were going on dates after and he did something so sweet for my birthday. We also were having sex it’s not like we weren’t. He even bought us condoms for my period. He was stressed with school and went to his grandparents for a week he was calling me and texting me but not as much I thought he was busy. The week after he came back and broke up with me unexpectedly I was blindsided we had plans… and he did it in an awful way. He literally wrote me a letter about logistics and blocked me right away. We have been emailing. He gave me ten minutes to talk and our friend was there so I was embarrassed. I love him a lot. I want us back. I want a healthy relationship with him. I didn’t think I was good enough for consistent love. We are meeting for coffee in December back in our hometown. Can someone please tell me if my circumstances are too much or how to reverse the circumstances. I love him so much. Also pretty sure I’m either autistic or have cptsd.

As a child, we went to church a few times a year. I have been teaching my babies about the word of God & everything he does for us. There past couple of weeks has had me feeling like there is something I am not doing right? Like I am seeking some sort of guidance through this…

We have been through an absolute $hit storm the past few days trying to find a way to eat. Today I had a shift from 6am to 5pm. I wanted to make sure I got off earlier so I can pick up the babies & head to the food pantry. Welp to my surprise , we get there & they are closed until Monday & the only one open tomorrow is the next town over and I just don’t have the gas to make it. My head is going to exploded.

I feel like I am doomed & it’s humiliating. I am so freaking exhausted working so hard that some days I can’t afford basic necessities. We moved a few years ago due to my job position & after escaping domestic abu$e from my ex-partner (still incarcerated thankfully). I make over the threshold for government assistance & have applied for child-support but doesn’t make a dent in anything. I literally PRAY that my babies see how freaking hard I am trying for them. Mama is tired, exhausted & overwhelmed doing this by myself. My family is non-existent after I cut them off financially from moving. When will this get easier ? I am hopeful that God will truly show me the path I am suppose to be on & teaching my kids that nothing would be possible with Him. 

I am disappointed in myself. My elderly neighbor brought us two frozen Hot Pockets & a bag of oranges until I can find a solution. I’m tired of crying. I need sleep. I need coffee. I need my bible. I need peace. I just want my babies to know that I’m doing my best. God truly knows the amount I have on my plate. Never give up friends. Talk to God. He is listening.

tips! 
-you can use any diet soda; sometimes i use diet root beer and diet cream soda and sometimes i use this diet double fudge soda i found at market basket from polar. you can taste the soda you use slightly but not strongly
-the ""batter"" will be 100% liquid when you pour it in your baking container, this is fine
-erythritol is just a granulated zero cal sweetener, i use stevia! you can use agave or whatever you want
-i drizzle a little sf maple syrup over the brownie once i take it out of the oven and it makes it fudgier

Hey everyone! I’m 33 born and raised in Michigan. I’m looking to meet new people to chat with, vibe with, and hopefully build some easy, genuine friendships.

A little about me:

I’m big into anything outdoors during the summer, spring, and fall—hiking, kayaking, camping, all of it.

In the winter, I basically transform into a homebody who loves reading, binging TV shows, drinking too much coffee, and enjoying cozy vibes.

Personality-wise, I’m friendly, laid-back, sarcastic, and a bit silly once I’m comfortable around someone.

I’m open to chatting with anyone as long as the conversation flows and the energy is good.

If you want someone to talk to during weird hours, share hobbies with, or just laugh with about random life stuff, feel free to message me.",1,1764462592.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

Right now I’m using a Kingrinder K6, which has been solid, but I’m ready for a meaningful step up in cup quality — specifically for pour-over.

My coffee preferences:
	•	I drink almost exclusively light to light-medium roasts.
	•	I love juicy stone fruit, floral, sweet coffees, especially Central American, Colombian, and Ethiopian origins.

I kind of second guess my ability to truly dial in coffees and all the talk about just how much clarity the Pietro and Zp6 give is kind of intimidating. People talk like you lose all the body and sweetness which I’m not 100% sure would be for me (however my favorite cup of all time was from Kawa and it tasted like strawberries it was unbelievable).

I already follow all the common rules: sleeping reclined, fragmented intake of food, big stop on all the forbidden food like coffee and spices (etc), i take probiotics, anti-acid (IPP, the stuff that block the pump of protons, i don't know the english name), i take sodium suldate anyhdre (oxyboldine, a kind of salty alcalin powder), fermented potatoes juice, infusions of minth, i eat ginger all the day, i tried aloe vera with teerible results, i tried homeopathy, acupuncture, massages, and NOTHING i do or take helps in any significant way.

Hence i can't eat properly, i'm starting to lose weight (and I'm constantly in pain and hungry like never in my life). 

Even eating 4 almonds trigger a multiple jours crisis. I'm at my ropes'end and loosing hope since ir's happening so early in the pregnancy.

Then my old man suggested I try what he does Friday nights - just sit outside with a drink and a cigar, phone off, no agenda. I thought it sounded boring as hell and kinda bougie but I was desperate enough to try anything.

Turned out to be the thing that actually worked for me. Now I do it every Friday - pour some bourbon or make coffee depending on mood, grab a decent cigar, and just... exist for an hour. No podcast, no ""optimizing,"" just sitting there watching the sky change.

[The Chosen One \(Is a Moron\)](https://www.noplotonlylore.com/one-page-rpgs/the-chosen-one-is-a-moron)

There is a prophecy. The person who is meant to fulfill that prophecy is a well-meaning idiot. Your job, and the jobs of your fellows, is to make the prophecy come true at any cost so that the big dummy can thwart the Big Evil. 

**What I Like About This One**

It’s hard to do the Chosen One trope in RPGs because the entire medium of games is agency. Not to get too into the weeds on theory, but the choices that we make and the free will we exercise are the tool we use to create the Art Moment of a game. That experience isn’t necessarily undermined by narrative tropes around destiny, but those tropes can feel really restricting, at times in ways that can de-value the artistic experience of the participants. So having your player characters be the Chosen One without explicit buy-in as to what that means can be kind of disastrous. 

Making the Chosen One a) a non-player character and b) a dummy presents some interesting opportunities for how to utilize free will and agency towards a specific goal - how do we get this moron to fulfill the prophecy in a way that will actually let us destroy the Great Evil? 

Also, I love the idea of a random prophecy, so mad-libs! 

**What I’d Do Differently Next Time:** 

I’d maybe consider a few different types of prophecy? I feel like this one is really cute in concept but kinda lacks in the execution department, so if I do come back to this idea it’s going to probably require I go back to the drawing board completely. It’s playable as is, but I think I could find ways to execute on these concepts better with some more room maybe.

I’ve lived in Seattle for twenty years and I enjoy planning trip itineraries. Thought I’d share the perfect Seattle “day” inspired by our favorite show.

Suggestion: stay anywhere downtown or the Washington Athletic Club Inn if you choose to play squash. 

8:00 AM: enjoy a latte with just a *whisper* of cinnamon at Storyville Coffee Pike Place. Send back if it comes with a full-throated shout.

9:00 AM: have a squash date at the Washington Athletic Club. You’ll need to be staying at the hotel there to access for the day. Tiny white shorts required.

10:00 AM: head back to the hotel for a bubble bath with a proprietary blend (just a *hint* of Tahitian vanilla).

11:30 PM: lunch at Le Pichet

1:00 PM: visit the Seattle Antiques market. Decide against a pair of Toby jugs.

2:00 PM: stop by Downtown Spirits for a bottle of sherry.

2:30 PM: enjoy a glass of said sherry while putting on your finest attire.

5:30 PM: early dinner at Cafe Campagne. If ordering steak, be sure to get a petite filet mignon. Not cooked, just lightly seared. Not so fat that it leaves drippings on the plate. Some pink, not a true pink, but not a mauve either, bearing in mind that the slightest error either way and it’s ruined.

7:30 PM: attend a performance at the Seattle Symphony, provided it’s not Mahler. Pre-order your drink for intermission, the line gets very long.

9:30 PM: nightcap at Underbelly. Don’t be surprised if you run into your furniture polisher.

Open to feedback from any other Seattleites or any other stops to be made on the trip.

Right now I have a Breville Infuser (basically the Barista Express but without the built-in grinder). It's been my trusty machine for a while and I'll be passing it along to a family member.

I got fixated on Profitec Move - I love the look, the handles/joysticks, the features, dual boiler, etc. Checks every box and had it been not for the dimensions, I'd have it here already.

My only issue is the depth. I have a coffee bar where I have my whole setup - With the Move coming in at 445 mm (17.52 inches) it's going to take up the entire depth of the counter and possibly stick out a bit. Redoing the couter is out of the question 😂 All the other dimensions of the move are fine.

The max depth I think that'd work for the espresso machine is probably around 14 inches (~355mm) deep. Width - also about 12-14 inches. Height about the same - though I'd wonder how weird a 14x14x14 espresso making box would look like!

Especially complete strangers,"i never use Reddit or even social media at all but this is your sign to mind your business when you see a man speaking for his woman.

I’m 38 and my wife is 26. she is extremely quiet, honestly not very smart and gets anxious. she’s working on it, she even takes a social skills class but she struggles.

a lot of times I speak for her, especially at restaurants to make sure she gets what she wants.

for example today we go to a coffee shop she wanted to try, she absolutely loves coffee. the menus only had one price so she thought there was one size, she orders her iced latte and they asked if she wants a small one and holds up a tiny cup and she said sure. I said no sorry she’ll take the large, and the barista said something dumb about ”i think she can make her own decisions“

like no, she wants a large. I know her pretty damn well and yes she wanted a large. why she froze up and said yes I can’t tell ya.

a few weeks ago a woman was asking her about which way she took to get somewhere, I wasn’t in the car but i knew which way she would take, and doesn’t know any street names so I answered. everyone around was like “oh let her answer!!!” no, she doesn’t know. she literally could not name a single street name in the town we’ve lived in our whole lives.

she is a housewife, she hardly goes out and isn’t extremely social. when we are in social settings she appreciates me helping her.

she is actually making a bit of progress but people act like I’m abusing her and they don’t know anything about her

she wants me to speak for her!! she’s fine!!! she’s actually completely spoiled rotten and gets anything she wants lmaoo. I don’t mind doing it at all, I just hate the people that think they know everything about us",0,1764461439.0,TrueOffMyChest,39,0.35,False

First, the location is hidden. Somewhere in the middle of the city below a clinic thats lowkey hard to stumble upon. They told me that the realtor said the city be building a park near by (the park wasnt built til 3 years later). The color scheme is not very good, and the interior designer/contractor didn’t do a good job. The furniture is from Ikea and some cheap wobbly chair and tables. Oh yeah, can’t forget the under-the-table professor who was supposed to be helping us build the coffee shop but ended up scamming us $100k and fleeing from what I heard. They didn’t realize they got scammed till recently. Now they actually started to take my advice but they’re still skeptical since I’m the youngest of the family and also 18 years old. They think that I don’t know anything about business which is very frustrating to me. We tried selling it but the bank said we’re too much in the negatives to sell it. They forced me to quit the job I love to help support this business that I never wanted in the first place. They said they’re at the verge of bankruptcy so I need help reviving it so that we can sell it and I can finally be free.

1pa3uqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1pa3uqw/abdominal_obesity_despite_my_efforts/,Abdominal obesity despite my efforts," I am abdominally obese. This is something loved ones have told me time and time again, but I'm finally admitting it now. I don't know what to do anymore

On a given day (over the course of about a month), I eat anywhere from 1200 to 2400 calories (though on most days I eat closer to 2000) 

I've been minimally active ever since I started studying full time. I try to spare time for exercise, but honestly it slips my mind more often than not.

I'm 5'5, mid 20s, 140lbs last I checked. My weight's been slowly but steadily increasing over the last 10 years. At first it was normal, but it doesn't show any sign of stabilizing at all.

I struggle with fiber intake, but about a month and a half ago, I started making an earnest (and surprisingly regular) effort to include it in my diet for at least one meal (usually boiled spinach and yes I like it. I'm hoping to try new leaves soon, so recommendations are welcome)

I dink only water, no coffee, no alcohol, no soda, no juice, and almond milk sometimes (but that's at most twice a month, no joke). I only eat bread with almond milk so that's not often. I eat rice (about 2-3 days/week) because I have to, but I usually avoid it when I can.

I'll admit I like sugar, but I don't drink milk anymore so that's gone down exponentially. I will say I've been eating more candy bars recently (3-5x/week) since finals season is near. I only bake during my weeks off (which means once or twice every 3ish months) 

I try to drink water, but I'll say I forget if my bottle isn't in sight. 

I've taken a liking to spice recently, but I don't eat it with every meal since I tend to eat faster than is healthy if my food is spicy.

Over the last two weeks, I've been sleeping less (again due to finals) but this has been an ongoing problem even before.

All that is to say, I'd like to think I'm not doing half bad at taking care of myself. All the things I've quit, I've done so since at least covid times and I haven't gone back (I mean the sugar, rice, bread...) 

I feel like despite what I'm not doing as well as I should, I should at least not have the figure I do? My arms and legs are fine, but my stomach is twice the size it should be and it's not loose. It doesn't have as much give as apron bellies usually have (before or after eating)

I might hate myself now and I don't want to. So I'm looking for solutions.

I've known her since about two years ago, but until this year we talk more

She loves physical contact and is too touchy with me: we hug often, she passes her hand over my hair and stuff like that. I don't recall her being like that with other men, but as I said, she likes physical contact so I don't think it's anything special with me, she just trusts me enough

About three months ago we were in a group of friends and formed a ""family"" as a joke, so she and I are wife and husband and the joke remains. For example I ask: ""How's my wife doing?"" and she replies the same way. Some weeks ago I've started to realize I like her: she's so pretty and I love our chemistry. So I've used the same joke to say flirty stuff, like: ""I'm so proud of my wife"", ""would you accept me if...?"" or sometimes when we're sat down I extend my hand for her to grab it (she does). She's the same towards me, for example she had something in her face, I pointed it out and she said: ""you could've removed it yourself, grabbed my face and kisses me"", sometimes asks kinda jealous and stuff like that. I've always taken that as a joke because that perfectly fits her personality

Next week we'll go out for a coffee (that was my invitation, no word ""date"" said) and she said: ""of course I want a date with you"".

1pa3ucg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1pa3ucg/maximize_your_day_smart_life_optimization_hacks/,🚀🤯 Maximize Your Day! Smart Life Optimization Hacks for Less Stress & More Success. 💡🧠,"Hey Maximizame crew,

Ever have one of those days where you're busy from sunup to sundown but at the end of it, you feel like you accomplished... nothing? 🙋‍♂️ I've been there more times than I can count. Your to-do list is a mile long, notifications are pinging, and you're just *reacting* all day instead of *acting*.

It’s exhausting. And honestly, it’s not productive.

Over the years, I've found that it's not about adding more to your plate. It's about optimizing the plate you already have. Here are a few game-changing hacks that have seriously helped me cut through the noise.

**1. The ""1-3-5"" Rule** 🧠

Forget endless to-do lists. Each day, plan to accomplish:
*   **1** Big thing (the major task that moves the needle)
*   **3** Medium things (important, but less demanding tasks)
*   **5** Small things (quick wins, like answering a specific email or making a phone call)

This brings immediate clarity. You *know* what a successful day looks like before it even starts. It's a total game-changer for focus.

**2. Slay ""Decision Fatigue"" Before Breakfast** 💡

Think about how many tiny decisions you make before 9 AM: What to wear? What to eat? Which email to answer first? It drains your mental battery before the real work even begins.

My hack? Make those small decisions the night before.
*   Lay out your clothes.
*   Prep your coffee/breakfast.
*   Write down your ""1-3-5"" list for the next day.

You wake up with a clear path, preserving your best brainpower for the stuff that actually matters.

**3. Run an ""Energy Audit""** 🚀

This one is more of a mindset shift. For just one day, pay close attention to what *gives* you energy and what *drains* it.
*   **Drained** after that 30-minute meeting that could have been an email?
*   **Energized** after a 15-minute walk outside?
*   **Drained** after scrolling social media for 20 minutes?

Once you see the patterns, you can start optimizing your day around your energy, not just your time. It’s a subtle shift that makes a huge difference in managing stress.

Sometimes the stress and overwhelm aren't just about a busy schedule; it can feel a lot deeper than that. When my own mental game feels off and the standard hacks aren't cutting it, I've found that having a structured way to process those feelings is key. For anyone needing a little more guidance on that front, I've found **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** to be incredibly helpful for emotional support.

Anyway, these are just a few things that have helped me. It’s all about small, smart changes that add up over time.

1pa3u6a,https://tipstor.io/unlock-the-trip-you-never-thought-you-could-afford/,Unlock the Trip You Never Thought You Could Afford,"The room smells of bleach and burnt coffee and the electric buzz of servers pretending to be prophets. The pitch of the sales show has shifted. AI is no longer a weird exotic spice served to the boardroom elite. It’s the pantry staple. The math is savage and obvious. 78% of organizations now report using AI in at least one business function, a leap that turned cautious pilots into production lines overnight, according to McKinsey. Investors answered with wallets open. U.S. private AI investment hit USD 109.1 billion in 2024, a pile of capital big enough to change strategy meetings into fights over tooling and talent at the executive table, Stanford HAI reports.

The travel and hospitality world is learning to cook with that fire. The AI in hospitality and tourism market grew from USD 15.69 billion in 2024 to USD 20.39 billion in 2025, a 30% year-over-year sprint that did not ask for permission, according to The Business Research Company. Travelers are already tasting the future. 35% of American travelers used AI to book summer vacations in 2025, nearly doubling some cohorts within a year, a trend highlighted by Adyen’s hospitality report. This is not futurism. This is someone swapping out the maître d’ for a recommendation engine that remembers birthdays and preferred aisle seats and then sells upgrades before the plane finishes taxiing.

Data lifecycle management is the unsung butcher, baker, and candlestick maker in this story. Every byte that flows through the hotel PMS, the OTA, the loyalty app needs to be groomed. Cleaned, labeled, versioned, governed, and then fed into models that have appetites for consistency and context. EY’s Data 4.0 playbook maps this. Organizations building AI-ready data foundations across discovery, ingestion, cleaning, cataloging, and monitoring win not only accuracy but speed-to-insight. That speed translates directly into revenue when models can identify a last-minute cancellation and the system automatically prices a flash offer to the right micro-segment, nudging occupancy up and per-guest spend higher.

Lifecycle techniques become revenue levers when combined with operational ruthlessness. Ingest raw logs from booking paths, enrich with third-party intent signals, de-duplicate guest profiles, apply identity resolution, run experiments to see which message moves wallets, and then bake the winning creative into an always-on orchestration engine. This is how AI-driven personalization turns into USD 10s or 100s of incremental revenue per user. Because the organization is not guessing, it’s executing learned playbooks at scale. The competitive advantage is brutal. Firms that master lineage and model monitoring can iterate faster, detect drift before revenue tanks, and recover trust when models misbehave.

New trends hitching a ride on the wave are worth the price of attention. Agentic AI, systems that plan and execute multi-step workflows, is moving from geek-speak into operations, with 23% of organizations scaling agentic systems and another 39% experimenting, per McKinsey’s State of AI. Generative models now sit at the front desk, drafting tailored itineraries, composing upsell messages, and even improvising apologies that sound human when rooms are overbooked. Expect a layering of privacy-preserving ML and on-device inference as regulators and latency demands push work away from central clouds. The consulting arms of the world smell the margin. Tech consulting is projected to top USD 400 billion in global revenue by 2026, and much of it will be poured into AI transformation projects that include data lifecycle hardening.

A concrete travel playbook. Launch travel subscriptions and build a membership economy that customers cannot help but join. Offer exclusive perk. Monthly credits for experiences, priority rebooking, dynamic room upgrades, and bundled add-ons like fast-track at airports. Combine that with lifecycle-driven personalization. When a subscriber’s behavior signals a honeymoon or family reunion, the system upsells curated packages and partners that increase trip spend. AI classifies intent, predicts ancillary purchase probability, and sequences offers. One click becomes USD 50 to USD 300 in ancillary revenue because the model knows what will resonate and when.

Case study material is everywhere in the margins. Providers that layered AI into loyalty engines and inventory management reported higher retention and better yield management. The trick is orchestration. Combine a robust data catalog with continuous model evaluation, automate retraining when performance decays, and instrument attribution so every dollar spent on model training can be tied back to revenue uplift. That is lifecycle management that smells like profit.

The business of AI is also a cautionary tale. Talk of bubbles and overvaluation arrived at the gates this year as markets chased the promise of AI. Investors should remember that technology is a lever, not a miracle. The winners will be those who treat data like capital. Carefully maintained, auditable, and deployed in feedback loops that close rapidly. Firms that skip lineage or ignore monitoring will find themselves with brittle models, angry customers, and wasted budgets.

The map ahead is clear. Stitch AI into the data lifecycle. Make the models accountable. Monetize with subscriptions and tailored offers. And watch the revenue curve bend upward. The narrative of travel and hospitality in the AI era is not about machines replacing warmth. It’s about systems that free humans to do what machines cannot. Design hospitality that feels intentional while letting algorithms handle the heavy lifting of personalization, pricing, and timing. This is a new menu, cooked fast, with expensive ingredients, and everybody in the kitchen needs to know the recipe.

I found a sweet cut stump of wood down in oregon, and I'd like to turn it into a base for a glass coffee table. After talking with a friend I ruled out trying to take it somewhere to get it cut into planks, but I've come up with a couple ideas for how to chop this thing up into something pretty. Would really appreciate any advice/ideas!

  
I think idea 1 is the simplest to execute and I could play around with the shapes a bit. I'm really liking idea 3 the best, but I think hollowing out some of the stump would be much easier said than done (I think I'd be using a chainsaw to do so). I think I'd want to have it be a bowl shape with the glass on top, and I could cut some nice shapes into the sides. If it were too ugly, I could always flip it and just have it look like the stump.

Mentally and physically I am struggling, I am in tears writing this - I feel like my body and mind are giving up on me and my support system has gone. I am fighting as hard as I can, I really am, but it's just me now in reality. I have to recover, I have to accept the burden of this illness. Dad can't and isn't helping me, he isn't in the position to, my sister always said this to me coming out of hospital - dad isn't well enough mentally to look after you. Initially I think yes he tried and did help but his alcoholism, on top of his cancer diagnosis has sent him spiralling and he is becoming more and more volatile and emotionally abusive when drunk. It is all too much for him (and me). He also doesn't have any real knowledge on EDs and I know he doesn't really know what to say, hence the comments about sugar etc. Realistically though, I am an adult, this is my recovery and I should know this and shouldn't ask him, when I know it could trigger me so badly and he isn't well himself. But he is the only person I have to ask in the moment. The things he is starting to say are really horrible, and although I know he is ill (mentally) is just is not helping my recovery at all! I think this is why I love and rely on this sub so much because you are my support, my guidance etc (although I know I am not the best at listening, I am trying).

Today my body just felt so weak at work, after I eat I seem to get very dizzy, so when I started work (after breakfast) it was hard to get going without feeling drained. It was also busy and this is just the start of it! Because I am going to be doing longer shifts over Christmas and it will be much busier. When I got home from work, I had my cheese and crackers and then I started to make dinner and felt so faint! But then after dinner and my cheesecake I felt extremely nauseous,  had to really force myself to have the biscuits because I FELT SO ILL! It could have been because the cheesecake wasn't great and there was a lot of ED thoughts about sugar which sent me spiralling, so it could have been anxiety but my body just feels so weird atm!

I am still going to plan to upload my plan for the week ahead because although I can tell a lot of you are sick of me right now and all my 'plans' it seems to be the only thing that is semi keeping me on track. Even today although not a great day or energy wasn't met, if I didn't have the plan and the comments from you guys, the comments from dad would have sent me to miss the cheesecake and probably the biscuits because of 'all the sugar'. So hopefully if I upload the plan for the next week ahead I can get some more input from you guys and work on tuning out dads opinions on sugars and sweets and 'my health' and actually meet my energy and challenge my fears!

I am constantly trying so remind my body is not maintainable, 2600 should be the minimum with my activity, energy is the main goal for now, sugar, fats etc can become a concern when I am at least near a healthy BMI and feeling better mentally to address these things. My diet may not be overly balanced atm but it has spent years the other way so a few weeks of 'extreme sugar snacks' won't kill me! Anyways, sorry for all the ranting, but writing these each night makes me feel so much better and gives me some hope I will do this.

1pa3co3,https://i.redd.it/q7ob8ojp8a4g1.jpeg,2-hr Allspice dram for Cocktail Advent,"I live somewhere where St Elizabeth’s does not exist. Never seen it, never tasted it. I’ve been thinking about making some allspice dram since I like a lot of tropical/tiki drinks, but seeing it on the list of bottles for the cocktail advent was the final push. 

Looking at some recipes, most have it infusing for 10-12 days. I don’t have that amount of time, what if **Monday** the first cocktail uses it?! 😆

Having made limoncello via sous vide before, I figured this wouldn’t be too different. 

Ingredients:
- 15g dried allspice berries
- 250ml Appleton 8 rum
- 200ml water
- 160g brown sugar

Recipe:
Lightly crush the berries, put in a ziploc bag with rum. Place in sous vide water bath set at 60C for two hours. Meanwhile stir brown sugar into water until dissolved. After 2 hours, strain infused rum via fine mesh colander, then coffee filter, into syrup. Bottle and enjoy. 

Verdict:
The allspice is not overpowering but very present. It’s nicely sweet without being sickly. Like I said, never tasted St Elizabeth’s before but I can’t imagine how it’d be dramatically better than this, it’s so tasty. Can’t wait to use it!",10,1764459740.0,cocktails,5,0.92,False

TLDR I'm not sure what steps to make now to end my situation. It's like my avoidant is stuck in limbo after discard.

Day 0 I had a talk with my avoidant (FA) after I took space after they upset me talking about their hookups when they had me meet their brother a week prior. I told them I was sensitive since I had a breakup a week prior, and their hookups and not being there for me made me feel like I was worth less than random ass to them. and I recognized they care, but this is what I need instead (a hug when I'm upset). This enraged them and they downplayed their actions, called me manipulative, were mad I wanted to spend the night at their place (for a game and drink night), accused me of the highs and lows (their constant push and pulling), Got mad I was ""all over them"" when I'd lay on their shoulder when they games (They would pull my head into their lap and stroke my hair) Got mad I would bring them a surprise when I thought of them to cheer them up when I visited them ( like toys for their cat), Got mad about a gag gift (they kept it for 6 days in their wallet to find a place for it), Got mad I didn't tell them my friend was SA immediately when I was at dinner with their brother, and finally got mad I didn't tell them about a guy I was seeing when I was not dating or physically Intimate with my FA. They told me I sent alarm bells off on them, that they were done with ""whatever this is"" and they needed distance and space. I was sad, and apologetic and told them okay. Later I saw them at our gay volleyball league where I see them weekly. They ignored me and I didn't chase. I was eating dinner with my teammate. Day 2, they tried to make me jealous at a party and I was snuggling my hot model friend and a lot of people were weirded out by their behavior. day 7 they orbited me at volleyball when I was practicing and playing and were spooked seeing me in line behind them so I gave them space. Day 9 they kept watching me at a bar so I rode a mechanical bull if they wanted a show, and was picked up by my two buff muscular friends. my FA proceeded to touch me innappropriately. Day 10 I ran into them ordering takeout so I ignored them but stood so they could see me. I did send an apology for what he was upset by, defended my actions slighty, and told him I would be there when he felt safe to come back. Day 15 they ran into me at a bar on halloween and stomped on my feet when I was with another guy twice, tried to make out with someone and looked spoked when I caught them, and then my FA decided to walk close to me when I was making out with a friend against a wall. Day 19 they interviewd at my job and I got them a coffee and a donut with a nice note that said good luck. Day 21 they chilled out but I injured my leg. They got a belated halloween gift bag from me indirectly. Day 22 they checked my dating profile for the first time (I have an obvious pic) when I saw them at the bar with a guy and I don't think he saw me. Day 28 I had 5 shots of whiskey before our volleyball game and kept lifting and hugging people when I drank. So He got jealous and kissed my friend on his team. That same friend was engaged that week and my FA did it in front of his fiance. Day 34 he immediately talked to a friend of mine he follows on snapchat. That friend ignored him and posted a selfie of me publicly. He tried to add another friend who is aware of this mess and the other friend immediately blocked my Fa. Day 35 he shows up to our Volleyball game with his toxic friends and I bring cupcakes to celebrate the engagement of the friend on his team who he kissed. He refused a cupcake from me. Day 41 I see him at a club where I am dancing with my friend. He looks at me a few times, smiling with my friend, he doesnt really dance, mainly talks to people at a VIP section and leaves to a nearby area after about an hour. Doesnt really dance and his friends leave with him. Day 42 I decide to give another olive branch and wish him happy thanksgiving to no response via text. I only texted twice. day 10 an apology. day 42 happy thanksgiving.

I just don't really know whats going on in my FA's head. He says ""he's done with me"" but also seems jealous when he see's me with another guy. He says he wants distance and space, but orbits me, watches me, and stomps on my feet and touches me weirdly. I've tried giving olive branches, and letting him know he can talk to me, but he just won't end this nonsense. I'm so ready to snap and tell him to just figure out what he wants because the weird jealous limbo is annoying. Either move on, or make up.",1,1764459610.0,AvoidantBreakUps,1,1.0,False

I hopped on Bumble and matched with this guy who is jaw-droppingly handsome and we have a good amount in common. My ex wasn’t exactly my type physically so this was a pleasant change, but we also had a lot in common and I was very very anxiously attached. I’m working on that to be more secure (although I admit this is not exactly my best show of that), so I’m trying to take things slow with this new guy, but especially with my lack of flirting practice and my brain wanting to immediately jump into girlfriend mode, I can’t help feeling like I’m screwing things up and he’s pulling away because of it. Not to mention I feel like an idiot because of how nervous he makes me when he looks into my eyes.

We started off with good conversation on the app and moved to texting. We are both really attracted to each others drive and motivation in careers and how we both keep up with the gym. We went on a super cute and casual first date about a week into texting to an arcade and hit a cookie place after. The spark was there, but I held back from kissing him. Almost every day after that, we texted and he would call me just to chat, and it was euphoric honeymoon stuff for sure. We had our next date planned to be a movie night a week from our first date, but the day before that we were FaceTiming and he ended up asking me to come to his place. After playing a bit of hard to get, I caved and I went over, we chatted, and then slept together. It was early, but it was mutual and exciting. We went our separate ways for work in the morning, then reconnected later that night for a movie night but he was super tired and said he didn’t have the energy to have sex that night. We did in the morning but it was a bit more awkward than the first time. I felt like that date recovered since we chatted over coffee after and went to a pet store to look at all the animals. Our conversations are good, I’m always a bit nervous talking with him because no one has ever called me just to talk before and when we’re in person his eyes distract me like crazy, but he’s super passionate about cars and bikes and I just don’t know a ton about them. I’ve always wanted to learn though, and I really really enjoy listening to him nerd out about them. I love hearing the passion in his voice and it is genuinely interesting to me but I don’t have a good enough baseline of knowledge to ask lots of follow-up questions. 

So then we went to our respective hometowns for thanksgiving. I didn’t expect him to text or call as much since hometown friends and family take up time, but he called me on his drive back home and I was caught off guard, sick, and a little high. I felt like i was quiet and struggled to flirt on the phone and I don’t know how he took that. There were a couple moments that were good and I picked it up but a lot of the call was him nerding out about cars and me just listening and struggling to come up with good responses with my foggy brain. At the end of the call he did say we’d talk soon and probably would see each other this week, but with him initiating conversation every few days now and leaving my texts on read for a little while before responding, I’m worried he’s losing interest cuz I can’t get my flirting game together. I did notice he changed up his bumble dating profile a bit, and while I don’t expect exclusivity at this point I was kinda hoping he wasn’t actively trying to get new matches. We’ll see how this week goes and I’m hoping seeing him in person again (assuming we do go out again) will make up for my recent nervousness.  

Would it look too pushy/desperate etc if I started initiating calls (he’s always called me first)? Im not talking 24/7 but my friends say I should be letting him initiate even if it takes longer or doesn’t happen at all. Am I just overthinking everything? Is he pulling away or is this just normal healthy talking stage behavior for 3 weeks in and holiday circumstances? Should I do anything differently aside from letting my nervousness make me freeze up? I would appreciate any advice to help my brain take a break trying to re-understand dating, even if it is that he may just not be as into me as I am into him.

1pa38mj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pa38mj,LomoGraflok at the local graffiti park,"So we have a new local graffiti park full of giant walls and containers where the kids can come and art to their heart's content. Practice tags, tag legally, make beautiful murals, draw a ~~penis~~ rocket ship, or just have fun being messy! (pretty sure I saw Hatsune Miku)

It's a lovely venue with restrooms, a coffee shop, plenty of parking, and no grumpy neighbors. They also sold paint on site, which seems cool?

I finally got to do what I bought this camera for: I set up in the middle and tinkered with it, and people walked up and said ""hey what is that?"" or ""that's old!"" or ""my grandpa had something like that"" and then we'd talk for a bit and I'd ask if I could take their picture.

And then I gave them the print and a sharpie and had them write a little caption.

It was GREAAT!

It was low-fi, low-effort, low-... something, but gobs of fun.

Apparently, the activity was enough that the Neurologist ordered stat Ativan to stop it from generalizing. But I didn't experience any strange feelings or anything. I do recall my mind being a little active, but I chalked it up to just having my morning coffee. Is it possible that I was just thinking too much during the test, and that's why I had abnormal brain activity?",3,1764459417.0,Epilepsy,3,1.0,False
1pa3899,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1pa3899/my_husband_was_unsuccessful_at_taking_his_own/,My husband was unsuccessful at taking his own life. I feel empty.,"In September my husband took a bunch of medication and washed it down with a lot of alcohol. He works from home, but rented a room at a nearby hotel for this act. Before following through he wrote an email to the local police informing them of his intentions and where they could find his body. He wanted to delay the message so the process could do its duty, but I think he messed that part up. They got to him pretty quickly and were able to save him.

I was at work. I was pulled into the principals office at the end of the day. A police officer started talking about what was happening and that he was alive and they were still working on him. They were going to let me know the hospital they were transporting him to so that I could call anyone I needed to meet me there. I felt like I was in a daze. Everything just seemed cloudy. I told him there was no way he was talking about MY husband. I saw him twice during the school day when he brought me coffee and lunch. Everything was completely normal.

Turns out my husband is an alcoholic. A liar. And clearly has no regard for mine and my daughter’s safety. I also later found out that he took a credit card out in my name. I had been telling his family that things were weird. He was sleeping at weird times. Seemed “drunk” many times. But we could never prove he had been drinking. And it was worse when he did anything in the sun. I kept asking him if he’d talked to his doctor. That he needed to find out what was wrong. His driving was erratic. I was here on Reddit asking about dehydration. Reading medical Reddits. I had finally decided that maybe he had a condition where his guts turned whatever was in there into alcohol (It’s actually a thing!). I think me telling him this and to ask his doctor scared him into realizing I may find out his secrets.

He was in the hospital for a month. In a mental facility for a week. He’s going to group therapy. Individual therapy. AA meetings. His family calls all the time. They invite him over regularly. I have been trying to process everything that I have learned about the man I’ve been married to for almost 25 years. Apparently this has been going on for the last 5-6 years, made worse by the isolation of COVID and working from home. He has slowly isolated himself and stopped talking to his friends. I tried to get him to go out with me. Take me to dinner or out with friends. Workout at the Y.  Nothing worked. We have lived separate lives for at least two of these years.

I am so angry. Thinking about all the times he drove drunk with my daughter and I or just her. He had no regard for our safety at those times. She would come home scared of how he was driving and how he behaved. He didn’t care. Said she was just being a brat. I had gotten to the point where I wouldn’t allow him to pick her up anymore or take her anywhere. He wasn’t allowed to drive me anywhere if I thought he was being weird. I KNEW HE WAS DRINKING! But I didn’t. Does that make sense? I feel stupid. I hate that I fell for his lies. I hate him so much, but also still love him. I hate him for treating me so well and loving me so much that I find it hard to leave him. Outside of all of this he is a great husband. The sweetest, most caring, and forgiving person I have ever met.

He’s relapsed three times. He lies every time. When he does he’s mad that he is still alive. He’s mad it didn’t work. He knows what he’s done to me and he doesn’t want to have to live with it. He thinks if he’s gone we will all be happier. We hide all the keys, his wallet, sometimes his phone. He’s not allowed to drive anywhere. We bought a breathalyzer to check when we suspect. My oldest son is treating his own father like he is the child. My daughter avoids him and treats him like her annoying little brother. I worry all the time. He just wants to be with me. If I leave he will try again.

I can’t help someone who doesn’t want to help themselves. It’s draining, tiring, stressful, depressing. I don’t want to talk to him. I feel like everything he says is a lie. There is no trust. No one knows what I’m going through. I have no one to talk to. I hide behind a fake smile and happy demeanor during the day and come home to my current life.",254,1764459404.0,TwoHotTakes,79,0.95,False

I worked in their production kitchen for nine months, and was continually overworked, underpaid, and mistreated by both the owner Eva Tomlinson and the HR manager Jamie Quinlin.

Firstly, it is worth noting that I am visibly transgender. Despite repeated requests and attempts for Eva and Jamie to correctly gender me, they both refused for the entirety of my employment. My kitchen supervisor did what she could to help, but was constantly undermined and overruled. The working environment always became immediately hostile when either of them decided to show up in the kitchen. 
 

Secondly, they have stolen and continue to profit from a recipe that I developed without appropriate compensation. My job was to execute recipes, not to make them. Regardless, I was asked to develop a gluten free bagel recipe. I was told that I would be compensated for going beyond the bounds of my typical responsibilities, but was ignored when I asked for an exact number. Eventually after they had been selling my bagels for a number of months, I was awarded a pitiful $0.75 raise. 

Overall, it was an extremely negative experience, and I highly recommend you support higher quality gluten-free bakeries. Native Bread is fantastic, and there are many others worth trying. ",42,1764458473.0,indianapolis,1,0.85,False

Australia is better than my native country at providing official public restrooms in parks and transit stations, so that's great.  But when I'm walking around in a random suburb without one of these nearby, I've sometimes been confused about what other options are available (e.g., what types of businesses to try).

In my home country, the go-tos would be a supermarket or a servo (they almost always have public bathrooms that you can use if you buy something), whereas it would be frowned-upon to use one in a pub/bar/restaurant/coffee shop if you were not sitting down to eat there.  But so far, I've had somewhat the opposite experience in Aus (maybe that's unusual)?  And one time (in a bit of desperation) I asked a small deli if I could use theirs and they kindly let me use this little one in the back where they had to walk me through their kitchen, and I felt like I was imposing (even though I bought something on the way out), so I'm not sure if that kind of thing is OK.

1pa2u7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pa2u7h/i_think_my_boyfriend_seriously_hates_me/,I think my boyfriend seriously hates me.,"      I, 17F, am dating my boyfriend 18M, and it’s a relatively fresh relationship. like, not even 2 months together fresh, so im not too concerned, however i am autistic, and really am not great at reading people, so some advice seems helpful at the moment.
      Me and him have known about each other, at the very least, for 4 years. Through mutual friends and whatnot, and i’ve always been interested, but he didn’t really pay any mind, so i assumed he wasn’t into me like that. my feelings died down to a manageable level, until this year when he was in one of my classes, and I got to spend time with him, and kind of get to know him, and it started all up again.
      A mutual friend of ours got tired of watching me suffer on the opposite end of the room, and ended up telling him, much to my dismay. He told her he wasn’t looking for anything, but he’d be happy to talk to me. Battle lost, I would say. He followed me, we talked a decent amount. Pretty often. He was sweet, caring, and didn’t laugh at my pointless anxiety, instead was there to make me feel better. it was nice. 
       I told my friend (-not the same as the original mutual friend-) about us talking, and how we were planning on going out for coffee that next day. She insisted this was a “talking stage”, a term i wasn’t too familiar with. and said she would discreetly talk to him and get things sorted. She wasn’t the best at explaining, and made it seem like i was actively freaking out and ripping myself to shreds over him because I couldn’t really put my finger to his intentions. (which, granted, was true. but i didn’t want him to know that.) He blew up my phone immediately after, and i muted him, to prevent the humiliation, mainly. When i got home that night, after a long drive of internal screaming and debating swerving off road, i opened the messages.
    Long story short, he didn’t address what was said, instead addressed the anxiety portion and checked up on me. He ended the conversation that night with the message 

‘Date is tomorrow at 10 btw x”

    Which threw me into another spiral. now he was calling it a date? Dear god, that’s a lot of pressure. Sparing you the gushy details, he asked me out on a bench while we had our coffee and enjoyed the last bits of warm weather, it was romantic, but had me thinking it was odd… he didn’t want anything originally, what was this?
       Now that the backstory is packed up, I can get to the real details. We never *had* a honeymoon phase. I haven’t had too many relationships myself so i don’t know if that’s an expectation or not, but he’s had plenty of exes, and all the ones i knew of, he definitely had one with. Instead of the talking all the time and into the late hours, we have brief interactions in class, and he sends me a half dozen instagram reels after he gets home. That’s about it. Unless he calls me at night (Which isn’t much better- we sit in complete silence between the typical ‘hey, how are you?’ and his snores.) Weekends? it’s a miracle if we talk at all.
      It just feels weird. He talks to his friends more than me, and never really seems happy to be interacting with me whatsoever. Always stone-faced, and ‘huh’s? After my ramble sessions. Not to mention the fact he has grindr installed (still.) and posts somewhat lewd pictures on his discord groups. I don’t know if this is a reason for concern, or if i’m overthinking things and am being a bit overbearing.

Any advice is appreciated, I apologize if my wording isn’t the best, i’m not used to platforms like this. Thank you!

1pa2tay,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1pa2tay/my_week_at_osa_peninsula_corcovado_national_park/,My week at Osa Peninsula / Corcovado National Park / San Pedrillo / Jaguar's Jungle Lodge,"I found this community helpful when planning my trip, so I just want to share what I learned from my experience in case it can be useful for anyone else now or in the future!

The goal of my trip was to have as many opportunities as possible to view wildlife in their natural habitats. We stayed at the [Jaguar's Jungle Lodge](https://www.jungladeljaguar.com/), and I am really happy with how nearly everything went! It was just me and my partner; this trip was not particularly family-friendly and not for children or anyone with physical challenges. I'd say you need to fall within a particular demographic to be the right fit for this kind of trip.

Landed at SJO in the afternoon; stayed one night at the Holiday Inn Express next to the airport. Took it easy and walked to dinner at [Bar & Restaurante La Casona Rio2](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BPx3np3Z55thWz7v7) (wanted to try something more local-ish than Denny's). The restaurant introduced us to chilera, which we really enjoyed and have now added to our culinary dictionary. 

Took a super early morning Sansa flight from SJO - Drake Bay. I LOVED our flights on Sansa. The views during the entire flight are spectacular. The plane is tiny and a unique experience in and of itself. The flights were smoother and less bumpy than typical commercial flights. Try to sit in the very front seats for the most unique views. 

After landing, the lodge had set up a local cab driver to meet us to make the \~30 min drive to the [Drake Bay boat](https://www.drakebayboat.com/) pickup location. It was really interesting to see what the roads and homes were like during the drive. Had some time to kill before our boat pickup, so we walked over to a tiny delightful [coffee shop](https://maps.app.goo.gl/va2TWSEiv4oHNSfR6) while we waited. 

The [Drake Bay Boat Shuttle](https://www.drakebayboat.com/) starts at Sierpe, stops at Drake Bay and continues on to multiple drop-offs south along the coast of Osa. Flying from SJO to Drake Bay is the fastest way to get to the lodge, so that is what we opted to do. There are no docks -- the shuttle is a smallish speed boat with water landings only (you will get into the water 2ft+ deep). Wear tevas or other water-friendly shoes. Depending on the weather and waves, you may stay completely dry or you may get 100% soaked. Therefore, plan accordingly and only pack/wear dry bags and quick dry clothes if you want to make sure your stuff stays dry. Alternatively you can bring typical luggage and bring your own garbage bags or something else to cover them and try to keep them dry. But I'd just go with dry bags.

The boat ride was yet another fantastic part of our trip (a very enjoyable \~40 min ride). The speedboat is super fun and the views are fantastic. At first, I wasn't sure if I really wanted to spend so much of our vacation time on transportation, but for me, the unique modes of transit were so worth the experiences.

[Jaguar's Jungle Lodge](https://www.jungladeljaguar.com/) is the last stop on the boat and the staff was awaiting our arrival. The lodge is a unique combination of luxury/service but also down-to-earth efficiency with laid back vibes. First of all, it is truly remote. The lodge is on the ocean, and beyond the lodge is rainforest on all sides. The lodge has a restaurant that gives you 3 meals/day. The meals are just fine. Nothing terrible but also nothing great. I'd also consider the portion sizes middling. So, depending on what kind of cultural food background you have, it can feel like there isn't enough food. If you like to snack -- bring your own. There are no snacks to be had at the lodge and nowhere to buy any, either. If food is a priority for you, this lodge is not the right fit. I was there for the animals.

And this lodge delivers on wildlife! At breakfast, I'd enjoy my food and watch capuchins whacking coconuts against tree branches right in front of me. At night, a tapir would just nonchalantly wander through the lodge. Coati was regular. Toucans, hummingbirds, macaws, and so many other birds were always around. The animals were clearly not fed by humans but weren't scared of us, either. They really do a great job making sure everyone is respectful of the wildlife. This was my favorite aspect of the lodge. One day we actually watched HUMPBACK WHALES while just standing on the beach! They were shockingly close. It was magical.

The lodge has nice rooms, wifi, electricity and hot water, but no a/c (yes fans). But we had no problem with the heat as the ocean breeze kept things cool at night. The ocean breeze also kept bugs at bay in general; I was expecting lots of mosquitoes but it was minimal.

We did several tours booked via the lodge, including kayaking, horseback riding, bird watching, snorkeling, and an overnight camping trip in the rainforest. They were all great with great guides, but the highlights were the horseback riding and overnight in the jungle. The horseback riding tour description said it helps to have some riding experience, and it is true -- it is def not for newbies. I am no riding expert (I've never taken lessons or ridden regularly, just done many one-off leisure riding trips in various locations) and I feel like I barely managed it. But something about bushwhacking through the jungle on a horse (yes, our guide was literally machete-ing our way through the rainforest) was seriously special. And it really lets you take in the forest around you. Hiking is great, but I ended up focusing on maneuvering muddy trails far more than being able to observe and appreciate the forest. I thought the horseback riding would just be a fun novelty, but it ended up being my most memorable and special experience. We saw an anteater in the trees and jaguar paw prints in the mud.

The overnight in the jungle was no joke. We hiked 8 miles to the camp site, the majority of it up or down steep inclines/declines in serious mud. We crossed multiple streams, one of which required swimming to get across due to depth. There was no fresh water at the camp and we were't told to bring extra water, which I found kind of horrifying. I get nervous when the water bottle I always have by my side in the office gets low. But I guess that is the ""pura vida"" of it all! We weren't going to die of dehydration or something. We did this trip with one other couple and our guides. 

Altogether it was a life-changing trip for us and really pushed us beyond our comfort levels, which was what we wanted--and it was fantastic. The lodge is a really unique place and I hope it doesn't change!  If anyone has any Qs, I'm happy to answer them.",3,1764458273.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False

1pa2po4,https://www.reddit.com/r/murakami/comments/1pa2po4/the_city_and_its_uncertain_walls_review/,The City and Its Uncertain Walls Review,"I rarely make posts, but I decided to make one since I have not seen much discourse and posts about this book yet. For some background, last summer I got into Murakami and read Norwegian Wood, After Dark, Kafka on the Shore, 1Q84, and The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle back to back. My favorites being After Dark, Kafka, and 1Q84. However, last month I walked into a bookstore and found The City and Its Uncertain Walls, which I never heard of, but it makes sense considering the English translation came out not too long ago. 

Anyways, I recently finished this book, and wow! I must say I was skeptical since most comments and reviews say the book is boring and a DNF, but I am glad I listened to my gut and read it anyways. I think this is my favorite Murakami book so far! I did not find it boring at all; I was actually sad when it ended and felt like I needed more answers (like most of Murakami's books). I think if you have never been in love or felt the love and yearning that Murakami is describing in this book, then you will probably not like it. I have been in a 10+ year relationship, so I was able to put myself in the shoes of the narrator throughout the story. I kept imagining how I would feel and what I would do if the love of my life just vanished and I never got any closure. I was able to feel the yearn and sadness as I read this book, and I think it's because of my relationship. I would be mortified if my fiancé just left one day without a word. Would I do the same things as the narrator? Would I go to another world to be with her even if it wasn't the ""same"" her? I don't know, but it's a terrifying concept to think about. I think all of this emotion and thought provoking concepts is what made me love and connect with this book the most.  

One of many of my favorite quotes from this book: ""Once you've tasted pure, unadulterated love, it's like a part of your heart's been irradiated, burned out, in a sense. Particularly when that love, for whatever reason, is suddenly severed. For the person involved, that sort of love is both the supreme happiness and a curse."" 

For those who did read it, what did you think? I do wish we heard from the young girl at the end, but of course in Murakami fashion, we do not get resolved and happy endings. Do you think the coffee shop owner he was seeing at the end was also a shadow? I wish we learned more about her. I also wished we knew if he ended up with her after he made his final decision. Also, If the young girl and the Narrator made this world up, do you think anyone else could enter this world without the main character's help? For example, the boy in the parka jacket only got to go to this world due to the main character telling him about the world. I had more questions, but I unfortunately forgot to write them down. Overall, this was one of my favorite reads this year, and I urge anyone who is skeptical to read this book! It definitely feels like a more matured Murakami book. I am also glad there was not any awkward sex scenes. 

I also listened to these two piano playlist while reading, which I felt fit this book perfectly:

He had his shitty landlord to thank for that; because Harvey had ignored Nathan's complaints about drafts and inadequate heating, Nathan had taken it upon himself to tape over the edges of the apartment's two windows, the seams where the door met the doorframe, and to seal all of the vents. This alone kept the gas out. 

He didn't realize anything was wrong until halfway through his first cup of coffee. The sun had just started to come up and the light was strangely yellow, piss yellow, and cast the dingy apartment in a sickly pallor. The gas hung in the air, a low and heavy jaundiced cloud that lapped against the windows like seawater at a porthole. His cat, Winston, sat disconsolately on the sill twitching his tail. Nathan didn't know it, but he was the only living person for several blocks. 

The visits started that night. They were bolder in the darkness, and decidedly curious. They peered into buildings all across the city. They observed the peculiar patterns in which the humans had died, many of them entombed in cars and many more lying in bed. Nathan looked one right in the eyes as it goggled at him through the sliding glass door. Winston yowled, and the thing leapt away. 

There wasn't any grand final stand, no action movie theatrics. It wasn't even really a fight. Nathan, armed with a kitchen knife, did his best to menace the creatures as they entered the apartment. For Nathan, it was over almost as soon as it began; Winston did a bit better, landing a few deep bites that would become lethally infected in a week or so. 

The medical exploration was thorough. Every time they accidentally killed him, they simply rewound time around him until he was well and healthy again - confused, but undamaged. Nathan died in all of the ways that a man can die and then a few more, invented by his captors aboard their ship. He froze, drowned, burned, bled, boiled, choked, withered away, and had his flesh devoured by rapidly swelling tumors. Then came the reset, and they began again. He would remember none of it - to him, each experience was death for the very first time. His sole comfort was Winston, who managed to eke out a living as a stowaway and would visit him in the enclosure the creatures built for him. The enclosure was all wrong - it looked like his apartment but wasn't. The oranges he had on the counter back on earth were here, on this counter, but were made from wood. The refrigerator didn't work and had been stocked exclusively with rice. A faux-Winston was here too, but was too heavy and smelled strange and only ever stared at the walls and yowled menacingly.

I got angry and upset that he just seemed so cold faced but I said sorry after. He said he'd already processed it. I felt like I was getting fired by a HR manager.

  
Just the day before we agreed to go out this weekend and then go to the Christmas market. Apparently his friend told him it would be cruel to do that with me when he knew it wouldn't go anywhere. He invited me to meet his mum. He was the only friend I had in my new city. Now I feel so alone, and I never even knew there was a problem until he'd made up his mind.

It’s called beanlog, a lightweight web app for logging espresso shots.

Nothing fancy (yet), but it lets you track things like:

•	Grind size  
•	Dose  
•	Yield  
•	Brew time  
•	Notes (taste, texture, experiments)  
•	Bean info (roaster, roast date, origin)

I built it because I kept changing variables and forgetting what actually worked, especially when switching beans or dialing in a new roast.

Right now it’s very early and super minimal, but fully working:

I've been playing classical music since I was very young but all throughout my life I would hate listening to it. As I got a bit older (I'd say early secondary school age so around 12) I started thinking about music analytically and that allowed me to enjoy listening to it, but that pretty much sums up the 2 modes of music listening I have access to - either not really listening at all and my mind wandering, or focusing on minutiae at any given second (I suppose it feels similar to following written text with my finger/reading aloud to help focus on that). I've never been able to listen to and understand a piece of music on any greater scale than that, meaning that any musical forms beyond the simplest (verse/chorus, passacaglia etc) are just completely lost on me, and this also goes for when I'm playing.

Now, I'm someone who gets positive results from caffeine and I went to a recital having had a coffee for the first time a few weeks ago and it was incredible - I felt like I could listen to the music as music, rather than just as a soundscape to daydream to, or a string of little interactions. Thanks to this I know how it *should* feel. Now this affects my listening pleasure - whatever, it's a pain but I can deal with it - but it also affects the way I perceive pieces when I perform them, and seriously affects my ability to improvise/compose - after all what hope do I have of coming up with a coherent structure myself when my mind either wanders away from the structure of a piece I'm listening to or I forget what's come before?

1pa2mtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1pa2mtw/gallbladders_and_urinary_tract/,Gallbladders and urinary tract,"Hi everyone!

I had my gallbladder removed two years ago this coming March. Apparently I had the “trifecta” - stones polyps and sludge - and I went from being scheduled a month out after being seen in the ER to an emergency lap three days later. I was told it would be ambulatory, but I guess it was so bad when they grabbed the gallbladder to remove it, that it just basically crumbled apart inside my stomach so they kept me overnight to make sure they got everything. 

My question is this. Has anyone had any unexplained urethral pain post-op? We’re going on two years now and it’s not getting better. It feels like a UTI but backwards - the pain is there all the time and only stops when I pee. I was sent to urology eventually and all they can come up with is that it’s “stress related” and put me on *more* anxiety medication, which isn’t helping. I do drink a lot of coffee and take Adderall - and it seems like there’s more pain than usual when I take my meds and have my coffee, but it’s constant regardless. I’m constantly trying to flush water. 

Anyone have any ideas?? All I can come up with is that either a student nurse did my catheter and it went in bad and/or she didn’t deflate the balloon before removing, or I had a nurse I seriously ticked off who handled the catheter (I was finishing up field work at the hospital for my MSW when this happened). I never had this before having my gallbladder out, and it was pretty immediate pain following surgery. ",2,1764457790.0,gallbladders,1,1.0,False
