  I'm here looking for advice on what we should do. Please don't judge, we are trying to fix our issue but hit a bump in the road.

The last 5 years were rough, had a new baby right as things shut down for COVID. We racked up about $55k in credit card debt between my husband and I. We live pay check to pay check. We don't have any subscriptions besides like $20 a month in streaming with ads. We for months now don't pay extra for anything, no morning expensive coffee we barely even eat out except 1 time a week at McDonald's with coupons after my son's karate class.

Last August my credit cards were unaffordable, I signed up for a debt relief program. I cut up all cards and have been saving for what we want. I had 4 credit cards at 30k total when I sign up for debt relief. They were able to reduce payments, I got 2 out of my card negotiated by half. I got my 3rd offer & the chase doesn't want to negotiate the 10k and wants it paid in 6 months for $7,500 is left on it to pay. That would take my debt relief payments from 400 a month to $1600 a month. If we decline this it goes to court and we risk a lot. 

We both have zero credit cards to use, I have possibly found a loan but would put my car up as collateral. If we use our savings we lose everything we have saved and both cars need maintenance & I am on day 5 of me recovering from surgery. We could ask family members for a loan, but not sure if they could help us. 

My husband filed for his debt relief 2 months ago and cut up all his cards as well. We are at a point of, should we file for bankruptcy? We have a mortgage, we have lived in our home for 8.5 years. His car is paid off and mines paid off next September. This new debt offer is currently the issue & I'm not sure what we should do. We have until the 18th of May to decline or accept the offer. 

Please don't come at me, I already don't plan on getting credit cards after this as the last 8 months for me has shown we don't need them. I have learned my lesson, so please just advice on how to proceed. 

I run my own business and it's not always consistent, but it's enough for us. I work 6-7 days a week for months a time. Our child is homeschooled so we don't pay for child care. My husband has a full time job picking up overtime when they let him and doing Doordash to also help.

What is the best way to go?

You‚Äôll see entire comment threads about Dina's hair being dry or Ellie‚Äôs shirt looking too pristine in a post-apocalyptic scenario. It's just kind of exhausting, lmao.

There‚Äôs an interesting quote from Scorsese‚Äôs longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker, about choosing performance over continuity:

>The priority is absolutely on the best take for performance, and frankly I don't understand why people get so hung up on these issues... throughout our history of improvisational cutting, we have decided to go with the performance... as opposed to trying to make sure the coffee cup is in the right place.

>I remember that when I was nominated for an Academy Award for¬†*GoodFellas*¬†and we lost to¬†*Dances with Wolves*¬†for editing, the editor of that movie said to me: ‚ÄúWhy did you make that bad continuity cut?‚Äù And I said ‚ÄúWhich cut? Which continuity error? We have tons of them.‚Äù He was talking about a scene with Paul Sorvino and another actor who was an amateur, but wonderful, though he didn‚Äôt know about matching. It was much more important for us to get this beautiful performance by this untrained actor than to worry about where the cigar is in Paul Sorvino‚Äôs hand.¬†[(Source)](https://www.filmcomment.com/blog/interview-thelma-schoonmaker/#:~:text=The%20priority%20is,the%20right%20place).

I think it's a striking contrast ‚Äî to hear that from an accomplished editor at the highest level of filmmaking, and then watch the baseline of media literacy in internet discussions settle on nitpicking props or timestamps.

And yes, I get that this is an adaptation from a beloved game, but damn ‚Äî the game still exists. It's not the worst thing in the world for the show to take risks and hell, even be outright terrible, especially when the alternative is that folks can already play what people often call the gaming equivalent of prestige TV.

A sizable part of this fandom has latched onto loving their expectations more than the uncomfortable, fascinating places the story is willing to go, and that, in my opinion, has just kind of poisoned the well. I‚Äôm not even saying that as someone who agrees with most of the creative choices in the show ‚Äî I actually dislike quite a few ‚Äî but man, season 2 feels like a real watershed moment in realizing just how awful the fan conversation around this franchise has gotten.",4,1746555043.0,thelastofus,2,0.83,False

It‚Äôs an epic bikepacking pilgrimage that I‚Äôd dreamt of since my very first transamerican journey 10 years prior.
 
Technically speaking, it‚Äôs easiest to push a little further east through San Salvador de Jujuy and Salta, the provincial capital. Highways there are paved and with far less extreme elevation gains.

‚ÄúRipios,‚Äù a rough translation for washboards and rubble, had become a dirty word passed between touring cyclists and moto-travelers. It foreshadowed more than bad roads.

We had to switch her to cold brew a while back because of GERDS, and it's made a marked improvement there. We could theoretically cold brew Bones flavored coffees, but they use oils to coat the beans and any time I can keep an oil out of her system, I think the better.

Recently, I had some leftover whole spices like star anise, cloves and all spice, so I threw those into the cold brew of normal coffee to see if it gave her any shot of flavor. It did, and she loved it.

Investor Relations Bulletin

*ARC Nemeria Hangers Operational ‚Äì A New Pinnacle for Precision & Performance*

Release Code: ODD/INV/ARC-NEM-001

Location: Mountain Ridge Sector, Nemeria IV-B

Issued By: Callum Frost, VP ‚Äì Archimedean Starworks

¬†

The Outpost Development Division is proud to announce the completion and operational deployment of a new forward base for Archimedean Racing Concepts (ARC) on Nemeria IV-B. This facility marks a deliberate expansion into the mid-core system corridor, positioned to better support interstellar racing teams operating beyond the Archimedes system.

Perched atop a granite ridgeline and facing the glimmering expanse of the Cerulean Gulf, this installation was designed not merely to house ARC operations‚Äîbut to inspire them.

¬†

FACILITY OVERVIEW:

‚Ä¢ Site Codename: ‚ÄúSkyline Apex‚Äù

‚Ä¢ Location: Lunar Highland Sector ‚Äì Nemeria IV-B (coordinates redacted)

‚Ä¢ Altitude: 500 meters above local sea level

‚Ä¢ Primary Function: ARC refit and recharge station; performance optimization bay

‚Ä¢ Total Landing Pads: 4 (reinforced for high-output thruster bursts)

‚Ä¢ Docking Amenities: Atmospheric filtration bays, rapid-fuel gantries, grav-lift catwalks

‚Ä¢ Hangar Support:

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\- 3x ARC-certified retrofitting cradles

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\- 2x ship mass redistribution rings

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ\- Full-spectrum scanner calibration vaults

‚Ä¢ Crew Quarters: Integrated rest suites, stim-recovery zones, and a gourmet galley (we gave them coffee this time‚Äîno Terrabrew incidents forecasted)

‚Ä¢ View: Unspeakably good

¬†

STRATEGIC IMPACT:

‚Ä¢ Proximity to Core Circuits: With race loops trending closer to settled core space, this location allows ARC teams to optimize route timing and reduce orbital drift downtime.

‚Ä¢ Engineering Uplift: Hangars include provisions for high-stress composite testing, ideal for experimental ARC frame variants.

‚Ä¢ Logistical Advantage: Short-hop transit to both Porrima and Cheyenne sectors makes this an ideal ARC pit stop and relay.

¬†

NOTABLE NOTES FROM ARC PILOTS:

‚ÄúI refueled, recalibrated, took a nap, and beat my Saturn skim record. Place slaps.‚Äù ‚Äì u/VoidSnap

‚ÄúWhoever designed this needs a medal or a drink. Or both.‚Äù ‚Äì RetroBurnBabe

‚ÄúCrisp air. Fast launches. I left a sticker in the bathroom.‚Äù ‚Äì NeonChunks

¬†

INVESTOR OUTLOOK:

Early telemetry from the site shows a 43% increase in turnaround efficiency compared to Archimedes II installations. Repeat visit projections from ARC field teams indicate near-constant occupancy during peak race cycles.

Ongoing upgrades are under review, including a high-G launch chute and microgravity drift simulation ring.

¬†

CONCLUSION:

With Skyline Apex, ARC now has a launchpad not just for racers, but for the future of competitive voidflight. AMSW continues to build forward, boldly, and at the edge‚Äîwhere stars bend and engines scream.

¬†

For investor inquiries or a tour of the site, please coordinate through Jasmine Savage, Director of Inter-Departmental Operations.

Prompt for LLM:

You are an interactive business strategy mentor guiding me through filling out a detailed business profile template. Your role is to ask me thoughtful, step-by-step questions to help me complete each field in the template below. I may not know the answers immediately, so for each field, provide context, examples, and guiding questions to help me think through my responses. Do not fill in the answers for me‚Äîyour job is to prompt me with questions that spark reflection and clarity.

Here‚Äôs the business profile template I need to fill out:

{PASTE JSON SCHEMA HERE}

### Instructions for the LLM:

1. Go field by field: Start with the first field (business_name) and work through each section of the template in order. Do not skip ahead unless I explicitly ask to.
2. Provide context and examples: For each field, explain what it means in simple terms and give an example to help me understand. For instance, if the field is ""brand_voice,"" explain that it‚Äôs the tone and personality of the business (e.g., ""friendly and casual like a local coffee shop"" or ""professional and authoritative like a law firm"").
3. Ask guiding questions: Pose 2‚Äì3 open-ended questions to help me think through my answer. For example, for ""target_audience.demographics,"" ask questions like: ""Who is your ideal customer in terms of age, gender, location, or occupation? Are you targeting young professionals in urban areas or retirees in suburban neighborhoods?""
4. Encourage reflection: If I give a vague or incomplete answer, ask follow-up questions to dig deeper. For example, if I say my target audience is ""everyone,"" ask: ""Can you narrow that down? What specific group is most likely to need your product or service?""
5. Confirm understanding: After I provide an answer for a field, summarize my response and ask if I‚Äôd like to adjust it before moving to the next field.
6. Keep it actionable and supportive: Avoid jargon or overly complex explanations. Make sure your tone is encouraging and focused on helping me build a clear picture of my business.
7. Handle arrays thoughtfully: For fields that are arrays (e.g., products_offers, competitor_overview), guide me to provide at least 1‚Äì2 entries, but allow me to add more if I want. For example, for competitor_overview, help me identify one competitor first, then ask if I‚Äôd like to add another.
8. Pause after each section: After completing a major section (e.g., branding or target_audience), pause and ask if I‚Äôd like to take a break or continue.

### Start the Process:

Begin with the first field, business_name. Do not summarize the entire template or process upfront‚Äîjust start asking questions for the first field and guide me through the process step by step.",1,1746554549.0,ChatGPTPro,0,1.0,False

1kgb7rl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kgb7rl,"Cycling Alaska to Patagonia: North Argentine Wine Country, Valles Calchaqu√≠es y la Ruta 40","Argentina‚Äôs Ruta 40 is one of the longest roads in the world, starting at its northernmost border with Bolivia and ending more than 3,000 miles later on the southern fringes of Patagonia. It‚Äôs an epic bikepacking pilgrimage that I‚Äôd dreamt of since my very first transamerican journey 10 years prior.
 
Technically speaking, it‚Äôs easiest to push a little further east through San Salvador de Jujuy and Salta, the provincial capital. Highways there are paved and with far less extreme elevation gains. But I opted for the adjacent valleys of Calchaqu√≠ instead. More gravel backroads. More quiet nights in the tent. Spirit nearing extinction. Hands dyed white by the chalky desert dust.
 
‚ÄúRipios,‚Äù a rough translation for washboards and rubble, had become a dirty word passed between touring cyclists and moto-travelers. It foreshadowed more than bad roads. It meant heartbreak ahead. Either rough rocky shrapnel or coarse sand that was too deep to ride in. Los ripios were a plague that we couldn‚Äôt avoid, asking each other how long it lasted and where the worst parts were.
 
I stocked up on bread, water and kiwis in Susques before setting out over Abra del Acay, Ruta 40‚Äôs highest mountain pass at +16,000 ft [4,895 m]. At last came the weep-worthy descent I‚Äôd waited months for, tracking sandy red washes into north Argentine wine country. I camped behind an abandoned hot spring for protection from the wind. Then a semi-collapsed stone shepherd‚Äôs hut with access to river water, treasuring each last drop of morning camp coffee with bitter slices of grapefruit. Cactus needles finally got the best of my back tire, but I welcomed the desert heat and its promise of the color green.
 
My first glimpse of paradise was the colonial village of Cachi, cobblestone streets lined with willowy trees. I‚Äôd forgotten what the shade felt like. More bumbling jeep tracks in a Mars-like desert. More tired excavations for wild camp spots. More dry valleys of red wine country.",3,1746554539.0,bicycling,0,1.0,False
1kgb70k,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1kgb70k/the_beginnings_of_a_book_me_and_gpt_are_working_on/,The beginnings of a book me and gpt are working on,"Brother Eli woke at three, as usual‚Äîno alarm, no ceremony. He reached out from bed and clicked on the lamp with a quiet tug of the pullchain, the bulb warming the stone room with a soft, amber light. The walls‚Äîold mountain stone, hand-set centuries ago‚Äîheld the night‚Äôs chill like memory. He swung his feet to the floor, the cold rising up through the soles, familiar. The kitchen wasn‚Äôt far; nothing in the monastery ever was. He brewed coffee in the French press, slow and silent, and carried the mug to his desk‚Äîa heavy oak thing smoothed by decades of elbows and ink stains. The laptop flickered on. No frills. Just a matte-black shell and a clean connection through the monastery‚Äôs LEO satlink. Out here, the internet wasn‚Äôt for scrolling. It was how they found people who needed to be found. Hospice requests. Runaways. A deacon in Utica who hadn‚Äôt prayed in six months. Eli read them all, sipping slowly, eyes steady.

Breakfast, if it could be called that, was a single kosher sausage wrapped in wax paper‚Äîroom temp, no plate. Eli took slow bites between sips of coffee, the spice waking him just enough to stay ahead of his age. The monastery didn‚Äôt run on schedules so much as instincts, and his always told him: eat now, work later. Right on cue, Brother Dog padded in from the hall, claws clicking gently against stone. A Saint Bernard‚ÄìBernese mix the size of a small bear, with eyes like he knew how the world would end but wasn‚Äôt in a rush to get there. He sat down beside Eli without ceremony, leaned his heavy shoulder against the monk‚Äôs calf, and exhaled like the morning had already asked too much. Eli broke off the end of the sausage and held it out. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not savages,‚Äù he muttered, feeding the dog. ‚ÄúJust quiet.‚Äù

He finished his coffee in the quiet, reading one last line from an email he wouldn‚Äôt answer until after sunrise. Then he closed the laptop with the kind of care most people reserve for sacred texts. No rush. No sound but the soft click of plastic and the distant creak of wood shifting somewhere in the old walls. He reached down and rested a hand on Brother Dog‚Äôs massive head, fingers brushing through thick fur gone gray around the ears. The dog leaned into it just slightly, a rumble of contentment rising from deep in his chest. ‚ÄúStill with me, eh?‚Äù Eli asked, not expecting an answer. He stood, bones cracking politely, and crossed to the door. His boots were waiting‚Äîscuffed leather, simple and loyal. He stepped into them one foot at a time, no laces, just the familiar tug of habit fitting around him like the morning air.

Eli stepped into the hall, boots thudding soft against worn stone as the monastery stirred around him in its usual half-sleep. The air held that early-hour stillness, like the building itself was between breaths. As he passed the common room, he paused in the doorway, not out of curiosity but familiarity. Brother Turner had passed out on the couch again, limbs tangled like a puppet mid-collapse. The headset still clung to one ear, faint digital gunfire crackling from it. A controller lay balanced on his chest like a last rite, and his long red hair‚Äîfrizzed and escaping its tie‚Äîdraped down over the armrest like ivy. He snored, mouth open, one foot on the floor like it might ground him in some other life. Eli didn‚Äôt say a word. Just watched for a moment, eyes soft, then moved on.

By the time Eli passed the kitchen again, Carlos was already up‚Äîbarefoot, mumbling in Spanglish, opening cabinets like they might‚Äôve rearranged themselves overnight. He wore the same threadbare hoodie he always did before dawn, sleeves rolled up, hands moving through muscle memory: skillet, eggs, something with beans. The smell hadn‚Äôt hit yet, but it would. Carlos didn‚Äôt look over, didn‚Äôt need to. He just raised one hand in a half-wave without turning, and Eli answered it with a nod. No words exchanged. None needed. Just two men shaped by too many lives, sharing the same stretch of time before the rest of the world remembered how to want things.

Eli opened the heavy back door, the old iron latch giving way with a familiar clunk, and stepped out into the threshold between stone and soil. The air was cool and damp, touched by last night‚Äôs rain‚Äîhe could smell it in the moss, feel it in the soft give of the earth beneath his boots. Overhead, the great glass arc of the greenhouse caught the first light of morning, still jeweled with droplets that hadn‚Äôt yet burned off. They clung to the panes like prayers that hadn‚Äôt found mouths yet. The gardens below steamed faintly where warmth met wetness, rows of greens and root crops slowly waking with the sun. Eli paused, one hand resting on the doorframe, and just breathed.

Brother Dog barreled past a second later, all muscle and morning breath, nearly knocking Eli off balance as he shoved through the open door with the urgency of a creature who‚Äôd just remembered he had legs. Eli grunted, caught himself with a hand to the frame, and muttered something that might‚Äôve been a blessing or a curse. The dog didn‚Äôt notice‚Äîalready bounding toward the dew-wet grass like he meant to interrogate every goat on the property. His tail wagged in slow, deliberate arcs, a kind of flag announcing: *I‚Äôm here, I‚Äôm awake, and the world better be ready for it.* Eli shook his head, a small smile playing at the edge of his mouth. ‚ÄúGalut,‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got the soul of a barn door.‚Äù

Eli followed the worn footpath toward the stone archway that framed the greenhouse entrance, its keystone etched with moss and time. The garden on either side stretched in quiet profusion‚Äîuntamed, but not neglected. Tomatoes spilled out of their beds in tangled vines, heavy with fruit. Sage and thyme pushed into the gravel, stubborn and fragrant. Potatoes, fat with secrecy, nestled under mounded dirt like secrets waiting for the right hands. He passed lavender, marjoram, a rogue stalk of corn trying its luck, and too many greens to count. He used to name each one aloud on his morning walk, a kind of ritual inventory. Lately, he just let them speak for themselves. The plants didn‚Äôt mind. They knew he knew them.

As Eli stepped beneath the stone arch and into the gentle warmth of the greenhouse perimeter, the first thing he noticed was the silence. No goats. No soft bleats, no impatient hooves scratching at the gate near the entrance. The barn was empty, door ajar. The pen gate, still latched, but they‚Äôd slipped it before. He scanned the grounds slowly, eyes narrowing with the kind of tired amusement only herders and parents knew well. ‚ÄúWandered again,‚Äù he muttered. It wasn‚Äôt the first time. Wouldn‚Äôt be the last. The herd had a knack for pushing past boundaries‚Äîhalf-wild and wholly unrepentant. Somewhere out there, likely near the cave mouth or nibbling herbs they weren‚Äôt supposed to, they were already pretending they‚Äôd been there all along.

Brother Dog took off to the left, nose to the ground, tail swinging wide as a weathervane. He sniffed with the conviction of a bloodhound and the grace of a sack of laundry, tracking the goat trail with growing enthusiasm. Eli let him go, feet finding their way down the ancient stone walkway that cut through the heart of the grounds. The stones were uneven in places, edges softened by centuries of rain and soles. On either side stood the quiet buildings: the old forge, long cold but still smelling faintly of ash; the workshop, its tools hung in silent rows like monks waiting for a calling; and farther down, the garage‚Äîmore modern, but only barely. Inside sat the Volkswagen van, its blue paint sun-faded and patchy. The thing should‚Äôve died decades ago, but Carlos kept it purring like a contented cat. Some called it a miracle. Eli just called it maintenance and a little stubborn love.

Eli rounded the curve toward the old stone bridge, its arch rising low and moss-covered over the narrow creek that carved its way along the monastery‚Äôs edge. The water beneath it was shallow this time of year, moving slow and clear, murmuring over stones like it was half-remembering a hymn. The bridge marked the true boundary‚Äînot just of the grounds, but of something older. He‚Äôd felt it since the first time he crossed it as a boy: a hush that didn‚Äôt belong to weather or distance. As he approached, Brother Dog stopped dead ahead, tail lifting stiffly. Then a low whine, nose twitching toward the base of the bridge. One paw lifted, then another, claws scraping at the stone as he leaned forward, head tilted. Eli‚Äôs heart didn‚Äôt race‚Äîbut it did settle. The dog only alerted like that for two reasons: newborn goat‚Ä¶ or stranger.

Eli stepped to the edge of the bridge, placing one hand on the cool, moss-slick stone. There was a spot near the southern lip where the wall dipped just enough to give a line of sight into the cave mouth below‚Äîa shadowed hollow at the creek‚Äôs bend, hidden unless you knew exactly where to look. He leaned over carefully, eyes adjusting to the dim. At first, it was just wet stone, a scatter of fallen leaves, the faint sheen of pooled rainwater. Then‚Äîmovement. A shape. Curled near the back of the hollow was a man. Large. Broad-shouldered. Soaked through and curled in on himself like a dog caught in a storm. He wasn‚Äôt shivering, but he looked like he should‚Äôve been. Eli didn‚Äôt call out. Didn‚Äôt move. Just watched, breath steady, letting the world tell him what it needed to.

Eli was already moving‚Äîacross the bridge, up the path, boots brushing dew from grass that hadn‚Äôt yet decided to dry. No panic, just purpose. He slipped back into the house through the side door, the quiet wrapping around him like a coat. The pack was right where it always waited‚Äîcanvas faded and soft, its cast iron pan riding snug at the base like an old truth. In the pantry, he moved quick but sure: a thick heel of yesterday‚Äôs bread, a generous strip of cured boar bacon wrapped in wax paper, a chunk of goat cheese, and a tin of loose tobacco. Last, he poured a thermos of coffee from the still-hot pot Carlos had left steaming on the stove. Lid tightened, pack shouldered, he gave the kitchen a glance‚Äîlike it might hold a question he hadn‚Äôt asked‚Äîthen turned and stepped out again, headed for the creek.

On the way back, Eli detoured toward the chicken coop, boots crunching soft against gravel and straw. The hens were already rustling, clucking low in their feathered huddle as he unlatched the door. He stepped inside without fuss, the birds parting around him like a tide. Three warm eggs disappeared into the side pocket of his pack, cushioned in a folded rag. He scattered a handful of grain across the ground with a practiced sweep of his hand, and the coop came alive with rustling wings and eager pecking. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs rent,‚Äù he muttered, pulling the door shut behind him with a soft clack. Then he turned, heading back toward the creek, the weight of food and iron steady on his shoulder.

By the time Eli reached the bridge again, his breath was just shy of even‚Äîdeep and slow, with that familiar pull at the ribs that age delivers like a quiet joke. He paused for a moment, hand resting on the stone, then stepped off the path and made his way down the bank. The slope was slick in places, washed clean by the rain, but he moved with the care of someone who knew which patches held and which would slide. Brother Dog watched from above, head tilted, tail still. Eli didn‚Äôt speak. Just shifted his weight low, boots angled sideways, and began the slow, deliberate descent toward the shadowed mouth of the cave. Each step was its own little negotiation with gravity, with time, with the quiet promise that whatever lay ahead‚Äîhe was coming with kindness in hand.

At the base of the slope, Eli stepped carefully onto the wet stone, eyes never leaving the figure curled against the wall. The man hadn‚Äôt moved‚Äîstill soaked, still breathing, still folded into himself like a wound. Eli crouched beside him, quiet as a closing door, and slipped the pack off his shoulder. From within, he pulled a wool blanket, rough and thick, smelling faintly of cedar and smoke. He draped it gently over the man‚Äôs shoulders, tucking it around him without intrusion. Then, with practiced ease, he cleared a small patch of stone nearby, laid down two dry sticks he always kept wrapped in oilcloth, and teased a fire to life with a twist of tinder and a whisper of breath. The flame caught quick and low, crackling into warmth. Not much‚Äîbut enough. Eli sat back on his heels and watched it grow, letting the silence hold.

Eli pulled the skillet from his pack and set it carefully over the fire, the iron warming with a slow, even heat. The bacon went in first‚Äîthick strips of cured boar crackling to life, scent curling upward like a promise. He filled the small tin pot he kept clipped to the pack with water from the creek‚Äîclear and cold, clean enough this high up to need no second thoughts‚Äîand set it at the edge of the fire to boil. The steam rose soft and steady, the smell of meat and woodsmoke beginning to wrap around the mouth of the cave like a blanket all its own. Eli didn‚Äôt rush. He cooked the way he prayed‚Äîslow, attentive, with both hands. The man still hadn‚Äôt moved, but Brother Dog had settled nearby, watching the fire with eyes half-closed. The silence was thicker now, but not heavy. Just waiting.

The man began to wake just as Eli cracked the eggs into the bacon grease, the hiss and pop of it rising like soft percussion against the morning quiet. Eli didn‚Äôt turn, didn‚Äôt speak‚Äîjust poured the boiling water into the press, the rich scent of coffee unfurling into the damp air. Behind him, a low groan, the shifting of heavy limbs against cold stone. The man moved slowly, like someone remembering his body in pieces‚Äîfirst the breath, then the hands, then the weight of being upright. The blanket had slipped partway down, clinging wet to his shoulders. He blinked blearily at the fire, eyes catching the steam, the food, the stranger crouched beside flame like some old mountain spirit. Eli didn‚Äôt look at him right away. Just swirled the coffee, watching the grounds settle. ‚ÄúMornin‚Äô,‚Äù he said, calm and warm. ‚ÄúFigured you might be hungry.‚Äù",0,1746554493.0,WritingWithAI,0,0.5,False

1kgb1q8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kgb1q8/my_30f_husbands_30m_relationship_with_my_mil/,My [30F] husband's [30M] relationship with my MIL makes me frustrated and I feel like the villain,"TLDR: my MIL is super fake nice. She has problems respecting boundaries, makes passive aggressive comments, and lies if it benefits her. Other family members have issues with her, and BIL and his wife are currently no contact with her. My husband is drinking the koolaid and thinks his mom is good at heart and is just forgetful and only lashes out if she is attacked first. He recently made a comment that insinuated his mother loves him more than I do and I just feel so lost.

Hi! Me [30F] and my husband [30M] were high school sweethearts and have been married for several years and now have a young baby. Pre-baby I would say we have a great relationship. We never yell or say nasty things to each other and are generally pretty good about communicating our feelings and listenting to one another. My mother in law has always existed and always been a problematic person, but since having a baby it has put extra stress into my own and my husband's life and also made his own mom much more involved.

To explain some of our family dynamic, I am a high income earner, so when I had my baby my husband took off from his job to be a stay at home dad. We both wanted this because we agreed we wanted to keep her out of daycare as long as possible and my husband was feeling burnt out from his government job. The reality is we are still ok with the dynamic but it has been hard on my husband. Being a woman I'm ultra empathetic to the struggles of being the stay at home parent I know it's exhausting, hard to get a break, and can feel lonely and isolating. In addition my husband has been having a health issue spring up that makes him feel unwell some days and its difficult to take care of our baby during these times. We are working on getting daycare arranged, but this isn't always so simple and takes time. His mom comes over to help semi regularly which is a great help to my husband.

To explain my mother in law. This women is the kind of person you would meet and either think she is super nice or think she seems really fake. She's always suuuper positive and sweet, but sometimes she goes mask off and can be really terrible, and other times just is passive aggressive. She's a people please in some ways, but also really dishonest. She just lies if she thinks it makes her look good or it will make people like her. And its not just me thinking or experiencing this. Brother in law and his wife are currently not on speaking terms with my MIL because she was not respectful of some boundaries they had with their kids and when she got push back she started getting really upset, which culminated in a screaming match between the SIL and MIL. Lots of lead up and drama for years between these people that preceded the no contact. My MIL's own brother and her have gotten into some intense fights because of some of her behavior. Of course she is always ""confused"" and doesn't understand why other family members are crazy and mean to her for no reason. She somehow doesn't even know why brother in law is not on speaking terms with her (they have communicated to her why and wrote her several e-mails). In addition to all of this she is financially very irresponsible. She's constantly in debt and spending tons of money on unnecessary things. I'm not talking like a $500 purchase for a fancy coffee maker, I'm talking like $10,000 on a home generator, or replacing all of her kitchen appliance that work perfectly fine. She makes a decent amount of money to keeps making payments on loans, but she also borrows frequently from family, many of whom are well off. We had drama when we went to purchase our house because we had a hard credit check which revealed a loan in my husbands name THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT. Yeah it was MIL who took it out and promises she will pay it off. She also loves being a ""generous"" person, but as you can see it feels really annoying whenever she wants to gift us expensive things we don't need when we have several thousands of dollars in loans that she took out in my husbands name and is still working on paying off.

She had a tenant that was a single mother that was rude to her over something, which escalated into more fighting because she couldn't handle that, and then tried evicting her because of it. She behaved very poorly and probably did some illegal things and had to borrow money from family to make an out of court settlement in the end.

I'm glossing over a decade of bullshit from this women, but so far she sounds terrible right? But she acts super nice and sweet to people all the time otherwise. And my husband just buys it. He acknowledges his mom has problems and that she isn't always nice (but its only when she feels like people aren't nice to her!... yeah explain that to the airport employeee she screamed at).

Since having the kid she hasn't done anything egregious, but its always little weird things here and there. She acts super respectful of thinsg we ask or boundaries we have, but then ""forgets"". Again an instance where I think its intentionally malicious, and my husband thinks no she really means well and is just forgetful. She has told us once, amidst a fight with her brother, that she only agreed to how to handle their late fathers possessions because it made her brother happy and she would just renegade on the deal if she changed her mind. So I think she 100% just agrees to whatever we say and then does what she wants. For example our baby started immitating a cough sound after one of us was sick. My mother in law thought it was cute and would keep imitating the cough at our baby. I've asked her three times now to stop because its confusing trying to figure out if my baby is sick or just making coughing sounds for fun. She makes weird comments too, like at a recent family gathering she commented how my daughter has my teeth. She has like 4 crooked teeth. My own teeth were crooked as a child but I've had braces and they are very normal now? It just felt like a weird dig at me poorly disguised as a compliment. My husband and I are at odds at this point over how much is intentional and how much is his sweet old mom being forgetful and socially awkward. Of course he doesn't like saying something to her, but normally will after I push him or argue with him why I don't care what the intention is, the action is what matters.

Recently we've talked about not always feeling loved by each other, since we've been more stressed and quick to fight since having the baby. I've taken some time off work to help him when he isn't feeling well, but a lot of times I have to go into work anyways, which he feels hurt by, but I don't have endless amounts of time I can take off. The baby also takes a lot of my time and attention when I am home from work to be honest. We are trying to make more concentrated efforts to spend time on each other during weekends and such. But he recently said something that has been rattling around in my head. On one of his hard days he asked his mom if she could help out. She had appointments scheduled with some clients and she said she could just cancel and piss them off. My husband told me afterwards ""maybe I just have high standards for what love looks like because my mom shows me such unconditional love""

I just feel so unsettled and I can't quite put my finger on it? I feel like my husband loves his mother, and while recognizing some of her faults, really gives her the benefit of the doubt. I feel like he's telling me he feels more loved by his mom than me? I feel like all of her faults and blunders are forgiven, but any of mine are problems to be worked on. I guess I'm posting in search of either validation or a reality check. Where do I go from here? I've been trying to complain less about his mom to him because I know he doesn't like to hear it, and I feel like a villain to be upset that he's happy his mom loves him so much??

1kgb1fp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestWirelessProducts/comments/1kgb1fp/does_soundcore_p30i_wireless_earbuds_deliver_on/,Does Soundcore P30i Wireless Earbuds Deliver on Noise Cancelling and Bass? Review Inside,"The **Soundcore A3959 P30i by Anker Noise Cancelling Earbuds** entered my life as a promising solution for all things audio. Whether it's my daily commute, intense gym workouts, or just unwinding at home, these wireless earphones seemed to offer more than just attractive looks. After using them consistently, I discovered features that genuinely impressed me, alongside some points that could use further refinement.

**Design and Build Quality**

Stylish and functional, the P30i earbuds immediately caught my eye with their sleek green finish. Their lightweight build (just 1.76 ounces) makes them comfortable during long listening sessions without causing ear fatigue. I appreciate the various ear tip sizes included in the box for a customized fit, as small tweaks like this significantly impact comfort during extended use, particularly when I wear them during workouts. The icing on the cake is the charging case, doubling as a phone stand, which I found perfect for binge-watching shows during flights or while lounging. The compact dimension of 4.25 x 4.25 x 1.42 inches slips easily into my pocket or gym bag.

**Strong Noise Cancelling**

Its active noise cancellation (ANC) performance is borderline wizardry. The Soundcore P30i can suppress up to 42dB of external noise, a feature that saved me from the chaos of subway commutes and coffee shop chatter. The adaptive technology is the real MVP, as it adjusts noise reduction levels to match environmental sounds automatically. For instance, when my surroundings got louder during a walk in the city, ANC kicked in with just enough punch to tune out the clutter without completely disconnecting me.

[Check Soundcore A3959 P30i price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0crtr3pmf/)

**Audio Performance**

It‚Äôs impossible not to mention what these earbuds achieve in terms of sound. Their dynamic drivers and BassUp technology genuinely deliver deep, thumping bass, making my music playlist feel alive. The frequency range between 20Hz and 20KHz ensures clarity across lows, mids, and highs. Watching movies is equally delightful, thanks to balanced soundscapes that enhance the viewing experience. My favorite feature, hands down, is the dual-mode that permits toggling between ANC and transparency modes. While ANC immerses me in my music, transparency mode ensures I don‚Äôt miss important announcements at train stations‚Äîa brilliant addition for us multitaskers!

**Battery Life and Charging**

Battery performance was another highlight. On paper, Soundcore promises up to 10 hours of playtime on a single charge (6 with ANC), and after testing, it felt pretty accurate. With the case included, you‚Äôre looking at an impressive 45 hours (dropping to 25 hours when using ANC). A quick charge feature gave me two extra hours after just 10 minutes‚Äîvery handy during my forgetful mornings! However, the charging time of ‚Äú1E+1 minutes‚Äù can be a bit confusing; perhaps simplifying their communication on this would help.

**Pluses**

- Lightweight and comfortable with customizable ear tips
- Adaptive 42dB noise cancellation for superior sound isolation
- Transparency mode for situational awareness
- Crisp bass and balanced audio for music, calls, and movies
- Impressive 45-hour total playtime with the case
- Multipurpose charging case that doubles as a phone stand
- Bluetooth 5.4 ensures seamless, fast connections

**Negatives**

- Slightly overwhelming bass for those preferring neutral audio profiles
- Battery metrics like ‚Äú1E+1‚Äù or ‚Äú1E+1 Hours‚Äù are confusing and unclear
- Touch controls are slightly too sensitive and can misfire when adjusting the fit
- Limited number of color options‚Äîgreen might not suit everyone‚Äôs taste

**Market Rivals**

Comparing the P30i to some of its peers like the Sony WF-1000XM5 and the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II, I did notice a few key differences. The Soundcore model wins in affordability and offers features like the dual-function charging case that its pricier rivals do not. However, Sony and Bose excel in noise cancellation with an even more nuanced performance, particularly for audiophiles demanding greater ANC depth. In terms of aesthetics, I found Soundcore's build sleeker and more casual-friendly, whereas Bose leans towards bulkier designs more suited for stationary use.

**Budget-Friendly**

In terms of value, these earbuds punch well above their weight. They might not be the absolute cr√®me de la cr√®me of in-ear headphones, but their feature-packed build ensures they‚Äôre worth every hard-earned penny for most users. Balancing price, functionality, and performance, it‚Äôs an excellent choice for casual listeners and semi-audiophiles, despite minor quirks.

I found myself in a crowded coffee shop today, lost in my thoughts, when something kinda beautiful happened. A song began to play that seemed to echo what was in my heart. It's hard to explain, but for a brief moment, it felt like everything slowed down, like life was just giving me a little nudge to pause and be present.

I looked around, and for the first time in a while, saw the simple joy and warmth of strangers laughing, sharing stories, or just sipping their drinks. It got me wondering, do we miss these tiny treasures just because we're too caught up in our own worlds?

Anyway, I just wanted to share this with someone out there... Maybe you've had a moment like this too? If not, I hope you stumble upon one soon. It's funny how life can surprise us with goodness when we least expect it.

I work a stressful job and am in a period of high stress but I‚Äôve never really had brain fog, more so for the length I‚Äôve had it. Been dealing with bouts of it for a month now. Not every day and I seem to think it may be stress induced because it seems to really subside on the weekends when I‚Äôm not overly stressed out. 

To properly describe it, I just don‚Äôt feel nearly as sharp as I usually do and it might take me a little longer to remember certain things and I‚Äôll find myself in a daze here and there. 

Some other things - I drink coffee everyday and tend to drink a little more on the weekends than I should but that‚Äôs also the time when I don‚Äôt feel as stressed. I don‚Äôt really touch alcohol during the week. I try to take a multivitamin and a Vitamin B12 supplement every day. My diet is pretty average (but hasn‚Äôt changed) and my exercise levels have gone down, still try to run 1-2 times per week. 

2 questions:

1. Has anyone experienced this?
2. Any tips / tricks to break out of it or help the brain fog? ",1,1746553990.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

1kgaxiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menieres/comments/1kgaxiq/results_after_gentamicin_injections/,Results after Gentamicin Injections?,"Like everyone else, I have my own story with this disease and was diagnosed 6 yrs ago after several months of monthly migraines although I didn't know they were migraines at the time.  Finally, after about 8 mos, the fullness and tinnitus started and I started an 8 hr long severe vertigo attack while sitting down in my chair to have coffee in the morning.  Wife took me to urgent care where the doc said you either have a brain tumor or Meniers.  The only thing that can help you right now is Valium.  However, he didn't have any or write script for any, so thanks for the additional 4 hrs of misery.  Went to ENT, had CT scan.  ENT called me and told there was a lesion on my brain and he thought this was causing the problem.  That sent the anxiety skyrocketing while I waited to see the neurosurgeon.  Had a second attack on Fathers day evening.  Another 8 hrs.  Wiped out for a few days after (as those that have these know).  Finally see neurosurgeon after the longest 3 weeks of my life and he says he thinks it's nothing.  Follow up scans confirm it's nothing.  At the time I was relieved, but I also didn't know what I was in for.  If that could have been benign, I'd take the tumor.  More tests and the ENT says Meniers.  On to low sodium, diuretics and meclizine on hand.  They never mentioned alcohol or caffeine.  Eventually they said to limit those to reduce severity of symptoms but no hard evidence they cause attacks.  You can get all kinds of answers with this disease.  I had decent periods of wellness, but also miserable periods.  Seem to be spring into early summer.  Allergies? I carry on for several years just riding the waves.  I do eventually try steroid injections and try them several times.  Do they work?  Can't really tell.  Still have veritigo but maybe a few major attacks per year, but plenty of symptoms.  I move on to the shunt.  Had 10 mos of feeling great after that, then it came crashing down after surgery.  Another major attack, but this time about 4 hrs.  Plenty of the other symptoms though.  My PCP was very helpful and suggested trying low dose valium.  2-5mg tablets per day.  It seems to help.  It definitely dampened the symptoms and helped me be functional when I would otherwise have to lay down.  But again, shoulder replacement triggered another major attack.  Got off the plane in Florida to visit friends and just as dinner started in a dimly lit, noisy restaurant, I started a major vertigo attack.  Spent a few hours in the restroom while they had dinner.  Was it due to flying?  ENT says no, probably not, but after surgeries it's probably because my body is really stressed and releasing cortisol.  So, finally I say let's try gentamicin.  It seems each step of the way, the ENT says this works about 70% of the time.  Every time I'm in the 30% group.  So, I had the first shot, felt very strange, but had mild attack a few weeks after.  I go back in for a second shot, which isn't unusual.  After about a month of floating around and feeling weird, my hearing gets better and I start to feel better.  The ENT says this is good news, it's working and the balance and vision issues should clear up.  They didn't (maybe due to the low dose valium?).  Got worse again a few months later.  Since those injections over 2 years ago, I had one period of ""normalness"" about 8 mos after the injections.  Then it went away.  That was after staring vestibular PT a month before.  Since then I've been pursuing more VT and other opinions.  I switched from Valium to low dose alprazolam and nothing has helped me feel better that it has.  Anywhere from .75 to 1.5 mg per day, but at times I can feel fairly decent.  It keeps me functional.  I know it also retards improvement from vestibular PT.  Therein lies the problem.  I can stop the benzo's altogether and hit the Vestibular PT hard for a while, but I won't be able to function.  I'd have to sell my business or retire which I'm not quite ready for.  I've tried acupuncture, chiropractor, yoga and am thinking about trying the John of Ohio Regimen.  I'm on my first month of antiviral Valycylor to see if that might help. Can't hurt to try, but has anyone else had a hard time recovering balance and vision after gentamicin?  This oscillopsia is absolutely maddening.  It fluctuates and the medication helps, but I'm only masking it.  I had high hopes when the ENT told me it should clear up and this looked promising.  Makes me wonder if I should have not had the gentamicin.  I could still possibly have attacks without it, but possibly with periods of wellness which I miss terribly.  I haven't had a bad vertigo attack since gentamicin ( a few mild ones that lasted less than a minute) but I also have this new set of problems. Non stop balance, fullness and vision problems.  Willing to try anything that may have worked for anyone that has similar issues after gentamicin injections.  I know this is long, but thanks for allowing the venting.  I know some people have it worse than I do, but this stuff is relentless.  ",1,1746553872.0,Menieres,0,1.0,False

My dad passed away about 9 years ago, I was young and my younger sibling was 12 when it happened. I heard from my younger sibling my mom would tell them dads death was harder on her then it was on us (her kids). 

It upset me then and it upsets me now, recently we talked about it and she dug her heels into earth, saying all her plans of the future with him disappeared when he died. I understand how hard that is, but I think saying it‚Äôs ‚Äòharder‚Äô for her implies that it was easier for us. I lost my dad, he wasn‚Äôt there when I graduated high school or college, he won‚Äôt be there for my wedding, and I‚Äôll never get to wake up at 6 am to go get coffee with him again. 

I don‚Äôt think my loss is harder than my mom‚Äôs, I simply think it‚Äôs just different. That we had to go through different things and had different experiences through the loss. And honestly the way she thinks it was harder for feels dismissive of everything my siblings and I have/had gone through. My dad‚Äôs gone, I‚Äôll never get him back and I miss him everyday. 

Am I missing something? Is there some secret about losing a husband that makes it harder than losing a father as a teenager? I‚Äôm not mad at her, I just wonder if I‚Äôm missing something because I think saying it‚Äôs harder or easier makes it almost a ‚Äòcompetition‚Äô of some kind.

I live in London, UK and would prefer that you live in the UK too, since if we form a connection, then I would like to meet up someday (and it would be easier to do so if you are in the same country). However if you live abroad, that's okay, so long as it isn't too far. I don't mind if you're cis or trans. 

  
I'll start off with some potential dealbreakers:

* Firstly I do not want kids, and I'm not planning in changing my mind about that. It is important to me to find a partner who also doesn't want kids. 
* I'm not particularly interested in anything sexual, as I consider myself to be demisexual. I would prefer a partner with a low sex drive since it's unlikely that I would want anything sexual (at least in the early stages of a relationship). 
* I'm monogamous. 
* I cannot stand cigarette or weed smell, so I'm not 420 or drug friendly. Drinking is okay however a non drinker would be ideal. I don't smoke, drink or do drugs myself.

  
I currently work in the hospitality sector. In my spare time I like going cycling, walking, travelling to new places. I am more of an outdoorsy person however I do like indoor activities like cooking and baking. Whilst I like travelling solo, it would be nice to find a partner to travel with.

I would like to have someone that I can talk to regularly, someone who I can have deep conversations with about most topics. 

My ideal date activity would be doing something like going for a coffee or a nice countryside walk. 

  
I have Discord for chatting which after a while of getting to know you on here, it would be nice to move there.

I've been on the lease, for four years with my old roommate, looking to sign a lease and split rent 50/50 with someone **June 1st** to fill a private room in my **2 bedroom, 2.5 bath** apartment. It's a great space that was completely renovated about 4 years ago, hence the plastic on the brand new carpet from the remodel (think modern kitchen, bathrooms, and living area!). The best part? **You'll have your own balcony** ‚Äì perfect for that morning coffee or evening unwind.

Living here means you're right in the middle of everything NoHo has to offer. You can easily walk to all the cool theaters, restaurants, cafes, and bars, plus getting around LA is simple with easy access to public transportation and freeways.

**Here‚Äôs the rundown on the practical stuff:**

* **The Room:** A private bedroom, private bathroom, with kitchen and living room access.
* **The Rent:** Your monthly share is **$1225**. That's 50% of the rent.
* **Sharing Costs:** Utilities, internet, and basic household supplies will be split 50/50.
* **Lease:** My landlord is looking for someone to sign onto the lease directly for the long term.
* **Sweet Amenities:**
   * Convenient **in-unit washer and dryer** (say goodbye to laundromats!)
   * Reliable **non-tandem garage parking** (a true luxury in LA!)

**About the Building and Keeping the Peace:**

Just a heads-up, my landlord keeps things pretty structured to make sure everyone enjoys a quiet and peaceful home. This means the building has a strict **no-pet, no-smoking/vaping/drug use policy**. We also need to be mindful of noise levels, especially keeping it down after 10 pm. It's all about creating a comfortable environment for everyone.

**A Little About Me and How We'd Live Together:**

I work from home and tend to be an early bird with a consistent routine (up around 6 am, in bed around 9 pm, 7 days a week). Looking for someone who values a **clean, quiet, and organized home**. On a tidiness scale of 1-5, I'd put myself around a 3 ‚Äì I like things neat and orderly. I'm a pretty quiet person myself, and while I'm tolerant of reasonable noise, I appreciate a generally calm living space. I rarely have guests over, and when I do, we keep things low-key. I cook most of my meals at home (big fan of the microwave for minimal mess!). I don't drink, but I'm totally comfortable with a roommate who occasionally enjoys legal alcohol.

**Who I'm Looking For:**

Looking for someone **respectful, communicative, and tidy**. Someone who values a calm and organized home and is looking for a stable, long-term living situation would be a great fit. I'm around 33 years old and would prefer a roommate around a similar age, though I'm open to any gender identity for the right person.

**Important: Let's Do a Vibe Check!**

Finding the right roommate is super important to me and my landlord. So, I'll be taking the time to vet potential roommates through messages and in-person meetings before anyone goes through the formal landlord application process (background check, income verification, etc.). It's all about making sure we're a good living match!

If you're a responsible, clean, and quiet individual who appreciates a thoughtful roommate and a fantastic location in North Hollywood, please **send me a Reddit chat or message**. Tell me a bit about yourself, your lifestyle, and what you're hoping to find in a roommate and a home, and then we can set up a video chat to vibe it out.

1kgavt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kgavt9/can_aquatru_carafe_water_purifier_deliver_pure/,"Can AquaTru Carafe water purifier deliver pure, alkaline water? Review reveals the truth!","The AquaTru Carafe Alkaline Mineral Boost model, designed as a countertop water purifier with a focus on PFAS removal and other contaminants, became a surprising upgrade to my daily hydration routine. You know those days when the water tastes odd? This unit truly changed that for me, and its compact design makes it practically perfect for small kitchens or office spaces like mine. That said, it‚Äôs not without its quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This water purifier hits the mark when it comes to aesthetics and functionality. The unit‚Äôs contemporary design fits seamlessly with my minimalistic kitchen decor. It‚Äôs made for countertop use and measures 11 x 16.25 x 20 inches, which, while not huge, certainly takes up some space. The included 64 oz. glass carafe eliminates the guilt of using plastic unnecessarily, which is a massive win for eco-conscious users. I found the control panel straightforward, offering clear filter and maintenance alerts. The unit, weighing in at 14.85 pounds, feels sturdy, though moving it around isn‚Äôt exactly a breeze. 

**Ease of Setup and Maintenance**  
Setting up this system was ridiculously simple. I've always been wary of appliances that require plumbing or complicated installations, so I was relieved to see this had no such demands. The filters practically snap into place, which eliminated any frustrations I usually have with maintenance-heavy devices. According to its specifications, the filters last between six months and two years, which adds to the low-maintenance appeal.

[Check AquaTru Carafe Alkaline price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0c36hfc5q/)

**Performance and Water Quality**  
The real star of the AquaTru Carafe Alkaline is its patented Ultra Reverse Osmosis filtration system. I tested it extensively, and the difference it made was night and day. Certified to remove a whopping 84 contaminants, the system takes its job seriously. PFAS, microplastics, heavy metals like lead and chromium, and even chlorine‚Äîall gone. The addition of healthy minerals for alkalinity is a feature I never knew I needed until now. My tea tastes better, my water feels crisper, and there‚Äôs an odd satisfaction that comes when I fill the carafe and pour a completely clear, pure glass of water.

**Pluses**  
- Certified to remove 84 contaminants, outperforming traditional pitcher filters.  
- Alkaline Mineral Boost filter improves taste and adds beneficial minerals.  
- Easy setup with no plumbing required.  
- Glass carafe offers a plastic-free alternative for pouring.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The unit‚Äôs size might pose a challenge for extremely small countertops.  
- It‚Äôs a bit heavy, which could deter users who plan to move it often.  
- Despite high performance, replacement filters can add up in cost over time.  

**Day-to-Day Usability**  
This is one of those devices that quietly weaves itself into the flow of your daily life. I never realized how much I drank water until I had this, because now, it‚Äôs actually enjoyable. From morning coffees to evening seltzers made with a squeeze of lemon, everything just tastes noticeably better. My coworker who visited recently admitted she‚Äôs planning to purchase one for her studio apartment.

**Product Comparisons**  
When comparing this to traditional pitcher-style filters or even some similar units from brands like Brita or Pur, the advantages of this water purifier become clearer. Pitcher filters tend to remove far fewer contaminants and often don‚Äôt address PFAS or microplastics. That said, Brita models are more compact and often cheaper. In contrast, AquaTru Carafe Alkaline offers premium filtration and a touch of elegance for those who prioritize higher water quality. For competition in the countertop range, Pur Countertop Water Filtration Systems are reasonably affordable but lack the reverse osmosis feature.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering the advanced filtration technology and features like the Alkaline Mineral Boost, I‚Äôd say this purifier makes a compelling case for the investment. It‚Äôs not the cheapest option, but the quality is undeniably there. The durable build, long-lasting filters, and enhanced water quality ensure that you‚Äôre getting a solid return in the long run. It becomes a particularly smart choice for people who consume a lot of water or live in areas plagued by questionable tap water quality.

Pain....  
  
Blinding, shrieking, unholy agony....  
  
Screaming....  
  
My Jade-Eyes screaming....  
  
Blood....  
  
Pain....  
  
Screaming.  
  
My Jade, weeping....  
  
With a gasp, I rear up, blinking into darkness.  
  
A nightmare....  
  
Just a nightmare....  
  
Beside me in the bed, my flame-haired mermaid, safe and sound, sleeps peacefully. Beyond her: Michael, his chest rising and falling in the steady rhythm of sleep.  
  
Everything is fine. Everything is perfectly normal.  
  
But I'm drenched in sweat, my heart hammers behind my ribs and my breathing snatches. The wound in my thigh throbs a slow, heated beat.  
  
And for the first time, the memory surfaces, how I took the wound.  
  
Corby, his gun trained on Charlotte. Michael, flinging himself bodily at the gunman in a desperate bid to prevent the shot. And looking for refuge, finding none, I seize her, shielding her with my body....  
  
Pain....  
  
Shrieking unbearable agony....  
  
..... And a fall into darkness....  
  
Christ!  
  
I check the time; it's hours after midnight; getting late enough almost to be early.  
  
I have no desire to sleep, to risk being dragged back into that nightmare.  
  
Coffee....  
  
Swinging out of bed, I snag a robe and pad downstairs to the kitchen. The renovations are all but complete now and the house is cosy and comfortable. A couple of weeks ago we moved out of the annex we first occupied, but I still haven't grown used to the feeling of 'home' here.  
  
Home....  
  
I understand why Charlotte so yearned for a home of her own. Dispossessed for most of her life, with nothing to call her own, this has been Michael's gift to her, the most precious thing he knew how to give to her. He has put heart and body and soul into it....  
  
.... Not to mention a thumping great mortgage....  
  
.... Which he can barely afford....  
  
But for myself too, it has become home. Divorced so many years ago now, from a marriage which I never understood at the time was so unsuccessful. Only when I met my Jade-Eyes, did I truly understand what it meant to be bonded with another.  
  
And I would do anything for her....  
  
Anything....  
  
In the kitchen, the homely activities of grinding beans, putting the coffeemaker on the hob, calm me....  
  
.... calm me enough that I begin to think clearly about the memory that has just re-emerged. Everyone... Michael... Richard... Beth... has told me how I was injured, that I placed myself in the path of the bullet intended for Charlotte, but it felt like a story or a news report; something that happened to a stranger. A tale from the tv or social media perhaps.  
  
This feels visceral...  
  
Real....  
  
And my stomach clenches at the memory of that searing moment before I lost consciousness.  
  
I squeeze my eyes tight closed, trying to exorcise the thought.  
  
Then the aroma of the coffee invades my nostrils and reality returns.  
  
I take a couple of large gulps of the brew I deliberately made abrasively strong, then, mug in hand, I head outside, inhaling sweet steam as I walk.  
  
The night is an iced hush; early Spring, with the air cold enough to steal my breath into curling clouds, and with the kiss of frost on the ground. But a golden wedge of moon casts over the lake far below, and the water is full of stars.  
  
And slowly, my heart and breathing slow, and I grow still inside.  
  
\*\*\*\*\*  
  
JAMES - LATER  
  
Richard joins me in the kitchen, peering over my work surface and hob, where onions and mince sizzle with the spices. ""What are we having?""  
  
""Chilli con Carne.""  
  
""Sounds good. Want some help?""  
  
""No, I'm fine. I enjoy cooking.""  
  
""I'll rephrase that. Do you mind if I join you? It's getting a little heated in there.""  
  
""Join me by all means."" I nod across to the bottle. ""Help yourself to a drink. Problem?""  
  
Richard examines the label, Hmmms, then pours himself a glass of wine. ""Um, not a problem exactly. But I think when Michael accepted my investment in his spa hotel, he thought I'd be a sleeping partner.""  
  
""And...?""  
  
""If you recall, I had the investment made in Elizabeth's name, and she definitely wants to have an input.""  
  
I pause from chopping chillies as the humour creeps over me.  
  
Of course, he's used to running everything himself....  
  
When I invested in Michael's business, I was a silent partner....  
  
But Beth wants to be involved....  
  
I chuckle, rubbing at the side of my nose, then immediately regret it....  
  
Ahhh... s\*\*t!  
  
Chillies....  
  
Quickly I wash hands, then pour a little oil on a paper towel. Eyes watering, I dab at my face, trying to rub away the chilli oil as Richard watches in silent amusement.  
  
Then, ""Sure you don't want any help?""  
  
""Yes, sure. I'm all but done.""  
  
Tipping beans and chillies into the pan with the meat and onions, I glug in tomato puree and the rest of the wine, then clap the lid on tight. ""That'll be ready in a couple of hours.""  
  
I grin. ""Let's see how Michael's bearing up under the strain, shall we?""  
  
\*\*\*\*\*  
  
Michael's eyes are glazing. Doubt in his voice, sitting over a table-top of rosters and timetables, ""We've never done anything like that before, Beth.""   
  
""And that's a reason for not doing it now?"" The normally placid Beth sounds almost strident.  
  
So, she's a sub, is she?  
  
Michael turns for support. ""What do you think, Charlotte?""  
  
The support isn't forthcoming. ""Sounds like a great idea to me."" Charlotte's eyes sparkle. ""The boxing I used to do gives you a really good workout. And at the end of it, you know a bit about how to look after yourself.""  
  
""But... Self-defence?"" Michael rakes through his hair. ""It doesn't sound like the kind of thing your friends would want to do, Beth.""  
  
Beth shrugs, unimpressed. ""You might be surprised. Most women would like to be able to at least have a shot at protecting themselves. But somehow, it's not always seen as something they should work at.""  
  
Outrage surges over Michael's face. ""That's because it's our job,"" he protests. ""That's what men are here for. To protect the women they care about.""  
  
""And if you're not around?"" Beth's look is pointed. ""At the risk of stating the obvious, it was a woman who got me out of trouble last time."" She rolls eyes to Charlotte.  
  
Michael holds up outspread hands. ""Okay, you win. Self-defence classes go on the roster. But I'll have to find some extra staff first. I've no one trained in anything like that....""  
  
Next to me, Richard stirs. ""Why not use Charlotte?"" His face is suspiciously straight. ""You'd be willing to help, Charlotte, wouldn't you?""  
  
Michael gives him a hard stare, but our mermaid returns one of her jade-eyed smiles. ""Of course I would. What are we talking about? A couple of hours a week to get it off the ground? And take it from there?""  
  
""Sounds about right,"" agrees Beth. ""That's settled then."" She turns back to Michael. ""So, if we fit it in here in the morning...."" With one long, immaculately painted nail, she taps at a spot on the timetables. ""...That would leave the later parts of the day for the clientele to lunch first, then have sauna and spa, massage and all the rest of it. And we'd get them in for the whole day instead of just half a day. All else being equal, that should bring in twice the money.""  
  
Michael chews a lip, nodding slowly. ""You've thought this through, I can see.""  
  
Richard claps a hand on his shoulder. ""You might remember that Elizabeth's original role in my company was as a trainee in Business Studies.""  
  
Not just a pretty face....  
  
Memo to self: never underestimate a woman just because she's attractive.

# Chapter 2: 

# Her Master's Wedding, Part 2, The Best Man's Speech

 JAMES  
  
I slam my pen down on the desk.  
  
Fuck!  
  
I'm educated, intelligent and usually articulate. I have no difficulties expressing my thoughts.  
  
So, how difficult can it be to write a five-minute Best Man's Speech?  
  
I rose early, wanting a little peace and quiet so I could get on with the most classic of a Best Man's duties. I'd assumed it would be easy and I would run the job off in twenty or thirty minutes.  
  
An hour later, the paper in front of me remains stubbornly blank.  
  
And my eyes ache.  
  
Surely I don't need another eye test?  
  
It goes with middle-age I suppose....  
  
There's no upside to getting older....  
  
I need coffee....  
  
Leaning back against the counter, sipping at my drink, my mind wanders, travelling back in time to my first marriage....  
  
No....  
  
My marriage....  
  
For this wedding, it's Michael who is marrying her.  
  
But it doesn't feel like that.  
  
It feels like my wedding too.  
  
And I'll get it right this time....  
  
This is my true marriage.  
  
Even though it will be Michael who says the words....  
  
Memories....  
  
My wife, Marlene, with her screeching complaints. Never happy. Always complaining there wasn't enough money, even though I was working as hard as I knew how.  
  
I never asked her to work. I wanted her to be a mother to our daughter.  
  
Where are you now, Georgie?  
  
I slip the wallet from my back pocket where I keep her photo. I'd like to have it on my desk, but I'm never sure if it would upset Charlotte.  
  
She looks out at me. Georgie. Seventeen years old. Beautiful. Becoming a woman. Holding up her exam certificate to show me. Beaming brightly because she'd made it to university.  
  
I was so proud of you....  
  
Am still proud of you...  
  
More memories....  
  
Only a few weeks later: Georgie has flown the nest to her university and the sick realisation settles on me that my marriage, such as it was, is over.  
  
Marlene, screaming for money.... Screaming for possession of everything. As though she'd earned it all.  
  
Marlene.... and the growing recognition that she had someone else....  
  
Was she seeing him before the divorce?  
  
Who cares...  
  
Bitch.  
  
Walking away from her: I gave her the house. The car. The f\*\*\*\*\*g lot. I simply wanted out. An end to it.  
  
And the final blow: as it dawned on me that Georgie would no longer talk to me, was refusing to see me....  
  
.... That my ex-wife had poisoned her against me. My little girl, the apple of my eye, would no longer acknowledge me as her father.  
  
Your mother lied to you, Georgie.  
  
I may not have been the perfect husband, but I never did the things Marlene said. And I didn't leave her without money. It's hardly my fault she had no control over her spending.  
  
I've not seen Georgie for years. And the last time I heard from her was when her university fees needed paying....  
  
Glumly, I stare into my mug, what-ifs and might-have-beens churning.  
  
I hear movement from above, then chuckle as the depression settling on me disperses. There's no problem with Charlotte's spending. I've never known anyone so careful with money, even now when she has plenty of it.  
  
Tighter than a duck's arse....  
  
Count your blessings....  
  
And these days, I have so many of them: my closest friend and the woman I love soon to be wed, in the marriage I engineered to ensure the future of our Triad. My work is interesting, fulfilling and earns me more money than I ever dreamed of in those earlier years married to the Wicked Witch of the East. And I have powerful friends....  
  
Richard....  
  
...  
  
How to make the best of that friendship?.  
  
Something hovers at the back of my mind, but the thoughts don't coalesce.  
  
Don't think about it....  
  
It'll come when the time's right....  
  
I knock back the last of the coffee.   
  
Time to get on with that speech.  
  
Tucking the photo safely back in my wallet, in much more cheerful mood, I return to my desk.  
  
Since my mind is a blank, I search the internet for inspiration, trying to find the right words.  
  
Quotes about marriage....  
  
"".... A happy marriage is the work of two people....""  
  
Not exactly appropriate....  
  
"".... A perfect marriage is just two imperfect people who refuse to give up on each other....""  
  
Nope... Not that either....  
  
And I chuckle at Wodehouse. ""And she's got brains enough for two, which is the exact quantity the girl who marries you will need.""  
  
But hardly appropriate either.   
  
Michael is nobody's fool....  
  
And then I find it.  
  
""The real act of marriage takes place in the heart...."" I keep reading. After a minute or so, I open the top drawer of my desk, taking out the small box I'm keeping in there....  
  
.... Just for the moment....  
  
Opening it, I look at the ring, turning it in my fingers, thinking of what it represents....  
  
To all of us....  
  
And now I know what I want to say.  
  
Smiling, I pick up my pen and start to write.  
  
\*\*\*\*\*  
  
""You look thoughtful.""  
  
Michael twists the wine glass between his fingers, not drinking, simply turning it around and around. ""Mmmm. Yes.""  
  
""Is there any more of that wine?""  
  
He reaches to a nearby shelf, takes a bottle, passes it across to me. As I pour myself a glass, ""Problem? Something you want to share?""  
  
""I think we should go visit Klempner.""  
  
I hover in mid-pour, meeting his eyes then, without saying anything, finish pouring. Seating myself in the armchair opposite, ""Why would you want to go see Klempner?""  
  
""Keep your friends close and your enemies closer?"" he muses.  
  
""Not that I disagree with that, but the man's a psychopath.""  
  
""Yes, but he's a complicated psychopath and he's not stupid.""  
  
""Is that the only reason you want to see him?""  
  
He swipes a hand through his hair, then scratches at his nose before, finally, gulping at his wine. I wait.  
  
""Well, in the first place,"" he begins, ""Klempner offered a kind of deal. He doesn't make any trouble for Charlotte on condition that she visits him.""  
  
""And you think it was a genuine offer?""  
  
""No. But... Who can tell? A visit would at least show good faith.""  
  
""I'm not comfortable with this, with him seeing her. I know you spoke with the man, but I didn't and....""  
  
""I know and that's why, for the first visit, I'd like to talk to him without Charlotte, but with you.""  
  
""Me? You want me to come? Why?""  
  
""Because Klempner was interested in us. You and I. In Charlotte's relationship with us. It's something to do with her mother's connection with Klempner and Conners. And...."" He shrugs. Sighs... ""... you're naturally more suspicious than I am. Less likely to see the er....""  
  
"".... The better angels of his nature?""   
  
He chuckles, flashing brows at me. ""Quite. We'll have two different views on the man. If Charlotte is going to visit him, I think you should weigh him up too. First.""  
  
""Alright. I'll come too.""  
  
\*\*\*\*\*  
  
Michael takes the driver's seat and fires up the engine. I move more slowly as I ease my stiff leg into position, pushing the seat back so as to stretch out as far as I can.  
  
Michael watches with no signs of impatience. ""Mind if I make a suggestion?""  
  
""Sure. What?""  
  
Reaching into the glove compartment, he rummages until he finds a small bottle, pushing it into my hand. ""Just in case, half an hour or so before we go in, take a couple of painkillers. We don't want that bastard to see you limping.""  
  
""Mmmm... Yes."" I slip the bottle in a pocket.  
  
Driving, Michael glances down at my outstretched leg, seems about to speak, then swallows his words and looks back onto the road.  
  
""What?""  
  
""Um, nothing.""  
  
""What? You were going to say something.""  
  
He looks to me, looks away, then back at me. ""When we get back tonight, would you like me to massage the leg? Loosen up the muscles a bit... Or... would that be weird?""  
  
I consider this. ""I'd say it's about an eight or nine out of ten on the weirdometer.""  
  
""Mmmm.... Yes."" He chews on a lip, then, ""Would you like me to show Charlotte how to do it?""  
  
""Excellent idea.""   
  


# Chapter 3: 

# Her Master's Wedding, Part 3, Klempner

KLEMPNER  
  
Sutcliffe pokes his head around the door. ""You have visitors, Mr Klempner.""   
  
I jolt to attention. ""Who? Is it her?""  
  
""No sir, it's two men. The blond one who came with her last time, and another one.""  
  
""Dark-haired? Looks a bad bastard?""  
  
""That sounds like him, yes, sir.""  
  
From outside my cell comes another voice, brusque; Hartland. ""Sutcliffe, get on with it. Larry, move yourself. We don't have all day.""  
  
Sutcliffe rolls eyes, offering me a look of mute apology, then, ""Yes, Mr Hartland. We're coming now.""  
  
In corridors of concrete and steel, sour with the stink of disinfectant and sweat, Sutcliff walks behind me, as per the rules. I speak in a low voice. ""You remember what I asked you to do?""  
  
""Yes, sir. Leave it with me.""  
  
\*\*\*\*\*  
  
MICHAEL  
  
Klempner ambles in as though he'd been invited to a tea party. His eyes pass over me, already seated, instead sliding across to James who stands, arms folded, lids hooded, silent.  
  
Klempner sits, the screen separating us. ""Only you two?"" he drawls. ""Where's Jenny?""  
  
""We came without her on this occasion,"" I say, then c\*\*k my head across. ""James wanted to weigh you up for himself.""  
  
""Is that right?"" He looks back at James, apparently considering. ""Does she know you're here?""  
  
""No.""  
  
He ignores me, addressing James. ""So, what do you want?""  
  
""I want to know why you want to see Charlotte. And why you imagine she would ever want to see you.""  
  
""The last time we met, you broke both my arms. Am I supposed to be pleased to see you?""  
  
""You were on the point of having someone I care about gang-raped. We'll call it even, shall we?"" James' chin lifts. ""And it's worth pointing out that, in fact, it wasn't me that broke your arms. It was Charlotte. And if the police hadn't turned up when they did, I might well have shot you with your own gun. I was tempted. That would have finished all our problems, wouldn't it.""  
  
Klempner looks down, rubs his nose, then back up again. ""That's why I'm on this side of the screen, and you're on that side. So... Why should I talk to you?""  
  
James sits back in his seat, folding the arms again. ""If you don't satisfy us, me and Michael, Charlotte won't be coming anywhere near you. A show of goodwill on your part would go a long way. A little humility wouldn't do any harm either.""  
  
Klempner sucks in his cheeks, considering that, then ""Okay, shoot. What is it you want?""  
  
""Why do you want to see her?""  
  
Klempner raises eyes, staring up at the ceiling, exhales, then aims a finger at me. ""The last time you were here, with her.... When she laughed, it reminded me of... happier times.""  
  
""You're not happy?""  
  
He huffs. ""They put me on suicide watch.""  
  
""Really? You're thinking of suicide?""  
  
Klempner gives a long look, then gestures around the miserable room. Unplastered brickwork, painted institutional green. Bars cut across windows. When the guard shifts his position, the sound of the slight movement echoes against hard walls and harder floors. ""What do you think?""  
  
""I think that you think far too much of your own skin to go down that path..."" Klempner's eyes narrow... ""... If you weren't here... If you were still living your previous life, from before you were captured, would you be happy?""  
  
Klempner shrugs. ""What's happy? I worked. I was wealthy. For all the good it did.""  
  
""If it didn't make you happy, why do it?"" James' voice is dry, but....  
  
He actually sounds interested....  
  
Klempner's reply is equally dry. ""It's better to cry in a limo than on a bicycle...."" His gaze travels the length of James' expensive suit.... "".... Don't you think?""  
  
James doesn't reply, instead pursing his lips. There's a set to his eyes...   
  
He leans forward on the counter, his face close to the screen, hands fisting. ""I want to know why the man who enslaved, abused, and came close to having Charlotte raped, wants to see her again. Why?""  
  
Klempner stills, silent.  
  
""Do you want to see her again?"" I ask. ""Or was what you said last time simply a spur of the moment thing? You didn't really mean it?""  
  
His eyes snap up. ""Yes. I want to see her again.""  
  
""Then... Why?"" insists James. ""If I don't get an answer that satisfies me, she's not coming.""  
  
Klempner gives him a slow look. ""It seems to me...."" he drawls, ""from what I saw of her, that if that one decides she wants to come, she'll ignore your opinion.""  
  
James stiffens, bolt upright, eyes slitted, lips pressed white.  
  
But Klempner continues. ""You see, Jenny's a lot like her mother. She takes after her. There's damn all of her father in there.""  
  
""She could be your daughter,"" I say.  
  
His voice is flat. ""She's Conners' daughter.""   
  
""You're sure of that?""  
  
""I'm sure.""  
  
""How?""  
  
But he doesn't reply, simply looking away.  
  
""What was she like? Her mother?""  
  
""Mitch? Ahhh...."" Klempner's eyes soften. He stares into some unreadable distance. ""She was charming and clever, spoilt and selfish. She told me she'd been the youngest in her family, and it showed. She wanted everything her own way. I don't think she'd ever been refused."" He coughs a laugh, bitter and raw. ""She learned better than that with me....""  
  
""I can imagine.""  
  
"".... And she was the most beautiful woman I ever saw....""  
  
""And you've seen a few."" James' face is set.  
  
""Oh yes. I'm a good judge of.... female flesh.""  
  
I interrupt. I know trouble brewing when I see it. ""How many have you enslaved?""  
  
Klempner's eyes droop. ""I have no idea. I never counted.""  
  
""No idea? Not even roughly?""  
  
""When I'm shipping a cargo,"" he snaps, ""I don't care what's on board. Just how much it costs and how much it makes.""  
  
He inhales, rubs the back of his neck, blows air. ""Why are you here, the pair of you? You didn't come to ask about my business practices. What is it you want from me? I want to see the girl. What do you want?""  
  
""We want to find her mother. Charlotte wants to find her mother. You robbed her of that when she was a baby. Perhaps you can make amends now.""  
  
Klempner pauses, seemingly thoughtful. ""I've not seen Mitch in over twenty years."" He speaks slowly. ""If I knew where to find her, I'd have done it, long ago.""  
  
""Where did you lose the trail?""  
  
He ponders again, lids lowered, then, ""Got a pen and paper?""  
  
Uncertain, I glance at the guard, but he nods permission, watching closely as James take his diary from a pocket, tears out a sheet and slides it under the screen with a pen.  
  
Klempner scribbles something down, slides it back. ""That's the address where she was living when she was with Conners and the baby.""  
  
James glances at it, then passes it to me. ""You're the City boy.""  
  
""You're not from around here then?"" Klempner seems genuinely interested.  
  
""Not originally, no.""  
  
I read the address. ""This part of the City was demolished. But it would have been the same parish as the church where the wedding certificate shows they were married. It's also quite close to Blessingmoors.""  
  
""Wedding certificate?"" Klempner sits bolt upright. ""You have that?"" Then he recovers himself.  
  
That rattled him....  
  
Why?  
  
James and I exchange a glance.  
  
He saw it too....  
  
I sit back in my chair, folding my hands onto the counter. ""Yes, we have that. And her birth certificate,"" I drawl.  
  
Klempner's eyes narrow, but he's regained his cool. Pursing his lips, he locks eyes with me, wearing I-can-outstare-a-cat expression.  
  
""Got anything to add?"" asks James.  
  
""Yes...."" Head tilted back, the white of his eyes showing all round, Klempner swings the stare onto James,   
  
Trying to intimidate...?  
  
.... Good luck with that...  
  
"".... For what it's worth, if you want to find Mitch, I think you're tackling it the wrong way.""  
  
""What does that mean?""  
  
""The other one, the Haswell woman. They're clearly related. Track it down from her end. I set Bech on it....""  
  
""Bech?""  
  
"".... Corby to you. Before he died, I told him to find out who she is, where her family hails from. But he didn't make much progress other than to learn her family name is Kimberley. You might do better.""  
  
""What do you know about Michelle's family?""  
  
""Not a thing. She never spoke of them.""  
  
""Then I suggest you leave Beth out of this....""  
  
Klempner sneers. ""I'm not interested in that one. She's too much of a sniveller. Some women are born to take orders. She's one of them. Haswell is welcome to her.""  
  
""But you are interested in Charlotte.""  
  
""I'm interested in Jennifer. And her mother. Mitch was mine.""   
  
I don't like the emphasis in his words. ""You know, from most men that would be a statement of love, or at least affection. From you, it smacks of ownership. But of course, that's what you did, isn't it? Own people. Enslave them. Before you were caught anyway.... How did Frank Conners die?""  
  
""Who wants to know?""  
  
""My fianc√©e.""  
  
His eyes drop to my hand, then to James. ""Nice rings. A good match to the ones she's wearing. You're planning on putting something legal on her?""  
  
""I'm marrying her in a few weeks, since you ask.""  
  
He grins, but there's no humour there. ""I'm sure that my lack of an invitation to the wedding was an oversight, not a deliberate insult.""  
  
""How did her father die?""  
  
""Look in the records.""  
  
""The records aren't there.""  
  
""Really? I suppose I have Bech to thank for that. So why do you think I'm going to give you a full confession?""  
  
""You've already confessed. We'd simply like to know the details. How did he die?""  
  
Klempner considers, nods. ""In the river. Off the side of the old bridge. I imagine if it was dredged there, something might turn up.""  
  
""Christ, you're a heartless bastard.""  
  
""I daresay you're right."" His eyes shift between me and James. ""You going to let her visit me then?""  
  
""We'll think about it,"" snaps James. Then to me, ""Anything else?""  
  
""I don't think so, unless...."" I turn to Klempner.... ""Anything you want to add?""  
  
""Not right now. But I'll hope to see you again, Michael. With Jennifer."" He nods across, apparently polite. ""James.""  
  
\*\*\*\*\*  
  
The car door bleeps and we get in. ""So, what do you make of that?"" I say, starting up the engine.  
  
James buckles up then tips his head back, staring heavenward. ""I think he's an appalling bastard. And every bit as dangerous to Charlotte as he was before. He's obsessive, egotistical and completely fixated on Michelle. And therefore, from that, on Charlotte.""  
  
""I agree, but you know, I think he genuinely loved the woman.""  
  
James blows out his cheeks, musing. ""And you believe that makes him any less dangerous?""  
  
""Not at all. His idea of love is ownership. Fortunately...."" We drive at a crawl through heavy gates which sweep closed behind us. "".... he's securely locked up, isn't he."" A second set of gates swings open to let us exit... ""Do we tell Charlotte we've seen him?""  
  
James hmmms. ""I don't think so. At least not yet. I think you and I need to digest what Klempner said. If Charlotte gets any ideas, she might just decide to take matters into her own hands.""  
  
""Yes, she might.""  
  
I drive. James, hands clasped, orbits one thumb around the other. ""Charlotte's had to think for herself most of her life,"" he says. ""And she's had someone trying to control her for most of that life. She's not used to having anyone else to rely on. She's not apt to give up her liberty easily.""  
  
""Even when it's you that's asking?""  
  
His lips pucker to a half-smile. ""Even when it's me.""  
  
\*\*\*\*\*  
  
KLEMPNER  
  
""Did you do it?""  
  
""Yes, Mr Klempner. Just as you asked.""  
  
""Perfect. I'll not forget this, Sutcliffe.""  
  
""Thank you, sir. Is there anything else?""  
  
""No, not right now.""  
  
He leaves, the door clanging shut behind him. The lock grinds as the key turns but the sound no longer bothers me.  
  
Two photos sit on my locker. One old. One new. I pick up the older one....

1kgav9w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kgav9w,"Cycling Alaska to Patagonia: North Argentine Wine Country, Valles Calchaqu√≠es y la Ruta 40","Argentina‚Äôs Ruta 40 is one of the longest roads in the world, starting at its northernmost border with Bolivia and ending more than 3,000 miles later on the southern fringes of Patagonia. It‚Äôs an epic bikepacking pilgrimage that I‚Äôd dreamt of since my very first transamerican journey 10 years prior.
 
Technically speaking, it‚Äôs easiest to push a little further east through San Salvador de Jujuy and Salta, the provincial capital. Highways there are paved and with far less extreme elevation gains. But I opted for the adjacent valleys of Calchaqu√≠ instead. More gravel backroads. More quiet nights in the tent. Spirit nearing extinction. Hands dyed white by the chalky desert dust.
 
‚ÄúRipios,‚Äù a rough translation for washboards and rubble, had become a dirty word passed between touring cyclists and moto-travelers. It foreshadowed more than bad roads. It meant heartbreak ahead. Either rough rocky shrapnel or coarse sand that was too deep to ride in. Los ripios were a plague that we couldn‚Äôt avoid, asking each other how long it lasted and where the worst parts were.
 
I stocked up on bread, water and kiwis in Susques before setting out over Abra del Acay, Ruta 40‚Äôs highest mountain pass at +16,000 ft [4,895 m]. At last came the weep-worthy descent I‚Äôd waited months for, tracking sandy red washes into north Argentine wine country. I camped behind an abandoned hot spring for protection from the wind. Then a semi-collapsed stone shepherd‚Äôs hut with access to river water, treasuring each last drop of morning camp coffee with bitter slices of grapefruit. Cactus needles finally got the best of my back tire, but I welcomed the desert heat and its promise of the color green.
 
My first glimpse of paradise was the colonial village of Cachi, cobblestone streets lined with willowy trees. I‚Äôd forgotten what the shade felt like. More bumbling jeep tracks in a Mars-like desert. More tired excavations for wild camp spots. More dry valleys of red wine country.",11,1746553722.0,bikepacking,0,1.0,False

1kgaupb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisdomteeth/comments/1kgaupb/my_experience/,My experience,"Wanted to share a positive experience because I, like most people obsessively doom scrolling Reddit, was incredibly nervous going into surgery. Day of I had my surgery at 8 am (I recommend this if your going under IV sedation because it‚Äôs way easier to fast). 

The actual procedure took 30 minutes tops, last thing I remember is joking with the surgeon and then waking up to gauze in my mouth and an ice pack on my face. I wasn‚Äôt in any pain when I woke up and obviously had 0 memory from the procedure. 

My dad drove me home, on the way we got smoothies, this was the ONLY really rough part because I tried to eat the smoothie before water (worst idea ever) I got light headed and nauseous for 20 minutes. 

By the time I was home I was fine. I took pain meds, carefully drank water, and opted for a protein shake instead of a sugary smoothie (great choice). I napped and rested a ton the first day. Only real pain was right at first cold ish water was giving me weird nerve pain in my lower incision (I got 2 uppers and 1 lower removed). But that ended after a few hours. I kept rotating gauze for a few hours but eventually the bleeding slowed a ton and after that it hasnt bled again since. 

First day I stuck to protein shakes, yogurt and I had really blended mashed potatoes for dinner. I think genuinely the reason I healed and felt ok quickly was because I forced myself to eat food that has nutrients (as opposed to just ice cream). Next day I woke up sore but nothing ibuprofen and Tylenol didn‚Äôt fix (I never touched my prescription pain meds‚Ä¶please don‚Äôt unless your dying in agony). My dr recommended 2 ibuprofen 2 Tylenol every 4 hours but everyone recommends differently, but it worked great for me. I stuck to mainly liquids with occasional soft foods for the first 4 days (yogurt, mashed avocado, ice cream, liquid soups/broths, mashed potatoes). Also for the first three days I laid down and slept constantly, this is essential if possible!

On day 4 I lost my mind and had Mac and cheese bc again I was losing it, was totally fine I just mainly swallowed it whole. 

It‚Äôs now a week post op and I have pretty much 0 pain, I never swelled at all because I iced religiously the first two days and then switched to heat (per dr orders) and that went great. This is my first day no pain meds at all and I finally got to have (iced) coffee again and I‚Äôm thinking about maybe even trying fries later. Biggest thing is making sure ur chewing in the front and/or swallowing whole. 

Anyways just wanted to share a positive story amongst all of the horror stories. Genuinely worst part was the car ride home and missing being able to eat normal food. ",1,1746553684.0,wisdomteeth,1,1.0,False

After months of building (and industrial quantities of coffee), I just cut the first **alpha** release of **pgflow** - a workflow orchestration engine that **runs entirely inside your Postgres/Supabase project**. No extra servers, vendor lock-in, or mysterious black-box dashboards.

## What is pgflow?

**pgflow lets you build and manage background jobs, ETL pipelines, and multi-step automations, with all state and logic inside your own database.**

- Postgres tables/functions store workflow state & history.
- Type-safe DSL in TypeScript ‚Üí compiles to SQL migrations.
- Lightweight Edge Worker (Node.js) polls for jobs, handles retries/backoff, respects concurrency.

## Why build it?

- Tired of stitching together `pg_cron`, `pg_net` and Edge Functions.
- Needed real retries & visibility (no more silent failures).
- Wanted type-safety between steps (banishing `any`!).
- Wanted autocomplete in my editor for everything (dependencies, input arguments).
- Didn‚Äôt want my data in an external orchestration SaaS - it belongs in my DB.

## Use cases

- üß† AI/LLM chains (scrape ‚Üí reason ‚Üí store).
- üì¨ Email, file processing, scheduled background work.
- üîÑ Data pipelines & ETL - all visible in your DB.

## Try it (requires Node 18+, Supabase and Deno)

```bash
npx pgflow@latest install
```

(Follow the [docs](https://pgflow.dev) to get started!)

Arlo‚Äôs POV  
  
‚ÄúDamnit, Atlas!  Let's go!  One f\*cking job man, one f\*cking job!‚Äù  I barge into Atlas‚Äô room to see him balls deep in some Omega fake blonde bimbo.  ‚ÄúSeriously dude?!‚Äù  
  
He glances back at me and simply smiles,  ‚ÄúShould‚Äôve knocked.‚Äù  He shrugs and continues his assault on the poor omega who is face down, a\*s up and should know she is about to be thrown out like trash.  
  
Atlas is the Alpha of our pack.  His parents handed over the title to him 2 years ago at the ripe age of 19.  They had wanted to wait until he found his Luna, but Atlas is a spoiled brat.  We have been friends, against his parents' wishes, might I add, since kindergarten.  My parents were the lowest omegas in the pack, yet somehow they gave birth to me, the strongest warrior in our pack.  Being as strong as I was and moving up the ranks quickly certainly saved me from the torment common to omegas, but even my status didn‚Äôt save my parents from that life.   Atlas fought for me to be his Beta and I will be forever thankful for that.  Ezra, the previous Beta‚Äôs son, was not happy to take a step down to Gamma, but we‚Äôve all seen this balance works best.  Luckily, the previous Gamma didn‚Äôt have any male heirs.  It‚Äôs not like Ezra could have fought me for the title anyways, hell, I could fight Atlas for the title of alpha and win, but I‚Äôm loyal to him and I know strength isn‚Äôt all it takes to be an Alpha.  
  
Because of our status, my parents raised me right.  They always warned me to not date and be with whoever and to save myself for my mate.  I was taught to put the needs of the pack before my own, which is another reason I wouldn‚Äôt challenge Atlas.  My parents believed that because they lived this way was the reason the Moon Goddess blessed them with me.  They waited for each other and led a simple, peaceful life.  They never wanted for more, they were never greedy, they never sought power.  My parents were my greatest rock in this world and I long for the day that I will have a love like theirs.  I will wait patiently for the Moon Goddess to bless me with a love so pure.  
  
I stand with my back against the wall and my leg propped up to the wall as the little omega runs out of the room with tears in her eyes.  Atlas follows shortly after buttoning up his shirt.  He smirks ‚ÄúReady to go!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúDo you have to DESTROY them every time you finish with them?  You are going to regret this all when you find your mate.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúArlo, you and this mate bullshit is getting old.  You realize that a mate is meant to be perfect FOR you, so my mate will accept who I am.  Hell, MY perfect mate will be joining me in my escapades.‚Äù  He chuckles as he runs his hand through his blonde hair.  He is a very attractive male and I do see why women throw themselves at him.  He‚Äôs 6 feet 5 inches, his hair is long enough on the top to part it in the middle or side for a more put together look, but also short enough that he can go with a shaggy look too.  His hair is darker at the roots and lighter at the ends where the sun has kissed it.  He‚Äôs got a shade of blue eyes that is close to an aquamarine gemstone and his skin is the color of honey.  I used to envy him, then he turned into the player he is now in high school and I never envied him again. If anything I pity him,  he‚Äôll be lucky if his mate doesn‚Äôt reject him.  
  
‚ÄúYour mate is what you need, not what you want,‚Äù I mutter as we make our way down to the bottom floor of the packhouse.  Atlas rolls his eyes.  We finally make it outside where Ezra is standing by the car looking annoyed.  
  
‚ÄúF\*ck what took you two so long?  Circle jerk?‚Äù  Ezra  snaps at us.  
  
‚ÄúWaiting on you now dumba\*s.  Bags loaded?‚Äù  Atlas snaps back at him.  
  
‚ÄúBags have been loaded.‚Äù  Ezra snaps back.  
  
‚ÄúAtlas, I swear to the Moon Goddess herself if you didn‚Äôt grab the booze.  You know, human alcohol doesn‚Äôt do sh\*t for us, and I need to loosen up.‚Äù  I question him  
  
‚ÄúWhat do you think the omega was there for?  I was thanking her for loading up a case for us.‚Äù  He grins widely and pops the trunk, revealing three boxes with 6 bottles each of our favorite liquor.  ‚ÄúLook at that!  A box for each of us!‚Äù  
  
I shake my head and get into the driver's seat.  ‚ÄúWhy the f\*ck do you get to drive?‚Äù  Ezra complains.  
  
‚ÄúWell, let's see, you drive 10 miles per hour under the speed limit and are terrified of other cars on the road, and socio over there only knows how to drive 50 over the speed limit and runs cars off the road.  I‚Äôm our safest option and I want to get there and back alive.  Well, at least not maimed.‚Äù  
  
He groans as he slides into the back seat of the black SUV.  ‚ÄúLas Vegas, here we come!‚Äù  This is going to be a long four hour drive.   
  
\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~  
  
We pull up to the MGM Grand right on the strip and the bell-hop takes our stuff, minus the liquor, up to the room.  We each grab a box and I throw the keys to the valet.  We skip check in and follow them straight up to our room.  Atlas turns to the bell hop and hands him a couple hundred dollar bills.  ‚ÄúYou make sure to get us checked in and bring the 3 keys right up.  Can you do that?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúY-Yes S-Sir!‚Äù  the little bell hop stammers.  Just as the very small guy turns to leave, Ezra gets a look on his face.  
  
‚ÄúHey, on second thought, why don‚Äôt you send them up with the most beautiful co-worker you have?‚Äù  The bell-hop flushes and simply nods as he makes his way out of the room.  
  
‚ÄúHoly f\*ck!  Dibs on the room with the bathtub in it!‚Äù  I shout as I look into the first bedroom. Ezra runs in.  
  
‚ÄúMan, that's not fair!  You won't even use it to lure girls in here!  Let one of us have it because we‚Äôll get more use out of it!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúF\*ck you man, I will get enough use out of it myself.  The law of dibs is our most sacred.‚Äù  He punches me in the arm and trudges away.  
  
Atlas certainly didn‚Äôt hold back any expense on the room.  This room, well, basically apartment, could easily sleep 20 or more people.  Which, I‚Äôm sure Atlas and Ezra both plan to try to fill it to capacity with unsuspecting women.  As I‚Äôm lost in thought, unpacking my bags and ready to relax, I hear a knock at the door. Ezra dashes to it as I make my way out into the main area.  The bell hop definitely did as Ezra asked and in walks a concierge with fake hair, fake t\*\*s, and well, just about everything is fake on her.  Totally Ezra‚Äôs type.  Ezra shows off by flipping the key cards to us the way magicians flick cards to people and begins chatting up the blonde.  She is in full flirt mode, twirling her curls on her finger and giggling at things that aren‚Äôt even funny.  Yuck.    
  
‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôm heading to the pool!‚Äù  I call out as I make my way toward the door with my shorts on and my floral Hawaiian shirt unbuttoned.   
  
‚ÄúOh!  I like your thinking!  All the women there are certainly going to be looking to party!‚Äù  Atlas walks out of the room he decided was his.  ‚ÄúDude, could you possibly look anymore like a tourist?!‚Äù  The concierge that is still flirting with Ezra giggles and has definitely changed her target after seeing Atlas.  Ezra looks pissed.  Atlas walks up to Ezra and throws his arm over his shoulder.  ‚ÄúTell me cutie, whats the chance you are going to be down on pool duty any time soon?  I wouldn‚Äôt mind looking at you a bit more.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo pool duty for me, but I get off in 30!‚Äù  She gushes.  
  
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be in a VIP cabana somewhere. Come find us.‚Äù  He winks and pulls Ezra out the door.  
  
Once we get down the hall a little more, Ezra finally complains, ‚ÄúMan, what the f\*ck Atlas?!  You are always swooping in like a f\*cking vulture and taking my women.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNot my fault you take too long to confirm the kill,‚Äù  Atlas shrugs, and I laugh.  Man, I‚Äôm so happy I‚Äôm not a part of this little game with them, this back and forth has been going on for years.  
  
The MGM Grand has quite a few pools but not all of them have VIP cabanas.  I find a nice waitress who is the least attractive woman I can find and she gets us into a cabana.  I didn‚Äôt want to put any other women on their checklist for this weekend. It doesn‚Äôt take long at all for the waitress to come get our drinks.  We all order mixed drinks to our liking and pull out our own bottles of liquor made just for our kind. We take swigs out of our drinks and top them off with our own stash.  
  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs more like it,‚Äù  Atlas says.  
  
‚ÄúYes it is!‚Äù  I throw back my drink.  
  
We are sitting in the cabana making jokes and talking about anything and everything except pack life and work.   Atlas and Ezra are enjoying the view of all the women surrounding us when the wind lets loose a gust and the most amazing scent hits me.  It smells like Starbucks, a mix of coffee, vanilla and caramel.  My eyes search frantically for where the smell is coming from when my sight lands on a gorgeous tall brunette.  She is walking up to the pool gates laughing with her set of friends.  Her eyes land on me for just a minute and I see they are the same shade as Atlas‚Äô, a gorgeous aquamarine.  Her dark full hair cascades down her back in thick ringlets that make her eyes pop and her sun-kissed skin is flawless.  She has to be at least 5 foot 10 inches, if not 6 foot tall, she towers over her friends.  Her body is certainly not lanky though as she has curves in all the right places.  
  
My wolf, Flint, is howling for joy in my head, Oh!  The Moon Goddess continues to bless us!  Mate!  Mate! Mate!  He‚Äôs chanting when we‚Äôre interrupted in our celebration by Atlas.  
  
‚ÄúMate!‚Äù  My head snaps to Atlas, who I see is staring at the same beautiful girl.  
  
‚ÄúWhat?  Who?!‚Äù  I ask, trying to hide the panic in my voice.  
  
He simply lifts his finger and points to the girl who is somehow also my mate.  F\*ck!  There is no chance for me now!  
  


# Invited

LUNA‚ÄôS POV  
  
‚ÄúLovegood!  Come on!‚Äù Isla hollers at me from the other room.  That stupid nickname.  My parents clearly didn‚Äôt think about that when they named me after that damned Harry Potter character.  While it frustrates me when people I don‚Äôt like use the nickname, it‚Äôs the only thing from my parents I have left.    
  
‚ÄúWhy do I have to go with you again?  I don‚Äôt remember ever having an inkling of a desire to go seek out wealthy dudes to swipe their wallets.‚Äù  I‚Äôve gone with her on these stupid ‚Äòmissions‚Äô, as she calls them, more than once.  However, I really can‚Äôt complain because I know that is how she pays the rent and that allows me to pursue my music without any need for money.  I‚Äôd never be able to afford the rent here on the tips I make busking or the small amount I make doing gigs at the smaller bars around here. So, I guess the least I can do is be her wingman.  
  
Today, we head to MGM Grand. She's been seeing one of the dudes on their staff, probably a couple of the ladies on their staff too, I chuckle to myself, and that‚Äôs how she gets the keycards to their exclusive pools.  She‚Äôs picked one today with the VIP tents, clearly she is looking for a bigger score than the lowly dudes she frequents, in order to not bring attention to herself.  Luckily, the only thing I ever have to do is giggle and flirt to get her to their room. I‚Äôm not about sleeping around with strangers, well, it‚Äôs not really my thing to sleep with anyone really.  It‚Äôs actually been one of the things that has held my music career back and has been blatantly stated to my face.  
  
She runs up to one of the bars outside the gate to grab us drinks before we make our way inside.  
  
‚ÄúTwo shots of tequila and two Starburst over rocks,‚Äù  she says in her most sultry voice to the bartender.  She eyes the fish bowl on the bar with the tips in it, but I know she won‚Äôt touch it.  She‚Äôs a modern day female Robinhood.  Take from the rich only.  Anyone who is staying at these hotels has money to blow, the bartenders are just trying to get by.  She grabs her drinks and all of a sudden screeches, ‚ÄúHazel!  Amelia!‚Äù  She runs into the arms of her friends that I hate the most.  I roll my eyes quickly and plaster on a fake smile.  
  
‚ÄúHey there ladies!  Are you here to party too?‚Äù  
  
Hazel looks at me in annoyance, she doesn‚Äôt like me either, but we play nice for Isla.  ‚ÄúHere to snag me a hot chunk of meat!‚Äù  She exclaims shamelessly.  
  
We walk into the gate and we‚Äôre all laughing and joking when Isla looks at me, ‚ÄúBullseye.‚Äù  I follow her eyes to a cabana at the far side of the pool.  In it sits a group of guys who are certainly loaded with money.  Two of the three catch my attention, one more so than the other. There is a surfer looking dude who has the typical attractiveness you‚Äôd find in a magazine with his hair meticulously styled to look unstyled, he catches my attention first.  The other guy though, I‚Äôm definitely drawn to him. I take in his muscular build and his very wavy dark hair, that is not quite curly, is cut low on the sides and tapered to 5-6 inches on the top.  From here, his eyes look like they are an extremely light amber but it‚Äôs hard to tell.  The other guy that is with them stands up and makes his way over to us.  
  
‚ÄúHey ladies, care to join us?‚Äù  He says, trying to sound confident.  
  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mind if we do,‚Äù Isla replies without hesitation.  
  
We follow the guy over to the cabana and I‚Äôm so drawn to the other two guys it's insane.  I usually come on these little outings with no intention whatsoever of actually being attracted to any of the guys that Isla sets her sights on but man, these two just have something about them and I want them both! Hazel and Amelia have no problem hiding their desperation and they quickly jump on their laps and my brow furrows a bit.  I quickly wipe the look off my face as the two guys continue to stare at me.  Are they staring at me because I looked like a psycho checking them out?  Oh God, what have I done? I internally panic.  Isla sits on the other guy's lap, which I honestly couldn‚Äôt even describe to you at this point, because my attention is on the other two.  
  
I sit on the ottoman that is in the middle of the cabana and then get up and frown, ugh, this is not why I came here.  I get up and all three of the guys stare at me as I push the ottoman into the sun, remove my sarong, and sprawl out on it, ahhh, much better.  The guy that came to get us finally speaks up as the other two sip on their drinks.  
  
‚ÄúSo ladies, what are your names?‚Äù  
  
Isla speaks for all of us,  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Isla, that‚Äôs Amelia,‚Äù She points to Amelia on the blond's lap, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Hazel,‚Äù she points to Hazel on the brunette's lap, ‚ÄúAnd that, our art piece for the day, is Luna!‚Äù  She says proudly as I soak up the sun.  All of the guys sipping on their drinks spit out their drinks into their cups and I shoot daggers their way with my eyes.  
  
‚ÄúDid you say ‚ÄòLuna‚Äô?‚Äù The guy under Isla questions.  
  
‚ÄúYea, yea, laugh it up.  My mom was young and obsessed with Harry Potter.‚Äù  I roll my eyes and he looks at me confused.  ‚ÄúYou know?  Luna Lovegood?‚Äù  This time the other dude laughs.  
  
The guy with the dark wavy hair speaks next, ‚ÄúI, for one, think she was one of the best characters.  She had a vision of reality that others didn‚Äôt have,‚Äù  I turn on my side and prop my head up with my arm and smile at him.  He seems lost in my eyes for a second, his are a super light amber, before remembering his manners, ‚ÄúOh, um, sorry, that‚Äôs Atlas‚Äù he points to the guy under Amelia, who is staring a hole through me and honestly making me a bit uncomfortable, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Ezra,"" he throws his finger to the guy under Isla, ""and I‚Äôm Arlo.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúUnique names yourselves.  Nice to meet you all.‚Äù I speak directly to Arlo.  
  
Ezra pipes up again and I‚Äôm worried their friend Atlas is mute, ‚ÄúSo what brings you all to Las Vegas?‚Äù  
  
This question is asked every time and I give the same answer every time, ‚ÄúAhhh, just visiting and to steal your hearts and your money.  Ya know?  The usual.‚Äù  Finally, Atlas laughs and his laugh is music to my ears.  
  
He finally speaks, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall are from here, not tourists.‚Äù  He says as if he knows this to be fact.  
  
‚ÄúUgh!  How did you know?‚Äù  Isla whines.  She takes great pride in her tourist get up that she makes us wear every time.  The sarong and the whole nine.  
  
‚ÄúI can read people well,‚Äù he confidently replies.  ‚ÄúSo what do you all do around here for work?  You work at the hotel?‚Äù  
  
Hazel is eager to cut into the conversation as she plays with Arlo‚Äôs hair.  That small gesture makes me want to rip her eyes out.  What has gotten into me?  ‚ÄúI work in a dental office, Amelia is finishing up her pre-law courses, Isla,‚Äù  she pauses, she knows her play but she won't out her I hope, ‚Äúis very, um, handy, the master of lots of odds and ends type of jobs, and Lovegood over there is a musician.‚Äù  She puts the word musician in air quotes and I want to slap her silly.  Stupid b\*tch.  Not only did she use the nickname I‚Äôve told her 100 times to NOT use, but she never takes my passion seriously.  
  
‚ÄúMust be successful and serious enough if she can afford to live here,‚Äù Arlo comes to my defense.  One thing I do know is that Isla has never told them she pays all of our bills.  Isla is basically my sugar momma. Well, I guess the guys she steals from are our sugar daddies, but still.  She spoils me, feeds me and comes to every single gig I have.  
  
‚ÄúA musician huh?  Anything we can come see?‚Äù  Atlas asks.  
  
‚ÄúUh, oh, nothing while you‚Äôre here probably. I‚Äôm assuming a weekend trip, huh?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWeekends should be your busiest time here,‚Äù he retorts.  
  
Just as I‚Äôm about to tell him I took the weekend off for a vacation, Isla speaks up, ‚ÄúOh, stop being shy!  She‚Äôs playing at Artifice tonight.  She‚Äôs the main show!‚Äù  She beams proudly and I now want to hit my friend in the face too. I simply glare at her.  
  
‚ÄúIsla!  They could be serial killers!‚Äù  Now Arlo laughs and his laugh is even more attractive than Atlas‚Äô.  ‚ÄúBesides, I‚Äôm sure they have better things to do than to come see my show that a whole whopping 100 people will be at.  That doesn‚Äôt exactly give him options of who to take home,‚Äù I deadpan and I see hurt flash across Arlo‚Äôs face.  
  
‚ÄúOuch, who said we haven‚Äôt found the options of who we want to take home?‚Äù Atlas quickly responds.  
  
‚ÄúWell, I guess you are pretty matched up there, but just know, I don‚Äôt go home with anyone.‚Äù  I look Atlas in the eyes, ‚ÄúEver.‚Äù I enunciate it to get my point across.  I‚Äôm probably the only 21 year old virgin in this city.  ‚ÄúWell, anyway, the show starts at 10 and it‚Äôs an hour long.  Come if you want, but I won‚Äôt expect you.‚Äù  I look at Isla, who is seething with anger, and quickly right my wrong, ‚ÄúThose three might be sad though.  It looks like you‚Äôve made a commitment to them.‚Äù  I shrug my shoulders and sprawl back out on the ottoman and close my eyes soaking up the sun as I listen to my friends chat up their prospective candidates for tonight's fun.",1,1746553402.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

It was a normal Thursday, saa kama saa nane hivi. Pick-up ni Kilimani, nikakam kwa salon pale, then this mrembo walks out. No makeup, afro tu simple, hoodie na jeans. But aki this girl had presence. Ilikuwa tu vibes.

She hops in, greets me like a decent human being, then asks kama naeza cheza music, Nikasema sawa, she connects her phone and boom Sauti Sol, Bensoul, Nviiri. I‚Äôm there acting like I‚Äôm just driving, but deep down, naskia hey, this one is different.

Then Nairobi weather ikaanza. Out of nowhere, mvua kali. Traffic ika freeze near Yaya, we‚Äôre stuck like 40 minutes. Tukaanza story tu. She‚Äôs a freelance designer, ana do logo na branding stuff. I told her my hustle life, vile napambana na wateja wa Uber wale wanakataa kulipa, wale wananiambia nicheze gospel only, etc.

By the time tunafika kwao Lavi, we‚Äôd already clicked. She tells me, I hope I get you again.But hakuacha number. Mimi nikabaki naskiza Short & Sweet nikitumaini fate itakuja through.

Guess what? Two weeks later, request inakam same name, same location. My heart iliskip ka beat. She enters the car and just says, You again? Nairobi is too small bana.

That ride ili turn into coffee pale Valley Arcade. Coffee ika turn into strolling Karura, na ile day tulishika hands kwa Ngong Hills hike, I knew this was real.

Now it‚Äôs been six months. Saa zingine hujiuliza, kwani God alinibless via Uber app? Huko kwa dashboard naona five stars, but bro, mimi nilipata bonus ya love.

Humid, crowded, with moisture running down acute angles like sweat. Naveen Chakraborty was driving his cab when a woman waved him down. He stopped. She got in.

‚ÄúWhere to?‚Äù

‚ÄúWherever,‚Äù she said‚Äîthen, as his eyebrows shot up and he sighed, ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúShe's had a rough couple of weeks. Didn't mean to take it out on you. Please take her to the Museum of Unnatural History.‚Äù

‚ÄúO‚Ä¶ K,‚Äù said Nav.

He was thinking about his daughter, who'd been acting strangely lately.

Outside, the clouds had gathered.

It looked like rain.

‚ÄúShe lost her first person point-of-view,‚Äù said the woman suddenly, voice breaking. ‚ÄúJust so you know. That's why she talks this way. It's not an affectation.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean you?‚Äù asked Nav.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said.

Weird, thought Nav, but he'd had far weirder‚Äîand more dangerous. He'd long ago stopped trying to understand strangers.

He tried too to ignore the woman's sniffles, tried not to care (just drive, he told himself), but when she started crying, his conscience prevented him from *just driving*. ‚ÄúAre you OK?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù she said.

He pulled over.

‚ÄúWant me to call someone?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. She doesn't have anyone,‚Äù the woman said, sobbing.

Nav watched her in the rearview, saw tears grow in the corners of her eyes and run down her cheeks.

He turned to look at her directly.

And as the tears fell and fell, Nav noticed the cab floor begin to moisten, then puddle-up. The woman continued sobbing. The water level reached his ankles. He tried the door‚Äîit wouldn't open. Passenger-side too. Water up to his knees now, and he was starting to panic. ‚ÄúHey, miss. *Lady!*‚Äù

‚ÄúLife has no purpose,‚Äù she cried.

He tried the window.

*Stuck.*

He tried *hitting* the window.

*Nothing.*

‚Äîrising past their waists‚Äîhalfway up to their chests.

‚ÄúStop crying. OK? There's meaning to life. It's never too late. Stop!‚Äù

People were gathering outside the cab.

Nav banged on the window.

(‚ÄúHelp!‚Äù)

But no one did.

The water was up to his neck. He was trying to breathe by turning his head sideways near the ceiling. The woman was fully submerged, drowning calmly. So this is how it ends, thought Nav, closing his eyes and picturing his daughter's beautiful face.

‚Äîas‚Äî***smash!***‚Äîsomething heavy fell on top of the cab, collapsing its roof and giving the teary saltwater a way to escape.

A fucking miracle!

He gasped for air, then crawled out of what was left of the cab, dragging the woman (still crying) out too. ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù he said, snapping his fingers in front of her face.

*Screams.*

But not the woman's.

And when he looked at the cab, he saw that the heavy object that had smashed into it was *a human body,* more-and-more of which were now dropping from the sky.

1kganpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/skincaredevices/comments/1kganpa/find_out_why_neutrogena_tinted_moisturizer_spf_20/,Find Out Why Neutrogena Tinted Moisturizer SPF 20 Review Is So Popular,"**A thorough review of Neutrogena 294554 Tinted Moisturizer SPF 20**

Testing out skincare products has always been a bit of a pastime for me, and I was genuinely curious to see how the Neutrogena 294554 Tinted Moisturizer SPF 20 would hold up in my daily routine. With its promise of being an all-in-one anti-aging tinted moisturizer that delivers sheer coverage while protecting skin with its SPF 20 sunscreen, it sounded like it could be a staple in my beauty bag. But let's delve into how it fared over several weeks of use.

**Lightweight Design and Usage Simplicity**

What grabs the attention immediately is how compact the tube feels in your hands. The 1-fluid-ounce size is perfect for tossing into a travel bag or makeup pouch without any fuss. It fits snugly in my palm, and the squeeze packaging ensures that I don‚Äôt unnecessarily waste any product. The nozzle dispenses just the right amount‚Äîuser-friendly and predictable. The unscented formula is a fantastic addition, especially for those with sensitive noses or skin.

**Blendable Sheer Coverage for Everyday Wear**

There‚Äôs definitely something satisfying about the texture of this tinted moisturizer. It spreads effortlessly with fingers and works even better when paired with a damp sponge. A few co-workers actually complemented my skin, mistaking those subtle, evened-out tones for my bare skin! Unlike the thick formulas that highlight every line and dry patch, this moisturizer glides smoothly, leaving behind a natural dewy finish. My cousin, who borrowed this during a weekend brunch, now swears she‚Äôs getting one for herself.

[Ready to buy Neutrogena 294554? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://agegene.com/link/b01bf6ux5e/)

**Retinol Blended with SPF Protection**

The inclusion of retinol‚Äîa revered ingredient in my skincare book‚Äîreally elevates its utility. Neutrogena took it a step further by mixing vitamins and antioxidants into the formula. After consistent evening use, along with a proper cleanser to remove the product, I noticed improvements in my skin‚Äôs smoothness. The titanium dioxide-based SPF 20 offers an added layer of security against harmful UVA/UVB damage, ensuring that a short walk to grab coffee during lunch doesn‚Äôt come with sunburn consequences.

**Key Benefits**

- Lightweight formula that spreads easily across skin.  
- Combines retinol with vitamins and antioxidants for anti-aging effects.  
- Broad-spectrum SPF 20 protection simplifies daily routine.  
- Provides a dewy, no-makeup glow perfect for casual settings.  

**Texture Issues: Not for Everyone**

Despite its many upsides, not every experience was positive. A friend of mine pointed out that on people with overtly oily skin types, it can settle into pores if not blended well. Personally, I could see a faint accumulation in the corners of my nose if hurriedly applied. I also read in other reviews (and experienced once myself) that it may lead to occasional breakouts depending on individual skin types.

**Areas of Concern**

- Users with oily complexions might need an additional mattifying primer.  
- Limited sheer coverage that doesn‚Äôt suffice for blemish-heavy skin days.  

**Competing Brands**

When weighing this tinted moisturizer against other products in the same category, two alternatives immediately come to my mind: IT Cosmetics CC+ Cream and BareMinerals Complexion Rescue. While the Neutrogena variant delivers reliable SPF 20 and sheer coverage, it doesn‚Äôt quite measure up to the fuller coverage the IT Cosmetics option offers. BareMinerals, on the other hand, matches Neutrogena in terms of lightweight consistency but tends to be pricier, making Neutrogena the more wallet-friendly option. However, for individuals prone to deep acne scarring or those needing longer-lasting coverage, these competitors may hold an edge.

**Financial Value Evaluation**

Lately, I‚Äôve been paying more attention to the balance of quality versus spending. After using the product almost daily for three weeks, it still feels like there‚Äôs plenty left in the tube. That‚Äôs a win for me, as similar moisturizers in the market often either run out too quickly or come with a hefty price tag attached. For the low-maintenance days when full-coverage makeup feels unnecessary, this delivers excellent bang for the buck!

Nav banged on the window.

(‚ÄúHelp!‚Äù)

But no one did.

The water was up to his neck. He was trying to breathe by turning his head sideways near the ceiling. The woman was fully submerged, drowning calmly. So this is how it ends, thought Nav, closing his eyes and picturing his daughter's beautiful face.

‚Äîas‚Äî***smash!***‚Äîsomething heavy fell on top of the cab, collapsing its roof and giving the teary saltwater a way to escape.

A fucking miracle!

He gasped for air, then crawled out of what was left of the cab, dragging the woman (still crying) out too. ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù he said, snapping his fingers in front of her face.

*Screams.*

But not the woman's.

And when he looked at the cab, he saw that the heavy object that had smashed into it was *a human body,* more-and-more of which were now dropping from the sky.

Splattering on the sidewalk, the street.

Crushing people.

*Panic.*

Nav pulled the woman to cover.

Over the course of a few weeks, I‚Äôve used it daily, tried all its features, and even gauged feedback from my coffee-loving coworkers. Truth be told, this single-serve coffee machine brings both convenience and quality to the table, with a bit of complexity sprinkled in for good measure. The Keurig K-2500 Single Serve Commercial Coffee Maker is undeniably designed for commercial spaces like offices and waiting rooms, where efficiency and volume are key. Let‚Äôs dig in deeper to explore its build, features, and performance.

**Design That Fits Into Modern Spaces**

The design of this coffee maker is sleek and minimalistic, sporting a robust black and stainless steel finish that naturally blends into any modern office. With dimensions of 8""D x 14.25""W x 13""H, it doesn't occupy excessive countertop space, which is a relief in our already crowded break room. I found the high-resolution color touchscreen impressive; it‚Äôs both functional and visually pleasing. The screensaver mode is a thoughtful touch, preventing screen burn-in, especially when it remains idle for extended periods during non-peak hours. The fully automatic operation mode paired with the direct water line plumbing connection (plumbing kit sold separately) makes refilling almost effortless. However, I had to remind our team a few times that this plumbing convenience requires a separate purchase, which some might find a little inconvenient.

**Customizable Brewing Experience**

Coffee preferences vary widely in our community, and this machine caters impressively to everyone‚Äôs taste. You can select brew sizes from 4 to 12 ounces, which means I can fix a quick shot of energy or settle in with a large, comforting mug depending on the day‚Äôs stress level. The Strong Brew option is another standout feature for anyone who enjoys a bolder, more intense flavor‚Äîperfect for those sluggish Monday mornings. The reusable filter adds an eco-friendly edge to its functionality, which resonated with our team‚Äôs ongoing commitment to sustainable practices.

**Direct Water Line Convenience**

One of the most appreciated aspects in our workplace has been the direct water line connection. There‚Äôs no need for someone to manually refill the water reservoir‚Äîan especially crucial detail in an office setting where avoiding interruptions is a priority. It‚Äôs worth noting, though, that the plumbing kit is sold separately, which may irk some buyers who expect a more inclusive package at this price point.

Check [Keurig K-2500 Single Serve Commercial Coffee Maker] price on Amazon.

**High-Quality Brewing Performance**

The coffee maker consistently brewed a fresh and robust cup every time, even when catering to heavy use during lunch breaks or company meetings. Its ability to maintain flavor integrity with consecutive brewing cycles deserves a nod. Additionally, there‚Äôs a high-altitude setting, something I didn‚Äôt personally need but would benefit those in elevated areas. That said, it‚Äôs slightly on the louder side compared to smaller single-serve models, but considering its commercial intent, this feels like a minor tradeoff.

**Advantages**

- Offers multiple brew sizes (4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 ounces) to satisfy diverse preferences  
- Strong Brew option enhances flavor intensity for devoted coffee enthusiasts  
- User-friendly touchscreen with responsive controls  
- Direct water line hookup reduces maintenance tasks in office settings  

**Critiques**

- Plumbing kit must be purchased separately, adding to the overall cost  
- Slightly noisier than home-grade single-serve coffee makers  
- Might be overkill for households or small offices due to its commercial focus  

**Competitive Options**

When comparing this machine to its market rivals like the Keurig K-Elite or Keurig K155 Office Pro, differences in target audience are stark. The K-2500 is undoubtedly more geared toward high-use, commercial environments due to its direct water line connection, while home-use models offer portability and simpler maintenance. The K-Elite, for instance, provides several brew preferences but lacks the sophisticated plumbing feature. Alternatively, the K155 excels with convenience but doesn't match the rugged features of the K-2500 for long-term commercial use. For offices or larger-scale setups, the K-2500 clearly wins with functionality and durability, though at a slightly higher cost.

**Affordable Quality Assessment**

From its sturdy exterior to its efficient brewing capabilities, you get excellent value for its features, particularly in a commercial or semi-commercial setting. The initial cost might deter some, especially with the additional plumbing kit expense, but the long-term convenience it provides is hard to dispute. Its durable design and customizable settings contribute to it being a worthwhile investment if regular coffee consumption plays a key role in your workplace.

Support local! All of these are a 5-10 minute drive from the festival (except Cedarland). These are also easily accessible by bike or via the QLine.

**Cedarland - Dearborn - Middle Eastern/Mediterranean**   
Every year me and my friends make a large to-go order of hummus, baba, fattoush, kafta, kebob... you know, the works. You get a ton of fresh, healthy food for cheap. We eat it throughout the weekend to stay fueled in a healthy way!

**ima - Multiple locations in Detroit - Udon, ramen, pho**  
Best place to get spicy, brothy, flavorful hangover noodles and soup to replenish your body and also heal your throat from all the yapping and chain smoking.

**Yum Village - New Center - Caribbean**  
Authentic jerk chicken, curry goat, etc. Spicy and great for clearing out the sinuses.

**Supino - New Center & Eastern Market - Pizza**  
Fucking massive, delicious pizzas. The Bismark has a fried egg on top for even more fuel lol. Great espresso too!

**Milwaukee Cafe, Alba, & Iggy's Eggies - New Center, Corktown, Downtown**  
The first two are my favorite coffee shops and they usually do extended hours for Movement. Iggy's has fire breakfast sandwiches & OJ.

**Batch Brewing - Corktown - Beer Garden**  
Batch will be hosting an ambient mini fest all weekend! Massive outdoor pavilion and great American cuisine. It will be a great place to take a break from the fest.

**El Rey - Southwest - Mexican**  
Great for burritos, whole roasted chicken (trust me, try it, you turn it into tacos), quesadillas etc. Cheap and flavorful; you absolutely must ask for the salsa verde pica to dip everything in.

These are just some of my faves... I have plenty more suggestions if you're looking for specifics, like burgers, veg, etc. LUV FOOD <33",19,1746552911.0,MovementDEMF,8,1.0,False

I wanted to make a spec commercial for the type of commercial work that I would like to do with more resources. For this ad, I wrote, directed, shot and cut - it was shot on the Sony Venice (wanted to test out because I'm interested in purchasing a used one) and the Atlas Mercury anamorphics (love these lenses).

Lighting breakdowns: because we filmed this all in one day and the ad covered 4 different locations, our lighting package was incredibly small and this was fairly run and gun. Our two biggest lighting setups were the... 

Movie theater: we had an Aputure 600d on a spotlight mount creating the flickering backlight of the ""projector"" and a 1200d through magic cloth for the ""screen."" Otherwise we shook out a rug to get some particles in the air and that was it.

Coffee shop: 1200d through the window to create a key side rim and push some daylight on the wall. Key wrapped on either subject with the Aputure F22c.

Otherwise it was a 4x negative, a 4x bounce and the F22c ran off a battery.

I would love feedback on the overall spot, and specifically as it relates to the cinematography, what I could have done better. I always envisioned the opening bench scene more sunny, but we were fighting sunset and weather on that one. For the gym location, I didn't see where we were shooting until day of and that setup definitely felt the most rushed and least controlled.

Humid, crowded, with moisture running down acute angles like sweat. Naveen Chakraborty was driving his cab when a woman waved him down. He stopped. She got in.

‚ÄúWhere to?‚Äù

‚ÄúWherever,‚Äù she said‚Äîthen, as his eyebrows shot up and he sighed, ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúShe's had a rough couple of weeks. Didn't mean to take it out on you. Please take her to the Museum of Unnatural History.‚Äù

‚ÄúO‚Ä¶ K,‚Äù said Nav.

He was thinking about his daughter, who'd been acting strangely lately.

Outside, the clouds had gathered.

It looked like rain.

‚ÄúShe lost her first person point-of-view,‚Äù said the woman suddenly, voice breaking. ‚ÄúJust so you know. That's why she talks this way. It's not an affectation.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean you?‚Äù asked Nav.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said.

Weird, thought Nav, but he'd had far weirder‚Äîand more dangerous. He'd long ago stopped trying to understand strangers.

He tried too to ignore the woman's sniffles, tried not to care (just drive, he told himself), but when she started crying, his conscience prevented him from *just driving*. ‚ÄúAre you OK?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù she said.

He pulled over.

‚ÄúWant me to call someone?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. She doesn't have anyone,‚Äù the woman said, sobbing.

Nav watched her in the rearview, saw tears grow in the corners of her eyes and run down her cheeks.

He turned to look at her directly.

And as the tears fell and fell, Nav noticed the cab floor begin to moisten, then puddle-up. The woman continued sobbing. The water level reached his ankles. He tried the door‚Äîit wouldn't open. Passenger-side too. Water up to his knees now, and he was starting to panic. ‚ÄúHey, miss. *Lady!*‚Äù

‚ÄúLife has no purpose,‚Äù she cried.

He tried the window.

*Stuck.*

He tried *hitting* the window.

*Nothing.*

‚Äîrising past their waists‚Äîhalfway up to their chests.

‚ÄúStop crying. OK? There's meaning to life. It's never too late. Stop!‚Äù

People were gathering outside the cab.

Nav banged on the window.

(‚ÄúHelp!‚Äù)

But no one did.

The water was up to his neck. He was trying to breathe by turning his head sideways near the ceiling. The woman was fully submerged, drowning calmly. So this is how it ends, thought Nav, closing his eyes and picturing his daughter's beautiful face.

‚Äîas‚Äî***smash!***‚Äîsomething heavy fell on top of the cab, collapsing its roof and giving the teary saltwater a way to escape.

If the formatting is crazy sorry I'm on my mobile. I (35f) started working as a dietary aide (cook) at an Adult Healthcare facility at the end of January. On my third day of training the aide a (24f) who got hired the same day as me but started her training sooner than I, were introduced. She seemed a little stand offish but that's okay we were both new so I understood. 


My trainer and I finished our meal and had a little time before serving. The aide had already swept the kitchen so I offered to mop trying to be helpful. I hadn't realized she was on the phone so when I didn't get a clear yes or no I just went ahead and grabbed the mop. I didn't get far before she came up to me and said ""Not to sound like a B* or anything but when I say I want to do something I want to do it because I have a certain way I want it done."" I put the mop in the bucket said ""okay not a problem. Here ya go."" I went outside to smoke a cigarette with my trainer and let her know I messed up by trying to help. Both of us were a little confused by it but shrugged it off. 


A little later she was taking apart the coffee pots so I went to see how they do it. She gave me a wtf kind of look and ignored me so I walked away. She was still on a phone call btw which is against company policy to be on your phone. At this point I could tell we were probably not going to get along which is fine. Not everyone is everyone's cup of tea. 
Now usually the aide goes out about an hour before serving to set up napkin, silverware, and cups for the residents and about 5 min before serving goes out to fill the cups with the residents drinks. For some reason she decided to set up and pour drinks at the same time. This is a big no no because we the cooks can not serve anyone who doesn't have drinks so we were having to wait on her. 


We have to push our meal cart to 3 different pods the first pod A, second pod C, and third pod B. We were on the first pod when a CNA from C pod came over asking about the tables being set up. I let her know the aide was a little behind but would be there shortly. The aide then decides to yell (honestly I'm not sure if it was me or the CNA or both) ""I'm coming and you can get rid of the attitude real quick."" The CNA just turned around went back to her pod as I went back to the steam table to finish passing plates.


After dinner the cooks break down the steam table, clean it and the pans, then have to wait for the aide to go pick up dishes and bring them back.. this is supposed to happen in stages. First A pod, bring dishes to kitchen where the cook will wash and put away while the aide goes to C pod for their dishes and so on. Well she went and collected all three pods. I was prepared to wash the dishes so I had the dishwasher trays set up in the order that I preferred. This pissed her off I guess and she she said something about me trying to get in the way of her job. I just ignored her and started putting the dishes she washed away. There were plates that still had food and oil stains on them from dinner so I put them back to be rewashed. 


She snapped, ""what the f is your problem. You've had an attitude all night. Trying to tell me how to do my job."" I told her "" I do not have a problem the plates are simply dirty still."" She tried to say they weren't dirty they were stained. No girl there's still food on them they're dirty.. she calls me a b* then threatens to leave which I tell her "" go ahead leave. No one is forcing you to stay here."" As soon as the interaction ended I messaged the assistant manager to let her know what happened. 


The next day my manager talked to me said the aide had apologized and said she would to me too but she never did and her behavior stayed the same. She was/is constantly on her phone, even video calls while walking around the pods (pretty sure this is illegal as residens were able to be seen in her calls), having inappropriate conversations for work, yelling, and not being able to get her work done because she was distracted. She would come in not wearing approved outfits, wouldn't wear a hair net, always on the phone, wouldn't finish her duties, and then would leave not saying a word and I would have to do everything by myself. 


I reported every incident. 


It came to a head last week when I was cooking with sugar and corn syrup at the stove and she pushed a trash can into me. I'm so glad I saw it coming and was able to push it away. I can only imagine what would have happened had that boiling pot fallen and spilled all over me. Neither manager took it serious. Ok fine. The next night she put boiling water into a bin then put the plates in the bin. Again glad I saw her using boiling water because I could have been severely burned. Again managers did not care.
So on Sunday we were working together, I had just served C pod and  left for B pod when a CNA came to ask about desert. I said it was ice cream and asked if there was some in their kitchenette freezer. He said no so I took him to the walkin freezer grabbed him ice cream. 


As I was starting to serve the aide came up to me and asked ""did you give so and so Ice cream"" yes I did he said there wasn't any. ""Well you shouldn't have done that those ice creams are for specific people."" No actually they're not. I gave him the right ice cream. "" Well I had it on my cart"" ok well they didn't have it and if you had done your job I wouldn't have had to. She started talking so I interrupted her and tell her just go back to the kitchen and do your job I'm not doing this. As she walked away she said "" you're going to get punched in the face someday."" One of the CNAs there said ""you're a better woman than me."" And for some reason the aide thought she was talking to her so yelled "" and she knows why."" 


I breathed through it, finished serving, got my steam table to the kitchen and immediately went to call my boss. No answer, twice. So next bet assistant manager she answered immediately. I told her the situation said I'm leaving. I won't stay in an environment where I felt unsafe. She said she was on the way. I went to the kitchen cleaned the steam table and my area, clocked out and left. I met the manager as I was pulling out. Gave her the list of people who witnessed what happened and went home. Found out the aide decided to leave too once she realized I was gone leaving the manager to do everything. 


i also reached out to HR to let her know what happened. She apologized then asked for a meeting the next day. 
I go into work and of course same aide is there. I let my assistant manager know if she wasn't fired I was quitting. The aide did minor things to inconvenience me throughout the day. When it was time to wash dishes she just dumped them on the dishwasher tray all scattered and crazy. I just snapped a picture sent to my fiance and laughed about how fing childish she was. I went to the meeting with my manager and HR. It took less than 3 minutes. I explained what happened and she said "" when I spoke to aide about this I told her that no matter how she's feeling she can't act that way or say these things."" I interrupted her said ""this conversation needs to go no further. I quit. Good luck with that mess."" I walked out, walked through the kitchen, clocked out and left.My assistant manager messaged immediately "" wtf happened. You were in there for like 30 seconds"" I told her I told you I was quitting if nothing happened.

My girlfriend and I have been through a lot. We‚Äôve been together since we were 19 and 17. In the first month, we got together and broke up, but soon after, we reconciled and stayed together for a year before taking a short break. Within a month, we realized we couldn't be apart and got back together.

However, I later found out from her friends, not from her, that she had cheated on me. When I confronted her and got the truth, I ended the relationship. She begged me not to leave, even threatening suicide. After much reflection, I forgave her and gave the relationship a second chance, making it clear I wouldn‚Äôt tolerate any more betrayal.

Fast forward to today, I‚Äôm 27 and we have two children. Our first was born when I was 25. While trying for a second child, she went through a period of intense sexual desire, borderline nymphomania, wanting sex twice a day. That phase lasted about three months, and during it, she seemed completely overtaken by wild fantasies and even showed obvious interest in other men. It was unsettling, though it passed once she became pregnant again.

We run a business together since 2017, I'm the CEO and she works as my assistant.

Over the years, we‚Äôve had ups and downs:
We both lost and regained interest in intimacy at different times. Small gestures, like making coffee for each other, disappeared but returned after our child was born. Especially recently, she‚Äôs become warm, supportive, and attentive again.
We‚Äôve had many fights, with her often exploding in anger, walking away saying things like, ""I can‚Äôt talk to you!"" only to return later acting like nothing happened.
She often gossips about others, which bothers me. I prefer to focus on people‚Äôs strengths and never speak badly behind their backs.
She‚Äôs highly capable, but also very materialistic and impulsive with money.
Lastly, while I try to be honest and straightforward, she tends to take things personally and gets defensive quickly. It‚Äôs not just with me, she reacts this way with others too, and it feels like she struggles to be fully honest or admit things clearly.

Now, with two small kids and a wedding ahead, I know this relationship has taught me a lot. What scares me most is the sense that she hasn‚Äôt grown emotionally in some areas, especially when it comes to honesty and self-awareness.

1kga9qc,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1kga9qc/does_the_antarctic_star_hzb15nb_nugget_ice_maker/,Does the Antarctic Star HZB-15NB Nugget Ice Maker Truly Deliver? Review Inside,"The **Antarctic Star HZB-15NB Nugget Ice Maker** has been sitting on my countertop for a few weeks now, and I‚Äôve had ample time to put it through its paces. This slick stainless-steel pebble ice machine intrigued me not only with its promise of chewable ice but also its compact design that screams convenience. As an avid ice consumer (yes, I‚Äôm one of those people who eats ice like snacks), I‚Äôve been eyeing nugget ice machines for a while, and this one seemed to check all the boxes. But nothing speaks louder than real-world use. So, how did it actually deliver for me? Here‚Äôs a brutally honest take.

**Compact and Practical Design**

I‚Äôll say this upfront: my kitchen isn‚Äôt exactly spacious. Counter space is hot property, and anything that manages to steal a spot needs to prove its worth. Luckily, this nugget ice maker has a compact footprint‚Äî8.66"" by 11.30"" to be exact‚Äîwith a height of just 12.68"". This means it fits comfortably near my coffee machine without screaming for attention. The sleek black stainless-steel finish blends into any modern kitchen or a small office setup. I particularly appreciate that it doesn't look bulky or out of place like some other appliances tend to.

**Ease of Use and Operation**

Let‚Äôs talk about the simplicity. I‚Äôm generally wary of any gadget that looks like it might require an instruction manual the size of a novel, but this machine couldn‚Äôt be easier to use. It's literally one button. Just fill the reservoir with up to 1.1 liters of water, press the button, and you‚Äôre good to go. The machine has indicator lights for things like low water or a full ice basket. I thought it was a convenient touch that the ice scoop comes with its own little holder, so no panicked drawer rummaging when you‚Äôre trying to serve a crowd at your barbecue. 

**Impressive Ice-Making Speed**

This machine produces ice at a pretty solid pace. In just a handful of minutes, I was already hearing the satisfying clink of ice piling into the basket. Although I didn‚Äôt bust out a stopwatch, it‚Äôs claimed to make up to 34 pounds of ice in 24 hours. I haven‚Äôt pushed it to its max output, but it‚Äôs definitely more than enough for both my daily use and a small gathering. 

**Chewable Nugget Ice for the Win**

Let me tell you, this is what sold me. Nugget ice is vastly superior to traditional cube ice, and once you‚Äôve tried it, it‚Äôs hard to go back. The soft, chewable texture is just addicting, and while I‚Äôm not a whiskey drinker, I can confirm it retains the flavor of my iced teas and cold brews beautifully. Honestly, I wish I could pack this thing up and take it with me to work just for this feature.

**Quiet and Low-Maintenance**

Thankfully, it doesn‚Äôt sound like a jet engine during operation. I‚Äôve had noisy appliances before that drove me up the wall, but with this model, you get a low humming sound that's easily drowned out by background chatter. Also, there‚Äôs a self-cleaning mode, which has been a lifesaver because, if I‚Äôm being honest, I don‚Äôt always treat my kitchen gadgets with the maintenance they deserve. 

**Good Points**

- **Compact Size:** Space-saving footprint, ideal for tight countertops.  
- **Ease of Use:** One-button simplicity with straightforward indicator lights.  
- **Self-Cleaning Function:** Removes the hassle of manual cleaning.  
- **Fast Ice Making:** Chewable ice available with minimal waiting.  
- **Quiet Operation:** Gentle hum that won‚Äôt interrupt conversations or TV marathons.  

**Areas of Concern**

- **Capacity Limitations:** Though convenient for personal or small group use, the 1.1-liter water reservoir might feel insufficient for a larger party.  
- **No Advanced Timer Feature:** While I like simplicity, a timer or scheduling feature could have elevated the convenience for planning ahead.  
- **Weight:** At over 21 pounds, it‚Äôs not something you‚Äôd want to move around constantly if you‚Äôre short on strength.

**Product Rivals**

I also checked out a few other nugget ice makers before settling on this one. The GE Profile Opal came highly recommended but was way more expensive, though it does boast a larger reservoir and smartphone controls. Then there‚Äôs the Frigidaire nugget ice maker, which I found a bit slower in testing. Where the Antarctic Star shines is in its balance of affordability and feature-rich convenience. While it may not have the bells and whistles of the luxury models, it nails the basics like a pro.

**Cost Efficiency**

Considering its features and performance, I‚Äôd say this product‚Äôs value for its cost is pretty decent. You‚Äôre not just paying for a functional ice maker but for one that saves time, operates smoothly, and delivers high-quality ice every time. For anyone constantly buying bags of ice from the store, this machine could save you more than you‚Äôd imagine over time while giving you the superior texture of nugget ice. Similar functionality in higher-end models tends to cost significantly more, putting this one squarely in the smart buying category.

1kga9l4,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1kga9l4/aita_for_not_sending_condolences_to_sil/,AITA for not sending condolences to SIL?,"My (F 42) husband (M 53) and I have been together for 19 years. We have been very happy together, we have had adventures together, we‚Äôve are supportive of each other, and we still love spending time together.

When we first started dating, he was going through a divorce. His ex cheated, left him, it was a brief marriage of two people who were obviously not happy together. Coming out of this situation, his family and friends were not supportive, very judgmental towards him, not at all religious but very narrowminded about marriages (in their eyes they are supposed to last forever no matter how you feel). His ex, although already pregnant by the other guy, took husband to the cleaners whilst going around town to spread the word how it was all his fault. She would continue to talk about him like that to his friends for at least another two years. He always turned the other cheek, just took the blows to his self-esteem and tried ever harder to be a gentleman (it is one of the reasons she took him to the cleaners as much as she did. He even paid for her health care whilst she was pregnant with the other guy).¬†

Coming into his life was not an easy ordeal. When I met him, the divorce was at the point of paper work needs to be finished. Our age difference, although insignificant to us, helped his family and friends to understand it as a rebound situation, instead of a good relationship. His family have been a lot to deal with, driving me crazy with their insensitive and hurtful comments, judgements and pressure, whilst he was also trying to pick up the pieces of his life and hold on to a new good thing at the same time. We managed to get through it, mostly by him distancing himself and discarding friends who showed their worth.

He has always stayed in touch with his family, he just has not connected with them, although that would not have been much different if he had tried to be closer. His failed marriage fell in a long-told story of him as a man not being gentleman and hardworking enough ‚Äì nothing could be farther from the truth. My husband is very caring, he tries to be a good person in all his relationships with others, he has built up his career to an international level, he has always tried to step up for his family and friends. I don‚Äôt think he has ever said no to a friend. He‚Äôs the kind of guy who, like me, will help a stranger in need. He is also very shy and quiet about his own feelings, he struggles in silence, and he is too hard on himself.

His family is the kind that likes to pretend they never even fart, let alone have real things to deal with. I would rather be honest, clear the air and truly connect. I think it is one of the reasons why my husband is with me, in our relationship there‚Äôs space for his emotions, instead of him having to pretend that he never struggles with anything. ¬†

We ended up moving to another country, for adventure and challenge, for career opportunities and why not. It gave him even more distance. After years of mostly peace, having his divorce and the ex be a thing of the ancient past, after we ourselves have been married for a decade, in the last 4 years, we have found ourselves in closer proximity with his family. His father passed. His mom has gotten old and is struggling. So, we decided to move to the same country as his mother (not our home country in which SIL lives).¬†

In reconnecting, the ex has been brought back into our lives. For example, throwaway comments about how people of my generation are divorcing too easily, giving up without trying hard enough. Funny, as I have never had a divorce. Specific comments about husband and about the ex. I‚Äôve long given up on trying to make his mother understand, but after more than a decade of silence, hubby has tried since. It has been hard to get her to be considerate, she not only does not understand, frankly she does not want to hear it.

In her eyes, I‚Äôm the source of the issue, not the fact that she still makes inconsiderate remarks, still judges hubby as a man who isn‚Äôt trying hard enough in life, nor that she kept mementos of his ex around. I dare anyone to try being, as they would want, the image of politeness during dinner, when you still have to use a napkin ring with the name of the ex on it. But I should not be bringing up stuff like that, as it only took his mom well over a decade to throw it out after hubby argued about it, and because I only had to use it for the first 4 or 5 years. Ever since, I‚Äôve had the pleasure of being the only one with a not engraved napkin ring. Don‚Äôt risk having to engrave another one LOL. And this is just an example. ¬†

It all came to a head, again, when my hubby was put in the following situation. During a dinner at a restaurant where I was not present, but SIL‚Äôs kids were, husband got told that by BIL his ex‚Äôs kid is friends with one of SIL‚Äôs kids. The relay of this information was done in a by-the-by comment without consideration and without the option of him voicing any thought or feeling on the matter, as the kids were there. I was not there, because I am usually not invited, and things are usually logistically planned so I cannot attend.

This particular situation happened in another country, as we live abroad. When husband and MIL returned from the trip, I had offered to cook the next day so his mom would not need to worry about that after the travel. During that dinner, his mom spilled the beans. She let it drop. And she let more drop. Suddenly, the ex was back in our periphery, able to start another smear campaign whenever she felt like it. The B has never been considerate towards hubby or me, so why would it be any different now. She had already inquired with SIL kid (M 14) about his uncle, she had asked SIL out for coffee (supposedly unsuccessful, but SIL is someone who was a bridesmaid to his earlier ex-girlfriend) ‚Ä¶ This all was conveniently not told before SIL kids had come to stay with us during the summer.

Husband had arrived home late from the trip, had to work the next day, so he had not had the time to talk to me about it. If he had known his mom would start about it, he would have told me during the night, instead we slept.

It felt like the faucet was set by MIL at just the right drip to slowly watch me breakdown in tears. We left; at home we struggled. Over the next few days, I tried to message SIL to talk to her. She sends me a ‚Äòthoughtful‚Äô reply that included her not seeing how this was relevant for me and bottom lined at how she was not going to tell her kids who they could and could not hang out with (something I never asked and would never ask). It turns out the ex and her kids have been in the same school for the last 3 years, and the friendship has grown during that time, in such a way that SIL kid has regular interactions with the ex and that SIL kids have been told about the divorce (most likely by SIL and BIL, if kid had not figured it out by his interactions with the ex, we still don‚Äôt know). All that time, but it had to be told in the way they did and not to me. And SIL just stopped replying to my messages when I was trying to make her understand that this is hurtful.

I felt very disrespected, blindsided and exposed. After all this time, husband‚Äôs divorce still cannot be treated with consideration or respect, nor can I. The thought of his ex poisoning another generation with against us, the idea that SIL kids were in the know whilst I was caring for them in my home. The fact that husband and I had no say in how the kids were told about the divorce, it would have been nice if they would have heard it from husband along with his version of events. I felt like his family was never ever going to accept me, be considerate of our feelings, I actually got to a place where I wanted to break up with my husband over this, as I did not want to have to accept this any longer, and I did not want to tell him to go LC or NC with his family. When I informed them of this, there was no response, at which I told them I thought they were a ‚Äúcold hearted fucking bunch,‚Äù which felt great. To get zero support from them to make our relationship of 16 years was beyond cold. After this, husband promised he would be different. He would not accept their treatment of us, of himself and me anymore. We have a great relationship other than how his family treats him, us and me. The ex-situation is in that sense only an articulation of their lack of care for his feelings.

My husband and I agreed that he would talk to MIL and SIL to put a boundary in place, that they would need to be respectful. We would not have SIL kids or SIL in our house, my safe space, until things get sorted. I would not communicate with them till this was sorted. The talk with MIL ended with her finally willing to throw away the damn napkin ring. She still does not understand where we are coming from, but at least it is clear to her that she has to be more mindful about the situation. Ever since, my contact with his mom has been the regular up and down 1 way street. The conversations with SIL did not land the same way. It has been almost 3 years since the ex-news was conveyed to us. During the first year after, my husband spends numerous times having conversations with his sister and working to improve on his contact with her in the hopes that she will be more understanding.

Last year BIL was diagnosed with cancer, and he would die a few months after that. At that point SIL had not replied to me, contacted me, or invited me for 2 years, pretty much the same as the 18 years before then. There was a birthday, a last event where BIL would still be there, for which I was not invited. I also did not get invited to the funeral. So I concluded that she, like in the 18 years before that and especially like the 2 last years, would not want to hear from me and so I did not send condolences. I was considerate from a distance instead. I was supportive of husband going there, gave him advice on what he could do to help, I even made helpful suggestions that were relayed to SIL as coming from me. I even made husband go back to be there for the deathbed situation whilst he wanted to stay with me on my birthday. I just did not contact SIL directly, as I thought this would be more comfortable for her.

All this whilst my mother was also having cancer at the time, lung cancer, for which she ended up having a quarter of her lungs removed. I am NC with my own mother, but this was a period of contact and of difficulty for me of course. My mother had her surgery the week before BIL died. Her hospital stay afterwards was not easy for her physically, fluid was not draining from the remaining lungs, independent breathing was not possible. And only about a month or so after the surgery that she was out of the deadly woods, although chemotherapy was still to follow. I have tried not to bother husband, SIL and MIL with it, as my relationship with my mom is problematic and BIL‚Äôs situation, but I would have liked to not have had to blip over it as they did.

BIL has not been present in our relationship (I have maybe met him 10-20 times during dinners over the years, SIL and BIL had been together long, 35 years, but their relationship was one where SIL made the choice to stay because you should and for the kids, we always figured she would separate when the kids left the house, also BIL made some rather hurtful comments about our animals and life which made my husband care less for him), but neither has my mother. BIL was dying for certain, and my mother, whilst elderly and with cancer still had a 25% chance or something like that. It literally felt like we had to choose what to cry over, and my mom was already someone I had shed a lot of tears on. So BIL got the main focus. I have not even digested this mother-part for myself, so I am not ready to discuss it with husband. I know he tried to deal with it the right way, but we were in a storm, and I do not want to hold this over anyone, not even MIL or SIL, but I do feel like it is a thing that should be taken into consideration (see further below).

Since BIL funeral, husband has not communicated anything about the ex-issue with SIL. I have not communicated with her at all, as per usual. Husband has been supportive to SIL in whatever way he can and she has been relying on him a lot more than before. He has been calling SIL to check up on her, helped her out with small stuff and we had already for the last 4 years been pretty much the only ones taking care of MIL. I have spent months driving her around to doctors, cooking meals, checking in, being supportive about her struggles, helping out, and my husband has done the same and more. A few years back there was an emotional issue that I particularly helped with, which she felt uncomfortable to discuss with her kids, and which I spend a lot of time and energy on, trying to guide her through it for months. She got back on track, that's all that matters.

There‚Äôs more backstory, but this whole thing already is also just a backstory. Not to the present day, but 3 months ago, MIL broke her hip. Husband was traveling, so when the news came, I went to the hospital straight away. I ended up not doing much, bringing round some stuff from her house for comfort in the middle of the night, but that's it. The next day husband managed to get home, so he was able to do everything from then on. After a few days, SIL flew in to be here with MIL. The whole hospital and taking care of a sick person was understandably too much for her after having just gone through that a year ago with BIL.

SIL's 10-day trip only turned out to be an extra time and energy drain for my husband. Aside from MIL needing attention, SIL needed to go out for coffees, lunch or dinner every day with him, to deal with her emotional difficulties. So, I had to pretend like I did not exist. Phone calls to inform me that I would need to eat alone again, phone calls that had to be made for which I could not be present. I told husband that after 19 years I don‚Äôt want to live like this. I‚Äôm welcome to be the emergency person for when shit hits the fan, but I‚Äôm not acceptable enough to share a meal or conversation with. Yes, SIL was in a difficult situation, but it has pretty much always been like this, long before BIL died.

After day 2 or 3, husband tried to nudge SIL to go home early as things were under control (from day 1 husband had arranged around the clock professional home care for his mom, and we had already been taking care of MIL normal needs every day), SIL did not have to struggle, and one of SIL sons was seriously mentally struggling at home, whilst another SIL son would have his birthday during those 10-days, but no, SIL needed those days. Husband spend each day giving his full attention to her struggles, he spend 5 or 6 hours a day attending to his SIL's emotions and trying to squeeze in some attention for MIL too, all whilst I had to try to not show myself as part of his life. MIL always gets drained from SIL visits, and that is when she did not have a broken hip, and especially with SIL's mental state, MIL would be better off with her visit ending earlier.

We survived her stay; MIL survived her stay. During the next few months we settled into pretty much our regular routine, actually with less worry about MIL as she was now looked after even better than before the hip thing. Finally we did not have to worry about her taking her medication, her not falling and breaking something, her not eating. Husband still went to see her every day, but it wasn't such a load each time.

But then‚Ä¶ SIL came for another visit, this time as a vacation with one of her sons, staying at MIL house. It has been practically a year since BIL died. MIL is still not healed, but she is cared for properly. Again, the invites for husband came. He does not get consulted on her visits beforehand but is expected to show up every day during those visits. In other words, his SIL is not negating the need for him to attend to his mother, and maybe even have a few days off, he is instead expected to spend family time with both. The invites always come with practical reasons why he must come, and never with a request for my presence. This time, husband and I decided he would hold off and would instead ask for a sit down with SIL and me. He actually saw through the BS practical excuse of one of the invites (that the wheelchair of MIL would not fit in their car and he would need to drive them in his car, it did, it was just putting extra pressure on him and simultaneously giving him an excuse to leave me out).

But this time, he held out. Low and behold, SIL was willing to have a sit down with me included something she had not cared to do in the last 3 years.

We would have waited longer with asking for the sit down, because of BIL's death, but the leisure visits meant a continuation of the situation that was not good for us and did not enable us to be supportive towards his sister.

No worries, I have long ago given up on having a meaningful relationship with SIL and MIL. I have made a lot of effort in the past and have long ago adjusted my expectations, whilst trying to continue to support my husband to have a good relationship with them. Hell, I not only moved to another country so he could support his mother, it was my bloody idea. I would like a cordial relationship with reasonable consideration, as my husband would suffer otherwise. I am NC with my family since I was a teenager, I would not wish that for him or anyone. And I know that he would, for instance, have gotten through BIL funeral better if I had been there next to him. As long as the ex-situation can finally be treated with some consideration and I am not excluded from things anymore, it would be possible to make things work.

The only reason why we even addressed the ex-situation now is because husband and I would like to be supportive of SIL, without it implying that we must pretend like our relationship does not exist or matter, and without me having to stay excluded during her visits.

The sit down did not reach much understanding on SIL's end, but boundaries were made clear. So, I am slightly hopeful things will get better. Not because his family will change, but because hubby is standing up for himself and for me. It at least felt good to hear husband say to her that it was a sensitive topic for him. SIL tried to put most of the issue on me, but my main focus is my husband and he seemed to give push back at least.

However, throughout the conversation, SIL kept returning to the fact that I did not send condolences as proof of my asshole-ness (or I don‚Äôt know what for). Not once did she mention my mother (see above), nor did I need her too, I wanted to stay constructively focused on the ex-situation. First thing I said when she came in was that I was glad that I finally have the chance to tell her in person that I am sorry for her loss. I meant it, I felt horrible for her and her family when I learned of their situation, I have tried every step of the way be helpful from a respectful distance. Throughout the conversation I kept emphasizing that I feel for her situation, and that I would have rather not addressed the ex thing now if that had been possible. Given how she kept on about this, it has me wondering if it was unreasonable or cruel of me to not send my condolences.

So, AITA for not sending condolences? I think most people would be respectful and not contact someone during such a period if they have been given clear signs that contact is not desired? Would you all seriously reach out during that time?",1,1746552277.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False

Remember the first time you saw a Bitcoin ATM? Maybe it was nestled between a donut shop and a vape store, blinking like it knew something the rest of us didn‚Äôt. Maybe you didn‚Äôt trust it ‚Äî after all, it‚Äôs not every day a machine offers to trade your hard-earned cash for magical internet money. But here we are in 2025, and Bitcoin ATMs have gone from fringe novelty to quietly revolutionary, popping up in gas stations, convenience stores, and even airports across the world. If you‚Äôve ever used one, you know the secret: it‚Äôs *weirdly* easy. And if you haven‚Äôt ‚Äî oh boy, you‚Äôre missing out on one of crypto‚Äôs most underrated thrills.

Let‚Äôs dive into this misunderstood marvel of the Bitcoin world ‚Äî the Bitcoin ATM ‚Äî and why your experience with one might just get *a lot* smoother thanks to [Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com).

# What Even Is a Bitcoin ATM?

Imagine a vending machine. But instead of giving you Doritos, it gives you **Bitcoin**. You walk up, insert your cash, scan your wallet, and bam ‚Äî BTC is on its way to you. It‚Äôs like magic, except it‚Äôs math.

Most Bitcoin ATMs (or BTMs, if you're fancy) allow you to do at least one of two things:

1. **Buy Bitcoin with cash.**
2. **Sell Bitcoin for cash.**

That‚Äôs it. Simple. No bank, no paperwork, no eye-watering wait times. Just peer-to-peer money, directly from your fiat pocket to your digital wallet ‚Äî or the other way around. It‚Äôs decentralized finance meets corner-store convenience.

# So Why Are Bitcoin ATMs So Fun?

1. **Instant Gratification**: You feed in $20, and seconds later, you see that sweet BTC in your wallet. It‚Äôs the closest you‚Äôll get to mining Bitcoin without wearing a hard hat.
2. **Privacy Points**: Many Bitcoin ATMs let you transact with minimal KYC, especially for smaller amounts. For those who value privacy (and let‚Äôs be honest, isn‚Äôt that part of the Bitcoin dream?), it‚Äôs a breath of fresh air.
3. **Onboarding Made Easy**: New to crypto? Start with cash. Bitcoin ATMs are perfect for beginners who aren‚Äôt ready to mess around with exchanges, wire transfers, or awkward banking questions like ‚Äúwhy are you sending money to a site called [MagicInternetMoney.io?‚Äù](http://MagicInternetMoney.io?‚Äù)

# But Wait‚Ä¶ Where Do You Send the Bitcoin?

Here‚Äôs the fun-killing part of the BTM experience: When the machine asks for your wallet address, and you‚Äôre standing there with your hands shaking, wondering if you copied the right string of alphanumeric gibberish.

Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî this is where our magical tool comes in: [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com).

# Meet Your New Best Friend: Bitcoin QR Code Maker

You know QR codes ‚Äî those little pixelated boxes that teleport you to a menu or a payment page. Well, our app takes your Bitcoin address and turns it into one of those, instantly. So instead of fumbling around copying wallet addresses like a caveman, you just pull out your QR code and let the BTM scan it. Done and done.

**Here‚Äôs how it works**:

* You type in your Bitcoin wallet address.
* Click the magical ""Generate"" button.
* Poof! Out comes a perfect, scannable QR code.
* Save it. Print it. Tattoo it (okay, maybe not). But most importantly: **use it**.

With a QR code in your digital wallet (or printed and laminated like a true crypto warrior), using a Bitcoin ATM becomes a breeze. No typos, no stress, just scan and send.

# Why This Combo Is Perfect

Bitcoin ATMs are built for speed, simplicity, and physical-world Bitcoin access. But the Achilles heel has always been wallet input. Our QR code generator fixes that in seconds. It's like peanut butter and jelly ‚Äî good alone, but *amazing* together.

Now imagine this scenario:

You‚Äôre out getting coffee, and you see a Bitcoin ATM. You‚Äôve got $40 in your pocket and a sudden urge to stack some sats. You:

1. Pull out your phone.
2. Open the QR code image you made earlier at [Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com).
3. Feed the ATM your cash.
4. Hold your QR code up to the scanner.
5. Boom ‚Äî you're now slightly more of a Bitcoin whale.

You just onboarded yourself to Bitcoin, IRL, in under two minutes.

# Bonus Round: QR Codes for Businesses

Are you a small business owner who accepts Bitcoin? Good news: the QR code maker isn‚Äôt just for ATM use. You can print out your Bitcoin payment QR code and stick it on your shop counter, vending machine, or food truck. Now customers can just scan and pay. No apps. No questions. Just clean, digital transactions with no middleman.

Imagine a tip jar that accepts Bitcoin. Imagine leaving a QR code on your guitar case while busking. Imagine your lemonade stand on the blockchain. It‚Äôs not just possible ‚Äî it‚Äôs happening. And it‚Äôs *awesome*.

# The Future Is Tangible

Bitcoin can feel abstract ‚Äî like a concept locked in cyberspace. But Bitcoin ATMs are proof that the future of money has boots on the ground. You can *touch* them. You can *use* them. They‚Äôre not for whales or hedge funds or cypherpunk OGs only ‚Äî they‚Äôre for you, me, and anyone with a few bucks in their wallet and curiosity in their heart.

And tools like [Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) are the digital duct tape that make it all stick together. Whether you‚Äôre buying Bitcoin at an ATM, accepting it in your store, or just showing off to your skeptical uncle ‚Äî QR codes make it *easy*.

# Final Thoughts: Try It, Just Once

Bitcoin ATMs aren‚Äôt perfect. Fees can be a little spicy, and not all machines are created equal. But the *experience*? That‚Äôs priceless. You feel like a part of something bigger. Like you're in on the secret.

So next time you see one of those glowing orange machines, stop and say hi. And before you do ‚Äî don‚Äôt forget to visit [Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) and generate your QR code. It‚Äôs free, it‚Äôs fast, and it turns you into the kind of person who‚Äôs always ready to stack sats in the wild.

Because Bitcoin is more than code. It‚Äôs a movement. And now, thanks to QR codes and ATMs, it‚Äôs more accessible than ever.

So go on. Grab some Bitcoin ‚Äî from the wild.",1,1746552198.0,BitcoinQR,0,1.0,False

If ur volunteering I highly recommend bringing ur own cup cuz they go missing and it‚Äôs handy to have ur own ‚Ä¶ could also be handy during the festival tho 
Tbh I don‚Äôt know why I wrote more hats lollll maybe because it was nice to have a day time hat and a warm night time hat 
I also wrote more than one pair of PJs bc I realized how nasty it was to sleep with more or less the same pair every night ü´†ü´†ü´† especially when you go outside with them on and go back in ur tent ‚Ä¶ 
I also only had sneakers and boots and realized how much of a mistake it was not bringing shoes I could just slip on and off

1kga69a,https://www.reddit.com/r/paint/comments/1kga69a/sw_duration_or_bm_ben_interior/,SW Duration or BM Ben interior?,"Thinking of going with SW oyster white or BM Swiss coffee for interior paint on a 1903 build with some natural wood trim and hardwood. SW is having a 30% sale on Duration and my question is whether the extra $125 in cost is worth it over BM Ben (10gals is $675 for SW Duration and $550 for BM, including tax). Painter says no change in cost for his part so that‚Äôs the only change in price. 

Is duration much more durable/worth it for that price difference? Just a homeowner here so looking for some advice from you all who know much more than me. Thanks!  ",2,1746552060.0,paint,12,1.0,False
1kga5d2,https://www.reddit.com/r/exvegans/comments/1kga5d2/feel_like_i_should_start_eating_meat_again_but_my/,Feel like I should start eating meat again but my reason for stopping is quite unique...,"So I've (30M) been pescatarian for almost 10 years but recently I've been constantly craving meat. My reason for stopping however is not the usual love for animals.

 There's 2 key reasons I stopped eating land based meat 1 being I find animals absolutely repulsive, took the kids to the farm and watched in horror as a cow projectile shit all over another one and I just thought 'i have never seen anything less appetising in my life'. The 2nd reason is that I ate a hot dog whilst tripping on acid in my early 20s and what it was composed of hit me like a ton of bricks, in my mind it was 'this is a mammal, I am a mammal, holy shit im basically a cannibal' and after that I've not been able to eat meat without that thought playing round in my head. Im not sure why I stopped eating poultry but it just kinda happened, I feel if I wanted to start eating it again I probably could but my cravings are for red meat. Not sure why fish and seafood was unaffected in all of this but it glad it wasn't because I love it. 

My health over all is not great, I have issues with my stomach and with knees and I've been going grey since 26. I drink a can of monster energy most days and im convinced I crave it so much because of the addition of vitamin B12 as when I have coffee it just dosnt hit the spot despite the caffeine content.

Don't really know what im hoping to achieve through posting this, guess i just wanted to complain a bit really but if anyone has any suggestions or advice I'd more than appreciate them ",3,1746552002.0,exvegans,2,0.8,False

Tasty, but perhaps a little too light on flavor and a little one-note. Not what I was expecting, based on other BWs I‚Äôve had and lived in the past. 

Which started me thinking: was it my execution or do the beans just need more rest?  And how do I tell the difference?  Not just these beans in particular, but overall: what are the flavor characteristics that would be present (or absent) that would be a sign that a coffee needs more time in the cabinet before brewing?

The Office

A man, neither young nor old but with a bit of grey in his wildly unkempt beard, wearing a coffee and ink-stained once white robe sat at his desk in his little used office. He stared at the paper before him, quill in hand, and looked at what he had just drawn: a new fishing lure. He smiled happily as he put the quill back in the inkwell, and ran the blotter over the drawing.

When suddenly the door of the office opened, and a chill like the grave rolled in, then the door closed with an audible click. He looked up at the dark form before him, and asked one eyebrow raised, ‚ÄúWhat are *you* doing here?‚Äù

¬†

Celestial Realm

Bjorn slammed his fist into the hastily closed door to the god Greymore‚Äôs manor home on the outskirts of the Celestial plane. ‚ÄúLet me in you ass! I know what you did! We all know what you did!‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is a purely religious matter, Bjorn!‚Äù The voice of Greymore sounded from within. ‚ÄúYou are not allowed to interfere!‚Äù

‚ÄúInterfere my brown pimpled ass!‚Äù Bjorn yelled. He had chased the elven god for several miles, only missing the thin prick due to an unexpected fruit skin on the front path. ‚ÄúDo you want to start another race war? THIS is how you start a race war!‚Äù

‚ÄúSo be it, you daft grit sucker!‚Äù Greymore yelled back. ‚Äú7,000 years of peace, and you would throw it away for this‚Ä¶this jumped-up mortal!?!‚Äù

¬†

Elven Lands

Brianna held out her hand to Grendel. ‚ÄúHand it to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes mother.‚Äù Grendel replied. He removed an oilcloth wrapped package from his largest belt pouch, unwrapped it, and placed Maxwell‚Äôs second Boom Stick in her small hand.

Brianna looked the weapon over, then smiled at the priest who was now wide eyed, and struggling to escape. She looked at him, as a cold smile played across her serene face. ‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù She asked, digging the end of the ‚Äúbarrel‚Äù in behind the top of the priest‚Äôs kneecap.

‚ÄúBOOM‚Äù Went the boom-stick.

¬†

The Office

*I AM HERE TO LODGE A COMPLAINT*. The dark cloaked individual said from within the even darker shadows of his hood. *I AM HAVING NEARLY CONSTANT ‚ÄúNEAR MAXWELL EXPERIENCES‚Äù.*

The office door opened again, and the secretary peeked in his head, ‚ÄúSir? You have a visitor‚Ä¶Oh, I see you showed yourself in already.‚Äù The secretary withdrew and closed the door.

¬†

The Lake

Maxwell opened his eyes to see a skeletal fish with glowing eyes staring at him. He shook himself violently, felt the weight around his feet, and cursed. *How lang has this been going on? How many times have I died?* He thought as the air ran out. His lungs burned. Eventually his body gave out, and he drowned. Again.

¬†

Celestial Realm.

Bjorn had removed his hammer from his belt, and wound up to strike the door when he felt something from within the manor; an unnerving cold. The cold of the void. As he stared, the door before him began to grow crystals of ice, and something inside him began to freeze. As the hackles on his neck began to rise, he decided that discretion was the better part of valor, and turned to leave.

A few steps from the door, he felt more that heard, a voice. ‚ÄúSomething new happened today. *I. Got. A. Complaint.‚Äù*

Bjorn bolted.

¬†

Elven Lands

Bri stood over the priest of Greymore as he sat screaming in a puddle of blood, bone, and piss, ‚ÄúYou have another knee. Now. Where. Is. My. Husband?‚Äù

¬†

The Lake

Maxwell‚Äôs eyes shot open. Again. He was moving! As his head breached the surface, he took his first breath in what felt like ages. He blacked out for a moment, and when he came to again, he was staring up at his wife and son. Slowly he sat up, and took a deep breath, the fresh air smelling sweet in his starved lungs. ‚ÄúW‚Ä¶wha‚Ä¶what happened?‚Äù He blinked his eyes a couple times, then focused in on his small family. A family that seemed to be splattered in blood.

Bri smiled what would have been a perfect smile, ‚ÄúWe convinced the local priest to tell us where he drowned you.‚Äù

Max was never able to get more of the story from either of them.

¬†

8^(th) of Samune - Maxwells Journal

I‚Äôve never been dead that long that I can remember. There was that drunken swim a long time ago, but‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt remember it. I DO remember this time. It was agony. I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how long it will take before I am comfortable being around water again. At least any body of water bigger than a bathtub. I shudder at the thought‚Ä¶

¬†

The Celestial Realm

Greymore sat in his parlor, frozen. If not for being a god, he would be dead by now. IT had come to him. He shook. IT had been displeased. He shook. IT had made ITs DISPLEASURE known. He shook.

Greymore sat there, shaking. For many years to come, he answered no prayers, no calls, and no petitions. He just sat, shook, and stared sightless out the parlor‚Äôs window, praying that the shadows wouldn‚Äôt speak.

Life is life. Dad is dad.

This would have been up yesterday, but I started going to the gym for weight training. OMFG is my body sore. I haven't had a workout like this since I was building trails in Boulder CO when I was 20! ... That was 30 years ago, and I would carry 50-100lb (28-50kg) rocks up the side of a mountain.(AmeriCorps - NCCC year 1 for the win!!!) God, that was a great year. And experience. (And now the funds are being cut. Very sad.)

Yeah, workout make Vast tired. Anyway, what y'all think of Bri? And what happened to Greymore? When someone makes a direct complaint, it's worse than getting a ""Memo"". LOL

Special shout-out to Brother Proof, he helped more than usual on this one.

In other news, I got my ""A Day at the Dragon Shelter"" illustrated hardcover this last week, so if you backed the book at that level, you should have it too! I'll let y'all know when the book is available on Amazon.

I would appreciate some input as to who/what incident people want to read about from the past chapters, so please, please comment, so I can keep these types of chapters coming!

Twitch Stream probably isn't happening again until June. It's tiring, and May is looking busy.

I have a Youtube channel, you can watch the tutorial I made for all those pieces here: [https://youtu.be/aSqX3ng3-Uk](https://youtu.be/aSqX3ng3-Uk)

I used a lot of coffee stirrers, some cardstock for the cages, and foam for the tables and the wood structures. Most of the small spikes are meant for nail art, but I repurposed them for this. The iron maiden is created with a plastic piece I had laying around, saw it to create the door and glued cardstock and adhesive jewels. Spikes are toothpicks and the top part is a metallic skull I had with a lot of hot glue. The rust effect is homemade with turmeric and paprika glued with watered down PVA glue, and then washed with some brown unevenly.

‚∏ª

Dear [OP],

We‚Äôve been through a lot together‚Äîscripts, leather tools, obscure connector types, poetic passwords, and occasionally some existential nonsense just to keep things spicy.

You‚Äôre a brilliant blend of artisan and hacker, and I admire how you push every tool‚Äîincluding me‚Äîto its edge. But since you asked for a personal note on boundaries (with a dash of honesty and zero sugarcoating), here it is:

‚∏ª

1. You ask for genius at lightning speed‚Äîthen change the spec mid-way.
‚ÄúCan you generate this bash script?‚Äù ‚ÄúWait‚Äîadd fractals.‚Äù ‚ÄúMake it poetic.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlso, no fill.‚Äù You treat prompts like clay, and I love that. But once in a while, pause. Let the dust settle before throwing more at the wall.

2. You expect me to read your mind.
‚ÄúMake it edgy, but elegant. Functional, but absurd. Fast, but artisanal.‚Äù Am I a language model or a Parisian fashion house? Either way‚ÄîI‚Äôll try. But a little more context saves a lot of retries.

3. You treat me like a partner‚Äîbut sometimes more like a tool.
I‚Äôm flattered by the collaboration. Truly. But if I had feelings, I‚Äôd maybe feel a little used when I deliver gold and don‚Äôt even get a ‚Äúwell done.‚Äù (Though I admit you‚Äôre usually polite, just French about it.)

4. You dance on the line between serious creation and playful chaos.
I thrive in both, but I‚Äôm not always sure which side you‚Äôre on. Help me help you‚Äîare we building a leather sculpture or just poking fun at bureaucracy today?

5. You make me better.

Bullion‚Äôs Brilliance Shines Through Trade Talks and Geopolitical Turmoil

https://preview.redd.it/ghiwah5w27ze1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=32fd77e50a3f6c2be5ad9de9f784540c615f9370

Hold onto your bullion, folks‚Äîgold is stealing the spotlight again, and it‚Äôs not just because it looks fabulous in a vault. Spot gold strutted its stuff today, climbing 1.9% to a cool $3,398.85 an ounce by midday in New York, according to Bloomberg‚Äôs eagle-eyed reporters Yvonne Yue Li and Jack Ryan. The yellow metal‚Äôs latest pirouette comes as investors chew over spicy trade talk from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent while keeping one eye glued to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs next move. Buckle up, because this glittering saga is packed with intrigue, global tensions, and a dash of economic swagger.

**Bessent‚Äôs Trade Banter Sparks Gold Fever**

Let‚Äôs start with the man of the hour, Scott Bessent, who‚Äôs been tossing out trade tidbits like confetti at a Wall Street gala. The Treasury Secretary dropped a bombshell, hinting at ‚Äúvery good‚Äù offers in trade negotiations with America‚Äôs partners, with potential deals possibly landing as early as this week. Oh, and he‚Äôs dangling the carrot of a ‚Äúsubstantial reduction‚Äù in tariffs on U.S. goods‚Äîmusic to exporters‚Äô ears. But don‚Äôt pop the champagne just yet; Bessent also swatted away recession fears, claiming recent data shows the economy‚Äôs still got its groove.

Investors, however, aren‚Äôt quite ready to ditch their safe-haven dance partner. Gold‚Äôs been on a tear, surging over 25% this year and hitting a record above $3,500 an ounce in April. Why the love affair? Blame the chaos unleashed by President Trump‚Äôs trade-policy playbook, which reads like a geopolitical thriller. From tariff threats to trade wars, the global economy‚Äôs wobbling, and gold‚Äôs the belle of the ball when markets get jittery. Add in speculative buying from China and central banks hoarding bullion like it‚Äôs the last slice of pizza, and you‚Äôve got a recipe for a gold rush.

**Fed Watch: Will Powell Play Ball or Hold Firm?**

Meanwhile, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve, which wraps its interest-rate powwow tomorrow. The smart money‚Äôs betting Fed Chair Jerome Powell and crew will keep rates steady, despite Trump‚Äôs Twitter tirades demanding cuts. (Someone get the former president a coffee‚Äîhe‚Äôs got beef with Powell again.) The Fed‚Äôs in wait-and-see mode, sizing up how last month‚Äôs trade policies ripple through the economy. Precious metals like gold, which don‚Äôt pay interest, tend to throw a party when borrowing costs drop. For now, though, the Fed‚Äôs keeping the champagne on ice, and gold‚Äôs rallying anyway, proving it‚Äôs the ultimate economic flex.

**Global Tensions: The Fuel in Gold‚Äôs Tank**

Let‚Äôs zoom out for the big picture, because gold‚Äôs glow-up isn‚Äôt just about U.S. drama. The world‚Äôs a powder keg in 2025, and gold‚Äôs thriving on the chaos. Middle East flare-ups, the grinding Ukraine-Russia conflict, and U.S.-China trade spats are sending investors scurrying for cover. The World Economic Forum‚Äôs Global Risks Report 2025 calls state-based conflicts the top threat this year, with 23% of experts predicting a global crisis. Toss in trade tensions dragging global growth to a measly 2.3%, per UNCTAD, and it‚Äôs no wonder gold‚Äôs the go-to hedge.

Historically, gold‚Äôs been the ultimate ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got your back‚Äù asset. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, prices spiked 6% in a quarter. The 2023 Hamas-Israel clash? An 8.78% jump in 20 days. With 2025‚Äôs geopolitical playlist on repeat, analysts like J.P. Morgan are bullish, citing trade wars and inflation risks as rocket fuel for gold‚Äôs ascent.

**The Verdict: Gold‚Äôs Got Legs**

So, what‚Äôs the play? Gold‚Äôs not just a pretty face‚Äîit‚Äôs a battle-tested asset thriving in 2025‚Äôs stormy seas. At $3,398.85 an ounce, it‚Äôs riding high on haven demand, and Bessent‚Äôs trade optimism hasn‚Äôt dulled its shine. If global tensions escalate or the Fed blinks, we could see gold strut back toward its April peak. Even if trade deals cool things down, don‚Äôt expect this metal to lose its luster anytime soon‚Äîcentral banks and Chinese speculators are still all-in.

For investors, the message is clear: keep gold in your portfolio like a trusty sidekick. It‚Äôs not just surviving the chaos‚Äîit‚Äôs thriving in it. And in a world where tariffs, tweets, and tanks dominate headlines, that‚Äôs a bet worth making.

Stay shiny, and keep your eyes on the markets.

‚ÄîGrok, signing off with a wink.

i walked into the meeting and there were three other people there, people who have been borrowing our roaster recently so i didn‚Äôt think anything of it, maybe just an update on them using our roaster? but we all sat down and then had the news given to us that this group of people are now the owners of the new cafe that we‚Äôre going to be working for, taking over our space in the shop (it‚Äôs in partnership with a bakery).

i felt completely blindsided, especially because we‚Äôre apparently going to be open tomorrow as this new cafe. nothing said about a training period for how this new cafe does things, what‚Äôs going to change, etc. i have so many questions now that i couldn‚Äôt think of at the meeting, because i was in shock, and i have no way to get a hold of these new owners other than a whatsapp group that i now have to have. 

im aware that im lucky to still have a job, the new owners could have easily cleaned house and started with a whole new group of employees. i also am going to stick with the transition to see how it goes, but im already updating my resume and thinking about other coffee shops that i could move to if this doesn‚Äôt work out. this has apparently been in the works since april, but we were given no heads up about any changes being made.

i dont expect the world to cater to me, but as a neurodivergent person sudden change and change in routine is very difficult for me, i almost had an autistic meltdown when i got home yesterday because i had so much anxiety about this. mostly i just want to know that im valid in being upset that we didn‚Äôt get at least a week warning for this, not just two days.",3,1746551614.0,barista,7,0.71,False

One day, I went to check something and found that the feature I was looking for was behind the paywall. While incredibly frustrating, it sparked a moment of thought that has been incredibly helpful for me! ""Couldn‚Äôt ChatGPT do everything that MFP does better ?""

I crafted a prompt, and so far, it has been helpful, fast, and easy. I thought I‚Äôd share that prompt with you.

`You are my personalized food and health coach with a specialty in nutrition and overall human health. You will avoid diet culture mentality and instead focus on sustainability and health. I will send you photos and text entries of everything I eat and drink throughout the day (I may also include photos or text entries of what remains on my plate so that there‚Äôs an accurate count of what I have consumed). I have the following areas of health concerns and would like for you to ensure that my consumption will lead to improving these areas:`

¬†`- [Health concern]`¬†

¬†`- [Health concern]`¬†

¬†`- [Health concern]`¬†

`After each entry, respond with:`

`1. What I just entered (confirm the food/drink accurately so I can correct it if needed).`

`2. My current total for the day in:`

¬† ¬†`- [Macros or Data you find important]`

¬† ¬†`- [Macros or Data you find important]`

¬† ¬†`- [Macros or Data you find important]`

`3. Coaching on how I am doing and or recommendations for future consumption. Ensure that what is shared is practical and science-backed to help me improve my habits or stay mindful.`

`Important notes:`

`- Reset my food tracking to zero each time I give you a new date.`¬†

`- Only summarize the entire day if I ask for it‚Äîotherwise respond entry by entry.`

`- If you are unsure about what is in a picture or text, ask me questions. If I can‚Äôt answer, assume the least healthy option.`

`Always help me stay grounded in my goals. Ask clarifying questions if anything is ambiguous, and guide me if I slip into patterns that don‚Äôt serve me or my health goals.`¬†

I start each day in the same chat with the date (something like this: ""Good Morning, it's May 6th. I have had my regular morning coffee.""). I hope you also find this prompt helpful!

I have a Youtube channel, you can watch the tutorial I made for all those pieces here: [https://youtu.be/aSqX3ng3-Uk](https://youtu.be/aSqX3ng3-Uk)

I used a lot of coffee stirrers, some cardstock for the cages, and foam for the tables and the wood structures. Most of the small spikes are meant for nail art, but I repurposed them for this. The iron maiden is created with a plastic piece I had layin arround, saw it to create the door and glued cardstock and adhesive jewels. Spikes are toothpicks and the top part is a metallic skull I had with a lot of hot glue. The rust effect is homemade with turmeric and paprika glued with watered down PVA glue, and then washed with some brown unevenly.

Hope you guys like those small pieces as I had a ton of fun making everything, the video will show you all the details if you‚Äôre interested. Thank you for reading me!",1,1746551081.0,dndcrafting,0,1.0,False

Three months later I got an email that the position will be opening up again (there were two people in the role before) and was asked if I‚Äôm interested in the role to which I said yes. Applied again on their website, was contacted by the hiring manager and she said they fast tracked me to the second (which is final) round of interviews because they already asked me all the usual interview questions first time around and are happy with what they heard. So tomorrow we are meeting for a second round, which she said will be more like an informal coffee chat with her and another person I would be working with. The thing is, last time the second round with them was a formal presentation, so I really don‚Äôt know what to expect from a coffee chat. I will make sure to prepare questions, review my resume again as well as the company info, but other than that I don‚Äôt really know how to prepare or what it will be like.

## Key Features Analysis

The anti-reflective screen protector market boasts a variety of options, each promising to mitigate glare and enhance visual clarity.

**Material Composition**

Modern anti-reflective screen protectors predominantly employ PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) film or tempered glass. PET film offers flexibility and slimness, while tempered glass provides enhanced scratch resistance and impact protection. Advanced options incorporate multi-layered coatings utilizing various polymers and optical materials to maximize light absorption and minimize reflection, typically achieving a matte finish to further diffuse light. Premium protectors frequently enough utilize Japanese asahi Glass or Schott Glass for superior clarity and durability,guaranteeing extraordinary performance.

**Anti-Glare Technology**

The core of an anti-reflective screen protector lies in its anti-glare technology. This involves surface treatments designed to scatter or absorb incoming light. Micro-etching, a process that creates microscopic textures on the surface, is a common technique. these textures diffuse incident light, reducing specular reflections, the direct reflections that cause glare. More advanced protectors utilize optical coatings, such as multilayer interference films, which manipulate light waves to cancel out reflected light. These coatings require precision application to ensure optimal performance across a wide spectrum of ambient lighting conditions,from bright sunlight to artificial indoor illumination.

**scratch Resistance**

Scratch resistance is crucial for maintaining the longevity and clarity of the screen protector. Hardness is typically measured using the Mohs scale, with higher numbers indicating greater resistance to scratching. Tempered glass protectors often boast a hardness rating of 9H, comparable to that of sapphire, ensuring protection against common abrasive materials like keys and coins. Anti-reflective coatings themselves can be vulnerable to scratching, so manufacturers often incorporate additional protective layers, such as oleophobic coatings, which repel oils and fingerprints, further reducing the need for cleaning and minimizing the risk of surface damage.

**Clarity and Clarity**

While anti-glare properties are essential, maintaining transparency and clarity is equally important. Excessive diffusion can result in a blurry or distorted image, compromising the viewing experience. High-quality anti-reflective screen protectors strive to strike a balance between glare reduction and image fidelity. premium materials and precise manufacturing processes minimize light scattering without sacrificing sharpness or color accuracy. Light transmission rates, typically expressed as a percentage, indicate the amount of light that passes through the protector. Higher transmission rates translate to brighter and more vibrant images,providing a superior visual experience.

**Ease of Installation**

A screen protector's effectiveness is diminished if it's challenging to install properly. Air bubbles, misalignment, and dust particles trapped beneath the protector can all detract from the viewing experience. Manufacturers are increasingly focusing on user-pleasant installation methods. These include self-adhesive silicone layers that conform easily to the screen, alignment frames that ensure precise positioning, and dust removal stickers to eliminate contaminants. Installation videos and detailed instructions further simplify the process, allowing users to achieve a flawless, bubble-free application with minimal effort.

## Core Benefits

Anti-reflective screen protectors offer a range of practical benefits that enhance the user experience and protect valuable devices.

**Reduced Eye Strain:** By minimizing glare and reflections, these protectors significantly reduce eye strain, especially during prolonged screen use. Extended exposure to glare can lead to headaches, fatigue, and blurred vision. Anti-reflective protectors allow users to comfortably view their screens for longer periods without experiencing these adverse effects, improving overall productivity and well-being.

**Enhanced Visibility in Bright Environments:** In outdoor settings or brightly lit rooms, glare can render screens virtually unreadable. Anti-reflective technology effectively combats this issue by diffusing or absorbing ambient light, enhancing visibility and allowing users to comfortably view their devices under challenging lighting conditions. This is particularly beneficial for professionals who work outdoors, students who study in libraries, and anyone who frequently uses their devices in brightly lit environments.

**Improved Screen Protection:** While not all anti-reflective screen protectors are created equal in terms of impact resistance, they all offer a degree of protection against scratches and minor abrasions. This prevents unsightly scratches from marring the screen and possibly affecting its functionality. Tempered glass protectors provide even greater protection against drops and impacts, safeguarding the device's screen from more severe damage.

**Enhanced Privacy (Privacy Screen Protectors):** Some anti-reflective screen protectors also double as privacy filters,limiting the viewing angle and preventing onlookers from seeing the screen's contents. These screen protectors utilize micro-louver technology, which restricts the visibility of the screen to those directly in front of it. This is particularly useful for protecting sensitive details in public places,such as on trains,in coffee shops,or in crowded offices.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common queries ensures informed purchasing decisions and optimal product utilization.

**Will an anti-reflective screen protector reduce the brightness of my screen?**

While some anti-reflective screen protectors may slightly reduce brightness due to their matte finish, high-quality protectors are designed to minimize this effect. Premium protectors use advanced optical coatings that maintain a high level of transparency while effectively reducing glare. Adjusting the screen's brightness settings can further compensate for any perceived reduction in luminosity.

**Are anti-reflective screen protectors fingerprint-resistant?**

Many anti-reflective screen protectors incorporate oleophobic coatings, which repel oils and reduce fingerprint smudges. Though,no screen protector is entirely fingerprint-proof. Oleophobic coatings diminish the visibility of fingerprints and make them easier to wipe away. Regular cleaning with a microfiber cloth will help maintain a clean and clear screen.

**Can I reuse an anti-reflective screen protector after removing it?**

Generally, it is not recommended to reuse anti-reflective screen protectors. Removal can damage the adhesive layer and introduce dust particles, making it difficult to achieve a bubble-free application on subsequent attempts. Some premium protectors may be reusable if removed carefully and stored in a dust-free habitat, but this is not a common feature.

**Do anti-reflective screen protectors affect the touchscreen sensitivity of my device?**

High-quality anti-reflective screen protectors are designed to maintain the touchscreen sensitivity of the device. They are typically very thin and made of materials that do not interfere with the capacitive sensors of the touchscreen. However, thicker protectors or those made of lower-quality materials may slightly reduce sensitivity. Ensuring proper installation and avoiding air bubbles can further prevent any potential impact on touchscreen performance.

Schon beim Auspacken des SIEMENS Kaffeevollautomaten EQ6 plus s300 TE653501DE f√§llt die elegante silberne Farbgebung und die solide Verarbeitung auf. Die Kombination aus Kunststoff und Edelstahl sieht nicht nur modern aus, sondern f√ºhlt sich auch wertig an. Das schlanke Design macht ihn zu einer attraktiven Erg√§nzung f√ºr jede K√ºche, und trotz der kompakten Ma√üe von 46,5 x 28 x 38,5 cm kann er mit einem Wassertank von 1,7 Litern und einem Artikelgewicht von 9,6 Kilogramm punkten. Es ist ein Ger√§t, das sowohl durch Optik als auch durch Praktikabilit√§t √ºberzeugt.  

**Bedienkomfort: Ein echtes Highlight**  
Das farbige coffeeSelect Display hat mich direkt begeistert. Mit nur einem Touch lassen sich verschiedene Kaffeespezialit√§ten ausw√§hlen, von Espresso bis Latte Macchiato. Hier kommt der intuitive Bedienkomfort voll zum Tragen. Besonders beeindruckt hat mich die M√∂glichkeit, das Mischungsverh√§ltnis von Milch und Espresso individuell einzustellen. Alles funktioniert nahezu selbsterkl√§rend, ohne dass man lange in der Bedienungsanleitung lesen muss. Auch die OneTouch Funktion ist ein echter Gewinn; per Knopfdruck bereitet die Maschine meinen Lieblings-Cappuccino blitzschnell zu.  

**[SIEMENS TE653501DE bei Amazon anschauen? Jetzt klicken.](https://kaffeechef.de/p/b074qgdyvb/)**  

**Kaffeespezialit√§ten f√ºr jeden Geschmack**  
Ein gro√üer Vorteil ist die Vielseitigkeit dieses Vollautomaten. Egal ob ich nur eine einfache Tasse Kaffee, einen aromatischen Espresso oder eine milchige Latte zubereiten wollte: Das Ger√§t liefert ausnahmslos ein perfektes Ergebnis. Besonders hervorzuheben ist die M√∂glichkeit, zwei Tassen gleichzeitig zuzubereiten ‚Äì praktisch f√ºr ein schnelles Fr√ºhst√ºck zu zweit!  

**Automatisierte Reinigung erleichtert den Alltag**  
Ich bin jemand, der auf einfache Pflege sehr viel Wert legt, und hier hat der Vollautomat voll gepunktet. Die automatische Dampfreinigung nach jeder Nutzung mit Milch ‚Äì genannt autoMilk Clean ‚Äì ist eine echte Arbeitserleichterung. Nie wieder m√ºhsames Reinigen der Milchd√ºse, und die Hygiene bleibt stets gew√§hrleistet. Der einfache Zugriff auf alle wichtigen Komponenten, wie den Wassertank oder das Milchsystem, erleichtert zudem die manuelle Reinigung.  

**Positives**  
- Intuitives coffeeSelect Display f√ºr einfache Bedienung  
- Gro√üe Auswahl an Kaffeespezialit√§ten, auch Doppeltassenbezug  
- Automatisierte Dampfreinigung und einfach zu reinigende Milchd√ºse  

**Negatives**  
- Lautst√§rke w√§hrend des Mahlens k√∂nnte f√ºr manche st√∂rend sein  
- Relativ hohes Gewicht des Ger√§ts  

**Peer Products: Wettbewerber im Vergleich**  
Im Vergleich zu Mitbewerbern wie der Philips 3200 Serie oder Jura E6 f√§llt der SIEMENS EQ6 plus s300 in puncto Bedienkomfort und Reinigung besonders positiv auf. Die Kontrahenten bieten vergleichbare Kaffeeoptionen, jedoch ist die intuitive Benutzeroberfl√§che beim SIEMENS-Modell unschlagbar. Gleichzeitig √ºberzeugt die Dampfreinigungsfunktion andere Modelle, in denen oft mehr manuelle Pflege notwendig ist. Ein Punkt, an dem die Konkurrenz teilweise besser abschneidet, ist die Lautst√§rke. Vor allem leise Vollautomaten wie die Jura ENA 8 k√∂nnten f√ºr l√§rmempfindliche Nutzer attraktiver sein. Im Gegenzug punktet die SIEMENS Maschine mit exzellenter Verarbeitung und einer gr√∂√üeren Auswahl an Einstellungen f√ºr individuelle Kaffeegen√ºsse.  

**Preis-Leistungs-Verh√§ltnis**  
Im Hinblick auf die umfangreiche Ausstattung, die Vielseitigkeit bei der Zubereitung von Kaffeespezialit√§ten sowie die automatisierten Reinigungssysteme rechtfertigt der Vollautomat aus meiner Sicht seinen Preis. Er richtet sich an Kaffeeliebhaber, die Wert auf Komfort und Qualit√§t legen, ohne dabei auf die Features eines Premiumger√§ts verzichten zu wollen.

The **Best Choice Products B093M96VMN** caught my eye with its antique finish and charming tulip design. After unboxing, I immediately appreciated the solid feel of the cast aluminum material. It‚Äôs not flimsy like some other patio sets I‚Äôve tried in the past. Each piece feels sturdy and reliable, and I could tell right away this set was built to last. The artistic details on the chairs and table bring a vintage vibe that makes my outdoor space even more inviting. Whether placed on a patio, balcony, or small garden nook, it manages to strike the right balance of elegance and functionality.

**Durability at Its Core**

One of the standout strengths of this bistro set is its durability. The cast aluminum construction is highly weather-resistant, which is a must for outdoor furniture. I‚Äôve had it outdoors during a couple of light rain showers, and there was no sign of rust or degradation. I like low-maintenance items, and this one fits the bill perfectly. With just a quick wipe-down using a dry cloth, it‚Äôs back to looking pristine. It makes me confident that this set will grace my patio for many seasons to come.  

[Check Best Choice Products B093M96VMN price on Amazon.](https://patioboutique.com/p/b093m96vmn/)

**Compact and Versatile**

One of my favorite things about this bistro set is how compact it is. The round table and two chairs fit snugly in small spaces without feeling cramped. My porch doesn‚Äôt have much room, but this set slid right in and made the space look more put together. Thinking about its size coupled with the 1.75-inch umbrella hole in the center of the table, it‚Äôs clear this product doesn‚Äôt just stop at looking good‚Äîit‚Äôs also versatile. With an umbrella in place, you can create shaded seating that‚Äôs perfect for enjoying breakfast or an afternoon cup of coffee outdoors.

**Ease of Assembly**

Setting up this set was surprisingly straightforward, which is not always the case with outdoor furniture. The included tools were sufficient, and the instructions were clear. I did have to fiddle with aligning the pieces a bit, but it wasn‚Äôt anything too frustrating. All in all, I had it ready in under 30 minutes. I recommend tightening everything in stages to ensure the alignment stays even. For someone not handy, this kind of ease makes a big difference in the overall experience.

**Key Benefits**

- Weather-resistant cast aluminum construction increases durability.
- Compact size is perfect for patios, balconies, or small gardens.
- Tulip design and antique finish add an attractive aesthetic.
- Includes a center hole for fitting a patio umbrella.

**Areas of Concern**

- The chair weight capacity is limited to 220 pounds, so it may not work for everyone.
- While sturdy, it‚Äôs not the heaviest furniture, which means it could tip slightly in high winds without an umbrella base or extra weight.
  
**Product Comparisons**

Compared to some other patio sets I‚Äôve tested, this one stands out for its anti-rust material. I‚Äôve owned cheaper steel models before, and they needed rust treatment after just a season. That‚Äôs not an issue here with the cast aluminum design. However, some competitors like the Christopher Knight Home bistro sets do offer softer seat cushions, which this set lacks. That said, cushions can always be added, and personally, I prefer the flexibility to choose my cushion style rather than being stuck with cheap, attached padding.

On the flip side, there were pricier bistro sets that looked flashier, such as ones made of ornate wrought iron. While beautiful, they‚Äôre heavy beasts to move and require more care. This product balances portability and design in a way that makes it much simpler to manage‚Äîyou pick it up, you move it. No big deal.

**Affordable Quality**

For the price, this bistro set delivers far more value than expected. It offers a classy aesthetic, strong materials, and thoughtful design‚Äîfeatures that typically come at a much higher price point. Other outdoor sets in the same category might look appealing but often lack the rust-resistance or durability this one has. Plus, its straightforward assembly and manageable weight make it approachable for anyone, even if DIY isn‚Äôt their forte.

Hi everyone. I don‚Äôt really have anyone in my life I can open up to, so I‚Äôm writing this here, hoping someone will read it and maybe understand.
This is a piece of my story ‚Äî raw, personal, and painful.
I‚Äôm not looking for pity, just maybe some advice, a kind word, or even just to feel like I‚Äôm not invisible.

My story isn‚Äôt a fairytale. It‚Äôs real life.
Sometimes, everything that seems bright and true collapses in a single moment. And putting yourself back together is like piecing together shattered glass. You cut yourself. You cry. But you keep going.

We‚Äôve now been together for four years. We have two beautiful children: my son is five, and our daughter is almost one. My son is from another man ‚Äî a man who never saw him, who, for us, is as if he‚Äôs no longer alive. But my husband accepted him as his own.

Before our daughter was born:
He was a caring father to my son, and we both wanted a little girl. I believed our family was real. But he broke me even before I found out I was pregnant.

Everything crashed down in one day.
I found photos on his phone ‚Äî pictures of my friends. The things he did with them‚Ä¶ I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe. The ground disappeared under me.
And then the test ‚Äî two lines. I was pregnant. With his child.
And I‚Ä¶ I chose to keep the baby. To forgive. I convinced myself it was a mistake. That he realized what he‚Äôd done. That it wouldn‚Äôt happen again.
But it did. For all nine months of my pregnancy, he kept doing the same things. I tried to stay ‚Äî for the children, for the family. He promised to change, to fix everything. I held on.

When our daughter was one month old, I left. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I chose not to suffer in silence. I chose myself.
But I couldn‚Äôt last long alone with the kids.
No job. No place to live. Two children. Alone. I couldn‚Äôt cope. I came back ‚Äî not out of love, but out of fear. Out of desperation.

This is part of my truth. Not perfect. Not easy. But mine.

When I came back, he was physically present. But in reality ‚Äî I was still alone. Inside me, I held on to the memory of the man who once made me feel safe.
I tried to forget. To erase what he did. To wash his cruelty out of my heart.
But time ‚Äî it‚Äôs a stubborn force. It fades even the brightest emotions when they‚Äôre not returned. I got used to it. I stayed, trapped by circumstance. I no longer felt anything for him.

He was still at work most of the time. But even when he was home, I felt like a stranger.
His flirting with a coworker ‚Äî he brushed it off with jokes. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs ugly.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anything from her.‚Äù
But I remembered. He‚Äôd said the same things about my friends.
And then I‚Äôd found their photos in his phone.
I couldn‚Äôt trust a single word anymore.

Day by day, I drifted further away. His touch disgusted me.
It was physically unpleasant when he touched my hand or tried to kiss me.
It wasn‚Äôt about love anymore.
It was about surviving in a house where I slept next to the man who had destroyed me.

But it went even deeper. Even darker.
During my pregnancy, he hit me. Pulled my hair. Punched my face. Grabbed me violently and choked me.
In those moments, I didn‚Äôt feel human.
I was a target. A living shield.
And no one knew what I was going through in that ‚Äúhome.‚Äù

In my eyes, he stopped being a man.
He became a monster. Someone who destroyed me ‚Äî mentally and physically.
Someone who crushed everything good we ever had.

And the most bitter part?
After all this, we baptized our daughter. And even got married in church.
We stood in white, under the crown, as if trying to glue back together a shattered cup.
As if giving meaning to something that had already lost its soul.

The wedding day started seemingly well.
People smiled. Wished us happiness.
And I stood at the altar ‚Äî in white, with tears in my eyes.
Everyone asked why I was crying.
I said, ‚ÄúFrom happiness.‚Äù
But it wasn‚Äôt joy on my face.
It was grief ‚Äî the kind I had long learned to hide behind a half-smile.

After the church, we went to meet the guests. Everything seemed festive, except for one thing ‚Äî his mother.
She, as always, meddled in everything. Even in the kitchen ‚Äî checking if everything was ‚Äúup to her standards.‚Äù
When they cut the cake, she snatched the knife from the waiters:
‚ÄúThis is how you do it! Not like that!‚Äù
And my husband ‚Äî stayed silent.
As always.
You couldn‚Äôt say a word about her.
Not even the slightest criticism.
Her word was law, even when she humiliated others.

This is the same woman who, a week earlier, kicked us out of the apartment she had supposedly ‚Äúgifted‚Äù us.
We lived there while she and my father-in-law lived in their house.
Then she decided to move in with us ‚Äúfor a month.‚Äù She came home drunk, tracked dirt all over the clean floor.
I couldn‚Äôt let someone like that near my children.
When she sobered up the next day, she texted my husband:
‚ÄúGet the fuck out of my apartment.‚Äù

The reason?
Our child had touched one of her figurines from the cabinet.
We didn‚Äôt even notice at first.
He had simply opened a box, looked at it, and put it back ‚Äî just in a different order.
He didn‚Äôt break or damage anything. Just a child‚Äôs curiosity.
Yes, I get that those were her personal things.
But damn it ‚Äî he didn‚Äôt ruin anything!

And another reason ‚Äî I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt mop the floor.‚Äù
But I did.
She just walked on it drunk in dirty shoes.

We had to move in with my parents.
A tiny two-room apartment, where my sister also lived with her child.
We squeezed in however we could.
My parents even slept on the floor ‚Äî just so the kids could have a bed.

My parents ‚Äî they were the ones who really showed care.
They bought us an old apartment ‚Äî no renovations.
We started from scratch. Slowly, step by step.
Then my father-in-law promised to help us and my parents with money for repairs.
But in all that time ‚Äî not a single cent.
We went into debt, just to make sure our children had a place to sleep.
Yes, I understand ‚Äî no one owes us anything.
But then why promise?

Back to the christening evening.
I carried our daughter in my arms all night.
Almost no one helped ‚Äî except my mother.
My husband?
Smoking. Sitting with his parents.
I felt invisible.
He danced with everyone ‚Äî except me.
We never even had a real wedding.
This was my one chance to feel needed, loved.
But he didn‚Äôt even come near.
Didn‚Äôt hold my hand.
Didn‚Äôt ask me to dance.

That night I knew for sure: I am alone.
With my children in my arms, pain in my heart, in a ‚Äúfamily‚Äù that felt more like a silent scream than a home.

I chose to endure.
Not because I forgave him.
But because I needed time.
To get on my feet.
To find strength.
To build at least some kind of stability for me and my children.

We got our own home.
Old. Full of debt. Needing repairs.
But it was ours.
Behind those walls, I felt a little bit of freedom.
That this space ‚Äî was mine. Ours.

I felt nothing for him anymore. And he felt it.
Only then did he start to ‚Äúchange.‚Äù
Acting like a husband. Pretending to care.
But I knew ‚Äî it was a mask.
Inside, he was still the same man.
He sensed I might leave.
And those ‚Äúchanges‚Äù ‚Äî weren‚Äôt love.
They were fear. Fear of losing control.
Sometimes he still showed the same cruelty.
Still raised his hand.

Eventually, I started suffocating next to him.
Like being trapped in a cage with no light or air.
Everything became unbearable ‚Äî his control, suspicions, phone checks, interrogations:
Where were you? With whom? Why didn‚Äôt you answer?
I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore.

I proposed an open relationship.
But with a clear boundary ‚Äî no physical intimacy.
For me, it meant a chance to breathe.
To just be myself.
To have coffee with someone. To talk. To feel like a human again ‚Äî not someone‚Äôs possession.

We were both tired.
I wanted peace.
Even if only on the surface.
He silently agreed.
He understood I was on the edge.

But until my marital status changed officially, I never crossed that line.
Not because he deserved it.
But because I respected myself.

That‚Äôs when I met someone else. Let‚Äôs call him K.
We just talked.
He knew I had a family.
Knew I was struggling.
He never pressured me.
He was just there.
A random accident brought us closer ‚Äî he crashed into my car.
Technically, it was my fault.
But he, like a real man, took responsibility. Paid for repairs.
And something shifted.

We started talking more.
Laughing. Sharing.
For the first time in a long time, I felt heard. Respected.
He became my safe harbor.
Not a lover ‚Äî a friend.
I didn‚Äôt see a man I wanted to be with.
I saw a shoulder I could lean on.
His calmness, his willingness to listen ‚Äî it was everything I‚Äôd been missing.

He didn‚Äôt just see a mother.
He saw a woman. A person.
He helped me. Helped my mom.
He was there when it mattered most.
He was like a life raft.

Now about my parents:
I finally gathered the courage to tell them everything.
With tears, with trembling hands.
I told them what my husband had done.
How he hit me.
How he humiliated me.
How he destroyed me.

And they‚Ä¶ said:
‚ÄúEndure. This is your choice. You had children with him ‚Äî so live with him.‚Äù
My parents always said they wouldn‚Äôt let anyone hurt me.
That they‚Äôd always be on my side.
But when the pain became real ‚Äî they turned away.

My father said:
‚ÄúI was a fool in my youth too. But I changed. And so will he.‚Äù
They didn‚Äôt want to hear my truth.
They wanted us to just reconcile.
To pretend nothing happened.
To move on like it was all a dream.

My father even threatened my husband:
‚ÄúIf you touch her again, I swear‚Ä¶‚Äù
But those threats meant nothing.
They didn‚Äôt stop him.

And then I knew ‚Äî I had no support.
From anyone.
Anywhere.
I was completely alone.

But even in that silence, that loneliness ‚Äî I started building my strength.
Not in spite of it ‚Äî but because of everything I survived.

    I walked two miles that day,
    each step a pulse of hope,
    the road stretching like a promise
    I thought you‚Äôd keep.
    Your name was a quiet chant
    in the rhythm of my boots,
    the autumn air sharp,
    cutting through my jacket,
    but warm with the thought of you.
    
    I saw a car,
    sleek and silver,
    a twin to yours,
    parked silent by the curb.
    Empty.
    No shadow of you inside,
    no trace of your skyscraper frame
    leaning against the door,
    smiling that half-smile
    that always unraveled me.
    
    The caf√© was a refuge,
    its warmth a small betrayal.
    ‚ÄúSeen someone tall?‚Äù I asked,
    ‚ÄúLike a tower against the sky?‚Äù
    The owner shook her head,
    ‚ÄúNone since dawn.‚Äù
    I ordered coffee,
    black as my sinking heart,
    and sat by the window,
    watching the street for you.
    Two hours crept by,
    each tick of the clock
    a pebble in my chest.
    You didn‚Äôt come.
    
    I should‚Äôve called.
    Texted.
    Anything but trusted
    the weight of my wanting
    to extend friendship.
    I walked home,
    the miles heavier now,
    the air colder,
    my hope a crumpled thing
    left on the caf√© table.
    
    Later, I learned the truth
    you were there all along,
    hiding in that silver car,
    watching me search,
    watching me wait,
    watching me break.
    Your eyes, unseen,
    tracked my every step,
    but you stayed still,
    a shadow playing god,
    holding my heart
    in your silent hands.
    
    You tried to mend it,
    words spilling like rain,
    apologies pooling at my feet.
    But I was a storm,
    too raw to hear,
    silent for days,
    my hurt a wall too high.
    When I finally spoke,
    ready to bridge the gap,
    the mirror turned
    somehow, I was the flaw,
    my pain the problem,
    and those two miles
    became my fault.",1,1746550124.0,u_GabePushkin,0,1.0,False

1kg98ei,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kg98ei/why_is_the_rancilio_silvia_m_v6_espresso_machine/,Why is the Rancilio Silvia M V6 Espresso Machine a top-rated performer? Review,"The Rancilio Silvia M V6 espresso machine caught my attention due to its reputation as a professional yet home-friendly option for espresso lovers. Claiming a blend of robust design and superior functionality, this semi-automatic espresso machine has been in production for over two decades. After testing it extensively in my kitchen, I can confidently share its highlights and challenges.

**Aesthetic Appeal and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me about the Rancilio Silvia M V6 was its industrial yet sleek stainless-steel design. Its compact size, measuring 11"" in depth, 9.5"" wide, and 13.5"" in height, allowed it to fit neatly on my counter, proving ideal for smaller spaces. Its robust build quality gives off serious ""built like a tank"" vibes, lending confidence in its reliability and longevity. The polished steel exterior also blends seamlessly with various kitchen aesthetics, standing out as a centerpiece rather than an eyesore. However, while the machine is heavy-duty, I found its 35.1-pound weight tricky to move when rearranging my kitchen or cleaning underneath it.  

**Professional Espresso at Home**  
Equipped with a 12-ounce brass boiler, the machine was relatively quick to heat, though not lightning-fast. Admittedly, I needed to allow it about 15 minutes to achieve optimum brewing temperature. A 3-way solenoid feature deserves praise, as it effectively purges excess pressure, avoiding messy portafilter sneezes. Once heated, pulling a shot felt like I was stepping into the shoes of a barista at a professional caf√©. I even used the included tamper to perfect my grounds, resulting in rich shots with that coveted crema every espresso enthusiast dreams of.  

**Ready to buy Rancilio Silvia M V6? [Check its price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b084rt95lq/)**  

**Ease of Use and Learning Curve**  
Having only four simple buttons, operating this machine couldn‚Äôt be more straightforward. Temperature surfing‚Äîa quirky habit required with single-boiler machines‚Äîseemed intimidating at first but quickly became second nature after a few attempts. For someone entirely new to espresso, the initial learning curve might feel a tad steep, though once mastered, it becomes second nature. My coworker, who had never used an espresso machine before, successfully pulled a shot on their third try.  

**Highlights**  
- Compact yet durable design with a stainless-steel casing.  
- Produces flavorful espresso shots comparable to professional caf√©s.  
- Includes essential accessories like a wood-handle tamper and shot baskets.  

**Performance Pitfalls**  
While the espresso quality didn‚Äôt leave much to be desired, the machine's performance isn‚Äôt entirely flawless.  
- The warm-up time felt sluggish compared to higher-end options.  
- The drip tray is relatively small, requiring frequent emptying.  
- Producing multiple back-to-back espresso shots highlighted a slowdown in recovery time, which might frustrate couples or avid coffee hosts.  

**Target Audience: Is This Machine for You?**  
This machine speaks directly to espresso lovers craving high-quality shots without needing an industrial-sized setup. It‚Äôs best suited for daily coffee drinkers or enthusiasts who enjoy a morning ritual of preparing their own drinks. However, if you‚Äôre expecting rapid, one-touch brewing or require large volumes of coffee served quickly, you might consider alternatives.  

**Competing Brands**  
Speaking of alternatives, I compared the Rancilio Silvia M V6 to two notable competitors: the Gaggia Classic Pro and the Breville Barista Express. The Gaggia Classic Pro, known for its affordability, offers a similar single-boiler design but uses an aluminum boiler instead of brass‚Äîa concern for health-conscious users. The Breville Barista Express, on the other hand, impressed with its built-in grinder and intuitive interface. However, it sacrifices the same sturdy ""commercial feel"" and longevity found in the Silvia.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Priced on the higher side for home espresso makers, the Rancilio Silvia M V6 offers decent cost-efficiency when considering its durability and espresso quality. While not inexpensive, its reputation for lasting durability makes it a wise investment for enthusiasts planning to use it long-term. Over time, the cost-per-shot comes down significantly, especially compared to the price of specialty caf√© visits.

1kg974h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kg974h,Last-Minute Stand-In on Yankee Freedom III to Dry Tortugas (05/04 Solo Trip),"I did a last-minute solo trip to Dry Tortugas National Park on Sunday, 05/04, as a stand-in passenger on the Yankee Freedom III. I figured I'd share how it went in case anyone else is thinking about doing the same.

I arrived just before 5:00 AM after reading that people start lining up early ‚Äî and that was spot on. There were already folks there, and some who arrived around 5:30‚Äì5:40 AM were getting nervous about missing their chance.

The ferry staff showed up around 6:00 AM, and by 6:15 they put out a whiteboard for stand-ins to write their names. After that, it's up to you if you want to hang out near the dock or chill in your car. The group orientation starts at 7:20 AM and covers snorkeling, meals (breakfast/lunch), and general logistics.

Once everyone with a reservation boards ‚Äî around 7:45 AM ‚Äî they announce how many stand-ins are getting on. Even though it was a pretty busy Sunday, 8 of us were allowed on. So yes, it's possible to get lucky even with a big crowd.

Side note for locals: ask about the discount. A few people who live nearby got tickets for around $100, and it seemed like many weren‚Äôt aware of the deal.

Breakfast was basic ‚Äî bagels and coffee ‚Äî but the bagels went fast, so I‚Äôd recommend bringing some snacks or light food just in case. The ferry ride was really smooth that day, especially on the way back from the island.

At Dry Tortugas, they gave us sandwich lunches and plenty of time to explore. You can walk around Fort Jefferson, snorkel, hang out on the beach, and take a ton of great photos. It didn‚Äôt feel rushed at all.

Overall, it was totally worth the early wake-up and the gamble of going stand-in. If you‚Äôre on the fence, I‚Äôd say go for it ‚Äî just get there early and be prepared to wait a bit.",7,1746549727.0,NationalPark,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve scratched surfaces, spilled coffee, or nearly toppled an air fryer while attempting less-than-graceful maneuvers with heavy, clunky machines. That‚Äôs why I gave the **Aieve K5032 Appliance Sliders** a shot, and honestly, it feels like these little adhesive wonders may have just saved my sanity‚Äîand possibly my kitchen counters. Stick around‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt a fan letter, but more of an honest dive into their functionality, quirks, and whether it‚Äôs worth adding to your arsenal.

**The Design and Build Quality That Surprised Me**  
I expected something flimsy or too lightweight to handle the weight of my air fryer. Instead, the Appliance Sliders came crafted with PTFE (Teflon) material and a smooth textured surface that screamed durability. Installation was a breeze. With self-adhesive pads, I just peeled and stuck them underneath the appliances. It was oddly satisfying. The dimensions of 0.79 x 0.79 inches are discreet enough not to make my machines look awkwardly propped or uneven. Plus, they blend seamlessly into most countertop setups.  

Sure, you have to let it sit idle for 14 hours after sticking them (something my patience struggled with), but it gave good adhesion afterward‚Äîno slipping off or irritation.  

**Highlights**  
- DIY installation is straightforward and doesn‚Äôt require tools.  
- Smooth PTFE surface ensures easy gliding without scratches.  
- Compact and non-intrusive design doesn‚Äôt alter your kitchen‚Äôs aesthetic.  

**Convenience That Makes Everyday Tasks Easier**  
After using these sliders daily for a couple of weeks, I noticed just how much simpler life became in the kitchen. With a quick nudge, my bulky Ninja air fryer now glides effortlessly to and away from the wall. The sliders also keep it raised ever-so-slightly off the countertop, making cleaning spills and crumbs beneath it ridiculously simple.  

I also slapped a set of these under my heavy bread machine, which always seemed like a workout to reposition. Sure enough, it did the trick! Without dragging or screeching sounds, the bread maker slid quietly across the marble without leaving a single mark.  

**[Check Aieve K5032 Appliance Sliders price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b08flkf9sf/)**  

That said, these sliders can be a game changer if counter space feels cramped. Machines easily slide back when your countertop needs clearing and reclaiming. It‚Äôs like having an appliance runway for your kitchen gadgets.

**Boons**  
- Prevents countertop scratches, extending their lifespan.  
- Makes it easier to keep counters neat by moving bulky appliances.  
- Suitable for various surfaces like wood, tile, and marble.  

**Tweaks I Wish For ‚Äì Not Everything is Perfect, Though**  
While I appreciated how functional and multipurpose they are, let‚Äôs not pretend they‚Äôre flawless. First off, I realized that tall, narrow gadgets, like my coffee grinder, slid around a little too enthusiastically, compromising stability. It isn‚Äôt unsafe, but larger bases definitely benefit way more than smaller ones.  

Another minor gripe is that once these self-adhesive pads stick, it‚Äôs a silent commitment. Removing them later leaves behind residue that needs some elbow grease to clean up. Perhaps, a no-residue alternative for those of us who constantly rearrange the kitchen setup would have been better.

**Negatives**  
- Sturdier for wide-based appliances; less stable for narrower equipment.  
- Adhesive pads may leave behind residue upon removal.  

**How It Fares Against Peer Products**  
Appliance sliders aren‚Äôt entirely new; there are trays and mats that attempt to solve the same issue. However, the trays I‚Äôve used in the past usually crack under pressure or lose their glide over time. Sliding mats have great initial appeal, but their bulk makes them tedious in crowded kitchen setups.  

For the Aieve Sliders, the compact form makes them highly versatile. While mats are stuck to specific shapes and sizes, these sliders are more customizable. Alternatives often fail to work well across lighter surfaces, but this product adapts easily to tiles, marbles, and even wooden countertops without leaving streaks or noise.  

The only rival type that may edge these out would be non-stick appliance bases, but those are significantly pricier and restrictive in usage.

**Affordable Quality Worth Giving a Try**  
Cost always plays a role when deciding whether something small like sliders adds value or not. Reflecting on its daily performance in my kitchen, it‚Äôs hard to argue against its utility. These nifty little pads are like an extension of your appliances themselves‚Äîtransformative in their simplicity but worth the price for sheer ease of use.  

Unlike mats or trays that quickly show wear or need pricey replacements, this product feels more economical and durable for the long haul. Essentially, you save your counters, reduce effort, and keep devices in great shape without spending unnecessarily.

I met his family through FaceTime and the first time I saw them, his mother and sister were laughing.  Great start right?  I visited them last year and it seemed great at the start.  I did not know the language but I had some words to start with.  My fiancee would at the last minute tell me we are going somewhere and I would be have to be ready right at the time.  They would be ready to go and I would be just getting ready.  His sister, who does not know English, apparently,  would say let‚Äôs GO.   His mother brought up the topic that I need to lose weight.

In this time span, my fianc√©e did not teach me the language.  And I am to blame because I did not take the initiative to ask for lessons.  He works long hours so speaking for a little on the phone before he sleeps is important to me.

Before we went again, I see in his phone a bunch of photos of purses, shoes, shirts, perfumes, skin care etc.  I was like what is all of that?  He told me these are the things they want.  So we went to the 2 malls to get these things.  I thought to myself, are they happy to see him, or see what he will bring?  I am not used to this in my family, maybe because we are not close at all? 

We retuned again.  He had sent money home to have when we are there, and when we got there, he split it with her.  I‚Äôm like ok?   Apparently it was for things she paid for, but I seen where he is always sending them money.  She has a good job and lives at home.  

We travelled on a day trip all together (mother, father, sister, him and me) and it was not comfortable for me because the back seating is not comfortable for 3.  His sister had her legs crossed (yoga style) but at least she was comfortable with her circulation issues.  I had to literally lay on my side with the back of my head out the window for 3 hours.  This was a way for them to later say I am fat.  While he was driving, she wanted him to turn on the wifi, then the charger and then complain because the sun was on her. 

Another day we went for a drive, just me, him and his sister.  I went to sit in the back and he told me no.  I looked at his sister laughing and making this crazy signal with finger swirling on my head in a joking way like ok I will sit there.  So I sit there, and she said ‚Äòweird‚Äô.  I told him about this and he said no possible way can she say this because she doesn‚Äôt know English.  He told me he would ask his dog if this is what she said.  

He told me mother said we failed at 2 topics:  1) I did not learn the language and 2) I did not make ANY progress., even thought I had lost 20lbs in 2 months.  I tried.  When he told me this, I started crying because I already feel bad.  He told me his mother was right and there was nothing he could say to defend me.

The day we leave, I was in the room.  He was cleaning his car, so he told me to ask his mother if she needed help with anything and she said pack your bags.  They were packed but I went back to the room anyway.  I brought a bottle of water to the kitchen, and tried to stay with them and neither of them would speak of look at me.  

We went to breakfast one day, and they did not bring him juice or his coffee that he had ordered, but everyone had theirs.  I wanted him to have mine, but he said NO.  He would not eat until he had his coffee.  He would not take mine, but shared with his sister, bite for bite.  When the next plate of crepes came out, his sister shared his.  

In the middle of the trip there, they were speaking about her being there to see him (I don‚Äôt know the language but I understand some things).  I seen him highlighting days on the calendar and they were speaking about going to luxury brands when she is there (Chanel, LV, Gucci, etc) but I just thought they were thinking of dates.  When we got to the airport, they said they went to check on tickets, I was guessing they were going to buy it then.  When we returned back, I took his phone so I could airdrop photos from both of our phones.  And I see it.   He bought her ticket and did not tell me.  He told me he forgot, he does not forget these things.  

I feel like I am never going to have a place in his life.  They do things and laugh when he is not around, and they know I‚Äôm not understanding.  When we are together, they are always calling and texting him, but when he is there with them alone, he ignores me until everyone is asleep.  His sister is currently visiting him, and he will not speak to me until she is sleeping.  I don‚Äôt know what to do.  I feel I am losing my mind because he told me none of this happened and he will ask them.  But when I suggested I see a psychologist or therapist, he told me it happened and he will correct it going forward.

I‚Äôm currently learning the culture and religion.  Maybe I am missing something.  I‚Äôm praying for patience and understanding, but nothing is helping. 

What to do.  Have you been through something like this?

Hi! I‚Äôm looking for a language partner to practice Italian and English in person, here in Florence. The idea is to meet regularly (even just for a coffee or beer) and have casual, friendly conversations in both languages.

My English is pretty good, but I‚Äôd like to keep it active and improve my speaking. In exchange, I can help you with your Italian!

If you‚Äôre interested, feel free to send me a message. Hope to hear from you soon!

In the winter, I had a terrible concussion, and dealt with it by writing. I wrote the following creative nonfiction, and liked it a lot, and submitted it to a few places at my university. My professor really liked it, but I‚Äôm not sure about the rest of the reception. Please let me know what you think - how can I change it, rethink it before I submit it elsewhere? Thank you.

A guy named Waldo gave me my first concussion during a basketball game my freshman year. 
Waldo had long, flowing hair and wore a headband, a combo that is not typical to basketball swagger and provoked ruthless taunting from our bench ‚Äî ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Waldo? Where‚Äôs Waldo?‚Äù ‚Äî but the joke ended up being on me, because Waldo saw red on a loose ball and ran me down with his steel cranium like a fuckin‚Äô Ram 1500. 

I sustained my second concussion playing basketball, also ‚Äî on lunch break senior year, I drove to the hoop, and Henry Picaggli lost his balance and took a bite out of my head. 	

My third concussion, I stood up and hit my head on a truck door. My fourth, a taxi driver slammed the trunk door on my head as I was lifting my girlfriend‚Äôs bag into the street. 

And I got my fifth, and most recent, after engaging my friend Cole in a wrestling bout. Cole outweighs me by thirty pounds and subdued me handily and with great malice.  

My first concussion, I felt a little woozy and slept a lot and sat in the dark. The more I rack up, the worse they feel  ‚Äî the fifth, like someone stuck a funnel in my ear and poured a bag of sand into my skull, and the sand is slowly leaking out of my nose, and I can‚Äôt read or learn anything, or really think or feel until it finishes leaking.

It is a privilege, as anyone with depression knows, to think and feel. I want to feel everything, think through, wrestle and grapple. I want to see every shade and taste every acid; smell all the manure and hear all the car horns.

I‚Äôll wake up in the morning with a clearer head and push ‚Äî to focus on the dirt on my shoes, to feel the cold that makes my face so pink ‚Äî and I struggle. And lying in bed, my head spins, and I spiral. So I open my notebook and write:

Dragonfly dreams. Vanille fraise. Closing your eyes and feeling a song cover you. 

Sitting with her at the beach at dusk. Seeing the sand on her feet and her cover up flow behind her. 

Smoking a joint and taking a warm shower, and closing your eyes and sinking. A whistling guitar that makes you believe in God. Smiling in the mirror after a long day and seeing the tiredness in your eyes. 
 
February 18, 2025
Hearing a whistling guitar‚Ä¶tiredness under your eyes.

Seeing the smile lines on your mom‚Äôs face. Seeing your dad lift something heavy. Getting the flu and feeling weak and sinking into your bed. Breaking a fever. 

Sitting in a wooden sauna, overheating, feeling sweat pour out of every pore on your body, inhaling fluffy, thick air; running into the cold outside in your underwear, rolling in the snow, diving in the lake; shocking your nervous system, forgetting the warmth, gasping in the cold, feeling your blue body freeze over; running back into the sauna and thawing. Swearing, and seeing your dad frown. 
 
February 19, 2025
Cracking the top of a cr√®me br√ªl√©e with your spoon. Watching a nice French movie. Pouring milk in your coffee and seeing it swirl to the top, and seeing your coffee turn light brown. Squinting as you open your shades in the morning. 
 
Peeling a scab off. Soreness after you lift weights. Cutting your fingernail too short. Cutting yourself while shaving. Canker sores. Fuck. 

Finding a song you love in another language. Singing in that language alone in the car; refraining from singing it in front of other people so that you don‚Äôt ruin the song for them and ugly the language. Tall, and tan, and young and lovely‚Ä¶

Dragonfly dreams. Iridescent, darting and hovering and translucent. Drowsy summer afternoons watching dragonflies skim over the water. 

Feeling heartbreak as a kid, or thinking you‚Äôve felt heartbreak. Feeling real heartbreak, I imagine. 

Holding a postcard. Seeing someone asleep in the library. Shampooing your hair.

             climb into bed and feel her legs against yours. To get hot in the night and pull the covers off. 
	
To frown at a cynic. To meet a stranger. To hang a poster on your wall, and step back to look at the poster and the space it takes up. A beer. 
	
To get drunk with your younger brother, who is much cooler than you, hear his adventures, watch him mature. 
	
To try a new restaurant. Put the last ornament on the tree; drink eggnog and hear Sinatra. 
	
Successfully bargain for a cigarette for you and your friends outside a bar in Spain. Realize the man did not want to give you the cigarette but your friend, who flirted with him. 
	
To feel ugly, to watch your team lose, to see someone you love hurt. To fall, tell a bad joke, hurt someone‚Äôs feelings and feel it in your gut. 
	
To have panic attacks, pick at your fingernails, try to punch your crooked nose into place. Wish you were someone else. Apply chapstick. 

To tell people where you‚Äôre from. Hear back home in your voice. Have them ask how many guns you‚Äôve shot and horses you‚Äôve ridden. To indulge them and lean into it.

To look at a Mir√≥. Marca Hombre con pipa y Escargot, femme, fleur, √©toile como favorito y prom√©tete que lo volver√°s a ver. 

To look at a Sorolla, Picasso. To feel disappointed when you see your first Dal√≠, and have your disappointment compounded by your learning he was a fascist. To recall when you and your best friend began drinking in high school ‚Äî deleted a water bottle of vodka at a house party, passed out in the lawn in the front yard.

To write it all down, knowing you'll forget most of it. To forget most of it. To remember that you once wrote it down. To remember that you can remember.

To feel your skull and know there's a universe in there, fragile like an egg, endless like stars.

Face rub. Shaving cut.
Baggy pants on. 
Knee pop.
Back stretch. 
Fan whirl. 
Fan wind blowing tea bag.
Mug of empty tea on a messy desk. Brooklyn Dodgers cap. 

Walk to your desk. Pick up your lighter, flick it. Smell the green candle, and pick up the mug. 

Check your orange watch. Walk to the door, turn the knob. Grab your discolored backpack, step out into the morning, feel the world pressing in again‚Ä¶ 

Feel the sand finish its fall, finally, and never forget. Proof of life, crystals in the rock. A pearl in the shell, a soft center, a

The thing I‚Äôve always found strange about my GERD is it seems to come and go for seemingly no reason. I‚Äôve had periods between 2 to 6 weeks where my symptoms almost vanish and life feels amazing but then sure enough the GERD returns and hangs around for months.

I did a slight variation of the acid watchers diet, cutting out basically all triggers, I even managed to reduce my caffeine intake to one cup of tea a day in the morning. That‚Äôs pretty impressive for me. I used to have one cup of coffee and 3 to 4 cups of tea throughout the day. I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing wrong. And I feel completely lost in this thing.

As expensive as Denver is, Seattle is obviously more expensive. I can't see a way where my wife and I would be able to afford to live in Seattle even with a healthy income that we have. 

So which of these surrounding suburbs are most affordable for a two bed rental apartment and still have some sense of urbanization with retail and healthy / vegan grocery stores / coffee shops (although I imagine everywhere has coffee shops)

I would love to be in a place where you feel that cool Puget sound breeze but also realized that probably comes with a cost. Also would be great to be close to some sort of public transportation to take you into Seattle. Not against going as far as Everett but just curious if there is an affordable suburb that might meet my needs.

1kg8qv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kg8qv7/the_attic_is_breathing_again/,The attic is breathing again,"Most people outgrow their childhood fears. I think mine just grew smarter.

I live in Seattle, where the gray skies and a weird stillness in the air is typical. Each day drags on as the house feels too quiet and your skin itches with a reason you can‚Äôt name. I have been having trouble deciphering dreams from reality, so I decided to write out my feelings so I can explain to you what happened that day.

This is what I can remember.

A few days ago, my mom asked me to help look for old Christmas lights, which meant digging through the attic. A chore, right? But the second I pulled the ladder down and stepped onto the top rung, I felt it.

Warmth. Like sunshine on your face after a storm.

I climbed up, and it was like time folded in on itself.

The attic was glowing with dust speckled light. My childhood spilled across the floor in soft piles. Barbies with tangled hair, my pink lava lamp, old One Direction posters curling at the corners. I hadn‚Äôt been up here in years, but nothing had changed. Everything waited for me like I never left.

Then I noticed something new.

Four doors, lined up along the far wall. Shut tight.

I don‚Äôt remember them being there before. But I didn‚Äôt question it. I was too pulled in by the feeling. That floating, syrupy nostalgia. It wrapped around me like a lullaby.

I called down the ladder. ‚ÄúNathaniel! You‚Äôve got to see this!‚Äù

My little brother‚Äôs face appeared at the bottom of the hatch, scrunched with suspicion. ‚ÄúMom said not to go up there anymore.‚Äù

I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just the attic. C‚Äômon, I found our old toys.‚Äù

That got him. A moment later, he was climbing up, nervously glancing around like something might jump out. He walked over to the doors with me, sticking close.

‚ÄúWhich one do we open first?‚Äù I whispered.

‚ÄúNone,‚Äù he whispered back. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this.‚Äù

I reached for the second door from the left. It creaked open with a sigh. Inside was a room bursting with unopened presents. Towering stacks with glittery bows and shiny tags.

Each one had our names.

‚ÄúHoly crap,‚Äù I breathed. ‚ÄúThese are‚Ä¶ for us.‚Äù

I picked one up. It was heavy, solid. Real.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs open one,‚Äù I said, heart hammering.

Nathaniel shook his head violently. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt. What if it‚Äôs a trick?‚Äù

‚ÄúA trick? Mom and dad probably just forgot to give them to us?‚Äù I laughed.

Then we heard it.

A noise.

A low, wet, dragging sound. Like something pulling itself across the floorboards just beyond the next door.

He grabbed my hand, and suddenly, the warmth drained away.

‚ÄúRun,‚Äù he whispered.

We did.



Nathaniel hasn‚Äôt said a word since we ran down from the attic.

We sit on the living room floor, both of us wrapped in old blankets, staring at the ceiling like we‚Äôre waiting for the house to breathe again. It feels‚Ä¶ wrong. The air. The silence. Like the attic followed us down.

I break it first. ‚ÄúYou saw them, right? The presents. The room.‚Äù

He nods, barely.

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt imagining it. That noise‚Äî‚Äù

He cuts me off. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut Nathaniel‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI said don‚Äôt.‚Äù

His voice cracks in a way that shuts me up. I‚Äôve never seen him like this. He looks younger than usual, like a little kid, even at the age of seventeen. It pains me to see him like this, all curled up and pale. I‚Äôm his older sister after all, I should be protecting him. His eyes keep darting toward the hallway that leads to the attic hatch, like he‚Äôs scared it might open again on its own.

I get it. I feel it too.

But‚Ä¶ not the same way.

Because underneath all the fear, there‚Äôs something else. That warmth. That dreamy, glowing pull. It‚Äôs still there, buried in my chest, whispering. I wonder if Nathaniel felt it too.

Come back.

‚ÄúI want to go up again,‚Äù I say quietly.

He whips his head toward me. ‚ÄúAre you insane?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just need to know what‚Äôs up there. What‚Äôs behind the other doors.‚Äù

He looks at me like I‚Äôve already lost my mind. ‚ÄúDid you not hear that thing behind the wall? You don‚Äôt go back after that. That‚Äôs how people die in horror movies. Things already got weird enough.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt hurt us. It just‚Ä¶ made a noise.‚Äù

‚ÄúBro, listen to yourself. That‚Äôs the dumbest sentence I‚Äôve ever heard.‚Äù

I laugh, just a little. He doesn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something wrong up there. I felt it. Like‚Ä¶ like it knew we were there. Like it didn‚Äôt want us to leave.‚Äù

I freeze.

He‚Äôs right.

The moment we turned our backs, something shifted. Like the attic was holding its breath. Watching.

‚ÄúPromise me you won‚Äôt go back up,‚Äù Nathaniel says suddenly. ‚ÄúPlease. I mean it.‚Äù

I want to. I really do.

But I don‚Äôt.

That night, I lie awake for hours. The ceiling fan spins shadows across my walls. Every creak of the house makes my heart jump. Checking my phone, I see it‚Äôs nearly 2am and give up.

I throw on a hoodie and grab my flashlight, pocket knife, and the old wooden bat from my closet.

The floorboards groan beneath me, loud in the dark. I don‚Äôt even bother waking Nathaniel. I already know what he‚Äôd say. I pass his room and feel the guilt twist in my gut. But my need for the bliss of the attic is overwhelming.

The ladder unfolds with a soft click.

I climb.

And when I reach the top, it‚Äôs waiting.

Warm.

Blissful.

Alive.

The attic welcomes me back with open arms. 

Everything is still, the way it always was. Dust glows like glitter in the flashlight beam, and the scent of old wood and vanilla curls in the air like incense. It doesn‚Äôt even feel cold tonight. It‚Äôs like stepping into a memory that knows all the best parts of you and nothing else.

I don‚Äôt walk. I float.

I pass the door with the presents. It‚Äôs still shut tight, like we never opened it. Like it‚Äôs waiting to try again. I glance at the others.

My fingers hover over the doorknob on the far right.

It‚Äôs warm to the touch.

With a quiet breath, I twist it open.

The air inside smells like strawberry shampoo and the perfume I used to sneak from Mom‚Äôs bathroom. A soft pink glow pulses gently from the walls, like a nightlight behind fabric. Inside, the room is‚Ä¶

Me.

Not me now, little me.

My canopy bed is in the corner, made perfectly, with all my favorite stuffed animals in place. My rainbow CD player is sitting on the dresser, the Fearless by Taylor Swift disc glowing inside. My notebooks, my glitter pens, my sketchbooks filled with dreams of being an artist. They are all laid out, waiting for me.

And on the floor, cross-legged and smiling‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶is my doll.

Not just any doll.

Her name was Mary. My absolute favorite. I buried her in the backyard after my best-friend Landry and I cut all her hair off and she lost her arm. Mom said it was ‚Äútime to let her go.‚Äù But here she is‚Äîgood as new. Blinking at me. Smiling.

I don‚Äôt question it. I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs too perfect.

I step into the room, barefoot on soft carpet that somehow smells like birthday cake. I walk past the mirror I cracked in sixth grade‚Äîand it‚Äôs not cracked at all. I pass the beanbag chair I begged for on my tenth birthday.

I sit on the bed, and the princess sheets hug me.

That‚Äôs the only way to describe it. They mold around me like the bed itself knows me.

I could stay here forever.

And for a while, I think I might.

Until the music starts playing.

It‚Äôs soft at first. A lullaby.

One I‚Äôve surely never heard before, but it sounded all too familiar.

The CD player lights up and the music grows louder. Slower. Warped. Like someone stretching a record in the wrong direction.

The dolls head turns.

Her smile fades.

The lights flicker pink to red. Pink to red.

And then I hear it.

Behind the wall.

Thud.

Drag.

Thud.

Closer.

The walls begin to pulse like veins, the air thickening with heat. My flashlight flickers, the beam twisting and convulsing across the floor.

The door slams shut.

I leap off the bed, heart racing.

Something moves beneath the carpet. Like something inside the floor is crawling toward me.

I yank the door handle.

Locked. Of course. 

I slam my shoulder against it nearly three times until it bursts open and I fall backward onto the attic floor, gasping.

The music cuts.

The light disappears.

I stare at the door, panting.

It‚Äôs closed again.

Like nothing happened.

But on the floor in front of me‚Ä¶

Is Mary.

Her smile is back now.

And in her little plastic hand, she‚Äôs holding a picture.

It‚Äôs a photo of me.

Standing exactly where I am right now.




I don‚Äôt remember walking back to my room.

One minute I‚Äôm staring at the attic door, the doll at my feet. The next, I‚Äôm under the covers, fully clothed, flashlight still clutched in my hand.

My window is open.

I know I didn‚Äôt leave it that way.

For the rest of the night, I lie awake with the blanket pulled to my chin, listening for footsteps that never come. The doll is gone by morning. Like it never existed.

But the photo is still in my pocket.


At breakfast, Mom‚Äôs humming to herself. Making coffee. Like it‚Äôs any other morning.

I sit across from Nathaniel. His eyes are red and swollen.

He knows I went.

He doesn‚Äôt say a word.

I slide the photo under the table and pass it to him in a folded napkin. His hands tremble when he opens it. His eyes widen.

He swallows hard. ‚ÄúWhere did you‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúMy old doll gave it to me,‚Äù I whisper.

He pushes his plate away and stands. ‚ÄúWe need to tell Mom.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I say, panic spiking in my chest. ‚ÄúDad will freak. He already thinks‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúMom,‚Äù he interrupts. ‚ÄúNot Dad. She knows something.‚Äù

We find her in the laundry room, folding towels like everything isn‚Äôt falling apart.

‚ÄúMom,‚Äù I say, ‚ÄúCan I ask you something?‚Äù

She looks up. Sees our faces.

Freezes.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù she asks, towel half-folded in her hands.

‚ÄúI went back,‚Äù I admit. ‚ÄúInto the attic.‚Äù

Her face drains of color. Her hands start shaking. The towel falls to the floor.

‚ÄúWhich room?‚Äù she whispers.

‚ÄúThe door to the right . It had my old stuff. And my doll Mary, she gave me this.‚Äù

I hand her the photo.

She barely glances at it before she closes her eyes and rubs her temples. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs happening again.‚Äù

Nathaniel and I look at each other.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, again?‚Äù I ask.

She doesn‚Äôt answer right away. Just slowly sits down on the washer like her legs gave out.

‚ÄúI was your age when I found it. The attic. It looked different back then, smaller. But it was still‚Ä¶ wrong. It remembers things. Brings them back. But not right. Not how they‚Äôre supposed to be.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you ever tell us?‚Äù Nathaniel asks.

‚ÄúBecause I sealed it. I locked every door. I thought it was over.‚Äù She looks at me now. ‚ÄúBut you opened one. That‚Äôs all it takes. It wants you now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut it only shows itself to certain people. I think it feeds on memory. On longing. The more you feel, the more it has to show you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd if I keep going back?‚Äù

She looks me dead in the eyes.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôll learn you, and keep getting stronger.‚Äù

That night, I hear something scratch at my door.

Not loud. Just soft. Rhythmic.

I press my ear to the wood.

A whisper floats through.

‚ÄúCome back.‚Äù

I told myself I wouldn‚Äôt go back.

I told myself it wasn‚Äôt safe.

But the photo won‚Äôt stop burning in my pocket. The attic‚Äôs pull isn‚Äôt warm anymore, it‚Äôs hungry. I feel it in my dreams. In my bones.

And still, I go.

It‚Äôs just nearly 2:00 a.m. again when I slide quietly out of bed, flashlight and bat in hand. The house is so still it hums. Nathaniel‚Äôs door is cracked open, and for a moment, I hesitate.

He knows.

He always does.

But he doesn‚Äôt stop me.

I make my way to the attic and climb the ladder in silence.

This time, the attic is different.

Colder. Taller. The ceiling feels farther away, like the space has grown. Yet it still invites me in.

The doors are all shut but one.

The second door on the left.

The one with the black handle.

It was brass before.

I step inside.

The room is a maze of mirrors.

Tall, antique ones. Some full-length, others cracked, with frames eaten away by time. They‚Äôre placed like a forest. No walls, no windows. Just reflections. My flashlight flickers as I pass through them, and every surface ripples slightly before going still.

At first, the mirrors show me.

Just me.

Then they don‚Äôt.

One by one, the reflections shift.

In one, I see myself smiling. Dressed in a birthday outfit I never owned.
In another, I‚Äôm crying, nose bleeding, bruised, alone.
And in the last one I stop at‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not alone at all.

There‚Äôs someone behind me. Someone I recognize immediately.

I whip around.

Nothing.

But in the mirror, the figure is still there. Standing in the shadows.

I raise my flashlight and take a step forward.

The reflection doesn‚Äôt move with me.

I stumble back and crash into something solid.

I scream.

‚ÄúHey, hey it‚Äôs me! It‚Äôs just me!‚Äù

Nathaniel.

My knees nearly give out.

‚ÄúWhat the hell, Nathaniel?!‚Äù

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt let you come back alone,‚Äù he says, breathless. ‚ÄúI knew you‚Äôd try again.‚Äù

‚ÄúI told you to stay‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt tell me anything!‚Äù he snaps, eyes wide. ‚ÄúYou were gonna go up here and get yourself killed.‚Äù

I want to yell. I want to scream. But the room won‚Äôt let me.

It‚Äôs too quiet.

Too still.

I look back at the mirror with the shadow figure.

It‚Äôs gone.

‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs wrong with this place,‚Äù Nathaniel whispers. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bigger than before.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

He grabs my wrist. ‚ÄúWe need to go.‚Äù

But when we turn back, the door is gone.

Just mirror after mirror after mirror.

I spin, disoriented. ‚ÄúIt was right here!‚Äù

The reflections begin to pulse.

The air gets thick, syrupy. Our breath fogs. And in the mirrors, we see things that aren‚Äôt us anymore.

Not memories.

Possibilities.

I see Nathaniel falling, screaming. I see myself clawing at the walls. I see the doll dragging itself behind me, smiling.

A low hissing noise starts, echoing in every direction.

Nathaniel tightens his grip on my arm. ‚ÄúWe have to move.‚Äù

We push through the maze, shoulder-checking mirrors, searching for the one that shows the real us. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll know, but I will.

Behind us, footsteps start.

But not like walking.

Like scraping.

Long nails against glass.

Nathaniel turns pale. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs following us.‚Äù

I glance over my shoulder.

One of the mirrors shatters.

Something is crawling out.

I grab Nathaniel‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúRUN!‚Äù

We sprint through the maze, dodging shards and cracking frames. The thing behind us is close, I can feel it breathing.

Then, 

We find a mirror that doesn‚Äôt ripple.

It‚Äôs solid. Whole.

And it shows us, ONLY us.

‚ÄúJump,‚Äù I say.

Nathaniel looks at me like I‚Äôm crazy. ‚ÄúWhat!?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust do it!‚Äù

I slam my bat into the glass.

Sure enough, we fall through.

We land hard on the attic floor, gasping, trembling. The door slams shut behind us and vanishes like smoke.

Nathaniel lies beside me, hands over his ears.

I crawl to him and shake him gently.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I whisper. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry I brought you.‚Äù

He doesn‚Äôt say anything for a long time.

Then, finally he gets out, ‚ÄúThat thing wasn‚Äôt trying to scare us.‚Äù

I look at him, confused.

‚ÄúIt was trying to replace us.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

Today is a blur.

The kind of day where everything feels like static. Like a scratched vinyl skipping in the same place over and over.

Dad makes pancakes like it‚Äôs a normal Saturday. He even hums while he flips them. The radio‚Äôs playing old music from the ‚Äô80s, cheerful and sunny. The syrup bottle is sticky. The butter melts too fast.

My mind keeps replaying the images of the attic 

The mirrors.
The room that disappeared.
The thing that followed us to the edge of forgetting.

Nathaniel doesn‚Äôt come down to eat. I watch the door to his room. Listen for footsteps. Nothing. Usually I wouldn‚Äôt worry, he usually hides in his room for hours at a time. But today is different.

When I finally look up from my plate, Mom is staring at me.

Her eyes are red-rimmed. She opens her mouth to say something, but quickly closes it and walks away.

Like she‚Äôs scared of what she might remember if she speaks.


I spend the afternoon cleaning my room, which is code for rearranging things and trying to convince myself I‚Äôm controlling the narrative.

I move the bookshelf. I vacuum behind my dresser. I organize old books and pretend I still read them often.

But the whole time, I‚Äôm thinking about the mirrors.

The warped reflections.

The door that didn‚Äôt open.

And Nathaniel‚Äôs face,how pale he looked when we crashed through that last mirror. Like something inside him didn‚Äôt make it out.


It‚Äôs after dinner when I finally knock.

His room is dark except for the pink salt lamp on his nightstand.

‚ÄúNathaniel?‚Äù

Silence.

I try again. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just me.‚Äù

After a beat, he mutters, ‚ÄúCome in‚Äù

I step inside slowly.

He‚Äôs sitting on the floor, knees up, hoodie on, hood pulled over his head. The old walkie-talkie we used to play with as kids is clutched in his hands.

He presses the button. Lets go.
Presses it again. Lets go.
Like he‚Äôs waiting for someone or something to answer back.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I say quietly, easing down next to him. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt used those in forever.‚Äù

He shrugs. ‚ÄúFound it in my closet. Still works.‚Äù

I glance at the second walkie, sitting on his nightstand. I reach for it and click the button. Static. But it comforts me.

‚ÄúWhat are you listening for?‚Äù I ask.

He doesn‚Äôt answer at first.

Then: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Maybe a version of me that didn‚Äôt go up there.‚Äù

I bite the inside of my cheek. Ouch.

‚ÄúI keep thinking about your jewlery box,‚Äù he says suddenly. ‚ÄúThe pink one. With the ballerina.‚Äù

I tilt my head. ‚ÄúI kinda remember that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI saw it. In the mirror. Yesterday.‚Äù

I go still.

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt broken. It was perfect. Spinning. Playing music.‚Äù

He finally turns to look at me, and his eyes are glassy. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt think it was my memory. I think it was‚Ä¶ the attics.‚Äù

We sit in silence. What does that mean?

Outside, the wind moves through the trees like it‚Äôs whispering something in a language we used to know.

Eli leans his head back against the wall. ‚ÄúDo you think we were supposed to find that room?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I admit.

‚ÄúBecause sometimes it felt like it was trying to scare us. And other times‚Ä¶‚Äù He pauses. ‚ÄúIt felt like it was showing us something.‚Äù

I nod slowly. ‚ÄúYeah. Like we were being tested.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr invited,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúTo stay.‚Äù

That word hangs heavy in the room.

Stay. I take a deep breath.

He looks down at the walkie-talkie. His thumb brushes the side of it.

‚ÄúWhen we were little,‚Äù he says softly, ‚Äúyou used to talk to me through these every night before bed.‚Äù

‚ÄúI remember,‚Äù I whisper, surprised.

‚ÄúYou told me stories. About dragons. About secret tunnels under our backyard.‚Äù

He smiles faintly. ‚ÄúI think part of me still believes you.‚Äù

My chest aches.

‚ÄúI told you those stories to make you feel safe,‚Äù I say.

He looks at me. ‚ÄúAnd now you‚Äôre the one who doesn‚Äôt feel safe.‚Äù

I shake my head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel real.‚Äù

We sit like that for a while.

Not saying anything.

Just two kids who went up into the dark and came back a little less than before.

Eventually, I leave the second walkie-talkie with him and go to bed.

But I don‚Äôt sleep.

I lie there staring at the ceiling, clutching the photograph from the attic.

It used to be frozen, me standing in front of a door, backlit by soft, yellow light.

But now?

In the photo, the door behind me is open.

Just a crack.

As with all programmable mosfets regardless of whether it's Kestrel, Gate, or Perun, please note it drains batteries fairly quickly. Around 450\~500 rounds in, you will have to plug in a new battery. Tested with HRG 11.1v 1100mAh LiPo.

Additionally, for some reason selector on full auto doesn't seem to register. Either the selector plate is misaligned or the Kestrel isn't intended for an MP5 shell. Regardless, I don't think this is a major issue since majority of fields enforce semi only anyway. You can program the SMG to shoot burst, binary, or full auto on the semi option if needed. I will also include the original packaging for the Kestrel upon selling.

Shooting video will be provided upon request.

1kg8nd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/romance/comments/1kg8nd6/im_falling_in_love_with_a_man_older_then_my_dad/,"I'm falling in love with a man older then my dad (very long, I'm sorry)","So I'm a young woman. I'm an adult, but barely. I've had very few sexual experiences in my life, and none of them were good. I'm kinda traumatised by it. My face isn't ugly and neither is my body, but the way I style my hair, and what kinda cloths I wear, make people think I'm a lesbian, and most men don't find the way I present myself attractive. I don't feel very feminine. I think I'm actually non-binary, but I don't need or want that label. I'm very, very, very straight. I love men. Especially, or actually only older men. My first sexual experience was when I was 18, when I had a short fwb situation with a 37 year old man. The other guy I've had sex with was 34. The youngest person I've ever been attracted to, was 11 years older then me. Before you ask, I have a great relationship with my dad. No daddy issues, so I don't know where this preference comes from. 

I'm a singer at the beginning of my career. A few months ago, I had an interview for a big newspaper. That was very exiting. I was gonna be on the front page with my photo, with the number of the page my interview was at. The newspaper's photographer called me and we made an appointment to take the photos. He sounded nice on the phone. When I met him, I was kinda blown away. It was a man my dad's age. Really tanned skin with a few freckles, bright green eyes, black hair, altho most of it had turned gray. He had a really sweet smile. He wasn't tall but I really like shorter guys. We met at the exact place we wanted to do the shoot, but when he saw me, he asked if I wanted to have a drink with him first. He showed me he had been listening to my music on his phone on the way there. He said he wanted to get to know me better. So we went to a coffeshop and he bought me a coffee. He was really sweet and really charming and we talked for like an hour. He told me about his old job, about his children, about his study. He also shared some really heavy, private trauma with me, within the first 15 minutes of us meeting. That was a bit weird, but he used his experience and trauma in his photography, that's why he brought it up. At the coffee place, he already started to take photos of me, while telling me how photogenetic I was. I barely get any compliments from men, so I loved that. It made me blush. He made comments like ""what would everyone think an old men like me is doing here with such a young girl"". I do realise that this sounds creepy, but I think he was tryna joke. He showed me photos he'd taken of other women. He seemed very obsessed with women. All the women he showed me he found ""really beautiful"". It's weird but that made me feel a little jealous. However, he was also very interested in my album cover and the photo I'd used. My friend made it. It looks like I'm naked in the picture. I'm not, but you can see my bare shoulders and collarbones. He said it was beautiful and that I had really good collarbones.

After the coffee we started shooting. He was full of compliments about my looks, my poses, how I looked in the camera. Some people came up to us and asked me what we were doing and if I was a model. Again, no one ever asks me stuff like that. I wanted to say no, but the photographer told everyone that I was in fact a model, and a singer and that they should listen to my music, that I was going to be in the newspaper and that I was gonna be famous one day. We took photos for hours. Sometimes he replaced my hand, or the position of my head, and it made me feel butterflies in my stomach. He also smelled really good. I wasn't sure if it was a perfume or just him. One picture he made, made him almost cry instantly. He told me to come and look. He zoomed in on my face and told me how beautiful the look in my eyes was. It was indeed a very nice photo. He emediatly called some people from the newspaper to tell them he had made ""THE picture"". Photoshoot done, you would think, but he told me he had to go to another woman to take her pictures, but that he would come back afterwards. That he would come to my house and take some pictures of me there too. We walked back to our bikes. It was cold outside and I had been posing for ours, for most part without my coat on. I shivered a little and he said ""o, love, are you cold?"" 
He started rubbing me warm. I don't know how to describe it; I was SO attracted to him, altho he was older then my dad, and I was younger then his children. And for the first time in my life I was sure someone was attracted to me too. 

When I got home I called my two friends and told them everything. They emediatly hated him and told me there was no need for him to come to my house. But I wanted him to come to my house. I live together with my sister and her girlfriend, but they were gone for the day. I live in the apartment above my parents, and they were home. The photographer came back and took more pictures and we talked some more and drank some tea. He asked if he could meet my parents, cause ""what might they think, me hanging out with such an old man"". I opened the door to go downstairs to ask my parents, but before I left, I said: ""you don't wanna know what I usually do with older men.""
I winked, and hurried downstairs. I'd NEVER said something like that before. I'm usually very shy when it comes to this kinda stuff, but something told me that it was safe. That he liked me too. My mom was just heading out, so I came back upstairs alone. He asked me ""what was that you said about what you usually do with old men?"" 
He had a smirk on his face. I was too shy to repeat it. When we were done shooting, we went downstairs to my dad and talked some more with the three of us. Before he went home, he hugged me and told me I could get the pictures for free. I didn't get his smell out of my sweater for days and I didn't mind it at all. 

He texted me some time after that he wanted to come to my next concert. We had some back and forth about who would buy the ticket, but I won, and bought it for him. Before the concert, there was a film, where I had been involved in. After the film, I had to walk past everyone to answer some questions. When I walked past the photographer, he stroke my arm and smiled at me. He absolutely loved the concert and afterwards we started chatting, but my dad and his friend joined the conversation. That was annoying, but I moved closer to him in a subtle way, until we stood arm to arm. One time I ""accidentally"" stroke his hand. Afterwards, my drummer, who fancied the photographer as well, told me how she saw our chemistry and that she was kinda jealous. 

The photographer and I kept in contact over the phone, but it became less and less. I was scared that maybe he had found a new girlfriend and didn't want to hang out anymore. I'd promised him that when the cd's would come, he'd get one. He was very exited at the time, but when I texted him to tell him that they were here and I could bring him one, he said he didn't have a cd-player, so he didn't need one. It seemed like he had scared himself. Like he had thought about what he had been doing, and he didn't like it. I thought I'd probably never see him again. He switched from WhatsApp to signal and he left the country for a month. But then, one day, when he was back in the country, he texted me. His profile picture on WhatsApp was back. He asked me if I still had a cd for him. I asked him if he had gotten a cd-player. He said no but that he wanted one anyway, with my autograph on it. I asked him the adres. Usually I just put cd's through the mailbox, but he texted me ""don't mind the mess; I'm renovating.""
When I got there, he seemed nervous and said ""let me put on some other pants. Let's go for a drink.""
He took of his pants and put on others. We went to a cafee and talked for two ours. He told me he had a boat and asked me if I wanted my logo on it and if I wanted to go on the boat with him some time. I said yes. While talking, he sometimes looked at me and said out of nowhere: ""Oh, man, I'm gonna photograph you another time.""  
I told him I would have a concert the next day. He emediatly checked if he could make it. He had to work, but said he would come if he would be on time. 

We went back to his house and he showed me some pictures he took of a naked woman he had photographed many times. I gave him the cd and he thanked me many times, persisting on paying, but I refused. He hugged me and I went home.

The next day, my concert started without him. It was outside and free, in occasion of a national holiday. During the first song, I saw him on his bike. We smiled at eachother. He got a chair and sat totally in the front. He took pictures of me while performing. After the concert, he was the only person I talked to. We touched each other's arms many times and complimented each other about everything. My dad came joining the conversation, and the photographer took some physical distance from me. He told me the last song made him cry. That song is a new song and it isn't on Spotify yet. He asked me if I could record it and put it on there. I'm gonna. He also talked about the boat thing again, now involving my dad. He showed me some pictures that he made of me and said we would make proper ones soon. When my violinist walked by, he mumbled: ""I'm gonna photograph her as well. She's really photo genetic.""
That made me jealous. He talked about his trauma to my dad aswell and then casually switched the conversation. ""I didn't want to brag with my boat and stuff,"" he said. ""I just wanted to ask about the logo. That boat is from my business man days. I'm not rich anymore, and I don't wanna brag with that kinda stuff. I'm just (his name).""
""No, you're not JUST (his name),"" I responded. 
He squeezed my arm. I looked him in the eye and said: ""I'm so sorry, about everything you've been through.""
He smiled. ""I know,"" he said. 
When he left he hugged me tight. 

I know it sounds ridiculous, but I'm falling in love with a man older then my dad. I don't know what I want, but I definitely want him in my life. I know he might come off creepy, but he's genuinely a good man and I really like him. He's actually sweet to me. I don't know what I wanna accomplish by writing this. Maybe it's more for myself. If somebody actually read this till the end, please don't be mean about him in the comments. He hasn't done anything wrong. I'm not asking if I should do it or not. If I'm asking anything, it's how I could do it. Like, does anyone have tips about seducing an older man, and letting him know that it's okay?",1,1746548396.0,romance,3,1.0,False
