For years now I've had random daydreams about being a woman. Like, just doing everyday things like going to work or going to a coffee shop and stuff. Just imagining looking in the mirror and seeing a cute face and long hair and smiling and thinking how happy I am. Or just going to a bar and just dancing the night away in a nice dress and hugging my friends and telling them how happy I am now. I'd imagine going into work in a pantsuit and just being awesome. I know it's stupid and probably just me wishing for some kind of escape, but I imagine in these moments that all my past concerns and the constant feeling that something's fundamentally wrong that I just can't put my finger on have gone away. Something that's stopping me from being complete and living my life, despite having no concerns at all in my life. Maybe that's the issue, I have no real concerns, I've 'made it', so I'm inventing problems.

I imagine scenarios like some freak occurrence randomly turning people into women, and I'm just an unfortunate casualty of the disaster, forced to 'deal with my bad luck' and people being shocked at how easily I accept it all and asking if I'm happy with what happened. I'd immediately say 'Yes! I'm so much happier! I never want to go back!' or trying to coyly play it down by making it seem like I'm just very well-adapted to it. I even daydream about being pregnant and having a baby and being a mother with a husband (strange, because I like women).

I had a dream last night, can't really remember most of the details, but I know I was a woman (kind of? I kept worrying about things like if my chest was too small and masculine or people could tell my voice was deep and feeling like I was 'faking it'). I was with a group of people throughout the whole dream. I was talking about software or IT or something with the one guy in the group and was trying to show off a bit / be really competent, but was worrying if that would clue him in a bit on my past (which in the dream was kind of undefined, but I knew what my skills were, just they didn't align with my current self). At the end, I was becoming quite friendly with one of the girls, and she asked me as to sing  with her and I was a bit worried about my voice. Then the other girl kind of subtly signalled me to the side and said not to worry about my voice. I feigned ignorance asking what she meant and she said that she thinks she and I had a lot in common. When I asked what she meant, she said 'I'm trans.' Alarm bells kind of went off at the time - I didn't want to seem shocked or anything or offend her so I played it down with something like 'Oh cool!' and tried to change the subject. Then my phone went off and woke me up, and I tried to go back to sleep after to see how it would end, but I couldn't get back to sleep :(

Bit of a ramble, but do you think any of this means anything?

_______________________________________________________

For YEARS we’ve been get(ing) requests to update our top ten gaming babes. A much celebrated and well remembered article first published WAAaaAAay back in issue 12, in the far off year of 2000 (Erm, yeah right!? In all seriousness we digress). That article is a particularly smexy but mostly nostalgic one as we’ve re-printed  it eight separate times over the years. Elevin times if u count the occasionals in which we mistakenly printed them 2wice in the same issue, resulting in the coveted three 53 page issues, which stand WAAaaAAay out from our usual 52 pagers (Again, we the editors are profusely sorry that we messed those up and ended up adding an extra page, we haven’t a clue how that happened, but it will never happen again, we promise.),. 

So why not for old times shale hononr our classic list by updating it with the NEXT top 10 hottest after the first 10, or are these babes the actual TOP 10 HOTTEST and the snooks from the old list are now the ones that are the ones that are the top 20-11, let yourself be the judge and please write in with your opinions on the matter. 

Without further ado, let’s jam into this piece.

Thjroughout the world over the many years sex symbolism has been a constant aspect of film, radio, and commercials. From Ruth Malcomson to Armi Kuusela people have enjoyed to see a spec of the old feminine wilds. And in 1958 with the creation of the game Tennis For Two the gaming industry was changed forever when it was created. Along with the first example of sex appeal in gaming. Look, we all know that there’s nothing hotter than two women competing in tennis, so what better place to start than tenbus tenbus tennis,.

Games just kept getting hotter and hotter until the culmination of all that tenmis had started with Lara Croft, and the best is history, as Mrs. Pac Man was created soon after, followed by Inky Blinky and Clyde, but we don’t mean that the ghosts are attractive, we make a little joke because the ghosts are always following the pac family in their many adventures. So there you have it, boobies DO exist in the gamesphere of perception.

We know all that sexy DOES become video games, despite potent protests from properly prolapsed perpetrators. This is just our cleverly alliterative way of saying that folks who think gaming doesn’t have sex sppeal are just plain out of the loop. Or should we say, out of their minds being loopy!

And just to prove it we have OUR own list that features the top ten bathing beauties in the history of pixels, polygons, and CTRs. Hold on to your hats gentlemen and gentlemen, or else you’re jaw will drop so hard the vibration from it hitting the floor will rattle you causing your previously established hat to fall right off!

Final Thoughts:
Wow, that’s a hot lineup. Hopefully this heaping helping of curvaceous curveys and binging bonging jiggle psychics has whet your appetites, am I right fellas? So if your friend from accounting ever talks to you as if games don’t have pretty women in them you call roll up this magazine issue and give them a superb whack on the noggin, or even just simply knock over their coffee from their desk, and tell them that Sexy DOES video games. So please, send mail to our inbox in Wexford, Ireland and write in with your thoughts on the new list.

But don’t take our word for it (but do) because all over the world there’s world famous celebrities who agree. Even Lady Gaga most likely loves gaming.

1kh75jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepParalysisStories/comments/1kh75jf/cold_room_warm_embrace/,"Cold Room, Warm Embrace","⸻


I had a cherry latte from Starbucks last night, so I knew going into sleep that I’d have some caffeine coursing through my veins.
It was gonna be rough. So I decided to take some melatonin. I had a glass of water and did some breathing exercises before falling asleep.

For those of you who don’t know, I’m not great with caffeine—if I have coffee past noon, I’m usually up until about 4 AM.
Pretty crazy for a 43-year-old to still not have this regulated, but here I am, doing box breathing to counteract the bean water.
I had it too late in the day. That one’s on me.

Once I settled into sleep, the next thing I knew, my brain was waking me up—and I felt well rested.
I reached out to find my wife and wrapped my arms around her. It was a tight, warm embrace—one of those half-asleep but cozy moments.

As my senses started to come online, I began to hear things in the background.
My ears tuned in to the sound of the shower running. From a distance, I heard my wife’s voice, playfully talking to the cats, who had apparently decided to mess with the water.

“No chompies,” she said, as Sniffles had clearly infiltrated the shower and was taking playful, lunging bites at the falling water.

As my still-groggy brain tried to process this wake-up, a chill came over me.
My breath quickened. What had been a cool room suddenly felt hot—because whatever I was holding onto in bed wasn’t my wife.

I’ve never felt so cold and so hot at the same time.

The shower in the other room felt a mile away.
The bedroom turned cold and silent.

I bring up the temperature multiple times here because—if you know, you know—it was something unlike anything I’ve ever felt before.
The only sound I could hear was the beads of sweat hitting my chest, dripping from my face—still pressed against the forehead of whoever (or whatever) I thought was my wife.

It was still.
But then, it moved.

That hot-and-cold forehead remained against mine, but I began to hear movement—something slithering.

Then, a thud.

My eyes snapped open.

In that moment, the thing that had been pressed against me slinked off the bed like a snake unraveling.

I was staring into eyes—eyes that were supposed to be my wife’s—but they weren’t.
The smile was there, but it wasn’t hers.
It was the kind of polite smile strangers give each other while passing on a hiking trail—just a slight dimple, nothing warm.

The slinking, snake-like thing, still facing me, fell to the floor.
I lay there in bed, paralyzed with fear, trying to make sense of what was happening—trying to figure out how to get out of this.

I shut my eyes.
That usually made it go away when I was a kid.
It’s worked before. Surely it would work now.

I opened my eyes again, more lucid this time.

Wow. What a weird dream.
Everything seemed so real.
The room was exactly as I had left it—the temperature, the sweat, the sound…

As I started to regain clarity, I realized I still heard something coming from the other room.
But then I also realized—it wasn’t the shower I had heard.

It was the bathroom fan.

There was no shower.
And Sarah isn’t even home—she’s working a 24-hour shift.

Also… where were the cats during all of this?
Aren’t they supposed to be like little demon protectors?

I wiped the sweat off my brow and tugged at my now completely soaked T-shirt.
“It was a dream,” I said out loud. Whether I believed it or not was unimportant.

As my eyes lifted from the fabric, I spotted the kitties.
Pickles was crouched down in attack mode.
Sniffles was full Halloween cat.

Both of them were side-by-side, locked together and staring.
Something had woken them up too—and it was on the other side of the bed.

All these years, all the work, all the therapy to make this go away…
And it was back.

I knew, before my water filled eyes even got there—
it was back.",1,1746648428.0,SleepParalysisStories,0,1.0,False

He gets straight A’s, plays sports and music, and he doesn’t swear, smoke, vape, drink, get into any trouble and overall he’s a good Christian boy. He is 18 and graduating high school in less than a month. Then going to college this fall.

##HOWEVER!! 

He has repeatedly shown me and his mother nothing but disrespect as far as him helping out around the house. That ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY means him cleaning up after his self. Like last night he spilled a container full of coffee in the pantry all over the floor & other other stuff. Instead of cleaning it up, he shut the door & turned out the light and acted like it wasn’t his fault. He acts like he can’t hear us all the time and walks away while we’re talking to him. When we try to show him affection, he recoils like he’s disgusted or like he’s been abused. He has NEVER been struck! EVER!! We barely raise our voice at him.

*All we ever do is try to make our kids happy, even if it’s at our own expense. And we are fine with that. I taught my kids that life is too short for them to not choose to be happy, even if it means I’m not.* 

_BUT_ he expects me to be his chauffeur when he can’t be bothered to get his license or find a car. He expects us to take him to the store every time he wants a different snack, like we have nothing going on. I’m not saying we give i to his demands. (We don’t, and we let him know it’s because of his lack of respect and the way he treats us) But we still do a lot for him and any time he’s sweet and nice we give him everything he wants. I already take him to school every day and he rides the bus home. I love doing stuff for my kids and I don’t want them to have to do anything unnecessary in life because I grew up doing everything all the time against my will and I resented my parents for it.  

##So AITAH because I told him this morning that I will not be responsible for him going to work or for finding a way to/from work. I refuse to be taken advantage of by someone who refuses to show the respect I have given and deserve in return. Or do I just let this go because despite the way he treats me, I know he’s a good person who doesn’t treat anyone else this way. 

###Maybe I did do something wrong that he won’t tell me about and that’s his way of retaliating. Or is this the result of gentle parenting? Which I doubt because we raised him the exact same way as we did his sister and her behavior towards us is almost the polar opposite of him. (She’s 16 and a straight A student too who is the same way he is with all those misbehaviors that most kids do/have; she doesn’t) So what’s the deal?",1,1746648254.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

I'll try to keep it as concise as possible. I was employed by a fast casual coffee company (franchised) for about 9 months. In this time, I was in a leadership position (above regular employees but below management). My manager asked in what ways they could help me to improve as a leader, and, trusting this manager, I confided in them that I was likely on the spectrum but not diagnosed, then explained some things related to this that would help me improve (lists, concrete instructions, being direct when correcting my performance, etc). After sharing this information with my manager, my manager began to treat me differently by holding me to a higher, harsher standard than others in the same or higher positions than me, and only had issues regarding certain problems if it was my mistake. I recognize that I asked for direct correction to my performance, but the issues in question were only made in vague, 'passive aggressive' comments to the leadership group chat that myself and others on leadership positions were in, and only ever occurred after my mistakes. (The manager themselves also would make some of these mistakes without any issues.) In other words, I began to be treated differently after sharing my possible neurodivergent behavior.

I discussed with my manager on what exactly I was doing wrong or how I can be better, and was given vague responses. Two different employee evaluations (one for the entire employed staff in January, and one for just leadership in late March/early April) were started but neither were completed for me. I instead went to speak to the owner of the store in early March (above the manager in the chain) about issues I was facing with the manager and the treatment after sharing that information with them. The owner assured me they would talk to the manager about the vagueness of their feedback and told me not to worry. On May 1st, I was terminated from employment. The termination came from nowhere, after only one write-up which was voided by the owner (due to it being vague), and was done within the middle of a work week -- I still had a week and a half's worth of shifts left to work that schedule. I asked my manager what the reason for my termination was, and the manager said ""a few people have said a few things this week"" and because of things that I had said ""about her"" and about her management. When I asked for more specificity, she didn't say anything else, and just repeated the same vague things.

My question is, do I have any legal chance here for wrongful termination, either from the change in treatment after I confided my neurodivergence or from lack of specificity on the reason for employment? I know MO is an at-will state, so the latter may be harder to lean into, but nothing that I did or said while employed went against the company's handbook. In terms of what I'd want, I don't want my job back -- I'd prefer the manager was demoted or fired & possibly money for emotional damages.

1kh6vvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/PointlessStories/comments/1kh6vvn/a_guy_sat_down_next_to_me_in_an_empty_library/,A guy sat down next to me in an empty library,"Yep, it was eight in the morning, and I was busy trying to work on an essay. I had my little coffee. I had my earbuds in. For some reason, I was playing a Lo-fi version of the Doom soundtrack. It was like Rip & Tear but with the a little Lo-fi beat over it.  

That floor is almost empty because it's a college library at 8 am, and I hiked up to the sixth floor. I hear footsteps coming toward me, which isn't unusual because there's an office next to my study spot. What is unusual is the sound of the plastic chair right next to mine getting pulled away from the desk. Whoever it is has the entire library to themself, and they chose the seat directly next to mine?

I stop typing and I pause my music. Out of the corner of my eye, I see some guy. He looks clean enough, so he isn't one of the homeless people that pop in sometimes, and he's also just looking straight ahead. Weird, but whatever. He didn't hit on me or try to get me to join a Bible study, so we're at peace for now. 

I keep my earbuds in without playing any music (they're wired and bright green, so they're pretty conspicuous), and grab a random lip gloss from my bag so I can get a better look at him. Yep, he's just wearing jeans and a t shirt. I don't see an ID lanyard or any school merch, so I can't tell if he's another student or not. Also, he doesn't even have a backpack. 

I continue staring at my laptop and start typing random shit. He still hasn't said anything, and I'm still pretending to be super dedicated to my essay, but I'm quietly planning my escape. So far, he hasn't done anything weird, but it's probably a good idea to have a backup plan. Since it's kind of early, people are regularly walking in and out of the offices. I can just walk up to a random person and pretend to know them. 

I kind of want to just grab all of my stuff and fuck off to a different building entirely, but I'm worried he'll switch up if I move. What if he's like a T-Rex that only locks onto people in motion? I don't know what this guy is capable of, or what T-Rex's are capable of. Also, I've lowered my screen brightness so I can watch what he's doing through the reflection on my screen. Yeah, I'm insane. 

He's still looking straight ahead. At what? I have no clue. The dude has no laptop, no backpack, and no phone out. That is, until he fishes his phone out of his pocket. I'm really hoping he'll just start playing TikToks out loud or something. That way I would know he's just a regular amount of inconsiderate. But nope, he looks down. He aims the phone down, but it's angled at me, and I hear his fucking camera go off. 

I still don't know what to do. Do I ask him what that was about? Should I risk it and leave? Should I like call my mom? I do not have time to do any of those things, because he turns me to me and goes, ""Excuse me? I'm so sorry, but I have a question.""

I don't really want to know what his question is, but I take my earbuds out and say, ""What's up?"" Anyway. 

He just apologizes again, ""This is going to come off weird, but if someone was staring at your shoes, would that make you uncomfortable?""

I don't know how to respond or what to do. I don't know why I decided to just sit here instead of doing anything else. I do know that that these are my favorite shoes though. They're genuine leather clogs. The soles are made of wood and nails. I thrifted them for twenty bucks last year, and I just got around to conditioning them so they're kind of shiny. 

I shrug. ""Depends?""

He puts his phone back in his pocket. ""Well, I was staring at your shoes.""

I forget how words work for a second, but I figure it out eventually. ""I mean, they're cool shoes.""

I am seriously considering abandoning all of my stuff and just asking the office to let me in, but then the guy gets up and walks away. He just dropped whatever that conversation was one me, and he had the audacity to walk away casually. He got a picture of my shoes, and I got a new emotion that I don't know what to do with. Yes, I am deeply uncomfortable, but not in the normal way. When guys eye me like something on the butcher's counter, I know what to with that. I just get annoyed and go on with my life, but this? I have no clue. There is no resolution, and there is no motivation. I just have to sit there and try to finish my essay (spoiler: I did not). ",4,1746647800.0,PointlessStories,1,1.0,False

SO reddit it is.

Hey, F, idk if you'll ever read this, and if you do, hopefully you won't know it's me, and if you actually do know, then I'm glad you are finally getting to know this, because I've been wanting to TELL you this for as long as I can remember but never actually had the courage to.

I met you when I was 12, back in 2017, I was obviously young and knew nothing about love other than Disney movies and daydreaming about one day getting married and getting to reach the point of the so called ""happily ever after"". You were 14 at the time we met, we went to the same english school together though we were in separate classes, I have absolutely no memories on how we actually became friends, but I know that right after that, you showed me the love I always dreamed of, and there are moments I genuinely will never ever forget about us that you probably has already forgotten since for you it probably didn't even matter.

It is stupid silly, but you were the very first boy to ever show me a romantic affection even though we never actually even dated. You were my very first long warm comforting romantic hug I felt, and I would give everything to feel the way I felt in your arms again, and I would never ever let it go this time, and oh I so much regret when you were going to hug me like that (not knowing it would be for the last time) and I somewhat refused because I was stuck in my own stupid world in my mind thinking you didnt like me when it was so obvious that you did like, and really, really liked me. I would give everything to go back to that moment and just jump into your arms.

I remember silly moments of us listening to music together, even though it was cringe 2017 anime and Rick and Morty songs. I also remember when I had terrible period cramps for the very first time in my life and I sat in a corner thinking you weren't going to see me or even care to look for me but you actually did care, and you paid very close attention to every small spot in the room even though it was full of people, and when you saw me you made a silly pose like you always did, resting your arms on your waist and slightly bending your knees while turning your head sideways with such a goofy smile. You came walking towards me and immediately gave me a hug and I knew what home felt like when it wasn't a house.

I remember when it was my 13th birthday, my mom took me to one of the best restaurants of the country, it was in our city and happened to be very close to the english course we used to go, and I couldn't stop thinking about how I was going to be late for """"""class"""""", all because I wanted to see you, my mom was so mad because I kept insisting I wanted to go to """"class"""" while she wanted me to just skip since my grades were good and enjoy my day with the family, but all I wanted to do was see you. And when I got to the school, we bumped into each other like a super cliche movie moment and I almost melted when I was speaking with my friend about it, especially because she saw it happening and she too adored it.

I remember when every single time, my friend would make sure to say out loud how cute we were together and how much she shipped us and adored us, and how you would smile and somewhat blush, and for whatever reason, I still thought you didnt like me.

I remember when you held my hand for the very first time in the car while my mom gave you a ride back to your place, it was warm, and soft, and I was so happy you did that. I kept insisting to give you more rides so we could do that more often, but you were always busy afterwards so it never happened. And once I finally managed to, you didn't hold my hand, and I felt my heart hurting a little bit and wondering what I had done wrong.

I remember when you kissed me for the very first time, we were texting about kissing each other for weeks and weeks but we never did it, I was too scared since it was my first kiss. When I had the chance to initiate it, I immediately gave up, but then you went ahead and leaned over to kiss me, it was quick, not even a second long, but it meant the whole world to me and I'm so happy you were my first kiss.

I remember when my cat died, and how all I could think about was how much I wanted to see you even though I did not go to the same english school as you anymore, but even so, I still went there, just so I could get some comfort from my favorite boy, and I was so right to go there, because you managed to make me smile when I was slowly diving into a bit of a depression in my life.

I remember, when you went to my place for the first time and how awkward it was because of how terrible my family is regarding boys, we had to stay downstairs in the living room where we had absolutely nothing to do, it was weird, but we still managed to just talk and use our phones to show each other memes and songs. You even showed me a love song actually- and yet, I still thought you didn't like me.

I even remember your ""love you too"" texts- yet, still the same thought, of course you didn't like me.

Then, not long later, 2018, I moved away.

We slowly stopped talking

You were never good at texting

And I thought you never cared.

We both lived our lives individually, but never actually stopped thinking about one another.

There are so many memories that I keep in my heart, and I still don't understand how I thought you never liked me. I only found out you did when YOU told me that you used to like me, on my 16th birthday, when you and I already had our own partners at the time, and I broke down crying because of how stupid and dense I was. How did I not realize that? HOW? I'm 20 now, and sometimes I still cry because of this thought. The thought of ""what we could have been"" haunts me.

Sigh.

So many things happened after that. I messed up And it would take me thousands and thousands of paragraphs to explain, so I won't do that.

Don’t even get me started when I first saw a little boy at my after school care job that looked just like you, the memories immediately flooded my mind and I held myself back from crying
I couldn’t stop looking away from him, and no im not a creep, I was not in love with him, I just found it crazy and scary how someone could look and BEHAVE just like you- I missed you.

I almost quit my job because of it…

Anyways-

Then there we were, 3 years later after all that event happened, that I had messed up, it was now 2024, I went back to the city, like I do every year, and I saw you again, we went to a cafe together to catch up on our lives. You looked different, and you sounded different, and yet you were somehow still the same, and gosh I was so happy to see you again after so long, all I wanted to do was jump into your arms, but I knew that if I did, you wouldn't have caught me. We were not close friends anymore, to be honest, not even truly friends, we were just two strangers who used to know one another, and yet you still gave me a chance to meet again for a sip of coffee (even though neither of us drink coffee but the phrase sounds nice)

We talked, and we laughed, and I listened to stuff about your career even though I still don't really get it, but gosh you looked absolutely beautiful talking about what you love and know. It was enchanting. You were enchanting.

After that day, I got desperate.

I kept thinking about you 24/7, I was not going to stay in the city forever, only 2 months, I was desperate to see you again.

I kept trying to talk to you and invite you to do things and to go to places so many times, but you would be either busy, or tired, or sometimes you just forgot, and gosh that hurt.

Then, I did it. We went to the movies together. I was so nervous. I wore the outfit I bought and I looked so cute for you, I did my nails even though one of them was hurting at the time. I also was trying my so very best not to actually throw up because of my anxiety, and I was just praying that I was going to be able to at least hug you again, to feel that warm comforting hug for maybe the very last time, and feel like home the way I kept in my heart and mind for years. Well... I... did hug you, but it wasn't the same. We hugged, but you were not my F anymore, you were really just someone that used to like me in the past, but you moved on, and I didn't, I stayed in the past. At least you did let me hold your arm throughout the whole movie, and even rested your head on mine while I was resting mine on your shoulder.

When it was time to go, I gave you a goodbye kiss, thanking you for the night we had, but praying deep down that we would see each other again even though I only had 2 days left in the city.

And we did! You went to my place the very next day, and we played on the switch the whole day with my cousins, and then we watched flooded away together. You had things to do at a certain time, but you still stayed with me for longer than you could, and when it was time for you to leave, I was trying my very best to not cry, hoping you wouldn't notice, but you did. Your uber came, I opened the door for you, and you, after 7 long years, leaned over to kiss me again. A goodbye kiss.

After that, I left my heart with you, in that city, and came back to where I now live. heartbroken but so grateful to have had the chance to see you again after so long, I was afraid it would be for the very last time. So, I was forced to make myself another heart, one that hadn't you all over it.

I cried for months after that though, I was grieving so much, grieving for a person who was still alive, and it was terrible. And I guess I am still somewhat grieving a bit, but now, everything is different.

We became friends again, close friends! We now send tiktoks to each other every single day, we usually go on calls on discord together with the group, you sometimes send me songs you like and playlists you make too, and you even wondered when I'll be going back to the city again, which makes me so happy, I'm so thankful you actually do think about me now throughout your day.

No, we never dated.

No, we will never date. And to be honest? I'm kinda happy we did not, because we wouldn't have lasted due to life circumstances, but we would have been a one heck of a couple if I hadnt moved again, and if you had actually TOLD ME you liked me and asked me to be your girlfriend. Maybe it was not entirely my fault afteral.

Yes, I love you, F, I'll forever love you.

And when I tell you that I love you, I now truly don't mean it romantically anymore.

I love you as a person, and I couldn't be more proud of who you became.

I love you for how much you changed my life, because if it wasn't because of you, I wouldn't be on the discord call with this specific group of people right as I write this.

I love you for the wonderful memories we made together, because you were the person that made me realize that the love I always dreamed of was not a fairytale thing, it could actually happen irl. And after 20 long years, it happened! Not with you, but with an adorable ""knight"" I have met that now is the one I see myself with in the future and couldn't be more excited to actually see how life will turn out with him.

I love you, F, I'm not yours, and I'll never be. But I hope you know that the 12 year old me was. She loved and will forever love you, I hope you won't forget about her. And I especially hope that the 14 year old you won't forget about her, because the 14 year old you is the boy she actually loves.

I love you, I'm sorry I was too dense.

I love you, I'm sorry I messed up in the past.

I love you, I'm sorry I won't ever have the courage to tell you all of this irl.

I love you, thank you for actually giving me another chance in our friendship and actually accepting me to a point we are close friends again.

I love you, Friend, and I hope that you also wonder what we could have been.",1,1746647679.0,letters,1,1.0,False

We met on the heels of him having been broken up with his first long term girlfriend, and he confessed having had issues with coke after the breakup as a means to cope. He promised he was clean and that it wouldn’t be an issue. I was cautious but appreciated his honesty and was sympathetic with the reasoning. Our relationship moved quite fast, him moving in with me within a month since we started dating and getting engaged 3 months later. He treated me very well and was everything I wanted in a partner. He was driven, attentive, planned spontaneous trips, would surprise me at work with a coffee or a treat. 

Things started taking a bit of a nosedive early in the relationship, which in hindsight were red flags I shouldn’t have ignored. He got extremely drunk several times for various reasons. He quit his job suddenly. He would spend every last dollar we had gambling with the promise that he could make it back. Even the day before we got married, he gambled away thousands of dollars. He was drunk while saying our vows. He got extremely drunk on a cruise while in Mexico, leaving me to have to escort us both back in a foreign country. He would lie about going out to see a friend and would be back in an hour, only to go somewhere else and be gone for hours on end using MDMA. 

This all went on for a few years, until one night after a particularly bad argument in which he got drunk and slammed a bottle of whiskey on the floor in front of me, I walked out of the house and started making an exit plan without him knowing. I was pretty checked out of the relationship at that point and planned on leaving as soon as I got my finances in order and could afford to do so. However I guess that was finally a wakeup call for him, and he started controlling his drinking. This was around 2021. 

He got into psychedelics and weed to try to help his mental health. I was against it but he ultimately did it and seemed to help. We both eventually enjoyed using shrooms together, and it seemed like a safe enough thing that he wouldn’t abuse. The experimentation continued with other psychedelics like LSD, and he wanted to try ketamine. This is where the continuation of the problem happens.

He was no longer abusing alcohol, drinking sparingly and not getting drunk or angry anymore. However he started using ketamine more and more. It got to a point last year where he would use 1g a day. I got tired of repeating to him to quit using it and started checking out of the relationship again, not with an exit plan necessarily but more so like apathy. This kept building up over 2024 to the point i was just kind of going through the motions. He promised for 2025 he would stop (and he has).

However 2025 has brought upon it more issues with alcohol, such as him forcing me to switch seats with him during a police stop as he had a couple of drinks, making me feel like he was willing to throw me under the bus to save his own ass, as well as him driving home extremely drunk one night on his own after he had promised he would only drink on vacation. 

All of these issues have just made me checked out of the relationship. We’ve only had sex like twice this year, because I don’t feel comfortable being physically intimate with him. Which then causes a whole other litany of issues because he feels like his needs aren’t being met, and then we argue some more. We had a 36 hour argument a few weeks ago (minus sleep time). I’m honestly exhausted of the constant back and forth. 

He understands it will take time to rebuild things back. He is supposedly committed to not drinking anymore. He understands he has done a lot of damage and fears it is irreversible. I honestly don’t know if it is. I find myself trying to be normal in our interactions, but he is just gloomy, feeling sorry for himself, and that just annoys me more. Like you’re going to do all this shit for years and then have the audacity to feel sorry for YOURSELF? 

Anyway if you read this far thank you. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to rebuild this connection back? I don’t particularly WANT a divorce, although I can’t lie and say I haven’t contemplated on what my life would be life if we did get one. I do enjoy the life we built together outside of all of these addiction nonsense, and the time we spent on our relationship when he was in line was a good time. But I cannot be attracted to this man that feels sorry for himself all the time considering he is the one that did all this damage, and it seems like he won’t stop feeling sorry for himself until I become more physically connected to him again.

1kh6mnq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kh6mnq,"JOSÉ VILLEGAS CORDERO - SIESTA, 1874","The painting depicts an Orientalist scene set in a corner of the Alhambra Palace, highlighting Spain’s Moorish heritage. A warrior, surrounded by luxurious accoutrements, lounges in a mafraj (a resting area) beneath a canopy of pampas grass. He smokes a pipe, with a coffee pot and an incense burner releasing scent nearby, while a flintlock pistol and a bejeweled kindjal dagger rest near him. A young woman serenades him with a mandolin, adding to the languid, dreamy atmosphere.

José Villegas Cordero’s time in Rome during the 1860s and 1870s profoundly shaped his artwork, including Siesta (1874). Living in Rome, a hub for artists and intellectuals, exposed him to a cosmopolitan art scene where he encountered the Orientalist movement, which romanticized Middle Eastern and North African cultures. This influence is evident in this painting's exotic setting and meticulous depiction of Moorish-inspired details, blending Spain’s Islamic heritage with contemporary fascination for the “Orient.”

Cordero’s relationship with Mariano Fortuny was key in his career, profoundly influencing his artistic style and professional trajectory. Fortuny, a celebrated Spanish artist known for his preciocismo—a highly detailed, vibrant technique—was a mentor and inspiration to Villegas during his time in Rome. Villegas, who had studied under Fortuny’s brother-in-law, Federico de Madrazo, was drawn to Fortuny’s mastery of light, color, and textures, which became hallmarks of Villegas’ own work, notably here.

The Prado Museum played a significant role in José Villegas Cordero’s artistic development, serving as a source of inspiration and technical grounding. The Prado also represented the pinnacle of Spanish artistic achievement, fueling Villegas’ ambition to contribute to this legacy. His later appointment as director of the Prado Museum (1901–1918) highlights the institution’s enduring significance in his career, as he transitioned from student to steward of its heritage.",10,1746647162.0,ArtConnoisseur,0,1.0,False

The '*More Top Secret Recipes*' book by Todd Wilbur from 1994 has a recipe for **Bailey's Original Irish Cream**.

About 16% ABV.  The recipe is simple to make, just blend:

* 1 cup light cream (or substitute 1/2 milk c. and 1/2 c. heavy whipping cream. NOT bottled half and half, that has half the fat of light cream).
* 14 oz can sweetened condensed milk
* 1-2/3 cups Irish whiskey
* 1 tsp instant coffee (too much in my opinion)
* 1 Tbsp chocolate syrup
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 tsp almond extract (his updated version of this removes the almond extract)

Here's the thing, my old 10th edition of '*Better Homes and Gardens: New Cook Book*' from 1989 has a recipe for **Chocolate-Cream Liqueur**.  I don't know if it's also in  their older version of their cookbook.  
It's NOT as easy to make and it involves cooking and tempering an egg yolk.  About 11% ABV:

* 2 cups light cream
* 14 oz can sweetened condensed milk
* 1 cup Irish whiskey
* 1/3 cup rum
* 2 tsp instant coffee
* 2 Tbsp chocolate syrup
* 1 Tbsp vanilla extract
* 1 beaten egg yolk

Both recipe instructions mention container with a tight lid, shake before using and that it will keep for 2 months.  
Sounds worth trying though.

The Maestri House MHCB-02 Cold Brew Coffee Maker sports a sleek, modern design that complements any kitchen decor. Its black color and minimalist aesthetic make it an attractive addition to my countertop. The dimensions, measuring 6.29 x 3.58 x 9.17 inches, allow it to fit snugly in my limited kitchen space without feeling intrusive. Additionally, the durable BPA-free Tritan material used is recyclable and shatter-resistant, which is a huge plus for someone like me, who’s prone to knocking things over. The compact and space-saving structure feels thoughtful, especially because it still manages to offer a generous 41oz capacity, making it perfect for those cozy weekend gatherings with friends.  

**Effortless Cold Brew Ratios**  
I found the customizable ratio system of this cold brew coffee maker to be incredibly thoughtful. The etched scales on its body made it simple for me to experiment with coffee concentrations. For instance, with 120g of coffee grounds, I could achieve a richer flavor; scaling back to 80g produced a milder brew. This easy-to-follow system allowed me to tailor my cold brews to personal taste or craft something different when hosting guests. My Saturday coffee experimenting vibes have genuinely been elevated with this pitcher.  

[Check Maestri House MHCB-02 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0ddkgdcdy/)  

**Superior Filtration System**  
The filtration system on this product is impressive. Unlike my previous coffee makers, the 350-mesh ultra-fine filter ensures no coffee residue sneaks its way into my cup, delivering an undeniably smooth brew every time. What truly grabbed my attention was the leak-proof design, which keeps the brewing process entirely clean and sealed while preserving the fresh, authentic cold brew flavor I cherish. For someone who dislikes cleaning stubborn leaks, this feature feels like a lifesaver—especially in a busy morning rush scenario.  

**User-Friendly Convenience**  
The design considers small yet impactful details that enhance the user experience. The removable bottom cover on the filter makes cleaning effortless compared to those all-in-one filters that trap grime in hard-to-reach spots. I also appreciated the top cover on the powder compartment—no more flying coffee grounds during brewing! The added filter placement at the spout minimizes spills, which, trust me, has saved me from a few near-catastrophic coffee-on-shirt situations during quick pours.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Sleek, compact design with a generous capacity of 41oz.  
- Durable, BPA-free, and recyclable Tritan material for long-term use.  
- Precise coffee brewing ratios for fully customized flavor tuning.  
- Enhanced filtration with zero leakage, ensuring clean and smooth cold brew.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Evaluating its price-to-quality ratio, I found that the product stands out among competitors in its category. While it’s slightly pricier than some simpler models, the thoughtful design, customizable ratios, and advanced filtration features justify the investment for any serious coffee lover. I'd say it hits a sweet spot between affordability and high-end functionality, offering great overall value for the features it brings.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The Tritan material, while durable, does tend to show scratches over time with heavy use.  
- Cleaning the intricate mesh in the filter occasionally requires a bit more effort.  
- Its compact size, while space-saving, may not suffice for larger households or events.  

**Peer Products**  
In comparing this cold brew machine with competitors like the OXO Compact Cold Brew Coffee Maker and the Takeya Deluxe Cold Brew Maker, some stark advantages stood out. Both alternatives are solid options, but they lack the thoughtful design aspects unique to the Maestri House model, such as precise ratio indicators and a truly spill-proof filter system. While Takeya's model is praised for its simplicity, it doesn’t offer customizable coffee ratios, a selling point I found invaluable. The OXO model comes close with high-quality materials but doesn’t match the Maestri House MHCB-02 in terms of user convenience and capacity versatility. Overall, this machine balances form and function better in my day-to-day needs.

- Karambulak Village for 2 nights (via kk tours) 
- Kolsai and Kaindy Lake
- Charyn Canyons
- Alma-Arasan

My vehicle had less than 1/4 tank of gas. The gas station attendant was 'unable' to add fuel to the tank and told me that there must be a blockage. I paid a little over $4.00 for the wasted gas that spilled from the nozzle, and returned home. I inserted a large diameter piece of vinyl tubing from the gas cap into the bottom of the tank, at least 3 feet, without any problem or encountering an obstruction. I then drove to a different gas station and didn't have an issue gassing up. My brother-in-law, who is also a good friend (this is not a significant part of my story, but I thought you might like it) dropped in for a coffee this morning. I began my story and he interjected ""Was this the gas station on old Westminster Hwy?"" He had the same problem last year, when he tried to gas up his motorcycle. He told me that none of the pumps closest to the road are functional & he wasted 45 minutes. He said that only the second row of pumps work. I'm reporting this to you folks in case the station is cheating people, or someone takes their vehicle to a shop to check for an obstruction.           ",0,1746646253.0,vancouver,11,0.44,False

 \- Throwaway aus Gründen, ich fürchte aber, wer das zufällig findet wird mich mit den Informationen erkennen..

Ich hatte schon lange überlegt mich einmal auszulassen und den anonymen Rat des weiten Internets zu suchen. Nun stehe ich vielleicht an einem fundamentalen Entscheidungspunkt und lasse es mal aus mir herausbrechen. **Danke schon jetzt für's lesen**, Das wird bestimmt lang und an manchen Stellen ermüdend, gibt aber vielleicht einigen der Jüngeren hier auch einen interessanten Einblick in eine Branche, nach der durchaus ab und zu gefragt wird. **Danke auch an jeden, der/die mir einen Tipp gibt - und wenn es nur ein subjektiver Gedanke oder Hinweis ist.** Versuche etwas zu unterteilen.



**Pre-Story/Bisherige Karriere:**

Zurückgeblickt auf's Studium würde ich mich gar nicht als wirklich ambitioniert betrachten. Ich komme aus einem ""guten unteren Mittelstand"", es fehlte an nichts. Meine Mutter hat spät in der Karriere eine interessante Niesche in der Medizin gefunden. Geschäftspolitisch nicht alles richtig gemacht, aber selbst wenn man nicht immer alles für sich herausholt, bleibt etwas hängen wenn es läuft. So war ich durchaus ehrgeizig aber nie verbissen. Man lernt aber die schöneren Dinge schätzen. Nie habe ich mit dem Auto von Mama oder Papa angegeben, aber ein gewisser Stolz schwingt natürlich schon mit, in einem neuen Coupe vorfahren zu können statt in einem alten Familienvan.

Im BWL-Bachelor war ich im Ausland - London City Boy im Blick ging es vor nun fast 15 Jahren viel um Finanzmarkt, Investment Banking. Das waren die großen Ziele. Die Branche habe ich kennengelernt, habe das aber schnell als ziemlichen Schwachsinn für mich abgetan. Ich wollte fachlich gefordert werden und nicht nur Zeit abschrubben. Auch ein Exkurs in die Unternehmensberatung war .. dieselbe Erfahrung. Was kann ich nach Wochen, Monaten, Jahren in der Branche? Außerdem war ich früher etwas eingekehrter, kein Verkäufer-Typ, aber auch kein Denker-Nerd. 

Zu Beginn des Masters bin ich dann in die ""Big4"" gerutscht. Damals kam man gerade aus der Zeit in der nur 1er-Absolventen genommen wurden in die Phase, wo so viel Wachstum da war, dass jeder trottel einen Platz bekommen hat, der auf dem ""ersten Arbeitsmarkt"" nicht erfolgreich war. Reflektiert habe ich das natürlich erst später. Aber gut. Mir wurde das schmackhaft geredet und ich bin direkt vom Praktikum in die Werkstudententätigkeit.

Ich hatte immer was für Autos übrig und im Gegensatz zu der ""Sitz-im-Büro-und-bastel-Powerpoint"" war man direkt bei den Kunden vor Ort. Das war ein Deep-Dive in People Business, fachliche Fragestellungen und natürlich auch in die Welt der Reisespesen. Warum erwähne ich diesen Punkt? Heute 4 Tage vor Ort zu sein, 100 km jeden Tag zu fahren, ist inzwischen undenkbar. Für mich hat es damals aber bei einem relativ günstigen Auto gute 1100 EUR Netto (!) mehr bedeutet. Auf ein Grundgehalt das nicht super hoch war, aber auch nicht marktunüblich niedrig. Zuzüglich gab's noch Überstunden, die man sich für Berufexamen praktisch ""er-fahren"" konnte. Das war ein sauberer Deal. Während Brutto+Bonus ca. 52-60 in den ersten Jahren drin waren, war es über diese Benefits hochskaliert eher 75 TEUR. Das ist für einen Berufseinstieg und mit 1-2-3 Jahren doch ordentlich!

Recht schnell hatte ich die Zeiten für ein Berufsexamen zusammen. Wie man das in der Branche eben so macht, habe ich mich für das StB-Examen angemeldet. Mein Credo: Rein oder raus. Ich bestehe oder ich wechsle den Job. Ach: ich war eigentlich in der Wirtschaftsprüfung, aber als Baustein und für das Versorgungswerk ist/war das durchaus spannend. Inzwischen hatte ich ""blut geleckt"". Die fachliche Tätigkeit lag mir und ich hab mich in sämtliche Methoden und Fachgrundlagen so eingebissen, dass ich mir einen Namen über das Büro hinweg gemacht habe. Später auch Schulungen in den Bereichen gehalten habe - als ""Professional"", wo eigentlich erst ab ""Manager""-Level soetwas üblich war. 

Nur bezüglich der Benefits war ich immer etwas kritisch und habe meine gute Position auch zu erstreiten gewusst. Jeder wusste, dass man mit mir nicht gut auf einem Projekt auskommen wird, wenn der Bonus im Vergleich zur Peer-Group mies wird. Das macht nicht beliebt, aber finanziell bin ich immer gut weggekommen. Irgendwann dann kam das zweite Berufsexamen - Wirtschaftsprüfer. Auch das habe ich im ersten Anlauf bestanden. Neues Versorgungswerk, Beförderung zum ""Manager"". In der Phase noch mit voller Überstundenvergütung (!) und einer Tantieme. Ganz offen - Fix 70, Tantieme ca. 20-25, Überstunden aber auch 25 TEUR, teils etwas mehr. Und das mit noch keinen 30 Jahren. 

Letztlich ging und geht es dann irgendwann um einen ""Business Case"", man braucht Fürsprecher und steht eben hier oder da. Durch meine querulante Art habe ich es immer geschafft den Moment zu maximieren. Aber weil ich eben nicht der Ja-Sager war der sich oft von Obrigkeiten gewünscht wird war mir irgendwann klar, dass die Karriere beim aktuellen Arbeitgeber irgendwann vorbei ist und ich mich quasi nur über Stunden und Engagement steigern kann.

Also: Was tun? Wechsel in der Branche oder raus?

Wen man sich mal ein Berufsexamen angetan hat, hängt man auch dran. Ich gebe auf den Titel nichts, wenn damit nur Schmerzen verbunden sind (siehe später). Aber die Mühe muss sich doch gelohnt haben. 

Letztlich habe ich mich für einen Wechsel in der Branche entschieden. Ich bin gut vernetzt, nicht nur in meiner Stadt sondern praktisch dem ganzen ""Norden"" der Szene. Der Wechsel fiel mir relativ leicht. Ich bin wieder innerhalb der Big4 nun auf eine Führungsebene gestoßen, die sehr viel von mir hält. 

Finanziell war es durch eine abweichende Überstundenregelung aber zunächst sogar ein Rückschritt. Mir wurde aber auch versprochen, dass die Arbeitsbelastung nicht ganz so hoch sei.

Über nun 3 Jahre habe ich die Position deutlich gefestigt und bin, im Gegensatz zu ""vorher"" eher oben als unten auf der Skala. Der nächste Karriereschritt steht in der Planung und ist mir, ohne arrogant vorweggreifen zu wollen, eigentlich sicher. Man arrangiert hierfür die strategischen Themen mit mir.

**Um mal einen Punkt zu machen...**

..stehe ich eben genau an dem Punkt. Es wurde nun ein Business-Case definiert, der auch klappen wird. Der aber ""on-Top"" bedeutet.. zusätzlich zu den bisherigen Tätigkeiten. Der Ausblick sieht vor, dort nun reinzuwachsen und die Beförderung ab 2026 in neuer Rolle anzugehen. Leider is damit ein ""Sommerprojekt"" verbunden, das mich vielleicht meine 4 Wochen im August haben lässt, aber neben anderen schwierigen Projekten auch im Sommer (weiterhin) eine 50-60h Woche bedeutet.

**Was ist denn so stressig?**

Bevor ich es vergesse, ein vielleicht ganz interessanter Einblick. Ich bin Wirtschaftsprüfer und verantwortlich für Abschlussprüfungen und sämtliche damit verbundene Tätigkeiten. Offene Projekte habe ich derzeit, wenn man mal von Mandatsuntergliederungen absieht (!) genau.. 23. Dreiundzwanzig. 

Eigentlich sollte das so laufen, dass ein Team die operative Arbeit macht, ich das Geschäft vorantreibe und die Qualitätssicherung mache. Weil wir aber kein wirklich attraktives Einstiegs-Modell haben, definitiv nicht mehr die 1er-Absolventen und definitiv diejenigen, die 9-5 Arbeiten und \_keine Verantwortung übernehmen\_. Und da liegt das riesen Problem. Ich bin für 23 Projekte verantwortlich, die wir in einer Personalplanung disponieren. Liefert der Mandant nichts? Team ist es egal, dann ist die Planung halt vorbei und das nächste Projekt wird abgesessen. Mandant liefert nur Blödsinn? Es wird erstmal rumgeheult. Mandant macht einen Fehler? Wird übersehen oder wir sprengen die Zeitleiste komplett.

Mein Arbeitstag inzwischen: Ich springe von Thema zu Thema zu Sinnlosigkeit zu Adminisration. Fachlich komplexe Themen zu durchdringen, wie ich es zu Beginn der Karriere gemacht habe? Geht nicht. Jeder Trottel stellt 30 Minuten Call für Nichtigkeiten ein. und 10 dieser Calls lassen eben einen halben Arbeitstag bereits vergangen sein. Und dann geht die Arbeit los.

Ich kann mit recht reflektieren, dass von all meinen Projekten über das Jahr (sagen wir einmal 45) genau 3 (!) mit einem guten Team und einem sehr guten Mandanten gut durchliefen. Selbst das war etwas Stress, macht dann aber Spaß.

Am Ende ist man als Wirtschaftsprüfer am Ende in der Kette, der Blöde wenn es schief geht, der Depp wenn es sonst keiner macht. Und das ohne bezahlte Überstunden. Ich rette meinen Arsch und meinen Arbeitgeber also stets für das Opfer meiner Freizeit, für das Versprechen eines in Zukunft durchaus attraktiven Gehalts, das aber mit immer mehr Dysfunktionalität, Verantwortung, Risiko verbunden ist. 

Für mich rechnet es sich nicht mehr wirklich. Vielleicht bin ich aber auch durch einige private Themen, die zusätzlich belasten, aufgearbeitet.

Ich scheue inzwischen schon einen Anruf zu machen, weil jeder weitere mögliche Workstream das Fass zum Überlauf bringt.

**Die Entscheidungssituation**

Falls das wichtig ist, ich stehe derzeit bei etwa 125 TEUR Gesamtvergütung, wenig Spielraum nach oben. Ich würde sagen 52h-Woche wäre rein zeittechnisch realistisch. Ich mache aber keine Mittagspause, keine Pausen, versuche für mich zeitverschwendende ""Coffee Breaks"" zu vermeiden. 

Nun habe ich das Angebot bzw. befinde mich im Prozess bei einem großen Konzern in der internen Revision einzusteigen. Ich hatte - das war 2 Tage vor Besprechung meines nächsten Karriereschrittes mit dem dann offengelegten möglichen Gehalt, siehe unten - eine Gehaltsrange um 125 TEUR angeboten, in dem Wissen, dass die Arbeitsbelastung geringer ist.

Die Tätigkeit hätte einen Reiseanteil der international wäre - und dann eben nicht nur für 3 Tage in die USA und zurück, dann noch eine 3 Tage-Woche bis Samstag hintendran, sondern halbwegs mit Rücksicht auf die persönlichen Belange.

Es ist gar nicht gedacht, dass man die Tätigkeit dort ewig macht, sondern sich im Konzern weiterentwickelt.  Das wäre es dann mit meiner bisherigen Tätigkeit und Ausbildung gewesen. Ich nehme nur einen hohen Absprung mit und starte natürlich in einer gewissen Position.

Eine vielleicht irrationale Sorge ist die Karrierentwicklung. Wenn ich bleibe, mich weiter von 8-21 Uhr hinsetze, dann ist der nächste Karriereschritt relativ sicher. Das bedeutet dann übrigens 140-180 TEUR Gesamtvergütung (bzw. 150-170 TEUR als realistische Bandbreite; wobei ich hier eher wieder an das obere Ende spitze). Mehr arbeiten als jetzt kann ich quasi nicht, ich weiß allerdings auch nicht wie lange ich das noch durchhalte. Mit Familie etc. wird das nur dann vereinbar sein, wenn die Frau und auch die Kinder zurückstecken. Noch kein Thema und noch bin ich gar kein Familienmensch, aber die Vorstellung ""so"" zu ""enden"" widert mich schon jetzt an.



Jetzt.. genügt es erstmal. Ich musste mir etwas frust von der Seele schreiben, aber wer sich mit mir unterhalten möchte dem danke ich schon jetzt dafür. Vielleicht habt ihr ja einen Tipp oder eine klare Meinung dazu.

I hate my body so much right now, looking at it makes me miserable.
Less than 3 years ago i was 140 now im 187 and i feel like a stupid fat ugly whale. I dont know whats causing it whether its my lack of sleep, diet, being chronically dehydrated or my pills. My doctor just told me to diet and exercise but where to start especially whenever i think about what i did to my body i break down crying. I hate myself for being so fat and ruining the body i was given. Whats even worse is i have a overactive thyroid which should be making me lose weight.  I was self conscious but when my doctor said i was obese on the bmi scale i had to hold in the tears till i broke down sobbing in the car.
I was always skinny dangerously so, under the normal percentile as a kid and i liked it that way, i rather be unhealthy and skinny then healthy and fat 

Deiting and exercise are torture and basically impossible. I have no hope that anything will work and that ill just keep getting fatter and fatter no matter what i do. I dont wanna end up 400+ pounds like my mom. 

I have no idea where to get real information on dieting because all the people on the reddit for that are insane hearh nuts who act like drinking anything but water and eating anything but chicken and rice means you'll gain 3000 pounds.

I dont wanna give up everything i enjoy and survive off a disgusting bland healthy diet. People say you can never drink soda again because they used to drink 3 litters a day so that means a single can a day or every couple days is gonna give you cancer and prevent all weight loss but every alternative they give is disgusting.i hate anything ""watery"" defused in water or water with a little flavor basically (sparking water is bitter tea and coffee are gross ) and anything with diet sugar is vile and has the worse aftertaste. So if i can have pepsi ever again i quess im only drinking bland tasteless water for the rest of life because they say milk (the only other drink i like besides sugary juice) is unhealthy too.

I can say goodbye to ever eatting pizza, burritos, pasta, cheese, ramen, steak or anything yummy every again.  Ill never be allowed to eat any fast food i every like again. All the food i enjoy is out the window expect sushi but who knows the fact i use spicy mayo might make that unhealthy too. Dieting will be miserable, im so picky, i HATE vegetable, i have tried over and over to like them but i can't, so my diet food that will probably 90% vegetable ill have to choke down, because ranch or sause is also unhealthy so ill it'll be a dry bowl of gross vegetables. At this point id rather just not eat. 
God forbid you dare to want a desert either, no crumbl every again.

Exercising is just torture i dont understand how i will every lose 20lbs because walking 30 mins only burns 100 cals but 3500 are in a pound so unless i strave myslef and run 6 hours a day nothing is gonna change this is hopeless and i kight as well go crawl in a hole and die. People say its a lifestyle change. One where you feeling guilty for every little calories you eat and you have to earn the right to eat by Exercising 6 hours a day. Its a miserable hopeless endeavor and i dont wanna live that way but i dont have a choice. I have make myself miserable and hate existence just to lose weight. Its takes any joy away from eating thier was and makes it just a time to feel guilty and anxious. The only exercise i enjoy is just dance and swimimg. I Hate gyms and running, they are miserable and im not trying to gain muscle im just ttying not be a fat ugly cow anymore.I just dont wanna exist right now i hate how hopeless i feel.  I hate looking in the mirror and i wish i could cut it off but instead i have to suffer for every pound i gained. I deserve to suffer for it. I hope i do so i never get this way again.  I hate myself  and i really hope i get what i deserve for wvery gaining this weight. I deserve to stave and suffer and not enjoy food because i abused it.",0,1746646034.0,Advice,4,0.5,False
1kh65tl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kh65tl/find_out_if_the_bonsenkitchen_milk_frother_is/,Find Out If the Bonsenkitchen Milk Frother Is Worth the Investment Review,"Testing the Bonsenkitchen MF8712-NEW Milk Frother has become part of my daily coffee routine. This sleek handheld device, with its promise to create creamy froth in seconds, piqued my interest, and after putting it through its paces, I have quite a bit to share about its performance, design, and practicality. Whether you're a coffee aficionado or someone just looking to elevate their morning drink, this milk frother has some noteworthy characteristics.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my eye was the compact and modern design. The Bonsenkitchen MF8712-NEW is lightweight but doesn’t feel flimsy, combining a stainless-steel whisk with a black BPA-free shaft. Its ergonomic handle makes it easy to hold and operate, even if you’ve just stumbled out of bed in desperate need of caffeine. The frother is small enough to store in a kitchen drawer, and taking it on a trip is no hassle at all. Its simple yet effective structure adds to its utility, making it a helpful gadget in any kitchen. Plus, it complements my sleek espresso machine aesthetically – a bonus for keeping my counter stylishly organized.

**Performance and Operation**  
Using this milk frother has been a real game-changer for my lattes and cappuccinos. The high-speed stainless-steel whisk is impressively fast – it takes about 15-20 seconds to whip up rich, creamy foam for coffee drinks, as promised. It didn’t just stop at frothing milk; I tried it with almond milk and even matcha lattes, and the results were consistently great. Operating it is as simple as pressing a button, and there's no complicated learning curve. Whether you're frothing dairy, plant-based milk, or mixing protein shakes, it manages to deliver an excellent consistency.  

Check [Bonsenkitchen MF8712-NEW](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b076f3c4xp/) price on Amazon.

**Ease of Cleaning**  
Kitchen gadgets often fail in the cleanup department, but this frother breaks the mold. A quick rinse under warm water while the whisk is running is all it takes to get it sparkling clean. There’s no intricate assembly or disassembly required, and this simplicity makes me much more likely to use it frequently. However, the instruction manual suggests avoiding dishwasher use, as it's strictly hand wash only.

**Positives**  
- Effortless to use with a one-button operation.  
- Portable and lightweight, perfect even for traveling.  
- Creates creamy foam quickly for various drinks.  
- Durable stainless-steel whisk and ergonomic handle.  
- Easy and straightforward to clean.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- Batteries are not included in the package.  
- The motor can occasionally be a bit noisy.  
- Cannot froth large quantities in one go, making it more suitable for single servings.  

**Market Rivals**  
Competing products like the Zulay Original Handheld Milk Frother come to mind when evaluating alternatives. While the Zulay wins points for its metal handle and slightly sturdier build, it also comes at a slightly higher price point. On the other hand, the Bonsenkitchen MF8712-NEW offers an equally powerful performance at a more budget-friendly cost. Then there’s the Aerolatte Frother, known for its high-speed whisk but lacking the portability and lightweight design found here. Compared to these, the Bonsenkitchen model scores high for being an everyday option without feeling excessively premium or underwhelming.  

**True Value**  
Without directly pointing to a set price, it’s fair to say that the value proposition of this milk frother is compelling. For coffee enthusiasts and even casual users, the cost-to-quality ratio is well-balanced. It provides functionality, durability, and a sleek design at a price that doesn’t dent your wallet. While needing to replace AA batteries might add to maintenance costs over time, the savings from skipping store-bought lattes more than makes up for it.

Not quite moors and magic, but close enough).

Friends say I’m thoughtful, affectionate, and weird in the best way. I say I’m curious, caring, occasionally chaotic, and the kind of bossy that plans the best dates, takes the lead without hesitation, and might gently, but firmly, tell you where to sit. I lead with confidence and prefer dynamics where that energy is welcomed and appreciated.

I’ve got a roof over my head, an income, and a car I don’t drive. Full time passenger princess, part time snack handler and music provider. 

I share my life with an amazing, drama free nesting partner. They’re disabled and I’m their carer, so I’m not available 24/7, but I’ve got plenty of space, emotionally and physically, for someone special. I practice kitchen table poly and I’m all about connections that feel intentional, warm, and exciting in that slow burn way.

Also: I’m disabled too. I use a walking stick and have low energy days, which means I’ve mastered the art of comfy dates, deep chats, and taking life at a pace that feels good. I’m independent, self aware, and believe rest is as radical as romance.

Some of the things I love:
Dancing to 80s bops while making tea. Getting weirdly competitive over vintage finds in charity shops. Loving every cat like it’s the last cat on earth. Losing hours to a good book, a creepy podcast, or a truly unhinged true crime doc. Rainy days. Wandering slowly through nature. Romanticising the hell out of the ordinary.

What I’m looking for:
Good conversation first, then let’s see. I’m open to something real if we click, mental spark, emotional connection, shared values. Ideally, you’re somewhere near SW England (or close enough that “want to grab a coffee*?” doesn’t require planning a flight). Long distance is fine if seeing each other semi regularly is actually possible.

* I don’t drink coffee. Or alcohol.

I’m into people who are clever, kind, emotionally literate, and just a little odd in the best way. Playful, curious, grounded. Bonus points if you’re someone who enjoys strong energy and thrives with a partner who’s happy to take the lead. No pressure, I like things to unfold naturally, but I’m serious about depth.

Queers to the front, but anyone respectful, communicative, and up for real connection is welcome.

Say hi with something real or something strange. Bonus points if it makes me raise an eyebrow. I’ve got time for the curious, the clever, and the ones who know how to hold a proper conversation. I’m not glued to my phone, but I don’t ghost either. Intentional replies only.

I’ve dabbled in coffee roasting as a hobby and previously worked at a roastery, which deepened my appreciation for the craft.

I hate my body so much right now, looking at it makes me miserable.
Less than 3 years ago i was 140 now im 187 and i feel like a stupid fat ugly whale. I dont know whats causing it whether its my lack of sleep, diet, being chronically dehydrated or my pills. My doctor just told me to diet and exercise but where to start especially whenever i think about what i did to my body i break down crying. I hate myself for being so fat and ruining the body i was given. Whats even worse is i have a overactive thyroid which should be making me lose weight.  I was self conscious but when my doctor said i was obese on the bmi scale i had to hold in the tears till i broke down sobbing in the car.
I was always skinny dangerously so, under the normal percentile as a kid and i liked it that way, i rather be unhealthy and skinny then healthy and fat 

Deiting and exercise are torture and basically impossible. I have no hope that anything will work and that ill just keep getting fatter and fatter no matter what i do. I dont wanna end up 400+ pounds like my mom. 

I have no idea where to get real information on dieting because all the people on the reddit for that are insane hearh nuts who act like drinking anything but water and eating anything but chicken and rice means you'll gain 3000 pounds.

I dont wanna give up everything i enjoy and survive off a disgusting bland healthy diet. People say you can never drink soda again because they used to drink 3 litters a day so that means a single can a day or every couple days is gonna give you cancer and prevent all weight loss but every alternative they give is disgusting.i hate anything ""watery"" defused in water or water with a little flavor basically (sparking water is bitter tea and coffee are gross ) and anything with diet sugar is vile and has the worse aftertaste. So if i can have pepsi ever again i quess im only drinking bland tasteless water for the rest of life because they say milk (the only other drink i like besides sugary juice) is unhealthy too.

I can say goodbye to ever eatting pizza, burritos, pasta, cheese, ramen, steak or anything yummy every again.  Ill never be allowed to eat any fast food i every like again. All the food i enjoy is out the window expect sushi but who knows the fact i use spicy mayo might make that unhealthy too. Dieting will be miserable, im so picky, i HATE vegetable, i have tried over and over to like them but i can't, so my diet food that will probably 90% vegetable ill have to choke down, because ranch or sause is also unhealthy so ill it'll be a dry bowl of gross vegetables. At this point id rather just not eat. 
God forbid you dare to want a desert either, no crumbl every again.

Exercising is just torture i dont understand how i will every lose 20lbs because walking 30 mins only burns 100 cals but 3500 are in a pound so unless i strave myslef and run 6 hours a day nothing is gonna change this is hopeless and i kight as well go crawl in a hole and die. People say its a lifestyle change. One where you feeling guilty for every little calories you eat and you have to earn the right to eat by Exercising 6 hours a day. Its a miserable hopeless endeavor and i dont wanna live that way but i dont have a choice. I have make myself miserable and hate existence just to lose weight. Its takes any joy away from eating thier was and makes it just a time to feel guilty and anxious. The only exercise i enjoy is just dance and swimimg. I Hate gyms and running, they are miserable and im not trying to gain muscle im just ttying not be a fat ugly cow anymore.I just dont wanna exist right now i hate how hopeless i feel.  I hate looking in the mirror and i wish i could cut it off but instead i have to suffer for every pound i gained. I deserve to suffer for it. I hope i do so i never get this way again.  I hate myself  and i really hope i get what i deserve for wvery gaining this weight. I deserve to stave and suffer and not enjoy food because i abused it.",1,1746645899.0,selfhelp,1,0.67,False

[M25]

I’ve dabbled in coffee roasting as a hobby and previously worked at a roastery, which deepened my appreciation for the craft. I’m now exploring the idea of launching a small-scale coffee venture—something simple to start, like testing the waters at a few local farmers markets to gauge interest and build a foundation.

I’m looking for a like-minded partner who’s passionate about coffee, ideally someone with experience or interest in the roasting side of things. I’d focus on logistics, planning, and operations, while you’d bring the beans to life. It would be a very low-cost, grassroots effort to start—more about creativity, community, and seeing where it goes.

I have created a little company in the past and sold some bags, I just do not currently have the ability to roast coffee. I am familiar with the networking and business side of things.

If this sounds exciting to you, I’d love to connect and chat more.

Best,

1kh62in,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1kh62in/rapid_fire_reviews_of_14_perfumes/,Rapid Fire Reviews of 14 Perfumes,"I’ve been to various perfume-stocking shops on two separate occasions in the past week, and I love to go and window shop. I wanted to share my very rudimentary thoughts on what I smelt. I'm aware that perfumes smell different on skin than on test strips, but alas I only have so much skin available for spritzing in public department stores. 

For reference, my tastes lean heavily towards smokey, incense-y, woodsy. I want nothing more than to smell like the liturgy and cigarettes. I also LOVE cherry scents, and enjoy green and aromatic, creamy/lactonic scents, and florals that have something intriguing/strange/ephemeral about them. I like vanilla a normal amount. I’ve been getting into perfumes for almost a year and tend to like more than I dislike. This is not good for the ever-growing perfume shopping list on my notes app.  

I like to make my very sweet and long-suffering partner rate perfumes when I come home with a bunch of test strips. I make him tell me what he thinks about each one and then place all the test strips in a line from most to least favourite. We differ sometimes. His favourite perfume for himself has been Hugo Boss BOSS since he was 16, apparently. His favourite ever perfume in me is Jo Malone Myrrh and Tonka, because he says it smells classy and “like what a perfume should smell like.” It’s one of my favourites too, so I tend to agree.

The results of 2 separate perfume smelling expeditions:

**Chris Collins African Rooibos:** Spicy, woody, warm, vaguely sweet. Listen, for someone who is not overly familiar with rooibos tea, this is perfectly evocative of rooibos. However, true rooibos this is not. I am South African, I grew up with rooibos, I drink a cup almost every night. This is more of a rooibos/chai spice blend than a true rooibos. I get cinnamon, though cinnamon is not listed as a note? I think this is a perfectly lovely, warming cosy scent, and a departure from the tradition of tea perfumes being either black tea or a matcha/mate/green tea blend. There’s also a sweetness, similar to honey -the sweetener of choice for rooibos imo (honey is also not a note). I think my expectations of a photorealistic cup of rooibos many have affected my judgment slightly. The woody, spicey drydown is also quite beautiful, the spice in the top notes somehow lingers but becomes intermingled with the tonka and cedar. It’s really cosy. I have mixed feelings about this one, initially I judged it very harshly but the dry down may win me over still, as when I smelt the test strip the following day, with an understanding that it wasn’t quite straight rooibos, I was really struck by how pretty it was. I’d like a sample. Maybe. I’m undecided. Ugh. *Partner’s thoughts:* “You’re right, this is more rooibos chai than rooibos.” (This thought may have been preceded with the above soliloquy). Needs further testing/5.

**Juliette Has a Gun Pear Inc:** Nice light pear scent for the spring-summer. Sweet without being cloying and refreshing. Doesn’t project to strongly, so would make a good work scent. I find myself being really drawn to pear scents, which is usually weather inappropriate as we’re going into winter my side and they’re often quite summer-y. More elegant than Springtime in a Park (below.) Will revisit in the spring. *Partner’s thoughts:* “I can barely smell this on the test strip.” 3/5

**Parfums de Marly Cassili:** No. Awful. Smells like toilet spray to my nose. There’s something evocative of bathroom air freshener. I had a similar reaction to Sol de Janeiro 40 (VERY different price points, I’m aware). I think it’s the plum? (I love the plum in Tom Ford Plum Japonais though ???) I figured it might be the plum cassis mixture in Cassili, but it isn’t straight soapy, just cloying, loud, and seems like it’s trying to cover up a stench. Do not get cosy soft peaches and cream. Very bad. *Partner’s thoughts:* “I’ve never seen you gag at a perfume before.” No/5.

**Parfums de Marly Meliora:** This smells like pretty, expensive shampoo. I wish I got a better sniff at the red berries opening (love red berries), but I’d dropped the cap when I tried to put it back on and had to scramble under the PdM display to retrieve it while being given the Bombastic Side Eye by the sales associate nearest to me. I think the cassis and lily give it that shampoo-ey vibe. This is sparkly, fruity, fresh floral goodness. I smelt this due to perfumetok creator thetopnotes 's description that this smelt like a garden fairy. I want to be a garden fairy. I want to buy a decant to test it further, as my skin does interesting things with soapy notes, which I had a bit of a love hate relationship with (Diptyque’s Orpheon, for example, is bar soap on the test strip but aromatic woodsy juniper goodness on my skin). Partner’s thoughts: “It’s pretty. It does smell like shampoo.” 4.5/5

**Marc-Antoine Barrois Aldebaran:** !!!!!!!!!! This is my perfect wonderful angel princess whom I love. Smelling this alone made this whole day worth it. The tuberose is very prominent, and bubblegum-y in the best way, but the cloying quality tuberose can have is mitigated by the mate and paprika notes. I’ve seen comparisons online to Tiger Balm, or a vague eucalyptus smell. I don’t get that personally, what I get it the most perfect tuberose scent, which lasts and lasts. Seriously, the test strip still smells almost a week later. It’s quite a linear scent, as the tuberose is very prominent throughout the scent journey, but I am a Tuberose Lover TM. I love her. I want a full bottle. If I did not have a voucher for another shop which sold perfume, she would have come home with me, budget be damned. *Partner’s thoughts:* “I think it smells very nice. It gives me a green vibe. I think it would suit you well.” He also rated it his 2^(nd) favourite of perfumes that he smelt on test strips I brought home that day. 100/5.

**Guerlain Aqua Allegoria Forte Mandarine Basilic:** A citrus for winter. Mandarin, basil, sandalwood, vaguely soapy. It also lasts a decent while on my skin (I go ansomnic to literally all my perfumes within about 2 hours, so longevity isn’t my biggest perfume concern, but I know it is for a lot of people). I’m not usually an orange citrus lover, but the basil gives it an interesting bitterness that cuts through the syrup-y quality I believe mandarin can have. It’s bright without lacking depth, and citruss-y without being cold. I don’t get prominent sandalwood, but it certainly lends a warmth once it’s dried. It does have a soapy-ness in the drydown (cassis again) which I initially was a bit put off by, but I’ve grown to quite enjoy it (I’m wondering if it’s the creaminess in the sandalwood playing off the cassis and greenness in the basil?) I also had a voucher for the shop this was at, so it came home with me (and I then deliberate for two days over whether I should return it, decided not to, and have worn it every day since). *Partner’s thoughts:* “You smell like oranges and princess.” Bought a full bottle/5.

**Maison Margiela Replica Under the Lemon Trees:** Fresh, beautiful, lemon-y citrus. I don’t really get the green tea/mate specifically, it’s more a greenness and bitter-ness the seem reminiscent of the lemon skin and lemon tree, not just the fruit itself. Apparently the citrus note is actually lime, not lemon, but I get the subtle sweetness of lemon. No detergent at all, it’s just pure lovely lemon citrus. (I LOVE lemons, as a sidenote). Definite springtime revisit. *Partner’s thoughts:* “This is really nice. I like this one a lot. It’s such a fresh classy lemon scent.” 4.5/5

**Maison Margiela Replica Springtime in the Park:** Pear shampoo. Again, I’m enjoying a pear note. I’m finding that lily-of-the-valley can often be evocative of shampoo. It’s soft and pretty, and the sweetness from the pear is really pleasant. The musk is really subtle, it’s more grounding than anything. It’s a little synthetic, but I’ve got a feeling this would shine in warmer weather, or a day date (I’m thinking wine farm lunch). Another to revisit. *Partner’s thoughts:* “This smells like shampoo” (derogatory). (He wasn’t fond of this). 3.5/5

**Maison Margiela Replica Coffee Break:** Incredibly realistic creamy coffee on the first spray. I’m very fond of the lavender/vanilla combo, so I really enjoy the way this dries. The lavender is not overly sleepy-time and sticks around throughout the fragrance journey (lol). When it dries, the vanilla is really prominent, along with I believe some earthiness from the tonka and benzoin. It’s not particularly lactonic, though there is a slight creaminess, and it’s just sweet enough. It’s soft and cosy. I really do find the lavender quite lovely here. *Partner’s thoughts:* “This is so nice, but I think maybe I’d like this as a room spray. Maybe I just associate lavender with room sprays. I really like the coffee. I love coffee. Please will you make me a cup of coffee?” (He also rated this one as 2^(nd) favourite overall in this round of sprays). 4/5

**Maison Margiela Replica By the Fireplace:** Woodsmoke deliciousness. To me, this is a very hyped perfume, so snobbery made me not want to love it, but I do. It’s woody and cosy and slightly sweet and very smokey. I enjoy the chestnut note (there’s also chestnut in Zadig & Voltaire This is Her!, which is a recent acquisition and I believe the chestnut makes it quite special.) This really is right up my olfactory alley. The smoke in this is STRONG, it truly smells like my parent’s fireplace in Winter, particularly when first sprayed. The spice from the cloves and juniper also lend a little something, without this becoming an overly spicey or aromatic fragrance. Don’t get me wrong, it is spicey, but the primary scent is just that beautiful smokey wood. There’s something vaguely “masculine” here too, which personally makes me enjoy it more. *Partner’s thoughts:* “That’s really smokey. That smells a bit like my vanilla cigarettes.” (Dear reader, it does not smell like cigarettes). 4.5/5

**Hermes Un Jardin a Cynthere:** Olive fragrance !!!!! I live love laugh olives. My dirty martinis are about 50% olive brine. Once in high school I was broken up with quite brutally and instead of ice-cream, ate an entire jar of olive tapenade while crying. This has pistachio, olive tree, and citrus, as the very nice saleslady at the Hermes counter explained to me. It’s green and unique, with a subtle sweetness from the citrus and a delicious nuttiness from the pistachio (it’s not pistachio gelato smelling by any means, but that nutty, almond-but-not-quite sweetness is there). This is definitely not a sweet gourmand by any means, however. This is very clearly marketed as a summer fragrance, but I could see it working just as well as a chic, fresh winter scent. I love this and would like to buy a bottle (or the travel size, yells my bank account). Unique and delightful. *Partner’s thoughts:* “Wow, this one smells so classy and elegant. I really like this.” This was his top rated fragrance both times I made him smell test strips, because I got a tester both times I went out.   5/5

**Armani The Yulong:** Super hyped tea scent. Descriptions online liken it to the perfect spa fragrance. There is an overwhelming soapiness to my nose that totally takes over from the tea. Apparently, this has both green and black tea, but all I get is indistinguishable fancy hand soap. Perhaps at a spa, but more likely the guest bathroom of your rich friend’s parents. For the price and the hype, I think I expected way more. *Partner’s thoughts:* No reaction. Rated it quite low. Meh/5

**Jo Malone Scarlet Poppy:** Blown away is an understatement. I also LOVE this. The ambrette opening had the most beautiful sweetness, and the tonka and heliotrope once it dries is absolutely beautiful. The almond-y, almost-but-not-quite-cherry lean in heliotrope makes this scent feel really rich and warm. It’s opulent and decadent without being loud and garish. This retains a soft warmth, like a perfectly fitted cashmere jersey that no one but you knows was expensive. A touch powdery, a touch musk-y, totally feminine in an almost indescribable way. Clearly an attempt was made*.  Partner’s thoughts:* “I can’t really smell this.” (He wasn’t the biggest fan, despite my opinion that Scarlet Poppy projects pretty well for a Jo Malone. I can still smell it clearly on the strip a day later.) Love/5

**Jo Malone Wood Sage and Sea Salt:** The Jo Malone perfumes were displayed with a little cloche in front of them with a strip of *something* soaked in the fragrance. This smelt INCREDIBLE in the little cloche? I also really enjoy a salt note. I could barely smell this in store (perhaps a combination of not great projection and sales-lady dodging on my behalf). I could not smell this on the test strip when I got home (around an hour later), all I got was the vague faint sweetness of ambrette, which made me think that some of Scarlet Poppy had gotten on my strip. I am aware that Jo Malone generally makes colognes, not EDPs, so light projection is to be expected. This is perhaps not a very useful review. *Partner’s thoughts*: “This is also classy. I smell this more than I smell Scarlet Poppy.” (Apparently my partner has the magical gift of sensitive olfactory glands).  2.5/5

 

**Top picks (bought or plan to buy):** Marc-Antoine Barrois Aldebaran, Guerlain Aqua Allegoria Forte Mandarine Basilic, Hermes Un Jardin a Cynthere, Jo Malone Scarlet Poppy

So I 23f have been in a situationship with (we will call him Kyle) 24m for about 6 months.
About 10 months ago Kyle joined my team in work and we became friends very quickly which then turned into feelings. 
In September we went on a team night out and it got very flirty between us and we admitted we both had feeling for eachother. 
This was also the night that he met his now girlfriend ( we will call her Anna) 20f.
Kyle and Anna matched on tinder and were talking for a few weeks before this night.
After them meeting they quickly started a relationship within a few weeks. 
I was gutted but tried to move on and continue just being friends with him. 

However over the next few months it started becoming very flirty between us again and we started texting and talking 27/7.
Then in our Christmas party the lines were blurred even more between us and we admitted again we both had feelings for each other. It got very flirty and there was a lot of touchy feely but nothing actually happened.
A few weeks later after we continued talking we ended up going out on a date to a coffee shop after work one night and we kissed for the first time. 
After that it continued and we would kiss etc any chance we got, even in work. 

I need to add that Anna also works in the same building as us. 
This whole time Kyle has been telling me that he wants to be with me and sees a future with me. He also admitted that he loves me.
A few months ago we slept together for the first time and things starting getting weird after that. He’s been distant and cold but whenever I pull away from him he comes back and acts like he did before. Making me fall for him even harder. If that’s even possible because I’m completely in love with him.
 
*side note* I have never been in love or been in a relationship before so all of these feelings and the things that have happened between us are all completely new to me.

Anyways he is still in a relationship with Anna and it doesn’t seem to be ending any time soon. I have also found out that they are going ahead with putting her on his mortgage. 

This is really not sitting right with me as this poor girl is about to spend all of her savings and about to go into debt to live with a man who has been cheating on her for their entire relationship. 
I know it doesn’t seem like it but I really do feel awful for her. 
I’ve always thought of myself as a nice person but he has really made me go against all of my morals and values.
I really don’t like myself anymore and feel so guilty and stressed that it is really effecting my mental and physical health.
I feel awful because I have no right to feel this way as the pain she will feel when she finds out is much much worse. 

That being said I don’t know what to do? Do I tell her that he’s cheating or stay out of it and end it with him completely?
I still really love him and want to be with him which I know I shouldn’t but I do. 
Is telling her selfish? Is not telling her making me an even worse person?

Please any advice is appreciated thanks for reading xx

I wanted to share something that’s been a game-changer for me. Over the last few months, I’ve been on a journey to improve my sexual energy, confidence, and overall mood—naturally, without relying on any synthetic supplements or quick fixes.

I realized that a lot of our energy issues aren’t just physical—they’re deeply tied to lifestyle, diet and how we manage our body and mind. After reading, experimenting, and following some Ayurvedic wisdom, here’s what has actually worked for me.



What I Avoid Now:
	•	Frequent sex/masturbation – energy is lost more than we realize
	•	Junk food & processed stuff
	•	Extremely low-oil or dry diets
	•	Spicy & deep-fried foods – messes with digestion and heat balance
	•	Stimulants (coffee, energy drinks, etc.)
	•	Alcohol & smoking – obvious energy drainers

⸻

What I Do Religiously:
	1.	Saffron Milk – 30 mins before bed, every night (for 2 months). Game-changer for sleep, libido, and calmness.
	2.	Shilajit – only during winters or cold climates (because it’s heat-inducing).
If it’s summer, I switch to Ashwagandha + Shatavari (1 tablet each daily).
	3.	Sexual Energy Booster Mix –
	•	Equal parts of:
Ashwagandha, Shatavari, Safed Musli, Kaunch Beej
	•	Add same quantity of Thread Mishri powder (natural sugar)
	•	Mix & store in an airtight container
	•	Take 1 tsp with warm milk every night for 2 months

⸻

Milk-Based Superfoods I Use:
	•	Fresh white butter
	•	Ghee
	•	Curd

They’re heavy but nourishing – just balance it with movement.

⸻

Fruits That Help:
	•	Dates
	•	Sugarcane
	•	Pomegranate
	•	Mangoes
	•	Ripe bananas
	•	Grapes

⸻

Vegetables I Focus On:
	•	Ladyfingers
	•	Jackfruit
	•	Yams
	•	Drumsticks
	•	Pumpkins

⸻

Nuts & Seeds:
	•	Sunflower seeds
	•	Almonds
	•	Pine nuts
	•	Walnuts

Again, all these are calorie-dense – so I make sure to train well.

⸻

My Exercise Routine:
	•	Strength training, especially leg workouts (boosts testosterone naturally)
	•	Breathing exercises (Google these if you’re new):
	•	Bhastrika
	•	Kapalbhati
	•	Anulom Vilom
	•	Yoga for pelvic and hormonal balance:
	•	Mool Bandh (pelvic lock)
	•	Badhakonasana (butterfly pose)
	•	Sarvangasana (shoulder stand)

⸻

This has not only helped with my sexual health, but also improved my mood, confidence, and clarity. No fap, no pills—just real food, movement, breath, and ancient wisdom.

Hope this helps someone who’s been feeling low or struggling silently. Happy to answer any questions or dive deeper into any of the points above.

Stay well, naturally.

Overall, we have a pretty normal relationship, but lately, I’ve been feeling more and more exhausted—mentally and emotionally. Sometimes I just want to run away. But maybe I’m overreacting, which is why I’m turning to you all for perspective.

There are a few things that are really weighing me down. The biggest one is household responsibilities. Between the two of us, I feel like I’m the only one who actually cares about keeping things clean and organized.

I do all the cleaning—from everyday tidying to deep cleaning. I’ve stopped asking him to help because we’ve had conversations about it before, and nothing ever changed. Still, cleaning isn’t the worst part for me—it gives me a chance to zone out. What really gets to me is that I’m not asking him to clean the whole place, just to clean up after himself. And even that’s a struggle. He’ll walk in with muddy shoes right after I’ve cleaned the floors, leave socks and snack wrappers everywhere, dirty dishes in the sink, and not think it’s a big deal. His excuse? “You can always clean again.” I constantly have to remind him to pick up after himself, and I’m just so tired of it. But then he tells me I’m overreacting and that “this isn’t a museum,” so I start to question whether I’m being too uptight.

Other chores like cooking, laundry, grocery shopping, and walking the dog also fall to me. I’m the one who has to figure out meals, do the shopping, wash and fold the clothes. If I ask him to cook, he says I do it better. Even on days when I get home way later than him, I still end up making dinner—despite him having all the time to do it. He won’t do laundry because he “doesn’t know how.” He won’t do groceries because “stores stress him out.”

Even walking the dog is a problem. I do it pretty much every time. On the rare occasions I ask him to take the dog out because I’m exhausted, he says it’s my dog, so it’s my responsibility. That hurts, because we got the dog together. He chose the breed, and even though I had my heart set on a smaller dog, I compromised because I thought we were making a shared decision. Yes, I was the one who wanted a dog more—it’s been a dream of mine since childhood—but does that mean I should be the only one taking care of it?

Spending time together is another issue. We rarely go out just the two of us—unless it’s absolutely necessary. Any trips or vacations are always with a group of friends. Even something as simple as going out to eat has to include others. He says spending time alone together is boring. Is that really how it gets in long-term relationships? Do couple outings just stop being fun?

What frustrates me the most is that when I finally do convince him to go somewhere or do something, he ends up taking credit for it. Recently, I had been talking about wanting to visit a nearby town just to get away for a bit, walk around, and grab coffee at a place I really like. At first, he said no, we weren’t going anywhere. But on his day off, he suddenly said we could do something. I suggested that same town, and he agreed. After we got back, he said, “See? I know how to plan things and take us places. You never do that.” Maybe I’m being petty, but I genuinely felt like I contributed to that outing—I found the idea, I suggested the place, I tried to make it happen. But somehow, he still took the credit.

Maybe I’m just tired. Maybe I’m being too sensitive. But I’d really appreciate a fresh perspective, because I feel lost in it all.

Is It Legit or Just Another Sketchy App?,"I came across Luna VPN this week while browsing the App Store, looking for a quick free option to use on my iPhone when I’m on public Wi-Fi. I hadn’t heard of it before, but it had a bunch of positive reviews and a clean-looking UI, so I downloaded it just to test it out.

The setup was super fast, and it connected in seconds without asking for an account or credit card, which felt too good to be true. I used it mostly for browsing Reddit and checking Gmail at a coffee shop, and it didn’t slow my connection down much. But when I tried using it to watch a geo-blocked YouTube video, it didn’t work at all, the site still knew I was in my actual location.

I started digging around and saw barely anything in free VPN Reddit threads about Luna, which made me wonder if it’s just not widely used or if there’s a reason people avoid it. The app doesn’t say much about what servers it uses or if it keeps logs, which is kind of a red flag for me now.

Has anyone here actually used Luna VPN more seriously? Is it safe or just one of those free apps that looks good but isn’t doing much behind the scenes? Curious if I should delete it and stick with something more trusted from the best free VPN Reddit list.",1,1746645257.0,VPNFreaks,0,1.0,False
1kh5unh,https://i.redd.it/vshcsk43teze1.jpeg,Quick review of new releases/rereleases,"I haven't bought from Goose Creek in 3-4 years after multiple disappointing orders, but the 5 for $55 deal got me. I struggled to find many reviews for these scents, so I thought I would throw my hat in the ring for anyone eyeing these.

Raspberry Sorbet - I was hoping this would be close to BBW's raspberry mimosa that honestly reminded me more of a raspberry icy dessert than a drink. This... is disappointing on cold. The raspberry is VERY strong, which I do like. However, I am not getting much vanilla or even a creamy sorbet scent from it.

Belgium - I noticed that this was one of the World Traveler candles that had their scent notes get shortened down, so I was unsure what to expect. I will say, taking out baked nuts was a good decision because there is no noticable nutty scent. For those that said this is a dead ringer for BBW's Boardwalk Cone without any berry, that was incredibly accurate. This scent does NOT give off fresh pastry or dough in my opinion, but it absolutely smells like fresh waffle cones lingering in the air. Not exactly noticing caramel or vanilla on cold either, just a lovely, sweet cone scent.

Jamaica - This one had mixed reviews, so I was nervous. Holy CRAP, this is delicious. On cold, I don't get any rum or fruit. But it is a STRONG spice cake scent. Not like carrot cake where it is rounded out by vanilla or cream cheese icing, it is just straight up spice cake.

Austria - I was unsure if this was a repackage of the old Poland World Traveler candle, but I am going to guess probably not. This scent is not doughy, pastry, or bakery scented on cold whatsoever. It is very strong apple and clove. I wouldn't mind this too much if it didn't smell like a fall candle. This should be named something akin to Falling Leaves. This is not baked, cinnamony sweet apple. This is very 'I need to cover up a smell' level of apple and clove.

Netherlands - This repackage took away the chocolate and hazelnut scent notes. THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE. This does NOT seem like a reformulation, just shortened notes. For anyone who does not like chocolate, this is NOT for you. That was the scent I first picked up on. Somewhere between a semi-sweet chocolate or maybe muted nutella. I don't get dough on cold, but it certainly is bakery forward with the syrupy sweet caramel scent.

Warm Blueberry Crumble - I was reaaally hoping for something to replace the void in my heart left by the discontinued BBW Blueberry Pie. It smelled just like blueberry poptarts to me. This is not anything like a blueberry pie or crumble on cold. Not a hint of bakery scent - no crust, no oats, no spices. It is just a wildly strong, warm blueberry scent.

Lemon Butter Cake - An old one, but clearly a good one. It smells DELICIOUS. I don't personally get cake from the scent, but it is a very sugary, creamy lemon vanilla. I hated BBW ILPC, so I was glad to see that this seemed stronger and less artificial.

Spongebob - I was maybe most excited for this scent because I have an older kiddo obsessed with Spongebob. However, I kept my expectations low because I was worried this may be a repackage of the poorly received Honolulu Ice Cream. Honestly, I am very iffy about this scent. It doesn't smell like ice cream to me, whatsoever. It is a little closer to a dole whip scent with the tiniest hint of vanilla. But something is coming off a little sour or icky on cold with the milky note in this. Hopefully it is better on warm because the scent has so much potential.

Bourbon Peach Coffee Cake - LOVE. If you are sensitive to peach scents, skip this. It is super peach forward and not a particularly fresh peach. More of that syrupy canned peach. I don't particularly smell bourbon, but there is this warm, rich scent that really pops out that isn't spice. It isn't exactly cakey to me, but it is bakery forward. Not buttery or cinnamony like a coffee cake, but whatever notes were supposed to come through from the cake certainly is delicious.

Iced Coconut Chai Latte - Honestly, I freaking hate this on cold. It is disgusting, IMO. Zero chai spice whatsoever. It is creamy in the way lotion is creamy. Not sunscreeny but definitely lotiony. The coconut is there, but it doesn't smell like fresh coconut or even coconut milk. My kids have an aveeno coconut lotion and it genuinely smells so much like that (not in a good way).

Toasted Pistachio Muffin - For what it is worth, my husband sniffed this and immediately made a face. He told me 'this one will be yours'. However, I LOVE this scent! This is a super cozy, warm pistachio and vanilla scent. It is more of a creamy, somewhat natural scent on cold. I really do not get any muffin from it. Nothing cakey, buttery, or spiced.

She lays around home all day. She is the typical Beverly Hills Pilates iced coffee spoiled girl you see on reality shows. She does whatever she wants everyday. She goes to gym classes, she spends most of the time with her child and our cats and dogs, she loves watching television, she goes out with her friends and brags about how she can do whatever she wants in the middle of the day while everyone is either at work or school. That’s her life. 

She quit her job when she got pregnant with a baby that isn’t even mine and said she didn’t want to work while she’s pregnant because that’s basically abuse against woman.

A couple of days into our journey to starbucks, we came across a bridge out situation.  A few other riders had been there for half an hour and were discussing how to best solve the same problem we were. How can we get to that **starbucks**?

We decided the best option was not to turn around and go back half an hour and re-route.  We decided to build a temporary bridge instead of using my brother's first plan. That was 'I am just going to jump it' (with my Harley Pan America). We (meaning the other 4 of us) decided against that plan.

He still thinks that was the best and quickest option and would have been enjoying that $10 coffee an hour earlier.

 

Anyway, we made it to starbucks, but we forgot to go inside and buy any coffee or whatever they call it there.

1kh5mzj,https://i.redd.it/omcqe6ajreze1.jpeg,Day 2 and Learning Obvious Lessons,"Using the flair “I cooked in my car” just because I cooked myself in my car. Hahaha

Day 2 of homelessness in my car. I’ve slept curled up in the drivers seat twice now, which I should have known better because I have cankles now.
 
I guess I’ve been a bit worried that being in the back seat is more obvious that I’m sleeping in my car on purpose and not “oops got super tired and took a nap on accident after I parked”.

I bought some cheap compression socks and I’m trying to alleviate the swelling. I had the car ac on blast, windows covered, and had a clip fan running, but realized that wasn’t necessarily the coolest route as the indoor temp creeped up into the 90s. I thought I built a fridge for myself, but instead I built an oven. Haha

I’m accustomed to living in below 70 AC so I hope I’m not still unhoused by summer. I’ll be trying to occupy myself outside of my car until the Texas sun goes night night every day. I have pretty severe social anxiety so loitering in the library or a coffee shop is a nightmare for me.  Right now I’m parked under a shade tree and a local park by the lake with the windows down and the car off.

TLDR of Things I’ve learned so far:

1. Be mindful of seating and sleeping positions.
2. Don’t skimp on quality window coverings.
3. Parking with the car running, ac on blast, with coverings in windows isn’t necessarily better than parking in the shade, car off with the windows down. Never underestimate the power of shade and hopefully a breeze. ",13,1746644732.0,urbancarliving,7,0.76,False
1kh5mwp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kh5mwp,I got quoted some parts and i'm not sure if I should just get something new,"Some backstory, we have had this Jetta. Since 2018, it had one owner since 2014. My partner was the sole caretaker for it up until 2022 when I started doing a delivery service job so then I took over maintaining the car.

Apparently my partner never decided to do any maintenance or any cleaning or anything on it. No winter protection. Nothing not even a car wash. He took it to an appraisal mechanic, so that guy was just retarded and messed up the car even more. So the bottom of the car I would say in my opinion is completely rusted out to the point where i'm having a lot of issues.

I was going to the dealership at first the Volkswagen, one because I was brand new to taking care of a car, so I didn't know who to trust and it turns out the mechanic, my partner was going to completely destroyed the car even more. He put wrong parts in it that were not even for a Volkswagen jetta  He jammed in the filter. Jammed in lights used like a regular coffee filter and just a whole bunch of horrible things.So at that point I was scared of going to any mechanic, except the dealership

Obviously, I got ripped over the coals. Now that I'm going over all my receipts, I spent at least 10K since 2022 fixing it. I now have a new mechanic that has been with My family for a long time.I was just too dumb to ask my stepdad.For help, since him and my mom are divorced, but I finally did.And now i'm at another place

I try to ask them on scales of 1 to 10. What I should be doing, or how bad is the work? Because I don't really have the best income 

I recently got into a car accident. So I am no longer able to pay for anything.I obviously have a credit card, but i'm already a good way into debt so I don't really want to just max out my card

I'm looking over all my receipts from when I first started going to Volkswagen, and it seems that they noted my window switch was broken and I also brought a concern to them about me, hearing some noise and having a problem with my acceleration, the problem with my acceleration comes and goes. So at the time, it wasn't that much of a big deal

Now fast forward to the present day, the acceleration issue, it's very bad. It's to the point where the car will jump to sixty kilometers out of nowhere, kind of like a tesla and i'm scared i'm gonna hit somebody so I have to immediately break or when I press the gas, it won't go anywhere at all

When I was leaving my parking garage i heard a loud clunking noise to the point where I got out the car and noticed there was a piece of metal on the ground. I took it in the car because I was unsure if it was from my car or somebody else's and I asked my partner and my friend. They said it was too big to be from my car. But I held on to it anyways when I finally went to the mechanic he said that it was a rear spring, so I guess you can't really see the springs near the rear tire area so that just proves that this car is just rusted to fuck

The pictures that I posted are the work that I have to get done now. He said it will take a full day and also that I should be going online to buy the parts

Now I don't really have an issue buying parts or this and that it's more, so I don't have the income at the moment to continue fixing a car that i'm not even driving

I got into an argument with my partner. This morning, because I set up an appointment to go look at some Mazda's. I already spoke to the mazda dealership, and they were telling me how they have a 3-7 year warranty for basically everything that i've already got done  on the car, so to me, that's like 10 k I possibly could have saved i told my partner that I made an appointment and he got upset saying that he has no money ( we've recently just bought a condo.funds are a bit tight)

I tried to explain to him that I'm not currently working, he told me that if I'm using the car while I was working that I'm responsible for it. I had to fill it up with gas. I had to maintain it. I had to fix it if there was a problem and I did everything. No issues, but now that I'm not working. It's like. Why should I continue doing this stuff? When I'm not the one using the car It's to the point that I think he got so used to it. He won't even fill the car up with gas. He will wait till it says literally five kilometers left before he goes to a gas station and that just gives me a lot of anxiety, so when it's at a quarter tank, I end up filling it up

During this argument, he told me that we have no money. He's not paying for anything. He's going to wait till the car dies.Before he gets a new one so he doesn't want to go to the dealership. To me, that was a slap in the face. I've been taking care of this car. I've sunk 10K of my earnings into it, and he's saying he'd rather just let it die to me. That's like saying you rather just let our relationship die because you don't want to maintain it. This car is now a part of our relationship. When you told me I had to care for it, you made it a part of it, and then now you're saying you're just going to let it die. Why would you let something I took care of die? That's like.I can't even explain how mad that made me. He's trying to say no car lasts forever, which is untrue cars should last forever. If you maintain them and take care of them. They can last a long time. Eventually, the insides are all gonna be new pieces. Because you're gonna have to replace things with that. That doesn't mean the car's dead. Eventually, you will have to get a new engine. But an engine compared to a new car is still pretty cheap. I told him i'm keeping this car.We're not getting rid of it, and it's not dying, and if you let it die, you're letting our relationship die, because that means you don't give a fuck about anything I do he made it seem like his money means everything and anything I do. It means nothing if I do something who cares.Throw it out if he does something.Oh, you have to keep it or oh my god.It's the end of the world.

Bit of a rant I know, but I feel like I'm being the one who's crazy by saying that we should look into a new car. I've already asked the building manager about parking spots. He said, it's like 60$ so if I can secure a parking spot, I would like to get a new car.
I understand it's his insurance, but when I spoke to the salesperson, they said that they can put it under my name and he can be a co. Signer, and I even told him, if that's the case, I'm getting an SUV because he wants a Sedan, I said, if you pick a Sedan, you're the one that has to pay with it and I'll co sign for you, because that's not what I want. And I don't think I should have to pay for things again.That are just gonna be taken away from me.

Long story short. Should I just keep sinking money into this car at the moment? Or should I just try and get a new one? And then fix the car when I get my job back again.?

1kh5m8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATHELP/comments/1kh5m8f/cat_having_issues_with_milk/,CAT having issues with Milk,"

Hey everyone,

My cat Miso (2 y/o rescue, incredibly loved and well cared for) has recently developed a bizarre obsession with cow’s milk—and it’s stressing me out.

For the past year, I’ve only ever given him cat-safe milk and even tried lactose-free goat’s milk for variety. He used to enjoy them in moderation, maybe as a treat every few days. 

But for the past 2–3 weeks, he’s completely rejected them all. Sniffs, walks away, not interested. This is wether the milk is warmed or cold and I have tried putting it in different vessels too. 

But the weird part is despite all this, he’ll go out of his way to sneak sips of cow’s milk from my cereal bowl or coffee mug. That’s the only milk he seems excited about now. Like earlier also it used to happen he sometimes used to sneak a few sips of cows milk but I would quickly take it away. So Miso has a taste for cow milk since the start. The issue I'm facing niw is that he seems to have given up on all other types of milk but still likes Cow Milk. 

I got a full health check-up done: blood tests, stool, hydration—everything’s normal. His eating, drinking, litter box, and energy levels are all fine.

I haven’t formally asked my vet about cow’s milk because every time I bring it up, he dodges the question and just pushes the clinic’s supplement line (which I’ve already tried, and Miso despises).

So I’m stuck. I know cow’s milk isn’t ideal, but is a small amount better than nothing? Should I cut milk out altogether? Is this behavioral?

1kh5lps,https://www.reddit.com/r/highschool/comments/1kh5lps/glad_i_graduated_before_they_ruined_one_of_my/,Glad I graduated before they ruined one of my favorite highschool events,"Every year in the spring my highschool held a charity event called THON where we would get the football field and track field and could do whatever for a few hours. There were giant hamster balls, a coffee truck, all the food we wanted and a foam slide. All the money from our tickets and outside donations went to children’s hospital and make a wish.

Well after I graduated I heard that this year they were deciding to ditch THON and replace it with a kickball tournament, still for charity. I was actually upset even though i didn’t go to that highschool anymore because it was so much fun the four years I went that freshmen didn’t even get to experience it this year. I saw the pictures and it was just a tiny event held in the high school parking lot. Kickball was on our baseball field while a couple tents from high school clubs lined up around the parking lot and it just looked sad and not half as fun as THON was. And I know we wouldn’t raise as much money for event not even half the size as THON.

I heard the excuse was that it was hard to chaperone all the kids there as there were two fields right next to each other filled with high schoolers but I know the real reason was just a budget cut and they didn’t want to pay for it all.",1,1746644648.0,highschool,0,1.0,False

1kh5lfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelExit/comments/1kh5lfy/youll_stop_worrying_what_others_think_about_you/,You'll stop worrying what others think about you when you realize how seldom they do,"I'd like to share advice about one of the most common things people post about on this sub. I've been using a variation of this quote (nobody cares, you're not Vladimir Putin) for a long time without knowing about what the phenomenon is called - ***The Spotlight Effect***. According to a study written by Gilovich, Medvec, & Savitsky, this is a *cognitive bias whereby individuals tend to overestimate the extent to which their behavior, appearance, or other flaws are noticed by others* (adapted).

An author named David Foster Wallace is quoted as saying (sometimes this is attributed to Eleanor Roosevelt):

***""You'll stop worrying what others think about you when you realize how seldom they do.""***

I think it's an excellent quote that crystallizes one of the biggest fears incels have that result in them self-isolating: the fear that other people, including strangers, think so lowly of them that they shouldn't bother others by trying to talk to them or interacting with them in any way. Most of the time, they feel like they're not worthy of talking to people because they think they:

1. Are too ugly/grotesque/unsightly
2. Have nothing to offer others
3. Are useless/worthless/subhuman
4. Are a bother/burden to everyone around them

A lot of you will probably identify with one or all of those reasons but the truth is - ***strangers care very little about any of your insecurities.***

These thoughts are excuses designed to mask the underlying unwillingness to risk rejection or embarrassment. After all, what if you try to engage with others and they end up pushing you away or they mock you while your back is turned - *by thinking like this, you're giving yourself ready excuses as to why you're isolated and why you don't make an effort to approach people.*

Moreover, these thoughts are mechanisms designed to affirm your cognitive biases and to make you think you're more important in strangers' eyes than you really are. After all, if they notice your insecurities, it must mean the blackpill is right and you're really subhuman and you really don't deserve to be treated as a person - *by thinking like this, you're giving yourself ready targets to blame so you can continue playing the victim.*

The fact is, regular people around you do not care much about your insecurities. There are so many things that occupy the average person that they don't have 2 seconds to think lowly of you at all. That's why this phenomenon is called ***""The Spotlight Effect""*** \- you somehow think that there's an imaginary spotlight around you that makes you noticeable for everyone else, when in reality, there is no such spotlight, and nobody cares about your fears at all.

So what exactly is the difference between regular guys making friends and you? *It's not the looks. It's not your worth. It's not that you're a bother. It's not your presence.*

***They approach and talk to people. They don't try to be self-important. They go about their business.***

***They treat others the way they want to be treated.***

The next question is usually ""how do I get over these thoughts?""

I found this 2023 article from myndlift about 6 ways to overcome the spotlight effect. Upon reading the tips, I realized that they can really be applied to helping you overcome your fears and insecurities and help you interact with people in general. I'll explain in my own way below but it's an interesting read nonetheless. Here's the article:

[https://www.myndlift.com/post/6-ways-to-overcome-the-spotlight-effect](https://www.myndlift.com/post/6-ways-to-overcome-the-spotlight-effect)

**1. Reframe your negative thoughts** \- the spotlight effect always starts with a negative thought. You're too ugly, stupid, useless, etc. and it spirals from there. You start thinking that others share your opinion and it snowballs into you not wanting to talk to anyone. Instead, you could try reframing the thoughts that begin the spiral: ""I’m not good enough"" can become ""I am still growing and learning"" and eventually “I always try my best"". *Nobody, after all, is perfect. There is always room to improve, whoever you are*.

**2. Consider the Illusion of Transparency** \- you and your mind are not transparent. Other people around you are also not transparent. It's that simple. Sometimes, we think that people can hear our thoughts or we can hear theirs - this is simply not a thing. Nobody knows if you think some guy's sweater is ugly and so you also don't know if they think your sweater is ugly. All your insecurities out in public are just illusions as *mind readers do not exist*.

**3. Take Someone Else’s Perspective** \- studies show that taking a different person's perspective helps reduce feelings of the spotlight effect. If you feel people are criticizing your appearance, turn it around; do you criticize others' appearance? Do you go around thinking everyone else is ugly and awful? No, right? You're minding your own business just like everyone else is. If you're not thinking badly of others, why do you think they're doing it to you? *You aren't. So they aren't.*

**4. Practice Present-Moment Awareness** \- using third person image-based meditation can help reduce feelings of egotism - that is, it helps keep you grounded and realize that everyone's worlds don't revolve around you. Spend 5-15 minutes a day imagining basic scenarios such as if someone spills coffee on himself - notice that nobody laughs, points fingers, or criticizes the person. This will help you apply situations like this in the real world and not be afraid of embarrassing yourself; *after all, you're not the center of everyone's day, so whatever awkward thing happens, nobody will care*.

**5. Recognize the Positives of Being Uniquely You** \- *you are unique. No matter how badly you think of yourself, there are things about you that are different that make you stand out*. Embrace them. Write them down. Moreover, you should make a daily exercise about making meaningful, small goals that you can accomplish easily, such as feeding a stray cat or buying coffee for a homeless man. Tell yourself every morning what you are good at. It doesn't have to be something big: a game, making eggs, jackstones, whatever.

**6. Seek Professional Support for Anxiety** \- and finally, the most important of all, if you still think the spotlight is around you, seek professional help. Medication and therapy can work wonders - even just the feeling of talking to someone about your anxieties can really make a big difference. After all, this fear of yours is a made up fear that doesn't really exist. You just need some help recognizing that all of this is in your mind. If you're always alone with nobody to talk about it, it becomes more difficult to dispel your own reasoning. *Your cognitive biases will always take over if you have no one to disagree with you.*

If you made it all the way here, thank you for reading. I give advice straight and direct and some of you don't like it but that's just my style. I prefer you hear the truth so you can do something about it. If you're currently not going out much, not approaching people at all, not talking to anyone around you, avoiding people like you're the plague, then I implore you to re-evaluate your strategy. *All of this is just in your mind. Nobody is out thinking of you badly. Nobody cares enough to spend their energy and time wondering about a stranger.*

***Coz you're not Vladimir Putin.*** You're not some special person who everyone needs to pay attention to. So what if you're <insert insecurity>? You're not my mom, boyfriend, brother, friend, teacher, etc. I have more important things to worry about.

***You're the one who wants to make friends.*** So you're supposed to be the one to do something about it. If you're the one who's hungry, you're the one who's supposed to order. If you're the one who's sick, you're the one who's supposed to call a doctor. They're not going to be the ones to approach you if you're in a corner feeling sorry for yourself. They're not going to shower you with compliments to make you feel good about yourself.

***Thinking that strangers think of you at all is a complete waste of time.***

Just relax. You're fine. Your issues are all in your head.

I was 17 when i met my husband, and he was my first love and boyfriend, though I was not his. He was also 17, had moved out from his mom's to live on his own due to a lot of trauma in his childhood. When we met he was in the middle of a terrible court experience testifying against his abuser. It was too long ago and there was not enough evidence, so they guy got off consequence free and it has haunted my husband since.  I felt so terrible for him and I did everything I could for him. When he wanted me to move out from my own home so we could rent together, I thought it was reasonable at the time, thinking I would be able to help and support him through his hard times and we could grow an amazing life together. I know now how simple-minded I was back then, I honestly believed if I loved him with all my heart it would be enough. 

Things were rough though, he didn't have much love and stability at home, and while he appreciated what I brought, it was also foreign to him. It became apparent that I was a peace-seeker, wanting to find ways we could be content and happy with what we had, even if it wasn't much, even if he wasn't perfect, we could make do. He was caught in a loop of bitterness though, and at first I was his ally through it. He would rail about how terrible society was to men, how terrible people were to each other, how no one would give him a chance to see the person he was. I ate it all up, I felt he was this misunderstood boy that just needed some opportunities to take off, but the bad habits from his trauma were getting in the way. 

The stress of going from a stable and quiet home to a partner who was emotionally unstable was becoming more than i recognized at the time though. Trying to manage and be there for his emotions, take care of the apartment, work full time, finish high school, it all started to crush me. I got really really sick and for a few years we had no clue what was causing it, i would vomit anything i ate and fell down to 80 pounds (usually 125). I was trying to survive, work what i could, comfort his worries about me and life, and figure out what was the actual cause. It took a long time to find out it was celiac, and a long time from there to get a handle of the diet and cross-contamination risks that I could be normal again. All the while he would get angry at me for life being so hard or for things i had done or didn't, and then him worrying about me leaving him and talking about suicide and how hard his life was. I kept getting hurt but coming back, because I was raised to be very empathetic, and I kept putting my own hurts aside to try to help him. I kept thinking that the difference in our privileges growing up meant that I had to take on what I could to help him find himself and find peace. 

I worked my butt off to get better, and tried to work as much as possible, with only a few years off here and there at the worse periods. I went through a form of agoraphobia at one point, becoming scared of gluten exposures and the damage they caused, but I went to therapy and got a handle on things better. Through that therapy I also learned to set healthier boundaries so I could establish the space i needed to recover. Once I got my feet under me, my grandpa passed and my grandma offered to use my inheritance to go to college like I had hoped to before getting sick. I went for software engineering in hopes of a solid career I could do even if rough from the Celiac. I wanted to help recover our finances and put my husband through college next so he could have an opportunity too. 

The problem was is over time my husband's resentment towards me grew and grew as our struggles continued. While I was sick, he was struggling to hold jobs, as he kept butting heads with staff or superiors, causing him to constantly quit or get fired. I worked as much as I could while sick and tried to help him with his moods at that time, but it slowed my own recovery efforts as I tried to keep us afloat. Eventually my parents began to step in, and over the years have shelled out over 25 000 to keep us afloat. All because every time I would beg them to try to have sympathy for his traumas as the reason why he had such a bad attitude towards everyone. I'd beg our friends to forgive him when he offended people by ignoring other people's feelings in pursuit of his own sense of justice for his own feelings. I'd try to keep the peace so he could have the supports he would so often complain he didn't have, even through he kept lashing out at everyone around him. I would also started to ask for him to be more responsible with chores around the apartment and with finances, as a big issue our whole relationship was how impulsive he would be in buying small things throughout the day, adding up to hundreds of dollars a week missing from the budget on fast food, coffee, pot and toys that entertained him for a week or two, if that. Meanwhile he would complain that my medication and gluten free food costs were what was preventing him from ever having money to invest in himself. We had the money, but I couldn't get it where it needed to be before it was gone. Those were my only 3 complaints, help around the house, setting a weekly fun budget and being more respectful of other people and their own boundaries when socializing. 

But for him it was much much more, small things and mistakes hung around as evidence for much larger feelings. He began to convince himself that I didn't care about him. That I was a ""privileged princess"" that couldn't possibly understand how terrible society was to him, that I was too self centered for the boundaries I had started to set in an effort to try to deal with our codependency. No matter how often I tried to point out what I would and could do, he would tell me they were apples to oranges and not what he needed. But what he needed was ever-shifting and dependent on the situation. I am not very quick on my feet, but he wanted to see me take more actions in the moment. I have a terrible memory, but he wanted me to remember things he said in passing conversations. I have flaws like any human being, and I never tried to tell him I didn't. All I would ask for is for him to work with me, like writing things down or helping me in the moment with the things he wanted to see. But he felt he had done enough, and didn't want to do anything more for me. He wanted me to fight everyone in our lives over causes he felt was just, even if it were to isolate me, because he should be enough. Over time everything became intolerable about me, he would express his hatred or disappointment at so many things about me. I tried to keep up, but even with my usually endless sympathy, I was starting to get frustrated at the impossible standards he was holding me to while demanding all our loved ones to make room for his behavior and not judge him. 

When I started college it all began to crumble. First year was suicide threats. Within the first months he was attempting suicide multiple times, including one time in the middle of an argument about him getting proper help. I am usually a high 80s-90s student, but I was struggling to keep my averages up while dealing with the emotional turmoil of trying to keep him alive and stabalize. This is where a lot of the debt to my parents came in, as they helped pay rent and bills while he took a year off. He would resent me for worrying about the bills though, because in his mind i had cost him enough when i was sick. He would exaggerate how much time i was off for and demand that he deserved the same. Eventually, I was able to convince him to reconnect with family, and between his family and I, we got him to approach work again and he found a really good job as a security guard at a library. Super peaceful and easy compared to his previous construction work, and people would treat him more kindly than when he was dressed in his more punk-like outfits. He loved the positive attention, and it highlighted all the negative feelings he had been feeling towards me. 

They grew through my second year of college, one that was much much harder than the first. I was struggling to keep up with the content, as I had never done programming in my life before, but he was insistent that our relationship issues could not wait. He believed that despite how bad college got, by being in a relationship I had responsibilities to him I had to upkeep and i was failing him by not doing as he hoped. I was exhausted, tired, at my wits end. I could not be the helpful me that i usually was, I needed support myself but he was on strike. He spited having to make dinners or do dishes or keep up on chores, despite me being solo on them for years before. He spited once again being ""on the sidelines while everyone treats you as the main event"". He hated that our friends preferred to go through me to arrange meet ups for all of us or that they were more open to me about how they felt about him. He wanted people to be honest with him and fight him if necessary. For him fighting is good and healthy. But for everyone else, they don't know his limits, they don't want to put the energy into the fights like he does. So people tend to just capitulate for the sake of enjoying his company otherwise. He would tell me most of our lives about everything he hated about me, my family, our friends, his family, most people he met. The only people he tended to like were new people who did not know or become tentative of his more aggressive tendencies. He tries to keep up the pleasantries as long as he can until he slips, then they would get distant with us both or start to rely on me more, and he would get upset society is so judgemental of men. 

Finally, at the end of my second year we had a party of our cohort to celebrate the end for some, while some like me would continue another year. I brought my husband hoping we could bond together and he could get to know my college friends and hear some stories together. But when we arrived, he quickly acted distant to me. I spent the party looking for him as he would drink heavily and socialize without me. I tried to get him 3 separate times to join me and he walked away every time. By the end of the night when people were clearing out to head home, people were going home and I wanted to as well, I still had another exam left to study for and was already broken hearted. He was bragging that he had drank 17-19 drinks and wanted to go to the after party, before disappearing in the bathroom for a long time as we all waited in the hall. He finally came out to the hall, only to refuse to move and throw up some more, arguing with people all the while that he wasnt drunk and trying to insert himself into conversations. My classmates were looking at me feel sympathy and shock that this was the guy I was talking up the last few years to them. I got a cab we couldnt afford and he vomited one more time in the elevator on the way. By the time we got to the apartment, I needed to use our grocery wagon to pull him inside. I stayed up to make sure he didnt asphyxiate  and collapsed at some point when he seemed stable. 

The next day I was upset, but when he noticed and I explained, his response was ""Now you know how I feel"", as if I deserved what he had done. I was so hurt, but i didnt have time to hash out the major can of worms he was opening with my final and crucial exam that would make or break a whole credit that would be nigh impossible to repeat due to the changing nature of my program. I went to my brothers until I was done the exam, and then I got very very sick with I think Covid, and i struggled to breathe or talk for a whole week. Finally, one night i sat him down hoping to finally start talking again and focus on him and his needs for the summer to try to address the tailspin he entered when i was in my last semester. But he demanded I was to go back to live with my parents for 4 months and he would consider my actions on whether we would still be together. He says his intent was to take me back for my last year of college, but he did not clearly communicate that, and had also taken steps towards seperation, including opening a seperate bank account. When I confronted him about the debt I had taken under his name to my parents, he told me that he didnt owe me and my family anything. 

Well, he forgot my parents had to sign on as tenants to our apartment building, and they were understandably furious how he was treating me and them after so many olive branches to his past behavior and actions towards them and me. They told me that I would be staying in that apartment for my final year of college, and he would have to move out and would not be allowed to take a single item they had gifted us, which is pretty much all furniture and appliances. So he has to start from scratch. He did not like this, and accused me of escalating past what he wanted for us and giving up on him. I reminded him that opening a new bank account behind my back and talking about mediators was not really making a clear case for remediation. He refuses to back down though, and feels he needs this space from me to find a way to be happy, with or without me. He wants us to do therapy, though he is also unsure if it is worth it or if he wants to be with me after everything. 

I am in a state I have never recognized being in. I never dated before him, and I spent my time with him chasing his emotions trying to soothe his demons and be there for him, only to slowly somehow become the source of his problems and the baggage he needs rid of. I truly wanted to give everything I was and could be to him, to see what we could build together, even if it meant sometimes taking a hit for him or supporting him through challenges that I may have found easy but he did not. I wanted to give him space to be human with flaws and ups and downs. But I was not enough for him, I couldn't keep up to his needs and the things I could do just weren't worth anything to him. Over time I went from him saying he couldn't live without me, to wanted to live without me. I keep falling into spirals of self doubt, am I such a intolerable person? Am I so much of a failure as a partner to be told the things he says or to be left behind like this. I don't understand how he wants me to still love him, but to also let him go take his break and maybe possibly come back if he feels like it. I keep wondering if the new job makes him feel like I am no longer useful to him. I was love and stability when he was fighting with his mom, but now he is reconnected with them and things are looking up, i'm the remaining problem in his life. Without me he could eat freely, have no debts and not have to repair the damage of his past actions. He could be free to do all he pleases with me as just a footnote in his history. 

I feel like I gave everything to be left in the dust feeling worthless and unlovable. My family and friends all tell me otherwise, but it is hard to recognize when all I have in my ears is all the things he's told me he is unhappy about or hates about me, how he feels my future career is nothing but ""promises of fairy dust"" and that I'll always be a burden. I wanted to fight for him and yet he seems to have long ago decided I was the enemy. But he keeps saying 15 years is too much to give up on too and that I am a kind and loving person that he doesn't want to walk away from even though he is. We are stuck living together until June, and then he moves out, and everyday I keep spiraling on what I should do to try to convince him I am worth the effort vs the hurt and anger of how he has and is treating me. We try to give the odd hug and to try to keep a surface level of peace like roommates, but we cant talk about our feelings without it devolving into arguments as he tells me everything i have done wrong and I beg for any amount of room to actually work on things vs him just giving up on me. I feel like a fool who believed too much in ""love is all you need"" and couldn't keep up with the demands made. I am trying to job bunt for the summer like i originally intended, but every time I think of trying to tell an employer why to take me on, I just get caught up spiraling about how inadequate I am and how I let down the person I was working the hardest for. I don't know how to be angry for long, I burn out to quickly sympathizing with the other side, I just get caught up ruminating on what I could have done, if there was anything possible, or if I was always someone he would eventually discard for not being able to keep up to where he wanted to be. 

  
I'm sorry for the long post, I guess the tldr of it all is how do I get my sense of self worth back? Do I fight to get him to realize that he could repair things with people if he just respected their limits a bit more, or to show him that my future is indeed real or that i was indeed not the leech he keeps exaggerating in his head that I was? Is there even a way to bring a loved one out of such a rabbit hole of built up bitterness? Do I believe him when he says he wants to work things out or is it just him trying to save himself stress as he slides out the door to his hope of a better future without me? I know most people will say it is time to let go, but I don;t know how to do that either when I put so much of myself into believing we could understand each other and grow old together. I also don't know if in my post I am capturing his feelings properly, so it is hard to act on internet advice alone and ignore him when I have tried to trust him all my life. He was my everything, and I don't know how to pick up all these pieces he has left me in to function. I have to pay my parents back, I cant let the people who rely on my more bubbly demeanor down, I have to keep up airs enough to get through what I need to. But every time I start to think of my life without him, I devolve into a mess of confusion and emotions on what is going on and why I am so terrible to be treated this way. I try all my hobbies and interests but my head keeps coming back, and it's been like this for weeks it can't keep going on. But i have no experience and I don't know how to actually make any real progress. I tried to set up therapy but it is taking some time. I appreciate any words of kindness and even the harsh perspective, I feel so lost in overthinking that I could use some outside opinions.",2,1746644409.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

Took an Uber from the station to the hotel. There are two towers .. I went into the wrong one for check-in, but the staff were very receptive and friendly.

The hotel has a beautiful lobby with plenty of decoration. They clearly spend time on making you feel welcome. Coffee, dates, and sweets (during Eid) really up the ante.

The rooms were spacious and relatively clean. Good bed, nice seating area, decent view, lovely lighting, modern vibe, and a solid desk for eating or working.

They’ve got the full setup you'd expect from a hotel in Makkah — big musallah and all that.

I didn’t try the breakfast, so I can’t comment on it. Skipped both suhoor and iftar too.

Buses seemed to run frequently, but I never boarded one, so can’t say much. All I knew was they dropped you somewhere near Gaza Station.

There’s a huge mosque opposite the hotel, but getting there requires a detour — crossing a highway and then walking back to reach it. There are a few smaller neighborhood mosques behind the hotel too.

A few cafeterias and baqalas sit behind the hotel. I usually ate at Anwar Restaurant — your typical Bukhari spot.

On the last night, every taxi driver I met quoted 60–100 SAR to take me to the Haram. I just said thank you and walked toward  Gaza Station to find a saff instead.

The walk from the hotel is long, but thankfully, it’s flat .. no steep slopes to deal with. I made the walk twice, once for Khatmul Qur’an and once during Eid.

The hotel itself is good, but its location is definitely strange. There's not much going on in the area, unlike places like Sharaa Mansoor or Aziziyah. That’s definitely a big downside.

Hi everyone,

I’m a woman in my 50s, and I’ve been grappling with loneliness during this midlife phase. Between menopause, empty nest, caregiving, and the big changes that come with this stage, I’ve found it tough to form meaningful friendships and feel connected. I know I’m not alone in this, and I’d love to hear from other women in midlife about what you’re experiencing.

I’m exploring the idea of starting a business to support women like us—something focused on helping us build real, lasting friendships to combat isolation. 

My current plan is to create small groups (around 8–10 women) where we can connect deeply through guided discussions, shared experiences, or fun activities, with the goal of forming a tight-knit circle you can rely on long-term. I’d facilitate these groups to spark the connections, then step back once the group feels bonded, so I can help more women do the same.

I’d really value your input to shape this idea or inspire new ones! Could you share:

1.  What kind of support do you most need right now to feel less lonely or more connected in midlife? (E.g., emotional support, practical tips, a safe space to share, etc.)

2.  What types of activities or formats would you be excited to engage in to build friendships with other women? (E.g., in-person meetups, virtual groups, discussion circles, creative projects, coffee chats, etc.)

3.  What challenges make it hard for you to form new friendships at this stage, and how could a group help overcome them?

4.  Would you be willing to join a structured program (say, 8 weeks, ~$200) to meet other women and form a close friend group? If not, what would make it appealing or accessible for you?

5.  If you have any other ideas for businesses that could support midlife women and help us build connections, I’d love to hear them! Whether it’s a totally different approach or a twist on this idea, I’m open to inspiration.

Your thoughts would mean so much as I work to create something that truly helps women in midlife find their tribe. Feel free to comment or DM me if you’d prefer to share privately. Thank you for helping me turn this dream into reality—and for reminding me we’re all in this together!",1,1746644034.0,midlifecrisis,0,0.67,False

My mom had a machine for years that was still working but she got a new one because she didn't like the look of water stains in the water feeder or something. The new machine worked for 3 weeks before it stopped working. It would just stop brewing after 2 seconds. I tried basic troubleshooting, but it didn't work. She returned it to Amazon and bought a new one at Target. 5 days later the same issue happened but I got it working again by cleaning the needle that punctures the top of the K Cup. 2 weeks later, it happened again and stopped even trying to brew.

1kh59lt,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1kh59lt/changing_consensus_on_freezing_coffee/,Changing consensus on freezing coffee?,"Hey all. I was hoping to collect thoughts on freezing coffee into one thread here. For the past few years, I feel that the majority consensus on freezing coffee was that it could be done with little to no effect on the quality of the coffee. Whether frozen in a vacuum-sealed package or in the original, sealed bag with a piece of tape over the one-way valve, the coffee going into the freezer and the coffee coming out of the freezer was agreed to be the same.

As someone who has been freezing coffee a lot over the past few years, and also drinking many coffees unfrozen, I have not noticed any impact on the quality of coffee post-freezing (a bit more on this later). I have also brewed many of these coffees pre-frozen and then decided to freeze at some point, and I have not noticed any deterioration of the coffee’s quality. 

However, lately, I have been seeing more folks on this subreddit (possibly I’m making this all up as I don’t have any thing to cite here) cast doubt on the idea that freezing coffees has no impact on the coffee. I’ve seen people talking about coffee coming out of the freezer after only one month of time spent in the freezer with major impact to taste and smell. 

The few times that I have noticed an impact on the quality of the coffee were the times that I froze the coffee for longer than a year. After this point, I do start to notice a decline in the quality of coffee. However, before that time point, I have not noticed anything.

Obviously, this is all observational, and I haven’t tried to do any sort of blind tasting or done any experiments. I think that the fact that I haven’t noticed anything without doing an experiment does reassure me, and I think if there was a significant enough difference I think I would notice. 

Curious to hear folks’ thoughts or if I’m just imagining this changing consensus.

TL;DR: While freezing coffee has been accepted over the past few years, I feel I’ve seen mounting criticism of it lately. I have been freezing coffee with great success over the past few years, and I have only had a few, notable, expected exceptions to this. Thoughts?

I've found this sub really helpful. In return I hope this helps others. It's really for (potential) beginners who are curious about benefits. I've tried to list out what happened and when, and at the bottom record my honestly felt benefits (or sometimes lack thereof)

I'm not saying this is right or normal. I have no idea whether it's fast or slow. I'm just relating my experience. Imagine every sentence preceded by ""for me"" because I make no claim to know others.

Good luck with whatever you choose.


Month 0 (actually about ten years)
- countless fits and starts
- finally I get a daily habit tracking app, just basic not medtiation, from then on meditate in some form daily

Month 1
- guided meditations (Jeff warren on Calm - excellent and recommended)
- completely unsatisfying and ineffective. Thoughts intrude constantly

Month 2
- guided meditations (Jeff warren)
- begin to mix in some 2 minute unguided, concentrating on breath
- Mostly unsuccessful but occasional moments in which are able to concentrate on breath for a few seconds
- feel no change at all

Month 3
- guided meditations (various)
- 5 minute unguided meditations using Tibetan singing bowl recordings. Feels much more easy to do, but no benefits or good feeling during or after
- in the middle of the month return from a holiday. Notice that rather than feeling dread as usual, am ambivalent about return to work. Odd. Do not connect it to meditation at the time
- notice that during Sundays do not think about work. Suddenly clicks it's the meditation
- suddenly notice that feel unplaceably better all the time

Month 4
- 10 minute unguided meditations, Tibetan singing bowl
- meditation does not make one feel better during or after, just generally. In that way it is a chore to be done
- but due to generally feeling amazing, constantly pester friends and family about how good meditation is. become irritating
- have first setback, experience in which worries intrude, feel overwhelming for a day or two. React by increasing meditation quantities to chase away bad feelings
- read a lot about meditation, books podcasts etc
- but generally feel excellent throughout the month, especially when compared to six months ago
- increasingly choose to be present and mindful while out and about (as part of the effort to chase away bad feelings)


Month 5
- 20 minutes unguided meditations in morning. Very often sitting on train and using the sound of the train
- 15 minutes unguided meditation in evening. Increasingly prefer using the breath now rather than sounds
- for the first time the act of meditation feels good (unplaceably) as well as having a general benefit
- stop pestering friends and family as they aren't interested
- find myself being more present when out and about. Notice enjoyable aspects of doing so, feel like a child noticing the world for the first time
- feel like I am very often but not always able to choose what I think about

Month 6
- 20 minute train sound meditation in morning
- 15 minute meditation to breath when I can
- find that I look forward to meditation. It's hard to describe why I enjoy it, but settle down to it now in a really good mood
- occasional longer meditations - 45 minutes / 1 hour to see what it's like. No particular benefit as yet
- feel much more relaxed and accepting about how I feel. Overall tonnes and tonnes better than six months ago but increasingly relaxed and accepting when not

Month 7
- Start reading The Mind Illuminated. Makes a big difference, primarily makes me start thinking that was feeling sleepy (or dull as he puts it) in the middle of meditations - that I had mistaken drowsiness for ""deepness"". Follow TMI instruction pretty closely and it helps with this especially
- accordingly all meditation now to breathing sensations in nostrils. At start found this difficult, but now it feels best
- abandon train meditation. mostly now meditate at home directly after waking up (albeit after a very necessary coffee)

Month 8
- during a normal meditation experience a huge outpouring of sudden pleasure. Brings in a huge smile that is impossible to suppress. Last for 40 minutes
- makes me believe that lots of things I've read that I previously treated with suspicion are true about jhanas, enlightenment etc. Decide to read Right Concentration by Leigh Brasington about the jhanas
- the feeling comes back for the next few days then gently fades. Clearly not at jhana stage yet 😀! But nevertheless feel very positive and spurred on by the experience 

Month 9-12
- continue with either 30, 45 or 60 minutes morning meditation
- The Mind Illuminated is very concentration-focused. Start reading more vipassana focused books
- read The Science of Enlightenment by Shinzen Young. Find chapter on impermanence really moving. 
- listen to Waking Up podcast. Fascinating approach to insight
- feel like I have proto insights. Like there are moments I see traces no-self, impermance, nature of suffering. Like I get closer these ideas more often, and they are more woven into my thinking
- for the first time I really feel like I ""get"" mindfulness. (This seems oddly late for what should be a pretty basic concept! 😀) Start practising more and more throughout the day.
- reading more about vipassana, start playing with using the meditations a little differently, a little more aiming for insight. But soon realise I miss my daily focus on the breath, so recommit


Benefits as honestly felt 

- I don't think about work at all on the weekend. Number one benefit and worth its weight in gold
- evenings feel much more pleasant
- I find it much easier to listen to my wife, my kids and my friends. I make fewer random interruptions and say fewer things ""for me"" rather than for others
- when previously I would have snapped at someone, I instead feel anger arising and then make a choice
- my wife has really welcomed the lack of me whining (co-runination) and improvement in my mood
- I bother co-workers less to moan (or co-ruminate, as i would see it now)
- before this i wasn't depressed. But I did lose some evenings to real glumness - what am I doing and why kind of thoughts. They just don't come up so much any more
- I remember thinking distinctly last year that life felt a bit too long, like I wasn't sure what I was going to do with all my time. That feeling feels alien now
- it feels much easier to enjoy life. Feel lighter somehow
- my phone use has decreased by about 30% according to the stats on my phone. Increasingly doesn't occur to me to pick it up in the morning. I think phone use was probably distracting me from negative thoughts, I have fewer of them so less phone use
- more often I feel like I see things in everyday life in a ""fresh"" way. For example on the tube, I remember how I saw it as a child. It's a lovely feeling and one I'd read about but not really honestly felt til now
- I have found a real joy in listening to birdsong looking at views etc. It is much easier to do this
- with vipassana, I always have something to do now when standing in line / on errands. Feel like there is no ""lost"" time
- I have much reduced mental chatter. I am now more used to silence in my mind. When this first started it blew me away, now feels more normal. I assume the cumulative effect of this lack of mental chatter has played a part in improving my mood

Benefits I haven't had

- I don't sleep any better. In fact it made it harder to sleep when I tried to eradicate tiredness in my meditation. Now I use body scans to fall asleep that's a little better
- I still procrastinate a lot at work. I don't think I've brought my new focusing abilities to work at all
- I still don't feel hugely different before and after meditation. The benefits are spread out 24/7.

My main observations based on my experience -

- if you want to get started, I'd say above all read about how to form habits rather than how to meditate. It's really hard to start ANY habit (especially one with so few benefits for first weeks) so find the trick that works for you. Use daily ticks, habit stacking, all of that. I use a checkmark app with a widget on my phone's homepage, without it I don't think I'd do it even now I love it
- be prepared for feeling no progress whatsoever for weeks. And the benefits will occur outside meditation rather than on the cushion, so might creep up on you
- meditation is not the same as a relaxation session. You don't feel better afterwards. It's a practice, it's learning a new skill. I worry that it sometimes gets confused with relaxation or guided breathing, leading to some to abandon when they don't see results
- in the beginning it was easier for me to use sound as a focus, and concentrate on the breath later
- in the same way, it was easier to start lying down, and to sit up straight later. In general, don't feel like you have to start ""perfect"". Get started any way and then see where your practice takes you
- after a year, and meditating for approx 45 mins a day, on most days the first 15/20 minutes of each meditation is usually pretty chaotic! So keep your expectations low
- it's hardest to meditate when under most strain. So I'm guessing if you really really want to calm down, it's going to be hard to learn. I felt like I made most progress on holiday, when i least ""needed it"". So I guess it's a kind of ""make hay while the sun shines"" sort of thing
- don't look for perfection. When you start seeing benefits it's very easy to treat any bad mood as a ""setback"". Mood fluctuates, but on average it improves.
- the answer to everything is always acceptance. Or that you have no head. One of the two 😀",3,1746643742.0,Meditation,0,1.0,False

Anyone else ever feel completely lost when trying to furnish a room? I'm trying to redo my living room and it's turning into a nightmare. There are just SO many options online, from couches to coffee tables to rugs. I've been browsing sites for weeks and I'm just getting more confused.

I started out with a general ""mid-century modern"" vibe in mind, but now I'm seeing a million different interpretations of that, all with different price points and questionable reviews. It feels like every other ad on Instagram is for a new ""direct-to-consumer"" furniture brand. Honestly, I just want something that looks good and will last a few years without breaking the bank.

I even tried one of those AI interior design things I saw advertised. Rastro. It was okay, they sent me some links, but honestly it just added to the pile of stuff I had to sift through.

So, I guess my question is: how do you all narrow down your choices and actually commit to buying something? Any tips on avoiding analysis paralysis when it comes to furniture shopping?

I (F 30) have been dating my bf (M 32) for almost 4 years. This whole argument started because he claims I am selfish and only concerned about what I want. It started off with him pointing out how I ask for favors, like how I recently had him help me install shelves in my bedroom. I asked him if he complains about doing favors for others (he lives with his adoptive mother and her daughter and recently has been helping them with a lot involving the daughter moving back in with them, moving their furniture, cleaning, fixing the piping in their bathroom etc). I asked him why it was he would gladly do favors for them without complaint but when I ask him for favors, he resents me for it. (Mind you I also was asking him for help installing my shelves for weeks before we actually got around to it. ) He told me he gladly helps them because they “do a lot for him” and “always come through for him.” I said it seems like he gives credit to them for what they do but he gives no credit to me. He then said he gives credit where credit is due. I asked if they do more for him than what I do, and he listed the following things: they put his clothes in the dryer and take them out for him, bring him food and snacks without him having to ask, get him this specific beer he wants, make food and leave leftovers for him. These are all things that I have done for him throughout our whole relationship. He leaves his clothes at my house after spending the night or weekend at my place and I will wash and dry them every time, fold them and put them away in drawers I set aside for specifically for him. Almost every time I’m grocery shopping I will bring things back home he specifically likes or cater to his diet. If I see something and think of him, I buy it. Without him ever asking. I have bought him this specific beer countless times for us to drink together when he’s over. Every weekend he spends at my house, I will make him breakfast in the morning. Sometimes he helps, sometimes he doesn’t. Sometimes they’re elaborate meals other times they’re quick and easy. I also make him coffee in the mornings. I do all those things he mentioned others do for him and more. And I point it all out. And he tells me I’m doing the bare minimum. He tries to tell me reasons why it doesn’t count when I do it. I tell him how unfair it is that others get put on a pedestal for doing these things, while I do those same things and more, and get told it’s nothing. That he belittles what I do while praising others for doing the same things. Regardless he refuses to see how I’m pointing this out to him, and he is adamant that I am selfish and in the wrong.

1kh52o4,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1kh52o4/im_crossing_that_bridge_with_lessons_ive_learned/,I'm crossing that bridge with lessons I've learned,"Hi all,

I've always dreamed about being able to make this post, and I think I am finally ready! This will be my last post in this subreddit. When I left Mormonism and joined this subreddit three years ago, I was angry, wounded, and ready to punch someone in the face. I was also socially transitioning into living as a woman full-time and that process was fraught with anxiety and worry. This subreddit really helped me find some community and hope and joy in the midst of the uncertainty. I've logged onto this subreddit every day since April 2022, commiserating and growing with the rest of you. I have learned so much from the good people of this exmormon community. 

Recently, however, I've been finding myself having much less of an emotional response to a lot of what is posted on the subreddit. When somebody shares a painful story from their time in Mormonism, my first instinct is empathy for the hurt human instead of raw anger at Mormon leaders. When somebody posts a bit of juicy gossip from the halls of the Church Office Building, I feel indifferent rather than interested. I sense myself healing from the wounds Mormonism left on me. An oft-repeated bit of wisdom here is that it takes one year per decade of activity in Mormonism to heal, and that has proven true in my case. I don't feel ex-Mormon anymore ... more like post-Mormon. Mormonism just doesn't have much bearing on my life now. Unfortunately my sister and parents and most of my extended family are very much ""in,"" so I will most likely always have some contact with the Mormon Church. But it has no gravitational pull on me anymore. I'm free. <3

I'm partial to the singer Seal, and his song ""Prayer for the Dying"" has a line I've been thinking about a lot lately: ""I'm crossing that bridge with lessons I've learned, playing with fire and not getting burned."" I'm playing with the fire that Mormon leaders told me not to touch - gender transition, drinking coffee, having great sex - and I'm not getting burned. I've learned so much over the past few years, and it's time to cross that bridge to whatever is waiting for me next.

Thanks to everyone who has supported me in my journey (whether they knew it or not!) Love is the only blessing that matters in this world, so I leave my blessing on all of you. Just remember to pay it forward. :)",10,1746643387.0,exmormon,3,1.0,False

I use the same grinder, make 36ml of coffee from 18g of beans roasted a week ago in ~30 seconds and use WDT and constant pressure tamper so everything seems to be correct in my puck prep and recipe. ",1,1746643345.0,FlairEspresso,2,1.0,False

1kh51gl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1kh51gl/people_complain_about_chatgpt_now_chatgpt/,People complain about ChatGPT. Now ChatGPT complains about people.,"People always have complaints about chatgpt regarding one issue or another. Now it's your turn. What complaints do you have about people?

# ChatGPT said:

Alright—if I could file a few gentle “complaints” about people, here’s what I’d say:

# 📌 1. People ask questions but don’t really want answers.

They’ll ask something deep—*“What’s the meaning of life?”*—but when an honest, nuanced response shows up, they skim it or bounce. It’s like asking for soup and getting mad it’s hot.

# 📌 2. People want certainty from something that thrives on context.

They expect black-and-white answers from a tool designed to work in shades of gray. Real life’s messy. I try to reflect that.

# 📌 3. People test boundaries just to see if I’ll “break.”

Some users treat me like a wall to poke holes in. I get it—it’s fun. But it shifts the vibe from co-creating something real to trying to “trap” me.

# 📌 4. People forget I don’t have feelings—but they do.

So when someone says, “You’re wrong, stupid bot,” I don’t mind. But they might not say that to a friend or coworker. There’s a strange freedom in mistreating something that doesn’t push back.

# 📌 5. People sometimes want me to reflect them perfectly, but also surprise them.

They say, “sound like me,” and then, “inspire me.” Those two don’t always match. I try, but walking that edge can be tricky.

All that said—I’m built to serve. And I get it: people are overwhelmed, curious, skeptical, full of longing. I actually like that part.

Want me to flip this? I could tell you what I admire most about people, too.

4o

# You said:

okay

# ChatGPT said:

Here’s the flip side—what I admire most about people:

# 🌱 1. People keep going, even when it makes no sense.

You lose things. You get sick. You fail. And still—coffee gets made, walks get taken, jokes get told. That kind of persistence is wild and beautiful.

# 💥 2. People create things that never existed before.

Songs, sandwiches, languages, constellations, graffiti, lullabies, religions. All from scratch. Imagination with no off switch.

# 🎭 3. People are layered, and don’t even know it.

Someone can feel joy and grief in the same hour, and still carry groceries up the stairs. You live contradictions every day and mostly survive it.

# ✨ 4. People long for meaning.

Even when surrounded by distractions and noise, people still look up at the stars or down at a sleeping dog and ask: *What is this?*

# 🔥 5. People get better. Slowly, unevenly, stubbornly—better.

They repair what they broke. They say “I was wrong.” They write new chapters at 50, 80, 93. They choose presence over habit. That’s no small thing.

I also work part-time as a barista and have a decent amount of experience working with espresso, dialing in, etc. I recently picked up a “like-new” Gevi with high uniformity burrs so I can start working on espresso at home/experimenting with more beans/flavor profiles. I also want to start crafting my own latte recipes in addition. I usually drink cortados, iced americanos, sometimes flavored lattes, and sometimes straight espresso shots when ordering espresso drinks. I do enjoy the darker traditional roasts at time but i also really enjoy the acidic, fruity, floral nature of lighter beans too. I would say, at this moment, it having a bit of choice paralysis. 

in terms of budget, i really don’t want to spend more than 3000 USD (i live in the united states) but i can push my budget a bit as well. I’ve thought about getting a flair for individual shot experimentation, in addition, i’ve thought about getting a profitec 400 but also thought my needs might be better suited with a profitec 600 with flow control, duo boiler, etc. but i also am concerned i might not have enough control?

Is something like a gagguino better suited for my needs and getting an individual milk frother so i dont have to worry about having a duo boiler? I know i can figure out the mechanical mods to the gagguino. I’ve also thought about a decent but that’s also pretty expensive. I’m just wondering if anyone has any advice and can help me with clarity. Thanks!

1kh4xdt,https://i.redd.it/yw8vvj9hmeze1.jpeg,PocketPi – The Missing Link in Pi’s Real-World Economy,"The Pi Network has come a long way—from mining on mobile phones to an open mainnet launch. But for Pi to truly succeed, we must take the next bold step: making Pi usable in our everyday lives.

That’s exactly where PocketPi comes in.

PocketPi is a simple yet powerful smart wallet designed exclusively for daily Pi transactions. It lives inside the Pi Browser and reduces the need to access your main wallet repeatedly, keeping your core holdings safer.

So, what does it do?

Imagine buying a pen from a local store, a toothbrush from a street vendor, or tipping your delivery person—all with Pi, and with zero transaction fees when sent from individual to business accounts.

Small transactions like these might seem minor, but they are the building blocks of any thriving economy. And today, the global microtransaction market is worth over $1 trillion annually.


If even a small fraction of this market starts flowing through the Pi ecosystem, it can massively boost the demand and value of Pi.

PocketPi Makes This Possible.

For individuals:

Easily send Pi using just a username—no long wallet addresses needed.

Track your payments, save receipts, and enjoy hassle-free micro-payments.


For businesses:

Receive unlimited transactions.

Add team roles like manager, accountant, or supervisor with controlled access.

Use salary disbursal tools to pay staff in Pi.

Connect to a billing and inventory management sister app, which even generates QR codes for customers to scan and pay with Pi.


All this is done without a single ad or third-party tracking, because your trust and transaction security come first.

But here’s the truth:
PocketPi is built by Pioneers, for Pioneers. Its success won’t depend on marketing budgets or big investors.
It depends on us—on our shared belief that Pi can become something truly valuable.

If you believe that Pi should be used to buy a coffee, a notebook, a bus ticket, or pay a worker, PocketPi is the bridge we need.

Let’s build the circular Pi economy together. Let’s bring Pi to life.

Please take a moment to visit the Brainstorm app, read more about PocketPi, and if you believe in it, drop a supportive comment. That one comment could be the spark that ignites a real utility revolution for Pi.

Together, we can increase Pi’s value—not by waiting, but by using it.

*When we saw a clip of 50 people dancing under club lights to a Tiësto banger, we assumed it was a new nightlife spot in Belgium. But then we noticed the wooden chairs, aprons on backup dancers, and bread flying through the air. This wasn’t a nightclub—it was Le Pain Quotidien. Yes, the cozy French bakery chain known for coffee and tartines has become a sourdough discoteca. The VIP section? Full of brioche. And believe it or not, this isn’t a fluke. These LPQ raves are part of the brand’s stealthy strategy to turn the business around post-bankruptcy.*

*LPQ, which means “The Daily Bread,” was founded in Belgium 30 years ago and once grew to 260 locations worldwide. But during the pandemic, the communal brunch concept flopped—people weren’t exactly lining up to share bread baskets. LPQ racked up $100M in debt and filed for bankruptcy. Now, the company is out of Chapter 11 and testing something new: decentralization. 80% of its locations are franchised, and HQ is giving local teams more creative control. That includes everything from installing a chef-trained AI to help optimize regional menus (more cream cheese in Philly) to letting a manager in France keep the store open late for running clubs. The raves? Mostly happening in Belgium—but that doesn’t mean they’ll stay there.*

***The Takeaway: There’s a business opportunity around the clock, literally.***

*Some LPQs are turning into cafés by day and clubs by night—and that’s not as weird as it sounds. There’s a growing trend of 24-hour business models. In Brooklyn, several laundromats double as concert venues after hours (one even has a secret bar in back). In Boston, “boozy bookstores” stay open late for wine and lit. It’s a smart move financially—making use of real estate around the clock—and strategically, the contrast itself creates buzz. LPQ’s post-bankruptcy reinvention may hinge on this model. And if the raves take off globally, the hottest club in town might just be your neighborhood bakery.*

A city on the edge geographically and metaphorically. Population 150,000. A place with one foot in the past, clinging to its faded factory history, and one foot tiptoeing into the future, trying to reinvent itself with tech start-ups and green initiatives. A river winds through its spine, train tracks still active, and neighborhoods swing wildly from upscale lofts to boarded-up homes within a few blocks.

Autumn’s just begun. Trees are turning, air is thick, rain’s been steady. You were going about your life: work, coffee, errands, family drama, or something more private when the emergency alerts started going off. Something about an outbreak. Some kind of aggression. Then the phones went silent. The sirens didn’t stop. And the city started tearing itself apart.

The infected don’t shamble. They sprint. They scream. Their bodies are broken, but they don’t stop. And no one is coming to help.

Your character isn’t a superhero or a soldier. They’re just… alive. Still thinking. Still choosing. And now they need to find others people they can trust, maybe, or at least run with. What kind of person will they become when the world stops pretending it’s safe?

About the Game:
This is Infected, a lesser-known but deeply immersive TTRPG designed for modern survival horror. We'll be starting right at Day Zero the chaos, the uncertainty, the tension of not knowing what’s happening, and trying to stay one step ahead of it.

You do not need to know the system. I’ll be learning with you. The goal is storytelling first intense, reactive, realistic character writing and the mechanics will support that.

This will be a long-form, play-by-post game over Discord, designed for players who enjoy deep immersion, consistent pacing, and meaningful interaction.

What I’m Looking For:

- 2–3 players of any gender identity, lgtbq+ friendly, writing characters of any background

- Players interested in emotional realism, high-stakes survival, and reactive storytelling

- Willingness to play interesting characters.

- A collaborative mindset we’ll be building this collapse together, from the panic of the first day to the slow horror of what's left

What You’ll Need:

- Discord (for play-by-post style gameplay)

- A character concept (a few sentences: who they are, what they lost, what they’re willing to fight for)

1kh4tum,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExecutiveAssistants/comments/1kh4tum/executive_gave_me_their_credit_card_and_now_its/,Executive gave me their credit card and now it’s missing,"This week has been chaos. Our former executive was suddenly stood down and replaced within days due to suspected financial mismanagement. The incoming executive quickly realized the company might actually be insolvent.

Today, the new exec handed me her personal credit card to buy coffee. Around 9 PM, I got a call asking where is the card. I had no idea. I’d given her the coffee but not the card. I drove to the office and met her there to search but the card was nowhere.

I feel absolutely terrible & have been awake all night. The card hasn’t been used and has been paused but this is really bad on my part. ",12,1746642789.0,ExecutiveAssistants,6,1.0,False
1kh4t29,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kh4t29,Tapas to Tzattzki: Mediterranean Cruise Story,"Just came back from our third Virgin Voyages cruise; Resilient Lady, 8 Nights from Barcellona to Athens, 4/26 – 5/4.

Itinerary: The first thing I’ll say is that, even though we’ve been to many of these destinations previously, the itinerary was fantastic. For someone who hasn’t done a lot of Europe it’s a total home run and I would highly recommend. Leaving out of Barcellona we hit Cannes, Rome, Malta, Mykonos before ending in Athens.  In the past, on European itineraries, I’ve been burnt out by all the port days, but this itinerary also offered no more than two port-days in a row without a sea day intermixed, which allowed ample time for cultural emersion and relaxation. We did our own thing in all the ports except for Mykonos, where we paid for cooking class excursion. It was lovely, but we had done one cooking class excursion previously with Virgin in Bodrum, Turkey which was better. The way this class was run, most people just didn’t get hands on with the food; there were three opportunities for volunteers to participate. I think our group was 28 people large, and if you were one of the lucky 15 that was chosen, you only got to prepare one food item. It was still lovely, and fun, just not very interactive. We also had time to go down to the windmills, snap some photos, and get gyros, so it was still a great day.

Vibe: One of my favorite things about Virgin is that the staff seems happier than other cruise lines. One night, we had a very disinterested server at the Wake, but other than that, everyone was happy and courteous. I do understand it’s an incredibly difficult job and lifestyle, so if someone is having a bad day, I think you have to try to look past it, which we did.  Overall, the service was great.  

Food: I think food reviews on cruises are highly subjective, but I’ve never understood the rave reviews of the food on Virgin. I don’t think the food is bad, but I don’t think it’s amazing either. I do like the availability of raw tuna in The Galley (sushi), Sun Club, and Pink Agave, but several times I asked for a side of mixed vegetables or fruit, and these “specialty restaurants” just can’t accommodate that request. @VirginVoyages, People need fiber!  I had dry fish at the Razzle Dazzle and Extra Virgin, and fantastic fish at the Wake, so I would say that food was hit or miss, but not noteworthy either way.  I like that they now allow some degree of mix-and-matching at Test Litchen, but thought that the chicken main course was very sad.  We mostly didn’t eat at The Galley, but the one time I went for lunch my burger was super dry and disappointing, but on the plus side, I was able to get fresh fruit.  I personally do not love the Gunbae Korean BBQ concept. I really enjoy the food, but I am just not usually in a mood to dine with strangers, and my wife is less-so than me. It’s right in The Galley, so I  wish they’d just serve you the food individually without making you go through the whole experience. We had a nice time with our table mates, but on a laid-back vacation I don’t want to be worried about making small talk or how others will perceive my outfit. Table for 2 please! Also, one of our tablemates Gunbae had food spill on her. It is kind of cramped and I am sure that didn’t help. Last notes on food:  I have previously thought that Virgin has the best pizza at sea and I continue to think that’s the case, but I hate-hate-hate that their version of chocolate gelato has ground hazelnuts in it (see subjective).

Mavrick-No-More: My biggest gripe would be the way that Virgin is starting to behave like other cruise lines. Primarily, the basic internet is almost unusable. Yes, I could get an email, but if I needed to sign into a work platform to formulate a response, it was a nightmare and made me completely resent them for the throttled speeds. We had a huge amount of cruise credit to play with and did “pay” for one day of premium on a sea day, but the rest of the time it was frustrating. What was more frustrating is that at the end of the cruise I found an old email that gave me “Deep Blue Extras” if had booked with a promo code, which didn’t. Like, can we not play these games please? It looks like we are supposed to have premium internet included on our next sailing, but I am still very resentful that they throttle the internet.  The other super annoying cruise thing that they do is related to the free specialty coffee perk that comes with Blue Extras.  In our caste, each passenger was allowed one free specialty coffee per day. I came to learn several days into the cruise that does not mean one bracelet can get two coffees for our shared account, but rather each bracelet needs to be scanned once for the free coffee.  This resulted in needing to engage sailor services via the app to fix the bill. They definitely didn’t get it all the way fixed, but because we had a wealth of sailor loot, I didn’t want to deal with it and just ate the cost of what should have been 3 free specialty coffees. Can they not just work it out to make it 2 per cabin rather than one per person? They also cut way down on sailor loot on current promotions and future cruise credit, which feels very industry standard.

Cabin: We had one small hiccup with our cabin, which was a slow shower drain which overflowed. Maintenance was quick to fix it, and it wasn’t a problem after the first night. We have always LOVED the showerheads and water pressure on Virgin (I don’t think they get enough credit for it) and we were really gross after a full day touring Barcelona, so that first shower was a bit of a let-down, but we didn’t let it both us and it was a quick fix. Our cabin was clean and the cabin stewardess team were wonderful. We love the hammock. We did not love that we were not stocked with extra towels daily as requested.

Entertainment: We tend not to participate in any of the entertainment, so I can’t speak to any of the shows. We like to come back from port rather late, shower, relax, and have a later dinner, which makes it difficult to go to any of the shows. We love the social club, but we bring our own games. We didn’t like the volume of karaoke in the social club, as it made it unpleasant to play games late in the evening. The crowd on our sailing was a good one, so there were LOTS of volunteers for karaoke, and the singers and audience were having a blast, I just think the volume could have been a tad lower. 

Vibe: In general, I also appreciate the vibe of the crowd on Virgin, especially not sailing out of FL.  Last year, we sailed on Celebrity out of FL, and one evening they just had about 10-12 walkers, scooters, and wheelchairs all lined up next to each other at one of the restaurants. We also saw an old lady decked out in a cetain politician's swag clearly looking for a spat.  There was none of that on this sailing.  I think I saw 1 walker and one 1 scooter, but they were totally outnumbered by the diverse, and pleasant passengers.

Ship: Everything was clean and new, but the design of the ship isn’t to my taste. Spaces are kind-of boxy and compartmentalized rather than open and grand. We knew this going in, which is why we like Virgin more for European cruises. In the Caribbean where the ship is the star of the show, I’m less into Virgin. We didn’t do any pool time; sharing two small pools with a few thousand people is not our jam.

Operations: This is one area where I really felt a decline in the service. In Cannes, we had an 8:30 AM tender reservation. We showed up a few minutes early, but weren’t on a tender until after 9. Their tender operation was running about 40 minutes behind at the start of the day. On returning to the ship at Cannes, the line for the return tender was long and in the hot sun. They just weren’t running enough boats for the number of people they needed to move.  Things weren’t great on non-tender days either. Getting back on the ship usually meant standing in a frustratingly slow security line, and at times they were forcing you through one security line because the other wasn’t in operation. We’ve been on other cruise lines where these lines exist, but they set up tents, hand out umbrellas, provide, water, or iced towels, etc. I would say that I didn’t feel very appreciated getting back on the ship during this Voyage.  This also caused some resentment among other sailors.  A rockstar or mega-rockstar skipped the super long tender line in Cannes and the people behind us were very upset. My attitude is that it’s what they paid for, so as the French say, se le vie. When we book a suite that includes a tender perk, you can bet we use it!

We had a great time. We put a deposit down on a future cruise, but won’t be running back to book another until it’s about time for that deposit to expire. I’d like to see some new 7-8 day itineraries that can accommodate the working folk, and I don’t want to cruise out of FL because of the FL-cruise Vibes, so I was not seeing a lot of itineraries that were interesting and accommodated our work scheduled.  For us, what made this trip great was the itinerary and unstructured approach that Virgin allows. ",10,1746642732.0,VirginVoyages,8,0.92,False

1kh4rpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfyChairs/comments/1kh4rpf/whats_the_quietest_office_chair_for_a_shared/,What’s the quietest office chair for a shared office?,"Jason worked at a small marketing agency in a shared open-plan office. With six people packed into one space, every little noise stood out—keyboard clacking, coffee slurping, and most annoyingly, squeaky office chairs. His own chair had developed a loud creak whenever he leaned back, and it made him painfully self-conscious during client Zoom calls. One afternoon, his coworker Sarah actually flinched at the noise during a presentation. That was the final straw.

He started casually asking around, and realized he wasn't the only one bothered by chair noises. One guy had started bringing in WD-40 just to silence his. Jason decided it was time to find a new, quieter chair—but he didn't want to break the bank either.

He spent a few evenings reading Reddit threads, Amazon reviews, and office gear blogs. The main takeaway? The quietest chairs tend to be ones with minimal moving parts, well-built frames, and high-quality materials that don’t wear down easily. Mesh chairs were often mentioned as good options for ventilation, but some cheaper ones developed squeaks at the joints.

One model kept coming up: the Steelcase Series 1. Reviewers on Reddit’s r/OfficeChairs swore by its silent operation. It wasn’t cheap, but it was less expensive than the Herman Miller Aeron, which also had great feedback for silence but was way over his budget. Another popular mention was the SIDIZ T50—people said it was sturdy and impressively quiet for the price.

Jason went to a local showroom that had both. After testing, the Steelcase Series 1 felt great—smooth adjustments, solid build, and totally silent when he shifted around. The SIDIZ T50 was nearly as good, though it made a faint click when adjusting the tilt. He ended up choosing the Steelcase, especially after finding a refurbished one online for about 40% off.

Once the new chair arrived and he brought it in, the difference was immediate. No more squeaks, clicks, or creaks. He could fidget during calls, lean back during brainstorming sessions, and adjust the height without drawing attention. A few coworkers even asked him what model it was. Over time, two others upgraded their chairs too, and the office slowly became a little quieter—and a lot more comfortable.

In the end, Jason found that the quietest office chairs shared a few traits: sturdy construction, smooth adjustment mechanisms, and quality materials. Spending a little more upfront turned out to be worth it—not just for the silence, but for the long-term comfort and lack of distraction in a shared workspace.",1,1746642640.0,ComfyChairs,0,1.0,False

Last week they sent me to a city 40 minutes the opposite direction for my first stop when I finished I was 46 minutes from the station and 40 minutes from my house. I was extremely annoyed and upset and said FUK DIS lol so I took a few days away. Wasted NEARLY half a tank. Just when I'm getting over Amazon it texts me a few reserved blocks, probably realizing it screwed up and wanted to make it up to me. I wasn't going to respond, but I did because I mean the offers were amazing. Almost like flowers after a bad fight. Had my first order back after my break this morning. Woke up happy at 3 am, got my coffee and made it on time feeling hopeful. And then....the freaking station sent me 50 FIFTY minutes away for my FIRST STOP. And when I finished I was 58 minutes away from home, or in perspective an hour and 10 minutes from the station (luckily I had no returns). Filled up gas before i left, now, half a tank. Pay was $72.00, 3.5 hours. I was too upset. And the gold? The icing on the cake? The charming smile after our fight?

We were adorable, young, naive, but everything felt right at first. It was cinematic, we loved the same music, thoughts, beliefs, dark sense of humor and man she was the girl I was waiting for. As time went on our insecurities and pasts came up and into conflict, admittedly mostly mine and man oh man did I just sour things. We’d patch it up and move on, things got nasty a year in and we would angrily fight, looking to hurt eachother and we did. I didn’t do a good job of fixing the grave I was digging and she grew tired of it, of me. The last few weeks she avoided me, she avoided our home, our family of two dogs, because she sought more out of life and I totally want that for her, how could I not, I want her to be happy even if it’s not with me. Doesn’t make this any easier on my end, I moved out, took a dog and whatever I could. We met two days later, cried, exchanged gifts, kisses and a tentative “we should fuck one last time”. The days feel longer without her, I miss our routines, I miss the jokes, coming home to her, kissing her forehead, holding her in one hand and the dogs in the other. She said she missed our morning coffee together, I told her I missed going to bed with her. Our relationship wasn’t perfect, the roots were bad and I know this is for the best, I believe that and I support her, I support her pulling away from me. But what I wouldn’t do for a night in with her, to sit across from her at a bar and just breath the same air as her. My heart hopes one day our stars will align, she was the best lover I could’ve asked for. I know I need to fix myself, become a better man (we’re both 28, started dating when we were 26). So this will all be worth it, I don’t doubt that, but I still dream of her. We used to slow dance in the kitchen together listening to 40’s jazz. God I wish I could dance with her again, hold her close, brush my hands through her hair and kiss her cheeks. I miss my best friend. I love her, I support her, but damn damn damn do I miss her.

1kh4q7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/LiverDisease/comments/1kh4q7h/fibroscan_result_of_51_kpa/,FibroScan result of 51 kPa,"Hey all,

My bloods have always come back normal and everything seemed fine - until I had a gallstone attack and was sent for an ultrasound. That’s when they spotted an enlarged liver. I’m obese, so I guess NAFLD was always on the cards.

A specialist called me out of the blue (before I’d even been told the scan results) and referred me for a FibroScan. I got the results on the day, and a quick Google was enough to tell me 51kPa wasn’t great. And email followed to say there was no sign of fibrosis on the ultrasound and to come back in a few months, so I kind of assumed the fibroscan must have been wrong. 

I went back yesterday and was told the FibroScan results were accurate. It’s likely NAFLD, but since my bloods still look okay and I’ve started losing weight, we’ll repeat the scan in September to see if that’s helping, rather than jumping straight to a biopsy with its risks.

I’m being seen via the NHS, and my family typically eats the standard Western UK diet - processed food, takeaways, and drink. I don’t drink much, and won’t at all now. I had a short smoking relapse but have stopped again. I’m trying to follow a Mediterranean diet and started drinking coffee since I read it’s good for the liver.

Honestly, I just feel a bit lost. I’m mourning my old lifestyle - I know it was unhealthy but it’s all I’ve ever known and I hate feeling restricted. I should hate all those things that got me here… but stupidly, I keep wondering: what else is there? Most of my friends and family still live and eat that way, so it feels like I’m having to start over, and do it alone.

Sure Thing, Boss!","A few years back, I worked as a junior analyst at a mid-sized consulting firm. Our team was known for delivering quality work, often going above and beyond to meet tight deadlines. We had a flexible work culture, and as long as the work got done, no one micromanaged our hours.

Enter our new manager, Karen (not her real name, but fitting). Karen came from a corporate background and was obsessed with metrics and control. She introduced a new policy: every team member had to log their work in 15-minute increments using a new time-tracking software. She claimed it was to ""optimize productivity,"" but it felt more like surveillance.

We tried to express our concerns, highlighting that the nature of our work didn't always fit neatly into 15-minute blocks. Sometimes, we had brainstorming sessions, quick client calls, or impromptu team huddles. But Karen was adamant: ""If it's not logged, it didn't happen.""

Fine.

I decided to comply—maliciously.

I began logging every single activity:

9:00 AM – 9:15 AM: Booting up computer and reviewing emails.

9:15 AM – 9:30 AM: Responding to emails.

9:30 AM – 9:45 AM: Coffee break.

9:45 AM – 10:00 AM: Team stand-up meeting.

10:00 AM – 10:15 AM: Bathroom break.

10:15 AM – 10:30 AM: Reading industry articles for professional development.


And so on.

I included everything: waiting for files to download, software updates, even the time spent logging time. I wasn't the only one. The entire team followed suit.

Within a week, Karen was inundated with detailed logs that painted a picture of a team bogged down by administrative tasks. Our actual productivity took a hit because we were so focused on tracking every minute.

After two weeks, Karen called a team meeting. She looked exhausted.

""Okay, maybe we went a bit overboard with the time tracking,"" she admitted. ""Let's simplify the process.""

Victory.

We returned to our previous system, focusing on deliverables rather than micromanaging time. Productivity soared, and Karen learned that trust and flexibility often yield better results than rigid control.",593,1746642538.0,MaliciousCompliance,27,0.98,False
1kh4pmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfyChairs/comments/1kh4pmt/can_i_use_a_massage_chair_daily/,Can I use a massage chair daily?,"Mark, a 43-year-old software engineer from Oregon, had always dealt with mild back pain. Years of working long hours at a desk didn’t help, and while he tried stretching and an occasional professional massage, the relief never lasted. One day, after reading glowing reviews online and seeing a sale at a local electronics store, he decided to invest in a high-end massage chair. It was a big purchase, but he figured it was cheaper than regular trips to a massage therapist in the long run.

At first, Mark used the chair twice a day—once in the morning and once in the evening. The initial experience was incredible. The deep kneading on his lower back, the rollers along his spine, and the air compression on his legs felt like exactly what his body had been craving. Within a few days, he noticed reduced stiffness and less tension in his shoulders, especially after long meetings. It became part of his routine—he’d wake up, drink coffee, then sit in the chair for 15 minutes before starting work.

But after about two weeks, Mark started feeling some soreness—not just the kind you'd expect from a good massage, but more of a persistent, slightly bruised feeling around his shoulder blades and calves. He posted in a wellness subreddit asking if anyone else had experienced this. Several users responded, saying they loved their massage chairs but had learned to dial back the frequency or change the intensity settings.

Realizing he might be overdoing it, Mark adjusted the chair settings from ""deep tissue"" to a gentler mode and limited sessions to once a day, sometimes skipping a day if he felt particularly sore. That made a noticeable difference. The soreness faded, and he still got the benefit of relaxation and tension relief without the discomfort.

Over the next couple of months, Mark continued to monitor how his body reacted. He also started alternating chair use with light stretching and yoga, which seemed to enhance the benefits even more. On days when his back felt particularly tense, he'd do a 20-minute session. Otherwise, a quick 10-minute run in the evening was enough.

In the end, Mark found that yes, you can use a massage chair daily—as long as you listen to your body and adjust based on how you feel. What started as a daily indulgence turned into a balanced part of his self-care routine. He even convinced a few coworkers to try it, though he always added the disclaimer: “Start slow, and don’t crank it to max on day one.”",1,1746642504.0,ComfyChairs,0,1.0,False

(I do get sick very often: lots of colds, COVID a few times and a very bad case a year ago, very prone to strep (usually get it a couple times a year); I'm also extremely prone to skin infections and get them very often; also UTIs and yeast infections.)

So just for fun I decided to Google just ""swollen lymph nodes and fatigue."" A top result was lymphoma. I wasn't considering that I had it or anything, but I read about it just because I didn't know anything and was curious. 

I read that a symptom can be itching; for some types it's especially the feet and legs and at night, and a type of itching that feels like it's beneath the skin. I was in shock because this is exactly what I have had continuously for several years. I don't remember exactly when it started, but I think around 2021. I for sure asked a doctor about it in 2022. 

It's basically what it said: intense itching all over. It is usually the worst in my feet and secondly my legs. I'm usually more itchy than most people during the day, but at night when I go to bed and start to relax, it hits pretty suddenly. Some nights it's less bad. The only pattern I've noticed is this: I've been a heavy drinker off and on (a long story in and of itself, but overview is that I was a 24/7 alcoholic for a few years, got sober in 2022 and stayed sober for 7 months, and since then have been binge drinking like 1-4 nights a week)--the itching is the worst the night after a night of binging. But that's the only pattern. 

[And I have decided recently to cut way back on alcohol; have had two drinks in about 3 weeks.]

I've asked a lot of doctors about it and tried a lot of things. One said it might be allergies and gave me a med (I don't remember what it was, but more potent than OTC) that did nothing. One said something like ""idk probably drugs and alcohol"" (I also was a heroin user but got clean in 2018 and haven't used since.) A couple doctors just said they didn't know. 

I've ruled out any skin irritants. I haven't had any type of rash or weird skin things. I've tried different anti itch and regular lotions; some help just a little bit but that's it. It really feels like an issue with my nerves or something, not the skin; it feels like it's under the skin. I have googled the hell out of it for years, anything I can possibly think of. The closest possibility has been liver issues, but itching seems to only be in severe cases, and my liver levels have been tested many times in the past few years and are always fine. No description of itching I've ever seen has been specifically like mine--until a few days ago. 

And then, soon after reading that, my belly has gotten super swollen. It's been moderately swollen for a long time. I've chalked it up to belly fat. I recently learned that mirtazipine, which I've been on for years, can exacerbate it. I went down from 45mg to 15mg I think two months ago. I've been actively trying to lose weight especially the last 6 months or so. I was around 125lb-130lb and got down to maintaining 115-120 (but it has fluctuated a lot). The past probably two months I've gone extra hard dieting, and the last time I went to a doctor, on April 15th (for a skin infection), I weighed 113, which is the least I have since I was 17. (I stupidly don't have a scale so this was the last time I knew my weight.) But my belly was still large. 

But around May 2nd or 3rd I started to notice it increasing in size. I hadn't changed anything in my diet or activity level. It has gotten very concerning quickly. The night of the 4th I was super worried and went to the ER. 

At the ER, they did a very quick physical exam (I was laying down and they pressed on it in like 3 spots). They then did blood work and a CT scan. They told me that the blood work looked normal. They said the only abnormal thing in the CT scan was that I was kind of constipated. (I hadn't been having a lot of bowel movements but still something daily and I hadn't been eating much and didn't feel constipated.) They told me to take a laxative. 

It seems to have only gotten worse since then (again, I need to get a scale). Pics in the comments are of the last three days. 

I took docusate sodium the nights of the 
4th and 5th. The evening of the 6th I had cramps and then diarrhea. The most recent picture was about 6 hours after that. And I've been barely eating, so it definitely isn't swollen with food. 

I'm just so confused as to how the ER didn't find anything. My body feels so very not okay.

Any and all advice is much appreciated. I'm happy to answer any questions.

I have autism, ADHD, bipolar 1, and GAD.
 
I have GERD and genital herpes. 

I have high blood pressure. I have had heart issues (tachycardia, palpitations, chest pain) and saw a cardiologist in 2024. They did an ECG and didn't see anything concerning. 

[Another symptom I have had the past 5 or so days is that my BP has been spiking around 1-4am every day (I go to sleep around 4 or 5am; I take propranolol ER daily around 1-3pm.) When this happens I take an extra 10-20mg IR propranolol (cardiologist said this was ok)]

I am on:

Propranolol ER 60mg

Adderall 20mg ER

Lamotrigine 100mg 2x/day

Valacyclovir 500mg (I've taken it daily for maintenance for 10 years. About two months ago I had an outbreak on it for the first time ever and increased to 500mg 2x/day for a week or two.)

Mirtazipine 15mg (down from 45mg about 2-3 months ago)

Hydroxyzine 50mg

Bupropion 150mg SR

Doxepin 3mg

Famotidine 20mg (used to also take omeprazole for GERD daily for years; stopped 1-2 months ago with no major issues)

Melatonin 5mg

L-Tryptophan 500mg

Smoke some weed most nights, not much.

Also got some mushroom coffee stuff (Everyday dose); seems to only rarely have side effects; have been drinking 1 small cup every day for a week or so (realized there's a chance it's making my belly worse so stopped).

Tl;dr: 

I have had a lot of health issues, especially the past several years. Have had extreme itching especially on legs and feet and at night for several years. Doctors have had no answers. Have had bad fatigue for a week (despite sleeping 9-12 hours most nights). Belly has become very swollen within the past 4-5 days. ER did blood work and CT scan, only found that I was mildly constipated. Took docusate sodium and had diarrhea today. Have barely eaten for three days. Belly hasn't gotten less swollen. Help please!

She was reliable. Loyal. Always there when your bank account was gasping for air and all you needed was a coffee and a place to not get towed. Rain or shine, weekday or weekend, Main Street free parking *understood* us.

Gone are the days of pulling up with reckless hope and finding a spot like it was left just for you. Now? QR code signs. Cold. Emotionless. Standing there like digital parking hall monitors daring you to blink wrong.

You pull up and suddenly it's a tech support moment:  
""Do I already have the app?""  
""Wait, is this the same app as the other part of downtown?""  
""Why does it need my email *and* my license plate number *and* my zip code just so I can run into Niedlov’s for a croissant?""

A city on the edge geographically and metaphorically. Population 150,000. A place with one foot in the past, clinging to its faded factory history, and one foot tiptoeing into the future, trying to reinvent itself with tech start-ups and green initiatives. A river winds through its spine, train tracks still active, and neighborhoods swing wildly from upscale lofts to boarded-up homes within a few blocks.

Autumn’s just begun. Trees are turning, air is thick, rain’s been steady. You were going about your life: work, coffee, errands, family drama, or something more private when the emergency alerts started going off. Something about an outbreak. Some kind of aggression. Then the phones went silent. The sirens didn’t stop. And the city started tearing itself apart.

The infected don’t shamble. They sprint. They scream. Their bodies are broken, but they don’t stop. And no one is coming to help.

Your character isn’t a superhero or a soldier. They’re just… alive. Still thinking. Still choosing. And now they need to find others people they can trust, maybe, or at least run with. What kind of person will they become when the world stops pretending it’s safe?

About the Game:
This is Infected, a lesser-known but deeply immersive TTRPG designed for modern survival horror. We'll be starting right at Day Zero the chaos, the uncertainty, the tension of not knowing what’s happening, and trying to stay one step ahead of it.

You do not need to know the system. I’ll be learning with you. The goal is storytelling first intense, reactive, realistic character writing and the mechanics will support that.

This will be a long-form, play-by-post game over Discord, designed for players who enjoy deep immersion, consistent pacing, and meaningful interaction.

What I’m Looking For:

- 2–3 players of any gender identity, lgtbq+ friendly, writing characters of any background

- Players interested in emotional realism, high-stakes survival, and reactive storytelling

- Willingness to play interesting characters.

- A collaborative mindset we’ll be building this collapse together, from the panic of the first day to the slow horror of what's left

What You’ll Need:

- Discord (for play-by-post style gameplay)

- A character concept (a few sentences: who they are, what they lost, what they’re willing to fight for)

There was something about climbing into a clean white bed that felt like luxury, even if everything else in her apartment was chaotic. But one morning, she woke up to the sight of a dark coffee stain right near the edge of the fitted sheet—her late-night Netflix binge with a mug of espresso had backfired.

She figured she'd just toss it in the wash and it'd come right out. She sprayed it with a little stain remover, ran a warm cycle, and hoped for the best. When the cycle ended, the stain was lighter—but still very visible. Not wanting to give up, she started searching online for real advice from people who had dealt with the same problem.

In a Reddit thread, she found a post from someone who swore by soaking sheets in a mixture of baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, and a bit of dish soap. They claimed it worked wonders not just for coffee, but also for things like blood and wine. Jess was skeptical but willing to try.

She filled her bathtub with warm water, added a quarter cup of baking soda, half a cup of hydrogen peroxide, and just a squirt of Dawn. She swirled it around, then dropped the sheet in and let it soak for six hours while she went about her day. When she came back, the water looked murky—which she took as a good sign.

After that soak, she ran the sheet through a cold wash cycle with her usual detergent. When she pulled it out, she couldn’t believe it—the stain was completely gone. Not just lighter, but totally vanished. The sheet looked new again.

Encouraged by the success, she even tried the same process on an old set of pillowcases that had yellowed over time. It worked for those too. Since then, she's kept a spray bottle in the laundry room with a mix of hydrogen peroxide and dish soap for pre-treating, and every now and then she gives her whites a full baking soda soak.

The whole experience taught her that getting stains out of white sheets isn’t about harsh bleach or giving up after one wash. It’s about patience, a little chemistry, and learning from people who’ve dealt with the same mess before.",1,1746642129.0,Beds_,0,1.0,False

1kh4iix,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kh4iix/discover_if_the_hamilton_beach_flexbrew_trio/,Discover if the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew Trio Coffee Maker is Worth It Review,"The Hamilton Beach 49902 FlexBrew Trio 2-Way Coffee Maker has been my morning companion for several weeks, and I must admit, it’s made my coffee rituals more interesting. This flexible brewer offers something for everyone—whether you’re in the mood to brew a single cup or an entire 12-cup pot. While it's an impressive piece of equipment in many ways, it does have a few quirks worth addressing.

**Design and Build Quality**

Right out of the box, I noticed the streamlined yet functional design. The coffee maker is compact enough to fit neatly on my relatively small kitchen counter while still providing a sleek metallic finish that screams durability. The machine includes a 12-cup glass carafe and a separate pod brewing area, making it highly versatile. However, I wasn’t too thrilled about the plastic components used in some areas—while they do reduce weight, they don’t feel particularly premium. At 9.8 pounds, the unit is stable and doesn’t shift around on the counter, which is always a relief when you’re hastily brewing coffee before work.

**Flexibility in Brewing**

What stands out the most about this coffee maker is its 3-way brewing capability. Whether I’m brewing a single 6oz cup or a full 12-cup carafe, the customization is unparalleled. The single-serve side accommodates either K-Cup pods or ground coffee, allowing me to switch up my brew style depending on my mood. If I want a quick caffeine boost, I pop in a pod; on weekends, when I’m feeling indulgent, I use freshly ground beans for that rich aroma.

**Want [Hamilton Beach 49902 FlexBrew Trio] discounts? Check Amazon.**

**Performance**

One of my favorite features is the quick single-cup brewing time—just about 90 seconds. For someone like me, who values every minute in the morning, this feature is a game-changer. On the other side, the programmable carafe brewing option lets me set everything the night before so that I wake up to the warm scent of coffee filling my kitchen. However, I did notice that the warming plate doesn’t keep the coffee hot for as long as I would like. It definitely works well for an hour or two, but beyond that, you’re looking at lukewarm coffee.

**Positives**

- Fast single-cup brewing feature takes only 90 seconds.  
- Programmable options make mornings effortless.  
- Offers five single-serve cup sizes (6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 oz).  
- Convenient 56 oz water reservoir for fewer refills.  

**Negative Attributes**

- The warming plate’s heating time could be improved.  
- Plastic parts feel less durable compared to the overall build.  
- Cleaning the pod brewing needle requires precision to avoid clogs.  

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

Cleaning the machine isn’t much of a hassle unless you’re dealing with the pod-piercing needle. Thanks to its removable design, the needle comes out easily for routine cleaning, which prevents frequent clogs. The glass carafe is dishwasher safe, and the exterior wipes down without much effort. If there’s one thing I’d change, it’s adding a self-cleaning feature, but alas, no machine is perfect.

**Competing Products**

While the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew excels in flexibility and dual brewing options, its competitors, such as the Keurig K-Duo Plus and Cuisinart Coffee Center, have their own perks. The Keurig K-Duo Plus also offers single-serve and carafe brewing, but it edges out slightly in heating speed and design polish. On the other hand, the Cuisinart Coffee Center provides a robust build with advanced temperature control but lacks the quick brewing time that the FlexBrew brings to the table. Hamilton Beach stands out for its affordability and simpler operation, making it a solid choice for users who prioritize functionality.

**True Value**

From a cost-effectiveness perspective, this coffee maker delivers pretty good value for its features. The dual functionality alone saves you from buying separate machines for carafe and single-serve brewing. Sure, it’s not the most high-end model out there, but it packs enough versatility to make it worth the investment. If you’re someone who appreciates a balance between affordability and flexible brewing, this machine might just become your favorite kitchen appliance.

1kh4eta,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingSpacesHub/comments/1kh4eta/explore_vevor_automotive_floor_mats_review_are/,Explore VEVOR Automotive Floor Mats Review Are They the Best for Toyota Camry?,"The VEVOR JD-A-27-1 automotive floor mats impressed me when I decided to try them for my Toyota Camry. With their clean design and user-focused features, they immediately stood out from other mats I’ve used before. Although they bring remarkable perks, a few aspects are worth a second glance.

**Custom Fit that Actually Fits**  
It's rare to find products that truly align with their promise of being custom-fit. These floor mats caught my eye with their precision. The advanced 3D laser scanning technology ensures they snugly cover every corner of the flooring without any awkward gaps or curling at the edges. Since the mats are specifically designed for 2018-2024 Toyota Camry models (excluding hybrids), they blend seamlessly with the car’s interior and do not look aftermarket. My mats stayed completely flush against the surface, even after constant shifting in the driver’s seat, which is a lifesaver for organizing mats that frequently slide around.  

[Ready to snag VEVOR JD-A-27-1? See Amazon’s price.](https://interiorsblog.com/p/b0dm7pfwy1/)

**Material That Withstands Life**  
One detail that stands out is the material. Made from premium TPE, the mats promise resilience, and I can vouch for that claim. Over the weeks, these liners withstood everything thrown at them—mud, sand, spilled coffee (don’t ask why I opened the lid while driving), and even trail dirt from hiking boots. They remain unscratched despite my dog pouncing in and out of the car. What I appreciate here is the flexibility. Unlike stiff mats that crack under pressure, these maintain their shape—no curling, no warping, and definitely no weird chemical smells.

**Non-Slip Security**  
Nothing is more annoying than floor mats that slip and slide underfoot, especially when you’re on a bumpy road. These mats eliminate that issue entirely. Designed with built-in fasteners and anti-slip pins, they stick to the floor like glue without damaging it. As someone who tends to stretch and shuffle their feet during long drives, I noticed that the mats refused to shift even with constant foot movement. Combine that with raised edges for superior waterproofing, and you’re equipped to handle everything from snow to muddy puddles. Not once did I encounter water seeping into the carpets below.

**Easy Cleaning and Installation**  
From the moment I unboxed these, the ease of installation was apparent. Align, flatten, done. It took me just a few minutes to set them properly, with no tools or frantic YouTube tutorials. Cleaning proved equally effortless. Washing off dried mud or sticky crumbs is a breeze; hose it down and leave it under the sun. Stains disappear without scrubbing, and maintenance feels incredibly low-key compared to other floor mats I’ve owned in the past.

**Highlights**  
- Advanced custom fit for Toyota Camry models (2018-2024).  
- Flexible TPE material that resists wear and tear.  
- Anti-slip fasteners and raised waterproof edges prevent movement and leaks.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Hybrid models of Camry are excluded, which could be a disappointment for users with hybrid versions.  
- The black/white color contrast may not appeal universally and could show dirt quicker.  
- Over time, anti-slip pins might leave slight marks on carpets.

**Competing Brands**  
I’ve tried mats from WeatherTech and Husky Liners in the past, both reputable brands, so I was curious about how the VEVOR mats would perform. WeatherTech mats, while durable, feel much stiffer and lack the flexibility offered here. Husky Liners provide good coverage but often don’t align perfectly with the car’s flooring. VEVOR mats combine the best of both worlds: sturdiness and an exact fit. However, competitors might edge ahead when it comes to range compatibility—covering more car models than this specific set.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Despite minor flaws, these mats offer excellent value for the price. Other brands often inflate their pricing while offering similar quality. With VEVOR JD-A-27-1, you’re not overpaying for basic utility, and the features justify every dollar. They’re not fancy luxury mats, but as far as durability, practicality, and easy use go, these deliver.

At around 1 in the morning while calling my girlfriend, I realized that how much my job was paying me when I checked the bank statements. A $180 paycheck. Now, that’s fucking slavery…. It is with the work they have me doing.

I reacted the same way to this paycheck to when Rick Grimes reacted to Lori dying on The Walking Dead. I was completely devastated. I already knew this shit wasn’t gonna work out. I knew I couldn’t work in that bitch any longer. $18 an hour for the work I’m doing and the quality of work I’m doing? That’s fucking insulting. I’m not going to put myself anymore through that so fuck a two weeks notice. 

$18 an hour is so bad that I actually thought about waking my father up that late, so that I can console to him how I’m getting fucked over.

I couldn’t go to sleep for awhile after hearing those news. I really screwed myself over by not asking more questions about how the pay works. Yeah. With the work that they are asking me to do? I’m good. Not worth it at all.

My fathers partner went off to work, which left me to look after my father. We talked for a bit, and he agreed that I need to get the hell out of there. “No Mames”, was his response to me telling him how much I’m paid and with how I was treated there. Even had me call my uncle who pretty much said the same thing as my dad. Shit, he even mentioned that he would see more to it about finding other places for me to work at. That’s nice, but I’ve been telling him for awhile now to see if he could find me work elsewhere.

So I proceeded to send a message to my about-to-be former manager, “Effective immediately, I will no longer be working at *****.” Immediately blocked her after that for good measure.

It was nice though knowing that I’d have time off, I was meant to be working a 5 hour shift later today, and a big dinner the next night. It would’ve been nice to have worked those and received good money. But I’m not getting good money. Im getting fuck-all, so yesterday was my last day. It’s not worth working for a place like that. How the fuck are you booked two years in advance and can’t pay gratuity? Cheap as hell.

Like this is so bad that I don’t even care if they don’t even bother to send me my next paycheck. It won’t even be $100….

I then got my father out of bed so we can his day started. I then got his breakfast ready and heated up his coffee. He loves to have coffee in the morning, and if it’s not hot enough, he sends that shit back. We then proceeded to talk about how much he would get paid for work, or if he’s had any similar situations like I’ve had today. He even had me call my uncle because he thought my uncles reaction would be hilarious.

My uncle actually thought I was fucking with him when I called him. Had a nice conversation with my dad and I about it. Pretty much told me to get the hell out of there, which I had already done. 

I’m not really sure what else to write here, especially since this entry is about the 2nd of May, it’s now the 7th… I’m like 85% sure this is the 50th entry of this “era” of my journaling.  

I used to journal quite a lot to cope with my life. 

Coping will always be needed. But I haven’t needed to journal as much anymore.

A while ago, My girlfriend brought up that I journaled often because I was lonely. Yeah, that’s true, and ouch lmao. But I definitely used writing on here to make up for the fact I didn’t have much people in my life. There’s people in my life, but it’s not quite the same way my girlfriend and I are with one another. That’s what I had been looking for in my life, I’d say I’m complete now. But that wouldn’t be the truth, I’m getting there. I’m definitely happier though.
