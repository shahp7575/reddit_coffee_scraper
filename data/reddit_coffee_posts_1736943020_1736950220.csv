1i1y64j,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1i1y64j/help_with_2_weeks_itinerary_in_colombia/,Help with 2 weeks itinerary in Colombia :),"Hello, my partner and I are travelling to Colombia in March, and we're trying to define the itinerary. We both love adventure, nature, exploring, but also big cities cultural and creative life. We are very active but we don't want to be jumping from place to place everyday. We LOVE walking around, hiking, snorkel and good food.

Also it's important to notice we've never been to the Caribbean or SEA.

We've tried to put together and itinerary that includes mountains, jungle, beach and city. We've also considered other options like Pacific area, Capurgana, Amazonas, Tayrona and Medellin, but we were not able to make a proper plan.

This is the itinerary:

1 - Eje cafetero - Arrive to Pereira around 12h (jetlagged) and pick up rental car

2 - Eje cafetero - Trek in Cocora Valley

3 - Eje cafetero - Visit towns and coffee farm

4 - Eje cafetero - Visit thermal waters and waterfall

5 - Santa Marta - Fly to Santa Marta and explore the city 

6 - Lost City Trek\* - day 1

7 - Lost City Trek - day 2

8 - Lost City Trek - day 3

9 - Lost City Trek - day 4 and sleep in Santa Marta/Minca

10 - Minca + sleep in Minca

11 - Morning in Minca and travel to Barranquilla (sleep in Barranquilla) 

12 - Providencia - Fly to Providencia (arrive around 12h) and chill around the island

13 - Providencia - Scuba day + some exploring

14 - Providencia - Snorkel + kayak

15 - Providencia - Island visit 

16 - Bogota - Fly to Bogota in the morning

17 - Bogota and fly back at 23h

\*We've read many mixed opinions about this trek, but we've read experiences from Spanish speaking people and they seemed very happy about it. We've also considered a multi-day tour in Amazonas, and a trip to Gorgona Island, but they. seemed too difficult to fit in the trip.

If you have any suggestions about the itinerary, or some ideas about places that are a must, please let me know!

1i1y5ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_beautifulmind8494/comments/1i1y5ac/kapsel_transforming_lives_through_every/,"""KAPSEL: Transforming Lives Through Every Transaction""","In an interconnected world where financial transactions occur every second, what if each transaction could do more than exchange value—what if it could transform lives? KAPSEL, an innovative initiative that blends finance, technology, and humanitarian impact, makes this vision a reality. By linking every transaction to a meaningful social cause, KAPSEL is creating a ripple effect of positive change.

# The Power of Purpose-Driven Transactions

Every day, billions of transactions take place, from buying a cup of coffee to transferring funds across borders. These exchanges drive economies, yet many have little to no impact on solving the world's most urgent challenges. KAPSEL changes that by embedding social good into every transaction, ensuring that each financial activity contributes to a larger mission: providing clean water to those in need. **See more:** [**https://linktr.ee/kapselcrypto**](https://linktr.ee/kapselcrypto)

https://preview.redd.it/60c0y41306de1.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=21e224559c01412f52d1d6fa59de8fe46ed7b36b

# How KAPSEL Works

KAPSEL operates on a simple yet powerful premise: each transaction made through its ecosystem generates a small, automatic contribution toward clean water projects. Here's how it works:

1. **Seamless Integration:** Users can integrate KAPSEL into their everyday financial activities, whether through mobile wallets, banking apps, or online payment platforms.
2. **Micro-Contributions:** A fractional amount from every transaction is directed towards verified clean water initiatives. These micro-contributions, though small individually, accumulate into substantial funding over time.
3. **Transparency Through Blockchain:** Leveraging blockchain technology, KAPSEL ensures that every contribution is transparent and traceable. Donors can track their impact in real-time, from initial funding to the completion of water projects.
4. **Smart Contracts for Accountability:** Funds are released only when predefined milestones are achieved, ensuring that projects are completed efficiently and effectively.

# Impact Beyond Transactions

KAPSEL's model transcends traditional philanthropy by turning everyday financial interactions into opportunities for impact. This approach not only democratizes giving but also engages a broader audience in the mission to end water scarcity. Key benefits of KAPSEL's model include:

* **Wider Participation:** Anyone, anywhere, can contribute to clean water initiatives simply by participating in the economy.
* **Scalable Impact:** The model scales with the number of users and transactions, meaning that as adoption grows, so does the positive impact.
* **Sustainable Funding:** Unlike one-time donations, KAPSEL generates a continuous stream of funding, ensuring the sustainability of its supported projects.

# Real-Life Transformations

KAPSEL’s early projects have already begun transforming lives in underserved communities:

* **Ethiopia:** By funding the construction of wells in remote villages, KAPSEL has provided thousands of people with reliable access to clean water, reducing waterborne diseases and improving quality of life.
* **Bangladesh:** In flood-prone regions, KAPSEL has supported the deployment of water purification units, ensuring safe drinking water during natural disasters.

# A Call to Action

KAPSEL's vision is clear: to transform lives through every transaction, creating a world where access to clean water is a right, not a privilege. But this mission can only succeed with the collective effort of individuals, businesses, and organizations.

By choosing to transact through KAPSEL's platform, users become agents of change—transforming ordinary financial interactions into extraordinary acts of compassion and solidarity.

# Join the Movement

Whether you're an individual looking to make a difference, a business seeking to enhance your corporate social responsibility, or an investor eager to support a groundbreaking initiative, KAPSEL invites you to join its movement. Together, we can create a future where every transaction transforms a life. **For more information:** [**https://kapselcrypto.com/**](https://kapselcrypto.com/)

It’s hard to capture just how pretty it is in pictures. The sapphire changes in different lights, which I love.

To those who are worried whether picking/designing your ring (or those worried about including their partner) will still feel special, let me assure you it will!! I viewed the final product at pickup to make sure there were no obvious mistakes and then he took the ring for a TBD proposal. He proposed about a month later. It was still a surprise since I didn’t know when and because I had only seen the ring once, I was still blown away when I saw it again. It remained so very special. I still cried despite knowing he would eventually propose because seeing him get down on one knee and say such meaningful words was everything. Plus, I got the exact ring I wanted. I wouldn’t change a thing. So don’t be scared to pick/design your own ring

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

Last March, my ship was unloading in Bremerhaven for a day or so. The weather was atrocious, as only the weather in northern Germany can be. Freezing cold, biting wind, and driving, horizontal rain to go along with it. The worst of it started just before midnight, and lasted until dawn. As I am the second mate, I had to be working in this weather all night. My only respite was an occasional 15 minute shelter in the Bosuns Locker up forward, where a heater kept the large space a comfortable 45 degrees Fahrenheit, just enough to warm up for a bit before heading back out into the suck.



I had drank about three large cups of coffee to keep myself awake and it was running right through me. I was resting comfortably on a pallet of absorbent pads when I felt unnecessary head call approaching. Soon enough, it was pushing at my bladder, needing release. It was a good 5+ minute walk back to the house to use the bathroom, or I could stand outside alongside the railing and urinate into the River Weser. Either option sounded very unappealing, and as I was mulling over which choice to make, I happen to glance over at our SOPEP stores, which included four sawed-off 55 gallon drums filled with absorbent Kitty litter.


Against my better judgement, and a possessed by a loathing to have to deal with the weather, I chose the easiest and tackiest option. I undid my fly and drained about a half-pint of processed coffee into one of the drums of Kitty litter. Then, just like it's intended recipient, I used my hand to sweep some dry Kitty litter over the Wet Spot, covering up my sin. I'm not proud of my actions, if there were any place I could find an understanding ear, I expect it would be in this subreddit.

1i1xtmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/energy_work/comments/1i1xtmc/friends_sister_and_i_had_the_same_type_of/,Friend's Sister and I had the same type of struggles and blocks. ,"I had a childhood friend, let's call her M. M is beautiful and brilliant but extremely competitive and envious. As a kid I was very oblivious to most things in life so I sorta just dealt with it. We became very attached, even though we had different friend circles. During middle school I noticed a sharp decline in my abilities and it started to reflect in my academics and health too. Idk what is it, it was like a veil that covers my eyes and i can't keep track of anything. Everything just seemed hard. I could still manage to not fail but barely. 

All this went on for years and I believe i am still affected. I managed to complete my bachelors degree but with poor grades and my path feels blocked. I cannot hold on to jobs and everytime I feel like I'm somewhat close to be stable, out of nowhere my teeth gets a hole that would need a root canal and all my progress is gone. All this while I was friends with her. 

In 2023, we met up for coffee and M was telling me about her elder sister, L. L graduated with a degree in medicine but failed to secure a living through it. L was struggling with her professonal life and couldn’t hold on to a job no matter what. M was also saying L had a supportive partner who's being by L's side all through this. That's when it clicked. I realized L and I have the same fate, same struggles and same issues. I also have a supportive partner who's being my rock. M has always been critical and envious about all my academic successes when we were younger and when we were older, she kept her views to herself. Chances are, she was envious of L too. Love life is the only thing M had no interest in, as she's asexual but for me, my love life was the only thing that had little to no struggles, ever. I married the only guy I ever dated and he's a gem.

Hearing that L was same as me, down to point of life partners, I started wondering if M was influencing both me and L in some way. I was not very familiar with the concept of energy and spirituality back then but it still clicked. Anyways, I cut off M last year after moving to a different country with my husband. I won't say everything magically got better but I feel lighter? It’s like something was standing behind my head and now it's not. I even got rid of the gifts I got from M. It’s been almost a year since I have no contact with her and I can feel myself getting better. It started with little thoughts of clarity. My teeth are still wrecked but I recently realized I grit my teeth in my sleep, which leads to chipping. In the last 10+ years and countless dentists and doctors, it never occurred to anyone, not even myself or my husband. Along with that, a lot of things are changing for the better that look like sheer coincidence. 

I was wondering if one single person can really affect my entire life this much, even when they probably do not know what they're doing. I just know if I tell M why I cut her off out of the blue, she'll look at me like I have an extra head. In fact, I can't expect anyone to believe my reasons.

1i1xs80,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixDocumentaries/comments/1i1xs80/did_christi_gibbons_kill_her_husband_my_theory/,Did Christi Gibbons Kill Her Husband? My Theory Based on Her Own Words- Ashley Madison ,"I can’t stop thinking about Christi Gibbons’ account in the Ashley Madison documentary. After hearing her version of events and analyzing her demeanor, I’m convinced there’s more to the story—and I think she might have killed her husband.

Here’s what she says happened:

1. She wakes up and finds her husband, John, in the kitchen. They chat over coffee, make plans for dinner, and then she heads to work.


2. That evening, she comes home and meets a friend in the driveway. They hear a noise coming from inside, which the friend mistakes for a phone ringing.


3. The friend leaves, and Christi goes inside. She notices John isn’t in the kitchen and begins looking for him throughout the house.


4. She goes upstairs to check their bedroom, doesn’t find him, and finally heads to the garage. That’s where she finds John’s body and realizes the sound they heard was a carbon monoxide alarm going off.



On the surface, it might seem tragic and straightforward, but her story just doesn’t hold up.

Here’s why I think Christi is lying:

Why Go Upstairs First? If a carbon monoxide alarm is blaring, it’s loud, urgent, and impossible to ignore. You wouldn’t waste time wandering upstairs to look for someone—you’d immediately check the source of the noise. Her actions suggest she already knew what she’d find in the garage and was stalling. Especially if her friend heard it from the front driveway. 

The Convenient Alibi: The friend in the driveway feels too perfect. Christi establishes that someone else was there to hear the sound and see her come home, reinforcing her timeline and making it seem like she had no idea what was going on. 

Her Demeanor: In the documentary, Christi’s body language is unsettling. She almost never blinks, except when she's finally done recounting find Johns body- then she starts blinking like crazy which is a common indicaton of deceit. she sways back and forth, looking in all directions as if trying to comfort herself  and the errie half-smiles she tries to cover up are absolutely terrifying. 

Her Statement About Cheaters: At one point, she says, “I don’t have the right to punish cheaters.” That line is so strange and defensive, almost like she’s trying to justify something to herself. Why even bring that up unless she feels guilty about taking matters into her own hands?

The Timing: John dies six days after the Ashley Madison leak exposes him as a cheating pastor. Sure, he might have felt shame, but it’s also the perfect storm for someone angry and humiliated—like Christi—to take revenge.

My theory: Christi came home earlier than she claims, confronted John about the leak, and things escalated. Maybe it was a spur-of-the-moment decision, or if she gave him sedatives but it all seems way too convenient and pristine, like the friend showing up? A well-timed way to create an alibi.

Her story feels rehearsed, and the cracks are impossible to ignore. Everything about this screams guilt. It's worth a rewatch if you've seen it already. Crazy to think about.

1i1xovp,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1i1xovp/i_have_developed_a_severe_halitophobia_and_cant/,I have developed a severe halitophobia and can’t seem to figure out if I actually have bad breath (M/26),"Since breaking up with my girlfriend, I’ve unfortunately developed several obsessive and recurring thoughts such as the perception of having bad breath. I suspect that it’s an unhealthy reaction of my psyche to legitimate a reason on why it’s my fault or that I’ve been the reason we broke up while it probably wasn’t. 

But the problem, which is also the reason I’m seeking advice in this subreddit, is that it isn’t even clear or evident if I have bad breath at all. 
A few thoughts or notes on this: 
I’ve actually never been notified that I have bad breath at all. And I’m pretty successful in my dating life, and no girl ever mentioned anything revolving around this topic, apart from me smelling like cigarettes which they usually dislike but doesn’t affect the “thing” going on between us. And it doesn’t have much to do with general hygiene. 
I can recall very few occasions years or a decade ago when somebody actually mentioned it (in the morning before brushing my teeth), but hasn’t happened ever since. I tend to have tonsil stones which I remove several times a week so they never really grow to a bigger size. I have a pretty good mouth hygiene. I brush my teeth with a Philips Sonicare electrical toothbrush twice a day, I precisely floss once or twice a day, I clean my tongue as good as possible, I gargle my mouth with black cumin oil to take care of my gums, and take a few mint drops a day. 

I, myself, don’t smell or taste anything bad at all. I neither ever have a unpleasant/sour taste in my mouth, or sense any unpleasant odor from my mouth neither when exhaling nor in general. When I do the palm licking test, it smells completely neutral with no ‘touch’ of anything bad. Same with breathing in my hands or in a paper bag.
However, sometimes I feel like I can perceive a faint kind of pylori related bad breath. But at the same time, it’s so subtle and just for a millisecond that it could entirely be a product of my imagination. I sometimes suffer from bloating after eating or drinking carbonated drinks. Which could just stem from the food itself, but maybe is a sign of a slight form of chronic reflux?
I‘m very rarely suffering from flu, or stuffy nose, coughing, stuffy sinuses, while my brother does way more often than me.

I rarely eat food with garlic.
But on the other hand, I don’t drink that much pure water, rather soft drinks, and I smoke around 7-8 cigarettes per day and drink 2 cups of coffee.

As I previously mentioned, nobody ever mentioned that I smell bad. I intentionally asked a few people many consecutive times and they said they don’t notice anything at all. When I breathed on my mum for example, she only said that she can smell that I smoked a cigarette, but really nothing else. 
However, my brother suffers heavily from a certain kind of bad breath, which seems to come either from a helicobacter pylori or a adenoids infection. I have to inform him about his bad breath when it’s noticeable, because he doesn’t notice it at all. This is probably of why I’m so unsure if I might suffer from it as well because it’s obviously not apparent for yourself when you have this kind of infection. Therefore I ordered two helicobacter pylori instant tests where you had to pour a blood sample into a container. Both of them were negative. But the problem was that I couldn’t get much blood out of my finger cause the accompanying needle wasn’t strong enough. 
And my father has pointed it out on my brother and my sister whenever it was apparent and perceptible, but never on me.

All indicators that maybe I’m the ‘lucky one’ who should stop worrying.
And from all what I’ve written down, you’d probably say that I don’t seem to have an apparent bad breath, but I’d like to hear your general estimation compared to your own experiences. 

Because sometimes when I’m talking to people, I kinda get the impression they’re subconsciously reacting to my possible bad breath. It might simply derive from a potentially strong smell of cigarette smoke, but a lot of people around me who smoke way more, have very bad teeth and don’t make the impression that they’re carefully treating their mouth hygiene, I can’t sense ANY form of unpleasant smell. 
And it maybe isn’t true at all and I’m oversensitive in my perception. 

But it’s a circumstance that heavily affects my social interactions as I’m too self-aware. I think I can rule out any mouth-related odors, but not any possible smells coming from my digestive system. 

What are your thoughts on this? Any tips to cure my obsessive thoughts? 

I do know that you can’t really get into detail just from what I’ve told you, and that my best advice would be to go to a doctor, but I can’t get an appointment at a gastroenterologist just for a routine checkup.

That the ai stealing artwork is like an artist looking for references. 

But no it's not, we are more complex than just seeing things and placing them in different contexts. We have abstract thinking, perception and bias. 
That's why everyone interprets different things from artworks, our experiences and biases makes us think different things. 

Or why we say that flowery scents are feminine and coal and coffee masculine even though it makes no logical sense. The patterns we make change with out values. 
That's why when we see a cloud one may think it looks like a dog. The ai just sees a cloud. 

When you see an art piece, a movie or listen to a song you focus on different things than others, you focus on some and miss some details. The Ai analizes everything equally. 
If you reference from memory, you also misremeber things. 

All of these are the basic processes of the brain, developed for a bunch of mammals that used to live in the wild.

1i1xnvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAI/comments/1i1xnvn/how_to_write_a_good_bot/,How to write a good bot,"I am so tired of scrolling through unengaging or uninteresting bots so here is how to make a good bot

*1. Scenario*
Think of something unique, if there's 700 other bots using the same scenario, don't copy them, be original. Use ideas from TV shows or real life, we don't want to have the same conversation over and over.

*2. Spelling, punctuation and grammar*
The amount of times I've been put off a bot because of bad grammar or no punctuation is insane. It's a basic concept you learn at school, use it. You're trying to engage users so they want to talk to your bot, if they're struggling to read your scenario, it's not working. Use the correct your/you're and there/their/they're.

If you're not confident with your spelling, punctuation and grammar, get someone to proof read your scenario. If you don't want another person reading it, then use chatGPT to proof read it, it's a simple solution.

*3. Motive*
The user needs a reason or motivation to respond. If you end your scenario with;

""he drinks his coffee quietly in the livingroom""

there's nothing to respond to. No one wants to start the conversation. If you end it with; 

""he puts a coffee in front of you and speaks softly 'good morning, darling, how did you sleep?'"" 

It gives the user a prompt to respond to, essentially starting the conversation for them. This also helps to keep them engaged.

*4. Vocabulary and detail*
Writing scenarios is a form of creative writing, you don't want it to be boring. Vocabulary isn't super important as long as you've gotten the other steps right, but it does help to create an engaging and entertaining bot. The AI will learn the tone from your scenario, so if you write something like;

""He sits in the livingroom sipping coffee quietly""

That's not fun, or engaging. It's boring. So, if you change it to something like;

""He takes a seat in his usual spot on the sofa in the warm livingroom. He has a hot cup of coffee warming his cold hands, he sips it, letting out a sigh of satisfaction""

That is far more entertaining, despite the fact that it's the same scenario. It adds detail and makes it easier for the user to immerse themself in your scenario.

*5. Structure*
Every good story has a structure, most are beginning, middle, end, but since your scenario will just be the beginning of the story, here's how you should structure it:

A- context
Who is the character in relation to the user? Why are they there? Where are they? Etc

B- scenario
What's going on? How is the user engaging with the character or vice versa? What is the narrative for your scenario?

C- prompt
How will you prompt the user to respond? Will you ask them something? Do something to them? Keep it open


And there you have it, everything you need to make a good and engaging bot. Write away, friends",5,1736948618.0,CharacterAI,0,1.0,False

We had a great date, talked for like 3 hours and then each went home. He gave me his real cell phone number at this point, as opposed to messaging on Hinge.

So we texted basically all day Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. On Friday morning I went and visited him at his job (Coffee shop) because he asked me to come!

Then no texts all day Saturday until midnight when he texted that he was drunk. Kind of icked me out. I responded Sunday AM, and then he never said anything in response until yesterday (Tuesday) lunchtime. He texted like “Hey how have you been?”

I’ve tried almost every hotel and restaurant in Kannur, Thalassery, Thaliparamba, etc., and I used to hype up Kannur’s food scene to my friends from other states and abroad. But now, I feel like the charm is fading.

Everywhere I go, the food tastes bland or generic, and even the tea spots don’t seem to hit the mark. Most places are either overhyped or just average, and I miss finding a proper “Naadan Hotel” that serves authentic snacks (*kadi*), good biriyani, quality meat dishes, and a satisfying cup of tea.

Here are my current go-to spots:

* **Onakkan Bharathi** \- for chops and puttu, though the tea and coffee quality has dropped lately.
* **Soft** \- biriyani is decent.
* **Bakerboys** \- puffs and tea.

I suspect that it’s an unhealthy reaction of my psyche to legitimate a reason on why it’s my fault or that I’ve been the reason we broke up while it probably wasn’t. 

But the problem, which is also the reason I’m seeking advice in this subreddit, is that it isn’t even clear or evident if I have bad breath at all. 
A few thoughts or notes on this: 
I’ve actually never been notified that I have bad breath at all. And I’m pretty successful in my dating life, and no girl ever mentioned anything revolving around this topic, apart from me smelling like cigarettes which they usually dislike but doesn’t affect the “thing” going on between us. And it doesn’t have much to do with general hygiene. 
I can recall very few occasions years or a decade ago when somebody actually mentioned it (in the morning before brushing my teeth), but hasn’t happened ever since. I tend to have tonsil stones which I remove several times a week so they never really grow to a bigger size. I have a pretty good mouth hygiene. I brush my teeth with a Philips Sonicare electrical toothbrush twice a day, I precisely floss once or twice a day, I clean my tongue as good as possible, I gargle my mouth with black cumin oil to take care of my gums, and take a few mint drops a day. 

I, myself, don’t smell or taste anything bad at all. I neither ever have a unpleasant/sour taste in my mouth, or sense any unpleasant odor from my mouth neither when exhaling nor in general. When I do the palm licking test, it smells completely neutral with no ‘touch’ of anything bad. Same with breathing in my hands or in a paper bag.
However, sometimes I feel like I can perceive a faint kind of pylori related bad breath. But at the same time, it’s so subtle and just for a millisecond that it could entirely be a product of my imagination. I sometimes suffer from bloating after eating or drinking carbonated drinks. Which could just stem from the food itself, but maybe is a sign of a slight form of chronic reflux?
I‘m very rarely suffering from flu, or stuffy nose, coughing, stuffy sinuses, while my brother does way more often than me.

I rarely eat food with garlic.
But on the other hand, I don’t drink that much pure water, rather soft drinks, and I smoke around 7-8 cigarettes per day and drink 2 cups of coffee.

As I previously mentioned, nobody ever mentioned that I smell bad. I intentionally asked a few people many consecutive times and they said they don’t notice anything at all. When I breathed on my mum for example, she only said that she can smell that I smoked a cigarette, but really nothing else. 
However, my brother suffers heavily from a certain kind of bad breath, which seems to come either from a helicobacter pylori or a adenoids infection. I have to inform him about his bad breath when it’s noticeable, because he doesn’t notice it at all. This is probably of why I’m so unsure if I might suffer from it as well because it’s obviously not apparent for yourself when you have this kind of infection. Therefore I ordered two helicobacter pylori instant tests where you had to pour a blood sample into a container. Both of them were negative. But the problem was that I couldn’t get much blood out of my finger cause the accompanying needle wasn’t strong enough. 
And my father has pointed it out on my brother and my sister whenever it was apparent and perceptible, but never on me.

All indicators that maybe I’m the ‘lucky one’ who should stop worrying.
And from all what I’ve written down, you’d probably say that I don’t seem to have an apparent bad breath, but I’d like to hear your general estimation compared to your own experiences. 

Because sometimes when I’m talking to people, I kinda get the impression they’re subconsciously reacting to my possible bad breath. It might simply derive from a potentially strong smell of cigarette smoke, but a lot of people around me who smoke way more, have very bad teeth and don’t make the impression that they’re carefully treating their mouth hygiene, I can’t sense ANY form of unpleasant smell. 
And it maybe isn’t true at all and I’m oversensitive in my perception. 

But it’s a circumstance that heavily affects my social interactions as I’m too self-aware. I think I can rule out any mouth-related odors, but not any possible smells coming from my digestive system. 

What are your thoughts on this? Any tips to cure my obsessive thoughts? 

I do know that you can’t really get into detail just from what I’ve told you, and that my best advice would be to go to a doctor, but I can’t get an appointment at a gastroenterologist just for a routine checkup.

I’ve struggled with this phobia for decades. At its worst, it is a truly miserable, life-destroying, 1000lb lead backpack that you cannot take off. But it’s not always at its worst, and I’ve had many, many long periods of relatively unanxious normalcy in my life. Unfortunately, that’s not where I have been recently. But I’m working on it with help from Ken Goodman’s book.

I have diagnosed MDD, GAD, OCD, and TLA. I’ve been obsessing over the recent norovirus outbreaks, and spent a lot of this morning reading and reading myself into an anxious tizzy. I have to ride a crowded subway train into work and spend time around others. It’s really making me uncomfortable.

But I am more than my anxiety. This bleeping bleep known as “anxiety” on the back of my metaphorical anxiety bus journey to healing (per Goodman’s book) can shout his head off. But you know what? Today I’m going to score points against him. Today, I’m going to get on the subway and go into work. I may mask up, but if that’s what I need to get through then so be it. That’s still a success, not a failure.

Today I’m going to do my job. I may even get a cup of coffee or my favorite sandwich (Potbelly’s tuna sub with tomato and pickles - don’t judge 🤪) and eat food prepared by someone else. I am more than my anxiety. I am more than the panic attacks I sometimes have.

Anxiety wins when it stops me from going out and living my life. Not today, bleeping gremlin. That said, it’s not going to be easy for me. So I’d love it if you can send me a little love or support in the comments. Don’t wish me luck though—wish me perseverance. ♥️",2,1736948493.0,emetophobia,1,1.0,False

1i1xk9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1i1xk9j/tourists_in_italy_what_you_thought_you_knew_about/,"Tourists in Italy: what you thought you knew about Italian coffee is wrong. Little choice, oily dark bitter roasts, poor quality beans.","Tourists visiting Italy are often sold a romanticised notion of Italy having some of the ""best"" coffee and ""strongest"" espressos, not for the faint of hearth.

  
I want to debunk some of the most common myths, so that  tourists (and Italians!) can have a more informed coffee experience.

  
**Italian coffee tends to be dark, bitter roasts, There is almost no choice.**

In fact, there are various ways to roast coffee. Simplifying, lighter roasts (light brown beans) tend to be more acidic and less bitter, while darker roasts are the opposite. In Italy it is very, very hard to find roasts which aren't very dark, almost black, and bitter. Most Italian will be completely unfamiliar with other types of coffee.

  
**So Italians like bitter coffee - what's the big deal?**

They don't like bitter coffee - if they did, why does almost every Italian add sugar to their espressos?

Most coffees are dark, bitter, often burnt roasts because they're cheaper. Over-roasting beans to the point they become almost black is a way to mix coffee of various origins and make it all taste the same. The original flavours are lost, and it all tastes burnt.

Coffee in Italy is a social rite, often to be had multiple times a day; for most Italians it would be incompatible with the higher prices of better quality coffee.

  
**It is common to find oily beans, which make the coffee rancid.**

Many *bars* (i.e. coffee shops) use oily beans. Beans should not become oily; when they do, it's sign of a poor roasting process. The oil makes the machines dirty, and results in a rancid taste. The Italian TV show Report made a video about it (only in Italian): [https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1652903235321596](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1652903235321596) 

  
**Many coffee shops do not clean their machines.**

Coffee is mostly water. If the barista doesn't clean the coffee machine between an espresso and the next, the next espresso will be made with dirty water from the residues of the previous coffee. The same TV show asked many baristas across the country, and almost no one cleans their machines. They also show a very simple test: they run the machine without the coffee holder thingy, and show how dirty the water that comes out is, if the barista hasn't cleaned the machine. [https://www.facebook.com/watch/?ref=search&v=1141660060900284&external\_log\_id=bd1e0a57-c19f-4681-ad66-0812316b8b09&q=report%20caff%C3%A8%20pulire](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?ref=search&v=1141660060900284&external_log_id=bd1e0a57-c19f-4681-ad66-0812316b8b09&q=report%20caff%C3%A8%20pulire) 

  
**Does it even matter?**

Taste is subjective - only you can be the judge of that. In coffee drinks with large quantities of milk, the taste of coffee is watered down, for better and for worse. In a small espresso, the taste of the coffee is more pure and unaffected by milk or anything else.  


**So you are being fussy and don't like the coffee they like - what's the big deal?**

Taste is subjective, we may all like a different type of coffee.

What is not subjective is that:

* there is little to no choice in Italy. Finding a place which serves a non-dark roast, or lets you choose between multiple types of coffee, is hard. Sure, there are specialty coffee places, but they are very few
* It's not that Italians like this bitter coffee (if they did, they wouldn't add sugar to it) - it's that they ended up settling for the cheapest type of coffee. Nothing wrong with that per se, just don't pretend it's the best coffee on the planet!
* The quest for cheap coffee often results in poor quality products and processes. Whether you prefer sweeter or more bitter coffee is subjective, but that oily beans result in a rancid taste, or that not cleaning the machines results in using dirty water, is not.

  
**Will things change?**

No, because Italians want coffee to be cheap. Plus they don't like to be told they don't, in fact, excel at what they thought they did. It's like taking about the merits of a Republic to a Brit, or of gun control to a Texan :) On a more serious note, coffee companies often make deals with coffee shops whereby they give all the machinery for free but then the shop must buy only their coffee. The market is set up in such a way to limit choice and competition.

  
**Where can I learn more?**

There are various subs dedicated to coffee. [James Hoffman](https://www.jameshoffmann.co.uk/) has a nice website and channel, and a book, translated also in Italian. (World Atlas of coffee / il mondo del caffè). If you want to learn more, start looking into how the various types of coffee (arabica vs robusta, African vs American, etc), the type of roast (lighter vs darker) and the extract method (moka is more bitter than espresso, which is more bitter than filtered) affect the taste of coffee. The Italian newspaper Repubblica published [this ](https://www.repubblica.it/il-gusto/2021/07/26/news/caffe_il_piu_clamoroso_equivoco_gastronomico_d_italia-311835974/)a while ago.

New to home roasting. I've been seeing some positive reviews about Airscape containers from Planetary Design. Just wondering whether anyone has any feedback about offgassing in the regular Airscape containers. Seems like they don't have one way valves that release CO2. So I guess my related questions are:
Do you just offgas before you put beans into Airscape?
With air exposure being bad for coffee, how do you balance leaving a loose lid for offgassing vs allowing air exposure? 
Or do you place freshly roasted beans in and just release it periodically? 
There's another inner lid called FreshPort that burps CO2, any experience with it? ",2,1736948282.0,CoffeeRoasting,1,1.0,False

We matched before I deleted the app previously, and he works at a local store. I have interacted with this guy IRL several times. He is cute, artsy, engaging.. point is, I'm starting to want to like him.

But this holds me back - I want monogamy and on his profile he has ""figuring out my relationship type."" I was going to ask, in time.. but it came up last night. 

He sent me a hilarious selfie of him posing like a superhero and I noticed a ring on his ring finger. 

I asked him if he's wearing a wedding ring. 

He said: Nope! I didnt switch the whathaveyous around. That's a Claddagh ring on my right finger. (Heart facing out)
[He means he didn't unmirror his selfies, which I had just teased him about.]

I said, thanks for explaining. I was like ohhh maybe that's why your profile says figuring out my relationship type haha.

He said: Well, some people are frightened by the concept of monagamy, it seems these days. Or at least turned off by it.
And then: I dig the ethical non monogamy thing, and respect it. **But it's not entirely what I'm looking for either.**

I said: Well I am rigidly monogamous to be candid.

He said: Both of those things I would prefer. 

I said: Both of what things? 

He said: Dinner and rigidly monogamous. 

Then we said good night. 


I am very intrigued by this creature. However, I am feeling uncertain if he really wants monogamy. It almost feels like he's backtracking to meet what I want. That makes me uncomfortable because if he wants ENM - and it sounds like it may be an itch for him - then he wouldn't be happy with me, nor I with him. 

He asked me out to dinner during our discussion about the ring. I haven't answered him about that because dinner is romantic, and I have doubts that he is someone whom I can consider romantically. For now, anyway. 

Are there questions I can ask him to get a better feel for what he **really** wants? Should I suggest coffee for a meetup so we can chat about it in person? 

Or is his waffling a legitimate red flag?

As for date ideas? We just walk around and people watch Sometimes. Or go to the next door park. I miss summer time now.....watching birds, hiking, swimming, drawing outside......
Winter time is hard when it's 15 degrees out. Not much to do. So we have to get creative.
Can't tell you how much I've decorated the apartment for Jack's sake lol. Made ornaments, shadow boxes, collages.....heck we even play yatzee (borderlands edition of course) together! Because all you do is throw the dice. 
So I hope there's some ideas there for you to help you get out of a slump.

1i1xd03,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1i1xd03/trip_report_for_my_2nd_visit_to_japan_10_days_in/,"Trip report for my 2nd visit to Japan - 10 days in Tokyo including day trips, also some restaurant recommendations","I recently came back from my 2nd trip to Japan (in November 2024 to be exact), and wanted to provide a little trip report for anyone interested. My first time to the country around was back in 2023, and like most first-time visits to the country, it was super-packed and hectic as we ran around trying to see everything possible. I did the usual Tokyo-Kyoto-Osaka circuit, but also spent some time in Toyama. 

This time around, I promised myself to take things at a more leisurely pace. As I had already hit all the major tourist attractions/areas last time, the focus this time would be on neighbourhoods that don't get as many tourists as somewhere like Shinjuku/Shibuya/Asakusa etc., and really get the vibe of each area by just wandering around without a concrete itinerary. I also hadn't done any day trips from Tokyo last time, so those were on the menu as well.

I stayed for the entire duration of my trip at the Prince Gallery Tokyo Kiocho hotel (with the exception of an overnighter for one of the day trips), near Akasaka-mitsuke station. I wanted to be somewhere convenient and lively, but not as crazy as Shinjuku/Shibuya (I stayed right by Shinjuku station during my last trip and it was fun - but also a little overwhelming). It's a great hotel and I recommend it if you're planning on staying in this area. Great location, excellent customer service and the rooms are quite spacious by Tokyo standards. Only downside is that it is a bit of a walk (\~10 minutes) from the station. In terms of party size, this was a couples trip with my wife, whereas the first time was the 2 of us + 3 friends. 

Here's a day-by-day breakdown of how I spent each day, as well as my favourite restaurants from each area/neighbourhood:

Day 1: 

* Area explored: **Akasaka**
* Landed at Haneda at around 4:30pm after a brutal 15-hour flight. By the time we got to the hotel, it was 6:45pm and I was absolutely wrecked. Did some brief unpacking, settled in, took a shower and lay down for a bit to recoup some energy. Later in the evening, went out to explore the Akasaka area as it was my first time there. Checked out **Hie-jinja** **temple**, had a quick dinner at **Tonkatsu Masamune (highly recommend)**, and headed back to the hotel after doing the obligatory konbini run. Nothing else done on this day as my energy levels were just beyond zero. 

Day 2:

* Area explored: **Ueno**
* Overview: Really liked this area - it felt like a nice mix of ""tourist"" and ""local"" Tokyo. There were some tourists but not overwhelming by any means. **Ueno Park** was as a nice stroll, and I enjoyed the brief time we spent checking out **Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum**. I'm no art connoisseur by any means, though I did like most of what I saw. Also loved **Ameyoko Shopping Street** \- vibrant and a little raw and unpolished. Walked over to Nezu shrine and really liked it. Not as grand as Senso-ji but wayyyy less crowded. Ended the day with a quick stroll through **Yanaka Ginza**
* Restaurant recommendation: **Kamo to Negi**, a ramen with duck meat which was a first for me.

Day 3: 

* Area explored: **Ginza/Azabudai**
* Overview: Started the day off with teamLabs Borderless. I did Planets last time, and it was nice - honestly though, Borderless is way better. The displays are just more dynamic and creative. Otherwise, the Azabudai area doesn't have much going on. It seems posh and upscale but that's about it. The nearby **Zojo-ji** temple was really nice though. My wife wanted to do some clothes and stationery shopping in Ginza so that's why we ended up there. Ginza is cool, I guess? I was there briefly last time and my impression of it hasn't really changed. It's very upscale and aesthetic but it doesn't feel very ""Tokyo"", just seems like any other upscale high-fashion district in a big city. I did enjoy walking through **Hamarikyu Park**
* Restaurant recommendation: **Sumiyaki Unafuji,** an amazing unagi restaurant

Day 4:

* Area explored: **Kichijoji and Koenji**
* Overview: Started the day off with Kichijoji, which has a really laid-back, zen vibe. Had a leisurely walk through **Inokashira Park,** which was lovely even without the cherry blossoms. We also by some miracle had managed to snag **Ghibli Museum** tickets so that was the main attraction of the day. If you're a Ghibli fan, this is a must (the ticket-acquisition process is outright shit though). Afterwards, we walked around exploring the cozy backstreets and checking out **Harmonica Yokocho.** Went back down the Chuo line in the evening to Koenji - did some vintage shopping there and then spent some time at **SUBstore** listening to some sick live DJ music. Walked around the neighbourhood afterwards - loved the authentic, somewhat grungy vibes of Koenji. This was one of my favourite days on the trip
* Restaurant recommendations: **Hikiniku to Come** in Kichijoji for Hamburg steak and **Blue Plate** in Koenji for Japanese curry

Day 5: 

* Area explored: **Day Trip to Kawaguchiko**
* Overview: Took the train early in the morning to explore Kawagcuhiko as I heard that you have a better chance of seeing Fuji in the colder months due to drier, clearer skies. And as luck would have it, we were able to see it and it was spectacular. We went up to **Chureito Pagoda**, walked around **Oishi Park**, and just enjoyed the spectacular presence of Fuji in the distance. I'd heard that the town can get really crowded but given that it was late November and colder, it wasn't bad at all. Got back to our hotel in the evening and called it a day after dinner - 4 hours of transit and 20k+ steps meant that we were pretty damn exhausted. 
* Restaurant recommendations: **Takekawa Udon** for udon in Kawaguchiko, **Kisurin** in Akasaka for dandan-style noodle soup

Day 6:

* Area explored: **Nakameguro and Sangenjaya**
* Overview: Found Nakameguro to be a really nice little spot. The area along the river was great, and it had some of my favourite little networks of alleys and side-streets. Sat at a tiny coffee shop called Little Cloud for a brew after lunch. Very cozy and charming. Headed over to Sangenjaya afterwards - this place was on my list because Persona 5 is one of my favourite games and I had hear that this was the area Yongenjaya in the game was based off of. I really liked it, felt a little rougher around the edges and reminded me of my time in Taipei and parts of Seoul. Found a cool cafe called Rain on the Roof and popped into a music venue called Heaven's Door. Awesome vibes all around and it really felt like an area completely untouched by tourists
* Restaurant recommendations: **Udatsu Sushi** in Nakameguro for an omakase experience and a place in Sangenjaya that had these really awesome curry breads...idk what the English name is but on Google it says **小麦と酵母 濱田家**. Highly recommend it

Day 7: 

* Area explored: **Jimbocho and Sumida**
* Overview: This was a very lazy and aimless day. I was tired and just wanted to do some very low-effort exploration. My wife had plans on spending the day doing some shopping and meeting a friend who was also visiting Tokyo at the same time as us so I decided to fly solo. Went to Jimbocho Book Town and checked out the bookstores there, and then crossed over to Sumida to do the **Tokyo Skytree** observation deck. This was way better than I expected, and I ended up liking it quite a bit more than Shibuya Sky. Made a quick stop at **Kiyosumi Gardens** before headed back to the hotel
* Restaurant recommendations: I cannot recommend **Biryani Osawa** near Ogawamachi Station enough. I'm South Asian so my standards for biryani are very high but believe me when I tell ya'll that this is one of *the* best biryanis I've tried in my life. I brought some back for my wife (also South Asian) and she couldn't believe it either. I never imagined a Japanese man to make ""our"" food so damn well lol. Would also recommend **Takesue Tokyo Premium**, an awesome ramen place, near Skytree

Day 8 and 9

* Area explored: **Kamakura and Enoshima**
* Overview: Decided to spend the next couple of days away from Tokyo at one of the most popular day trip destinations. Is it heresy to say that I kinda enjoyed Kamakura/Enoshima a bit more than Kyoto? Kyoto was stunning, don't get me wrong, but the sheer volume of tourists (of which I am one obviously) kinda took away from the experience. Kamakura had some groups of tourists as well but similar to Kawaguchiko, because it's closer to whatever passes for off-season in Japan these days, it wasn't super packed. I honestly don't think I've been anywhere with the sheer amount of tourist crowds as Kiyomizu-dera. But I'm digressing - I'm a huge fan of the ocean and seaside towns so this was right up my alley. Over the 2 days that we were there, I enjoyed just slowly taking in the relaxed, laid-back vibe - which was easy to find away from the centre of town - walking by the sea, exploring Hasedera temple, and doing some hikes here and there - I really liked the Ginoyama trail in particular. On day 9, we headed back to Tokyo and had a quiet evening in the hotel.
* Restaurant recommendations: **Oriyori Tomiyama (donburi), OXYMORON komachi (beef/rice bowl) and Maison Cacao (dessert),** all in the Kamakura area

Day 10

* Area explored: **Kanamachi**
* Overview: Last day in Tokyo before we leave. I'll be honest - I had no idea what this neighbourhood even was. Never heard of it before but I was on the Tokyo subreddit looking for hidden gems in the city and a lot of people recommended **Mizumoto Park.** So I decided to make the trek all the way out there. Kind of an impulse thing really, just wanted to pick a direction and go somewhere a bit obscure. I'm glad I decided to get out there though because it was awesome - and absolutely massive. Rented a bike from Hello Cycle and rode around the park, taking in the sights and the slow, lazy early winter atmosphere. The **Metasequoia Forest** was super cool, as were the bird observation stations. I liked the Kanamachi area as well. Kind of sleepy and slow but a very enjoyably relaxed vibe. Definitely got a few stares but I think residents are maybe not used to seeing a lot of brown tourists coming up this way lol
* Restaurant recommendations: **Kosen (yakiniku) and Miura (ramen)**

Day 11

* A sad day indeed as we are forced to fly home :(

Hope this was helpful and/or enjoyable for anyone considering Tokyo! Happy to answer any questions.

Guess what ?

Today has been a good day. The best one yet. I will post up some pics and maybe videos of what's happened since my battery bank got here and I setup solar. 

Things are very different now. I'm able to have a nice cold yogurt and oats in the morning. Cold drinks. Smoked salmon and creame cheese on rye bread, iced coffee, juice.

Even a big ass Sapporo to celebrate !

I've just configured the ecoflow app and can watch a live feed of solar topping up my battery at 170 watts during the day from anywhere. 

Everything has changed. Such a massive morale booster to have these small things in a small thing. Learning to just slow down and watch life.

Listen to people's conversations as I'm parked and they have not a single clue there's someone living a life next to them.

The isolation of it all and the disconnect from general society was rough to start with. Now things have gone in a different direction. It's liberating. It's interesting. It's exciting. It's all the good things that were hidden under a vail. The vail of change. 

I've found some amazing spots and tonight's has been the highlight. I will sleep well tonight and I hope all of you amazing people do the same. Sending all a wish for peace and to continue to peserve.

We live in my house, and because she’s saving for her residency, I never ask her to contribute to rent, utilities, or groceries. I want her to feel comfortable and focus on her work. I also take care of most household chores since I know how demanding her job is. I cook for her, make her bed, and never ask for anything in return—not even financial support.

Recently, I found out that she treats her coworkers to meals or coffee almost every day. She admits she’s a people-pleaser, so I didn’t mind at first. But it made me wonder—if she can be so generous to others, why does she seem so conditional with me? She keeps track of everything she gives me and makes me feel like there’s always an expectation attached.

For example, I once asked her to turn off the lights because our electric bill was nearing $90. She got upset but eventually handed me $20 for the bill—her only contribution to utilities ever, even though I spend $720–$900 on bills every month. Another time, she complained about the cost of Grab rides to work from my house, even though it’s cheaper than renting her own place.

The real breaking point was when I asked her to wash the dishes one day. It was her day off, she had slept well, and she wasn’t busy, but she got angry. We had a huge fight, and she even dragged her mom into it—something I’ve repeatedly told her not to do. It wasn’t the first time she involved her family in our arguments, and I felt disrespected.

Today, we argued again after she told me about treating her coworkers. I told her I feel unappreciated, like she’s willing to go the extra mile for others but not for me. Out of frustration, I said she might as well move out if this is how things will always be. I regret saying it because I know it was harsh, but I was hurt. I want her to see and value the effort I put into our relationship.

AITAH for feeling this way? Am I overreacting or being too sensitive? I know I shouldn’t have told her to leave, but it feels like she doesn’t treat me as her partner the way she does others. Did finding out about her generosity to others just push me over the edge? Or am I just failing to understand the stress and exhaustion of her job as a doctor?

  
P.S-We're not from the US, I just converted the amounts into dollar. (In case you're wondering why those digits are kinda low compare to the average amounts in US)",20,1736947334.0,AITAH,33,1.0,False

Hi everyone,

I hope this post doesn’t come across as desperate or rude; that’s definitely not my intention.

I’m a single mom of two young kids, and lately, I’ve been struggling financially. I work part-time, but with mortgage payments, car bills, and daily expenses, I’m finding it really hard to make ends meet. Unfortunately, I’m not eligible for government assistance, and it feels like I’m constantly just getting by.

I’ve recently done some research into the financial domination (findom) space, and while I know it’s far from the glamorous Facebook reels that show women making thousands weekly, I can’t help but feel intrigued. I’d love to explore this as a way to gain some financial relief, while also embracing an interest I’ve always had: being a domme. I’ve never felt comfortable exploring this side of me in past relationships, and now I’m in a position where I feel like it’s something I’d like to explore with someone who understands the dynamic.

I’m not looking for huge financial gains – honestly, I’d just love any small help that could make my situation a little easier. A subscription payment, a weekly coffee, or even just a bit of support would go a long way. I’m looking for someone I can connect with, someone I can talk to daily, alongside exploring the domme/sub relationship. I want to have control and feel empowered while also offering something meaningful to someone else.

I know this is probably a bit cringey for some of the more experienced dommes here, and I totally get that. But if you’ve made it this far, I really appreciate you taking the time to read and understand my situation.

Thanks again for listening, and I’d love to chat more if anyone is interested.

Burano. The very name conjures up images of vibrant colors, bobbing fishing boats, and a timeless charm that feels a world away from the bustling crowds of Venice.  And you're right, it is!  Just a short hop from the main Venetian islands, Burano is a hidden gem waiting to be discovered.  Forget the usual tourist traps; this is where you'll find authentic Italian life painted in a rainbow of hues.

**A Burst of Color:**

The first thing that strikes you about Burano is the sheer explosion of color.  Houses are painted in a dazzling array of vibrant shades – fiery reds, sunny yellows, deep blues, and everything in between. This isn't random; tradition dictates that fishermen painted their houses in bright colors to help them navigate back home through the dense fog of the Venetian lagoon.  Today, it's a delightful spectacle, a photographer's dream, and a constant source of joy for residents and visitors alike.

**More Than Just Pretty Pictures:**

While the colorful houses are undeniably captivating, Burano offers so much more than just pretty pictures.

* **Lace Making:** Burano has a long and rich history of lace making, a tradition that continues to this day.  You can find exquisite handmade lace in the local shops, a truly unique souvenir to take home.  Consider visiting a lace-making workshop to witness the artistry firsthand – it's mesmerizing!

* **Delicious Seafood:**  Being a fishing island, Burano boasts some of the freshest seafood in the region.  Enjoy a delicious meal at one of the many trattorias lining the canals, savoring the local specialties while soaking in the picturesque atmosphere.  Don't forget to try the *bigoli in salsa*, a regional pasta dish.

* **Peaceful Canals & Bridges:**  Get lost in the maze of narrow streets and charming bridges that connect the island.  Take a leisurely stroll along the canals, admiring the colorful houses from a different perspective.  It's the perfect way to unwind and escape the crowds.

* **Trattorias and Cafes:**  Burano offers a delightful selection of trattorias and cafes, perfect for enjoying a relaxing coffee, a delicious lunch, or a romantic dinner.  Many have outdoor seating, allowing you to soak in the charming ambiance while enjoying your meal.

**Getting There:**

Reaching Burano is easy.  You can take a *vaporetto* (water bus) from Venice, a journey that takes about 40 minutes and offers breathtaking views of the Venetian lagoon.  The frequent service makes it a convenient and enjoyable trip.

**Planning Your Visit:**

* **Time of Year:** Burano is beautiful year-round, but spring and autumn offer pleasant weather and fewer crowds.  Summer can be busy, so be prepared for larger crowds.

* **Time to Spend:**  Allow at least half a day to explore Burano properly.  You could easily spend a full day if you want to enjoy a leisurely pace and delve deeper into the island's culture and history.

* **What to Pack:** Comfortable shoes are essential, as you'll be doing a fair bit of walking.  A camera is a must to capture the colorful beauty of the island!

Burano is more than just a pretty face; it's an experience that will stay with you long after you've left.  So, ditch the usual tourist itinerary and discover the magic of this charming island – you won't regret it!

I wish I could undo what I did. My wife didn’t deserve that.

Maybe it was the alcohol. Maybe it was the thrill of the moment. But it was a major lapse in my conscious judgment for sure. There can be no justification for what I did. That one night with a colleague from Italy, someone I met for the first time, changed everything. I’ve made sure to avoid any kind of informal relationship with her after that.

When I returned home three months ago, I continued my routine of being a caring and supportive husband to my loving wife. But my health started deteriorating. I couldn’t sleep at all. Or rather, I would say I didn’t sleep by choice. It is humanly impossible to keep yourself sleep-deprived for so long, but I did it anyway. I would drink endless cups of coffee, listen to loud music, and watch something for hours—anything to keep myself awake. I started losing weight. Sometimes I’d pass out from exhaustion. I couldn’t focus on work. My energy was consumed entirely by my efforts to stay awake.

I was suffering from depression and anxiety. My wife grew concerned about my health, but she had no idea that I hadn’t been sleeping at all and the reason behind it. I kept making excuses, but I knew I had to stay awake, no matter what.

Why? Because I couldn’t keep cheating on my wife every single day. The moment I slept, I would have dreams—dreams of me with someone unknown in my bed.

I had always been a loyal and loving husband. I already felt immense guilt for my one mistake. But now, in my dreams, I was making that mistake again and again. I couldn’t stop myself. I was helpless. I had no control over it.

I had to live through the entire experience in my dreams every time I slept. I was somehow forced to watch it all until it was over. Only then could I wake up.

The worst part was that I unknowingly enjoyed myself in those dreams, and that realization crushed me every time I woke up. The guilt of enjoying cheating on my wife in my dreams became unbearable. I would cry my heart out the moment I woke up. It left me anxious and depressed.

After each dream, I woke up completely drained, both physically and emotionally. I didn’t even feel like being intimate with my wife. My body was so exhausted that I would crash onto the bed the following night, starting the cycle all over again.

It felt as if I was cursed for my mistake. That’s why I stopped sleeping entirely, even though my health was suffering.

Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore. To at least rid myself of the guilt, I confessed to her. I told her how I had cheated on her during my business trip. I also promised her that it would never happen again. I cried the whole night, begging for her forgiveness.

She was angry. She was hurt. She didn’t say much at first, but after a couple of days, she forgave me.

Miraculously, from the next day onward, everything became fine for me. No more nightmares. I could sleep properly. We even started having a good time with each other again after so long. The guilt and anxiety were gone.

But now, two months later, I’ve started noticing that she’s acting a bit odd. She seems to avoid any romantic gestures from me. She just goes to sleep every night and doesn’t want to be intimate. This has been going on for almost a month. She is always excited to sleep which seemed odd.

And since I’m always the one who wakes her up in the morning, I can’t help but notice how happy and at peace she seems when she wakes up.

At this point, I have no idea what I should be more worried about.",5,1736946758.0,shortscarystories,3,1.0,False

I got an amazing offer to upgrade my current 2022 Bellezza Bellona (with which I am already very much satisfied) with a 2021 Lelit Bianca.

There is no discussion about how much higher level the Lelit would be, but I am afraid it could not be the machine for me.

We are 2 in the household, and we mostly drink a cappuccino in the morning and 1/2 shots during the day. I am concerned about the E61 heat-up timing (with the Bellezza integrated head, in 5 minutes I have my morning coffee ready)

Scripture: Col. 4:3; Matt. 9: 37 - 38 & Eph. 3: 20 -21

Message:

 Step 2 – PRAY FOR OPEN DOORS

Something to know about God: He loves opening doors.

When we began praying for God to give us opportunities to talk to people about Jesus, we found more ways we could connect. 

When we start praying for opportunities to show God’s love, God will answer that prayer. Our hearts will also be tender towards those opportunities. We will start to naturally look for them. When we seek them, we will find them.

What are ways you and I can connect with those in our lives, find commonality with them, and begin and continue authentic relationships?

Perhaps it’s an activity we can share in. Perhaps it’s a common interest we can discuss. Perhaps it’s going to their soccer game, their band’s show, or asking them out for coffee.

We can pray for God to show us the ways to connect with those in our lives. He will show us.

It is God’s Will that every person should know Him. We are not alone in wanting our loved ones to know God. God loves them even more than we do, and He wants to partner with us in revealing who He is. Jesus said in Matthew 9:37-38, “The harvest is great, but the workers are few. So pray to the Lord who is in charge of the harvest; ask him to send more workers into his fields.” You and I are commissioned to pray for more people to share the Gospel, and for more opportunities for us to do so as well.

PRAY FOR OPEN DOORS

Pray to God for opportunities to reveal His love and share His story with those we know, and those we might come across this week. God loves opening doors. Pray for them. Look for them. Expect them. And pray for the courage to walk through those doors when they open.

PRAYER

God, today we pray that You would open doors for us to reveal Your love to those around us. Give us the boldness and courage to share Your story through our lives. Help us not to miss the open doors that You put right in front of us. In our families, at work, at school - wherever we go, please give us more opportunities to share You with others. And help us see the opportunities we already have. Amen.

I've been posting my inpaint workflows as a response to some people with doubts or needs, and kept saying I would update them ""soon"" to a new version.

Well, it finally took more than a month to do the damn update, but at last it's here.

I will try to find the posts in which I linked my workflows to inform of the update, but just in case here's a separate post for everyone to know.

For the ones who didn't know, I've been uploading my workflows to a ko-fi page, free of login and of charge. Why not civitai? I don't like it, I don't like it's content, I don't like the monetization model, the buzz, and many more... I like things simple, free, easy, and if you feel like it just treat me to a beer/coffee. That's what I like to receive and what I like to offer.

As for this workflows, I'll copy their descriptions here for your convenience:

SD1.5/SDXL

>This is a unified workflow with the best inpainting methods for sd1.5 and sdxl models. It incorporates: Brushnet, PowerPaint, Fooocus Patch and Controlnet Union Promax. It also crops and resizes the masked area for the best results. Furthermore, it has rgtree's control custom nodes for easy usage. Aside from that, I've tried to use the minimum number of custom nodes.   
Version 2 is improved in working with more resolutions and masks shapes, and batch functionality is fixed.

Flux

>A Flux Inpaint workflow for ComfyUI using controlnet and turbo lora. It also crops the masked area, resizes to optimal size and pastes it back into the original image. Optimized for 8gb vram, but easily configurable. I've tried to keep custom nodes to a minimum.   
Version 2 with improvements in the calculation of the cropped region and added the option to use Flux Fill.

1i1wsj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1i1wsj4/can_you_really_whiten_your_teeth_at_home/,Can You Really Whiten Your Teeth at Home?,"Teeth whitening is something a lot of people want but aren’t sure how to approach. I’ve always been tempted by those bright before-and-after photos you see online, but I’ve also been hesitant after hearing mixed reviews about at-home products. Do they actually work? Or are they just another expensive disappointment? Since I didn’t want to spend $500+ on professional whitening, I gave **Laughland teeth whitening** a try. Here’s a breakdown of my experience—both the good and the not-so-good.

# Why At-Home Whitening Made Sense for Me

Getting my teeth professionally whitened seemed excessive, both in cost and effort. Whitening strips gave me uneven results and painful sensitivity, while whitening toothpaste felt too weak to make a difference. Laughland caught my attention because it uses a **dentist-formulated whitening gel** combined with an LED mouthpiece, which seemed more advanced than other at-home kits. Plus, it promised results in six days—without the pain I’d had from other products.

# What’s Included in the Laughland Kit?

The kit came with everything I needed to start whitening immediately:

1. **Whitening Gel Pens**: These pens let you easily apply the gel to your teeth.
2. **LED Mouthpiece**: This activates the gel and helps it whiten more evenly.
3. **Simple Instructions**: The guide broke everything down step-by-step, making it super easy to follow.

The packaging felt high-quality, and the applicator pens made it easy to target specific areas without a mess.

# How to Use Laughland Teeth Whitening

The whitening process is pretty straightforward:

1. **Brush Your Teeth**: Make sure your teeth are clean and dry before applying the gel.
2. **Apply the Gel**: Use the applicator pen to coat your teeth evenly.
3. **Insert the LED Mouthpiece**: Turn it on, pop it in, and wait for 10 minutes while it works.
4. **Rinse and Clean**: After the session, rinse your mouth and clean the device for your next use.

Each session took about 10 minutes—short enough to fit into my daily routine while catching up on emails or watching TV.

# My Day-by-Day Progress

* **Day 1**: No visible changes yet, but my teeth felt squeaky clean after the first session. The gel didn’t have a harsh taste, and the LED mouthpiece was comfortable to use.
* **Day 3**: By the third session, I noticed some lightening, especially on the surface stains from coffee and tea.
* **Day 6**: By the end of the cycle, my teeth were 6–7 shades whiter. The results were even, and I didn’t experience any patchiness or overly white spots.

The best part? **No sensitivity.** I’ve had bad luck with whitening strips before—they always left my teeth aching. Laughland’s formula felt much gentler, even after multiple sessions.

# What I Liked About Laughland

1. **Gentle Yet Effective**: The gel lifted stains without causing sensitivity.
2. **Quick Sessions**: Each session took only 10 minutes, making it easy to stick to the routine.
3. **Natural Results**: My teeth looked naturally whiter, not ""too white"" or fake.
4. **LED Technology**: The mouthpiece helped the gel work faster, ensuring even results.

# What Could Be Improved

* **Consistency Required**: To get the full effect, you have to use it daily for six days. Missing a session could slow down results.
* **Price**: While more affordable than professional treatments, it’s still pricier than drugstore options. However, I personally think the results justify the cost.

# How Does Laughland Compare to Other Whitening Methods?

* **Whitening Strips**: These caused me discomfort and uneven whitening.
* **Whitening Toothpaste**: Works well for maintenance but isn’t strong enough to remove deep stains.
* **Professional Whitening**: Delivers quick, dramatic results but at a high cost and often with sensitivity issues.

Laughland feels like a great middle ground—effective without the pain or the hefty price tag.

# Common Questions About Laughland Teeth Whitening

1. **Is it safe for enamel?** Yes. The gel is specifically formulated to protect enamel while lifting stains.
2. **Does it work on old stains?** Yes, it worked on both recent coffee stains and older discoloration.
3. **How long do results last?** This depends on your habits. Avoiding staining foods and brushing regularly can help keep your teeth white for several months.

# Tips for the Best Results

1. **Stick to the Routine**: Consistency is key—don’t skip any sessions.
2. **Avoid Staining Foods**: Try to limit coffee, tea, and red wine during the whitening process.
3. **Maintain Good Oral Hygiene**: Brush and floss regularly to maintain your results.

# Final Thoughts: Does Laughland Work?

Based on my experience, I’d say yes. Laughland teeth whitening delivered real, noticeable results in just six days without causing any sensitivity. It’s easy to use, and I liked that it felt more professional than other at-home kits.

While it might not replace professional whitening if you’re looking for instant, dramatic changes, it’s a great option for anyone who wants a convenient, budget-friendly way to brighten their smile.

I had an issue with my team and needed his help, so I told him I wanted to talk about something. He said, “Okay, I’ll meet you in two hours, I’m having lunch outside of work.”

Our office is small, and his office is far from ours. When he came back, he took me to the company lounge. I sat in a chair, and he sat across from me. He pulled out a cigarette, started smoking, and asked, “Do you want coffee? I can buy you some.” I said, “No, thanks.”

I told him about the issue, but I felt super nervous, almost like we were on a date or something. It felt weird, like he was taking advantage of the situation. I wasn’t comfortable, so I kept it short, talked for about two minutes, then left quickly. Now I feel like my reputation might be ruined.

They tend to come in waves and generally around times of heightened emotions (a lot of the time
negative) I used to believe they were signs I was on the right path now I truly believe they are calls for immediate attention. 

I have felt bad luck following me for a number of months to the point I have been saging and cleansing my house. I performed a cleansing practice under the recent full moon and what followed the next day has truly shaken me. 

To begin with I heard an obscure phrase I have never heard before 3 x in the one morning - once on a podcast, once in a coffee shop and once with a coworker. I played a quiz game in work with my team and the answer was the movie Whiplash - we spent some time talking about it and that was that. 

I walk home and upon arrival get a phone call to say my son has badly injured himself doing a contact sport and to get there immediately. I arrive and we are awaiting the paramedics when a jazz song starts playing in the gym and the song is…Whiplash. It immediately sucked the air out of me as it’s such an obscure song choice and not the usual music for a gym. We spent some time at hospital with my family and went home to mine. Whilst my dad’s car was parked outside in the middle of a Tuesday night - it was robbed and his belongings stolen. 

I want to believe the synchronicities are signs I am being protected but these recent happenings are really testing my beliefs.

Nothing happened nothing changed. Being belittled and every cry for help was met with how it relates to substance abuse. You stop trusting. You start to realize almost every person you meet think you're full of shit when you tell them that you almost got tied to a chair and tortured to death. So you don't tell them that you can hear that person's voice even years after, that you bargain with it to be let to live. You can't tell them, because you are afraid if you do they'll force you on meds, and you might lose what little is left, the small shriveled remains of your core person.

 So you start pretending that it's all your fault. There is no excuse and you have to be a man. Is that you speaking or your stepdad who used to fucking laugh in your face and berate you when you cried? Fuck that, there is no time. 
You have to prove your life has value now, so you do all the things. You say yes to therapy, even though you know it's to late. So you do the introduction sessions, and you flake. You apologise and you try again. They stop your benefits. They try some other stuff, if you want money there is no other way. You get sent classes about mindfulness, even though it pisses you off that western society need to sprinkle some white girl bullshit on meditation to do it. It pisses you even more that every person you come across presents this as some sort of silver bullet against all mental illness. You start to get bitter, because even tho you are reflected and probably could've been someone, no one sees that anymore. They speak down to you like you are a child, it grates your ears. You just wanna info dump all your trauma, and see if the fucker can let those thoughts be trains passing through a station. But you never do, best to keep it cordial. 
You figure out the endgame, you do it one last time, get a internship, get hired, but honestly you won't be able to keep it. So you overpromise and underachieve, and disassociate while you start showing up less and less. It's over. It didn't work. 

You realize that you can't fix it, and in a flash, 10 years of repressed feelings and memories come back. You have locked those memories away to not feel sorry for yourself. You won't be able to please them if you know that it's not your fault., you need the blame to change. 

Nevertheless you remember that some doctor misdiagnosed a rare disease and gave you anti inflammatory drugs that burnt through your stomach like battery acid. You remember that you went to see another doctor, and that he scoffed when you explained that when you take the pills your stomach starts convulsing you can't stand straight and you throw them back up. It's the worst pain of your entire life, tenfold. 

You aren't sure if he believes you or understand the severity of the pain, but he prescribes another brand. On the way home you discuss with you mother how you aren't really too sure about this. Your mother agrees, but you both conclude that he's a doctor. You skip the pill that evening.

 The next morning when you take the pills, you get the worst cramp yet. You latch on to the toilet and grab a bucket to puke in. You throw up the nastiest black grout you ever seen, same the other. You pass the fuck out when you stand up, feeling like someone cut your abdomen wide open. When you wake up you are trying feebly to remember what throwing up coffee grounds mean. Fuck, you're bleeding internally, you call your mother to come pick you up, as you're unlocking the door you pass out. The next doctor sends you to the hospital within three minutes, you are in fact close to dying. They need to pump you full of morphine to keep you from shocking out. The head doctor comes to speak with you, she looks sad. She tells you that she feels bad for you, because you are being put on an unorderly amount of morphine for a19 year old, amounts normally used when addiction isn't an risk. End of life sort of stuff. She explains you'll need to veen off on oxys for three months. You do so, as a ""fun"" experiment in the second month, you are curious to see if you can postpone the pill if you wanted to. You can hold out for 20 minutes before the withdrawal cramps start to feel dangerous. You take your pill, and withdrawal rears it's clammy head no more. You finish up, but there isn't much of a followup, you go to the doctor and bring her some flowers to thank her for saving your life. You assure her you will take care of your self, and she needn't worry.

A month later you're in a strange apartment with people you never knew, only of, smoking heroin from aluminium foil. Three months later you're shooting up. You piss of the wrong people and have to run. You run, and you never stop. But you can't run forever. ",2,1736945429.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

1i1wmn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/1i1wmn4/men_want_to_be_involved_when_it_comes_to_women/,Men Want to be Involved When it Comes to Women,"Recently realized that men revolve around women. Like, they are drawn to us and seem to always want to be around a woman no matter if they know us or not. It also seems like they linger and (I dont wanna say this but…) seem to feed on our energies/aura if that makes sense.

Like for example, I saw a post about a woman on a flight with less people than expected and the flight attendant said everybody can sit wherever they would like. A man ended up sitting next to that woman despite having hundreds of empty seats available.

After I saw that post, I began to notice it. At work, I tend to this little coffee station from time to time and just do a clean up and refill of the stock. Basically, there’s coffee cups and a coffee/cream machines to go with. Every time I walk around, there’s usually only one or two people there or none at all. But EVERY time I come by and do my job, there’s always a man either spending too much time on “making” his coffee, or a man choosing the coffee machine closest to me, or several men standing behind me and just chatting. 
There’s always several men lingering quietly behind me too, just staring. 
It got so annoying and uncomfortable that I tried this hack that my coworker showed me, where I basically turn away the shelf that holds the cups. I also put up a “temporarily closed” sign, hoping to do the clean up and refills quietly. But nope, guess what the men had the audacity to do. They reached OVER the shelf to get the cups while trying to chat with me, as if there’s not a reason why I would do that or put up a sign.

Its not just work either, I notice it EVERYWHERE. Everytime I make a brief (not even a full second) eye contact to a man, they always change their way to come towards me and either sit/stand/walk by me. At transit, in line ups, while im walking, while im shopping. With anything I do, a man always just has to make himself known that he is near me. 

Does anybody else notice this or feel the way I do? I am absolutely annoyed and a kind of disgusted with the amount of men trying to surround me day to day. ",7,1736945278.0,women,1,1.0,False

Since New Year's, I've been sleeping very poorly, and a few days ago, I experienced sleep paralysis. During that episode, I had the sensation that my ""soul"" was starting to leave my body, as if it were separating from it (though this time, there was no motor-like sound). I thought to myself, ""No, I don’t want this, I can’t handle going out of my body right now!""—like a child refusing to go to school, haha :) So, I didn’t leave my body.

Instead, I think I had a lucid dream. In this dream, I was in my own apartment, specifically in the living room, wearing one of my sweaters—the kind I usually wear at home. I remember touching my coffee table to check if I was dreaming, and I could feel the texture exactly as it is in real life. When I woke up, I thought, ""What I experienced wasn’t a real OBE—it must have been a lucid dream or something similar.""

Has anyone else experienced something like this? Is this normal? Are there different types of OBEs, where some feel more ""real"" and others seem more ""dreamlike""? Thank you for your insights!",1,1736945072.0,AstralProjection,9,1.0,False

I am 32M, and have recently started to think I am a fairly slam dunk ADHD case. It has been pretty emotional but I am also also very excited about potentially having some answers. I have been writing down symptoms/experiences and I'll paste them at the bottom.

I am currently studying for a degree and the struggles involved are what got me thinking. I really want to start on medication (I understand that it might end up not being for me), and the space between now and that happening is frustrating. Knowing there is a potential solution but not having access to it yet. I have seen my GP (I am in Scotland so no RTC), and am currently researching private options.

\- Lifelong frustration at knowing I am smart and capable but having my brain shut down whenever I ask it to do things

\- Not understanding why, and resulting self-disdain

\- Academic underachievement

\- Array of coping mechanisms that allow me to lead a fairly normal looking life

\- Extreme difficulty focusing on most tasks for more than five minutes at a time

\- Physically unable to start a task even though I desperately want to, know exactly what needs to be done and the consequences of not doing it.

\- Focus improves if I have a small window of time to complete a task in, or if my day is busy and has clear set transitions between tasks

\- There is no way I will retain new information you are telling me first go if it is in any way complex

\- I don't think I've ever completed a piece of work early in my life, and I am always running late

\- Occasional extreme hyperfocus on things I'm interested in

\- Hyperfocus on one task/deadline/hobby/stressor at a time, often for weeks on end, to the detriment of everything else in my life

\- Hyperfocus often takes the form of utter overwhelm wherein I make absolutely no progress on the task

\- Projects/ideas/hobbies/journals regularly being enthusiastically started before being abandoned

\- Any sort of multi-tasking/multiple demands at the same time/deep learning task just fries my brain

\- Should I write this email or go get a coffee or go for a run or clean out the loft or message my mum or sit here stewing over all of this for the next six hours and do none of them

\- Fight or flight response to being forced to sit in one place

\- Generally quiet and introverted, but often get an irresistible urge to say something once if I get an impulse, even if I know it would be inappropriate

\- ""I can't have ADHD, I was never hyperactive or a misbehaver""

1i1wdjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1i1wdjs/strict_carnivore_accepting_hard_truths/,"Strict Carnivore, Accepting Hard Truths","I started navigating carnivore and low carb dieting around 2019. I am very interested in fitness and was always somebody that burned a lot of calories/energy. One thing that started to become glaringly obvious is sustainability. Being able to eat large amounts of calories without using products like heavy cream, butter in coffee, cheese, bacon, eggs, ribeyes, chuckeyes, etc. is the greatest challenge. Beef marbling is a new world concept, developed in the 19th century. 

And so a problem arises, of which many of these ‘strict’ versions are still not executable at the highest degree, while implying they are the highest degree.

The #1 source of fat that all strict carnivores should be eating is suet fat. Wild animals and farm animals (both pasture and feedlot) alike carry this precious fat. It does not taste as good as marbled fat, and it is much harder than marbled fat at room temperature. If you are not ready for suet fat, maybe you aren’t ready for strict carnivore dieting.

Pemmican, while a new concept to many of you, is vital for carnivore dieting. Native americans in the great plains and north america have aten this food for thousands of years, as a societal staple. In modern day it’s almost seen as taboo and ‘extreme’. It’s not. Its a pivotal meal to animal-based dieting. 

The #1 issue with strict carnivore dieting (to avoid regression aside from just weight loss) is fat intake. If you are relying on inferior fats, you will have inferior results. If you want to be strict on carnivore diet, you 1000% should be consuming pemmican as your greatest source of fat. 

Not only are you intaking great amounts of suet tallow, but you are intaking great amounts of dehydrated meat, concentrating minerals like sodium, magnesium, and potassium. When you use this as a buffer, you no longer need to rely on eating copious amounts of steak. In a caloric comparison, the same mass of pemmican is much more calorically and nutritionally dense than steak, as steaks are about 75% water. Not to say steaks don’t have their place in this diet.

The last thing is salt. For me at least, salt significantly affects my ability to digest fat, and has led to tons of water weight gain. It is easy to gain 10lbs water weight than 10lbs of body fat. And this concept of ‘loose stools’ from more fat is not because of fat. I consume over 1,000 calories of suet fat, and have done 1,000 calorie shots of rendered suet with no loose stools at all. Fat and water don’t mix, so when you eat a lot of fat, the excess water inside of you gets pushed out. Eating more fat means storing less water. Pick your poison.

Bottom line? It comes down to fat and and suet fat. The next question is how one can consume enough of this fat, that’s where pemmican comes in. I have no doubt many of you have the protein part down.",0,1736944356.0,carnivorediet,6,0.5,False

Also before I go on, there is no actual cheating happening, everything that happened is consensual and everybody knew about everything, so no worries there.

  
So, my girlfriend (F25) and I (M26) have been together for a long time, almost eight years. Over the years a lot of changes happened in our lives. Most notably for me was her finding out that she's asexual with feeling repulsed by anything sexual. This has been a really big adjustment for me and it took me a while to get over it. I've been fine for years and we early on agreed that we would have a sexually open relationship so that I can potentially get what I can't get from her elsewhere (this obviously meant she could do the same but asexuality, so it didn't apply).

For the last years I've not had any kind of sexual relationship irl and mostly used online things like Reddit to get my sexual urges out via roleplay and sexting and the like. This has worked well but over the years I realized that I actually developed something of an addiction to that kind of thing and I hid it from my girlfriend. It wasn't that I hid what I was doing, but how much and that it actually affected my life. 

And then, a few weeks ago I met someone at a bdsm event. She's exactly my type and we vibe incredibly well. This kind of has always been what my girlfriend and I were talking about, a friend to do the sexual things with that I couldn't get from her. And for the longest time I was 100% certain that I could separate sex and emotions. But this woman is so nice and so much my type. In a way she's very similiar to my girlfriend (my gf said so herself) but she does not have her aversion to touch and her repulsiveness to sexual things. 

Either way we decided to go to a play party together and in preparation for that realized even more just how much we actually enjoy each others company. Safe to say I developed a pretty sizeable crush on her. Worse than that though, I realized just how much I actually have suppressing my needs for physcial intimacy for years. 

It felt like a crushing weight on me. On the one hand I have my girlfriend of eight years, a person I build a live with, a person that my nieces call aunt, a person that I could easily see myself with for the rest of my life but on the other hand is a woman who I met a few months ago, had coffee a few times with and discussed a bdsm party with and I feel like all I want is to spend time with her, have her hold me, hold her and so on so forth.

I didn't know what to do and in my confusion it all broke down within me to the point that I convinced myself I needed to leave my girlfriend. Not because I fell in love with another person (we're definitely not there yet by any means) but because I felt unloved, unwanted by years of having suppressed my needs without even realizing that I was doing that. I mustered my courage, spoke to her and left the apartment but to my luck my amazing girlfriend called me back and after mulling it over I did and we talked for a long time. During that we learned a lot of stuff about each other. This mental breakdown that I had also was kind of fired up by many other things (mental health, stress, struggles in over relationship that we see, etc.) and she forgave me for jumping the gun.

She also acknowledged my feelings and together we discussed so much, also that her autism and my adhd don't mix well with certain things, that she has a way harder time at seeing social cues than I thought and I felt unseen because she literally does not see it. It was a mess, hurtful, painful, but it's over now and we think we can only grow from that. 

To bring it back to what kinda kickstarted this whole mess though. During our talk I mentioned to my girlfriend that I'm also confused about my own sexuality as well as confused if I am polyamorous. A good friend of mine is in a poly relationship and since seeing that I've been playing with the thought in my head but for all the years in my relationship I never once felt this need with anyone else so I assumed it's not a thing for me. After the dust settled my gf mentioned that she never once was against a poly relationship. Similiarly to me though she just didn't really think it would've been a thing either of us necessarily wanted. She said that in her head, when she thinks about me being with another woman it doesn't hurt her, that we have a not really traditional relationship anyways and since she met the other woman as well she said that she also has a very positive first impression of her. 

Obviously I first thought she said that only to calm me, to bring me away from the idea of breaking up so I made very very sure very often to ask if she really means it. She assures me yes, that she is, if anything else, more than willing to try out how it feels. 

Since then I'm kind of in a turmoil of different emotions. The wish to break up is gone, fully. When I'm with my girlfriend I'm happy, pure and simple, how I've been the last years. But the moment she leaves for work or something I think about the other person, wanting them, knowing that I'll have this big event in just a few days and that I would like to spend so much more time with them. In my heart it really feels like I just want both of them as much as possible and it's weird, this is a new feeling and I don't know how to really deal with it. 

I'm also aware that some of these feelings are from the excitement that this is something new. I suspect if I actually do a lot of things with this person it'll die down somewhat. I'm basically immensely starved for something and will have that sated somewhat very soon so it's just excitement thats killing me. But also chatting with her, flirting, etc. feels like a new crush developing, it's such a good, sweet feeling.

Now here's the big kicker, the main thing other than just venting my hurricane of weird emotions. How do I deal with the feeling of cheating? I told my girlfriend essentially all the things in this post and I asked her, repeatedly to tell me that what I am doing is not cheating, that it is completely consensual. Basically I said that I'd need these kind of affirmations and she is totally fine with that.

I think a reason for my trouble is that in my head, my girlfriend and I have a very roomate like relationship most of days and loving moments peppered in between which I think is fairly normal for a long term relationship but this other person feels like my internal description of a relationship, really intimate, butterflies, nervousness, etc. It's two not necessarily opposing but still different things and I can't seem to wrap my head around it all. 

Also I had to chuckle a bit when I looked up poly stuff after that talk. It seems that per definition we are already in a kind of poly relationship, we just haven't really called it that yet. Also also, I have not yet brought most of this up with the other person, all I know is that she enjoys poly relationships or at least the idea of it and is very interested in it.

Writing this out already helped some. I'm just still afraid I'm doing something wrong but I just need help to ease my mind. Maybe someone was/is in a different relationship and can help me by telling me their stories? I'd appreciate any kind of help! :)

I’m struggling mentally and have been for a long time, I believe I am suffering from severe anxiety and have recently started taking Propranolol to slow my heart and Sertraline as an antidepressant after discussing this with my doctor.  There have been a lot of stressful situations recently in my life and this has pushed me over the edge.

This all started in it’s most recent severity over Christmas. I had quit vaping for 10 days, I hadn’t drunk caffeine for 6 months, anyway a relapse on the vaping and 3 days of drinking coffee sent me into a panic attack which kept me up most of the night. 2 days later I had another.

Ever since then I’ve been on edge. Always feeling slightly shaky as if something isn’t quite right. 

The worse thing I have at the moment is the actual feeling of anxiousness. It comes in wakes of dread, like a nervous feeling. They are short lived by often happen throughout the day. 

I also seems to wake up at the moment about 4 hours into sleep with palpitations, and wake up in the morning with what feels like (although it isn’t as I check my pulse) a racing heart.

Walkies on the beach with my ‘dog



A summer day was my day at the beach. My ‘dog’ and I had fun playing with the sand. We played fetch.



He ran all over! They continued to look and smile. It was all fantastic up to that moment and then we had to return home.



I called my dog, but, he just stayed there! I tried again, “Come here, Coconut! And guess what? Coconut, my pet actor, flew over to me.



Throughout the day, people confused Coconut for a dog!! It sure was a funny mix-up!",0,1736943727.0,WritingWithAI,4,0.25,False

I jog/run almost everyday and I always feel itchy and feel a pricking sensation on my legs. I thought that was normal and that was an indication that I am burning fat (lol). But I have read something that has same situation as me — OP has exercise-induced uticaria. I researched about it and got alarmed since it is indicated that it might be life threatening. And read some information that might be connected with that condition. Like I usually have difficulty breathing while running. I thought it is because I run intensely. I also don't sweat a lot. Even I run at 10km, after playing badminton, and even playing football. I always joke about me overheating because I am always hot and, just like I said, don't sweat a lot. I read also last night about hypohidrosis. I didn't know that's a thing. 

I got alarmed about this discovery because I will be having football trainings at 5-7am and will have a full-packed schedule of classes afterwards.

What advice would you give about this situation? What kind of doctor should I seek guidance on this matter? What food should I eat? What should I change on my lifestyle? 

Btw, for more information (if this would be helpful), I am a 22 yr old female. Always sleeping late, I eat what is available / easy to find (canned goods, cup noodles, fastfood), drinks 2-3 cups of coffee a day, and always stressed since I am also a medicine student.

I have a relatively complete list with some gaps. I'd like to hear thoughts on my plan. We're giving ourselves 10 days so there isn't tons of pressure to get everything done. I'm also very aware that the end of my trip overlaps with LNY and there will be closures around the city. I'd like to experience as much as possible before so I can equally experience the city during LNY. Let me know what I'm missing and if anything could be skipped (food or activities).

With that being said, everyone in the office is still amazing from the dentists to the office admin. I really want to show them how much that means to me. I was thinking of buying a bunch of bagels/donuts/coffee for the whole staff, but I am not sure if that’s the best way to go about it.

Thanks in advance!",2,1736943321.0,Dentists,3,1.0,False
